Treasury Department State
ment Very Pessimistic Re
garding the Response to Ap
peals Throughout the Na
tion. By Review Leed Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16. With 14
working days gone and only ten more
to come. Liberty bond sales were, be
lieved by treasury officials tonight to
have just touched the $l,0O0,000.0U0
mark, a result which has led them
to wonder if the $3,000,000,000 hoped
for could be attained in the final days
of the campaign.
"Committees in almost every part
of the country still wire encouragingly
that they can make their maximum
totals," says a treasury department
s'atement. "Possibly they can. but
either they are concealing their ac
tual sales which is not believed to
be the case or there must be a most
unexpected spurt in the offering.
Lack of Confidence.
"Certainly there is little about the
sales thus far to warrant great con
fidence that the 15 000,000.000 mark
will be reached."
Official figures, representing actual
sales, reported tonight to the treas
ury department at the close of busi
' ness yesterday places the total at
$528,320,850, or little more than half
the. $1,000,000,000 believed to hav
been subscribed. These figures do
not include the result of a two-day
canvass made by 60,000 workers in
the Minneapolis district, and placo
the amounts in other districts far be
low the sums reported unofficially.
The totals follow: Boston, $68,300,
000; New York. 307,707,000; Philadel
phia, $19,441,500; Cleveland, $2,090.
000; Richmond, $24 659.600; Atlanta,
$7,405,700; Chicago. $56,145,000; St.
Louis. $4,331,800; Kansas City, $2,025,
0( 0; Dallas, $4,550,300; San Francisco,
531 554.950; Minner.pclis, no report.
Not Encouraging.
"Granting the most reasonable al
lowance for unreported sales," the
treasury's statement continues,' 'the
situation is not encouraging. 'Every
day since the beginning of the drive,
October 1, the daily quota necessary
to achieving the desired total of
$5,000,000,000 by October 27. the last
day of the sale, has grown larger
until tonight it reaches, in all prob
ability, the enormous figures of $400
000.000. At fiie outset of the sale, a
daily average of slightly less than
$210,000,000 would have made the
maximum total possible.
Discrepancies Seen.
"The greatest discrepancies between
the official and latest unofficial re
ports occur in the New Yorkj Boston,
Cleveland. Philadelphia and Kansas
City districts. Late reports from New
York and Boston today show their
totals to be $413,000,000 and above
$80 000.000. respectively. Cleveland
has more than $75,000,000; Philadel
phia more than $80,000,000. and while
no figures for the entire Kansas City
district are availpble. It is known that
Omaha alone has subscribed about
$10,000,000.
Brightest Spot.
'The brightest spot in the campaign
today appeared to be in the northwest
ern states of Minnesota, North Dakota,
South Dakota and Montana, where
the sales forces began work for thi
first time yesterday. Orders will be
ron in effect in ail those states for
the removal of the state funds from
banks not giving their hearty co-oper-ntion
to the sale. It was officially re
ported tonight. Indications, however,
that enforcement of this" order will be
unnecessary, as the banks are tally
ing, along with the rest of the people,
to unqualified support of the loan.
Sales in Army.
"Army sales continued to increase
tonight until the boys in khaki had
bought more than $25,000,000 in bonds.
"Competition in southern camps for
top honors is particualrly keen. Speak
ers throughout the country are using
the example of the soldiers, who were
willing to sacrifice both their live
and their dollars for the cause.

CHEAT CHANGE IN
COMMERCE SURE
SAYS SECRETARY
Redfield Tells Southern Com

ture Growth of American
Commerce is Up to U. S.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEV YORK. Oct. 16. What a dif
ferent world of trade this will be after
the war was pictured to the Southern
Commercial Congress- here tonight by
Secretary Redfield in an address tell
ing or the cutting of the threads of
Germany's foreign commerce by her
own act, and of the awakening ot
America arid her allies to the danger
of having their industries dependent
upon foreign and possibly unfriendly
sources of support.
"When peace shall come ' and her
merchants take up the task of restor
ing Germany's ruined commerce they
will find that it is subject or whico
they wish to re-enter.
New Difficulties Seen.
"There will be difficulties in the
path of future' peaceful penetration
of which they seem not to dream.
Commercial ftightfullness, like its
military namesake, will have passed
away.
Never Again!
"It will hardly be saia.agarn to any
secretary of commerce of the United
States that the German dyestuff in
dustry veerein will not 'permit' the
establishment of an American dyestuff
industry. The monopolies on which
German foreign commerce in large
part seemed to rest secure have pass
ed away. Our friends beyond the sea
and we ourselves have learned the
danger of having our industries wholly
dependent on foreign sources of sup
ply which may become unfriendly.
' What Germany Expects.
"It is pitiful to read extracts from
the German press which seem to show
that they expect to take up the task
of rebuilding their commerce where
they laid it down.
"Good Will."
"I need not tell you of the commer
cial value of what we call 'good will
or point the advantage or doing busi
ness as a going concern. The great
markets of the world have been and
are to be found among the nations)
who have parted company with Ger
many in the present struggle.
The peoples of these lands are not
likely by one common impulse to turn
to Germany for a renewal of one com
mercial intercourse which was broken
by her act.
Provincialism Falling.
"It must be renewed under circum
stances of hardship. It will be a sub
ject upon which the German merchant
will look when war shall close, so let
me add it will be in a large measure
a strong world which the American
merchant will .took out en at the
same time. When embargoes are over
and trading with the enemy acts
shall have ceased to trouble, we also
shall see things differently. The
novelty will not on our part arise
from separation but the reverse. We
have gained and are gaining a better
understanding of the world we live
in. Scales of provincialism have fal
len from our eyes.
All Nations Preparing.
"If we were those who look upon
the peaceful contests of commerce as
economic war, we should hardly feel
we could speak with freedom in the
presence or the coming days when
normal industrial intercourse through
out t.'ie world shall replace present
restricted conditions ror we recognizs
as a matter of course, as an opportuni
ty and a duty, they are not slow to
see and upon which they rightly act,
that the nations associated with us

"Believing as we do, however, that

cation or the new feeling of friendship.
This paper is called Actualidodes and
contains a number of leading articles
favorable to the allies' cause. This
paper is expected to counter-act ilia
strong German propaganda which has
been spread in the state by pepers

say the pro-German feeling has given
way to a pro-ally sentiment and antig

Food Administration An
nounces That Count ry's
Use of Sugar Must Be Re
duced to Prevent Real
Famine.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16. The East
ern states race a sugar shortage with
no prospect or relier before late In No
vember when the new Hawaiian and
western beet crops arrive. In a state
ment tonigh: rorecastlng the shortage,
the food administration again appeal
ed to the American people to cut down
their consumption of candy and sweet
drinks and at the same lime gave
warning that retailers already have re
ceived their sleeks at prices recently
agreed upon and the puDlic should pay
no more during the temporary short
age in the east than It has been pay
ing during the last 30 days.
Public Is Blamed.
The shortage is due, the administra
tion says, to the failure of the public
outside of a few loyal homes to reduce
consumption and the "unusual exports
to France in order that the French
people may have their meager ration
of one pound of sugar per person per
month.
Maximum Prices.
In regard to prices attention is call
ed to the fact thatby agreement the
price ot beet and Hawiian sugar bas
been fixed at 7 14 cents a pound, At
lantic and Pacific seaboard basis un
der which the maximum retail price at
interior points should be eight and a
quarter cents while by an agreement
with cane sugar, refiners and Cuban
producers the price or can sugar has
been held down so that it should
reach the consumer at about 9 cents a
pound. r
The administration notes that it still
Is waiting a reply to its appeal to the
Louisiana producers to join in the
agreement.
Temporary Shortage.
'There will be a temporary shortage
In the supply or sugar to the area
n'orth or Savannah and east or Pitts
burg," the rood administration state
ment said ''during the latter part ot
October and the month or November,
pending the arrival in the market or
new sugar. The beet sugar factories
in the western states are rapidly com
ing into action, and, together with the
Hawiian production will be able in a
short time to take care of the sugar
supply in the area west "or the territory
referred to.
Economies Necessary.
"As the production of beet and Ha
wiian sugar increases the areas sup
plied from this will gradually extend
eastward and beet sugar should reach
the Atlantic seaboard by the end or
November. The rapidity with which
this sugar invasion from the west can
take place, will be largely controlled
by the economies shown in the con
sumption or sugar by the people in
the west and the rood administration
makes a special appeal to them that
they should rigorously reduce the con
sumption or sugar, more especially or
candy and sweet drinks, in order that
the northeastern states may be sup
plied at the earliest possible moment.
Source Of Increases.
"Practically all or the cane sugar
in the hands or the refiners and the
producers has been distributed to the
jobbers and retailers at the prices
maintained during the last two
months, or upon a basis that should
reach the consumer in the neighbor
hood or 9 cents per pound. Therefore,
if by virtue or the shortage In the
eastern states, the price or sugar
should increase, it Is only proof that
it has been increased at the bands of
the handling trades not at the hands
of either the producer or the refiner.
The rood administration asks the pub
lic not to pay more ror sugar during
the present shortage than it has been
paying the last 30 days. When the
supply ot beet sugar reaches the Atlan
tic seaboard, it should be available
up'on a less basis than the cane prices
above mentioned.
Distribute With Cars.
"Furthermore, the rood administra
tion requests that all jobbers in the
west as well as in the east should dis
tribute their sugar with care amongst
the retailers in much reduced quanti
ties and that the retailers, in turn,
should refuse to sell but a very limit

General Germonius of the' Russian,'

The Associated Tress correspond

in this tour. He reports that Russia's
new factories, the erection of with h
became necessary through the diminu
tion, of supplies from other .countries,
were found to be the most modernly
equipped and efficient factories of
their kind in the world.
The new plants include a great aero

large machine pun factory already
working to full capacity and artillery
factories. A further encouraging fea-
i dominated- over purely manual labor
the capacity and output have dimin
ished only slightly, notwithstanding
the anarchistic tendency prevailing
throughout the country.
The capacity of the new Murman
railroad, it appears, has been greatly
increased, bu there is a sad short
age of rolling stock. This will bo
smoewhat alleviated by transfers from
the Archangel line when that port
becomes ice-bound. But even then
there will be a great need for more
locomotives. Though the capacity of
the port of Murman has been greatly i
. .. .. ... t
increased, the present capacity will
have been increased again by 30 per
cent by the beginning of October.
The partial demobilization, which
was recently ordered, is expected to
have immediatley beneficial results.
Not only will the demobilization bring
an army of laborers back to the land,
but it wit! at the very outset make that a dreary prospect has arisen be

Banditry Causes
Mexico Greatest
Present Problem
(By Review Leased Wire.)
. MEXICO CITY. Oct. 16. A commit
tee from the chamber of deputies Vo
day called on President Carranza for
! an exchange of views on the situation
dent made the following statement
"The government is confronted with
no political or military piVmlems. Vil
la has scattered his forces, Felix Diaz
has never caused much apprehension.
The real problem facing the govern
ment is that of providing ample guar
antees to society against banditism.
This has increased with the coming
of constitutional order which gives the
bandits greater advantages than are
possessed by the troops pursing them.
Consequently I recommend to congress
that personal guarantees be suspend
ed so far as these enemies of the gov
eminent and of public order are con
cerned
"In international relations, friend
ship is maintained with the whole
world. Only with the United States
are frequent negotiations pending be
cause that country has prevented the
exportation of metal and the funds of
Mexico deposited there can noly be
paid in paper, which, owing to the dif
ference of exchange creates a balance
unfavorable to Mexico. But up to this
date in every instance these negotia
tions have resulted favorably and it is
probable that a general treaty on this
matter will be concluded."
It has already been announced that
an arrangement had been made by
which the balance of trade due Mexico
would be allowed to be sent fi'om the
TTnitO'l Clata. In 1.1 ; 1. . 1.
.... . , , . ,
derstandmg that Mexico should re-
move her anibargo on the exportation
of metal.
El Universal, one of the largest
newspapers in Mexico, commenting on
the president's statements says:
"It is-not to be doubted that a gen
eral feeling jf lack of confidence has
arit:en over the economic situation and
congress as well as in all political and
intellectutal centers it is felt that the
best manner of settling this problem
would be to find the proper bearings
of ourselves in regard to our foreign
relations, and it is hoped that the ex
ecu.ive or congress will act to this
end."

said it was notorious that armed as

Germans Are Sent
to Ellis Island
For War's Length
By Review Leased WlreJ
NEW YORK, Oct. 16. Frit Kuhn,
prior to the outbreak of the war Lon
don representative of the Deutsche
Banks of Berlin, and Geor von ZebecK,
also formerly connected with a Ger
man bank in London, were taken in
to custody here tonight by the intel
ligence bureau of the navy department
and sent to Ellis Island for internment
as dangerous enemy aliens.
Von Zebeck is believed to be the
son of Baron von Zebeck, commander
of the German tenth army corps at
Leige.
Both men fled from England to es
cape internment there as enemy aliens
and came to the United States. Both
were known by reputation to many
American bankers and found no
trouble in obtaining employment with
the Guaranty Trust company of this
city. Von Zebeck soon became head
of one of the divisions of the foreign
department. More than a year ago
however, the Guaranty Tnist company
dropped them from their rolls of em
ployes because of their pro-German
sympathies.
After that both obtained employ
ment with an importing house. Con
siderable secrecy was maintained as
to their antecedents and no informa
tion was obtainable concerning their
pro-German activities.
Von Zebeck is reputed to be a mem
ber of a family of famous German
army commanders. He chose civil
life, however, rather' than the army
and entered the service of a Berlin
bank, later being sent to the London
branch of the institution.
While in London he was a frequent
visitor to the Germany embassy and
when war between his country and
England became imminent he came to
this country.
Kuhn is reported to have heen a
friend of Count von Bernstorff, for
mer German Ambassador. His father
Is a banker and lives in Mannheim.
He and Von Zebeck were connected
with the Guaranty Trust company
when Bolo Pasha was receiving Ger
man funds through that institution.
Both men applied last May for per
mits to pass zones barred to enemy
aliens, but It could not be learned
whether permits Jiad been granted.

AIDS GOVERNMENT
TO SECURE TYPISTS
United States and Neighbor
Republic Come to Agree
ment Relative to Export and
Import Restrictions.
Tha Warren District Commercial
club received a letter from the Cham
ber of Commerce of the United States
in wnich a patriotic appeal was ma Jo
for stenographers for the government
departments at Washington.
With the extraordinary demands up
on the government departments in
Wasnington, consequent upon the war.
the government announces that there
is an immediate need of thousands of
typewriter operators and stenoghaphic
operators.
Examinations for these position
paying $1,000.00. to $1,200.00 a year,
have for some weeks been held each
Tuesday ' under the direction of the
U. S. civil service commission in all
the more important cities of the coun
try, but the demand is increasing at
such a rate that unusual effort is nec
essary to meet the requirements.
An appeal is made to members -f
all commercial organizations to re
lease, in the interest of the govern
mental! of their employes who can
be spared without materially affect
ing the conduct of their business. The
appeal is an appeal ;o :ne patrtousni
of the employer, that he give of the
most skilled of his employes, as the
government is entitled to the best, not
the worst and is designed at the
same time to impress upon the re
maining employes, as their contribu
tion to the government, the necessity
of working the harder to meet the
added burdens.
Examinations for these positions are
open and competitive, for both men
and women. At present vacancies
exist only in the government depart
ments at Washington, D. C. The pas
sage of examinations is practically
equivalent to appointment. Applicants
must have reached their eighteenth
birthday. Detailed information as to
nature of examination and similar In-
formation may be had by addressing
U. S. Civil Service Commission, Wasn
ington, D, C.
Members of the commercial club
are urged to give this matter careful
consideration, as the problem is a
most vital one, affecting directly the
expeditious conduct of the government
affairs and, as such, certain to operate
as a check on the conduct of the war,
if not fully met.

REPORTED WQflSE
Word from the Copper Queen hospit
al yesterday was to the effect that L.
A. Brown was much worse and that his
condition is considered serious.
ARIZONA MEN ARE .
' TO EE SENT TO
CAMP KEARNEY
Admitting that conditions at Camp
Funston are not of the best and that
the men stationed thre are not com
lonable, General Leonard A. Wood
has informed Governor Thomas E,
Campbell that 6,000 troops from Ari
zona, New Mexico and Colorado will
be sent to Linda Vista, Cal., as soon
as Camp Kearney is ready to receive
them. This information came to the
governor yesterday in the form of a
telegram from General Wood reply
ing to the suggestion oi the execu
tive that if possible the Arizona
troops be removed to Linda Vista
where the climatic conditions are more
i.early like those of Arizona than they
are at Fort Riley.
When the I-.-t contingent was
about to leave for Kar.sns, Governor
Campbell took Hip the matter of per
mitting the men to carry along extra
bedding. Word had cone to him that
the men already there were uncom
fortable from lack of sufficient blank
ets, although they had been prom
ised additional bed covering as soon
as it was available. As a result of
this an order was issued allowing the
men from Arizona to carry two blank
ets as part of Iheir equipment.
Since then further complaints of the
conditions a' the camp have been r
c(ive(f here and then the thought oc
curred 10 Governor Campbell that the
I men would be more comfortable :f
removed to California.
"Six thousand Coloraio. New Mexi
co and Arizona troops will be sent
to Linda Vista as soon as Camp Kear
ney. Cal., Is ready to receive them."
reads General Wood's telegram to Gov
ernor Campbell. "Details are now be
ing arranged and I anticipa'e troops
referred to will be removed before
severe weather sets in. This camp is
not comfortable, but so far there has
'been little sickness."
In addition to the satisfaction felt
! over the fact that the men are likely
soon to be in training in a climate
I less rigorous than that of Kansas at
this season of the year, the governor
Is also pleased to learn of their early
removal to California for he believes
this is but the forerunner of the ul'i
mate consolidation of the Arizona se
lected men with the members of the
First Arizona infantry, which is soon
to be sent to Linda Vista. It will
j mean that the Arizona men will not
i be scattered among the various units,
but will go forward as a solid body
from the newest state. This is the
end so long sought and one which the
men themselves will welcome.

somewhat, as did reports of larger

the absorption of treasury certificates,
but aside from these features there
was nothing in the day's news budget

Liquidation has"been so drastic and
selling so freely indulged in that the
market doubtless became oversold on
the rally which ensued, thus based
largely on technical grounds rather
than on constructive occurrences,
however, the price level has become
so low that there is less attraction
now than before in continuing to ex
change securities for liquid funds in
order that the latter may be avail
able for other purposes, than, too, of
course, the actual worth of shares as
measured by the usual standards is
in many Instances much above cur
rent quoted values. Accordingly, the
investment demand from now on
should be much more of a factor than
heretofore. Until there is a clearing

CONTINENTAL SOLIDARITY.
Never in the history of North and South America has
there been the tendency toward a unification of interests
such as have been apparent in the last few months.
North America, excepting Mexico, is solid -for a just
cause. South America, with the exception of two big
nations, has thrown the mantle of war down to the Ger
man Kaiser. Argentine and Chili are wavering and if
the signs of the times point correctly even Mexico will
see where her interest lies before the international con
flagration lias been put out.
Peru, latest of South American republics to sever all
relations with the Imperial German government, dwells,
in its note of explanation to the American government,
upon the necessity of continental solidarity. Francisco
Tudela, minister of foreign affairs for Peru, says
"From the beginning of the great war in which the
most powerful people ot the world are involved, the
Peruvian government has strictly performed the duties
imposed upon it by international law and has loyally
maintained the neutrality of the republic, trusting that
its neutral rights would in turn be respected by the belli
gerents, but when the conflagration spread to the Ameri
can continent notwithstanding the efforts exerted for
nearly three years by the United States government to
keep that great people out of the conflict Peru was con
fronted bv new duties springing from its passionate de
sire for the continental solidarity that has ever been the
goal of Its foreign policy, and by the necessity of defend
ing its rights from the new form of maritime warfare set
up by Germany.
"That was the reason why, on receiving notice of the
belligerency of the United States caused by the proceed
ings of the Berlin government in violation of international
law, the Peruvian government, far from declaring itself
neutral, recognized the justice of the stand taken by the
Washington government. And for the same reason the
president of Peru, in his message to congress, and the
minister of foreign affairs, in the chamber of deputies
with the express approval of the parliament, solemnly
affirmed the adhesion of our country to the principles
of international justice proclaimed by President Wilson.
"It was the Peruvian government's wish that the policy
of the whole continent be a concerted ratification of the
attitude of the Washington government, which took up
the defense of neutral interests and insisted on the ob
servance of international law. But the course of events
did not result in joint action; each country shaped its
course in defense of its own invaded rights as it was
individually prompted in its adherence to the principles
declared by the United States. Peru, for its part, while
endeavoring to give prevalence to a uniform continental
policy, maintained with the utmost firmness the integrity
of its rights as a sovereign nation in the face of Germanyg
disregard of the principles of naval warfare.
"It was the defense of those rights which led it to
sever its diplomatic relations with the Imperial govern
ment as the result of an outrage for which it duly but
vainly claimed appropriate reparation the sinking of Ui
vessel Lorton by a German submarine on the coast of
Spain while the ship was plying between neutral ports
engaged in a lawful trade without infringing even the
German rules respecting closed zone unknown to Inter
national law."
Mexico. Argentine an.l Chili still remain without the
pale of those nations fighting for their rights and for
the right of small countries. Argentine, it appears, has
narrowly escaped being plunged into the war through
the exposures of the machinations of the German charge
d' affairs. Count von Luxhurg. Chili keeps Its own coun
sel but if the world Is to believe the opinion of several
newspapers, the nation Is considering concerted action
or solidarity of action. Mexico is the stumbling block
in continental unity, being the barrier to a perfect under
standing between Anglo-Saxon America and Latin
America. ,
So much has been written of Mexico's position in
the great war. and especially since the United States
has thrown in its lot with that of the entente, that it
would be useless to dwell upon those reasons again. The
fact remains that Mexico is In the position of a father
who does not need the child but is needed by the off
spring.
Mexico must have the United tSates. Before this na
tion declared war there was always the possibility that
the neighbor republic could get succor from some of the
entente nations. Now the nations, aligned with the Uni
ted States, are looking to the United States to furnish
the sinews of the struggle. Whatever the American gov
ernment says regarding American affairs will, undouht
edly. be law with England. France. Italy and Russia.
Mexico must come home.
Greatest of all needs in Mexico is money. Some would
point to Germany 'as a possible source which Mexico
might tap. The Imperial German government might
furnish enough money in the country of the Montezumts
to further its Kulturistic propaganda a million or two
pesos but its needs are not to be reckoned in a million
or two pesos. One hundred million dollars will but lift
the pall of revolution and desolation which has settled
on the country.
The wise men of Mexico are looking to the future.
Mexico needs finances. The nation must have money in
order to rehabilitate itself. There is but one bank
where Mexico can make the loan and that institution is
known the world over as the United States of America.
Continental solidarity means more than the mere dec
laration of war against Germany. It must mean a better
understanding between the American Anglo-Saxon and
the American Latin. For many years the smaller nations
have been fearful of Uncle Sam's prosperity and prog
ress. This was translated by German propagandists
who were also jealous of America's potentialities into
the South American languages as imperialism. 1
Events have piled fact on fact In such great succes
sion during the past few years, and so many of them
have pointed to the complete good feeling of the United
States for all of the Latin American republics, that the
mellifluous phrases of Germans are now being returned
in the shape of ultimatums. South America is fast
realizing the paramountcy of continental solidarity, with
the United States as the leader.
STILL AMERICA'S FIRST WEAPON OF WAR.
It is stated from Camp Upton that the men of the as
sembling 77th Division of the National Army will do mor?
sharpehooticg than bayoneting or bombing, says the New
York World. While rifles for the moment are scarce,
the men are given turns in practice and work on the
rifle-ranges is being rushed. This is doubtless in response
to General Pershing's recent message from France, that
the rifle is still a weapon to be counted on even in trench
warfare, and that the first work for the American soldier
in training is to "learn how to shoot."
The musket with the grooved bore is of Swiss origin
but of practical American development and use. It was
first made known to the world as the then most formida
ble weapon of war by Morgan's riflemen in the Revolu
tion, and it is here interesting to note that the few makers
of rifles known to the Continental Congress had their
whole product commandeered at prices fixed by congress.
The world's next great lesson from (the rifle was given
by Jackson's Kentuckians and Tennesseeans at New Or
leans, whose straight shooting mowed down the massed
columns of British just as fast as they came forward and
left hardly a British officer standing in the whole field.
It is not the rifle and its first use alone which has
made it pre-eminently the American weapon in war. It
is the man trained to its superior use that has so as
sociated the rifle with the American soldier and marine.
European armies for near a century have used this
weapon, but they have never known how to shoot it
with the old American precision. With its present longer
range and breech-loading and repeating equipment a
large American army that could shoot like Jackson's old
frontiersmen might have stopped the German invasion
Of 1914 long before It reached the Marne. .
It Is encouraging news from Pershing that the rifle
has not yet been sidetracked in the great war. Other
weapons and agencies have come into new and greater
prominence than ever before, but for the United States
soldier at least the rifle remains the fundamental weapon
along with the old condition of knowing how to shoot i:
straight.
THE JUNK MAN.
Nearly every householder and every man and woman.
particularly those of pure American stock or of the sec
ond generation of Europeans, throws away a great amount
of junk. During the present times, when potato peelings
are sought for and when stray pins are still considered
as metal, the junk man is a home product. To get the
greatest efficiency from the household every man should
be his own junk man.
Throughout the country junk is coming into its own.
Sale of the Celilo portage railroad, in New York state,
for $16,000 more than it cost is an indication of the valu-J
to be placed upon metals. This reminds the Cochise
county resident or the old railroad bed and some rails
which lie in the Sulphur Springs Valley.
There is not a great deal of the road left, but what
there is should be conserved.
British authorities have scrapped entire railroads In
Its possession. Canada has furnished nearly 1,000 miles
of such war materials. It is taken to Europe and used
behind the allied lines. It is invaluable.
Not alone is metal to be highly prized. Food, accord
ing to every expert in the country, must be junked. The
term is used in the sense of conserved. The United States
lias never felt the real pinch of food necessity. It iii
to be hoped that the need for bread tickets and the al
sence of good coffee will never lie felt. There is one
way to make sure that the wolf will never join the rank
of America's other enemies.
Be your own junk man!
BAPTIST MINISTER
ENDORESES TANLAC
"It Not Only Helped Me, But
My Little Daughter Derived
Great Benefit From It,"
Says Rev. EL G. Butler. I
One of the most noteworthy features
in connection with the introduction of j
Tanlac throughout the s'outh and west i
has been the large number of minis
ters of the gospel who have unhesitat
ingly and voluntarily given this won
derful medicine their unqualified en
dorsement. Rev. E. G. Butler, pastor of the Cen
tal Baptist church and residing at 624
East Side Boulevard, Muskogee, Okla
homa, is one of the latest who have
been restored to health by its use. Rev.
Butler has been pasiVtr of this church
for the past three years and is not only
held in the highest esteem by the hun
dreds of his church followers, but is
exceedingly prominent as a man and
citizen. In describing his troubles
and failure to heretofore find relief.
Rev. Butler said:
"I suffered from nervousness more
or less for the last two years. I could
not sleep t'oundly and for the past year
i suffered from severe attacks of acu.e
indigestion. The pains in my stomach,
which I was told was gall stone colic,
were often very intense and the relief
1 got was only temporary. I had to
diet myself with great care and I
couldn't gel any restful sleep at night,
1 not only suffered a great deal of pain
but became so weak and run-down that
I w'juld tire very quickly in trying to
do my work.
"After reading of the work Tanlac
was doing, I decided to give it a trial
and the results I have go ten from four
or live bottles have been most satis
factory. I sleep well at night now,
eat anything I like and relish every
meal. I'm not nervous any more and
reel full of life and vior. Tanlac has
ujt only helped me wonderfully, but
my little daugh:er, Francis, has deriv
ed great benefit from it. She has nev
er been strong but has grown much
stronger since she has been using Tan
lac. She has never been able to at
tend school more than four months in
the year until now, she goes regularly,
sxcept ;o rest a few days Just occasion-
lily. Tanlac has proven to be the
,-ight thing for us both and I am glad
.'j recommend it as the best medicine
i have ever tried."
Commenting on the above state
neut, E. E. Snii:ti, the Tanlac repre
sentative said:
"I distinctly recall a number of oth
er members of this high calling who
liave publicly expressed their indebted
ness to this medicine and who felt it
..heir duty to :ell fuffering humani;y
of the great benefit they had derived
frum its use. Among them are Rev.
F. M. Winburn, 308 North Frio street,

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, 'until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in, any dwelling, large or smalL
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

ta $162.
If the balance of Cochise county and
the United States does as well per
capita as have the members of the
Tenth cavalry of the United States.
there will be no cause for alarm about
the Liberty Bond issue not being over
subscribed. In fact, it would be over
subscribed many times. According to
the figures given over the phone last
evening to The Review by Captain
Dixon, the per capita rate per man in
the regiment now figures at $100.42,
with a possibility of its being raised
by the end of the week. As the figures
now stand the regiment, with a total
of 1.29S men present, have subscribed
for $130,350, while other divisions con
nected with them have added to the
total, making a total of $139,830.
For the past week the officers of
the different troops have been having
a Liberty Bond drive in an effort to
see which troop could raise the largest
amount and the drive is not yet com
pleted. As the matter now stands troop
K" has the largest amount with $14,-
000 to its credit, or a per capita rate
of $162.67. Below is given the amount
subscribed by each troop at the close

Recount Certain
In Iowa Election
Over Dry Issue
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DES MOINES, Oct. 16. Unofficial
returns from all but half a ti'ozen
scattered precincts of the state at mid
night tonight indicated that the "drys"
had again assumed the lead in the elec
tion held in the state Monday upon
constitutional prohibition, but the of
ficial count probably will be required
to determine the result The unof
ficial total gives the amendment a lead
of 972 votes, the total vote being
205,9"8 for. and 204,936 against. If
this tabula :ion is correct the few pre
cincts yet to be heard from cannot af
fect the final result.
Neither "w ets" nor "drys" are claim
ing the victory.
DES MOINES, Oct. 16; Indications
are that the official count will be re
quired to determine the result of Mon
day's prohibition election in Iowa. All
day today the "wets" gained on the
lead of the "drys" and tonight with
three counties, Adair, Butler and Fre
mont and 21 scattering precincts in
other counties remaining to be heard
from, the returns showed a majority
against the amendment of 956, the vote
being 196,341 for to 197,297 against.
What It Means.
Should the amendment bo carried
the sale and manufacture of liiiuor
would be prohibited by the constitu
tion and it would be impossible for the
stateto again vote on the question un
til 1821 and (hen Vmly through the elec
tion of two consecutive legislatures
which would vote to resubmit the
amendment. On the other baud a wet
victory will not mean the immediate
legal sale of liquor in the state for the
statulory provision under which the
state has been dry two years, must be
repealed. This would not be possible
until the next legislature convenes two
lyeurs hence.
SAILOR'S BODY FOUND.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Oct. 16 The body of
a sailor said to have been killed ui an
explosion on board a I ni eil states pa
trol boat cruising In Long Island
Sound, was taken to an undertaking
establishment at Babylon t'jday. An
other sailor, severely burned was tak
en to a Babylon hospital. No informa
tion concerning the reported explo
sion was ob -aiiiable.
County Recorder Ray B. Krehs,
also clerk of exemption board for
Cochise county, returned home Sat
urday night on the Golden State Lim
ited from Camp Funston, Kansas,
where he went to accompany the last
contingent of drafted men who left
Douglas on the 3rd.
Mr. Krebs spent several days at
the camp, having gone there for the
purpose of looking pvefr the camp
and is high in his praise for the man
ner in which the government is con
ducting the little city.
Almost the first boys he met there
were Cochise boys and when the train
arrived at the camp drill was in prog
ress but as soon as the Cochise county
boys saw who had arrived they broke
ranks and ran to greet him and the
next contingent. This is a serious
breach of military etipuette, but evi
dently the boys did not think, being
so overjoyed to see some one from
home. They were severely reprimand
ed by the colonel in charge, although
Mr. Krebs explained the matter to
the colonel, who understood the situa
tion, but cautioned against a repetition.
Many of the Cochise county drafted
men, states Mr. Krebs, especially
those who left with the first con
tingents, are all now non-commission
ed officers, mostly lieutenants, draw
ing from $100 to $140 per month, and
the first four barracks he visited were
officered by Cochise county men, he
states. All the men are in splendid
trim and full of pep and take to their
work with a vim, says Mr. Kreb.?,
and many of the boys who were
stoop shouldered and had a slouch
walk already have the military ap
pearance and are straight and up
right, and change tso much their
own people would naraiy recognize
them, he says. The food is of the
best, although plain, and the only
kick the men have is that butter is
not served, and the last thing many
of the local boys told him is to "be
sure and tell the folks at home to
include some butter in our Christmas
boxes."'
Mr. Krebs was shown over the en
tire camp which in the course of two
months has sprung up almost like
magic and what was prairie is now
a thriving city of 50,000 souls ana
more barracks being erected every
day to accommodate more. The
streets are paved, and everything
modern Is installed, including sewer
age system, fire departments and all
that goes In the makeup of a modern,
healthy city. And the best part of
it. he says, is that the drafted men
like it, and are making excellent sol
diers. He says that the colonel told
him that the drafted men will make
far better soldiers than the regulars
for the reason that the regulars go
into the army with a feeling that they
already know it all and do not take
the interest the drafted men' do. The
drafted men, on the other hand, go
into the service with the "Don't know
anything" feeling and therefore take
aptly to their duties and instructions
with the result that they will be first
class soldiers in two months' train
ing. All the local boys were sorry to see
Mr. Krebs leave when he did and
were proftfse in their wishes that he
see the home folks and tell them how
they were getting along, and not
to forget to write and send the papers
and the home news, for after the day's
work is done the boys delight to lie
in their beds, weary though they are,
and see what the "folks at home" are
doing.
Mostly all the Cochise boys have
chosen the field artillery branch of
the service, while others have been j
placed in the headquarters company,
supply company, etc., and the boysj
are not so divided as has been re-j
ported.
It is probable, according to reports j
from Phoenix, although not official, j
that the next Cochise county conting
ent will leave about November 1st,;
which will complete the first quota,
under the draft law. ,

GAMP FUNSTON BOYS

BUYING in, BONDS
Big Camp of National Army
Soldiers Is Setting Out to
Raise Great Amount ' for
the Second Liberty Loan.
(By Review Leased Wire).
CAMP FUNSTON. Kan.. Oct. 13.
Liberty bond for each soldier ol the
40,000 men at Camp Funston, national
army cantonment, is the goal sought
by Maj. Levi G. Brown, in charge of
the sale of the second bond Issue at
the cantonment. The campaign is be
ing pushed energetically, for its suc
cess will mean that $4,000,000 from J
this camp will go into the fight for I
democracy.
All company commanders are so
liciting subscriptions in their respect
ive units, and in many of these pri
vates have been detailed as salesmen
to work among their comrades, ex
plaining to them the merit of the
bonds. The bond "salesmen" of the
356i h infantry in particular are classi
fying as energetic subscription get
ters. They are wrising convincing ar
guments and posting them on the bul
letin boards of the various regimental
buildings where they will be read by
all of the men.
In order to facilitate the purchase
of bonds on the installment plan, two
banks of the national reserve of Kan
sas City and the Central National
Bank of Junction City nave establish
ed branches on the parade grounds at
the cantonment. They charge only
the amount of interest that the bonds
bear, all clerical and other expense
being born by the banks themselves.
The bond-sellim; plan means an im
mense amount o" work in the pay
master's department, as a portion of
each purchaser's pay will be deducted
monthly until the bonds are pa'd for.
A number of national army men al
rerdy have signed up for bonds in fivp
monthly payments of $20 each out of
tjeir pay of $30 a month.
There is much rivaly among the or
ganizations to see which will pur
chase the' largest amount of bonds.
This was further stimulated this wee";
when a large number of men were
added to the ammunition train, cut
ting that unit's average of S42.S0 rer
man. The 356th infnntry regiment,
with 2792 men, ranked first this week,
in the toral amount subscribed, with
sn average of $20.20 per man. This
regiment is made up o? Missourians,
including Kansas City. The 3Jth ma
chine gun battalion, South Dakota, av
eraeed $33.90 per man. and the 353d
infantry, including Kansas, $11.10.
Subscriptions at the cantonment al
ready total more than a quarter of a
million dollars.
