LONDON". Oct. 3. Eleven British
merchantmen of more than 1600 tons
each and two vessels under 1600 tons
were sunk by mines or submarines
last week, according to the British ad
miralty statement made public this
evening.
The shipping summary follows:
Arrivals, 2CS0; sailings, 2742.
Eritish merchant vessels sunk by
mines or submarines over 1600 tons,
including two previously, 11; under
1600 tons, 2.
Fishing vessels, none.
British merchant vessels unsuccess
fully attacked, including seven pre
viously, 16.
The foregoing statement of the Brit
ish admiralty again lowers the ag
gregate of merchantmen sunk by
mines or submarines during any week
since Germany began her Intensified
submarine campaign. As against fif
teen vessels sunk the previous week,
which was the low record since Feb
ruary, enly thirteen merchantmen are
shown to have been sent t the bot
tom last week.
Total Shipping Less
LONDON, Oct. 3. The total of all
losses to world's shipping since Gsr
many's ruthless U-boat warfare went
into effect is about two-thirds of those
claimed by the Germans in a state
ment issued September 1. At that time
Germans alleged an average of 900,
000 tons had been sunk monthly for
seven months. The actual totals of
tonnage sunk committed here show
that not during the most successful
month for the U boats April have
the figures reached and such propor
tion, while the August looses dropped
to almost half the April figure.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 3. The gov
ernment is working to develop some
comprehensive system of dealing with
the labor unrest which threatens to
hamper war production. It is con
cerned over the pronounced upward
movement of wages,, disproportionate
for various industries and the diffi
culty of stabilizing conditions without
doing injustice to workers or employ
ers. Nearly all production now is di
rectly or Indirectly necessary for the
prosecution of the war and the out
put of war materials is curtailed by
strikes, extraordinary movement of
workers from one industry to another
or from plant to plant and other un
settled conditions. On the recommen
dations of the commission headed by
Secretary ct Labor Wilson which left
today for the west, will largely de
pend the. government's eventual poli
cy. Meanwhile it is understood the
government's course will be:
Government' Course.
To extend to a number of industries
having war contracts the present sys
tern of wage adjustment boards which
have been created for cantonment con
struction, shipbuilding, longshoremen
work and army and navy clothing pro
ductions. To increase the number of war de

providing that in case of suspension
of work by strike, the secretary of
war shall settle the disputes.

SACRAMENTO, Cal., Oct. 3. De
nunciation of what he termed "the
copper barons of Arizona," and decla
rations that they owned eleven of the
twelve daily papers there and con
trolled the twelfth, were heard today
at the convention here of the Cali
nia State Federation of Labor, when
John I. Donnelly, president of the Ari
zona Federation of Labor, addressed
the delegates. He declared that all
press reports going out of Arizona
practically were dictated by the cop
per kings and that news was garbled.
Whew!
Referring to the recent deportation
of miners, Donnelly said that of the
1200 men rounded up by 3000 armed
men, who. he said, had been equipped
with rifles and ammunition, 35 per
cent were I. W. W.'s and the rest
were peaceful citizens and profes
sional men who had antagonized the
"copper barons."
The so-called Loyalty League of
Arizona, he declared, was formed by
the mine owners to stamp out union
ism and would not stop at murder to
accomplish its purpose.
Not I. W. W. Movement-
The labor movement In Arizona Is
not an I. W. W. movement, but is

inolly declared. He expressed the hope

fect a settlement of labor troubles,

: (By the Associated Press). Among
;the recent exploits by British aviators
i there was one well worth recording
! which was carried out last Wednes
day, a day when several notable en
; counters occurred. An English air
;man, after crossing the lines at an
altitude of 2000 feet, saw an enemy
machine and gave chase, but was
driven back by five German alba
trosses. He returned towards the lines,
and seeing fifteen men on a railway
descended and scattered them with his
machine gun. Nearby he dropped a
bomb on a munition dump surrounded
by soldiers and the dump blew up.
Falls in Lines
Once more he engaged the same en
emy airplane he had attacked before,
but was again driven off by a large
number of German fliers. He dived
to escape from them and in doing so
passed into a heavy artillery barrage.
A shell went through the mechanism,
cutting his elevator controls and one
side of his rudder control. He swung
Howards the ground, but managed to
right his machine by using his en
gine at the last minute, and landed
just behind the British barbed wire.
Disperse 500 Troops
On the same day one British aviator
dispersed 500 German troops with his

Five Minor Political Groups to
Organize Into One Great Party
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Oct. 3. The ground work for the combination of five
minor political groups into an organization that proposes to fight for
the presidency in 1920 was laid tonight after meetings of committees of
the separate organizations today. The coalition is to be drafted tomor
row, delegates said. The name of the proposed new party has not been
decided upon nor has the platform upon wnich it will make its fight.
The prohibitionists and the progressives are among the leaders in
the re-organization scheme. The general conference today was called
to order by Matthew Hale, as chairman of the progressive committee.
The single-tax forces, some socialists and an element of independents
will comprise the five sources of the new party.
Dr. Ira Landrith of Nashville, Tenn., prohibitionist candidate for vice
president in 1916, was chairman of today's conference.
"Unless I am mistaken in the temper of this meeting, no enemy of
the American republic will get any comfort from what this conference
does," said Dr. Landrith.

plies to northern European neutrals.
just announced,
every phase of
was adopted after
its effect was gone
over in conference between American
and the allied statesmen. American
officials, it was learned today, initiat
ed the discussions, and insisted that
the British step be taken to make
sure that there be no nullification of
the purpose of the Uniied States gov
ernment bad in view in putting into
operation its own embargo.
The step indicated that the allies
have united in' a decision that the
neutrals must cut off the shipments of
all supples U Germany.
Neutrals in Hole
The new policy can be accomplished
through rigid embargoes employed by
all the allies. The neutrals cannot
exist without British and American
supplies, and within the next two or
three months all of them are expected
to declare flat embargoes on the ex
port of their commodities to all coun
tries. This will hit England, as well
as Germany, but the British, who can
draw on the United States, are in a
position to do without neutral goods,
while Germany, cut off from the rest
of the world, cannot exist, officials
here say. if neutral aid ceases.
From South America
While American and British embar
goes cut off virtually all supplies to
the European neutrals, there still is
the chance that some goods will reach
them from South America, despite the
British blockade. To meet this situa
tion, the United States and Great -Britain
are prepared to embargo local ship
ments to South America, if necessary,
and are ready to refuse bunker coal
to European neutral vessels that may
attempt to engage in this trade.

Field Marshal Haig Reports
Vicious Attack By Teutons
Which Was Broken Up Be

(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON. Oct 3. An attack by the
Germans this morning between Tower
Hamlets and lOlygon Wood, following
as vigorous ar.iliery fire was repulsed
either by barrage or British infantry,
according to the report from Field
Marshal Haig tonight. All the British
positions remain intact.
The statements tays:
"Shortly before dawn the enemy
heavily bombarded our positions be
tween Tower Hamlets and Polygon
Wood; af.erward .'is infantry attempt
ed to advance. Our artillery opened
vigorously and on the greater part of
the front the assault broke down be
fore reaching our lines.
"In the area immediately north of
the Menin road where a few of the
enemy succeeded in passing through
the barrage, they were completely re
pulsed by our infantry. Our posit fans
are intact.
"Six German machines were brought
down in the air fight and four others
were driven down out of control. Six
of our machines are missing."
Since the middle of last week the
German armies in Flanders daily have
been 'tying to wrest from the British
the territory taken from them in the
recent big offensive of Field-Marshal
Haig.
Tries Again.
As On previous days Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bavaria on Wednesday
unleashed large numbers of his troops
in an attmept to recapture Tcrrian cn
the Ypres sector where the British
are seriously theatening his communi
cation line with Ostend and the sub
marine base at Zeebrug.se. Ever
watchful gunners of Haig again
wrought havoc amoug the attacking
waves and dispersed the Germans with
heavy casualties and retained all their
positions intact.
Pounding Keeps Up.
There still is no indication of the
time set by Field Marshal Haig tor
the renewal of his efforts to press on
toward and cut the Os .end Lille rail-
I way, but he Is steadily keeping up his
poundlug of the German trenches with
his masses of artillery of all calibres.
Reports Differ.
Although the German war office as
serts that in Tuesday's fighting along
the eastern bank of the Meuse, in the
Verdun sector the Gernions captured
a comparatively long line of French,
trenches, the official French communi
cation makes no mention of this and
asserts merely that violent artillery
fighting and spirited patrol engage
ments took place.

Small Shipping Loss.
Great Britain's loss of thirteen mer
chant vessels through attacks by sub
marines and by striking mines last
week was the lowest since Germany
started her intensified submarine war
fare in February.
The embargo placed by Great Brit,
ain on the exportation of all supplies
to Holland and Scandinavia was made
on the insistence of the American gov.
ernment, so that its own embargo
against the neutrals, aiming at the cut

"With unrestricted armaments the na

is the only issue in the difficulty.

its materialization."
Strongly emphasizing the necessity
for naval disarmament on the high
seas, Count Czernin said:
Naval Disarmament.
"I purposely say the high seas, PJr I
do not extend the idea to narrow seas,
and I freely admit that for sea com
munications special rules and regula
tions must obtain. With these factors
made clear, every ground for territor
ial guarantees disapear.. This is the
basic idea of the beautiful and sublime
note which the pope handed to the
whole world. If ttis basis Is accepted
by Vur enemies we can renounce the
enlargement of the Austro-Hunagrtan
monarchy, always provided that the
enemy completely evacuates our terri
tory." Economic Freedom.
Count Czernin came to the final
principles which he said it was neces
sary to observe to insure the free and
pacific development of the world,
namely, economic freedom. He said
economic war must absolutely be elim-
mies have wrought in Galicia, Dukowi- j
na, the Tyi'Jl, the Isonzo, east Prussia, j
in Turkish territories and the German
colonies. Does the entente intend to
compensate us for all this, or is it so
completely mistaken in its judgment
of our nsvcholoev that it hones for a 1
one-sided indemnification?
"8This war will not be decided with
high-flown phrases. First we heard
that eGnnany was tv be annihilated
and Austria-Hungary dismembered.
Then the tone became more reason
able. It was sufficient to reform our
internal conditions. Our enmies ap
pear now to be in the third phase.
They demand neither our life nor our
right to decide our destinies as a ttate;
but they demand more or less large
frontier rectifications.
Peace By Agreement.
"Further phases will follbw, al
though a majority of the population of
all the enmy countries already definite
ly take their stand on the basis of
peace agreement, which we were the
first to propose six months ago and the
fundamental principles of which I have
just s:ated.
"We do not seek strength in big
words, but in our g&rious armies, the
firmness of our alliances, the stead
fastness of our people and the wisdom
of our war aims. We do not demand
a Utopia; We can neither be bent nor
destroyed. Conscious of our p'jwer and
clear as to what we must attain, we go
our ways."
Saying that he had been blamed
both at home and in unfrieudly coun
tries for plain speaking with regard
to the Austro-Hungarian peace terms.
Count Czernin proceeded:
People Approve.
"I withdraw nothing, being convinc
ed that an overwhelming majority of
the people approve my standpoint. In
broad outline our program tor the re
es .ablishment of order in the world
has been laid down i nour reply to the
pope's note. It may not appear to be
conceivable to many people that the
central powers desire to make renun

ment But xhe war has produced new
facts, conditions and conceptions
which have shaken the foundation of
European politics as they previously
have existed.

Wants Permanent Peace
"This new competition which has
forced itself into the world war af
fords the opportunity of not only ac

arbitration, but also of working with
our whole energy towards its realiza

placed on a basis of right, offering a

must offer security against any future
war of revenge. We must bequeath to
our childrens' children as a' legacy
that they will be spared such a ter
rible war as this, and that is only
possible through disarmament and ar
bitration. "It is superfluous to say that dis
armament must never be directed
against particular state or group of
powers, and that it is must comprise

ies of recent years and had long runs
at the New York and Chicago house.-.
But it is a hard play to put on. Re
hearsals are no play time affairs. The
young men and women who are work
ing nightly in the hall over the club
rooms have no easy task ahead and
they are bending every energy to give
a show that will be up to the Elks'
standard.
Miss Melva Palmer, directress of
the play, is a talented and well known
actress. SJie is full of vim and ener
gy and is bending every effort to car
ry the rehearsals forward with the
snap and precision necessary to make
a comedy "go" with the audience. "It
Is too early to make predictions," she
said to The Review man at the re
hearsal last night, "but I am confident
we will have a good show. Many of
the players have been prevented from
attending rehearsals because of pri
vate business, but we are looking for
ward to full attendance the rest of the
week. There is talent in the cast
much above the average. We will
set a date as soon as we get far
enough along with our work to be
sure of what we can do."
This charming young actress will
herself take a leading part in the
play.

Thursday Morning, October 4, 1917. '
For the third consecutive week the British ship losses
from submarines have been below twenty ships. The
U-boat peril has apparently been brought under con'
troL
No news from the western front; no fighting on the
other fronts. It is the lull before the storm. The pub
lic of France and England and America are looking and
hoping for one last and mighty smash before winter
comes.
Frank Walsh's cartoon, "Our Fall Visitor," that ap
peared in The Review last Sunday, attracted much at
tention and admiration. Walsh is a Bisbee miner and is
also the pride of the famcus Brewery Gulch, but no news
paper between New Orleans and Los Angeles has an
artist with as deft and skillful touch as this amateur
who occasionally lays aside his pick and shovel and takes
up the pencil for The Review.
Another batch of Cochise boys left last night to join
the Nationalist army. Smiling and eager, they marched
abroad their train, leaving their work and their business
and their family and friends behind. And with their go
ing come the government men with Liberty Bonds to sell.
This nation is at war and hence the pinch must come to
our ease and our comforts and our pocketbooks and our
selfish and satisfied state. The war is so big that all
must play a part.
The decision of the city council to buy coal in carload
lots and retail it to the citizens of this city will be
greeted with acclamations by every man who has a house
to warm and a liberty bond to buy and the H. C. L to
fight Many other cities besides Bisbee, paying half as
much for their coal are exercised over the prices being
charged this fall. Of course Bisbee expects to pay a
high price for coal because of freight rates, but seven
teen and eighteen dollars a ton is the straw that breaks
the camel's back.
Road commissioners, county commissioners and others
went forth yesterday upon the highways to ascertain the
spot and stretches of road that needed repairing the
most. They could have staid at home and found the
worst spot this side of No Man's Land in Flanders. From
the foot of the Bisbee hill to where 'the macadam begins
in Johnson Addition is undoubtedly the most traveled
and the worst road within the confines of civilization
It is pitted with holes and scarred with craters and ser
rated with ridges until it is one bump-e-ty-bump all the
way. Why this particular piece of road, over which all
the main traffic of the canyon passes every hour of the
day and night, was allowed to get in this condition is
past the average man's power to understand.
Over in the Huachucas, just two hours' ride from Bis
bee, is a spot as fair and fine and great as any between
Maine and San Francisco. K you are tired, or your work
don't go right, or your heart aches or your debts gall
your back, forget about Yelloystone Park and the Pacific
coast and the lights of a city street. Go over to the
Huachucas and sit down by the crystal stream in Ram
sey canyon in the midst of leaf and bloom and your
troubles will vanish and you will be young again. Thirty
five miles from Bisbee Is a nature's beauty spot and play
ground of which any section of America might boast and
outdo the boast. Walk through the blind man's flower
garden and gain patience; sit by the falling waters and
gain wisdom; look up at the cliffs and the pine trees
and grain strength. Y'ou are only two hours from wond
erland, you folks who fret and complain of the monotony
here. The Lord gave us copper with which to make this
the busiest. best town in the southwest. He forgot the
water and trees and grass until the last minute, and
then He set them down in the Huachucas, just thirty
five miles away, so that we would appreciate th'eni all
the more by having to make an effort to go to them be
fore we could enjoy them.
FRANCE'S LOST EAGLE.
(Tucson Citizen).
With the loss of Captain Guynemer, the warrior most
distinguished for individual exploit passes from a screen
crowded with heroes, passes while hardly more than
boy, for this king of the air would not have been 2
years old until Christmas. "
It is certain that this Napoleon of the sky had fifty-
two victories to his credit; perhaps the list was nearer
to sixty. Too, these victories scored according to the al
most grudging standards of the French army. It must
be remembered, when the suggestion is made that Baron
von Richthoffen has credit for as many winnings as
George Guynemer, that the official German method of
scoring Is more elastic than the French. The German
aviator is accredited with a victory when he puts an
aerial foe out of the fighting, even if he has only shot
a bullet into his motor and let him glide to earth. But
the Frenchman must send his victim's plane to destruc
tion and in the sight of two official observers. This
Captain Guynemer did nearly forty times In the last year,
and usually alone. He handled the wheel of his airplane
and its gun. His success as a destroyer was due largely
to his marksmanship, the ability to fire on the instant
he drew bead. It was this wonderful co-ordination of
eye and finger that enabled him to fell three German
fliers in 150 seconds, the greatest military feat ever per
formed In the air, a deed after which, with one plane
wing stripped by a shell, he fell 10,000 feet and yet e3
caped.
Dexterity was not all of the youth's equipment. He had
courage not merely the bravery that all airmen must
have, but the dogged spirit which got him into the army
after he had been rejected several times for lack of
physique. He had the instinct of strategy and used every
form of attack; straight firing at the enemy's level, the
sudden dash from behind the corner of a cloud, the hawk
like swoop in which he sent bullets as be dropped like
a plummet, and the impudent assault just above the Ger
man trenches. With feints and lunges he once drove an
enemy machine to earth inside the French lines when
the German plane had a crew of three men and a gun
while Guynemer was alone and -his gun was jammed and
useless.
To have seen three years of war from the wide blue, to
have done more than any other single soldier to blind
the Hun, to have worn on his breast every medal that
France gives to her brave George Guynemer could have
asked no more except, very likely, to die for his country.
The clouds will miss this D'Artagnan with the face of a
woman and the heart of a Frenchman.
CHANCE TO MAKE SOME MONEY.
(Douglas Dispatch).
It is estimated that there are more than 100 Arizona
slackers. Few of them have been apprehended. There
are some who have been reported erroneously as draft
evaders, but It is believed that there are fully 1,000 men
rambling around somewhere wbo should be. at Fort Riley
as part of this state's quota of drafted men. There la a
reward of $50.00 for these deserters, for that is the
classification they must be given. An announcement
made for the governor by Colonel Breen says that $50.00
will be paid to anyone who delivers to the nearest army
camp a deserter, meaning those who did not heed the
call of the exemption boards. There are hundreds of
young men in the state who will have to go to the train
ing camp unless these slackers are found, and it is to
the interest of the young men concerned to make strenu
ous efforts to help in trailing down deserters.
Those who are instrumental in putting slackers in the
army not only will make $50.00, but will render the coun
try a service as well. They also will make it so that a
number of worthy young men will not be called. The
drive "for Arizona should be relentlessly prosecuted, and
there is every indication that it will be. Arrangements
soon will be made with Mexico whereby all Americans
who go to that country to evade military service will be
extradited and brought back. It Is different from the
cases of those who leave a country to escape military
service in time of peace. Those who have gone to Mexico
should bear in mind that many American soliders who
deserted when placed along the border were returned to
the United States whenever caught in Mexico and that
all drafted men are considered in the ranks of the army.
The statement issued by Colonel Breen in one place
said that "any person who fails to report to his local
board for military service at the time specified in his
order to report, is a deserter." The punishment for de
sertion In time of war is death. Whether this penalty
will be modified in the cases of apprehended slackers
is problematical, but only the president has the authority
to change the ruling of a courtmartial in such a case,
and he Is a busy man.
While the British are not boasting of any victory In
the Ypres salient nor claiming to have broken through
the Hindenburg line, yet they have won an advantage
there in the recent fighting that can scarcely be over
estimated. Just how great this advantage is, let the
German general staff testify. It has sent its best troops
np against these newly won ridges time and time again
to suffer the worst slaughter of the war, and still H
sends them on in counter attacks that are endless. An'!
still the stubborn BritUh troops hold their ground and
mow the Prussian lines like grain before the scythe.
Germany must either drive Haig back or soon suffer aJ
terrihle reverse and lose at least half of her holdings In
France and Belgium. As was the case before Beaujj'iiime
and Peronne on the Somme at this time" last year, the
allied balient bas reached the d.r.igei point for the 1 1 an

Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
MOTORING
I chug along from burg to graJ.
food gasoline a-burning, where roads
are good, where roads are bad, on
highways straight and turning. "Oh,
motoring," I sigh, "is bliss, my good
old car's a treasure; what outdoor
pastime equals this, for pure and last
ing pleasure?" And as I gambol
through the dust, with other autos
racing, my threadbare tires begin to
bust, and spoil both tube and casing.
I toil and labor in the sun until I bust
a gallus, and ere the weary work is
dene I drink from sorrow's chalice.
For changing tire will break thtj
heart and any portly mortal, upset
his mental apple-cart, and kill his
smile and chortle. At last new tires
are on the wheels, and I resume my
spanning; my laughter rings in merry
peals, my smile Is sweet and winning.
Then something breaks about the
torque; no more my car is speeded;
I'll have to send to far New York, to
get the part that's needed. When
fixed, some o'her parts will break,
some bearings, pins or collars, and
when repairs the workmen make,
they'll charge me ninety dollars. And
so I'm walking near and far, on high
ways broad and narrow; I think I'll
dump the motor car, and get myself
a barrow.

ARIZONA SOLDIERS TO
BE HOSTS AT DANCE
TOMORROW EVENING
Members of the "Fighting First"
Arizona Infantry are planning to
prove tomorrow night that they are as
good hosts as they are soldiers, which
will be saying a good deal. The oc
casion will be the farewell dance
given at the post exchange at the
camp at Naco by the members of the
regiment. The last dance given at
the post exchange by the members o
the regiment showed that the boys in
the regiment can dance as well as
they can execute "squads right about."
right front in line" and other move
ments that characterize the daily drill
of the soldier now-a-days.
A. J. Radzwill. who has charge oi
arrangements for the dance, planned
to stage a "long distance" dance af
a special feature of the affair, but
changed his mind when he consider
ed the showings made recently in
regimental hikes by some of the fox
trot experts at the camp.
"A long distance dance would be al!
right," said Radzwill last night, "but
for the fact that the regiment may be
ordered away within the next few
months and we wouldn't get a chance
to finish the contest."
However, Radzwell has arranged
for a prize waltz and many of the
boys at the camp have their minds so
concentrated on the coming event that
they get "double time" mixed with
waltz time." At least, that is what
some of their rivals declare.
The regiment extends a cordial in
vitation to all of its friends in this
part of the state to attend the fare
well dance tomorrow . evening and
promises that everyone will have a
time that will not be soon forgotten.

the roadrunner is a menace to quail,
and his attention has been called to
the need for changing the game law
so that this menace will be removed.
.Some time ago the-Mohave County
Miner, in an editorial, declared that
roadrunners destroy quail by the thou
sands. The matter was referred to a
governmental bureau having in charge
the protection of game, and one of
the experts said that it had been
found by tests in California that the
roadrunners were a protection to the
farmers in that they destroyed certain
pests and insects.

though no official notification had
been made that the boys were going,
the word "leaked out," and there was
a big crowd at the depot to bid them
good bye. There was a great ovation
as the train pulled out, and there were

a renewal of heavy liquidation and
the bear pressure, directed principally
against Bethlehem Steel. Various ru

the effect that Kerensky's plans were
voted down had a tendency to cause
renewal of concern. Now that the
tax bill is out of the way the man
ner in which corporations will finance
themselves, in order to provide for
the huge afflux of cash later on, is
beginning to be discussed.
Corporate financing is now being at
tended with many difficulties, which
condition will probably be further agi
tated if the war should continue for
a protracted period. Therefore, it is
not unlikely that the bulk of corpora
tions will find it necessary in the
raising of funds to alter disbursements
and reduce inventories . While it is,
of course, too early to tell how these
problems will be solved, still there is
little question but that corporate man
agers will in any case be confronted
with very serious problems. From the
viewpoint of actual worth, securities
are cheap, but the investment demand
for same at present is not of suffi
cient extent to overshadow the vol
ume of liquidating 'and speculative
sales. LOGAN & BRYAN.
