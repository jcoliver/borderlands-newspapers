Given Food and Lodging Free, Russian Put on Stand By the
Prosecution Says He Would Be Willing to "Stay Forever"

Beyond Fact That Cunningham Was "Walking Around" on
Deportation Day; Hearing of County Engineer Ryan Today
(Special to The Review)
DOUGLAS. Ariz.. July 23. Novel
views on methods for the adjustment
of the labor situation throughout the
nation, propounded by witnesses for
the tate, featured the preliminary
hearings in this city today of "Mike"
Cunningham, prominent Bisbee bank
er; Jim Boyd, shift boss, and Fred
Sandtner, mine foreman, charged with
kidnaping as the result of the I. V.
W deportations two years ago.
The hearing of Cunningham, held
this morning, was expected to prove
one of the most interesting of those
held thus far, but except for the tes
timony of George Wiercinski, one of
the deportees, differed but little from
preyious hearings.
Frequently Discharged, Taken Back
Wiercinski, a native of Russia, tes
tified that on July 12, 1917, the day
of the deportations, he had seen Cun
ningham in an auto with several other
armed men and that the banker said
nothing to him. Testimony of Wier
cinski showed that he had worked in
practically every mine in the Warren
District and had been discharged
"about a thousand times," as he put

Cunningham for 15 or 20 years, and
that he saw Cunningham "taking some
men to the depot" on the day of the
deportation and again that day at the
ball park at Warren, where the de
portees were assembled and question
ed before being put on the train. Here
he said, he heard Cuningham tell a
man to "get into line." On cross-examination,
the witness said that he
was not certain that Cunningham was
taking the men to the depot when he
saw him that morning, that the de
fendant had not touched, handled or
spoken to any of the four or five men
under arrest, but that, as the banker
was walking near the bunch of men
with a gun, he, Chase, assumed that he
was one of the men who had taken them
in charge. He admitted that there
was nothing in Cunningham's conduct
to indicate. that he was doing anything
but walking around.
Defendant Merely "Walking Around
Mrs. Barcellino, who said she bad
known Cunningham by sight in Bis

she saw the defendant near the Bis

City Club-Planned.
By Men of Douglas
DOUGLAS, July 22. When several
citizens were discussing the matter
of a city club for Douglas yesterday
afternoon. Frank H. Fisher, of the
Bank of Douglas, outlined a tenta
tive plan which he believes would
result in a successful club of the kind
here.
The idea of Mr. Fisher Is to pro
vide in connection with the club
rooms, library, ball room, dining
room, etc., a number of rooms which
would be attractive to some of the
bachelors in the city, and also to a
good many who are called here fre
quently in connection with niining
enterprises. He thinks that 25 or 30
such rooms, well .furnished, would
bring a sufficient revenue to carry
the rental cost of the club, leaving
the fixed charges of operating the
club to be met by the monthly dues
of Its members.

INTERVENTION
DISCUSSED I N
MEXICO PRESS
Rumors Disturb Journalists in
Mexico City; No Officials
Of Carranza Gov't Take Part
In Discussion; Quotes Wood
MEXICO CITY. July 23. (By As
sociated Press). The constantly in
creasing space devoted by Mexican
newspapers during the last few
weeks to the relations between the
U. S. and Mexico culminated today
in the issue of an extra edition by
El Universal carrying the seven col
umn headline, "Mexico and the Unit
ed States." .
Underneath is another seven col
umn headline in smaller type saying,
"United States Press Affirms Prep
arations Continue for Armed Inter
vention." The body of the reading matter
contains summaries of stories, most
of them taken from New York pa
pers and sent by special correspond
ents, or clipping bureaus, regarding
recent incidents in Mexico
.
Other storieB tell of anti-Mexican
cartoons aoDearincr in Ameri nan n a
pers and of declarations with, regard
to Mexico by Under Secretary of
State Polk and Major General Leon
ard Wood. Part of the extra is given
over to a story printed in the New
York World discounting the inter
vention stories.
Mention is made of a recent report
published here that officers of the
American Army of Occupation - in
Germany are busily studying a cam
paign ror an invasion of Mexico.
Side by side with the Intervention
stories from the United States are
news reports, editorials and inter
views with government officials re
garding the Cheyenne incident in
volving Americans.
The newspapers of the capital have
been publishing' statements by va
rious ' persons, notably Yrnacio Bo-
nillas. Ambassador to . the United
States, and General Candido Aguilar,
former foreign minster, dealing with
the present cordial relation between
the United' States and Mexico and
Mexico's anxiety to enact legislation,
especially regarding oil claims, that
will satisfy all parties.
Although a great volume of matter
has been printed regarding inci
dents which mav affect the nresent
internation relations, none have been
by government officials whose post
Hons are" high enough to give their
statement authority.
President Carranza's authorized
statement to the Associated Press af
ter the crossing of the frontier re
cently at Juarez by American troops,
has been the only official statement
from him.
General Juan Barraggan, chief of
staff, is quoted today' by the "Excel
sior" as saying that the government
ordered a strict investigation of re
cent incidents of the Tampico re
gion and the proper punishment of
those guilty of these offenses. ,
In the story containing this inten
view the newspaper adds that for
eigners have been presuming too
much on the immunity they believed
was due to aliens and venturing into
rebel territory, thereby adding to the
difficulties of the .government and
military commanders in the disturbed
zones.
An unnamed government official
also is quoted as declaring that the
Cheyenne incident .lacks importance;
that it cannot, be; compared with the
Dolphin incident at Tampico in 1914,
which resulted in the landing of
Americnf forces at Vera Cruz.
The general sentiment here as re
flcted by the newspapers shows much
concern over the present status of
international relations and, also the
outcome of conferences at' Washing
ton on the Mexico policy, and the
course the Mexican . congress . will
pursue with regard to oil.

COMPROMISt I LAN IS OFFERED BY
TAFTTO GET LEAGUE OF NATIONS
PAST INSURGENT C D P SENATORS
Former President, in Letter to National Chairman Will
Hays, Suggests Six "Interpretation" Reservations to Pact,
Safeguarding the Monroe Doctrine and General Powers of
U. S. Soverignty; Wilson's Endorsement is Expected;
i Senator Lodge Declines to Comment on Taft Proposal
(By the Associated Press)
WASHINGTON. July 23. A plan
for securing senate acceptance of the
League of Nations through interpre
tative reservations, has been suggest
ed by former President Taft in the
hope of uniting on a middle ground
enough Democratic and Republican
senators to defeat any radical amend
ment of the covenant and in the end
obtain its ratification.
The suggestion has been received
with earnest consideration bv the
group of Republicans who favor the
league idea,. and who already are at
work on a definite program of inter
pretative reservations which thev
clare they have reason to believe will
be accepted by the administration.
The administration leaders, however.
are unwilling to concede that any res
ervations would be necessary, and still
Insist they will have the votes when
tne time comes.
So confident are the league sun-
porters of success of their nlan that
some of them believe Presideut Wil
son will publicly accept it to smooth
the way for acceptance of the league.
Some Republican senators whn hv
seen the president in the last few
aays nave come away from the White
House with the impression that Mr.
Wilson, whole not encouraeine- respr-
vations, if they can be avoided, might
not te averse to such interpretations
as would leave the league fabric un
impaired. Mr. Taft's suggestion, which created
a sensation in the senate because of
his known advocacy of unreserved
ratification, was embodied in two let
ters to Will Hays, the Republican Na
tional cnairman. They touched upon
many features of the treaty.
Six specific interpretation nrnnosala
are outlined, which Mr. Taft says he
is convinced will meet the objections
of a large number of Republicans, who
favor the league. He counts 45 Dem
ocratic senators as supportins: the
president in the treaty fight, and says
and says that should three Republi
cans be committed to vote against ma
terial amendments no such proposal
could receive a senate majority.
The former president suggested to
Mr. Hays that his name be withheld
for the present form with the intre
pretation plan, as it might antagonize
some senators of his party. Chairman
Lodge of the foreign relations com

Mr. Taft also has written some of
the Republican senators, who, under
the leadership of Senator McCumber
of North Dakota and McNary of Ore

ing a middle course for solution of the
senate situation. It is understood that
Senators Kellogg, Minnesota, Colt,
Rhode Island, and Spencer, Missouri,
also have been consulted in the in
terests of such a plan.
The Taft letter subbests six "inter
pretations" covering the right of with

dominions and colonies, assertong the
prerogative of congress to declare war
under article ten, confirming national
control over domestic issues, defining
the Monroe Doctrine and reserving
the right to terminate obligations un

Mr. Taft wrote that these interpret

covenant, but would, he believed, as

Agriculture Bill
Passed by Senate
WASHINGTON. July 23. The sen.
ate late today passed the $34,000,000
agricultural appropriation bill which
recently was vetoed by President
Wilson because of the rider for re
peal of the daylight saving law. No
effort to restore the rider was made
in the senate. Senators made no
eriticis'ii of the president's veto. The
bill will be retuvr.ed to the house
tomorrow. '
Because of the universal desire to
provide funds in the bill for the de

was brief.
Western senators particularly urg

the accounts of the trial In the news
papers because there were only a few
things in the newspapers that he be
lieved anyhow, and he was not certain
as to how the trials had come out.
McCarthy said he had read 'copies
of "Solidarity." and other . I. W. W.
literature and that he believed there
was nothing In common between labor
and capital. When asked by Attorney
Frank Curley, for the defense, If he
favored abolition of the wage system,
the witness said he had not yet made
up his mind on that subject.
Wanted Strike for 2-Hour Day
He stated that he had attended
numerous meetings held in Bisbee
during the period of the strike and
had heard a man named Clark, one
of the strike organizers, speak. He
said Clark urged the miners to strike
for six hours first, then for four hours
and then for two hours. On this, he
testified, he did not agree with Clark,
as he thought it would be best to save
trouble and strike for a two-hour day
from the start.
He said he used to be a friend of
Boyd's but since the deportations his
feelings had slightly changed.
"You feel ratner vindictive towards
him now?" asked Curley.
"Yes," replied McCarthy.
Would Stop Copper Production
McCarthy was questioned as to his
knowledge of the copper situation at
the time of the strike, and testified
that he believed that If necessary to
win the I. W. W strike. It should have
been continued even though the pro
duction of copper was stopped. It
was his opinion that violence had been
used against the strikers by the de
portations, he said, and he believed '
that they organized to "meet violence
with violence."
Steve Swedish, who said that bis
principal occupation since 1905 had
been that of a bartender, and Attor
ney Burgess Indulged in a lively argu
ment when Swedish, after stating that
he had worked as a miner for two
years between 1905 and 1915, failed
to remember just where he had work
ed for most of that period and ob
jected vigorously to attempts by the
defense to bring out more clearhy as
to who has been his employers during
the two years. He said that he had
not exactly gone on strike in 1917,
but when he awakened on June 27 and
heard that the I. W. W had declared
a strike he went back to his room
instead of going to the mines.
Deporter Gives Deportee Money
Cross-examination by the defense
brought out the admission from Swed
ish that at the ball park, Fred Ritter.
one of the alleged deporters, offered
to take him out of "the line." Swedish
said he refused the offer, whereupon
Ritter gave him all the money that
Ritter had. Swedish said his brother
had been put on the train, and for
that reason he had refused to take
advantage oi Kitter s oner. He re
fused to admit on the stand, however,
that he went willingly, saying that as
he had been taken from his room and
marched to Warren with the deported
men he was "sore" and would not get
out of the line at Ritter's suggestion.
Swedish testified that Boyd was at
the ball park with a gun, but had said
nothing to him and taken no part,
other than mingle with the armed
guards, during the deportation.
Richard Deming, Dave McGivern
and 3. F. Hollman, all deportees, also
testified to having seen Boyd with a
gun at the ball park and In LowelL
They, too stated, that Boyd had saia
nothing to them, nor had they heard
him address any of the deported men.
Struck After 21 Days' Work
The hearing of Fred Sandtner. sec
ond foreman at' the Junction mine,
followed and brought out some inter
esting aspects on the labor question in
the testimony of Clifford Linn, one of
the deportees. After discussing his
employment in a score of mines in
Utah, Nevada, Idaho and Arizona,
Linn said he had gone out on strike
in Bisbee after working there for only
21 days. He stated that he had joined
the I. W. W. in 1917. and was still an ac
tive member, but had never acted as
an organizer or delegate. Linn declar
ed that he had joined the I. W. W.
because he believed, and still held the
opinion that it was the only labor or
ganization worth joining and express
ed belief In many, but not all, of Its

doctrines.. He declared that at the
time of the strike he was In favor of
the men staying out, because he
thought this would force the mines to
close down and he hoped the govern
ment would take them over. The I
W. W. method of "striking on the job"
met with his approval, said Linn. The
witness said that after the deportation
he had tried employment in other Ari
eona mines, but was discharged be
cause he was told he was not doing
enough work. Asked if he had
"struck on the job," he replied that
he hadn't, but thought it was a good
plan and that every man should be
judge how much work he had done.
Linn was in favor of a flat scale of
$6 a day for miners, as against the
sliding scale, regardless of whether or
not the price of copper was ten cents
or thirty, cents. . .

Bisbee Petition Is
Circulated to Take
Tax off Soft Drinks
The local soda emporiums are try
ing to get up a large petition to con
gress to eliminate the tax on this
line of merchandise. A multitude of
people all over the country are an
noyed by the 10 per cent federal tax
01 soft drinks and on ice cream sold
at the counter, those behind the pe
tition say. While it is true that the
tax amounts to a few pennies, yet
to those of limited means, who want
to indulge in these mild luxuries, the
addition of these pennies to the cost
works a hardship, the merchants
say.
It would be more equitable, they
contend, to let the popular delicacies
go free of taxes, and, to make up
for loss of revenue from them by an
increased tax on real luxuries ex
pensive things which can better be
dispensed with. Those who can af
ford to indulge in expensive luxuries
far better can afford to pay a war
tax, even though at a stiff rate, than
those who are called upon to pay a
penny or more tax on soda fountain
beverages, is the argument of the
men circulating the petition.

SCHOOL TEACHERS.
T 1 I- TnCT iioafnl rtiiHliv oarvlcii i 6 tfio nt tYa eotirnl tonphof
TThat we as a public do not appreciate this is proven by
the fact that we are under-paying them.
In many quarters we have allowed our public funds to
become of such low estate that 'teachers have gone for months with
out any pay at all.
There is not a private business or institution of any sort that
does not regard the meeting of its payroll as its first and most sacred
obligation.
Many of the best of teachers are being forced out' of the school
through our failure to meet the economic inducements of other trades
and professions.
Recruits to the teaching profession are becoming alarmingly few.
It is all well enough for us to talk of new and improved methods
and reforms in our educational system, but the whole system, like
in other institutions, is dependent upon the brains and personalities
of those w ho comprise their human organizations.
Our first duty to our educational system is to keep what we now
have keep it py retaining the brains and personality of those who
now comprise it, and by raising their pay. r
And by this same act we will be recruiting more brains and per
sonalities to enter the professions for future service and a better
system.
It naay sound paradoxical, but the pay of teachers is one service
in which we can afford extravagance.
The more the pay the more brains will be retained and recruited
into the profession.
The more pay, the more the teacher can afford upon hi3 or her
training as a teacher.
Let us make education our national extravagance!
It i3 the one place where extravagance will be an investment.
All reforms begin with education.
The school teacher is the true, the basic reformer, and we cannot
overpay the school teacher, as a profession, as an institution.
It requires no imagination to see the economic wisdom of in
vestment in public education, though the returns' are not immediate
they ccme with the maturity of tho ghild, when it takes its place
in full citizenship, but the returns are large, permanent and certain.
ALL WEALTH NOT DISHONEST.
VERY INSTITUTION' which limits supply and unjustly levies
tribute from the petiple should be taxed to death or con-
fucated for the general weal, and failing in this, then the
people should destroy it by force, tho same as they would
kill a rattlesnake crawling its slimy length across their path.
If great magnates of trusts, corporations and pools shall ac
cumulate hundreds of millions by methods of bribery, corruptly cre
ating monopolies upon necessities wnieh bleed a helpless people of
paper, published at Paris by, for and through the personnel of the
to pay such tax as would prohibit his method and reduce his ill-gotten
millions to st least thousands, and in the same proportion that he ,is
taxed the burden be lifted from the backs of- those whom he has
robbed. And if his great wealth of gold shall prevent courts and
law-makers from giving proper relief to those oppressed by him,
then it is right and just that they treat him exactly as they treat the
other kind of thief the one who enters their homes and robs them
of whatever of value he can find.
There is no poor man's home in all this broad land where cold
storage pirates and other public plunderers do not enter and steal
a portion of the sweat and blood earned wage, and they are as much
burglars as the low-browed brutes whose methods differ only in that
they necessitate skeleton keys, jimmies and dark lanterns. Exter
minate them like you would body lice, and, as Patrick Henry op
somebody has before remarked: "If this be treason, make the most
of it."
But there are de'grees in everything, and it makes a great dif
ference how a man came by his wealth. He may live in a mansion
and wear diamonds and have a perfect legal and moral right to it all.
Let us, then, be manly and generous enough to rejoice that such a
man can be happy and prosperous, even if we can not.
TAPS AND "THIRTY."
UK STARS AND STRIPES, that bright and breezy newspaper
I which waved for all the members of the American expedi
I 1 tionary force and for all in this country interested in that
crusading body, has sung its swan song. This unusual news
paper, published at Paris by, for and througfih the personnel of the
American army, has marked "thirty" as the end of the copy. It goes
down into history as a unique contribution to our fighting of the war.
The Stars and Stripes made no pretensions to having won the
war. It tried to keep the interests of jealous fighting divisions and
quarreling branches of the service at one with each other in hours
of need.. Where it was read it always interested and never failed
to amuse, and, therefore, it was a real factor in upholding morale.
Contributing to its well-written columns were men from every rank
and file of the army, and their writings were characteristic of that
strange combination of earnestness and nonchalance which marked
the career of our men in Franco. And last, but by no means least,
it made money for Uncle Sam something which none of its edutors
in their widest dreams of success even believed possible.
FOOD FOR THOUGHT.
WE TAIL to understand just why Cochise County has opened
again the Risbee deportation cases. There is no de
mand for the cast; by either state or federal govern
ment. It looks to an outsider as though the prosecuting
attorney is making that fight with the idea of surrounding himself
with the friendship of the I. W. W.'s and their friends. IT the tax
payer and law abiding citizen of Cochise county has demanded those
prosecutions, all well and good, but if such prosecutions are promoted
by chcp politics and a desire to re-infest Cochise with a hoard of
I. W. W'.'s and other undesirables it is high time for Cochise to clean
house. The law of the land properly applied will no doubt prove
wholesome. Arizona Gazette.
The big city papers tell of a woman wearing twelve diamond
rings on one hand. She ought to wear a band around her head, also,
to keep 'the craek from w idening. . .
We object to any fellow hanging over our desks and explaining
what the country needs when what he needs himself is a bath and
a disinfectant for the breath.
When Heinie gels into the markets he will doubtless think the
price of thiu.?.. a fc!; ay of getting part of the indemnity.

washed out a week or so ago.
Owing to the fact that the repairs

CUSPIDORS FLY IN COURT
ROOM LIKE BULLETS FROM
GUN; NO ONE IS HURT.
TUCSON, July 23. C. C. Lee, a
negro, yesterday afternoon mistook
Justice Pease's court room for a
booth at the country fair where the
familiar sound of "one down one
cigar" can be heard. Instead of base
balls, however, Lee used court house
cuspidors and the evasive doll which
none could hit in this instance proved
to be Monroe Cottrell, Lee's former
friend.
i Cottrell had Lee arrested and the
hearing to put him under a peace
bond was about to take place., Lee
engaged Cottrell in conversation
when suddenly Lee lost his temper
and cuspidors began to aviate about
the courtroom. Lee was taken to
jail and in a little while brought
back into the courtroom where he
was notified that he was in contempt,
that the penalty would be announced
later, and in the meantime he will
be given a hearing on the peace bond
today.
ANDY MARTIN MEMBER OF
NEW RESOURCES BOARD.
PHOENIX, July 22. Plans for a
comprehensive survey of Arizona
which will' take up the reclamation,
mineral, oil and water development
of the state as well as a thorough
investigation of its other natural
tesources, will be discussed here July
29. This is the date fixed for the
organization meeting of the Arizona
resources board, the personnel cf
which was announced as follows:
Jos. H. Kibbey, Thoenix; F. L.
Ewing, Yuma; J. It. Walker, Safford;
John R. Hulet. Holbrook, and Andrew
I'. Martin, Tucson.
The selection of this board has been
delayed, it is understood, through the
desire cf the governor to pick repre
sentative men from each of the ini
porant interests of the state. Both
the livestock and the agricultural
interests are represented as well
as service men, the latter being rep
resented by Martin.
The creation of the resources board
is provided for in a bill enacted by
the last legislature. No salaries are
allowed except per diem and expenses.
The appointment of a secretary
will come up at an early date.

COLONEL GREEN WAY
SAYS SENATORIAL
STORY UNAUTHORIZED.
TUCSON, July 23. Colonel John
C. Greenway left Monday afternoon
for Ajo, after attending the meeting
oi tne Arizona chanter of the AmeH
can Mining congress. It was his first
meeting since he returned from
France.
Asked about the reDort from Done-
las that his hat was in the senatorial
ring. Colonel Greenway said that the
report was unauthorized, but left the
impression that he would not refuse
to make the race if the people want
ed him.
At Tucson Colonel Greenway was
met by Ben Daniels, who served with
him in the Spanish war. All of his
old friends are anxious to have hint
get into the senatorial game.
Colonel Greenway has not resumed
his connection with the Calumet and
Arizona and New Cornelia, which he
left to join the colors. He is much
interested in the proposition to put
through a railroad from Tucson to
the gulf. He holds the Mexican con
cessions necessary for the road and
the rights in the gap in the Growlers,
through which it must pass.
Colonel Greenway is very much
interested in the national political
situation. He is a strong supporter
of Leonard Wood, with whom he also
served in the Rough Riders.

FAMILIAR STUFF
New York Tribune:
The warmest admirer of Senator
Swanson of Virginia will hardly con
tend that he added much to the en
lightenment of America and the
world by the three hours of discourse
he unloaded on the senate. The
track that he trotted has many foot
prints; the cart he dragged is loaded
with familiar stuff.
A DEMOLISHED ARGUMENT
New York Herald:
The fact seems to liave escaped
those fervid partisans who are hurl
ing epithets at critics of the cove
nant of the League of Nation, but
nevertheless It is a fact that the an
nouncement of resumption of busi
ness with Germany completely de
stroys the partisan contention that in
holding up ratification of the peace
treaty until they, can be sure, of what
it means senators are reopening war
or delaying the arrval of peace.

The increase amounts to 60 and 75

conservative withal. They point out
that while the surface indications ap
pear most favorable, yet the present
bulge in the price of the metal is not
coming from the source that should
make for a permanent higher level.
The disturbing element in the cop
per situation continues to be the im
mense surplus of copper that Ameri
can copper producers have on hand.
On the first of the year this amount
ed to 1,250,000,000 pounds. This fig
ure is in addition to the copper that
has been mined and smelted since
that time, less the copper sold.
As soon, as the former central Euro
pean empires, which have been de
nuded of the red metal for four years
and more, establish their credits
there appears to be little question,
in the minds of the copper producers,
as to the future of the industry. It
appears to be only a matter of wait
ing until that time arrives.
The producers discussed the gen,
eral situation in Arizona and in the
Southwest, where it affects the min
ing industry. Secveral of the con

. PHOENIX. July 22. When Julian
Hernandez, charged with assault
with intent to commit murder, was
asked to sit down us his trial was
called in Judge Stanford's court this
morning, he refused and the court or
dered the sheriff to make him sit
down. Deputy Sheriff Ernest Smith

of Gila Rend answered for the sheriff.
Smith reached Hernandez first and
they rolled on the floor in what ap
peared a death struggle fight. O'Neil,
who had been silting farther away,
rushed into the shuffle and separated
Smith from Hernandez and dragged
Herna'idez to a seat beside W. T.
Sprowls, Hernandez' attorney. Her
nandez struggled and fought hut was
finally forced down into the seat and
held there by Smith.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 23. Develop
ments were helpful to further sub
stantial advance on quoted values on
the stock exchange today, the move
ment as a whole constituting another
retreat of the short interest.
The optimistic views of industrial
executives respecting threatened la
bor disturbances, news that Mexico
will permit oil boring, greater stabil
ity of sterling exchange and continued
relaxation of calls were effective in
overcoming bearish aggressions.
Steels and oils advanced 1 to 4
points.
From these groups advances soon
switched to numerous other issues,
particularly motors and their subsi
diaries. Metals were intermittently active at
moderate gains, but yesterday broad
demand for transportations was not
resumed, even the low grade rails
lagging, with the exception of Texas
and Pacific, Denver and Rio Grande
preferred and St Paul preferred.
Outstanding features of the day
were Stromberg carburetor and Loril

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 23. After Jumping
to the highest prices yet for Decem
ber delivery, the corn market today
re acted under heavy profit taking
sales by holders. The bulge was due
in the main to overtopping of all pre
vious hog values, and to dry, hot
weather that tended to increase fear
of crop damage.
Nervousness prevailed at the close,
which ranged from a quarter cen net
decline to a quarter cent advance,
with September $1.94 to $1.94 and
December $1.66 to $1.66. Oats
finished 1 to c down. In provi
sions the outcome varied from un
changed figures to 37 cents higher.
Unloading on the advance in the
corn market came chiefly from longs,
who believed the technical position
had been weakened by the 10 cent rise
which had taken place in the Decem
ber option since Saturday. Heading
of the new crop did much to weight
down the oats market
there was any talk of

HALF YEAH III
COPPER HHHKET
IS
Period of Sharp Curtailment
Tided Over, Second Half of
1919 to See Big Turnabout
In the Copper Situation
BOSTON. July 23. The first half
of the year 1919 will go down on re
cord as a memorable one in the cop
per metal situation, witnessing as it
did a period of drastic curtailment in
production as well as weeks when
copper was a drug on the market,
with the surplus accumulating at
rapid rate.
According to present indications
the second half year of 1919 should
witness remarkable turn-about to
the copper situation. While produc
tion as yet has not been increased,
copper metal prices have shown a
sharp rebound upward, wmch will
mean the cleaning up of the large
surplus and the resumption of oper
ations to normal by most mining
companies before many weeks have
passed.
It is probably not generally realiz
ed the extent to which the prominent
copper mining companies curtailed
their production during the past half
year, which covered substantially
the period during wliich the involun
tarv curtailment plan was in effect.
In the case of 23 prominent produc
ers, 294,971,629 pounds, or 37 per cent
less copper was out putted during the
six months ended June 30, 1919, than
during the corresponding period of
last year. "What the current six
1 months Droduction will show over
I
j9i : me last nan 01 iiio is pruuieiHiiiicai,
47 I but judging from recent develop
k ments all hands point to an increase
s ' rather than a decrease.
s j Anaconda during the first six
01' ! months of this year turned out 50
j per cent less copper than during the
I conesiiuimiug
period of 1918, while
1 in
the case of Phelps Dodge the de
crease amounted to 52 per cent. Utah
Copper showed a drop of 39 per cent.
Those three properties are the larg
est producers of the red metal in the
United States.
Everything in printing, quality
work, lowest prices, done in the only
modernly equipped plant in Cochise
county.

American Legion
Brings Fight For
Democracy to U.S.
Americans who took arms to mak'-
the world safe for democracy will, or
course, form an association. Given
a large number of men with thai
great common experience such ai
association is fairly inevitable in so
ciable America. It is fitting and ad
mirable, says the Saturday Evening
Post.
We hear considerable discussion
as to what sort of association it wi:i
turn out to be in actual practice, witn
what aims ajid what effect upon na
tional nie and wnetner it win d
purely social, or take on some polit
ical couipkxion and be an object of
lively political intrigue, or perhaps
devote its attention mainly to self-
interests.
What called these men together
was a unique service to the country
and a unjque sacrifice for the causo
of democracy throughout the worla.
We would say that motive might
well be the guiding principle of the
association. ' Democracy nowhere is
made safe simply by fighting for tr
with arms in a great crisis. There
are plenty of enemies that wear no
Prussian helmets.
That democracy shall be kept safe
and effective; that the will of the
majority as constitutionally express
ed in duly enacted laws shall be re
spected and obeyed in all cases
might very well be a prime object of.
the soldiers' association. They might
stand as formidable as in France
against sedition, Bolshevism, mobs.
They fought for the ballot box. They
might well say, first of all, "The bal
lot box shall rule."
RETURNS TO NACO
C. G. Bayless came up from Naco

Hl-Y CABARET FRIDAY EVE
The Hi-Y girls are working hard

the best and most novel that Bisbee

court is being fixed up with lots of
light and a platform is being erected
in the center for the performers.
