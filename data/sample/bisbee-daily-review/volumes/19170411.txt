(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 10. Presi
dent Wilson and his cabinet at today's
meeting reviewed the many phases of
war activities, found every step pos
sible'to equip the army and navy and
turn out munitions under way and
decided that most pressing' needs of
the nation are to increase the supply
of foodstuffs and ocean-going vessels,
and to raise sufficient money to fin
ance America's part in the war and
make liberal loans to the Entente
Allies.
For present activities the allies are
said tp be well supplied with muni
tions and to have as many men in the
field as they can supply food tinder
present conditions. Through a coor
dination of the munitions industry in
the United States and the raising of
a large army, the I'nited States will
be in a position later to supply any
need for men in the field.
Members of the council of national
defense who are also members of the
cabinet took to the President t he
word that the most pressing need :s
for food and money.
President Wilson personally appeal
ed to farmers today through the Na
tional Agricultural Society to make
it their patriotic duty to increase the
food supply of the nation, and Sec
retary Lane brought forward a plan
for greatly increasing the acreage
under cultivation on public lands.
Secretary McAdoo left the cabinet
meeting early to appear before mem
bers of the house ways and means
committee regarding plans for issuing
bonds totalling $5,000,000,000, $2,0u(
000.000 in treasury certificates and
3 billion of the bonds to be lent to
the Allies. Bill for the issues will be
introduced tomorrow.

An exception will be made in the
case of regiments of negro troops,

over the authorized peace strength,
will be filled from waiting lists
to full war time strength. Recruiting
for other regiments also will be pro-

WASHINGTON. April in. Imme
diate creation of a federal food conr
mission, with power to fix prices ami
to supervise marketing and distribu
tion of food in the Unitw! States dur
ing the war. was proposed today by
the National Agricultural Society.
At an "agricultural mobilization"
convention held here the society
adopted resolutions recommending
this and other measures to meet a
threatened food shortaae. including
increased food crop acreage, and an
smendmrnt of wheat milling laws ami
a liberal encouragement of she p
raising.
The convention was called to aid
the administration in solving one of
the most serious problems in tlie run
duct of the war. The prospect of
short crops is giving great concern
to officials not only charted with the
responsibility of seeing that America
is fed. but keenly aware too that this
country must supply the other coun
tries fighting Germany.
In a letter read to the convention
President Wilson appealed to the far-"
mer to swell his production as a pat
riotic duty, and declared the farmer
by increasing his production in every
way possible will perform a labor fot
which he will be recognized as a sol-
dier of the commisary.

the National and American league
circuits. In the National league Pitts
burg will play at Chicago; St. Louis
at Cincinnati and Philadelphia at
Brooklyn. The opening game at Bos
ton with New York has been declared
on be?iide the grounds are covered
with snow. On the American circuit
Chicago will open at St. Louis; Cleve
land at Detroit; Washington at Phil

The league executives and ctiil
owners are loatbe to predict 'the ef
fect of the present international com
plications upon the national game.
In a general way they believe iiiat
base ball is facing a fairly prosperous
season but expect tile receipts and at

before the developments of the last
few weeks.
During the Spanish-American war,
baseball experienced little, if any set

Unusually close races are expected
in both leagues. The clubs of both

WHEN THE SHOE FITS.
Not alone on Brewery'Gulch are there Americans, or
people who delight to hover under the protection of
the American Eagle, who haven't taken the situation
very seriously. -Under'the circumstances, these are de
serving of the censors they receive and that Is plenty.
On the other hand, there may have been seme business
people who have .received censors Mhiph was unde
served. This publication does not make a policy of retracting
anything. It, in the nrtt place, does not print anything
which is necessary to retract When, however, by in
ference or otherwise,1 an injustice is done anyone, then
the Review is sorry. ,
We presume that Brewery Gulch is fully as patriotic
as Main Street. We hope so. One thing we know
however; Brewery Gulch was particularly noticeable fc
ijs slight splash of color during the loyalty parade Sun
day afternoon; We do not believe in holding one's
'light under a bushel.' Nor do we believe that ?be
Mayor, in his proclamation, meant that confectionery
stands, restaurants and any other business houses should
tack up two and one half feet of bunting in their houses.
He asked that all allow the Stars and Stripes to wave
in ther air. challenging the very spirit of opposition and
oppresiofi . it is necessary to hunt for the fla upon
or in various business houses, it would seem rather
obvious that it effect is nil. Consequently, the criticism
is well taken.
In any event. Brewery Gulch has more flags flying, at
the present time, than for months. There is a good
deal if sleeping sickness on the Gulch and when crit
icized it sometimes comes to earth and inquires "what'"
it all about." If yesterday morning's editorial in the
Review had no other effect, it certainly aroused the bus'
ness residents of that thoroughfare to the fact that the
people of the Warren District are extremely jealous of
all things American and especially the flag. -
ROYALTY SHOVELLING SNOW.
The commandant of the palace prison where Nicholas
Romanoff is confined reports that the former czar is in
fairly good spirits, but has "fits of crying." That is in
teresting. The spectacle of the "czar of all the Russias."
recently regarded as the most powerful potentate on
earth, blubbering, like a baby, is one for moralist to
linger over.
There is a brighter spot in the picture, however. We
are further informed that Nicholas's chief occupation is
"shovelling snow in the garden," and Mat he "enjoys
it greatly."
There, now, is something worth while! It warms the
cockles of an American heart to hear of royalty doing
something really useful.
Nick probably isn't much of shoveller. He's only about
five feet tall, and puny in build. Most any husky Ameri
can boy could give him a start of two or three drifts and
still beat him shovelling a path to the garden gate.
But it's the spirit that counts, rather than the quantity
of work completed. And he's better at shovelling than
czar-ing, anyhow.
If Nick had only shovelled snow instead of trying to
rule Russia! But now he ran make up for lost tliuc.
There's plenty of work to do. It boows a good deal
around I'etrograd. aud winter lasts most of the year.
In summer, Nick might saw wood. That, too. is mere
useful than czar-ing.
THE RUSSIAN JEWS.
In nothing has the new Russia government shown
its wisdom more than in its Jewish policy. It may be
that the revolutionary leaders are sincerely devoted to
the ideals of religious and racial tolcrauce. They ap
pear to'be. But quite aside from any quesfion'of prin
ciple of conviction, their prompt enfranchisement of a
long oppressed race is one of the most practical stcpu
that could have been taken to insure the success of
.their plans.
The shrewdness of the move is seen in the ready re
Kpoat&of ur own nation to' the new regime.' AmcricaTi
opiuiou. which had long been hostile to Ittissia, ami
which felt obliged to apoligize for its approval of tin;
Allies whenever Russia Mas mentioned, hanged almost
overnight to sympathy and approval. The only quarrel
we ever had with Hussia was due to the severity of the
Russian government toward its native Hebrews and its
refusal to honor the passports of American citizens of
Jewish blood. The removal of all disabilities from the
Jews was on assurance of democratic euqality and free
dom which struck a responsive chord in American hearts.
And it won the respect and friendship of other free
nations in almost as great a degree.
There is another result just as vital as this wlnnius
of foreign approval in general. It is the immediate re
sult on Jewish opinion. The Jiewa are the) world's
bankers. Heretofore Russia has been handicapped by
an informal but pretty effective financial boycott on the
part of wealthy Jews. Id the United States and else
where influential Hebrews, because of their antagonism
to the Russian autocracy for its persecution of their
brethren, made it hard for Russia to raise money. Now,
all at once, the Jews of the world turn to Russia with
sympathy and affection.
Rpssla can get the money she wants bow. That fact
may determine the success of the revolutionary govern
ment, and may even determine the success of the war.
WAR CROPS-
The advent of war makes it more than ever im
portant to increase food production. Tbe federal de
partment of agriculture, which until lately has been
questioning the wisdom of any "artificial stimulation" has
now begun to preach bigger crops as a patriotic duty.
A recent statement from Carl Vrooman, assistant sec
retary of agriculture, 6ets forth the desirability of raid
ing more wheat, not merely to feed our own population
and keep prices down, but as a war measure, enabling
us to contribute to the feeding of the Allies.
He suggests also that the average small farmer, owes
it to his country as well as io his family, to raise as
much of all that be consumes. He should raise chickens,
hogs and sheep along with bis cereals, vegetables and
fruit, thus making his family largely independent of out
side food sources. Every section of the country should
likewise try to make itself agriculturally Independent
of other sections, thus easing the burden of our trans
portation system and leaving it freer for military pur- i
poses. "
. But the obligation isn't all with' the farmers. "It 16
the patriotic duty of every city man. boy. woman or
girl who can to transform bis or ber yard or some nearby
vacant lot Into a garden .each square foot of which will
grow two or poasibily three crops during the coming sum
mer." If every citizen would assume this responsibility and
arry it out faithfully there would be no question of a
Plentiful food supply for the American people and ior
any foreign nation with whom they choose to share their
output.

lories. Under the term "munitions" were grouped many
articles such as barbed wire and airplanes which, while
susceptible of military use, are not necessarily imple
ments of war. The same may be said of automobiles,
motorcycles, surgical instruments, etc., classified as
"accessories." Experts estimate that not more than one
'eventb of the total volume of export goods consisted
if things which may unquestionably be termed muni
tions.' Our exports last year, altogether, ran $3,000,000,000
of that increase represented "peace goods." and the bulk
of the profits were made hy the peaceful folk who fur

goods must be held accountable. And that would be
ridiculous.

in the United States is due to no special set of business

Alter the preliminary proceedings
Mr. Thomas Cole, presiuent, stated1
what he bad done in arranging lor the
sale of the property. One prominent .
mining organization in the Warren j
Lismii muugui nis price too nign
while another, the Phelps-Dodge &.
Company, made a bid of 6t0,000 more'
or a total of 12,237,000, which he'
thought a fair price,
t'ndoubtedly, the lands, consistin
of nearly 2000 acres, were valuable in
their holdings of miners, declared Mr. I
Cole to the shareholders. It would '
necessitate, however, the reorganiza
tion of the company to go into min
ing. Much money wVmld have to be
raised. He could have secured the
underwriting of the new organization,
selling stock and giving shareholders
of the old company the right to sub
scribe according to their former hold
ings. He recommended the sale, stat
ing the money would be ready on
April 17. if the stockholders would I
get their shares to the secretary be
fore that time.
It was unanimously voted to accept
the price offered, concurring in the
action of the president and the board
of directors. The stockholders, in a
resolution, thanked Mr. Cole for his
efforts in behalf )t the company.
Mr. Cole briefly told of the trials
and discouragements encountered in
saving the property for the stockhold
ers, expressing satisfaction that not
an acre had been I tst. i
Considerabel money will be turned )
loose in Bisbee, as a consequence of :
the sale of the Warren. Many pt 1
pie in this District were holders of ,
the stock and welcome the sale and j
the possibility that the southeastern
end of the Warren. District is to be I
operated by a big mining organization. I

The devrftion tf an Italian organ

Clara Williams is presented for the
first time as a full fledged star.
Anions; the scenes in this subject
are several which depict the voyage
of Naneta. an Italian girl, to America.
They are abundant with the atnios
Tilwre of the steerage and tend to es
tablish the conditions rni'r which
the pirl riortrnwd bv Mi-s Williams
is comnelled to travi-I. One of ihe
touches of comedy is furnished by an
orean grinder's monkrv Director
Reginald Barker ipatriiotefl his prop
erty man to obtain one. , .
"You can very likely get one from
some organ .grinder," he told them.
The property men had no difficulty
in locating the orean grinder, but
when they announced that they were
anxious to 'Tent" the simian!
'No. no. noJ" protested the Italian.
'"He all I potta in dees" wort", an I no
wan' let beem go."
There was nothing to do but to en
gnae the Italian, too. and he made the
trip by boat to San Diego, anpearing
in a number of scenes with his mon

Julius Stager will, he seen as star
in the new Metro-Rolfe production
"The Stolen Triumph." which plays
at the Faele theatre today.
"The Stolen Triumph" is one of the
most dramatic and tense plays ever
screened and it carries with it a great
moral lesson. Stephen Hunt, the the
atrical manager in the story, stole
from Edwin Rowlev. the playwright,
his great play but its success brought
miserv to h"'i men.
In the plion'rama a devil, symbol
ic of Hunt's evil self is shown. It is
an allegories! spirit but it Is always
Present and ever-tempts Hunt to
thrust aside ihis better self and. blind
his fconsoicnfp. In a dramatic scene
where tte theatrical manager has his
great "self .battle" this evil spirit ac
tuslly awjteffrs on the screen behind

Agrinst this sinister power of ) his
"evil self his own sense of right' and

selves. His conscience is crushed
and for a time he is comoletely in the
clutches of his "evil self."
Ail this is actually shown in the
great picture. Coming from nowhere
the aVvIll in'1-person is seen battling
with the man for supremacy. And
when be has won and the good in the
man is broken the evil spirit fades
awav as mysteriously , as it appeared.
The character of Stephen Hunt, the
theatrical man. in whose heart this
battle between good and evil takes
place, is played in a finished manner
by Harry Burkhardt.

FANNIE WARD STARS
AT THE ROYAL TODAY
The production. "The Years of the
Locust." by Albert Payson Terhune,
which will be seen at the Royal today
with the beautiful Lanky star, Fannie
Ward, in the leading role, was delay
ed several days by the diamond mine
superintendent's too great desire for
accuracy. An exact replica of an Af
rican diamond mine was constructed
under the supervision of the superin
tendent, who, was formerly manager
of a mine-near Kimberley. Great
quantities of clay were placed in the
mine in which the workers were sup
posed to search for diamonds. A very
good qualify of clay was secured, but
it did not sv't the superintendent, who
wanted the rj'-.oiis blue clay in which
the diamonds are generally found.
When told.hM the ordinary clay
would do. he sot on his high horse
and said. "I have been hired with the
ton or two of mud with the camera
absolutely perfect and unless I have
instructions to make this diamond
ninepanny was just about ready to
dye some the blue clay I cannot do
so." The fODimn had a happy
thought; the lighter clay would pho
tograph bluer than if it was dyed. A
photographic test was made of a
piece of the dyed clay and a piece of
the ordinary clay and the supi-rinien-
j dent was appeased.

If you wake up with a bad taste, bad

sours and forms gas and acid in stom

before breakfast, a glass of real hot

Hospital records show that every
time you cut a corn you Invite lock-

says a Cincinnati authority, who tells
you that a quarter ounce of a drug
called freezone can be obtained at lit
tle (tost. from the drug store but is
sufficient to rid one's .foet of every

You simply apply a few drops of
this on a tender, aching corn and the
soreness is instantly relieved. Short

This drug is sticky but dries at 'once
and is claimed to just shrivel up any

This Simple Laxative
A Household Necessity
DR. caldwell;s SYRUP PEPSIN
. SHOULD HAVE A PLACE IN
EVERY HOME. .
Constipation, or inaction of the
bowels, a condition that nearly every
one experiences with more or less fre
quency, is the direct cause of much
.disease. When- the bowels become
clogged with refuse fim the stomach,
ffoul gases and poisons are generated,
and unless the congestion is quickly
relieved the system becomes weak
ened and most suceptible to attack,
j Various remedies to relieve constipa
tion are prescribed, but many of these
contain cathartic or purgative agents
that are harsh and violent in tbeir ac
tion and sh'ock the system. The mo6t
effective remedy is the combination
of simple laxative herbs with pepsin
'that is sold in drug stores under the
name of Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Tepsin.
j The Hon. John D. Keister of Brandy
i wine, W. Va., who has represented his
I district in the State Legislature for
! six years, writes that he uses Dr. Cald
'well's Syrup Pepsin and finds it a
splendid laxative, easy to take and
mild, yet positive, in its action, and
: that it should be in every household
l'jr use when needed.
Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin is sold
' by druggists in all parts ot the United
States and costs only fifty cents a bot
tle. It contains no opiate or narcotic

American Witness Reports
Thousands Dying From Ty
phus, Other Thousands Re
ported Starving.
TOKIO, March (Correspondence of
The Associated Press) A report ol
the conomon of the Russian reiugeee
is given by Tnoiua W. v ninemore, of
Boston, who has come t Japan lor
supplies after long service in direct
ing the worn ot tne American commit
tee tor reliel ot Russian refugees in
ttussia.' Tne lorced migration ot the
people ot iiuie Kussia iuu me neart
oi ine repuuitc was uescnoeu oy uuu
as one oi me greatest tu'jveuiems oi
people in history, m saiu mat the
uauies oi as many as 3,ouu,ooy rei us
ees were on tue omcial list and al
though tne new Kussian government is
doing everytuing numaniy possioie to
ameliorate tneir condition much re
mains to be done in tne way ot toYd,
clothing, medicine and sucker. Thou
sands died' in the night, barely ted,
poorly clotned. masses were carried
away by contagious diseases and tne
rest remained helpless, gathered in
barracKS and otner public places
vaugely and blindly waiting for fooa
and for occupation.
The Russian government has finally
distributed there refugees anftng dif
ferent parts of the republic yet the
problem, Mr. Whittemore said, was
far from settled. The great need was
for some form of organization which
will provide them with labor and the
means of living and while that eco
nomic question is being worked out,
fcxl. clothing and medicine are nec
essary. He had come to Japan, he
said, because the lack of shipping
space from the United States made
it practically impossible to get the
necessary supplies from that country
"I myself," said Mr. Whittemore,
"have seen a thousand people dying
from typhus. The religious fervor of
the Russian people is wonderful to
behbld. Death does not appear to
thehn as a terrible or undesirable. All
these wonderful sacrifices of the peo
ple, both military and civil, are of
fered to Holy Russia. I have seen
aged men and women passing away
on their miserable beds and I have
drug, does not grip, and is recommend
ed as a family laxative, mild enough
for the tiniest babe, yet sufficiently
powerful to act on the strongest consti
tution.
To avoid imitations -and ineffective
substitutes be sure to get Dr. Cald
well's Syrup Pepsin. See that a fac
simile of Dr. 'Caldwell's signature and
his' portrait appear on the yellow car
ton in which the bottle is packed. J
trial bottle, free of .harge. can be ob
tained by writing to Dr. W. B. Cald
well, 455 Washington St. Mouticello

seen their friends gathered about the
death-couch with joy ou their faces
and happy words on their lips. 'So
you are doinsr ij die', they would ex
claim. 'How happy you must be. Now
j you will be sure to pray for us when
I you pass aw- and we will be very
uappy.'
1 All that was to make the death of
j the beloved ones happy -and joyous.
yet when death came the rejoicing
was changed to lamentation. It is
simply marvelous this comprehen
sion of death in Russia today. I have
seen simple peasant soldiers going
lortii to battle. Friends yiuld ask
them where they were going and they
invariably answered: 'Why, we are
going forth to die,' and then their peo
pie would exclaim: 'Yes, they are
going out to die."
"There are ikons and crosses ev
erywhere anions these people of faith
They are borne constantly with them
4is the ever present symbol of this
death that is before them and the
happiness that is to come."
Local committees are aiding Mr.
Whitniore to secure supplies here :
needed for the relief of the refugees.

among those supplied.
In its consideration of ways of rais
ing a large army, and at the same
time keeping necessary industries go
ing at full speed, the administration
has decided to consider seriously the
production of luxuries and the nec
essaries of life. It is taken for grant
ed that people will be willing to give
up luxuries. In maintaining exemp
tions from military service if con
gress authorizes the draft, the govern
ment will take the position that if
young men work in industries produc
ing luxuries, their labor is not neces
sary, and they will ot be exempted.
Just what will be classed as luxuries
has not yet been determined.

OLD PEOPLE'S KIDNEYS
Many Elderly Bisbee Residents Suffer
From Some Form of Kidney
Trouble.
When past middle age. there fre
'quently comes a noticeable weakening
of the organs of the body, and result
ing danger of quick decline. It is
quite necessary to give prompt help
to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Healthy kidneys are necessary
to a hale old age. Weak kidneys often
bring constant backache, lame back,
stitches and twinges of pain, annoying
urinary ti'jubles, and the danger of
dropsy or Bright's disease. Doan's
Kidney Pills are gratefully recom
mended by very many aged people.
Read'what this Bisbee resident says:
W. W. Gristy, retired miner, Chi
huahua Hill, box 545. says:
"When a man gets to be 72 years
old he is apt to have some trouble
with his kidneys. Several years ago
my kidneys got out of order and the
muscles of my back became lame and
weak and hurt me every time I bent
over. My kidneys became weak and
inactive. The kidney secretions were
highly colored. I felt pretty much run
down when I began taking Doan's
Kidney Pills, but two boxes fixed me
up in good shape. Since then I have
used Doan's off and on and tbey have
kept my kidneys well and my back
strong."
Price 50c, at all dealers. Don't sim
ply ask for a kidney remcdy--get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that
Mr. Gristy uses. Foster-Milburn Co.,
