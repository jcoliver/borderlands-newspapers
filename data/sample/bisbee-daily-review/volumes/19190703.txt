BORGO SAN LORENZO, Italy,
July 2 (By The Associated Press).
This city, wrecked , by ; earthquake
Sunday, resembles a town in devas
tated districts ot France after an ar-
tillery , bombardment The cathedral
is in ruins. Hundreds of homes and
. shops have been shaken down. Sgme
of these, still habitable after the ma
jor shocks, fell down during the la
ter earth tremors.
Many people are living in tents.
Military authorities have been un
able to Induce the .bakers and the
shopkeepers to return to their places
of business becaues of the unsafe
condition of the ., buildings. In the
bakeshopa many of the ovens were
cracked by the earthquake. Hardly
a hou3e was undamaged. There ap
pears to be little acute suffering, but
there is: a great demand for clothing
and food which are in charge of the
military authorities.
' The local administration and busi
ness are disorganized and the inhabi
tants are giving free rein to the mili
tary authorities who are distributing
relief.
The first supply truck reached
here Monday morning in charge of
an American Y. M. C. A. staff un
der Harry Hobart of Tucson, Ariz.
He told the Associated Tress cor.
respondent that when he arrived he
was literally mobbed by the hungry
people. He said the scramble for
food was such that members of the
Y. M. C. A. force mounted a wall
and tossed the food to the people be
cause they could not hold them back
on the ground.
"We offered our help to the Ital
ian command at Florence," said Ho
bart, "who accepted it. We, then
loaded our trucks with all the goods I
in our Florento canteen and started'
out behind a truckload of soldiers, i
Although not the first truck to ar

Mexico Can -Take Care of All
Border Towns Without Aid
From U. S. Army, Message
Of Bonillas to Washington
MEXICO CITY. July 2. Yenacio
Bonillas, Mexican ambassador to the
United States, on his return to Wash

the White House that no American
troops be senr across the border and
and that the United States institute
measures that will absolutely prevent
the smuggling of arms and ammuni
tion to rebels in northern Mexico, it
was learned oificially today.
Decision to make these reauests was
reached at a conference Senor Bonil
las had with the foreien affairs d-
part'ment before his departure for the
United State3.
The ambassador has been authoriz
ed to state that the Mexican govern
ment has sufficient means to prevent
harm to American border towns in
any possible fighting without aid from
the United States.
It was also learned from unofficial,
but reliable sources that General Can,
dido Aguilar, who is on a journey to
the United States and Europe as
President Carmnza's confidential am
bassador, carries no authority to
make agreements binding on the Mex
ican government, but is malting the
trip simply to secure information
which would aid the Mexican govern
ment in fixinjj its foreign policy.

PERSHING
COPPER CO. TAX VILLA ORDERED
SUITS DISMISSED ALL AMERICANS
BY STATE COURT HANGED, REPORT
Holds An Appeal Cannot Be
Taken From the State Tax
Commission to a County
Court; Judge Ross Dissents
PHOENIX, July 2. The state su
preme court late today reversed and
dismissed the Inspiration Consolidat
ed Copper Company and the Interna
tional Smelting Company tax4, suits,
the judgment being a victory for the
Arizona tax commission.
The corporation had appealed
against the valuations placed on their
properties and appealed to the Gila
county superior court. Here the as
sessments were reduced and the
state and Gila county appealed to
the state supreme court, today's de
cision being the result.
"The decisions of the state su
premo court in these two suits are
of the greatest importance to the
state," said Charles R. Howe of the
tax commission tonight. "An oppo
site decision would have thrown the
state intdythe same condition which
existed before, statehood ,was attain
ed and before any centralized tax au
thority existed.
"The decision that an appeal can
not be taken from a state tax com
mission to a county court is highly j
gratifying to, the commission, not.
that we object to review, but that
reviews, in county courts would mill
tate against the efficiency of the
state tax commission."
The decision of the supreme court
handed down today was written by
Chief Justice Cunningham and con
curred in by Justice A. C. Paker,
with Justice Ross dissenting in his
view that he does not believe the
law allows an appeal to the supreme
court in a case of this sort.
The majoirty of the court held
that under the existing law there is;
no appeal whatever from decisions j
on assessments made by the state tax i
commission on these types of prop
erty, and, for that reason, the case
was remanded to the Gila county su
perior court, where it originated,
with instructions to sustain the orig-;
inal demurrer and dismiss the cases. J
The value of the Inspiration Con-;
solidated mines set by the Gila
county assessor in 1917 was held to
be too low by the tax commission,
which used the method of valuation
by so-called "intangible assets,"
which took into consideration the
earnings of the properties. The as

For Letting Two Americans

At Villa, Calling Him "Liar"
i
EL PASO, July 2. Francisco Villa,
enraged ' because American troops
drove him from Juarez, ordered his
rebels to hang every American they
caught, sent . a detachment to Villa
Ahumada to hang two Americans be
lieved to have been there, and finding
them gone, threatened . to kill his
brother, Hipoilto Villa, who was sick
at Villa Ahuniida, Donald B. Best
declared today after fits arrival from
Mexico Best, a Eritish subject, owns
a large store at Villa Ahumaaa.
"With A. M. Tenney, an American,
I left Villa Ahumada June 13 for the
border after Villa had looted my store
and home," Mr. Best said. "I return
ed to Villa Ahumada June 27, after
Villa left there for San Lorenzo, and
was told by my native storekeeper,
the municipal piesidente, Manual Or
tega, and a riaber of townspeople
that Villa sent a guard to kill Tenney
and I and, later, rode to my house in
person apparently for the same pur
pose. He ordered my Mexican store
keeper to stop working for me, think
ing l was au American, and threat
ened to kill him if he continued in my
employ. He said then he was going to
hang all the Americans he caught and
was looking for me to make the first
example of this policy.
Orders Telegraph Hangings
"Villa also told the storekeeper that
Tenney and I knew the Americans
intended firing on his troops and had
left for the border to escape him. This
seemed to anger him all the more.
That was on J;.ne 17, the same day he
ordered all his soldiers to kill Ameri
cans as soon s. captured, not to bring
them before bim, out to hang them to
tne nearest tsls&raph pole."
Best said Hipolito Villa was se
riously ill in the Best home in Villa
Ahumada when Villa threatened him
and the leader's brother was forced to
leave in a small cart "for the Ojinaga
district to save Ms life. Villa and his
band looted the Best store of inoo
pesos In cash and 5000 pesos worth of
goods and also robbed his residence,
he said. The Villa rebels looted the

"Regarding the radio, the re-
suits obtained by the radio offi

broke many previous records,"
said Read. "He sent messages
over 700 miles. He heard Bos

Ford Ship Known as "Good Ship Nutty,"
Pacifism Pleased Kaiser, Says Gerard
MOUNT CLEMENS, Mich., July 2. Tiffany Blake, testifying today
in the Henry Ford-Chicago Tribune libel suit, recited reasons why he,
as head of -the editorial department of the Tribune, gave approval to
the editorial headed, "Ford is an A anarchist," on which the million dollar
litigation is founded.
Before Mr. Blake was called the time was taken up with the testi
mony of Colonel Henry J. Reilly, who commanded the artillery regiment
known as "Reilly's bucks" in the Rainbow division in France, and a long
deposition from James W. Gerard, former United States ambassador to
Germany. He stated that at he embassy the Ford peace ship Oscar II,
was known as the "good ship Nutty." German official opinion was that
the United States did not want to fight, and couldn't do so even if it so
wished, said Gerard. Germany ; re garded pacifist propaganda in 1915 as
favorable to her, because any peace at that time must b eto her advan
tage. It was the kaiser he said, who declared that "American had better
look out afcer the war."
VThen Mr. Blake was sworn. At torney Kirkland of counsel for the
Tribune, asked him to state why h e approved the characterization of the
manufacturer as "an anarchist."
"Because," said the witness, "at a time when the United States was
in grave danger, he advocated the destruction of our army and navy;
becanse he said he didn't believe in patriotism; because, with the world
in flames, he oppbsed preparedness; because he said the flag should be
pulled down and because he said that soldiers were murderers." -
SACK ITALIAN
TOWN IN RIOTS
Mobs Wreck Stores, Seize
Food and Distribute it
. AtHalf Price
FORLI, Italy, July 2 (By The As
sociated Press). After a great meet
ing here yesterday in which a vast
crowd protested against the high
cost of living, the people, excited by
inflammatory speeches, attacked,
sacked and destroyed many shops
which refused to sell commodities at
lower prices.
The fury of the mob made no dis
tinction. and had no limits. All the
principal shops were plundered and
the niobs terrorized the entire city.
They took possession of lorries and
transported all kinds of goods andl
food supplies from the pillaged shops
to the chamber of labor. On the
walls of tnis chamber they wrote
These goods are at the disposal of
the people.
The i situation grew, worse during
the day assuming a revolutionary
character, and the mob continued to
loot and destroy all kinds of prop
erty. The value of the goods stored by
the municipality was estimated at
8,000,000 lire. The proprietors of
those shops which escaped sacking
brought their tr-ys to the municipal
which is composed of Socialists and
Republicans, and they ordered that
the shops be reopened and the goods
sold for half price under the super
vision of representatives of the dem
onstrating masses.
Despite this apparent return to or
der in the riotous movement, the
movement, the losses are enormous
owing to the destruction of shop fit-, under government control during the
tings and commodities which could , mouth of May amounted to approxt

Deny False Report
That Naturalization
Is Denied Mexicans
A false report in regard to the is
suance of declaration of intention for
naturalization of Mexican citizens
in Cochise county, has been nipped
!i the bud at Douglas, arising out of
the recent trouble experienced by
contractors on public roads in hiring
Mexican labor.
The report received in Tombstone
was that immediately after a large
number of Mexican laborers had been
fired off the work, a number sought
to seek naturalization, and had been
refused the privilege of filing their i
declarations of intention by Clerk of
the superior court, J. E. James, and
the report was widely circulated that
the naturalization papers were being
refused Mexicans in order to keep
them from securing work on the
roads.
- Of course those who know the sit
uation discredited the report, but
jwhat probably broxight out the ru-,
mor was an instance several weeks
ago when a Mexican, only 17 years
..of age, applied for first papers, and
was refused, since he was not of
age, the law requiring an applicant to
bo IS years old.
To begin 'with, it is not within the
. jurisdiction of the clerk of the court
to decide as to the, motives of an
alien seeking citizenship and cer
tainly cot the intention of Mr. James,
- through whose office naturalization
. is handled, to keep anyone from- be
coming a citizen 'of the United
States. On the contrary, while
neither he nor his deputies are re
quired to fill out, or assist, applicants
in filling out their blank forms, as
sistance is lent In many cases in or
. der that no error may occur which
would deprive the applicant from se
curing citizenship even .for a few
. months. Tomstone Prospector.

Copper Comp'y Tax
vSuits Are Dismissed
(Continued from Page One)
sessed value was ?74,1G8,1S0. On
this asessment the company paid un
der protest 1624,224.14 and filed suit
to recover under the provision of the
law that provides for appeal" from
assessments by county assessors and
county equalization boards.
At the hearing Judge Shute of Gila
county cut '$18,000,000 from the .'tax
commission's ' valuation, which meant
a loss to the state in taxes of $130,
000 and said the commission set a
precedent, which if upheld, w6nld
practically do away with taxation on
the basis of earnings.
The state and Gila county appeal
ed to the state supreme court, where
judgment upholding the tax commis-.
sion was rendered today.
The case of the International
Smelting Company followed a course
similar to that of the Inspiration
Consolidated Copper Company, the
state supreme court's decision in this
being based on the findings outlined
at length in the other suit.

School Here Offers
Great Opportunity
For Bisbee Miners
The practical school of mines which
is being held at the Y. M. C. A. met
yesterday afternoon and evening for
one of the lectures in the course.
This brings before the miners of
Bisbee the fact that a great oppor
tunity is here offered of which some
are not taking advantage, say the
organizers of the course.
S. C. Dickinson, director of the ed
ucational department of the Phelps
Dodge Corporation, Copper Queen
Branch, is in charge of this course,
which resulted from the definite
policy of promoting all workers who
could qualify to the higher positions.
Mr. Dickinson believes that the time
is coming when capable shift bosses
are going to become scarce and
'when men with a broad view of 'the
mining industry can be obtained only
from the technical schools, a condi
tion making for bosses who may be
able to tell how the work should be
done, but who have never been in the
position of the worker.
It was this condition which led
the Copper Queen Branch of the
Phelps Dodge Corporation to estab
lish a practical mining course design
ed to assist the miner in his educa
tion iof mining matters so that he
could fill the position of shift boss.
This plan will give a better chance
to the miner- and will give the com
pany men who . not only understand
the theory of mining but who have
learned the business from the bottom
and will be in a better position to
understand probkms from the yiew
point of the workman. These classes
meet every Wednesday tiC'emoon and
evening and anyone is. welcome to
take the course.

WARREN IN TO
DESIGN LARGEST
SMELTER IN 51
A. G. McGregor of Warren has re
cently returned from New York
w-n'ere he was in consultation -with
several of the leading copper people.
Mr. McGregor, who is a well known
consulting engineer of this district,
has been commissioned by one of
ihe largest copper interests in South
America to prepare plans and de
signs for the largest smelter in that
country.
He spent a great deal of time in
the Chilean copper field in South
America about a year ago and by
reason of his firsthand information
and his past record in various
achievements in the erection of smel
ters in the southwest, he was given
one of the biggest jobs in this line
which has ever been attempted in
the southern continent and vwill run
into many millions of dollars. Mr.
McGregor figures that an additional
force to his present personnel of
probably thirty designers will take
about two years to complete these
plans. He is also consulting en
gineer for a number of the local min
ing properties which keeps hi3, pres
ent force going all the time.
He stated yesterday that all of the
three large copper groups operating
in the South American field believe
that the copper Industry was bound
to come to the front much faster in
the future than it has in the past
and that one of the properties there
showed every indication of soon be
coming the largest producing copper
mine in the world. The labor situa
tion there is not bad, says Mr. Mc
Gregor, and with the abundance, of
Chilean workmen a maximum out
put could be secured as soon as the
machinery and facilities were avail
able. Practically all of the proper
ties there are American owned and
a great deal of American capital is
being invested now in additional de
velopments which shows the confi
dence of the capitalists in the future
of copper, he says. -
Mr. McGregor has a large force of
men working at the corner of Vista
St. and Tener Ave., in Warren, on his
new home. He believes that War
ren is fast coming to be a real city.
A number of merchants arid others
from Eisbee are building in Warren
and Mr.' McGregor suggests the idea
of interesting some of the retired
cattlemen in building their homes at
Warren instead of the smaller cities
of the plains. He suggests that the
Commercial Club might do well to
take this matter up and see if more
of the cattlemen operating below the
border could not .be - interested in .
building their homes In this district.
A number of such instances have
been brought to his attention and
he believes that many people from
Douglas are now considering the
proposition of making their homes
in Warren as the good roads between
the two cities make a very, pleasant
drive for those having business there.
Great Britain has spent $700,000,
000 on industrial housing since the
war began; we have spent $110,000,-000.
I LAWS I!
EFFECT UNTIL
iTIOS
T
WASHINGTON', July 2. In the
absence of their statutory limita
tions, war measures effective until
the end of the war will con
tinue in operation until the ex
change of ratifications of the
treaty of peace between thi3 country
and its enemies. This interpreta
tion of several much disputed phrases
was given by Attorney General Pal
mer today as the accepted meaning
of the termination of hostilities and
the one on which administration of
ficials would proceed.
The trading with the enemy act,
however, is to continue in force un
til the date of the proclamation of
the exchange of the ratification of
peace treaties, but the President may
declare a prior date if he sees fit.
In the opinion of the department of
justice, the earlier date may not be
set before the end of the war, that
is the exchange of ratification of
treaties, the qualifying clause being
interpreted to mean onTy that the
President need not wait for the is
suance of the peace proclamation.
"Duration of the emergency," ; one
of the phrases used in war commis
sions in the army and navy, has not
been interpreted by justice officials.

Barbara Maurel has made records
for Columbia of "The Rosary" and
"At Dawning." These are tVo of
our American composers' finest
songs. "The Rosary" is known
around the world, and "At Dawning"
is one of the purest melodies of Cad
man, who represents our great West,
where he lived so long and composed
his "Indian" melodies. Maurel's ren
dering of these two songs so fre
quently murdered by amateurs is
an inspiration.

RECIPROCITY AND SAVING
THE "Patronize Homo Industry" idea, long held" by al pro
gressive merchants, has spread rapidly in late years through-
out American family life, until the mail order house cata
logue in the American home is now the rare exception where
it was once the common rule. The mail order habit, a con.lmiitant
of provincialism, is disappearing throughout the nation with grow
ing recognition of- the fact that every community is an organism, -or
which the citizens are tho mutually dependent parts and that the
success and giowth of the community is directly dependent upon
the extent "to which' its citizens aid and co-operate with each other
in the exercise of their several functions. .
Reciprocity in buying and in patronizing local enterprise for the
good of the community as a whole, even at the individual sacrifice,
has been continually preached But the Review wishes here to em
phasize another kind of reciprocity, a reciprocity cf saving and mutual
profit reciprocity not at a sacrifice, but at a premium.
The Review would here. have just a word with buyers of printing
in Bisbee and the' Warren District in fact with all the residents ot
the district, for every man and woman is a potential buyer of print
irg, whether in business or not.
With it3 purchase and installation of a Cottrell two-revolution
cylinder book an-1 commercial press, and a new Model "C" multiple
'magazine Intertype machine, the latest typesetting machine on the
market, the Review now has the most completely equipped printing
plant in Arizona, and the only printing plant in Cochise county hav
ing a book and commercial cylinder press equipment The Review is
now prepared to handle commercial printing of every kind from a
business card or a letterhead to loose leaf ledger work and all most
complicated forma.
This paper, with its $800 weekly pay-roll, is a considerable factor
in tfie business life of the community, and through its employes, all
of whom buy at home, is a liberal patroii of local business houses,
merchants, crafts, restaurants, hotels and landlords. The money
paid into the Review by subscriptions, advertisers and patrons of
its commercial printiug department, is practically all returned to cir
culation in" the Warren District. And the Review has just spent thou
sands of dollars on new equipment to further aid In the district's
prosperity. -
, Therefore the Review is asking for reciprocity in receiving the
district's pripting patronage, but it is asking that reciprocity not as a
favor, not even merely as a fair exchange, but with positive know
ledge that this plant is now in a position to SAVE THE PEOPLE
OP THE WARREN DISTRICT MONEY ON ANY AND ALL KINDS
OF COMMERCIAL PRINTING, and thus benefit its patrons and aJa
to the prosperity of the district, while giving them an opportunK;,
ci" fostering home industry.
The Review asks that you at least let us submit our bid before
sending out of town for that next order of commercial printing. You
will be readily convinced that in aiding home industry you are aiding
al30 yourself putting dollars and cent3 into your own pockets, while
conforming to tho dictates of progressive citizenship.
The Review's new $100,000 plant now contains five presses, three
typesetting machines, a complete, bindery department, a $5,000 stock
of paper to select from, and a staff of none but expert and skiUci;
craftsmen. In addition to all classes of -printing, anp kind of ruling or
bcok-tinding can be done in thi3 ldant promptly, eficiently and at n
saving over out-of-town prroes. v
If unconvinced, phone "39" and let us talk it over.
Let us get together in a spirit of reciprocity a reciprocity which
swells bf.nk accounts; reciprocity at a premium.
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF LIFE
MANY of us worry because we are drifters. We have no
plans in life.
We have cut loose- from our moorings and thrown
chart and compass overboard.
We are like the fellow who said, "1 don't know where I'm going,
but I'm on tho way."
Or like the dog that sat, lonely, in the railrcad station because

It doesn't matter so much what your occupation may be wheth
er it's in the home, the school, the shop or the store your life will
be immensely relieved from anxiety and the petty worries if you have
some big ideal, the striving after which makes every little worry
Beem like the pebbles or. the highway to the strong traveler who i3
journeying home. These are mere incidents in his progress and be
is unmindful of them because of the goal just beyond.
Defiiniteness brings calmness.
The assurance that cne is on the way and not merely drifting
brings courage in time of storm. With not a ship in sight and n"!
land to le seen anywhere, with nothing but a waste of water all
about the captain of the ocean steamer is nevertheless calm and
serene. HU course is worked out He has a compass which directs
him and a chart to show him the way and he's steering as the coni
rass directs.
It's a mighty good thing, once in a while, to stop and ask your
self, "What is the purpose of my life? Is there anything towara
which I am working? Or is life merely a succession of daily jobs?
The vote of confidence denied Orlando was a vote of confidence

A plebiscite on the treaty question may not abolish war, but a

PACKING PLANT AT PHOENIX
PHOENIX, July 2. Contracts for
drawing up the plans for the big pack

Phoenix by the Arizona Packing com
pany have been let to the Packers'
Architectural Engineering company at
Chicago, according to J. C. Hurley, one
of the larger stockholders, who re
ceived a telegram to that effect recent
ly from E. A. Tovrea at Chicago.
When the plans are completed they
will have to be submitted to the bu
reau of animal industry at Washing
ton, and they will be scrutinized and
passed. Just as soon as this is done
the actual work will commence. In
the meantime a spur track is being
run from the Arizona Eastern line to
the packing plant site, and grading for
the laying of tracks, is already com
pleted. The spur track will save
great delay in delivering all necessary
construction materials and machinery
directly at the building site. Since
the big packing house project that
will revolutionize the cattle industry
in the southwest is already financed,
there will be nothing to hinder start
ing on the construction work as soon
as the plans have received the ap
proval of the government. In the
meantime, E. A. Tovrea, preident; J.
T. Hughes, ice president, and Fred
Tribolt, secretary and treasurer, are
looking after the interets of the new
Arizona company in Chicago.

hasty departure of the dealer.

DEVICE FOR RAISING
LUMBER SHIPS
PHOENIX, July 2. Harry J. Bcn
nott has just been granted a patent
for a device which will result m
the salvage of sunken vessels at
sea and which but for sotr-e such in
vention would be left at the bottom of
the sea forever. Mr. Bennett has
been workiug on the invention for u
long time and lately has bad, associ
ated with him in ' the enterprise
Postmaster Selim J. Miciielson. Sea
going men and those familiar with
marine affairs are agreed that the in
vention will be of the greatest service
and will undoubtedlp be adopted by
nearly all vessels. An incentive to its
adoption would certainly be lower
rates of marine insurance.
The device consists of six tanks,
three on each side of the hull of the
vessel, each containing r strong
clutch attached to the hull, 2000 feet
of three-eights of wire cable, fastened
to the clutch and at the. other end to
a balloon-shaped buoy filled with gas.
The buoy is left free so that when the
vessel sinks the buoys rise to the sur
face, each ot the six bringing with it
the 2000 feet of cable. That length
of cable is only arbitrary; any length
may be -substituted for it.

RUSSELL CHAMBERS-
Pride of First Cavalry, U. S. A., 148-pound boxer who meets Johnny Mc
Cullough in the semi-finals 10-round bout on Fourth of July celebration boxing
card in the baseball park at Warren tomorrow night.
The big event of tomorrow will
probably be the boxing matches in
the baseball park at 8 o'clock. Rus
sell Chambers, with the First Cav
alry of Douglas, has offered $500
that he will get the decision in the
match with Johnnie McCullough and
looks like there is more money up
Jon McCullough than any of the
fighters who will be here tomorrow,
and that Chambers will find takers
today. ,
The program starts at 8 o'clock
with a curtain' raiser exhibition -of 4
rounds between Bohmer Zumzteg,
age 11, and Tiny Zumsteg, age 9.
The second event of 4 rounds be
tween Johnnie Hughes of Bisbee and
Private Grady of the First Cavalry
at Douglas promises some fun.
The third numher of 6 rounds, 128
pounds, between Kid Lundy of Low
ell and Johnnie Greeves of El Paso
will be followed by the semi-final of
10 rounds, 148 pounds between John
J. McCullough of Bisbee and Hussel
Chambers of the First Cavalry of
Douglas. "The final 10 rounds ban
tamweight between Bobby Burns of
Dallas, Tex., and Ralph Lincoln of
Los Angeles will be the big event.
Jack McDonald, the well known
sportsman of El Paso, will be the
referee and Sheriff McDonald will be
the official announcer.
John Twomey and Red Gannon are
the timekeepers. In case of rain the
bouts will be postponed to Saturday
at 8 o'clock and the tickets will be
good at that time.
Bobby Burns Makes
Good Impression in
His Boxing Stunts
i .
Yesterday afternoon, Bobby Burns,
bantamweight boxer and army : box
ing instructor, well known throughout
the United States and who is now
at Camp Harry Jones at Douglas,
was seen at the Y. M. C. A. gym
nasium in training for the match oir
the 4th of July at Warren.
Burns showed that he was full of
the substances that makes new
life and pep. To Bay that he Is
, arousing new interest in the game
of "mitts", is but putting it mildly for
he is putting up a sample of the stuff
which interests every man and wom
an Interested in the art of self de
fense. Burns' says that "fcoxing has a
tendency to promote confidence in a
man, not from the view point of the
thug, but to the contrary. If a man
understands his ability to defend
himself he will not, as a rule, be the
aggressor, but will , be the last one
to resort to 'fistic1 methods' to carry
his point. When reasoning has gone
beyond control of : a 'situation, and
the : offender, once makes an attack
the well instructed 'boxer will natur
ally .use his fists.' as a means to em
phasize his notions on the offender.
Being taught reserve he will natural
ly be the cooler of the two and will
so settle the argument with : a well
directed blow where it .will' do the
quickest and greatest temporary dam
age. . -.. y -

GLAD JOTESTIFY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To Whtf
. Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. W. Gladwell,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
tnd my health was awful
hj mother bought me a bottle ol
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three .J.I gained, and was' well
md strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
If I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
others."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
iches, backaches, or any of the other
lilments so common to women, why not
live Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need. .

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 2. Revival of
bullish operations almost without par
allel since the crest of the June wave
was witnessed on the stock exchange
today, trading ignoring the pending
holidays and their speculative uncer
tainties. The movement was largely if not
wholly influenced by a pronounced
easing of money rates, call loans fall
ing to 6 per cent, after opening at 8
to 9. Time funds also relaxed on the
better supply, but most loans of that
character were limited to the shorter
maturities.
Prices rose 1 to 3 points almost at
the outset food, motor, rubber and
equipment shares again setting the
pace, which was extended, subject to
intermittent realizing, to the end.
Outstanding individuad features em
braced Crucible and Sloss-Sheffield
Steels, Chandler, Studebaker and Gen
eral Motors, Keystone and Kelly
Springfield Tires, American and Bald
win Locomotives, Westinghouse Elec
tric, American and Lorillard Tobac
cos, Tobacco Products and United
Cigars at gross gains of 2 to 9 points.
Oils and shipping made limited, but
substantial advances under the lead of
Texas company Mexican Petroleum,

ternational and Marine common. Sales
1,500,000 shares. .' V

Liberty and international issues show
ing slight gains. Total sales, par
value, $8,250,000. " . .
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. July 2. Highest prices
yet this season in the corn market
resulted today from rainless, hot
weather and from continued skyrock
eting in the value of hogs. Corn clos
ed buoyant, September $1.82 to
$1.83; December $1.61 to $1:61
and the market as a whole 4c to
5c above yesterday's finish. Oats
and provisions jumped also to new top
levels for the season, scoring respec
tively net gains of lc to 2c and
37c to $1.50.
Inasmuch as the growing corn crop,
hindered by a poor starf and by re
duced acreage, needs exceptionally
favorable weather to make a large
yield, the market was sensitive in the
extreme to talk of possible detriment
from prevailing high temperatures un
accompanied by adequent moisture.
Drought and heat lifted oats. Be
sides French and British crop advices
were bullish.
Provisions were sharply higher in
sympathy with grain and hogs. Shorts
covered.

WHAT GILBERT-TRUE
OIL CO. OFFERS
This Company capitalized for $150,000 offers three
wonderful money making opportunities in the oil busi
ness. ' "
THEIR FIVE ACRES in Northwest Burkburnett not only
adjoins the TEXAS CHIEF, but this 5 acres is known as
the TEXAS CHIEF OFFSET. That is, the property to
be an offset must be within 300 feet of the TEXAS
JHIEF well itself. This five acres is now being drilled
under contract for the GILBERT-TRUE COMPANY
according to our latest advices and is worth in our
estimation the entire capitalization of the GILBERT
TRUE OIL COMPANY the TEXAS CHIEF is the big
gest well in Burkburnett field and the TEXAS CHIEF
OFFSET well or the GILBERT-TRUE well should be
the SECOND BIGGEST WELL IN THE FIELD.
THE SETTLED PRODUCTION owned by the GILBERT
TRUE of 100 barrels a day amounts to over $6,000,
a month or $75,000 a year this warrants the
dividend which the company is paying. ;
THE ROYALTY OWNED by the GILBERT-TRUE COM
PANY on the NORWOOD WELL and tract is another
valuable asset. The NORWOOD first well is producing
over 7,00a barrels daily. The entire tract consists of
750 acres and the TEXAS COMPANY is under contract
to drill ONE WELL FOR EVERY TEN ACRES. They
have nine wells now drilling with two on the sand. This
royalty alone should in a short time pay at least 100
per cent to stockholders yearly.
GILBERT-TRUE OIL is the "wonder" stock on the
market today and should be bought while the oppor
tunity at $1.50 is available. !;
