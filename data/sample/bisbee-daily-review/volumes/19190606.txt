PROBE LEAK
President, Aroused At Charge
Peace Treaty Given Out In
N. Y Asks Investigation
Plot Between the Democratic
Leaders And Taf t Charged
By Borah On Senate Floor
WASHINGTON. June 5. In more
than five hours of heated debate to
day the senate ran the whole scale
of issues involred in the peace treaty
fight.
Starting with the controversay
over the publication of the treaty,
the discussion drifted to principles ot
the treaty itself and of the League of
Nations and before it was finished
involved sharp charges of partisan
ship and politics from both sides of
the chamber. ,
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska,
senior Democrat of the foreign rela
tions committee, charged that Chair
man Lodge and Senator Borah of
Idaho had made an attack "of a most
cpnn1a,rt,1Q T,Qtw,., t1 ...
scandalous nature" on the president
in their statements telling of copies
of the unpublished treaty In Ne-
York. A searching investigation was
demanded by t the Nebraska senator.
Senator Lodge replied there was
nothing to conceaf and tha he would
welcome investigation, which should
include also the Democratic state de
partment. ,
Charges Conspiracy with Taft
Senator Borah made a similar
statement and then, charged that
there was a "conduit" between those
backing theLeague to Enforce Peace,
headed by former president Taft, and
those who possess information' as to
what is in the treaty.
Tonight Acting Secretary Polk of
the state department took a hand in
the controversy through issuance of j
a statement denying a declaration of
Senator Lodge during the debate that
the state department had told newspa
per men financial sections of the
treaty were in the hands of financial
interests in New York.
"As far as I know," Bald Mr. Polk.
in the first formal expression on the ,
subject that has come from the de
partment, "the copies of financial and
reparation sections are not In the
hands of unauthorized persons." .
Wilson Aked for Probe
Meantime it became known that
Senator Hitchcock, in asking for an
investigation of the channels through
which copies of the treaty reached
New York, was acting with the back
ing of the White House. His resolu
tion directing the foreign relations
committee to , investigate was intro
duced yesterday. It was said author
itatively after he had been requested
to do bo at a White House conference.
This development, together with
the statement of Mr. Polk, was taken
in some quarters to mean that here
after the president and the state de
partment may take a more direct part

IN WINNIPEG STRIKE
Thousands Appointed As City
Constables Gain Upper
Hand Of Strikers
WINNIPEG Man. June 5. The
fourth week of the Winnipeg general
strike began this afternoon with hun
dreds of reurned soldiers pledged to
assist the city authorties in maintain
ing law and order and in providing
free flow of foodstuffs.
More than 4000 war vef.erans as
sembled today and passed resolutons
denouncing some of the strike leaders
as anarchists and agents of revolution
and promised: Mayir-Gray hi3 appeal
for 2000" constables tobe filled from
the ranks of loyal returned soldiers.
The meeting demanded the govern
ment bring" men responsible for the
Winnipeg upheaval "to justice" urged
the immediate deportation of. "all un
desirable aliens" and declared "the
only' one big union which Canadian
soldiers would recognze was the
Union Jack."
While the mass meeting was being
held1 a parade of strikers and strike
sympathizers passed within a block of
the auditorium.
Military officers and Mayor Gray
succeeded in influencing the soldiers
at the mass meeting not to visit the
Trades and Labor Temple today. At
the opening of the meeting speakers
demanded the meeting adjourn so the
parade could "proceed to the labor
temple.'
Mayor Gray accepted the offer of
the soldiers to assist in maintaining
law and order by asking for the 2000
special officers to guard property and
to act as body guards for workmen
who have been intimidated. Announce
ment that thhe city would pay the
soldiers $6 a day was encouragingly
received.
A large body of reurned soldiers
were sworn in for constable duty.
When the parade neared the muni
cipal building men on the sidewalk
cried "scabs" and five fights started
"Mayor Gray made the following
statement at the soldiers' meeting:
"The strike leaders have publicly
announced that" they intended to jun
the city of Winnipeg; that they would
say who would eat and who would not
and they have intimated they were
powerful enough to bring about a
change of government. I know that
the men who fought for the old flag
in France have had enough of. Hun
ism and Bolshevism and I'll be
damned if we're going to stand for it."

WASHINGTON, June 5. Telegraph
and telephone companies whose Hups
have been controlled and operated by
the government since last August 1,
were ordered tonight to resume im
mediate operations for their own ac
count by Postmaster General Burleson.
The postoffice department, however,
under terms ot Mr. Burleson's order,
retains a measure of control of the
services, pending final legislative ac
tion by congress.
Regulations prohibiting discrimina
tion against wire employes because
of union affiliations, maintaining ex
isting rates and charges and instruct
ing companies to keep special ac
counts to facilitate cost settlement be
tween themselves and the government .
are retained in effect under the or
der issued by the postmaster general.
Puts It Up to Wilson, Congress .
Mr. Burleson accompanied the order
with a statement giving the reasons
which impelled him to take the action.
He asserted that the president hav
ing recommended the return of the
properties, the senate Interstate com
merce committee having indicated
that immediate return was advisable
and the house committee having
through hearings manifested a desire
for action toward that end he felt
it his duty to return operative control
to the various private owners.
Strikes threatened by telephone and

bearing on the department's action,
officials said.

plications with the commission of
state institutions for loans of $20,000
each before senate bill 90 goes into
effect June 12. This measure provides
that state monies shall be expended
only for the specific purposes for
which they are raised. The practice
in the past has been to loan counties
money for bridge building ou of the
road fund, the commission of state in
stitutions having jurisdiction over the
highway department.
Mohave county wished its loan to
build a bridge over the Colorado river

LAST CHANCE
On Silver Cycle
SILVER CYCLE is a sensational stock BECAUSE it ia in the
SENSATIONAL neighborhood; IN BLOCK 75.
Tlir least bit of extra news of new development will be the means
of taking up every share that is offered at 1.50.
WE BELIEVE THAT NEWS IS NOW ON THE STREET
It came over the wire. Is absolutely authentic and reads as
follows:
"Wichita Falls, June 2. Meadows Barker well in
Block 75, adjoining Silver Cycle on the east, came
in today with a good flow of oil. The well has net yet
been fully completed and the drillers say it will be a
sensational well. P. J. McKeown.
This telegram in referenct' to the MEADOWS BARKER will
mean the heavy buying of SILVER CYCLE and should over
subscribe the reservations which Brokers are offering at $1.50.
Jest how much of the stock can be bought EVEN NOW at $1.50,
is hard to estimate and many are holding it for higher prices.
SILVER CYCLE SHOULD BE SELLING at a price SOMEWHERE
NEAR her rich neighbors.
UNITED OIL is doing today what SILVER CYCLE ought to be
doing a short time from now. . UNITED OIL is sending out
dividend checks of 75 per cent. SILVER CYCLE is 200 YARDS
FROM UNITED OIL.
GOLD.EN CYCLE adjoining SILVER CYCLE is not only drilling
another well but is repairing the damage done by fire on her
first will. THEY tell us that the GOLDEN CYCLE'S first well
is really BIGGER THAN THE BURK-WAGGONER.
SUMMIT ET. OIL adjoining SILVER CYCLE brought In a
BIG WELL last week which started the ball rolling for SILVER
CYCLE.
MEADOWS BARKER the news just received en MEADOWS
BARKER should sell every share in sight of SILVER CYCLE
and we doubt if 25.000 SHARES can be bought from all the
brokers combined. '
SILVER CYYCLE OIL COMPANY, headed by J. A. D. Smith, who
put OCEAN OIL on the map. is a REAL OIL COMPANY. This
company already has "production, in the "shallow" fields. This
company owns over 500 acres. Its capitalization of $15C.CO0 war
rants the Company in guaranteeing the trilling of Three Wells cn
their acreagt in Block 75. SILVER CYCLE OIL COMPANY IS
TODAY DRILLING THE FIRST ONE IN BLOCK 75.. SMITH
believes that this first well will be "in- by the 17th of this month.
IT SHOULD BE A BIG WELL.
THE COMPANY HAS ANNOUNCED THAT CN JUNE 17TH THEY
WILL LIST THEIR SHARES ON THE EL PASO STOCK EX
CHANGE AT $3.00 A SHARE
(On the same date they will apply for listing on the New York
Curb and the Los Angeles Stock Exchange).
WE BELIEVE that the market on SILVER CYCLE will be above
$3.00 before the 17th. THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND
should place this stock at HIGHER FIGURES.
WE BELIEVE when the Company brings in their well in Block 75
that the SHARES WILL SELL AT 10 FOR 1.
THIS IS OUR VIEWPOINT. Looking at It from a Broker's
standpoint we have been favored In our judgment of STOCKS and

Onliy Small Men Dishonor Father and Mother
"Thou shalt not"
So runs the preface to most of the ten commandments given by
God to Moses.'
But there's one commandment with a special promise to those
who keep it:
"Honor-thy father and thy mother that thy days may
be prolonged, and that it may go well with thee in the land which the
Lord thy God giveth thee."
This is a mighty wholesome comamndment to emphasize, even
though no special blessing were attached to it:
"Honor thy father and thy mother."
And of course you wouldn't call them, the "old man," and the "old
woman" if they were honored by you.
And you wiuldn't speak disrespectfully to them at any time.
Neither yould you patronize them, as though you were , superior
especially when you "treat them" to a good time. t
They are usually so grateful and so proud of you and they have
a way of showing it so that you come to feel you are so much better
than they are.
"Honor thy father and thy mother."
There's no surer indication that you're small and contemptible tuan
when you dishonor them. ,
Perhaps they haven't had the chance to put on all the polish that
you've acquired, but don't forget that they made it possible for you to
get the start that helped you win.
"Honor thy father and thy motehr."
Incentive For
Gradually municipalities are learning by experience how to' deal
'with public utilities. The latest experiment is that of Montreal. For
that city a tramways commission was in charge of framing a contract.
It made a special study of the Cleveland' contract, which provides for
service at cost. It adopted that as the basis of the Montreal contract,
but it added an interesting feature.
There is one objection to the Cleveland contract. The company is
under no incentive to operate economically. It is virtually guaranteed
its 6 per cent. So why should any official get sweaty and fray his
nerves trying to keep down expenses? His company can't prof it. from
any such exertions.
So the Montreal commission has provided an incentive. Service is
to be furnished at cost. But there is a bonus for good service. At the
beginning of each year the tramways commission prepares a schedule
for operating expenses, as well as for preventing overcrowding of cars.
If at the end of the year the company is found to have kept within its
schedule or has not exceeded it more than 2 per cent, it is entitled to
a special bonus known as the operating profit. It may be penalized if
it fails to meet the schedule requirements.'
Under this arrangement the company has an incentive to keep down
expenditures and incidentally the rate oft fare and to do so without
skinning the service. ...
It is an interesting experiment. Its success in whatever city tried
will depend on a fair capitalization to start with and on a competent
commission. .
In the Same Shape
The demand has been made that the government return the rail
roads "in the same condition" in which the government received them
a year ago last November. That will not be an easy thing for the
government to do. It would have to return them stripped of the handi
cap of two wage increases which have since been made.
The government, for political reasons would certainly not want to
reduce the wages if it could and it is equally certain that it could not
without producing a paralyzing country-wide strike.
Nor could the private owners Teduce the generous wage scale fixed
by the government without the same result. So it is quite evident
that the railroad wage scale is with usto stay until a new higher level
is proposed. '
There is therefore no prospect of a material reduction of rates
under restored private management. Probably something may result
from increased efficiency under private direction, but such savings aa
may thus be effected will likely go rather to an improvement of the
service which under government management has moved in an inverse
ratio to rates. That is the most we can hope out of the wreck the
government has made of the roads. Arizona Republican.
Farmerettes May Keep Jobs
It looks as if the farmerette will come into her own again this
summer. The idea of using girls on the farm last season was something
of a venture, but the plan proved such a huge success that both farmers
and farmerettes are anxious to carry it out again this year.
Little effort has been made to recruit the girls this season, owing
to the desire to give returned soldiers first choice of farm jobs, but this
sort of work' is evidently not appealing to the service men as little
response is being received from them.
If greater interest is not shown by the soldiers it will be up to the
farmerettes to get back on the job again, which the young women are
said to be anxious to do. Buffalo News.

- YUMA ENJOYING BOOM
YUMA, June 5. Yuma has started
out on a prosperous summer. A ba
rometer of prosperity which never
fails, is the county assessor's office,
ami when the office gives out the news
I that a month is a good business mouth
i there is no mistake in the information.
May was the largest month in the his-
I tory of the office and during that
month 11086 in fees were taken in
over the counter. Of that amount
more than 200 came from recording
placer mining claims. The oil boom
that wa3 Btarted jn Yuma a little over
a month ago reflected itself in the re
corder's office about $200 worth. The
next largest month in the history of
the office was January, 1918, when the
total receipts were $1020.

. MELON CROP DELAYED
YUMA, June 5. Unfavorable weath
er conditions have resulted in a heavy
financial loss to ; Cantaloupe growers
of the Salt River"' valley through the
immaturity of Jhejprop. .
Cool evenings , nave retarded the
growth of the fruit to the extent that
it will be nearly a month late on the
market. The crop itself has not been
seriously damaged, but Arizona grow
ers have heretofore secured the high
est quotations 'for their produce by
reason of being the first on the mar
ket. Maturity of the, crop depends largely
upon hot weather. Midday tempera
tures have been all that could be de
sired, but the evenings have been most
unfavorable to the growth of canta
loupes. TOMB OF ST. GEORGE

BISBEE BOY TELLS
OF WAR EXPERIENCES
UPON MANY FRONTS
TOMBSTONE, June 5. Glen Allen
Bouchey, a Bisbee boy who drove the
Tcnrbstone-Lisbee stage before going
into the ranks of the National army,
has seen much service across the
sea since he landed in France. He
was in Tombstone for a short while
yesterday visaing with friends, hav
ing, returned several' days ago to Bis
bee, and while here gave an account
of the various battles he had taken
part in during his service. Glen left
with a Cochise contingent for Camp
Funston, where he remained a short
wjiile, being then transferred to
Camp Kearney, San Diego, where he
was placed in the 158th, - Arizona's
Own, which was a part of the 40th
division. Training here for a while he
was then transferred to the Motor
Mechanics corps, where, after a short
period of training, he was finally
placed in the 112th Ambulance Com
pany of the 28th division, where he
remained. During his year of servicei
in France, Glen was in many battles
up in the front line trenches, carry
in wounded in his ambulance. He
first, saw duty in the fifth German of
fensive on the Ourcq and Vesle. Af
ter service here he was transferred
to the Meuse and Argonne sector,
where the Ariozna boys did them
selves proud. It was in the Argonne
that he was gassed where he was
sent to the hospital himself for re-'
covery. Recovering after a short
time, he again took up action in the
Thiacourt sector, where he remained
up until the signing of the armistice.
Here he met the other- Cochise coun
ty and Tombstone boys. During all
his service, he escaped without a
scratch from shell fire, the only time
he was away from the front being
when he was gassed.

' LUHCIIEONCLUB TOLD
The Big Berthas, waich fired shells
a distance of 75 mr.es into Paris, and
which wrecked many buildings in the
neighborhood of Paris during the. lat
ter months of hostilities, were an ac
cident. They were built for shorter
range than they covered. Thej were
a mystery to their makers when first
fired. The secret was discovered
only after several days.
These and many other interesting
facts of the French front and of the
days of war, were told members of
the Warren District Luncheon Club
at their regular meeting yesterday
noon at the Copper Queen hotel, when
Ira Jeralmon, veteran of the war, and
geologist for the Calumet & Arizona
company, addressed the club.
When the Big Berthas were . con
structed, declared Jeralmon, they
were intended by the Germans for use
in bombarding Amiens, then 25 miles
distant from their positions. The
great guns were wheeled into place

and fired. For several days observer
attempted to discover where the
shells were falling.
Finally, an aviator through accident
discqvered that buildings near Paris
and in the French capital were being
wrecked by mysterious shell fire. He
went back to his headquarters and
reported. Then a shell from one of
the big buns was tinned. The explos
ion occurred at ajiroximately the
time necessary for the projectile to
traverse the distance from the gun
to Paris.
Investigators then began studying
the mystery. They discovered that
the elevation at 'which the projectile
was fired was so great that the shell
reached the thin air where little fric
tion wa3 found. In this air it traveled
rapidly and much further than had
been anticipated. A few mathemat
ical corrections were made in the
aiming of the gun, and from that time
on the Germans could shoot as accu
rately at 75 miles as at 25.
These faots, Mr. Jeralmon. declared,
he obtained from a German military
officer after the armistice bad been
signed. He spoke for three-quarters
of an hour, giving many intimate il
lustrations and stories of the war.
The luncheon was attended by GO
members.

MALE JAZZERS GASP
AT BACKLESS GOWNS
IN DEAROL' LUNNON
LONDON, England, June S.The
backless gown has the men gasping
and grasping in all the Jazz parlors.
They are gasping at the slight cov
ering on the forms of their fair part
ners and grasping for a handhold on
the safe haven of a waistband.
Here and there a woman dances
with a tit of tulle about her neck to
give her a feling of something on
though her back be bare.
An excuse for a bodice in front, a
pair of shoulder straps to the waist
line in the back .thats. all there la to
the upper portion of the season's ball
gown.
A woman bends to fix her shoe. The
strap slips from a white shoulder, and
embarrassed escorts swing their part
ners to one side, while the women
dance on with fixed faces.
A woman in the thirties, with bob
bed hair and a sequin' frock ending
just below the knees dances by.
A girl in pink has a narrow skirt of
pink tinsel, a piece of tinsel tightly
stretched across the bust and pink
satin ribbon holding the waist band
up in the back. ...
Black, however, is the most popular
color, for black sets off dazzlingly the
fair skin of a back displayed from the
waist line up. ,
AERIAL LIFE DRILL
IS NEXT III ORDER
LONDON, June 5. As you step
aboard the big Mandley-Page you put
a light harness over the shoulders, to
which a ring is attached and take
your seat with the 30 odd passengers
in the travelers' compartment. Should
fire or other mishap occure in air, you
etep to the revolving door which
the emergency exit. An attendant
deftly hooks a life line to your har
ness and yew walk out onto the air.
The turning of the door opens the
case of your parachute outside and
as you drop clear of the machine, the
life saver, already partly opened by
breaker strips, spreads to its full
width and gently wafts you down to
Mother Earth. That's how the new
parachute device which has been in
vented lor tne Britich passenger
planes will operate.
LANDRU IS LUNATIC. ,
AUTHORITIES BELIEVE
PARIS, June 5 That Landru, the
Parisian Bluebeard, has a form of
erotic madness which impels its vic
tims to torture and destroy those for
whom they have affection, is a theory
which authorities now accept. An
other woman who sold her furniture
and disappeared and who left a sum
of money with her landlady which she
never claimed, is believed one of Lan
drus victims. She had announced
she was going to marry an engineer
who lived near Houdan, the nearest
station to Landru's villa. The French
recall la French history a story of
Gilles de Retz, whose crimes of
type of those charged to Landru are
paid to have been the origin of the
French version of Bluebeard.

medicine that did me as much good as
Tanlac has," said Elmer Doonan, of
434 Fisher avenue, Detroit, Mich., re
cently.
"It was what I read in the papers
about Tanlac that caused me to try
it," he continued, "and I want to pass
the good word along for the benefit
of others. For a long time I had rheu
matism bo bad that my hands and
wrists would swell up and pain me
terribly, and I would hardly be able
to sleep at night on account of my
sufferings. I would get up in the
morning feeling so tired and worn
out I could hardly drag myself off to
work. I got so bad that I was losing
time from my work and simply
couldn't keep up.
"After trying everything else with
out getting any better I got some Tan
lac, and it has done me a world of
good. I sleep fine, have a splendid
appetite, and am entirely relieved of
my rheumatism.''

BOOK ON POISONERS
IN BLUEBEARD HOUSE
PARIS, June 6. A book on cele
brated poisoners is among the arti
cles taken by the police from the villa
of Landau, the Parisian Eluebeard.
Landru was taken to the house while
the search went on, and sat huddled!
in a chair during the two. hours the
detectives kept him there. When
they left the place with him, there
were shouts of "Kill him!" from the
crowd which had gathered. Landru!
shrank back and turned pale with
fright. Women surrounded the clos
ed car into which he was thrust and
hammered on the windows and shook
their fists at the man accused of per
haps a score of murders.
Letters from his supposed victims,
linen marked with the names of some
of them and other articles were tak
en. From the pond which is being
dragged blackened bone, a womans
stocking and stones like those in
Landru's garden, smoke-blackened,
have been dragged. Most significant
of all, wa3 the discovery, buried un
der the wall of the garden, of three
pieces of skull and a part of a human
shinbone.
BRITISH WOULD DIVY

PARIS, June 5. The British aren't
as keen as they were for sinking the
German warships. They even begin
to see where some of them might be
a useful addition to the British navy.
The ships are most likely to be di
vided among the allies, but if they're
not, they will be broken up. Ships
20 years old are still in commission in

ARMY AUTOS WASTING
LONDON, June 5. Within 20 miles
of London ' thousands of army motor
cars and ' motorcycles are' rusting
away. Here and there is a rubber
neck wagon taken for troop transport
and a number of omnibusses and cater
pillar tractors are scattered aboit.
There are motorcycles by the hun
dreds, new ones in crates, cratefuls
or lorries and stacks of them piled up
like so much debris. Only here and
there does a tarpaulin cover a valu
able machine. Spare tires are attach
ed to many of the cars and spare parts
lie about in confusion. Two soldiers
are the only guard for this vast col
lection .and removal of tires and ac
cessories is a matter of ease for
thieves. Meantime, high prices are
being paid for much used cars for

SELL BRITISH LANDS;
SCATTER INVESTMENT
LONDON, June 5r-Breaking up of
the big estates in England Is scatter
ing British money widely. One land
owner who has sold rich soil for small
holdings has invested the proceeds in
a stretch of salmon river in Ireland,
with the belief that the Irish will be
the last people .in the world to con
sent to confiscation of land. Another
buys pictures and works of art which
pay no income tax and seem to have a
stable value. British Columbia and
the vineyards of southern France have
absorbed other large sums received
for British acres, i The government Is
buying heavily of the lands put on the
market in anticipation of enforced
breaking up of the big estates.

As president of the Board of Trade
he has been one of the big figures of
the war in England. The settlement
of the railway disputes which follow

to his tact and frankness with the
railway men.
Stanley was 11 when his parents

COUNTY FUNDS OF
NEAR S20.000
FOR
DISTRICT SCHOOLS
Large Apportionment Based
On Rapid Increase In
Attendance Shown
Schools of the Warren district will
receive between $15,000 and . $20,000
of the county reserve' school fund !
this year according . to information re-f
ceived yesterday by C, F. Philbrook.j
superintendent of the- local schools,
from: Miss Elsie Toles, county 6chool'
superintendent at Tombstone. The ,
apportionment is made on average j
school attendance for the entire year.
: The average school attendance' in '
the Warren district during the year
just closed has' been more than 400 "
greater,,.than during . the preceding
school year, according to the report;
of Superintendent Philbrook to the
county superintendent. This is great-j
er than the increase of the entire re-j
maining towns "and cities and rural
schools in the county. . ..
The county school reserve fund is'
provided by law to take care, of tfce.
expenses which arise from an increas
ed attendance in the schools. , Ten
per cent of all county school funds
are laid aside during the year. ; At .
the close of the year this accumulat
ed sum is divided in proportion among
the schools according to the Increase
in their attendance. '
With their average for the past
year this district will receive much ,
more than one-half, and probably as
much as two-thirds of the entire re
serve. the blanks thus left in the printed date
are filled by inserting, after the. word
"Arizona," February 6, and after the
figures "191," the figure "6." There
were not witnesses to the will.
