General Byng's troops In the Cam

tacking the Germans, who in a deter
mined thrust the day previous along
virtually the entire 18-mile front had j
thrown back the British from a few j
of the advanced positions they had
captured in their recent great drive.
Prompt counter-attacks by Byng's!
troops while the Germans were still j
trying to push forward on Friday
checked the Teuton advance before
it had gained too great an impetus.
For a time the situation looked seri
ous for the British, however, as the
German encircling movement toward
the south end of the salient, pivoting
on. the west bank of the Scheldt,
noitb. of Banteux, swung its left flank!
through Gonnelieu and on toGouzeau-'
court, one and a half miles back to;
the original British line, while its
center reached La Vacaquierie.
There was a hurried exodus of the .
British from the sector where envel-j
opment was threatened, and apparent-,
ly all but a few of the most exposed
parties got clear. Berlin, however,!
claims the taking of 4000 British pris-1
bners with several field pieces, and
dispatches from British headquarters
report-that the British blew up a'
number of their guns which were in
danger or falling into the enemy's
hands.
Retrieve Lost Ground
The prompt counter-attacks re-i
trieved much of the lost ground, in-!
eluding the towns of Gouzeaucourt
and La Vacquierie. where the pene
tration had been deepest, and on Sat-;
urday Byng's forces pushed the fight
ing in an effort for the further recov-,
ery of the lost ground. j
No admission of any retrograde i
movement by the British elsewhere
on the front of the attack has come:
from the London war office, although
Berlin claims to have thrown the
British back upon Graincourt, An
Deux and Cantaing along the norther
ly side of the salient. The Germans
seem to have gamed Initial successes;
In this sector, but apparently were,
driven back by the British counter-'
thrusts before they could establish!
themselves. j
German Losses Heavy
The German losses in the massed,
attacks are reported extremely heavy,
and Byng's forces also suffered con-,
Biderable casualties in repelling thai
assaults and in their vigorous coun-i
ter-drives. j
On the Italian front there have'
been no further efforts by the Austro-j
German forces to break into the Ital-
ian line. The attempt if one is to be
niade, is apparently awaiting the ar-j
rival of heavy guns, which are report-1
ed on their way to the front. General j
Iliad's armies appeared also to have
been largely reinforced, bo'h as re
gards men and artillery.
Berlin Reports Attack
On one sector they seem to have
taken the aggressive, probably in an
attempt to rectify their front slightly,
according to Berlin, which reports an
attack, declared to have been futile,
on the Monte Petricia, in the hills
between the Brenta and the Piave.
In Palestine, General Allenby'sj
troops, while not undertaking anyi

ITALIAN ARMY HEADQUARTERS
IN NORTHERN ITALY, Friday, Nov.
30. A colonel commanding batteries
along the Asiago front, where the Aus-
trians and Germans are exerang their
chief pressure, took the correspondent
along his lines today and explained the
sitarion and the action in progress.
From his observation post at the, sum
mit of the mountains flanking the Asi
ago plateau, one could lo'ok down on
the shell torn and deser:ed city of Asi
ago, now held by the enemy, with his
lines of entrenchments beyond and his
batteries blazing fro mthe long range
of summits extending from Monte Mel
etta eastward to the Brenta river.
It was a most impressive scene, at
an altitude of 5000 feet with the clouds
lying be.ow, instead of above, and the
cannonade echoing through the gorg.
es. The ground was covered with an
inch of snow which had fallen during
the night, and the ponds formed in
shell holes were coated with three
inches of ice.
Men Look Welt.
The men off duty were around camp
fires, looking well and contented. The
colonel said living conditions, rations
and supplies were in good shape.
Some of the men were in tents on
the mountain slopes, others in trench
es and dugouts, while others were in
rough frame barracks which are being
hastily constructed.
AsiagO itself presented a desolate
spectacle in the midst of the fire swept
plateau, to which it gives the name,
with the Italians on one side and the
enemy on the other. Houses, churches
and tall campaniles could be teen
plainly but the colonel said the whole
place was in ruins, without a building
intact. Strong field glasses showed
no sign of life in the town, and no
smoke I'jse from the factories or resi
dences. Artillery Fire Heavy.
Theartil lery fire was heavy and
continuous. The colonel said the ene
my was bringing up heavy guns of
larger calibre. Twenty monster pro
jectiles had come in a bunch early in
the day, opening great craters; which
were now frozen ponds. There had
been l infantry advances and the col
onel said, but the strength of the Ital
ian lines gave assurance that he would
be repulsed again.
Prisoners From Russian Front.
Austrian prisoners who had been
brought in declared that they recently
came from the Russian front. The
enemy lines were made up of Germans
and Austrian, but there were no Bul
garians or Turks. The wild nature of
this country was shown while the boI
diers were digging their trenches,
when they unear.hed the fossil re
mains Of numerous mastodons of gi
gantic dimensions.
Along the road leading to the front
there was increasing activity with vast
forces of men and material pushing
forward. The correspondent passed
batteries of heavy guns drawn by
trains, tractors and huge stacks of nine
and twelve inch shells. Infantry was
moving forward being strung a.Ong
the road for three miles. This and fre
quent evidence of troops on many
roads gave visible signs of the power
being concentrated, while on every
band the officers and men were confi
dent the great drive from the north
had been held as that from the Piave
side was held.
Slackers Will Be

With In Future
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1. Under the
new draft rules and regulations effec
tive December 15th men convicted of
falling to register on last June oth will
be dealt with more harshly than under
the old system. Provost Marshal.Gen
eral Crowder announced today that
such men, instead of being given jail
sentences as has been done in many
cases heretofore, will be so listed by
local boards as to insure their call with
the first increment summoned after
the new rules are put In force.
Local boards are ditected not to senu
the registration cards of the convicted
men to the state adjutant general for
serial number assignment but to place
them at the top of the first class liable
for call. Thus the men, it was pointed
ou:. will forfeit all chances of the mas
ter list ijtation except in cases wnere
physical conditions or the terms of the
law require exemption or deferred
classification.
Men now under suspended sentence
for failing to register also will be list
ed at the top of the first class, it was
announced.
A recent offer by the British admir
alty to decorate certain officers and
men of two American destroyers for
their sen-ices in combatting Germau
submarines was declined, according

Haig Continues
Attack Against
German Forces
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, Dsc. 1. (By Associated
Press). Field Marshal Haig's troops
today were continuing their counter
attacks against the German forces
who yeseerday penetrated the British
defenses in the Gonnelieu sector and
who pushed a considerable salient
into the British territory. Desperate
fighting was proceeding about Gon
nelieu this morning.
At an early hour of the forenoon
the Germans hud been pushed back
over a considerable amount of ground
which they overran yesterday. Gouze
aucourt, which they enemy held five
hours and represented their extreme
advance, was cleared a little after 3
o'clock yesterday afternoon, and later
me umisn operations resuueu iu me
Germans being pushed back from
Quentin ridge to the east of Gouzeau
court and from Guachewood, which
lies west of Villers-Guislaln. A little
further north in the La Vaequerie sec
tion the Germans also had been
forced to fall back.
Thus far the Germans have not re
newed their attack, either in the
Gonnelieu region or at the scene of
their disastrous failure yesterday
along the line from Moeuvres and
around Bourlon wood to a point near
Cantaing. However, it was known
that they brought Vp heavy reinforce
ments for yesterday's offensive and
the further attempts on their part to
oust the British from the newly won
territory in the Cambrai sector were
not unexpected.
The Germans in their northern at
tack met a complete reverse at the
bands of the counter-attacking Brit
ibh and the enemy suffered exceeding
ly heavy losses both in men killed
nd wounded. This attack extended
from a point just west of Moeucres.
about Bourlon wood and thence down
to the region of Cantaing.
WAGE INCREASE
DEMANDED BY
CLEVELAND. O.. Dec. 1. Demands
were presented to practically every
railroad in the country today for in
crease in wages for trainmen and
conductors, which are approximately
40 per cent higher than the present
scale. The general chairmen of the
two labor organizations presented the
wage scale to the general managers
of the railroads throughout the coun
try today. The railroads are asked
to make answer to the demands by
December 31 at the latest.
The railroad managers are request
ed to enter a collective movement for
the purpose of handling the proposi
tion at one and the same time through
a Joint committee representing all
railroads concerned and the two labor
organizations stand ready to do like
wise. Today's demand for increased wages
is the result of a referendum ote
taken by the two labor organizations
following the approval of the proposi
tion by the executive committee of
the several associations representing
the two organizations which met in
Chicago on November 1 to 4, inclusive.

there is no intention to recognize the

According to Gavronsky and Nord

"One thing sure, however, there will

Appoint Men In Each Dis
trict Mining men in this section who have
been thrown in.o a state of uncertain
ty following announcement that strict
regulations governing sale ot explo
sives had been put out, can now pt
ceed under the new law safely. The
new law providing for licensing every
dealer and handler of explosives went
into effect November 15.
A. C. Karger of Tombstone, clerk of
the board of supervisors, has been
named the official licenser of C'Jchise
county, having received his commis
sion of appoint men: several days age
together with all data governing the
issuance of licenses, blanks, etc., and
is now ready to issue licenses to peo
ple handling explosives in Toinbstvme
and vicinity. For the balance of the
county, where explosives are handled,
assistant licensers have been appoint
ed on recommendation of Mr. Karger,
and every person who handles or sells
explosives in any manner must procure
a license from Mr. Karger jr from one
of his assistants, wherever convenient
in the county.
Regarding the law and absolute ne
cessity of observance under the rules
and regulations, Mr. Karger today
quoted the following section from the
act as passed by congress and which
is now the law:
"Sec. 18. Any person violating any
of the provisions of this act or any
rijles or regulations made thereunder,
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and
shall be punished by a fine of not more
than $5,000 or by imprisonment not
more than one year, or by both such
fine and imprisonment.
""The object of the regulation of the
sale of explosives," said Mr. Karger,
'"is, as I "understand it, to curb the sale
of dangerous explosives to irresponsi
ble parties, which has been a great
source of trouble heretofore and par
ticularly during war time and I intend
to follow out the law, as far as my
position is concerned to the letter."

Tl'CSON. Dec. 1 A. S. Kmhree,
alleged leader of the I. W. W. oigan
izatinn among the strikers at Bisbee
last July, was acquitted of the charge
of rioting thin afternoon by a jury in
the superior court
Jn summing up. County Attorney
Ross cf Cochise county sought lo es
tablish constructive rioting when a
gang of strikers attacked a Mexican
wumrnan in presence of defendant,
and when defendant led a party of
pickets to a laundry at Bisbee and
the pickets were alleged to have
threatened to blow up the building.)
The summing up of A. A. Worsleyl
bore heavily upon the admitted Jn- j
structions by the defendant to the I
pickets to use peaceful methods, and
that the defendant had not taken a
personal part in the acts of violence.
The jury was out about five min
utes when they returned with a ver
dict of not guilty. Embree was re
leased immediately.
The trial of Embree, alleged ring
leader of the I. W. W. organization
in Bisbee, on a charge of rioting, end-J
ed Friday in the superior court.
During the trial the prosecution put
on as witnesses Deputy Sheriff Tom
Hargis, Frederick Orwig, James Alli
son and Mrs. Helen Grass. The de
fense called J. O'Donnell. W. X. S
Xeil, Frank W. Brown and A; D.Kim
ball Hargis testified to seeing Embree
on the picket line during the 1 W. W.
disturbances, and to hearing pickets
make threats of violence against
workmen who continued to work.
Quotes Embree't Speech
He did not hear E mbree make
threats, but he quoted from one of
his speeches as follows:
"The government is about to set the
price of copper and we want to get
our $6 a day flat before they do. We've
six of the biggest logging camps shut
down and practically every copper
mining camp in the west, and we are
going to tie up every copper mining
camp in the United States. You make
your demands. We dont give a damn
what they are. We'll stay with you
if you stay with us."
Hargis said that Embree at this
time was speaking as a representa
tive or the, Industrial Workers of the
World.
Would Dynamite Mines
Mrs. Grass testified to bearing a
striker declare that he was a machine
gun operator and that if the Strike
was not won he favored turning a
machine gun on the Copper Queen
dispensary, which was the headquar
ters cf the deputy sheriffs, and then
blowing up the mines while the work
men v-eie in the mines. .-'
Embree, who is a slight, wiry young
n an, tcok the stand and was exam
ined by A. S. Gillmore of Tombstone.
He said he was a member of the
executive council of the Me'al Miners'
unicn. He had lived in Bisbee for
eaily ?. year and had worked for the
C. and A. during that time as a
trucker. The committee was elected
at a meeting of the organization of
. iners. in their hall, about 100 -feet
"rrm the depot, where most of the
" 1"ns in Bisbee meet. The meeting
r.Trt held to draw up the demands of
the union, which were adopted by the
meeting and the committee was elect
ed to present the demands and give
power to call a strike if they were
refused. This meeting was held June
21. Subsequent to this the smelter
men's union adopted the demands, he
said.
Had Charge of Strike
After the strike began the commit
tee was in entire charge of the strike.
Their policy of the strike was to avoid
violence, he said. They warned the
pickets repeatedly against threaten
ing men going to work, and instructed
the men that they might walk beside
the men going to work and speak
biiefly to them. They were not to
call them "scabs" or hurt their feel
ings, believing they should be friend
ly and thus win. He said 80 per cent
of te men who quit had been gained
over that way. Usually the pickets!
said, "Be a man and join us." The
captains of the pickets held daily con
ferences with the committee, he said.
He, himself, visited most of the picket
lines every day. He told of speaking
in the city park, with the permission
of the mayor always, and of holding
a conference with Mayor Erickson.
Movie Fans Are
Feeling War Tax
When the Eagle, Orpheum and Lyric
theatres put into effect the govern
ment war tax on picture shows last
night there was an emphatic protest
from a few persons, although the bulk
of the movie fans made the best of it,
realizing that it is one of the many
hardships, large and small, imposed by
the war.
One man demanded his mony back,
declaring that he would not pay a war
tax. He did nJt say why he would
not pay it, whether because he was op
posed to war or favored Germany or
was just against all taxes on general
principles. Another patron, Husky
enough to make a good man in the
trenches, pushed on in anyway, refus
ing to miss his favorite picture and
refusing to pay.
The tax Is one cent tin a ten cent ad
mission and two cents on a twenty
rent admission. The two cents tax Is
the same whether fifteen or twenty-five
cents is charged.
Some people seem to think the pic
ture show management is responsible
for. or receives the benefit of this tax.
Nothing could be further from the
facts. It is a hardship on the theatre
managers. They have t'J make the one
cent change and loss of business and
In the development of social and
philanthropic governments in the
United States, there is no re-onl avail-;
able of any such phenomenal growth j
as that which the American lied Cross,
has shown during the last year. From j
an organization of leys than one hnn-j
dred thousand members, in a year it .
has grown to one of three millions and
the number is growing so rapidly that j
even the statisticians at headquarters
cannot begin to keep their totals ac-;
curate from day to day. The war has j
made the Red Cross a popular organ-1
ization and men and women are flock j
ing to the standard of mercy symbol-1
ized by the Geneva Cross and are pour- j
ing out their wealth and their ser-'
vice on behalf of the cause of strickci
humanity and the comforts and wel
fare of our boys In the trenches. !
This rupid development of the Amer-;
ican Red Cross has ranged a consid-'
erable number of anti-tuberculosis
workers to question what is going 'i
be the continued relation between the'
tuberculosis movement and the Amer-'
ican Red Cross. Probably no other '
single feature of Red Cross work has j
kept this organization before the pub- !

1908 to 1915 so much as the Red

Not Forgotten Tuberculosis. j
Will the war for democracy crowd i
out the interest of the American Red j
Cross in the war against tuberculosis?
This is the query arising in the minds
of many men and women throughout
the I'nited States. We are not in a
position to speak with authority for
the American Red Cross, but judging!
from conferences of- the national as
sociation for the study and prevention
of tuberculosis and the American Red
Cros3, there is no likelihood of any
cessation of interest on the part of
the latter organization in the cam
paign against tulierculosis. On the
ccntrary, the war has intensified and
must necessarily continue to intentfy
the interest of the Red Cross in whit
the tuberculosis agencies are doing.
We may say with some degree oi
authority and finality that tlte Ameri
can Red Cross does not desire to trans
fer the tuberculosis activities of any
community to its own chapter, but
that, on the contrary, it wishes to
fupport and strengthen the tuberculo
sis agencies and requests' its chapters
to co-operate to this end.
May Combine Activities.
Generally speaking, tuberculosis
agencies and the Red Cross chapters
may co-operate along such lines as
these:
. 1. By making the home service, of
the Red Cross chapters more effec
tive, particularly in relation to cases
of tuberculosis among soldiers and
sailors.
2. By supporting the Red Cross
with money and service both individ
ually and in groups.
3. By keeping in mind that the

had to cut out eating entirely and lr
a month I lived on nothing but milk. I
hardly knew what sleep was and more

A vote for a million dollar bond issue for permanent
highways is a vote for higher land value for the rancher
and dry farmer and more business for the merchant and
a great saving in time, money and temper for every citt
ten who has use for these roads.
Helpf A government expert predicts a poultry nl ort
age for the new year. And eggs seventy cents a dozen
now. It was common belief that a serious poultry short
age had been in full force and effect during all of the
present year. But if the worst is yet to come will some
one kindly predict the St. Patrick's Day price of eggs?
The German comeback at Cambrai has beer, something
ferocious to tell about. What this amateur mititary ex
pert would like to know, is. why is It that the victorious
British connot throw more troops and guns Into this sec
tor than the beaten Germans. The allies have tv-o men
aLd two guns on the western ront for every nan and
Cun the Teutons can muster. Yet a simptc civilian at
home must read these words in a recent dispatch: "The
Germans outnumbered the British and drove them "back
from Fontaine."
What fools these mortals be. Here is a British nianuis
one Lansdowne, who writes a letter that is t cross between
a white flag and a whine and It Is given publicity in ev
ery newspaper in the allied nations. How silly It Is to
promulgate pacifist doctrines in this way. This Lans
downe is probably of the same type as one or two of our
U. S. senators and propagandists and professors in this
country. All the British lords and knights are for the
war to a finish. This one figured be could attract more at
tention and notority by being against it. He figured
right. He gets first page In a thousand newspapers.
The. public likes to be humbugged. But as to why the,
ravings and piffle of this gentleman should be given a
second thought is past comprehension. He practically
stands alone In England, just as a score of pifflera and
hot air artists of this country stand alone In their atti
tude towards this war. v'
The Sunday Sermon
' On next Tuesday will be held the bond election that
means a million for road? In Cochise county or another
year of jolting anr jarnng and Jerking over rough high
ways. The new roads to be provided for by this bond
issue are to be built alorg permanent lines. Otherwise
the money would be thrown away. They are to be built
only along main traveled ways, which is to say the old
roads will be rebulit. Probably eight property owners
out of every ten in the county own a vehicle of some kind
that they drive over the roads for purposes of business
or pleasure. Not one of these voters but that would be
-indignant if accused of being a mossback or an Arkansas
'Traveler who did not need shingles on his roof when the
sun shone and could not shingle it when it rained. Yet
the man who votes against this bond issue is just as bad
as the Arkansas Traveler ever dared to be; just as shift
less; just as selfish; just as heedless of his own and bis
community interest. Pride, self-interest and economy de
mand good roads. Here and there can still be found a
man who argues that he is not voting to spend fount y
money far roads for "those autouiobilists." lie is talk
ing through his hat, and he knows it. "Those automobil
ists" are composed of men on lousiness bent as well as
pleasure. Every second ear on l lie roads of this county
today Is on a business, not a pleasure trip. The farmer,
the drayman, the official, the messenger, the salesman,
the doctor, the carpenter, the teacher, all travel our roads
daily from county bonier to lorder upon tlictr daily
taks to earn their daily bread. The summer rains have
washed our old roads away and the winter drouth and
winter winds have blowu away what the rains left. Iu

and unusually competent board of couuty commissioners.
TJ'o time, therefore, to start real road work is NOW!
If we dawdle around another year or two we will have
no roads at all to rebuild and we will have to spend
thousands and thousand of dollars upon makeshift high
ways and then spend it over again every year. Vole

"And the sons of the prophets 'said unto Elisha,
Behold, now, the place where we dwell before
thee is too strait for us. Let us go, we pray
thee, unto the Jordan, and take thence, every
man, a beam, and let us make a place where we
may dwell. And he answered. Go ye." II
Kings 6-1 and 2.
And it is so to this day. Not only the sons of the
prophets, but the sons of men who know not what tomor
row may bring, come to their fathers and say, "the place
where we dwell before thee is too strait for us." And
they go from the old home and the roof tree and the vil
lage street and the country lane to distant cities and
to lands across the sea. . .
It must be that the Lord Himself placed the wander
lust and the desire for distant places in the hearts of
His children so that His world, that He settled only in
one spot, might be Inhabited in all Its places.
From the sheltered school of Ramah the prophets set
forth to the Jordan, each man carrying his beam. How
many boys have gone down to the little depot of their
old home town, carrying only a cheap telescope grip and
a brave heart and been hauled away to the city by a
little engine. Going don to Jordan, each man carrying
his beam. But many of these boys come back in a private
car and carrying as much weight as a millionaire.
This canyon and this camp may well bless the restless
ness that in men's hearts does dwell. For every rich and
cultured city of the east and north gave of its children
from these strait places when the wide sweep of the
southwest called them. And each man brought his beam.
his talent, his skill, his strength, his faith, and made a
place wherein to dwelL A pleasant place they made of
it, and prosperous and permanent as welL
The heart of man remains the same throughout the
ages. As the prophets were, so are we today. The sky
line beckons, the seas sing a siren song, the mountains
call, the distance lures us on. Ever to some new place.
The hills look green far away.
So it was that Japhet, Noahs greatest son, left Asia,
the old mother of nations, and pressed on to Europe,
taking his beam with him. His children builded Athens
and it was too small and strait for their children, and
they builded Rome. "Let us go, we pray thee," said the
children of barbarian kings in the wooded fastnesses of
Europe, and Paris and London and Edinburg were build
ed by the beams they carried with them down to the
Jordan of their dreams.
And their children were seduced by the sea and sailed
on the ships to this land. But the Atlantic seaboard
was too narrow and strait a place for their children and
the long procession streamed across the continent until
their steps were staid by the Pacific. They peopled the
plains and filled the valleys with grain and dug deeply
nto the mountains and dammed the rivers and cut the
forests and created a new and greater empire every
century of their four thousand year journey from the
plains of Abraham to San Francisco Bay.
The people of this town should know as well as any in
the world today the feeling that stirred the hearts of
the sons of the prophets when they asked Elisha if they
could go unto the Jordan where there was more room and
more chances and more work to do. For surely the chil
dren of all New World cities are assembled here. Called
to the high places and the mountain towers and desert
straud .by a voice they knew not and a feeling they
could not fathom. But surely all is well with us today.
It was a good voice and true that called. Did not Elisha,
the wisest and godliest of the prophets, say. "Go, ye,"
to his children when they sought a new place?
Yes, all is well with us here. The grind and toll of
the cities are far behind us. Days that were too heavy
and nights that were too gay are of the past.. Failures
of yesterday have not to do with today. Like those
prophets' sons of thirty centuries ago, we have made a
place where we may dwell.
And some day, each one of us, like those same prophets'
sons of old; will say unto a greater One than Elisha:
"Behold, now, the place where we dwell before Thee Is
too strait for us; let us go, we pray Thee, unto Jordan."
And He will say, "Go, ye." Ah, that will be the laFt
journey for our wandering and restless feet. West of that
land there is no west. All ends there. Let us hope
for a brave heart and a steadfast soul to make the
journey. Let us hope for a Friend in the New Land.
Of Noah's sons the wandering Japhet builded best.
When the Master calls His children home maybe those
who wandered farthest over hill and dale will find a
place there where they may rest By our work and play
in the shadows of this mortal woe shall we be judged
in tbo immortal light.
Let us take our beam of patience aud kindness and
courage and laughter amid tears and build as best we
know. For a Voice is calling us, one by one, and whether
we will or not. we must all press on and leave our work
behind, but our record we must hear in our hands.
The German high command is continuing its pleasant
little Belgian practices in Italy, aud even introducing
new wrinkles In the way of cruelty, outrage and oppres

MONGRELS ARE THESE,
BUT THEY DELIGHT
A BOY'S HEART
Standing upon his own back porch
the other morning, tbe newspaper man
saw in his backyard a mouse colored
burro and. a yellow dog that might
have been a cross between a dasch
und and a sheepdog, if one should
judge from his looks. They were neith
er fish nor fowl, these two. They be
longed neither to the dog kingdom nor
that of the mule. Outcasts, both ot
them. Beyond the pale. Insignificant,
humble, plebeian and unclassified.
Homely as sin. Awkward and ungain
ly. But even while the newspaper man
mused upon these things two small
boys hove into view and while one
rushed to the dog to pet him the other
went into raptures over the burro. The
dog was fed and the cockleburrs pluck
ed from the burro's eyebrows by loving
hands. And when the newspaper
man went away the four of them were
thick as thieves, the two boys and nhe
two derelicts of the animal kingdom.
And yet, after all. the boys may be
right and the newspaper man wrong.
What pedigreed, blueblooded, hand
some dog can vie with the mongrel
cur in faithfulness and love to his
small master? Blessed are the meek. ;
for they shall inherit Ahe earth. If
there is anything that moves and
breathes that is meeker than a yel
low dog and a fuzzy burro, the news
paper man has yet to see it.
A solemn faced, sad eyed burro and
a poor little old yellow dog. But they
were things ot beauty and joy forever
for these .two boys. There Is some
subtle sympathy between them and the
right sort of a boy. He will oppose I
parental authority to the verge of re
bellion to feed and shelter them and
load them with kindness and affection.
You can almost judge a boy's char-
of those fellows with an armoured car
. could have taken any town In Sonora
i before breakfast and beld it 'till their
food and ammunition run out.

I'll bet that Madero's own family did

over bis demise."
The Bisbee man bung his head In

ment that he will soon regain the

CAMP FUNSTON QUARANTINE.
Word was received here yesterday
from a Douglas bey at Camp Funston
saying that on November 20, a case of
spinal meningitis was discovered
among the selected men from Arizona
and they were quarantined until
November 30, and that no letters were
permitted to leave the camp until the
quarantine was lifted. As the restric
tions were to have been removed Fri
day, il is expected that the mall from
Fort Riley to Arizona will be aug
mented during the next few days.
SURFACING STARTED
The road gang in the Government
Diaw have begun the work of surfac
ing the new road bed between the
Draw and the Narrows and have com
pleted 400 yards of it in the past few
days. The grade bas been completed
about three miles beyond the Draw
and the cement dip across the Draw
bas been completed and is now in
use by the teams hauling the caliche
for surfacing. The work of surfacing
will move along rapidly, as several
beds of caliche have been opened up
along the new road so that the haul
ing will not be of any great draw
back. ENLISTMENTS CLOSE
Voluntary enlistments- in the na
tional or regular army will end De
cember 15 for men between- 21 and
31. according to special instructions
received at the recruiting stations di
rect from Washington. Hitherto the
stations have been permitted to take
men of draft age who have not been
called. The new order makes it im
possible for a man of drafting age to
enter the army voluntarily, unless he
makes up his mind to enter between
new and December 15. It also indi
cates that the next call to arms will
be more sweeping than the first and
may include all the men of the draft
ing age. After December 15 voluntary
enlistment . will close for all except
men who are between 18 and 21 and
31 and 40 years of age.
MARRIAGE LICENSES
The following marriage licenses

SHAMMING INSANITY '
Advices received here yesterday
from Tombstone are to the effect that
Fred Koch, who tried to rob the First
National bank in Tombstone a few
weeks ago and seriously wounded T.
R. Brandt, the cashier, at the same
time, is trying to work the insanity
dodge, and during the past two days
has tried to develop signs of insanity,
with the hope that he will be sent to.
the insane asylum instead of being
sent to the state penitentiary. His
ear drums have been affected with a
cold and he is suffering some from
them. The officials are watching his
movements and he will not be able to
make that play stick. He will prob
ably be tried at this session of tne
superior court on a charge of attempt
ed robbery, and if convicted sent to
the penitentiary. Should Mr. Brandt
die from the effects of his wounds
Koch could then be brought back and
tried for murder.
REVIEW WANT .DS FOrl RESULTS
ION
IGNORANCE OF LAW
WON'T HELP DRAFTEES
A warning to all men who have
moved or changed their addresses
since they registered tor military
service is being sent out by General
Crowder, advising such men to notify
their local boards immediately of such
change in address.
This is in order that the men will
gte their questionaires, which will be
sent out to every man beginning De
cember 15. Registrants are required
to keep their local boards advised of
all change of address and to keep
themselves posted on the selective)
draft law. General Crowder has sent
a telegram to Governor Campbell
calling attention to the danger con
fronting men who have changed their
addresses since registering. It reads
in part:
"Please cause the widest possible
publicity to be given of the warning
to registered men who have changed
their places of abode and postofflce
addresses. AH such registrants must
communicate immediately with the lo
cal boards where they are registered
and furnish their present addresses
so that questionaires which will be
mailed December 15 reach such regis
trants without delay.
"Registrants are bound by law to
keep themselves advised of all pro
ceedings in respect to themselves.
and failure to do so may result in
their losing the right to claim exemp
tion or discharge."
The attention of H registered men
is called particularly to the last para
graph of the general's telegram, for
Kb meaning affects every man. It is
well known that the government will
not be so lenient with men who run
afoul of the law in the next draft as
was the case in the last draft.
According to the law ,a man out
side of the jurisdiction of the local
where he Is registered cannot procure
a questionaire from the nearest local
board, fill it out and send it to his
own local board. Each questionaire
is sent out addressed to the individ
ual, with his serial number and order
number stamped on it. This is the
only questionaire that the man will
be allowed to fiH out and return to
his local board. Phoenix Republican
YUMA COTTON LAND
BRINGS HIGH RENTAL.
Three hundred and twenty acres of
Yuraa valley farming land has been
rented for three years at 130 per acre
per year. The total consideration is
J28 200. This convincing proof of the
high estimation in which the fertile
acres of the Yuma project are held
was offered Friday, when O. P. Bon
dessen leased to W. S. Blair of the
valley his place of the area men
tioned, near Somerton.'
The lessee already has put a large
force of men and teams on the place
and is giving it thorough preparation
for a bumper crop of cotton next
year.
A feature of the lease is a clause
providing that the lessee next yeai
shall release from the o pert ion of the
agreement the 10 acres lying nearest
to the town of Somerton, upon which
the Somerton Woman's club has an
option. The provision refers to the
owner's generous action in favor of
the club. He has agreed to Bell to
that body the 10 acres in question at
its original cost to him, 86 an acre,
plus the actual cost of leveling and
other necessary improvements which
he has made on the property.
This amounts, practically, to a gift
to the club of a very substantial
amount, as land that can be rented
at the rate mentioned is worth sev
eral times the price stipulated in the
option.

The Cananea Consolidated Copper

Gcially announced here today by an of-:
flcial of the company. j
The differences with the Mexican .
government have all been settled and
it is believed the mill will be in op
eration by December 15. The only '
thing that is now delaying actual work
on the property is the receipt of the
necessary supplies, these have been
ordered and the men leaving here for
Cananea will take them in.
Application has been made to the
government at Washington for per
mission to take the supplies into Mexi
co and foodstuffs that are now on the
embargo. - Inasmuch as the Four C's is
so- large producers of copper and that
the government is so in need of the
red metal it is not believed any dif

Shattuck Heads
Greatly Pleased
With Showings
Finding grading under way for the
new mill which is to cash a million
tons of lead-silver ore from their mine,
with things in the mine going much
better than they had anticipated could
be the case s'j soon after the period of
near close-down, Vice President Mun
day and Secretary-treasurer Chisholm
of Shattuck-Arizona expressed them
selves last evening as highly pleased
with their visit to the district, which
commenced on Thursday when they
arrived from Duluth.
General Manager L. C. Shattuck of
Shattuck-Arizona has been busy with
the visiting officials of the company,
showing them thfjugh the workings
and making general inspection of the
property.
With other members of the official
family or Shattuck they are proud of
the rapid bringing back of the proper
ty to efficiency, and prouder still of the
culmination which Is now in sight of
the work followed with steadfastness
and a great deal of ingenuity during
the last year to the end of making the
values or lead-silver ores of the mine
quickly available.
This achievement not only puts the
Shattuck in the way of adding to its
monthly 'contribution to war metals
which the government needs, but also
to the increased revenues which the
government will have coming due from j
greater Shattuck earnings. The latter i
will also represent a considerable item 1
to stockholders or the company.

BASE OP BRITISH GRAND
FLEET. Dec. 1. The hand of the
British admiralty, speaking the other
day in the house of commons, flung
out a challenge to the German nary.
He said: "I disclose no secret, or, if
it a secret, I disclose a fact which I
should be glad to tell the enemy
when I say that the British grand
fleet ro its northern base lies behind
no shore defenses, but relies on its
own strength alone."
There are people in the United
States who do not appreciate the ac
tivities of the British nary in its
home waters; who think that it lies
in idleness, like Xhe German high seas
fleet, behind impenetrable landlocked
bases. - For the purpose of removing
this impression the Associated Press
representative was aakefl to visit the
grand fleet, live on board the first
line battleships, and observe just
what sort of a day's work it puts in
day after day and week after week. !
Ceaseless activity is the motto of
the grand fleet. Neither men nor ships
are permitted to gather rust or barna
cles. From its base at the northern
tip of the British isles it sweeps day
and night the 140.000 square miles of
the North sea on ceaseless vigil, in
unflagging hope . that one day its
watching will be rewarded by a meet
ing with the enemy - under circum
stance wherein he cannot avoid bat
tle. Moreover, this sweeping of the
North sea is no mere aimless patrol.
In the most, casual moves of ships
and men .there is always a directing
mind and a directing hand. The North
sea is as well swept in relation ot its
size as the drawing room of a well
ordered house. The enemy's coast
line is still the British navy's fron
tier. : - f
The harbor -which has been the
home of the grand fleet ' for three
years- is probably the finest of its
kind in the world. The whole area
comprised in this British northern
base is about equal to the hundred-!
odd square miles which the Germans
evacuated in France last spring. The
battleship squadron. - for example,
withaf their own particular section of
this treat base, have room for every
kind of practice maneuvers, including
target' practice.
On a sunny afternoon the corre
spondent ' saw eight battleships at
turret or target practice, a detach
ment of cruisers in maneuvers, a seaplane-balloon
ship at work under con
ditions simulating those of actual war
fare, and off around the edges various
operations by inaieAueraic jmullcraJt
and auxiliaries. .
Night target practice, which Is also,
conducted within the. harbor, is al
waysn interesting eight: The battle-,
ships : steam down the nine-mile
course. Suddenly a searchlight picks
up a target Instantly every turret is
trained, every gun directed. Then a
button is pressed somewhere, and the
guns speak as with one voice in a gi
gantic broadside that , awakens the
echoes from the hills.
There is an infinite variety to the
turret practice on a big battleship.
The officer in charge of the turret
speaks: "An enemy shell has come in
through the turret, killing men num

abled. Connection with rest of ship
lost. Carry on." The "dead men"
file off to one side and watch their
comrades work as they would in ac
tual battle, There is the zest of a
game to it.
The officer speaks again: "Shell
has hit turret, killing all men except
numbers I and 3. Number 3 is seri
ously wounded. Ammunition hoisting
machinery disabled. Fire started in
pile of waste behind gun. Carry on!"
The single unwounded man left in the
turret must now endeavor to keep the
guns in action single-handed, besides
dealing with a fire and a seriously
wounded man. The "dead men" stand
along the edge of the turret and
watch their comrade's efforts to "car
ry on" with interest and amusement.
It is play, but play with a deadly
efficiency behind it, for it is intended
that in actual battle there shall not
be a single possibility with which
these men will not be ready to deal.
WEATHER CONDITION
CAUSES ZEPPELIN
FAILURES HUNS SAY
AMSTERDAM, Dec. 1. The German
official view of the disaster which be
fell the Zeppelin fleet in France, is
that the loss of several airships was
due entirely to weather conditions
whica are unlikely to occur again. It
is asserted that the disaster is not
regarded as any argument against the
use of the Zeppelin as a military wea
pon. The official Allgemeine Zeitung
says:
"Enemy reports at first stated that
as many as six Zeppelins had been lost,
but it is now indisputably established
that only four were brought down.
The real and only cause of the disaster
is to be found in the abnormal weath
er conditions. One of those who took
part in the journey states that the fog
on the coast was so dense that it was
impossible to see farther than three
to five yards. '
"A loss of four Zeppelins is not a
matter of indifference even for the
German air service, but the principal,
and at the same time satisfactory, fact
remains, however much we may de
plore the accident ,htat the destruc
tion of the airships wan not the result
of English counter attacks, bet af
solely owing to a concatenation oi
unfortunate circumstances.
"We cannot be surprised if England
seizes the opportunity for using our
niisforturfe as soothing syrup for he:
population, which has lately had over
much experience of what war means
through the agency of our air raids
In the end it will no doubt turn out
to our advantage if the English do
lose faith in reliability of our Zeppe
lins; the more secure the English peo
pie feel themselves to be, the better it
will be for our airships the next time
they make an attack, for they will b(
undisturbed.'

PRIORITY REQUESTS
CAUSING CONFUSION
COMMISSION SAYS
WASHINGTON. Dec. 1 Requests
from different government quarters
for priority of transportation for food,
fuel and munitions has thrown the
whole question of preferential ship
ment into a tangle. The committee
on priority of transportation of which
Robert S. Lovett is chairman, was try
ing tonight to clear the situation.
Act'ng on the suggestion of Fuel,
Administrator Garfield, the general op
eration committee of the eastern rail
roads today gave coal and coke ship
ments right of way to clear congested
terminals. Dr. Garfield has requpsted
of the priority committee a general
order giving coal the tracks.
Tonight the food administration an
nounced it had entered a strong pro
test with the priority, committee
against giving priority over food ship
ments to coal or any other freight.
Government Department Confused.
The situation is further complicated
by demands of the war and navy de
partments for preferential rights to
the movement of their supplies.
At the offices of the priority com
mittee none would say what materials
would be given preference and some
officials suggested that the "question
might be taken up by the war council
comprising department heads and the
chairmen of the various government
bodies and commissions.
Railroads Want Time.
The railroads, in responding to Dr.
Garfield's request that coal be moved
aiead of general freight asked that
a general priority order for coal be
withheld until the roads hare had an
j opportunity to test their plan -Jor
pooling equipment and trackage. Re
cently they announced that there was
no objection to general priority orders
but declared that demands for prefer
ential movement for specific ship
ments had done much to complicate
the railroad congestion.
In explaining its request that noth
ing be put ahead of food shipments,
the food administration said the ne
cessity of moving livestock and per
ishables and corn, oats 'and animal
feeding stuffs generally is pre-eminent
or large amounts of foodstuffs
would be lost. .
Unionists Cheer
Resolutions for
War Continuance
LONDON, Dec. 1. An authorized re
port concerning the unionist meetin?
cf Friday says it was attended by 1.50C
representatives of unionist bodips
throughout the country, and that res
olutions were unanimously carried de
ploring the publication of the letter or
the Marquis of Iansdcwne and declar
ing firm adherence to the war aim:
of the allies, as defined by the pre
mier, Mr. Bonar Law and Mr. Asquith
A scene of great enthusiasm ensued
the delegates rising and singing thr
national anthem. Mr. Bonar Law thee
delivered a speech in which he ad
mitted that he had never met any one
more patriotic or disinterested thar
the Marquis of Lansdowne. Never
tlieless. Mr. Bonar Law snfd:
"I disagree absolutely not only wit!
the arguments but with the whole torn
of the letter. I think it is not! in
less than a national misfortune th;r
it should have been published, now o:
all times. H is not that we do not de
sire peace. It is horrible to lock foi
ward to a continuance of the war; In;
i is a strange assumption that be
cause the Germans' dec lare their read
iness for a pact of nations and tall
of disarmament that peace iherefon
is possible.

but the Germr.i rei;arded it almos
as a casus belli. And before the wa
books recommending disarmamen'

lieve they are prohibited to this day
"You heard nothing of this kind it
the first and second years of the wat
when things were going well in Gr
many. If the conclusion of peace werr
conceivable today it would mean tha
the very men who, in my judgment
committed the greates't crimes in his
tory who plunged the world into an
guish and misery, would be left agair
in power with the same machinery
ready to repeat the same thing whei
the opportunity arose in the future.
"How can they be bound in a pact
of nations? Nobody will pretend tha'
they will be bound because they signer'
a treaty and what force is to hint1
them? The whole- world is stains
them today, armed and organize: ii
a way that it is not likely they will
again be; and if we cannot insist on
our rights now, "how will we fight
against them in new conditions here
after?
"No, gentlemen, it is horrible to
think of, but it is true; in my judg
ment we have got to shew the German
nation in tlie only way they can be
made to realize that war does not pay:
thattheir military machine cannot
pet the desired results. It is only ! y
decirlve military results that the wa-
can be ended. Let the Germans re
alize that we can go on longer tl?a!
they, and the change of ftM-lins in
Germany of which we hear so much
will grow dally and will itself, per
haps, bring the results' we all long to
see." -
Mr. Bonar Law intimated that should

COMMUNITIES CAN
HELP SAVE FUEL
DIRECTOR SUGGESTS
(Special to the Review)
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Dec. 1. Will L. :
Clark, state fuel administrator, has,
issued a general cirsular clearly de-1
fining the condition now governing
the sti-te coal supply. During the
past week there has been some com-1
pliration owing to a short walkout of,
the miners at Gallup. N. M., who re-j
turned on promise of the operators to
put into effect the 4-cent per ton in- j
crease allowed by governmental or
der in other fields.
This would appear to involve allow
ance of further price increase on do-:
mest'c coal where though only about
25',: of the mine output has to bear!
practically all the burden. The en-;
gine coal, slack and screenings now
are under contract for the railroads
and copper mines at low prices. i
Mr. Clark suggested that communi-;
ties ran help in the situation by con-;
ference between the local fuel com-'
mittees, officers and dealers. He
urges that coal men should feel that
they are in the front line of indus-l
trial trenches as handling an essen
tial basic commodity. He expresses
the opinion that at the end of the war!
the miners, operators and retailers
will be found entitled to commenda
tion, notwithstanding the present se-;
ries of regulations and complications!
they are undergoing. The national au- j
thorities urge that there could be a
large coal saving by the tightening up;
of dratty houses and the cleaning of
furnaces and flue pipes, as soot is a
poorer conductor of heat than asbes- j
tos. , . , ',
There is general shortage in the
United States of 50,000,000 tons thia
year. Labor difficultly continue; re-1
lief involves curtailment of shipment
of non-essential products and there is
continuance of railroad car shortage. ,
Mr. ('lark has advised the administra-J
tion of the benefit from quick adjust-!
ment ol mine prices. He concludes:
"It is distressing but Inevitable that !
domestic coal prices will continue high i
for the rest of the winter."

as yet in any of the industries directly
related to military operations, but as
the army expands, it is expected that
many factories will need hundreds
of additional men. At the same time
unemployment is expected to result in

Bisbee may loose its red light dis-j
tri. t in the efforts of the United !
I States government to clear up the

! wove the vice stigma. It is not gen-1

the rast three weks of the conditions
that exist here in the red light dis

Evidence has been gathered by the

Annual Report of Secretary of Arizona Mining Congress
Shows Many Items of General Interest $291,365,145

Over 1000,000,000 Pounds More Copper Will Be Made In
State This Year Than In Previous Banner Twelve Months
But for Strikes Would Have Attained to Near Billion
Pounds, or Half of All American Metal.
Estimating Arizona copper production for the year at around 750.000,000
pounds, or nearly 100.000.000 pounds in excess or the 1916 production despite
I. W. W. and other radical labor element disturbances of efficiency during
the summer, and showing around 565,000.000 pounds produced during the
first nine months of the year, with attendant disbursement of more thar
$100,000,000 in the production of the metal, hn advanced copy of the annual
report of Secretary Jospph E. Curry of the Arizona Chapter of the American
Mining Congress is found to set forth a great deal of general interest about
Arizona's greatest Industry. The report will be submitted at the annual
meeting of the Arizona Chapter which will assemble in Phoenix tomorrow.
In part It is as follows:
"The office of the secretary during the present year has given its princi
ple effort to tarrying out the wish of the governor of the chapter and its
executive board that it be made plain to the nation that the mining industry
and all citizens associated with it in Arizona stand solidly behind the adminis
tration at Washington and voluntarily pled-red to do everything possible to
assist the government.
"In doing this there has been much endeavor given to urging subscriptions
to the Liberty loan bond Issues, to the furtherance of Red Cross and Y. M.
ik i. t,.A., ooonnomorit nt tha tnnd conservation eamnaiens.
" '
as well as to urging all possible efficiency in the mining and the agricultural
sections of our state, the improvement of roads against the coming of possible
emergency conditions which may deprive us in part or whole of railroad
transportation facilities, and in other war time endeavors In keeping with
the wth or the people of Arizona and of all the country to do their utmost.
Individually and collectively, for the furtherance of the nation's cause. '
"Other work of the office of the secretary has been directed to carrying
out the wish of the governor and executive board of the chapter that as much

Burro Mountain Ores In New Mexico Susceptible to Same
Manner of Treatment as That Which Will Be Conducted
In New Ore Reduction Plants of Copper Queen In This
District .'
The' following highly interesting ac
count, written by Courtenay De Kalb.
is taken from the current issue of the
Mining and Scientific Press:
La.-ge-scale leaching tests have been
conducted for a period of nearly eight
months at the Copper Queen mines at
Bisbee, Arizona, following work for
three years in precipitating ' copper
with scrap-iron, in preparation for
handling the disseminated sulphide
ore recently developed in. Sacramento
hilL The orebody. as tested by drill
ing, and further confirmed by under
ground exploration, has shown a large
tonnage, some of, which is of a grade
suitable for smelting without previous
concentration. The larger volume,
however, with a tenor averaging about
Wifi copper, wilP be treated by flo
tation. In addition, large tonnages
that assay no higher than 0 9 to V',
copper will be available. This lower
grade ore will be leached and it is
proposed to treat it in heaps, taking
advantage of the reactions that occur
through oxidation when the mass is
treated with the requisite amount of
water. The principle, of course, is the
same as that long utilized at the Rio
Tinto mines in Spain, but the details
whereby the system is made adapta
ble to' American conditions hare been
evolved by Joseph Irving, who is in
charge of the operations at Bisbee.
The novel ieatures introduced into
the proems re found chielly in the
precipitation, which will bo consid
ered first. As now conducted, taking
into account the existing costs of sup
plies and labor, the entire process
has demonstrated a recovery of S0r
of the copper in the ore, at a cost of
20c. per ton for transporting the ore
from the mine to the leach-yard, build
ing it the heap, and disposing of the
tailings;- 20c. for leaching; and 60c.
for precipitation, including cost of iron
consumed, charging current rates for
the scrap-metal. The ore treated ir,
the experimental heaps has averaged
1.23' ( copper, yielding 20 pounds cement-copper'
per ton of ore. The ce
ment is obtained as an unusually high
grade" product, assaying 607t copper.
The cost of the whole operation, there
fore, is only 5c. per pound of copper
recovered. To obtain the total cost
of the copper there must be added
the cost of mining, shipping of the ce-ment-cepper
to the refinery, melting,
poling and casting.
It will be seen that the precipita
tion is the most expensive step in the
process. When applied on a larger
scale this cost will be reduced, of
course, and improvements are even
now being made that will effect fur
ther economy. At the present time an
average of about 400,000 gallons of
solution is passed through the preci
pitation vats daily. Only 70,000 gal
lons of this comes from the leach
yard; the remaining 330,000 gallons
consists of water from the Czar shaft,
which contains about 63 grains of cop
per per gallon. The experiments in
precipitation were conducted on the
mine-water for a period of nearly three
years before "heap-leaching" was tried.
The possibility of economically reduc
ing tlie ferric to ferrous salts by the
use f Mr. Irving's pyrite filter was
thus proved, and this paved the way
for succesHfully treating the low-grade
sulphides developed by drilling the dis
seminated granite-porphyry ore on Sac
ramento hill. As a preliminary to the
precipitation of the copper from the
mine-water it is essential to eliminate
the solids carried in suspension. The
larger portion of the solid matter' is
removed by diverting tlie 'water
through shunt-tanks where the check
ing of the current causes it to settle.
Most of what remains is then caught
In the pyrite filter.
The arrangement of the shunt-tank
is illustrated in the accompanying
sketch (Fig. H. where F. is the flume
carrying the mine-water, S the diversion-launder
Vith a gate G. which may
he changed so as to close either the
flume F, or the diversion-launder S.
T is tlie tank, 32 feet long, 8 feet wide,
and 6 feet deep. The tank is provided
with a discharge-door, D, near the 'bot
tom, for flushing out the accumulated
sediment. About 400 cubic feet of
sludge Is fettled from the mine-water
in thre9 months, and it assays from
0.3 to Kr copper.
Fil'ration and Reduction. After the
coarser material has been settled the
waters are conducted to the filtration
vats at the head of the precipitating
plant. As originally designed it was
intended to use fix vats, in each of
which would be placed approximately
40 to 45 tons of pyrite ore to serve as
a filter. The vats are round and are
ma'le of 3-in. redwood. As now con
structed, tlie solutions are caused to
flow downward through vertitel box
pipes at the side and then to pass up
ward through the filter-bed. discharg
ing it the opposite edge of the vat in
to a 1 It. by 10-in. daunder. The filter
is composed of pyritic ore. from '2 to
1 in. diameter, with some fine mate
rial, assaying about 'i'.'c copper. The
bed is 2Vj. to 3 ft. deep, and is sup
ported upon a wooden grating resting
en 4 by bin. beams. The solution
flow through eaili filtration vat at
the rate o. luu gallons per minute, and
!lie f'l'er retains 75'i of the solid mat
ter still in buspension. in adlition, the
pyrite ton verts the ferric salts iu the
mod
OFT
solution into ferrous salts, thereby sav
ing, iron in the subsequent precipita
tion. It does more than this; the
rapid corrosion of iron in the preci
pitation tanks when ferric salts are
: abundant would add to the amount of
: corroded iron-scale, . which becomes
detached and accumulates in
! the cement-copper. It also provides
acid which maintain a "sweet" c'ondi-
tion of liquor in the precipitating tanks
'and prevents settling of basic iron
J salts, thereby Improving the recovery.
! An indication of the influence ot the
I pyrite filter in accomplishing the re
: duction of the ferric salts is shown
i by the fact that after Introducing the
1 filter the grade of the precipitate re
! covered was raised from less than
; i0'i to an average of 60' copper.
Economies follow from such a change
; in assay-value not only in the hand
' ling, drying, sacking and shipment,
but in the subsequent melting at the
i refinery.
j Each filtration vat is provided with
! a large door on the level of the filter
j bed, through which the accumulated
I sediment may .be flushed at intervals;
it is also used for discharging the spent
: filter. The mud is washed out once a
month. If allowed to collect for too
long a time the particles of pyrite be
come coated with slime and the chem
ical action of the filter ceases. It is
also desirable at intervals to turn the
! material that constitutes the filter bed
I in order to expose fresh surfaces to
I the action of the solutions. Mr. Irving
r is now preparing to modify the ar
rangement of the ore-filter by raising
; the tank, using a 3-ft. filter bed of
. screened pyritic ore and filtering down
j ward. This will permit a percolation
1 of 500 gallons per minute. The filt-
: ored solution will flow by a siphon
from the lower part of tlie vat to the
1 top of a precipitating vat set two feet
lower. , The sediment caught in the
) filter will be flushed from time to
time .without removing the ore bed.
j The promptness of the reaction is
, the interesting feature of Mr. Irving's
I application of the pyrite filter. Nlshi
! hara has shown that many common
minerals' yield a relatively prompt re
duction of tenth-normal ferric sulphate,
j For example, he obtained" a -sharper
, and more immediate effect with kaoll
' nite than with pyrite, although after
more prolonged contact the larger re
j dueing effect was obtained with an
i equal weight of pyrite. Pyrrhotite was
far more active, the reduction, ex
pressed in terms of cubic centimetres
of KMn04, used in titration, being four
times greater than for pyrite. The va
rious common ferro-magneslan sili
cates found in the gangue of many
ores also exert a not inconsiderable
I reducing power. ChalcopjTite likewise
t displays a reducing action and, as
; might be expected, marcasite is more
i pronounced in its effect than pyrite.
Moreover, the reaction in all cases
, becomes more energetic when copper
I sulphate is present in the solution and
j this is the case in the solutions de
j rived from copper mines and from
' the heap-leaching of copper ores. It
! should be considered, also, that the py
j ritic ores from different mines and
j perhaps from different parts of the
I same mine, would be expected to show
(important variations in reducing pow
er, since refined analysis proves that
! pyrite rarely, if evpr, corresponds to
i the formula KeS2: it Is a somewhat
indeterminate solid solution of FeS in
KeS2. Jhe effect of this on the ability of
i rite to reduce ferric sulphate In wa
ers coming in contact with it, is to
be taken into account, and upon this
: probably depends the continued ac
: tion of the filter, which must repre
sent a penetration and breaking down
of the pyrite particles rather than a
mere superficial 'reaction.
Another feature in the economic use
of pyrite as a reducing filter in the
preparation of copper-bearing solutions
for precipitation is the fact that the
filter Itself gradually becomes deplet
ed of its copper. Ferric sulphate re
acts with either cupric or cuprous sul
phides, reducing the iron salt to the
"ous" state and yielding, respective-
ly. copper sulphate and copper tsul
iphate plus cupric sulphide.- The tnine-
water at the Copper Queen gives an
i extraction of 50 of the copper in the
filter hi five months, lowered from
i the original assay of 2.02 to 0.6'
I m the discarded filter bed. and at the
i end of a year the filter has become
too inactive to yield economic results,
j The mine-water varies materially in
jits load of metallic salts at different
times of the year, depending on the
rainfall. A tpyira" analysis shows
about 21 grains of copper per gallon,
equivalent to 0.04 'r. about the sanie
quantity of ferrous iron, and approx-
iniately 16 grains of ferric iron, or
j 0.03 . The amount of copper in the
dry season often increases to double
the above quantity.
) Precipitation. The clarified and rc
, din ej liquors after filtration are con
' ducted to the precipitation vats, of
i whica four are now in service. These
are of the same size as the two vats
that rontain the pyrite filters, name
! ly, 20 feet diameter by 10 feet deep.
! They are similarly fitted with false
bottoms to bupport the scrap-irou em
i ployed for precipitation. By the pres
jent arrangement only the mine-water
parses through the filters, since the

T
E
leach-liquor from the ore-heap has been
subjected to the same action in the
process of leaching through the pyrite
ore. The liquor irom one niter vat
passes through only one precipitation
vat, and the overflow thence goes to
a cascade of precipitation launders be
low. The mine-waters going to the
second filter vat overflow to another
precipitation vat, and the outgoing li
quor unites with the leach-liquor from
the ore-heap, and thence goes through
two more precipitation vats placed in
series, the final overflow being then
delivered to the head of the systea
of precipitation launders.
Better precipitation Is obtained in
the vats than the launders, and this
fact will lead to some important mod
ifications of the system when carried
into effect on a larger scale after the
Sacramento Hill mine begins to de-
i liver a heavy tonnage of ore to the
! leach-yard.. Is is found that a single
i vat of the size now used will extract
on an average 40 of the total copper
i content from the solution when flow
J ing at the rate of 100 gallons per min
I ute and carrying 10 pounds of copper
('per 1.000 gallons. The iron in the
I large round vats consists of cumbrous
scrap from the mine and smelter, such
j as old. cars, pumps, compressor parts,
j worn-out sonverter-shells, old flues and
t the . like. The solution is conducted
through a down-take to the bottom
; of the vat, and flows upward through
the false bottom and the scrap-iron.
iThe cementk:opper is washed down
through the false bottom with tailing
, water from the precipitation plant and
I is discharged into launders underneath
! that carry it to settling-tanks below.
I The tailing-water, as will be more ful
ly explained later, is pumped to the
I ore-heap "above, and the main through
; which these spent liquors Is pumped
; is so (laced that branch pipes may be
; utilized for drawing off what water
I is required for washing the cement
, copper from either the precipitating
vats or the launders.
I The precipitation launders, consfst
(ing of eight pairs, are set parallel to
; the line of upper round vats The laun-.
! ders in each pair are on the same level
jand cascade into the next pair below.
! ExceDt when cleaning up, the stream
'of solution is divided between the two
j launders in each pair. The process of
cleaning' up is continuous, so that one
j launder In the system is always cut
out, and during this process its nelgh
i bor carries the full stream. The laun
! ders are each 250 feet long and 4 by 4
i feet in cross-section, divided into Tour
j compartments. There? is a narrow
! downtake at the head of each compart
i ment to deliver the solution at tie
I bottom. Smaller sizes of scrap-iron
are used in the launders, resting on
a false bottom made of slats 4 inches
wide and set 2 Inches apart. TTiis
false bottom gives 6 Inches clearance
to admit of thoroughly hosing out the
I cement-copper. The copper is dis
charged into launders underneath that
take it to the settling tanks and ponds.
The tailing-water used in the clean-up
! is taken from 2-in. bronze pipes con
j nected to the large main leading from
the pumps to the leach-yard. AH the
launders are built of 2-in. Oregon pine
and the bents and bracing that sup
j port them are of the same material.
Considering the weight carried the con
' structlon seems light, 4 by 6-in. posts
being used in the bents and 2 by 4-in.
; material for bracing. The leakage Is
' small, but some solution unavoidably
! escapes and this is preservative against
; decay, although the cellulose suffers
i chemical changes that leave the wood
j soft, and with greatly lessened trans
i verse strength. No trouble, however.
! has been experienced by collapse and
' the structure has stood with very lit
' We repair and no renewals for three
j years. This is interesting, because in
I addition to the dead load there are
' vibrations from moderately heavy traf-
fic in running trucks loaded with iron
; for filling the launders. A tramway
' is provided between each pair of laun
jders; it is so arranged that the truck
(can be run off at any level from a
1 platform-car operated by cables on an
1 Inclined track extending from tho
scrap-pile at the railroad siding below
; to ti upper round vats, following the
; grade of the system of precipitation
launders.
I On the ground underneath the precl
p?tation plant ditches serve to drain
escaping solutions to launders that lead
;to a lead-lined Buffalo centrifugal pump
I with a 2-in. discharge, which returns
I the leak-water to the precipitating sya-
tem. The cement-copper Is delivered
j by launders placed at right angles to
i the precipitation launders, into a se
ries of five circular redwood settling
I tanks, discharging one info anoT7Tt"
the inflowing stream being delivered
j at the center, and the outflow over
(the periphery falling into surrounding
circular launders. The settling is fair
ly complete and the thickened product
is flushed from the round tanks into
large square shallow drying-vats where
It evaporates in the Arizouan 6iin. The
dried cement has a lustrous red color,
and assays 60V- metal. The overflow
from tlie tanks is further settled by
circulating through a series of three
ponds, the collected sludge assaying
from 10fi copper in the first pond to
1 a'r or less iu the last. Ml this ce
' ment copper is shipped to the smelter
i at Douglas. The clarified liquor from
j the final settling-pond Is called "tail
ing-water." It contains an insignifi
cant amount or copper, which, howev
er, would involve an annroH;iMc- loss
if allowed to go to waste.
The tailing water i.-i pumped to the
i feed tanks above the lea b-yard and is
used lor wetting the ore-heap, thus
returning enriched in copper, to the
precipitation system. It is handled
by a geared piston bruuze Aldricli

the returned tailing-water is an S-ln.
Crane wood-lined pipe. The leak-liquor,
which Is .returned to the head
of the precipitation system by lead
lined centrifugal pumps, la carried In
a 3-in. cement-lined pipe- Th cement
lining is about' 1-8 in. thick and the
coating is done at the Copper Queen
shop at Bisbee. The entire operation
of the plant, consisting of filtration,
precipitation, cleaning, handilns
scrap iron, drying and sacking cement-coppr-r,
pumping and general mainten
ance, requires a force of eight men
and one foreman. The iron consumed
amounts to 1V4 abounds per pound of
copper precipitated. The theoretic
quantity required Is 0.88 pounds Iron
for each pound of copper, but thera is
a mechanical lot's, and a certain
amount of ferric sulphate still remains
iu the. solution after passing through
the pyrite filter. Every unit of ferric
iron calls for half as much metallic
iron in its conversion to ferrcu3 sul
phate In the precipitation boxe?. The
free sulphuric acid also consuives iron.
Therefore the recovery of one pound
o: copper with an excess of only 0 62
pounds of Iron over the theoretical re
quirements, in which is included the
nipchaiiical loss as well as the loss
from i'ree sulphuric acid in -.hn solu
tions, frhow how important :i role is
performed b ythe pyrite filter when it
is considered that the original mine
water carries nearly pound for pound
of copper and ferric iron. Without
the pyrite filter this ferric iron alone
would dissolve a half pound of me
tallic iron for each pound present as
a ferric salt in the solution. .
It has been pointed out that the pre
cipitation in large round vats has been
showu to be more efficient than In
launders. In the new plant that will
be built to handle the solutions from
heap-leaching on a large scale when
treating the Sacramento Hill low
grade ore, such vats will entirely su
persede the launder-system. The same
system may be Installed at the Burro
Mountain mine, the tentative plan be
ing shown in outline in the accom
panying sketch (Fig. 2). A further
Improvement is proposed, in accord
ance with a design by Joseph Irving,
Jr., which consists in adapting the
Dorr mechanism to a precipitating vat.
As will be seen In Fig. 3, the stirrer
is placed below the false bottom and
the solution is fed through a vertical
woodan conduit surrounding the spin
dle of the machine, 'which may be a
solid or perforated cylinder. The stir
rer serves to impart a movement to
the solution, causing the copper, as
fast as it is reduced by the scrap-iron
resting on the false bottom, to become
detached. As the cement-copper set
tles it is swpt to a pocket in the bot
tom of the tank; from which it can be
drawn off at intervals.
Heap-Leaching. The ordinary reac
tions in the oxidation of sulphides of
iron and copper have long been util
ized as a ready means for leaching
low-grade ores in which the copper
is present either wholly as a sulphide
or as a mixture of .sulphide and oxide.
Although the last word has not been
written on tlie subject, the principles
are quite well understood; neverthe
less, the disappointment, partly be
cause of the difficulties arising from
ferric sulphate in the solutions and
from lack of familiarity with the de
tails of management In leaching ore
heaDs. Therefore the work done at
j Bisbee is of great interest, since it
has established an economic line of
treatment that will be employed both
at the Burro Mountain mine in New
Mexico and at Bisbee on a larger scale.
Indeed, the possibility of adapting the
method as a means for profitably ex
tracting the copper from the l.SoO.000
tons of the lower-grade ore developed
in Sacramento Hill has been an im
portant factor in the plans for ben
eficiating that unique deposit.
It may be desirable to re-state the
reactions responsible for the solution
of copper in moistened ore-heaps, and
to point out that no inconsiderable
hierit in the system, lies in the possi
bility of recovering much of the cop
per that may happen to be present as
an oxide. The very low-grade copper
sulphide bodies usually are found in
fairly welUdefined zones, either on
the borders of higher concentrations
of ores, or on zones through dissem
inated orchodies whpre oxidation has
been more rapid than the reactions
that determine enrichment. These two
cases are found in , Sacramento Hili,
and in each of thera a portion of the
copper has been converted into the ox
ide. Carbonates of copper, however,
are practically absent. The reactions
on which the solution of the oxide de
pends may be represented by the ac
tion of cupric sulphate upon cupric
oxide, yielding basic copper sulphate.
Acid generated In the oxidation of
the sulphides will also directly attack
both cuprous and cupric oxides.
It should be pointed out that the
danger of producing metallic copper
is always considerable and deserve at
tention on the part of the superin
tendent with a view to obvialing as
far as possible the conditions favora
ble for such reactions. Metallic cop
per may result also from the action
of ferric sulphate upon cuprous sul
phide. Mr. Irving admits the possible form
ation of some metallic copper in the
leaching of the ore-heap, but it has
not been definitely afcertained what
proportion of the copper in the leaih-
! tailing, which contains about 20'-; of
the original copper, is in the form
of metallics. It would be an interest
ing inquiry, since it is diffucult to be
lieve that any considerable amount
of sulphide could escape the action
of the solutions after a year of treat
ment under conditions carefully main
tained to secure the highest possible
degree of oxidation.
Th5 function of the ferrous sulphate
and sulphuric acid has already been
discussed . The ferric sulphate is the
compound thai atiaeks the copper sul
phide, and when a proper balance
exists the ferric sulphate should be
wholly reduced to the "oils" state;
furthermore, the effect of the pyrite
in reducing the ferric salt is opera
tive as explained in connection with
Ihe yrile filler. Accordingly a tll-i
m-ii.iie,l heap should yield leach liquor
j comparatively free from ferric sulphate
(thus rendering precipitation ou scrap-,
iron economical. To effect this de
sirable result the heap would have to
be rich In pyrite.
In making ready to build the heap
a sita was chosen In an arroyo or
gulch on the side of Sacramento Hill,
out of the way of flood-waters. No
special preparation of the ground was
attempted; tlie space was merely well
covered with wash from the hill, and
the sicpe was about 8 degrees. The
heap was bi(lt of rutvoO-mme ore
from Sacramento Hill deposit and co
tained 9487 dry tons, the largest lumps
being 10 inches In diameter. The up
pt? surface of the heap has an area
of 12.000 square feet, the vertical depth
at the lower edge is 25 feet and at
the upper edge it is five feet. A ver
tical depth greater than 25 feet is in
admissible, owing to the danger of
channeling. A gradual and uniform
subsidence of the leach-water Is of
prime importance. The top of the
heap has two levels or terrace in or
der o facilitate inspection so as to
obtain information regarding the per
colation. The difference of elevation
between the two terraces is four feet.
Each terrace is subdivided into bas
ins 15 feet square, separated by ridges
of ore about 12 inches high. The bas
ins, furthermore, are so arranged that
the fresh leach-water will overflow
from cne to another.
On tirst flooding the heap It ab
sorbed 360.000 gallons of water or 38
gallons per ton. The solution exudes
from nil sides of the heap until the
surface becomes sealed by a crust of
basic salts. After a little time the
heap swells, and in places may burst
out and then must be repaired by
building bulkheads of the larger blocks
of ore. The floors of the basins also
become clogged by a deposit of basic
iron salts, which checks the filtration.
When this occurs they are dug up and
material from below Is brought to the
surface and again leveled preparatory
to a resumption of leaching. One la
borer on each sluf- is required. He
serves as heap-tender, looks after the
measuring or feed-tank, which sup
plies the leach-water and takes care
of a centrifugal pump that throws the
water from a storage tank to the feed
tank. As previously explained, the
tailipg-water from the precipitation
plant is elevated by an Aldrich pump,
through an 8-in. wood-lined main, to
be used for leaching the ore-heap. It
is delivered direct to the measuring
tank, which has accumulators and an
automatic tripper for discharging a
volume of 450 gallons every five min
utes. The average delivery of leach
water to the heap is 70,000 gallons per
day of 24 hours. Tho amount varies
somowhat, depending upon observed
conditions, of percolation and outflow
and. is regulated by the superintend
ent and by the heap-tender. The rate
of delivery of leach-liquor from the
foot of the heap may not correspond
exactly to the rate at which the fresh
water is added, but the weekly aver
ages will nearly balance each other.
The speed of percolation is about
feet per hour, so that the solutions
take approximately 20 hours to pass
through the ore-heap. The rate of ex
traction Is calculated from the daily
volume of solution and its assay. The
average of the samples of ore taken
daily while building the ore-heap gave
the following result:
',
Copper 1.2
Silica 60.3
Iron 10.5
Lime (CaO) 1.2
Aluminum 12.1'
Sulphur 9.9
Silver 0.12 oz
Gold .....none
Thus the total copper in the heap
amounted to 246,662 pounds, and in a
period of five months 25'r of the to
tal copper has been extracted. Tak
ing the recovery from the solutions
in precipitation at 96, this means an
actual recovery of 59.198 pounds of
copper, or nearly 400 pounds per diem
The cost of transporting the ore to
he leach-yard and building the heap
was 10 cents per ton. and the average
cost for leaching has been $10 per
lay. It is possible that it may re
quire two years to complete the leach
ing, giving an extraction of about 809?
of tlie original copper, or approximate
ly 1S9.435 pounds recovered as cement-copper.
Applying the reactions whic h occur
in the direct leaching of ores in heaps
it has been proposed by Mr. Irving
to crush copper ores for flotation- in
a solution of ferrous and ferric:, sul
phate. Tbc result anticipated is the
solution of the oxidized copper com
pounds, thereby increasing the total
recovery, and incidentally cleaning the
sulphide particles from films of ox
'de so as to facilitate concentration
in the flotation machines. The solu
tions would then bo passed through
the filtration plant to recover the dis
solved copper. The outcome of these
experiments will be awaited with keen
interest.

The great Rood which may be ac
complished for the child and for the
community through the earnest co-operation
of parent and teacher can only
he appreciated when one considers
what this organization is, and what it
stands for. Nowadays it is possible
for the smallest country one-room
school house to have its parent-teachers'
meetings and to study the same
subjects, have equally good speakers
and be as great a power for good as
the most modern school in the coun
try. From the headquarters in Wash
ington, instructions are sent out to
assist the associations in working for
the renefit of their own particular
needs.
There is a little one-room school
house out at the end of the Grand
canal and 14 miles or so from Phoe
nix. Last spring, through the ef
forts of parents and teachers there
are only two teachers and not more
than 15 families sending children to
school the rough grounds about the
school house were leveled and fenced
and tres set out. Tennis courts were
marked off and a driveway made to
the school house. What money was
needed for lamps and fence wire was
raised by means of box socials ana
the farmers contributed their teams
and labor gladly.
This Is only a sample of what can
be done by a parent-teachers associa
tion in a small out-of-the-way place.
In other daces rood roads, shade
trees, parks and so forth have been
the results of cooperation on the
part of parents and teachers. In Bis
bee more interest Is needed and more
faith, and co-operation.

Ever since our grandmother? can
remember we have looked to Paris fo
our fashions. Five or six years ago
some of our leading American maga
zines started an American fashion de
partment which has only proved mod
erately successful, for Paquin and Dou
cet and Lucile continue to be names
to conjure with in the realm of fash
ion. One asks, will this always be so,
or will not the crippling of industries
in France and the cutting off of raw
materials weaken the morale of the
French fashion authorities? At the
beginning of the war this appeared
to be likely to happen; but after the
first shock of tbe cataclysm had
passed, - the modistes and designers
rallied nobly with the consequences
that their salons are as popular as
ever.
Perhaps the greatest influence in
the world of American fashion today
may be summed up in the word, "econ
omy." There are so many things, to
buy or make for little fatherless chil
dren and their mothers and grand
mothers in France and Belgium that
both pocketbook andl leisure hours
are impaired. It is a significant fact
that many women are voluntarily
wearing last year's coat and bat, so
that the price of new ones may go to
some noble purpose.
Scarcity of Wool.
French fashions have also been con
siderably influenced by the scarcity
of certain materials, but especially
wool. Perhaps the warmest as well
as tbe most beautiful substitute they
have found is the velvet group, in
cluding velveteen and corduroy. These
fabrics in varying weights and quality
are used for coats, simple morning
frocks, more elaborate afternoon
dresses and lovely evening gowns.
One of their chief attractions is that
they combine successfully with fur
and chiffon and satin and georgette
crepe.
Simplicity is the keynote of style.
For tl e woman who wishes to buy
only one new evening gown this win
ter, one of velvet in orchid, rose, lem
on, nlle green or turquoise is worthy
of attention. The rather decollette
bodice has black velvet shoulder
straps, fastened with piquant little
bows on the shoulders, while the se
verity ot the square cut neck Is soft
ened by little sleeves and shoulder
pieces ot transparent net or chiffon.
Tbe skirt Is not very full, and has
ruffle ftanding up fbove the belt at
the wsist line. The belt is a narrow
strip of the black velvet ribb -n caught
at one side with a ribbon rose. The
skirt is draped slightly over the hips
to relieve the straight lines and tapers
toward the ankle hem.

Smaller hand bags imitate their big

They are usually longer than wide.

eyelets, that serve also as drawstrings.
The newer knitting bag is made of
chintz,, bright colored silk, embroid
ered linen and to be very fashiona
ble of black silk or satin. A novelty
bag is made by taking a width of ma
terial, doubling it to produce the de
sired size, and sewing up the ends.
Then the two edges which form the
top are shirred on to rods, and handles
of cord, attached to the ends of the
rods, form the finishing touch. If
the material used is flowered cretonne,
an original effect may be gained by
outlining the flowers in gold thread.
This is done by taking one's stitches
over the gold thread, using a yellow
cotton thread that remains practical

Other Acceptable Gifts.
The linen or huckaback guest towel
with dainty scalloped or crocheted edge
and Initial at one end makes an at
tractive gift besides being very use
ful. , Usefulness should be the first con
sideration In the choosing of Christ-
mas gifts this year more than ever
': before, while attractiveness is a close
i second. A gift that combines the two
and one that would be especially ap
) predated by invalids these chilly win
I ter mornings is a little warm negligee
' wrap or wool. It may be knitted or
crocheted and resembles the old fash
i ioned fichu. It forms a warm cape
; over the back and shoulders, and the
! long ends cross over the chest and
meet at tbe waist Mine in back. The
edges may be scalloped or finished
with little yarn tassels.
Filet crochet Is as popular this Sea
ttle as it was last. One can make
lovely gifts of filet and linen for a
variety of useful and ornamental pur
poses. There are tea cloths, tea cos
eys. table runners, bureau scarfs, col
lars and so on, ad infinitum.
The newest in sweaters is made to
slip over the head and may have a
sailor collar or be callarless. It has
a wide sash with tasseled ends, which
is usually knotted over one hip. A
warm cap to match tbe sweater may
be made with turned back brim and
pointed top turned over on one side
and finished with a coquettish tassel.

Tuesday noon the business men of

and were privileged to listen to an In

Julia T. Lee.
Mrs. Coltont secretary of the em
ployment work, is registering both em
ployers and employees. Business men
who wish office assistants, clerks, etc.,
are advised to acquaint the employ
ment department with their needs.
Bisbee mothers of small children
will appreciate the fact' that the Y.
W. Is fast becoming a refuge for lost
babies, for it established a record last
week when it resTbred three to their
homs. Several articles have found
their ay into the association where
they are awaiting owners, such as a
pnrs., a bracelet and ooine rings.
Mrs. 5?. F. Frazier. wife of the gen

Friday evening the first meeting of

Many requests are coming to the
war work council of the Young Wom
en's Christian Association to under
take housing In communities near can
tonments and in large industrial ren
ters. As we all know, girls are being
brought together in large numbers to
work cn government contracts for mu
nitions, for aeroplanes, for uniforms,
for automobile parts and many other
things. In many of these places no
provision whatever is made for the
housing of these girls, either by the
firm which employs them, or by the
community. This problem is. in a
greater or less degree. In every indus
trial center in the I'nited States, and
involves hundreds ot thousands of
girls. It is the responsibility of the
establishments to meet their own
problems of houslrfe their workers, but
it is often easier to make them see
their problem and the way out. If an
organization such as the oung wom
en's Christian Association has already
in operation a successful boarding
home which is liked and used by the
girls and Is at the same time an eco
nomic success.
The question' of housing industrial
workers Ls still in its beginnings in
its beginnings In this country and we
have an opportunity too great to be
ignored, to help in determining the
type of building. If we erect a dor
mitory which has a parlor where the
girls may see their men friends, as
we certainly will do, it will be very
much more probable that commercial
buildings for the same purpose will
also have parlors.
We have spent much time In the
past In talking of hours of work and
sanitary conditions In the factories.
This is only part of an industrial prob
lem. Closely allied to It is tbe three
fold problem of housing, of food and
of recreation. The Young Women's
Christian Association hopes, to a lim
ited extent, to do some of the experi
menting necessary before we can ar
rive at a satisfactory solution of this
problem.

is from Mr. Babcock's letter:
"And the women! Ah, some women
In the nation's capital are still making
a spectacle ot themselves, but tbe
great body of American womanhood,

what they can to help win its great

schools, school attendance, their

a higher intellectual development be
punctiliously maintained. Never be

and so aroused, so intensely patriotic.
so willing to help, so anxious to sac
rifice. "One asks. Is it the women of wealth,
too? Yes. How is it right here in
my city for one tiny example? Women
of enormous wealth are weekly go

there sew on buttons (buttons, mind
you), and patch pairs of wooly socks.

his dance with tbe daughter of the

noblewoman of France and England
have learned, that womanhood is one
weapon of the war. She doesn't mind
the rather colorless society events due
to war-time encnomy; her afternoon

have been $3.00 per ton, leaving a net

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or smalL
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

CATTLE FEED IS SCARCE IN
ARIZONA, STEPHENS SAYS .
PHOENIX. DEC. l.-"Arizona has'
no feed for the starving cattle and
s.ieep from the drought-stricken re
glons of Texas and New Mtxko." de
clares Ed. W. Stephens, secretary ol i
the Arizona livestock sanitary board,
who has just returned from an in
spection trip through Pima and Pinal
counties. "This state Teally has not
enough feed at present for the cattle
iiid sheep now here." he added, -and,
there are certainn to be heavy losses
in the spring if the crowding of the
rr.nges continues.
"Too many cattle already have heci;
shipped into this state from western
Texas and New Mexico, and more are
coming iu all the time. Only a lew
favored areas in the whole state ol
Arizona have any feed to spare at
present, and wherever the range will
accommodate, they are buying from
the poorer ranges. The rattle in many
localities are just existing at present
and the cattlemen are praying for1
rain."
You Can Shake Loose from
The Tortures of Rheumatism
By using S. S. S.
The germs of Kheumatism are in
the blood, which is laden with mil
lions of the minute demons of pain,
causing; untold sutlcring and bringing
its victim from vigor and strength to
almost helplessness. To get real and
genuine relief from this disease,
these disease germs must be com
pletely routed out of the system
through the blood.
S. S. S. has been used for fifty

1231 SHIPS REPORTED
LOST SINCE OPENING
OF EUROPEAN WAR
(Correspondence of Associated Press)
LIVERPOOU Dec. 1. The Liver
pool Steamship Owners' association
reports that 231 of its ships with a
total tonnage of 1.4fi5.046 are num
bered among the war losses since
August, 14. The marine losses num
bered 33 vessels with a total tonnage
of 174.359 tons.
New vessels added to the fleet of
the members of the association were
131 with a tonnage of 946.532.
The association estimates the cost
of replacement of liner losses during
the war at C 103.500.000. After de
ducting 69,000.000 as recoverable
under insurance or from the state
as ascertained values under the terms
of requisition, there was left a bal
ance to be provided of 34,000.000.
In addition there must be a heavy
outlay in recondiliouing liner fleets
as they exist when peace is restored.
In the result provided the . whole of
the money collected in respect of war
losses is reinvested in shipping, the
lines would have to find out of earn
ings, out of further capital or on
credit. In order 10 bring back their
fleets to the state of efficiency in
which they were before the war,
about 47.000.000.
The report proceeds: "If the stale
embarks on the building of liner ton
nage, the future of the lines must be
gravely imperiled. The shipbuilding
yard facilities for the building of such
tonnage are. limited, and if the slips
are occupied by state ships it will be
impossible for the lines to replace
their losses. But, above all else, if
the stae Is building ships to compete
with the liner their credit with their
shareholders will be destroyed, and
such capital as they.hfve available
will be withdrawn to find more secure
employment.
MThe questions raised in this mem
orandum are of pressing importance,
as it has recently been announced
that the state is starting on the build
ing of liner tonnage. Plans are al
ready in existence for vessels to car
ry about 10.600 tons dead weight at a
speed of 14 knots."
The association asked the govern
ment to guarantee that the business
cf the lines shall be restored to them
after the war and be restored to them

The 1917 Output
"Missing- from the production figures
for the first nine months of the year
are those of the mines served by the
Sasco smelter and conservatively half
a million pounds of copper the month
recovered from Arizona custom ore
shipments to smelters of the state.
Arizona copper production during the
first nine months should therefore be
around 564,000.000 pounds, if Sasco is
figured in at approximately 7.000,000
pounds for the period. Taking into
consideration losses from United
Verde and Verde Extension produc
tion !u May and June because of strike
trouoles and lower production by rea
son of unsettlement in advance of the
strikes at the end of June and on the
first of July in Globe, Miami,: Clifton,
Morencl and Bisbee, which took from
the total maximum output that other
wise might have been credited to the
first half of the year and figuring in
creases which may safely be credited
to the last three months of the year
from. . New Cornelia, Humboldt and
Mayer, it seems safe to credit the last
three months of the year with probable
output of more than 200,000.000 pounds
of copper, or a total for the year of
nearly 1 50,000.000 pounds. Indicative
of the pickup in production is the Oc
tober output of 1.9S0.000 pounds of
copper by Consolidated Arizona Smelt
ing, a record for that property and one
upon which it will gain steadily dur
ing some months to come.
A Real Triumph.
"Attainment of output of 75000,000
pounds this year despite labor troubles
and the withdrawal from efficient
forces of the drafted men, together
with difficulties experienced in secur
ing supplies with the promptness nec
essary to topmost efficiency from
plants, delayed transportation being
chargeable to urgency requirements of
the government upon the carriers, will
represent a triumph for the mine
managers of the state earning for them
very great credit from government
heads and all patriotic citizens who
give to the copper industry that meas
ure of importance which its necessity
to conduct of war entitles it to. The
managers of no other great industry,
distant from centers ot supply, in a
region so far removed from Washing
ton that Its needs in transportation
and labor consideration can only be
partly understood, have been confront
ed with as much to overcome. If they
get their 750.000,000 pounds of copper
in 1917 it will carry the assurance that
had they enjoyed normal conditions of
operation and worked to their maxi
mum they would have made close to
a billion pounds, or nearly one-half of
the copper of the "American continent.
As it is they will exceed the record of
1916, reported by the geological sur
vey In round numbers at 676,000,000
! nonn-R the highest total of record fof
any copper producing division of
America.
Resourcefulness.
"The speed with which near norma
output of metal has been regained is
a further reflection of credit upon the
industry as well as a valuable demon
stration to the public of the prepared
ness of the Arizona copper mines for
emergencies. There lias been demon
stration of the value of investment
in ore bedding plants and their obun
dant stocking, as well as of the re
sourcefulness of the mines under
emergency calls, by reason of which
not a few producers reached into ore
areas of exceptional richness and with
decreased working forces and de
creased ore tonnage output, made even
stronger than usual output of copper.
Money Support.
"Atop of the heavy payments of in
come and profits tax to the federal
government, the splendid response to
the Liberty loan calls must have fur
ther enhanced the Arizona mining in
dustry in the eyes of distant govern
ment heads and the general public.
The subscriptions of the mining com
panion alone made it possible for Ari
zona to attain the quota set in the
bonds offering and in the last cam
paign enabled the state to be the first
of the ultimate few reporting large
over subscription. Complete figures
covering subscriptions on behalf of the
state are not yet available, but estl
mate of a total of $31,000,000 is con
sidered conservative, the greater part
of the amount finding credit In sub
scriptions made in the state where
the head offices of the companies are
located, but more than J4.000.000 be
ing subscribed in Arizona to the last
lean and nearly as much in the period
of the first loan. In addition there
were in the two campaigns total sub
scriptions of probably more than $1,
000,000 by the employees of mining
companies in the state. In the last
loan men of the United Verde sub
scribed $30,000, C. & A. $41,600. Copper
Queen $35,000, Shattuck-Arizona $17,
000, United astern $10,700, Ray Con
solidated. Old Dominion, Miami, In
spiration and New Cornelia men also
bought largely of bonds, reflecting
company and individual endeavor to
assist government financing. Verde
Extension men and those of every other
mining company in the state also took
part strongly.

AMSTERDAM. Dee. 1 Three Ger
mans, including one non-commis
sioned officer, one private and a civil
official, have just been executed in
Germany as entente spies. The leader
ot the group, according to the Ger
man newspaper accounts, was a Dr
Roose. His associates were Joseph
Schnitzler. a non-commissioned ofti
cer in an artillery battalion at the
front, and Albert Strudel, a soldier in
a telephone section in Coblentz.
The Cologne Gazette gives the fol
lowing account of the case:
. i ne enemy espionage service not
only succeeds in now and then send
ing enemy subjects and suborned neu
trals with false or stolen passports to
spy In Germany, but occsionully a
German succumbs to the temp'.atiou
of money.
a uerman court-martial had to
deal with one of these cases a short
time ago. The three men named were
accused of treason. Dr. Roos. who
bad been a failure in his profession
auu in me, Kuue on a cosiness jour
ney to Switzerland in 1915, made the
acquaintance of a certain Joseph
Kraft in Geneva, whose business was
t-j get agents for the French intelli
gence service. Here Dr. Roos was
ilso introduced to an alleged Captain
Barrat.
"It was agreed that Roos should
settle in Frankfort, and from then
send military and economic informa
tion to Switzerland to a coverine ad
dress, Grevilliot, Geneva. The infor
mation was written by Roos in invisi
ble ink between the lines of newspa
pers which were then sent in a wrap
per looking quite innocuous in the
post. As a reward for betravine- hir
k.cuntrv Rnni fit nnro rpfivfri an i
advance of 2000 francs and a monthly
payment of 1000 francs was guaran
teed him.
"In October, 1915, Roos began his
activities in Frankfort. At first he!
bad his own observations only to rely
upon, but later he gained accomplices
in Strudel and Schnitzler. He sent
I several reports monthly until finally
the secret writing was discovered and
it was ascertained that he was the
sender. Soon afterwards his accom-!
plices were discovered. All then
made full confession.
"The activities of these three spies
has done great injury to the father
land and the army, as the two sol
diers, especially Schnitzler, who was
at the front, were able to give infor
mation. The court-martial condemned!
ifl -three to death. The punishment
was carried out soon after.
"In addition, it was possible to have
a number of other members of the
espionage organization brought to 1
trial. The recruiting agent, Josef!
Kraft, and Grevilliot, who received j
letters from Roos at Geneva, were
Tied by the court there. Kraft was :
fined 300 francs and sentenced to!
three months imprisonment. Grevil-!
liot got a 600-franc fine and four)
months' imprisonment for obtaining
on behalf of a foreign power." 1
Another account of espionage activ-
ities in Germany is printed in a num-j
ber of German papers this week. It j
pays a grudging tribute to the activi-
ties of an alleged Russian agent
named Liander, of whom it says:
"This versatile and cunning spy, who 1
Is generally described as a man of
education and of an amiable nature.:
has been rendered harmless. But the
espionage service of the entente will :
find other ways. Only the greatest
watchfulness against all suspicious
persons and the greatest restraint and 1
caution in conversation can relieve
Germany from these pests or make,
their activity futile."
It is stated that Liander himself is
a Swede. His two principal accom
plices were Plammer. formerly a Ger-;
man subject, and Hopf, a German. I
According to the German newspapers, I
the three have been condemned toj
long periods of imprisonment. j
The showing of the men of lhe
United Eastern probably leads In the
state, 107 of the employees of the
company out of 205 making subscrip
tions. Oatman itself made a total sub
scription of $54,550 (inclusive of com
pany employees subscriptions) of the
quota of Mohave county, $129,050. or
nearly half. General Superintendent
Burgess, of the United Eastern natur
ally felt pride in the subscriptions of
his men and the loyalty expressed
and did not fail to give them the sat
isfaction of knowing that their atti
tude was appreciated. Beside making
a record of the names of all the sub
scribing employees for future refer
ence as an honor list, he sent each
a letter of personal thanks. "The
subscriptions show, says the conclud
ing paragraph, "that the men of Oat
man fully understand their responsi
bility to support the government and
the soldiers in this grievous war. Be
fore it is over we shall doubtless be
called upon to do many unusual things
and make many sacrifices among which
will be the investment of our savings
in bonds, and the conservation of food.
Let us respond as whole-heartedly to
each appeal as we did to the recent
loan." Men of various other mining
companies who entered heartily into
the loan calls also received words of
appreciation from their employers.
Support to State
The feature of taxation is another
In which the mining Industry of Ari
zona carries more than a full share
of all the burdens of the people. The
Industry under the valuation fixed by
the tax commission will pay 57"f of
all of the taxes of the state. This is
exclusive of taxes paid on stores and
other property improvements. In ad
dition the Industry is paying enor
mous total tribute to the war tax, sur
plus profit and income taxes levied by
the federal government for the conduct
of the war, and at the same time in
spirit of unalloyed patriotism is ac
cepting 23 V4 cents for its Copper, a
cut under the open market at the time
of price fixation, and far under the
price3 that the shortage of the metal
would now dictate in an open market.
At the same time the producers are
unquestioningly paying the 26 cent
metal wage scale. Taxes as propor
tioned in the state are: Mines 57 per
cent. Railroads 13.80 per cent, lands
and improvements 7.60 per cent, live
stock 5.40 per cent. AH other tax in
come 16.20 per cent.
Public Economy.
. Recent announcement of the govern
ment that auto truck auxiliary service
will be added to railroad freight trans
portation facilities, was anticipated
in September, when it was urged that
northern and southern highways across
the state from New Mexico to Cali
fornia, be put in first class condition
to handle heavy trucks and that coun
ty and city prison labor be added to
the state prison forces to carry out
the work, free labor being abolished
on the roads and turned to the aid of
the mines and fields. The employment
of coupty prisoners can be made a
success on road work at less cost
than entailed by employment of free
labor. This has been demonstrated in
Cochise county the last two years. In
October the cost per prisoner em
ployed was 61.63 the day. Including
idle days and the loss of time from
illness and all other causes and figur
ing every item of expense of all kinds
in connection with working the pris
oners. $2.20 the day is reached. Even
should prison labor on the face of
returns cost more than free labor,
which would not occur under compe
tent management, still the taxpayers
would be ahead in getting some re
turn for the food and jail keep they
provide prisoners. Proposals to stop
road Improvement work have been
proposed and it is urged that the state
and county engineers and supervisors
co-operate to the end of massing the
forces of county prisoners in assisting
state prison forces. It is felt that par
ticularly during the period of the war' the copper industry, with promise of 1
and its large uncertainties the main considerable la results next year.
JAPAN'S WAR COUNCIL
CAUSES MUCH SPECULATION
TOKIO, Dec. 1. The sifdden conj
vening of the High Military Council
on October 27 has given rise to much !
conjecture. The Council consists of.
the aged Marshal Prince Yanagata. '
Marshal Kawamura, Marshal Oka and
Marshal Terauch. the premier, with
General Uyehara, Chief of the General
Staff and General Oshima, minister of
war. The conference was of unusual
length and, it was surmised that it i
was connected with three mooted ques-!
tions: China's request for an arms'
and munitions loan; the sending oil
Japanese troops to the war front and
the organization of a new army corps, i
These guesses were denied by the au- j
thorlties who simply state that plans
have to be made to enable Japan to :
keep up with the general war situa-i
tion and that nothing of an urgent ,
nature was considered. '
roads should have the most considers-;
tion ever given them. In this view a ;
number of chambers of commerce have ,
joined. j
Immigration Sought. !
It has been urged upon railroads toj
include in their advertising matter j
special mention of the high wages and
good climatic conditions in Arizona
mining districts, together with good j
living conditions, and the fact that all 1
Americans who can bring good records j
are desired in these districts.
Even before the appointment of Mr. ,
Hoovei, food conservation endeavors j
were started through appeal to mln-1
ers to stop wasteful lunch bucket prac-'
tices, an appeal which had very good 1
results in some districts. j
The activities of mining compa-,
nies in securing larger crops, lands and
truck garden productiveness were giv
en wide prominence with result of
some magazine and much newspaper
comment. The attention of magazine

girl whose nightly prayer at Xmas.
time was this: "Thank God for the
taking off of shoes." ' It is a pathetic
cry. Isn't it?
You will help to lighten the burdens
of salespeople during the holiday seas
on by making your purchases a little
earlier in the month than usual and
a little earlier in the day. ' You will
save your own strength and nerves,
too.
And. best of all, you'll get things
that you really want and that will real
ly pit ate those to whom you give, for
by shopping In the early days of the
month and in the early hours of the
day, both you and the people who wait
on you will have more time and more
strength; and so complete your pur
chases sooner and wtih more of the
true Christmas good will and cheer.
