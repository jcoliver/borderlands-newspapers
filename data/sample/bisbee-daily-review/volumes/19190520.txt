LONDON, May 19. (By the Asso

ocean 40 miles west of the mouth of
the Shannon. Later admiralty re
ports said that this information was

western Austria. The members of
the new government have issued a
decree forbidding residents of Vien

Main Street Additions will
Be Striking Contrast to 1
Present Block
Establishment of an auto row and
the building of one of the best: streets
in the entire Warren district, will
have been completed by September 1,
in Lowell, when new fronts will have
been constructed on the main street
from the site of the theater now
building to the lower end of the street.
The buildings of the auto row will oc
cupy the space from the theater to
the end of the street.
Construction of the new buildings
will begin as soon as the theater
building has been completed, or with
in the next 60 days. The new front
age will measure 205 feet from the
theater to the end of the street. The
frontage of the auto row will measure
105 feet The entire construction will
be of pressed brick, and the frame
buildings which in the past have made
this portion of the street unsightly,
will be torn out to make room for the
new buildings. -
At least two automobile dealers will
have places of business in the new
buildings, and it is possible that one
other may be accommodated. Ray B.
Krebbs, dealer in Cochise county for j
the Chevrolet, will occupy one or the
buildings. The second will be used
as sales rooms for the Buick agency,
George Jackson, of Douglas, county
agent,. having taken the lease. The
third section is that now occupied by
the Long Trail garage. New front will
be constructed on this building, to
make it conform with the new build

auto row. '
The plan for the new section of

Vail Urges Legislation to Pro
vide for Return to
Private Control
WASHINGTON, May 19. Members
of congress received today an appeal
from Theodore N. Vail, president of
the American Telephone & Telegraph
company, and G. W. Robinson, presi
dent of the United States Independent
Telephone association, asking for
speedy legislation to enable the return
of the telephane properties throughout
the country to their private owners.
The text of the appeal in part fol
lows :
"To the members of the senate and
house of representatives:
"On midnight, July 31, 1918,under
the authority of congress for war pur
poses, the president took supervision,
possession, control v and operation of
the telephone systems of the country,
and has since operated them. The war
has practically ceased The public
press is strongly demanding and the
general public and the owners of the
telephone properties are urging that
they be returned as speedily as pos
sible, that former conditions may be
restored and more satisfactory .serv
ice be afforded.
"The expenses of these systems
hava largely increased during the
past year, for wages alone at the rate
of more than $20,000,000- per annum.
This was inevitable and necessary by
reason of larger proportional increases
bv the railroads and industries of the
' country. The revenues are inadequate
, to care for such increases, and the
deficit of the government on that ac
count to date is large and steadily in
creasing. "If such conditions continue, neces
sarily the credit of the operating com.
paniea will be impaired, proper ex.
penses cannot be met, the best ope
rating forces cannot be retained, need-1
ed extensions and satisfactory service
cannot be 'provided."
"Just and speedy settlements should
be made for all properties taken under
existing law, that such balances now
in the possession of the government
tnay be used in the upbuilding and ex
tension of the. various systems for bet
ter public use'

Tax in Revenue Bill Sought
WASHINGTON, May 19. Enough
bills were introduced in the house to
day to keep the body continuously
at work through the year. More than
1200 measures were placed in the
house hopper.
While most of the bills provide for
the donation to various communities
of cannon, and German field pieces,
captured by the American expedition
ary forces, much of the legislation
that failed at the last session was
again turned in and new measures
came from the Republican side as
part of the legislative program agreed
upon at the party caucus.
First on the house calendar is the
joint resolution of Representative
Mann fdr a federal constitutional
amendment providing equal suffrage.
Next is the bill of Representative
Steenerson of Minnesota, providing
for immediate return of telegraph and
telephone lines now controlled by the
government.
Republican senators at a confer
ence late today agreed upon a bill
for repeal of the wire conCTol act and
for immediate return of the wire sys
tems to their owners. The measure
probably will be introduced tomor
row In the senate.'
Would Repeal Prohibition
Bills to repeal war time prohibit
tion, the luxury tax section of the
war revenue bill and taxes on soda
fountain products weht early into
the hopper. Among the repeal bills
were half dozen measures aimed at
the daylight saving act, most of them
sponsored by farmers' organizations.
Representative La Guardia of New
York introduced a bill under which
the' government would provide trans
portation to FJrance for the nearest
of kin of all soldiers buried over
seas, this being put forward by him
as preferable to the plan of attempt
ing to return all bodies to this coun
try. Prohibitory immigration leg-
islation
is embodied in another bill
introduced by Representative Lufkin
of Massachusetts, who asked early
consideration for it.
Referendum for Amendments
What was regarded as an out
growth of the ratification of the pro
hibition amendment was a bill pro
posing a constitutional amendment
providing that all future amendments
to that document be ratified by ref

there is an immense amount of legis

friends. Leaving Bisbee. he went to j
the coast and became acquainted with
Gov. Hiram Johnson while he was
"covering" the state legislature and
later became one of Johnson's closest
political lieutenants.
Before his advent to chairman of
the state board of control Mr. Ney
land was a reporter on the San Fran
cisco Bulletin. Two years ago he

CAGE CRASHES AT
BOTTOM OF SHAFT
A Fcrioua accident was averted in
the Calumet & Cochise shaft last night
only because no one was in the case
when the manipulation of a wrong
valve, in operation started one cage
to the. bottom at the. rate or 800 feet
a minute and riaiuaKed the lower deck
of tho: cagP; when it came in contact
with tho bottom o fthe shaft.
In unother shaft the cage was 15
feet from the bottom of the shaft and
this cage dropped only that distance
with no ilanufge to the cage but a pil
ing up of cable rope at the bottom of
lie shaft, making a new rope noees
f?ry for the operation of the cage
Other vlse the damage was slight.

TO BASEBALL CLUB
That Bisbee is to have a ball team
in the proposed Tucson, Douglas, Bis
bee. Lowell baseball league is evi
denced from the generous response of
merchants in subscribing funds to de
fray the operating expenses of the
club. They realize that it is strictly a
business proposition and an additional
asset to the community from a busi
ness standpoint and as a result every
merchant approached by the solicit
ing committee has responded readily
to the call.
It is the plan to get the league in
playing shape by the first of next
month and a meeting will be held of
all the clubs very shortly to organize
and arrange a. playing schedule. In
the meantime. with the funds on hand
Manager Roy 'Brashear will touch the
wires and bring to the city an assort
ment of ball tossers that he says will
start Bisbee off in the winning column
and kep it up all during the season.
Among the players Brashear has un
der consideration is a well known star
who knocked the ball all over the lot
in the Patific Coast league and who
Is desirous f playing with his old
friend Brashear. Manager Brashear
also has his eye on several promising
hurlers and as soon as funds have
been raised necessary to defray the
initial expenses of organization he will
bring the players to the city and start
rounding them into shape for the
opening game of the season. -
The Tenth Cavalry at Ft. Huachuca
through Lieutenant Boone has ex
pressed a desire to become part of
the proposed league. The Tenth has
a snappy club that would hold its
own against ' any team in the state.
Nothing definite has been decided re
garding the entrance of Ft. Huachuca
into the league but it is thought that
the matter will be taken up at the
first meeting of the officials of the
league and the soldier boys will be
given every consideration. If it is
army camp a paying proposition no
doubt Huachuca will be given a berth
in the league.

A New Protector of America'3 Resource
- i
The war is not ended! America is engaged in a struggle which
knows no armistice or peace terms. The struggle for thS preservation
of our national resources, bitter in the past, has been but intensified by
the war. The unprecedented demand for raw material, so essential
to the needs of our war industries, intensified the conservation and
utilization of waste material. This has resulted in a scarcity of the sub
stitutes for virgin raw material and unless our efforts for conservation
are continued, the natural resources must be utilized as soon as our
industries resume operation at full capacity.
Waste material is the protector of our natural resources! Waste
paper, rags, and other waste material can be used in new forms, there
by decreasing the annual consumption of virgin material. The conser
vation of this material must be continued in order to save our natural
wealth for future needs.
The present turn-in of waste material, resulting from the spring col
lections, is indicative of the influence of war. The waste dealers report
that this is the lightest collection in the history of the trade. The
cause of this lies in several factors. The volunteer movement for col
lection of waste materials resulted in a tremendous turn-in during the
last two years. Civic bodies, charitable organizations, and women's
clubs all contributed to this movement of waste material which brought
to the market accumulations of regions heretofore untouched by the
commercial collector.
A second factor lies in our relief and recreational work overseas.
Thousands of tons of worn clothing, which in the ordinary course of
events would have been remanufactured in the waste industry, have
been sent overseas to 'clothe the destitute of Europe. Thousands of
tons of books, papers, and magazines, which can be utilized in the man
ufacture of other grades of paper, were sent to our troops overseas.
This materialj.will be discarded In foreign fields, thereby decreasing
to an appreciable degree the amount of raw material available for the
manufactories of this country.
The third cause lies in the price situation. 4 Waste material prices
have been steadily declining since last fall. The collectors and assort
ers have been forced to stay out of the market, which in many instances
has resulted in the destruction of waste material in the home or the
factory. The consuming mills, meeting a lull in orders, have decreased
their orders and the organized commercial field for conservation must
await a strengthening note; but when the denied comes, the shortage
of material will be felt and prices will increase and will doubtless be
maintained for some time.
The most important factor in the situation is the collector. The
collector, or junkman, is the foundation cf the waste industry. At best,
he has made but a precarious livelihood. The larger and constant earn
ings to be secured in the war Industries were responsible for many
collectors abandoning the field. Nor has the cessation of hostilities re
sulted in any marked movement on their part to resume their previous
occupation, and it cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty when
such a movement will occur.
In view of such conditions, it is necessary for America to intensify
her campaign for conservation and to evolve programs to meet the sit
uation. A system of collection has been developed in Akron, Ohio,
which may assist in solving the difficulty. A community incorporated
waste-saving 6ystem has been in successful operation for some time in
that city. The Waste Reclamation Service of the Department of Com
merce has recently published a report on the working of this project.
Every industry, trade body, or organization interested in conservation
should secure a copy of the report of the Akron Industrial Salvage Com
pany movement, which may be had free on application to the Waste
Reclamation Service, Department of Commerce, Washington, D. C. In
it lies the answer In part to the problem of how America shall proceed
in the conservation of her natural resources.

BUILDING BOOM AHEAD
When the pessimist arises in the morning he feels sure in advance
that he is going to nick his face in shaving or stick some tooth paste in '
his eye or something like that. .
He feels convinced that at breakfast his coffee will be cold and the
eggs not cooked to suit him. .
Because he feels this way he does just exactly what he had expected
to do, he cuts a nice meaty hunk from his thia, he declares the
coffee is cold though it is warm enough foi all the others in the house
and ho tails down the cook for the condition of the eggs, although
they have been cooked just as usual. ' f
. With this bad start the pessimist feels, as customary, that it is going
to be an unlucky day for him.
He declares gloomily to himself that before the day is over he will
.get a call down from the boss, will lose a couple of customers and fall
down stairs and break his neck, or something.
Consequently he is in just the right mood to get the boss in a condi
tion where a call down is inevitable.
He loses a couple of customers because he has told himself it 13
inevitable that he will lose them.
. And he does fall down and nearly breaks his neck but just at the
critical moment a smiling optimist bteps up and saves him.
Which leads us to a consideration of the way the world looks to the
optimist.
The optimist arises in the morning with a tune on his lips and a
gladsome smila upon hi3 countenance.
He knows he feels that he is going to like it it seems one of the
best breakfasts he ever ate.
He knows he Is going to bo praised by the los3 and make new sales
records during the day and all that and because he has this attitude
toward his business he gets what "he expects.
And he" feels that before the day is, over he will help some poor
sufferer who, as stated above .turns out to be the pessimist.
Pessimism and optimism are ninety per cent states of mind. How uoes
the world look to YOU? Which arc YOU? f
Bolshevism is not an ida, but an appetite.
i Hildreth kept vigil over the pipe line
and on April 13, last, Charles Gard
jner, Sr., it is alleged, was caught
red handed in the act of cutting the
pipe line. Gardner was placed .unaer
arrest and charged with contempt of
court in view of the fact that he had
violated the restraining order of the
court which prohibited him from tap
ping the line.
The law firm of Ellinwood & Ross
1 handled the case for McKeehan and
last Thursday after all the evidence
had been submitted one of the jury
men suggested that the jurors visit
the scene where the pipe line had
been cut. Returning from the Mc
Keehan ranch the jury on Friday aft
ernoon returned a verdict of guilty
against Gardner.
In passing sentence though for vio
lation of contempt of court the court
exhibited clemency to the defendant
school and gave the alarm. When the
fire department arrived at the burning
building the fire had gained consid
erable headway, but after an hour's
hard work on the part of the firemen
it was extinguished. .
Mr. Gherna ,the owner of the barn,
estimated his lss at $500, piincipally
to the hay which was stored in the
building. The fire is believed to
have started . from spontaneous com
bustion in the hav.
provided he would not disturb the pipe
line further. The penalty for con
I tempt of court is a fine of J1000 or
i six months in jail ojf botV ,
j Another cass now pending against
Gardner and under which he is out
on J2000 bond is a felony under the
laws of Arizona. Anyone, the statutes
provide, who shall ; damage or couse
to be damaged any structure which is
part of a project for irrigation and
farming, purposes is guilty of a felony.

PHOENIX May 19. It was a bappy
co-incidence that on the day the peo
ple voted bonds in the sum of $4,000,
000 for paved roads in this county, it
was decided to put the plant of the
Arizona Portland Cement company
east of Phoenix into commission
after a period of idleness of about ten
years.
After several days of negotiation an
agreement to purchase was entered
into yesterday between F. A. Gillespie
and the officials of the cement com
pany, P. M. Jewett, president; C. W.
Crouse, secretary, and F. T. Pomeroy,
director. The contract price is J40.000
and a payment of $1000 was made.
The qext step will be an investigation
by Mr. Gillespie of the condition of the
planL
Mr. Gillespie is the Oklahoma oil
magnate who last week with his son
purchased 'the property of the Gila
Water company and 72,000 acres oi
land adjacent, and entered into a con
tract for construction of a dam on the
site of the old Wolfley dam of the Gila
Bend Reservoir & Irrigation com'
pany. It i3 understood that Mr. Gil
lespie will greatly enlarge the plant
and will be prepared for the assaults
of the cement trust, which is accused
of having taken advantage of the fin
ancial weakness of the Arizona Port
land Cement company ten years ago.
TIINE CASE PROMPTS FIGHT
TUCSON, May 19. James C. Boul
dln, part owner of the Baca Float,
was arrested late Saturday afternoon
on a charge of flourishing a revolver
in a rude and angry manner and
threatening with a deadly weapon J.
R. Wlcky of St. Louis. He was re
leased on $100 bail furnished by Judge
Campbell and Jack Ryland. Hearing
was set for Thursday. Mr. Bouldin re
fused to discuss the matter last night,
but witnesses were more loquacious.
The mix-up between Bouldin and
Wicky started over the recent filing
of a suit by Wicky and others, against
Bouldin, John Mets and A. R. Grand,
for the recovery of $15,000 alleged to
have been paid for a ten-year lease to )
mining property In the Baca Float,

sociates, had previously been leased
to others and which oBuldin and his
associates had no right to lease.

company.
The company owes $200,000 and had
been working the big Patagonia prop

Richardson. The company was among
the first to shut down on the falling
off of copper prices, after having
made partial payment for the prop
erty. ' The complaint, answer, application
for receivership, and the appointment
of R. E. Fishburn to be receiver, were
developments in the litigation yester.
day.
The complaint alleged non-payment
of goods to the total value of $1,664.64.
It stated that R. R. Richardson had

PROMOTE AMERICANIZATION
PHOENIX, May 19. The state com
mittee on Americanization Is issuing a
series of leaflets to be used as lessons
in the English classes for foreigners
now conducted in 25 centers in the
state. These leaflets have been work
ed out in the Tempe normal school
and are carefully based -on Beshget
urian's Foreigner's Guide to English.
These elementary books are recom
mended for use in the state and are
also used almost exclusively in Cali
fornia. Among the subjects treated
in these leaflets are: "Dangerous
Signals," "Fresh Air." "House Fly,"
and "Story of Benjamin Franklin."
The committee has also prepared a
helpful leaflet for those desiring to
become American citizens. These 'are
being given to those who have learned
the English language and are desirous
of becoming citizens of the land of
their adoption.
JEROME SOLDIERS ORGANIZE
JEROME, May 19. Enthusiasm ran
riot last evening at the meeting of
the former members of -the military
forces of the United States who per
fected their temporary organization,
and made arrangements to affiliate
with the American Legion as soon as
that organization has completed the
details of its formation. The Jerome
dugout promises to become one of the
brightest stars in the galaxy of which
the mother order is composed.
The meeting opened with an ad
dress by Lieut. Lewis Douglas, who
has been investigating the induce
ments the American Legion has to of

In a letter to the Commercial club
the Hoosier Motfer club of Indianapo

information regarding the road from
Indianauolis to Bisbee and thence to
the coast along the Eorderland route

The letter states that many inquir

regarding the route and therefore the
association wishes to be in a position
to furnish the desired information to
motor parties. The Commercial club
has sent the Hoosier club a set of de

CMMIEB FOR
JULY 4TH MID
jt ft t m
mass meeting maices nans
for Independence Day
in Warren District
Wrth Jas. R. Henderson presiding
as chairman, a mass meeting of citlz-.
ens was Jield last night at the city
ball for tlfe purpose of making perma
nent ar rakngements for the staging of
a celebi ytion of welcome in honor of
all sold te.rs, - sailors and marines on
the Four tli of July.
As soori as the meeting was called
to order ?Ir. Henderson was nomi
nated pen nanent chairman without
any opposition. The president of the
Business M Vn's association, who was(
the retiring Vhairman, was made vies- i
chairman, an 0. Tom. Egan was made
secretary wit.V Walter S. Lanford as
treasurer. Ot l-er officers 'selected 'at
the meeting w Vre J. J. Bowen, chair
man finance committee, who named
Arthur Kotman, W. E. McKee, Judge
J. L. Winters, i- J- Wilbert, James
Allison and L. J. Overlook as commit
teemen. J. C. Ryan was iTosen as chairman
of the program cor ivnittee and he se
lected W. S. WinfreV. Charles F. Wil
lis, Jesse Yoakum, John Twomey,
Capt. M. E. Cassidy an it Ralph Zeismer
as his assistants. Gei'rge B. Wilcox
was named chairman of the parade
committee with the folk 'ing commit
teemen: Charles M. MKeen, W. S.
Beeman, Lieut. L. E. Bauevtiend, Capt.
V. W. Marshall of Warreil and E. Q.
Snyder. IL D. Ross, Jr., and F. A.
McKinney were chosen as the pub
licity committee.
At the suggestion of Captain Cas
sidy it was decided that thO chair
men of the various 'committors call
on the commanding officer at Bt- Hua
chuca and makei an effort to have
the 10th Cavalry and the regimental
band come toBisbee for the celebra
tion. It was not known if the com
manding officer had full jurisdiction
over such matters and it might l"e
necessary to take the matter up wifi
the commander of the district at Doug-
las.
The chairmen's committee to call on
the military will do so without delay
in order that full arrangements can
be completed for the parade forma
tion, line of march, etc.
The! routing of the parade was
brought up but nothing definite was
decided until the committee reports
on their success or failure with the
army authorities. If the regiment :at
Ft Huachuca comes in for the parade
the procession will be a lengthy one
and probably will form at Lowell and
march west to Bibe'e or form at Bis
bee and march' east to Lowell. The
starting point of the parade will de
pend on where the main celebration
and speaking is to be staged, according
to the committeemen. The possibility
of the parade marching to Warren is
not unlikely. The regiment from Ft.
Huachuca would come mounted it was
the sense of the meeting, and if the
other organizations in the parado
could make the'anarch. which is only
three miles, - it is highly probable
that the parade will take In Warren
and probably disband there inasmuch
as It is in close proximity to the ball
park and the Vista park at Warren
which would furnish ample room tor
speaking to a large vrowd.
The matter of staging a ball game
between a picked team from the Bis
bee and C. & A. clubs and an army
nine was brought up and Chairman
Henderson thought that that matter
should be held in. abeyance - until
the army teams ..were heard from.
He thought that an army team from
Huachuca would ' prove a better at
traction as they could bring their band
along.
Lieutenant Jones, athletic director
of the 10th Cavalry, has a string of
boxers that he is anxious to bring here

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONOS
NEW YORK, May 19. Trading on
the stock exchange today was influ
enced to a large extent by the open
ing of he extra session of congress,
to which the financial community
looks for early relief, and an unusual
demand for several of the more pop
ular shipping shares.
Rails, oils and some of the many
industrials and unclassified special-1
ties also participated, but heavy sell-!
ing, presumably for profits, effected i
a general reversal later.
The first selling movement centered
around American International and
Canadian Pacific, and equipments, but
was followed by a sharp rally. In the
iSinal hour offerings assumed wider
dimensions .embracing United States
Steel and affiliated industrials.
There was a counter demonstration
in Texas company and Mexican Pe
troleum while the rest of the active
list was sagging, the market showing
a confused and irregular tone at the
close. Sales amounted, to 1,550,000
shares." ." '
Monetary conditions were unchang
ed, little or no time funds being of
fered, while call loansruled at 5V per
cent,
The bond market .was firm, low
grade rails being in demand. Changes
in domestic and war flotations were
nominal. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $10,700,000. Old United
States bonds unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 19. Unwelcome
rain together with higher quotations
on hogs strengthened today the corn
market. The finish, although unset
tled was at 1 to 2 cents Advance,
with July ..1.61 to $1.61 and Sep
tember $1.55 to $1.55., Oats gained
to cents and provisions 12c to
75 cents.
Corn traders acted; foi .the most
part on the assumption that wet
weather would retard the crop move
ment as well as- delay planting. At
the same time strength in the hog
market show that the feeding value
of corn was agaif bullish factor. Be
sides country offerings to arrive were
small and the visibl esupply decreas
ed to a total of less than one-quarter
of the aggregate a year ago. Oats
sympathized with the formness of
corn. In addition, . export sales of
300,000 bushels were noted, and a de
cided falling off in the visible supply.
Word that vessels had been desig
nated for June and July shipments of
provisions helped td lift provisions.
On the bulge, however stockyard in
terests turned sellers.

NEARS REALIZATION
(Special to The Review.)
GILA BEND, May 19. After many
months of negotiation, the heav
iest real estate transaction in the
history of the state was consum
mated yesterday in which F. A. Gil
lespie and his son, B. A. Gillespie, ac
quired 72.000 acres of land near Gila
Bend and the property of the Gila
Water company of which latter, Judge
C. F. Ainsworth was the principal
owner. M. J. Murphy was the holder
of an option on the land from the
Santa Fe Railroad company, which
some years ago had laid Mokl scrip
on it.
The details of the transaction have
not been fully made public, but it is
understood that not less than $1,000,
000 was involved in it. The promoters
of the deal were Mr. Murphy and W.
T. Smith. The elder Mr. Gillespie is
an oil magnate of Oklahoma. His son
has for some time been a resident of
the city, with offices in the Gooding
building.
Canal and Damsite Included
The property of the Gila Water com
pany consists of about 40 mile of
canal and a damsite near Gila Bend,
the site of the old Wolfley dam con
structed in 1892-3.
About 30 years ago Lewis Wolfley,
former governor of Arizona, under the
Harrison administration, organized
the Gila Bend Reservoir & Irrigation
company for the purpose of reclaim
ing a large area of desert land along
the lower Gila. He interested in the
project a group of Peoria, Ills., cap
italists who had already become inter
ested in the Salt River valley, among
them the late J. B. Greenhut, the well
known distiller and later New York
merchant, whose death occurred a few
months ago.
A canal 40 miles in length was con
structed and the dam, which was then
perhaps the most extensive artificial
reservoir in the west, was nearly fin
ished in 1893, when it was washed out
bya flood. Itepairs were made but
again the dam went out.

f announcement!
With; Mr. C. W. Boswell as Representati ve.ve, the! Southwestern Oil & Develop
ment Co. has opened an office in Bisbee, the location , of which will be published in
the next few days. , : . ;
The Southwestern Oil Development Company has been organized by prominent
business men of El Paso, Arizona and New Mexico to mine for, produce, manu
facture, refine and deal in petroleum, refined oil, gasoline and all other products of
crude petroleum, and market and sell the same; to produce, purchase and acquire
the crude oil necessary therefor, and to contract, or otherwise acquire, operate and :
maintain all plants, refineries, structures, machinery, equipment, appliances and
other things necessary to that end: ,

er, Attorney; E. P.. Lerner, El Paso; J. C. Efrom
son, Tyrone, N. Mex.; M. E. Cassidy, Bisbee, Ariz.;
Rex Rice, Douglas, Ariz.
The organizers and stockholders of this Com
pany occupy positions of prominence and trust In
the largest and most - successful commercial, mining
and banking industries of the Southwest.
Plan of Organization
Referring to the plan of the organization, the '
company is a joint association, operating under a
Delaratiou of Trust, being the same form of or-
ganization as adopted by the Magnolia' Petroleum
Company, the Standard Oil Company and other
large concerns. The capital stock of the company
is $2,000,000. Of this amount $600,000 will be Of
fered to the public at the present time and -the pro
ceeds from the sale of same will be used in the
purchase of properties and their development. The
remainder of the stock Will remain in; the treasury
r to be sold later at a period In the company's his-'
, tory when - it will need money for ' refining and
transportation purposes. .
Special Advantages
The company has I been organized for the ben
efit of the investor and stockholder; not for the
benefit of the officers or organizers who are not
profiteering at the expense of the public. This
you can readily understand from ' the ' followirig
statements:
1. The company was organiezd without any
properties whatsoever, same to be acquired from
time to time for cash at actual market value.
2. No landlC leases, or properties of any kind
have been sold by the officers or organizers of the
company.
3. There is absolutely no promotion stotk giv
en to anyone.
4. The officers have purchased -large blocks
of stock themselves, paying therefor par value, the
same price at which the stock is now being offered ;
to the public.
5. Not one share of stock has ever been sold
for less than par to any one.
6. All stock sold has been paid for in catth, no
notes having been taken by the company Tor any
stock.
7. The officers of the company have agreed ;
to donate'their time without salaries until the bus
iness of the company would Justify payment of
same. ;
8. The entire issue of stock has been under
written on the basis of less than 15r-. The under
writers bearing the entire expense of advertising,
literature and salesmen's commissions, thus assur
ing to the investor that the remainder of his money
will be used in a careful and intelligent manner for
the production of oil and refining thereof.' This is
the only Oil company of which we have any knowl
edge advertising Its underwriting fee,
9. All parties subscribing to stock" at this time
will be given an option to buy for cash on or be
fore February 21, 1921, ore and one-half times the
number of . shares subscribed atthelr par value.
The granting of this option to the purchasers of
stock may be discontinued at any time without no
tice. This of course does not affect the option
contract previously given..-; , .
10. Under the By-Laws ! the Trustees are re
quired to pay each year in cash dividends at least
50rc of the net surplus earnings of the previous
year.
11. All operations and investments will be con
ducted under, the guidance and advice of a first
class geologists.
12. For the present all drilling operations will
be carried on in proven districts, thus reducing the
element of risk to a minimum.
Anyone wishing to take advantage of this proposition can do so by telephoning or
Li
calling upon Mr. Boswell, who will be glad to give all information regarding loca
tion of land, etc.
