At this stage the interview was in

for;h herein are of vital importance,
and
rhat is more still, they are true:
The Infantry' Utility
"The infantry." S3id sergeant
relectively. "hold the front line
trenches. In fact, they do about
everything in the army. A first-cl3ss
infantryman has to be a first-cless
machine gunner, an engineer, a
bomber, a scout, a drill instru-tor. a
03 : sniper, and everything else you can
''.j-'name or think of. unless it is a flier
inland an srti'ieryman." Ypu see. it is
this way:
When an advance is made the in-

take an enemy trench it ts built to
oppose you from the front. It is faced
with a parapet. Behind is what we
call a paradox. "Wei", unen we take
a trench we have to reverse it. You
see, it is not built to resist attack
from the rear. We have to build a
fire-stp wait, and I'll teU you what
1
: that is. It is a place to mount and
jfire from over the parapet. A trench
is too deep for a man to stand in and:
aim a gun over me top.
Digging In
i There are no engineers among the
stormers of a trench. The boys have
to drop their guns and rig that ditch
: for a counter-attack.
I "Again, when we attack and fail to
J tahe trenches but have to hold our
I ground, we dig in. And this is some
j job. believe me, with the shrapnel
; bursting about you. No engineers
' fcere; it s every chap for .himself.
The infantry also have to connect
"? trenches hastily dug. and they
ha
ve to block the intersections in cap
tured trenches to be safe from sur
prise attacks.
"These chaps of the infantry in the
first eitack also have to string the
20-foot belt of barbed wire as addi
tional protection. And they build the
sri- wire." which is set upon iron
stakes about three feet sigh and is a
n:'ch;y good protection from surprise

"Take it all in alL when there is
ground to be gained or a place to take
or an attack to stop, the infantry lad
"There is also a lot of wild notions
about a bombing raid, rt rs pulled off
.merely to gain information and to
;and (here the sergeant smiled) to kill
as many Germans as possible. No one
is ever ordered to go on a bombing
raid. They always call for volunteers.

ammunition and machine guns. .
The Army's Eye.

Fioneering
"And there is another set of boys
I want to speak of, if yon don't mind;
they are the pioneers. Strictly work
ers, these boys; not fighters at all.
They carry a shove! instead of a gun
They work under fira. too. I remem
ber at the first battle of Ypres, in June
of 1916. I was with a party out on pa
trol when we met a gang of the pio
neers advancing towards the front
lines. 'Where are you going?" called
out our officer. 'To the front line to
consolidate a trenc.fc.' replied one of
those chaps. 'Where are your arms?"
asked the officer. 'We are workers.
not fighters.' answered the fellow.
They don't fight, but many are killed.
About the French
"The French? You ask of them? I
admire them more than I can tell vou. I
You cannot praise toera too highly, no
matter how hard yon try. I'm proud
" iuc 1 uouiius 11 a lliau -
for I'm one myself, but those French
fighters are devils. Their seventy
five is a miracle. There is a saying
on the.battle line that the safest place
to crawl is in a shell hole, for the g'tn
won't strike twice in the same place.
But I have seen French seventy-five
gunners place thirty shells in the same
old hole out of thirty-two shots. Sii
shots a minute they shoot, too, with
two mile range and an eighteen pound
or three-inch shell.
"Dont let them tell you France is
anvthing like through. She is full of
fight yet. Those French troops are
better than the Prussians, man for
man in any old kind of fighting.
"And I also admire the English. I
am free to admit that I did not think
much of them when we first went over:
I could see nothing but the Canadian?
then. But I quickly changed my mind. !
All those English regiments are great
fighters. None better in the world :
And the English officers are as fine,
lads as one could wish to foltow. Al-
ways out in front of-the men; not
bulking behind like the German f 1
ficers always do in an attack. I have 1
seen mere English lads in their teens!
walking in front of their men In a ram
of death jauntily swinging a little cane
Foolish, you say? Not a bit of it.
Nothing cheers and heartens the men
like this kind of eighteen karat, kid
glove bravery.
"The bovs who enlist from this 'dis
trict I can get into the Duke of Corn
wall's English regiment, if they desire.
It is one of the old famous English
regiments, and has a grand reputation,
made in this war. No better regiment

Sunday Morning Sermon
"And when Peter was come to himsm ne said.
Now I know of a truth that the Lord hath sent
forth His angel and delivered me out of the hand
of Herod." Acts 11-11.
Peter was in a Roman prison and the Roman ruler
had promised the Jews he would turn the apostle over
to them the next day, knowing full well tney intended
to stone him to death. In the night an angel came
and broke Peter's chains and shattered his dungeon locks
and led him through his stricken guards far out along
the highway to freedom. Peter himself was evidently
dazed during this procedure for when he came to' him
self the angel had vanished and he stood alone ender the
stars giving thanks to Heaven for his deliverance.
This was a miracle.
But to this day, in some form or other, a good angel
comes at times to all of us and leads us from our prison
cell of indifference or depression or evil or pride or mis
fortune and delivers us from the hand of some Herod
or other and then leaves us to stand alone by our own
efforts.
Happy is be. like Peter, who recognizes from what
Sunday Morning, January 1918."

Review subscribers not receiving a copy of The Bisbee
Daily Review before S a. m. will t ne promptly by
special Western Union Messenger by telephoning the
Circulation Department , No. 39. The Review will con
aider It a favor if the Irregularity of delivery reported
to the Circulation Department. The Messenger Service
applies to Bisbee only. . 1 Source I tip came and gives praise for it with thankful
i hnmilifv. and who. like Peter, oresses on h. the road of
anty. courage and faith.
We toil and try so hard and our triumphs are so Tew
and our tribulations are so many. The Romans of mis
fortune and depression seize us and throw us in the
prison of despair. The Jews of doubt and danger and
degradation clamor for cur poor body and record and
reputation. But always at the darkest hour before the
dawn there comes some kind of an angel thought or
white robed hope or shining faith or celestial courage
to pull us through and save us from ourselves and from
our enemies. That is, they come, if we are like Peter,
unbroken and undismayed and ready to arise and follow
them to the free air under the stars.
The reviler and the weakling and the worthless one
generally lie where they falL . , . .
Bnt for the man who has honestly tried his best
and who made a good fight and struck hard for his faith
or his friend or his home or those who had faith in him.
ah. for this man. no matter what his misfortunes or his
betrayals or his failures, there comet h in the darkness
a shining shape and leads him safely from the sword,
the lock, the cell, the stone, the death.
But he must do his part, else this angel visit has
been all in vain. 'He must smile a little through his
tears and walk upon his wounded feet and strike with
his tired arm. He must make every possible effort of
his own to keep his obligations and his promises and his
friendships and his faith.
That angel presence led Peter from one peril only to
set his feet upon a road tbat led to a still greater peril.
And there came a time to this same Peter when he again
faced death and no an&el came. But the fisherman of
Galilee showed then that he was worthy of that fTrst
rescue. His gentle face did not blanch nor did his
steadfast glance fail whn death met him in that road
to Rome. His work was done, and he knew it ; well done.
Why should he fear? Tbat is all any man can do upon
this earth below. If a man has done his best he is
braver than himself. If he has been a time server, a
shirker, a trickster, a double dealer, he is a coward twice
over when he comes to tace the inevitable.
Angels visit us unawares. But they come, neverthe
less. Come in the form oi a brave friend, a kind word .j

Copper, peace and material, barometer of civili
zation, foundation and finished product of many of the
arts and sciences, is synonymous with Arizona. With
healthy conditions effecting this reddest of hard metals,
the forty-eighth Star U prosperous and content An
epidemic of economic stagnation brings woe and suffer
ing In its wake to this great commonwealth. For 1918
the residents of the state may well look forward to a
large measure of health - in Una department of the
future; but. at the same time, they may better be pre
pared for any eventuality that might occur.
In 1S65, eighteen million pounds of copper were pro
duced in the United States. Fifty-two years later, the
production mounted to two billion pounds. The advance
in metal mining has kept pace with the progress ot
science and industry. Domestic consumption for 1917.
is so interwoven with war demands that no accurate
estimate can be made of it- If. however, the consump
tion coald be estimated on the average Increase :a the
use of the metal from 1S99 to 1912. it would have totaled
over one billion and a half pounds of the metal In the
face cf an estimated war consumption of one end one halt
billion pounds of copper the natural eonclusron may ap
pear anything but comforting.' Several certainties must be
considered, however, in reaching any fair forecast for
the future
Germany, leader in many lines of industry prior to
1914, was a great buyer of copper. The Hud has been
out of the market sicca war was declared. He has
melted his church bells, his copper lined roofs, his pots
aud other utensils, containing copper. - Given peace con
ditions and this great business will return. Germany
will cot allow itself to fall Into an abyss of productive
inaction. It must speed up or sink from the face of the
earth as a world power.
- Another feature to be considered Is the domestic
possibilities of copper, after the war. With the electri
fication of railways, which has just been started, the
topper production will andoubted'y be pushed to its
limit and all of the mines now operating and many others
win see prosperity. So the future after the war
seems assured. The war future is assured
There is one feature of after war conditions, however,
wh!.-b is fraucht with pitfalls and with uncertainty.
When a man's house is destroyed by fire it is a rare j
thing for him to begin construction when the embers j
become coll. With a world conflagratlo-c, instead of a
honsehold b'aze. the danger of an inactive industrial In
terim increases many time.s. Finance .credit, trust and
national confidence has leen pulled out of Its ordinary j jcty. jear
channel. It must be teadjus'ed before industry will j ,f peter ., nU hMrU hj!(, rded his duty as a

Mow
A representative of this company, now in California in connection with the closing of a contract tor drilling a
well on the property of the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING COMPANY in the CHINO VALLEY, wires that he
has contracted for COMPLETE DRILLING EQUIPMENT, absolutely complete in every detail, including casing,
and that the first carload of material will be on the ground within about ten days time at the latest.
Already, full material and supplies for the completion of preliminary construction work has been purchased
and this work is now going forward under competent management.
The Boom Is On in Chino Valley
WE MEAN BUSINESS. This company has followed a most conservative policy in the conduct of its financ
ing campaign. We have not had much loud blowing of trumpets, but with strong men back of the company, we
have kept consistently driving away in a clean-cut manner, with the result that we have won the confidence cf the
public, and they have demonstrated that confidence by supporting us in the cleanest speculative proposition ever
offered the investing public of this state.
We Are Going Down After the Oil
When stock of this company was first offered the public, we frankly stated that we made no promises of bring
ing in oil we do not make any now but we DID PROMISE THIS that we would GO DOWN AFTER THE
OIL, and the announcement at the beginning of this advertisement speaks for itself. We have promised every man
who bought stock in this company, that we would spend his money judiciously that we would spend it toward the
actual development of our property in the CHINO VALLEY---and that is just exactly what we ARE DOING.
Oil in Chino Valley Means Millions
to the People of Arizona
Are you going to take a chance of a hundred dollars or so. with the opportunity of having it returned to you
possibly a thousand times over when oil is struck? DO YOU APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE GREAT
EST FORTUNES IN THE WORLD HAVE BEEN MADE IN OIL?
DO YOU KNOW THAT NO FORTUNE WAS EVER MADE WITHOUT SOME HAZARD, AND THAT
ONLY $100.00 invested in UNITED CHINO OIL now, will bring you in more money than you could save in a life
time, if we are successful in bringing in OIL?
Shares to Advance in Price
Shares of the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING COMPANY, the company which is REALLY GOING
AFTER OIL, will not be obtainable for many more days at the present price of 2c per share cash and 2 cents more
when oil is struck. The moment our drilling equipment is on the ground, the price of this stock will POSITIVE
LY BE ADVANCED. '
This will be a very short time, and it is highly probable that before next payday rolls around, the price of the
stock may be doubled. DONT HESITATE ON THIS THING show that you've got some red blood take a
chance with a clean-cut company that gives you a square run for your money, and reap the benefit of their efforts o
REALLY FIND OIL in the CHINO VALLEY.
If you can't pay all today, see our representatives or send in a deposit to hold a few thousand shares for you
and pay the balance the next two or three paydays as you can spare it. WE DONT WANT YOUR MONEY if you
can't spare it we don't want any man to speculate with us with money that he needs for necessities but if you can
spare a hundred dollars or so, come in with us and take a chance. By making your reservations NOW, and making
a deposit, you can get the benefit of the present price evch though the price may be raised before you finish pay
ing for your stock.
UNITED CHINO OIL
Is controlled by ARIZONA MEN; whose entire interests are within the State of Arizona it is TO THEIR
INTEREST to protect your interests.
If There Is Oil Under Our Ground We'll Find It
You can't lose much and you stand a mighty good chance of cleaning up a real fortune frbm an investment
of a few dollars.

Great Amount of Money
In Annual Turnover of
State's Copper Mines
Two Hundred Million Dollars Received by Arizona Metal
Producers for Their MetaL At This Figure, However, Due
to Taxes, Increase in Costs of Everything, the Net Is Far
Less Than Year Ago. Some Interesting Labor Figures.
According to figures for 1917. returns received from all petals mined in
Arizona except copper totaled something less than $14,000,000. as compared
with over $200,000,000 received for the copper produced In the state.
Partial figures on disbursements of the copper producers include $62.
000.000 paid out in wages, $21,000,000 federal tax. $7,000,000 county and state
tax, $24,000,000 increase in cost of supplier over 1916. $44,000,000 in divi
dends, making a total of $135,000,000.
The expense account covered by the $13J.OO0,00O includes nothing for fuel,
timbers, steel, new equipment or other supplies, except the advanced cost
over 1916. and nothing for depreciation of equipment and exhaustion of ore
bodies (except as taken care of in dividends), with no allowance for interest
charges, salaries, transportation charges, electronic treatment of copper,
marketing expenses or other smaller items of expense. All or these must
be covered from the $42,000,000 remaining after disbursements of the $158.
000.000. As freight on copper produced and electrolytic treatment of this
alone represents an iteji of around $17,500,000 annually, the $42,000,000 fails
of appearing to be a very large amount to cover so much ground. j
Deducting the $17,500,000. there is left $24,500,000. Presuming that it
were possible to retain all of this, but 12 per cent working capital for the
succeeding year would be in hand, an amount that any business man engaged

plan at that will decline the present year, unless copper is put much higher. ,
If that is not done the proportion or wageswill grow much larger as com-1
pared with dividends, although a shrinkage in the total of wages will neces-1
sarily occur, for although the same daily
will have to be mined and a fewer number of men employed.
Some Labor Statistics
When the federal labor administration commission appointed this week
to direct the general handling and distribution or labor in the Tnited States,
and to recommend what manner or work shall be carried on and what shall ,
be suspended as unnecessary in war times, reaches Arizona in the course or (
its investigations, it will find the state paying a total or wages in excess of
many other state with three to ten times the population and with from one
and a half to more than two times the number of wage earners. j
Comparison of Arizona with a New England, an eastern, a northwestern .
and a southern state affords illumination along the line indicated. Following ;
is a brief table:
Arizona
Rhode Island
Maine
Minnesota
West Virginia
Of Arizona's total wages qf $71,000,000. the copper mining industry pays
$62,400,000. employing 40.000 men of the total of 50,000 employed in the
state. The $62,400.00 is earned by men working eight hours the day. six
days the week. Allowing 20 per cent increase in wages to the Rhode Island
men since the government figures quoted for the state were made, and the
113.000 men employed in that state will still be found to be drawing a few
hundred thousand less than Arizona's 50.000 workers.
Comparison with West Verginia and Minnesota is even more interesting.
one a coal mining and the other an iron mining state. More than double
the number of workers in Minnesota draw but little more than three-fourths
of the wages paid in Arizona. In West Virginia the total wa;e paid to a
third larger number of men is but- about two-thirds or the total paid in
Arizona. j
The average or wages in its mining industry. affordingTour-fifths of all
the employment in the state, is higher In Arizona than in any other mining
st?te in the country. Should the federal labor administration commission
start in on the establishment of a standard wage scale throughout the mining
and other industrial divisions of the country, as has been indicated as a
probahle course, in the mining division It will either have to lower the present '
pay in Arizona or lift the pay in every other state ror mine, mill and smelter
work to correspond with Arizona.
Outlook for Copper
Investors in coppers who fail to look beneath the surface of figures pre
sented by a certain class or brokerage offices and financial writers are as
iuch misled by the things these figures do not point out as are the miners
in the west who gather from the same fieures that all is profit to their
employers except the day wages they receive.
Arizona copper producers are cited as having received ror their product
in 1917 over $200,000,000, as compared with $191,000,000 in 1916. notwith
standing alleged less production or metal in Arizona in 1917. The gain cf
$9,000,000 may be granted as having been received, but it is not explained

I very large part of the crust to be met-ts are lime-tone, which deposit
made up or old lavas from extinct vol-
canos. To study these lavas and their
effens on the other rocks with which
; they come in contact, it is necessary
'to study two more things che;nis;ry
and mineralogy. Chemistry tells us ex
actly what is in everything and min-
eralogy tells us what form certain
'chemical combinations take, so 1-1 at
! we can tell them at a glance,
j We all know that a large part of
I the crust Of the earth is made up ct
liaiestones, which were formed from
the remains of sea shells, fish, bones,
etc. Coal seams also make up Con
siderable part of the crust, and these.
as we know, were originally sw am pa
a:id forests, wMci have been buriel
and compressed. So geology has to
take in to a large extent the study of
animal ana plant u:e or otology.
To go over what 1 have already said,
geology has to include astronomy,
biology, physiography, chemistry and
miueralogy and mechanics. So you
can see that 1 have a pretty big job
on hand to tell you all about geology
in two-hour lectures. In these lee
tures I am going to state a lot of facts
which have been proved to be true,
and which you will have to swallow-
whole. To any one wishing to find the
I proof to any of my statements, 1 will
be glad to refer him to books which
can be obtained in the library here 'a

The rocks forming the earth's crjst
Can bo divided into three families
( Sedimentary, Volcanic and Meta.nor-
phic. Sedimentary rocks are those

, anj shale, covering almost the whole
1 gurfjoe gouih of Tombstone Canyon
and Mule Gulch.
Volcanic rocks are those which
enme up from the bowels of the earth
through cracks in a melted state,
Sometimes they came to the surface
through volcauoes. and at other times
they never reached the surface. They
are easily recognized by the irregular
h mhl;Vn k Tl!
i rst of the formation, and by
' ,h,ir b,,n m,,e UP pf "ystls xn'

To!, a"- w lso another kind of
volcanic rock thrown out or rolling
' out over the surface. These are called
j tuffs and lavas. They w lil oe bed.led
just like a sedimentary rock, but
! usually sh
usually show their origin by the crys-
1 u,s or b;r
I from a smelter. Here in Bishee we
j don't run aotvss any of these kinds of
rock.
Metamorphic rocks are rocks t-hai
used to be either sedimentary or vol
canic rocks, but which have been
crumped up and changed by great
pressure. This pressure may be
caused by one or both of two things:
tl) the crumpling of the crust of the
J earth due to the slow cooling and
shrinking of the interior; or. 12) the
weight of sediments on top. Her in
Hisbee we have an example of t-Ms
1 family of rocks in the Pins! Schist.
on which a large part of the town of
Bisbee is built.
In the study of geology the impor-,
tant thing to always bear In mind Is
that ia the history or the earth a mil-

baking w ithin a foot or two of the con
tact. la the case oT a wet intrusion the
gases either come up with the por
phyry or just after. If they come up
with the porphyry the contacts will
be either ore or pyrue. If tie gases
come op later they may come up at
the contacts or may come up through
some other nearby crack or crushed
zone. In this case the contacts may
be barren, and the ore or pyrite at
some distance away. The hot gases
usually come up just alter the intru
sion, is all familiar with present vol
canoes know. Geysers and hot springs
almost always follow an eruption ot
Mount Vesuvius. Mount Etna, Mount
Pelee and other active voKwnoes.
As I hare just slated, ores are car
ried by the hot gases coming up with
"wet inclusions." They are put down
in two ways: (1) in open cracks or
faults, when they are called veins;
and. 2) as replacements of other
rocks, either sediments or volcanic
rocks. Replacement means that the
neir:3- forming the original rock is
dissolved by the gases, and at the
same time sulphide ore takes the
place of the dissolved material
Here in Bisbee most of our ore
bodies are replacement ore bodies,
usually replacing limestone, but also
replacing porphyry (as in Sarramento
Hill and in some of the ore bodies in
the Lowell. Gardner and Sacramento
mines). The ores in taese ore bodies
were ; 1 sulphide ore bodies originally-,
and where they are now, w e call them
primary ores.
.We all know that part of the rain
water sinks into the earth through
cracks. This water goes down to a
certain depth and then stops. This
level is called the water level of the
district. This "ground water" dis
solves air, which contains oxygen. We
are all familiar with this fact from
the bubbles rising from water when
we beat it, just before it reaches boil
ing point. This dissolved air will
oxidize ere and change it into car
bonate and oxide ores, if it is given a
chance.
When me consider again that dur
ing the two land ages since the ores
were put in. there has been twenty
million years more or less for this
ground water to act, yon can see 4 hat
it is really remarkable that we have
anything left but oxide ores, and gos
sans. Gossans are the result of the
action of ground water on sulphides
of iron and copper, where the copper
has not only been oxidized but car
ried away, and deposited somewhere
else.
After the original primary suit 'aide
ores are oxidized, they are called "en
riched" ores, depending on whether
the original sulphides have been
changed to glance or oxide ores.
The oldest rock in the district is
the Pinal Schist, whkh made up me
old original land surface. This Soiiist
is a cetamorpbic rock, made cp ot
quartz grains and mineral called seri
cite. a kind of mica. The rock ha
been so completely altered that there
is no evidence what it was before it
was altered.
The first sedimentary rtx-k to be
deposited was the Balsa quartzite
which is 440 feet thick. This was
originally a sandstone, which has been
compres.-ed by tiie weight of the over
lying sediments into a quartzite.
Aboe this comes 79S feet of Abrigo
limestone. Tins limestone is a very
imur? limestone, with a number of
beds of shale and sandstone. The
shale was deposited originally as
mud. This limestone has also been
changed by tae pressure of the over
lying st-diuenis, so that it now con
sists of thin beds of limestone. shale
and ihin teams of mineral called epi
dote. This epidote on the surface
looks like chert, rncerground it u
grteai.-h. The Abrigo limestone can
be told frcm all others by the thin
beds; usual'y ecu bed i not more
than a coup:e of inches thick, by its
impurity, aud by the absence of fossil
shells.
At the top of the Abrigo limestone
come a white quartzite Ded varying
in thickxiess from a half a foot to 10
feet thick. This is ha: we caii the
capping quartzite.
Above the capping quaruite comes
CIO to ZZ't feet of tiartia limestone, a
co-npact dark grey to nearly blaek
limestone, fairly pure, and with num
bers of beds maie up of fossil shells,
about a half inch ia oiameier.

there were just as nianv in the sedi-

Then follo.ed a long age of erosion :

of the cliffs to the north and a large ,
amount of the sediments to the south
of the Dividend fault had been re
moved, inrluding probably a great deal
of ore. The land surface took the
form then shown by the brown line.

The development of copper nunii.g
in the United States is as synonymous
; with the operation of the Calumet
Hecla as it is with tlie pspans-on of
electricity. How the great Calumet
conelomerate lode was disocn -!red is
still a matter of dispute. People in
Michigan continue to believe tr;it S3

Indian pit in the back yard of hi

of tli- great conelomerate was due to

The task of production preparation
is an enormous one in any mine where
large or bodies are to be handled
with etficiency. The Hercules is no
exception, and its task of getting
ready has taken much time and large
sums of money. The mine, lying east
of the Ray Consolidated ground, is
already well developed on a plan
expected to work toward a high de
gree of efficiency in ore extraction.
A main haulage tunnel has been driv
en, about north and south, connect
ing very lately between the present
main shafts, a drifting, distance of
about 1900 feet This connection
was a remarkable one. the two Crif;
headings exactly matching at the
meeting point. The main haulage
drift is on the 475 level, to handle ail

deposit. A second level is contem
plated at a greater depth, but not for

the evidence of secondary enrichment
existing in that mine. That was in
1S99. It is significant that when H.
H. Rogers was organizing the Amal
gamated Copper combination in 1S9S
he proposed to include the United
Verde, but the negotiations broke
down when Senator dark refm-ec to
allow an examination to be made. So
geologists were persistently excluded
from tbe United Verde, and the sen
ator was so prejudiced against them
that he did not employ one to guide
him or his manager in the dtve'.op
ment of the mine. The consequence
was that the combined effei-ts of
geologic faulting and secondary en
richment were not correctly ap
prehended, and it remained for a rain-

MERITORIOUS FIND
OF ORE IS MADE ON
BOREAS GROUND
For several months the eyes of the
Warren district, speaking from a min
ing viewpoint, have been focused upon
the southern part of the Bisbec, trian-
gle, and particularly upon the deveion-
I ""mt.5 ' "C
and Night Hawk leases. During thej
past ten days the wait has been re-
warded, for the Boreas has cone into!
ore. which has every appearance o
being permanent.
Located on the Boreas claim of the
Copper Queen, immediately west of
the old Soutu Bisbee shaft No. v and
about due north of the old Wade
Hampton shaft of the Copper (Jueen,
the leasers started their shafi. an in
cline affair, about 500 feet soatii of
a dike which follows a southeast
nonhwest direction and goes into the
layered limestone planes hiaher on
the hill. The White Tail Deer s.'iaft
of the Queen is located about one-halt
mile mest of the Boreas shaft a.id the
Night Hawk is between the two and a
little north.
Sinking of the shaft was prot-eruteri
to about the 100-foot level. In several
plfct-es stringers of ore were founl.
They resulted in the shipment of sev
eral cars to the Douglas smelters
From tie 100-foot level a drift was
started north to cut the dike which
appears ou the surface. At j-evera!
points in the dritt gouce formafons
were encountered. At llie contact o!
the fault the character of the .--round
was such that further drifting ia that
direction was abandoned. .
Undaunted, however, the leasers
started drifting west, following a
stringer of carbonate copper ore
About 5 feet west of the shaft t.le
stringer widened and Ik t ween the
hanging and foot wall, both of which
carry better than 12 per cent copper
values, lead carbonate was found.
This widened to an extensive pocket
and is now dipping in a southensterly
directiou. The leasers have already
put 30 tons of the lead carbonate in
their loading bins and are taking out
considerable carbonate copper ore at
the same time.

BITTER FICUT IS
WAGED OVER THE
PENALTY CLAUSE
(By Review Lcaard Wire)
INDIANAPOLIS. Ind, Jan. 1$.
There was an all day discussion in
the miners convention today over the
ratification of the Washington agree
ment negotiated by the soft coal oper
ators and workers and approved by
Fuel Administrator Garfield, opposi
tion to its approval being due to the
Insertion in the contract of the auto
matic penalty clause.
Bitter speeches were made against
the adoption of the clause, but many
delegates urged Its approval, as one of
the beet things the miner can do to
assist in stabilizing the coal industry.
Failure to ratify the agreement, lead
ers said, would being about chaos and
endanger a maximum output of bitum
inous coat It was the general opin
ion ot influential officer of the union
tonight that ft would be ratified by a
large majority.
The Washington agreement gave the
bituminous men a substantial increase
in wages. It contains a clause which
provides that miners shall he fined
one dollar a day for each day they
violate the agreement by going out on
anauthoriied strike or for other viol
ations of contracts, It also calls for
a fine against mine owner ot two
dollar for each man euiDloverf in their
' mine for tailing lo enforce the clause
I against the worker. The agreement
now is in effect subject to the ap
proval of the convention.
Patriotism and loyalty to the Uni'ed
States figured In nearly every speech.
Alex Howatt. president ot the Kansas
miners, who led the opposition to the
: clause, told the delegates they should
not be deceived when they are told
that they are disloyal to the nation
if they Tote against ratification.
Those who favored ratification said
the miners should approve the agree
ment as a patriotic duty tn the pre
sent emergency when millions of per
sons are reeling the pinch of the coal
famine.
' It appeared from the anraments of
the opponents of the agreement that
there waa a fear the operator would
abase the clause and unjustly fine
I men. It was com plained the clause
gives the workers no opportunity to
be heard in case the employers de
ride to withhold part ot the wages a
I fines.
Among those who spoke for the
agreement were International Presi
dent Hives and John Wilkinson, presi
dent ot the Oklahoma. Arkansas and
Texas turner.

Xow that winter is upon as "in full
blast," as it were, we have suddenly
become seriously aware of the short
age of fuel and the patriotic need of
coal conservation. We must keep
warm, and if not in one way then in
aonther. And at the present time the
alternative is to dress more warmly.
This winter furs are being worn for
the purpose which nature originally
created them for warmth and protec
tion from wintry blasts-not ornamen
tation. Xovertheless. the trend of
modern times is to beautify wherever
possible, and because a garment is
useful and practical is no reason why
it should not be decorative as wetl.
Therefore the designers are reveling
in beautiful fabrics and luxurious furs.
Uses for Furs
The warmest of the winter's mate
rials are among the most beautiful,
so that a woman may be comfortable
and still be dressed appropriately for
any occasion. Huge collars and cuffs
of fur give a luxurious appearance to
any garment, and even the' tailor
nade suits are trimmed with them.
