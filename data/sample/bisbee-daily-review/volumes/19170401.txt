fBy Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 31w The
government' war preparation de
veloped important steps today in
all three branches of national de
fense. At the war department orders
were issued calling into the fed
eral service, 7,000 additional na
tional guardsmen and it was an
nounced that detailed plans had
been worked out by the general
staff for raising any larger army
which congress might advise.
"Sub Chasers Busy.
The navy department establish
ed on an official basis the coast
patrol of submarine chasers, and
ordered Captain Henry B. Wilson
detached from his post as com
mander of the super-dreadnaught
Pennsylvania to take charge of
the "mosquito fleet" Bids for
more chaser were opened at the
department. Secretary , Daniels
said he expected soon to have a
large number of the boats in com
mission. Plana for coordination of all defense!
resources outside. the army and navy.
were worked out by the council of na
tional defense and its advisory com
mission, which abandoned its previous
program of mobilizing the country's In
dustries on a peace basis and turned
Its attention to more direct prepara
tions for war.
60,000 Guards Now Active.
National guardsmen from five states
and the District of Columbia are af
fected by today's order, bringing up to
nearly CO.000 the number who have
been summoned for police protection to
industrial plants and other strategic
points.
N. M. Infantry Dropped.
' At the same time the war depart
ment ordered that the First New Mex
ico militia infantry, which never had
attained the national guard status re
quired under the new derense act, be
mustered out of the federal service.
No explanation was made by depart
ment officials, but it was indicated that
the regiment probably was dropped
from the federal force in order to
avoid any confusion winch might arise
because of its unusual status.
While official explanation was that
the national guardsmen ordered out
today were required for police pro
tection it was assumed the Texas or
ganizations probably would be used
for border protection, relieving ap
proximately an equal number of reg
ulars for duty elsewhere.
Fix Patrol Bases.
Orders for submarine chasers are
being placed in great numbers, b'ut
details are withheld for military rea
sons. It was stated officially that with
the designation of Captain Wilson to
command the new fleet all arrange
ments for organization of the patrol
forces has been completed in detail
with more than a score of points along
the Atlantic and Gulf coasts designated
as patrol bases and supply depots.
More than fifty small boat builders
submitted proposals for the construc
tion of chaser and patrol boats of the
110 and 50 foot types. Secretary Dan
iels said the proposals assured the
department it would be able to get
all it wanted within the shortest pos
sible time.
To mobilize industries, the plans of
the defense council for industrial mob
ilization have been worked in consul
tation with the "captains of industry"
and are regarded by all officials as
among the most important measures
in the entire defense program. Details
have not been permitted to become
public, but it is understood steps
taken to secure a united nation behind
the President in the event of war and
to make the most of every industrial
resource are exhaustive and specific.

Sentences Are Void.
fBv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Mar. 31. Attorney
General Gregory announced tonight
that President Wilson would exercise
executive clemency in a large number
of federal prosecutions where suspen
sion of sentence has been nullified by
the supreme court's recent decision
holding such suspensions illegal.
Clemency will be exercised, the at
torney general said, without applica
tions being made in those cases where
pleas of guilty were entered or ver
dicts returned prior to June 15, 1916,
but no sentences pronounced, and in
those cases where the sentence im
posed was less than the period be
tween tfh date of imposition and
June 15. 1917.
The number who will receive par
don or commutations under the ruling
probably will run Into the thousands.

LONDON, Mar. 31. There were
stormy scenes in the reichstag Fri
day, according to a Reuter dispatch
from Amsterdam, when socialist dep
uties foreshadowed the establishment
of a republic and demanded that the
reichstag have larger powers in the
foreign policy.
Dr. Edward David, the socialist
leader, is quoted by the- Cologne Ga
zette as declaring that the imperial
chancellor's words directed to the
new rulers of Russia had transgress
ed the military censorship. Tor th
military authorities had instructed
the press that nothing must be pub
lished appearing like approval of the
Russian revolution. He asked for the
creation of a constitutional democrat

CHIHUAHUA CITY, Mar. 31.
Seventy rebel prisoners taken dur
ing Villa's attempt to capture this
city yesterday were publicly hang
ed today as a warning to the
Villa element of the population,
which is thoroughly awed.
While the city remains protected
by a cordon of infantry, reports havej
been brought to headquarters here byj
cavalry patrols that Villa's scattered j
main forces are concentrating at some:
I western point. They were overtaken
i on their retreat yesterday by a force
I under General Favila and lost about
sixty killed. The booty taken by the
Carranza defenders includes SIS
horses, 700 rifles and three machine
guns.
One General Executed.
Besides the Villa general, Miguel
Saavedra, who was hanged yesterday
immediately after his capture, the
leader, Jose Chavez, who took Santa
Rosalia last fall, was killed.
The prisoners hanged were well
known for their crimes and were re
garded by General Francisco Murguia
as incorrigible. The remainder of the
500 captured have been spared. That
Villa has a strong following here
among the lower classes, was shown
during Villa's short occupation of the
city in . the end of last . November,
j But the sight of the dangling bodies
today had a not ice worthy dispiriting
effect on rebel sympathizers.
All stores were opened today but
the drinking places remained closed.
Villa Retires To Northwest.
A cavalry force left tonight in pur
suit of the enemy in the north western
section of Chihuhua. The flyng col
umn when General Murguia has been
organizing Willi also take the field
without loss of time in order to pre
vent the enemy from reorganizing and
recuperating.

Captured U-Boats" Turn Out
To. Be But Harmless Targets
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Mar. 31. The mystery of the eighteen submar
ines reported captured by an American warship in an anonymous
cable message from Panama said to have been seen by passengers
on the steamship Advance off Wat.'ing Isalnd. was cleared today by
the Rev. and 'Mrs. Thomas H. Candor of the Presbyterian board of
foreign missions, passengers on the steamer Carrillo, from Panama.
The clergyman said the reported U-boats were merely a proces-
sion of harmless naval targets in tow of seven warships, each war
ship having lines attached to two or three targets.
The Carrillo, bound for New York, passed the "captured Sub
marines" off Salvador about the time that the Advance, steaming
southward, did likewise.

PHILADELPHIA, Mar. 31. Reso

rights were adopted here today at a
patriotic demonstration in Independ

cific coasts figuratively shook hands
at the shrine of American independ
ence when Hiram Johnson, of Califor
nia, brought an inspiring message of
patriotism from the people of the
west.
During the meeting a message of
welcome was sent to the people of the
Virgin Islands, who today came under
the protection of the flag of the Unit
ed States, and at the end of the exer
cises, a resolution in addition to the
pledge of loyalty was adopted urging i

tion, and the spirit of America will

Senator Itois Penrose declared that

DEMOCRATS SLATED
TO WIN IN HOUSE
(By A. Valjean)
JEROME, Ariz., Mar. 31. This dis
trict is about to lose a distinctive
feature, one which has not failed to
furnish thrills for all of its first time
visitors. The loss will be made up
for, however, through the bringing
about of a great deal of benefit in les
ser transportation costs to mining
companies along the mineralized belt,
to business men of the city and to the
public generally, for there is involved
the abatement of the necessity which
has to .this time prevailed of making
the steep haul to and from the nar
row gauge depot along the tortuous,
winding road up the mountain side.
The plan as it is working out is to
build a standard gauge . line from
Clarkdale to the baseball park, near
the center of Jerome, this line to con
nect with the Santa Fe at Clarksdale
and to carry its passenger and freight
trains into Jerome. The standard
gauge line will also connect with the
new steam shovel pit of the United
Verde, the terraces of which are to
be standard tracked.
In voluntarily bring'ng the Santa
Fe into the city, the I'nitcd Vdde is
considered to have exercise 1 a:i ex
ceedingly liberal degree of public
spirit, for in so doiun it ab.-'Ucions a
very- lare amount of local business
which it necessarily gets for its stan
dard: gauge railroad 'inder txisting
conditions.
Other recent public spirited moves
of the company include announce
ment that the present foe- story
brick hospital building will tuined
over to the miners for free -.'uk rooms
just as soon as the new hospital biu'd
ing Is finished. The company nas al
so lately donated ground in the heart
of the city for the establishment of a
modern rest room station lor ihe pub
lic. During the week il gave over to
the city the private -ewer system
which had been operate! through a
considerable part of the town. It will
be merged in- the sewe,- system for
which bonds were recently urted, the
remarkable record being made in this
matter of a unanimous vote in lavor
of the bonds.
HAVE DARK HAIR
ANDLOOK YOUNG
Don't stay gray! Nobody can
tell when you darken gray,
faded hair with Sage
Tea and Sulphur.
Grandmother kept her hair beauti
fully darkened, glossy and attractive
with a brew of Sage Tea and Sulphut.
Whenever her hair look on that dull,
faded or streaked appearance this
simple mixture was applied with won
derful effect. By asking at any d-u
store for "Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur
Compound." ybu will get a large bottlp
of this old-time recipe, improved by the
addition of other ingredients, all ready
to use, for about 50 cents. This
simple mixture can be depended upen
to restore natural color and beauty
tj the hair.
: A well-known downtown druggist
says everybody uses Wyeth's Sagp
and Sulphur Compound now because
it darkens so naturally and evenly
that nobody can tell it has been ap
plied it's so easy to use, too. You
simply dampen a comb tr soft brush
and draw it through your hair, taklns
one strand at a time. By morning the
gray hair disappears; after another
application or two. it is restored to Its
natural color and looks glossy, rtft
and beautiful. This preparation Is a
delightful toilet requisite. It Is not
intended for the cure, mitigation or
prevention of disease.

setts, Progressive, whom the n'.pu!.ii
cans hoped would confer with them,
arrived today and announced that he
would vote first for Representative
Lenroot, Republican, for speaker.
There was only one display of open '
insurgency at the conference. IV. hir
ing he would vote only for Mr. Lc:-;
root, for speaker, Representative:
Gardner of Massachusetts bolted th1
meeting after failing to obt iin ndnp-1
tion of a resolution to provide that
members present should not be bound i
by conference action. Representatives : der
Gray, of New Jersey, and Dallinger, of j memorial
Massachusetts, left with Mr. Gardner.
but Mr. Dallinger returned later and
Republicans were hopeful tonight that
they would be able to induce him to
vote for Mr. Mann.
Immediately after Mr. Gardner's
withdrawal Representative LongworMi
of Ohio, offered a resolution to bind
the members to vote for the confer
ence nominees, and asked that it be
voted down. This was done by a
large vote, leaving the 195 members
who voted for Mr. Mann free to sup
port whom they please on Monday
when balloting on house organization
begins.
The prevailing impression that the
Democrats will organize the house
with Champ Chirk as speaker gained
further support today with tiie an
nouncement that Representative Hel
geson of North Dakota, a Republican
would be unable to be present Mon
day. There is at least one other He
publican whose attendance is doubt
ful and the Democrats declared to
ni,Tht t.'iere was not the slightest doubt
that Speaker Clark would have the
necessary votes to elect. In that
event Mr. Mann is expected to be con

Some days ago a fire practically gutted two buildings j
within the fire limits of the city. Both are of the old type,
of frame construction and a menace to life within them
and to property nearby. It has been rumored that one
or both will be repaired.
There is a city ordinance which prohibits the expendi

of non fire-proof property on repair after a fire within
the fire limits. The council appears to be behind the
ordinance and will prevent any more in repairs being ex

WAR OR PEACE?
Meeting tomorrow in extraordinary session the
congress of the United States, brought together at
the call of the President, will consider one of the
gravest questions ever presented to a deliberative
body in the history of this nation. Today Uie prayer
of the entire country is for peace. Today we are
hoping against hope thai something will come to pass
which may avert the calamity of war. But the
prayer of this country and the hope of citizens is
builded upon right and right must prevail even
though we are swept into the malestrcm of the con
flict April, in the history of the United States, had
started many momentous movements. The fourth
month in our calcnadr year has been chosen, through
some agency, as the period of the year in which con
gress has taken action in the declaration of war
upon several occasions.
Congress proclaimed an end to the war cf the Re
volution in April; Washington became the first presi
dent of the new republic in April, 17S9; the begin
ning of the war with Mexico was April 14, 1S46; the
civil war began, with the firing on Fort Sumpter, on
April 12, 1SS1, and the same conflict, with the sur
render of Lee, was ended April 9, 1SC5. In 1S98, cn
April 22, the United States declared war on Spain.
Congress has been called together "to receive a
communication concerning grave matters of national
policy." Occurances since the adjournment -of the
body have been piling up to the bolnt,"though no
actual state of war exists, that the United States is
practically forced to defend itself against a ruthless
nation, a government which smiles and writes well
and sends its submarines, in the dark, to ply upon
the commerce and the lives of neutral nations.
There are in the United States those who may en
deavor to tie the hands of congress and the Presi
dent of the couiftry. Those people, no doubt, are
urging their propaganda in full faith that they are
right in their stand. They are for "peace at any
price." Fortunately for our future, for our very
existence, the great body of Americans is not of the
same mould. If it were not for the fact that many1"
of the self-styled pacifists are known to be men and
women of courage a charge of cowardice would not
be wanting.
' At such a time, in such a period, when American
ism is supposed to stand for right, the appearance
of the pacifists is extremely unfortunate. They en
cumber the government, the very country, from se
curing either by might or otherwise, the very objects
for which we, as a people, stand. In the past two
years of war, the pacifists may take full credit upon
themselves for the attitude of Germany. That coun
try could well believe that a nation, so divided against
itself and so split into opposing opinions regardng
the rights cf neutral lives and commerce, could (or
would) never stand for its belief and teachings.
Congress, in its wisdom, directed by a President
who is an American in the truest sense of the word,
can be depended upon to do what is right The
time has passed for the playing of partisan politics,
for the weilding of the club as between leaders of op
posing parties. The United States is threatened
with a plague of autocratic feudalism, of brigand
age, of artful and fearful piracy, which must be
stopped.
Should the worst be decided upon tomorrow or in
the succeeding days of the session, the nation must
stand behind its choseu leader and congress. There
will be no backsliding, there will be no retrels from
a taken stand. The government must and will be
supported.
. Though hanging on the border of a foreign coun
try and cognizant of the situation effecting that na
tion, Arizona stands ready to shoulder its part of the
responsibility. The splendid manhood and woman
hood of this state, coming down from the best of all
countries and imbued with the fret dam and L'ic pro
'gres of modern America, is a unit in realizing that
the (llnited 'States should have""peace if possible Imt
war rather thau national degradation or humiliation."
business property the location could hardly be improved
upon, outside of the two main business thoroughfares.
The time has come when the construction of dangerous
buildings must stop in Bisbee. Fire prevention and com
mon sense demand that better buildings be the order
of the day. The people of Bisbee will stand behind the
mayor and common council in any stand they may take in
this direction. It will mean better things for Bisbee
and the transformation of the character of the structures
from frame to something more permanent and stable and
less of a menace.
EDUCATING EX-EMPERORS.
The ex-emperor of China, the little Manchu boy who
abdicated in 1912 when the Chinese republic was or
ganized, is coming to the United States to finish his edu
cation. It's a good place for him to come to. Any scion of any
rcyal house might derive a lot of benefit from a prolonged
stay in this country and a careful study of our institu
tions and traditions. We'll be glad to see his ex-ioya!
highness, and will be glad to put in his way all possi
bilities for lnstructon and self-improvement.
iuaybe what he learns here will really be useful to
him later on. The republican government of China is
none too securely established, and it isn't at all impos
sible" that the Chinese nation one of these days may stop
swinging between the two political extremes of absolut
ism and democracy and compromise on a constitutional '
monarchy. In that case, little eleven-year-old Hsuan
Tung' may eventually be recalled to the throne of his
ancestors. If there is no such a revolution, he may in
time return home, as so many Chinese students have done,
and help as a private citizen in the work of remaking
China after the political model of the United Statr-fr""""!
Really, it's a fine business, this educating foreign !
royalty. Merely living among us would be a liberal cdu- j
cation for most of the world's crowned heads. And we're
ready any time to take any such heads that happen to
oe discrowned, and make the best of them we can, even
if they're wcoden beads. We're ready right now to tackle
the job of bringing the Romanoffs, Hohenzollenis and
Hapsburgs to a better understanding of the world they
live in.
The week of November 12 to 17 was
chosen as the date of the 1917 fair at
a recent meeting of the state fair com
mission held in Phoenix, and an
nounced by Secretary Tom Shaugh
nessy a day or two ago. This date
conforms to the dates fixed by the

MORE CONVENIENT TELEPHONE.
A device combining the transmitter and receiver of
the telephone has been invented by a woman in Memphis,
Tenn. The invention Is described in The Papula." Science
Monthly.
The receiver is mounted where the transmitter is ou
the regular telephone. It has a small horn just largf
enough to throw the sound forward about twelve inches.
The transmitter is placed directly in front or the receiver,
but in such a position that it does not interfere with t'.ic
sounds coming from the receiver and does not throw the
speaker's own voice back to him. A hood surrounds
both receiver and transmitter.
When a telephone conversation Is about to start, the
instruments are connected with the telephone lines re
pressing a button. By holding the face close to the hood,
the conversation can be carried on with privacy.
And best of all. both hands are free. There is no wearl
some holding of the receiver. It is a simple matter to
reach out for pad and pencil if there is" anything to be
recorded.
The device makes it easier fo rtho lady of the houso
to do her morning ordering, checking up prices and re
vising her lists while she talks. Aud it should rertaiuly
be a boon to any business office. It adds a little comfort
and convenience to one of the most usotul inventions of
the age.

Lowell Candidate 109 and
Dr. W. P. Sims, "Dark

Yesterday.
In the most exciting school trustee

membership on the school board, to
succeed Charles McDonald, who, after
five years of service, recently an
nounced that he would not be a candi

sprung a surprise yesterday when he
entered the race for the trusteeship,
but polled but 27 yotes Rev. Fry re
ceived 382 votes, and Fred" Ritter, of
Lowell, 109. The Kev. Fry will prob
ably take his place as a member ot
the board when it is re-organized
next Saturday. The vote yesterday
was unusually heavy for a school elec
tion and is taken by local educators
as an indication that residents of the
Warren District are gradually realiz
ing that the public school system is a
subject worthy of their attention and j
time.

Fire of mysterious origin yesterday
evening created great gobs of excite
ment at the Copper Queen Annex,
and furnished many thrills for a big
crowd of fire-fans. The fire in the
Annex, which is occupied by twenty
cf Bisbee's handsomest bachelors,
was discovered by one of the debon
air young tenants at about six o'clock
An alarm was immediately turned in
and Barney Norton's tire-fighters re
sponded on the hot foot. As smoke
poured out on every side, the bravest
of the bachelors upheld the traditions
of the Annex by effecting many sen
sational rescues.
"Rastus" Hatley hurled seventeen
phonograph records to the ground
from a second story window and then
tarried a mattress down stairs and
deposited it carefully on the pave
ment. He then returned to his room
and rescued his other sliirt. Les Har
dy, hearing that his "home" was
in flames, rushed through the smoke
kicked open the door of his room and
battled Birainst asphyxiation to save
his $3.50 ukelele. He then tucked the
festive musical (?) instrument under
his arm and. likp Nero, played "On
the Beach at Wai-ki-ki," while the
firement poured water on the flames
(which were mostly smoke). The ef
fect was touching.
R. A. Dill, local finsncir, following
the house fire rule: "In case of fire
wring the towel, jump out of the win
dow pnd turn to the left." shattered
vM speed records in reaching the
rround, and then, discovering that he
had left several valuable stock certi
ficates in his room, rushed back and
almost chocked to death attempting
to climb in through the keyhole.
"Brother" Wolf, chancellor of the ex
chequer, upon discovering the build
ing afire, with a wild yell tore franti
cplly up the stairs and into his room,
but soon reappeared smiling and hap
py, having rescued and become once
more the custodian of Rastus' goat.
Julian G. Elliott, formerly of San
Dieco. refused to enter the burning
building until remembering a packet
of love-letters in his room. He then
"shinnied" up a fire hose, grasped
the documents in his hands and slid
down the hose to safety.''

Letter Addressed to "Village
Clerk" Arouses Indignation,
But No One Is Able To Tell
Exactly What Lowell Is. j
If you want to start a riot in
Lowell, just call that busy place j
a village.
A letter was received at the '
Lowell postotlice yesterday ad
dressed to "Village Clerk. Lowell,
Ariz." It eventually was deliver
ed to J. L.' Winters. The judge 1
looked at it and tossed it to 1
Constable Joe Hodges. Hodges j
looked at it and shoved it over to !
Deputy Sheriff Billy Brakefield,
and Brakefield opened it. found it
contained nothing but a jewelry
advertisement from a New York j
firm, and tossed it iuto the waste t
basket. And then the three otli- j
cials held an indignation and
booster meeting combined. The !
New York jewelers were de- 1
nOuneed for terming Lowell a vil- I
lage but. when it came to defining
Lowell, neither of the three men I
agreed with the others. Judge '
Winters claimed Lowell to De '
lively town: Hodges declared it j
was a growing city and Brakefield
boasted that it was the "metro-
polls of the southwest." '
Hoping to find out just what
Lowell really was. a Review repre
sentative decided to (Onsult othej
residents of Bisbee's sister com
munity, only to find out that each
had a different opinion. Judge
George Smith described, it as
some berg"; Chris Marcellus said
it was "the best habit I have ever
had"; Harry Sealey alleged it was
"a crackerjack good place, and
other citizens gave equally vary
ing definitions. But the old ques
tion: What is LOwell? has not yet
been answered.
One thing is certain, however,
it is not a village.

GUNPOWDER HID IN
MALTED MILK CANS
But Douglas Fairbanks Dis
Covers It and Foils the Vil
lain's Plot in Picture Play.
In uiiliziiiK the (-veiling business of
filibustering for the main idea of
"merican Arisi'jcracy." which plays
today at the Central theatre. Lowell,
the new Triangle-Fine Arts release,
Anita Loos has chosen a subject at
once interesting and timely
For months the shipment of arms to
Mexico against the embargo establish
ed by the government has been the
subject of countless newspaper arti
cles. Strange lo say. the theme has
not been utilized before to any e.
tent by scenar.'i writers, although all
of the elements of theatrical suspense
and exciting climax are in the sub
ject. Ammunition and guns have been
sent across the border in butter-tubs,
cases of cattle feed and bales of hay,
if we may believe the reports from
army headquarters along the Rio
Grande, but it remained for Miss Loos
to show the possibilities of packing
gunpowder and 'other high explosives
in malted milk cans.
As a matter of fact, it is just this
whimsical turn to the plot of "Ameri
can Aristocracy" that lifts it out of
the rut and adds a lattjih to the big
thrill that comes when Douglas Fair
banks' in the character of Sassius
Lee, the amateur entomologist, who
is also the hero of the st'jry, discovers
the perfidy of the traitorous malted
milk manufacturers and proceeds to
foil his plans.

t
A report made by Messrs. Horace J. Brown and Fred M. Miller on a visit
of inspection to sundry Arizonan mining districts has been issued by Mr. H.
L. Carnahan, the Commissioner of Corporations in this State, says the Mining
and Scientific Press. His deputies went to Arizona in order to collect in
formation concerning prospects that were being used as the basis of company
promotions of a doubtful kind. Such promotions, worked by means of cor
porations organised in another State, are able, under cover of the inter-state
regulations, to evade the Blue Sky law. This law, as our readers Itnow. is
one to control peddling of shares under promises as limitless as the blue
sky. Hence the popular name of the enactment. Similar laws have been
passed in 26 States and when they have been adopted all over the country
they will be even more effective than they are now., Michigan, Ohio, and
South Dakota passed Blue Sky laws recently and we note with pleasure that
they have been declared constitutional by the Supreme Court, which has
decided that the individual States are empowered to deal with the question
of fraudulent transactions within their own Jurisdiction. The matter is im
portant to those that wish to stimulate legitimate mining by rendering dim
cult the illegitimate phases of the business. Mr. Carnahan and his staff have
done effective work to this end and it is our pleasure to support them so
long as they show good judgment, as they have done.
Warning has been issued by the Commissioner of Corporations against
he store-Issues Dronmted by the high prices of metals. The big profits made.
by productive mines have sed to incite the cupidity or the public and by
aid of them a large number of wild-cats, or hopeless prospects have been
foisted upon the share-market. This State has been flooded with the so-called
literature of the bucket shops. It is well for the public to know that the
Commissioner's function is to protect them by issuing certificates authorizing
the sale in this State of reasonable stocks and by refusing his sanction to
the worthless ones. Our own observation leads us to believe that the Com
missioner is willing to give a mining venture the benefit of the doubt and
that he places his emborga only on those that are thoroughly worthless. Th3
intention is to encourage the organization of legitimate corporate ventures,
not to checks in any way the proper growth of sane prospecting or of reason
able speculation. Our people should realize this fact perhaps they do. In
any event as spokesman for our domestic mining activities we are glad to
bring the matter to the friendly consideration of our readers, asking ,them
to support this method of protecting the only kind of mining that is worth
while,

DIAMOND DRILLING
IS WONDERFUL WORK
This Method of Prospecting
Has Proven and Disproven
Famous Engineer's Esti
mates. Diamond drilling is largely respon
sible (or development of some of the
largest copper deposits beins: mined
today. It has in many eases proven
correct the keen judgement of- mine
managers and convinced their com
panies that a wonderful copper de
posit actually contained the valuable
ore that his technical knowledge, ex
perience and judgement caused him
to believe existed, and vice versa
where it proved that valuable depos
its of ore did not exist where surface
Indications were favorable.
Although resorted to for mauy pur
poses, the greatest field of operation
for daimond drilling is exploring min
eral lands, locating ore veins and ore
deposits. When conducted by special
ists and expert crews it is the most
economical and satisfactory method
of prospecting.
The drilling; and cutting is done by
a rotating, hollow drill hit or tube, in
which are usually set eight pieces of
carbon at its face, or end four carbons
slightly protruding from the inside of
the bit. and four slightly protruding
from the outside surface.
TheTarbon used is one of the hard
est of known .substances., being hard
er even than the "brilliant" or crys
talized diamond. It is found in one
or two small districts in Brazil and in
late years has advanced in value un
til now it is one of the pr incipal items
of cost in drilling operations. As the
carbon varies greatly in size and in
quality, it makes selection tf perfect
stones very difficult.
Diamond drilling with reference to
mining produces a core of- the forma
tion drilled which can be. assayed to
determined the nature of the ground.
Drillers explore the most remote dis
tricts, moving their 'unfits by primi
tive nWthods and as a result of their
exploration, thriving villages and Pit
ies and industrial plants grow up.

i Tuscumbia has a production ree.trd
'of approximately J iluu.iieMl worth of

I This ore was extracted in three tun

In those days of primitive and expen

seems almost needless to state that
only the higher grades of ore were

i That the ore ran exceptionally high

fact it was freighted by wagon, at
high cost. miles to Khrenburg on
the Ccdorado river and from there was
transported by vessel to the smelter
in San Francisco, and in some in

for a generous and valuable produc

the ore carrie's an exceptionally high

was some months ago when tungsten
sold as high as $S. per unit.

sible that the Jerome Verde may come
im'j its ore at any time. There? are
tl-'-e who beleve that thid has occur
red and rumors to that effect during
t he week caused another uplift ill the
price of the stock, which rose to $2.25
after having dropped to 1 1.V18 and
hun?; around that figure following tbe
seemingly well authenticated report of
entry to glance when they cur what
proved lJ be the Iron capping.
A. A. Next In Line.
(Verification of this week's rumors
has been imiMissible. beyond the fac t
that one interest which should be ex
ceptionally well informed as to the
actual conditions prevalent in the
mine placed an order for 5.01W shares
of the stock.
Arkansas & Arizona is next In line
in interest "j Jerome Verde. In both
of the.-e properties a great many min
ers are activtly interested as .-hare-holders
.a fact that has much to do
with the aboumiant street talk that is
constant with relation to not only
these properties but also the many
others in which there are large local
holdings. For niVire than a month,
Arkansas & Arizona has been carrying
showings of copper in the faces of
both the east and the west drifts on
the l''i40 level. There lias also been
persistence of the ore stringers along
the walls in conformity with the for
mation. In fact, there is everything at
A. v A. to warrant the expectation
jf entry to an ore bojy at any. time.
New Machinery.
At Jerome Victor they have the
most of their new machinery equip
ment installed and are. getting tile
1200 level cleared up in a manner that
will enable them to get going there
in earnest very soon on the final lap.
There is muc h confidenc e in this pro
perty. Likewise is there strong faith
in Dundee, which has recently been
shipping some ore to smelters from
bodies cut near tiie surface but w hich
have never been advanced as commer
cial in character. Dundee' has its
water conti'jl again and is in shape
to do a good deal of effective work
rapidly from no.v on. There is no
lack of confidence in the ultimate out
come of this property adjacent to Ex
tension and JefJine Verde. From Je
rome Portland it is learned that their
new compressor is now going excel
lently and that they have overcome
water difficulties in manner promising
permanency. It is gathered that the
management of this property is deter
mined upon it course of thorough de
velopment and that while; a mlni
tniilit be made now, n'j chances are
to be taken upon premature steDs.
What they are going after is a per
manent commercial ore body. and it
is believel that with the properties
maintained above Jerome Portland
will make good before the end of this
year. :
C. & A. Getting Busy.
Calumet & Arizona on Wednesday
turned over its powerful equipment,
the .l.'Jst complete ever installed in
the distric t for development purposes.
.Since a try out Wednesday afternoon,
when the work of installation', per
sonally supervised on the last end by
Master Mechanic McKee of the C.
A., the machinery has been sinking
the shaft under power from the 7"
foot depth to w hich the three , com
partments were put down by hand.
They will make rapid p:jgress now
through the sedimentary stuff and in
to the country below. A good year's
work is figured, however, to be ahead
fin this property before there will be
definite things coming into the lime
light. Like time will be required by
Calumet & Jerome, whic h has installed
a plant second only to that of C. & A.
In the developing division of the tlis
Irict. and by Verde Combination,
which has an extensive plant en route,
i part of the equipment now being in
course of haulage from Clarkdale to
the mine, an excellent road to which
has just been completed.
Green Monster will be the next to
get In neavy machinery equipment
which will be p'ut up on the site re-c-c-ntly
chosen by Dr. Walter Harvey
Weed for the main working shaft. It
is said that the considerable am'mnt
:f prospecting done by Green Monster,
nd about which there was some im
patience last year, has been clcmon--trated
to have been very wisely car
ried out and to have demonstrated
large value in pointing the way for
dvantageous location of the shaft,
lerome Daisy is nn'other which ranks
a ith these properties in interest ami
Tiroi-.iise. with the possibility that it
will heat them all to results in com
mercial ore bodies by reason of ex

which are developing in association
with the geological conditions on its

The Heart of An
Air Compressor
VALVES
Engineers a id Mechanics know
the vital importance of air valves
in an Air Con-pressor. They are
rightly termed the very heart of the
machine.
The perfect'bn of the SimplaU
air inlet and discharge valves used
on our N-80 Compressors, is the
result of long investigation and
hundreds of tests made under the
severest conditions, in which doz
ens of other deigns were tried cut.
Comparison -- made in these tests
proved the un nistakable sujxrior
ity of these Sit iplatc Flat Disc Ait
Valves. They differ from all oilier
multiple port valves of the flat di.-:
type in constri ction and efficiency.
This constri ction presents many
advantages which are summarized
in our Compressor Bulletin 34-M,
which we will send to you on request.

'wild-catting' a euphemism that is used
much as 'high-grading' is employed as

ent -
The Jackling-Hayden copper com
panies are meeting with unexpectedly
favorable results in the use of more
than 1 per cent of oil in their con
centration processes.
It will be recalled that under the
Supreme Court decision the use of any
fraction less than 1 per cent of oil
in the flotation was declared an in
fringement of the patent of the Min
erals Separation Co. ,
Immediately after this decision was
rendered, the copper companies above
referred to got busy in an effort to
devise a feasible process by which
more than 1 per cent of oil could be
economically used without sacrifice of
the copper recovery.
Officials of these companies now
state that surprising as it may appear.

RAY, March 31. Two sensational
strikes of high grade copper ore were
, made In the original workings Vf the
' Grand Pacini Copper company this
! week, and in a comparatively new tun
' nel a large deposit of very rich cop
per glance was uncovered,
j In sinking a shaft for the purpose
i of cutting a cross-fissure in the origi
Jnal Grand Pacific workings, a sevea
foot ledge of high grade copper 'ore,
running as high as seventy-two per
cent, was taKen at the breast of a
tunnel, driven late last year, dips to
the south ,
Tue tunnel had passed through an
almost perpendicular fissure before
reaching the second fault dipping to
the south, which was almost conclu
sive evidence of the existence of a
cross-fissure at depth, and tt pene
trate this cross-fissure at the contact
a shaft was sunk, and on Monday a
great body of high grade copper was
opened.
Almost simultaneously with thia
discovery the ledge dipping to the
south was encountered at the breast
of the lower or power h'ouse tunnel.
While assays have not been made
on the ledge matter from thede new
discoveries, a casual glance at the ore
-hows tbat it is very rich. Mining
men who Lave examined the mineral
assert that it will run better than
seventy per cent.
These new discoveries disclose the
fact that the grounds are literally cut
with veins and d'oss-fissures running
in almost every direction and all car
rying fabulously rich values.
The new lower tunnel will be driven
300 feet further into the mountain to
tap the perpendicular fissure which
was originally cut in tunnels one and
two and which gave copper returns
running as high as seventy-two per
. cent
With a little additional work ore
bodies of almost unbelievable size will
be blocked 'out, and the company will
pass into the. class of the permanent
.profitable shippers.
Several weeks ago an outcropping
of what appeared to be rich copper
glance was discovered on a claim far
removed from the original under
ground workings' of 'the rompp-ny. A
week 'or ten days ago Manager That
cher put a force of men to work on
this prospect A tunnel was driven in
on the surface lead and on Saturday
last at twenty feet, a great body of ex
ceedingly rich copper glance covered
the entire breast of the tunnel.
- This discovery, naturally, is con
sidered very important and as soon
cs equipment .can be provided, tut
putting will start Mining men who
have examined this ore claim that it
is one of the district's mofat sensa

MEXICAN GOLD COIN

BE MADE IN THE U,S,
New York Bankers Sign Con
tract With Ue Facto Gov
ernment r-or I he Supplying
or reso iold Coins. 3&u,
Uuu,uoU Autnorized.
NiiW YORK, March 31. Arrange
ments have been entered into oeiween
A. Iselin & Co. and representatives
of tne de tacto government ol Mex
ico whereby the former will undertake
to nave coined in this couuuy guiu
pesos wuich ul ue legal currency ior

ihat decree. Arrangements have Offen
made witn Phiiatieipuia mint to coin
this gold.
tor tue present the coinage will pro
ceed in limited amounts, as occasion
demands. The gold will be suppuea
through New York bankers as needed
icr payment of Mexicai custom a ci
ties by American exporters and by
others desiring A mane payments in
at cpun.rj'-
w ere it not for conditions in Mex
.co and the disturbed international
jiiuation, this incident might other
wise oiler great possibilities lor luai
country, it mi.ht constiiiie a slep
.ih.cii would ultimately result in pui.
..ns Mi'xicu upon a gold bais. In
fact, that deve?jpmc-iit is looked for
by some students ofMexican affairs.
Hopes had been entertained of bring
ing about this important move, but it
flas realized that existing economic
and political chaos in Mexico waj a
complete obstacle. Of course, mere
than 20,000,000 gold pesos would be re
quired lur such a purpose, but it was
oxpected that minting operations in
the Ions run would not be confined to
that amount.
Those who picture possibilities of i
putting Mexico on a gold basis at '
present found their ideas upon pre-;
vailing poEition 'jf silver in the world's
market. Silver today is at about it
highest price in SO year.-i, and tbii
would offer an excellent opportunity
lor the Mexican goveniinent to dt
;,ijnetizo silver. It is largely the
;,reut demand for silver by European I
i,ovi;mir.ents for coinage, since thP
var be?an that has tirivtn up the
urice. If .Mexico were in positf.m ta .
lal;e advantage of the opportunity, it;
rould virtually mean that Europe
pajs for putting that country on a'
gold basis. '
To carry tnii the pian tnere w ill have
to be a withdrawal of the silver peso in
circulation and its place substituteu
by the gold peso. This wVmld be ei
lected through the banks with co
operation of the Mexican government.
As silver was withdrawn from circu
lation and ahipped to the United ,
States, new coined gold would be sent
in payment The high market price
of the silver, as compared with its
monetary value in Mexico, would
represent the profit to the Mexican
government. This process could be
continued, so that, in time, and pro
vided the value of silver was main-
I tained, sufficient gold would be inject
ed into the Mexican currency to main
tain the higher standard.
But in the view of practical bankers
this is nothing more than a dream
just now. Mexico is not able to take
advantage of the silver situation. Any
one who knows Mexican conditions
will realize how impossible it would
be, under the present demoralization,
to secure co-operation, not only of the
banks, but of the people, .lust now
tne Mexican is hiding his money. Not
even the offer to change silver for
gold would induce him to disclose his
possessions. Carranza ran issue all
kinds of banking laws, but economic
laws will prevail.
NEW SECTION OF THE
INSPIRATION READY
Big Mill of Miami Operator
Will Be Added To During
April. Oxides By Flotation.
Two new sections of the Inspiration
Copper Co. mill, scheduled for use at:
the beginning of the year, will be:
equipped and ready for operation dur
ing April, according to management
estimates. This will raise the milling'
facilities from 18 to 20 units and in-;
crease capacity to between 18,000 and
19,000 tons of ore dally. The net re-
salt should be an increase in monthly
output of copper to about 13,000,000 1
pounds.
From its sulphite ores Inspiration!
has been securing an extraction ,
averaging 90 per cent.
Inspiration has been devoting much
time to th0 problem of handling its
oxidized ores. With an indirect use
of flotation the oxides may now be
handled in conjunction with the sul
phides and at much lower cost than
would otherwise be (he case.
Should this plan prove out as well
in commercial runs as in preliminary
tests, the total recovery from Inspira
tion ores will be improved by two to
three pounds of copper per ton of
ore, at little or no cost.
The annual report for 1916 covering
the first full year's operations will
shortly be distributed to shareholders.
Tie cost will be between 814 and 8 3 4
ceuts a pound. The savins feature in
this respect was the low mining cost
which the property management was
able to maintain during the year. It
cost more to sell copper on account of
the higher average price paid for the
metal, the commission being based on
sales values.
There has been no discussion offi
cially regarding dividends and cur
rent belief in well-informed quarters
prevails that the March declaration
will continue the existinff quarterly,
rate of $3 share.

would have ended hack in the summer
city by thel sea without a pause. As
It was, though well persuaded that
none spied'upon him, he came to his
destinationi by a most circuitous way,
doubling b:i'k on his path for the mat
ter of two miles before, while passing
loDely p$tch of woodland between

A twitch 'at the rein with a touch of
the spur fcwung his horse sharply
aside into' un - almost imperceptibly
marked path.
Winding tortuously through the for
est, the path presently debouched Into
a little glade from which, through n
thinning growth of trees, the shimmer
of sunlit viaters wasvisihle.
Here Captain Parr pulled up, dis
mounted, tethered his horse to a sai
ling, and went on afoot, striding raiv
idly toward the river, with a marked
manner of eager unxiety.
A turn in the path, rounding a thick
et, brought him abruptly face to
face with the object at once of
his happiness and all his cares.
He stopped short.

She looked round quickly with eyes
filled with inquiry. He nodded af
flxmatively. "Yes at the Casino. I was Just
about ready to start on my well-known
morning ride purely." he laughed, "In
the interests of my health, of course
when Huroki and Do Lima turned up 1
with the changeling."
"Kluiue !"
"Your volunteer substitute. So I
had to wait till they were otherwise
i occupied before I thought it wise to
j leave."
The two came out by the river's edge
in a little rock-bound cove with a
sandy floor. Iuland, more than half
hidden anions the trees, a modest
bungalow of unsurfaced logs was vis
ibleon Its verundn the ample person
of Anne. Patria's maid, placidly rock
ing and sewiug.
"Sit down." The girl
sank, feet
crossed beneath her, to the beach
"Tell me about this creature. Does
Klaiue really ?"
"Get away with It?" Parr laughed
again. "I should say she did. The
girl's a consummate actress and mimic.

The newspaper gave the first hint Mrs.
renn got of the affair.
Parr drw from his ocket a folded
paper, utid displayed to Patria one of
her own photographs, wretchedly re
produced iu half-tone, above a story
headlined somewhat in this fashion:
MISS PATRIA CHANNING

Wealthy Mexican Mine Owner.
With a little exclamation of exas
peration Patria reud the article
through, tiien uugrily crumpled the pa
per in her two liiYuds.
"And what came of it?" she asked.
"Oh, Mrs. Wreun protested, of
course insisted that 'Patria' retract
the announcement. And the row
Elaine had been spoiling for was on,
ending with her informing Mrs. Wrenn
that, if she disapproved so strongly,
Fanny. Adair would relieve her of re
sponsibility as 'Patria's' chaperon. So
Rodney and his mother are leaving."
"When?" ,
"Today. I presumed."
"Oh!" the girl declared in deepest
indignation, "this is Intolerable! I
can't stand it, 1 won't, another min
ute! Don, you roust let nre come out
of hiding and expose these importers!"
"Please, dear!" Donald begged.

t "That" was a snap of Parr's fiugers.

At the top ratria sought the friendly
shelter of the nearest shadows, then
I made a furtive way towards the house.
There were on the ground a dozen
I coigns of vantage known to Patria
whence spying would be practicable
and safe.
j In the nearest of these, close by the
' wide veranda, she resigned herself to
wait with far less cnmosure than her
motionless pose might have been taken,
to iudicate.
Even so, her patience was not se
verely taxed. Within a very few min
utes the light in one of the French
windows of the drawing-room was
twice eclipsed, as two people came
out and began slowly to pace the ver
anda, side by side El nine and the un
speakable Juan de Limn ! j
Moonlight flooded the face and tig-j
tire of the changeling with unearthly
brilliance. Patria could have cried out
in amaze, so extraordinary seemed the
vision she gazed upon.
Del.Uun wooed her after the manner
of his kind, ardently, crudely, with
patent intention. Inching closer, he es
sayed to kiss her.
But Elaine -would not suffer him.
"That's as far as you'll go!" she told
him. in the choice of won Is that came
most naturally to her. "I'm going t
marry you yes ! Marrying you is part
of my contract with Huroki I wish

TWO AND AN EXTRA.
Oddly enough, considering the anx
iety on 1 Mould Purr's behalf Inspired
by the threats of Edotiard. Patria slept
a deep and dreamless sleep, and wak
ened so lute that, by the time she had
taken her morning swim and dressed
and breakfasted, it was hard upon
uoon.
As the hour of their daily rendezvous
approached, she found it dil.licult to
contain her impatience, so impatient
was she to be reassured as to the
safety of her betrothed. Had Donald
bee:i five minutes late he would have
found her half-hysterical with dread.
He was, however, u trifle earlier than
usual.
None the less, she was beforehand
wilh him In the glade. And the relief
with which she saw him riding, sound
and while, to meet her, translated
itself into so violent a seizure of!
trembling that be could not have failed ;
to remark it. j
He did not even wait to tether his j
horse, but ran to her the Instant his j
feet touched the earth, seizing her I
hands and drawing her to him. j
"Patria ! what has hnpiicuedV j
"No nothing!" I
"Rut you were never like this !
You're quivering like a frightened
chili,! Something must be the mat
ter!" "Only only I have fretted so for
fear of some accident to you, dear. 1
am so glad to see you safe!"
His arms closed rmnd her; for a lit
tle her face was hidden iu his bosom.
Like a naughty child, she had feared
to own the truth about her overnight
adventure. Rut now the need of con
fession was strong uiMn lier. j
From the haven of her lover's arms i
she stared thoughtfully off into the for- !
est. I
( Something moved among the trees.
The head and shoulders of a man rose
j slowly from cover of n breast-high
j growth of underbrush. Patria looked
; straight ii.to the eyes of Kdouard,
bloodshot iu a mask of features that j
worked with rage. '
She drew a long breath. P.y no other j
hign did she betray the terror that as- j
sailed her. Kdouard was lifting into
sight a pistol, but bis anger and i!;e
condition of a nervous system wrecked
by prolonged tlebauches renderel fu
tile all his efforts to level the weapon
and take steady aim.
It was her Donald whom this crea
ture sought to kill. .
Gently disengaging, she looked up
steadily Into her lover's eyes.
"Don. dear," she said in a small j
voice, "do something to please me." '
"As If j-ou needed to usk !"
"Then, please please, Donald, my
Donald ! 1 want to be alone for u few
iiiinuies to think over something I have
to say to you. If you'll humor me und
go hq to the cottage, I'll follow you
very soon. Will you, dear?"
Parr stared. "I dou't uuderstand "
"You w ill, as soon as I can tell you. j
Rut now please do as I ask." j
"As you wish, my dear girl." 1
Profoundly perplexed, yet never for I
an instant suspecting the cause of this
siugular request. Donald si rode off'
briskly toward tin? shore.
Alone with the fear of death, Tatrta
steeled herself against the worst. I
The man IMouard broke through the '
covert in murderous haste. Patria I
threw herself in bis way without a ;
thoiigbt of hesitation. With an oath i
he struck down her imploring hands. I
Rut she would not be denied ; her arms
clipped li tin ; she exerted all her
strength to hob him.
"Let go. you j:id-:" he rasped
hoarsely. "Let me go! I promised to'

"No, IMouard. please no! Listen

j What followed was so blurred with

glings, that she retained no clear un

the explosion of the pistol. She saw
IMouard reel back, catching wildly at

demented girl.
It was many minutes before he succeed!-!
in gaining a disconnected ac
count of what had come of Patria's iu- '

recovered sufficiently to steal my horse,
or he had a confederate to do me that
service. Come aud see."
v The glade, when they again entered
it, was empty. Both Elaine's manager
.md Donald's cob bad vanished. There
remained only the echo of flying hoofs
' to testify that either hud been there.
"How he managed to trail me here
without my knowledge is what mysti
lies me." Parr complained when, some
lime later, the two sat together be
fore the little bungalow. "He could
hardly have done it unassisted. I see
Huroki's hand in this; the mnn is
shrewder than I credited him with be
ing anil that's saying a lot."
"And what can we do?"
"There's only oue thing to do now.
F.very hour's delay iow uieans added
danger for if Huroki doesn't know.it
already, he'll learn quickly euough now
from Kdouard that you still live ; and
lie won't waste much time before he
tries to rectify that fatal flaw- in his
calculations. We've simply got to beat
hita' to it."
"And how?"
"Tonight there's to be a bal masque
at the t'l.anning cottage. If we lie low
till nightfall 1 won't leave you again
we call take advantage of this
masquerade. I fancy, quite effectively."
Itapidly and clearly he outlined a
plan of operations.
"PuMicity we must ' avoid if possi
ble, both for your s;lke nr.'! f.'r the
' sake of the work you have yet to do as
executrix of the ('banning Defense
Fund," he concluded. "If we can qui
etly put the fear of God into the heart
of Klaine and seed her back to town,
and at the same time persuade Huroki
and Company it's far i.iore comfortable
to leave the couatry thaa stay to face
charges of criminal conspiracy I
t!ii:ik we may-call It a good day's work
and let it go at that, without hanker
ing for more s ctaculur revenge."
It was nearly eleven when Parr
brought the canoe to the beach where
on Patria hud landed the previous
night. The girl, agair. in bathing suit

At the top of th" cliff they paused
only to adjust (heir ios';s: there was
no need for further iliscusst in of plans
already definitely forn.ulated.
Viewed fti-ia a little distance, the
scne on the lawns was distractiagly

Prefaeed by scurrying footsteps In
the hallway, the door was opened.
Elaine flung herself excitedly Into the
room. Patria arose, put her back to
the door, turned the key. Elaine
swung sharply to confront her. '
"Who th deuce are you?" she de
manded. Silently Patria removed her mask.
With a low cry that was half a
groan, the dancing woman reeled back

to thn wall, her face ghastly bemn'.h
the rouge.
Iro,iping her Beach wrap, Patria un
covered her pistol.
"r.e good enough," she said coldly,
"to let me have that costume yon are
wearing. I give you this chance of es
cape, but warn you not to waste time.
The police will be here in ten min
utes!" Dumb In despair, Elaine began to
fumble with the fastenings of her at
tire. The door was tried ; from the hall
way the voice of the maid became
audible:
"Miss Channing! do you need me?"
"Not in the least." Patria replied.
"Go away aud don't come back for half
tn hour."
Patria moved across the room and
picked up the costume out of which
Haine had just stepped, a Spanish
dancer's dress.
But it was far front easy to manage
the change aud a pistol at one and tiie
Mime time. Ou sudden decision Patria
unlocked the d'wir.
"Iut that beach cloak over your un
dcrthings," she ordered Elaine, "and
go!"
Submissively, Elaine picked np the
cloak and went to the door. PatrU
crossed to a cheval glas on the far
side of the room, on the way putting
her plol on a little table in the re
cess of the window. A moment later,
while hooking up the dress before the
glass, she saw Elaine fling the door
open aud dart toward the table.
Patria moved, but Elaine had moved
tio quickly for her. Her hand closed
upon the pistol.
Simultaneously a man's hand was
thrust in between the window draper
ies, hclding a revolver. This last was
discharged with what, in that smuil
space, seemed deafening detonation.
Without as much as a si?h Elaine fell.
She was dead before she iay at rest.
Thoughtless of danger, ratria
reached the window in time to see a
man leave the foot of a ladder whos
topmost rung rested on the window
sill, aud scurry off In desperate haste.
As she tnrned back she heard sev
eral people hurrying down the corri
dor. talkiniT with more or less anima
tion. The suave accents of Baron Hu
roki were distinguishable.
At her feet the pisrol glistened
temptingly; the rays it reflected struck
fire from Patria's brain. Hastily sh
picked it up.

and checked in stupefaction, stitr
ing down at the body of the dancer.
"Shut that door," Patria brusquely
told De Lima.
"What does It mean?" Mrs. Adair
whimpered.
With a hint of contempt Fatriit
looked from face to face.
"Mean?" she said. "It means that
Patria Cliauntng is accounted for at
last. Somebody had to do it and you
men bungled every time you tried il.
Now I've done my part ; It remains for
you to cover this up. I'm yning back
to my guesn before they miss me."
She left the three btaring, dumb
founded, aghast.

tered Pnrr. drew him aside, told him
what she had done.
"But why? To what end?" be
stammered.
"As long as they think me Elaine,
ond therefore are sure that ratria i
dead 1 am inside their councils." she
explained. "I shall become Intimate
with all their schemes and disclose
to you all I tind out !"
In the dim gny twilight of dawn lb
body of Kdouard was found at the foot
f the cliffs. It was surmised that--blinded
by remorse- and drink in. the
baste of his flight, he, had tumbled
over the brink tt his d'ent.h:
