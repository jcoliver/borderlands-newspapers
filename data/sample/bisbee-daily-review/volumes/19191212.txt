ANARCHISTS TO GO
TO SOVIET RUSSIA
Supreme Court Dismisses Ha
beas Corpus Writs Obtain
ed By Agitators
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11 The su
preme court having refused to inter
fere with the government's plan to
deport Alexander Berkman because of
Anarchistic activities, immigration au
thorities tonight prepared to send the
radical leader to Soviet Russia. This
is to be done. Commissioner General
of Immigration Caminettl announced,
"in the very near future."
Simultaneously with its order in the
Berkman case, the court granted a
stay of one week in the carrying into
execution of the planned deportation
of Emma Goldman, Berkman's assist
ant in radicalism, so as to enable it
to examine the records and determine
whether she be permitted to appeal
from New York federal court decrees
dismissing habeas corpus proceedings
instituted to prevent her being sent
out of he United States. '
Both Berkman and Miss Goldman
are being held at Ellis island and un
der the court's order, the latter will
not be permitted to obtain bail pend
ing determination of the ouestion as
to whether she can appeal.
It was understood the court's action
in granting Miss Goldman a temporary
writ resulted from her contention that
although born in Russia she Js an
American citizen through marrfage.

SUGAR FAIL TLI

TIRED SENATE
Cummins Bill Assailed By
Both Parties But Quorum
Is Not Present.
LAFOLLETTE TALKS
THREE ENTIRE DAYS
Question as to Whether Wil
son Will Turn Over Roads
Is Unanswered.
WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. Hope of
enacting railroad legislation by Janu
ary 1, the date on which President
Wilson has announced the roads
would be turned back to private con
trol, virtually was abandoned today
by senate leaders.
Strong and unexpected opposition
developed during consideration of the
Cummins bill designed to meet con
ditions with the end of government
control and it was by a slim and nar
row margin that its advocates defeat
ed a motion to set it'asida and take
up the sugar control measure.
In view of the short time remain
ing before the Christmas recess and
the fact that the Cummins bill, if
passed, might be sent to conference
with the Esch bill recently passed by
the house. Republican and Democratic
senators predicted that it would not
be humanly possible to frame a law
by the end of the month, even if con
gress1 kept yteadily and continuously
at work. On an aye and nay vote
the bill was passed and Vice Presi
dent Marshall was ready to announce
the result when the obvious absence
of a quorum upset the whole proceed
ing and reopened discussion.
Wilson Is Silent
Senator Underwood frankly an
nounced that he did not know what
President Wilson intended to do. I
The principal attack on the bill was
made by Senator LaFollette, who al
ready had spoken two full days and
who has not yet approached the end
of his long address.
In Fighting Mood
In the long snarl whoch the senate
found itself while trying to decide
whether to continue with the railroad
bill or take up the suear bill, the
lack of interest in pending railroad
legislation was bitterly attacked from
both, sides of the chamber. Almost
an hour was lost today In quorum
calls which Senator Smoot, Republi
can Utah, denounced as inexcusable
with a vitally important question be
fore congress. But in the two hour
wrangle not on the sugar bill itself,
but on the question of -taking it up
Republicans and Democrats had on
their fighting clothes, with the discus
sion running. far afield.
There was a suggestion frpm a num
ber of senators after adjournment to
night, that it might be necessary to
defer the Christmas recess., It also
was suggested that jth senate endeavor
to obtain from the: president a state
ment as to his plans for the turning
back of the. roads, in view of his
silence - on this question since his
message to the extraordinary session
of congress last May.

legislative committee investigating
seditious activities here to produce
documents and papers received by
him from his government, or copies

Martens declined to answer ques

Russia and stated point blank that
he had sent all his confidential files
beyond 'the confines of New York
state, out of the jurisdiction of the
legislative committee. . They are still
in the United States, he added, anu
he admitted that he could produce
them at any time if he so desired.

man of the committee, told Martens
that he would be notified tomorrow
what action the committee would
take on his refusal to produce the pu
pers and to answer questions.
The "ambassador" read info a rec

"nothing to conceal" in his corres

sent it here. He testified that corres

referred to his own sobriety. He said:
"My purpose was not to criticize the
air service which in my opinion is
made up of choice young men who
are noted for their sobriety. Our fly

Peter Rabbit's Funeral
"White Hcftise, May 2S, 1904. '
DEAR KERMIT:
It was great fun, seeing yon and Ted,
and I enjoyed it to the full. 1
t. Ethel, Archie and Quentin have
gone o Mount Vernon today with the
Garfield boys. Ysterday poor Peter
Rabbit died and his'funeral was held
with proper stat. .archie, In his
overalls, dragged the wagon with the
little black coffin in which poor Peter
Rabbit lay. ' Mother walked behind as
chief mourner, she and Archie solemn
ly exchanging tributes to the worth
and good qualities of the departed.
Then he was buried with a TacsTa over
the little grave.
You remember how Harold went to
the circus and sang the great spheral
song of the circus? Well, yesterday
mother leaned out of her window and
heard Archie, swinging under a mag
nalia tree, singing away to himself,
"I'm going to Sagamore, to Sagamore,
to Sagamore. I'm going to Sagamore,
oh, to Sagamore!" It was his spheral
song of joy and thanksgiving.
The children's delight at going to
Sagamore next week has completely
swallowed up all regret at leaving
mother and me. Quentin is very cun
ning. He and Archie love to play
the hose into the sandbox and then,
with their high rubber boots on. to
get in and make fortifications. Now
and then they play it over each other.
Ethel is playing tennis quite a good
deal.
I think Yagenka is going to. come
out all right, and Blestein. too. I have
no hope for Wyoming or Renown.
Fortunately, Rusty is serving uar-well.

The little birds in the nest in the

We sent both to the zoo.
The other day while walking with
Mr. Pinchot and Mr. Garfield we
climbed into the Blagden deer park
and almost walked.6yer such a pretty
wee fawn, all snptted; it ran off like
a little race horse. :
It made great jumps and held its
white tail straight in the air.
White House, June 21, 1904.
DEAR QUENTYQUEE:
The other day when out riding what
Bhould I see in the road ahead of me
but a real B'rer -Terrapin and B'rer
Rabbit. They were sitting solemnly ',
beside one another and looked just as i
If th'ey had come out of a book; but as
my horse walked along B'rer Rabbit
went lippity lippity lippity off into
the bushes and B'rer. Terrapin drew in'
his head and legs till I passed.

DEAR TED:
Mother and I had a most lovely ride
the other day, way up beyond Sligo
Creek to what is called Northwest
Branch, at Burnt Mills, where is a
beautiful gorge, deep and narrow, with
great boulders and even cliffs. Except
ing Great Falls it is the most beauti
ful place around here. Mother scram
bled among the cliffs Inner riding
habit, very pretty and most Interest
ing. The' roads were good and some
o? the scenery really beautiful. We
were gone four hours, half an hour
being occupied with the. scrambling in
the gorge. ;. -
Saturday we went to the wedding
of Teddv Douglas and Helen. It was
a beautiful wedding in every way and
I am very fond of both of them. Sun
day we spent at Attorney General
Knox's at Valley Forge and most un
expectedly I had to deliver a little
address at the church in the afternoon
as they are tryinar to build a memorial
to Washington. Think of the fact that
in Washington's army that winter
among the junior officers were Alex
ander Hamilton, Monroe and Mar
shall a future president of the "Unit
ed States, the future chief justice who
was to do such a wonderful work for
our government, and the mon of most
our eovernment and the man of most
brilliant mind Hamilton whom
we have ever developed in this coun
try. (To Be Continued)

"It's No Wonder So Many People Are
Praising Tanlac,"
She Says
v "I have gained 27 pounds since tak
ing Tanlac and I havent' felt so well
in years," said Mrs. W. O. Berry of
1968 Telegraph avenue, Oakland, Cal.,
in telling of her remarkable recovery
since she has taken Tanlac.
"It was a.bout two years ago that
asthma first began to trouble me," she
continued. "At times I was bo weak 1
could hardly move, and I was so-ex-tremely
nervous that the slightest
kind of noise" would completely upset
me. I had very little appetite and my
kidneys troubled me so much that it
was almost impossible for me to get
a good night's rest, and from morning
till night I felt weak and draggy. '
"I read in the papers so much about
Tanlac and the good it was doing
other people that I decided to give it
a trial. . Before I had finished my third
bottle of medicine I had improved so
much that I was feeling like a differ
ent woman. I just kept on getting i
better and now I have, already gained
back much of 'Tnylost weight and feel
stronger than I have in two years and
am doing all my housework myself.
My asthma trouble has been overcome
completely, and I can eat anything I
want and never have a pain after
wards. The chronic cough has left me,
too, and my kidneys are in such good
shape that I sleep :eight hours every
night as sound as a cnild. I am gain
ing in weight and strength right along
and feeling as fine as I ever aia m my i
lite. No wonder so many people are
praising Tanlac, why, I'm so happy
over my recovery that I want you to
publish this statement of mine and
tell the people that 1 am fully convinc-:
ed Tandac has no equal as a medi- i
cine." - - ' (

BRING DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION
TO COAST
CALIFORNIA will make a strong bid for the 1920 Democratic con
vention, the place for which will be decided upon at a meeting
of -Ahe Democratic national committee in Washington on January
10. With the backing of Arizona and other western states, it will
not take much persuasion to get a political precedent by bringing
the convention to the Pacific coast. , ,
Every four years from time immemorial it has been customary
for the nominating conventions of the two great political larfles
to swelter in mid-summer heat in some big Eastern "center of popu
lation. No delegate to a national political convention is ever able to
dissociate his memories of that convention from a recollection of
climatic discomfort.
July is the traditional convention month. It is a month of swell-.
ering suffering in every large Eastern city. There is a small won-:
dering that the Democrats are turning their eyes this campaign to
the cool Pacific breezes. Either her San Francisco or Los Angeles
would make an ideal convention city next July. Mapy of the members
of the Democrat national committee from Eastern slates already
are favorably disposed toward holding the convention on the Pacific
Coast. It requires only a united effort on the part of California, Ari
zona and other western states to "put it over."
Aside from considerations of conifort, there is the added fac
tor that of late years the far west has beea coming into its own po
litiealy. It is only a JiUlo more than th:ec years ago that California
detjued a presidential election. That election showed California
swinging nto the Democratic column, and the holding of the Dem
ocratic nominating convention vhere next July would be a move to
ward keeping the state in that column.
San Francisco has shqwp in jts exposition of 1915 how jt can
entertain' on a lrge scale. Los Angeles is surrounded by pleasure
resorts, and blessed with a mild summer climate which woujd be a
welcome change to the delegates from Jhe heat of the East. The
Democratic party of Arizona would gain added strength through the
holding of the convention in the neighboring state. It behooves the
Arizona Democrats to line up solidly behind any movement to bring
the 1920 Democratic convention to the Pacific Coast.
SHAPES OF CRANE AND SMOQT!
THE Republican party sometimes called the Grand Old Party
has solemnly selected Chicago again for its national conven
tion. -
Chigaco, the Steam Roller City, the city of Murray Crane,
and Reed Smoot, and Bois Penrose the city where split asunder
the Republican party in the bandit convention of 1912, the city from
which was launched two successive Republican presidential defeats!
Apparently the Republicans are not superstitious. Chicago won
the race- for convention honors "hands down." The nearest compet
itor was St. Louis, which polled nine votes to Chicago's 44.
There is something alm6st uncanny about the way the Republi
cans cling to Chicago as a convention city a sort of ghostly re
i turning to haunt the kaene of disaster.
Chicago, the Old Guard City, will house the G. O. P. convention
on June 8, and the Old Guard still lives. Let us piously invoke the
political shades of Crane and Snioot that history may not repeat
itself.
BITING THE HAND THAT FEEDS
NOW that Emma Goldman is to be deported from the free land
she has defamed and reviled while it was affording her protec
tion and liberty, she has discovered that sending her back to
"white guard" Russia is equivalent to signing her death war
rant. She is pleading with the courts she has so often sought to be
little and vituperate to save the life she has spent in fighting the
principles of Americanism for which they stand.
In the same breath that he asks, for leniency for his clients, the
attorney for Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman admits that
they are anarchists. As anarchists they hae both, for years, carried
on ceaseless warfare against the American government have con
sistently bit the hand that was feedipg them. Now that this tolerant
government is letting the precious pair off with no more severe pen
alty than banishment from America's shores that they may harm
America no longer, the anarchists suddenly discover that their an
archy will cause them to be summarily put to death even in the be
nighted Russia, and are begging for the continued protection of the
generous victim of their ingratitude.
The present plight of Emma Goldman and Alexander Berkman
is one which the members ot the I. W. W., the Bolshevik and their
"sympathizers" would do well, to ponder over. They vituperate Uncle
Sam, according to their universal practice, only on suffrage of Uncle
Sam. And when his patience is finally exhausted, and their howls of
terrified anguish rend the air, they find too late that they have,
through base Ingratitude, lost their best friend.
TWO PICTURES
IT i said that the Apaches had five vords for murder, not one
for love.
A recent analysis of the soviet literature is said to show ten
words for destruction, only one for construction; six words for
communism, on)y one for patriotism.
Bolshevism, according to ljnguisjic analysis, yields many words
meaning pain, agony, iorment, fesr, awe, e;idnss, hunger, tears dis
tress, imprisonment, adversity, calamity, disaster, and confiscation.
Bolshevistic writings also yield many words meaping bereave
ment, widow, orphan, doom, death, grave, punishment.
Wc also find the following words abounding in soviet literature:
revolt, masses, classes. seize, destroy, burn, demolish, blow up and
finally: "In th word of destruction we must be merciless."
Americanism abounds in surh words as love, brotherhood, home,
country, protection, sympathy, pity, fellow-feeling, compassion, char
ity, friend, country, God. progress, assistance, hope.
Tho conditions portrayed by words arc as true to life as the nega
tive is to that upon which the camera was focused. Take your choic.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Dec. ll Settlement
of the coal strike infused a semblance
of strength in the stock market at the
outset of today's operations, but this
waa spetlily dissipated when foreign
exchange, particularly the British
rate, manifested more acute weakness.
There were no actual developments
to explain the further alarming depre
ciation of international exchange,
other than reports on the exchange
that the present session of congress
probably would opposet he authoriza
tion of foreign credits or loans.
The Mexican situation also assumed
more delicate aspects; rumors in con
nection with foreign ownea conces
sions in that country accounting
mainly for the general depression of
active petroleum issues.
The money market held consistent
ly to its recent rigid course. Stocks
registered their minimum quotations
in the later dealings, when rails, es-
Jpecially Canadian Pacific, developed
marked weakness. The general list,
notably motors, oil and steel issues.
soon joined in the reaction, the market
closing in weakness and disorder.
Sales. 935,000 shares.
All classes ofbonds . domestic and
foreign were variably lower in larger
and more diversified dealings. Total
saips. nar value, asrfereeated $27,650.-
000. Old United States bonds were un
changed on call. ,

COAL Oil HAND
FOR ONE MONTH
IN THE DISTRICT
Despite the ending of the coal
strike there has been considerable
apprehension in this district concern
ing the coal supply here.
Although coal consigned' to the
Warren District has in several re
cent cases been confiscated by the
government for industrial needs there
has been secured by local coal com
panies a limited supply of Dawson
coal which should last the commun
ity for a month. It is hoped that be
fore the present supply is exhausted
the district will be aliened more coal.
According to the Warren District
coal dealers there are many people
hero who alrePidy have sufficient
conl to last them during the winter.
Coal can be bought here now, one i
of the local companies having just
received three carloads of Dawson
coal.
In WaTen, according to the War
ren Company, everybody has a reas
onable supply of fuel on hand and
thrre a'e S(X tons of coal on liana
ready to be sold to the people in one
half ton orders. Three carloads of
coal consigned to the Warren Com
pany from Waldo. N. M., were con
fiscated by the government for the
jalroads. hut shortly after this in
terference A Single carload was per
mitted to go through to the company.
It was this belated supply that has
temporarily satisfied that district's
needs.

"Mail your Christmas parcels ear

this year and the slogan has a great
er pertinence at this time than it has
had during any previous similar per
i The curtailment of the railroad
service because of the national coal
shortage is greatly responsible for the
congestion which is already threaten
ing Uncle Sam's post office, accord
ing to Assistant Portmaster Pressly
of Bisbee.
The Christmas rush has been felt
here during the past two or three
weeks, in which time the mail traf
fic has increased 50 per cent. That
Uncle Sam's appeal to the people to
mail early is receiving response is
shown in the unprecedented malls.
The parcel post difficulty has been
increased by expressmen's strikes in
certain eastern cities. All packages
should be securely marked and wrap
ped, especially if the contents are
perishable. Return addresses should
be written on the packages.
Mail for overseas soldiers may be
sent this year without permit. Par
cels for abroad should be mailed to
day. The weight limit for overseas
parcels is seven pounds.
Three extra clerks will be employ
