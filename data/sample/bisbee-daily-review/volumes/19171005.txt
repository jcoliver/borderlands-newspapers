WASHINGTON. Oct. 4. Two Ger

allied vessels which she sark early
this year in the Sou'h Atlantic ocean.
In the long period from last arch,
when she was last heard from, the
raider probably sent down other craft
encountered in passing through the
Atlantic, around Cape Horn and across
the Pacific to the Society group of
French islands, of which Mopeha is
one.
Seeadler Stranded 4
The Seeadler, according to Captain
Smith's report, arrived at Mopeha on
July 31. Two days later she stranded
on the island and was abandoned as
a total loss, the master and crew, with
twenty-seven white and seventeen na
tive prisoners, makng shore in safety.
Life on Island
The Seeadler's prisoners, of whom
Captain Smith was or.e, were left on
the almost desolate island, but on
September 19 Smith and three others
of the prisoners departed in an open
beat and reached Tutuila ten
aaya
later. Smith reported the prisoners
badly in need of food and water.
The dispatch from the naval officer

jager, J. N. Gaines. Committees, work

be canvassing every one in the War-

Preparatory to the actual campaign I
which is about to be launched in every I
part of the county, Mr. Gaines yester-
day issued a proclamation regarding
me issue ana us mtrriis. it iunuo
Liberty loan appeal to the people
in the district of Cochise county.
The government has made an
other appeal to the people to help
in its war on autocracy to help
in hastening the day of peace. It
is particularly anxious that the
people of moderate means buy
many of the new Liberty bonds
now offered. . In order to interest
them it has pfferej a really in
viting investment There is an
interest of 4 per cent provided
and the security is gilt-edge. Many
of us have been economizing,
many of us are compelled to do
so, and many are each month
putting a little money into sav
ings accounts for which we are
drawing 4 per cent or less. A part
of these savings should be in
vested in Liberty bonds as a patri
otic duty, and at the same time
make a better investment than
we now have. We cannot lose,
but if we should, it is our duty to
help in keeping America safe for
our posterity in the future years.
We are all aware that our gov
ernment tried In every possible
way to keep out of war, holding
out almost to the point of national
dishonor before it would allow
itself to be forced into the con
flice. But, finally compelled to'
take up arms in defense of our
country's rights, to insure our
survjval as a democracy, the gov
ernment must have money to
prosecute the war.
The bonds offered by the gov
ernment to the people in the sec
ond Liberty loan w II be issued
in denominations of $50, $100 and
up, either registered or coupon.
The number of households in this
county purchasing a bond, even
of the small denominations, will
show the attitude of the people
toward the enemy. The patriotic
appeal of this loan is so dear
that it should not need any sap
porting argument. The govern
ment is not asking a special favor
of us. It is endeavoring to assist
each one of us to save the pennies
we would otherwise spend in
really unnecessary purchases. If
we can all ;et the fact clear in our
minds that we are helping our
selves by loaning to the govern
ment that is giving us protection
the small amount necessary to
purchase at least one of these
bonds, e should not hesitate to
show out attitude toward the en
emy by helping our government
and ourselv.s at the same time.
Cochise county is responding to
the call of the government by
sending the flower of her young
manhood into training camps to
prepare them to intelligently do
their duty at the front to protect
the homes they have left behind,
and make this country safe for
the mothers and children. Those
of us left at home should be will
ing to make any sacrifice to in
sure the health and comfort of
our boys who have become our
home protectors. Buy a Liberty
bond to help our boys and make
it possible for them to return to
us victorious heroes.

Is Entire
Success
The anticipated renewa of Field
Marshal Hais's big offensive in Flan
ders has begun and all their objectives
of the first day have been won and
held. As in the preseding attacks, the
latest one was timed to the minute.
The British forces, at a given signal
at daylight, swarmed from their
trenches over ground that bad been
harrowed by myriads of hel!s from
the great array of artillery, and all
along the front of more than eight
miles, from south of Tower Hamlets
to the north of Langemarck, they
made notable new gains of terrain, in
flicted heavy casualties on the Ger
mans, while themselves suffering
slight losses and took many prisoners,
large numbers of whom gladly sur
rendered in order to reach a haven
of safety from the maelstrom.
Attack With Vigor
The attack was delivered with all
the dash of previous offensives and
swiftly and surely the Britishers, not
: withstanding heavy counter-attacks at
I various Doints. took nositions thathad
been marked out for them, some of
them to a depth of more than a mile.

within the range of Haig's guns.
British were fruitless, however, as
likewise were their offorts in the re
gion of Poelcapelle, where the British
gained ground to the depth of about
two-thirds of a mile.
Artillery in South
There has been no cessation in the
extremely violent artillery duel be
tween the French and the Germans on
the west bank of the Meuse river in
the Verdun sector. The Germans have
made another infantry attack against
the French north of Hill 344 in this
region, but again were repulsed with
heavy casualties.
On Russ Front
Near Jacobstadt. which lies midway
between Riga and Dvinsk, on the
northern Russian front, a big battle
apparently is being prepared for. Here
Petrograd reports an intense artillery
duel in progress, which probably indi
cates that the Germans are seeking
to pave the way for an attempt to
cross the Dvina river. To the south
the Germans are again endeavoring to
fraternize with the Russians, inviting
them to come out of their trenches.
iThe Russians, however, are answering

BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, Oct. 4. The trial of
strength among the strongholds com
prising the Germans' crucially import
ant system of defenses along the Pas-schendoele-Gheluvelt
ridge was re
newed at dawn today, when the Brit
ish again surged forward over a wide
front to the east and north of Ypres.
Within a few hours great success had
already been recorded throughout the
zone involved.
At some places the British had pen
etrated to a depth of a mile and had
overrun the crest of the ridges which
the Germans had held so long. Hun
dreds of Germans were surrendering
at an early hour.
On North Wing.
On the northern wing the on-rushing
troops are battling forward within
a short distance of Poelcapelle; they
have a footing on the famous Graven
staff el ridge, which juts out from Pas
schendaele ridge to the west, and thy
have crushed their way through the
blood - drenched Zonnebeke - Brood
seinde ridge which forms an integral
part of the Passchendaele-Gheluvelt
chain.
Enemy Desperate.
Between the village of Broodseinde
on the north and Noordenhoek, a mi'-
to the south, at an early hour, they
were holding to the crest of the ridge
itself in the face of heavy counter at
tacks from the desperate enemy. Some
had penetrated well beyond the ham
let of Broodseinde, in which lie the
cross roads formed by the highways
between Zonnebeke and Moorslede
and Passchendaele and Becelaere.
where so many Germans have rerest-
I Iv civen their lives to awelt the toll
collected by the British artillery,
. Further south, Cameron, which ha
been the scene of so much hard fight
ing, has been left well in the lead.
Splendid Work.
Everywhere the British arms have '
done splendid work in the opening
hour of the movement, which is one of
the most pretentious attempts along
this front. The attack was launched
at 6 o'clock under heavy clouds and
mist. There bad been a slight drizzle
during the night, which caused some
anxiety to the British observers. But
the threatened heavier rain held off
and the prospects were little damaged.
Barrage Effective.
A tremendous barrage preceded the
i infantry Into the enemy country leav-
ing a trail of death and devastation
j behind it As this terrifying deluge
broke over the German lines groups
j of the enemy rushed forward in many
I places and raised their hands in token
; of surrender. Prisoners were comin3
in much more rapidly and in greater
numbers than in the last push.
Germans Lose Heavily.
There was an unusual feature in
the battle near Zonnebeke. Three
German divisions had been ordered to
re-take the line the British coptured
here Inst week. The attack was set
for 6 o'clock. The Germans were
caught in the British barrage as they
were preparing to rush forward and
lost grievously. Once before, in
l August, around Lens, the British and
Germans planned an attack at the
, same hour, and Canadian troops go-
ing over the top and advancing quick
ly, came upon masses of Germans
moving toward them in the thick haze,
and In a few minutes the Germau3
were making their last stand on the
parapet o ftheir trenches.
Left Wing Shelled.
The left wing of the British offen
sive today was heavily shelled by tha
Germans and Glencorse Wood and
Inverness Copse were put under an
intense fire. The British casualties
were reported as exceedingly lUht.
but the battle is still raging furiously
aud muc hsanguinary fighting seems
certain before its close.
Vital Section.
The Passchendae'e-Gheluvelt ridge
hich makes its sinuous way in a
northeasterly direction from the old
l pres salient, has been a vital defense

Interesting Sea Battle Staged
In the Adriatic One Italian
Vessel Wards Off Hoard of
Attackers.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4. Details of
the Italian cruiser Aquila's fight in
ike Adriatic with Austrian airplanes,
destroyers and cruisers, reaching here
from Rome, add to yesterday's account
a thrilling story of how the gallant
Italian ship, while fighting a fire in
her own hold, drove off the destroy
ers, was bombed by the hydro-aeroplanes
and single-banded engaged
three Austrian cruisers until help
came up, and then safely got to port
under her own steam.
Ordered to Attack
The Italian naval commanders, hav
ing learned a number of Austrian
ships were moving along the eastern
shore of the Adriatic, ordered a squad
of Italian destroyers to attack. This
squadron was preceded by the Italina
light cruiser Aquila. The Aquila put
on full speed and attacked the de
stroyers, seriously damaging both of
them. Just as it appeared the Aus
trian vessels would be obliged to suc
cumb, fire broke out aboard the
Aquila, which compelled the vessel to'
suspend the engagement while efforts
were made to subdue the flames.
Airplanes Attack
In the meantime the two Austrian
destroyers succeeded in escaping, find
ing refuge in the port of Durazzo, and
a large number of Austrian hydro
aerplanes were seen advancing. They
soon surrounded the Aquila and began
to drop tombs on her, causing some
damage and killing some of the crew.
Cruisers Next
The crew had succeeded in extin
guishing the fire aboard the Aquila
and attacked the aircraft vigorously,
forcing them to withdraw. The hydro
aeproplanes, however, disappeared
only to give place to three big Aus
trian cruisers, the Aida, the Navarre
and Aasparan. Without hesitation the
commander of the Aquila engaged all
three ships, meanwhile calling to his
assistance some Italian destroyers
cruising in the direction of Durazzo.
Very soon the destroyers came up,
supported by some English craft, of
the same type, and the three Aus
trian cruisers withdrew precipitately,
one of them, the Navarra, severely
damaged.

NEW YORK,' Oct '4. Fifth avenue,
which has echoed the tread of many
marching feet through tempests of
cheers since America shouldered arms,
paid homage today to the nations her
oines the nurses of the Red Cross.
Lines Of Relief.
It was the first great parade of the
American Red Cross and although the
20,000 marching women, young and
middle-aged, did not present a martial
appearance they marched amazingly
well. They appeared as representa
tives of the first, sec'jnd and third
lines of relief back of the battle line,
enlisted to serve and to succor the na
tion's fighting men. The hundreds of
thousands who had gathered to do
them honor paid a tribute of respect
all the more impressive because it was
less boisterous than that accorded the
regiments which hat e swung down the
avenue 'on their way to training
camps.
Many Uniforms.
It was a colorful procession which
stretched from Central Park to Wash
ington Square and took two hours to
pass the reviewing stand at the public
library. . Heading the line in their
trim travel uniforms of dark blue were
the nurses who have been mobilized
here under orders to sail for France.
Back of ;hem came another division in
gray crepe uniforms, made up of those
awaiting orders. Another detachment
wore rubber slickers for service in
rough weather. Others wore dark
blue ulsters and still others blue serge
dresses with military caps thrown
back to show the red flannel lining. In
fact( spectators sav every type of uni
form known to the healing branch of
;he service.
Hospitals Represented.
Back f the nurses who are to see
active service, marched delegations
from every hospital in the five bor
oughs of New York and then followed
the women who compose scores of
chapters of the Red Ci'jss and who
represent lines of relief activity. Ban
ners they carried appealed for re
cruits and support.
Ambulance Units.
Several base hospital uni:s were in 4
line with stretcher bearers and ambu
lances grim reminders of the work
that is to come. Many of the ambu
lances were driven by women, as were
motor emergency kitchens. One of
the motor service units represented
the District of Columbia. At the head
of this division marched Mrs. Jose
phine Daniels, wife of the secretary of
the navy
Many of the marchers carried ser
vice flags denoting tnat sons or hus
bands are in the service of their coun
try. As the.se flags passed the review
ing stand they were saluted by Sec
retary Daniels, Surgeon-General Gor
gas. Governor Edge of New.Jersey and
Major-General Hoyle, commander of
the department of the east, alnrbst as
punctiliously as were the Stars and
stripes when they went by at the head
of each division.
Marching at the Lead of the proces
sion were Henry P. Davidson, chair
man of the Red Cross war council, and
several of his aides.
Ample Supplies,
of Ammunition
Had in Germany
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 4. Fears that
Germany mimht possibly be unable to
continue fighting owing to lack of raw
materials have been answered by Ma
jor General Schueoh, the new minister
of munitions, who according to a dis
patch from eRrin Mays:
"Regarding the supply of raw mater
ials, particularly those required ror
guns and munitions we are not depend
ent solely on the stock in hand, which
however, would be insufficient. We
have to produce them and this produc
tion is proceeding satisfactorily."
General Schuwn admitted that pi'J
duc'ion was interrupted temporarily
last year because of transport difficul
ties. Although these seem to have
been overcome, the minister of muni
tions expects a probable recurrence
the coming winter.

vation and defied the British armies
to dislodge him. It has been a tre
mendously s;rong position, but the
last weeks of bitter fighting have
shown that It is not invulnerable. Bit
by bit the dogged British wrested the
lower reaches of the ridge from the
invaders. Each thrust brought them
nearer to the complete occupation of
tills gateway to the rolling plains of
Flanders.
British Want Mere.
Tower Hamlets, Inverness Copse,
Glenc'jrse Wood, Foiygon Wood and
numerous other positions which form
part of the Passchendaele-Gheluvelt
chain on its southern end have been
torn from the bitterly resisting enemy
and have been held in the face of de
termined counter attacks. Today the
British were agala reaching out for
more of these crucial points.
Series Of Ridges.
The Passchendaele-Gheluvelt eleva
tion really is Composed of a series of
ridges and hills. There is a Passchen
daele ridge proper," on which stands
the town of the same name. Below
this is Broodseinde ridge and still low
er down Gheluvelt. From the village
of Passchendaele it stretches in . a
southwesterly direction toward the old
salient, in long curves like the letter
S. At Iverness Copse it reaches its
nearest approach t'j the stricken city
of Ypres, which lies about four miles
to the west of it
In their successful thrusts recently
the British have either taken over por
tions of the ridge or pushed their way
forward to the lower slopes as far
norJi as Zonnebeke. which lies just
under the crest. Above Zounebeke
the ridge takes a turn to the northeast,
while the British line has gone well
back to the northwest. A portion of
the ridge between Zonnebeke and Pas
schaendele thrusts out toward the
west a long arm known as "Graven
staefel ridge," within which lie a hill
called Abraham Heights and the vil
lage of Gravenstaefel. All this area
has been sti'jngly held by Germans.
Ridge Now Bare.
In the days before the war the Passchendaele-Gheluvelt
ridge was cover
ed with prosperous farms and dotted
with picturesque bits of forest. Now
it lies bare and desolate, its earth
churned up by tens of thousands of
great shells which the British artillery
has been hurllug on it for weeks.
Hardly a yard of ground remains that
is not pitted with huge craters sur
rouned by piles jf earth. Here and
there a few bricks rear themselves to
show where a farmhouse or hamlet
has stood. Zonnebeke lies like a
emudge on the landscape.
Mass Of Ruins.
Thfre are no longer plaees along
this ridge. Passchendaele is a mass
of ruins. South of it were little com
munities, such as Nieuwemolen. Brood
seinde and Miolenaarelsth'Jek. All
has disappeared in tre deluge of
breaking steel.
An infantry advance over territory
of this description would be difficult
even if there was no enemy opposing.
Shell holes, many of which are filled
with water, form a serious obstacle
to a rapid advance, and anyone of
these excavations may be a nest for
fierman machine guns. Concrete pill
box and redoubts also appear in profu
sion throughout the lino and all these
divers defenses were reinforced with
bat bed wire.
Mud Is Enemy.
Mud is one of the greatest enemies
Willi which the British have to con
tend. Much of this area little streams
like the Retelbeek and the Polyon
beek have been bordered with verit
able marshes, in which the troops have
foundered desperately, knee-deep. Ev
en a few hours 'of rain turns larije sec
tors into fields of liquid mud and pools
which may Conceal shell hi;les of ma
chine guns. The artillery preparation
for this offensive had been among the
il ea .est if not the very greatest.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 4. Joseph E.
Ralph, director of the bureau of en
graving and printing which makes the
entire output of the government's pa
per currency and stamps, has resigned
to become president of the United
States Intaglio Company, a new bank

Mr. Ralph's salary in his new posi

a year paid him by the government He
has been in office since his appoint
ment during the Roosevelt administra
tion ten years ago and in that time
has seen the activities of his bureau
increase many fold. Besides Instal
ling impi'oved machinery, he has suc
ceeded in having the plant set up in a
new building regarded as a model for
industrial establishments.
It is understood that Frank E. Fer
guson, now assistant director, probably
will-be placed in charge of the bureau.
Mr. Ralph will remain until the ap
pointment is made.
"My resignation was given Mr. Mc
Adoo abou: a week ago," Mr. Ralph
said tonight. "It has nothing what
ever to do with the Investigation the
departmental committee is conducting
into the bureau's affairs, and has not
been accepted, so lar as I know. I
am anxious to hear about what action
has been taken and assume that Secre
tary McAdoo will make a statement
when he disposes of it."
The administration of the bureau
has been under investigation by a com
mittee headed by Assistant Secretary
Crosby for several months. The in
vestigation Originated from charges
made by Representative Jeanette Ran
kin of Montana, that Mr. Ralph was
overworking the women employes
there. A report made to Secretary Mc
Adoo some time ago has not been made

Allies Success
(Continued From Page One.)
the British front, some military oh-
: servers here have become convinced
that the Teutons wee covering a
great withdrawal rf their line. Other
officers, however, believe that the Ger
man high command has been hurling
j its men at t."ie enemy with the desire
j to check an advance, determined to
; hold its present lines at any cost un
1 til winter comes to their rescue.
One Opinion.
i Officers who think the German ac
tivity has covered a withdrawal to
I shorten and strengthen the lines ani
ease the strain on the army, expert
I that behind the) German divisions,
j through which General Httig's men
I were cutting their way today, will be
found in new positions, fully manned
, and strongly built against which the
. offensive will crash.
j Spirit Shattered. .
Some observers here believe the
i German army spirit generally is badly
, shattered. In support of this they
cite the continual peace cry in Ger
many; the expressions of prisoners
captured by the allies; the youth of
prisoners and the repeated failures
' of German attacks during the last few
weeks to make any Impressions on the
British and French fronts.
Allies' Morale Better.
In view of these developments, of
ficers believe a definite ascendancy
' has been established by the allies in
the morale of their armies. They re
gard that condition as forecasting
complete victory, although none are
willing to venture a prediction as to
when the German collapse may come.
Object of Attack.
There have been indications that
the ailied commanders have been in-1
tent on the destruction of the morale
of the German soldier as much as cni
; forcing their way forward In recent
' battles. The lavish expenditure of ar
1 tillery ammunition in which they have
engaged steadily for months may have
' been designed largely to shake the
nerves of the men among whom the
shells were falling day and night. The
results of today's drive, some officers
believe, may prove clearly that the
demonstrated preponderance of allied
, artillery, shown repeatedly to the men
i of both armies, has served not only
t o hearten the men of the British and
j i'ren-;h armies and instill into them
i 'onfidence in the final outcome f '
I 'he war. but has equally served to de-j
ress and make doubtful the rank and!
lie of the Germans.
Open Fighting Possible.
There are many observers, al"o.
who believe that with the Germans
orred hark out of the more nigg"d
country, fie fiahting may assume a I
more open character next spring. In
:he wide level lands into which the
battle lines arc being carried, there
is not strong 'natural positions. Sand
hags must replace ridges and concrete
and steel the hills that have made
possible the small forts which have
' held up many a charge heretofore.
Coupled with litis goes the- sugges
tion t.'iat real strategic operations
may become, possible next year for
the first time since the armies du&
in after the retreat from the Marne.j
Spring may see gigantic movements
set afoot to break the deadlock of:
trench warfare. Whether a combined j
land and sea assault on the exposed'
flank of the German line might bet
ncluded no officer would predict. !

English About to
Adopt Offensive
In Air Over Foes
(By Review ieaseu Wirei
LONDON, Oct. 4. The possibilities
and importance of air warfare have
been brought home to the British mili
tary and civilians by the campaign 'of
the last ten days as only experience
could bring them home. The result
is that virtually the whole press and
public opinion are now demanding that
the policy of passive defense for Eng
land and the watchword "composure",
which the government heretofore has
urged upon the peo; le, be dropped and
that a strong air offensive agains: Ger
many be waged immediately.
What the German air raids and the
threats "of attacks on England have ac
complished in a puiely military way is
known to the whole world and to none
better than the Germans. By the em
ployment of some fif:y machines and
at the most 200 men. including avia
tors and mechanics, the enemy has
forced England to detach several hun
dred valuable guns and several thous
and men.
The direct results of this campaign,
apart from these military factors, have
been the killing or wounding 'ot civ
ilians and the damaging of property
to a much smaller degree than the Ger
man people fondly believe. But there
is a bill cf indirect damages which can
not be taken lightly.
The normal life of the largest capi
tal in the world and of important coast
cities have been disturbed for ten
days and the industries and working
capacity of che people of L'ondon have
been seriously handicapped. v For an
average of more than two hours on six
nights the great majority of London
ers nave been forced to give up their
ordinary pursuits and take shelter.
All classes of night work have been
interferred with, while the day w'ork
has been curtailed so that clerks and
workmen might get to their homes be
fore the expected raids began. Ten-,
thousand persons who are not compel
led to remain in London have removed
to country resorts at a large aggregate
expense. Many poor families have
camped in the suburban parks and
commons.
What the pt'ople of London are ask
ing is why they should undergo these
a. tacks without the Germans having
to suffer similarly, why, it is that a few
British aviatorz and machines could i
not compel the German government to !
employ a large force for protection of
its cities and why should not the Ger
man population be threatened and har
rassed. Premier Lloyd-George's remarks to
night that the Germans would be paid
with compound interest seems to have
popular endorsement.

CHICAGO, Oct. 4. The New York
Giants, champions of the National

day in preparation for their coming
battles with the Chicago White Sox
for the world's championship. They
were opposed by the Chicago Cubs,
who won the game, 9 to 5. The Na

themselves after a few innings. Man
ager McGraw sent in his regular line
up, with the exception of his bat'ery
men, in the game at the start. Burns,

they had played a few innings. Her

showed much speed in scoting, on on:
occasion sliding under O'Farrell aftir
a sacrifice fly to short-center. The

Kauff touched him for a double each,
while Fletcher was credited with a
heme run when the ball rolled through
the fence. The drive would have been
for a double, anyway. The New York

Carter's delivery. Demaree went the
route for New York. Sallee. Perritt

prices went into esi;pt-.e today, but
iheir prices soared. The brokers paid
back thousands of dollars in deposits,
and it was learned that none of them
had more than a dozen of the three
game tickets for sale. The price of
box seats accordingly so'ared to $75,
and even the mere reserved seats,
made of bard wood slats and wor.a
at the factory maybe $3. were quoted
for three sittings of two or three
hours each at $35.
Scalpers Routed
The scarcity of scalper tickets was
attributed to the energy which Owner
Comiskey displayed in seeking to cir-
cumbent the practice. He held back
distribution until this morning; num
bered the tickets and indexed the
names of the purchasers; obtained
the aid of the state's attorney and
the chief of police, and promised full
publicity in the advertising columns
of the newspapers wherever he found
a purchaser had transferred his ticket
to a broker. The best the latter could
promise was that they would have
plenty of pasteboards for the third
Chicago game, on the theory that
many ticket holders, having seen two
games, would be ready to dispose of
their third tickets. But unless the
lnexpeeted occurs between now and j
Sfturt'tiy the scalpers will have been
vanished.
Lines Form Early
Tre lines at four ticket wickets at
t:e ball park began torming at 7
Vclock this morning, and the proces
s'on continuel until all the 15,000 re-s.-rvod
seat tickets had been given
rut. In the matter of betting, the
!ra!s talked loudly of C to 5 on the
Comiskey team, and the New York
adherents talked the same odds as to
their men, but what actual betting
could be located was at even money.
j There were many freak bets, involv
ing small sums, ranging from 10 to 1
that neither club would take four
straight to 2 to 1 that Collins would
outhit Herzog. While the crowd was
clamoring for tickets outside the
White Sox park, the American league
champions put in several hours of
practice. The diamond was a bit sog
gy, due to recent heavy rains, and it
was covered tonight so as to be in
shape for practice tomorrow.
Final Warnings
"Kid" Gleason. the coach, was in
charge of practice. I-ater Manager
Rowland addressed the players in the
club house. There will be a meeting
of the National baseball commission
tomorrow, at which time ground rules
and other playing conditions will bo
explained to the four umpires, the
scorers and Managers McGraw and
Rowland. There also will be a meet
ing of the Baseball Writers Associa
tion of America in regard to the de
tails of the series.
BASEBALL IN OUR

A football game and a baseball game
are on tap for Sunday, the former
starting at 1 p. m. and the latter at
2:30.
The gridiron contest will be be
tween the C. & A. eleven and the sol
diers from the First Arizona. Man
ager Gallagher of the local organiza

the world's championship for his team
and the match will give district en
thusiasts an opportunity to see wheth
er or not they cortie up to publicity
rerorts.
The baseball game will carry with
victory the local championship title,

Friday Morning, October 5, 1917.
A subscriber writes in to suggest that the title, "soap
box" orators be changed to "dopebox" orators. The
amendment is accepted.
Now that government control over coal prices has
been made complete will there be any way In which
, the coal operators can be made to produce coal and
place it upon the market? Will there be any way to make
striking coal miners go back to work? The consumer is
most pleased with the government's price; the only
thing he asks for now is the coal.
A New York authority expects, now that prices of
m.iny of the standard commodities have been fixed, a
brisk revival in business generally over the country.
He declares that while prices will curtail the earnings
of many of the great industries, yet there Is still leeway
for profit. Wages generally are higher than ever before,
and the argicultural outlook is good, if not excellent.
This should be a great fall for business the country
over and in every line of commercial and industrial activity.
In the midst of the stirring tales of heroism in connec
tion with the great offensive now on in Flanders, comes
a story from a correspondent that Is like a wild rose
blooming in the No Man's Land of the slain. An Iris!
lad who had won the meaal for bravery in the bitter bat
tle for Iverness copse, was dying in a field hospital. In
his delirium he sang snatches of the famous "Tipperary"
marching song and called to the "Red Cross lady" to hold
his hand and lead him chat "long way to Tipperary to the
sweetest girl I know." Only the Red Cross nurses know
the aftermath of suffering and sorrow and .splendid
bravery that follows every battle. Red Cross nurses
will tell stories of the Great War that will live longer
than most of those told by commander, councillor and
correspondent on the fighting line.
"Your wife is doubtless proud of you,' said a lady to
a famous English commander many years ago. "Say
rather I of her," responded the soldier quickly. "It is
easy to do your devoir in the thick of battle with the
eyes of all men upon you, but the women play the harder
part, waiting with intense anxiety at home." The bravest
are the tenderest, and in the vast armies of England.
France and America that are to be unleashed against
the Hun next spring, few hearts but that will be moved
more deeply for loved ones than for the cannon's roar,
and few eyes will be dry when the vision of some dear
one appears amidst the smoke. The fields of France are
glorious, but the American soldier over there will be
thinking most of the time of the fields of home and the
old garden gate with IU dim shadows that eould not
hide the light in the eyes of a maid. And these lads
with the wet eyes and the warm hearts will fight harder
than the reckless wanderers who have no loved ones
waiting and hoping and fearing for news of the battle.
A Bisbee man thus sagely delivered himself upon the
street yesterday morning regarding the new war taxes:
"They have placed a tax of a fourth of a cent on this
thing and a half a rent on that, and maybe a full cent
or two cents, on this other thing. Well, that's alright
No good American will object to paying his war tax. But
when a man goes into a Btore to buy that article that
has been taxed a quarter of a cent, he will find it selling
for five cents more on the hoof and in the box and paper
package. War and taxe3 raise the price of a few cents
a pound on leather and we pay several cents more for
every ounce we buy in a pair of shoes. They raise the
price three cents a yard on linen and we pay five cents
extra per foot for a linen collar. They place a tax of a
few cents on a box of cigars or a case of cigarettes and
we pay a few rents more per single cigar and single
cigarette. THAT'S what makes nie tired and sore; not
the war tax itself.". And at that, the Bisbee man is ten
times right, and no statesman from the City of Washing
ton dewn to Naro on the border can gainBay it. Boy,
page Mr. Hoover.
WHERE IS THE GERMAN FLEET?
(From the Scientific American).
The complete immobility of the German fleet becomes
the more amazing when we contemplate the stupendous
results which would follow another German victory (for
the sake of argument the writer is regarding the Jutland
battle as a German victory), for in this second attempt,
after completing the. disruption of the British grand. fleet,
the German commanded-in-chief would be in a position to
lead his victorious squadrons to the English Channel; cut
through and break up the vast system of ferriage be
tween England and France; immobilize that part of the
British army which is within the British Islands; and
absolutely stop the flow of supplies to the army in France.
Thus, at a single stroke, would her navy neutralize the
whole military and economic effort of the British Em
pire; for, with the main artery between England and ber
army cnt in twain, the British troops in France would
quickly and literally bleed to death. Nor would the
fruits of lawful German victory upon the high seas stop
there; for, moving out Into the Atlantic, she would be
able in twenty-four hours to bring about, lawfully, that
Immobilization of the lnited States, which her sub
marines have been unlawfully and hopelessly attempting
to achieve during the past six months.
Here is a prize of war, the like of which never pre
sented itself In all the long history of naval warfare.
What Germany's hard fighting armies have failed utterly
to accomplish In three years of effort, her fleet, swing
ing idly so long at its moorings in Kiel Harbor, could
have accomplished in any twenty-four day during the
fifteen months that it has chosen to remain in its present
condition of inglorious obscurity.
The portals of the highways of the seven seas would
be flung wide, and the German ships would once mora
be free to fetch and carry to and from all the corners
of the earth. Overwhelming victory for her armies; food
for her people; trade and commerce for her idle markets
and her ships now rusting in silent harbors. Surely these
are worth the effort of another "brilliant victory."
Again we ask, why this silence on the part of a vic
torious fleet, when one more such decisive sortie and
"steel hard" blow from the "mailed fist" would win ev
erything in the way of woyld dominion of which the wild
est enthusiast at Berlin ever dreamed.
LETS HAVE THE FACTS.
(Kansas City Star).
Congress will make a mistake if it diverts investigation
from Mr. Heflin's charges to Mr. Heflin himself. There
may be honest but misguided men who are helping the
German cause from the Congress of the United States.
There may be. Mut in view of the revelations of German
expenditures in this country such men cannot object
when there comes a demand that their conduct be investi
gated. Certainly there are only a few members of Congress
whose conduct comes under suspicion. But no feeling
of clannishness on the part of congressmen ought to pre
vent a full inquiry.
There have been congressmen who have gone wrong
in the past. It isn't impossible. The country wants to
know. It won't be satisfied unless the matter is thorough
ly investigated. And no suspected senator or represent
tive ought to be content ith anything short of the fullest
inquiry.
SHAM.
(Los Angeles Record).
While official Germany, in discussing Germany's re
ply to the pope's peace proposal, protests "approval of
the ideas of right before might," this same official Ger
many is practising the enforced use of Belgian boys of
fourteen years and over in the manufacture of war mater
ials to be used against their own loved and wronged peo
ple. This is not only contrary to accepted ideas of right,
but contrary to all civilized usage.
Such protestations of the approval of humane motives
and purposes with intent to trap their enemies into a
peace compact are first of all hypocritical, false and
mendacious. When did official Germany become the ad
vocate of the ideas of "right before might?" And when
did the German people protest against the cruel policy
that "might makes right?"
Again have the English struck the badly battered Ger
man line in Flanders. That is the terrible thing about
the Britisher in war; he never quits. He goes on as sub
limely and irresistably as fate striking blow after blow
with ever increasing force. He never lets go of a posi
tion and he never stops when he sets out to take one.
The salient beyond Ypres was dangerously deep before
the success of last week. Yesterday's gains threaten
the safety of the entire German front from Lens to the
sea. That the Germans realize the danger of their pres
ent position is witnessed by the most stupendous and
costly attacks of the entire war. l"p to within a f;-.v
hours of the last British drive the Germans were stiil
hurling masses of troops into the shambles to be rut to
pieces by an artillery fire twenty times the volume and
intensity of their own. The Flanders offensive is almost
an exact repetition of that on the So mine last summer.
The rains saved the Germans In October when the
British were crushing them just as they are doing now.
But today the bright sun shines pitilessly upon the Hun
nish hosts while the British guns cut them to pieces and
the British troops penetrate deeper and deeper Into ths
vital spots of their reeling lines. Unless early reports
last night of the last drive were exaggerated, a German
retirement upon a considerable scale may be looked fot
in France aud Belgium before the first of next year.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
HOMESICK
There is no sickness more scvera
than that a fellow knows when far
away from comrades desr, from good
old friends and foes. A man may
have the croup or mumps, the jaun
dice or the gout, and never know the
doleful dumps, if he's a nervy scout.
But courage will not brace him up,
when, far removed from home, he
yearns for book and chair and pup.
and Tor his fine-tooth comb. I used
to scrap with David Dose, my neigh
bor, every day. and thought that I'd
enjoy repose when I had gone away.
I built me then a little crib, among
the mountains bare, and took, my
tucker and my bib, and spent the
summer there. And bow I longed net
person knows, while I lived in that
shack, to throw some bricks at Mr.
Dose, and see him throw them back.
Man longs for old familiar things
when he abroad may roam; no new
surrounding ever brings the joy he
feels at home. Some neighbors envy
me my cot beside a snow-capped hill,
where there are never flies to swat,
and heat waves do not kill. But when
I'm there I huddle up before the
glowing fire, and long to see my cat
and pup, my book shelves and my
lyre.
"UNLOAD THEM CARS."
The shades of night were falling fast
As thru an all-pine village passed
A youth who bore, 'mid snow and heis,
A banner with the strange device,
"Unload Them Cars."
His brow was sad; his face beneath
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath,
And like a silver clarion rung
The same remark he always sprung,
"Unload Them Cars."
in happy homes he saw the light
Of household fires gleam warm and
bright;
Above the spectral lumber sl.'jne
And from his lips escaped the moan.
"Unload Them Cars."
"The overtime," the old man said,
"Will just increase your overhead,"
The youth replied, "What if it does?
if I want shipments, then I must
Unload Them Cars."
"O stay", the maiden said, "and rest
Thy weary head up this breast,"
There was temptation for a guy.
But still he answered, "Wait till I
Unload Them Cars."
A traveler, selling sash and doors.
Or 6x8's and 2x4's,
There found him at the close of day,
Still gasping as he passed away,
"Unload Them Cars."
And from the sky, serene and far,
A voice fell like a failing star.
"Come get Vur crown and others, too
Will get their crown if they, like you.
Unload Them Cars."
American Lumberman.
MRS, MAUDE DAVIS
GAINED FOURTEEN
POUNDSJN TANLAC
"It's The First Winter in
Twenty Years I haven't
Had to Spend Half My
Time in Bed," She Says.
"I actually weih more .han I ever
did in my :ife; I feel bettir than I re
member ever feeling, and my friends
say they have never aeon me looking
as well as I do now." Th'.a remark
able statement was made a few days
ago by Mrs. Maude Davis. 2704 Hick
ory street. Dallas, Tex., while relating
her experience with Tanlac. Mrs. Da
vis is the wife of W. J. Davis, the
well-known special officer, and their
many friends will be glad to learn of
her complete restoration to health.
"I don't know bow long," continued
Mrs. Davis, "I have been afflicted with
catarrh of the stomach and head, but
the trouble became acute twenty years
ago, and I just can't desc ribe the suf
fering I have endured since that time
until I got relief by taking Tanlac.
My food would not digset, my stom
ach was all bloated up with gas. and
my hea-t would flutter so at times I
would almost faint. I would spit up
frothy looking, stringy phlegm, had ft

Lelcvier's Version
The Mexican consul at Douglas,
when interviewed, put the figure of
arrivals at 170. These men, he said,
had marched overland from Columbus
to Colonia Morelos in twelve days.
From that place they wired the So
nora state government asking for help
and protection. The government re
sponded by transporting them in.

large majority awaited state action.

Announcement was made yesterday
by W. H. Brophy, general manager of
the Phelps Dodge Mercantile com
pany, who goes to France Sunday on
leave of absence to engage in Red
Cross work for the government, that
V. A. Meyer will be acting manager
of the Phelps Dodge stores during his
absence. Mr. Meyer was formerly
manager of the Phelps Dodge store at
Nacozari 'in Old Mexico. He resigned
some time ago and went to New York,
returning to the Southwest only re
cently. Since Mr. Brophy is only on leave
of absence, the advent of Mr. Meyer
as acting manager will not affect the
present organization of the mercan
tile company in any way. Many re
ports and rumors regarding changes
in the company have been in circula
tion, but there was no foundation or
authority for any of them. The plan
to have Mr. Meyer step into the breach
and thus avoid any shifts or changes
in the present fine organization that
would be only temporary has been
agreed upon for some time, but was
not announced officially until yester
day. Mr. Meyer is regarded as a snlenlid
bubiness man and h's record with the
6tore at Nacozari won for him the con
fidence of the organization, both up

NEW YORK, Oct 4 The market
was again lower, liquidation was con
ducted on a rather broad scale, and
In addition there was heavy selling
by the bear contingent. The same
factors which have been discussed so
much of late were operative, and noth
ing of a kind occurred to increase
the initiative of the constructive ele
ment. Banking support is lacking, and the
question of values is not a factor in
the equation at present. It appears
very much as If the fresh outburst of
Iinuidation will have to run Its course
before much in the way of betterment
will be experienced.

has been used in that capacity all
season by Manager Rowland, will
always be ready to step in and save
the day if any of the Sox twirlers
