highway work has been stopped in
Cochise, all government supplies anu

has been wiped off the may as. far as
state assistance is concerned.
All of which is the answer of tne
state highway department tp the. re

visors to paddle their own- canoe in
the matter of roads, with Robert
presumably at the stern. '
The answer is made in the form of
a telegram sent yesterday to I. .
Frazier. division engineer at No
gales and A1 Jenkins, highway en
gineer at Tombstone. It reads as
follows:
Arrange to stop all work In
Cochise county by August 31. In

ment. Notify all maintenance
men impossible to longer keep
them in service. Move complete

which he argued that better worn

No Lack of Water
Water holes are reported more fre
quently since the expedition has
reached the present part of the zone
of operations. It is believed possible
to obtain forage now and some beef.
The distance is getting too great for
pack mules to negotiate.
Reports received from Cosme Ben
goecza, Mexican consul at Presidio,
Texas, stated that General Antonio
Pruneda with a cavalry column which
left Ojinaga, after the American
troops crossed, was marching toward
Coyame.
The columns have been at Cucillo
Parad for three days. Coyame is
five miles from the Conchos river, 75
miles from the border. It is reported
that Carranza troops are stationed in
that vicinity.
STILL ON HOT TRAIL
Reports from the field in Mexico
early today indicated the bandits were
in the mountains and that the trail
had ceased to be hot.
Later Colonel Langhorne announc
ed: "Progress continues to be made
in pursuit of the bandits and we still
are on their trail."
This was regarded as assurance,
that the expedition waa . considered
still to be pursuing a hot trail.
FIFTH NIGHT IN CAMP
Camping tonight on a Mexican
trail far in the interior of Mexico,
American troops of the punitive expe
dition are spending their fifth night
across the border. While their loca
tion was unrevealed for military rea
sons, it is known, the expedition is
marching west of the Conchos river
with a mountain range of one side
and two ranges, one above another on
the left.
' The Conchos flows toward San

left of the trail the American troops
were following when a temporary

had been great dissatisfaction, he
said, concerning the methods of the
Btate highway department and h
thought the system should be
chranged to comply with the law.
Maddock explained that it had ai
ways been the aim of his department
to work in harmonious co-operation
with' the various boards, of supervi
sors, and cited Roberts"; own county
in proof of his contention. Chadwick,
a general foreman appointed undeh
the Hunt administration was syll on
the job, and the maintenance men
were the same who have been hand
ling this work for the past five or six
years, he said. Maddock told , Rod
erts, too, that he considered Jenkins
one of the best engineers that had
ever been placed on the force, ana
that this was proven by the fact that
his roads had stood severe tests un
der reecnt storm conditions. , 1
But Roberts was obdurate. He
maintained that the supervisors had
reached a very definite decision ru
the matter and led the engineer to
believe that their say, like the laws
of the Medes and Persians, was not
to be trifled with. It would have to
stick.
And so Maddock sent the wire
which will stop all work on the state
highway through Tombstone, win
halt all work on the Vail-Benson
route and divert all supplies ana
equipment into Pima county for the
purpose of improving the southern
route between Vail and Empire.
Just what Roberts or the other
members of the Cochise county board
of supervisors hoped to accompllsn
by their refusal to longer co-operate
with the state highway department
remains a mystery, unless it can be
explained by the fact that they de

U.S. TROOPS ON
Raiders j)f American Ranch
Go Free When Colonel Erwin
Is Told Trjey Have Joo Big
AStart On U. S. Horsemen
EL PASO, Texas, Aug. 23. The
pursuit by the Seventh cavalry
troops of Mexican cattle thieves, who
raided a ranch on the American side
of the line late yesterday afternoon
driving stolen stock into Mexico, was
ordered abandoned late today by
Brigadier General James B. Erwin,
district commander, following the re
ceipt of a report from Col. Francis W.
Glover, chief-of-staff, who was ordei
ed to Fabens early today, that the
chase was useless. .
The bandits had a start of twelve
hours on the American troops and
their trail was lost by the Americans
near the border.
"The mission for which the troops
were ordered into Mexico could not be
accomplished," General Erwin said
late today, in announcing the with
drawal of the soldiers. "There was
no chance to recover the stock and
punish the thieves because of the
time that had elapsed since the raidj
took place, so I have ordered the
troops to return to the American side
of the line.
"They probably will reach their
stations tonight."
Troops R and G of the Seventh cav
alry made up the column that crossed
the border this morning under orders
from General Erwin, following an in
vestigation of. the raid yesterday.
The detachment was in command
of Major Adolphus Roc, who is in
command othe El Paso district for
the border patrol. Troop E was
commanded by Captain Lathan Col
lins; and Lieut. Gay commanded
Troop G. ,
The former troops crossed the line
at Fort Sam Creek, fifty miles south
east of El Paso on the Southern Pa
cific railroad, and the latter at Fa
bens, thirty-two miles from here in
the same direction. Fabens is op
posite the country in which Francisco
Villa, Felipe Angeles and Martin

which was sent to disperse them.

SHANTUNG BACK

Committee Strikes Jap Title
To Chinese (province From
The Treaty; Ask President to
Furnish Some More Light
WASHINGTON, ; Aug. 23. After
voting to amend the peace treaty by
striking out Japan s title to the Ger
man rights in Shantung, the Senate
foreign relations committee notified
President Wilson today that it could
not intelligently proceed with its
work on amendments until he furn
ished additional information.
The action on the Shantung provis
ion was taken in short order, Chair
man Lodge proposing the amendment
and the committee adopting it virtual
ly without debate. "The vote was nine
to eight, with all the Democrat mem
bers and Senator McCumber, Republi
can, North Dakota, voting in the neg
ative. Then the point 6f inadequate infor
mation was raised by Republican
members. Chairman Lodge declaring
there were in the President's hands
important documents which were ab
solutely essential to the determination
of question involved in the, commit
tee's work. During its entire consid
eration of the treaty, the chairman
said, the committee had been ham
pered by lack of information that
should have been given it weeks ago.
Democratic members are under
stood to have expressed general op
position to any .interruption of the
committee's plan for prompt action,
but finally on motion of Senator Wil
liams, Democrat, Mississippi, and
without a record vote, the chairman
was instructed to ask the President
for the treaty with Poland signed on
June 28, two agreements regarding
the Rhine section to which the United
States was a party, and such informa
tion as may be available about the
treaties, now under negotiation with
Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria and Tur
key. In amending the Shantung provis
ion the committee took the most di
rect, methods. Chairman Lodge
simply moved to strike out the word
"Japan" wherever it-occured in the
section relating to the German-Shantung
rights, and to insert instead the
word "China."
The effect would be to restore to
China all the German . holdings in
Kiao Chow and vicinity.
With the committee's action the
fight over the Shantung settlement is
transferred to the Senate floor.
The Republican leaders say they
have the votes to uphold the commit
tee amendment but administration
Senators appear equally certain that
it would be beaten.
Members said there was no discus
sion on the proposal when it came be
fore the committee today, those on
both sides having made up their
minds and the subject having been
debated at length in the Senate. Sen
ator Brandegee, Republican, Conn.,
asserted all of the American peace
delegates had gone on record as be
lievirfr the award of the Shantung
rights to Japan was wrong, and asked
that the committee vote for what it
believed was right. Senators Hitch
cock. Nebraska, Pittman, Nevada, and
Shields. Tennessee, Democrats, were
absent but their votes were recorded
in the negative.
All of the documents asked of the
Presidejit, Republican members de
clared, had a direct bearing on the
treaty now under consideration and
should be before the committee, offi
cially when it acted. The Polish
treaty and the Rhine agreement had
been submitted to the British house
of commons some time ago, it was as
serted, and British 'prints had been
received unofficially by ' committee
members and put into the Senate
record.
What effect the request for informa
tion might have on the hopes of some
members for a committee report next
week, was a matter of wide-spread
speculation.
Chairman Lodge declared considera
tion of the treaty was progressing as
rapidly as possible and that any delay
had been due to an inability to get
information. Some Democratic mem
bers on. the other hand openly charged
that committee action was being un
necessarily delayed by the treaty's
opponents.

AS PERSECUTED
Says US. Trade Commission
Willful or Ignorant In Its
Denunciation of Packers; All
Oppose Federal Regulation
WASHINGGTON. Aug. 23. Re
frigerator car operations of the five
big packers were defended today be
fore the senate agricultural commits
tee, which is considering the Ken
yon and Kendrick bills for regulating
the packing industry, and the separa
tion from it of the operation of such
cars. .
C. B. Heinemann, representing the
National Livestock exchange, said
that they were not the source of di
criminatiou against wholesale groc
ers, and other packer competitors. He
characterized the denunciation by the
federal trade commission and others
of the effects of packer ownership of
the cars as "willful misrepresenta
tion, or demonstrations of blissful
ignorance."
Mr. Hinemann was preceded on the
stand by a series of retailers, pro
ducers and others who all had objec
tions to make to the regulating bills.
The witness went into the details
of methods of organizing a "peddleT
car route," by which small lots of
packers' products are distributed to
smaller points throughout, the United
States.
"The only thing that could be ac
complished by abolishing these would
be shortening the supply at number
less places," he said.
G. O. Virtue, examiner tor the fed
eral trade commission, secured per
mission to question the witness fur
ther. "It is true that at certain points in
the southwest the peddler cars work
out better freight rates for their own
than do ordinary freight cars, is -not
it?" Virtue asked.
"Yes, but that's the fault of the
jobbers, who don't know their busi
ness," Heinemann immediately re
sponded.' "There are no privileges
the other wholesalers can't obtain
by working. out the same system." ,

West Front In Europe; Says Germany to Dominate Wexico
NEW YORK. Aug. 23. Revelations i
of etxensive German plots in Mexico!
during the war. which included a'
proposed invasion of the United
States by a German-Mexican army
of 45,000 men, at the same time that
the Germans launched their last drive
cn the Western front in July, 1918,
were made here tonight by the Na
tional Association for the Protection
of American rights in Mexico, which
gave out a statement by Dr. P. B.
Altendorf, formerly of the United
States military intelligence depart
ment, reciting his experience as an
American secret service agent in that
country.
Dr. Altendorf, the son of a Polish
banker in Cracow, Austrian Poland,
abandoned a medical course in the
University of Vienna, at the outbreak
of the war, and fled to Mexico, where!
he wa3 offered a position as a Ger
man spy to operate against the
United States by Kurt Jahnke, head
of the German secret service in Mex
iW Takes Job as German Spy.
"With pretended reluctance, but
with secret joy 1 accepted." he said,
"and at once found myself in a posi
tion to render valuable service to the,
allies in general and to the United
States in particular." ""' .
He opened communication with the
border as a volunteer worker to the
millitary intelligence department, he
claims, and later was sworn in as a
special agent of the military depart
ment. i
Dr. Altendorf warns the people
of the United States against a
proposed German conquest of
Mexico. "Within six months
after the United States ratifies s
the treaty.." he says, "Germany
will have complete economic con-a
trol of Mexico. Within a very
few years, if they are permitted
to carry out the plans they have
formulated and are now execut
ing at fast as they can, the Ger
mans will have absolute econo
mic political and military control
of Latin-Americans as well as
foreigners in Mexico."
Referring to the proposed invasion
of the United States. Dr. Altendorf
sets forth that in his dual capacity as
a captain in the German army and a
colonel in the Mexican army, he
helped to train nine hundred German
reserves in Sonora, who were to form
the nucleus of the proposed German
Mexican army and that in his true
character as an American secret ser
vice agent, he prevented the ft-aid
from being carried out.
Says Carranza in Plot.
"This ambitious scheme," he said,
"was financed by Von Eckhardt
German ambassador to Mexico, and
was undertaken with the co-operation
of Carranza." Dr. Altendorf enu
merating his services in Mexico, says
in part:
"I delivered into the hands of the
United States military authorities
the German agent. Lathar . Witcke,
alias Pablo Wabirski, the most im
portant individual capture of the war
so far as attack was concerned.
"Wabuski boasted that he had
blown up several munition plants
and stores of explosives, including
the Black Tom Aplosion in New
York, blew up some ships and caus
ed distastrous fires in' the forests of
the Pacific northwest. .
Plotted Murder in Nogales
"Wabirski, was on his way to the
United States by way of Nogales,

and destruction when captured by

of the German imperial code. Wa

"I also betrayed fifty-eight other
German agents and thus enabled the
military intelligence department to
keep effective watch on them, not to
mention some renegade Amercans
who were giving aid and comfort to
the enemy." t
Found Hun Wireless.
Other acts for which Dr. Altendorff
claims credit included:
Discovery of two German wireless
stations m Mexico, capable of taking
messages from this country; report
ing the plan for the German subma
rine raid along the American coast
in April, 1918, one month before it
actually took place; reporting agents
sent by Germans in Mexico to seize
cattle in the United States and the
revelation of a plot by four Germans
to blow up the hydro-electric plant
at Niagara Falls.
Calles Aided Hun Plans.
Calling attention to German com
mercial plans in Mexico, Dr. Alten
dorff reports that:
"The first attempt to carry out an
ambitious German scheme for the
economic conquests and ultimate mili
tary domination of Mexico was a plan

"It is very amusing to see how people will de
ceive themselves by being too incredulous."
P T. BARNUM.
Barnum was not only the greatest showman of
his time, and perhaps of all time, but a man of many
gifts. A shrewd appraisers of human nature, his apt
phrases and mottoes still live in the literature of business.
To be "top incredulous" has made many an
investor too late to profit by the first advance in a
stock, speculation or investment.
DON'T BE ONE OF THEM
The Bowie Oil Basin deserves the faith and there
fort the support and good will .of the public because,
as a prospective oil area, it is geographically sound.
It is common in the metal bearing States to hear it
said "The country is too near the volcanic mountains,"
"too broken" or "burned out" for oil. The Bowie Oil
Basin belongs to the Devonian period and was laid
down after the distant igneous intrusions of the
Tertury age were cast up too late to be affected,
modified or altered in this way. The actual presence
of liquid oil in the valley drift (clay lime shale and
sand)- is convincing testimony. Don't let the - "buga
boo" of the "volcanic ountains" keep you away from
purchasing the 10c Promotion Stock of the United
States Oil and Refining Company of Arizona.
Remember, they are Drilling biting into the
earth at top speed. Fast approaching the oil horizons.
Don't let "incredulity" spoil this particular opportunity.
You may buy this stock at 10c a share' from J. L.

ing Company and L. J. Overlock, Broker.

The Bisbee Public Does NOT Have To Pay
Exhorbitant Prices for Good Shoes at The Fair
The shoe situation is so serious that the styles for this P all will be practically the same as those of last year.
We knew this many months ago. We foresaw the impending high prices, and we bought shoes last Bpring and even
last winter for this coming Fall at "OLD PRICES" in large quantities. This means that there is now in THE FAIR thou
sands of dollars worth of fine footwear that by every merchandising right should be marked with the NEW PRICES to
compare favorably with whatther stores have had to do.
But the FAIR STORE is determined to help break exhorbitant price standards, and fortunately, is able to do It
without actual loss, through just such foresightedness as this.
The result is that footwear in correct styles for Fall of the finest manufacture in America, bought from Bhoe lead
ers who serve the best stores may be bought now t the FAIR for the same prices as you paid last year.
Smart, snappy styles in women's shoes in the new shades of Grey, Brown, Black and White, all widths AAA to E

Labor Shortage
A FOREIGN LABORER returning to his native country and
exhibiting the prosperity that he has accumulated here in
the past five years will prove a mighty good advertisement
for this country. -
It will soon start emigration this way again.
Grave apprehension is just now being expressed as to a possible
labor shortage in the United States; for a few weeks ago is was
estimated that there were 14,000 foreigners camped out around Hob
oken, N. J., awaiting passage abroad, and with like numbers in other
ports.
All of these were men who performed the labor about steel mills
and other industrial plants during the war.
Those who claim to know these people say that they will be con
tented with a visit to their native places; that they will never be
satisfied with the camparative inactivity of their native countries,
find that they will soon return to this country; that much of the
exodus i3 a healthy natural pride in their prosperity and is for the
purpose of exhibiting it to the relatives, friends anl neighbors in the
i own hom whence they catne.
Then it stands to reason that prosperity begets the want of more
prosperity this is generally a human quality and these foreign
laborers will find they way back to the scenes of their first prosperity.
It is exactly the same spirit that many of us native ones here in
American have shown tho esof us who left our native country town
and came to the city to live.
With our first surplus we returned to the native town for a
week end. ...
We stood around the busiest corner of the public square on Satur
day night dressed In a nut brown suit of clothes and a pair of shoes
as yellow as an old-time clarinet.
We smoked cigars with belts on them and were liberal in treat
ing patrons of the Busy Bee Candy Kitchen.
Such exhibitions of city-acquired prosperity on the part of some
of us may be one explanation as to why boys leave the farm.
And we think it will work out this way in the case of the laborer
now leaving us. - , , . '
Even if these do not retuKnr the. exhibition of their prosperity will
Inspire far more to come over' hern than will remain over there.
Own Your Own Home"
UNDER THE SLOGAN "own your own home", a nation-wide
campagn has been started in an effort to stimulate building
and to provide work for the home-coming service men. No
more meritorious "drive" ever was launched, and despite the
high cost of materials of all kinds and the ascendirfg scale of wages,
gratifying results have been obtained. It has been argued that prices
for materials and the pay of workmen will not come down for a long
time; in fact that there is every indication they will go even higher.
Obviously, now is the time to build, if ever.
The men back of the "own your own home" . campaign might get
a valuable lesson if they studied the building operations now in pro
gress at Warren. This little city, the residence section "of Bisbee,
has scored one of the. most remarkable building records ever made
by a place of its population. The construction of homes has gone
along at a remarkable pace and is continuing unabated. At present
there are operations in progress totaling more than $100,000.
Ninety-five per cent of the homes in Warren are owned by the
people who occupy them. No other city in the west can show such
figures. The homes are thoroughly modern and attractive, laid out
on a scientific plan, making Warren in fact as in name "the city
beautiful".
All this has been made possible by a loan system, worked out by
the mining companies, through which any employe can soon pay for
his own home instead of paying rent to a landlord and having nothing
to show for it. The idea has been, not to make a profit on these
homes, but to reap the indirect benefits accuring thro.ugh a corps of
contented employes owning their own residences and vitally inter
ested in the affairs of the community in which they live.
In another column of today's Review will be found a brief re
sume of the method and results of this home-building loan plan which
any one interested in the "own your own home" campaign would do
well to read.
Good, Generous, Kind Hearted Maricopa
IN TONE OF VEILED exultation, not very well mixed with humil
ity, the Phoenix Gazette editorializes about the reappointment of
representatives in the legislature, whereby the capital city coun
ty gets nine delegates to the lower house, gays the Prescott
Journal-Miner. After telling how it came about, the writer startles
and amazes us with this positively fresh news:
"Maricopa county has always been generous to the rest of the
state at the expense of its private interests. In spite of its large
representation in the house it has always taken first thought to con
sidering the desires of other counties, often to (he neglect of its own
interests.
"Jts neighbors in the state have nothing to foar as a result of the
preponderance of power given it iu the lower house of the legislature.
The basis of representation is absolutely equitable because it is
based directly on the voting power of the counties. But outside of
that it will unquestionably be found that Maricopa, realizing its su
perior strength, will be more than ever careful not to use it lor selfish
ends in denying legislation needed to -serve the development of other
sections of the state."
If there ever was a guilty conscience speaking it was there. As
a matter of fact, the reason Maricopa has been so "generous" with
ilie lest of he state is that the rest of the state has combined in re
nt raint of Maricopa, and has beaten her frequently by use f pre
ponderance of strength and cleverness.
'I ho country is about ready to adopt any plan of railroad control
that will remove the necessity for appropriating a half billion dol
lars for expei.tes every once in a while.

RECENT RAINS BIG AID
TO FARMERS OF STATE
Phoenix, Aug. 23. Favorable re
ports continue to come in from prac
tically all sections. Precipitation was
general' over the state during the
week. Douglas and Prescott with 1.85
and 1.4 inches, respectively, record
ing the heaviest falls. In the Oro
Blanco sctloh, wst ofNogales, some
shortage of water was reported eany
in the week, which possibly was re
lieved by showers during the latter
part of the week. Feed on the ranges
is maturing well in the neighborhood
of Pinedale. Concern is expressed in
some sections over the great suprly
of grass which the stock can not keep
eaten down. It is feared that tens
may become a serious fire hazard lat
er when it is dry.
The showers of the past week were
generally beneficial to agricultural in
terests. In Cochise county reports are
very favorable except near Bisbee.
Beans are yielding well and the. fed
crops are growing splendidly. In Na
vajo county the showers interfered
with harvesting and did some damage
to hay. All yields are reported as
very satisfactory. Cotton in tne Salt
river valley made normal progress
drring the week. Weeds are still a
problem in some fields. In the Yuma
section a few boll weevil and aphis
are reported in the cotton, but the
damage 'has been insignificant. No
damage from insect pests is reported
in other sections of the state.

Rev. E. D. Raley, former secretary of

THE ONCE-OVER
By "Griff"
ANNOUNCEMENT
Notice is hereby given that on
and after this date, the heading of
this galley of nonsense will be
"The Once Over." Our nerves are
cracking uner the strain of from
two to 200 daily "tips" that "Be
tween You and I" is bad gram
mar. Every reader with more
than a fourth-grade education ap
parently wants us to know that he
or she has studied the English
language and we have been advis
ed by telephone, letter, in person
and wireless that we's better
change the "I" to "me". In select
ing "Between You and I" as a head
ing, the writer ithought this well
known expression just about typi
fied the sort of " low-browisms" to
which he wanted to give expres
sion. But whatever idea he had in
mind, no one else seems to have
"got if. At first we thought we'd
go through with the title, come
what may, but when we got a
broadside yesterday for linking a
Bisbee man's name with the Scrip
tures, we weakened. That was the
last straw that cracked the poor
old dromedary's spinal column.
Hence the change. '
EVERY BOOST A KNOCK
Count Von Keventlow, tnan
whom there was none whomer
among tUe Germans, has just ue
clared that "Japan alone among
all our loes demonstrated berseii

insists in race equality, would bet
ter start a propaganda campaign
to oitset praise coming irom this

A SHOCKING ACCIDENT
Crowds near tne postoffice yes
terday were horrified to see R. T.
Frazier step in front of the auto
mobile driven by Scott Whaley

after being knocked down, Fra
zier was luted to his feet and it
was at once apparent that his left
leg was broken... Not only that,
but the foot came clear off. Mr.
Frazier only smiled and the crowd
soon got "wise" that it was Mr.
Frazier's cork leg which had been
broken.
DON'T OVERLOOK THE LEAGUE
If our army officers can catch up
with those Mexican bandits and make
them take the $6,500 which Captain
Matlack short changed them out of
when our two aviators were released,
it would serve them right to have
the League of Nations covenant read
to them. This would be cruel and
unusual, but something drastic must
be done about this Mexican bandit
business.

Isn't that Just like England to
try to wish Turkey off on us un

THE UPLIFT URGE.
In Boston the uplifters are planning
to keep the saloons open as soft drink
places so the working man can still
have his "club." They are trying to
find something that will make the
"clubs" attractive, now that the alco
holic lure is no more. These earnest
workers might take a tip from Reno,
Nev., where the liquor emporiums
have all stayed open and each one
has half a dozen poker games run
ning. Reno has had no difficulty in
keeping the "workingmens clubs" pop
ular. In fact, the only trouble Is
getting a. seat.

Uncle Sam is going to sell hams

CAPT. MATLACK SHOULD WORRY
They are talking about retiring
Matlack as soon as he returns
from his hunt for the Bandits
whom he "short-changed' out of
$6,500 after their capture of two
American aviators. After this feat
we suspect that Captain Matlack
used to sell tickets for a circus.
If he is retired he ought to get a
job in a theatre box office.

men used to rave over florid oil paint
ings who wouldn't walk across the
street to view a Rubens masterpiece. -The
paintings that adorned the fash
ionable cafes of the period were for
the most part exceedingly frank. In
their natural effects they left but lit
tle to the imagination. Here's a
chance for some wealthy patron of
the arts to do something original.
Why not found a museum where these
examples of the painter's genius could
be preserved for posterity? In time
they would become as great curiosi
ties as the cocktail mixer or the bottle
of eight-year-old. SUNDAY, XXTGUST 24, 1910

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug. 23. Trading in
stock was narrow and restricted, deal
ings dwindling to the smallest total of
any week euj session since the ea.'y
part of the year. What the marK.et
lackel in activity and breadth, how
ever, was largely made up in strength,
even though the strongest featu.es
were speculative issues which owe
their prominence to pools and allied
professional ;rtehest3. Motors and as
sociated specialties scored extrerie
tains -A 2 to 13 points, oils and tobac
co 1 to 5, and equipments, metals and
several of the better known special
ties finished at gains of 1 to 3 points.
Ra'ls were 1 stless most of the broad
session, but oime forward toward .'.e
end.
U. S. Industrial alcohol was agam
the ore wea: feature, extending yes
terday's sevive decline d yaimost z
points, but k.rdred issues kept pa.e
v.ith the market's upward trend.
Sales amounted to 325,000 shares.
For the sv.( nd time this year :ne
weekly bank statement reported a 'e
pletior. of actual reserve, the deficit
being ulightly more than $800,000. This
exhibit is the more interesting because
actual loans weer contracted by al
most $35,000,000.
Ono of the factors contributing to
the siock market improvement was
the further strength of sterling ex
change rates on Paris, Rome also ral
lying partially.
Bonds were steady in the main, de
spite slight irregularities in liberty
and international issues: Tocal sales,
par value, aggregated $4,750,000. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
ou call during the week.
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 23. By its ner
vous and very unsettled course the
stock market this week unmistakably
reflected fun her the developments in
the industrial world, more particular
ly the ex'ension of labor disturbances.
Other undoubted factors which accel
erated the raarket on the down grade
were the spread of the movement
againot high costs and the absolute
demoralization which reigned in the
foreign exchange system.

9tocks lost the greater part of the ad
vance made in the previous five
months, while a few standard issues
were at lowest levels of the year, in
vestment conditions also left much to
be desired from the standpoint of con
servative financial interests, the bond
market as a whole tending downward,
with many representative issues at
minimum quotations for the past year
or more.
Although the stock market Is tech
nically stronger for the liquidation of
the past thee weeks, doubt Is ex
pressed in foremost trading circles as
to the advisability of a resumption of
bullish operations at this uncertain pe
riod. Money tendencies were rirmer,
call loans amounting to 8 per cent
after ruling at 2 to 3 per cent under
the higher figure. Need for further
caution respecting loans was empha
sized by the weekly banks tatement,
which disclcsed the second deficit of
the year in actual reserves.
THE GRAIN IARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 23. Liquidation
was a constant feature In the corn
raarket today. A decline in cash corn
prices, father large quantities country
offerings and belief that purchase of
Texas corn in large quantities might
greatly J'-pieer the cash market, gave
impetus to ?:e downwardtrend. Lack
of support until extreme low points
were reaches were observable. Corn
closed weak and near the low point,
prices being from 2 to 6 cents net
lower with September leading the de
cline. Final figures were September
?1.78H to 1.78?4 and December
$1.41, to $1.1. Oats lost from
to lcent and provisions closed 25c to
15c li.ver.
Oats fell away with corn, but witMn
narrower limi's. Trade was lareaiy
local with country offerings moderate.
In t'ae praV sions market the ea-ly
gain induced by improved foreign ex
change figures and a suggestion of
better cash business, was followed oy
a sharp reaction. The late market ex
hibited weakness similar to the de
cline in corn values.
Closing figures were 25c to $1 05
lower with October showing the
greatest decline.
BANK HOLDINGS DECREASE
NEW YORK, Aug. 23. The actnal
condition of clearing house banks and
trust compaj.es for the week shows
that they hoi-. $812,690 reserve in le
ficit of legal requirements. This is a
decrease of 53,908,400 from last week.
Withdrawal of balances by interior
banks in proportion to the crop move

PARIS IS ONE CITY WHICH WILL NEVER FORGET AMERICANS
RECEPTION OF FRENCH TO U. S.
FIGHTERS AT JUSTICE FETE IS
AS CORDIAL AS TO AWN HEROES
In this, the last story of my experi
ences in the A. E. F., I will try and
give a tew impressions gleaned from
my various visits to Paris, the mecca
for the world tourist as well as the
historian, the student and those look
ing for a wonderful time.
First I will take you , to tne Cata
combs, just out of Paris a ilttie way.
"Some dugout", is the way the dough
boy' sightseer in Paris characterizes
the catacombs ' of "'La ' lielle "Ville"
where 6,000,000 skeletons are rattled
for his benefit. No trip to Paris is
complete without a' visit to the cata
combs and even the doughtiest "over-the-topper"
gets a real thrill when he
leaves the "Alotro", the Paris subway,
at Dnfert Rochereau, crosses , the
street and descends the 131 steps
which lead underground Into the old
est graveyard In centrol Europe The
"carriercs" were built-originally by
the Romans who used tne place as a
stone quarry. In 1799 the staircase
was constructed for the benefit of the
tourist.
A City Underground.
1 Even the fact that a bunch of us
were banded together during the visit
did not make the cold chills any the
less convincing as we - stumbled
through the long series of galleries
which extend for some 200 mile3 un
der the city of Paris. Then there is
the poisonous lake - in which no fish
can live. But the tomb of Issoires,
who was one of the leading brigands
of the eighteenth century and who es
tablished his G. H. Q. in the cata
combs, is most particularly sought
out to stir the most jaded imagina
tion. The six million skeletons are dis
posed of mostly in fantastic murial de
signs. In other places they are stack
ed up like cordwood or used as a
flooring. In my opinion these worthy
skeletons made better floors than ceil
ing, for the walls of the catacombs are
always dripping wet and our overseas
cap did not rank very bjgh as an um
brella. Leading off the main galleries are
hundreds of smaller passages which
were used during the days of the
revolution as hiding places for politi
cians whose presence on theParia
bolevards was a signal for comment.
Bones and Teeth for Souvenirs
There is a well founded rumor to
the effect that many of these noted
skeletons are now lacking in their full
Quota of bones and dental equipment.
Only the unpacking of the doughboys
haversack after we got back homo
will disclose the truth or falsity of the
rumor. Perhaps this overestimates the
soldier's passion for souvenirs but
from my own experience I know that
Paris, as well as the front line towns,
is minus great numbers of articles
which cause most people to wonaer
what constitutes a souvenir.
Both Angels and Devils Here. ,
On my last visit to Paris last May
Deiore coining nome l naa quite a
time trying to see all the many places i
of interest that I had missed on previ

and virtues of Paris and it would take
none less than the devil himself to
"compree" all the vices and attrac
tions of Paris. No human being could
sink so low as to experience all the
many forms of vice that exist in that
great city and no person could live
long enough to go through it all.
Conventions Do Not Hamper.
Because of the great extremes of
human life in Paris the individual per-
sonality stands forpmnst In thn
ricuuu tipum b me. everyone aoe
just exactly as they feel like doing
without fearing the comments of their
neighbors. In Paris the people do not
hesitate to do a thing for fear of the
opinions of others or because it is not
conventional-and in that respect it ts
a wonderful city. One can give play
to the free expression of his or her
real character. without compunction or
interference by others.' Of course this
condition makes for very,, very good,
or, very, very bad people.
The average American could not
live in Paris for thirty days without
falling a victim to the night life of the
boulevards and the irresistible forces
of that "wicked" city.
Ever a Delight to Tourist.
To the tourist, Paris is ever a de
light. It is the third largest city in
the world and as much a center for
commercial and manufacturing occupa
tions as it is for art literature, set-! traffic on the busiest of these boule

Ruins of Roman Baths.
The Hotel Cluny, an old mansion
containing large collections of mediae

built on the site of the Palace of the
Frankish kings and shows ruins of
Roman baths.
On the right bank of the Seine lies
the magnificent open space known as
the Place de la Concorde containing
the monuments to the four free cities
of France and one of Cleopatra's
needles which stands on the same
spot where the old guillotine stood
in the days of the Revolution.

Social Life on Boulevards.
The social life of Paris anil much
of its business is located about the
grand, boulevards, broad tree-shaded
avenues which girdle the older pari
of the city formerly .defined by the
great stone wall surrounding the early
limits of the city.
Two triumphal arches, erected by
Louis XIV, the Porte St. Martin and
Porte St. Pennis, divide the stream of
main l'Auxerrois; dating from the thir-
teenth century, from ' whose belfry

tower of St. Jacques, which is just a
stalls of the vegetaole and fruit ven
ders.
Napoleon's Triumphal Arch.
There are numerous columns, monu
ments and triumphal arches, the larg
est of which is the Arc de Xriomphe
de l'Etoile commended by Napoleon I,
commemorating various events in the
turbulent history of France.
The Palace of the Trocadero, erect
ed for the Universal Exhibition of
1S7S, has a hall capable of holding
5,000 spectators and just across the
Seine is the Eiffel tower, used during j
tne. war as a wireless station, and
noted as the highest structure in the
world, reaching a height of 984 feet.
There are dozens of churches in the
cky noted for age, architecture or
decoration, but the most prominent is
the church of the Sacre Coeur, which
stands alone on the top of Montmartrc
and commands a view of the . whole
capital.; It is modern and as yet un
finished, forming a vast basilica in
the Roman style, with a .Bysantine
dome 372 feet high.
The Bois de Boulogne is a great
park in the city affording a fashiona-.
ble driving place and promenade.
Other great parks include the grounds
about the palace of St. Cloud, Chan
tilly and the more distant Fontaine
bleau and Versailles.
City Founded by Small Gallic Tribe.
Paris was the ancient capital of a
small Gallis tribe, the Parisil; was the
capital of Constantius Chlorus; was
later made the capital of the Frank
ish kindom by Clovis in 508; was rul-
ed by counts under the Carlovinglans:

Salvo Announces Armistice.
The Bigning of the armistice 'was
announced at 11 o'clock by a salvo of
five guns from the forts. I was just
coming out of the subway when the
guns boomed and I heard a French of
ficer say "The Peace Barrage" and in
the twinkling of an eye the entire
aspect of Paris changed. People in
the streets sang, wept and shouted for
joy. Flags appeared everywhere as
if by magic and the boulevards were
taken possession of by the trimphant
processions of men, women and chil
dren carrying the banners of the Al
lies. By noon the boulevards were
packed with people and the . crowds
took possession of the. taxis and lor
ries and American trucks were loaded
with soldiers all parading up one
boulevard and down the next.
I saw one excited Moroccon soldier
doing a war dance on top of one of the
hoods of a truck. Paris without hesi
tation decided to do no more work for
the day. Tne Prefect of Police gave
orders that the lights could be turned
on in the evening and the blue shad-
ing which for four years had protected
Paris from enemy air raids was wash
ed off the windows.
Flrst Lights in Four Years.
At seven o'clock Paris suddenly be
came a city of light again and that
night will never be forgotten in tne
beam of the people of that city as
the crowds, stimulated even more by
the artificial lights, continued to give
vent to their feelings all during tne
night.
Cue of the jnost characteristic
events of the evening occurred on the
balcony of the Matin, the morning
newspaper, just after nine o'clock
when Mme. Demogeat appeared on
the balcony and sang the national airs
of France and America. The strains
of these great battle hymns echoed
up and down the boulevard while the
crowd, which certainly numbered 73,
000, stood bareheaded and silently
wept. " i

was the same and the spirit was the
same except that now it was in happy
joyous gratitude and not In stern

Remembered Who Saved Paris.
Several thousand of them con
tented themselves by simply remain
ing in the great squares and climb
ed on platforms and carts which en
terprising speculators rented at un
heard of prices. Eager thousands
passed on up the wide tree-lined
Avenue Champ Elysee towards the
Place de Iena where most of the
Parisian festivities start. The cele
bration was more in honor of the
Americans, than the signing of the
armistice. The Americans who had
held up the all-powerful triumphant
Prussian Guard and blocked the
road to Paris and - the Parisians
were not forgettiag who. had block -
ed the road to Paris
The stamina, pluck and dash of.u.e
Americans in a supremely critical
hour put the heart into all of France.
After four years of heart-sore weari
ness and misery the French people
knew that it was the American who
turned the tide in their favor and
Paris, their city, the light of their
world, was free from the Prussian
menace. And they were not a bit
backward in telling us about it on
this day. Gay, warm hearted and
joyous they poured out their pride,
emotion and joy. It was a grand

In Paris the girls, and there are

Wilson Arrives With Arizonans.
Probably the next most prominent
day in Paris was the 14th of Decem
ber when President Wilson arrived.
The 158th infantry, the old First
Arizona infantry was the guard of
honor.
From the moment the crowd" saw
President Wilson coming out of the
Pois de Boulogne station there was,
no doubt but that it. was the people
of Paris who welcomed the presi
dent. "Vive la Wilson" contrasted
strongly against the occasional "hur
rah" of the American and epitomiz
ed the spirit that stirred the throng.
It wasn't from etouds but from the
emotion-swept individual, the scarred j

the heart was stirred by the cries
of "Welcome." All down the wide

5,000,00a People Greet President.
It was a holiday all over that part
of France and there were at least five
millicn people in Paris lining the
streets all over the city. ;
When the presidential party arriv
ed at 10 o'clock that day the cele
bration started outside the station, a
French band sounded the Marseii
laise; a moment's silence and thea
from inside the station the first
strains of the Star Spangled Banner.
A gun boomed the first of thirty
Jive at half minute intervals from
the parapet formerly a part of th
old fortifications of Paris. Along
the boulevards and all the open
spaces there was a solid mass of
peqple. Along the edge of the crowds
ex-soldier peddlers wearing war
decorations were selling novelties of
the day.
The crowd was smiling constantly
and all were happy but at times
there seemed to be an air of wonder
ment when the eight carriages had
passed and nothing more followed,
but it gave the Parisian what he
wanted a chance to fall in and fol
low the procession which is the J
Parisian form of celebrating, and it
was kept lip till the small hours of
the morning. The night was sugges
tive of the Madri Gras at New Or
leans and of the armistice night.
Of course we doughboys were the
most conspicuous ' among the cele
brants, but we were enthusisatically
seconded by the Canadians, Austral
ians and French poilus themselves. A
picture show was in progress in the
street near the Credit Lyonaise bank.
The portarits of Mangin, Petain,
Joffre, Foch and Clemenceau drew
cheers, but when the familiar fea
tures of our president was thrown on
the screen the many thousands out In
front went fairly wild.
"Great White Way" Relighted
Everywhere the lights were turned
on again for the second time as on
the night of the armistice and for
the first time since that first gloomy
night in 1914 the theater fronts were
illuminated, this time mostly in de
signs after the American flag, until
the boulevards resembled the former
great white way of pre-war days.
The main difference in vthis cele
bration from that of Nov. 11th was
that in every little side street there
was a little parade all its own re

tations ot the ancient pageants which
have long passed and been forgotten;
these parades were merely the scant
memories of previous spectacles in

In demanding ransom for the two

Mexico last week, the bandit3 of the

years ago, when be held two Ameri

,The incident is still fresh in the
memory of all who were along this
section of the border In October, 1915.
It is particularly fresh in the memory
of "Noddy" Wilson, present driver of
the stage from Cananea to Bisbee, for
he was one of the men captured by
the notorious-"Pancho" and it was
he who led the two physicians back
to the border and to safety under cov
er of darkness after the ransom had
been paid.
In view of the way Captain Matlack
"short changed" the Mexican bandits
the other day at the border below
Marfa, Texas, and got away safely
with the two captured airmen, it be

ence in the methods followed by Villa
and his more recent imitators in col

pany at Cananea were the two phy
sicians captured along with Wilson in
the kidnaping of four years ago. It
is a striking commentary on Villa's
"principles" that at the time they
were seized, threatened with execu
tion and held for $25,000 ransom, they
were doing the merciful work of the
Red ' Cross, giving medical aid and
supplies to Villa's own men wounded
In the fighting that had raged for
the possession of Agua Prieta, the
Mexican town opposite Douglas.
Thigpen, Miller and Wilson were In
the hills a few miles south of Agua
Prieta when notified that they were
under arrest Villa's excuse at the
time ?as that the United States gov
.emment had committed an act of war
federal troops- to come to tie rescue
of the Agua Prieta garrison through
American territory. Troops had been
sent In from Juarez and Sonora by
way of Nogales, Naco and El Paso,
and Villa had thus been prevented
from capturing the prized port of
Agua Prieta. Had he succeeded in
taking this place he would have been
In supreme command of the two states
of Chiiiuahua and Sonora and his rev
olutionary movement would have been
immeasurably strengthened thereby.
But the shipment of. Mexican troops
through United States territory ruined
the bandit learer's plans and he pro
ceeded to get revenge on Drs. Miller
and Thigpen aild Wilson, their chau-feur.
After their capture the three Amer
icans were taken back below the bor
der to Villa Verde, about 18 miles
from Naco and approximately the
same distance from Agua Prieta. Then
Villa sent a couries to Major Evans
at Naco notifying him that he had the
two Americans in capitlvity and un
less the $25,000 was forthcoming at
once they would be executed.
deorge Y. Young and Frank B. Ham
ilton at once w.ent about securing the
money and through tne mining com
panies soon had the amount in hand.
Meantime the captives were moved
about from point to point to prevent
their being recaptured by the Amer
icans nnd were constantly threatened
with death. They were not mistreat
ed, however, Wilson said, and were
given the same fare as the soldiers.
which was scanty enough and consist
ed principally of frijoles.
Finally, after being held captives
for three days, arrangements were
made for the payment of the ransom
and the release of the prisoners, who
were still held at Villa Verde. Young
pnd Hamilton, together with Major
Evans of Naco. took the money to the
line at Naco and were met there by
Villa and his staff. The money was
passed across the line with little cer
emony and Villa at once dispatched
a courier to Villa Verde to order the
Americans released.
On the arrival of the courier, Major
Nieves, the Villa adjutant in charge
of the American captives, told them
they were at liberty to go. They ask
ed for horses or a car to transport
them to the line, but these were
refused. They then asked that they
at least be given a letter or passports
so that they would not be molested.
These also were refused and they
were notified that they wonld have
to sret back to the United States on
foot the best way they could.
Meantime Wilson heard some of the
Mexicans planning- to rob them. One'
Mexican wanted Wilson's shoes, an
other wanted Dr. Thigpen's clothes,
another declared he would have Dr.
Wilson's boots, 'etc. The Mexicans fl-
nallv began quarreling as to the dis
position of the Americans' belongines
and Wilson recognized that this would
end with their being killed if they
fell into the clutches of this particu
lar outfit.
There was also considerable dif
ference of opinion among the Amer
icans as to the best way out of this
dangerous section of Sonora. One of
the physicians wanted to jret back to
Cananea, where be bad his brtoner
ins: another thoueht they should
make for Aeua Prieta. Wilson, how
ever, knowinar the country well, de
cided that the best chance for safety
lay In making for Naco.
So the three Americans started off
on foot, taking rather a round-about
way to deceive the bandits. Finally
thev struck a trail that crossed the
main wagon road on which the Mex
ican troops were stationed. Running
up this trail a few hundred yards,
they left) it and made directly for
the tall grass, where they lay down
in perfect concealment until dark.
Then, under cover of the friendly
darkness they started for Naco. For
tunately Wilson was familiar with the
territory and they did not become lost.
Choosing well concealed trails they
successfully avoided the Mexican pa
trols and at dawn the next day made
their way across the line at Naco to
safety.
and decide ' when it is justified and
when it is not. He must be a reso
lute man, capable of restraining all
forms of flamor. He must be a man
with a conscience. He must have a
clear conception of his duty. He must
resolve to be right as often a3 it is
possible for him to be right and he
must resolve to do right as the right
is revealed to him. He must be a
courageous man, calm and clear vis
ioned in his courage, a man who can
not be bluffed from his course by
abuse or misrepresentation.
Susceptible to Compliments.
Like every other human being, the
editor likes commendation. The news
paper is not above confessing that
it craves popularity and the kindly
thought of men and women. But the
self-respecting editor will not court
popularity by the sacrifice of his cour
age nor by yielding to clamor what
he conceives to be the proper course
for him to pursue. He will not per
mit any man to dictate to him as to
how he shall conduct his business.
There Is slight danger, however, that
the editor's head ever will be turned
by any praise that comes his way.
His critics will attend to the matter
of taking the conceit out of him, if
any shall arise.
I view of the general dissatisfac
tion with newspapers, it is difficult to
understand just why anybody thinks
he c6uld run a newspaper better than
the editors in charge. It is quite like
ly that if these critics were given the
job they would make a worse botch
of It than the editor whom they crit
icise and would consider that an nn
kindness had been done to them when
they were induced to change places
with the editor.
. The newspaper does not claim even
In its most exalted moments, that It
Is even humanly perfect and It does
ot expect to be perfect as long as it
is a human instutution. A' lot of the
things that are said about it In cen
sure are remote from the truth. It is
often lied about. The newspaper does
not claim to be better than any other
human institution, and certainly it Is
no worse than many of them. Con
sidering the power that It wields, it
Is not extravagant to say that it ex
hibits a degree of restraint which one
Is not able to disern in the critics who
discover so much imperfection in it.

Oh, My, Yes: Most Any
One Can Be An Editor
Collins Says Everybody Who Knows
Him Is Talking About His lm
provement Since Taking Tanlac
"Tanlac has made such a big im
provement in my condition that I feel
as well in every way now, as I ever
did in my life, and I have actually
gained thirty pounds since I com
menced taking it," said F. T. Collins,
who lives at 572 Bortwicht St., Port
land, Ore., a few days ago.
"I began to have indigestion about
Ihree years ago," continued Mr. Col
lins," and this condition just kept on
getting worse all the time until it
finally became chronic. My stomach
was in such bad condition that every
thing I ate disagreed with me and
caused me to suffer afterwards. Gas
often formed on my stomach, and I
would have the worst sort of cramp
ing spells, and sometimes I would be
so nauseated that I could not retain
what I ate. I also suffered with pains
in the small of my back, and. if I
stooped over I could hardly straight
en up again. I was badly constipated
all the time, and would often have
headaches that woiild last for nearly
a week at a ticie. I finally got so
weak and run down that I had to
give up my job. Then my nerves
went back on me and. I never got a
good night's sleep after that. I tell
you, I had just about reached the
point where I was a complete nervous
wreck. x
"I didn't think any medicine would
do me any good, but I thought 1
would try Tanlac anyway, and to my
surprise I began to improve by the
time I had finished my first bottle.
Well, from that time on I just Jtept
getting better right along until I am
now as well and strong as I ever was.
I never had a better appetite, and can
eat just anything I want without suf
fering afterwards'. I honestly believe
my stomach is in as good condition as
it ever was. The pain has left my
back too. I am never constipated
now, and those awful headaches are a
thing of the past. My nerves are as
steady as a clock, and I get in eight
or nine hours good, restful sleep ever
night. I have regained all my
strength, and have gained so much In
weight that everybody who knows me
is talking about it. I never lose a
chance to say a good word for Tan-
lacj'

The following article on the trials,
and tribulations of the editor's lot in
life was taken from a recent copy of
the "Fourth Estate" and reflect the
views of a large percentage of the
men who help to make newspapers.
"Most any man can be an editor."
While that was written in jest, it is
typical of much loose thinking about
editors and newspaper making. Ex
pressed In another form, most every
body believes he could do a better job
of editing the newspaper than the edi
tor who Is actually on the job. That
Is to say, everybody feels free to ex
ercise the widest latitude in criticis
ing the product of the editor's labor,
the newspaper.
Criticising the newspaper Is the fa
vorite outdoor and indoor sport of just
about everybody. The newspaper Is
criticised for what It does and for
what it fails to do. The newspaper is
continually stepping on some one's
toes, it is continually disagreeing with
some one, and therefore it Is con
tinually being "cussed" by some one.
One thing which tfie average man
will not tolerate Is to have people
disagree with him. The editor thus
finds himself In the situation of not
being able to please anybody. Listen
ing to the way men and women, too
roast the newspapers, the editor
often wonders If the newspapers have
any friends; he wonders how they
manage to retain subscribers and live.
, It Is not often that the editor hears
a friendly word for the child of his
effort, the newspaper. If readers think
kindly of it. they are likely to keep
these thoughts In the back of their
minds. It Is only when they are dis
pleased that they become vocal.
Editor Shows Hand.
Why Is It that the editor's work Is
subjected to such a running fore of
relentless criticism? For the same
reason that every other business con
ducted in the glare of the public spot
light is similarly criticised. Every
thing the newspaper does Is done In
the lieht of day. Everything the edi
tor and his staff writes Is In full view
of every reader. If he makes mis
takes or commits errors of judgment,
they are all there with the rest. No
concealment Is possible. The merchant
may be able to conceal many of his
mistakes and erroneous judgments
from the public view, but not the ed
itor. It Is a source of delight to many
men to point out the mistakes of other
men. They priae memseives on me
keenness of their minds which enable
them to detect these mistakes. A good
many of the severest critics of the
newspaper are men who have sought
to control the newspaper, to further
their own selfish interests and have
been denied. Such men are the ed
itor's most savage critics.
Probably , the general run of men
would be surprised if they could know
how many men and how many kinds
of men are trying all the time to con
trol the editor and the. newspaper, in
order, that the newspaper may be used
to advance their petty desires or am
bitions. The editor is forced to be
on guard against these men constant
ly. The newspaper often goes contrary
to the strong desires of ambitious
men. Take note of the man who is
continually berating the newspapers;
who accuses them of corruption and
all manner of evil intent. It. would
be found, .if the truth were known,
that he had failed to have his way
with the newspapers, that he could
not control hem, could not use them
If the newspapers had been submli
slve to him he would not have a word
of complaint to utter about them.
Human Institution. .
The newspaper Is a human Institu
tion produced by human minds. If
humanity were infallible, the editor
would be Infallible. The newspaper
only reflects the daily life of human
Ity. As such, It gives publicity to the
mistakes, the folly, the sins of human
ity, as well as to the goodness of hu
manity. As long as it persists in
bringing to the public view the mis
takes men and women make, wheth
er they be mistakes of foolishness or
sinfulness, just so long is the news
paper going to have critics.
Many good people would have the
newspaper report only the goodness
and pleasantness there is in the world
and there Is a lot of it and sub
merge the evil. But the newspaper
believes that It is Its duty to pub
lish the evil along with the good.
The editor always gives serious ear
to the newspaper's critics; often he
learns from their criticisms. He is
obliged to steel his soul against sen
sitiveness, for If he attached too great
weight to criticism he would become
so discouraged as to be worthless to
his newspaper. The editor must pos
sess a somewhat judicial mind, so that
he may be able to weigh all criticism

INVADER OIL A REFINING COMPANY
This Company was organized about two years ago at Muskogee,
Okla. It began business with a paid-up capital of $00,000.00 and a
40-acre lease, on which there were four producing wells. The gsowth
Of the Company from that small beginning has been phenomenal.
Under capable, aggressive and experienced management it prospered
from the first. This is what it has accomplished in two short years.
The Company now has more than 25,000 acres of carefully selected
leases in the best oil fields of Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas. It also
has
FIFTY-THREE PRODUCING WELLS
The INVADER COMPANY has maintained a ino?r aggressive
drilling policy from the start. As ; result the Company now has a3
producing wells, with 8 additional wells now drilling.
The policy of the Company has been to drill without ceasing to
keep the drills pounding away continuously day and night. This policy
accounts for the wonderful success the Company has achieved. This
is the ONLY sure way that a really, big and successful oil-produc
ing Company can be built up.
PAID THIRTY-THREE CASH DIVIDENDS
The INVADER COMPANY, though only two years old, has al
ready paid to its Stockholders 33 Cash Dividends, and another Divi
dend will be paid the first of next month. These Dividends have all
been paid nut of the Company's earnings. A Cash Dividend has been
paid every month, together with many extra dividends. While pay
' ing these Dividends the Company has grown rapidly and steadily on
a solid foundation, until the INVADER COMPANY today towers far
above many of the older companies.
INVADER OIL & REFINING COMPANY OF TEXAS
THE INVADER OIL & REFINING COMPANY OF TEXAS was
recently organized by the officers of the Invader Oil & Refining
Company of Oklahoma. The same men who have so successfully
managed the Invader Company of Oklahoma are at the head of, and
in full charge of the Invader Company of Texas.
The INVADER COMPANY OF TEXAS has an authorized capital
of $300,000. The men who have made such a big, successful and
profitable company of the INVADER COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA
are making the INVADER COMPANY OF TEXAS even more success
ful. The opportunities are so great in Texas and the wells come in
so large, and the INVADER COMPANY OF TEXAS is growing much
faster than did the INVADER COMPANY OF OKLAHOMA.
20,000 ACRES OF TEXAS LEASES
We bought many desirable leases in the Texas fields months ago
when these fields were first discovered. We now have more than
20,000 acrs of Texas leases. Our properties were chosen with care 1
we have leases in the most promising fields. l is the policy of our
Company to acquire only the best Properties. We have close-in,
provea acreage. We have leases in the best fields, right up against
the big wells where we are certain of bringing in big producers.
'PROPERTIES IN RANGER 'FIELD
We have a fine lease in this famous field! the Sue Lease. This
Property is situated in the most productve part of this wonderful
field. It is surrounded by many of the largest gushers in America.
These well are located near us notice their approximate location
and reported production:
The Humble Gusher, 5000 barrels 1500 feet southeast of us.
The Tex Rickard Gusher, 3500 barrels, 800 feet northeast of us.
The Weed Gusher, 3000 barrels, 500 feet west of us.
The Harris Gusher, 3000 barrels, 2000 feet east of us.
The Scott Gusher, 3000 barrels, 2000 feet north of us.
t The Norwood Gusher, 10,000 barrels, a mile northeast of us.
The Connellee Gusher, 6000 barrels, a mile northeast of us.
The Perkins Gusher, 9000 barrels, northwest of us.
FIRST WELL NEARLY COMPLETED
We began drilling our frst well on ths Sue lease more than six
weeks ago. It is now drilling below 2700 feet and we expect to com
plete it in the next twenty days. The drillers are working day and
night we are rushing the completion of' this well with all possible
speed we are practically certain of bringing in an enormous gusher.
THINK what it will mean to our company and to our Stockholders to
get a 5000 barrel or a 10,000 barrel gusher on this property.
DRILLING ON WILM LEASE-
We are also drilling below 1500 feet on our big Wilm Lease
this is a great Property of 412 acres, and the indications are most
favorable for the bringing in of another big well here. Should this
well come in a big producer, this , one Property will be worth mil
lions. THE FAMOUS NORTHWEST BURKBURNETT EXTENSION
This is the most prolific, the most wonderful, the most profitable
and the most remarkable oil field in the entire world. Texas has some
amazing oil fields. The field of Ranger, though only a few months
old, is already famous throughout the world. Yet that field cannot
approach or compare with the far greater field, the Northern Burk.
burnett Extension.
FOUR WONDERFUL OIL PROPERTIES
We have secured, at an enormous cost, Tour tremendously valu
able and remarkable well located Properties in this Pool. These
Properties are located among, and surrounded by the BIGGEST
GUSHERS in the field. They are today worth a half milliton dollars
we believe they will soon be worth SEVERAL MILLION DOLLARS!
2,500 BARREL WELL NEAR US! 3,000 BARREL WELL CLOSC TO
- US! 5,000 TO 7,000 BARREL GUSHERS CROWD US!
Nearly all of the Big Gushers in this iield are within a mile of
our Properties, while many of them are only a few hundred feet
distant. Our lease is sandwiched in between these remarkable and
famous Gushers the United, the Golden Cycle, Thrift No. 2, Thrift
No. 3, King Eight. Texas Chief, Eurk-Waggoner, and the Gray Gan
der. The Willow Bloom gusher has just come in directly across the
road from our Property, with a reported production of 2,500 barrels.
The British-American Gusher, reported good for more than 2,000 bar
rels, came in last Thursday, 400 feet north of us. The Sinclair Com
pany has two wells on the sand waiting for pipe line connections, 200
feet east of us. You accordingly see that this property is surrounded
by big gushers on the east, the south, the west and on the north.
The great TEAXAS CHIEF GUSHER is located only a short dis
tance northwest of our Property. This well came i'i with a reported
production of 7,000 barrels and with the oil spouting 40 feet above
the top of the derrick. A short distance south of us is the UNITED
GUSHER which recently came in with a reported production of 3,000
barrels daily.
OUR PROPERTY IN BLOCK 89
We have 5 acres in Block 89; This lease adjoins the west line
of Block 89. It lays in the center IN THE VERY HEART of a mile
circle which takes in ALL THE FAMOUS GUSHERS in this most
remarkable field. It is surrounded by a veritable forest of Gushers,
drilling wells, ijnoiinous oil tanks and derricks. On every side der
ricks are going up over night and actual drilling Marts just as fast
as the drilling machinery can he rushed in and started to work.
LEASES BRING TREMENDOUS PRICES
AVe have refused ah offer of '$2o'n.o6o.OO for this 5 acre lease. The
i:iclair Company last week purchased a lease immediately, adjoining
our Properly on the east, for which the-y paid $400,000.00. The Liv
ingston Company announce the purchase of a lOacre lease in this
field for $llo.0o0.(0. The Munger-Verschoyle interest announced on
.Monday the sule of a 5 acre lease near us for $550.000. r-
A t'f.la' 1. 4.. ..... .... . , r . - ...
GUSHER hus just come in with a reported production of 3.000 bar
rels d.fily It ib reported thai the 5 acre tracr mi which it is located
sold for 5800,000.00. This gives you some idea of the ENORMOUS
VALUE of our lease. - We feel absolutely certain that every well
drilled on this great Property will come in at from 2,000 barrels to
3.000 barrels daily production.
FIRST WELL ALREADY DRILLING
Our first well is now drilling below 500 feet on this Property.
We paid $20,000 cash for a rotary drilling outfit to develop these
Properties. Our derrick was quickly erected, our tools moved in and
actual drilling started without delay. We installed an electric light
ing system to facilitate diiling at night. We have our owu bunk
houses and commissary so that our men can stay right on the ground
and lose no time. We expect to complete this first well in 20 day.
ENORMOUS PROFITS FROM THIS PROPERTY
Figure for yourself what our daily earnings will be when we have
completed five big 3.000 barrel producers on this tract. Bear in mind
that this oil is worth $2.50 per barrell. Also what will this one Prop
erty then be worth. Now you understand WHY" we have advised you
to immediately purchase all the stock you can afford while you can
get it at our SPECIAL OPENING PRICE of 5 cents per share. You
will be able to see WHY this stock is certain to soon advance tremand
ously in value.
OUR PROPERTY IN BLOCK 45
We own 10 acres in Block 45. This Property is located approxi
mately, 950 feet west of Mason's Big Three well 400 feet south of
the Majestic well 550 feet southwest of the TexaB Girl well 300
feet west o the Fortyfour Oil Company well 700 feet north of the
Cashin well 950 feet northeast of the Clover Leaf Oil Company well
and many other wells which are rapidly starting.
OTHER PROPERTIES IN THIS POOL
We own 20 acres in Section 29 and 60. acres in Section 16. These
two Properties are across the river in Tillman County, Oklahoma,
and are right in line with the big Burk-Waggoner and the Texas-Chief
Gushers. The big companies and the men who have made the Bnrk
burnett and the Northwest Burkburnett Pools famous have secured
leases surrounding our 20-acre and 60-acre leases and are now spending
enormous sums of money there in drilling operations. Several wells
? are now drilling around these Properties.
WE OWN LEASES IN OTHER FIELDS
la addition to our leases in Eastland, Wichita, Comanche, and
Posque Counties, we own leases in Erath, Hamilton, McCulloch,
Coleman, Montague and Baylor Counties. It is our policy to go into
the most promising fields and select a good lease near a drilling well.
In this manner we get leases that offer a tremendous opportunity
for profit. Leases bought near these wells can be had for $25 to $75
per acre, and in a few weeks may be easily worth $500 or even $1,000
per acre.

daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Treu,
a talented young woman, an excel
lent musician and worthy of the many
good wishes which will be extended
by a host of friends. Mr. Ayres is
a well known young business man of

More Concert Tickets
Because of the demand for season
tickets at the series of concerts spon
sored by the Musical Events club, the
number available has been raised from
400 to 450. The seats are limited be
cause they are located only on the
floor and the two first rows in the
balcony. The number of subscribers
has made the increase necessary and
the ciub is much gratified to know
that the music lovers are planning to
enjoy the programes rather than en
loying nothing but a season of regret.
There will be single tickets on sale
for the concerts, as 300 balcony seats
have teen reserved for the purpose.
. The dates of the concerts have been
fixed for November 28, February 2,
March 5, April 1 and April 12. It is
possible that a Schumann-Heink pro

February, the date dependent upon
the bookings of the artist.

RED CROSS NOTES
More than 400 fraternal organiza
tions organizations, labor unions, wo
men's clubs, churches, and other so
cieties and associations, have already
named committees to cooperate with
their local chapters of the American
Red Cross in connection with the No
vember drive for members and funds,
according to responses received at
Pacific Division headquarters. The
officers of the-division are confident
that inauguration of the drive will
see probably 2000 or more of these
committees, in cities and towns
throughout California, Nevada and
Arizona, working hand in hand with
the local chapters to make the cam
paign a success.
From Reuben L. George, 435 South
Second street, San Jose, Cal., who re
turned recently from overseas service
as a corporal in the American army
the Pacific division of the American
Red Cross has received a request to
assist him in recovering a lost slip of
paper which is of considerable impor
tance to the returned fighter. It con
tains his service record and also
shows that he is entitled to a silver
star under an order signed by Colonel
Graber. George received his dis
charge August 12.
Home service work by the American
Red Ccsss in Italy will continue until
at least late autumn, largely because
of the assistance that can be rendered
in the distribution of allotments and
insurance to Italian dependents of
American soldiers. Twenty- thousand
allotment checks from Italian-American
soldiers are received every
month in Italy, the great number of
which go to remote districts and very
poor and uninformed families in the
little towns of Calabria, Sicily, Basili
cata, making the work of home serv
ice of vital importance.
In one locality in the Russian Cau
casus a death rate of 200 has occurred
daily in a refugee population of 60,-
000, according to a letter received
from Miss Blanch? Know, an Ameri
can Red Cross nurse serving in Ar
menia and Syria. Desolation and
misery are widespread, she writes;
starvation and disease have made ter
rible inroads upon the ranks of the
refugees. Conditions are improving,
however, according to Miss Know. An
orphanage sheltering 700 children and
a new hospital, in which 67 children
are being treated, are in operation.
Three carloads of sweaters made
by chapter members of the American
Red Cross arrived recently at Warsaw
or distribution among the destitute
people of Poland in the region east
of the river Bug. The sweaters were
the devastated country, representing
a value of $ 1,000,000.
Typhus and hunger were prevalent
in the district before the coming of
the Red Cross.

Red Cross assisted 392,789 families of

IRK SCHEDULE
FOR AMERICAN
LEGION ISSUED
By CAPT. KENT A. HUNTER.
A working schedule for the state
posts' of the American legion, aimeu
to bring about betterment of condi
tions for service men, has been re
ceived by Earl Searcy, state secre
tary, from the National Council or
the legion in New York.
A committee composed of Charles
H. Brent of Washington, Thomas W
Miller and Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.,
has been appointed by the nations,
council to draft legislation benefic;:.
to soldiers, which will be indorsed
later by the local and state organiza
tions and then taken before congress
with the full influence of the entire
national organization back of it.
Posts Asked for Ideas.
Local and state posts with ideas
on what should be included in the
legislative program should send the-
suggestions to the committee in care
of the national council in New Yor&.
One of the things that the legion
is bound to get at the bottom of is
the investigation of wrongs inflicted
upon officers and men of the A. - E.
F., now under survey by a congres
sional committee.
Another demand of the legion will
be for full and stringent enforce
ment of the espionage act. and sum
mary punishment of all men ol
doubtful loyalty. Opposition to the
election of any man to public office
whose loyalty is at all doubtful will
be a watchword of the veterans from
now on.
Ask Low Fares.
Application to the federal railroad
administration; to grant one cent mile
age all over the country to delegates
to and from the Legion National con
ference in Minneapolis, Nov. 10, 11
and 12 will be made in the next wee
or so. - -
Ministers and clergyment are to be
asked to make Sunday, Nov. ,
American Legion Sunday, and to basu
their sermons on that day on the
ideals for which the legion stands.
Copies of the resolution asking this,
together with the constitution of tire
legion, are to be sent to every clergy
man in the country.
Invitation to the Canadian veterans
to send delegations to the national
convention, and to the French gov
ernment, through the state depart
ment, to have Marshal Foclj come
ps the legion's guest, are also to- be
sent. In connection with the o:
ganization of new posts, a resolution
asking the secretary of war to allo
rifles and blank ammunition to th
legion for guards of honor was also
passed.
Col. Milton J. Foreman of Chicago
i3 the head of a commisTson of sever.

The weekly . resufe of recruiting
for the legion in Illinois shows that
there are ninety-one state posts,
with eighteen of them in Chicago.
A survey of the various cities of
he stte. by the posts of the legion
in them, is to be made to get a l:si
of employers who have failed to
'ivn ca-e of their ex-service men,
and to boycott them, as far as the
legion is concerned, regardless rt
'hother the complaints come from
legion members or other ex service
men. Excessive instances or the in
crease of the high cost of living ana
iailure of employers to recognize it
by reasonable wage increases are to
be tabulated and will be made public.

Further, the judgment bars all other
creditors from claiming any interest
The value of the gold, silver, cop
per, lead and zinc mined in Arizona in
191S was f 202.134.8S0, the greater part
of which was for copper, according to
V. C. Heikes, of the United States Geo
logical Survey Department of the In
terior in considering midyear condi-
superior court tions. Arizona continued to be the
; largest producer of copper In the Unit
ed States and will probably maintain
its position in 1919 but with a greatly
reduced output during the forst six
months, when curtailment of produc
tion has followed the reduction in the
prices of metal.
The output of golff In Arizona in
191 S was 262,919.43 ounces valued at

The revealing of the fact that the
Copper Queen hospital started its ca

ages as Dr. Darling and Miss Jane
Delano is an interesting bit of his
tory, and speaks well for the calibre
of people. selected by the company in
the early days.
The recent death of Miss Delano
was a great loss to the Red Cross,
for it fell .upon her to supervise the
entire Red Cross nursing .work in
France and the allied countries. She
left Bisbee in 1891 to become head
of the training school at the Belle
vue hospital, and since 1905 has been
associated with the American Red
Cross. Miss Delano has attained
more prominence in the nursing

claim of the rlaintiffs, based upon I, T . ,
notes given by the Narragansett Cop
per company, and the Narragansett
Mines company for $300,000 backed by
the entire property as collateral, was
decreed paramount.
It is understood that Langworthy
deceived a settlement of $7,500 of his
$15,500 claim for the property in his
suit against the Narragansett Mines
company from the Steinfield company.
For this he gave a deed to the prop
erty which was placed in escrow, to
gether with a deed from the Stein
field company to Langworthy cover
ing the Dunbar claims. ' I
On the payment of $8,000 further by
the Steinfeld company, the escrow is
to be broken, it is understood, and the
Albert Steinfeld company receives
both deeds and full uncontested title.
In the event of the failure to make
the second payment, the Albert Stein
feld company turns over both deeds
to Langworthy, who- is then in full
possession of the property without
further litigation.
It is presumed other creditors of
the Narragansett Mines company have
been protected in their claims by the
Albert Steinfeld company.
The judgment specifically is for
$300,000 on notes with interest at 6
per cent from February, 1917, and $30,
000, or ten per cent of the amount, for
stipulated attorney's fees, and interest
at 6 per cent and costs fixed at $33.40.
Mining Notes
Out of 15,000 claims adjusted in
the past six years, the Copper Queen
has had but two law suits, and both
of these were settled by the court
in favor of the company.
Miami, Inspiration and the Old
Dominion have a combined first aid

tist and a school bacteriologist, thus
making one of tbe most complete

Most of the silver produced in Ari
zona is derived from copper ores and
lead ores. The total output of silver
in 1918 was 6,C8fi 152 ounces, valued at
SI an ounce. Mines in Yavapai and
Cochise counties produced the greater
nart of it. In 1919 there will probably
be a'decreaes in output corresponding
to the reduction in the output of cop
per. With the increase in the price
of silver, some of the old silver mines
in Yavapai county will become pro
ducers, and the new mill that treats
the silver ores of the Hackberry prop
erty, in Mohave countv, will probably
add to the output of silver in 1919.
The "production of copper i Arizona
was 764 885,874 pounds in 1918. against
712.166.891 pounds in 1917. The mar
ket for copper in the first part of 1919
was decidedly poor, and the price de-J
creased from an average of 24.70 cents
ner pound in 1918 to about 16 cents in
March. 1918. Much copper In ingots
was piled in nearly all the smelter
yards awaiting shipment, and only
the greatly reduced current production
was sent to the eastern refiners. Sev

at the rate of about 60 per cent of
their output in 1918. The monthly pro
duction of the Inspiration and Miami
companies was close to that of the
previous year, but the Rav Consolidat
ed was making about half it3 former
output. There was a geenral scarcity
of miners and mechanics, and even
the return of the troops failed to met
the demand: but the curtailment has
permitted mine development and re
pair and reconstruction of furnaces

An address by Dr. Thomas Darling

brought to light the fact that two
persons, who have since attained
world fame, were associated with the
Copper Queen hospital at Bisbee in
the early days when the hospital wab
first established.
In his address. Dr. Darlington, who
was surgeon for the Copper Queen in
1887. stated:
"I do not know of any company
I'd like to pay tribute to more than

MINE ACT T
AT SILVER BELL
IS ON INCREASE
TUCSON, ' Aug. 23 Dr. Lincoln
Rogers, with offices at 133- North
Stone avenue, returned Monday from
a visit of several days at Silverbell,
where he was the houseguest of
Percy Williams, head of the El Tiro
and other mines. Dr. Rogers, who
was formerly company physician for
the A. S. & R. Co. at Silverbell,
states that the camp is looking up
wonderfully, both the A. S. & R. and
the El Tiro taking on a general in
crease of workers. The El Tiro
Leasing Co. will ship 20 cars of cop
per ore during the present month to
the smelter at Hayden and it is ex
pected that shipments will increase
at the rate of five cars monthly.
Prospects for a revival of old-time
activity in the camp are good with
the rising scale of copper.
Edward G. Thornton, for several
years superintendent -of the A. S. &
R. interests at Silverbell, is ini
charge of the company's properties '
there, having recently returned from!
a vacation on the coast where his
family is located for the summer.
Willis Buehman, for a number of
years in charge of the company store
at the mining camp, the stock of
which he moved to Tucson to dis
pose of in January of this year, has
returned to Silverbell to locate.
