"Wobbly" Delegation Refusedj
Request for Martial Law in;
Bisbee Admit Strikers
Were Beyond Control
(Specie to the Review.)
PHOEXIX. Aug. -. rred H. Moore,
I. W. W. attorney, accompanied
by Ben Webb and Richard Den
ning, two of the men deported
"from Bisbee July 12. called on Gover
nor Campbell this afternoon and after
discussing the event which culminated
In the deportation of the "Wobblies"
to Columbus, asked the governor to de
mand from President Wilson the estab
lishment of martial law in the Bisbee
Warren district. In reply Governor
Campbell said he did not feel that he
had used all the state means at his
disposal and that he would not feel war
ranted in asking for troops until he
had don,e so. At bis direction, he stat
ed. Attorney General Wytley Jones j
would proceed to Bisbee tomorrow
night under orders to make a com
plete and exhaustive investigation.
Webb, who is member of I. W. W.
executive committee which was in
charge of the Bisbee strike, told Gov
ernor Campbell that of the men at
Columbjis 60 per cent were I. W. W.'s, j
30 per cent A. F. of L. and 10- per cent
sympathizers, who did not belong to
either organization. He said he had
been a resident of Bisbee for two
years and an I .W. W..fgr five months.
He said he owned no property In the
district and did not believe in owning
property in the mining camp. He de
clared he had not been working for a
month before the strike was called.
Webb, in reply to the governor's ques
tions, said the Western Federation of
Miners' local at Bisbee was very weak
when the I. W. W. began organizing
and that men naturally joined the
stronger organization. He would not
say the union local had been absorbed
by the I. W. W.
Both men recited incidents of the
deportation and brought out the fact
that every man who was not working
was known and his address had been
secured. The governor particularly in
quired of Webb what caused the sud
den change of front at Bisbee, where
the strike was apparently proceeding
peaceably, and asked if it was not due
to a statement on the part of Enibree,
one of the strike leaders, that he would
not be responsible for what bis men
might do? Webb admitted that Em
bree had told the sheriff that his men
were not in a temper to be longer er
strained and said the sheriff had re
plied, "If you can't restrain them, I
can."

plight of the men there had caused

GERMANS PLACE 38
DECK AND THEN
TORPEDOED
SHIP
A BRITISH PORT, Aug. 3. Thirty
eight members of the crew of the
steamship Belgian Prince were drown
ed in a most deliberate manner by the
German submarine which sank her, ac
cording to the account given, by sur
vivors of that Brltinh vessel, who have
reached British shores. The chief en
gineer of the steamer, who many times
after the steamer was torpedoed was
perilously near drowning, gave the fol
lowing narrative of his experiences:
"About 8 o'clock on Tuesday evening
when we were 200 miles off land I
saw the wake of an approaching tor
pedo. The vessel gave a lurch as she
was hit and I was thrown to the deck
among the debris. The vessel listed
heavily and all of us took to the boats.
"The submarine approached and
withdrawn from bond except those
nsed for industrial purposes, in
creasing the tax on distilled bev
erages to $3.20 per gallon as com
pared with the present rate of
$1.10. The committee's prohibi
tory tax on grain, molasses and
other ingredients of whisky to
stop further manufacture also is
retained.
Beer would be taxed $3 per bar
rel, double the present rate.
Wines would bear virtually treble
their present taxes. The house
levy was only $6,000,000 onwines.
To Tax Ail Checks
The $5,000,000 increase on war
excess profits was added by minor
changes in the schedule of such
taxes providing for a total revenue
Of $528,000,000. The $2,000,000
additional from bank checks would
make $10,000,000 in all from that
source. The committee originally
planned to tax only checks of $5
or more, but decided today to ex
tend the one-cent rate to all
checks.
The new floor or stock taxes on
sugar, coffee, tea and cocoa, at
the same rates proposed in the
new consumption taxes, are levied
only on wholesalers and retailers
having large accumulations of
supplies. ,

not guilty and was held for trial in
$1,000 bail.- The grand jury decided
there was a lack of interest shown in
the discovery of the crime by the
fourth branch of the bureau and that
there has been a senseless and cruel
rule on the- part of the police depart

GREATEST WEAPON OF

Flanders -Offensive Is De
scribed as Mightiest Impact
Which the World Has Ever
Seen in War.
(Bv Review Leased Wire!
BERLIN, Aug. 3. Special dispatches
from the front in the Berlin newspa
pers agree in describing the battle in
Flanders as a struggle for the sub
marine bases in Belgium, as well as in
characterizing it as the most stupen
dous combat of the war.
'The great, bruital force of the ini
tial blow has been parried," writes the
Tageblatt's correspondent, regarding
the Flanders battle. "The mainspring
which impelled the German fighting
on was the strong realization that he
was then called upon to defend the
German U-boat as the mightiest wea
pon of his country and bar the path
to its. base with his life. The German
troops counter attacked in frightful
bayonet and hand-grenade combats. It
was the mightiest counter thrust, fol-.
lowing the mightiest impact, which the
world has ever seen.
"Nightfall witnessed the happy Ger
man achievement. The foe had won
German trenches, had gained control
of Bixschoote and had carried off pris

RUSSIAN CABINET
MEMBERS RESIGN
(Continued From Page One)
the Associated Press that some of the
documents supposed to incriminate M.
Tchernoff already had been examin
ed. He considers the charges against
the minister of agriculture as not be
ing grave but the cabinet has accpet-
ed his resignation provisionally.
M. Tchernoff has ' been one of the
central figures in the present cabinet
troubles in Russia. ' Negotiations for
the reconstruction of the cabinet have
been in progress for several weeks.
One of the conditions, raised by the
constitutional democrats, whose pres
ence In the cabinet was desired was
that M. Tchernoff should resign. .'On
July 28 a dispatch from Petrograd re
ported that Premier Kerensky has re
solved to sacrifice neither M. Tcher
noff nor M. Terestchenko, the foreign
minister who also is opposed by the
constitutional democrats.
M. Tchernoff is a member of the
executive committee of the council
of peasant's delegates and is an advo
cate of land mobilization.
General Erdelli Killed.
PETROGRAD, August 3.-General
Erdelli, military governor of Petro
grade. says the Bourse Gazette, has
been killed. He was treacherously
shot in the back. '
General Erdelli, a dispatch from
Petrograd, . July 25, announced had
been appointed military governor of
Potrograd in succession to General
PoIovtsff, who had resigned after
failing to put down rioting in the Rus
sian capital. General Erdelli had been
commander of the Eleventh.
General Guiko Arrested.

that he had been connected with the
general staff of the Germans, M.
Tchernoff, resigned as socialist minis
ter of agriculture. Efforts to strength
en the Russian cabinet by the inclu
sion of constitutional democrats seem
ingly have failed and Premier Kerens-
ky will attempt to rule the country
with the aid of the socialist and radi
cal parties. '
General Erdelli, recently appointed
military governor of Petrograd, is re
ported to have been assassinated.
Still In Retreat -Between
the Dniester and the Prutli
the Russians have not halted in their
retreat toward the border. Bukowina
is almost entirely in the hands of the
Teutons again. Czernowitz, the cap
ital, has been occupied by the Ger
mans and Kimpolung, an important
town several miles south of the Rus
sian border, has been evacuated by
the Russians. The German advance in
Gallcia and Bukowina seemingly is
aimed at Kamnetz Podolosky, forty
six miles south of the Dniester and in
the direction of Odessa, Russia's great
port on the Baltic Sea.
Germany Needs Men.
.British Headquarters tn France and
Belgium. August 3. German officers
captured in the battle in Flanders
'lave discussed quite freely both the
military and political situation as it
affects the fatherland. Germany's
loss in man-power they admit to be
serious. .
The interesting ihforamtion ' has
been volunteered by these prisoners
that the entire class of 1918 recruits
now is In the field, and what is more
significant, it is said, small elements
of the 1919 class are already at the
front although it is claimed they are
serving only as volunteers. This"is
the first time any German officer has
admitted that any men of the 1919
;lass were on the battle front.
The whole trend of the statements
made by these captive officers is that
they are beginning to fear they may
lose the war. More depressing than
anything else is the fear that there
may be another winter campaign.
Peace without annexation or indem
nities is endorsed by all the officers
who have discussed the question, but
most of tbem have indicated that they
Tavor the annexation of eastern Bel
gium and a part of the coast of Plan
ters, if such a thing possibly could
be done.
Gas Attack la Success.
Almost without exception the Ger
man officers still maintain that Ger
many is innocent of causing the war
-nd say that there i ."all manner of
documentary evidence to prove it."
Discussing the present battle, the
German officers say that the British
gas shell bombardment on the two
nights preceding the opening of the
infantry charge was most effective
and that the Germans suffered heavi
ly. The Guard Fusileers were gassed
Sunday and Monday night. Large num
bers were overcome.
A German division which was being
held in support on the back line cross-
'ng the Ypres-Menin road also suffer
ed severely. So disastrous was the
effect of the gas at this point that at
east one battalion which was bein
nished to the relief of the men in
'.he front lines, never reached its ob
jective. It is the irony Of fate that it was in
'.his section of the front that the Ger
mans early in the war for the first
irae in history inaugurated the use of
?as shells.

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. August 3. The third
successive session of higher prices
marked today's broader stock market
operations, the short interest evident
ly deeming it advisable to further re
duce committments over the double
holiday.
United States Steel led the list at
an extreme advance of points but
lost part of its advantage on profit
taking in the last hour. The more
striking movements of the session
were scored by higher priced tobacco
shares, American Tobacco making an
extreme advance of 5 to 2124 and
Liggett and Myers 13 to 235. United
Cigars at 119 and Tobbacco Pro
ducts at 67'i established new high
records.
Grangers and low grade railroads
were the most active issues in the
transportation group. Coppers, oils
and motors were dull or moderately
heavy. The mafket closed with a firm
undertone. Total sales amounted to
535,000 shares. -
. An interesting development was the
resumption of gold imports, $6,000,000
being received from Canada for Brit
ish account.
Bonds were irregular with Liberty
3's at the wide range of 99.32 to
99.45. Total sales, (par value), ag
gregated $2,235,000.
United States bonds, (old issues),
were unchanged on call.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, Aug. 3. Chances that
peace developments might assume
some importance during the double
holiday intervening before Monday did
a good deal to overcome in the corn
market today an advance which had
resulted from continued lack of rain
and from temporary scantiness of of
ferings. The close mas unsettled at
the same as yesterday's finish to
cent lower with December 117 to
117 and May 1154 to 115.
Wheat declined 34 cents net. but
in the end held steady at 227,4 Sep
tember. Oats lost to cents. In
provisions there was a rise of 27 to 55
cents.
Wheat eased down as a result in
some, degree of assertions that far
mers in the winter wheat region were
showing more willingness to sell and
that as yet millers were not taking
hold freely. Showers in Canada and
cool weather on the United States
side of the international border, were
construed as indicating a rather more
liopeful outlook for the spring crop.
Oats acted heavy. The market felt
the weight of hedging sales and also
sympathized with the weakness of
corn at the close:
Higher prices on hogs helped to lift
provisions. Meat shipments were lib
eral and Liverpool advices also en
couraged buying.

shares were the early featres of
strength, buying in this type of secur
ities being stimulate! by the publicity
ghee to present un& piospective large
earnings, wl:h the possibilities that
shareholders in stocks like central
leather, hide and leather preferred and
united cigar stores are likely to be
the recipient of larger divided dis
bursements in tbe current year.
The minor rails were also in bet
ter demand, influenced chiefly by the
more favorable exhibit of June earn
ings by most of the re-organized car
riers. Northwestern group . of rails
were also in better demand, especially
St. Paul, where shorts showed a keen
er willingness to cover, probably In
spired by the excellent June statement
of North Pacific, which published to
day showed a net increase of $975,000
in the month mentioned. There were
no developments of great significance
in international situation, although
the news from abroad is being close

the examinations. No matters of ex
emption will be taken up at the exam
cations tomorrow, nothing but the
physical examination being considered.
Method Of Procedure.
The war department rules as to the
procedure to be followed in making
the physical examinations are in part
as follows:
"Every physical examination of ev
?ry person shall be conducted in the
presence of at least one member of
'.he local board other than the medical
member thereof.
"In the making of the physical ex
aminations, 'the physician must be sat
isfied that the person examined is
physically deficient aud not physically
qualified for military service, in order
to relieve the person called for mili
tary sen-ice from military duty.
"If the physician is in doubt upon
this question he is to resolve the
doubt in favor of the physical qualifi
cations of the person for military ser
vice. "A doubt as to physical qualification
of the person examined for military
service means that the person so ex
amined must be held for military ser
vice. "If a person so examined shall be
found by the examining physician phy
sically deficient end not physically
qualified for military service, the
board shall cause him to be re-examined
by another examining physician
designated and appointed by the board
as prescribed in the regulations, and
this other physician shall make the
examination without any reference to
or regard for, the report of the first
examinating physician.
"A member of the board, if practic
able, who was not present at the time
of the first examination, shall be pres
?nt at the re-examination.
"If any person examined physically
shall be held by the originally exam
inking physician to have physical qual
ifications for military service, the
board shall thereupon hold such per
son for military. service.
Physican's .Final Report.
"The local board, whereupon the
first physical examination the person
examined is found to be physically
qualified, must adopt the report of the
examining physician and cannot de
cide contrary to such reporL
"If a person has been physically re
examined as hereinbefore stated, and
if the examining physician making the
re-examination shall have found the
person examined physically qualified
for military service, the board shall
hold him physically capable for mill
tary service. .
"If both examining physicians shall
have found the' person so examined
physically deficient and the board
shall concur in such findings, he shail
te discharged from the draft and a
certificate setting for the condition of
men discharge shall be issued to him
'n accordance with the regulations."

' LABOR'S WICKED PARTNERS
The labor movemeat in this- country is loyal to the
government," declared Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation, following the big meeting held in
New York recently to cleanse the federation of Prussian
agents and local agitators. He declared further that it
was the duty of all true friends of labor to "Americanize
that part of the labor movement not yet Americanized
and to combat those who would prostitute the cause of
labor for the benefit of the foes of the United States
and of labor."
These are strong words and they are straight to tho
point. They are a terrible arraignment of the I. W. W.
agitators in the west and of certain members and leaders
of the American Federation In many western states, in
cluding Arizona.
The New York meeting above referred to, and the
policy it adopted, aroused the interest of thinkers and
patriots and economists all over the country. Referring
to it Theodore Roosevelt declared that it was just as nec
essary that this country be made safe for all workers
as it was that the world should be made safe for De
mocracy. "I hold with the utmost intensity of convic
tion," declared the ex-president, "that it is utterly Im
possible for us to succeed along the lines of an orderly
democracy, a democracy that shall be industrial as well
as political, unless we treat the repression of these crimes
of violence as a prime necessity."
Both Colonel Roosevelt and Mr. Gompers had dis
tinctly in mind that un-American and unfair and unjust
custom of a certain element of labor that would forbid
and estop others from working at a wage and at a work
that suits them.
The Arizona mine strikes are glaring examples of this
very crime. With the nation at war it is nothing'more or
less than treason. It has been so branded in the highest
Union Labor circles in the land, tl is so regarded by
statesmen and patriots everywhere regardless of party,
position or prejudice.
The New York Times, In commenting upon the Fed
eration meeting, declared: "It is good to see the Federa
tion struggling with jts wicked partners, and Mr. Gom
pers' hands will be upheld therein. The alternative is
either to protect the humble workers or to compel the
work of organized labor as well as organized capital."
The L V. W. agents, big and little, have openly and
brazenly proclaimed to the nation at large that they
plotted and conspired to take advantage of the war and
bring on strikes everywhere possible.' That their act
are an indirect aid to Germany they care not the least,
and publicly say so. Federation officials in Arizona have
been working with and for the I. W. W. In the person of
J. L. Donelly, state president, they have been pernicious
in their activities in behalf of the- very class that the
national federation has organized to drive from its ranks.
That the national federation has decided to clean
house in time of war and declare, for the period of the
war, a new and more patriotic procedure in -case of dif
ferences with employers, will be welcomed by all good
citizens in the mining districts of the west with gratitude
and joy. It cannot begin too soon, when one considers
the Arizona situation.
All that country north of us from the Rockies to
the Atlantic seaboard is in the grip of a heat wave. It
was 106 in Kansas yesterday: In Chicago heat prostra
tions are reported by the score, and by the hundred in
New York. Many of these have resulted fatally. But
down here in Old Arizona, within sight 'of the Mexican
border, with , the desert all around us, the mountain
breezes temper the sun's rays, and from this admixture
we receive from the Master Chemist's retort an air as
mild and fine as heart could desire. People up north
have the foolih habit of referring to Arizona generally
as "the hottest 'place on earth." But when they swelter
and suffocate and die in the midst of the ravages of a
heat wave we wear our coats in Bisbee by day and reach
for mere cover at night and go serenely and comfortably
about our mirth and employments during the dreadod
"dog days" of the north.
Does Coahise county want the Evergreen Highway
to traverse her valleys and cross her plateaus and brill;
her progress and Industry to the eyes of thousands of
travelers every year? She does. And she will have it.
too, if public spirit can bring this desired thing about.-
HOW DO THEY DO IT?
Strikers at Globe and Miami impetuously and indig
nantly refused, at a mass meeting held Thursday night,
to consider any concession or mediation that involved
their return to work. They even refused, at first, to al
low Federal Mediator McBride and ex-Gov. Hunt, the
president's mediator," to address them setting forth terms
of conciliation. But finally they were persuaded to listen
before spurning these advances.
Why work, when you can live without work? These
Globe and Miami strikers seem to have solved a problem
that has vexed the soul of the editor of the Review ever
since he was a boy of fourteen. Always the Review edi
tor has had to work. He had no choice in the matter; it
was either work or starve, or work or beg. Summer and
winter, in season and out of season, he has had to work'.
To miss a week's pay out of a month meant that he would
have to stand off the landlord or the grocer at the end
of that month. To miss a month's pay would mean bank
ruptcy and ruin. Even when he belonged to the printers'
union he had to work.
But the men enrolled nnder the banner of the Inter
national Workers of the World don't have to work. Why
they chose that word "Workers" as a part of their or
ganization's title will always remain a mystery to many
people. They toil not, neither do they spin, but the wild
bull of Bashan cannot roar so loud as one of these.
The L W. W. leaders claim to be poor men as well
as friends of the poor; thy claim to be free from the
taint of graft; they claim there is no money in their
treasury except a poor man's mite or two gathered to pay
postage and traveling expenses and a fourth class hotel
bill or two.
And yet they can come along and talk a man with
a family into throwing down his pick and walking out
of a mine with all the caseless nonchalance of one who
had money out at interest. And he will stay out for a
month and then indignantly spurn any offer of a pitiful
little old five dollar a day job.
How do they do it? Who feeds the family? Who
pays the rent? Who buys the clothes and the shoes and
the tobacco? Where do the strike funds come from?
Who pays for the meals the leaders must eat in order
to be able to talk so loud and so long?
The man that will give up a pay check on the strength
of a stranger's glittering words of promise surely must be
a lover of sweet sounds and beautiful dreams. Do these
leaders give these men a hypodermic every day? Are
they smuggling opium into these mountains? How do
they do it?
After losing four or six weeks' work, which means
$150 to $200 ip good gold coin, then what? Is there any
possible reward? There is not. All ther can do is to
move on, like the loafers on a park bench do when the
cop comes and taps their shoe soles with his club.
How do they but wait a minute! A sneaking sus
picion has just occurred to the simple-minded editor man.
MAYBE THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK!
"ALL SHOT UP"
Col. Percy A. Guthrie, recruiting officer for the Mac
Lean clan of the Kilties, is a fine figure of a man. The
New York newspaper men who have met him bow down
and worship at his shrine. And well they may, for not
since Sir John Chandos, the famous captain of the Hun
dred Years' War, has England, Scotland or Wales sent
forth such a fighting man. CoL Guthrie has been wqund
ed twenty-two times and he is going back for more.
At the beginning of the first battle of Ypres in 1911
CoL Guthrie was the junior lieutenant. When the battle
was over he found himself in command of the regiment
that is to say, what was left of the regiment. They
went in with 1,063 men and came out with 183. Only
four out of thirty-oire officers were left alive.
At the battle of Feetubert, some months later, an
exploding shell did many things to Col. Guthrie. He was
placed on board a hospital ship bound for England. The
Bosches, as is their happy and pleasant little custom,
torpedoed the hospital ship. A soldier threw Col. Guthrie
into the water as the only chance to save his life. - He
was a man of brass and iron and he survived. Five
months in the hospital and he was out ready for more.
His leg and foot are made of steel; his arms are mis
shapen from shrapnel wounds and splintered bones; his
hip has been broken in five places, and his body is posi
tively pocked with scars.
What a man! Those Scotch crags and heather
scented valleys breed a race of heroes. The spirit of
William Wallace lives again in this Scot. German shells
broke his body into bits but only the Lord on High can
break his spirit! And that is why the armies of the
British Isles are better than the Prussian armies today;
that is why they beat them man for man they have the
higher, finer, stronger spirit. It is .not the physical
Btrength that wins in a deadlock, it is always the heart
and soul of the fighter that carries him on to victory
when his body has done its best and failed.

James P. Boylej Prominent At'
torney of Douglas, Tells of
Interest in I. W. W. Move
ment Found Through Min
nesota.
Mr. Slacker, when you go to Tombstone next week
to be examined for service in the new national army, don't
try to play any imaginary ailments or defects upon the
examining board. If y,pu do, you'll be sorry. Scienc e has
made mighty steps in recent years, and medieal science
has kept pace with her mother. There are a score of
ways now devised to catch the slacker who affects physi
cal disability to escape service, each one more effective
than the other. Armed with the new process devised for
this particular occasion, you'll find the examiners to bo
as keen and eftective as Sherlock Holmes in unmasking
you.
After cursing Gov. Campbell with unction and fervor
ever since he came into the public eye, the 1. W. W. are
now using his ante-rooms for a state headquarters. Funny
what a difference just a few months make.
I. W. W.'ism is no more popular in
other parts of the country than in Co
chise county, and a concerted effort to
oppose the attempts of the "rough
neck wobblies" to gain control of the
nation's industrial affairs is visible
all over the west and northwest, .ac
cording to James P. Boyle, prominent
Douglas attorney, who has just re
turned from a month's visit in Minne
sota. "The Bisbee deportation was one of
the chief subjects of conversation In
the Lake Superior region," said Mr.
Boyle.
"Through that region people were
being inspired to form Loyalty leag
ues and prepare to see that the iron
and copper mines run, regardless of
any man or set of men who might op
pose their operation.
"Everyone in that 'section was talk
ing about the history-making episode
at Bisbee. On trains and elsewhere I
heard some men remark that the peo
ple had taken the law in their own
hands, but the invariable reply was
that the I. W. W. never invoke the
law and the Bisbee people simply adop
ted the methods of the men they were
fighting and 'beat them to iC Two
questions were asked everywhere.
They were how the deportation had
been accomplished with so little dis
order, and who took part In deporting
the I. W. W.; how large a per cent of
the labor element helped in the move
ment? "My observation leads me to believe
that there is a sentiment, stronger than
ever before, that the country cannot
afford to let the harvesting of its crops
be interfered with, while anything that
would check the country's industries
would not be tolerated.
"I was on a train going through Kan
sas when papers carrying an Associat
ed Press dispatch crediting the I. W.
W. headquarters in Chicago with the
tnreat to burn the growing crops, were
brought aboard. I heard a group of
several Kansas farmers talking and
from them I gathered that they would
allow no interference with their crops;
would protect them with their lives, if
necessary.
"The general opinion appears to be
that the I. W. W. have gainea a wrong
impression of their strength. The at
titute of the peace-loving public which
has allowed them to operate without
any great hindrance has led them to
think they are in the niajority instead
of being about 15 per cent of the peo
ple, who will be driven into the At
lantic and Pacific ocean if they do not
let the country alone to fight this war.
"Bill Haywood's threat that 250.000
men will strike of the Bisbee deporters
are not returned thene, is not being
taken seriously. No one believed he
would be able to call out any such
number. At the same time his threat
ening the president is being resentea.
"In some states efforts are being
made to legalize citizens taking care
of their own difficulties. The argu
ment used in favor of this is that the
militia is being federalized and trained
and soon will be sent to France leav
ing their home states unprotected
against lawlessness organized on a
Urge scale. ,
"The state legislature of Minnesota
has created a safety committee which
was given almost plenary powers. One
of the committee's first acts was to
order that all saloons In the state close
at 10 o'clock each night. The commit
tee men have gone over the state in
specting, conditions, and entered many
orders. The constitutionality of the
formation of the committee was at
tacked recently, but 'was upheld by
the superior court in Minnesota.
"In Michigan, the citizens are organ
izing on a tremendous scale to take
care of just sueh troubles as Arizona
uow is facing. I have heard men who
had been in Michigan and were care
ful observers, say that no set of men
would be allowed to affect that state's
industries. They would be sent out as
fast as they came in.
"Reputable labor unions all over tlie
country seem to be standing behind
toe president; so much so, in fact, that
they have been denounced publicly by
Haywood and his followers. The sen
timent springing up in the minds of
all intelligent men is the same that
sprang up in England following the
very effective speeches of Lloyd
j George. The disputes of labor and
capital must be laid aside until me
war Is won. Capital must not be per
; -.itted undue profits out of the war.
The officers of the American Federa
tion of Labor, the railroad brother
hoods and other great organizations.
! are working with the government and
I not countenancing such trouble as has
j been created by the I. W. W. from
! Butte to the Mexican border, here in
' the west.
"Everyobdy, every place, is market
gardening. In the iron range, great
tracts of land were plowed up by the
municipalities and the people permit
ted to plant them. The people every
where are backing tho administration.
When the president says plant,' they
plant, and when he says 'get reauy tor
the draft' they get ready. This is true
of men and women of all classes.

RAMPANT RUMOR IS
FINDING BUT LITTLE
CAPITAL IN BISBEE
More Americans Continue to
Come Into Warren District
and Enetr Its Mines Many
Rumors Nailed to Cross.
Continued care in the selection of
men to be given rustling cards in the
Warren District is being exercised by
the Workmen's Loyalty League and
the number of newcomers is increas
ing daily. That increase is being feu
in the mines which are gradually rais
ing their working forces to normal.
Rustling cards are not easy to get.
A considerable premium is being plac
ed upon them. In the first place, un
adulterated Americanism is a prime
requisite with good character and a
clear' records close second in import
ance. It is this class of American
workmen who are receiving the O. K.
of the committee and who are being
added to the working forces of the
several operators in the Warren Dis
trict. Many Rumors Extant.
Rumors continue to invade Bisbee
from the cyitside and leak out from
the inside. Both kinds are equally in
sidious and with as little fact on
which to predicate their truthfulness.
For instance:
It was circulated that a decrease in
wages of one dollar per day was put
into effect here. This rumor is said
to have originated at Columbus, New
Mexico, among various and sundry ex
residents of the Warren District. To
deny R would be giving such class of
intelligence undue credit.
Other forms of rumor, however, ar
more likely to take root: especially
those directed at the individual activi
ties of local men.
Mayor Jake Erickson, for instance,
received a letter from a man by the
name of Fred Penna, whose present
address is Columbus, New Mexico, pro
testing against the alleged action of
Hogan and Seed, whom, the man stat
ed, were about to evict bis family
from the house occupied.
Where the rumor originated is hard
to determine. The facts, however, are
that no such action was contemplated
and Mrs. Penna denies all of the al
leged facts in the letter. On the con.
trary. she says, has been treated with
the utmost consideration by the real
estate firm.
It is this class of rumor which has
found credence in and out of the War
ren District. It is this class of rumor
which takes easy root and is hard to
locate in its origin. It is this class of
rumor which the Leagues are' anxious
to eradicate and to track to its start
ing place.

AUSTIN', Texas, Aug. 3. Actual in
vestigation of the charges preferred
by Speaker F. O. Fuller, in an at

Ferguson, today was postponed until
10 o'clock Monday morning.
Except that the house, instead of a
small committee, will participate in
the proceedings to be Initiated Mon

the same flavor as the one that severe

nor in March.
Various legislative leaders believe
that the taking of testimony will re
quire two and possibly three weeks. II
the house sustains the charges by a
majority vote the next step would be
the presentment of a bill of impeach
ment to the senate, which would then
condugt a trial. Impeachment could
only follow a two-thirds vote of con
viction by the senate.

POSTAL EMPLOYES
NOT EXEMPT FROM
MILITARY SERVICE
Postmaster General Issues Rul
ing That Only Railway
Mail Clerks Can Claim Ex
emption From Draft
WASHINGTON, Aug. 3 A ruling is
sued today by the postofiice depart
ment officials will make few requests
for the exemption of postal employes
from military service. Postmasters
are instructed not to ask exemption
for carriers or laborers or for clerks
in second class offices below the J 1000
grade, clerks in first class offices below
the $1100 grade .or any above these
grades unless they are qualified dis
tributors of mail.
The ruling is the first formal action
y an executive department in com
pliance with President Wilson's order
directing that department officials in
dicate exemptions and that the require
ment of indispensibility be rigidly en
forced. Railway Clerk Exempt
The entire mail carriers' force, num
bering thousands of men, of whom a
considerable percentage are within the
draft age limits. Is excluded from ex
emption except for physical reasons or
because of dependent families. Every
portion of the county is reached by the
ruling as even the rural carriers are
included.
The department's ruling leaves rail
way mail clerks within the exemption
classes, however', as they are highly
specialized distributors.
Provost Marshal General Crowder
took steps today to reduce the num
ber of exemptions because of depend
ent families. Instructions were sent
to the governors of all states pointing
out that the minimum pay of soldiers
is now- $30 a month and that local
boards must consider whether a man's
dependents could not be supported on
that amount.
The telegram says:
Crowder Telegram
"Please call attention of local boards
to the fact a soldier's pay is not less
than $30 a month and that all clothing,
subsistence, medical treatment and
housing are furnished him. Under the
law he may allot any portion of his
pay to a dependent Many soldiers re
ceiving $30 a month are easily able to
allot $25 monthly to the support of de
pendents. In case of death in line of
duty the government will pay to the
beneficiary designated by the soldier
six months' pay."
General Crowder has suggested to
the governors that each assemble the
full membership of all district boards
in his state for a general conference
to insure uniform procedure regarding
appeals. The governors were asked
also to appoint an official in each local
district to file appeals. County attor
neys were suggested.
FORMER MINISTER
TO URUGUAY SHOT
BY DIVORCED WIFE
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YOIK, Aug. 3. John De Saul
les, former United States minister to
Uruguay, was shot and killed at his
home at Rosslyn, L. L, late tonight
by his divorced wife, who was Miss
Blanquitta Errazuriz of . Santiago,
Chile.
Mrs. de Saulles fired four shots from
a pistol into Mr. de Saulles' back.
The' shooting was the result of a
quarrel over the custody of their four-year-old
son.
Mrs. de Saulles was arrested and
arraigned before Justice. Walter R.
Jones at Hempstead, L. I., charged
with murder.
Mr. de Saulles, famous Yale quarter
back, met his wife, who is a niece of
a former president of Chile, when he
went to that country in 1910 to pro
mote railroad enterprises for the South
American Concession company, which
built the trans-Andean railroad. They
were married in Paris in 1911.
Mr. de Saulles organized the Wood
row Wilson College Men's league in
1912 and the following year was 'ap
pointed minister to Uruguay. He
sent his resignation to the state de
partment in June, 1914. Mrs. de Saul
le sbegan her divorce proceedings in
August, last year.
FURTHER TROUGLEROPS

In the Leadville metal mine wage con

Follett, secretary of the Cloud City

William Morrissey, that, in spite of
the recent agreement ending the

Inspector Mitchell of the state labor
department was sent to Leadville to

The metal miners quit work about
two weeks ago, asking an increase of

were supposed to be on shift the morn

"Miners deported from Bisbee voted
unanimously that they were willing to
dig Copper for the United States gov

will take over and operate all copper
mines and smelters in the country."
Several civil 'and military officers
attended the meeting seemingly great

.Government officers here have been
receiving reports for the past two

their freedom from military restric

- Troops Are Asked.
A confectionary owner reported that
several men of the company obtained
soft drinks at his place and refused
to pay, saying they would pay when
Columbus gave them work. A bread
wagon was also raided yesterday and
the contents confiscated.
Efforts have, been made by local
business men to have the New Mexico
national guard guard the town since
the military has removed guards from
the detention camp.
Many of the men sent here from

The finance committee struck
out entirely, said Mr. Kitchin,

which the house had imposed on
the manufacture and sale of auto

Tviiw.i vu ;last Will and Testament of Archie
gaiuzed With 1 rincipal Ob- Dozoys who, said petitioner alleges, is
ject of Raising $1 00,000 1 deceased, and that letters testamen
r:L ll:,-k t Qt.. Jtary issue thereon to said petitioner,
With Which to Start New and that game wiU be heard on Sat.
Afternoon Paper. urday, the ISth day of August, A. D.
1917, at 10:00 o'clock in the forenoon
If certain radical Democrats now
cated, in the majority, in Phoenix, are
successful the capital will have an
other paper. The Wilson Democratic
club, using the president's statement
that a Democrat was a man "who vot
ed the Democratic ticket" bas been
organized and an investigation is now
being carried on to determine whether
or not $100,000 can be raised to start
or buy a newspaper.
The first meeting was held in re-i
sponse to a call, signed by 100 Demo
crats, nearly half of whom attended
the first meeting. The call follows:
"Phoenix, Ariz, July, 1917..
"A Democrat is a man who votes
the Democratic ticket
"WOODROW WILSON."
"We, the undersigned Democrats of
Arizona, having faith in the ability,
integrity and sterling American pa
triotism of our president, Woodrow
Wilson, hereby organjze a Democratic
organization to be known as the Ari
zona Woodrow Wilson league.
"The purpose of this league is to
aid the president in bis stupendous
task that confronts him in this world
war by every means in our power as
American citizens and Democrats, also
to stand with our senators and con
gressmen in the support of our presi
dent in his great work for the pro
tection and maintenance of our In
alienable rights as American citizens,
and for the preservation of the ideals,
the rights, the institutions and the
laws of our country, and to protect
the interests of the Democratic party
in the state of Arizona. To these
principles we hereby subscribe."
H. W. Clark was-named as tem
porary chairman andW. P. Doheney,
temporary secretary. There was a pe
riod of speech making. Chairmaa
Clark, without mentioning any names
said that certain outsiders had enter
ed the party and were doing their
best to disrupt it and suggested their
elimination. :
F. C. Struckmeyer set forth tht
needs of reconstruction and a binding
up of self-inflicted wounds. Judge
Nealon believed that the reconstruc
tion should occur at the primaries.
On the motion of Assistant Attorney
General L. W. Whitney a resolution
was adopted to be transmitted to con
gress setting out tfrw purposes of the
organization. Addresses were made
by A. S. Mills of the Messenger and
others.
Judge Vt. L. Barnum said that it
was easy to talk and resolute but
what was wanted was action. In the
course of his remarks he offered a
resolution which was uproariously re
ceived, directed to the Arizona delega
tion in congress urging them under
pain of defeat to vote for a law max
ing aliens of registration age liable to
military service.
After this the organization was
made permanent by the election by ac
clamation of A. A. Bctts, president,
and W. P. Doheney, secretary. There
was then another resolution directed
against the Gazette. It proposed a
telegram to the secretary of the in
terior setting out that the Gazette was
in receipt of a good deal ofadvertising
fjrom the land office and that it was at
the same time' slipping the knife un
der the fifth rib of the party. The
resolution authorizes the sending or
copies of the Gazette containing ma
lignant articles to the secretary. Af
ter the appointment of a committee
on by-laws, a committee consisting of
John O. Dunbar, A..S. Mills and D. F.
Johnson was appointed to investigate
the business of bringing into the news
paper field of Phoenix another after
noon paper. Their duties will include
the discovery of ways and means ot
raising $100,000 or otherwise secur
ing a newspaper.

MUST HAVE LICENSE
Some of the younger boys about the
Warren District think they don't have
to have a license because they only
hunt rabbits and rabbits are not pro
tected under the law. This Is a mis
take; any one who goes hunting, no
matter what he hunts must have a
license to hunt, not for what he kills
hut for the privilege of hunting. Some
parents will save money by seeln?
that their boys have a license other
wise they are apt to be arrested as
the game wardens have their eyes on
several "kids who hunt rabbits with
out a license."

LIGHTNING HITS
During the heavy rain and electrical
storm which visited Tombstone Wed
nesday night the second within
week", the residence of Mr. and Mrs.
Isaac Tracey on Lower Toughnut was
struck by a bolt of lightning and con
siderable damage done to the roof and
stovepipe. The bolt struck the stove
pipe of the kitchen stove and besides
demolishing the pipe, a large hole was
torn in the roof, allowing the rain to
pour Into the building. That the fam
ily were in the front part of the house
probably accounts for the fact that
none were injured by the bolt.

EPIDEMIC OF INSANITY
There seems to have ben an epi
demic of cases of insaniry throughout
the county during the past few days,
no less than three patients have been
taken to Tombstone and examined.
A colored man was taken to the coun
ty seat from Johnson Camp. A man
named S. A. Jones aged about sixty
years was taken in from CourtlanJ
and a Yaqui Indian taken up from
Douglas. The latter was brought into
Douglas from - Bernardino station
where he bad been working on the
section. He had to be tied down on
a hand car and when taken to the po
lice station ad to be strapped down.
He is very violent.
GLAD HE IS HERE
Depunty Sheriff Red Gannon sta:es
yesterday that he was glad that he
was a resident of Arizona instead of
his old home state of West Virginia.
When asked the reason for this state
ment he referred us to the loiiowm?
item in his old home town paper, the
Piedmont Independent: "Every per
son In West Virginia from 16 to 6')
! years of age must work not less than
I six hours In every day but Sunday or
i f they do not unless under the care of
! a physician, must pay a fine or be Im
prisoned and work on the county roads.
There are sevetul candidates for thU
job' in Piedmont and vi inity. A hint
to the wise Is sufficient, as Governor
Cornwell Is going to svijereiy force
this statute."
Since the navy recruiting office
has . been -opened, fn this city there
have been nearly three hundred appli
cants to Join the navy. Of this num
ber two hundred and Iwenty-one have
been accepted. Twenty some odd re
jected after they had been sent to
El Paso and the balance rejected here
on account of physical disabilities.
These enlistments have come from all
parts of Cochise county but the ma
jority were from the Warren District.
Tombstone and Douglas were quite
well represented.- Of the percentage
of men examined and accepted the
Warren District compares most fav
orable with any part of the United
States. The tabulated statements
show that the Western Division has
the least per centage of men turned
down than any part of the I'nited
States.
