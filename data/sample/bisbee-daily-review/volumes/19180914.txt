NEAR GERMAN BORDER
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN LORRAINE. Sept.
13 (By the Associated Press). Newton D. Baker, the Ameri
can secretary of war, accompanied by Generals Pershing and
Petain, visited St. Mihiel a few hour3 after its recapture. Resi
dents of the town so long under domination of the Germans,
accorded Secretary Baker and his companions a touching re
ception, relating the abuses to which they had been subjected.
Before the German retreat they had forced almost every
male between the ages of 1 6 and 45 to accompany them for
service in the German army, they told the secretary.
The prefect of the town assured Secretary Bakr that had
it not been for the assistance rendered by the American re
lief committee the residents of the place would have suffered
serious privations.
The banks long ago had been broken into and" all the
money and papers removed. The inhabitants of St. Mihiel
had been forced by the Germans to contribute a million francs
to the German war treasury.
Secretary Baker and Generals Pershing and Petain walked
through the streets of the little city, talking to the residents,
who told them long stories of the long months of German oc
cupation. Although the Germans were most open in thei.
outrages immediately prior to their retreat, they had begun
their depredations long ago. Houses had been entered and
robbed and when they marched out of St. Mihiel they carried
away great stores of loot taken from almost every house iij the
place. "t
UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. The Amnin
first army hat carried out the initial task assigned to it the levelling of
the famous St. Mihiel salient in Lorraine. iii
In a little more than twenty-four hours not only had the work ; been Ac
complished but General Pershing's men had all the Important towns, vilTJaes
and strategic positions in the sector within their hands and were stahijig
on the banks of the Moselle river at Pagny, looking across the strearr'ito
German territory. And the southern outer fortifications of Metz, the great
German stronghold in Lorraine, were only four miles distant.
Large numbers of Germans had been taken prisoner more than 12,000
had been counted and others were still on their way back to the prisoners
cages and many guns and machine guns and great quantities of ammuni
tion and other war stores were in American hands.
From Hattonville, on the north, across the salient eeastward to Pagny,
the Americans have closed the mouth of the big sack that extended south
to St. Mihiel, trapping within it by their fast advance all the enemy forces
who failed to take refuge in flight when the great bombardment of Thurs
day morning heralded the approach of the offensive.
In addition, along the eastern side of the heights north of hattonville,
the Americans have debouched from the hill region and are astride the rail
road runrfing from Commercy to Verdun. Likewise the Thiacourt-Metz and
Nancy-Metz railroads are in American hands.
Beginning in the northwest and crossing the salient eastward, Frenes,
Les Eparges, Hattonville, Preny and Pagny and all the ground lying between
them are in American hands. The towns of Vigneulles, Thiaucourt, Pont-A,
Mousson(and St. Mihile are far in the rear of the present line. Mont Sec,
the dominating height in the center of the salient and from which much
trouble had been expected, fell without fighting. Among the numerous pris
oners taken were men from Austro-Hungarian armies.

loans has been described as having ; brthetrhs arn?8 n ctors eastward

cost to secure an adequate front
age to ground of much value to
then', and which no efforts of the
French had been able to wrest
from them, has been eliminated by
the combined. American and

The attack was made in the
time-honored manner of attack on
both sidei of the sa ient, with
elastic pressure around its apex.
More conmlete success could
hardly have been obtained and all
ohiei lives were reached well in
advance of the expected hour.
The enemy had probably determin
ed, in view of the pressure applied, to
accept a straightening of his line here
as he had done f-'-ther west, but if
that really was his intention he lost
a surprisingly large number of mer.
The groups of from a hundred to
'' ree hundred prisoners streaming
back through the advancing guns were
the most mixed lot imaginable.
From early in the niorr.ing the sky
blazed with the light of the great ar

the line. When the troops went over
what daylight there should have be-?:

WASHINGTON, Sept. 13-Complete
elimination of the St. Mihiel
salient by General Pershing's
army and co-operating French
forces, many army officials here
i believe, is only the eutering
wedge of operations of far larger
scope.
Official dispatches still were
I delayed and the full scope of the
i victorv won by the Americans in
their first independent action
could not be gauged. It was re
garded 1M probable, however, that
General Pershing's men still were
passing forward to get in touch
with the new line the enemy
htpes to hold.
Until definite word comes as to
the line across the mouth of the
destroyed salient which the Amer
icans h;ld. officers here will be
unable to form opinions a to the
most probable course future ope
rations in this theater will take.
There is strong belief, however,
that the quick reduction" of the St.
Mihiel salient will be made the
corner stone of a great encircling
movement aimed at isolating the
German fortress cf Metz. the cen
ter buttress of the whole German
frcint from the North sea to the
Swiss border.
The strategic importance of General
Pershing's smashing victory hardly
can be overestimated in the opinion
! of many observers. It is out of all pro
! portion to the extent of the territory
' regained or the forces employed, it Ss
I said, for the removal of this menace
! in the rear of The French citadel of
Verdun has released the French arm
! ies from that point to Rheims for ac
tive offensive operations. It has also
liberated ihe railway line from Ver
.dun to Commercy. Toul and Nancy,
'which will be cf the utmost value U
i General Pershing and to the French
armies on his left in supporting m
ture operations along this front.
It was the loss of thi railroad sev
ered by the Germnns in 19U with the
capture of St. Mihiel. which placed
the Verdun fortress in gravest jeo
pardy aud brought on the battle of
Verdun, where the Germans met a
bitter and costly defeat at the hands
of the French. Ever since then the
German grip on the heights around
Verdun has held the French in this re
gion and to tho east and west of the
salient was not sufficient to prevent
an effort to drive the enemy off with
out weakening the lines elsewhere.
General Pershing now has signal
ized the entry of the American army
into the war by smashing the enemy's
only remaining salient on the whole
battle front, and smashing it in less
th.m two days of fighting. Early re
i ports fixed the number of prisoners
taken by the Americans at 12.000 and

The chancellor declared that both
the German government and army
leaders desired an understanding
and peace.
Count Von Hertling said the gov
ernment and the army leaders
were against all conquests.
As soon as he was convinced of
the impossibility of an agreement
with the upper house on the suf
frage question, the chancellor said
he would dissolve the lower house. TWO

ALLAY MEXICAN FEARS
(By Rovlew Leased WIre
WASHINGTON. Sept. 13. In order
tc allay fears on the part of Mexican
citizens that they will be caught in
the military draft if they come to this
country, a telegram was sent to am
bassador Fletcher at Mexico City by
Secretary Lansing quoting a ruling of
Provost Marshal General Crowder as
to the precise operation of the select

part:
"It will be Necessary for all Mexican
citizens between the ages of 18 and
45, who are in the 1,'nited States on
September 1? to present tnmsetves
for registration cn.that day. A Mex
ican citizen who comes to the United
States after September 12 is not re-j
quired to register unless he declares

YOUNG VALLEY GIRL
MEETS WITH MOST
HORRIBLE DEATH
Late Wednesday afternoon Miss
Berta Jane Edwards, aged 18 years,
daughter of Mr. and Mrs. J. N. Ed
wards, came to a memt horrible death
at -the ranch of her parents in the
Swisshelms, near the Hunsacker
ranch. . ,
The young lady was driving a two
horse hay rack over a field toward
the house and en route ran against a
soapweed brush, causing the tongue
on the hay rack to break and frighten
ing the horses Into a run.
In endeavoring to stop the run
away team the girl fell between the
broken tongue and the double trees
and was dragged for over a quarter
of a mile. ' When found by Mr. and
Mrs. John Meadows and Tom Ed
wards, an uncle, the girl was uncon
scious and died a boot fifteen minutes
later from the effects of a kick in
the forehead received from one of
the horses in the accident.
Funeral services were held at Doug
las Thursday. The young lady had a
number of friends in this district who
will regret to hear of her death. -
MORE MEN WANTED.
At the meeting of the lwell train
ing camp for civilians lait night there
were fifteen new men out. This ':
quite a showing and helps consider
ably to make up for the loss of men
from the recent levies. As the older
men gradually drop out from one
cause or another, mostly to go into
training, new men are needed to fill
up their places and keep the company
to a sufficient size to warrant its con
tinuance. A new class was started last night
for the -beginners. Come down Mon
day night and get into it: You wont
be the only one who doesn't know me
difference between "as skirmishers,
guide center" and "right front into
line." If you get the fundamental
movements down fairly well now you
will have a tremendous advantage
over the men who have never bad any
training and place yourself in line for
a corporalship or sergeantcy. The
class meetg Monday. Tuesday, Thurs
day and Friday evenings at 6:30 at
the camp of the U. S. G. in Lowell.
Remember the time, the place and the
benefit next meeting night.

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 13. Surgeon
General Blue of the public health ser
vice, has made a telegraphic survey to
determine the extent of Spanish influ

Blue has found there was a sharp out

Ala., In August and about the same
time a tramp steamer arrived at New
port News with almost the entire crew
prostrated. Philadelphia reported a
few cases, some four weeks ago, and
a few have been reported from New
York. The Boston outbreak was re

pandemic has appeared at New Lon

"The disease is characterized by

factories, shipyards, offices or else

fever with temperature from 101 to
1G3, headache, baskache, reddening
and running of the eyes, pains and
aches all over the body, and general
prostration. Persons so attacked
should go to their homes at once, get
to bed without delay and immediately
call a doctor.
"Treatment under direction of the
physician is simple, but important,
consisting principally of resf in ben,
fresh air, abundant food, with Dover's
powders for the relief of pain. Ev

which infrequently may have fatal ter

break in foreign countries the salts
of quinine and asphlrin have been
most generally used during the acute
attack, the asphirin apparently with
much success in the relief of symptoms."
Because the last pandemic of infra-j

years ago physicians who began to
practice medicine since 1892 have not
had personal experience in handling
a situation now spreading through a ,

outside the state for civilian consump
tion pending a survey of the damage
done the prune crop by the prevailing
unprecedented rain fall, was issued
tonight by the federal food administra
tion for California. The order was
issued to insure a sufficient quantity
to fill Immense government contracts.
It was estimated by packers and
others that the rain would cause a
loss of between 25 and 50 per cent of
the total crop. The government had
contracted for 51.000,000 pounds.
Oregon and Washington packers
and shippers were instructed by the
food administration to withhold ship
ment of prune orders for civilian uses
as a precautionary measure in the in
terests . of the government needs, it
was announced.
Word has been received here that
the military authorities have placed
1000 soldiers at Camp Fremont, Calif.,
at the disposal of the prune orchard
ing in the Santa Clara vallejr to help
save the crop, the complete destruc
tion of which was said to be threaten
ed by a continuing rainfall. The sol
diers will not be called out until Mon
day, representatives of the growers
said.
Weather bureau officials here con
firmed reports that the total loss on
account of the heavy rains would
amount to millions.

NEW YORK. Sept. 13. Further en
forced . liquidation of specialties
prompted largely by contracted money
conditions, were features of today's
stock market. Irregular recoveries en
sued late in the session.
Stocks which bore the brunt of the
inititial decline included shippings, to
baccos, motors and oils.
Standard stocks, rails as well as In
dustrials, also weakened In the early
selling, but rallied at the first signs
of support and short covering.
There were specific reasons for the
heaviness of certain issues. Marine
preferred, for instance, owed its set
back of 3 points to the company's an
nual report, which disclosed a large
decrease in net income.
United States Steel closed at a
(slight fractional gain, after losing al

WASHINGTON, Sept 13. The ad
ministration measure designed to
stimulate the sale of Liberty bonds
by making a larger amount of them
held bf individuals and corporations
free from federal taxation, was passed
tonight bf the house without a dis
senting vote.
All of the bill's important features
exempting from Income and war ex
cess profits taxation the interest on
bonds up to $30,000 of the fourth is
sue and $45,000 of previous issues, au
thorizing regulation of Liberty bond
transaction and increasing war sav
ings stamps authorization from $2,
000.000,000 to $4,000,000,000 were left
unchanged by the house.
The bill now goes to the senate with
prospects of -speedy enactment next
week. The house spent the entire day
considering the measure, putting over'
the war revenue bill until tomorrow I
when general debate will be closed.
Leaders plan to begin initial consid
eration of amendments Monday under
a five minute debate rule.
Enactment of the bond bill had been
asked by the treasury department be
fore the beginning of the fourth Lib
erty loan campaaign September 28
and all speakers in the .house today
agreed that the measure would great
ly stimulate subscriptions to the loan.
Although there was no opposition to
the provisions for increasing tax ex
emptions of Liberty bonds, a sharp
fight developed on the clause authoriz
ing the president to regulate or pro
hibit transactions in government
bonds or other certificates. The pro
vision, however, was retained in the
bill, the house reversing previous ac
tion in committee of the whole after a
stirring appeal by Majority Leader
Kitchin.
PITTSBURGH, Pa., Sept. 12. W. A.
Chamberlain, of Pittsburg, said to be
acting for the Pressed Steel Car com
pany, today bid $1,312,000 for the ex
tensive properties formerly owned by
the Orenstem-Arthur-Koppel company.
The company holdings were sold at
auction at Hopper? Pa., this afternoon
and eight firms qualified as bidders by
each depositing certified checks for
$50,000.
This was the largest industrial plant
solely controlled by Germans, seized
and disposed of at auction, under the
alien property law.
The highest bid remains open for 15
days for further offers, failing which
Mr. Palmer will call upon the present
bidder for a deposit of 25 per cent and
the property will be transferred to him
and those he represents.
The OrensteinArthur-Koppel com

To Senator Sutter
Senator Fred Sutter lost his home county
of Cochise to his opponent in the guber
natorial primary, and, regarding this deplor
able event, this column would repeat the
immortal words of the old commentator
who referred to Cato's defeat in a certain
Roman election of long ago, as follows:
"Cato lost the election for praetor and for
consul, but is anyone blind enough to truth
to imagine that these reverses cast any re
flection upon him? The dignity of these
magistracies would have been enhanced by
his wearing thern; THEY SUFFERED,
NOT CATO!"
St. Mihiel
Let us go slowly. Hamba gachle (go
slowly), as the Zulus used to say. We
have won one of the most brilliant and
striking victories of the war. We have
taken in two days a vicious salient that has
stood out ten miles into the allied lines like
a great thorn in the flesh for four long
years. But let us not get up in the air over
this feat. The German lines here had beer,
stripped of their best troops to hold the
French, English and American thrusts fur
ther north at -more vital points. The Ger
rnans evidently counted on the advantage
of position and ground and concrete in
trenchments and heavy gun power to hold
these quiet lines of Lorraine. But the
Yanks struck so quickly and so
ferociously that they were swept off
their feet and had lost their strongest posi
tions before they got ready to fight. The
rest was a slaughter, with picked, eager,
young, terrible troops jamming the land
wehr and Austrian amkeshift and stopgaps
and the raw leVues and a sprinkling of first
line troops like a platoon of police in a riot.
It was a master stroke. Of that there is
not a doubt.
As this is written the number of pris
oners taken in the cutting off of the salient
is not known. Two divisions (twenty-six
thousand men) were reported in the neck
of the bottle and were thought to be doom
ed to capture. Let us hope so.
This is a splendid beginning we have
made. A wonderful beginning. St Mihiel
salient was mostly high ground and steep
hillside and rocky promintories and guns
and concrete shelters and trenches. But re
member, it is only a beginning. Our real
objective is Metz fortress, twelve miles dis
tant and protected by intrenchments seven
miles deep.
The loss of St. Mihiel was the price the
Germans had to pay for bringing troops to
hold the English before Cambrai and the
French before Laon.
THE NOMINATION OF COLTER
(From the Arizona Gazette.)
Incomplete returns from the primary of
yesterday clearly indicate the nomination
of State Senator Fred T. Colter as the standard-bearer
for the democratic party in the
fight for the governorship this fall. Now
that Senator Colter is the nominee of the
party, the party will demand- that he take a
stand upon the issue that he avoided during
the primary.
The nominee of the democratic party
cannot evade what 13 and has been an issue
in this state for several years. I. W. W'ism
is deeply rooted in the mining camps of this
state and the greatest industry of the state is
constantly menaced by this organized aggre
gation of outlaws. State Organizer McClus
ky of the Western Federation of Miners, in
a talk before the Arizona State council of
defense, stated that there are thousands of
this nefaricous organization in the mining
camps. They constitute a constant men
ace, not only to mining industry, but to
the honest labor element of the state as
well.
The republican candidate was the first to
get l;i3 announcement before the public and
that announcement made I. W. W'ism the
paramount issue. Almost daily the news
dispatches carry stories of the activities of
these enemies of society. Just within the
past few days there have been several ar
rests of I. W. W. leaders in this state for
their activity in attempting to bring about
a general strike, tying up the mining in
dustry in an effort to secure the liberation
of ninety or more felon members of that
organization convicted in Chicago and now
serving sentences in Leavenworth.
The democratic party demands that its
candidate go on record in line with the tra
ditions for the peace and prosperity of the
state at all times. A mere declaration by
a candidate that he is "against all lawless
ness" will not suffice. In Arizona it is es
sential that a stand be taken against a par
ticular brand of lawlessness, which threat
ens the peace and prosperity of all classes
residing within its boundaries. That kind
of lawlessness takes the form of sabotage
we have had numerous cases of it here
in Maricopa county and that sabotage is
the action of I. W. W. and their sympathiz
ers. In denouncing "all lawlessness" this
particular brand must be named and speci
fied. This was evaded by Senator Colter as a
candidate for the nomination. As the nom
inee of the party he cannot evade taking a
stand and there is but one stand for the
representative of the democratic party to
take.
The voters of the state are expecting an
early and positive announcement on this
issue.
Military critics are expecting the great
est battle of the war within the next ten
days, or a German retirement on an extend
ed scale. That the British will strike for
Cambrai and Douai and Lens is almost cer
tain. And it is just as certain that the
French will bend every energy to take La
Fer, St. Quentin and Laon before winter.
It will be a fine fall job, all this. And if the
Germans elect to stay and fight for these
places, and there is now every indication
that they have so decided, fighting will be
witnessed on the western front that will
make all other struggles seem tame. Al
lied tanks, airplanes, guns of large calliber
and machine guns now dominate anything
the Germans can muster. And allied re
serves in the form of about three-quarters
of a million of American troops, outclass
the lesser reserves of the kaiser, who prom
ised a victorious peace by last August, and
these reserves now threaten Metz and most
of the Lorraine front.
"We shall pursue the enemy implac
ably," says Gen. Ferdinand Foch". And for
two solid months he has been doing it, and
now he has struck in a fresh spot. Do you
know what "implacably" means? It 13 a
terrible word and sounds all the depths of
human resolution, resource and bitterness.
It means not to be appeased or to be turned
aside. It means on, ever on, to the end.
It means not to be stopped by any cries of
peace or truce or to be satisfied with a mere
victory any where along the route. It
means not to be pacified or diverted or
made to hesitate by anything the enemy
may do or say or suffer. Foch speaks but sel
dom, always briefly and straight to the
point, like a launched spear that flashes
its meaning in the sunlight for a second, ere
it reaches the mark.
And still the field of stars on our battle
flags grow. First it was Cantigny, where
we first showed the Germans we could
fight. Then came Chateau Thierry, where
the marines beat the kaiser's best and stop
ped dead the German rush on Paris. Then
on the Marne where we drove right into
the heart of the German forces and cleared
a bloody track clear to the Vesle. Then at
Juvigny under Mangin, where we beat the
Prussian guards. Now at St. Mihiel we
have added another star. How lustrous it
shall be and how far its rays shall cast the
light is not yet known, but the promise is
glorious in its brightness.
Berlin reported "a quiet day" yester
day on the entire battle front. As they only
lost an important observation point at Le
Basse and two vital towns cn the St. Quen
tin front and practically all of the Mihiel
salient, along with some fourteen thousand
prisoners, a hundred cannon, etc., wonder
what they would call "a busy day"- on the
battle front.
The German military critics and writers
have the floor. The subject is, "The Amer
icans Cannot l ight." Go right ahead, gen
tlemen, and tell your people all about it;
there is plenty of fresh information at your
hand in case you have forgotten the Marne
and Juvigny.
JEROME PAPER GIVES
ACCOUNT OF ARREST
OF W.N. JOHNSON
MAN WHO WAS GIVEN COAT OF
TAR AND FEATHERS HERE HAS
PRISON RECORD AND DISHON
ORABLE DISCHARGE FROM
ARMY
On account of the iocai interest that
was aroused over the arrest of Walter
N. Johnson in Jerome on Monday last,
The Review prints the following arti
cle taken from the Verde Copper News
of that date:
"With 30,0(10 handbills callinB for a
general strike of two weeks' duration,
beginning Sept. 10. to force the re
lease of Thomas J. Mooney, William
1. Haywood and the other I. W. W.
conspirators convicted at Chicago,
waller N. Johnson, the I. W. W. who
was tarred and feathered at Bisbee ths
night the same treatment was accord
ed William Waldroop in Jerome, was
arrested here last night.
"The handbills, half in English and
half in Spanish, were printed at Phoe
nix, and Johnson came to Jerome di
rectly from that place. He was ar
rested immediately after his arrival.
"OnP suitcase was filled with the
handbills. Johnson also had a crip
containing I. W. W. sabotage stick
ers, song books and fifteen or twenty
other pamphlets, all of a most vio
knt and seditious character.
"Hut for the capture of Johnson,
the handbills would have been secret
ly distributed last night. How far the
strike movement would have gone Is
uncertain. It is believed that all the
I. W. W. in tlie Verde district would
have responded.
"That the handbills were to be
printed came to the knowledge of
Deputy U. S. Marshal Harry Carlson
several days ago. He wired his Irv
formation to Phoenix and an investi
gation was set on foot there. It was
discovered that th? printing had actu
ally been accomplished at one of the
Phoenix printeries and that Johnson
had started for Jerome with a supply
for this district.
"Yesterday afternoon a perfect net
work was arranged to injure that
Job'ison would not slip into Jerome
undetected. Whether he would come
all the way by train or would get off
'he train at Prescott and finish by
auto stage was -unknown, therefore
Sheriff A. O. McDcrmid and Joh.i
M uiuls watched all stages arriving at
Ccttonwood. Deputy Sheriffs Frank
Uartlett and Jack Allen were on
guard at Clarkda!e. Carlson himself
was at t'le I'nited Verde & Pacific
station in Jerome while Marshal J. G.
Crowley and Dentitv Sheriff Fred
Hawkins observed the buses at the
Connor hotel.
"Carlson began a search of the ex
press car immediately upon the ar
rival of the train for he thought that
Johnson would probably bring his
strike literature in by express. He
noticed a. young man with a heavy
suitcase and grip trembling violently,
hut derided that he was probably a
booze importer and let him go for the
more impoitant business he had in
hand.
"The search of the express car was
without result, but upon the arrival
of the buses Crowley noticed the
same trembling young man and lnv
mediately took him in tow. He held
him until Calson came down the
hill, when the prisoner's baggage was
examined and it was discovered that
he was indeed Walter N. Johnson, th
I. W. W. agitator sent here to tie up
the mines and smelters of the Verdi
district in a general strike.
"Johnson refused to talk at the time
but it is understood that thrs mornihs
he made important admissions whlcn
the officers are withholding until they
receive instructions from the I'nited
States' attorney's office in Phoenix.
"Among Johnson's papers was a dis
honorable discharge from the army,
and a record showing that he had
served a year in the military prison
at Alcatraz island, in. San Francisc
bay. His term expired in" 1909. This
record also bhows that he is a little
over 32 years old.
"The technical charge on which
Johnson is held is violation of the
espionage act. Under the circum
stances it is extremely unlikely that
he can escape conviction aud a peni
tcntiary sentence of at least ten
years."

party had taken to Jar canyon, thirty
two miles west of Sedalia, an isolated
spot in the hills. Scores of persons
are scouring the vicinity and it is
feared a pitched battle will take place
when the fugitives are sighted.
A man coining south to this city
reported that as the car passed him
he saw the legs of a man protruding
through the dour. Indicating that one
of the bandits had been killed or
wounded in the fusilade in Colorado
Springs.
Rowan, the officer who was killed
here, was known as one of the ablet
detectives in tht west and had been
one of tho local force for fourteen
years. His son is in France.
STORY OF HOLDUP
KANSAS CITY. Mo.. Sept. IX A
dozen men. some of whom now are be
lieved to have been implicated in the
clash today with officers at Colorado
Springs, held up a Missouri, Kansas Ai
Texas train near Koch, Kansas, on the
night of July in. Several passengers
were wounded by the promiscuous
and express ears were robbed after
they bad been cut off from the rest of
train ami i-ikpii iliiMii the track.
Two weeks later four women were
arrested here on the belief thai they
were connected with the robliry. or at
least knew something about it Aft
er being kept iu Jail t-eve-.a! weeks,
they v ere questioned by a United
States commissioner aud released.
The Cochise county highway com
mission will meet in this city again
today for the purpose of opening bids
for work to be done on the paved
road between here and Douglas. At
the last meeting of the board in this
city the bids for doing a part of the
work were rejected as being too high
and the commission will endeavor to
obtain some results this time.
The bids as called for are on the
grading and paving, for furnishing
cement, iron bars, etc., for building
the concrete facing for the culverts
and hauling the supplies from the va
rious points along the road to where
thev are to be usel.
The commission will also receive
bids for grading the road between
Tombstone and Curtis Flat and in
stalling the culverts.
A number of contractors have been
in the city for the past week examin
ing the plans and specifications that
are on file in the engineer's office
and it is expected that a number of
bids will be received.
It i3 expected that all members o
the commission will be on hand with
the exception of Captain Hogdson,
who is now in Michigan. The com
mission will convene at 2 o'clock.

SECTOR WIPED OUT.
WITH TIIK AMERICAN ARMY IN
LORRAINE. Sept. IX I!y The Asso
ciated Press, 7 p. m ) The St. Mihiel
salient has been wiped out and tht
enemy forces now are virtually with
their backs on the famous Wotaa-IIin-denburg

French paralleling them closely from
Verdun to the Moselle. i

FRENCH IN SUPPORT. .
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
LORRAINE, Sept. IX (By The Asse
elated Press, 6 o. ni.) lirilliantly sup
ported by the French, General Persh
ing has accomplished the "limited ob
'ectives" of the operations undertaken
in the St. Mihiel 'region. The two
forces, pushing respectively southeast
and northwest, took position after po
sition from the enemy, advancing with
a rapidity, precision and dash that
disheartened him after his reverses of
recent months. Few late actions have
yielded so much ground of so impor
tant a nature.
The preliminary artillery work in
the dark hours of the morning was do
moralizing in the thoroughness of its
destructiveness. The enemy was pre
pared for a possible blow in this re
gion, but four hours of almost unsur
passed shelling gas and from guns of
all calibers, left him powerless to
bring up his reserves or maintain com
munications. His roads were torn np.
his supplies and material destroyed.
his ammunition dumps sent skyward
and villages behind his lines fired. A
large number of prisoners, quantities
of supplies and many guns fell into
the hands of the allies.
Kventful stab'.izatlon here will free
important lines of rail communication
as well as roadways, and leave in the
possession of the French and Ameri;
cans high ground which will be of
great mi'itary advantage when the
wet season begins.
Exceptional assistance has been
given by the a v ration forces, both Am
erican and French. Planes of pursuit
groups attack successfully convoys
and troops on the roads, and even op
crate effectively against troops In
formation.
Flying low. they used their machine
guns with deadly effect on the lines of
infantry, in some instances causing
them to break.
Tanks were used, but not to any
great- extent, the chief reason being
that it was unnecessary to call upon
them. The Germans In most rases r"
treated without waiting for the wip
ing cut machines to force them.
The rains that began shortly after
the battle commenced have continued
at intervals since.
The arguments on a part of the
damage suits against the mining com
panies and certain individuals of the
Warren district arising out of the de
portation, will be heard In Tombstone
today before Judge Lockwood. The
attorneys for the defendants have at
tached the legality of the filing of the
suits in which the defendants have
served and brought by Messrs. Struck
meyer and Cleary. The question has
been raised whether or not the print
ed name of the attorneys on the com
plaint complies with the law which
says that the complaint must 'oe
signed by the plaintiff or his attorney.
None of them were signed, they were
all printed.
Fred C. Struckmeyer, one of the at
torneys for the defendants, arrived :a
the city yesterday and will go to
Tombstone this morning to represent
his clients. The numerous attorneys
for the defendants will also be on
hand.
There has been no service made In
the suits as yet that were filed by
the other Phoenix attorneys or the El
Paso firm. The Struckmeyer ft Cleary
cases are the only ones that have been
served.
The outcome of the demurrers will
be watched with interest as a ruling
in the favor of the contention will
mean the throwing out of this entire
lot of cases. The argument is expect
ed to take up considerable time of the
cqurt.

STERNLY WITH
CAPITAL-LABOR
(Continued from Paffe Out)
' Kent bad been evacuated without
1 rious Interference caused much amuse
ment among -ft leers in view of the
number of prisoners captured. It has
been estimated that seven divisions ot
the enemy were in the salient includ
ing thos standing guard at Its flanks.
Probably not more than four divisions
have at any time been in the depth of
the pocket and of these, more than
one-fourth have been captured. Offi
cers say that a retreat effected at
such a oost hardly can be considered
as a successful evacuation and thy
are inclined to accept toe Uenaaa
statement as promulgated tor home
consumption. It was said that tor the
high command to acknowledge that
the first American blow was bloUed
out in less than two days a salient
that had been held for tour years and
also cost the Germans more thaa IX
Ooo prisoners in addition to their dead
might further agitate the German civil
population.
At tbe same time, it is not doubted
that the German leaders expected the
stroke and made such preparations aa
they could toward getting their main
forces out of the salient. The swift
ness of the American advance on the
flanks, however, seems to have upset
their plans. And it Is believed that
the figures on war material captured
will bear out this statement.

No estimate of the war booty captured

Since the new line across tbe mouth
of the old pocket is far shorter than
the old front. French and American
troops heretofore held fast to the de

for other, duty.
.As the lines were reported tonight,
there was nothing to indicate that the
American advance had stopped. The
German official statement said a new
line had been prepared but the nature
of the country where the American
troops stood late today indicated that
the German defense position must be
further back toward Metx where bet-,

was expected here that American pa

this line before a new advance is un-1

On and After September 15
Anyone Wishing to Leave
Country Must Obtain Nec
essary Permission
The department of state has notified i
the district headquarters of the United j
States Immigration service, Mexican,
border district, that the new war-tims
passport regulations will go into ef
fect and be enforced on and after the ,
15th instant. The president's procla-1
mation on the subject was issued on
the 8th ultimo, pursuant to the act of:
congress, approved May 22, 1918 and
entitled "An Act to Prevent, in Time
of War, Departure From and Entry ;
into the United States contrary to the
public safety." While in some in-j
stances the new passport regulations
are more rigid than heretofore, provis-j
ion has been made for proper travel to
and from the United States by per-'
sons well disposed toward this coun-
try, who have legitimate reasons to!
cross and recross the international!
boundary. The object of the act andj
regulations is the institution of a1
more comprehensive and at the same:
time mere simple system of travel ;
control. j
Immigration Officials Act '
In many respects the machinery ot'
the present system is retained but the
system has been simplified by the con-j
centration in the secretary of state of
the entire power to grant or withhold!
permits for international travel. Here-1
tofore'thig power has been distributed!
among the various departments of the'
government. Under the new regula-1
tions the secretary of state concen-1
trates control of Mexican border travel I
in the hands of the United States immi-l
gration service whose inspectors byj
virtue of presidential proclamation,!
will act as control officers and permit'
agents for the department of state. !
As heretofore, neither aliens nori
United States citizens will be permit-1
ted to enter the United States without j
properly visaed passports. Aliens de
siring to depart from the county may,
in proper cases, obtain permission to
do so by applying to the nearest per
mit agent. United States citizens re
siding at a distance greater than ten
miles from the international boundary
must abtain regular passports from
the department of state, as hereto-1
fore.
Special Provisions 'Made I
To facilitate necessary business and j
social intercourse, "special provisions;
have been made for both citizens and I
aliens residing within ten miles of the
international line on either side there-1

citizens and aliens will not be valid on
and after tho lnt.'i instant. In proper
cases, holders of such cards may ob

BOLSHEVIKI RULE IS
FOSTERING ALL GRAFT
STOCKHOLM, Wednesday, Sept.
11, (By the Associated Press.) Graft
always has been the bane of Russian
official life and Bolsheviki rule has
not been able to cure this evil. On
the contrary, say observers of the
Russian political situation who have
arrived here from Moscow, the Bol
sheviki have unwittingly encouraged
corruption among the officials by
paying salaries insufficient to cover
bare living expenses. They do that
only to save money for the depleted
national treasury, but on the theory
that the Bolsheviki work not merely
for money but for the love of their
ideal.
While such a theory may hold good
with the Bolsheviki of the ideal type
and there are few such a great ma
jority of the officials are of the Bol
sheviki only to the extent of the
benefit which can be derived from
protesting loyalty to the cause. To
these the monthly salary of 6i0 or 500
rubles usually paid to officials of the
second and third classes national
commissars and members of the cen
tral executive receives 100 rubles, the
conjmissars getting loo rubles addi
tional for each child is insufficient
to buy bread for a family.
Another ill of the old Russian regi
me greatly aggravated behind the
present disorganization is idleness.
The chief of an important govern
ment department at Moscow which
employs several hundred people tola
the Associated Press that only a few
officials and typists performed their
work conscientiously and that the ma
jority smoke cigarettes, drink tea and
talk most of the time.
A still worse situation was found at
the Petrograd postoffice when that in
stitution recently was inspected by a
government commission. The chair
man of the commission in his publish
ed report stated that although the
mail matter had been handled by the
postoffice was only 40 per cent of the
amount of that of previous years, the
number of employees had been doub
led within the last year.
"They work only three hours a
day," he said, "as there is no author
ity to enforce the six hour law for
office employees. They recognize no
superiors except their own commit
tees." The chairman also noted a great in
creased in thefts at the postotfice and
said these were hard to trace be
cause of the general confusion.
