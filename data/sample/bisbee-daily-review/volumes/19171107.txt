Complete agreement was

yesterday between President Wllsors
mediation commission, headed by bec-;
retary of. Labor W. B. Wilson, and j I
the operators of the Warren district.,)
The understanding, which goes into X
effect at once, provides for the ap-:

to the administrator. The commis-
CISCO.
The commission, which has already
investigated conditions at Globe, Mi-
ami, Clrfton, Morenci and Metcalf, ar
rived in Bisbee last Thursday morn
ing. The members took up informal
hearings with those who had com
plaints to make, first then with the
officials of the city and county, then
with men who had worked steadily
for months and lastly with the opera
tors.
According to the plan, as adopte

Moyer Rumor Denied.
Concerning rumors which have been
current in the district since Sunday
to the effect that President Chas. F.
Moyer, of the I. U. M. M. S. W. came
here with the commission with the
understanding that during its pres
ence and under its protection he would
organize a Warren district local of
the Western Federation, Secretary
Wilson last evening pointed, when the
rumors were brought to his attention,
to the clauses in the proposal to the
mining companies in which it is ex
plicitly Bet forth that there shall be
no" discrimination between union and
non-union labor in other words, that
the open shop shall prevail.
"There is complete answer jn these
clauses to any such rumor," said the
secretary. "We are neither for or
against the union or union organiza
tion. "Mr. Moyer is not affiliated wltii
the commission in any way. The or
ganization or encouragement of unions
is in no way the business or concern
of the commission.
"Though under no obligation to the
commission and not uader its direo
tion, Mr. Moyer has said in response
to the request of tiie commission that
he will do nothing in the Warren dis
trict or elsewhere In Arizona that is
not in accord with its agreements, in
cluding no discrimination between on
ion and non-union men and no strikes."
JThis wholly frank response cannot
be accepted as anything other than a
complete denouncement of any report
ed relationship between Mr. Moyer and
the commission or the secretary of la
bor. It terminates pointedly the slight
est chance for any such association
being made to stick by imposters and
rumor mongers, here or elsewhere in
the state.
Leave For Coast.
On account of the troubles which
are now at a breaking point on the
Pacific coast between the Pacific Tel
ephone and Telegraph company and
its employees the commission leaves
this morning for San Francisco instead
of going from Bisbee to Jerome.
Instead the commission has appoint
ed Judge Ernest W. Lewis, of Phoe
nix, as mediator for Jerome. Judge
Lewis will go to Jerome and make
every effort to put Into effect a sim
ilar agreement as that reached in this
district. ,
The Completed Agreement.
The agreement as readied, ad
dressed to the operators, detailing the
various clauses, follows:

Agreement Guaranteeing
Territorial Integrity and ,
"Open Door" in Orient
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 6. Formal'
announcement today of the agreement!
between the United States antl Japan;
in regard to China was greeted in,
diplomatic and otficial circles as one:
of the momentous events of the wari
period. Its effect is expected to bei
jfar reaching both upon future devei-l
cpments in the far east and upon the!
prosecution of the war against Ger-
many.
In addition to the notes exchanged
between Secretary Lansing and Vls
ccunt Ishii, the special Japanese am-
jbassador, recording an agreement rec-
I nratqinir Tanon'a cnanial IntAmot S
China, guaranteeing the independence
and territorial integrity of China and I
reaffirming the open-door policy, it is I
announced that a satisfactory under-j
standing faas been reached as to mili
tary, naval .and economic co-opera-:
ton. j
"Hands Off" J
Informally, it is explained tiiat this)
aereement is in no sense an applica
tion of the Mcirroe doctrine to thej
orient, but instead is rather an ap
plication of the pan-American doc
trine of "hands off." It does not alter
the Root-Takahira "open door" agree
ment in any way, though it supple
ments it. ' I
In differentiating between the Mon
roe doctrine and the pan-Americanism,
officials said the former was dis
tinctly a national policy, while the
latter was altruistic and ' interna
tional. No intimation was given as to what
would be considered the "special in
terests" of Japan, but the comparison
was drawn with the position of the
United States as regards Mexico.
The text of the notes has been com
municated to China through the Chi
nese embassy, but it was stated that
no statement would: be made here
regarding China's position until some
word has been received from Peking.
Complete Accord
The complete accord reached be-i
tween the United States snd Japan, j
ft was authoritatively stated, does not
mean that an offensive and defensive
alliance has been created between
the two countries, such as exists be
tween Japan and Great Britain, al
though both nations-do pledge them
selves to a definite line of action.
Emphasis was laid in official dis
cussions on the last paragraph of thej
agreement. This is the declaration
that both countries are opposed to
the acquisition by any government of!

Most of the newspapers which had
supported Mitchel, and that included
all in the city except those owne by
'William R. Hearst, conceded Hylan's
election before 7 o'clock,
j Judge Hylan's first act after being
, assured of his election was to make
this statement: N
i Hylan's Statement.
"Tiio result speaks for itself. The
' people have spoken and in no uncer
tain manner. Democracy has once
! more been restored to power. The
people and not the corporate inter
ests will rule for the next four years.
! 1 am indeed grateful for the confi
I dence thus reposed in me by the cit
izens of the city of New York.
"The result is a complete justifica
tion of the fight we have made for
economy, honesty, and efficiency in
the public service. That was the sole
issue upon which the election was de
cided.
"I want to make it plain to the
! worU that there was no issue of
'Americanism or loyalty Involved, so
far aj I am concerned. There could
' be none for I am as good an Ameri
. can as any man, as loyal to my flag,
' as loyal to my country and as firm
and determined in support of every
act of the government in this war as
i any man.
"I ask the editors of the newspaper
in this city and in other cities to give
prominence to this declaration, so that
I there may not go abroad to the peo
' pie of this country who have no ap
' preciation of our local situation the
slightest intimation that the question
of the war or the war policy of Presi
de nt Wilson and the United States
, government are in the slightest way
involved.
"My first utterance in this campaign
in response to a question put by a re-
i porter was that I stood uncompromis
ingly behind the president in support
of the acts and policies of my coun-
, try and that the war must be fought
to a conclusion which would bring an
' honorable peace to America."

"The returns evidenced the fact that
unscrupulous newspapers no longer
represent the opinion or sentiment of
the people; that the latter do their
own thinking and refuse to be misled
by misrepresentation or suppression
of the real Issue.
"After all is said and done, it is
refreshing to all of us to know that
in the candidacy of Mr. Mitchel, Mr.
Hylan and Mr. Bennett every voter
bad the pleasant opportunity of voting
for a loyal American citizen."
Socialist Vote Surprising.
The tremendous socialist vote was
the feature of the election. The to
tal polled by the party in the last
mayoralty election was only . 32.133.
This year Hillquit ran a t'ose third to
Mayor Mitchel and in many election
districts on the east aide, In parts of
Harlem and the Bronx, he polled more
votes than Mitchel. Hillquit ran on
a straight-out peace platform. He said
a victory for him would 'be a mandate
to the government to negotiate an im
mediate peace.
Hylan carried all five boroughs of
Greater New York.
Had the election been close, the re
sult might have hinged on the votes
of the 65,000 soldiers and sailors from
this city who now are In government
service, but if all of them voted for
Mitchel it could not change the1 re
sult
Hylan's plurality may equal that
by which Mayor Mitchel was elected
over McCall, the Tammany candidate.
four years ago. Mitchel succeeded the
late William J. Gaynor, who was elect
ed by Tammany, -but who broke with
that organization soon after taking of
fice and became one of the bitterest
enemies of Charles F. Murphy and his
associates.
Hylan's Career,
Mayor-elect Hylan began his career
In New York as a track layer on the
old King's county elevated railroad 'at
a wage of $1.50 a day. When the road
was completed he was given a Job
as fireman of one of its little steam
locomotives which drew the trains in
the pioneer day of elevated railroads
here and later was promoted to engineer.
Soon Hylan took up law, studying
days and working a "run" on the ele
vated road at night He was dis
charged by the railroad company when
an inspector found him studying in
his cab. He was admitted to the bar
in 1897 and began practice in Brook
lyn,
Hylan was appointed city magistrate
by Mayor McClellan in 1908 and was
appointed a county judge of Kings
county by Governor Glynn late in 1913
The following year he was elected to
the same office by a plurality of 27,000
running as a democrat '
Congratulates Hylaiw
After sending Judge Hylan 'a tele
gram of congratulation upon his elec
tion, Mayor Mitchel made this stat
ment:
'"TJhere is nothing to be -added tc
the mandate which the city has given
to Judge Hylan.

His Troubles of Tweney

"I suffered for twenty years with

trying . to get well, but it only took
three bottles of Tanlac to straighten

where he served as deputy sheriff for

Terms By Prominent Phoe
nician. A Bisbee man recently returned
from Phoenix tells of meeting J. C.
Adams ,the veteran hotel man and
father of the state fair, up there, and
heaiing him bear 'witness to the fine
generosity of the copper companies
of the state which made possible fhe
fine racing program at the state fair
this month. The. coftipanies guaran
teed two purses of $5000 each for
speed events, and the richness of the
reward has brought out some fine en
tries. Mr. Adams Is commissioner of
the speed program and is enthused
over the prospect of the best race
meet in years, and is also apprecia
tive of the public spirit that makes
it possible.

SIGHS OF DANGER
That Should Be Heeded by Bisbee
People.
There's serious danger In neglecting
any weakness of the kidneys. The
warning that Nature gives should not
be overlooked. If troubled by bladder
j weakness; if you have backache, too,
'with frequent headaches and dizziness,
make up your mind that your kidneys
jare affected and begin using some re
liable kidney remedy. Deaths from
jkidney disease have increased in the
I United States, alone, 72 per cent In the
j last 20 years. The risk is great tu
can't affo.rd to delay. Bisbee people
recommend Doan's- Kidney Pills. Can
you ask for better proof of merit than
I the statement of this Bisbee resident?
j Mrs. John Gohrig. of Brewery Gulch,
says: "About two years ago I had a
ctmUant, nagging pain across the

Playing the Game of War
It is a strange thing, this psychology of war and na
tions. A couple of thousand years ago the Greeks were
the best fighting men In the world. They held this high
place for a hundred years or more and then they deteri
orated until they were easy prey for the Roman. For
three hundred years the Roman legions ruled all of Eu
rope with a relentless and invincible hand. As a soldier
the Roman was in a class all by himself. And then Rome
passed into decay and the legionary became only a mem
ory. Neither the Greek or the Roman could ever come back.
The fighting qualities of their ancestors never flamed up
again. The pitiful showing of the Italians against the
Prussians recently Is but another proof. ,
A thousand years ago the men of Norway were the
scourge of Europe.' Man for man, there was no one
who could 'stand against the Northman. These sons of
Thor and Odin smote the men of France and England
and Germany and made them look like children at the
stern game of war. But they passed on to Skoll's cham
bers of death, these men, and none came to replace them
Norway could never come back.
Only a few hundred years ago the Swedes, both un
der Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII, were the mas
ter fighters of Europe. For a perrod of fifty years Swe
den held the respect and fear of all the kings of Europe.
But the light of Sweden went out at Pultowa, and no
hand in Sweden has ever been able to strike a name in
this cold and empty lamp. Sweden could never come
back.
For a thousand years the men of France and England
and Germany have been brave and enterprising and stub
born fighters. 'And they are so to this day. The martial
spirit, the pride of race and achievement,, the genius of
organization, the pliancy to discipline and progress, the
staying qualities, the skill and craft, the inherent ability,
the glorious courage that raised the nations above the
wreck of Rome and the ruin of barbarism more than a
thousand years ago, still burn with undiminished flame
in the hearts of their children.
Egypt, Persia, Greece, Rome, Norway, Sweden, Spain,
all these nations were supreme for either brief or ex
tended periods of time, but their strength and glory de
parted until they became weaker than the most despised
of their ancient enemies, and not one of them could ever
come back.
But England is as strong and stubborn today in the
game of war as she ever was in all the thousand yearn
she has played so well at this world-old game.
France, the proud and wayward queen of the nations,
has gone to war a hundred times in a thousand years
and never failed to make a gallant fight against odds.
And she is fighting as well today as she did at Tours,
against the Moslems or at Friedland in the zenith of her
glory.
German trilesnien were the first of the barbarians
to ever defeat a Roman legion. Arminius performed this,
feat by both craft and courage some fifteen, hundred
years ago. and ever since then the German has always
made a good fight when he turned Imr hand to war. lie
is a bold and successful fighter today.
There Is a psychology of success in war, and it has
to do with an entire nation. The misrule of a nation may
unfit for war for a period, but not for all time. Good
rulers alternate with bad in the course of the years. The
people, as a whole, make or break a nation in the game
of war. The thoughts they think, the life they lead, the
songs they sing, these things determine the strength ot
their country when it fares the supreme test of battle
with'a rival or ambitious nation.
. When the hearts of a people turn to worship pride
and ambition and cruelty and power and pleasure, that
jialion is ripe for its fall. And when jt falls from a com
bination of th"se causes It ran never rise again.
England and France have had cruel and weak and
unjust and licentious rulers In their troubled and stormy
lives, but the hearts of these people never turned en
tirely away from certain in-born principles of justice of
the kindness and self-respect and independence of spirit
and pride of the glorious past and love of the higher and
better things of life. And so It was that they weathered
every storm' of misrule and conquered every period of
weakness and kept their vitality unimpaired for every
time of need.
The English shipbuilder and the French artisan aved
his country many times. And so has the English writer
and orator and preacher and yeoman and teacher and
toiler who held to their ideals. And so has the French
vine dresser and dreamer and lover and pries: and singer
of stirring songs. English loveof fair play and French
gallantry have been the leaven of the. English lump and
the French lump that are as solid and fine today as they
ever were in the time of these old giants' young days.
But the German, long a power in the world, and a
sturdy and a staunch people, have turned at last to the
false Idols of power and ambition and the ruthless sav
agery of the conquest of the weak and the divine right
of the strong, and her end is near. She will go the sam'?
way and by the same path that the proud feet of the
Roman and the Spaniard pressed in years gone by and
disappeared forever. Beaten in this war, Germany will
never come back to her high place. Not alone the kaiser,
but the hearts of his entire people have deserted prin
ciple and honor, these rocks upon which the-only endur
ing things are builded in this world, to raise gilded tem
ples to false gods upon the shifting sands of deceit, dis
honor and disgrace.
A TRIBUTE TO THE PRESS.
J. W. Hoopes, deputy governor of the Federal Re-
serve bank Of Dallas, in whose district Is included Ari
zona, pays the following tribute to the press in connec
tion with the success of the Liberty bond drive, in a
personal letter to the editor of the Review. '
"It would seem that the success of the loan in the
Eleventh Federal Reserve district is now assured.
"We are so impatient to write to you that we have de
cided not to wait for final figures. The services that
you have rendered in the Liberty loan campaign have
been such, that whatever the result, the sincerest thanks
of the treasury department, and ourselves, are due to you
for the magnificent efforts you have put forth.
"To say that the loan could not have been subscribed
without the assistance of the press, is an obvious truism.
The government knows it, we know it, andwe trust that
the general public realizes it fully. The publicity car
ried by the newspapers, while of the greatest value to
the country at large, has also benefited the press; it
has enhanced the already high standing and dignity of
its members over the whole country.
"We are preparing a report for the officials of the
treasury department, in which we shall make specific ref
erence and give details of the work you have accom-plsihed."
TAKING THE FOOD PLEDGE.
Los Angeles Tribune: Food pledge week has been
tremendously successful. Some opposition has been evi
denced here and there by disloyal or thick-headed, ob
stinate folk to the activities of the propaganda, but the
great body of our people heartily have joined in support
of a plan that is as practical as it is patriotic. Unless,
indeed, food conservation is intelligently and persistently
practiced, we cannot hope to win this war. This i the
plain" truth of the situation. Our battle fleets and flo
tillas of destroyers will do'their part when opportunity
offers; our armies in service abroad and in training at
home surely will reflect luster and glory uponAmerlcan
arms, and yet, when all is said and done, and the whole
field of .action is reviewed, we shall win or lose this wa:
exactly as we waste or save the nation's food supply.
Look upon the meatless Tuesday and wheatless Fri
day as an engagement with the enemy, and count a vic
tory or defeat for the common cause exactly in the de
gree in which you have kept the faith. One wheatless
day a week and one meatless day make up the slender
price that in our homes we are to pay as complete .in
surance against eatless days.
PECULATIONS OF
CLAMPITT EXPAND
IN SOME OPINIONS
That R. A. Climpit.'s peculations
extended over a period of some four
teen months, is the opinion of several
people who claim to have talked with
the former assistant postmaster be
fore his departure for Tucson, where
he is now in jail. Clampitt's exact
shortage is not known, except to tho
postoffice cfficials. and no statement
fan bo elicited from them.
Clampitt was taken to- Tucson on
Monday evening by Deputy United
States Marshal James McDonald.
Some.- misunderstanding has resulted
from the sta.ement yesterday that
Night Sergeant J. A. Kenipton made
the arrest of Clampitt alone. Both
McDonal and Sergeant Kenipton went
!o the property of - the Louisiane.
Arizona Copper company, some seven
miles west of Bisbee on the Tomb
stone road, and af er some mansuver
ing Kempton was taken to the spct
where Clampitt was staying. It is un
derstood that the former postoffice of
ficial did not want to rema'.n in jail
in Bisbee and did not wish to come
in'o the city during the daylight.
Kempton, in order to make the arrest
without any trouble, agreed that Clam
pitt should be brought down after
nightfall and until he went to Tucson
should not be placed in jail.
When Kempton and Clampitt came
to the place where McDonald was
standing the party broke in two, one
coming to Bisbee in one machine and
the others coming in the other car.
Kempton rode with Clampitt and Mc
Donald with the balance fcf the men
who were out in the canyon. Any in
ference that McDonald was anything
but efficient and active in the case
would be implying that which is ob
viously untrue. ,.. -
Clampitt was arraigned in the Unit
ed States federal court yesterday. The
erand jury is now in session and an
indictment will undoubtedly be re
turned against him. It is thought
certain that his trial will ,be held
during the present term of federal
court. He was unable to furnish bond.
J. 6. M'COMB GETS
PROMOTION; IS HOW
MAJOR OF REGULARS
J. Gordon McComb, U. S. A., who
has been in command of Company L.
35th Infantry, at Lowell for several
weeks.and who has won for himself
many friends in the Warren district
since his arrival, has received his
commission as a major in the regular
army, dating from August.
Coincidental with the information.
Major McComb's wife, who has been
in Seattle. Wash., for some months.
arrived in Bisbee to join him. Accom
panying Mrs. McComb is her mother.
Major McComb's promotion may
take him from his present command
at any moment. His commission reads
as a promotion to a major of infantry.
This may be taken to mean that he
will soon leave his present command,
possibly to go back to the 35th in
fantry or to some other unit of the
regular army.
Major McComb was stationed at
Douglas for many months with the
14th infantry. He has had a long rec
ord behind him and comes of one of
the best known military families in
the United States.

Edward F. Trefz, addressing a banquet In San Fran
cisco the other night, struck a keynote when he declared:
"I disagree With President Wilson that we are fighting
German autocracy, not the German people. I hold that
we are fighting the German people as well as the auto
cracy. If a nation supports such a militaristic institu
tion as Germany's it should be crushed." Trefz spent
several months in Germany just before the war and
knows something of what he is talking about. America
had just as well come to realize that the German people
were, at the beginning of tho war, as mad with prido '
and ambition and lust of conquest as their kaiser. Women
and children all over the empire sent the troops off to
ravish Belgium, with songs and flowers and smiles and
bursts of bombastic boasting. German celebrated from
center to circumference when the Lusitania was sunk.
The German people may be sick and tired of the war at
this time and they may be sick of their rulers, 1M they
have a passing strange May of showing It. The kaiser
was never stronger in his own land than he Is right now
with his hands red with butcheries and his soul bur
dened with crimes. Hi Italian victory has filled Ger
many with a lot of the old enthusiasm that has waned !
ever since the Marne. I-et us make no mistake about
the German people. If we stand by our government as
hard and close as they have stood ayd are standing to
day by theirs, we will win the war within two years as
sure as fate.

SCENE FROM "INTOLERANCE AT ORPHEUM TODAY AND THURSDAY
In the large cities where D. W. Grif
fith's "Intolerance" has played engage-,
mentis many m'jnths long it is known j
that many persons have seen this pro-1
duction two or three tlhies, and won-1
derment never ceases at the magni!i-
cence, the lavishness and the beauty j
of this play with its theme of lore's
struggles throughout the ages. "In
tolerance" will appear at ihe Orpheum
today and Thursday, matinee and even-1
ing, may not be compared with any
other production, for it surpasses any
thing ever attempted or achieved, and
therefore is absolutely unique. The
cast of principals includes the names
of many well-known stars, and thous
ands of men. women and children are
participants in the action of the four
parallel stories relating to Intolerance
in four w idely separated periods of the
world's history. It is pretty general
ly known that the ancient city of Baby
lon has been reproduced with a realism
that is astounding. Quice as success-
' ful has been the reverential treatment
of the reproduction of scenes in the
Holy Land, waen Christ walked among
1 the people. Then there is the massa
; ere of St. Bartholomew with Mediae
val Paris as the setting for many his
toric episodes. However, there is
quite as, much success in the presenta
tion of a thrilling story of today, with
; a western city of the United States as
I the locale. A finely trained orchestra

THE END OF
YOUR CORNS
Pain Stops at Once Corn
Gifts Off Clean.
There is nothing in the world like
"Gets-It" for corns. Just apply it ac
cording to directions, the pain stops
at once and then the corn !Ut3 off as
clean as a wnistie. io luss, no tArtli-
no danger. "Gets-It", you know
is safe. Millions have vsed it, more
than all other corn remedies combined,
and it never fails.
Doa-t Vi . Timr "HollerteaJS
-Gets-It" Never VmUm.
There is no need for you to go
through another day of corn agony.
But be sure you get "Gets-It." Accept
nothing else, for remember, there Is
positively nothing else as good. "Gets1
It" never irritates the live flesh, never
makes the toe sore.
You can go about as usual with work
or play, while "Gets-It", the magic,
does the work. Then the corn peels
right off like a banana skin, and
leaves the toe as smooth and cVrn-free
as your palm. Never happened before,
did It? Guess not.
Get a bof.le of "Gets-It" today from
any drug store, you need pay no more
than 25c or, sent on- receipt of price by
