WASHINGTON'. Jan. 2S. Amer
ica will hare an army of one-half
million In France early this year,
with a million more trained and
equipped ready to follow as quick
ly as ships can be provided to
carry them and the out'ook for
hips is not unpromising
Secretary H&ker pave this in
formation to the world today in a
statement before the senate mili
tary committee, bearing much that
until now has been carefully
guarded with the army's military
secrets, in answering charges that
the goTernment has broken down
preparing for war.
From early morning until late
afternoon the secretary addressed
the committee and a crowd, in
cluding many members of both
bouses of congress, gathered in a
big hearing room of the senate
office building. He spoke extem
poraneously, beginning with de
tails of the task of building an
army of a billion and a balf. an
swering such complaints of inef
ficiency as were cited by Senator
Cfcamberlan in bis recent spsech,
and declaring that such instances
were isolated and not general.
Some questions were asked, end
Vr. Baker from time to time had
assistants go to the telephone for
reports on specific questions.
Makes . General Statement
Then toward the close of the
day the secretary delivered a dra
matic general statement of the
American war plan, telling of the
coming of the allied missions, of
the day and night conferences
with men from the scene of bat
tle in which the plans now being
executed were adopted, and or
success beyond the most sanguine
expectations in building the army,
and its industrial superintendents
at home, transporting men across
the ocean, constructing railroads
in France and preparing to strike
the enemy with every resource at
the country's command.
When Mr. Baker closed it was
evident be had created a profound
imptession. Chairman Chamber
lain said so before he left the
stand. There was no attempt at
cross-examination. The chairman
proposed that the secretary be
given a rest, and it virtually was
agreed to recall him for further
examination later after the com
mittee has completed its hearings
of officers of the medical corps,
aviation section and other
branches of the service.
While many things disclosed
impressed the committee, it was
frankly aroaced when told that the
men of 32 national guard and na
tional army divisional camps are
ready to go at need. Members
wanted to know why such thmgs
had not been given publicity be
fore. Mr. Baker spoke of the re
luctance of military men to reveal
their war plans, and quoted Ger
man remarks about America's ad
vertisement of her preparations.
Emphasizing that be was not
there to defend himself or any
body else, the secretary urged the
committee again and again to lay
bare any shortcoming or failure
of the department that it might
be corrected. Frequently be
pause to seek stronger language
to describe the devotion of his
associates in the department, mili
tary and civilian.
Denies Wholesale Charge .
"For one reason or anther," he said,
"the impression has gone out into the
country, to some extent at least, that
the war department has fallen down.
"It would be a tragical thing if
this tremendous effort, this wholly un
precedented sacrifice made by men,
were in fact to turn out to deserve
the comment that it had fallen down."
Mr. Baker took personal responsi
bility for getting men under training
before their equipment was ready "to
the last shoe button." Such officers
as Maj. Gen. Leonard Wotod. he said.
had urged this policy. He described
conferences that evolved the ordnance
program and its fulfillment, submit
ting documents to prove that France
and Great BMtaia were supplying ar
tillery and machine guns for the first
forces a their own urgent request
in crier that ships might be usod 'or
other purpose?
In all that was done prir to the de-
parture or the nrst troops. General
Pershing shared in the deliberations
and approved the decisions reached.;
Mr. Baker dcclare-1. and now sur-i
rounded with

as the "eyes" of the army. Every
sten taken since has been founded on
tis long daily rable reports of what J
is going on at the fighting fronts. ,
Tables were cited to show that,
overcrowding in the camps and can-;
tonments had not been general ana
that the sickness had come mostly in '
the camps where medical opinion had '
agreed it was least to be expecaed.;
The history of the development and'
building of the cantonments was given
in detail to show that every precau-'
ticn possible had been taken. j
Analyzing the efforts of the ord-:
nance bureau, the secretary said that''
General Crozier had urged for years a
great artillery preparation; that ha
at least had realized the time gun-'
making required. But even France'
herself "with the enemy at herj
throat." be added, had not been ablej
to see what vast gun programs the j
war would lead into. I
Admits lllnes j
The secretary admitted that illness
at Camp Bowie was perhaps caused;
by too many men being housed in oje
tent together with a shortage in cloth
ing. "Our expectation was that the
men in the tents would be safe, but as
soon as it was discovered that the
boys were circumventing automatic
ventilation by closing down- the flaps
of the tents additional tentage was
ordered."
"Isn't it likely the men would not
have done this bad they had ade
quate clothing?" asked Senator Hitch
cock. I think it is entirely possible',
was the reply.
Senator Weeks asked if the pneu
monia epidemic did nt result from in
adequate hospital facilities.
"I don't think so," said the secre
tary. Secretary Baker said it was not

explaining that It was dne to prevent
soldiers from acting as regards cor

their home papers after censorship.
During his general statement of the
war plan and bow it was developed
Mr. Baker was rarely interrupted. He

country, each of them prior to that
time having been at peace with one

that an immediate plan should be
made in the United States for con

PcMce Commissioner Enright de

it was declared.
"In this city every year," the com
missioner declared, ""there are hun
dreds of girls lured from their homes

of other girls from all xver the coun

opportunities are lured from the path
of irtue and finally are found leading
a life of shame.
"At this very moment hundreds of
mothers whose heart9 are breaking

Says Bolsheviki
Move Is Sincere
After tRuss Trip
(By Review Leased Wire)
A PACiKiC rOKi, Jan. :i The
EoisLeviki movement is not being fos
tered by agencies favorable to Ger
many, according to Prcr. Edward A.
Ross, processor of sociology at . the
University of Wisconsin.
Professor Uoss arrived here today
from Russia, where be made a special
investigation of the Bolsheviki move
ment cn behalf of the American In
stitute of Social Service of New York.
Mvement Sincere
The Bolsheviki movement is sin
cere. Professor Ross said, springing
from the heart of Russia itself, and
having for its object the liberation
of the people, the establishment of
acrid peace and the institution of a
system of pure industrial socialism.
Tatiana and Olga Romanoff, daugh
ters of the former czar, were reported
to be espousing the Llolshetiki cause
and attending raoral ibeet'ings in
Tobolsk. Professor Ros said.
"Naturally enough." Professor Ross
said, '"the liolsseviki government is
composed of men with no great ex
ecutie ability, but men with this ex
perience are rapidly joining, and the
new government thus may be bolster
ed into permanence.
Trotzky Questioned
"In my interview with Trotrky. I
questioned him closely on lftaiters of
vital importance to the industrial life
of the cation.
"For instance. I asked him if he in
tended to dispossess all the owners
of fnctories and operate the plants
by the government.
" "No.' he said. 'We aim at strict
governmental control, but not govern
ment ownership Control by which!
;he owner will be allowed 5 or 6 per '
cent on his investment and by which i
ananeements will be made for de-,
terioration of plants and for new
plants when necessary.
"T asked Trotzky if it was the in-(
tenticn to allow the workmen to take
a share of the profits or the factories
9s their renumeration. 'No. he said
aga;n. 'Profit sharing is an outworn
theory. "The men will receive their
wages, but they will be reasonable
waees; enough to support them."

Says we cant help but look
' better and feel better
after an Inside bath. -
To look one's best and feel one's best
is to enjoy an inside bath each morn
ing to flush from the system the pre
vious day's waste, sour fermentations
and poisonous-toxins before it is ab
sorbed into the blood. Just as coal,
when It burns, leaves behind a ertain
amount of incombustible material in
the form of ashes, so the food and
drink taken each day leave in the ali
mentary organs a certain amount of
indigestible material, which if not
eliminated, form toxins and poisons
which are then sucked into the blood
through the very ducts which are in
tended to suck in only nourishment to
sustain the body.
If you want to see the glow of
healthy bloom in your cheeks, to see
your skin get clearer and clearer, you
are told to drink every morning upon
arising, a glass of hot water with a
teaspoonful of limestone phosphates
in it. which is a harmless means of
washing the waste material and toxins
from the stomach, liver, kidneys and
bowels, before putting more food into
' the stomach. "
Men and women with sallow skies,
liver spots, pimples or pallid complex
ion, are those who wake up with a
coated tongue, had taste, nasty breath,
-others who are bothered with head
aches, bilious spells, acid stomach or
constipation should begin this phos
phated hot water drinking.
A quarter pound of limestone phos
phate costs very little at the drug
store but is sufficient to demonstrate
that lust as soap and hot water cleans
es, purifies and freshens the skin on
the outside, so hot water and lime
stone phosphate act on the inside or

World War Wastes

Europe's
American Stock Raiser Co-operate
With Feed Administration in Con

lt Is probable that Europe for many
years after the war will look to a
great eiteat to America for its moat
"rPJ
Europe's herds ar dwindling under
war's demuuds faster than tbey can be
replenished.
When the German armies retired
from occupied portions of France and
Belgium approximately 1,800,XX) head
of cattle were appevpriated. This ad
dition virtually safeguarded Germany
from cattle shortage other nations now
suffer.
In England some .2.400.000 acres of
grass lands have by compulsory meas
ures been forced Into train production,
thus reducing pasturage and hay lands,
A declining scale of maximum meat
prices for live cattle was ordained in
England, as follows. For September,
$17.76 per hundred pounds; October,
S17.2S; November and December.
$10.08. and for January. $14.40. Tho
evident Intent of this measure was to
drive the beef animals into market
soon as possible.
According to official French fisuiva, '
the cattle of France have decreased to
a total of 1241.800 ss compared with
14.S07.000 In 1013. Today, due to lack
of forage principally. France is pro
ducing only one gallon of milk where
before the war two and one-half gal- .
ions were prouueeo.
Meantime the United States food ad-
ministration ha. taken step, to co-
crease their numbers. The stock breed- j
ers of this country show a disposition '
to co-operate with the government in 1
this.
For many years it has been a prac- j
tic among many of the dairy people ;
f this country to kill male calves at ,
birth and In many Instances the fe-
males if not needed to replenish their
herds rather than go to the expense of j
maturing them Into TeaL The high :
prices of meat caused the virtual d:a- j
continuance of this killing. Another
encouraging fact is 75 per cenL of i
calves killed for Teal this year were i
males. j
Somebody has very aptly said that
the wars of the world have been won
with grease, meaning that bacon and
lard have been as essential to success
In war as powder, which la true.
The hogs of Europe have been very
greatly sacrificed to present day needs.
This makps the American bnrien all
the more heavy and makes doubly es
sential an increased pork production
In this nation. In Italy grain Is now
forbidden to be fed to bogs. In Den
mark nnder a recent order one-fourth
of the hogs were ordered to be killed.
It is estimated that one-half have now
been killed.

DEMANDING FOOD AND PEACE.
Unrest in Germany, and especially in Austria, caused
by shortage of food demands consideration because It
promises to affect the xr policy of the two nations and
any peace proposals which may hare their support It
should be borne in mind that much or the recent testi
mony could not be suppressed, but was' permitted to be
published at home and sent by telegraph to the outside
world. We direct attention to parts of the evidence.
A German newspaper says that In the rural districts
and small towns children are pining away tor want of
food. Because there was no fodder, a great many cows
hare been killed. The death rate from diseases due to
malnutrition and from other ailments has 'risen sharply
Official figures for a group of cities show an Increase of
70 per cent for tuberculosis. When it was admitted that
Germany's cereal crops were very small, the govern
ment asserted that the deficiency would be filled in part
by the large yield of potatoes, but official reports now
prove that this was misleading, and the potato ration
was recently reduced, the crop having been less than
that of 1915 by 40 per cent. Even the embassies of
neutral nations at Berlin cannot get food enough for
health. They complain of chemical substitutes that
cause physical disability; '
In more than half of Austria Industry has been para
lyzed by strikes due to hunger and to disappointment be
cause expected peace has been delayed. More than 1,
000,000 workmen are idle, and 100,000 of these were em
ployed in Vienna and a neighboring city. The people
cry for food and peace. Many riots are reported. The
small bread ration was recently reduced by one-half
Germany's government has been denounced at public
meetings and attacked by the press because in peace
plans it asks for too much. Berlin newspapers have an
grily replied, one of them saying that such "Impertinent
Interference cannot be permitted." But very little news
about Austrian strikes and popular protests can be found
in the German press. Only two papers have made more
than a brief reference to what has been said and done
in Austria. One complains that the German people are
required to "go on stumbling in the dark;" another sees
Germany "menaced by complete political Isolation" If
peace conditions are not modified in accord wtin the
desires of Austria's people. "Peace means bread," say
the Austrians. And the censors are idle because those
in authority are more in sympathy with those whom
one journal calls "the tortured masses' than with Ger
many rulers.
Unsatisfied hunger and the suffering caused by it
may not force the Central powers to give up the fight,
hut food shortage and physical exhaustion may separate
Austria from Germany or modify the peace terms which
Prussian autocracy will consider or be willing to propose.
No longer can either nat:on look to neighboring neutrals
for food. The people of three of these are now on ra
tions. For neither Germany nor Austria can there be
relief before the next harvest, and in the coming few
months the conditions which now cause strikes, riots,
and demands for peace cannot be improved.
WHY UNIVERSAL SERVICE?
Yes, why? Stick up a peg there and skirmish for rea
sons. Why?
I hear a voice say that it is not fair that one should
bear the burden of two, therefore all should share alike
the burden of defense, says E. E. Harriman of the Vi
gilantes. An axiom. Not one in ten will try to combat
that theory.
Another says that acceptance of protection from the
commonwealth obligates the citizen to protect the com
monwealth in turn. Surely.
The disciple of physical perfection tells us that the
training makes better ruen and thereby hurries us
nearer the ultimate goal of perfection: that this guod
result is manifest in the. next generation and is thereal
highroad to follow. That the training makes the train
ed more alert, sclfreliant, keen of wit, therefore better
fined for any activity of life. All of which seems es
tablished. The man who hates war. yet retains a modicum of
stiffening in his spine and gray matter in his brain, be
lieves that universal service will give to the United
States a body of trained men that will be an effective
w amine to trespassers. Which is true provided that
we eliminate the Wilhelrastrasse propagators of rotten
ness that are striving to weaken every part of the na
tional structure.
But none of these things have touched the greatest
good of all, sure to follow the adoption of universal serv
ice under our form of government. All are good, all
r true, hut the l-est and true' of all. that which will
bring the most lasting good to every part of our nation
is this; that sectional, racial, and class distinctions will
be wiped out; that men will get to know each other's
true value and to know themselves in truer light.
When the boy from Atlanta and the boy from St
Paul, the one from Boston and the one from Los An
geles, the one from Naples and the one from Moscow,
the one from Auld Reekie and the one from Belgrade
are thrown into daily contact, doing the same things
and learning the same things, there will be a breaking
down of prejudices and an opening up 6! confidence.
Isnt it the verdict of the camps today? Have we not
seen the Jew from the Ghetto and the son of the mil
lionaire learn new and lasting respect for each other?
Have we not seen the college bred American boy and
the son of a Chinese truck gardener learn to see the good
in each other? Can we go back of the verdict of the boy
from an old American family, college bred and proud
of his blood, who said of a bunch of foreign born, "You've
got to hand it to those guys. They're in dead earnest
and they're all man, all the way through. Just crazy
to prove themselves good Americans, and take it all with
a grin. You like 'em when you get to know 'em."
Ah, that is the point, getting to know them, and
where do men pet to know each other as they do in
the training camp. unles3 it is upon the field of battle?
And to prove that we teed to know each other, jus
hark back to the remarks made before the war.
"It is always the poor man who has to do the righting,
while the rich loll at home and get richer."
"You can not expect anything from these uneasy
laborers in case of war. They won't do a thing but snarl
at the men who do the work of war preparation and
then they will hang back and let us do all the fighting
for them."
That is the way certain men of two classes talked. I
heard them. What are they doing now? Training hard
in the same cause 'and with sincere respect for each
other's virtues.
There is no better way to break down the wall of
partition that stands between rich and poor, educated
and ignorant, native born and foreign born, than to et
them at the same tasks, under the same conditions and
accord them the same treatment, with national safety
as the goal before them.
So we may sum the matter up in this way.
Universal service means bearing our own burdens, not
shirking them. It means doing our duty by the common
wealth which protects us. It means building a wall too
high and strong for tyrants to attack. It means giving
our young men stronger bodies, more alert minds, mere
self reliance. It means teaching them to value their
country and all its government means to the world. It
teaches them self discipline.
It brings to them a better understanding of each other
and keener appreciation of national aims and affairs. It
wipes out sectionalism. It brings home to every mm
native born, the truth that all the man from a foreign
cuntry needs, in the main, is a to get a thorough and
impartial understanding of ns and our ideals to make
one with us. It Is the heat, that fuses the mass within
the melting pot.
That's why UNIVERSAL SERVICE!
MAN, THE KILLER.
We have seen that since the time the pre-human ape
took to hunting, he and his human descendants ave
wroueht ruthless havoc among the lower animals, says
Harry Campbell in the Lancet, London. Here, again,
the sanction is just that of the other carnivora the
sanction of might the self-same sanction which permits
the tiger to kill the deer or the cat the mouse. Biologi
cally considered, the victims of man and the carnivore
generally have just the same right to a place in the
sun as their victimizers. Man may perhaps console him
self somewhat for his indulgence in this wholesale
slaughter by the reflection that if a race of superior be
ings were to descend upon this planet they would as
suredly very speedily enslave or destroy the human race;
and still more from the consideration, already urged,
that it has been essentially through bloodshed that man
has raised himself above the ape.
Von Hertling has spoken. Spoken for a Germany full
of fight and recovered, thanks to her troops available
from the Russian rront, from the awful slaughter in
flicted by the allies at Ypres and Messines and Arras
and Cambrai and Cbemin des Dames and Verdun last
year. Germany now feels that she can hold what she
has taken, so her peace feelers or yesterday are her war
mouthings of today. Czernin has spoken for an Austria
torn by dissension and weakened by terrible losses and
unnerved by what she has been through and yet faces her
if she continues to right So he spoke softly and subtly
and placatingly. But under his thinly veiled peace talk
it Is readily seen the -lose coalition with tfie Prussian,
still unbroken and unbreakable as far as the government
is concerned. Austrian strikes and cries for peace are
disquieting to the powers that be. but they are not strong
enough or determined enough to cause any real concern.
Austria elects still to stick with the Hun and pav the
price for a right to a finish against civilization.
BISBEE IS PLACED
IN THE, DENVER
ZONE OF RAILROADS
Under orders or the director gen
eral or railrcad-. working through tn
sub-ccnimittee of railway car servi.-e.
a system of zo"e en.bargces became
effective yesterday.
Ilisbee is placed in the Denver zoni.
and J. M. Brown, receiver of the Den
ver & Rio Grande, is made chairman
of the zone.
How Embargo Works
Under the new system, which is
desrsned to prevent congestion at any
ane prin t or gateway, any railroad
!n a zone inav declare an embargo
en anv class of freight through its
iisirk't. Immediately a report of the
embargo is transmitted to the cta!r
man of the zone and to connecting
lines. The chairman transmits the
order by telegraph to chairmen ot
ether zones, shutting off immediately
at shipping points all freight of the
embargoed class going to the railroad
announcing the embargo When the
snbargo is lifted similar notice is
given and the freight may start.
It is expected that the first result
cf the system will be to hold up ship
ments in store houses and in the
rands of shippers so that they will
not tie up car space that cannot be
moved.
The second result is that wnen the
ines nre cleared of other classes of
freight, the previously embargoed cars
will move rapidly through to the point
?f destination. All the cars will be
unloaded under heavy penalty for de
murrage. McAdoo Can Veto
The director general has reserved
the right to veto all embargoes and
rdace a general embargo against ail
freight in favor of a shipment rushed
through by the government, thereby
holding all" freight in shippers' hands
until the government freight Is out
of the w ay.
In proclaiming an embargo it wi'.l
be necessary for the railroad to give
reasons for the declaration and thei
-hPirman of the zone has the right
to cancel the embargo, but it is not
expected that this will be done.
In connection with the embargoes
heretofore esteblisbed it is reported
that the congested railroads in the
east have shown a reluctance to carry
corper between Arizona points and t!:c
big refinerv and reduction works in
the east No actual embargoes have
been placed, however.
It was explained yesterday that tin
der the old system of embargoes a
railroad might declare an embargo on
a certain class of freight t his con
necting lines. The latter would hold
back freight and notify its connections
ty mai'. By the time it had been
transmitted throughout the United
Siates. freight would be congested
throughput the cqnntry. In the aggre
gate the number of cars held in the
yards amounted to thousands In some
eases, leaving some districts without
cars and other districts with loaded
cars awaiting orders to move.

with suggestions, to see whether they;
could devise on this side something ,
which had not been thought ot over

"They had to be hospitable to sng-j
gestions which came from the other
side; they had to confer with the for-1
eign officers who were here and were
constantly being changed, so that men
fresh from the front could be here to
advise with us. and in addition to that
every one of them had to be a univer-
sitv professor, going out into the life

who had mechanical experience and
knowledge and training, but not mili

"As a consequence, this, little group
which stayed here have built the great

ordnance department, starting. I think '
with ninety-three or ninety-six offic

something like 3000 officers. They
have had to be trained: they have had

niendous response to the changing con

"In the meantime, when we started
into this war 1 think it was commonly
thought throughout the ountry that ,
j our contribution at the outset might
well be financial and Industrial. The
industries of this country were largely
devoted at that time to the appropri
ate industries, and many converted in
dustries were largely devo'ed to the'
manjficture of war materials for our
allies.
"As I suggested this morning when
we went into that market we found it .
largely occupied, so that our problem
was not going to a shoe factory and
saying "make shoes for us.' but it was
going to a factory which never made
shoes, because all the shoe factories
were busy making shoes for people
from whom we could not take thorn,
and saying. 'Learn how to make t hoes
in order that you may make them for
us.'
"Now. of ourse. that Is not true of
shoes, but it is true of machine guns,
it is true of other amis, it is true of
ammunition, it is true of forging ca
pacity, which was the greatest defect
In the country and all of this time we
had not merely to disturb the program
of allied manufactui-r In thih country,
but we had not to cut off the supplies
of raw material to our allies, and we
hid not to disturb the industry of this
country, to such an extent that pro
ducts upon which they dependfd for
success of their military operations
would be interfered wiih. both agri
cultural and industrial and commercial
products.

the whole plan ot the war department .
has been flavored with a desire to hold '
off until the allies finish the war for

"You see. the editor was dealing
with what he supposed to be the inten-'
tion of the war department at that
time, that we were holding off so far
as actual military operations were con-;

"That Is the year 1917. 1 tell no '

to everybody in this group that we
have far exceeded what in August,

ideal that the editor of this magazine '
refers to It as a thing which we ought
to have strained every nerve in a vain

Reason For Change
"Why did we decide to send some
troops to France in 1917? It is no se
cret. When Marshal Jollre came to
this country from France, when the
British mission came from France,
they told us of a situation which we
Jr. 1 had not up to that time fully appre
ciated. There had been in France re
cently conducted before that an unsuc
cessful major offensive. The French
people had suffered, oh. suffered in a
way that not only our language is not
adapted to describe, but our imagina
tion cannot conceive. The war is in
their country. This wolf has not only
been at their door, but he has been ;
gnawing for two years and a half at
their vitals, and when this unsuccess
ful offensive in France had gone on
there was a spirit, not of surrender.

and so they said to us: 'Frankly, it

could have sent over, as Great Britain

Barracks Erected
"We have had to build barracks ov
er there for our soldiers, and in the
meantime to billet them around in the
French villages. Building barracks ov
er there and building them here is a
very different thing, gentlemen.
"When we summoned the lumber in
dustry of this country to prod-tiee the
lumber to build our own cantonments,
it came in a great and steady stream
from all over the country, but. when
we talk about building barracks in

the homes and hearts of the people
among whom they live. No such re

army and a civilian population as ex
ists with regard to this.
"And then, with your aid. the army
has been able to practically stamp
out intemperance and vice among the
soldiers, by the establishment ot
zones, by the establishment of patrol
systems of one kind and another, by
the training of these youug officers

sizes, transporting it to the places
where it is to be used, and then finally
using it.
"We have had to go back to the
planting of the corn in France in or
der thatwe might sometime make a
harvest. Our operations began in the
forests of France, not in the lumber
yards as they did in this country.
Pershing's Staff
"That great staff under General
Pershing's direction, containing so nit-

send a regular division, but not to
send over the whole regular army at
that time, .
"Then what happened was that Teg

that those railroads were used to the
maximum to take care of the needs of
the French and the British themselves
and that when our army became a
great army, it would be necessary for

"In other words. France was a white

naturally reserved the best ports in
France tor their own .supply. The
channel ports have been reserved for
the British. When we came in it was
necessary for as to have independent
ports ot entry in order that there
might not be confusion and admixture
of our supplies, going through these
ports of disembarkation with those of
other nations. We were given several
ports. As you perhaps recall, the port
of France are tidal ports, ports with
deep water and tidal basins at high
tides with insufficient water tor land
ing at the docks when the tide is out
Tel a: of Construction
"As consequence, the construction
of docks and wharves in ports ot that
kind is very much more difficult than
where ycu have a deep sea harbor,
and all you need to do is to erect a
pile wharf. We have had to build
docks; we have had to fabricate in this
country and send off dockhandling ma
chinery, we have had to send from
this country even the piles to build the
docks. We have had to have gauntry
cranes manufactured in this country
and sent over to be erected on those
docks; we have had to erect over there
warehouses at the ports of disembar
kation in order that these vast accum
ulations of stores and supplies which
go over can be properly housed and
cared tor. -until they can be distributed
into the interior.
"We have had to take over, and are
nas neen necessary tor the surgeon
general's staff to be divided in this
fashion and to select supplies and pro
care materials, and to send over staffs
ot trained persons to supervise the
construction ot these hospitals and to
man and equip them. AU of that has
gone on contemporaneously with the
work which has been done in this
nave never seen anything like this.
mat the disciplinary problems or the
army are reduced to a neglible quan
tity and instead of the melancholy and
pathetic parade through the secretary
of war's courtmartial after court mar
tial, of men who have fallen down and
yielded to temptation under these un
usual circumstances, which nsd to

Here at the request of the chairman.
Mr. Baker put into the record a state
ment showing the number of hospit
als army and Red Cross, established
In France, with the number of the per
sonnrj of each.
- The recretary then resumed his
testimony.
"When Lord Northcliffe returned to
I England, he was invited, as I recall
I it. by Lloyd-George, to accept a posi
tion in his cabinet. He wrote a let
ter which was printed in the papers,
and in that he made this casual ref
erence to the I'nited States. He
spoke of our war preparations in this
fashion:

men
more or less used to the situation cre
ated by the uncertainty of Russia,
there came the great Italian defeat
which called for even greater changes
in our plans, in many ways.
"So that what might have been a
perfectly acceptable plan as to major
operations prior to the change in the
Russian situation or prior to the
change in the Italian situation, had to
be re-studied instantly, and tor that
reason, among others, there is now re
organized as you know, in France,
pursuant to the suggestion of Mr.
; Lloyd-George, the Rapello conference

l.nited States is represented on that
by the chief ot staff ot the American
army and the major international ar
rangement in regard to the military
are worked out there while General
Pershing and his staff ot experts are
working out those other questions.
On This Side.
"That is a picture of what has been
going on over there, gentlemen. On
this side much of that has had to be
done, and in addition to it. all the
things we have done, and I ask vou
to remember among the achievements
of this side, is the buitdihg of this
army, not of 50.000 or 100.0t0 or 500.
000. but of substantially a million and
one half men.
"And now let me be frank with you.
and let your judgment be frank with
me about this. Has any army in his
tory, ever, since the beginning of
time, been so raised and cared for as
this army has? Can the picture be
duplicated? We have raised this army
taking the regular army and the na
tional guard, raising it to war strength
and supplementing it by the operation
of a draft, and there are senators In
this room who said to me with grief
when we proposed that that form or
raisinr the soldiers should be had
they shook their heads and said 'Mr.
secretary, it can't be done. It is too
sudden to address to the American
people that mode or selecting sol
diers. Aud yet. has any great enter
prise within the knowledge of any
man in this room ever been carried
out with more unfailing Justice, with
more intelligent explanation and com
mendation to the good sense of patrio
tism of the American people, and has
any great and revolutionary change
In our mode of practice evr beon

operation of the selective service svs-:-m?

take in dealing with American mat
ters and they say:
"'While the news about American
war preparations, suhc as the organiz
ing and outfitting of an army of one
million men strong, to reinforce the
Fren-h-English front is looked upon
in that form as bluff the spreading of
which may unfavorably affect the
rpinion of the German people, yet the
Tact must not be overlooked on the
otber hand that the I'nited States
with the support of its capacity for
material and industrial management
is arming itself for war with great en
ergy and tenacity.
"Your committee will have full op
portunity, and will doubtless go into
those things. If you will deal wtrh
the hospital situation, the medical
corps, the signal corps, you will hear
the wonderful work done by the en
gineering department of the army.
"When it is all told. Mr. chairman,
it will be a story which I am sure
your committee will be glad to report
to the senate of the I'nited States as
being a tremendous response to a
tremendous responsibility, and when
you have made this investigation I
know that the American people will
feel, as I think they have a richt to
feel that we are in this war to ain
it. that we are in it to hit and to hit
hard, that we are in it to co-ordinate
our strength with that of our asso
ciates, that the problem is not one of
individual star playing, but of team
play, with these veterans and ex
perienced persons under actual battle
conditions; that more has been done,
perhaps, than the country expected,
more than the wisest in the country
thought was possible to do.
No Division of ounseL 1
"Insofar as I am personally concern
ed. I know what is ahead of us. I
know what the American feeling about
this war is. Everybody is impatient
to do as much as we can. There will
be no division of counsel: there will
be all the criticism there ought to
be upon shortcomings and failures,
there will be. so far as the war de
partment is concerned, a continuing
effort at self, improvement, and hos
pitality toward every suggestion for
improvement that can come from the
outside, but the net result is going
to be that a united and confident
American people, believing in them
selves and in their institutions, are
going to demand, and that at no late
day. en European battlefields, in the
face of veterans though they be, they
not excel us in achievement, and when
the victory is won over there. Mr.
chairman, the credit which will come
to American enterprise and to Amer
ican encourage will be an honor to
us as the tenacity of purpose and
splendid achievements of the British
and French already shed great lustre
on the names of the great people. SEVEN

William Alien, who was a resident
cf the Warren district up to tre lat

is now a suesi of the department of
iustice a.-n at Ncgales. 1 nd will

he stands a good chance of tve:-nii

Arix.. as the sheriffs offiee wants him
for an alleged embezzlement in this
city.
Allen came to Bisbee about six
weeks ago from Douclas. He has
been mikine the rcitnds between !is
fcee. Naco. Douglas and NogaU-s for
the pst six months. He worked out
of Naco Jrst 0-tcber and is a'lege-1 to
have appropriated a quantity of clothes
that d'd not belong to him. When te
came here he secured a room at e
Ozark House and became a member
of the Y. M. C. A. He worked a few
shifts for the Copper Queen company
as a mucker and then quit. He then
started out to go into, business for
hinsclf. He went to a number of busi
ness houses in the district and repre
sented himself as a salesman and
wanted to solicit tra-le on commis
sion. He visited the music store o?
W'lliam Muir on Main street, but was
old there was nothing doing, but in
sisted on taking some piano cata
logues, and also took a number of
piano contracts without the knowl
edge cf Mr. Muir. He then tisited
several other places. ani finally went
to Fruitman's I adies Tailor shop in
the Hughes block and ased to b
given a chance to sfll goods on com
mission. He was told there was noth
ing doiri; by Mr. Frultman. but when
the latter was out he came back and
and secured about $100 worth of la
dies' wearing apparel and said that
Mr. FrriTman tad given his consent.
Vron Mr. Fruitman's return he found
out that Allen had secured the goods
and started out to Incite Mm. It was
discovered that he had left his room,
staf'ne that he was going to Douglas.
Realizing that he was trying to get
away, Fniitman went down and swore
o'i a complaint for e-nbezzlement and
the warrant was p'aced in the rard3
f the sheriff's office for service.
Wcrd was sent to Douglas and Tuc
son to took out for him.
Yesterday moTiirvT Chief of Police
James Allison received a letter from
Nogales asking about Alien, and st st
ir, g that he had been arrested as an
aUen enemy and wanted his move
ments here checked up. The cit;
TTisrshRl of Docelas was then notified
that he vras wanted here by the sher
iff's office. He is still in the custody
of the department o' justice men and
will be given a hearing befcre a Unit
ed States commissioner today, and if
he is not ordered interned be wi'l be
delivered to the oficers of this coun
ty. When Allen went to Nocalcs t
crossed ever the line into Sonora
without securing a passport, and also
returned the same way when he was
rrcsed. He stopped over night in
Nocales. Sonora., but .has refused so
far to state where he stayed and the
officers so far have teen unable to
find out either. The suitcase which
he took with him has not been locat
ed, but is believed to be on the other
side of the line.
When word was received here of his
being detained as an alien enemy his
room in the Ozark House was search
ed yesterday morning by representa
tves of the department of justice and
the sheriff's office, but nothing of an
incriminating nature was found. He

WEATHER STOPPED THEM
The Bisbee Nimrods that had
planned to go to McNeal on Sunday
to take part In the rabbit drive de
cided that the weather was too bad
for them, and as a consequence they
did not go. The McNeal residents
have found a new way to make it
rain in that section, and that is to
advertise a rabbit drive. On three
occasions now they have sent out no
tice of the drive, and in each instance
it has met the response with a rain
or snowstorm. The rabbits seem to
have the biccest pull in the events
scheduled so far.

would have for his wife, John Rand plunged onward in
