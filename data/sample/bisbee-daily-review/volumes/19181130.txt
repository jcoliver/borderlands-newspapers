GEN. TA8KER H. BLISS, WHO
NOW IS IN PARIS
NOT. POSSIBLE BEFORE
PRESIDENT EXPLAIN8 THAT AN
NOUNCEMENT COULD NOT BE
MADE PREVIOUSLY BECAUSE
OF IGNORANCE AS TO HOW
MANY DELEGATES GOING
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29. The
representatives of the United
States at the peace conference '
will be:
PRESIDENT WILSON.
ROBERT LANSING, secretary
of state.
HENRY WHITE, former ambas
sador to France and Italy.
E. M. HOUSE.
GEN. TASKER H. BLISS, rep
resentative of the American army
at the supreme war council at
Versailles.
This announcement 'was made to-!
night at the white house. In the ab
Bcence of any official explanation, it
was assumed that the president goes
as president of the United States and
that Secretary Lansing, Mr. White
and Colonel House and possibly also
General Bliss will be delegates with
ambassadorial rank.
It was recalled that the president's
announcement that he would go to)
France "for the purpose of taking
part in the discussion and settlement
of the main features of the treaty of
peace" and that It was not likely that
he could remain throughout the ses
sions of the peace conference, 'and
that he would be accompanied by
delegates who will sit as the repre
sentatives of the United States
throughout the conference.
The white house announcement fol
lows. "It was announced at the executive
bfflces tonight that the representa
tives of the United States at the
peace conference would be: The
president himself, the secretary of
state, the Hon. Henry White, recently
ambassador to France; Edward M.
House and Gen. Tasker H. Bliss."
It was explained that ' it had not
been possible to announce these ap
pointments before because the num
ber of representatives each of the
chief belligerents was to send had
until a day or two ago been under
discussion.
White House officials would add
nothing to the formal statement and
no one professing to be in the confi
dence of the president would talk.
There was only one surprise in the
statement the appearance of the
name of General Bliss as one of the
representatives. It had been taken
for granted that the general military
representative of the United States on
the supreme war council would take
part In the discussion at Versailles,
but the general opinion had been that
be would be attached to the delegation

II IS
Believe With Moderate Pre
cautions, Epidemic Can Be
Relieved; New Precaution
ary Measure'
At a meeting held last evening
at the city council chambers, at-
tended by members of the city
council., the city and county health
officers and other physicians, to
discuss the iufluenza situation.
It was decided that the quaran
tine should be kept in force for. at
least ten days longer, or until
Monday, December 9, and in some'
instances that the rules of the
quarantine would be made a little
more stringent so that conditions
might continue to improve.
It was the opinion of the doctors
present that the situation in the War
ren district had shown marked im
provement In the last week notwith
standing the bad weather conditions,
and that the number of new cases was
rapidly diminishing. Most of the
new cases were among persons who
had been in houses where they had
been exposed. This, however, did not
apply to the Mexican residents, as it
was shown that the disease had just
begun to make Its inroad in that sec
tion of the population. One doctor
of. the C. & A. staff visited 15 cases
of pneumonia In Tintown yesterday.
Low Death Rate.
The death rate in the district, ac
cording to the doctors, has been kept
remarkably low in comparison with
other sections of the world. The rate
in the Warren district has been about
IV2. per cent, while In the majority of
places it has averaged from 5 to 6,
and even as high as 10, per cent.
The first death in the district from
influenza or diseases derived there
from occurred on October 9. From
that date to October 31. inclusive,
there were 46 deaths. From Novem
ber 1 to 15 there were 36 deaths, and
for the past 15 days there were 18
deaths. The examination of the
deaths will show that the disease is
on the decline and it was thought
best by those who are in a position
to know that the situation should be
kept in control and the lid be kept on
so that a further reduction could be
made. !
Have Trying Experiences.
The general public has no Idea what
the doctors of the Warren district
have experienced In the handling of
the influenza wave since It struck
here. Doctors have gone Into houses
and found entire families stricken
with the disease. Father and mother
in bed together not able to raise a
band to assist the children of the
family, who also were sick; not able
to get them a bite to eat. The doc
tors have been compelled to play
nurse, housemaid and cook; have had
to wash and clean' the children, cook
for them, go out of the house and get
food and take it to the house and
then prepare It for the different mem
bers of the family; change the bed
linen, etc., that had been mussed be
cause help could not be secured to
send to the homes. The physicians
have worked night and day and have
held the conditions down and now
that the wave Is on the decline, they
were unanimous of the opinion that
as the quarantine is doing good it

However, Washington Has
Not Been Advised of Desire
on Part of Chile-Peru for
Good Offices
Rv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 29. If the
Peruvian government has dispatched
any message to the American govern
ment, concerning dispute between
Peru and Chile over the provinces of
Tacna and Arica it has not yet reach
ed the state department.
Officials here decline to discuss the
controversy between the South Amer
ican republics until the matter has
been brought officially to the atten
tion of this government. It is known,
however, the several reports bearing
on the dispute have been received
from representatives of the United
States in both countries. - v '
Some diplomatic observers suggest
ed today that in any settlement of the
question undertaken the interests of
Bolivia probably would be considered
since originally the disputed provinces
were part of that country and furnish
ed it an outlet to the Pacific.
Unofficially it was said that circum
stances might lead the United States
to take action in au effort to compose
the difficulties between Chile and
Peru upon the invitation from one of
the ntaions that it use its good offices.
In the usual custom action would be
taken only upon invitation from both
governments, but in this case, it was
said, the American government might
upon request of one of the countries
suggest to the other its willingness to
act.

REVENUE BILL
IS COMPLETE AND
GOES TCM PRINTER
Committee Lines Up Again
on Strictly Party Lines With
Republicans Resisting 1920
Limit
(flv Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 29. The sen
ate finance committee tonight com
pleted revision of. the war revenue
bill, designed to raise $6,000,000,000 in
taxes in 1919 and about $4,000,000,000
in 1920. The measure as virtually re
written to meet changed conditions
attending the end of the war, now
goes to the printer and will be re
ported to the senate next week, prob
ably on Thursday.
The republicans lined up solidly in
opposition to inclusion of 1920 tax
rates in the bill, it was conceded
that discussion in the senate will de
lay the measure and many senators
expressed doubt it can be enacted
before March 3, the date of the end
ing f the 65th congress.
In view of the expected delay, sen
ate leaders and treasury department
officials are concerned over collect
ing taxes next year and unless the
new law is enacted before January 1
collections must be made under the
present revenue bill the yield from
which is only about $4,000,000,000.
Several expedients, including adop
tion of emergency legislation are un
der consideration.
"Sehator Simmons said tonight he
doubted whether republicans would
file a minority report attacking the
1920 tax program but might content
themselves with vigorous opposition
to that proposal on the floor of the
senate.
In completing the hill today, the
finance committee adopted an amend
ment establishing new second clas
postage rates, effective when the
revenue bill recomes law. It provides
for repeal of the present graduated
zone rates on newspapers, magazines
and other periodicals and substitutes
a rate of one cent per pound within
an area of 200 miles from mailing
points and one-half cent a pound out
side that area.
The committee rejected another
amendment for restoration on July 1,
1919. of the two cents an ounce rates
on letters and one cent on postcards.
Some senators believe the second
clas.-i postal rate amendment will be
opposed by publishers as unjust and
discriminatory. Long debate on the
subject is anticipated.
Another amendment adopted today
and expected to cause much debate
imposes a tax of 10 per cent on pro
ducts of child labor which are trans
ported in interstate commerce. The
amendment is designed to accomplish

B. Geijsbeek. consul for Holland
for the states of Colorado, Utah

night that he had mailed hi res
ignation to the Dutch legation at
Washington because of his gov
ernment's action in harboring the
former German emperor and be
cause of other acts of the Nether

Mr. Geijsbeek also disclosed that
the Netherlands government is pre

a newspaper campaign in the United
States to "justify its action in giving
shelter and protection to William

Mr. Geijsbeek said this campaign
had been started with a note sent to
the consuls recently, with instructions
to offer it to the newspapers for pub
lication by W. De Beaufort, charge
d'affaires of the Netherlands in the
United States, explaining that the for

Holland as a private citizen and was
given the same refuge available to all

Soldiers Will Return to This
Country Via Boston, New
York, Newport News and
Charleston
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 29. Bos
ton, New York, Newport News,
Va., and Charleston, S. C, are the
ports the war department now
plans to use for the return of the
army from overseas. Even with
this wide distribution of the strain
on port facilities and transporta
tion, however, and with German
ships now idle in German harbors
employed on the task, estimates
show that the last of the army
could not possibly reach the Uni
ted States in less than eight
months. Conservative calcula
tions upon which preparations by
the department probably will be
based, fixed ten months as the
minimum.
These estimates have been made
wholly on the basis of the physical
difficulties to be overcome and do not
take into consideration the question
of the retention in Europe for some
time of an American force which may
be agreed upon at the peace confer
ence. If the return movement, already
commenced, is continued at full speed,
the last division, in all probability
could not reach the United States be
fore October, 1919.
Decision to route the troops to their
homes through the four ports mention
ed Is understood to have been based
on two main considerations. First,
they have been constructed to handle
the transports and the men, and sec
ond, they are the natural gateways to
the country, each fed by an indepen
dent rail system ramifying back
through geographically independent
sections of the United States By
loading the ships as far as possible
with men from the same general sec
tion, it will be possible, army officers
say, to avoid cross-carrying and dis
ruption of normal traffic in getting
the soldiers from the ships to their
homes.
In estimating for transport tonnage
available for the movement, officials
have not only looked ahead to the new
ships which will be delivered during
the demobilization period by the ship
ping board, but also upon idle German
ships, including two new and large
liners reported to have been complet
ed except for some details of .equip
ment. Among the known German
steamers is the Imperator, almost as
large at the Vaterland, now the Levia
thian. The two new German liuers
are of approximately the same size
as these craft. Each of these four
could carry nearly 10,00 men a trip.
The German vessels, eastbound aft
er unloading American troops would
carry food supplies to be allotted Ger-
j many.

NEWCASTLE. England, Nov. 29.
In a speech delivered here this even
ing. Premier Lloyd George dealing
with the question of the responsibility
for trie invasion of Belgium said the
British government had consulted
some of the greatest jurists of the
kingdom and they unanimously and
definitely had arrived at the conclu
sion that in their judgment the former
German emperor was guilty of an in
dictable offense for which he ought to
be held responsible.
Germany must pay the cosi me
war to the limit of her capacity. Pre
mier Lloyd George declared.
The submarine pirates must be
punished ,the premier added, and who
ever devastated the lands of another
country ought to be responsible.
Referring to the authors of the war,
Mr. Lloyd George said the govern
ment intended that the investigation
to be conducted should be perfectly
fair but a stern one and that it should
go on to its final reckoning.
Mr. Lloyd George said Germany
would not be allowed to pay her in
demnity by dumping cheap goods in
this country.
The premier, defending unionist
members of the cabinet, said he would
trust this men who for two years had
helped him to carry out great and
progressive measures until he saw a
better reason than he did now for sus
pecting them.
Asked "What about free trade?" the
premier added:
"I am prepared to examine every
problem, to cast aside any prejudice
or pre-conceived ideas and examine
them purely upon the facts as the
war has revealed them to us."

MISERY
Every Necessity of Life Was
So Expensive Ordinary Peo
ple Could Not Obtain It,
Says Traveler
BERNE. Nov. 29. (By the As
sociated Press.) Food was so ex
pensive in Vienna that a meager,
unpalatable and ur atisfactory
meal cost from S4 up. Clothes
were so scarce a mediocre suit
cost S50C, and shoes $60 to $93.
Commonest necessities were so
difficult to obtain one had -to
stand in line for hours to pur
chase a tiny portion at an ex
orbitant price.
Such were affairs in Vienna just
before the armistice was concluded,
as related to the correspondent by the
last American to leave Austria., lie
is a member of the diplomatic service
who was assigned to remain at the
Austrian capital .when war was de
clared and has just come to Switzer
land. No story yet told of conditions in
Vienna can even remotely approxi
mate actual facts as described by this
eye witness, whose account was given,
perhaps uuconsciously, a dramatic
climax by the declaration that despite
the indescribable sufferings and hard
ships, Vienna still has horse racing,
attended by greater crowds than in
peace times. These crowds walk
eight mile to the race track and bet
thousands of crowns instead of hun
dreds, as formerly, in their feverish
desire to forget the misery caused by
the war.
Austria quit, declares the diplomat,
because it was a physical impossibil
ity to continue further. Not only was
Austria without food, but without the
commonest necessaries. It faced win
ter in almost nakedness, so scarce
had clothing become. Before he left
Vienna the correspondent's informant
disposed of nearly every article of
clothing he possessed. The demand
for clothing may be judged from the
fact that he realized from fZ to $4
each for neckties four years old and
which originally cost $1 apiece; $100
for a ten-year-old suit costing $25,
$1'60 for a Tuxedo costing $100. and
$100 each for three suits bought in
Vienna three years before and which
were shiny, ragged and worn out.
OH socks, costing $1.25 and which
Uad teen darned, sold for $5 a pair.
An overcoat two and a half years old,
which cost $21. sold for $110. Badly

NEW YORK. Nov. 29. Hotels in
this city will refuse to comply with
the order of Postmaster General Bur
lesou that they charge not more than
five cents for telephone calls, accord
ing to an announcement tonight by
attorneys for the Hotel Association of
New York City.
Tne announcement said that all
members of the association have been
advised to ignore Mr. Burleson's or
der, effective December 1, because in
the opinion of the association's at
torneys, the postmaster general "has
no legal authority to fix telephone
rates in New York state."
- Charles J. Campbell, one of the at
torneys, explained that, in his opin
ion, the power to fix rates is a part
of the state's I police powers and that
the Aswell resolution, under which
Mr. Burlesou acted in taking over
the telephone system, "expressly ex
cepts from hs jurisdiction the exer
cise of the police powers of the state."
The only authority to fix rates in j
New York. Mr. Campln-ll declared, is
vested in the state public service com
mission. It is claimed that the high
cost of maintaining hotel tell phone
service makes, the present ten. cent
rate imperative.

CONTRACTS HAVE

Picking of Flaws in Govern
ment's Method of Proced
ure Causes Confusion in
Peace Program
(By Review I .eased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 29 The gov
ernment's maturing program for can
celling big war orders with the mini
mum of disturbance to business con
ditions was thrown into confusion to
day by a decision of Comptroller War
wick of the treasury, that thousands
of orders placed by telegram, tele
phone or mail are not legally binding
and that consequently they may not
be recognized through the negotia
tion of terminating contracts without
special legislation by congress. Offi
cials estimated that hundreds of mil
lions of dollars in contracts are in
volved. At the same time Secretary Baker
announced that the war department
will direct its own cancelling of con
trails "in a spirit of fairness and
helpfulness to all concerned."
Attorney General Gregory will be
asked to pass on this apparent con
flict between the law, as strictly in
terpreted by Comptroller Warwick,
whose authority grows out of his
supervision of payments from the
treasury and the desire of the war
department to terminate contracts
both those backed up by formally
sipned documents and those under
taken on informal agreements by
making some sort of a lump sum pay
ment to the contractor.
If legislation is found to be neces
sary, it is said an attempt will be
made to rush it through congress im
mediately to avoid holding up the
government's great industrial demob
ilization and readjustment plans.
Comptroller Warwick has explained
that a contract, to be le?al. must "be
reduced to writing with the names of
the parties signed at the end," and
that "a signing by proxy is considered
by this oitice as not permissible."
Thousands of contracts have been
signed in this manner by proxies of
the army officers duly authorized by
the .secretary of war. The name of
the officer in these cases was type
written at the uid of the contract, and
a minor officer actually sipned on
behalf of the authorized contracting
officer. The only documents many
I manufacturers have to support their
contracts consist of letters instruc ting
I them to proceed with certain orders
for war materials, at certain price,
j or on the basis of a percentage of
profit, bearing the signature of a sub
ordinate officer beneath the typed
name of the real contracting officer.
It was explained that in the-rush of
war preparations this system was
necessary in the interest of speed.
The comptroller found other faults
with the proposed contract, inasmuch
as it failed to reserve to the govern
ment rights to recover over-payments
or to credit the value of materials re
maining property of the contractor.

Mr. Lloyd George said the interests

that It should be made perfectly plainly ... .J." "l "L3E
that the people who acted in this way
merited punishment for the damage
they had inflicted.
The second question was the ques
tion of indemnities, the premier add
ed that in every court of justice
throughout the world the party was
lost which had to bear the cost of
litigation. When Germany defeated
France she established the principle
and there was no doubt that the prin
ciple was the right one. Germany
must pay the cost of the war up to the
limit of her capacity.
"There is a third and last point,"
continued Mr. Lloyd George. "Is no
one to be made responsible for the
war? Somebody has been responsible
for a war that has taken the lives of
millions of the best young men of
Europe. Is not anyone to he made
responsible for that? If not, all I can
say is that if that is the case there is
one justice for the poor wretched
criminal and another for kings and
emperors."
Mr. Lloyd George declared in con
clusion: "I mean to see that men who did
treat our prisoners with humanity are
to.be made responsible. I want this
country to go to court with a clean
conscience, and she will do so. There
is not a stain on her record. We will
not be afraid to appear before any
tribunal
"We have got so to act now that
men in the future who feel tempted to
follow the example of the rulers who
plunged the world into this war will
know what is awaiting them at the
end of it. We shall have to see that
this terrible war, which has inflicted
so much destruction on the world;
which delayed civilization; which has
left marks on the minds and the
hearts of myriads in many lands, that
this generation will not see obliterat

that it is a crime that shall never

there is no middle road; there is no

"Holland now voluntarily displeases
the entire world by giving shelter and
protection to the fone of contention.
Such a position is incomprehensible
to me and, as I desire to regain the
liberty of speech which 25 years of
American citizenship has granted me,
I can serve the country of my birth
no longer."
Commenting on his resignation, Mr.
Gei.isbeek said:
"I have mailed my resignation as
consul to the Netherlands tor the
states of Colorado, Utah and New
Mexico for the reason that I cannot
endorse the action of the government
in harboring the former German em
peror, coupled with other acts of the
government in its stand during the
war, and with the prospect of a news
paper campaign in the United States
to justify its action in giving shelter
aLd protection to William Hohenzol
lern." Mr. Geijsbeek declared that his de
cision to resign came with the receipt
of a note intended for newspaper pub
lication explaining the attitude of the
Netherlands government toward the
refuge given William Hohenzollern.
Hf was instructed to see that this
tote was published in Denver papers.
Mr. Geijsbeek, who is a naturalized
American, was named consul in Den

Pride goeth before a fall, we have been
informed in a wise proverb, but rarely has
the world seen so complete an illustra
tion of this ancient saw, as in the case of
the former emperor of Germany, William
Hohenzollern. When it became evident
even to the pride-bound ruler of the land
of the Hun, that his tenure was growing
short, he with his personal suite, hastened
to Holland to intern himself. Going to the
castle of a former subject, loyal to himself,
the ex-emperor was surrounded by every
luxury and to the casual eye, it appeared
for the time that his stay in the land of the
Dutch would be safe and not unpleasant.
Then came rumors that the allies would
insist upon ex-emperor Bill being surren
dered under extradition proceedings for
trial under indictments found against him
by the courts of Great Britain, as accessory
before the fact, in the murder of innocents,
as a result of war vessels, airplanes and
zeppelin raids on England. France also has
charged him with inciting the heinous
crimes which have .drenched her soil with
blood and embittered the lives of her- peo
ple. Lloyd George, British premier, during
a speech delivered at Newcastle, England,
yesterday, said that to settle the question
of responsibility for the invasion of Bel
gium, the British government ha3 consult
ed some of the greatest jurists of the king
dom. They unanimously and definitely
have arrived at the conclusion that, in their
judgment, the former German emperor was
guilty of an indictable offense, for which
he ought to be held responsible. With this
public announcement made, and with the
near approach of the Paris peace confer
' ence? it should be evident even to so hide
bound a royalist as William Hohenzollern,
that the modern world intends to hold .mur
derers responsible, be he king or common.
Further, he doubtless will ' perceive that
there is scant chance for him to dodge his
just deserts. Holland, instead of a safe,
pleasant abiding place, rapidly is becoming
a prison from which he only can emerge
to take the consequences for all the mur
der, the rapine, destruction of property and
other terrible crimes he has incited, as ruler
of Germany. And he will lean that the in
dictments outstanding against him are not
to b considered "mere scraps of paper."
Civilization, outraged, demands reparation
and expiation.
THE TREASURE SHIP
(Oniaha Daily News.)
Within a few days there will sail from an
Atlartic port the most wonderful ship that
ever left the American shore.
It is not a great battleship, a triumph of
millions in wealth, and the creation of a
thousand men's minds and muscles.
It is not a priceless cargo of human lives
a transport carrying new treasures of
youth and manhood to the far flung battle
line.
It is no rich freighter of commerce,
heavy with grains, gold, fabrics, machines,
metals, all the wealth of mine and field
and factory.
Great and glorious though such ships be
they are as unmeaning toys beside this ship
now setting sail the Treasure Ship of
America laden from bow to stern, from
keel to funnel-tip with love, and happiness,
and golden dreams!
It is the Christmas Ship, freighted with
the deep, pure, selfless love of women hur
rying, hurrying to the yearning, reverent
love of men.
From every corner of the nation was
gathered the precious cargo. For weeks
and months it lived only in the dreams of
mothers, wives, sweethearts and sisters,
planning and contriving its riches.
Then the dreams took form in small
economies and shining self-sacrifices that
meant more dimes and dollars for the fill
ing of that parcel for the soldier. There
was a joyful flurry of shopping and stitch
ing, and then, when the wonderful boxes
Uncle Sam himself had made for the Christ
mas kits finally arrived and the Red Cross
passed them out to eager hands, what a
redoubled flutter there was, and what mar
vels of packing, fitting, selection, rejection
were accomplished in getting so much into
such a tiny space.
But at length the strange, wonderful
cargo is ready, having traveled from lonely
farm and quiet village, from tenement and
palace, from smooth young fingers and
gnarled old hands, into the helping hands
of the treasure ship.
More than two million little 3-pound
packages make the treasure cargo.
As the treasure ship sails away to France
the throbbing of its engines will become as
the heart beats of the women with whose
love and labor it is laden and all around
it as it slips through the dark, cold water
toward the waiting men in France, will
hover a guarding, guiding spirit that is al
most palpable light the light of love which
is both human and divine.
A MEETING OF THE "REDS'
(Phoenix Republican.)
The police commissioner of New York
used unnecessarily rough language in de
scribing the action of the soldiers and sail
ors who expressed violent disapproval of
the "reds" meeting on Monday night, as
"rowdyism." A lot of men and women
whose disloyalty was much more than sus
pected were about to meet. The author
ities of the city were aware that the meet
ing was to be held, and that the police sus
pected the character of the meeting is
shown in the fact that an order had been
made that no red flags should be displayed.
Everybody who knew anything about
the people who were going to assemble
must have known that it was in opposi
tion to our form of government that the
dreamers proposed a different form. It is
to the shame of New York that such a met
ing should have been allowed to begin. It
was this laxity on the part of the police that
gave opportunity for what the commis
sioner calls rowdyism.
The soldiers and sailors perhaps did not
go about the work of suppressidn in the
best way. Maybe it would have been bet
ter to leave the matter to the police, but
they certainly went about it in the Amer
ican way. Notwithstanding the police or
der, there were red flags there, With the
intention of insulting the American flag
and defying constituted authority, always
hateful to anarchists, these red flags were
concealed under coats and cloaks until the
participants were once in possession of the
place of meeting. It is doubtful whether
at that stage of the proceedings the police
would have interfered, but for the action
of the soldiers and sailors. They had un
derstood when they went into the service
that they were to fight the enemies of their
flag and here they were, under the flag
of the' bolsheviki, the ensign of anarchists
everywhere.
GIRLS WHO ALSO SACRIFICED
While we are devoting much and just
attention to the young men who dropped
their profitable employments to enter the
army and bear the nation's burden, we
must not lose sight of the fact that it was
not men alone who sacrificed the privileges
of peace.
Thousands of girls and women, expert
stenographers and proficient in hundreds
of clerical ways, gove up comfortable
places to turn their ability to the purposes
of the government. How are they to stand
in the demobilization and rearrangement
of employment? Are they to shift for
themselves or are their patriotic actions to
be rewarded and they safeguarded?
We are properly invoking the national
strength in the project of setting each sol
dier in as good a job as the one he left. We
must surely employ the same means in pro
viding for the stenographer who resigned
from a secure place so that she might do
all in her power for victory. Many of the
men in service were Assigned to clerical
regiments and thus set at tasks no more im
portant than the tasks assigned to girls. Of
course, the men were nearer the front and
their work attended by more danger. But
the sacrifice was no greater. Wherefore, we
plead for some assurance for the girls.
They have been soldiers of the republic
and they are entitled to the treatment ac
corded a veteran.
St. Louis Star: When news came from
Holland that the kaiser had been interned
many hoped that the word had been misspelled.
ILEUS FORTUNE
TO
WOMAN
WHO
ASSITED HIM
Charles Montgomery, Former
Mining Pioneer of This
Section, Leaves His Posses
sions to Eastern Lady
DOUGLAS. Ariz., Nov. 29. The old
adage about "one good turn deserves
another" was manifested in Douglas
the other day when a will for the prop
erty of Charles Montgomery was
riled. This property amounts to about
$30,000, and would have gone to the
state of Arizona if the will had not
been discovered.
The will brings forth an interesting
and romantic story of how a woman
is made independently rich by a good
turn done a friend when she was a
girl.
Charles Montgomery, the friend,
died two years ago at Cananea, and
since it has been considered that
there weie no heirs. A short time
ago Mrs. Florence Bowden, who re
sides near Piedmont, West Virginia,
heard of his death, and after much
hunting brought forth from an old
trunk in the garret a will, leaving
to h-r tuch property or moneys as Mr.
Montgomery had at the time of his
death.
The story began more than 40
years before. Charles Montgomery
when a young man, boarded at the
home of an old lady in West Virginia.
She was very fond of him, and when
he got into some sort of trouble, that
didn't amount to much when viewed
by older folks, but bothered him
greatly, he left that part of the coun
try and went to Mexico, to make his
fortune. He saved and worked and
in 1S!3 had made enough money to
take him to the world's fair at Chi
cago. There he was having a very good
time, when in the midst of it, he found
that some thief bad robbed him of all
his savings. He had a few dollars left
and used this to go to West Virginia
to visit his old time friends and con
fidants. Wheu he reached there he
found that she had died. Her daugh
ter welcomed him as the mother , had
done, and he explained his difficulties
to her. She told Charles that she did
not have the money but that her
daughter had taught for two years
and had saved S108.ll.
He asked tie girl to lend him the
money. Her mother urged her to do
so, saying that if she had $5000 she
would be willing to give it to him.
He told them of his prospects and of
the opportunities. The girl consent
ed and he took her savings and come
west again. They did not hear from
him for three years. Then, one day
a postal came from Guadalajara, Mex
ico, saying he would send the money
soon. Seven more years passed by
and one day a registered letter was
received. It carried three one hun
dred dollar bills, which was the prin
cipal with good interest, and a will
leaving to Florence Rensliaw "such
properties and money that he would
leave at his death." The letter was
mailed at Denver, Colo.
The woman put the will away with
the other old letters and soon forgot
it. She married two years ago, and,
while she and her husband are far
from rich, they are In comfortable
circumstances. It was only a few
w'eeks ago that word came to her of
Charles Montgomery's death and of
the fact that there were no heirs. She
thought of the old will hidden away
somewhere, and the search followed.
It came to light after some time and
D. A. Richardson filed it a few days
ago. It was brought here by C. P.
Lynch, a friend of Mrs. Bowden, who
is now in the city. The money is on
deposit at the Bank of Douglas and
will be paid to the heir by the pro
bate court.
Mrs. Bowden is nearly 50 years of
age and the snug little fortune will
mean a great deal to her.
Mr. Montgomery was ' well known
among mining men. He was an old
friend of James's. Douglas.
Mr. Montgomery was well known to
a number of the pioneers of this city
and of Cananea, who are now resi
dents here. He was a frequent visitor
to the district while he was making
bis home in Cananea.

clean and the other organs in work
ing condition, and you will have noth
ing to fear.

MUCH LITIGATION
OVER CHILD'S POSSESSION
Phoenix: Violet Mendivil, aged ;.
is the center of long sustuiuej liti
gation in this city. Her grauduii.laei,
Mrs. Mary Siebert, demands' prysa.,
sion of the child on the basis of an
order of Judge Sidney N. Reeve ia
the Los Angeles juvenile court, July
5, 1916. Violet's mother, wh-j men
surrendered her rights, now, a rest-
dent of New York, is understood to
want the child back. The Arizona
record of the matter started in June
last year, when the grandfather sur
rendered the child to the juvenile
court in Phoenix, with a signed relin
quishment, on the ground of inability
to support. Thereafter she was adopt
ed from the detention home by Frank
Ramsey and wife of Gilbert. Ari.s.
The application of the Sieberts has
been rejected, in turn, by Superior
Judges R. L. Stanford and Frank Ly
man and now again has been refused
a bearing by Judge S. L. Pattee of
Pima county. The Sieberts insist
that their surrender of the child was
temporarily.
and all persons interested in said
estate are notified then and there to
appear and show cause, if any they
hava, why the prayer of said petition
er should not be granted.

NU.W YORK, Nov. 29. Modiiica
lit.n oi the restrictions recently placed
0:1 brokers' loans and assurances
roni Washington that cancellation or
intting of war contracts would be
undertaken in a spirit of ' fairness
and helpfulness" were among the fac
tors which turned today's stock mar
ket from its heavy opening to one of
general strength in the later deal
ings. Buying of shippings, coppers and
oils set in before midday, followed by
an aggressive demand for high grade
transportations. Pacifies again featur
ing that group. Extreme advances in
that division ranged from 3 to SM
points, grangers and coalers follow
ing at gains of 1 to 3 points.
Independent steels, equipments, mo
tors and oils were 1 to 4 points down
during the forenoon, but bounded for
ward with other leaders, in every
noteworthy instance, ending at a sub
stantial advance. Mexican Petroleum
was the chief feature of the speculat
ive issups reversing its setback of 44
points with a gain of 3Vi points.
Amonn the various specialties.
United States Rubber, sugar and leath
ers scored substantial gains. Sales
amounted to 665.000 shares.
Railway bonds derived some
strength from the inquiry for stocks
of that class, but the general list was
irregular. Liberty issues again weak
ening with the fourth 4is at the new
low of $96.90. Total sales, par value,
$10,775.0(10.
Old United States bouds were un
changed on call.
DUN'S WEEKLY REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Nov. 29. Dun's to
morrow will say:
"Not through absence of important
requirements or lack of sustained pur
chasing power, but mainly because of
expectations of downward revision of
prices, even now being realized in
some instances, forward business is
largely held in abeyance. That many
buyers are deferring new commit
ments as far as possible, awaiting the
further reaction of prices which seems
plainly foreshadowed, is the keynote
of advices from about every center
of prominence, and uncertainty re
garding the exact disposition of vari
ous restrictions which still remain
effective is a not insignificant ele
ment in the present hesitation. Yet
with conservatism and caution con
spicuous features, there is now clearly
less apprehension of the results of
the economic changes which must in
evitably be witnessed, and the transi
tion to a peace basis is continuing
without apparent signs of serious dis
location of trade and industry. Week
ly bank clearings,. $5,106,103,2S4."
BOSTON FINANCIAL REVIEW.
BOSTON', Mass., Nov. 29. The
Commercial Bulletin tomorrow will
say:
"All branches of the wool and wool
textile industry have been waiting
this week for the announcement from
Washington as to what course of ac
tion will be taken by the government
in disposing of its' surplus stocks of
wool. It is generally believed that
the government will take the balance
of the 1918 wools, but it is thought
hardly likely to take next year's clip.
However, - a plan of distribution of
wools now on hand will doubtless be
adopted which will be calculated to
disturb the- Industry as little as pos
sible, consistent with being effective.
"The Argentine market has been
dull and prices are uncertain."
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Nov. 29. Broad huniani
tariauism reported as the probable
basis of food shortage relief in Europe
had much to do today with stimulat
ing bullish sentiment in the corn
market. Prices closed strong, 3c to
3?c net higher, with December 1.27"s
to 1.28 and January 1.28 to 1.2S-".
Oats gained lVc to 21ie. in provi
siens, the outcome ranged from ic de
cline to $1 advance.
Although announcement that one ol
the biggest distilleries in the country
would close down tonight led to much
selling at times In the torn market,
the general movement of prices was
clearly upgrade. Scantiness of offer
ings together with other takers that
farmers were refusing to sell freely
at current values, put the bears at a
disadvantage and the trade was in a
Yeady mood to place full stress on
Paris advices that the food situation
in Europe would be alleviated in
every way possible and that help
would not be confined to particular
localities, but would have wide scope
wherever great distress was evident.
Accordingly, the finish was at the tip
top prices of the day.
Oats ascended with corn and with
the aid of a fair demand from the
seaboard.
Provisions avetaged lower owing to
weaknescs in the hog market.

FINDS HOUSE.
Harry S. Ross, newly elected state
treasurer, has returned to his home in
Tombstone after spending a few days
in Phoenix hunting a house to rent for
his family to live in. After quite a
search he found a suitable house that
he thinks will be big enough for his
family. In describing his difficulty
in renting a place, Ross said that he
believes Phoenix is a fine place to in
vest in property and butld, as houses
seem to be in such demand and the
supply is small. At the recent election
Ross carried every county in the
state, making a splendid record. That
he will make a good state treasurer is
shown by his record during the past
four years, in which he has been
treasurer of Cochise county, handling
large sums of money. He says that
during the first half of 191S tax col
lections amounted to 12,000,000.

TO IDENTIFY PROPERTY.
James Dougherty. Mrs. M. Fruit-
man and J. Brown left yesterday for
Douglas to go across ihe line to Agua
Prieta to try and identify stolen goods
that are being field there by the Mexi

under arrest there who admit having
stolen a vast quantity of goods from
the Warren district. One of the
watches, as reported in The Review
yesterday, answers the description of
a watch that was stolen from the
Dougherty home in Tombstone can
yon a few weeks ago. The Mexicans
have admitted also that they have
pbout $2000 worth of stolen goods
crched on this side of the line that
were stolen in Bisbee, Lowell and
Tucson. It is thought that some of
ttese goods are a part of the loot
fiom the Fruitman store and other
places that have been broken into
here recently.

3F"
- PAY LESS
WAR SAVINGS STAMPS
WHAT THEY ARE AND
WHAT THEY MEAN
ARIZONA IS LAGGING IN ITS
QUOTA OF THEM; THE ONLY
THING THAT SHE HAS NOT MET
IN THE WORLD'S WAR; THE
COUNTY IS ALSO BEHIND
Arizona is far behind its quota of
war savings stamps the only thing
of a patriotic nature in which it has
lagged. It may be possible that some
of the readers of The Review in the
Warren district and the county do not
thoroughly understand what thrift
r.tamps and baby bonds are, what a
fine savings investment they make
and what a big part they take in pay
ing the bills for "winning the war."
For that reason The Review is taking
the liberty of printing a concise story
or the plan in the hope that it will
assist the state in holding up its repu
tation that it has made throughout
the war, aud thereby help the gov
ernment: Thrift stamps and baby bonds are
little things in themseUes, but in
the aggregate, if the hope and expec
tation of the treasury' department is
reached, they will equal in revenue
producing power one of the liberty
loans. More than that, they will have
inculcated in many homes thrift that
thrift which baa helped so largely to
win the war.
Obviously all people may not own
Liberty bonds and, equally obviously,
the smaller investors wish to help the
government in its time of need, to
help it in proportion to their means.
That is why thrift stamps and baby
bonds were originated, to enable ail,
rich and poor, to aid in the war. To
give the people of more moderate
means the advantage the war savings
stamps were made the finest of all
the investments offered by the gov
ernment, the easiest to buy, the easi
est to pay for and the easiest to sell.
They are such fine investments that
the amount any one individual may
buy is limited to $1000. If there were
not such a limit the very rich would
take all there were because of the in
vestment advantages offered.
To make them easy to handle a
unit system was devised. The thrift
stamp costs but 25 cents and 16 of
the stamps plus a few pennies buys a
baby bond which on January 1, 1923,
becomes worth $5, though phen bought
it does not cost that much. It is the
interest the government pays from
date of purchase to date of maturity
(January 1, 1923) which makes an in
vestment of $4 22 in November $4.23
in December worth $5 after four
years. Thus 16 stamps costing 25
cents each or $4 for the whole 16
with 22 cents added in November or
23 cents added in December will pro
duce at the liberal rate of interest
for such class of investment which is
allowed by the government, $5 in four
years.
It was figured that on an average
each person would take $20 worth of
these war savings stamps or baby
bonds, as they are popularly known.
In Arizona, but one county so far has
met this expectation and some coun
ties have not as yet averaged $5 per
person.
Thrift stamps and baby bonds are
really just the; same as so much
money. They can be registered at the
postoffice and then only the real
owner may cash them, but if they are
not registered any one holding them
can go to any postoffice and on ten
days' notice receive for them in cash
the money they cost. In the case of
the larger stamps, the baby bonds, not
only will the holder get back his
money, but he will get it back with
interest as well. Thus the stamps are
really the same as cash with the addi
tional advantage that the bigger
stamps bear Interest while cash in
the pocket does not.
With the approach of peace, people
may ask what is the need of con
tinuing the sale of war savings
stamps. Even with final peace, which
will not be signed for some months, a
large army will have to be maintained
to see that the terms of peace may
be carried out. The cost of the war
will be felt for years and war savings
stamps will help to foot the bill for
winning the war for a long time to
come. Every method of raising reve
nue will have to be used, just as it
has been during the actual fighting.
There will be at least one more Lib
erty loan, heavy taxation and thrift
stamps for a future period the dura
tion of which is not yet known, for an
army and navy must be maintained
for an indefinite period. All experts
are agreed In this.
You can lighten the burden of tax
ation, help pay the bills- for winning
the war and stand solidly back of your
government by purchasing thrift
stamps and baby bonds now just as
in the time of battle.
FINDING WORK FOR
ARIZONA SOLDIERS
Infiltration is the immense problem
that now confronts the department of
labor, and this word, borrowed from
mineralogy, describes the proces of
bringing the men back from trench
and camp and placing them in the
positions for yhicta they are fitted in
civilian life.
In Arizona this branch of after-the-war
work was inaugurated yesterday
when Thomas J. Croaff, federal direc
tor of the United States employment
service in Arizona, received a wire
from the department of labor instruct
ing him to get in touch with the Ari
zoni men at the various cantonments
and arrange to place them in home in
dustry. Carrying out the instructions of the
department, the director has wired
representatives of the government in
New Mexico and in California asking
that the Arizona men at Camps Cody
and Kearny lie given application
blanks. In filling out these blanks,
the men will tell the class of work
which they want and give other infor
mation to guide the employment serv
ice In placing them in employment.
The work of replacing Arizom
fighting men in Arizona industries
will be shared by the department of
labor with the state council of defense.
Employers are asked soon to supply
the employment service with details
as to the number of men they need,
the character of the work, etc. In
case tlu y wish to employ again men
wh(m they have had previous to the
war and who are now in service they
are asked to state the names of these
men. This will probably happen in a
great many cases where'men have left
employment li.cally to fight, obtaining
an indefinite leave of absence.
ANTI-GAMBLING
NEAR: TO DEFEAT
ARIZONA MEASURE JUST SLIPS
THROUGH WITH SCANT MAJOR
ITY OF 670 VOTES
PHOENIX, Ariz, Nov. 29. One of
the oddities of the election is said to
be the near defeat of the anti-gambling
bill submitted to the people, tl
had been passed by the third state
legislature and had been submitted to
referendum on the- strength of a peti
tion backed mainly by the cigar stand
and pool hall operators, with the
backing also of the "punch board"
purveyors. It was designed to hit the
dice games that now are to be found
in al.ncst any Arizona hotel lobby,
ostensibly played for cigars, and is
believed tc comprehend fully all the
various games of chance that have
been left unincluded in Arizona's
antkgambling statutes.
Games Covered
There are covered the games of po
ker, blackjack, panguingi, "21," etc.,
as well as faro and roulette. In the
prohibition and the penalties are in
cluded both the players and the pro
prietors, managers, lessees or em
ployes of any house in which the pro
hibited gaming shall be discovered.
Forbidden to License
Municipalities and counties are for
bidden to license or permit gaming of
any sort. All this was along the lines
of much legislation heretofore that
had bad warm approval from the Ari
zona voters, yet the act would have
failed had it not received very strong
support in Maricopa county. As it
was, it slipped through by a bare 670
majority.
Public Works Contracts
Restoration of the system 6f con
tracting for public 'works of the state
received a majority of 1732 votes. It
was favored and submitted by an act
of the last legislature. The original
initiated act was tme passed with the
support of the labor union element
ana was called "an act to promote the
welfare of the people of the state of
Arizona, to provide for the develop
ment of the resources of the state, to
abolish the contract system of all
Elate construction and to establish
a Mate printing plant and to estab
lish a state banking system and to
make an appropriation therefor . . . "
The amendment just acted upon fa
vorably is to section four and reads:
All work on all state buildings.
dams, reservoirs, flumes, water plants.
gas plants and all other state con
struction may be done by contract."
There has been no serious effort to
put iuto effect any of the balance of
the original act."
NO EXTRA FARE
AFTER TOMORROW
After December 1, it will not be
necessary to pay extra fare td ride
in a Pullman car or a tourist car.
Garnett King, general passenger
agent of the E. P. & S. W., received
information Thursday from headquar
ters of the railway administration ad
vising him that effective December 1,
it will only be necessary to possess
the regular railroad ticket and the
Pullman ticket in order to ride in a
Pullman. This charge Jias been ef
fective since June 10 last.
It was apparently put into effect
to discourage travel in Pullman and
tcurist cars that these might be re
leased for the use of troops. Now
that the troop movements have been
largely discontinues, Mr. King be
lieves the railroad administration is
planning on encouraging the tourist
business. He says -it is already pick
ing up to California.
The above information has been re
ceived from Mr. King at the stations
of the E. P. & S. W. in the Warren
district.
LUKE'S DEATH NOW

TEACHERS SAYS
SUPT.J, 0, CASE
LAW DOES NOT PERMIT DEDUC
TION BECAUSE OF CLOSING OF
SCHOOLS ON ACCOUNT OF EPI
DEMIC OF m INFLUENZA DE
CLARES STATE OFFICIAL
! That the teachers oti public schools
! in Arizona which have been closed
for so many weeks on acocunt of the
'epidemic of Spanish influenza should
i receive full pay, regardless of w heth
j c r the schools were open or not. is the
I opinion of C. O. Case, state superin
tend nt of public - instruction, and
that he also believes that the laws of
the state provide for full payment of
salaries, will be good news to the
many teachers who have been serious
ly inconvenienced through the closing
of the schools and the non-payment of
salaries.
With reference to the right of the
teachers to receive their hill pay for
the time the schools are closed be
cause of the epidemic, Superintendent
Case makes the following statement:
Should Have Full Pay
"Hard conditions occasioned by an
unusual epidemic have closed, for an
extended period, the public schools of
Arizona, and these conditions, over
which teachers of this state have no
control, have suspended the services
of the teachers, at the same time hold
ing them liable to resumption of serv
ice at any time.
"I feel in all justice to the teachers
that their full salaries should be al
lowed for the period during which the
schools may be closed on account of
the epidemic. It is also my opinion
that, as a matter of law, unless other
wise stipulated by contract, that no
deduction can be made from teach
ers salaries during the time ,the
schools may be closed on account of
the (epidemic.
No Desire to Cut Salaries
"I am not aware that there is any
tendency on the part of school boards
in Arizona to deduct fiom the salaries
of the teachers because of the prevail
ing influenza; but, whether or not this
tendency prevails, I deem it my duty
to state my views in the matter. J
It r r.nKnA .... r. ....... .... t
National Education association, .has
written me advising that in no state
have teachers' salaries been increased
to keep pace with the increased cost
of living, that it is exceedingly diffi
cult for them' to make ends meet and
that the National Education associa
tion is advocating that teachers should
suffer no reduction of salaries flr the
loss of time occasioned by the closing
of schools or be required to use their
vacations in making up time.
Fear Appropriation Loss
"Inquiries are coming to my office .
regarding the eight months' school J
term requited by law, some districts i
being apprehensive of losing their j
next year's appropriation of school
moneys through a possible failure of i
maintaining the required term. As
far as possible, every school district
in the state should maintain, even this
year, an eight months' school term,
but the law itself anticipates and pro
vides for even such extreme abnorm
al conditions-as are now prevailing.
While paragraph 2821, Revised Sta
tutes of Arizona, 1913, prescribes that
no apportionment ' of school moneys
may be made to any school district in
the state which has not maintained a
public school for at least seven
months during the preceding school
year, the same paragraph protects a
school district in case of an epidemic
by also prescribing that no district
which is prevented by fire, flood or

prevailing epidemic from maintain-1
ing the school for the length of time '
herein designated, seven months, is
nevertheless entitled to its ajipor- (

moneys.
(Signed) "C. O. CASE."
TEN DAYS' MORE
QUARANTINE IS
DECIDED UPON
(Continued from Page One) i
should not be lifted too soon and the
epidemic possibly be allowed to get
beyond their control as it had done
in other places where the quarantine
had been lifted too soon.
Public Should Help.
It was pointed out that the general
public should stand by the physicians
and assist in enforcing the quaran
tine. It was shown that the people
do not realize the seriousness of the
disease. There never had been an
epidemic that has caused as many
.1 . .. . V. . . V. . i .. V. . . t a k. 0.,fA..
as has influenza and the diseases thafj
have arisen therefrom. People have
been careless and taken the disease
into their own home whn it was en
tirely unnecessary. They have, gone
into homes where others have been ill
with the disease, have attended funer
als held in private hometK-wftere oth
ers were nick in the house witfc the
disease as the funeral was being held.
It was suggested that ' the public
might assist in several ways. Among
them was the suggestion that women
and children of families in .the dis
trict try and get down tow to do
their shopping in the mori-ing thoui-s
and the early hours of the afternoo,
before the shift comes off, so thai
they could keep from crowding the ;
stores and Btreet cars. That a ban
be placed on holding of any public
funerals in the private residences and
that funeral services held in under
taking parlors be limited to immediate
members of the- family, also was sug
gested and adopted. Others wishing
to show their respect might remain
outside seated in. autos or go to the
cemetery where outside services
might be held. Tke health officers
are going to see that the restrictions
on funerals are observed and under
takers will be so notified today.
To Limit Stores.
It was pointed out that' in some
instances at least a hundred or more
persons were allowed to congregate
in some of the stores while in other
places of business none were allowed
to gather. Beginning this morning an
effort will be made to stop this prac
tice and guards will be placed at the
doors to allow only a few to enter I
at a time, so that the, clerks can
handle them and have them move
out of the way so that others may
enter. It is hoped that by taking this
precaution further progress will be
made in the reduction of the number
of cases and that the quarantine can
be lifted on a week from Monday.
When the quarantine is lifted it
will be lifted entirely, with the excep
tion of public dances, which will not
be allowed under any circumstances.
It was shown by the doctors that in
dancing the partners could not help
breathing each other's breath and that
there was more danger in this than
from any other source.
The situation In the district at ,
present is greatly improved and the i
doctors want to see It continue. They
have handled the situation so far and
have not called outside help as have
other p'nrc3 and they do not want it
to reach any such stage. With the;
help of citizens of the district they ,
can accomplish their aim. It is a
matter of vital Importance to every
one both to do what he can and to :
see that every one also assists in '
the matter. With a united effort . it ,
can be accomplished.
Those who attended the meeting
were: Mayor Erickson, Councilmen
McDonald, Hicks, Bledsoe and Rosok,
Drs. Hunt, Bryan, Bridge and Nason. '
