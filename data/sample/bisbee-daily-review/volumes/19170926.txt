SECOND RAID
IN 10 DAYS
OVER LONDON
IS EFFECTED
German Airplanes Again Vis
it English Capital Dealing
Death and Misery In Small
Portion to Populace.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Sept 25. Another hos
tile airplane raid ton London took
place tonight. There weret two at
tacks apparently, for after a forty
minute quiet Interval anti-aircraft
puns resumed firing in the London dis
trict. In the first raid after brisk firing by
the defense guns lasting only ten min
utes, the raiders were driven off with
out succeeding in reachingt the city
of London.
"All Clear"
The firing of the antl-arrcran gun
in the second attack was of only brief
duration. The raiders were driven off
and the police gave out the "all clear
signal at 9:20 o'clock.
A report W the raid was issued by
Feld Marshal French as follows:
Thame Estuary Object
"The Thames estuary was again the
object of a hostile air raid this even
ing. The Kent and Essex coast was
crossed at various points and a few
bombs were dropped, but no casualties
ore as yet reported.
"One raider penetrated as far as the
southeastern outskirts or Lonaon,
where two bombs fell, causing some
twenty casualties.".
It appears that the fierce battle
which the British airplanes and anti
aircraft artillery put up last night
Torced the raiders to leave London
without (Topping any considerable
number part of their cargo of explo
. lsves.
Few Casualties
The enemy remained over London
at a great height for the greater part
of two hours, and the ral dappears
to have been on a pretentious scale,
but it was even nfbre abortive than
previous attempts. Although the vis
itors arrived early in the evening, Lon
doners have taken to heart the advice
of the authorities about seeking cov
er, and this accounts In part for the
small number f casualties.
Weather Favorable.
The weather conditions were equal
ylfavorabie for the raiders, but 'udg
Ing from the information thus far
available, tonight's raid was less seri
ous than Monday night, and apparent
ly the raiders were ltss numerous.
There was a general air of expectation
of another visit and many business
houses an dstores closed down some
what earlier than utual to tonable
the employes to reach home before the
raiders arrived. As a result, when
the police warnines to take cover were
given, the streets in the city section
were rapidly cleared, although much
omnibus traffic continued throughout
the raid. Considerable crowds had
been waiting at most of the tube sta
tions in expectation of the raid and
immediately took refuge underground.
Anti-Aircarft Guns Active.
The air battle tonight was compara
tively insignificant compared with
that of Monday night, as heard in
the center of the city.
The anti-aircraft fire in the first In
stance lasted only about 10 minutes.
It then stopped entirely for about 40
minutes when it resumed again in a
more distant section but only for a
few minutes. Nothing further was
hefird after this, although it was still
another half hour before the police
gave the signal that all was clear.
.Apparently only one raider reached
the southeastern outskirts of London.
Bombs dropped by him caused 20 casu
alties. Seattle Strike

SEATTLE, Wash., Sept 25. A

BILL HOW GOES
TO CONFERENCE
Senate Adds $800,000,000 to
Measure. Senator Martin
Advises Close Scrutiny of
Nation's Expenditures.
(By Review Leased Wirel.
WASHINGTON, Sept 25. Without
a roll call and after brief debate the
senate late today passed the eight bil
lion dollar war deficiency appropria
tion bill. Nearly $800,000,000 was
added to the measure as it came from
the bouse and it now goes to confer
ence. Items for many millions of dollars
were approved with only a handful of

debate.
Sharp Scrutiny Urged.
Senator Martin, chairman of the ap
propriation committee, urged sharp
scrutiny of what he termed extrava
gance and almost reckless department
al estimates. He said appropriations
during five months of war would reach
$20,000,000,000 and expressed concern
lest next year's total expendituies
might be $50,000,000,000.
Duty Grows Hourly.
"We are compelled to shut our eyes
and appropriate a great deal rather
than hamper our men on the battle
field," said the senator, "uut our
duty to scrutinize these estimates
grows every hour. We must give ev
ery dollar necessary to prosecute the
war but our duty is to trim down ex
travagance and useless appropriations.
The government's finances are in a
perilous situation.
"Are we going to impoverish the
country? Yes, if necessary to win this
war, but in God's name don't let us
spend money unless absolutely nec
essary.
Over the Democratic leader's opposi
tion the senate adopted. 28 to 26, nn
amendment by Senator Robinson ap-.
propriating $500,000 for the employ

(By Review Leased Wlrei.
LONDON, Sept. 25. The Germans
delivered a powerful attack against
the British east of Ypres today. They
succeeded in gaining a foothold in the
British lines on narrow fronts. Hand
to hand fighting ensued and after an
other meeting the British drove thein
from their newly won positions and
re-established, their line in its entirety,
according to Field Marshal Haig's re
port tonight.
For the second night in succession
German airmen have raided the south
eastern section of England and reach
ed London. Tuesday night the Ger
mans did not succeed In penetrating
to the heart of London, being stopped
on the outskirts by the defensive forc
es. A score of casualties are report
ed. Latest reports of the raid Mon
day night show only a few casualties
and many injured.
The German airplanes Tuesday
night followed the same course as
the raiders of Monday night, attempt
ing to reach London through Kent and
Essex and up the course of the
Thames.
Germans Again Active.
The army of Crown Prince Rupp-
recht of Bavaria became active again
Tuesday and made desperate attempts
to retake the ground gained by the
British last Thursday near the Ypres
Menin road in Flanders. ; The Ger
mans succeeded in entering the British
lines at two points during the first as
saults, but the British withstood fur
ther attacks and straightened out
their line. The day's efforts brought
nothing to the Germans but additional
casualties. Great artillery activity Is
in progress on the sector east of Yp
res.
Near Verdun.
Northeast of Verdun the- infantry
activities slackened after their inef
fectual efforts of Monday the Germans
unsuccessfully attacked the French
near the Bois le Chaurae early Tues
day. Berlin claim officially to have
taken trenches here on Monday and
to have held them against counter at
tacks. On the Aisne front the artil
lery battle continues. - ,
Inactive On Fronts.
There has been no great activity on
the other fronts. The Italians have
repulsed attacks on the Bainsizza
plateau, northeast of Gorizla. German
efforts to recapture the new positions
gained by the Russians southeast of
Riga have been checked by the Rus
sians. Captain George Guyircmer,
the leading French aviator, is believed
by thi French war office to have btcu
killed. Guynemer left Dunkirk for a
flight on the German lines in Flanders
two weeks ago and nothing has been
heard of him since. Lieutenant Vos
se. a leading German aviator has been
killed in action with his fiftieth anni
versary.
Argentine Action.
By a vote of 53 to 19 the Argentine
chamber of deputies has declared in
favor of breaking off diplomatic rela
tions with Germany. The Argentine
senate last week voted almost unani
mously in favor of a break over the
revelations brought out by the expos
ure of von Luxburg, the German min
ister at Buenos Aires by the American
state department.
No Separate Peace.
Great Britain and France have for
mally notified the provisional Russia, i
government that they would not con
clude a separate peace to the detri
ment of Russia. These assurances
were in reply to reports current in
Russia that Germany was endeavoring
to make peace at the expense of the
new republic.

Ex-Minister of War's Trial
Nears Its Close In Petro-
grad. Appeal Is Made For
His Freedom by Attorney.
(By Review Leased Wire)
PETROGRAD, Sept. 25. At the
:rial of General Soukhomlinoff, former
minister of war, for high treason
nears its close, public interest has re
vived to an extraordinary extent. The
court today was crowded.
In concluding his speech, M. Zacha
rin of counsel for the defense gave
a vigorous explanation of the equip
ment of the army in proof that Sou
khomlinoff had neglected it.
Not Responsible
A second member of counsel for the
millions of soldiers ewa 4an
Soukhomlinoff was not responsible
for the insufficiency of equipment for
the millions of soldiers and appealed
to the Jury not to make Soukhomlin
off a scapegoat for the offense of the
fallen regimen.
Emotion was aroused among the
audience by the address of M. Kazar
inoff, counsel for Madame Soukhomli
noff, charged with complicity in the
plots of her husband. M. Kazarinoff
declared that the trial was not a judi
cial process, but a protest of the Rus
sians against the nation's unprepared
ness for war. i
Excuses Woman
"What role could a woman, a young
woman, play in this bloody affair?" he
asked. "All the evidence we have is
that she ordered ten hats in one sea
son and wore diamonds and rings. If
the war minister himself had wor
these hats, diamonds and rings, then
I admit it would have been surrising.
But in a young and pretty woman
doing it there is nothing surprising.
Why, a single big shell of a Russian
howitzer costs ten-fold more than
scores of hats.
"Where Madame Soukhomlinoff got
the money is unknown, but It cer
tainly was not from that assigned for
military needs. It is charged that
Madame Soukhomlinoff meddled In
military affairs. Had she attempted
this her husband would have acted
like the wise Turk who appealed to
his wife's advice in order to know
what to do."
Irish Convention
Holds Sessions in
the City of Cork
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CORK. Ireland. Sept. 25. The Irish
convention re-assembled here today.
Though no definite arrangement has
as yet been reached with the Ulster
ites, it is said the speeches of some
of their leaders, couched in very elo
quent and friendly language, have
given good grounds for hope of a
peacable settlement. There was some
apprehension of opposition to the con
vention on the part of the Sinn Feiners
in Cork but John MacNeill and Ar
thur Grissh, Sinn Fein leaders, urged
their followers In this city to follow
the example of the Dublin compatriots
and let the convention alone.
The following motion was carried
unanimously by the delegates:
"First, that on the conclusion of de
bate at the present sittings of the con
vention various schemes which have
been submitted will be referred to a
grand committee. In order if possibl-j
to prepare a scheme for submission
to the convention which woufiT meet
the views and difficulties expressed
by different speakers during the course
of the debate.
'Second, that the convention stand
adjourned after this week's sitting un
til the grand committee is in a position
to report."
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25. More
thand one fourth of the $1,000,000 fund

COAL MINERS OF
INCREASED WAGE
Immediate Wage Increases are
Asked by the Miners of Coal
Operators. Production of
Fuel Object of Committee.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 25. Immed
iate wage increases of from 20 to 70
per cent were demanded by the coun
try's coal miners. It was announced
here tonight, after a preliminary meet
ing of operators and miners' represen
tatives. The demands were formulated by
the miners' representatives and will
be presented at a joint meeting tomor
row. There is every indication that
the mine owners will refuse to meet
them, first, on the ground that they
are too high, and second, that the re
cent fixing of coal prices by President
Wilson will not permit increases.
Basis fcr Country.
The increased asked, while stipulat
ed for the central field, comprising
Ohio, Indiana. Illinois and western
Pennsylvania, will serve as a basis
for the entire country and if they are
granted would have to be met by the
other districts. The demands are as
follows: '
Increases of 15 cents a ton on pick
and machine mined coal at all basing
points in the United States.
Percentages of Increases.
The percentages of increase granted
on machine and pick coal to be applied
to all differentials existing between
thin and thick vein mines.
Advances of $1.90 a day for men em
ployed In and around mines and 20
per cent raises on dead work and yard
ing. Today's joint conference was open
ed with a speech by Dr. H. A. Garfield,
the fuel administrator, who urged both
sides to let no differences stand in
the way of capacity production of coal.
Production Necessary.
"Under no circumstances," said Dr.
Garfield,' "must we allow production
to stop. We must put aside for the
time being all questions that miht
separate men under normal conditions
and work In the closest harmony.
There must be no suspension of work."
White Presents Demands.
The miners' position was presented
by John P. White, president of the
United Mine Workers of America, who
called the conference. Liberal wage
increases, he declared, were necessary
to prevent men from leaving the
mines to go into munitions and other
work which pays higher wages. Un
less wages are raised, he said, miners
will leave for higher money elsewhere
and production of coal immediately
will be cut.
The operators, aside from contend
ing they cannot afford to pay the in
creases, declare the demands are un
justified inasmuch as a general wage
raise was granted last April, and point
to an increase given in April. 1916.
which they say was granted with the
distant understanding no more dx
mands were to be made for two years.

WHAT OUR BOYS ARE
DOING AT GAMP FUN
STON TOKEEP BUSY
Interesting Letter Is Received
Which Tells In Detail of the
Routine. Cochise Bunch
Best Looking.
The following letter was received in
Bfcbee a few days ago from one of the
Cochise county boys that went with
the first contingent to Camp Funston
and gives a good idea of what the boys
are doing. It was written to his
brother In Bisbee, but at his request
no -names are mentioned:
Camp Funston, Sept. 12.
Dear Brother:
We arrived here Saturday a. m. ai
5:30. We were hiked over the camp
and then told to disrobe; cold show
er awaiting us after which we were
given the "O-O," then uniforms, hats
shoes and leggins were issued us.
Then we drilled a little and then de
tailed on police duty. Police duty is
nothing more than performing the
duties of a street sweeper, and a
scavenger wagon combined.
At 12 noon we had a mulligan, after
which we filled cotton sacks with hay
and made up our bunks. About 3:00
p. m. we went to the hospital and re
ceived two shots, one In the arm and
one in the fleshy portion under the
arm. Several have stated what these
shots contained but I have found no
one who knows positively -what they
were. They are Intended to prevent
diseases and I guess will. If soreness
has any significance of their doing so.
At 5:30 p. m. we1 bad retreat and then
some more chow. We spent the eve
ning getting into quarters.
Starting Sunday a. m. we started a
daily routine of arising at 6:45, revel
erlle at 6:00, mess at 6:15; assembly
at 7:00, and drill and lectures until
4:30 p. m. retreat at 5:00; mess at
5:30 and then we are off until 8:00
p. m. From this time on we have to
be in barracks the rest of the night.
Lights go out at 9 p. m.
Today we were assigned to batter
ies. I am in "C" battery of the 340th
field artillery. All of the Arizona
; draft will belong to this regiment. Tom
Cowen is in D" battery. Rudolph
Weiner Is in "E" battery. Two of the
boys from Bisbee are in the same
j battery as I. Weiner has had two days
of kitchen police. He makes a h 1
of a waiter; all he is good for is to
carry water.
The captain in charge of battery
i"C" told us today that we were assign
, ed permanently until the war was
over. There is a rumor afloat that we
are to be the first of the draft army
to go to France.
If this is true we will have no op
portunity to go to training school.
One of the captains of our regiment
said the Arizona boys and especially
the Cochise bunch were the best look
ing fellows that had come into camp.
He said three months training would
make them some of Uncle Sam's best
soldiers and he comes from the regu
lars. As soon as the horses arrive,
which will be within a week or 10
days, then our real work begins. Ev
ery man has to take care of his horse
and saddle. Drivers will have to pol
ish the harness and gunners will shine
the guns.
When each state quota arrives this
camp will contain 45,000 men. It is
about four miles long and two miles
wide. AH barracks are two-story and
officers' quarters one. A fire depart
ment of two Ford trucks compose the
camp's protection.
It is almost 9 o'clock so will have
to close. Remember me to all the
boys and relatives.
(There follows the address and
signature).
The second contingent arrived there
on last Friday morning and wenV
through about the same progarm Tel
legrams received from different ones
state that they have been assigned to
the different batteries. A number
were assigned to battery "C, the
same one that the letter above was a
member of.

Classes In Copper Mining to
Be But One Of Several Op
portunities for Men In Dis
trict The Y. M. C. A. has launched forth
into a new field one of the most Im
portant moves they have ever made in
the district. Frome henceforth the
educational department is to be one
of the Integral parts of their organiza
tion, and a large attendance is ex
pected and hoped for in their newly
formed classes.
Practical Mining Taught
Practical copper mining will be
taught in these classes by practical
miners and by men connected with
the mining companies and especially
adapted lor work of this nature. This
course, in which there will doubtless
be a heavy enrollment of miners, be
gins the second week in October. Ge
ology will also be taught under the
Instruction of the Copper Queen ge
ologist, C. B. WhitewelJ,
American Citizenship
Beginning next Monday, Superinten
dent Philbrook will teach classes in
American Citizenship. These classes
will be held from 1:30 until 2:30, and
from 7 until 8.
The Business English classes are
already under way, although any one
who wishes may still Join. These
classes meet on Tuesdays and Fri
days, at the same hours that is, from
7 until 8 for the men on the day shift
Arithmetic classes are held on Mon
days and Wednesdays at these hours
under E. B. Ryder, the Copper Queen
efficiency expert.
Dates Subject to Change
All these dates are subject to
change, and full information concern
ing the courses may be obtained at
the "Y" from the educational secre
tary, Mac H. Donaldson. Donaldson
has announced that the Spanish
classes are now meeting on Tuesdays
and Fridays at the hours in vogue tor
all classes, and that special arrange
ments may be made with the teacher
for tutorial hours. Conversational
Spanish classes are taught on Mon
days and Wednesdays.
Experience the Best Teacher
It is generally admitted that experi
ence is the best teacher, but should
we not make use of the experience of
others as well as our own? The ex
perience of a thousand persons is m'ore
i to be depended upon than that of one
' individual. Many thousands of per
; sons have used Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy for coughs and colds with the
best results, which shows it to be a
, thoroughly reliable preparation for
: those diseases. Try it. It is prompt
' and effectual and pleasant to take.

MEMORIAL 10 LATE
AO DOCTOR HELD
BY BISBEE FRIENDS
Soldiers In Attendance From
The 35th Infantry at Service
Honoring Captain Charles
H. Bowker, U. S. A.
In a House ol God. fittingly decorat

ers, the friends of Captain Charles H.
Bowker gathered yesterday and paid
him final tribute.
Occupying the foremost pews in tuo
Episcopal church were the men in at
tendance from Captain Bowker's regi
ment, the 35 infantry. Behind were
seated the admirers of the officer who
so recently met "life's greatest ad
venture." It was a solemn occasion,
impressive in its simple beauty and
dignity. The processional hymn was
"Ten Thousand Times Ten Thousand"
while the choir sang, during the serv
ice, "Abide With Me." and "Lead
Kindly Light." Mrs. G. O. Rhodes and
Mrs. J. P. Williamson gave an arrange
ment in duet of "Jesus, Lover of My
Soul." Dr. Brewster delivered a brief
address and the choir sang in reces
sional the splendid "For All The
Saints Who From Their Labours
Rest."
"The golden evening brightens in the
west ;
"Soon, soon to faithful warriors Cometh
rest; '
"Sweet is the calm of Paradise the
blest."
To one faithful' warrior calm has
come, and as his body sank to its last
resting place yesterday in . far off
Virginia, a splendid tribute was made
him In Bisbee by these people who
met together in memorial for an honor
able soldier and a , gallant gentleman
departed.

time I was flat of my back iinwble to
move without help, and the Iitt'e time
I did manage to stay out of bed my
daughier had to dress and undress
me.
"I suffered so terribly from lmilges
tion and gas on my stomach at times
I felt like I would die and my back
ached and hurt me so bad I couldn't
walk. I had such miserable headaches
I could hardly sleep at all and I was
"all the time taking medicine for the
headaches and indigestion and noth
ing did me any good. I took about ev
ery kind of medicine I ever heard of
and used all the liniments I knew of
for rheumatism but I just kept on suf
fering. I gof so I couldn't eat any
thing scarcely and I wouldn't dare to
touch coffee. It was simply terribie
the way I suffered, I just can't de
scribe it. and I hardly had a minute's
ease or comfort day nor night. Life
was truly a burden to me and I often
feli that 1 would rather not live if I
had to keep on suffering so.
' "Well, some wonderful thlDgs hap
pen in this world and my recovery
since I began taking Tanlac is almost
like a miracle. .Oh! the good it has
done me. and of all the people that
have been helped by it none could be
happier than 1 am. I can use my right
arm and hand now as well as I ever
could and every bit of headache and
backache and all my other pains are
gone entirely, I eat hearty, sleep like
a baby and can do all my house
work without a single bit of trouble.
My appetite Is just fine, I have gain
ed ten pounds in weight and feel like
I had been made over into a new wo
man. Just to show you how well I
can use my arm and hand, I have
written to all my relatives and lots
of other people and told them about
my wonderful recovery and advised
them if the need medicine of any kind
to take Tanlac. I'm telling everybody
I see who are suffering if they wont to
get rid of their troubles, ear- hVrtj

The commission has been conduc

fering $5,000 in prizes for the best
canned vegetables grown in war gar

ization of war garden exhibits through

secretary' of the commission says there
are still a few prices and national
certificates of merit to be apportion
ed to this state and that officials of
war garden exhibits or fairs should
communicate with the commission at
once.
A close estimate, based on early
leports to the commission, says the
women of the country have placed
460.000000 jars tof canned stuff on
the pantry shelves this year and that
all food conservation records have
been broken.

A FALSE NOTE IN THE FARMERS' WAIL.
What a difference just a few years make. How easily
does mankind become swollen and haughty with opulence
Ten years ago the farmer was a happy individual when
his corn brought fifty cents a bushel and his wheat eighty
and his hay six and seven dollars a ton and his hogs six
or seven cents a pound and his eggs twenty-five cents in
winter and fifteen in summer and the price of his land
held its own.
Today this same farmer is kicking in the traces like a
balky mule over an arbitrary price of $2.20 for his wheat.
He drives his auto to the county seat to take his daughter
to the train on her way to college and he stops long
enough to tell the half starved editor man that he will be
hornswoggled if he will sell a bushel of wheat at a paltry
two-twenty. He will also tell, if he can get any poverty
stricken city man to listen, how he is being robbed on
his corn at a dollar and a half and forced to give his hogs
away at eighteen cents a pound.
No one will give him much more, twice as much as he
held his land for a few years ago. Sixty cents for eggs
and a dollar a feather for chickens and any price he has
the conscience to charge for his butter. Alas, for the
poor farmer. He owns most of the bank stock and has
waterworks and Delco lighting systems and bungalows
and colonial mansions on his farm. His daughter spends
her summers on the coast and his son watches the World
Series in the fall and buys bull pups and hydroplanes for
his winter festivities.
And this farmer, this plutocrat of the soil, he roars and
raves over his wrongs at the hands of the government.
Two-twenty for wheat Why, he has to pay his hired
hand thirty-five a month now instead of fifteen. Farm
machinery, clothes, hardware, sugar and coffee, about
the only things he has to buy, have advanced from twenty-five
to fifty per cent. Everything he sells has advanced
from one hundred to five hundred per cent.
But, after all, the farmer feeds us. He has to work
hard and he must stand by and see the rain flood his
crops and the sun burn them and the wind and the winged
insects destroy them. He has his troubles, just like
every one else. And yet, at this particular time there
is no reason why he should be grouchy and parade hU
grievances against the trend of the times. Rather, it is
the man who works in town for wages who should have
the stage and the spot light to show his sore thumb. The
town man faces one hundred and five hundred per cent
increases in the price of necessities of life and he has
only about a fifty to one hundred per cent increase in
wages with which to meet them. War conditions hit
all clans and classes and should be made the best of by
all pond citizens and brave hearts. But the farmer, help
ed the most and hit the least. Is making more of an out
cry than the town man, who is doggedly bearing his bur
den up the hill and hoping for a brighter, better day when
his loaf of bread will be bigger and the price less than
It is this day.
War and hgh prices make lively times. Low prices
mark the advent of dull and stagnant times. Thus the
blessed law of balances adjusts our burdens and alter
nates our recompenses and haudicaps in a manner that
to it seems best for the struggling mortals of this world
below.
A SLACKER'S PLEA.
Kansas City Star: "If the war got over here I would
fight," a slacker at Camp Funston said, "hut I don't want
to until then."
An excuse often heard, but merely an excuse. After
the war had got over here it would have been too late to
fight. We have been six months at war and we aren't
ready yet. Germany was making war on us on the other
side of the ocean. Its whole course showed that it was
only a question of time when the war wou!4 hare been
brought to this side.
The man who says be would be willing to fight if our
shores were Invaded, but not otherwise. Is simply dodg
ing. He wouldn't fight at all.
"TAKE CARE OF THE THOMPSON BUNCH."
Henry O. Yen of the Vigilantes wrote the following
vivid and strong appeal to all good Americans to take
care of traitors and thus do their part to win the war:
He was twenty-one and he was having the time of his
young life. He was going to war.
It was the 5th of September in Chicago. The city's
mayor was in hiding. He bad outraged the city and th3
nation by Inviting the traitorous People's Council to meet
in his city. So he was hiding at the home of his pro
German boss, while the first contingent of drafted men
from Chicago were waiting in the grimy old Union Sta
tion for their train to pull out for Camp Grant
The kid was one of the contingent He was in bis
glory. The train platform had been cleared, a pair cf
Italian barbers of the contingent were strumming their
guitars, and the kid was tangoing gleefully and indiscrim
inately with every pretty girl within reach. And they
were all pretty to him then and he to them.
He was a good dancer. He was a good tennis player.
He was a well-dressed, happy kid.
Then the train moved. He dropped his partner and
leaped aboard. A few seconds later he stuck his head
out of a car window, and in those few seconds he had
changed. He was serious. As he looked at the crowd
a big thought bad smitten him, and that's hard on a
happy kid of twenty-one.
He looked at a group ot us who weren't going. He was
trying to put something big in words, and he was only
twenty-one.
And then it came.
"Say, you fellows," be said, stammering a little, "you
you know you gotta take care of the other kind that
Thompson bunch while we're away." And that was his
goodby.
Well? How about it? Are we doing it? Are we taking
care of the "other kind?" Are we fighting the enemy at
home, while the kid is away?
Emphatically we are NOT!
Mayor Thompson of Chicago is only a symptom. He
could not exist an hour without his supporting horde of
anti-American pro-Germans. He knows it "Big Bill"
is a stupid man, but he knows. He and his bosses are in
direct contact with the class they cater to. And they
know that the traitorous anti-American element Is so
strong in Chicago alone that it is good politics to cater
openly to them.
Think of it! In our second city the enemy is strong
enough to inspire a stupid mayor to open traitorlsm. It
is strong enough to kill the kid by thousands. Not op
enly, no. But by its snapping and snarling it can pro
long the war. To German eyes we are made to appear a
nation rotten at the root3; to Russia's eyes we are mad-:;
to appear a divided people. And the German army in
the field continues to fight with confidence because of the
aid which the unenlisted German army in our midst lends
to it.
The kid had gone to war.
If we are fit to be called Americans we will fish', the
good fight at home also.
We will "take care of the other kind the Thompson
bunch" while's he away.

W2ATKER INFLUENCE. j
The wtaihr man has much to d j
with making people glad or blue. On
dreary days of fog and rain men are j
disgruntled, and complain: when !
weather i-j as bad as that. I'd never 1
passed around the hat; for when a
man is chilled, alack! with goose-flesh
up and down his back, he won't chip
in a pair of straws to help along a
worthy cause. He feeis that he will
need his roll to purchase blankets,
grub and coal. He looks with pessi
mistic eye on everything beneath the
sky, and says the Germans enn't be
licked, and all their foes will be gold
bricked. But when the weather man's
begun to trot along his good old sun,
and when the skies are blue any fair,
and like a tonic is the air. and dismal
clouds don't come to bat, I like to pass
around the bat. Then people reach
down in their jeans for coin to buy
new submarines, to help Red Cross,
Y. M. C. A., or anything that comes
their way. Then optimistic are all
guys; I hear no deep, heart-rendering
sighs, and people say, "We'll bet some
mon we'll have the Germnns on the
run." The weather man should
realize how much depends on being
wise, and dish up days no nan can
knock the very best he has in stock.
A SHIP THAT DID HER BIT.
Arizona Record: If Berlin knew how many battles the
Minnehaha won for the allies there might be more Ger
man rejoicing on her reported loss than there has been
over some of the artificial victories of the German arms.
Twenty-six round trips since the war began was the rec
ord of the faithful old transport, and each time she was
loaded o the gunwale with the luggage of Mars. Shell-)
and airplanes and motor cars, copper and steel, nearly a
billion pounds of munitions had been ferried from Ameri
ca to England in this one hull.
The Mennehaha was a ship of adventure and a deal of
luck. She ran on the Seal Rocks off the Sicilly Islands
In 1910. In July, 1915, when three days out from New
York with a cargo of explosives, she caught fire from
what was undoubtedly a bomb set by the German associ
ates of Frank Holt the would be assassin; but Captain
Clarent took her into Halifax and saved her, just as
Captain Leyland had saved her from the Seal Rocks.
Clarent was the Minnehah's skipper in all her fine war
service. "It's nervous work taking a ship down the
Channel," he said in November, 1914. Probably he did
not find it so nervous after the policy of frightfulness at I
sea began, for doubt no longer remained as to whether
the German submarines would strike the transport if they
could. It was irony that the old single stacker should
have slipped through the perils of sea warfare month at
ter month without escort, only to be reported lost on her
first trip with convoy.
This was the most useful member of a sturdy family of
ships. The Minneapolis lies in the deeps off Malta; the
Minnewaska off Crete. The Minnetonka is afloat, but
shifted to Mediterranean bervlce. The Minnehaha was
familiar to the Jersey commuter, who saw her come and
go in the North River as regularly as if war was unknown.
A Bisbee woman writes the editor in regard to the
editorial assertion that bread is cheaper in England than
it is here. She declares that in a letter received recently
from relatives over there that while the bread is cheaper
it is not wheat bread.
meal are mixed with it. It is war bread. Yes, that is
true, madam, but the fact remains that bread is cheaper
over there. Bran mixed with wheat flour makes a more
wholesome and healthy bread than that made from wheat.
U. OF A. TAKES PLACE

closets, water supply, school furniture,
apparatus, and methods of cleaning
shall be such as to insure hygeuic
condtions for both students and
teachers.
9. The number of hours of work
given by each teacher will vary in the
different departments. To determine
this, the amount of preparation re

my kidneys were in awful shape. I
could hardly mjve, my back was so
lame and stiff. My kidneys were weak
and acted irregularly. The kidney se

to get up often at night to pass them.
When I tried to bend over sharp pains
would dart through my back and I
would become dizzy. A friend told me
about Doan's Kidney Pills and I tried
them. Two boxes completely cured
me. Since then I have used a few Vf

GRAND HEADQUARTERS OF THE
FRENCH ARMIES IN FRANCE. Sept.

counter attacks yesterday, when, with
a specially selected model battalion,
he attempted to evict the French from
positions extending from the north
west corner of the Fosses Wood to the
eastern fringe of Chaume Wood on the
Verdun battlefield.
Forced to Return.
Sprays of liquid flame and a furious
grenade attack followed a terrific Ger
man bombardment of the German
lines but the French troops, undismay
ed by this, went out to meet their as
sailants and beat them back with boy
onet and hand grenade, until the dis
comfited Germans were forced to re
turn to their own trenches.
Hand-to-Hand.
There were many hand-to-hand com
bats between the lines where the Ger
mans now lie thick. Not an inch of
territory was recaptured by the Ger
mans, notwithstanding their extraor
dinary efforts to gain ground in the
neighborhood of Hill 352. which would
be of immense advantage to their ob
servers. Other German attacks fac
ing Bezonvaux and to the south ot
Beaumont were intended to distract
the attention of the French from the
real German objective. Here the Ger
mans came face to face with French
colonial battalions, who hurled the
enemy back, inflicting a large, number
of casulaties and maintaining inviolate
the entire French line.
Three divisions of the crown
prince's army participated in the action.

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water healers are in

terday, returned home late last even
ing. Since Percy became a benedict
the boss of the house does not let him
stay away from home long at a time.

jered the use of it and expects to go
back to the trenches. His letter was
sent from England and was partially
censured.
REPAIRING ROAD.
County Engineer Ryan has put a
force of men at work on the road be
tween here and Douglas to fix up the

out from Douglas this way and an
other force may be added to start from
this end.

THIS MEDICINE
WOMEN VALUE
Positively Relieves the
Suffering.
More Convincing Proof.
When Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound was first introduced its cur
ttive powers were doubted and had to
be proved. But the proof came, and
gradually the use of it spread over the
whole country. Now that hundreds of
thousands of women have experienced
the most beneficial effects from its use
its value has become generally recog
nized and it js now the standard medi
cine for women's ills.
The following letter is only one of the
thousands on our files.
Dennison, Texas. "I cannot feel
that I have done my duty until I tell
what Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound has done for me. I suffered
from female troubles so I could hardly
drag around and do my work. I was
very nervous, and had dizzy spells, heat
flashes, and headaches until life was a
burden. My husband brought me a bot
tle of Lydia E. Pinkham s Vegetable
Compound and I soon began to improve.
I continued its use and am now free
from all pains and aches that made life
a burden. You may use this letter in
any way you like for I want the world
to "know what a grand medicine Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound is."

RUSSELL FEATURED
AT ORPHEUM TODAY
IN "THE FRAME-UP"
William Russell Is being starred at
the Orpheum today in "The Frame
up." The picture will also be shown
tomon'jw. Russell, in one episode of
"The Frame-up," In which he is star
red, turns a back somersault out of a
speeding automobile to register a sen
sational escape. He somersaulted out
of that car no less than twenty times
before the camera caught him just
precisely as Director Edward SlOman
wished to have him caught. As a re
sult Russell needed the services of his
physician many times.
In practicing a leap from the ton
neau of one speeding motor car to the
runing. board of another, he shifted
his right knee cap. The expression
of Russell's face, well trained as he
is, indicates that he is not exactly
happy as he clings to the side of the
car.
It Is some undertaking to be an
athletic motion picture star.
