WILSON SAYS "CLARIFY COUNSEL"
IS ONLY NEED FOR RATIFICATION
t
Four More Republican Senators at White
House Daily Conferences; Sen.Hitchcock
In Consultation With President.
Misunderstandings About Treaty Due to Construction Placed
OrT Its Interpretation Only, Says President.
WASHINGTON", July 18. President
Wilson talked over the peace treaty
with four more Republican senators at
ilia Wake IWotxt Knlay aitd hca: went
to ' the capital and discussed the en
tire senate ' situation with Senator
Hitchcock, leader of the administra
tion forces in the ratification fight.
The Republican senators asked for
information about many features and
Senator . Hitchcock told the president
of other points that have come Into
dispute during Benate debate. At the
end of the day' Mr. Wilson! told a
group of correspondents he was sitis
fled that to reach a solution It was
only necessary to "clarify counsel.'
There has been many misunder
standings about the treaty, the presi
dent said, adding that som of the con
structors placed on it seemed to him
evident misinterpretations.
Senator McNary, Oregon, one of the
Republicans, who went to the White
House, said first impressions about the
Shantung settlement had been soften
ed by his talk with the president,
Irhlle Senator Capper, Kansas, said
fr. Wilson had given him much new
and pertinent information on that sub
ject. - Senator Kellogg, Minnesota, and
Senator Kenyon, Iowa, the others who
saw the president,: declined to talk.
Senator McNary has been a 'supporter
of the League of Nations, whlla the
other three never have taken a defi
nite stand.
"I found myself practically In ac
cord with the president regarding the
principles of the League," said Mr.
McNary. "though- I had and still have
certain opinions regarding the effect
of reservations. I shall announce
these opinions in my address next
week in the senate. Regarding Shan
tung, the president possesses Tacts
which soften first impressions o fthe
provision."
"The president was very ready to
tdve Information about the negotia
tions,' Mr. Capper said, "and he has a
great deal of it, especially regarding
Shantung that Is to. the point. How
ever, I have not changed my opinion
that certain ' reservations are neces
sary In ratifying the treaty.'
Senator ' Hitchcock described the
president as . feeling "very cheerful
over the senate outlook, though, he
aid, Mr. Wilson did not discuss what
the Republican senators had said at
the White House. The Nebraska sen
ator said he had told the president It

was assured that the treaty could not
be amended. One result of the day's
conferences was to strengthen the re
port that the president might soon
send to the senate a special message
regarding Shantung. v
Some of the Republican senators
have told Mr. Wilson Interpretive res
ervations would have to be accepted
to secure ratification of the treaty,
but Mr. Hitchcock said tonight he did
not believe reports that the president
would be willing to accept such reser
Tations provided they did not vitiate
the treaty provisions.
"We shall continue our fight," said
the administration leader, "for rati
fication of the treaty without a single
change.'
The foreign relations committee
adjourned until Monday. The senate
also adjourned to Monday, when de
bate on the treaty will be resumed.
At his conference with. Republican
senators today. President Wilson is
understood to have taken a definite
stand against entering the League ol
Nations with any idea of withdraw
ing as soon as the immediate ..issues
of the war have been finally settled.
He is said to have re-emphasized his
conviction that article ten of the
League covenant must not be weak
ened if the League is to accomplish
its purpose.
The Fall amendment which start
ed discussion of peace issues in the
senate would have provided that the
"status of peace between the former
imperial government of Germany and
the United States of America being
declared." no money appropriated In
the sundry civil bill should be used
to enforce teh trading with the ene
my act.
Senator Fall said his. purpose was
only to facilitate trading with Ger
many while the peace treaty is pend
ing. He asserted that a "propaganda
was bringing 'pressure .to bear for a
ratification of the treaty" so that full
trade relation might me resumed and
said his amendment would accom
plish the same purpose without has
tening ratification.
Pro-ratification senators, however,'
immediately challenged the amend
ment as an effort to actually declare
"by Indirection" a status of peace.
When the proposal was threatened
with rejection on a point of order,
Mr. Fall struck out the reference to
a peace status and the senate voted
down the amendment as it thenp
stood.

FORD CASE
Atty's Lead Plaintiff
Through Maze of
Varied Questions.
Ford's Attorneys Characterize
ueiense Questions "Inhuman
And Brutal."
JWI NT CLEMEN'S, Mich., July 18.
Although Henry Ford today completed a
week on the witness stand in his libel
suit against the Chicago Daily Tribune,
Elliott O. Stevenson, tor th defendant,
who began questioning him last Monday,
showed no signs or reaching a conclu
ston.
The questioning of the witness on the
contents of the alleged libelous editorial
In the Tribune -on June 23, 191$, headed
rord Is an Anarchist," was the import
ant feature of the day. Alfred Lucking,
senior counsel for the plaintiff, character
ized the examination as "brutal" and the
witness, pressed to admit the editorial
charge of being an "ignorant idealist"
and reminded that on previous occasions
he had admitted It. remarked: ,
"You are a good enough attorney to get
mo to say this or that but It would not
be in my mind."
"Haven't I tried to be fair with you.
Mr. Fordr
"Absolutely."
"I have not tried to mislead your
"No. sir."
It was here that Mr. Lucking made his
charge of brutality, adding:
"You take a modest witness, Mr. Stev
enson, and try to pound him into saying
that he Is an Ignorant Idealist. It seems
to me that this should be 14ft to argu
ment."
"Have I been pounding you, Mr. Ford?"
asKea Mr. Stevenson; "Mr. Lucking Is
talking through his hat. Isn't he?"
"He Is talking as though you may,"
was the way the stenographer caught
the reply of Mr. Ford, who speaks in so
low and muffled a tone that his own law
yers rarely hear him. f
. Jntsklng up th editorial. Mr. Steven
son said: - ' '
"What la the office of the headline or
an editorial. Mr. Ford?" .
"I don't know what you have reference
to?"
Mr. Stevenson explained a headline
suggests what is In the body of the ar
ticle under it, and reminded the witness
that in previous testimony he had de
fined an anarchist as a bomb thrower or
one who seeks to overturn government.
"What was said In the editorial about
bomb throwing, Mr. Ford?"
"Nothing that I know of. only in the
headline."
r The lawyers then began reading the
editorial.
Mr. Stevenson had asked Mr. Ford to
stop him If he came to anything about
bomb throwing or overturning the gov
ernment and after reading, about 75
words reminded the witness that he had
not been stopped.
"You have read the headline, Mr. Ste
venson?"
"Yes, Mr. Ford."
"Well, you can stop right there."
"The headline. Mr. Ford, you said was
to Indicate what was In the articlye. I
am reading the article so you can com
pare it with the headline. You don't
find anything about bomb throwing r
overturning the government?"
"Only in the headline."
The lawyer continued to read the edi
torial, making after each paragraph the
same Inquiry and receiving the same
negative reply.
Mr. Ford said to Mr. Stevenson:'
"I will rive you a little explanation of
the way I felt. I. myself, very seldom
read anything else except the headlines
oY any article, that Is one of the ob
jects of this case, to try and have peo
ple stick to the truth a little more be
hind their headlines."
Mr. Stevenson made another attempt
to get the witness to confess that he was
an ignorant man, as the lawyer said
was shown by his Inability to answer
questions concerning cardinal points of
American history, the army and navy
and similar matters. Mr. Ford turned to
the Judge:
"Does he want me to say that I don't
know anything about government?"
The court remained silent and Mr. Ste
venson continued:
"I have asked you a number of ques
tions, and I do not want to press you as
to whether you are a weU Informed man.
competent to educate the public, or an
Ignorant man. who, ought not to under
take to educate' the people, but in view
of what you have said, you would not
question that 'Ignorant' Is a proper
characterisation of you?"
Mr. Lucking jumped to his feet and
said:
"That is objected to as brutal and In
human." Mr. Ford Ignored this and remarked:
"As I said. Mr. Stevenson. I am ig
norant of most things."
In one comment on the editorial Mr.
Ford said he considered the whole ar
ticle as bad. When Mr. Stevenson
read the statement that "He takes the
men who stand between him and serv
ice, and punishes them for the service
which protects him." Mr. Ford said that
It ws.s not true.
"Do you claim that you did not dis
charge men from military "service?" .,
"Yea. sir."
"But you boasted that as a result of
your antl-preparednesa efforts only ten
of your 20,000 employes attended a militia
encampment?"

RATE REDUCED
WASHINGTON. July 18. Postmas
ter General Burleson today reduced
the postage rate on airplane mail to
two cents an ounce, the regular rate
for first class mail, and placed the
air service on the same bast with
all other classes of mail transtvirtn-
tion.
Postmaster General Burleson. In
making the announcement of the re
duction of air post mail, said:
The successful operation of the
air mall route for more than one
year and the great development for
commercial work in the airplane in
tnat period has taken this phase of
mail transportation entirely out of
the class of experimental work. The
mail saving of time now effected
over the fastest railroad train be
tween New York and Chicago will
enable the department to make a
saving in car space of more than
twice the cost of operation of an
aerial mail service on that route. It
will therefore no longer be necessary
to charge more than the regular rate
of postage for the transmission of
airplane mail.

The embargo has been foreshadowed
for several days as a consequence of the

freight, much of it perishable, at Atlantic

CDL GREENWAY RETURNS TO DIST.
U.S. SENATORIAL TOGA HOLDS LURE
FDR VETERAN OFTIO MRS
Colonel John C. Greenway, who
entered the army as a major of engi
neers and went to France early In
tne conflict with Germany, served
with distinction in that arm of the
service, later was made a lieutenant
colonel and commanded an infantry
regiment in the Argonne battles, was
gassed, and since arriving in, this
country two months ago has been re
covery as complete.
Colonel Greenway told' a Review
representatives that he is now feel
ing fine and regards his recovery as
complete. It Is his intention to
leave shortly for a fishing trip on
Black river In the northern part of
the state.
p , jJted as to his future program the
Colonel said that as yet it was indefi
nite, but stated that at present he Is
not general manager of the Calumet
& Arizona Mining Company, a posi
tion which ho held before going to
France.
Recently while Colonel Greenway
was in New York a story was pub
lished throughout Arizona -to the
eifect that he interested the required
capital to construct a railroad from
Ajo to Tucson and from Ajo to a port
osuth of that camp on the Gulf of
Lower California. When asked about
this Colonel Greenway said that none
of. these stories was authorized by
him, but he regarded this railroad
enterprise as one of the most import
ant for the future of Arizona, as It
would be a great benefit to every
mining company and every other
large industrial enterprise within the
commonwealth. , .
Favors League of Nations
When asked about the league of na
tions he said that he was in favor
of a league that will prevent future
wars, as he has had his fill of war,'
along with all those who went to
France to defend the flag. "My idea
of the league," said Colonel Green
way, "is that it must preserve abso
lutely the Monroe doctrine and ex
tend it to other parts of the world
so that it will be the duty of the great
nations of the world to see to it that
stable government is maintained in
their particular zones, as for instance
it would be the duty of this country
to help Mexico to maintain such gov
ernment as would guarantee every
interest there," whether owried by na
tives of the country or foreigners."
In Receptive Mood
Colonel Greenway said that he ex
pects to remain a citizen of Arizona.
Asked as to the possibility of his
, entering political life, the colonel re
plied that if the people of the state
desired him to represent them in the
United States' senate nothing would
please him more. It will be recalled
that he is always taking an active
Interest in politics, though never
candidate for public office. Speaking
of politics the colonel said that he
saw little difference now between the
two major, parties aside from the va
rying views on the league of nations
and these do not divide purely on
party lines. .
Put Ajo on the Map
Colonel Greenway held the position
of general manager of the Calumet
& Arizona Mining company and the
New Cornelia company for ten years
and it was under his direction that
Ajo was developed into one of the
great copper districts of the south
west- - The mines were developed and
a 1 reduction plant devised and con
structed for the treatment of a lower
grade ore- than- had ever before been
successfully treated; a railroad was
bilt ' to Ajo - from Gil Bend 01F the
Southern Pacific and the New Corne
lia started on its : successful career
before Colonel Greenway left, for the
seat of war in , Europe. . r .
The hosts of friends of Colonel
Greenway will be glad to know that
he has decided to continue his home
la Arizona and they will expect to
aee him identified in some way with
tlve. future development of the great
resources or the state.
; Colonel Greenway commanded the
101st Infantry in the Meuse-Argonne
battle in France and was : gassed
while there. He entered the army
as an officer in the Engineers but M
his own request was transferred to
the infantry branch, and was in the
battle of Castigny. Chateau-Thierrv,
or. imniei, ana tne Argonne. He was
cited ' for special bravery in.- action
In the Argonne drive and was award
ed the' French War Cross and the

to the private soldiers and the jun
ior officers of the line who did the
real fighting. They showed the
same American spirit as the boys iu
Cuba did c'uring the Spanish-American
war where Colonel Greenway
was an officer in the Rough Riders
with Theodore Roosevelt.
In view of the announcement that
Col. John C. Greenway is shortly go
ing to start construction on his rail
way from Ajo to Bay St. George, at
the head of the Gulf of California, in
formation as to the character of this
little known sea, is of great interest.
Probably the only authority on the
head of the Gulf of California in Ari
zona is Professor Gddfrey Sykes of
the Desert laboratory, in fact, he is
probably one of the few living au
thorities on this body of water. Mr.
Sykes almost lost his life in this ad
venture in- the waters at the head
of the gulf. When asked for an in
terview on the character of the sea,
Mr. Sykes said: i
"The head of the Gulf of Californ
ia is today almost as much of a mare
incognito (unknown sea) as it was
in the days of Father Kino.
Early Explorations
"It was explored and roughly map
ped first by the Alarcon expedition
in 1540-1542, but It was not until the
Spanish padres. Kino, Garces and
Courar, made their maps during the
eighteenth century that much was
known about it.
"Liuet. Hardy of the British navy
made his well known survey in 1829.
"Lieut. G. H. Derby, of the United
States topographical survey, carried
out a reconnoissance survey, of the
head of the gulf in 1851 under orders
from the war .department.
Capt. C. M. Conrad and Capt. Dew
ey (who later became an admiral)
visited the gulf in the 70's and re
ported on 'the hydrography, meteorol
ogy and general condition. This re
port forms the basis of all the infor
mation in modern charts and used by
coast guides.,
A Forbidden Shore
"Much of this information is mis
leading in the light of modern con
ditions. The opening of the Panama
canal and the consequent publicity
of carrying freight to and from the
gulf ports direct to Europe and the
Atlantic ports of the United States
without breaking bulk means of
course that ports and anchorage
which were perfectly satisfactory in
the days of Dewey and his Narragan-
sett survey would not suffice for mod
ern cargo carriers able to make the
Atlantic trip.
"The Sonora shore for the first one
hundred miles or so below the mouth
of the Colorado is unfortunately a
'lee shore,' for much of the bad
weather which is encountered there
tbouts.
"The prevailing winds during the
season from November to April are
from the northwest to west north
west, and Jn .conjunction with the
heavy tides from the head of the gulf
make good holding ground very es
sential along this stretch of coast in
the absence of real shelter.
"The worst storms are from south
east, generally occur in September
or October, and here . again ' -hut lit

water is sufficiently deep to afford
anchorage for a modern vessel.
Bays Are Shallow
Adair Bay is quite impossible. It
is full of shoals and tide rips, and
anything over over 20 tons, which
might perhaps, fit under the lee of
the bank, could do nothing there.
"Bay St. George is not much better.
A little shelter might be found in the
extreme lower end, but .only for a
small craft.
"There is, however, a small bay be
tween these two which might bear
investigation.
, "It is many years since I have vis
ited the head of the gulf and my notes
on the. subject have gone astray, so
I am writing from memory. There is
at the head of- the gulf what is known
as Rocky Point Bay. .
"It . lies between Rocky Bluff and
Rocky Point. It 13 small, but might,
I think, be improved by means of a
mole or jetty so as to allow a freight
boat of modern dimensions say up
to 3000 tons lie almost alongside.
This would be worth considerable on
a coast where everything has here
tofore been done by lightering to an
open roadstead.
"This bay is about 45 miles in a
direct line from the United States
boundary, and is certainly the most
northerly point at which one might
hope to find a harbor.
"The tides in the head of the gulf
are very heavy. I have notes in my
possession of some which . I have
measured in which the vertical range
was well, over 40 feet. This is only
exceeded upon the coasts of either
of the Americas by the tides in the
Bay of Fundy.
"I am inclined to think that tbi9
small bay could be developed Into a
shipping port for southern Arizona
points " more suitable than Lobos or
Libertad. Ithas the further dvan
tage of furnishing an inexhaustible
supply of stone close at hand for jet.
ty or wharf building. The depth of
water in the cove, as I remember it.
was about 7 or 8 fathoms (42 to 48
feet) at low spring tides.
"There is as far as I know no water
in the vicinity. Lumholtz, however,
found water 'strongly brackish' a few
miles -farther up the" coast at La
Cholea, where he camped on his
trip from the mouth of the Colorado
to Sonita.
"Approach to this harbor would be
down the drainage of the Sonorita
river to the south of the Pinacate
range, and thence up the coast for
some four or five miles. In this way
the grea't sand hills which lie direct
ly' between Pinacate and the lower
end of the Adair bay might be
avoided.
Carl .Lumholtz was very close to
this bay in 1910 and reported the two
headlands as 'looking like small is
lands. The appearance from the sea
is - quite different.
"The Ferguson expedition, from
.Tucson to the gulf was carried out
under orders of Edward M.Stanton,
secretary of war, in 1862. by 'Major.
Ferguson and an escort of 17 men
of the First California cavalry. Fer

TINY MONTENEGRO TALKS WAR
SHE IS VOLCANO OF BALKANS
By WILLIAM WARFIELD
Special Dispatch to the N. E. A.
CETTINJE Montenegro is in an
eruptive spirit as she faces the crisis
of peace.
The tiny Balkan state that was one
of the original allies having declared
war on Austria August 7, 1914
emerges from war wiped off the map
of Europe, swallowed up in the new
Jugo-Slavia.
And now Montenegro doesn't know
whether she likes it or not.
Torn by dissension at home, shorn
of her king who lives in exile in Paris,
only at war with her own Moham
medan subjects, in the territory ac
quired in the Falkan wars, and on
the verge of hostilities with Italy
Montenegro needs a. friend.
There is very bad feeling in Mon
tenegro toward Italy, growing out ol
the general Jugo-Slav 'antagonism
aroused by Italy's aspirations on the
eastern coast of the Adriatic. Prac
tically the. whole Dalmation coast is
occupied by Italian troops, with a
sprinkling of French who alone keep
the peace between Italian and Jugo
slav. There is bad feeling in Cattaro,
which was Austrian before the war,
though the mountains behind were
Montenegrin. But it is far from be
ing as serious as in Antvari, or Bar,
originally a Venetian colony.
The present government is backed
chiefly by Montenegrin troops, but it
has also a much smaller number of
Serbs. All of these are . considered
Jugo-Slavs, since the proclamation ot
the kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes.
Curiously, enough the only troops 1
have seen worthy of the name of
Jugo-Slavs are from America, and
speak English to a man. , They are
volunteers of Jugo-Slav race, recruit
ed in America, chiefly from the mines
and steelworks. Most of them that
I talked with were born under the
Austrian flag, a few only were origim
ally subjects of Nicholas ,or Peter of
Serbia.
.... They are unselfish Juvo-Slavs, with
out regional, tribal or religious affilia
tionsdistinctively different from the
old type that cause the bitter, jeal
ousy in Balkan affairs and set neigh
bors to cutting each other's throats to
the joy and profit of the outsider.
These American Jugo-Slavs are the
only men who can save Montenegro
f rom herself the men who must pre
vent a disastrous eruption in this
volcano of the Balkans. .
In Montenegro itself there are three
shades of political- opinion, royalists,
federalists and unionists. The royal
1st party, desiring the return of King
Nicholas . to the throne, is a very
small minority, but has shown con
siderable military activity. In cen
ters in Nicholas' own family, the
Petrovitch tribe, with its headquar
ters at Negush. In December a de
termined attack was made from there
troops we errushed over the Lorchen
pass from Cattar0, and dld more tnan
anyone else to prevent serious loss
of life. The remnant of the revolu
tionary force surrendered to the
BE VERf HlVUGOY-
and is not important enougn to cause
armed revolt. The federalist party is
in favor of retaining Montenegro as a
federal unit in the contemplated Jugo
slav state The unionists are working
for complete union with Serbia, to the
end that all the orthodox Jugo-Slavs
may be together in one unit of the new
kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slo
venes. '
Roughly speaking the people of the
old regions around Cettinje original
Montenegro before 1852 are inclined
to tha federalist party; and the peo
pie of the regions acquired in 1878
when the Russo-Turkish war really
made a nation out of Montenegro are
unionists.
As the loyalists are practically all
from among the former group, the
strongest of the three parties is the
unionist. Exact figures are not ob
tainable, because of the general un
rest, and because of the fact that the
peasant is not very well informed as
to the exact issues at stake.
The government now in power has
a brother of the late queen for its
nominal head, Voyvoda Voukotitch,
and fir its party leader a member of
the strong Radovitch family. This gov
ernment is fast making an accomplish
ed fact of the union with Serbia.
The fall of Nicholas is scarcely to
be regretted, in spite of the fact that
he did a great deal for his country,
pressing its claims before the powers,
and developing a splendid system of
highways without which even the most
important towns would have been in
accessible as in Turkish times. The
fact is that he did not keep pace with
Uhe really astonishing progress of civi
lization in the Balkans during the last
quarter of a century. As he grew older
and hi3 countrymen awakened to the
possibilities of improving their lot,
Nicholas became reactionary, and is
largely to blame for the fact that the
Montenegrin is far behind the Serb in
all forms of education.
The chief topic of talk. In Montene
gro today is of war with Italy over the
disposition of the Dalmation coast
cities, claimed by both sides. The
Jugo-Slav is hot blooded and always
ready for a fight witness the unhesi
tating manner in which Serbia took up
tne challenge of Austria in 1914, and
the rapidity with ' which Montenegro
declared war.
After seven years of war he thinks
of little else; his standards are differ
ent from ours, and he must be handled
with tact and firmness. His demands
are beyond all reason, and if granted,
would only get him . into trouble, as
Montenegro was involved in endless
difficulties by the Albanian lands
ceded to her in 1913. But it is being
widely urged that he be discriminated
against. And he would justly resent it
at the cost perhaps of further war,
now or in the near future. .
Unquestionably the greatest pacify,
ing and constructive influence in Mon
tenegro today is the American Red
Cross. Its mission is anything but po
litical, but it is winning the confidence
of the Montenegrins and setting stand
dards for them in home and industrial
reconstruction.
Everything in printing, quality
work, lowest prices, done in the only
modernly equipped plant in Cochise
county.

THE AMERICAN LEGION.
TUB AMERICAN LEGION, Arizona Branch, is now safely
cn its way to success. Its organization meeting, held in this
city last Friday and Saturday witnessed, at times squally
weather, but the end saw clear sailing and a brilliant lutura
predicted for it.
Delegates from every county in the state, with tho exception cf
Apache, were on hand to participate in the inauguration of the Le
gion. That they all participated is proven by a casual glance at the
notes of the secretary. Every man, whether he was a lowly prirate
in the rear rank during the war or a colonel bristling with decorations,
had his say if he wanted it. The meeting was distinctive, if only for
that point alone.
Some of the delegates came to Tucson prepared to vote the "of
ficer" element into the discard. At first there seemed to be a dis
position to follow such a lead in the convention. It gradually dawned
on the delegates, however, that all in attendance were civilians; that
there were no privates and no generals. AH were on exactly the
same level. The result of this change of feeling was the recognition
of the value and weight of those men who had served their country
as officers, during the war.
In' selecting the delegates to attend the national convention,
the delegates selected five officiers and one enlisted man. There was
no thought of whether or not the men selected wore shoulder straps.
There was no thought of "class" distinction. The vote indicated that
the delegates wanted the best representation that Arizona could
furnish. The convention undoubtedly acted wisely and well.
The resolutions of the Legion, adopted Saturday, might well be
adopted by many other organization. Those resolutions stand for
Americanism. They stand for a continual fight against the autocracy
of the masses and the classes. The stand for a fair deal, a square
deal to all and favors to none. The resolutions asked for nothing
for the former soldier that he is not entitled to. They made no ex
horbitant demands on the government of the country, on the state or
on the average citizen.
Freedom of thought and of action characterized the Legion
meeting. The delegates selected competent officials w;ho will guide
its destinies for the next year. The constitution, by-laws and reso
lutions speak volumes for the intent and determination of the for
mer service men of Arizona.
If we guess it right, tho American Legion, Arizona Branch, will
actually "put something into the government of Arizona." (Tucson
Star.) .
M
THE NEW COMMANDER.
AJOR. GENERAL HENRY T. ALLEN, who succeeds Lieu
tenant General Liggett as commander of the AmeritHn ar
my of occupation, was much admired both as a soldier and
a man by President Roosevelt.
General Allen was a member of the general staff and saw ser
vice in Cuba as a volunteer officer; but he will best be remembered
by his administrative work in the Philippines. He organized the con
stabulary of the islands and he was for some' time governor of Leyte.
The islanders liked him so well that they gave him a special vote of
thanks.
The same tact and common, sense which he displayed in tne
Philippines will evidently be needed along the Rhine before the last
American Boldier comes home.
Major General Allen was in command at Fort Huachuca ten years
ago. He attended the ceremonies held on the occasion of the open
ing of the Tucson and Nogales railroad in 1D1(L He has many per
sonal friends and admirers in Tucson, who are glad to see him given
such a responsible pest and. one which he is so well qualified to fill.
Maj. Gen. Allen is well remembered by many residents .of Bisbee
Warrcu district. He has many warm friends who are glad to note
that the General's record has met with well deserved recognition by
the war department.
T
HERE has Desn much speculation .since the. war why the goT-
jrnment invariably seems to do everything - inefficiently.
'art of tha reason may be found in these three maxims for
success that became current among cynical men in govern
ment service in the last two years:
1. "Bass the buck.
2 Spread the bull.
3. Remember, your pay goes on just the same.
In a big organization that isn't driven by the necessity for mak
ing a living, the man who sits tight, does his work in a routine way
and makes no disturbing innovation is particularly favored. His
chances are correspondingly increased if he becomes an adept at
dodging responsibility for anything that goes wrong, and at spreading
reassuring even though misleading information about the state of
his department.
The fundamental trouble is the knowledge permeating the gov
ernment organization that Uncle Sam's pocketbook will make good
any losses.
Private business i& often inefficiently handled. But there is al
ways the spur of the need of making a living. It is root, hog, or die.
Unless the management is always on the alert to introduce better
methods and to improve the product or the way it is bandied, the
concern goes to the wall and everybody's pay stops.
The struggle for survival in general keeps the organization keyed
up. So far no incentive has been found to take the place of the
primitive lure of profit.
A company of negro troopers were engaged in practicing the
throwing of hand grenades at their camp in France. For a whole
week they had thrown dummy grenades at the targets and on this
day wen; given the real thing. Thei.- captain placed them in their
respective positions and explained what they were to do, - relates
Everybody's. "When I give the command, 'one', pull out the pin,
at 'two' make ready, and at 'three', throw your bomb and it will do
the rest." Then he issued the commands. At "one" every pin came
out with a click. At "two" all the men made ready to throw except
one shivering darkey,' who hastily threw his grenade at the target.
At "three" all the rest threw with a vengeauce. Then the captain
stepped up to the darkey who had fired away with his grenade at
the command "two" and said, "Sam, why did you throw your bomb
before I gave the comma id 'three'? Why didn't you wait for the
other order, like tho rest of the men?" And Sam replied: "Cap'n. 1
J-h' couldn't wait' I hail to throw nit. I could feel dat thing jes'
a-swellin' and swellin in mah hand:" : ,
Having told the people of tho United Llates how they should
live, the Anti Saloon League of America is now said to be turning
its attention to Great Britain. Thi.-i, at least, is a domestic ques
tion in the British Isles in which we have no conrern. but our ex
ample is bound,to be felt over there.

CITY BUYS $1800 FIELD
FOR AVIATION GROUND
TO PRESENT TO GOVERNMENT
TUCSON, July 18 A block of land
belonging to L. H. -Manning, on the
east side of Sixth avenue, four miles
from the city, just at the point of the
road where the Nogales road turns
east to the . railroad, was selected
Wednesday by Lieutenant C. C. Nutt
of Ellington Field, who arrived Tues
day by airline, as the Tucson avia
tion field.
. The cost of the land was $1800
as against $10,000 asked by Judge
Sawtelle Sor McCauley field. The
land is to be cleared for $30 an acre.
The selection means a big saving
in investment by the city
City Attorney Fritz Bernard and
Malcolm Frazer, secretary of the
chamber of commerce, were busy on
Wednesday preparing the papers.
The contracts and agreements of- the
government were brought by the Hy
ing circus headed by Lieut. Nutt, who
arrived Tuesday. The land is In
many ways superior to MacCauley
field, it is said, because heavy rains
like those that prevail now, have
been known to flood MacCauley field.
The field has a frontage of 1S00
ft. on S. Sixth avenue, and 1800 it.
on the Nogales road. There are pav
ed roads on two sides of it. A tel
ephone line passes the fieid. A well
is on the property. The field is only
a mile and a half beyond the city
limits and eight miles nearer the bor
der than MacCauley field.
The" selection of the site was made
after Lieut. Nutt had an opportunity
to look over .the various sites offer
ed for the purpose.

only the covenant altogether, but
jeopardize the peace treaty. It is to
be hoped that the executive depart
ment will escape from narrowing in
fluences which environ it and see
the wisdom of a tolerant course
which will encourage all senators to
vote as Americans not as either co
erced or irritated partisans. The
president is free to do his duty as
he sees it, and it is time to concede
in fullest measure similar liberty of
action to his partner in the treaty
making.
HAY GRAFT
RIMMED
CAN'T TURN CLOCK BACK
New York Times:
We have recoved the greatest ob
stacles to the prosperity of Eastern
and Southeastern Europe; but the
peoples have suffered greatly, they
cannot rise at once without our help,
and unless we help them some of
them may fall into difficulties whose
ultimate effects wfUl concern even
this side of the Atlantic. Some
Americans may not like- to find the
Balkans in our front yard, but they
cannot turn the clock back a hun
dred years. We are coucerned with
Europe and we are not going to turn
our backs. It is for us to say wheth
er our good offices shall be to Eu
rope's benefit and our own.
rilOENIX. July 18 Late today
federal oflicers made a new move in
their investigation of the alleged hay
graft ring, with reported ramifications
out of the Salt River valley into up
wards of twenty army camps of the
soutnwest, when they arrested Vernon
Peters ot 'Jeuipe, and rearrested his
lather, Allred J. Peters, and J. N.
.luggers of Mesa.
The Peters are hay dealers. Jag
gers is secretary oi the Salt River
Valley Hay Dealers'' association, and
was hay inspector lor Maricopa
county.
Specific instances of alleged false
hay grauing were cited in the war
rants, which includes charges of fraud
conspiracy to defraud the United
States of "large sums tof money" and
direction in commiting fraud In con
nection with the shipping of hay to
the United States government.,"
The elder Peters and Jaggers were
arested two months ago on similar
cnargea and were at liberty on $25,
000 and $10,000 bail respectively. Rec
ords from the offices of botu men
were seized at that time and since then
the federal officers have been con
ducting a minute investigation of the
books, which resulted in today's ac
tion. When arraigned before Tl. s.
( States Commissioner John Henke, the
mree were given their freedom under
bond, Alfred J. Peters 'bail being in
creased to $30,000, Jaggers' bail to $15,
and Vernon Peters' bond was fixed at
$10,0000
Federal officers stated that ship
ment of hay had been made by the
firm of A. J. Peters and son, of Tem
pe, to nearly all the army camps of
the southwest for a considerable per
iod, many of the consignments being
routed through El Paso.

POWER CONWAY VOICES
TUCSON'S HOSPITALITY
TUCSON, July IS That Tucson went
down in the meories of all those ser
vice men who. attended the first. con
vention of the American Legion of
Arizona, as a city of delightful hos
pitality, was indicated Wednesday
by a letter received by Mayor O. C.
Parker from Power Conway, prime or
ganizer of the state convention and
head of the temporary state organ
ization. "On behalf of the temporary state
organization," he wrote, "of the
American Legion, which has now
passed into history with the forma
tion of the permanent organization.
I desire to thank you and the people
of Tucson for the many courtesies
extended during our recent conven
tion. "The arrangements of the enter
tainment committee of your city were
cleverly worked out and executed in
that spirit of delightful hospitality
for which the Old Pueblo is justly
famous.
"Our convention was a great suc
cess and I am satisfied that every
delegate left with a keener patriot
ism and a better appreciation of his
duty, to the; nation than he had on
his arrival,' and when you stop to con
sider that the convention was made
up' 'entirely ot' service men: who had
already given evidence of ' their pa
triotism and loyalty, the above re
mark Is indeed most significant.
"With warm regards I am.
"Cordially yours.
"POWER CONWAY."
MR. MARSHALL'S CRUELTY
New York Sun:
We quote, for the benefit of any
readers who may have missed it,
from the wireless message sent on
Tuesday by Vice President Marshall
to President Wilson: "We'
congratulate you upon the auspicious
ending of your epoch-making mission
and your possession while at the
peace table of that rare blending of
vision and common sense which en
abled you to get all you could see
and not to see anything you could
not get." "Not to see anything you
could not get!" Surely Mr. Marshall
might have spared Mr. Wilson, upon
this happy occasion, the pain of re
membering how he was forced to
turn his eyes from the Fourteen
Points or Principles just before he
abandoned them foreyer!
HENRY FORD'S IGNORANCE
Tucson Citizen:
The public has had a sort of faint
inkling that, aside from the manufac
ture of glorified tin cans, Henry Ford
was not xactly a well read or broad
minded person. But it shocks even
a blase public to read the utter
crudeness of the Ford equipment for
public affairs as disclosed in his own
testimony on the witness stand.
His definition of an idealist as one
who enables another to make a prof
it, his admission that he is a murder
er because he manufactured muni
tions during the war, his confession
that he is an ignorant idealist, his
definition of a ballyho as a black-'
guard, his crowning piece of revela
tion of how great an ignoramus he is
in saying that he recalls the name of
Benedict Arnold as that of a writer
are simply amazing in a man who
has managed to amass millions.
A philosopher once said that the
possession of a talent for acquisite
ness had no relation to sanity or
mental strength. It is manifestly so
in Ford's case.
Yet this puerile, undeveloped
mind, latent both in power and in ed
ucation, sought to end the world
war with a peace ship, was one of
the president's trusted advisers In
the days when we "were too proud
to fight" and later was the Wilson
choice for senator from Michigan, to
be one of the 96 men to pass on the
fundamental character of our ' gov
ernment for a century to come, as it
shall be determined by the action
of the senate on the treaty and the
league.
Henry Ford is not a victim of sim
plicity, but of that much more repre
hensible and too often, not clearly
stated term, simple-mindedness.
That he should seek to control a
nation, to sit in its seuate. is a great
reflection on a nation where every
digger of ditches and section hand
has a better knowledge of history,
has a better vocabulary, has a pro
founder sense of the hard common
sense realities of life than this piece
of well-to-do breadfruit.

Mt. Fires Rage
Uncontrolled in N.W.
SPOKANE. July 18. Ilaclni; over
mountain ridKes or western Montana and
northern Idaho, forest fires, which have
been burning for more than a week,
spread destruction today and threatened
small towns which have been severed by
the flames from communication with the
I nited States forest service headquar
ters at Missoula, Mont.
The fire near Henderson, Mont., jumped
the mountains into the Mullan gulch
country where there is- said to be appar
ently no opportunity to catch.' The fire
near St. liegis, Mont., crossed the Clark
io!K river and late today was spreading
unchecked over a large area.
Only with favorable weather condi
tions is there any possibility of control
ling the flaniL'S. district forest service of
ficials said. Should a high wind arise
there are enough men in this country to
stop the fires, it was declared by Super
visor White of the 1ao forest, in which
the area coveted by the Henderson and
St. HegU fire Is located. It Is costing the
federal forest fervice ? 15,000 daily to
fight the fires In this district, it is said.
Extra fire fighters now in the field num
ber 1510. ln-sides the regular forest serv
ice forces, the extra patrol and construc
tion crews and the trail construction
crews now fighting the fires. The num
ber of men put in the forests by private
timber owners is unavailable. The I'nited
States employment bureau telephoned ev
ery newspaper in western Montana and
to every available place where men may
Ih; found asking that all possible nun le
rushed to forest service offices to meet
the calls for fire fighters.
100,000 Carpenters
Strike in Chicago
CHICAGO, July IS. Although con
tractors and union carpenters showed
no disposition to compromise tonight
after virtually all building operations
had stopped with approximately 100,
000 workers idle, the building trades
council's ' head, Simon O'Donnell, an
nounced today that his organization
never had authorized the strikes of
carpenters and others. He said tho
council would begin consideration or
the situation.
The Building Construction Employ
ers' association stopped all work after
the striking carpenters, 16,000 in
number, had failed to respond to an
ultimatum to return to work.
The carpenters have held out for $1
an hour. The employers' offer of 92
cents was rejected.
ROSS DEMANDS MINE
TAXES OF GILA COUNTY
PHOENIX, July IS. Slate Treas
urer Ross has made formal demand
upon W. W. Brookner, treasurer ot
Gila county, for immediate transmit
tal of the state's proportion of all
taxes collected from the Inspiration
Consolidated Copper company and
the International Smelting company
for the years 1917 and 191S, for which
decision was recently given' by the
state supreme court in the state's
favor against the companies. Ross
says in his letter that the holding ot
the money has cost the state several
thousand dollars in iuterc&t on reg
istered warrants, including ;;n item
of $100,000 Gila road warrants.
The attorney penenil has held that
the slate is entitled to interest on the
state's proportion of the funds, which
has probably been drawing 2 and 4
per cent interest in the Gila county
hanks. Ross wants the interest as
well. The , attorney general has held
that' 'the money must be 'transmitted
within ten days from notification by
the state treasurer.
The amount of money due the state
is estimated at half a" million dollars.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 18. The final
session of the week on the stock ex
change, a recess having been ordered
for tomorrow, was characterized by
further erratic fluctuations of prices,
traceable in large part to increased
selling.
Motors and their better? known spe
cialties, oil and equipments, embrac
ing the various steel and iron com
panies, tobaccos, leathers and sundry
specialties were conspicuous in the
ebb and flow of the more moderate
dealings, the transportations showing
relative backwardness, save for a few
of the low grade issues.
Prominent among the advances of
the day were Stutz Motors, which
made an extreme gain of 10 points to
the new record of 124, Stromberg
Carburetor, 4; United States Indus
trial Alcohol, 3; Royal Dutch issues
an average of almost 2 points, General
Cigars 4, and Keystone Tire 4 points,
with Missouri, Kansas and Texas lead
ing the rails at a 2 point gain. Sales
1,475,000 shares.
Bond dealings broadened. Liberty is
sues reflecting firmness, the interna
tional division holding steadv and
leadine rails, and industrials showine
no material changes. Total sales, par
value, $14,250,000. Old United States
bonds unaltered on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. July 18. Severe set-
V w, VUi; JLJ. Cl C DCl"
backs in the price of corn resulted to-
day from liatidation to which holders
were largely prompted by financial
and labor unrest. The market then
rallied somewhat and closed unset -
tied, 2c to 4V4c net lower, with Sep
tember $1.90 to $1.90V4 and December
$1.59- to $1.60. Oats finished lc
to lc down and provisions off 55c to4Hec,a ' 5 9-16
$1.30,
Disturbed economic conditions took
precedence over all other faqtors most
of the time today in the corn market
Meanwhile, sharp attention was given
also to the increase of labor difficul
ties ,and it became evident that for
the first time of late, the confidence
of rural bulls had been shown to a
considerable extent. Unusually persis
tent selling developed, and prices
dropped in some cases 6 cents a bushel
before a reaction began. Commission
houses led the buying cautiously on
the late upturn.
Oats were governed chiefly by the
depressing factors which put corn on
the down grade.
Provisions tumbled with cereals. In
addition, labor troubles at the stock
yards here added to bearish sentiment
and so, too, did reports of abnormal
domestic supplies of meats, butter and
eggs.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW.
SATURDAY, JULY 19, 1919.
FIRE CHIEF
FOR NO. HOUSES
J5arney Norton, chief of Bisbee fire
depart nient, in speaking of the pro
posed plan of numbering the streets of
bisboe, stated that he has waited a
long time for some action of that kind
and if it is put into 'operation will save
the property owners a lot of money
in preventing fire losses.
With no system in vogue at the
present time it makes necessary the
knowledge on the part of the firemen;
of every resident in the city and their
names, which is manifestly an impos
sible thing as so many are constantly
moving.
They get a call of fire at Masons,
and it might be Mason's market. Ma
son addition or Mason's house. They
ot a call once to a fire next to where
Urophy used to live and that is about
as definite as anyone can give direc
tion to find a place in Bisbee.
Some houses have numbers on them
now and when the family moves tney
take the number with them to the
new location, thus we have No. 9 on
one side of a street and No. 77 on the
other side just opposite. There Is a
case in upper Tombstone where a
house was moved a block up the can
yon and the same old number left on
and still being used.
There is another question that is
puzzling some people and that is
where Main street leaves off and
where Naco road commences. A num
ber of the streets should be renamed
to conform to a well planned system.
Mr. Norton say that this plan wilt
be the biggest help the fire depart
ment can get at present in locating a
lire when it is reported.

Hibernians' Ass'n
Condemn Socialism
In Frisco Convention
SAN FRANSCISfO, July IS "The
brave aud generous Irish people who
have struck a mighty blow for true
democracy." were hailed in resolu
tions adopted by the ancient, order
of Hibernians in America and Can
ada in National convention here to
day. .
Socialism was condemned in other
convention received with favorable
action; efforts for the spread of Cath
olic education were commended and
devout reverence acknowledged to
the Catholic church and Pope Ben
edict. Stringent immigration laws were
depreciated. Repeal by congress of
the literacy test for immigrants was
urged.
The repcrt of the foreign relations
commTttee submitted today would
place the order firmly on record as
opposed to any pact eatered into by
the United States that might "merge
the identity" of the nation.
In addressing a joint session of the
delegates to the next national con
vention of the Ancient Order of Hi
bernians and the iadies auxiliary,
ICainonn de Valera declared:
"I believe a democracy in England
would free the English as well as
ourselves." " -
The Right Reverend Bishop M.
J.' Gallagher of Detroit, who preceded
de Valera, said:
"We will win Irish independence
with the aid of the democracy of the
labor party of England which has
risen to overthrow, the government
and establish a real democracy in
which Irish independence is in
cluded.' De Valera said:
"It would be an act of despair in
God's justice and goodness if we were
to think our cause a failure. In or
der that Foland might be freed three
mighty empires had to fall. With
the triumph of Poland before us, no
one can feel that Ireland is going to
fail. It may be necessary to have
another period of conflict and world's
strife to change the c';l order, but it
depends on America whether that pe
riod will be necessary.
"The present covenant of the
Leaguo of Nations is merely a modi
fication of the old Holy Alliance. Ire
land demands her place in a real
League of Nations."
Discussing Colonial home rule, de
Valera raid it was a name without
meaning.

ion by the fecjeral wire control board
