LONDON. Aug. 15. Lon
doners celebrated today a
second American day
when a large contingent of
American troops from a train
ing camp marched through the
heart of the capital in response
to a popular demand that its
citizens should see and greet
the visitors, whose presence
and characteristics have com
manded a remarkable degree of,
popular attention. j
Britishers are not demonstrative
and the movements of their own and
even colonial troops through London
during the war have not aroused the
people, but the let themselves go to
day and, as the editor of the Specta
tor predicted, their cheers almost
made the buildings rock. American
flags were displayed everywhere on !
government offices, business houses
and residents and many people wore
American colors.
King George, Queen Mary, Dowager
Queen Alexandra and other royalties
reviewed the parade1 in the fourt fac
ing Buckingham Palace. American
Ambassador Page and Vice Admiral
Sims reviewed the parade from the
American embassy. The British cab
inet suspended its meetings to watch f
the Americans march through White
hall. Foreign Secretary Baltour, Gen
eral Robertson, of the general staff.
Lord Derby, secretary of state for
war; Admiral Jellicoe and Field-Marshal
French were among the many of
ficials who saluted the American flag
from the balconies of government of
fices. The guard of honor was composed
of a detchmerit of one hundred Scots
guards and the marchers were attend
ed at the palace by all the famous
guoard bands, English, Scotch and
Irish. They escorted the parade
playing American tunes to Trafalgar
Square, where several hundred wound
ed British soldiers had seats. Ttfls
wrs the'scene of the greatest demon
stration. King Salutes Old Glory.
The newspapers agree that London
has witnessed only two or three event
of so much enthusiasm within the
memcry of the present generation.
The greatest crowd gathered in front
of Buckingham Palace.' The King,
accompanied by the Queen, the house
hold staff and officers, took his place
at the gate. The Americans then filed
past, oHicers at salute, while the band
played amid cheers and waving of
flags.
When the Stars and Stripes passed
with the ranks the king with his party
raised their hands In salute. The flag
was dipped and the crowd roared ap
proval so vigorously that the King
was forced to smile.
A light rain fell during the review
but not a spectator departed.
After the review the Americans
camped temporarily on the part near
the palace. There they rested and had
lunch, after which they resumed their
inarch through the city, the earlier
being repeated. Later they departed
from Waterloo station.
Press Praises Toops.
The evening newspapers united in
praise of American soldiers.
The standard displays on the front
pase the large head-line; "Sons ot
the Pilgrims back in London," under
which It rpad:
'They are a distinct set of men of
a definite type. In the snap of the eye
and the expression of the mouth.
there is something distinctly United

PETROGRAD. August 15. The
semi-official -Russian news
agency announced tonight
that former Emperor Nich
olas and his family were removed
- today from the palace at Tsars-koe-SoIe
and that it was reported
they were being transported to
Tobolsk. Siberia.
Instead of the gorgeous imperial
train on which Nicholas was tak
en to Tasrskoe-Selo from Mohil
ev in March, an ordinary train of
three sleepingcars, a dining car
and several third-class coaches
was sent. A second train was
assigned to take the baggage and
servants, fift yof whom accom
panied the ex-emperor and his
family into exile.
Nicholas. Depressed.
Empress Pleased.
Nicholas was very depressed in
appearance but ex-Empress Alex
andra seemed pleased at the pros
pect of a change in surroundings.
An hour after the train arrived
Nicholas appeared on the steps of
the palace, dressed in a colonel's
uniform with a khaki blouse and
no decoration. He entered an
Dolgoroukoff and Count Bencken
automobile, accompanied by
Prince Dolgoroukoff and Count
Benckendorff, former court mar
shal, who thus far have shared his
captivity. They were followed by
the former Empress Alexandra,

Regents Meeting

nor Thomas E. Campbell, the newly
created public institutions commission,
the regents of the Arizona State Uni
versity and President von Kleinsmldt
of the university held two sessions
here at the university today .to or
ganize the work of the university for
the coming year. Immediately after
the last session Governor Campbell
left with the members of the commis
sion for Phoenix by automobile. He
would have nothing to say about the
Bisbee situation.
A second session of the conference
was arranged for Tuesday when the
commission and the governor will re
turn to Tucson and discuss further
questions for the development of the
university during the coming semester.
; Departure of Train
, Is Kept a Secret.
In order to keep the departure
secret as long as possible, the
train was keut on a side-track to
wlch Nicholas land his party went.
Many rumors are current in re
gard to the motives for the re
moval of the imperial family and
to its destination. The semi-of-fical
news agency Bays the de
mands for Nicholas' transfer were
due to fears of the authorities that
attempts would be made to liber
ate the emperor with a counter
revolutionary movement.
A prevalent theory is that the
discovery of a letter in w'hich Gen
eral Gurko, former commander of
the southwestern front expressed
loyalty to the former emperor and
of plots to effect the escape of
Nicholas caused the council of
deputies to demand his removal to
a safer place, either to Tobolsk,
Siberia, or Kostroma, which was
the oringinal seat o fthe Roman
off family. M. Nekrasoff said,
however, that all stories that the
removal was connected with the
Gurko affair or with attempts to
liberate Nicholas were untrue, the
transfer having been decided up
on last month.
Says Government Not
Compelled to Act.' '
"Our motives were political and
military," he continued. "We de
cided to get Nicholas out of the
way before circumstances might
arise which would make this dif
ficult It is absolutely untrue
that the council of deputies ca re
pelled the government to act. We
shall announce the facts as soon
as Nicholas has reached his des
tination.'. IN NORTHWEST-
STRIKE AUGUST 20
the crops of the northwest territory
shall be left unharvested."
Portland and Klamath Falls, Ore.;
North Yakima, Wenatchee and Elms
burg, Wash., and Moscow, Idaho, are
among the cities where Industrial
Workers of the World are being mls
treated according to tbe statement.
Rowan said that a rough estimate
of the number of workers who will
obey the strike call is 55,000. He
said the number of members and
sympathizers in the four states varies
according to the construction work in
progress and the amount of work
available for the agricultural mem
bers. become serious but when the banner
that caused it had been torn to frag
ments, the participants seemed satis
fied. One woman who carried a banner
lost most of her clothes and she had
to wrap herself in the banner itself
before she started through the crowd
for suffragist headquarters. Another
delighted the spectators by calmly
reaching down into a white stocking,
pulling out a banner and unfurled It.
' Officers of the woninas' party said
tonight one of the banners addressed
"Kaiser Wilson" and forty-nine others
had been destroyed during tbe day.
Secretary Daniels issued a state
ment warning persons connected with
the navy not to take part in demon
strations against the women.

PACIFISTS TO

Senate Leaders Making Plans
for Executive Sessions in
Discussions of Proposals
Submitted by Pope.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
. ........--r,-..' . ......... . tf "1
' ference among entente diplo
mats today crystaiized into the
diet's peace move is not likely to
change In any substantial degree the
attitude either of the allies or the
American government.
It is agreed, however, that there
must ba a response to the Pope's pro
posal far more comprehensive than a
mere acknowledgement. To do this
without opening the field to argument
which might result' in a division of
friendship between the allies, to be
seized upon by the Germans is re
solved to be a delicate undertaking.
On the other hand some considera
tion is being given 'to the suggestion
that the pontiff has given President
Wilson a golden opportunity to again
Impress upon the American people and
world in the most convincing fashion
the rectitude of his position in recom
mending to congress tbe declaration
of a state of war with Germany.
Lansing Is Silent.
Secretary Lansing is reserving any
expression of opinion until he has thei
official text of the pope's message. Ex
perience has taught him that' often
traps are concealed in diplomatic com
munications that are not visible in any
abstract. While there is no disposi
tion to question the good faith of the
pope it is conservative that he might
have been irapossed upon by German
cunning, assuming that be has been in
duced to take tals-step through the.
pleas of strong Catholic elements in
Austria and Bavaria. The official text
had not reached Washington tonight.
Mr. Lansing talked during the day
separately with Ambassador Jusser
and of France and Colville Barclay,
charge of the British embassy.
These talks may be regarded as pre
liminary to the mere formal exchang
es expected to take place before ans
wers are returned to the Vatican and
it Is understood they are designed to
place the foreign offices in London and
Paris in possession of the views of
Secretary Lansing as a basis for their
own actions.
Ambassador Rlano of Spain also
talked with the secretary, who after
ward indicated that he thought the
pope's message might reach him
through that channel. .
To Squelch Pacifists.
In anticipation of an outburst of
peace talk at the capitol, plans were
made during the day by senate lead
ers, both democratic and republican,
to prevent open discussion of the sub
ject in the senate. They propose to
force executive sessions and close the
doors upon the beginning by any sen
ator of an address bearing on peace
negotiations' or tbe general subject
of peace.
Senators of the small so-called paci
ficist group are expected to oppose
the secret session program. The lead
ers, however, are prepared to base
their action upon the ground that such
discussion would relate to treaties In
cluding a possible peace treaty and
therefore, as is usual in all such mat
ters .should be carried on behind
closed doors.
If adhered to, the secret session
plan would materially affect speeches
planned by Senator Stone, chairman
of the foreign- relations committee,
Senator LaFollette and others on the
Wisconsin senators resolutions propos-

W W Conspiracy
To Attack Bisbee
Told by Mexicans
(By Review Leased Wire.)
EL PASO, Texas, Aug. 15. Au
thorities here and at Colum
bus. N. M., are investigating
reports brought to them by
Mexicans in the detention camp
at Columbus that the foreign ele
ment among the deportees from
Bisbee, Ariz., had been attempt
ing to organize a mutiny among
the 1000 men in the camp. The
purpose of this alleged plot was
said to have been to seize the
arms of the army garrison at Co
lumbus and start a movement on
Bisbee which was to have bten
augmented by others who had .
bjeen deported from Bisbee since
July 12 as well as I. W. W. fol
lowers from 'Globe, Miami, Jerome
and 'other mining camps.
As soon as the matter was re
; ported to the authorities at Co
lumbus the guards were doubled
and every precaution taken to pre
vent an outbreak. The leaders
were said by the Mexicans to
have been the Germans and Aus
trian s among the men deported
from Bisbee. The Mexicans claim-
ed to have refrained from taking
part in the alleged plot and l'o
have arranged to cross to Palo
mas. Chihuahua, opposite Colum
bus, should any trouble occur.
, Army and civil officers are in
clined . to doubt the report, al
though admitting that it was giv
en to them by the leaders tof the
Mexicans in the camp.
I. W. W. organizers were locat
ed in Juarez, opposite here, today,
where they were making an effort
to organize Mexican laborers em
ployed in various industries in El
Paso.
Officers to whom the alleged plot
was reported by the Mexican lead

to be published in connection with
the story for military reasons.
ROOT AND TEDDY
Roosevelt DeclaresThat
"Wobblies" and Like Or
ganizations Are "Criminals
Aiding German Propagan
da." (By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, Aug. 15. Expressing
confidence in the soundness of tbe
character of the Russian people for
self government, Elihu Root, head of
the special diplomatic mission to Rus
sia in two addresses here today at this
city's official reception to the mission,
denounced the radicals and Socialists
for their treason in Russia during the
recent time of peril "by men corres
ponding to the 1. W .W. here, the ex
treme Socialists and anarchists with
whom the German agents made com
mon cause."
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt, who
also spvke at tbe meeting at the Cham
ber of Commerce, likewise declared
"that organizations like the I. W. W.
are criminals aiding German propa
ganda in this country," adding: ""Let
us make those who oppose obstacles to
the success of the war feel that tney
are unhung traitors." He further asid
that "until the United States has plac
ed 5,000,00.0 men tin the fighting line
we have no right to consider ourselves
as standing level with Canada In this
fight for democracy," and advocated
the putting of American soldiers "in
masses on whichever front they are
most needed."
Root la Honored
At the ceremonies In city ball, Ma
yor Mitchell presented to Mr. Root, as
its first recipient, th medal of the
American Arts club, awarded for dis
tinguished valor in tbe service of the
United States."
When the Russian emperor was ov
erthrown Mr. Root said. In describing
at city hall conditions as ha found
them in Russia, the Russians had no
institutions of national self govern
ment and were bewildered, all Instru
ments of authority having been swept
away.
"Then acme the propaganda of var
ious groups, tone corresponding to the
I .W. W., he said. "They swarmed
back to Russia from the United States,
villifylng the land that had given them
refuge, declaring that the government
in America was as tyrannous as that
of Russia under the czar.
"Into this confusion was thrust a
great German propaganda that spent
money like water, using millions upon
millions t'o bribe the people and to buy
newspapers."

preparation for a supreme effort to place this center of the coal
fields' of the Pas de Callais in their possession. Hill 70, just
east of Loos and north of Lens, was the great stumbling
block.
Early Wednesday the Canadians stormed the hill. The
splendid effort was successful and within a few hours the im
portant position was cleared of Germans. The Canadians
swept on toward Lens from the northwest, capturing several
trenches and entering the western part of the city. The Ger
mans tried desperately to check the Canadian advance but five
counter-attacks were iri vain. ' While suffering only slight cas

Germans and captured almost 300 prisoners.

LEAGUE PERFECTED
AT TUESDAY MEET
Bisbee Delegation Goes to
Smelter City and Attends
Big Meeting Douglas In
vited to Visit Bisbee Sunday
Evening.
Organization of the Douglas branch
of the Loyalty League of America was
completed Tuesday night at a well at
tended meeting in the reading room of
the Y. M. C. A., in the Smelter City,
when President Hinton named, the va
rious committees provided for by the
constitution adopted at the original
meeting in the high school building a
week ago.
After ; the committees were an
nounced President Hinton announced
that M. W. Merrill, of Bisbee, president
of the parent organization formed in
. Phoenix recently, was present and
called on him to address the leaguo.
Mr. Merrill responded and first con
gratulated Douglas on its promptness
in perfecting such a splendid organiza
tion for the purpose of assisting the
nation In this time of greatest need.
He recited about what has recently
happened in Bisbee and declared that
the net results had been to solidity
sentiment In the Warren ditsrict,
where there had been lethargy and
idleness in promoting the best condi
tions for many years. This sentiment
he declared had already rid the dis
trict of an unbearable condition. He
said by the organization of loyalty
leagues the false teachings of the soap
box orators who had told but one story
for years was to be combatted and met
by the business men, conservative
working men, the professional man
who desires to see industrial peace
prevail in the future. He declared that
the teachings of treason were to be
met with arguments in favor of loyalty
to the nation and every community
where attempts were made to create
such unbearable conditions that Bisbee
had allowed to be brought to the dis
trict. He declared that there was noj
thought of the league or its members;
to oppose legitimate organized labor,
J)ut that on the other hand it would
"be as helpful to the laboring man as
anv other class of citizens. The re
marks of Mr. Merrill were enthusiasti
cally applauded.
Charles McDonald, cashier of the
Citizens' Bank & Trust company, of
this city, and secretary of the Loyalty
League of America, was asked for a
speech, but he declared that speecli
making was not one of the duties ot
a secretary, but he proceeded to con
gratulate Douglas on forming a loyalty
league and expressed the wish that
every community in the entire coun
try would soon have one. He said one
of the objects of the league was to
bring capital and labor closer togeth
er and support all efforts made to
bring just treatment of both. He re
cited what he had heard an I. W. W.

That Represent Excellent Money's Worth
And the Best of New Styles and Fabrics
orator say in the park at Bisbee a few
days before the great drive. The wob
bly, he said, had asserted that the
mining companies received a profit of
$40. for every day's labor performed
and that the miner should and would
demand a six-hour day and $20 pay
for it, and when they got that they
would demand that the working day
be cut to four hours. Besides the pub
lic expressions, like this, the L W. W.
crowd had visited the homes of work
ing men and threatened to dynamite
their bouses if they did not join the
strikers.
S. P. Applewhite, when called, ex
cused himself by saying that public
speaking was not in his line, but that
he approved all that had been said in
support of the loyalty league which
he assisted in starting at Phoenix.
Judge Sames was then asked to ad
dress the meeting and he did so in his
usual forceful and earnest manner.
He said that this was his first attend
ance of the league, but that he en
dorsed its purposes. He said the time
and justification was at hand -now for
an organization of the character of the
league. Every other consideration
must be set aside now and give way
to the unalloyed support of the gov
ernment. He doubted if there was
full realization of the enormity of the
task which this government has justly
assumed in this war, and declared that
the time had arrived when an align
ment must be assumed by all. Any
man who fails or refuses to aid the
government is unworthy the name of
American. This is a time for organis
ing industries as well as organizing
armies, as it was as necessary to keep
the industries going as to provide men
in the trenches. Any effort to handi
cap, or hinder these industries is trea
son, .
Dr. N. C. Bledsoe, of the Bisbee dele
gation, was next called. He said. In
reference to the recent incident in Bis
bee that occasions and conditions
sometimes are encountered which can
not be efficiently handled in a perfect
ly legal manner. The necessity for
loyalty is often overlooked until some
such condition arises and is handled
in a community. Results in Bisbee
have been good and now the people
are alive and solidified in the deter
mination to keep the district clear of
sedition in the future. Our best citi-
zenship has been welded in an eort!arrested here today In connection with
to put forth every effort in aid of the
government and to suppress treason
and sedition. He referred to a speech
made by Governor Campbell during his
recent visit there in which the execu
tive said that he was charmed with
the American spirit which he had en-
countered in Cochise county and Bis-',,, here from N0gaes. when the
bee, declaring that events were some-i men were arrested they told the "offi
times necessary to bring people to- cerg oI tne discovery by Mexican offi
gether. Dr. Bledsoe declared that ciajg 0l tne deficit in the custom
without loyalty there could be no sue- j noU8e funds and said they fled for fear
cess in any walk of life; loyalty is they would be executed on suspicion
necessary in business, in home build-' jhat they were involved in the short
ing and protecting, in war and inage
peace. He said that business men,. According to the driver of the auto
capitalists and wage earners and pro- m,bile a third man left Nogales by an
fessional men are all laborers and the ( other route carrying with him part of
labor of one is as necessary to the wel- the $60,000 alleged to have been stolen
fare of a community as the other. j from the custom house funds.
Strong, eloquent and patriotic1
speeches were made by Judge Doan
and J. P. Boyle, in which they urged ;
that this was time for organization fori
aiding this country in the great strug-
gle in which it was engaged.

Developments at the Middlemarch
Copper company's property, located
nine miles from Pearce, indicate an
enlarged production from the mine
and also in the recently installed mill,
according to Ed Massey, assistant
mine inspector, who has just returned
to his headquarters in Bisbee after a
trip through the northern part of the
county.
Three per cent ore is being, mined
by the Middelmarch. The ore is be
ing taken from the tunnel level of the
property and the development work
consists of the nnwatering of a wine
off this level. When this is completed
the company expects to sink the winze
further and anticipates the uncovering
of a still larger and higher grade body
of ore.
The 100-ton mill is running nearly
at capacity. It is a modified flrtat!cn
plant, capable of concentrating to
about a ratio of eight to one. The
first run extracted 94 per cent of the
metallic content. When the mill gets
into good running shape and fully lim
bered up the company expects to run
140 tons of ore per day through it.

! ASSESSMENT WORK
! ON MINING CLAIMS
1 MAY BE SUSPENDED
In a Utter received by the Daily ll
view yesterday from Congressman Carl
i Hayden, of Arizona, attention is called
; to Senate Joint Resolution No. "S,
i which passed the senate on July 9 and
, has been favorably reported, with
j amendments to the house. The reso
lution would suspend the annual as
sessment work on mining claims dur
j ing the year 1917 upon the condition
I that each locator shall file a notica
I with the county recorder asking for
! the benefits of the new ac t.
"The report of the committee show3
' that the secretary of the interior is
opposed to a general suspension of as
sessment work during the war," wrote
Mr. Hayden, "although he has finally
concluded to approve an exemption tor
the present year. The members of
congress from the eastern states are
usually inclined to follow the recom
mendations of the secretary but with
out his whole-hearted support it wi,l
be difficult to pass the bill.
There is a general understanding
that nothing but emergency, legisla
tion which is absolutely essential to
the conduct of the war with Germany
shall be considered at this time, so
that there Is much uncertainty about
obtaining a vote on this bill. If the
resolution is to be parsed at all it
should become a law before the first
of October, and I believe that the own
ers of mining claims will be safe in
waiting to commence their assessment
work until that date, but no longer."
A joint resolution relieving soldiers
and sailors from doing assessment
work on mining claims which they may
own was passed July 17. Mr. Hayden
suggests that any men who have en
listed in the army or navy file the re
quired notice before being ordered
away, in order to protect their claim1?.

FERGUSON TO BEGIN
. HIS DEFENSE TODAY
(By Keyiew Leased Wlrei
AUSTIN, Texas, August 15. Gover
nor James E. Ferguson tomorrow wiil
begin his defense to the oiarges
brought against him by Speaker F. O.
Fuller looking toward Impeachment
The taking of testimony against the
governor ended shortly before noon to
day and the house committee of the
whole which is hearing the charges
then reported, back to the house until
morning. Tonight it was not expected
that the governor would be the first
witness in his own behalf. W. A. Han
gar, his counsel, has not indicated,
however, who will furnish the initial
defense testimony.
Indications are that the session will
continue well into next week.
The last witness called before the
house's counsel rested was Adjutant
General Henry Hutchings, who has
just been nominated to be a brigadier
general in the army. He testified that
a "body-guard" detailed from the Tex
as Rangers to protect the governor
was essential In his opinion because
of threatening letters received by Ferguson.

OUR DEBT TO FRANCE
Our debt to France Is not entirely one of sentiment.
as many people seem to think. It is much more solid
than that. Her alliance with America in the war of the
revolution cost France 35,000 men and twenty-fire ships
of the line, according to authorities on the history of
that struggle. French men and women gave hundreds
of thousands of dollars to this struggling republic in
the dark days of its infancy, and a dollar then would go
as far as five now, and dollars were much more scarce
and harder to raise. The Duchess of Orleans alone gave
$45,000 to Paul Jones and thus enabled him to fit out
the Bon Homme Richard and win the, greatest naval bat
tle in the history of this republic.
LaFayette and other young noblemen not only came
over here and fought for us, they expended fortunes for
equipment and weapons for our armies.
Our debt to France is solid and real as well as one
of sentiment The French government's loan of millions
was a business proposition, withal it was a most risky
one then, and the money was paid back. But the real,
actual, substantial aid given by France to a republican
government that the rest of the world thought was but
a fleeting shadow of reality, was absolutely necessary to
save that government from destruction.
French lives by the thousand, and French money by
the million were thrown into the scale, without security
of any kind except that guaranteed by the goddess ot
chance, with the well known French gallantry and reck
lessness of consequences when her sentiment is enlisted
in a cause.
And today France reels back before the menace of a
monster that has arisen to threaten the world. And to
day the republic of the west comes forward to pay the
debt of one hundred and fifty years ago. American lives
and treasure are to be expended in France. But ma';e
no mistake. Our debt is a real one. French lives and
treasure were spent here when we needed them even
worse than France needs us today.
And now they call Hearst's New York American the
"anti-American.' Not a bad name, considering its pacifist
propaganda. One alleged American newspaper, preach
ing an impossible peace with a frightful foe, at this time,
does more harm than two or three German-American
papers printed in the German tongue. They are knov.-n
as enemies. But the Hearst papers, under the insidious
mask of an impossible peace, stab from behind.
"Bisbee Defies the Nation," reads a headline in
the esteemed and conservative Kansas City Star of recent
date. Far be it from this mild, modest, meek little com
munity to do anything like that. The first Wiley Jonea
statement sent out of here in haste by some one was re
sponsible for the Star's lurid headline. Later the attor
ney general denied and revoked his alleged statement.
- Now let the Star withdraw Bisbee from the stark heights
of rebellion to which it has been lifted by that paper's
bead line writer.
Douglas and Bisbee are getting chummier every day.
That welcome given our delegation at the meeting of the
Protective League in the smelter city Tuesday night
warms the cockles of the Bisbee heart. Usually where
two cities the size of Douglas and Bisbee are located i'J
the same county there is intense rivalry between them,
often attended by bad feelings. But it is hard to en
gender, and harder still to keep alive, little and petty and
narrow feelings in the hearts of a people who live where
the mountain ranges look down with big and placid
serenity upon the wide reaches of the plains.
Slackers, attention! Percy Grainger, the famous
musician, was receiving $1,200 per concert recital, a few
weeks ago, or pay for his time and effort at the rate ot
fifteen dollars a minute. He Is playing an oboe in a
regimental band for Uncle gam now and is drawing
down thirty dollars a month. And he did not wait tor
the draft, either. Nor did he seek or desire exemption.
He beard that musicians were scarce in the army, snd
that they were badly needed, and so he enlisted. He
says he is a happier, prouder man today than ever he
was when an audience went wild over hiB oerformance
upon the platform.
FOLLY OF BAD ROADS
(Douglas International)
While the nation is undergoing a general overhaul
lng of its economic methods, eliminating waste and in
creasing efficiency, under the grim stimulus of war, let
us not lose sight of the folly of bad roads.
The United States department of agriculture est!
mates that the farmers of this country are annually losing
$250,000,000 on account of their inability to market their
produce at certain times of the year, due to bad road
conditions. And this despite the great Improvement
brought about by the dragging and working of dirt roads
in the last few years.
The fact is, we have about got to the end of the dirt
road era. That they are capable of a certain amount of
improvement, and that this improvement should be made,
in the absence of more permanent methods, goes without
saying. But in a state where weather conditions make it
impossible to maintain dirt roads in good condition for
more than six months of the year, the time has come
for permanent, hard-surfaced roads. This is our goal
and it should not be lost sight of.
If it be waste and folly to "maintain" bad roads at
any time, it is criminal waste and folly to tolerate them
in times when the nation Is at war, with the world looking
to America to be fed and the high prices obtainable for
all kinds of agricultural products place a premium upon
everything the farmer has to sell. But he must have
good roads, available at all seasons of the year, to realize
in full his share of the profit. '
A CALAMITY HOWLER
A certain magazine writer gets all wrought up about
the U-boat menace and predicts dark disaster for all of
us as follows:
"Unless some effective means shall be de
vised within the next six months, then will come
the'life-and-death struggle of the war, becauseJf
the allies cannot get food, munitions and supplies
from America, the allies in Europe will face star
vation; and Germany will have won."
Buifthis most learned strategist and gloomy pessi
mist neglects to state who is going to feed Germany pll
this time. If the German soil and climate can nourish
and inspire ber armies in the field for this great effort,
why cannot the soil and climate of sunny France and the
grand little British isles do the same for their armies?
By the time Germany has starved France via the U-boat
method she will herself have come to know well the
pangs of hunger. All of which, however, should not pre
vent us from exhausting every effort to throttle the sub
marine and send France and England plenty of food, not
so much to save them from starvation, as to enable them
to prosecute a vigorous and successful offensive against
the already half-nourished Teuton.
While the Review realizes that this country has a
tremendous task on its hands, and one not taken seri
ously enough, probably, by the, country at large, for our
defeat would be attended by terrible consequences, and
the war is not won by any manner of means, yet we refuse
to get all "net up" over the wail of every calamity howler
that happens along.
Thp Canadian wolf trap now holds Lens in its jaws.
Dr. Von Klienschmidt, president of the University
of Arizona, divided honors, one day this week, with Mary
Pickford, the movie queen, in a little ceremony at Re
dondo Beach. No, this distinguished educator is not out
on the coast having a good time. The occasion referred
to was the great civic function when the city receiveC
the keys from Neptune for the new four million dollar
harbor site, and it was as dignified as it was imposing.
Mexico is now in a situation that is known and ap
preciated by newspaper men better than any one else
she don't know where her next dollar is coming from.
She is broke. Dead broke! Its congress has authorized
President Carranza to borrow some 150 thousand pesos,
but it did not specify from whom or how he was to turn
this little financial transaction. If he gets the money
he can qualify as the greatest financial wizard since the
day of the man who started the Louisiana Lottery.
The way of the slacker is going to be harder than
the scriptures prophecy for the way of the transgressor.
Already the Cochise officials are combing the county Tor
some four hundred and fifty of them that failed to report
out of the first call at Tombstone for examination. There
is a reward out for them, just as is the case of an outlaw,
or of a bounty for a wolf pelt. Any person giving infor
mation leading to the arrest of a slacker receives a re
ward of fifty dollars from the government. And it is the
duty of every person to give this information. If you
aid or encourage or conceal or withhold information
about one of these gentry, you yourself are liable to a jail
sentence and a fine.
Under the food cor.trol bill, recently passed by a
most dilatory congress, til persons who hold more wheat
and flour than required for their normal business will
be vigorously prosecuted. Now the Armours and Leiters
and other Chicago grain speculators eaoh require. In
their business, about, say, ten pounds of flour a day for
their household needs, and no wheat at all. They have
been holding a million bushels of wheat at a time Tor
speculative purposes. The bill hits these food specula
tors the hardest blow of all, and the average man an I
woman of this country will shout with glee at the impact
of the blow. The Chicago board of trade will close Sep
tember 1. Hasten the day, and more power to it when
It conies. It has created more fictitious prices on food
necessities than any other dozen agencies in the wile
world.

$20,000 IN LIQUOR IS
EMPTIED INTO SEWER
A quantity of whisky that would
have brought more than $20,000 at the
prevailing bootleg price of $3 a pint
was emptied out in he yard of the
courthouse at Tucson recently by
county officials. The stuff represent
ed the collections made by the sheriff's
office of Pima county in the past tnt)
months. All the cases to which the
stuff bad been held for evidence have
been disposed of in the courts and the
"firewater" was accordingly ordered
destroyed.
A- large crowd gathered as soon as
the ceremony started. News of the
event traveled with the swiftness of
the rumor of a bank failure, or the
whisper of fire in a crowded theatre. A
sniffing circle of curious ones was
formed around the officers squatting
on the ground opening the bottles and
the witticisms to be expected on such
an occasion were npt left unsaid.
A large funnel was placed in a drain
pipe near the west entrance of the
court house. With the aid of several
deputies. Under Sheriff Sullinger car
ried sack after sack of the confiscated
bottles out of the county "booze
room," while County Attorney Kirkej
McAre, with several . assistants, un
wrapped the flasks and loosened the
corks. Sheriff Rye Miles was grand
high priest at the libatory ceremonies
and with an impartial air he saw that
the contents of every bottle went
gurgling down Into the sewer.
A rich, pungent odor, strong enough
to make the pbet Omar turn over m
his grave, arose from the scene and
attracted the attention of passersby.
Men could be seen coming from every
direction and those who were already
on hand pushed and shoved to hold
their places In the front rank of spectators.

Miss Margaret Oiiperfield.
Miss Margaret Chiperfield, daugh

Illinois, is one of the most popular
members of Washington's , younger
set. She is actively interested in
many war charities, as are most of
the other members of her circle in

LONDON TURNS OUT TO
CHEER jlS SOLDIERS
(Continued From Page One)
A picturesque feature of the visit
of the Americans was the noon lunch
eon served In Green Park, which Is
the center of the fashionable section
overlooked by Buckingham Palace on
one side and the Picadilly Clubs and
ducal residences on the other side.
Hundreds of tables with white cloths
were spread and hundreds of wait
resses attended the soldiers, whose
arms were stacked about the tables.
Whenever English girls could get near
enough to the soldiers they pleaded
for buttons or regimental badges as
souvenirs. They got many of them.
Just before the Americans left Lon
don taxlcabs filled with old men fell in
behind the procession. The bore big
banners Inscribed: "London Division
U. S. Civil War Veterans." The vet
erans stood up in the cabs and cheer
ed, the hindmost troops responding.
. CONSOLATION
When one Is filled with ills and
groans, when one has cares and ach
ing bones, when every scene presents
to view but woes and bills far overdue.
In short when all the world's a place
of fretfulness and sorry case, then
what a solace one can find if he will
only call to min dthe words that some
one used to say, "This too will only
pass away!" They seem to have the
proper ring, a heap of cVmifort they
can bring and when the day is drab
and drear they somehow seem to
please the ear; when in a wretched
circumstance they may not make you
sing and dance, they may not fill you
full of glee and make you joyful as
can be. they may not do such things
as these, but they: will seldom fail to
please. So when y'JU have no shirts
to wear or when you're losing all your
hair or when you're filled with aches
and moans or when you can't collect
from Jones, when,you are weak with
toothache's ills and when u cannot
meet your bills, when all the weary
world's askew and you, In sort, are
really blue, here Is the itttle piece
to say: "This too will only pass away."
BIG PEACH CROP
IN THE YUMA VALLEY.
The peach crop In Yuma valley this
year is really marvelous, both as to
yield and the luciousness and size of
the fruit Every peach tree was so
loaded with fruit it could scarcely
stand alone, and peaches weighing as
much as one-half pound each were not
uncommon. When this fruit was plac
ed beside peaches shipped' into the
Yuma market there was no compari
son.
Approximately $1,000 a day is what
the strike at the Inspiration Consoli
dated Copper Company at Miami is
costing the farmers of the Salt River
valley. Not ony is the Reclamation
Service losing this amount of revenue
during the time the mine is closed but
s also at the expense of paying the
men for the work on the power plnnt.
Men are eni ployed on a yearly contrai l
so the expenses are practically the
same.

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, August 15. Trading
in stocks today was sgain influenced
by the latest peace proposals. Deal
ings denoted greater conservatism by
operators for both accounts, the alter
nate declines and recoveries furnishing
tn indication of uncertainty in spec
ulative quarters.
Tnere was a diminution of activity
in stocks which derive their Bupport
from professional interests.
Shippings were the most prominent
shares, marine preferred 1 at its
best and the common 2Vi. Coppers,
sugars. Mexican Petroleum, Distillers"
and the fertilizers embraced the other
strong stocks.
1 United States steel was sluggish
most of the time but came forward. la
ter, closing at its top price oM244,
a net gain of points. Great North
ern ore featured the final dealings at
an extreme rise of 2. Rails were
barely steady.
Total sales. 750.000.
Bonds were easier, the Liberty is"
sue selling at 99.94 at 99.98.
Total sales, par value, $2,265,000.
United States bonds, old " issues,
were unchanged on call. The coupon
4's rose V of 1 per cent on call.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. August 15. Uncertainty
today over the new peace move and
in regard to food control developments
had a tendency to make grain quota
tions decline. Corn closed heavy
cents to 76 cents net lower at 115 to
115'4 for December and 112 for
May. Wheat finished four cents down
but steady at $2.00 for September.
The outcome in oats was unchanged
to 12 cents off. .
Provisions showed an advance of
12 cents at 15 to 30 cents .
Oats gave way with other sereals.
A contributing cause was an official
statement that according to the pres
ent prospect for this season Iowa
would yield, nearly 50,000,000 bushels
more than last .year.
Provisions jumped in response to a
record-breaking advance in the hog
market Packers were active buyers,
chiefly of ribs.

NEW YORK, August 15 The action
of the stock market In its., .dealings
was somewhat contrary to general ex
pectations although the stiffening In
pnefs was ut&L naciiutrj iu icaiitiiiA
by shorts who apparently were disap
pointed over the volume of liquidation
that evinced itself. A report In cer
tain circulation in substance intimat
ing that the United States government
has expressed a willingness to revise
terms of payment covering its copper
requirements and advance 22 cents
a pound to producers, the balance" of
21 a pound to be adjusted by the
federal trade commission, created th-s
belief in some quarters that inasmuch
as the government previously wanted
to set a price of 18 a pound on cop
per price fixing in other commodities
may not be quite as drastic. Of cource
fhis is only a supposition and until an
official verdict is rendered in respest
to price fixing, much uncertainty ana
spprehension over the same will con
tinue to prevail.
Peace talk was much discussed and
in some quarters it is thought that in
ternational political developments of
far reaching nature may be disclosed
in a short space of time. The fact
that so many peace rumors have been
. circulated recently makes the trade a
little wary of accepting and this pro
ably accounts for the indifference dis
played by many toward disclosures of
this kind.
However, we believe that we are in
a period of approaching one, where in
fluence, domestic and foreign are like
ly to bring about an important change
in security values with the selling
prices of many corporations which
have made large war profits.

THERE IS NO LAW
Compelling a man to save, and we doubt if any law
could make the thriftless provident.
In this matter of saving you must either take
the advice of those who know or learn by your owa
experience that it does not pay to live right up to
your income, spending every cent you earn, regard
less of that future which may not be such a time ol
prosperity ior you as the present is.

"I know of no greater instance in
the world of competency and construct-1
ive government than has been given
in Russia in the last three months,":
be said. "Russia has found .herself,
and In every field, military nad civil, ;
will give a good account of herself to
the democracy of the world, and we
need not blush for extending our
hands to her."
The mission has returned to Amer
ica, he continued, "to repeat fe mes
sage of faith in democracy here, for
here, as there, German propatrnnda is
seeking to sap the strength of this free
democracy. German money is buying
men, Inspiring the press and building
up a great concealed structure 'jf real
treason."
In his latter speech at the Chamber
of Commerce Mr. Root said that into
the confusion in Russia after the fall
of the emperor "came intervention by
that malevolent power which is inter-
medible with the affairs of every na-1
tfon upon earth, feeding and financing ,
all the forces of evil." j
In an address at the Union League
club tonight, where members of the
mission were given an Informal din
ner, Mr. Root declared there are "stil'
some Americans who do not quite un-1
derstand why we are fighting." j
"If they did," he said, "the pro Ger-;
man traitors wh'o are selling out our.
country, who are endeavoring by op
position and obstruction in congress,
and out of congres sto make our prep
aration for the war ineffective, would
be suppressed. I

Information to the eCoct that large
quantities of dynamite and blasting
powder were frequently left unguard
ed and in places where they could eas
ily be stolen, today resulted in the
state council of defense sending out
warnings that all siich explosive
hereafter must be carefully guarded
According to information reaching the
state defense body many tons of ex
plosives could easily be secured b
enemv nlotters because of the failurr
of mining companies, ranchers an I
Others to keep careful check upon
them. Each county council of defence-
is asked to co-operate in seeing that
the explosives are carefully guarded.
That the warning is merely to sale
guard against the theft and use of
such explosives by enemy plotters ami
that no reports of dynamite navin:
