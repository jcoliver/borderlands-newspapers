German Submarines Quick To
Disappear Beneath Waves
When American Fleet Ap

(Bv Review Leased Wire).
THE BRITISH PORT BASE
OF THE AMERICAN
FLOTILLA, via London,
June 6. (4:00 p. m.) The!
American destroyers have
completed their month of ac
tive service in the war. They
have been favored with excel
lent weather which is a big
factor in anti-submarine war
fare. Most of the time theyj
have had sunny skies andi
smooth seas, with just enough
squall and storm to put their
seamanship to test. The fav
orable weather conditions
make their task of learning the
the technique of anti-submarine
warfare much simpler and
easier."
The American boats are , assigned
to work hand in hand with the British
squadrons, being virtually assimilated
into the British naval ministry here.
A. destroyer is usually out from four
to five days and then returns to port
for two or three days while coaling
and loading supplies. Thus every
American sailor pets at least half a
day leave practically every week.
The Americans take thei rturn
with the British boats in all routine
work of patrol and convoy. The work
nlthnuffh largely routine, is interest
ing and the Americans have never,
yet found time hanging neavuy ou
their hands. The lookout must be
constant and eyes must be trained to
an unbelievable degree of keenness.
The young Americans take zealously
to this business of finding the perl
6copic needle in the nautical haytack

warnings sent broacast show that the
American boats are already making

British boats, with which they are

Submarines Are Wary.
There has been no actual battle as
yet between an American destroyer
and the enemy, although several re
ports show that U-boats have been
sighted and have been compelled to
beat a hasty retreat to the depths of
the sea.
An assignment to convoy a liner
"from home." that is, an American

Liberty Loan Facts
DO WE LOVE OUR
COUNTRY?
During this war. Great Britain has already created two large loans
of five billion dollars each, and, for the last one, subscriptions were
received from about eight million different buyers.
The French people are known as the gratest government bond
buyers in the world.
Fifty years ago we raised over three billion dollars to provide for
the expenses of the Civil War.
The wealth of this country today is eight times as great as it was
then; our banking resources are twenty times as great an then or
even as late as 1S70. ,
Soon after the beginning fo the Spanish-American War. our gov
ernment offered for sale 200 million dollars 3 per cent bonds, whicl:
were oversubscribed seven and a half times. This was equivalent to
subscriptions totaling about $1,400,000,000.
Can it behat we love and appreciate our country to a less degree
than England or France? It is conceivable that we have lost our
enthusiasm for our government's ideals since 1S64, or even since
1S98?
It is estimated by the Comptroller of the Currency that there arc
now more than ten million individuals and corporations in the United
States in a position to subscribe from $100 to $100,000,000 cash to the
new Liberty Loan.

Vessel Also Repels Attack.
Germany's air raid Tuesday over
eastern England was a costly one. Of
18 aircraft which participated in the
bomb dropping excursion only 10 of
I them got away.
From the outset of their journey
from Belgium across the British chan
nel, over England and throughout the
trip, the Germans were engaged at all
times by British aviators. Two ma

planes were given battle high over the
water by ten British naval airmen, who
destroyed two more and sent them
hurtling down into the sea. Likewise
submarines have met with hard usage
at the hands of American and French
armed merchantmen.
Submarine Sunk.
One of the underwater boats Is re
ported to have been sunk by guns on
an American steamer operated by
American naval gunners after a Pong
duel, in which the submarine fired 35
shots and the American vessel 25. The
last shot of the American crew is be
lieved to have reached its mark, as the
submarine rose out of the water and
then disappeared.
The French steamer Orenoque also
gave battle to a German submarine,
which was trying to approach her in a
heavy sea. Four shots from the steam
er sent the U-boat scurrying beneath
the waves.
British Take Trenches.
From the North sea to the Franco
Belgian frontier the entente allies and
the Germans are engaged in artillery
duels, which are especially violent
around Dixmude and between Steen
straete and Het-S-is and in the region
of Wytschaete, south of Ypres. On the
north bank of the Scarpe river, to the
east of Arras, the British have cap
tured German trenches over a front of
about a mile and made 162 prisoners.
The Germans are heavily attacking
the French troops between Soissons
and Rheims, but except ton one sector
they have been everywhere repulsed
with heavy casualties.
North of the Chemin-des-Dames
some French elements were captured
by the Germans.
Lively Air Fighting.
Again there has been lively fighting
in the air between the British and
Germans, in -which eight enemy air
machines were shot down and eight
others driven down out of control. The
British lost seven machines.
In the Anstro-Italian theater the Ital

The mighty roll of hon
i or of American man-
i hood had beeun to reach
Washington tonight from the
states that had completed their
count of the men of military
age registered yesterday. At
a late hour only a few complete
I returns had been received but
preliminary unofficial report
i were sufficient to show that
j millions of men await the call
j to arms.
The official figures were Voo scant
for an accurate estimate of the total
of the men who have registered. The
first reports showed that the census
bureau estimates cf eligibles had not
been equalled, but officials pointed out
that the numbers by which one or two
cities alone had exceeded the esti
mates would wipe out the entire defi
ciency of several s.ualler state send

In some of these cities registration
still was In progress today, the attor

registration machinery proved other

Until the records of the great man

said tonight that it was not to bo ex

would check with the census ligure-s.
on account of the fact that men in

questions still pending were deferred
today, details and minor tax rates
alone occupying the day's sessions.
Rates on incomes and excess profits
', are to be left to the last. Any rev
enue needed to make a totl levy of
$1,500,000,000 probably will be secured
by the income or excess profits taxes.
As to the tax upon publishers, which
, may be settled at tomorrow's session
! committee sentiment apparently fa-
! vors adhering to the tentative decision
i'jr a 2 per cent advertising lery and
against increasing postage rates.
Among minor questions agreed upon
today was a tax aimed at theater tick
et scalpers, imposing a 50 percent tax
upon profits on tickets sold at news
stands, hotels, or other places.
Exemption of bona fide Chautauquas
and lycoums fi'jm the amusement ad
mibsion taxes, when operated by local
concerns, was agreed to. The commit
tee, in addition, amended the exemp
tion from admission taxes provided for
agricultural fairs to includo all re
ceipts. Officers of the American Sugar Re
fining company protested t'oday
against tne committee's announced
plan to repeal the present law allow
ing re-exported "drawback" allowances
on sugar imported, refined and then
exported, which aggregates $19,0H),000
annually. Senator SimnAms said later
the question would be subject to
change.

OHIO'S REGISTRATION
CLOSE TO 550,000
(By Review Leased Wire).
COLUMBUS. O.. June 6. Ohio's reg

i 550.0Mi, according to incomplete re
turns tonight.

SELECTION OF MEN.
FOR ARMY SERVICE
WILL START SOON
(Continued From Page One)
and classified. Those who are wholly
unfitted physically for a soldier's rira
business must be eliminated; the
quotas of the states must be assigned;
the machinery for distributing th!3
quota equally through every remote
county or precinct of each state must
be perfected.
Jury Wheel Probable.
The local exemption boards will al
most equal in number the registration
precincts. Assurance has been given
that a man's own neighbors will be
the judges to pass upon nis case.
There were more than 125,000 pre
cincts and equality and centralization
will characterize the exemption
boards.
There' is no statement yet available
as to the process by which men will
be drawn to appear before the exemp
tion boards. Secretary Baker has
stated that sjmething in tie mlure
of a jury wheel might be employed but
beyond that no information ha been
given out
Reports from all parts of the coun
try bore out the indications of last
knight, that the great enterprise h id
been carried through without objec
tion or 'opposition trom a sufficient
number of citizens to be worthy of
mention. Registration was completed
virtually without disorder; certainly
with only a small part of the disturb
anaces that usually characterize na
tional elections.
What Will Follow.
General Cr,wder tonight outlined
what is to follow the great enactment:
"Registration marks the completion
of the first well defined step in the
execution of the selective service
law," he said. "The actual recording
nas been practically finished in a sin
gle day, but the arrangement and
copying of the cards, their segregation
into appropriate groups, the appoint
ments of lists, and the garnering in ol
delayed registrations will consume a
week or ten days. In the meantime
the machinery of the registration is
being readjusted to serve -as machin
ery for the further action of the law.
This work is proceeding rapidly and
should be completed cfcincidentally
witn the tying up of the loose ends 'of
registration.
"When this is all done, registration
regulations governing the jurisdiction
of the local boards v ill be issued and
the machine will be ready to proceed
to the drawing, which will result in a
determination of the order in which
registered men will be examiued for
the purpose )f their selection for mili
tary or industrial service. - When tflis
list of order i.s determined, it i' ex-,
peeled that the war department will
be able to make a delinite call for men
and as soon as this data is available
the quotas neecssary to fill the first
call will be assigned to the several
states.
No Dates Set Vet.
"Precise time limits cannot be set
at present for the reason that it is de
sired to have uniformity of operation
of the maeb'nes throughout the Unit
ed States and to nave each step taken
simultaneously throughout the nation.
The mountainous, heavily-wooded and
sparsely settled, states cannot move
with the expedition of compact and
densely populated states. While dates
are not to be named precisely, these
steps will follow each other pi'jmptly
with a fixed purpose of giving as much
time as possible to men wiio are se
lected to adjust their affairs, to make
their farewell. , and avoid the incon
venience and buffering that would re
sult from a hasty change from civil
to military status."

CHINESE REFUGEES
VOLUNTEER SERVICES
DENVER. Jirfie 6 Returns on reg
istration in the mountain states, came
in slowly today, not a single county
in Arizona or New Mexico having re
ported up to tonight, and but nine
teen in this state. No returns were
available at Cheyenne, Wyo., but It
was not known whether any had been
received, while in New Mexico the
total of the smallest county must wait
until the figures of precinct 40 and
41 of Miles county can be brought
through the mountains on horseback.
Much the same condition prevails in
Wyoming.
A number of Chinese who followed
J General Pershing's force from Mexi
, co and who registered yesterday were
cn their way tonight to San Antonio to
. serve in the quartermaster's depart
. ment, having offered themselves to
the coun'ry. Returns in Colorado, in
j eluding Denver, gave a total of 32,546.
Denver's share cf this was 18,109.
RED CROSS FUND IS
INCREASING RAPIDLY
William Delbridge. treasurer of the
local chapter of the Red Cross reports
a successful sale of memberships by
the ladies who were conducting the
sale on Registration Day. The pro
ceeds up to date amount to $1.21S.i".
No report has been turned into the
treasurer on the sale of tags, and the
proceeds of the recent Red Cross ben
efit which was held at the Orpheum
theatre have not been determined as
yet. The dance aa Warren Park on
the evening of June 4 netted $59.SO.
The people have been meeting with
hearty response, anything that has
been conducted for the benefit of the
Red Cross. A number of stunts are
contemplated ty the orgauiza ion for
the raising of funds and the officials
of tht? 'ccal chapter havo been grati
fied with past results.

Attorney General Gregory reiterated
tonight his gratification ver the ab
sence of any serious disordt rs yebtcr
day. A statement from the depart
ment of justice said:
"The fact that a man has registered
does not in any way curtail his free
dom of action. Until he is actually se
lected he is at liberty to go as he
pleases. Should he see fit to leave the
country, he may do so. but he must re

Hans Wagner Will
'Come Back' Today
(By Review Leased Wire)
PITTSBURGH, June 6. John Hen
ry (Hans) Wagner, shortstop, who
failed to report to the Pittsburgh Na
tionals at the beginning of the season,
after twenty years as a player in t!ie
National league, today signed a Con
tract with President Barney Dreyfuss,
of the Pittsburgh club. It was an
nounced that Wagner will appear at
first base in tomorrow's game with
Brooklyn.
No statement was made as to the
salary Wagner will receive under the
new contract. For the last two years
it is said he has been receiving $10,000,
and, according to seme reports, it whs
because of a reduction that the veteran
failed tv report this spring
After signing a contract. Wagner
sent the following telegram to August
Herrmann, chairman of the National
Baseball commission:
"Finally the call of baseball too
strong to resist. I desire to continue
to play the game I love and to which
I owe all I possess, and hereby petition
the national commission to grant my
request for reinstatement so that I
may play with my eld club tomorrow."

BERLIN. (Tuesday, via London,
June 6, 11:10 p. m.). Although Grge
Archibald, the American jockey, re
ceived a special permit to ride in the
Grand Prix, in Hamburg, on Sunday,
he did not mount Baron von Oppen

event. The Kleine Journal, of Berlin,
t'oday announces that the commander
of the Ninth Army corps, vetoed the
appearance of the American.
Archibald has been barred from rid

in relations. Dolman was a poor
fourth in the racei, which was won by

BUSINESS BOOMING.
The stock market is booming again. There is a tre
mendous volume of buying. Steel shares have hot up to
incredible heights. Industrial securities are most affect
ed, but the boom has extended to nearly every form of
investment, including railroad stocks. When our invet
erately pessimistic transportation interests start on the
upwardgrade, there can be no more doubt
"Business as1 usual!" has been a familiar slogan lately,
intended as a verbal stimulant to industry and trade.
But apparently no artificial stimulants are needed. From
the Judgment of the stock exchange, backed by the ver
dict of the country '8 leading financiers and captains of in
dustry, business is going to be better than usual.
The billions of dollars to be spent for war supplies for
ourselves and our allies have already made themselves
felt The nation is as busily at work as a hive of bees
or a colony of ants, and will remain so. There is no
prospect whatever of "dull times." Everything points to
a period of unparalleled activity and prosperity while
the war lasts. And afterward there will be such a vast
amount of reconstruction necessary in every belligerent
country, and such a demand on America for raw materials
and machinery, that according to expert views the boom
may extend for two or three years beyond the war.
LABOR TROUBLES.
Builders and other employers have been complaining
of late regarding the "independence and arrogance" of
skilled labor. They do not, as a rule, object particularly
to the high wage demanded. They regard that as a nec
essary evil of prosperous times. But they are indignant
at the indifferent attitude shown by many workmen to
ward employers who mean to deal fairly with them, and
who offer them profitable employment on urgent jobs.
In one day recently, in a city where this attitude has
been especially noticeable, contractors reported baring re
' ceived the following excuses from men who refused to
work:
"I've so many jobs open I can't decide which to take."
"1 don't want to go to work until I decide whether I
want to live here."
"I want pay in advance."
"I've got money left from my last job."
"I don't like to work in that part of town."
"I'm tired of inside work. I'm looking for something
good on the outside."
Nearly all these excuses are obviously frivolous. If
these were ordinary times, perhaps there would be no
great harm in laboring men indulging in such arrogance
at the expense of the employing class. Many of them
have, perhaps, been treated with contempt and discharged
from jobs on frivolous pretenses. But these are not or
dinary times.
Today the brain and skill and muscle of every man
able to do a day's work are needed as never before. The
laborer now is not working for any man or corporation
so much so he is working for his country. And the work
man who shirks a job when he is able to work is a
slacker just as surely as is the man who dodges military
duty.
QUELLING THE UNREST.
It was a timely warning sounded by U. S. Attorney
Anderson of Boston, in bis testimony before a congress
ional committee on the administration food control bill:
"Smething niui be done. That a social and political
upheaval is threatened cannot be denied or disregarded.
I see the signs of it. Anyone with his cars to the ground
know it. There will be phenomena in America incon
sistent with law and order unless something is done to
prevent H.' '
There's no denying that great popular discontent exists
as a result of high prices and a prevalent conviction that
they are unjustified. We want no bloody riots in our
gfties. And we need not have them, if congress does its
duty and the federal department of Justice backs it up.
We do not want a Prussian food dictatorship, regulat
ing every phase of production, distribution and consump
tion. But we need a considerable measure of federal
control, and the sooner we get it the better.
The more advice you give the more likely you are to
get in bad.
PUBLICITY FOR PERSHING'S MEN.
The war department ought to reconsider its decision
not to let any newspaper correspondents accompany Gen.
Pershing's army to France. And Gen. Pershing himself,
If he is responsible for the decision as he is said to be,
ought to reconsider it
No strategic secrets need be revealed in news dis
patches. The army censors ought to be able to take:
care of that And so far as the commander is concerned.
he could well afford, for the sake of the big interests in-,
i
volved, to give a little of his time every day to com
municating, through accredited and trustworthy writers.!
with the 100,000,000 folks back home.
The policy announced is that which the British govern- j
ment tried at first Nothing was printed from the front
except official dispatches, lacking in details and in per
sonal appeal. As a result public interest in the war!
lagged. The army was an unreal, abstract thing, far off
somewhere, doing something or other, and the people at
home naturally enough became indifferent and forgetful. !
Finally the government realized the necessity of mak
ing the war real to the nation. Skilled writers were sent
to the front and allowed' to see and report things that ,
gave the struggle life, realky, color. Soon the nation;
was awakened, following the campaigns with intense in-;
terest, and doing its part eagerly in keeping up reinforce
ments and supplies.
It will be apathy here if our expeditionary forces mere
ly disappear "somewhere in France," to be heard of again,!
only through dry army reports. j
We are just entering the war. We have everything to :
prepare, armies to raise and train and equip and trans-j
port billions of money to contribute, millions of tons of;
ships to build, incalculable quantities of war materials
to make ready for ourselves and our allies. And all this
is not a mere matter of mathematics, of logical plans, of
official procedure. We need driving force back of the
system interest and inspiration. We can only have
those If the war is visualised by th nation, if we can
picture day by day what the boys already at the front are
doing, and what the rest will do when they get there.
This is no special-privilege appeal on the part of the
press. The newspapers always have plenty of news to
print. It's an appeal for common sense, for recognition
of popular psychology, for permission for the newspapers
to serve their country well by providing the material
with which they can win full popular support for the war.

PRUSSIANIZING AMERICA.
Some of our Socialist and pacifist friends are worried
lest i the stress of war we become -Prussianized." They
are alarmed at every new authority delegated to the
govrnment Tbev are jealous of every yielding of cus
tomary private right to meet a war emergency. They
seem to feel that there is some insidious conspiracy at
work to rob the people of their hard-won liberties and
establish a governing caste in the United States.
The Saturday Evening Post advises these troubled folk
to be calm, and remember that "political liberty does not
reside in words printed in a law book." The president
and congress it remarks, have no more power to make;
Prussians or Russians than they have to make us Malays. I
"The fact about political liberty resides, in the genius i
and disposition of the people. A few hundred men at j
Wasihngton cannot alter it The precise wording of their j
theory as to what restraints upon individual liberty war
makes expedient is not worth any great amount of nerv-j
ous wear and tear."
If the government is invested with extraordinary au
thority during the war, it is because a free nation wills it.
That has been proven to be the best way of waging war
When the need is past the same free nation will do pre
cisely what it thinks best And either after or during
the war it will make short shrift of any public official:

THE SECRET OF POWER.
The odds in favor of marriage is said to be two to on.
Why is H that some people succeed and others fail?
Why It is that of two sisters in the' same home one be j
comes immersed in a dozen activities, rises through them ,
to more and more ability to swing things and to greater:
and greater enthusiasm for living and enjoying, while!
another of larger inherent capacity runs along in a rut.
bored, unhappy, accomplishing litUe of work, less of
play, growing scarcely at all? Why is it that of two
brothers, one forges ahead in business, becomes pros
perous, honored, while the other sticks at the Job he had
when he first started out. is always small minded and
small-moneyed?
It is not a question of mental or moral equipment.
Often the unsuccessful one has more than the other?
Many people puzzle over this and seek strange, curious
and far-fetched causes. But the reason is simple. The
secret of power is no secret to those with ears to hear
it or eyes to read R. It consibts of two words: Imagina 1
I
tion and Faith.
The man who gets ahead has used his imagination to
see himself in higher and higher places. He doesn't look
at other successful people enviously, in some such phrase
as. "Some people have all the luck: no chance for me."
He looks at them cheerfully thus: "Fine that Jones has
prospered! Proves what one man has aoue anoincr uidu
can do. Some day I'll get where I want to be. too."
Ail tbings are possible to successful people simply be
cause from the beginning they have believed that all
tbings are possible and acted ou that belief. That's th?
only secret of power there is.

not so strange when it is considered

higher than that of the -British tar.
"The American gets a dollar every
time we get a shilling," is a common
expression among the admiring Brit
ish seaman. One of the American sail
or's favorite ways of showing his op
ulence is his habit of always traveling
as first class. The extra cost is only
a few pence but the unheard of idea
of a common sailor traveling first
class strikes the populace as a start
ling and audacious maneuver worthy
the beet traditions of American travel
ers. Graves Are Decorated.

find the vistor an easy mark soon

PICTURE AT CENTRAL
UNDERWORLD FILM
AT THE STAR TODAY
"It May Be Your Daughter" a pow
erful photo drama of underworld lift
in New York, will be shown at the
Star theatre for two days, starting to
day. Here is the message of warning
the film gives to the public:
"Perhaps your daughter has been
taught the lesson which all girls
should be taught by their mothers.
Perhaps not. Possibly you are one
of those mothers who think that life
should not be talked over.
"Your daughter faces the world im
properly fortified against the tempta
tions with which she will be surround
ed. Ignorance is danger. You trust
to her natural Instinct to do right
But a stronger will than- hers may
break down such barriers.
"The greater the lack of kjnowU
edge, the greater the dependence your
daughter will place in those who pro
fess friendship. She love9 to please
the one who may looked up to by her
as the one of all that is good and
great and honorable. Promises are
looked upon as binding as signed doc
uments. "Give your daughter the knowl
edge which is a strong shield In time
cf temptation. But the danger of for
bidden paths does not present Itself
until the awakened conscience begins
to sting."
BIG BOWLING MEET
The first and second bowling teams
of the Y. M. C. A. will stage the last
tournament of the series at the Smel
ter city Saturday night for the Shield
trophy, between the bowlers of Doug

will start at 8 o'clock.
GIVES KNITTING MACHINE.
AH women in Warren who are in
terested in the making 'of hospital sup
plies for the Red Cross are requested
to meet at 3 o'clock tomorrow after
noon at the home of Mrs. F. E. Shine
to discuss plans for a work room in
Warren.
Owing to the fact that Dr. Bledsoe
has presented a knitting machine to
the local Red Cross chapter, the pro
ceeds of the tea to be held at the resi
dence of Mrs. Arthur Houlft Tuesday
afternoon will be used for buying

TO VISIT SISTER.

A romance of the "one-night-stands"
is "The End of the Tour,"
the Matro-Columbia five-act feature
photo drama starring Lionel Barry-
more, to be shown at ahe Central
theatre tonight. "Buddy" Bennett
(MY. Barrymore) is the leading man
of the Chicago Ideals Theatre com
pany, a barnstorming "troupe" which
comes to grief "on the road."
The play depicts graphically the
life of traveling players who are not
overburdened with success. The
company is playing "Camille" through
the west and the receipts dwindle
with each performance. "The End or
the Tour" shows the interior of threo
different smal ltown theares. in all
of which the company plays "Ca
mille." On the first night the players
take in $19.50, the next $9.60 .and
finally nothing. Irate sheriffs pounce
upon the company to demand money
for overdue board bills, and the en
terprising manager puts costumes on
them and makes actors of them for
the night to impress the audience with
the size of bis "troupe."
Small-town fire engine houses, riv
al companies of which give amateur
performances of "The Fireman's
Bride" and other gems add to the fun.
The actors stranded, teach the fire
men how to act. and thus earn a few
square meals. Finally . help comep
