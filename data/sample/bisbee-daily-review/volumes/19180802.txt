er a short period of relative calm
on the Soissons-Rheima Calient,
the central and western sections
of the battle front again have
been the scenes of mighty strug
gles. On both sectors the allied forces
have achieved notable gains of
ground which seemingly place the
German armies in precarious posi
tions. From the region of Soissons to the
northwest of Fere En Tardenois and
southeast of the last named town over
the upper portion of the left branch
of the "V" salient running ten miles
eastward from Nesles to Ville En Tar
denois and with St. Gemma as its
southern base, American, French and
British troops have pushed back the
armies of the German crown prince.
, Northwest of Fere the entire elbow
i of the line where it turned eastward
along the northern bank of the Ourcq
has been blotted out. making the line
straight one from Fere to Hartennes
and giving the allies much better
ground over which to work in further
outglanking the Soissons on the south
east and for pressing on toward Fls
mes in conjunction with troops now
holding strategic points north and
northeast of Fere.
In this fighting the allied troops
drove out the Germans who had been
tenaciously holding positions between
Plessier Huleu and the river and took
the high ground north of Grand Rozoy,
pressed on past the' village of Breug
neux and arrived before the villages
of Cramoiselle and Cramaille. The
general advance was about two mile-?,
and 600 Germans were made prisoner.
The most important gain, how
ever, was on the upper western
point of the "V" southeast of Fere.
Here the village of Cierges and
the Meuniere wood were taken, a
maneuver which places the Ger
mans at the bottom of the "V" at
St. Gemme in a seemingly pre
carious plight, for from the wood
and the village the allied guns will
be able to rake the Germans, if

WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 1, (By the Associated
Press.) General Mangin, with the
French and British troops of his com
mand! is fighting a severe battle north
of the Ourcq river and is making con
siderable progress.
After taking the village of Grand
Rozoy, northwest of Fere En Tarde
nois, the allied troops advanced to the
Plessiere wood, where the combatants
are in the closest of giips and the
combat is extraordinarily fierce. The
heights north of Grand Rozoy have
fallen into the hands of the allies and
at several points the allied troops have
approached within five miles of the
railroad leading to Bazoches, which is
the only railroad that can be used by
the Germans for maintaining commun
ications. With the fall of darkness tonight
fighting continued between the allies
and the Germans on the western side
of Soissons-Rheims salient. Allied ob
servers reported that bodies of Ger
mans were fleeing precipitately north-
ward along the road leading from Lau-
noy, which lies about midway between
Soissons and Fere En Tardenois.
The attack by the allied forc?s
which brought them such good results
during the day, started at 4 o'clock
this morning with the aid of tanks.
The British Joined with the French
in attacking the woods, thickets and
villages, each of which had been trans
formed into a fortress, with the aid of
machine guns.
By 6 o'clock hill 205 and the villages
of Courdoux, Servenay and Cramolscl
les had fallen before the determiend
assaults and prisoners were coining In.
By 7 o'clock the advance was so mark
ed that the British and French bat
teries were able to go forward to new
positions. The German guns replied
feebly, but their mitrailleuses were
very numerous. ,
The enemy counter attacked furious
ly frofn Buzancy and Eveque wood,
but their efforts were splendidly helu
up by the allied infantry.

I Aug. 1 (By the Associated PPress)
8 p. m. The American troops
pushed forward their lines at cer
tain points Thursday on the cen
ter of the Rheims-Soissons sali
ent, notwithstanding the resist-.
ance of the GermSns, who did not
! give ground on some sectors un-
! til they actually had been shot
j from their positions.
! The Germans are desperately cling-
ing to their strongholds at Nesles and
in the Bois Meniere, northeast of
Roneheres, but the Americans have
gained a hold on the northern edge of
the Meuniere wood. The Nesles for
est is under the range of the Ameii
can heavy guns.
Aviators report that the Ger
mans are rushing up reinforce
ments, including tanks. The en
emy's heavy guns are pounding
the Nesles and Meuniere woods
unmercifully.
Observers and prisoners who
had been brought behind the lines
previously reported the forests as
having been jammed with Ger
man troops and also with large
quantities of supplies. The Ger- .
man losses in men therefore must
have been very great as the heavy
guns started shelling the woods
several days ago, -The
allied troops continued today
to encounterf barbed wires. Between
Peringes and Sergy there were woven
fields of wire entanglements. At the
creek crossines and in the valleys thei
German machine gunners held their
commanding positions until the heavy
guns of the French and Americans
blasted away through the wire and
ousted the enemy from his positions.
Some of the enemy machine gunners
stuck to their post under terrific fire
till they were killed.
The American heavy artillery com
mands the village of Chamery, north
east of Sergy, the Americans having
wrested the hill beyond the last named
village from the Germans in a battle
lasting for hours. The lines swayed
back and forth many times but the
Americans eventually pushed th Ger
mans back. This fighting was in the
open and the American infantrymen
showed great courage.
To the north of Cierges the Ameri
cans also advanced their line. Th
fight began early Thursday for the
possession of a farm from which the
Americans swept away the Germans.
North of Sergy the Americans crossed
wheat fields that had been planted by
Frenrh peasants, the crop of which
had been partially garnered by the
Germans. What remained of the
wheat was recovered by the Ameri

throughout Thursday. The Germans

WHILEON LEAVE
Former Sheriff Arrives to Al
low Service of Warrants
and Suit; Tells Conditions
at Front
Capt. Harry Wheeler has arrived in
Tombstone and will arrive in Bisbee
this morning from the county seat to
spend the day here. He arrived in
Tombstone at a late hour Wednesday
night coming from Alamcgordo. N. M..
wJiere he had been with Mrs. Wheeler
for the past few days.
He is here on a short leave of ab
sence and expects to return to Wash
ington to report for duty again as
soon as his leave is up. He was seen
at Douglas and Osborn Wednesday
night when he went through and those
who saw him report that he is con
siderably fleshier than wien he went
'away, and he said he had gained about
twenty pounds in weight.
His sole object in coming back to
the I'nited States at this time was that
he might submit himself to the serv
ing of the warrant charging him with
being involved in t-ie deportation of
I. W. W. and their sympathizers from
Bisbee, as his friends had been. He
also wished to be served with the
papers in the damage suit filed; by
deportees, as he did not want to have
the impression get out that he was re
maining "over there" in the service
of the government to avoid legal com
plications. As soon as he gets these
matters straightened out he will re
port for duty to the war department
at Washington.
Captain Wheeler since he went to
France iias been In charge of a squad
ron of men in the air service and has
been drilling thum. . He had command
of 350 men. He made a request for
transfer to the infantry in order that
he might get into action at the front
and just before he left France he was
given the following message:
"You have been designated by the
commander in chief for duty with the
front corps. This was based on your
application and on the recommenda
tion of the chief of air service, due
to your special qualifications for
service with combat troops at front.
The chief of the air service hopes that
you will soon be able to complete the
duty for which you are ordered to
Washington and that the war depart
ment may see fit to expedite your re
turn to France for service at the front.
Signed: WHITEHEAD."
When asked about the American
troops in France he said:
"You can tell the wives, sweet
hearts, mothers and all realtlves of the
boys that their morale is of the best.
They are living cleanly and morally
Jand any report to the contrary is the
rankest lie that could be circulated. I
speak rom observation of my own
squadron of 350 men. For clean liv
ing and morals there could not be a
better bunch of boys. Being with them
personally all the time I know of what
I speak for I ate and slept with them
all the time.'
"We are all well fed and the food
is the best but there is no waste. The
men over there appreciate the manner
in which the people of the I'nited
States are backing them up in the
matter of food and their going on ra-

(Bv Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. Aug. 1. There are Indica
tions that the situation has changed iu
the last three weeks in northern Rus
sia and that the Germans shortly will
begin an offensive against the south
ern part of the Murman railway. The
Finnish population now is intensely
hostile to the Germans. There is a
great shortage of food and the people
are entirely dependent on the entente.
Both the government and the array.
however, are completely under Ger
man control.
The Germans have induced the bol
shevik! government to agree to tho
cession of the whole of the Murman
coast to Finland, notwithstanding th
desire of the inhabitants to remain
Russian. The Finnish army capable
of undertaking an, offensive probably
does not exceel 3o,0t0 men.
In the Ukraine the peasant rising
has assumed large proportions and ap
parently seriously menaces the Ger
man and Austrian communications.
The peasants are destroying the ra'l
roads and have blown up the bridge
southeast of Kiev.
In the Caucasus there is great fric
tion between the Germans and Turks.
The Germans are trying to prevent tho
Turks from occupying Baku, on which
a Turkish attack appears to be immi
nent. Baku probably will fall.
There is evidence of growing dis
couragement in Bulgaria which is said
to be due chiefly to the exploitations
of the Bulgarians by the Germans.

WASHINGTON. Aug. 1. War de

of draft age limitations to provide
greater man power will be laid before
congress next week. Members of the
two military committees have ben.
recalled to Washington by the chair
man to expedite the bill. I
In announcing, following a confer
ence with Chairman Dent of the house
committee, that his increased army
project was virtually ready. Secretary
Baker would not say what age limi's
had been settled upon, nor indicate in
any way the size of the army which
he is planning.
"I do not want to say what the age
will be," he said, "because the concur
rent action of the two bouses is neces
sary to secure assent to them.
"Any suggestion to extend the draft
ages is to produce in class one an ade
quate number of men for the enlarged
military program. If the ages are re
vised, they will have to be either be
low 21 or above 31, or both. I think
it will be both."
Chairman Dent was even more re
ticent but said he was willing to go
either up or down in extending age
limits of the draft to win the war.
"My personal preference is to go up
first." he added.
The only specific information re
garding the new age limits to 1

ment that the limits of 19 to 4t) had

is still apparent, although there is evi
dence of a strong sentiment toward
carrying the maximum up as high as
45. There is no doubt, however, that
war Viepartment officials would prefer
to draw on the classes of 19 and 20
year old youths. Secretary aBker has
heretofore announced that his policy
in recommending any change in draft
ages would be to seek a sufficient
number of men to meet the army's
needs in such ages as would least dis
turb the economic situation at home.
The bulk of the new torces,. in his
view, should be drawn from the young
est class of men physically fit.
From the purely army standpoint
this has been a boy's war from the
start. Their economic recuperative
powers have been vitally necessary to
the military machine. . .r- .
Old men are slower to recover and
ure therefore of more limited use to
the army.
On the other hand, however, there
are a great number of men who couid
be called ont of the higher ages, even
up to 45. A far greater proportion
of the men between 31 and 45 have
independent incomes than is true with
men below 31, reducing the depend
ents factor for exemption to that ex
tent. It is not certain that the departmert
is aiming at the creation of a force
of any definite size. There are now
upwards of 1,300,000 American troops
either overseas or en route. Secretary
Baker said today the shipment rate

LONDON, Aug. 1. 'That the Ger
mans actually took the offensive on
the American front is the most sig
nificant of yesterday's events," say
the Reuter correspondent at American
headquarters under date 'of Wednes
day evening. "Their attacks were
genuine efforts to gain ground, though
all were defeated.
This must mean either the enemy
is more confident of his ability to re
bist cur advance or that he is under
pressing necessity to hold it up a lit
tle longer. He left a lot of men be
side the Ourcq. some of the best he
had, which means that he had thought
the gain of a day worth a big price,
since he probably had six thousand
men put out of action on a front of a
mile and a. half.
"These Americans are the indominit
able chaps and quick thinkers, too, and
quick thinking counts."

on bcth sides, indicating to observers
here that the withdrawal to the Vesle
mus lu full swing.
This has beta expected by officers
here since the American divisions owt
lougut crack German divisions in ter
rific conflcts when began Saturday.
Tue enemy made every effort to hurl
the Amercans back across the Ourcq,
uui he 'ailed. His picked troops
ti.ught to the death, reports from all
sides indicate, but the fierce attacks
of the Americans was not to be denied
and the positions which broke the back
of the German line on this front were
consolidated.
vWth magnificent gallantry, liritUU
and French forces took full advantage
of the situation. The enemy was
Hurled o.'f Chalmont-Iiutte in a dash
ing assault gy Franco-British units and
to the east, the French also hammered
him. Tonight's report shows his line
was made untenable and French and
British have made rapid progress in
exploiting the success.
The fact that 600 prisoners were
taken in one part of the action indi
cated the retreat was more precipitate
than it has been for the last few days.
This was viewed as further evidence
hUt the enemy was withdrawing under
pressure and gave new hopes that his
lines along the Vesle would not be
fully prepared when the allies arrived
before them.
Aside from the gains in territory
made in the allied counter drive, of
ficers believe it has already served its
greatest purpose in proving to the Ger
man army that it is not invincible.
His best troops have been thrown in
recklessly and fought with utter hero
ism without avail.
It is a nwe lesson for the German
army, many officers say. There is no
thought that it will sap the morale of
the enemy forces, but filtering back
through the fighting men to the peo
ple at home, will get a new conception,
it is said a feeling that Germany's
best is not sufficient for the task it has
set itself.

As has been the case during the last

allied troops have taken more than
34,000 Germans prisoner.

Field Marshal Haig's men, who in turn

He stated in no uncertain terms
that good work is being done by the

One thing that he wanted to impress

said it was the duty of those who are

NEW YORK. Aug. 1. Ernest Krohn,
secretary of the I. W. W. branch in
this city, who was taken today to the
enemy alien bureau, declared that U
was "just carelessness" that kept him
from registering as an alien and from

According to the federal authorities,
Krohn, who was born in Koenigsberg,

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Aus. 1 Today's stock
market resumed its lethargic and ia
conclusive course, leaders fluctating
idiy within 1 to 2 point limits, while
specialties displayed general heavi
ness. Prices opened with an uncertain
trend, but the list ' immediately be
came reactionary on moderate selling
of rails.
Such, Issues as Union Pacific, Can
adian Pacific, Heading; Baltimore Ac
Ohio, Norfolk & Western, Wabash pre
ferred "A" and "B," and Missouri Pa
cific preferred back 1 to almost 2
points.
United States Steel remained unre
sponsive to the remarkable quarterly
financial statement, making a gross re
versal of slightly more than 1 point.
Shippings, motors, oils and an odd
assortment of unclassified shares re
acted 1 to 3 points and tobaccos re
flected the absence of professional in
terest. Sales amounted to 230,000
shares.
The day's most noteworthy develop
ment was a sudden decline during the
afternoon in rates for call money from
6 to 4 per cent. The break was with
out influence in time funds.
Domestic bonds, including Liberty
Issues were irregular, but the inter
national group pained large fractions.
Total sals, par value, aggregated $5,
225,000. Old United -States bonds un
changed on call.

CHICAGO. Aug. 1. Unfavorable
crop reports, especially in regard to

August $1.55 and September $1.57
to $1.57. Oats gained Vi to 3S)
'vs. The finish in provisions varied
from 30 cents decline to 5 cents ad
vance. Bulges in the value of corn began
as soon as the market opened. As a
result of damage by not winds the
crop conditions in Oklahoma was re
ported only 39 compared with 80 a
month ago. Other reports were cir
culated which put the present con
dition of corn throughout the United
States 6 points lower than on July 1.
The prevailing sentiment continued
decidedly bullish through the session.
The fact that arrivals here hardly ex
ceeded 120 acres was an additional
strengthening factor.
Oats derived firmness chiefly from
corn.

A Precedent
There is nothing new under the sun.
"For," as the poet says, "we are the same
that our fathers have been, we see the same
sights that our fathers have seen, we drink
the same stream and we see the same sun,
and we run the same course that our fathers
did run." There is a precedent for every
thing, including allied intervention in Rus
sia. When Napoleon invaded Spain and Port
ugal and defeated the armies of these na
tions and set his brother upon one throne
and one of his marshals on the other, con
ditions in these countries were not so very
unlike those of Russia when the Hun as
sumed control via the bolshevik route. The
Spanish people were upon the point of re
bellion against their ruling power and fell
an easy prey to Napoleon's generals. But
they were a free people. It was Spanish
land and Spanish blood with centuries of
Spanish tradition behind them that Na
poleon undertook to dominate. Spain sub
mitted, because she had to submit, but her
sons took the field in guerilla warfare
against the conqueror. They called upon
England to help them drive out the invader
and Sir Arthur Welfesley, afterwards the
Duke of Wellington, was sent to Portugal
with a small English army. The Pennin
sular campaigns followed and Napoleon's
marshals were beaten one after the other
by armies of which the English troops
formed the nucleus. In the end Napoleon
was driven out of Spain and he lost veteral
troops there he needed sadly at Leipsic a
few years later and worse still at Waterloo.
England moved her troops from Spain
and Portugal as soon as their task was per
formed and there was never any trouble
afterwards; no claims or counter claims or
cloud or contention over the land and blood
that Anglo-Saxon valor had redeemed from
bondage. Portugal never forgot. Spain,
however, has proved ungrateful, and today
maintains a benevolent neutrality towards
the great enemy of England today.
Napoleon might well have died emperor
of France and never forced to stand at
Leipsic or go down in defeat at Waterloo
if England had left him in undisputed con
trol of Portugal and Spain. The English
thrust from the Peninsula marked his first
reverses. It drained his thinning batallions.
It gave his beaten and demoralized enemies
new confidence. It was the first crack in
his irresistable organization of military
power and success. The English troops
that stood so firm at Waterloo had beaten
the French at Vittoria, Salamanca, Ciudad
Rodriguo and on the Douro with the fa
mous Soult and Murat and Victor and Mas
sena, those marshals who were the pillars
of Napoleon's empire, in command. And
so it was that, the invincibility of the
French of that day having been disproved
at Salamanca, these soldiers argued that it
might well be disproved against Waterloo.
A state of mind of the infantry is half the
battle.
And at this time the Russian empire, be- ,
trayed by a group at home and despoiled by
a foreign power that seeks world dominion,
can be saved only by the armed interven
tion cf the friends of liberty. Every true
Russian of the least intelligence and a spark
of patriotism knows that intervention by
the allied nations means only a temporary
occupancy of his soil, and he knows that
there will not be a single reservation that
will conflict with his country's honor and
future independence and freedom attached
to this invasion. He knows also that the
German invaders have come to stay until
driven out. That they have seized his goods
and his grain and his government. That'
they seek to organize his land to provide
them with resources and cannon fodder for
further wars. P
Any hesitation now on account of the
bolshevik wail is only quibbling and weak
ness and folly that will soon lead to dis

astrous consequences. Body and soul the
bolshevik belong to the Hun. Their every
move has proved it for nearly a year. They
disband their armies before the German
invader coming to despoil and to enslave,
but they would offer armed resistance with
might and main to their former allies, free
nations, seeking to establish liberty and
equality throughout the world.
Oh for a flow of allied armies westward
through Siberia in full force. What a blow
to Berlin! A half million of Japs, a quar
ter million of Chinese and as many divi
sions as are available of the French, Eng
lish and Americans. Crusaders of the twen
tieth century striking the heathen Hun
from the rear. Such a stroke will save a
year of war and a half million lives on the
western battle front as sure as the sun
shines and the shadows follow the setting
of the sun. And generations of Russians
yet unborn will bless that stroke and ven
erate for all time the shades of the men that
make it.

in thirty days.
This vessel is the "Invincible," a sister
ship of the "Defiance," which was chris
tened by Mrs. Schwab on July 4. The
launching in thirty days from the date of
keel laying will shatter the world's record
for speedy shipbuilding. The best previous
performance was the building of the "Tuck
ahoe" in twenty-seven working days.
Mr. Tynan said that immediately after
Mrs. Schwab christened the "Defiance,"
the workmen started to lay the keel for an
other ship of the same tonnage. They set
out to make a record with this vessel,, in
spired by the enthusiasm that Mr. Schwab
showed while he was at the yard.
There are twenty hulls now on the ways
and seventeen will be launched on Labor
Day.
Mulvaney, immortalized by Kipling, de
clared, after he took Lungtunpen with a
score of raw British recruits, that he would
rather have the untried youngsters for dar
ing work and forlorn hopes in a campaign
than the veteran fighting man. "Ramps
ing with bull mate and high feelin's the re
cruitie fears neither man nor diwle," said
Mulvaney. The raw American troops,
most of them boys, have i ought in the
Chateau Thierry sector the past two weeks
in a manner to delight Mulvaney 's heart
and justify every boast for the recruity.
They took Epied three times before they
could finally hold it against the German
counter attacks. They took Sergy four
times before they established their superi
ority over the Prussian guards and a crack
Bavarian division, sent especially to teach
them a lesson. These raw boys were not
alone brave, they were crafty and cool and
determined and resourceful. Beaten back
from machine gun positions they crept
around them Indian fashion and took them
from the rear. They have withstood every
test of modern battle upon a gigantic scale
and. have gone through every species of
escalade, attack and counter attack and
barrage and bayonet work in the woods and
grenade fighting in the village streets and
the bitter work in the shell craters in a
manner to excite the highest admiration of
their countrymen. Verdun and Ypres,
these will always be classics of the veteran
French and English fighting men, but
Sergy, which witnessed the withdrawal of
the Prussian guards after four battles with
the raw American levies, if this is not a
classic, it is at least what Mulvaney would
call a "jool of a piece of verse."
A German dictator, after having sacked
the Ukraine, met the fate that soon or late
comes to most dictators he died with his
boots on. A German ambassador was
killed in Russia. The bolshevik can disband
the Slav armies, but the Russian national
spirit still wields the dagger and the bomb
against tyranny. The German official in
Russia has no sinecure, even after the
purchase of the bolshevik.
Here is the war story, of 1918 in a sent
ence: In the first big drive the German
went through for thirty miles; in the sec
ond he went through for twenty more, and
in the third for another thirty, but in the
fourth he was thrown back for a loss of
fifteen miles. A case of the pitcher that
went to the well once too often, eh, what!

FORMER TEXAS GOVERNOR'S
MYSTERIOUS SOURCE OF IN
COME TESTIFIED TO AT FED
ERAL TRIAL FOR FALSIFYING
INCOME TAX RETURNS
Otv Review Leased Wire)
Al'STIX. Tex., Aug. 1. Testimony
which is believed to have thrown light
on the mystery surrounding the $150.
000 loan to James E. Ferguson, former
governor and wiiicli figured largely in
his impeachment trial last fall, was
given in federal court here today by
L. A. Adoue, Galveston brewer, testi
fying in the cases of Henning Bruhn,
president, and Charles Grossman,
treasurer, respectively, of the Lone
Star Brewing association of San An
tonio, under federal indictment for al
leged falsifying of income tax returns,
when he told of thirteen notes for $50.
000 each which Fprguson gave brewing
interests in the state. The notes were
made payable to Ferguson, indorsed in
blank, were to bear 5 per cent inter
est, payable on maturity and were not
secured. Adoue testified. Former Gov
ernor Ferguson at his impeachment
trial and during Jiia recent campaign
for re-nomination at the democratic
state primary consistenly refused to
tell the source of the loan, maintain
ing that it was a personal matter. The
testimony developed that $25,000 of
the $150,000 was loaned by Bruhn and
$50,000 by Otto WaSrmuud, president
of the San Antonio Brewing associa
tion. It was not brought out definitely
who furnished the remaining $75,000
other than it came from Texas brew
ing Interests.
The government rested its case after
Adoue finished testifying. Adoue de
nied that any portion of the loan was
to be used to influence legislation. Fer
guson, he said, was financially involved
and the brewery interests decided to
help him.
Ferguson's platform was to 'let
liquor legislation alone and that is
what the brewers wanted, Adoue tes
tified. About the State

"The percentage of illiteracy as coin
Fared to the United States as a whole
is very high. This condition is not
due entirely ta a lack of schools in
Arizona or to the character of th
work done by the schools as indicated
by the fact that the rate among for

than among the natives. However, the
percentage of illiteracy among person'!

nothing to indicate that it has any
foundation. Headquarters of the new
rebellion were said to be at Cananea.
General Cailes sent 2'H) soldiers there
to investigate and make a search, but
they found nothing at all to substanti
ate such a report. Cabral. according
to the best Information at my com
mand, is running a store at a mine
near Tucson. He is probably laugh
ing about the reports sent out from El
Paso about him. The people of So
nora want no more revolution. They
have had enough. They want to work
more than anything else. I cannot be
lieve there is any revolutionary move
ment afoot." International.

PLAY SAFETY FIRST.
Those driving atitos down Tomb

path of those coming across the bridge
at the Quality hill car stop, who are
not able to see whether an auto is
about to pass and unknowingly may
step into the street at an untimely mo
ment. School children especially, run
ning across the bridge are unaware of
an atrto which mav he coming down
the street and are exposed to danger.
Several near acc idents during the last
few days have called attention to the
danger.

Any skilled man can continue the
same type of work he has been ac
customed to follow in civil life, wifn
this difference only, he is serving his
country more directly.
For skilled men, military training,

thus saving the government the cost
of a long period of instruction, at the
same time improving their own
chances for advancement.

join the army behind the army, and I
mean men skilled in almost any trade,
they will settle the question once for
all by enlisting in the ordnance corps.
If accepted for enlistment in tins
branch, men will ordinarily be sent to
