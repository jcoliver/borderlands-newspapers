the plan submittde by the American (
representatives. j
"If I should read the document sub-,
mitted by the Americans," said Mr. '
Lloyd -George, "there would be no need
. to make this speech. The case is pre-;
rented with irresistable power and
logic." - j
General Tasker H. Bliss, the Ameri-;
can chief of staff. represented the
I nited States at the council. He was
attended by Arthur H. Frazier. secre-!
tary of the American embassy in

Rawlinson Named.
The premier announced that General
Sir Henry S. Rymer Rawlinson had
teen appointed to represent Great
l.ritain on the supreme war council at
Versailles.
"I hesita.ed for some time," said the
premier in referring to the American
lepresentntions, "whether I should not
read in the house ol commons the very
cogent document submitted by the
American df legaLon. It is jone of the
ablest documents ever submitted to a
military co.iterenc. The only reason
that I did not read it to the house is
that it is mied up with the plan of
operations."
Mr. Lloyl -George said the country
was faced with terrible realities. He
begged the house to have done with
all controversies, adding that the gov
ernment was entitled to know tonight
whether the house, and the country
wished it to pruceed with the policy
deliberately arrived at.

Hun Patrol Riddled
By American Bullets
WITH THE AMERICAN" ARMY IX CHANCE. Feb. 10. A Gernun
patrol ready to ambush an American pairoi was discoitred enrly this
mornine bva sentry, who save the alarm by a rifle shot; theu t!te Anier-
i
' ican machine runs riodled the enemy. The Germans fled, carrying their
"casualties Vith' them, hut the ground w-.iere they had been was '.a'tr
' found to be covered with tell tale red stains
' Tl.e sentry saw two Germans near the parapet and moved to a listen-
, ing post for a better view. He then c.-.aflenged. A s.iot in his direr
tion was the reply. The sentry firtd at the enemy an;! hes.rd a Ger
man shout as the bullet probably hi its mark. Germans then appeared
to grow out of the ground all around and started throwing grenades in
; the direction of the American trenches. Lischine guns and rifles went
' into action from another sector of the trench, sending a hail of bullets
; in'? ,'ne enemy, who retired on the run.
; There were no casualties among the Americans. It was thought pos
si'ul" that this was the same patrol which set a successful ambuscade last
I week. Vh?ther it was. the American forces feel they hive at lean ex
. acted partial reparation. -
T'ie enemy also has been punisoed for h:s killing of, infantrymen in
the nierican tren:nes with shrapnel. The American artillery broke
many shells over the heads of a large German ?roup in a trench, scat-
tering the soldiers and undoubtedly nitting some ofthera. Gas sh?'ls
in considerable numbers were sent against t-ie American batteries last
night, tut no damage was done. Neither were there any casualties.
Th-sre was great aerial activity today cn the American sector and the
anti-aircraft guns were firing continuously. One enemy plane, which
was disguised withenlente markings, fljw over one of the American
trenches and fired a stream of machine gun bullets into it, but without
any result. The enemy aviator made his escape.

NEW YORK, Feb. 19. Further

ailbouqh shippings and raii.s were
comparatively irregular or heavy.
e movement was the widest on
the upswing o- any session this year.
ilany nw high levels were establish
ed for that period. In a Dumber of
instances gains extended from ten to
twenty points over maximums of the
early days of the month.
Fully three-four'hs of the days" turn
over of 895.0ik shares was represent
ed by L'nited States Steel and asso
ciated issues. Steel's extreme ad
vance of IS was largely canceled at
the end. nut elsewhere gross gains of
two to four points generally were re
tained. Motor shares were the chief fea
tures of the last tour, coming for
ward when more representative stocks
were yielding to pressure.
The one important railway return,
that of Atchison for December, show
ed a net increase of almost $sj0.0'0.
Eor.ds were firm, with an unusual
demand for Tnited Kingdom 5's. Li
erty bends were variable but mainly
highly. Total rales (par value) ag
gregated S4.265.0o0.

SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN COPPER STOCK.
Pecos Valley. Oil
This field in which oil has been known tcexist for
many years is now being rapidly developed. A num
ber of the big companies being in the field. Among
them being the Great Western Oil .and Refining Co.
The Standard Oil Company, The Home Investment
Company of Oklahoma. All. of these companies have
already brought in one or more producing wells am,
are sinking other wells rapidly. Land in what is known
to be proven oil land extending from 40 to 50 miles in
length on either side of the Pecos river and from 12 to
I 5 miles in width, this Jand, much of which was of very
little value for any other purpose is now eagerly sought
after and high prices paid for oil leases. Among the
most active companies in the field is the Lake Arthur
Oil Company, with 18,000 .acres in the heart of the
proven field. This is the pioneer company and the land
was carefully selected by Prof. Milton McWhorter, when
the choice of the entire field was to be had. Prcf. Mc
Whorter is an authority on oil "lands and has visited
personally practically all the cil fields of any conse-.
quence in this country and Europe. He is now devoting
his entire time in this field anc! states that this will be
the largest oil field in the Unifed States and that the oil
is a paraffin base and runs very high in gasoline.
The Lake Arthur company has three fully equipped
oil rigs working. One well already producing oil and
two other wells pearing the oil depth which should be
brought in within the next 60 days. These wells be
ing sunk are artesian wells, which have always produced
some oil. but are now being deepened down to tne main
oil bearing sands. The artesian water has been cased
out by forcing cement down through small pipes by
which the artesian water is entirely eliminated. Bisbee
people have now perhaps the only opportunity they will
have to get some of this stock at one dollar per share, as
when sufficient funds are raised to pay for casing the
two" new wells bein sunk, there will most likely he no
necessity for more stock to be sold, as the oil produced
is now brinsiog'$3.00 per barrel at the refinery at Lake
Arthur. This will not only pay for further development
but will soon be paying dividends to its stockholders.
The di rectors, at a meeting on January 31st, passed'
a resolution that after April 1st. 1918. no more stock
would be sold for less than $2.00 and if the new wells
now being drilled are heavy producers, such as the first
one, the price will be far above $2.00. .......
DR. M. W. LANG
of the Lake Arthur Oil Company, is now at the Antlers
Hotel while here. Samples of oil and gasoline are in
display in Sasse's window on Main Street.
