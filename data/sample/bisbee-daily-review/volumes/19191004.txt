had changed.
How much they had changed, Fos
ter declined to tell the senators, un
less they' excluded newspaper corre
spondents from the room- vjhfle he
did it. .This the committee ;did not
do.
Armed with books which Foster
had written during his career in la
bor circles which advocated revolu
tionary socialism and sabotage, and
with copies of the I. W. W. organ
"Solidarity," containing articles con
tributed by him from Europe, where
he went in 1901 as a representative ot
the organization, Foster was pressed
Into a lengthy explanation of the
doctrines and views he advocated In
1914 and earlier years.
Attempts to Parry. . v j
Foster first attempted'to parry the!
questions at the outset, refusing to1
answer questions until newspaper
correspondents were excluded from
the room, on the ground that "lying
newspapers have misquoted my per
sonal opinions with the whole idea
of injuring the cause of 300,000 steel
workers." He was finally crowded
into a declaration when Senator Mc
Kellar, Democrat, of Tennessee, read
ing many quotations from his works,
demanded that fie say whether or not
he' still adhered to his beliefs.
; VThose are not my views now," he
said, in a subdued tone, after listen
ing to his own words repeated, de
claring "the Btate to be a meddling,
capitalistic institution," and advocat
ing violence in strikes as necessary
to the forwarding of the revolutionary
cause.
President Gompers of the American
Federation of Labor broke into the
examination in irritated fashion, at
one point, when Foster was- standing
on his objections to newspaper re
ports ot his testimony.
"Well, they "can't' Bay aaything
worse about you than they already
have," the leader of the federation
adjured him.
Admits Statements.
FoBter would not, however, com
pletely retract his old words,, and
faced with one line to the effect
"that the syndicalist worker will not
be held back from direct action by
the capitalistic code of ethlCB, duty,
Honor, patriotism," he told the om
mittee: ' ' . ''
"Put quotation marks around some
of those, and I will stand by them
yet. ' They'll show how the words are
used."
, Other excerpts from later writings,
slating that "government as we know
It will shrivel up and die" and "Indus
tries now in the hands of the state,
municipalities and the nation will be
given completely over to the workers
In them," he was quite well prepared
to defend.
"I have my ' own Ideas about gov'
ernment," he said of the first, and of
the secoad, "That's not so startling
nowadays."
"Well, that's syndicalism pure and
simple. Isn't It?" Senator Sterling.
Republican, of South Dakota, one of
his most persistent interrogators, de
manded.
"I think not," Foster said.

They estimated that the geyser of

It could be heard for miles and
sounded like the exhausts of 10,000

ALL ATTEMPTS
TO MEDIATE
STRIKE FAIL
LONDON, Oct. 3 (By the Associated
Press). After seven days the railroad
strike situation tonight became the
gravest in the history of any labor
crisis of the British empire in the pres
ent generation. All efforts of the
transport workers federation to find a
bridge to enable a renewal of nego
tiations between the government and
the national union of railwaymen
failed.
Th government's. LpropojAl, for a
seven day truce" for the railroad men
to return to work and permit resump
tion of negotiations on the disputed
points, coupled with the offer by the
government to resort to arbitration in
event of failure to reach an agreement
has been rejected by the railwayman's
union and the whole possibility of
mediation - for the moment seems to
have ' completely collapsed. " '
An appeal haB been made by , the
government for a citizen army to. pro
tect peaceable citizens and to aid in
the work of maintaining the supply of
food. ' ' " . r -'t '
The executive body of the national
union of railwaymen haB disbanded for
the rurpose of engaging in campaign-
meetings throughout the country. A
congress embracing all the ' trade
unions of the United Kingdom has
been called to . convene Tuesday for
the purpose of discussing the situa
tion.
The premier at a conference today
made an impassioned appeal to the
railwaymen to accept the offer of ar
bitration and It is reported that some
delegates of the transport workers
were in favor of accepting the offer.
Robert Williams, general secretary
of the Transport Workers union, in a
statement to the press tonight, refer
red to the breakdown In negotiations
today as "lamentable," announcing
that a congress of trade unions had
been convened for Tuesday to "engage
In any form of moral and sympathetic
support of the railwaymen In the
struggle they are waging for trades
unionism." ' (
In the meantime, Ifr. Williams add
ed, the delegates who had been con
sulting ,wlth Premier Lloyd George
fro mday to day would be made offi
cers of the transport workers federa
tion in order to formulate proposals
they were convinced would prove ac

Attracted by the lure' that
has ever held the Ameri

nine-year-old boy, arrived
here today from Mesa, hav-,
ing walked all the way to
see a circus which is sched
uled to show here within
a few days. Having dis
regarded all the difficulties
which a . lad of his age
Bhould at least imagine in
making such a, journey,
young Orton kept on the
road since last Tuesday,
when he ' ran away ; from

however, and his name and

his. father was notified and
he was returned to Mesa,

Price of Sugar May
Soar First of Year
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3. Told by
George Zabriskle, president of the
suar equalization board, it was
practically certain that unless some
legislative action was taken imme
diately sugar prices would Increase
after January 1, the senate commit
tee investigating the sugar shortage
today requested W. A. Glasgow,
counsel for the food administration,
to formulate legislation,, designed to
alleviate the situation and . to make
powiWe negotiations for purchase
of the 1920 Cuban sugar crop.
The present sugar shortage, the
board president said, was due to
some extent to the recent marine
strike but more largely to the . un
usual demand, the American peo
ple having consumed 300,000 tons
more sugar up to October 1 than
normally. , , . ,

House, by his physician. Dr. Cary

The bulletin was given out
through Secretary Tumulty." Dr. '
Grayson, who made the statement,
declined to elaborate on the brief
bulletin. .It was understood, how
ever, that the president was able
to take som nourishment and got
some sleep during the day.
Reports from the bedside ot
President Wilson, whose condition
. during the last 36 sours has been -less
favorable indicated no change
today and again the president was
kept in bed with physicians in con
stant attendance upon him.
Rear Admiral Cary T. Grayson,
his personal physician, let the an
nouncement that the president
was a . "very sick man" stand
throughout the day, Issuing only a
brief bulletin saying his condition
today was "unchanged."
There was another consultation
of physicians and immediate mem
bers of the president's family
came to the White House to be
near him.
Although reticent about details
of the condition of the president
those who attended him indicated
tbat bla " ailment had not yet
clearly revealed the extent of its
' Inroads upon his system and that
some days might be required to
disclose1 its full effects.
Nervous exhaustion of which he
is suffering, complicated with his
long standing ailment of the di
gestive organs and a lingering
touch of last spring's attack of
influenza, the doctors say, have
considerably weakened the presi

The announcement of. the change
in the plans was made tonight sy,
Breckenridge Long, t third assistant,
secretary of state, who has charge of
try. j
"Because of the president's condi
tion," said the statement, "his majes
ty has seen fit to ! cancel all of the
engagements planned, for up to at
least the 14th, when he would have
been, and still expects to be, in San
Francisco. The only exceptions ' re
late to Boston and Buffalo, where he
is due Sunday and Monday. The prox
imity of these engagements is such
that, his majesty feels he can keep
them, provided the condition of the
president does not get worse, rather
than disappoint the peoples, of those
communities. From Buffalo his maj
esty will proceed directly and imme
diately to a place in California which
will be announced later.
"His majesty haB expressed his
earnest desire to proceed to Wash
ington to pay a' visit of courtesy and
respect to President Wilson, and has
said he would have so proceeded even
if . he could have remained only five
minutes if he had not been advised
by the president's physician that he
would not be permitted to see Mr.
Wilson.

ing to the condition and health of the
president, he, does not care to go to
a place of amusement and consequent
ly has canceled his engagement to gd

Wilson's general .physical 'system
la . said to be In good condition to
withstand the combined attock -against
which he now Is fighting. ;
There have been.no intimations
' of depleted heart taction, and the:
president's mind is declared by :
his physicians to: be so alert that
they nave considerable difficulty
in keping his attention diverted .
from the affairs of his offjee. --.
The prohibition -against official
acta of any kind, modified several
days ago, long enough to permit
him to sign a few bills and nomi
nations, has been rigidly Imposed
again by Dr. GrayBon, who Is pre
pared to be insistent that no exe
cutive business shall come before
the president unless he has shown
marked improvement
, , In enforcing their rest prescrip
tion the physicians attending the
president are particularly : con
cerned about his slepelessness.
This is understood to be connect
ed with after-effects of the influ
enza attack.
Since the president came home
ill there there have been many
reports that a simple operation
might be performed to ward off
complications, but his physicians
have either discredited or declined
to discuss such a possibility, say
ing they could not go into details
as to what measures they might
take. Secluded in his room In the
White House, the president Is per
mitted to see only members of his
family, and virtually the only
sources of public information re

PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct. 3. Crop ro
tation in the Salt. River valley was
advocated here today at a meeting
of representative dairymen and cotton
growers, addressed by W. A. Barr,
state dairy commissioner, and others.

of the valley becoming a "one crop"
section if this movement to produce
cotton rather than to engage in the
dairying continued. It was stated
there were-only 22,000 dairy- animals
in the valley . now compared with
55,000 in 1914. .".
It was decided that resodents of the

BROWNSVILLE, Texas, Oct. 3.
While officials in Mexico City recent
ly were denying published reports
that an order had been Issued to fed
eral troops to fire upon American
airplanes crossing the Mexican bor
der, an American plane, answering
an appeal of the authorities of Rey
nosa, Mexico, sixty miles below the
border here, flew over the town and
dropped on thousand bags needed to
strengthen threatened levees' with
sand bags. This became known to
day when Lieutenant Colonel Manuel
Bernea, commander of the Matamoras
district, expressed his thanks for the
assistance to Brig. Gen. F. C. Mat
shall, Brownsville district command
er, at a diner given in honor of the
American officer at Matamoras. Rey

American military authorities sent
the airplane with the bags from Mc

The Mexican national railroad ser

WASHINGTON, Oct. 3. After a
three-hour discussion ot the peace
treaty, the dominant note of which
was a sharp attack on President
Wilson, the senate late today decided
on a breathing spell until Monday,
with indications that the debate soon
would . embrace the. provision, under
which the Chinese province of . Shan
tung 'was awarded to Japan.
The attack on the president was
made by Senator Jones, Republican,
of Washington, who had expected to
speak two days ago. In charging
that the president "had done more
to undermine orderly government
than any other agency. Senator
Jones declared the "attempt to co
erce" the senate Into ratifying the
treaty unamended or without reserva
tions "embodies the spirit of the mob
and justifies lawlessness."
The president's friends should tell
him plainly and bluntly and prompt"?
that the treaty has no chance of rati
fication in Its present form, said the
senator, who added "and they will
do so when he is able to receive the
news."
Senator Thomas, Democrat, of Col
orado, discussed the amendment or
Senator Johnson, Republican, of Cali
fornia, designed to equalize the vot
ing power of the United States and
Great Britain'. He opposd this change
in the league of nations covenant as
proposed by Senator Johnson, se
said, because the same point was

ly. Senator McCumber announcing I
that he would later undertake to show'

voting proposition.
While not willing to vote for the
treaty without reservations, Senator

danger to this country through the
adoption of the treaty.

IS REVEALED
Authorities Say Finding of
Rifles Uncovers Plan to
Begin Racial Trouble in
Helena District.
City Quieting Down;
Spasmodic Clashes
Investigation of Disorders by
Committee of Seven Civil
Authorities Begun; One
Colored Leader Arrested
HELENA, Ark.. Oct. 3. Evidence
has been accumulated that the racial
troubles' in" Helena of the last few
days were due to careful plans on the
part of a certain class of negroes
which was revealed prematurely by
the killing of Deputy Sheriff W. A.
Adkins and the wounding of Deputy
Sheriff Pratt from ambush at HP
Spur, Tuesday night.
A large number of rifles, shotguns
and pistols in possession of negroes
hftve been confiscated and 27 similar
rifles with a large quantity of ammu
nition in cases 'were seized In the
building occupied by the four Johnson
brothers, who were killed yesterday.
The rifles 'and ammunition -were pui
chased outside Helena, it developed.
The suspicions of the negroes ap
parently proved their undoing, for it
is now believed they fired on te
party of deputies at Hoop Spur on the
assumption that their ploting had
been discovered and was being in
vestigated. Situation Normal.
While the situation in Helena Is
almost normal tonight and virtual
calm prevails in the southern part of
the county, which has practically been
a zone of negro insurrection since
Tuesday night, sporadic clashes have
taken place in the last 24 hours.
Three negroes are reported to have
been killed today in addition to two
killed by soldiers near Elaine last
night. Another negro is reported to
have eben wounded by machine gun
fire. Rounding up of negroes by the
federal troops sent into the section
continues.
Investigation of the disorders was
begun .today, by a "committee of
seven" appointed by the civil authori
ties of the county with the approval
of Governor Charles Brough. The
committee is working in co-operation
with the military authorities and will
take testimony from negroes as well
as white persons.
A statement issued late today over
the signature ot officials and promi
nent citizens expressed the opinion
normal conditions would be resumeu
after today.
One Leader Arrested.
Among the negroes arrested ai
Elaine today was one identified as
Ed Hicks, alleged to have been a
leader in the movement to rise
against the white residents. The as
leged head of the disaffected negroea
has not been captured, according to
word reaching here, but his descrip
tion has been sent broadcast, hisnam
being given as "Hill" or "Hall." His
home is said to be at Winchester,
Drew ccAinty, to the southwest of the
scene of the racial troubles in this
county.
Henry Sloan, negro, was arrested
at West Helena, four miles from here,
last night, on a charge of making In
cendiary speeches In the negro sec

tonight. -This is the only incident

LOS ANGELES
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8. Address
ing an audience of several- "hundred
persons here 1 today at a luncheon
tendered him by the Los Angeles
League for the Preservation of Amer
ican Independence, United States
Senator Hiram W. Johnson attacked
the peace treaty and the league of
nations covenant and declared that
the United States now stands at the
cross roads of its destiny. Senator
Johnson is to make another address
tonight.
The people must decide, lie said,
whether the United States shall enter
into a partnership with, "malodorous
European and Asiatic diplomacy," or
pursue the" straight " path' of pure
Americanism. - ,
Senator Johnson ' was given a dem
onstrative' reception and his address
was interrupted many times when his
utterances brought the 'big crowd to
its feet cheerin gand waving handker
chiefs. The senator spoke in the ball
room of a hotel where two weeks ago
President Wilson defended the treaty
and the league of nations and urged
its early ratification. V ).,
' At the senator's table were gath
ered many of his ..triehds who were
active in the early days of the Progressive-party.
' whieh - swept Hiram
W. Johnson into office "as governor ol
California; .-...-Principles
Discarded.
,"Ve saw the high principles . of
President Wilson discarded,'.' said
Senator Johnson, "we saw altruism
gone and idealism buried and we saw
open covenants openly arrived at ac
complished behind barred doors. We
looked to see the removal of economic
barriers; we looked to see national
armaments reduced, but we never
heard the semblance of an. . accom
plishment. We saw arbitrary power
have its will in the adjustment, of
world affairs and we saw a defensive
and offensive alliance brought about
instead of a desired understanding
for world peace' -
Senator Johnson declared that the
treaty represents the understanding
of the United States co-belligerents
before this country entered the war.
'Dismissing the .Shantunx prqyisions
of the treaty. Senator Johnson as
serted, that America's acceptance of
the transfer of Chinese sovereignty
of the Shantung peninsula to Japan
was a shameful blot on America's
honor.
China Despoiled.
The United States government, the!
senator continued, invited China io
participate in the world war on a
promise that China would be taken
care of at the peace table. She was
taken care of to the extent that the
United Slates became a party to her
despoilment, Senator Johnson assert
ed. The league of nations was de
nounced by the senator as tantamount
to conferring on foreign powers the
exercise of America's participation in
foreign affairs. Eight men, sitting la
Geneva, all foreigners, he said, could
and would determine the course of
the United States in . World quarrels
In which this country would be
dragged .'.to assist in matters in
which she could have no concern,
senator Johnson said the threat
that the United States would be iso
lated if the senate refused to rauiy
tha 'ra trsatv and the- covenant
was ridiculous.. So long as the At
lantic and Pacific oceans remain, said
Senator Johnson, the United States
could not in any sense remain iso
lated from any part of the world. And
President Wilson cannot dry uy those
oceans, he, said.

JEWS, THE WORLD OlIER, ILL
B
Today is the tenth day of the
month of Tishri, the seventh month
of the Jewish religious year and the
first month of the civil year and Is
the holy day of Yom ha-Kipurim, or
Yom Kippur; the Day of 'Atonement.
Beginning at sundown yesterday and
continuing until sundown this even
ing, the Jews of the world devote
thehiseives; to penance and mortifi
cation. r Every form of pleasure is
forbidden, as . is likewise eating,
drinking or any other thing of com
fort. .. ' : . ,:. . v -. ;
The established - rule Is to spend
the whole "of the night' and day in
prayer. During . tre day the Torah
is read twice; in the morning after
Shararit and,' in the afternoon, be
fore fMinhah. Afer the, Nellah,, or
closing service, the ram'sj horn trum
pet is . heard once as a token of
spiritual as,; well fas physical free
dom, while .the, last, wish of the day
is for the restoration of Jerusalem.
The year begins with Rosh ha
Shanah.and then come 10 days of med
itation, when the Day of Atonement
is -commemorated.. 'The books of life
and 'death, according to the old rit
ual, are opened on' Rosh ha-Shanah
and closed on Yom ha-Kipurim. The
righteous are inscribed for life at
the very opening of the books; the
wicked are sentenced., to -death and
the indifferent are given time to
repent before . the books -are closed.
The prayers and sacrifices begin
in . the . evening of the ninth day,
with the Kol Needrah, a beautiful
but melancholy portion of the He
brew, ritual. Today there will be
four . services. The morning prayer
is called the Sachtis; then comes
the ' Musaf, - or additional service;
the third, or afternoon service is
named Mincha, "and the closing ser
vice is the Neilah.
The outstanding features of all
the services are the prayers for for

prayers include not only supplication
DEMOCRATS Dli
TO TOUR STATE
CIOENIX. Oct. 3. T. H. Drenn'an,
secretary of the Democratic state cen

here today to the people of ..rizona
that the committee "has nothing what
ever to do with bringing Senator Reed
to Arizona.
Drennan said he issued the state

relative to the visit to Arizona of Sen

speaking tour in opposition to the

prayers for forgiveness for the sins
committed ' by man against man.
Therefore, it is a strict rule that
he who Jias injured his neighbor
during the year mast see , .o'give
ness from him as well as from God.
. With regard to the Day, of Atone
ment and its significance, a Jewish
writer says:
"There' is a moral death and there
is a physical death. The deeds of
the righteous live , forever. They
become the- inspiration of succeed
ing generations. The misdeeds of
the wicked bring about death and
destruction, wherever encountered.
Life becomes purposeless to those
who do hot find aught but temporar
iness .upon - the . path of their lives:
Life -is full -of hope and strength,
or purpose and Interest, to those
who believe in the existence of eternity.-'
"To that end a real spiritual ac
counting' must take place periodi
cally within the heart of everyone
capable of distinguishing right from
wrong. Self-satisfacaion leads to independence-"
to a feeling of security.
Ethical- philosophers may scorn the
idea of resorting to these methods
of affliction of soul in order to ob
tain a sfiritual victory over self
Pagans may Jiave gone to, extremes
in punishing themselves to please
their deities. Judaism - warned
against these practices," but aimed
at a middle course which would be
as acceptable to reason as to the
law of , God."
. . The next holy day day of the Jews
will be Wednesday, the 15th
day of Tishri, when ha-Sukkah, or
the Feast of Tabernacles will be
celebrated. This day commemorates
j.the time when the Jews left Egypt
and spent 40 years in the wilder
ness. It Is sometimes called the
Hag ha-Asiph, or the day of the
gathering in of the crops.
the state Democratic central commit
tee has nothing whatever to do with
bringing Senator Reed to Arizona.
"I understand the League for the
Preservation of American Indepen
dence will receive the senator upon his
arrival in Phoenix and entertain him
during his stay here.
' "It may not be amiss at this time
to remand the public that the great
war was fought for the purpose of sav
ing the world from autocratic rule and
we should uphold the hands of Presi
dent Wilson in his earnest endeavor
to carry out the very things for which
the war was waged."
PROGRESSING SENTIMENT.
New York Herald.
The plain truth, understood by all
save those who are so blind that they
will hot see, is that as the expound
ing has proceeded from the vision or
"a" loague of nations to the actuality
of "this" League of Nations there has
been an increase by leaps and bounds
iSf the immber of Americans who do
not believe that their country should
enter Into any league of nations. Th3
growth of that feeling, found in ai.
parts of the country, has thrown a
scare into the camp of the supporters
of the unamended and unreserved
covenant.
IMMIGRATION
SOUGHT BY
ARGENTINA
WASHINGTON. Oct. Argentina
needs and is encouraging desirable
immigration from Europe, although it
is using its best efforts to get rid of
those whose purpose is to hinder the
progress of the country) .either as in
dividuals or .through "undesirable
organizations," said Dr. Tomas A. Le
Breton, ambassador from Argentina,
yesterday. ', "
In regard to the report that colon
ies of Germans are -preparing to mi
grate to Argentina, Ambassador Le
Breton made the following statement:
. " "The national constitution in Its
preamble declares that it is one of its
purposes to 'guarantee the" freedom
and general welfare of people from
any part -of the world who may wish
to live on Argentine soil. Article 25
provides that 'the federal government
shall encourage European immigra
tion', and shall ont restrict, limit or
burden, with any tax whatsoever, the
entrance into Argentine territory of
any foreigners who come to the coun
try for the purpose of cultivating land.
developing the industries, or intro
ducing and teaching' arts and sciences
Government Makes Rules.
''Pursuant to this legal precept, the
government has provided rules and
regulations for the application of this
clause, determining ' what foreigners
should he admitted as helpful in the
development of agriculture, industry,
arts and sciences, and who should be
excluded because their purpose is to
hinder the progress of the country or
to endeavor to deviate, by means of
undesirable organizations, its forward
course. To this effect steps have been
taken, not onlyrof a domestic nature,
but also for a convention with all the
neighboring countries.
"The situation of the Argentine Re
public at the present time as regards
density of population is the same as
that of the United, States in the mid
dle of the last century, enormous ter
ritorial area, first-class production
and scarcity of population. On the
first of January of this year the to
tal population of the country we fig
ured to be only 8,412,000, while there
could live on our soil about the same
number of inhabitants as now live in
the United States.
Immigration Has Declined.
"The annual " immigration, which
reached 323,403 in 1912, has decreased
on account of the war. This has made
the balance between emigration and
immigration adverse to us, but for
tunately this balance only reached the
figure of 13,138 against our popula
tion in 1917. We hope that from this
year on, the balance will be in our
favor and that desirable immigration
will go to our country.
"The course of social events and
the difficulties . experienced in the
wage problem all over the world
force us to be cautious and to avoid
causing serious disturbances in the
economic situation of our workmen.
"Some people speak about the dan'
ger of absorption by, or at least the
influence of immigration in large ho
mogeneous groups. In my opinion
there Is no such danger; in the first
place, because the national authori
ties will not tolerate an' organization
of this kind ; and In the second place.
because our laws and customs make
a rapid assimilation inevitable."

KERR HOLDS HARDHITTING REDS
i
TO THREE SCATTERED HITS
HURLS FIRSTSERIES SHUTOUT
CHICAGO, Oct. 3. The Chicago
White ' Sox today served notice that
they were still in the "world's cham
pionship contest by defeating Cincin
nati 3 to 0. . ..
The series now stands: Cincinnati
2; Chicago 1. Six more games are
possible, unless one of the contestant!
should annex five victories without
going the limit.
Dick Kerr, who In his younger days
waa something of a boxer as well as
a ball player in St. Louis, and who
came to the Sox from Milwaukee,
pitched unbeatable ball, allowing onry
three scattered hits and one pass to
first. Kerr's home Is at Paris, Texas,
and he first played professional base
ball at Paragould. Ark.
He made everybody sit up and look
at him today, for his left wing con
tained. more mysteries than a ephyn
Duncan Fisher, the Cincinnati pitches
who also burled a good game, and
Kopf were the only Reds to obtain
bingles off the Texan, while his sole
complimentary passage, to first was
granted to Groh. None of these ath
letes ever reached third.
Twenty-nine thousand persons,
which included a band of rooters from
Cincinnati, saw the game, which was
played beneath a bright sun In
temperature which was ideal. There
was scarcely breeze enough to
straighten the flags which fUateu
from innumerable staffs. Alter tne
trouncing which the American leat
uers received at Cincinnati, Managei
Gleason felt - particularly . gratirreu
that his team was the first to serve
a shutout. There were a few vacant
seats in the left field bleachers, prob
ably due to the belief on the part of
many that obtaining seats would en
tail too great a struggle. , Grounu
rules were unnecessary, as the play
ing field everywhere was clear sav
just off the first. and third base fou
lines.
Fisher Firt Right Hander.
Fisher, who was Moran's choice tor
today, was the firet right hander of
fered by the Reds, the first two games
having been won by Ruether anu
Sallee, both southpaws. Fisher's
hurling was as, good en thaPof either
of his teammates, but one -run at
least is necessary to win a game, ana
little Kerr had none to spare toda.
Fisher allowed seven hits and Issued
two passes. Two of the Sox runs,
however, were largely chargeable to
the Red pitcher, for it was while his
wild 'heave to catch a runner at sec
ond was being retrieved that, the
firBt two Sox were put in a position
to score, and ' Gandil ; . drove them
across .the; rubber a moment later.
Liebold - was back in his regular
position In right field and at the top
of the Sox batting list when "piay
ball" was called. Despite the Inaus
picious opening- at Cincinnati, the lo
cal enthusiasts were confident that
on the home grounds the Sox woula
exhibit the kind of ball that won then!
the leadership of their league. Ther
was confidence, too. In the attitude
of the pluyers themselves,- but no
more than that displayed by the Reds,
who acted and felt like men of des

The first inning gave every evi

planted his feet firmly and with beau
tiful control struck out Groh. The
local crowd breathed easier to note
how easily the mighty sluggers of
the first two games were disposed of,
but their own side was as quickly
disposed of. Liebold sent a liner to
Neale, who caught the ball off his
shoestrings. Eddie Collins waa re:
tired, shortstop to first, and Weaver
popped out to Daubert.
Chicagoans Startled.
With loush down In the second,
there was a little gasp of affright
among the Chicagoans and cheers
from the visiting enthusiasts when
Duncan singled cleanly over second.
Kerr, however, remained steady. He
put an extra twist on the ball and
Kopf . retired, though not until Sox
partisans had missed a, ' heart beat,
for Risberg Juggled the ball around
until It was too late to keep Duncan
from second and he narrowly missed
getting Kopf at first. The best Neale
could deliver was a Blow roller to
Collins, who threw him out at first.
Kerr was cheered as he left the field.
The Lome crowd found insipration
in a view of the broad shoulders of
Joe Jackson and rooted for a hit. The
outfielder swung like a cyclone at
two and then hit cleanly to left. Hap
py Felsch, the next man up, contem
plated the usual sacrificial offering,
but the fates had decreed that he was
to circle the bases after a brief pause
at second. It was here that Fisher
lost hla own game. Felsh's little
bunt percolated toward tb Red pitch
er, who grabbed It and turned quick
ly to catch Jackson at second. Fish
er was off his balance and his heave
rolled out into the center garden.
Jackson, who had slid, tumbled 'as he
dug his toes in to renew his -running,
but scrambled to his feet in time to
make third. On the throw to third
Felsh made second.
Stands Go Wild.
. With men on second and' third and
none out the stands went wild yell
ing for victory. Chick Gandil, the Sox
first baseman, came to bat at this
thrilling moment. He swung at the
first ball, pitched andit Handed safely
in right, Jackson and Felsh ' both
crossing the plate. Ill looked from
the stands as if Rariden had the throw
from right in time to liave touched
Felsch, but the latter swung awk
wardly around him and was safe.
Fisher,, despite his reversal, had his
feet still firmly planted on the ground.
Gandil had attained second on the
play at the plate and Risberg was up.
Wjth two strikes and three balls
Fisher walked the Sox shortstop, but
dealt sterner stuff to Schalk and Kerr.
S chalk tapped a light one In the di
rection of third, which Fisher fielded
prettily and tossed Gandil out at
third. Risberg reached second and
Schalk was safe at first. The play
was repeated a moment later when
Fisher again fielded Kerr's' little
roller and threw to Groh for a force
out of Risberg.
In the third Fisher, . for the Reds,
and Weaver and Collins for; the Sox,
delivered hits but nothing came of
them.' In the fourth, however, Ris
berg delivered the one long hit of the
day and It resulted In the third and
last run. The shortstop's wallop went
to far right field and before the ball
was returned to its base he was
perched on third, and a pandemonium
of noise in bis ears .testifying to the
J07 of the crowd. There was but
one down, aid the fans began calling
for another - run. Schalk went out
stealing and Kerr was retired on an
Infield- play,. -
Fisher Steadies Down.
In the next four Innings Fisher and
his teammates played brilliantly and
the Sox were successively retired in
rotation. The Sox played the game
,no less Intensely. In the fifth Kopt
singled and. was forced at second by
Neale. Neale reached second on Rar
iden' s infield out.; but Fisher waa un
able to drive . him home.' Schalk
walked to the mound and spoke
steadying words to "Kerr and the lat
ter, delivering a tantalizing bender,
fooled Fisher into a dribbling ground
er on which he was out, third to first.
In the remaining innings the Reds
were retired one. two, three, with
clock-like precision.
Two games remain to , be ' played
here, tomorrow and Sunday. Sunday
night the teams with their loyal fol
lowers retun to Cincianati for two
games more.
The Intensity of the rivalry be
tween the two teams produced a spat
between ; Smith, Cincinnati utility
Inflelder, and Eddie Collins. Players
and umpires crowded between the
two men and they separated, mutter

the person of a cashier in one of the

reason to remember him as 'one oi

WHERE ARE THOSE TEETH ?
WHILE Congress is talking of "shoes and ships and sealing wax
and cabbages and kings" little progress seem to hare been
made toward following out the Presidept'a recommendations
with regard to thofse laws against profiteering. Much has
been said about the kind of "teeth" which will be inserted in pro
posed legislation directed at lowering the cost of living, but the ani
mal still lives without tusks or fangs of any kind.
Instances are not lacking locally of retailers who havo taken ad
vantage of the present scarcity of sugar, for instance, to charge as
high as eighteen cents a pound for that commodity. Nothing can
be done toward prosecuting these profiteers, it seems, although the
federal authorities csfn see to it that such gredy mandlts are shut
off from further j"pply. That, however, is a remedy which, to th
unfortunate residents of the neighborhoods infested by these crimin
als, is almost worse than the disease.
Legislation which will enable the federal departments .and the
civic authorities to deal with those who take advantage of the needs
of the public should be passed without further delay. Too much time
has been lost as it is. Where sugar is concerned, the goodly amount,
secured by Mr. Stafford is but a drop in the bucket.
NO STAMPEDE YET
ONE CASE of the overcrowding of the hotels of New York is
that lh city's residential accommodations are less adequate
then ver to meet the needs of the growing population.
The Times says: "Many discharged soldiers are remaining
here. Thtn there has been an unprecedented number of marriages,
and these new families are clamoring for homes. In the tenement
districts families are doubling up. More prosperous persons are
eagerly taking leases on apartments wherever they may be haft.
Work of remodeling houses into studio apartments goes on, but still
rhere ia not room for all.".
Every hotel in towns has its waiting list. To crown all, the
servant problem gets worse and worse.
The situation in the metropolis is not different from that m
other cities, only possibly more exaggerated. And yet it costs more
to live in cities than it does to live in the country. The unprejudiced
observer wonders why the back-to-the-farm movement does not de
velop into a stampede.
FEELING HIS OATS
9
THE FARMER is feelirg his oats; there is no mistake about that.
Having forced the repeal of the daylight saving law, with the
powerful assistance of certain interests which kept nicely un
der cove?, the "horny-handed son o, toil" looks about for new
worlds to conquer. Referring to the repeal of the summer time law,
he says "daylight wasting is ended and with the close of the present
season comes a return to standard time and a nation once more to
common sense."
We have not noticed any surplus amount of common sense re
cently. Maybe it is indigenous to the farming sections and is held
strictly to its native heath by some sort of an embargo.
The farmers remark that they are continually being exhorter to
organize when as a matter of demonstrated fact they already are or
ganized. the way they are going to d feat the "Lane land grab" a little
later will be a similar demonstration, says the National Grange
Monthly, which adds: "It all points to the significant fact that a new
force has arrived in national aiiairs and that the American farmer
will have to be considered from now on as never before. Farmers
do not shout a great deal about what they are going to do, they sel
dom threaten strikes and as a general thing they will be found at
tending strictly to business on the home fields; hut hereafter they
are not to be fooled by empty words, nor scared by threats nor sil
enced by sheers or taunts; and the sooner those who run the gov
ernment of the United Stales, as well as the public in general, realizes
this fact the better it will be ror all concerned."
Cosh all hemlock!
London tailors are trying to revive the styles of a hundred oi
more years ago when men wore plum-colored suits with plenty of
lace and ruffles and similar fripperies. With clothes as high in
price as they are, this is adding Insult to injury.
The gentle reminder of Senator Ashurst that only snakes and
geese hiss did not serve to quiet the crowds in the Senate galleries
recently. The exhibition scarcely argues for the consideration of
treaties in public session.
Employes of Staten Island shipyards engaged on government
work lost their jobs by taking an unauthorized holiday Saturday.
That ought to bring them to their senses.
The Italian government's request that the allied powers drive

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 3. Slept well, and up betimes. To the orfice, and thence to break
fast, tinding myself very huugry, and did eat a waffle with much pleasure,
talhough there was an extra shot of soda in the last mouthful. To Brewery
Gulch for a shave, .and talked much with my barber about baseball, and he
told me that he.would bet again on Cincinnati, although the wise man had
thought differently. Did see Judge English, who shouted for the Cinci's,
too, having won with them, the day before, when he talked much about them
and his own judgment. Fear he has gone broke today. To Mr. Lyman, the
geologist, who gave me some mining news for the paper, which I will save
for Sunday. Met Mr. Jacobson, who is a fine gentleman, who discoursed too
learnedly for me, although I found much pleasure in his company. Did get
.dry soon after my first drink of white, mule, for which I had looked for some
time. Feared at first of carbolic acid and strychnine, but after a taste and
finding none, did take a good swig, which warmed ine, but I have resolved
to take more only when there comes a guarantee with it. To Lowell, where
1 met Mr. Cox, and we talked long, and thence to Foster, the deputy sheriff,
who told me some mighty interesting stories. Also to Judge Winter. Back
to Bisbee, where I got some good fish to supper, and then to the office, where
I found the cashier had tonsilitis, which may postpone our billiard game on
Sunday. His assistant denied hotly that she had lost the engagement ring,
but Phe blushed mightily when she said it, so I think she has it hid away.
Worked through the night, and thence to bed, thankful that no letter came
from my wife, so that I will not haye to write until the new week.

Seems that all who are left to strike are the newspaper reporters and
the married women.

working efficiency, i. e., ability to cj
the maximum amount of work of the
highest order with a minimum waste
of effort.
There Is no doubt but that the kinu
and quantity of food which an indi
vidual consumes has much to do with
his working efficiency, and conse
quently it is a matter worthy of seri
ous consideration.
Enough coal is used in a steam en
gine so that there Is produced suffi
cient power to move a train of cars
at the desired rate of speed. So suf
ficient food should be used by tse
individual that enough energy is sup
plied to his body for its greatest use
fulness. Since foods furnish the body wrn
energy, the energy which the ' body
spends in doing its work is a measure
of the fuel food needed. This energy
measured in calories can be supplier
by a definite quantity of combustible
foods.
Scientists have done much experi
menting concerning the quantity or
food that Individuals require and have
concluded that factors may be taken
into consideration,, as season, s?ze,
shape, age and occupatioa and sex
'of the individual.
( Season affects the ' quantity, and
kind of foods taken. Less meat anu
fat is required in summer than in
winter. The amount of perspiratioi!
also Influences the quantity of food.
An individual worker who perspires
freely at his work requires as mucu
food as an outdoor worker doing the
same work without profuse perspira
tion. Relation of Weight, Size and Shape
to the Daily Energy Requirement.
General Rule The quantity of food
required increases with the size of
the individual, but not at the same
rate as body weight increases. Two
persons may be equal in weight yet
may be very different in height and
shape. A tall, slender person requires
more food than a short, fleshy one of
the same weight. For this reason
size and shape, rather than weigh:,
are found more accurate in comput-.
ing the daily food requirement.
Relation of Occupation to the Dairy
Requirement.
It is obvious that muscular exer
cise, even the slight, requires some
expenditure of energy. Even during
sleep and rest, energy is required to
carry on the functions of the body,
as beating of the heart, etc.- The
man who is doing hard, physical wor.
needs more food than the man who
sits quietly at his desk. Moreover,
one working actively out of doors
can take foods difficult of digestion
for the person of sedentary occupa
tion. The energy requirement for the
average man of severe muscular activ
ity, as excavating, and under this
head comes the miner, working un
derground is 4990 calories, or in rounu
numbers 5000 calories. If we con
sider the noon lunch as one-fourta
of the daily energy requirement n
would be 1248 calories.
The packed lunch for a mlne
should have high energy value
Enough protein, and should be appe
tizing both In preparatioa and pack
ing: of food. It should contain some
thing fresh, something fibrous, some-'
thing nutty, and something sweet.
Foods supplying energy are fats,
starches or carbonydrates, and meats.
As meat is an expensive source of en
ergy giving food, we can use that
just for the protein. We can also use
fish, eggs, cheese and milk for pro
tein foods.
. Protein foods build and repair tis
sue as well as give energy, and since
the miner is constantly tearing down
tissue, it is essential that the luncii
pail contain some protein.. However,
as the miner is expending a great
deal of energy it is necessary that
his lunch box contain a larger propoi
tion of energy giving foods than ot
tissue building foods.
" Remembering that the .". miner's
lunch should have something f rest,
we may put in fresh fruit,- as peaches,
apricots plums, tomatoes, ; oranges,
apples etc. ' '
In order to have something fibrous
or bulky v to assist the digestive 01
gans, we can put in '.celery,radishes,
cabbage, string beans, these to Be
placed in paper cartons.
, Energy giving foods as bread In
sandwiches," butter, with meat filling,
tona filling or cheese filling for , the
protein. . .
Something sweet can be supplied In
the form of cake or pie. Here we
CLISHJ uarc uivic
in the starch in the flour and sugar
in the cake. If more sweets are re-,
quired dried raisins, dates, Jigs, fig
paste, sweet chocolate and nuts can
be added.
Allowing 1250 calories for the min
er's lunch, we have:

THE BIS BEE DA I L Y REVIEW.
SATURDAY, OCTOBER 4, 1919'.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct 3. Much of the
nervousness and nnsettleiuent mani
fested by today's stock market was di
rectly traceable to many conflicting
rumors regarding President Wilson's
condition. Overnight advices from
Washington were responsible for gen
eral impression at the opening when
leading shares fell 1 to 5 points, al
though a brisk rally from lowest levels
immediately ensued.
The recovery was succeded by an
other and more violent selling move
ment which bore the marks of profes
sional pressure and carried many
stocks under initial declines.
In the later dealings trading slack
ened for a time,' irregular rallies being
again recorded on a moderate demand
for rails, but the improvement was
met by broader selling than at any
previous period, vminimum prices rul
ing at the weak close.
The course of the money market
was cot conducive to our confidence,
call loans opening at the familiar rate
of 6 per cent, but again amounting to
12 per cent in the final hour only to
close at the opening figure. Firmer
tendencies were .shown by time funds
of which the supply was small.
Sales were 1,275,000 shares.
Transactions' furnished the strong
features of the irregular bond market,
foreign issues being firm and Liberty
issues shading slightly. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $11,750,000. Old
United States bonds unchanged, on
call.
MONEY MARKET
NEW YORK, Oct. 3. Dun's tomor
row will say:
With the labor situation still se
riously disturbed in many paVts of the
country, . business is increasingly in
convenienced and its volume discloses
progressive shrinkage in certain quar
ters. Yet; progress is not wholly impeded
and from trades andeections outside
the immediate influence of industrial
t controversies come frequent reports of
a demand for goods beyond the ability
of sellers to satisfy The shortage of
supplies, aggravated by the restriction
of outputs, in more often a factor in
limiting transactions than any ques
tion of prices, and the extensive buy
ing of luxuries and the better classes
of merchandise is a feature comment
,ed upon in many dispatches.

THE WOOL MARKET
BOSTON, Oct. 3. The Commercial

THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK. Oct. S. Cotton closed
weak at a net loss of 102 to 110 points.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 3. Sudden develop
ment of competition from Argentina
had a decided bearish effect today on
the corn market and so too did uneasi
ness regarding President Wilson's
condition. Prices closed heavy, 2 to
41Jc net lower with December $1.23
to $1.2S and May $1.21 to $1.21.
Pats finished unchanged lc down
and provisions ranged from 20c de
cline to 37c advance. i
. Announcement of a break In corn
quotations in Argentina wnere holders
were said to be alarmed over the scan
tiness of exports to Europe gave the
corn market here a downward ten
dency from the outset. Later this ten
dency was greatly increased by word
that Argentina corn was being pur
chased at New York much below what
domestic corn either old or new could
be delivered for. The acknowledged
seriousness of the presidents' Illness
operated likewise as an evident de-J
pressing factor.
Oats followed corn down grade not
withstanding continued demand from
tho seaboard. f
Provisions scored some gains as a
result of higher quotations on hogs
and owir. gto talk of a decrease In ab
normal stocks of lard.

FATAL SHAFT
Assistant Chief Clerk of C. &
A. Co. Says Story of His
Marriage to Miss Evans
Circulated by Village Wag
Denying with all the fury of a bash
ful bachelor and blushing so profuse
ly that It could almost be seen by th
man on this end of the telephone, S.
W. Beddow, assistant chief clerk o
the 0. & A. Copper company, yesrei
day explained to a Review t eporter
that" his reported marriage to Miss
Evans, in El Paso, last week, was
without foundation and presumably
circulated by some wag with a pei
verted sense of humor. An article n
the Review, gathered from some on
on the street, stated that BedCov
was married to Miss Evans, also' or
the C & A. offices. As a result or
this fabrication Beddow has been
recipient of hundreds of - telephone
calls of congratulation and in many
instances personal friends have., v
ited his office with presents. :
"I wish the public to know tnuv
when I many it will not be an elope
ment, but promise to let , my f riena
know in plenty of time to i gather In
all the old shoes in the neighbot
hood," Beddow said. "If the person
who started the story had stopped w
think that the public display of i
young lady's name in connection wfth
a story that had absolutely no foun
dation might cause her embarrass
ment, I do not believe he would have
given it to the papers." ! "
' Beddow said he went to. El Paso
Sunday to visit his father, who wa
passing through on hia way. to tab
coast.

HELP ITIMS
The town of Corpus Christi, Texas,
has been viittd by one of the great
est catastrophes in the history of the
United States. More than 1000 men,
women and children are dead there.
Another 5000 are absolutely destitute.
Means of communication have been
destroyed.' Homes are wrecked. Food
scarce.
But, more than all this, the people
of Corpus Christi cannot help them
selves. They have appealed to the
hearts of the country to sympathize
with them and to help them lest the
toll of death and destruction be heav
ier than ti is already.
This appeal has come to Bisbee.
In every like circumstance, whether
the question has been asked by the
government or1 by individuals, the
Warren district has been first to re
spond. Bisbee has built a proud rec
ord. Can we allow it to be" lowered
now? Can this city, prosperous and
open-hearted the epitome of the
great spirit of the west afford to let
this appeal go unaided?
The people of this district have al
ready given an answer. Contributions
are being made. But they must come
in greater amounts, and they must
come quickly. Confident that Bisbee
will do its best, the Warren District
Commercial club, has made arrange
ments to receiveand forward money
in conjunction with the city govern
ment, and the local branch of the Red
Cross.
Send your donation to the club, in
the Copper Queen hotel building, ad
dressed to Thomas A. Egan, secre
tary who will be there to receive it
from 8 o'clock in the morning until
6 o'clock in the evening." The emer
gency is here. Every day counts.

Red Cross Notes
TIRANIA, Albania. (By Mail.)
Women preponderate in the Ameri
can Red Cross commission to Albania,
and the fact the Americans are win
ing to delegate important administra
tive and executive work to women -is
always a source of astonishment to'
the natives, for in Albania women
are generally regarded as little more
than chattels. They have small voice
even in household affairs, have no
rights in law, are permitted no free
dom or initiatives They are not al
lowed to travel, and seldom allowed
to speak to strangers. They do much
of the hard manual labor of the coun
tryside. ;
But the American women in the
Red Cross mission have discovered
that they are just as safe among the
rugged Albanian mountaineers as
among their own neighbors at home,
and the work they have done has un
doubtedly done something to raise
the position of their sex in the coun
try. Everywhere the American women
travel through the mountains they
find that the news of their coming
has gone before them. Despite the
fact that there are no telephones or
telegraphs, the news travels ahead
and the mountaineers often gather
at cross roads to how them the way,
and frequently are able to call them
by name as they welcome them.
American relief has arrived in Kisu
ineff, Russia, close on the heels of
the Rumanian troops, according to
word reaching the American Red
Cross.
During the disorder and confusion
that prevailed under the former gov
ernment there was wide starvation
and lack of otherv necessities of life,
but immediately upon request from
the' Rumanian government, the Red
Cross forwarded from Bucharest an
entire train load of relief supplies in
charge of Major Lionel D. Hargis, an
attorney of San Francisco, and Major
Charles E. Spratt, a New York banker.-
A relief distribution base was es
tabllshed at Bender, just below the
city on the Dnelster.
The Dassaeeof the train was not
without incident, for revolutionists j
attempted to hold it up, desisting onlyj
when they caught sight of the Ameri-j
can flag that flew from the engine. I
Through division organizations of.
the American Red Cross, a series of
Red Cross "club days" are to be held;

The world knows of the sudden leap
to fame which a hitherto unknown
American girl accomplished last No

its kind the Metropolitan Opera

Ponselle became a prima donna so
prano. In one year she had gradu

exclusive realm of music. How Miss
Ponselle achieved her task, and the
ways in which she overcame obstacles
makes a fascinating tale. But beyonu
this her accomplishment may stand
as an example to other Americans
who are more and more coming to
take a commanding position in the
field of musical interpretation.
Starting in tomorrow's Review, the
story of Miss Ponselle will appear

statement, Mrs. Q. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three yean I suffered untold
agony with my bead. I was unable fb
do any of my wok.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
i was asleep. 1 became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with ny
head. -
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed.
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely . cured me of those awu)
headaches. That has been three yean
igo, and I know the cure Is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
taking CarduL . . . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your trouble made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
