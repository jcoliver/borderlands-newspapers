he is without information except in
press dispatches of his possible selec
tion for provisional president of Mex
ica, as a result of the Angeles-Villa
movement, Dr. Emilio Vasquez Gomez,
at his home here tonight declared he
had been working for the union of all
revolutionary forces In Mexico since
1916 and warmly approved the insurg
ent meeting scheduled for tomorrow
at the camp of General Carrera, an
nounced in an Associated Press dis
patch from Juarez.
Dr. Gomez declined to say whether
he would accept the candidacy if it
should be tendered him. "What Mexico
needs," he said, "is a leadership of
Ideas, not a leadership simply of
men." " '
DOUGLAS, May 30. Though hope
ful that at the last moment the state
department of the United States will
relent its attitude and allow passage
of Mexican troops from Nogales, So--noii,
to CaiJad Jsarez. ' Chihuahua,
Agua Prieta military and civil officials
have begun to prepare for reception
of the forces now concentrating south
of Nogales. According to the under
standing of the Agua Prieta officials,
the soldiers now held aboard their
trains a short distance south of . No
gales, will not remain quiescent more
than 24 hours, at the utmost. If, at
the end of that time the necessary
permission is not forthcoming for
passage through the United States,
the trains will go by way of the Can
anea branch of the Southern Pacific
de Mexico railroad to Naco, from
where they will march across the ln-j
tervening 24 miles to Agua irieta.
There the final arrangements would
be made for departure overland to
Chihuahua.
Two routes He open for use of the
column should it march overland, on
along the Arizona, New Mexico border
and through San Luis pass and from
there along the New Mexico-Texas
border to Juarez. The other and
more probable route is down the Bate-
pito valley, past Colonia Morelos and ,
tnrouen ruipito pass mio uninuanua.
This was the route used by Villa in
1915, when he invaded Sonora and is
said to offer fewer difficulties to
movement of men and munitions than
the more northerly one. The Mexico
Northwestern railroad could be used
to transport the troops from Pearson
to Juarez, once the mountain range is
crossed. v
The troops from Nogales are expect
ed to arrive in Agua Prieta Sunday
afternoon in the event of the refusal
of the state department not being
withdrawn by early tomorrow, It was
said. The start for Chihuahua would
be made as soon as the concentration
of men, munitions and transport could
be effected, which probably would re
quire not less than one week.
ARIZONA PERMISSION STANDS
PHOENIX, May 30. R. B. McGillen,
acting governor of Arizona, in the ab

So States Wilson In Speech
At Graves of American
Heroes In France
WASHINGTON, May 30. President
Wilson, in an address today at the
graves of the American dead at Sures
nes cemetery, near Paris, said the
league of nations was the covenant of
governments that the millions ho
fell In the great war shall not have
died in vain and added that he looked
for the time when every man who
now opposes the league would be just
as ashamed of it as if he now regret
ted the union of the states after the
Civil war.
Declaring that the standards of an
older era are trying to assert them
selves again, the president said those
who sought to accomplish the return
to "an order of which we are asham
ed" must realize that they cannot suc
ceed because "the peoples of the world
are in the saddle" and "private coun
sels of statesmen cannot now and
cannot hereafter determine the des
tinies of the nations."
After paying tribute to the Ameri
can dead, the president declared it
would be no profit to eulogize the
brave men who fell in the war unless
the lessons they taught were taken to
heart. The American soldiers, he said,
did not cross the seas merely to de

Carranza Warned By U.S.
Year Ago of Present Mess
WASHINGTON, May 30. Although
the Carranza government of Mexico
was warned nearly a year ago by the
United States of preparations for the
present revolutionary campaign which
has resulted In. the proclaiming of
General Felipe Angeles provisional
president and Francisco Villa secre
tary of war, little attention was paid
to information given by this country.
Specific warning of the threatened
menace to his power were' given Pres
dent Carranza by the United States
last October 15 and again last Novem
ber 27, it was learned authoritatively
today. President Carranza was re
minded on these and other occasions
particularly of his duty to protect
Americans and American property in
Mexico.
Villa began the collection of arms,
ammunitions and money a year ago
for the campaign which in the opinion
of officials here now has , grown to
constitute the gravest mc-nace to Car
rauza's power since Villa was defeat
ed by the government forces three
years ago. Last winter, it is said.
Villa notified his followers to plant
their crops early as the campaign
consul general said, had already
reached Santa Rosalia and would pro
ceed to Chihuahua City as soon as the
railroad could be repaired. He also
denied reports of disaffection in the
Juarez garrison which, he said, con
sisted of 2500 well disciplined soldiers
all of whom were receiving "their pay
regularly and a month in advance.
This latter statement was in reply to
reports that soldiers brought from
Casas Grande Thursday had niutyied
on account of not receiving their, pay.
No trains arrived or departed from
Juarez today, but military officials
declined to confirm persistent reports
lhat Moctezuma and Villa Ahumada,
evacuated by the federals several days
ago, had been occupied by the rebels.

WASHINGTON, May 30. Villa's

PROTECTION OF ALL
U. S. PROPERTIES IS
PLEDGEDBY MEXICO
WASHINGTON. May 30.-The Mex
ican governnrent has assured the
United States that no law enacted by
the Mexican congress in connection
with" the petroleum code would hae a
retroactive effect, it was learned from
official sources today, and the state
department has been advised that the
new oir law will not" nationalize oil
properties acquired by Americans
prior to May 1, 1917.
Charles A. Douglas, legal advise of
the Mexican government and the Mex
ican embassy here, today said these
assurances had been given in good
faith, and there was no question that
tLev w uld be carried out.
Mr. Douglas said the same protec
tion would apply to all other foreign
investments in Mexico.
' Officials here believe if these as
surances are carried out the most se
rious cause of trouble between the
two countries will have been elimi
nated. It was also said if Mexico
gave guarantees that she would com
ply with the international obligations
she might be invited to become a
member of the league of nations.

would begin as "soon as the grass was
green to insure forage for their horses.
Unusual activity was displayed
throughout northern Mexico by the
Villistas in getting , their crops Into
the ground to provide against famine.
All this was learned by agents of the
United States and formed the basis
for the warnings sent to Carranza.
Just why Carranza paid little heed
to this warning or was unable to di
vert any military forces from other
parts of the campaign in the north is
ja mystery to officials here. In the
opinion of some the same extra ex
pense : of such an undertaking may
have deterred him, remembering that
the campaign of Huerta cost the Mex
ican government approximately 60,
000,000 pesos. The total revenue from
all sources for the first four months
of this year, according to official fig
ures, was only about 29.000,000 pesos.
Six weeks ago Carranza had S0O0
men in Torreon with a large supply of
ammunition at Chihuahua. Officials
here are unable to understand why
he did not move these troops north
before Villa's men had been assembled
in a large force at any point.
scripts and as he needed their weap
ons, they were free to return to their
homes if they would fcive their word of
honor that they wduld not take up
arms, against him again. This infor
mation reached the federal troops and
accounts for the ease with which Villa
has defeated the federal troops
against him. 1
It was learned today that inquiries
have been made of the Mexican gov
ernment regarding a reported seizure
by Villa of a shipment of arms from
the United States designed for Carran
za. Information received here is that
Villa obtained one half of at least one
recent shipment on a Ulreat to attack
the Carranza agents and take all the
shipment. It also :is reported that
none of the recent shipments of arms
to the Mexican government authoriz
ed by this government have got? far
ther than Chihuahua, which is now
threatened by Villa.
Officials here had no official infor
mation today regarding reports that
an attempt jnigh t be made to send
Mexican federal troops through Ari
zona in bond to operate against Villa.

225 miles to Ferrol, Spain, where he
moored for the night, ready to get

General Obregon refused to discuss

and made the following statement:
"I have authorized no one to make

SKELETON OF
AUSTRIA PACT
IS PUBLISHED
Like Germany, Austria Shorn
Of All Rights And Powers
Outside Limits In. Europe
West Frontier Left Intact;
Document Remarkable For
Omissions; No Italy Clause
PARIS, May 30. (By the Associated
Press.) A summary of the skeleton
of the Austrian treaty submitted to
the smaller nations Thursday for ex
amination is remarkable chiefly for
its omissions and reservations. Sub
ject heading after subject heading is
followed either by a non-committal
display of blank paper, or by the state
ment: "This clause reserved."
This applies particularly to defini
tion of the southern frontier, the re
patriation clauses and the question of
Italian rights under the political
clauses.
The greater part of the summary,
in fact, is devoted to those clauses
which are practically identical with
the German treaty.
Protects Racial Minorities
The new clauses are chiefly those
dealing with frontiers, finance and the
internal affairs of the new Btates and
of Austria itself. Under the lattev
heading come the disputed provisos
for the protection ot racial, minorities
in the new states, against which it Is
understood the representatives of the
new states may address a protest to
the council of four aud also ask for
revisioa of the financial clauses, par
ticularly that part requiring the new
states to compensate Austria for pub
lic property.
Austria also is bound by the treaty
to respect the rights and privileges or
racial minorities in which little of her
ancient rights are left to her.
The treaty will consist of a pre
amble and 14 parts, the preamble and
section one' embodying the covenant
of the league of nations, as in the
treaty with Germany.
West Frontier Intact
Part two deals with frontiers. That
with Czecho-Slovakia follows practical
ly the old Bohemian frontier, although
with the reservation of a possibility
of making minor changes later, Au
stria retains on the west her old fron
tier with Switzerland, the question of
the union of Veralborg with Switzer
land having apparently been dropped,
despite the plebiscites already under
taken in that province and SwIer
land. The southern frontier is not de
termined in the treaty.
Part three contains political clauses,
including also some of the reserved
geographical provisos, and clauses es
tablishing mixed commissions to de
termine them later. The section re
ferring to Italy are all omitted. Others
deal with the future relations of Aus
tria with Czecho-Slovakia, Jugosla
via, Poland, Hungary and Russia.
Here are found the stipulations tor

We wish all gamblers and all people who believe ia luck and lucky
stones and hoodooes and mascots and Jinxes we wish they could all hear
Professor Frederick Starr lecture on "The Origin of Religions."
The professor is head man in the department cf anthropology or the
science of man as an animal, at the University of Chicago. He has
traveled all parts of the earth, spent years among the wild men and
wild women, and has been decorated by the government of France for
his service to the cause of human knowledge.
Crap shooters who think the number 7 important among sacred
numbers will find the professor has evidence that in old times it used
to be the least important. And so o n. Here is the professor's view of
"Sacred Numbers":
"Sacred numbers are believed to have magic power and are in
constant use in the worship of lower men. There are many sacred
numbers, but the five great ones are 2, 3, 4, 7, and 13.
"Many of you man think 7 is the greatest. It is the least important.
The rest are all more important.
"First, as to 2. We find it everywhere. It is fundamental to reli
gious thought. It is fundamental to the great philosophies of the world.
It symbolizes the fundamental idea of Oriental religion. It is the pres
ence of complementaries and opposites, always at the same time. You
cannot think of heat without thinking of cold; You cannot have a clear
idea cf heat without at the. same time having a clear idea of cold. You
cannot think ot good without thinking of bad; you cannot think of rich
without thinking of poor; you cannot think of life without thinking of
.death.
"Early mankind thought of things as active and passive, male and
female, light and darkness, good and bad, hot and cold, winter and sum
mer, day and night. The ancient Oriental circle, a design now used in
the advertisement of one of our big ra ilroais, has one side red and the
other side black. That circle divided by ?. curved line into two parts
black female, red male represents cr eation, the universe, the world, ev
erything. And as 'With the Orientals, so every American Indian reli
gious ceremony is based on sex.
"Three is a sacred number. Why? Lecause it exhausts the nat
ural possibilities of a subject when looked at from a certain point of
view. Every sacred number must do so. Three means totality and com
pleteness of living things. Three means all humanity. Every human be
ing is one of three things male, female, child. There is no other human
being except the male, the female, and the result.
"Four is the great sacred number among all people of the world, in
icultures. Why? There are four cardinal toints north, west, south,
east. Do rot say,. 'Oh, well, that is an accident.' It is no accident. There
have to be four. All the world over, black men, red men, brown men,
yellow men, white men, recognize the four cardinal points. American In
dians in some ceremonials, smoke the ir pipe north, east, south, west.
"As four is sacred, there are four wind3 from the cardinal points,
there are four quarters of the moon and four seasons of the year.
"Seven is usually thought of as pre-eminently the sacred number.
But it is the least important numbe r of the lot. I suspect it comes
from dividing the month and getting a seven-day week.
"The last of the sacred numbers is thirteen. Why. Because there
are 13 months in the year. People tell me there are 12 months in the
year but the science of astronomy knows that the number of months in
the year is thirteen. .
"Why is 13 unlucky amcng us? When people pass out of one reli
gion into another, the thing that used to be sacred and holy becomes un
holy. That is why 13 is unlucky with us. We passed out of a condition
where 13 was lucky and fortunate and s&cred and beautiful."
How to Handle
There i3 no reason why the hobo should return tc American life.
He disappeared with the war by going to work There is work for kim
today and there will be plenty more later on for there is going to be
a greater shortage cf labor than the country every knew before
But the panhandler is trying to come back to the panhandling. He
is in the streets of the cities and the towns. He is "riding the rattlers."
He has his hand out for money or anything he can get without labor.
In Camden, X. J., the mayor encountered three on his way to the
City Hall. When he got to hlsf office he summoned the chief of police.
They went out and rounded up the three and then the vagrants were
put to work. For twelve hours they had to labor cleaning the City Hall
from cellar to cupola. They got their rneais and a small amount of pay
but they had to work. When they had given the City Hall the best
cleaning it ever had received they wore tcld to go.
They crossed the Delaware in a hurry.
And more that show up will be put to work cleaning public build
ings but Bomehow Camden is panhandlerless since the word went out
by grapevine telegraph of how the hobo is treated.
The World Will Come to Know You
A crowd of young people went to the country in search of spring
flowers. They found a field filled with blossoms of all kinds. Blocnis
that reared their hea'ds high above the other plants and shouted at the
jpjekers tf include them in their boquets.
But. tne boys and girls went right by the mere aggressive plants and
searched under the bushes and briers to find the modest, sweet scented
violets.
Honors do not always go t3 the most pronounced personalities. They
may gain attention for a time because cf their striking appearance, but a
weary world will turn, sooner or later, to the more quiet type of man or
woman with the sweet scent of understanding.
One of the mysteries of life is' the accuracy and promptness with
which the world arrives at the true make-up of man, beast, flowers or
vegetables.
You can be pretty sure that you
what you are.
Regardless of what courts may say, we can abolish child lauor when
ever we want to. save our children as badly as we wanted to kill Iluns.
The world has come a long way when a Democratic President sug
gests to a Republican Congress the advisability of a protective tariff on
dyes and chemicals.
Our income tax will never be as burdensome as Germany's outgo
tax.
The excess profits tax is here to stay, but the manufacturer should
worry. He cau slip it out of the pockets of the consumer.
What doth it profit a country to k dry if it doesn't restrict the sale
of patent medicines that are good fcriothing except t-j cure the habit
of staying sober?

PERMIT SYSTEM TO
HANDLE SHIPPING OF
RECORD GRAIN CROP
WASHINGTON, May 30. Plans ofr
the inauguration of a permit system
to control the movement of this year's
mammoth grain crop just announced
by the railroad administration,
contemplate the appointment of grain
control committees at each primary
market, comprised of a repiesentativo
of both the operating and traffic de
partments of the railroad administra
tion and a third party representing
the transpartation division of the
United States grain corporation.
Shippers will apply through the
railroad agent at the point of origin,
to the grain control committee at the
market to which they wish to send
their product. If conditions permit,
permission for the shipment will be
given promptly. Otherwise the ship
ment will be delayed until storage
lacilities are such that the grain can
be moved without causing freight con
gestion. A ctfpy of the permit which will be
issued will be transmitted by the grain
control committee to the railroad by
which the shipment is to be made sc
that necessary action may be taken
to furnish cars. The system is simi
lar to that which was used in clearing
freight congestion last year.
"It will be readily appreciated," a
statement by Director General Hines.
said, "that" not only producers and
shippers cf grain will be benefited by
this regulation, but the entire shipping
public will benelt, in that the cuan
r.els of commerce will be" kept free of
congestion, car detention laigely elim
inated and the maximum use of all
equipment more highly developed."
Good weather and decreasing busi
ness due to the cessation of shipment
of war supplies have tended to build
up a large car surplus, which will be
mobilized in the grain belt by the
lailroad administration ss fast as
neede. It is expected that the move
ment of the new crop will be limited
rather by storage, facilities than by
railroad equipment.

MERCANTILE MARINE
COMPANY FORMED BY
MORGAN TO DISSOLVE
NEW YORK, May 30. The interna
tional mercantile marine company, the
great shipping combine organized by
the late J. P. Morgan, will be dissolved
if the stockholders at their meeting
next mouth approve the proposal to
sell to a British syndicate the British
owned ships and assets of the corpora
tion. It is then prcDcsed to distribute
all the assets of the International Mer
cantile Marine among the stockhold
ers. At a special meeting ol the directors
of the Mercantile Marine company the
following resolutions were adopted:
adopted:
"That it is the sense of the board
that in case the proposed sale of the
British assets should be approved by
the stockholders and the sale carried
out the International Mercantile Ma
rine company should be dissolved and
its assets distributed among stock
holders. "That such distribution should be
effected by a distribution in kind of
the stock and share lien certificates of
the International Navigation company,
limited (which represents the British
assets) and by a sale of the American
assets and a distribution of the pro
ceeds thereof."
That the stockholders, who will hold
a special meeting June 16, . will ap
prove the sale is considered a fore
gone conclusion. The liquidation of
the company will involve the payment
ot about $39,000,000 in outstanding 6
per cent bonds of the company due in
1941 but subject to call at an earlier
date. After the sale of the British
tonnage, approximating 750,000 tons,
for which about $125,000,000 will be
paid, the company will have left to dis
pose of six liners operated by the
American line, two under the British
flag and three of the Atlantic Trans
port company, an American corpora
tion. . !
P. A. S. Franklin, president of . the
company, refused to discuss the ques
tion as to whether a purchaesr has
been found for these ships, or as to
whether it was proposed to organize a
new company with these ships as a
nucleus.
From time to time there have been
repdrtB that the American interests is
the International Mercantile Marine
and other strong American interests
contemplate creation of a great ship
ping concern to trade throughout the
world, exclusively under the American
flag.
The International Mercantile Ma
rine company was organized in 1902.

"The Man of Might" is the fitting

Lewis, McKinistry, Ourfee, Fiske,
Connor, Edwards, Startord, Nolan and

In a speech at the ringside General
Pershing said in part:
"If we are to judge the athletics of
the American Expeditionary Forces by
what we have seen here this evening
we must come to the conclusion that
they are of a high order.
"The fairness and cleanliness of
these bouts is something of which we
should all be very proud. The result
of this type of athletics is sure to
create a higher tone in athletics at

carry back home a better notion of
what clean sport should be."

I of "The Man of Might." Perhaps the
j most interesting of these is Fremont's
j Pass, through which General Fremont
passed with his soldiers on his his
toric invasion of Red Man's Land.
Local Color a Feature
The Arizona desert and the canyons
that lie to the north are utilized as
scenic backgrounds for the intensely
exciting action of the play. Mexico
has been invaded for some of the
scenes, and a trip into the Yukon
country was necessitated in one in
stance to procure the snowy landscape
indicated in the plot of one of the epi
sodes. As an example of the detail in
volved, a trip to San Francisco might
be singled out. The hero of the serial,
in course of his adventures, lands in
San Francisco and happens into China
town. To have obviously placed the
camera snap these scenes mirroring
local color would have taken the real
ism out of them. The natives of the
colony had to be caught off-hand, whol
ly unconscious of the camera's pres
ence. Therefore, William Duncan, who
is his own director as well, carefully
had the camera and cameraman con
cealed, and marvelously characteristic
views were obtained as a result.

BY O. B. JOYFUL
THE HOUSING problem worries
everybody but the moving man. It
keeps him too busy to worry.
WHITE HOUSING problems worry
politicians at Washington.
THE OLDEST house now standing
Is an adobe structure, put up, in 1540,
near Sante Fe, New Mexico.
THE MOVING VAN was never In
vented for J. T. Newman, who has
lived in the same house in Lakewood,
O., 59 years.
ON THE ISLE of Man they have
a House of Keys.
AND IN ENGLAND the House of
Commons is the ace of the deck, and
the House of Lords is the deuce.
Most Famous of All House
"THIS IS the House that Jack built."
(etc., etc., until you come to)
"THIS IS the priest all shaven and
shorn that married the man all tat
tered and torn that kissed the maid
en all forlorn that milked the cow
with the crumpled horn that tossed
the dog that worried the cat that
killed the rat that ate the malt that
lay in the house that Jack built."
' -HOUSES," remarked Victor Hugo,
"are like the human beings that in
habit them." But is the two-family
like the folks up-stairs or down?
AND COKE once told us that, "The
house of every one is to him as his
castle and fortress." But that won't
be true in the search end seizure days
after July 1.
OLD CICERO THOUGHT, "The
owner should be an ornament to the
house." Nowadays he's the lawn
mower, furnace tender, and beats rugs
in the backyard while the ornament
sits on the front porch explaining the
details of her new summer bonnet Jo
the ornament next door.
SOUTHEY had the right Idea: "A
house is never perfectly furnished for
enjoyment unless there is a child in
it."
THIS MAY BE encouraging to those
who are thinking of moving because
the landlord raised the rent: Ninety
nine per cent of all buildings in the
world are houses.
THE CAVE MAN never paid rent,
taxes or plumbers bills, and he whit
tled his furniture out of the moun
tainside.
The Eskimo
Lives in a house of ice;
But he's warmer, at that,
.Than the bird who dwells
With a janitor who swells
With pride
At saving the landlord's coal.
Another Housing Problem
"For the past decade," declared the
grouch, "women have been neglecting
the heme more or less."
"Well," said the woman, "if we keep
that up about COO years, well be about
square with the men, won't we?"
After considering awhile he did not
attempt to refute her statement.
Louisville Courier-Journal.
IS IT because some houses are man
sions that there are poor-houses?
American diplomacy is Colonel
Housing in Paris.
DO YOU REMEMBER the good old
days when we use to clutter up the
backyard with a dog house, a chicken
house, a smoke house, a wood house
and a doezn bird houses? Those were
the housey times. .
100 RUM STILLS ARE
SEIZED III SAN JUAII
BUT TRAFFIC GOES ON
SAN JUAN, Porto Rico. May 30.
Moonshiners multiply daily in Porto
: Rico.
- Nearly 100 stills have been raided
by the police.
Making contraband rum Is easy and
cheap, and the profit is great
All that's needed is a rude still and
a supply of molasses, always plenti
ful. The rum hounds will pay from $2
to $3 for a small bottle of the stuff.
So the -isk of a fine of from $25
to $100 is no : barrier to the native
who would gather quick and easy
money.
While the San Juan police chief
was preparing a list of 33 stills that
had been seized since the first of the
year, reports came in of the seizure
of as many more.
From the arrests made in the 35
seizures there have been nine con
victims and a total of $675 assessed
in fines. But two Jail sentences have
been passed, one 30 days and one
three months. There have been two
acquittals and the remainder of the
casen have not been heard yet.

WILL PUT SEAPLANE
IN NATIONAL MUSEUM
N. E. A. Washington Bureau, 1127
1134 Munsey Building.
WASHINGTON, D. C TWe NC-4,
the first airplane to cross the Atlantic,
probably will be deposite'd in the
Smithsonian Institution for perma
nent exhibition a3 one of the nation's
most historic relics.
It will be placed in the National
Museum and take its place beside
the first heavier-than-air flying ma
chine ever flown in this country, the
first steam locomotive, the first cotton
gin, the first typewriter and other
famous "firsts."
Already the National Museum has
a sizable airplane exhibition. Includ
ed in it is the steam flying machine,
which, on May 6, 1896, at Quantico,
Va., made the first successful flight
ever made by a heavier-than-air fly
ing machine.
This machine weighs only 26
pounds. On its first flight it ascend
ed to a height of 70 feet and traveled
for half a mile at a rate of 25 miles
an hour.
Also there are the three small ex
perimental machines designed by
Samuel Pierpont Langley, which flew
over the Potomac river without an
operator, and the original Langley
machine built at the request of Pres
ident McKinley, which fell into the
Potomac owning to defective launch
ing mechanism.
Next is shown the original Wright
airplane which was the first machine
purchased and put into practical use
by the army in 1909. A sample of
the Curtiss JN4, now used on all U
S. flying fields for the instruction of
aviators, is hung" alongside it to show
the development in military avia'icn
in ten years.
The Handley-Page battle plane
first completed in this country is the'
most recent audition to this repre
sentative collection. It is fitted with
Liberty motors, and to give ths public
a closer view of the famous ain.'.ane
engine, one of them is exhibited in
a glass case.
For purposes of comparison two
French airplanes a Voison r.ieht
bomber and a Caudron reconnoitering
machine are included in the exhibit.

HUNTER SAVED FROM
YUKON BEAR BY DOG
DAWSON, May 30. Bob Levac has
had an escape from a grizzly bear that
all the Yukon country is talking
about." Levac came around the cor
ner of a cabin and met bruin face to
face without time to shoot. The bear
reached out and keeled the 180-pound
Levac over with one blow of his paw.
Levac played, possum and bruin maul
ed him about, rolled him over and
over in the snow, nipped him with his
teeth and then picked him up by the
clothing and shook him like a rat.
All this time Levac feigned death.
Levac's dog watching his chance, slip
ped in and snapped at the heels of
the bear until it turned and gave
chase. Then Levac sneaked away to
safety, but the dog was killed. Le
vac had to travel 20 miles by dog
team to Mayo to have his injuries
dressed.

Regardless of the apparent shortage
in the quota local Elks have r.ot lo,
