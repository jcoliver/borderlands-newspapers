LONDON. May 6. Count Czernin,
then Austro-Hungarian foreign min
ister paid a secret visit to Jassy in
the latter part of February and deliv
ered in person a verbal ultimatum of
the most drastic sort from the Cen
tral Powers to King Ferdinand of Ru
mania, iihas become known, with the
arrival here' of the American Red
Cross mission to Rumania
Count Czernin's visit was known
only in the highest officials circles
and the fact that it was made is re
vealed now for the first time throtign
a correspondent of The Associated
Press who accompanied the mission.
The reason for the visit was that
the Germans and Austrians had de
termined to brinar to. a speedy conclu
sion the negotiations with Rumania
an dhad decided that, a threat de
livered in person by the head of the
Austro-Hungarian foreign office would
be more effective than reams of doc
uments. Threatened King
So Court Czernin was sent on th-3
errand. He arrived in Jassy about
February 25 and went straight to the
king. His manner w-as stern, unbend
ing, ruthless. He tol dthe king blunt
ly that Rumania must conclude peace
on Germany's terms and do it immedi
ately. . There must be no further de
lay and unless Rumania consented to
thi sprogram the Central Powers pur
posed issuing a ukase deposing the
Rumania royal house and dividing the
entire country between Austria and
Bulgaria.
The Rumanian king saw no way out
and a week later the formal peaco
negotiations were begun.

THREE
COUNTY PILES UP
GIGANTIC PLEDGE
TO LIBERTY LOAN
Figures compiled and Issued late
yesterday afternoon by J. N. Gaines,
county chairman, indicated that Co
chise county had gone over the top in
the third Liberty loan campaign by
almost $1,000,000. The estimated total
of the chairman as of the close of re
ports last night was at least $2,250,000.
The final figures by communities and
cities will be available before Thurs
day it is believed.
Bisbee and the Warren district yesterday-had
subscribed for $1,220,000
In bonds of the third issue, with re
ports only partially complete. No
estimate of the possible total of the
district or of the number of subscrib
ers could be made from figures at
hand, but it is certain that a large
turn yet remains to oe recorded and
reported.
Douglas with 2,428 subscribers, re
ported yesterday to Mr. Gaines that
the total for the smelter city was
$886,800. almost two times the alloted
subscriptions of the city. These fig
ures are final and complete.
Figures of subscriptions for the
northern end of the county are not yet
available. However, Judge Alfred C.
Lockwood, of Tombstone, in charge of
the campaign for the district, reported
yesterday that every community in his
"division had oversubscribed its allot
ment, He estimated that in his pait
of the county at least $150,000 had
been raised.
Reports yesterday indicated that
every city, town, hamlet and commun
ity in the county had oversubscrited
its quota. Mr. Gaines declared that in
his belief his final report will be one
of the most optimistic ever made to
the Dallas bank under which this dis
trict works. Every division of the
county, together with the allotment
and amount subscribed to the bonds,
will be published in The Review as
oon as Mr. Gaines can compile fig
ures. Later a corrected and supple
mental list of subscribers will be pub
lished in which former lists will be
brought up to date and purchasers
subsequent to May 1 will be included.

STORY OF NUMBER 40
40 ysars ago an old doctor was put
ting up a medicine for diseases of the
blood, that cured the worst cases of
specific blood poison, and time proved
that tho cures were permanent. After
many years I secured the perscription
(being a druggist), and took each in
gredient separately and referred to my
U. S. Dispensatory and other books on
medicine and found the medical prop
erties set down as follows: "Employed
in disease? of the glandular system, in
blood poUon, scrofula, constipation,
stomach and liver troubles, chronic
rheumatism, catarrh, in sores, ulcers,
ski iv eruptions, mercurial and lead
poisoning. Under its use nodes, tu
mors and scrofulous swellings that
have withstood all other treatment
disappear as if by magic.' To com
memorate my fortieth year as a drug
cist I named this medicine Number 41

Patriotism in Arizona j
e
Folks return from trps east and tell
their western friends that they do not know
the nation is at war. According to the
tales of these travelers the east rings with
war preparations and seethes with the
works and movements of war. Maybe so.
We have no powder, factories or training .
camps or shipyards out . here in Arizona,
but even the most casual observer who
travels in these parts cannot help but be im
pressed by the patriotism of the state at
large. Since that German drive began on
the twenty-first day of last March, and the
allied line reeled back before LaFere and
bent back in many other places to the peril
ous edse of disaster, Arizona has hitched
her belt in at least three notches and her
eyes are set in the sun's glare until they are
pinpoints, and she is taking the war seri
ously. The Liberty Bond campaign, just closed,
proves in most spectacular fashion that the
state is awake to the needs and the serious
ness of the war. A diffeient feeling pre
vailed during their third bond campaign
from that which held in the former two
loan drives. The workers did not say
"Please." They said "You must!"
German sympathy talk and propagan
da have been reported more or less over
the county ever since the war started, and
not much attention was paid to it. But it
is different now. It is worth a man's lib
erty at least to talk disloyalty in this camp
these days. Arizona is after the slackers
and pacifists and agitators and German
sympathizers and she is in grim earnest.
The spirit of the state shines bright and
fine. The patriot is to the front and the
wobblies are in their holes.
From every section of the state it is the
same. They had a Liberty Bond parade in
Phoenix Saturday night that was a hummer
and a whale. From Pima comes the glori
ous news of the bond sale. Me3a made a
magnifient showing. In the columns of
every newspaper of the state is reflected
the new vim and purpose and patriotism of
the citizens of that community.
We have no gun factories or shell
plants, it is true, nor trocps swinging down
the gangplank to the transport while the
bands play. But we have the copper mines
that are just as vital as any of these, and
they are going full blast. And we have
the spirit and the fire and the resolution to
back President Wilson's Force policy to the
everlasting limit.
Fayolle
A new hero, or rather military genius,
has arisen from the red gleam of the west
ern battle front, Gen. Fayolle, the French
chieftain who stepped the breach left by
the Fifth British Army when it reeled back
and shifted to the northward, allowing the
Germans to advance that deep wedge in
the allied lines east of LaFere. In fact, the
experts declare that Gen. Fayolle's strate
gy and daring in Picardy ranks with the ex
ploit of Gen. Foch in the battle of the
Marne. It is not yet known just what hap
pened to that British Fifth Army before
LaFere. At the end of the second day's
offensive Gen. Haig reported he was hold
ing everywhere in the second lines. The
Prussian waj stopped after making only
moderate gains. Then came the disaster
before LaFere. The Fifth Army crumpled
up and, worst of all, pivoted to the north,
leaving a fatal gap between the French and
British forces. The Germans were quick
to take advantage of this opening, and
brought forward division after division and
threw them into this gap.
Nine miles did they gain unchecked.
Disaster for the entire allied armies loomed
in the foreground of the fourth day of the
German drive. It was then that Gen.
Gough, commander of the Fifth British
Army, was relieved by Gen. Fayolle, the
Frenchman, and right hand to Gen. Foch.
Fayolle performed miracles in the first
few hours after taking over the stricken
field. With a few French divisions he
checked the German rush and then rallied
the broken Fifth British Army and linked
a resistance across that field that will be
sung of in France and England for a thou
sand years.
And he is holding them still. He saved
Amiens and has kept the foe hemmed into
that costly elbow salient rormed by Mont
didier and Noyon.
Like Napoleon and Foch, this new hero
is an artilleryman and a master of strategy,
and, like these same twofamous French
artillerists, Fayolle fits' brilliantly into the
panoply of war. He has the elan the sol
diers love. He has the dash and daring
that the world at large loves in its military
heroes. Fayolle commanded a division at
the beginning of the war and has seen hard
service and served with distinction in the
hardest fighting on the western front for
over three 3'ears. He took a part in the
Somme offensive, and prior to that com
manded a corps in the first battles around
Arras. He was sent to Italy in command
of the allied forces that went to help hold
the Piave line. In fact, he had only re
turned from the Italian front a few days
when the German drive began. Well it
was for the allies that they had a Fayolle
in Picardy, even as they had a Foch at the
Marne.
It is believed that when Foch launches
his counter stroke that Fayolle will lead it
against the Hunnish front.
OUR BOLSHEVIKI
(New York Times)
The full Senate Judiciary Committee
will today consider Senator Walsh's bill,
approved by the sub-committee, for the
benefit of American Bolsheviki and an
archists of the I. W. W. order, or 'disorder.
The bill declares unlawful:
Any association, one of whose purposes
or professed purposes is to bring about any
governmental, social, ndustrial, or econo
mic change within the United States,, by
the use, without authority of law, of force,
violence, or physical . injury to person or
property, or by threats of such injury, or
which teaches, advocates, advises, or de
fends the use, without authority of law,
of force, violence, or physical injury to per
son or property, or threats of such injury,
to accomplish such change, or for any oth
er purpose, and which, during any war in
which the United States is engaged shall,
by any means, prosecute or pursue such
purpose or professed purpose, or shall so
teach, advocate, advise, or defend.
. Ten years', imprisonment, a fine of
$5,000, is the punishment, not too austere,
for belonging to such organizations, circu
lating their propaganda matter, advocating
their doctrines. Montana and the West
generally know too well the I. W. W. ar
chitects pf revolution and assistants of
Germany. In the mines, the factories, the
lumber districts, the fruit orchards, the har- '
vest fields, their work of sabotage, of de-
struction, of blocking war preparations,
has been active and various. "We openly
declare ourselves determined opponents of
all nationalistic sectionalism or patriot
ism," says the I. W. W. platform, "and the
militarism preached and supported by our
enemy, the capitalistic class." "The I. W.
W.," says their organ, Solidarity, "is more
than a labor organization. It is a revolu
tionary union. Had we the power, we
would stop every train, ship, mine, and
mill, every food and- supply train, every
wheel of industry." Right and wrong are
not in their vocabulary. They seek revo
lution by violence, the overthrow of the
"capitalistic class," the "bourgeoisie," hat
ed of Trotzky and Lenine. They preach
their revolution to ignorant and dangerous
men. They prepare for it and illustrate it
by violence whenever they can. Wherever
there is trouble, a chajice for stirring up
further mischief and violence, the I. W. W.
emissaries flock.
Representative free government is noth
ing to them. "Representation in such gov
ernments," says one of their apostles, "has
no value to the proletariat, since it does
not care to trade or traffic with the other
classes, for whom it possesses only hatred
and contempt."
Down with the wage system, down with
parties, down with Governments, up with
a class ! That is the gospel of the I. W. W.
The fatal doctrines, the cowardly and
bloody practice of the Bolsheviki, have
ruined Russia. The congeners of those
traitors to freedom, the counterparts of
those unworking workers, are in the Unit
ed States, organized, busy, shameless. Is
the United States going to defend itself?

Welch has been acting as under-sheriff
ever since Mr. Wheeler was lirst
eclcted to the office in 1912. He has
the record of being one of the .best j

records of the office have been com
mented upon with favor by every state
examiner that has made an examina
tion of the office. Mr. Welch, before
going into the sheriff's office was the
manager of the Green Cattle com
pany's interests at Hereford for two
years and prior to that was in the em
ploy of the Copper Queen store at
Naco. He has hosts of friends through
out the county, who are more than
glad to learn of bis appointment.
Mr. Welch intends to keep the for
mer deputies of Mr. Wheeler so far as
possible, that is, the regular deputies
that are on the pay roll of the county.
To these officers he yesterday issued

CHICAGO, May 6. Ideal weather
and the bearish influence of peace
gossip made the value of corn today
average lower. Prices closed unset
tled at " net decline to ',4 advance,
with May 127 and July 147i to
14774. Oats finished 1 to 2'H down
an dprovisions off 15 cents 75 cents.
Until the last hour, pronounced
weakness formed the rule in corn.
Toward the end of the session, how
ever, authoritative denials of peace
reports were current and the market
rallied.
Oats showed h?ss rallying power ijSall
than corn. One of the reasons as Mohawk
the outlook that the government crop ' Nevada
on Wednesday would prove to be inly i;,itte
lavor of the bears.
In the provision market the weak
ness of grains more than offset the isi
ftuence of higher quotations on hogs.

Twenty-nine runs, 28 hits and 12
errors. Some game.
It was all of that, according to the
eye witnesses who remained through
the long ten innings of play which
required more than three hours to
play. Incidentally, the C. & A. won
16 to 13 from the J-B and the teams
were unable to get out of the extra
inning rut into which they have fallen.
Every game between these clubs has
gone more than nine frames.
As a pitcher, Johnson, third base
man of the J U club, is a dandy in
fielder. Bijohn, outfielder, hurled for
seven innings and handled the job in
first class shape. Thereafter he tired,
because unused to the strain of pro
pelling the pellet slabward, and in the
eighth was touched for two hits and
these mixed in with passes and errors
netted the C. A. three runs. Prior
to this Bijohn had given three runs,
no two in the same inning and most
of them partly due to errors.
Inning seven was a merry-go round
for the C. & A. and Morris, who
opened the inning at bat by flying
out to left field, ended it in the same
manner. Ten men batted and seven
tuns crossed the plate. This total of
tallies added to the six acquired pre
viously gave the C. & A. boys a tie,
according to the accounting and Bur
roughs adding machine corps called in
by the official scorer. Bijohn was re
lieved by Johnson in this frame and
was hit hard.
In the tenth the C. & A. continued
to prove to Johnson that he is not a
big league pitcher, scoring three runs
and winning the game as the J-B gam;
were unable to put a run over the
rubber.
Schellenbarger and Curley did the
slab work for the C. & A. and the
J.B gang certainly hammered tbem
hard enough to win any ball game with
a pitcher on the hill.
Fortunately for the league treasury,
the umpires were not paid by the
hour,
Wftlgomat, army catcher from Doug
las, handled the big glove for the J.-B
club and certainly did grand work tor
Manager Cal Earthman's team. He
will catch next Sunday when the J-B
and Queen clash.
Tomorrow afternoon the Copoer
Queen and C. & A. teams will battle.

Since the day of the caveman, who
liked his meat raw, civilization has
learned a lot about the scientific treat
ment of the things we eat.

can Tobacco Co.-r-that tobacco tastes
better TOASTED!
This wonderful new idea simple
like all great inventions was first
used in producing the famous LUCKY
STRIKE Cigarette made of toasted
Burlcy tobacco.
Burleyhas a mellow flavor, entirely
different from the tobacco usually

bacco and LUCKY STRIKE Cigarettes
taste like a pipe. '
