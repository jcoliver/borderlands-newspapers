man of the carpenters on the wage ad

disputes. Wm. L. Hutcheson, president
of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and

"How do I know?" was the answer.
'They struck last time and only re
turned to work in response to the
president's appeal in the belief that
the matter would be adjusted to their
satisfaction."
Hutcheson said there were 50.000
idle carpenters who could be put to
work building ships if the work was
"available. He indicated some of

Says we must keep feet dry;
avoid exposure and eat
less meat.
Stay off the damp ground, avoid ex-
I posure, keep feet dry. eat less meat
drink lots of water and above all take
j , spoonful of salts occasionally
to
1 keep down uric acid,
i Rheumatism is caused by poisonous
j toxin, called uric acid, which is
erated in the bowels and absorbed in-!
to the blood. It is the function of ti.e !
kidneys to filter this acid from the j
blood and cast it out in the urine. The
pores of the skin are also a means of
freeing the blood of thi3 impurity. In
damp and chilly, cold weather the
skin pores are closed, thus forcing the I
kidneys to do double work, they be- j
come weak and sluggish and fail to
eliminate this uric acid, which keeps i
accumulating and circulating through
the system, eventually settling in the j
joints and muscles, causing stif 'ness i
soreness and pain called rheumatism.
At the first twinge of rheumatism
get from any pharmacy about four
ounces of Jad Salts: put a !ab!esi.'Oiin
ful in a glass of water and drink be
fore breakfast each morning to- a!
week. This is said to eliminate u-ic !
acid by stimulating the kidneys t a nor-,
mal action, thus ridding the blood ofi
these impurities.
Jad Salts is inexpensive, harmless '
and is made from the acid of gnp .-s i

"Let Us Save-You Money."
The
U.-S. Food
Ad
ministration
says
AND IT ADDS:' "To save does not mean to
do without. Use vegetable fats instead
of lard and butter in your cooking."
THAT is the direct appeal of
your Government. It calls
for no sacrifice on your part.
No sacrifice of nutriment
because vegetable fats are rich,
wholesome and pure.
No sacrifice in economy be
cause vegetable fats cost less
than butter or lard.
The only change you are
asked to make is a slight change
in the way you cook the shorten
ing you use.
Fortunately, the country has
right at hand an abundant supply
of nutritious vegetable fats of
which Cottolene is a well-known
and dependable example.
The change from lard and
butter to vegetable fats is both
simple and patriotic. Cottolene
meets the needs of wholesome
cooking, the requirements of
economy, the wishes of the
Government.
And what is the reason for
. the Government requirements?
Simply. this:
"Pork, ham, bacon, lard, con
densed milk and butter can be
shipped in concentrated space"
to feed the under-nourished
women and children in stricken
countries to feed our own fight
ing men and the men of our Allies
who are fighting in our defense.
0 0 0
WITH these compelling facts
in mind is it not a clear duty
to put patriotism above cooking
" customs and use the nutritious,
economical vegetable fats which
nature has abundantly supplied?
Make your kitchen a patriotic
kitchen and remember as you
cook every ounce of vegetable
fat you use instead of lard and but
ter may mean saving the life of
someone somewhere in the world.

COPPER IN THE UNITED STATES.
This country is threatened with, not
only a curtailment in supply of copper, but
an actual famine in copper. Exportations
of metal to the allies during the past year
have incresed largely) of 1 ,800.000 pounds
of raw metal, last year 1,000,000 was
shipped abroad, 326,780,000 more pounds
than were exported in 1916. The3e fig
ures do not include products of copper,
which would make a large addition to the
total. Production in the past few months
has fallen off. Rich ore reserves have been
eaten into at the expense of low grade re
serves. Development and exploration has
been hampered if not altogether halted.
And small properties have been forced to
cease operations.
Now comes the first actual instance
wherein is cited a copper shortage in the
United States, and wherein i3 written the
first warning of an approaching famine,
in Los Angeles, copper wire has become
so scarce that the telephone companies
have been forced to substitute iron wirefor
short connections. The Los Angeles Times
reports the case as follows:
"Owing to the shortage of copper wire,
the Southern California Telephone Com
pany was granted permission yesterday by
the Board of Public Utilities to use iron
lines to buildings, including houses and
business structures."
Copper mines and their operators have
for several months past realized that this
condition would be inevitable. The low
price set by the government for their prod
uct has been cited frequently as the chief
contributing element to threatened short
age. Conditions arising frcm the present
fixed maximum price have forced on the
operator conditions which he ha3 been
powerless to overcome. Strive as he may,
he has been able to produce just so much
ore, just so much refined metal. Mean
time he has been forced to forego improve- .
men's and work which is absolutely neces
sary to the future of his mine.
In keeping copper production at its pres
ent level the operators have sacrificed more
than can be estimated. To understand this
sacrifice, however, it is necessary to know
that the supply of miners and qualified
workmen in the mines depends today on
the wage scale, and that the wage scale is
fixed according to the price of copper as
set by the government. Without higher
wage3 than are paid in other crafts the
mines cannot retain full forces of skilled
operatives. Without full forces, produc
tion suffers, development and exploration
is practically suspended, and rich ore re
serves are mined, while poorer rock, for
merly mixed with the rich, is practically
abandoned. The result is a sacrifice in the
future of the property, a deterioration of
reserve values, an unbalanced mining pro
gram, and a needless waste of much low
grade ore which otherwise might be
smelted.
Just such conditions have the mine
owners faced for the past eight months.
Higher wages have attracted their skilled
men to other crafts. Lack of operatives has
occasioned sacrifices of ore reserves, cur
tailment of development and exploration,
and neglect of low-grade rock. Meantime,
ore reserves have been drawn on so heavily
that they are becoming less productive.
And the result has been a gradual falling
off in production, until during the past
month a low record was attained.
It is natural that the western coast of
the United States first should feel the effect
of the shortage of copper. While the mincer
are in the west, the great refineries and
manufacturing plants are on the Atlantic
seaboard. But, as surely as the Southern
California Telephone Company has felt the
stringency, the remainder of the nation will
be affected if alleviation is not provided.
Mine operators and operatives are work
ing together for alleviation through their
agreement with the government to con
tinue the production of copper. When the
new maximum price is established this
summer relief shall have arrived. Higher
wages will result from a higher fixed price,
skilled operatives will return to the mines,
adequate forces will be available, develop
ment and exploration may be resumed on
a large scale and rich ore3 will not be sac
rificed to maintain a scale of production
whicfy will not only avert a famine, but
will supply the United States with copper
enough for use abroad in the war and for
home consumption.
.THE STOCKMAN'S STORY.
The stockman has a story, roo, in this
great time of war and national effort. His
story is one of struggle, of hard work, and
of shortage of employes. It is the same
story that the mines face; the same story
that all large enterprises must tell, and
must somehow solve. It is the story of men
gone to war, and ranges left without ex
perienced riders.
This year, the stockman's story is more
than ever a hard-luck story. From the
Pecos of Texas on the east to the Colorado
of Arizona on the west, through the south
ern belt of New Mexico and this state, the
ranges have been more or less poor for the
past eight months. In some districts cattle
have been sacrificed to save them from
death by starvation. Many have been
shipped to the markets in such condition
that they brought minimum prices. The
cattlemen have suffered heavy losses in
cash.
Now they are facing the spring round
up, and the spring branding season, with
out their own punchers and range men.
The draft has been responisble for this
the draft and the army. Cowboys, espe
cially the brand of this southwest country,
are not among the last to enlist when the
nation calls, and they have gone by the
hundreds of Uncle Sam's army. They have
left the stockmen with a shortage of em
ployes and with the problem of breaking
new men to the saddle, the range and the
country.
Large industries are solving their prob
lem. The mines will have made a long
stride toward a complete solution if this
summer the government shall set the price
of copper to permit an advance in wage.
Shipyards are findnig means for supplying
their demand for men. Munitions factories,
with the substitution of women, and other
large manufacturnig plants through - the
same means, are filling their vacancies.
The climax in the story fo the cattleman
will have been reached with the next draft
of men from the ranges. But now the
stockman's story is an absorbing mystery
and not even the cattlemen themselves can
foretell what will be the climax, ,or how
their problem will be worked out.
The government needs men and copper,
men and munitions, men and ships, men
and arms, men and grain, and men ana
cattle. One need is as great as the other,
and the solution of one problem will assist
toward the complete solving of each other
problem. Rains and snows have assuied
the stockman of his spring ranges, and the
ingenuity of the pioneer southwesterner
which aided him to build up of these plains
the greatest country ' under the sun, will
find a way to ride the ranges, brand the
calves, and cut out the culls from the herd.
MR. HENEY EXPLAINS.
No little wonder has been expressed over
the country at the trust-busting, muck
raking methods which the government has
permitted in the hearings pressed against
the Chicago meat-packers by Francis J.
Heney, the California sensationalist poli
tician. The solution has been found, how
ever, in Mr. Heney 's own avowals. A
Chicago newspaper explains his dramatic
performances through his own mouth as
follows :
"Francis J. Heney, special counsel for
the federated trade commission in its inves
tigation of the packing industry, in a for
mal statement, announced he would be
come a candidate for the nomination aj
governor of California."
Turkey, a small mining camp in the
Bradshaw mountains of Yavapai county,
has over-subscribed its quota of war sav
ings stamps. With ten residents the little
town has purchased more than two thou
sand dollars in baby liberty bor.ds. In so
doing it has leaped into nation wide fr.m
as the first to take out its eiitfre share cf
twenty dollars for each resldnt. Turkey
is just another reminder to thi world of
Arizona's responses to the national call. It
brings to mind the last and first liberty
loans when Arizona cities led the nation in
per capita subscription.

Diarmns disclosures
the CHINO VALLEY
H. M. JOHNSON. CHIEF DRILLER OF THE UNITED CHINO
OIL & REFINING COMPANY, DISCOVERS GAS BLOW OUTS
WHICH HE STATES POSITIVELY CAN ONLY BE CAUSED
FROM HEAVY GAS PRESSURE FROM BELOW. DEMON
STRATING. IN HIS OPINION, THE ACTUAL EXISTENCE OF
A LARGE OIL POOL IN THE CHINO VALLEY.
Driller H. M. Johnson, who arrived in the Chinor Valley field one week ago
to take charge of the drilling operations of the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFIN
ING COMPANY, is one of the most enthusiastic men who has ever been in the
field and there have been dozens of oil- experts there before him who have placed
their stamp of approval on the development of this Valley.
During this last week Driller Johnson, in company with the General Man
ager of the UNITED CHINO, made a thorough exploration of the property of
the UNITED CHINO and discovered two big gas blow-outs only a short distance
from where the standard drilling equipment of this company is set up ready to
start drilling, and gave as his opinion that not only would we bring in oil in the
CHINO VALLEY, but that he believed beyond any doubt that the CHINO VAL
LEY WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE GREATEST OIL PRODUCING DIS
TRICTS OF THE COUNTRY. .
These gas blow outs, which appear directly on the anticline so prominently
outlined in the geological reports of Dr. E. Ritter and Geologist Ronald Sager, are
connected by a crack in the anticline, this crack connecting the two blowouts
demonstrating, according to the theories of great oil men and geologists, that
THERE IS OIL BELOW IN LARGE QUANTITIES, and that it is not far below
the surface. Driller Johnson, in speaking of the indications, stated that in his
opinion we would get a flowing well at not more than 1 ,500 feet, because he did
not believe that any gas pressure could cause such prominent blow-out3 from a
depth much in excess of 1,500 feet.
What This Means to You and to Arizona
You MUST realize what this most recent indication in the CHINO VALLEY
means to you, provided you answer the knock of opportunity and get in on the
most popular company in the CHINO FIELD, THE UNITED CHINO OIL & RE
FINING COMPANY. And you must realize what it is going to mean to ARIZONA
when we bring in an oil field in the CHINO FIELD. Furthermore, do you not
appreciate the fact that this latest opinion by Driller Johnson, a man who is recog
nized as one of the great oil drillers of the West, means much in support of the
theories of eminent geologists who have examined the CHINO VALLEY and stated
that the indications were favorable? . f
UNITED CHINO OIL AT 3c NOW
Should appeal to you as the most logical buy 'in the Chino Valley field today, for
reasons almost too numerous to mention. For instance:
OUR WELL WILL BE DRILLED DIRECTLY ON THE ANTICLINE DE
SCRIBED IN THE REPORT OF THE EMINENT- FRENCH OIL GEOLOGIST,
DR. ETIENNE RITTER. 1
' IT IS ON THIS ANTICLINE AND BUT A FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM
OUR DRILLING RIG, THAT THE BIG GAS BLOW OUT WERE DISCOV
ERED BY DRILLER JOHNSON.
WE ARE NOT GOING TO MOVE THE RIG CLOSER TO THE BLOW
OUTS. BECAUSE MR. JOHNSON BELIEVES THAT IT WOULD BE DAN
GEROUS TO DO SO, AND STATES THAT HE WOULD NOT TAKE
CHANCES BY DRILLING TOO CLOSE TO THE GAS BLOW OUTS.
OUR PROPERTY, WHERE OUR COMPLETE STANDARD DRILLING
EQUIPMENT AND STANDARD 84-FOOT DERRICK IS NOW SET UP, IS
CONCEDED BY EMINENT OIL MEN TO BE THE BEST LOCATED
GROUND IN THE FIELD, AND WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE OLD EXPERI
ENCED Olb MEN WE HAVE IMPORTED FROM CALIFORNIA HAVE BE
COME SO ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES THAT THEY ARE
TAKING STOCK IN THE COMPANY FOR A LARGE PORTION OF THEIR
WAGES.
WE WILL' POSITIVELY START DRILLING OUR WELL NEXT SATUR
DAY, MARCH 9th, and we could start earlier, but we want to have everything
in fine shape so that there will be no delays-after starting want everything in
shape sr) that we can continually hammer away with three shifts, for 24 HOURS
EVERY DAY. .
There is marked activity in the Chino Valley, and numerous companies are
making rapid progress toward active development, but we positively believe the
UNITED CHINO WILL BE THE FIRST TO PROVE UP THE FIELD, BE
CAUSE OF THE MARKED SUPERIORITY OF OUR STANDARD EQUIP
MENT, AND THE FACT THAT WE WILL DRILL 24 HOURS DAILY.
The Chino Valley Certainly Looks Like It Is Going to
Mke Many People cf This Siate Independently Wealthy
The policy cf thi3 cdmpeny, since its organization, has been one of conserv
atism. We hate not made any promises that we have not kept we have only
promised to spend, the money intrusted .with us by you and your friends in a
straightforward, business-like manner and this we have done. This company has
just prepared and filed with the ARIZONA CORPORATION COMMISSION, a
financial repcrt that we believe to be of one of the best, if not, the best, ever filed
by a similar company operating in this state. That is all that we have promised.
BUT NOW, WITH THE RECENT DISCLOSURES MADE BY DRIli-ER
JOHNSON AND THE ENTHUSIASTIC WAY IN WHICH HE AND HIS ASSO
CIATES WHO ARE TO HELP HIM DRILL OUR FIRST WELL HAVE GONE
INTO THE PROPOSITION. WE ALMOST FEEL LIKE PROMISING THAT WE
WILL BRING IN OIL. IT LOOKS LIKE A WINNER, THERE IS NO QUES
TION ABOUT THAT. AND WE EARNESTLY BELIEVE, MORE FIRMLY
THAN EVER BEFORE, THAT IN LESS THAN SIX MONTHS TIME THE
UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING COMPANY WILL BRING IN OIL IN COM
MERCIAL QUANTITIES IN THE CHINO VLLEY.
Remember, We Start Drilling Saturday, March 9th
The time in which you can buy this stock at 3 cent3 down and 2 cents more
when oil is being produced in commercial quantities, is growing short very short.
When the drill starts we will be justified in raising the price and you certainly
owe it to yourself to GET IN ON THIS NOW, before you have to pay more for
it. TAKE ALL YOU CAN the main thing is to DO IT NOW THIS PAYDAY
at the present price. SEE OUR LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE, or write to th
office of the company direct. DO IT TCDAY FOR BIG OIL PROFITS.
