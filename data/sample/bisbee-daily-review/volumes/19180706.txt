IS EXPECTED TO EREAK
SHORTLY
WASHINGTON, July 5. In
creasing man power and rapidly
extending control of the air have
permitted the adoption of a new
policy by General Foch in the
opinion of observers here. They
believe the sequence of hard lo
cal blows struck recently by allied
troops shows a new phase is de
veloping which might expand into
a major operation.
Reports of the recent successful
strokes are taken to indicate that
General Foch no longer feels the
necessity of keeping on the de
fensive to conserve his forces. The. .
fact that the Germans have been
completely surprised is believed to
be due to the work of the air
men. American aid has served to
change the tide of the fighting.
The American attacks around
Chateau Thierry, the French op
erations at Soissons and the Brit
ish operations on the Somme and
in Flanders probably were prompt
ed by the fact that the weakness
of the enemy was at those point's.
It is assumed General Foch plans
to give the enemy no rest. Points of
vantage held by him which would be
ol value as the starting place for a
new major thrust, are being re
captured all along the line. The effect
is to embarrass German preparation:!
nnd officials believe the fact that any
of these local operations may sadden
"ly tend to keep German reserves scat
tered. The activity of the lillied forces put
a wholly new aspect on meeting the
forthcoming German effort. The pos
sibilities of feints at remote parts of
the line, to cover the development of
the real attack until it was well un
der way, are believed to be less prom
ising as it is the allies who are now
creating diversions.
It is regarded probable General Foch
will be able to form accurate esti
mates of the course and strength of
the blow before it is delivered.
One advantage of the Increasing
man power will be the possibility of
allied thrusts at other points along
the line, compelling the shitting of '
German reserves. It is believed Gen-1
eral Foch now is in a position to take
this means of slowing up the enemy
without impairing his own reserves. .

The British front east of Amiens on
each side of the Avre and along thC
Somme river, seems to be the storm
center of the France battle front.
Australians, assisted by American de
tachments, on July 4 drove the Ger
mans ot:t of Hamei and the Vaire end
Haniel Woods, to the south, at the
same time launching a secondary at
tack on the German positions north
of the Sr.mme. Since that time' the
lines before Amiens have been very
active.
The Germans have been repulsed in
an attempt to retake the village or1
Haiiul and the woodd positions so:itli.
The Hriti.sh official report says ths en-
emy was stopped easily, but the Ger-
mans claim to have checked the Hrit-j
Ish forces east of Kamel and to have
thrown them back to their oriaini'I
lines at Vil'.ers-Eretonneux.
With the exception of aerial com-j
bats, the American front has been j

where in two recent French attacks
the Germans suffered severe casual

ine the past day there has been heavy
artillery firing near Cutry and Mont

tpfian forces operating near the
mouth of the Piave. have continued to
make progress, taking mors than 400
prisoners as well as a battery of can
non and many machine guns. In the
mountain region, the Italians have ex
tended their lines north east of Monte
Grappa and have repulsed desperate
counter, atacks by the Austrians
against positions taken from the en
emv in the Italian drives a week ago.
Stockholm reports that Finland is

on his rifle he managed to pull the
trigger and a bullet went through the
nearest German who was about a doz

rise, parry the German's bayonet
thrust and bring the stock of his ride
down on his opponent's head. A
searching party found him lying there
with the two Germans beside him.

in turning over went away from the

boats available for rescue work were
so few that rescue work was proceed
ing very slowly. It Is believed that
nietween 400 and 500 were aboard th
steamer. Several P. & P. U. railroad
coaches have been sent to a point op
posite where the steamboat sank and
the rescued are being cared for in the
coaches as rapidly ast hey are brought
to shore.
BUT 100 RESCUED
T.LOOMINGTON, III., July 6 A
telephone report from Pekln at 1:40
this morning said that between 500
and 6'10 persons were on the Colum
bia when she sank and that at that
hour 100 had been rescued. The Co
lumbia was carrying an excurison
party from Pekin and was homeward
boitad when the accident happened.
Miss Pauline Bineuil, of Peking, who
was aboard the boat, told the follow
ing story of the disaster:
"The steamer had three decks. I
was on the upper one. On that below
dancing was going on. The bottom
deck was ocsupied principally by mer
w ho were talking and smoking.
"I do not believe many of the per
sons on the first two decks who con
stituted by far the larger portion cf
the crowd could have esccpoa.
"I was chatting with friends We
felt the boat rise out of the rivr. It
was clouded with fog. There was a
crach. For a moment no one moved
and then almost everybody rushed to
one 6ide of the boat. The crew and the
officers as soon as they .-ealizod what
was happening cried for the passen
gers to even the load but it was too
late. The Columbia tilted and theu sud
denly overturned. I was thrown into
the water.
"When I came to the surface people
were swimming about too dr.zed to
know what dierction to follow. The
mist hung low above the overturned
boat, from which came horrifying can
fusion of cries for aid.
"Those on the lower decks seem to
have been trapped.
"I swam about and then a man came
to my aid. A portion of the boat re
mained above the water. Three oth
er men were behaving like heroes.
"Some were holding women in their
arms and others were attempting to
keep their heads above the ater by
clinging to their clothing. The acci
dent occurred about opposite Wesley
City. The steamer had rammed an ob
struction near the east bank. It was
not long before the sound of the
screams for help attracted attention
on shore. Row boats began to ap
proach. "The rescuers began to pick up the
survivors. After a moment a boat
n eared me. A man who was support
ing me called to the rowers to take
me in. We rowed a distance it seem
ed about four blocks before we final
ly reached shore."
The steamer was in use in the regu
lar excursion trade along the river.
It was about 150 feet long and was
considered staunch. The boat reached
Alfresco park about 10 o'clock. The
excursionists spent about half an hour
there during which there was band
music and dancing. The crowd was
homeward bound when the crash
came.
As soon as the news reached I'eoria
relief parties were organized. Every
doctor in the city who could be sum
moned was directed to report to the
depot. A special train was made up
at once and rushed to the scene of the
disaster.
board the boat when it left Peoria on
the return trip to Pekin. The boat
ran into the peoria shore in a fog
that was prevailing. It backed away
and began sinking immediately, wate"
rushoing in through a large hole in
the bow. The boat instantly bean
sending out signals of distress and
several craft from this city rushed to
the scene of the tragedy. None of
these has yet returned.
Loss of life is said to have resulted
lareely from the p3nic that followed
on the boat as it began to sink. Doc
tors and nurses were rushed to the
Kccne from Peoria. Some of the sur
vivors have been taken to Pekin on a
relief train.

TRANSPORT IS
SENT DOWN BY
HUN TORPEDO
(Continued from Page One)
off in haste is borne out bi the fact
that the crew was transferred to a de
stroyer without incident. Some sui
prise was occasioned by the fact that
the submarine did not return and un
dertake to finish the sinking.
The Covington was the first Amer
ican transport to be sunk while in
convey, the former Hamburg-American
liner President Lincoln and the
former Morgan line Antilles, the only
other American transports sunk hav
ing been destroyed when returning
home without the protection of war
j craft. Few details were given in the
j navy department's announcement and
report that none of those from the
Covington who were landed at a
French port was "seriously injured."
Apparently some of them were hurt,
probably in being transferred to the
destroyer in a choppy sea but evident
ly Admiral Sims did not give the num
ber. "The torpedo struck just forward of
the engine-room bulkhead.' said the
nay department's announcement,
"and the engine rom and fire room
were rapidly flooded. With its motive
power gone the vessel was helpie-,s
ycdoing of another ship in tiie con
voy, the Covington was temporarily
pbandoned. This was done in excel
lent order and the officers and crew
were taken on board a destroyer. The
submarine was not seen. '
At day break the cfptaln, ssvorai
officers and a number 0' members of
the crew returned to supervise salv
age operations. Another vessel and
two tugs took the Covinstoj in tow in
the effort to get her to port, buis he
was too badly, damaged to keep afloat
and sank.
"Vessels have been searching for
the missing men and the navy depart
ment awaited the report of the names
of those missing, which was not re
ceived until today, before announcing
' (tin cirtlrlnn- rt f Vi n i-ncaa
There was no explanation by the
department as to whether the six men
were missing after the transfer of
the crew from the troop ship to the
dsstroyer or after the transport actu
ally went down. It was feared, how
ever, that they either were killed by
the force of the explosion or were
caught by the inrush of water into the
engine and fire rooms.
Circumstances surrounding the
sinking of the Covington evidently
were similar to those when the British
liner Tuscania was Bent down off the
north ccast of Ireland, while carrying
2200 American troops to England. The
vessel was with a fleet of ships con
voyed by destroyers.
and was attacked early in the night.
The submarine either laid in wait or
else stumbled upon the convoy accl-
dently.

PICKED ON THE WRONG MAN
German peace propaganda spread the
- word recently that George D. Herron, an
American in Switzerland, had listened to
peace terms from a German .agent and
would transmit them to America. They
picked on the wrong man this time, for as
soon as Herron heard of this lie he delivered
himself upon the subject of peace with Ger
many in words that burn to the heart and
light the soul gloriously as follows:
"So far as America is concerned, Ger
many had better keep her peace army at
home. The appeals of the peacemongers
will waken in us neither terror nor pity;
they will but fill us with deeper disgust,
if that be possible, causing us to dedicate
ourselves anew to ridding the world of
things German. The tiger that has eaten
the boy had better come entreating peace
from the boy's father, or the serpent that
has slain the glad maiden leaping along the
woodland path had better come crawling
for peace at the feet of the maiden's lover,
than that the Germany that now plunges
Europe into still more immedicable moral
and material misery' should come whining
for peace at America's doorsteps..
"Not from America will Germany re
ceive peace not if Germany has all Europe
in her hands ; not if America must fight for
a hundred years. Nor now, nor at any
time in the future, nor in the shadow of
any conceivable German triumph nor while
a single American flag widens to one of the
world's breezes, will America or Americans
make peace with the Germany that now is.
Either the Germany that now is or Amer
ica must cease to dwell upon this planfet;
for Germany is making the planet unin
habitable for men who can really claim to
be human. Either Germany must utterly
cease to be what she is, or she must fight
America until she or America come to an
end; for there breathes no true American
who does not now prefer death for himself,
for his beloved ones, and for his country,
to any life that he or they could possibly
live in a world that had become a German
dominion.
"I am speaking, it is true, as a single un
official individual; but I am no less voicing
the increasing feeling of the American na
tion as a whole, and of the average Amer
ican man. And speaking thus, I hereby
serve notice upon the German peacemong
ers that I have given them the only answer
they will ever get from American citizens
who are worthy of their citizenry."
ECHOES OF THE FOURTH
The Fourth was a grand day in every
country in Christendom except Germany.
While America, France, Italy and England
were celebrating the day, Germany, in
gloomy isolation, heard the news of a severe
reverse at Hamel and also the defiance of
President Wilson, who, speaking in the
shadow of Washington's tomb, checked the
German peace drive before it was fairly
started by declaring that the purpose for
which America was sending millions of
men to France cannot be fulfilled around
the council table. No compromise now is
America's Fourth of July defiance to kaiser
ism. And the splash of the keels of a hun
dred ships as they took the water from
American ways the Fourth, was also heard
around the world, and they drowned the
swish of thn German sharks' dorsal fin and
brought the menace of the submarine a long
stride closer to it3 inevitable end.

Oh, ye people, consider the spectacle of
the famous Coldstream Guards playing
Yankee Doodle in the open space across
from Westminster Abbey in London to
open the festivities for the celebration of

in England officially observed the day as
a national holiday. Lord Derby, Biitish

A GERMAN PAPER RECANTS
The Germania Herold of Milwaukee,
one of the largest German language news
papers in the United States, in a recent edi
torial entitled "An Open Confession." re
cedes from its former position that English
statesmen started the war, and places the
blame squarely on landed and industrial
junkers of Germany. Copies of the edito
rial have been received in the southwest
from the Milwaukee county council of de
fense. England is exonerated from blame on
the strength of the startling disclosures re
cently made in the memorandum of Prince
Lichnowsky, imperial German ambassador
to the court of St. James, corroborated by
the statements, of Von Jagow and other
German statesmen. The editor admits
frankly he had been misled by the official
statements of the imperial German gov
ernment to believe England's commercial
jealousies forced Germany in to the war.
"We know now that the British states
men and with them the statesmen of the
allies did not only have no warlike meas
ures against Germany in mind, but to the
last minute endeavored to their utmot to
avoid the war," the newspaper says. "The
blame for the bloodshed lies with the Ger
man government."
THE VAR
bration in Paris, the first British ambassa
dor that ever graced a Fourth of July cere
mony, and he made a speech, too, in which
he declared that the day marked the anni
versary of the greatest licking England ever
had and also that it had taught her how to
treat her children. Since the days of Bunk
er Hill, England has learned liberty in its
truest sense and has advanced to a place
in the front of the glorious procession of
ages. Germany has not. She is the same
hide-bound, blood-stained monarchy today
that she was when she loaned Hessians to
help stifle freedom in America. This world
war has brought great grief and suffering
and sacrifice, but not the least of its com
pensations has been the knitting of the
bonds of blood and brotherhood between
England and America so close and strong
that they will never be broken, no, not even
strained, in the next century to come.
REMOVING THE STING
LEADERS WHO MISLEAD
Allan L. Benson, socialist candidate for i
president in 1 9 1 6, in withdrawing from his
party because of its attitude towards the
war, both as regards its military an dindus
trial and industrial propaganda, says:
"The socialist party has among its lead
ers an undue percentage of foreign born.
These foreign born leaders mislead the
party, because they are incapable by reason
of their birth of doing otherwise. They
cannot feel what Americans feel. And
they are assisted by an anarchistic, syndical
istic minority that the party, prior to the
war, had always suppressed. The last sup
pression of this faction was the beginning
of the party's downfall."
"The syndicalists have contaminated so
cialist doctrine by foisting anarchist ideas
upon the country as socialist ideas.- A few
men in the party who should have known
better have accepted and proclaimed the
false doctrine that a workingman can have
no country and therefore that it is immate
rial to him whether the country in which
he lives, if it be at war, shall be defeated or
not."
REVOLT T
MENS RENEW
IN SOUTH AFRICA
Uly Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. July 5. Reports of seri
ous trouble iu South Africa which
have been current for the last week
were given their first official confirma
tion today by the publication of a
statenieut issued on Tuesday by Pre
mier Botha of the Union of South
Africa.
This describes the disturbances
there as presenting features similar to
those in Ireland in 1916 and attributes
them to German intrigue.
Premier Botha says it Is not in the
public intent to publish the details and
refers to prompt and effective military
and police measures. The only facts
published heretofore have been of seri
ous strikes by natives, miners and
other elements there. Some Africans
here were at first inclined to connect
with the nationalist party which is
demanding a republic with any politi
cal or any anti-government movement,
but General Heruog, the leader of that
party, recently announced that the or
ganization must follow constitutional
methods, which amounted to a retrac
tion of his previous policy.
The importance of strikes by na
tives is that it is a new move with
them and has; German agents and
probably German money, behind it.
Only a fraction of the native popu
lation has shown seditious symptoms
and it is believed that the influence of
loyal educated natives is getting the
upper hand. Premier Botha's state
ment is taken to mean that any crisis
which existed is past.

on the anniversary of the birth of the
United States were made public today
by the state department. Notable
among them was one from the Allied
club of Saltillo, Mexico, which was
sent to the American consul at Piedras
Negras, as follows:
All business has been with the ex
ception of German closed today in hon
or of your country. Accept our con
gratulations." Y. M. C. A. CALLS FOB
MORE FIELD WORKERS
NEW YORK, July 5 Herbert L.
Pratt, vice president of the Standard
Oil of New Jersey, who recently re
turned from France, where he went in
the interest of the Y. il. C. A., an
nounced yesterday the plans which
had been formed to raise 1000 men
over draft age and possessing unusual
ability in New York City and 3000 in
the rest of the country to act as Y. .M.
C. A. secretaries in France.
The extension of the Y. M. C. A.
work, which requires the trebling of
the present staff has been undertak
en at the request of General Pershing
and ot General Poch. Associated with
Mr. Piatt in the campaign to recruit
Y. M. C. A. secretaries and Seward
Prosser, J. P. .Morgan, William H. Ed
wards, Edgar L. Martson, Alberdt B.
Asuforth, William M. Kingsley, A. K.
Bedford and William J. Schietfeliu.
To illustrate the character of the
work the Y. M. C. A. made public yes
terday news received in cablegrams of
the number of Y. M. C. A. workers re
cently wounded and others decorated
for bravery and exceptional service.
When Dr. John R. Mott, the head of
the Y. 51. C. A. overseas activities, re
turned from France he called cn Col
onel Roosevelt and explained to him
the character of the Y. M. C. A., with
the result that Colonel Roosevelt said
that he would do anything in his pow
er to aid the Y. M. C. A. campaign for
iecruits.
"We need able business men for
this work," said Mr. Pratt yesterday.
"We base our appeals for such men on
the ground that from personal obsen a
tion we have learned that there is r.o
job in France too small for the big
gest man in any American community.
There isn't a president ot a railroad
or a college or a bank who cannot be
of more service today on the western
trout, standing with our boys, than he
can by remaining at home.'
Pershing Relies on Workers.
"The Y. Xi. C. A. iu France is a part
of the military machine. General
Pershing relies upon the workers of
the association to aid in keeping up
the morale of his troops so that with
their military training they shall De
come the most et'ficient fighting ma
chine in history.
"There is a pressing demand for
men who are natural leaders, men who
are real men, good mixers and capable
of exerting the proper influence. These
leaders are generally assigned as hut
secretaries, positions which call (or the
greatest versatility. They must be
above fighting age, but must be able
to undergo as searching a physical ex
amination as do the men admitted to
the combat trenches of the Hervicc;.
Ambassador Sharp, in a rec nt appeal
fur men workers, emphasized the fact
that many were breaking under thy,
terrific strain.
"That is the answer to those who I
regard the Y. M. C A. as a paradise
for pacifists, a refuge for slackers. i

WASHINGTON. July 5 Senators
from wheat growing states renewed
their fight for an increase of the gov
ernment minimum price to $2.50 oy
blocking efforts to pass an emergency
resolution continuing departmental ap
propriations until the regular appro
priation bills can be passed.
Senators Norris of Nebraska, and
Gore of Oklahoma, demanded the reso
lution be held up until the house could
vote again on the senate's wheat price
amendments to the emergency agri
cultural appropriation bill.
Senators McCumber of North Dako
ta, and Sterling of South Dakota,
spoke for the increase, the former say
ing the present price discriminates
against 33.000.000 farmers and the lat
ter insisting that farmers are granting
a concession in accepting the govern

Plans were made today for a vote in
the house tomorrow on the senate
amendment. Chairman Lever, of the.
house agricultural committee, planned
to ask the house to insist upon its re

the house again reject the proposal,

THE CAREFULLEST
By IRVING BACHELLER

He's banished the cold an' sowed his gold on the fiats in the medder grass.
Le's raise the flag a better one was never yet unfurled
But first I want to tell ye 'bout the Carefullest Man in the World.
Kings are kind o' careless-like with others' blood an bone,
But no one can, I swear to man! be carefuller o' their own.
When I read about the German dead before the heated guna
1 think o' the King of Germany with six uninjured sons.
Each fireside has its martyrs who have either died or bled;
The millions grieve for the sons who leave an' Join the host o" the dead.
But the kaiser's brood is safe an' sound 'it either shirks or runs
He's the only man in Germany with six uninjured sons.
The halt an' blind an' crippled line Its byways an' its roads;
Once swift an' strong, they creep along 'neath everlastin' loads.
An' some with crippled intellects still hear the roarin' guns,
Yet there's a King in Germany with six uninjured sons.
Such caution in a fichtin' man was never seen before;
It stands the while like a lonesome isle in a mighty sea o' gore.
The death an' woe he recommends to all the other Huns
Is not for him you bet your life or his uninjured sons.
Fitch Hohenzollern battles in a steel-clad limousine.
When the big shells come he's goin' some on legs o' gasoline;
With rubber feet, hell-bent for home, the reckless hero runs.
Oh! speed's the great preserver o' the kaiser an' his sons.
Thy're like the bold jaekrabbit an' other tribes accursed
Who have lightnin' in their sinews an" the motto "Safety first";
All clear the road an.stan' square-toed an" look with rested guns
When the kaiser starts fcr safety with his fat uninjured sons.
While hunger starves tiie Cerman host, how fat the kaiser's brood!
No gizzards yearn with cash to burn or mind the price o' food.
When the trumpet calls the Teuton dead in the line o' crippled Huns
Just think o' the kaiser marchiu' up with six uninjured sons!

that thousands of American soldiers

The experience of many of them must

"There was Dick Cheeser. alone In

GRADING STARTS SOON
Contracts have been let for the grad
ing of the Douglas-Bisbce road, and
work will be started on at least three
points in the road early iu July. This
work is preliminary to the paving of
the entire twenty-seven mile stretch
between Bisbee and .Douglas, which,
when completed, 'will make one ot the
finest pieces of road construction in
the United States.
This work was made possible by the
issuance of $1,000,000 of road bonds,
$500,0!0 of which were subscribed by
the Phelps Dodge corporation. The
splendid attitude of the mining com
panies towards the matter of road im
provement has been greatly appreciat
ed by the people of Cochise county,
particularly as they recognize that
probably 80 per cent of the cost of the
roads, is met by the companies in the
form of taxes.

It was learned today that yielding
to pressure of friends at least three
of the good citizens of Douglas would
become candidates for the legislature
which will convene next January. D.
C. O'Neill has agreed to stand as n
candidate for the Btate senate. He
served In the house during the last
regular and special sessions of the
legislature and served so satisfac
torily that many of his friends have
prevailed on him, successfully, to try
for the nomination for the senate. M.
E. Jacobs, also a member of the
present legislature, has served his
constituents so acceptably that many
of them have urged him to again
enter the race for re-election. Mr
