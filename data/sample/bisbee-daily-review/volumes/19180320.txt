ENGLISH LEADERS
FAVORING LEAGUE
fBv Review Leased Wlrol
LONDON. March 19. In the house
of lords today Lord Parmoor moved a
resolution approving the principle of
the league of nations and the cons it n
tion of a tribunal whose orders should
be enforcible by adequate sanction.
In speaking of this subject Lord
I.andsdowne said two essentials were
requisitefor a l-eague of nations. The
first was that it must be open to all
and comprise all the important powers
while the second was that it should
be armed with executive powers suf
ficient to curs unquestionable obe
dience to its decisions. .
Lord Lansdowne said he believed
that it the league was able to apply
pressure in different shapes it could
guarantee peace in the civilized world,
or at least secure a delay for discus
sion and conciliation which would, in
many cases, effectually avoid the
threatened dangers. He believed the
omens were entirely favorable to the
formation of such a league, one cf the
most hopeful omens being the inter
ests taken in the United States with
out whcse adhesion, the consumma
tion of the idea would be beyond
reach.

THE BATTLE OF WISCONSIN.
Strange to relate, the First great battle of
this year was not fought in France. It was
fought yesterday in Wisconsin, U. S. A.,
and it was a battle of ballots. Yet, never
theless, German and anti-German forces
composed the voters, and German and anti
German leaders were struggling for suprem
acy, and German and anti-German issues
were at stake, and to think that such a bat
tle should for a moment be in doubt in any
state in this union is past belief. Yet last
night's early returns indicate a close con
test. It is as though Wisconsin should
secede from the union of the states.
Thompson, German sympathizer and
friend of traitors, and Congressman Len
root, loyalist to his heart's core, were op
posing candidates for the republican nomi
nation for the United States senate in the
primary. Pro-German and anti-German
forces fighting for a United States senator.
Loyalty versus' treason. The issues well
defined and clear cut. Supporting Thomp
son were the pacifists, . the disruptors, the
agitators, the I. W. W., the disloyalists, the
socialists and all those Germans who prefer
the fatherland to their adopted country.
That Lenroot should win was, of course, to
be expected. But as this was the first direct
test in a statewide campaign upon the pub
lic feeling towards the war, the interest in
the outcome was intense throughout the
country, and the world, toe, for that matter.
In a great and stirring speech made just be
fore the election, Congressman Lenroot
set forth the issues in the following burst of
eloquence, as rare as it is remarkable in
these days of facts, figures and citations :
"The ballots that fall Tuesday will not
fall silently like the snowflake, but they
will be heard around the world. They will
be heard in Berlin. They will be heard in
Paris, in London. They will be heard in
every corner of the United States..
If it shall go forth on the night of March 1 9
that the forces opposed to this war, the
forces whose sympathies have not been
with the government in this war, the forces
made up in part of those who want Ger
many to win this war against the United
States, if the wires shall carry the news that
these forces have won in Wisconsin, then
there will be joy in Berlin, then there will be
joy in every disloyal heart in America.
Then, indeed, shall we be compelled to ad
mit that Wisconsin would rather be a pro
vince of Germany than one of the United
States."
Washington has decided" that Harold
Steinfeld, son of the rich merchant of Tuc
son, must go to war. That his absence will
net injure his community to a point where
an exception in his case was made neces
sary. Thus is the honor and the fairness
and the real simon pure democracy of the
draft upheld. Never was there such an
army draft before in a free land. Rich man,
poor man, merchant, chief, all must go who
ought to go, and all may tay behind to help
in other ways who ought to stay. Over a
million men called from business and home
to a most bitter and deadly war and only a
murmur here and there in all the land. This
great draft has tested the foundations of our
free government of and by ourselves a3
nothing else could do and found it estab
lished upon the living rock.
That old and heroic expression, "die fcr
my country," has been transposed by a
Kansas soldier in France which typifies tlr:
American spirit of the twentieth century.
"I didn't come over here to die for my coun
try," he writes back to a friend, "what I
came over here for was to make some of
those boches die for theirs. ' Here is an.
American boy, most representative of his
country, speaking the Kansa3 language as
it is spoken in the shortgrass country of that
great state. He would live for his country;
not die. Let the boches do the dying. "I
, don't know about whipping those Germans
sc soon, he gees on in his naive and graphic
style, "the j ers a tough lot, ar.d I rr.sy not
get back in time for that fishing trip next
fall. However, we are 'going to make a
showing that will count.1' Nothing boajt
ful here. Just sheer American pluck and
confidence at their best. Every sentence
is a typical American epigram. Eight
American soldier boys out of every ten of
the hundred of thousands that will be sent
to France will feel and think and speak in
this manner of their task. It is the Ameri
can spirit shorn of the Fourth of July
eagle feathers and facing a gigantic under
taking in a manner that could not be iore
creditable to the spirit and traditions of this
great young nation. ' t
THE IMMENSITY OF THE TASK.
The following statement is one K of the
most effective presentations of the war sit
uation that has been made in small com
pass. It is the utterances of Dr. R. L. Wil
bur, president of Leland Stanford, Junior,
University. It deserves consideration by
every American as pointing to the immensi-
ty of the task ahead. Dr. Wilbur made it
after a stay in Washington in which he was
associated with the food administration and
liad the chance to become familiar with the
war outlook as it appears to men in touch
with the situation:
"We must realize that we have to win
this war with men who are yet in civilian
clothes, send them across three thousand
miles of sea in ships that are yet to be built ;
these ships protected by submarine destroy
ers that are not yet laid down; armed with
guns that are not yet on paper, and manned
with crews that are still untrained.'
It now develops that the Germans, after
boasting all winter about a spring offensive
that would land them in Paris and win the
channel ports, have determined to wage
a defensive campaign this year. They do
not want any more of the French or Brit
ish game. They have been outfought for
two years man for rofan and gun for gun
by the Tommies and the Poilu and no one
knows it better than they. The slaughter
at Verdun and Ypres and oh the Scmme
and Chemin des Dames has weakened their
morale. And, in spite of the wail of the
alarmists, the allies still hold the edge in
men and guns in the west. That the Brit
ish will make another trial on an unprece
dented scale to break through to Roulers
on'the Ypres front and' thus clean out the
submarine bases on the Belgium coast is
expected by every one. And that they
will also try to take Lens and. force the
evacuation of the Lille district is almost as
certain. TTe French will surely try to
take Laon an thus force a general retirement,
ment on the southern end of the line. And
and offensive up through Lorraine on the
American sector is hoped for. This, cf
course, wlil be made by the French, aided
by probably ten American divisions (ie
270,000 men). The Germans have many
fresh division, s moved from Russia, and
many more guns. The fighting will doubt
less be more intense and deadly and the
artillery fire will be something to wonder
at, even in this war of heavy guns. As a
special writer put3 it, when the spring
fighting begins, the "big guns will begin a
battle symphony of death.''
Another strike directed at the great and
vital shipbuilding campaign has been begun,
this one at Baltimore by the ironworkers.
The men had agreed to. a wage scale of
$5.60 a day. Now they want more. The
men walked out with but short warning.
It is believed that union officials will
squelch this strike as this wage agreement
had been generally accepted by union
labor. To the average loyal and patriotic ,
citizen such a strike as this looks like the
act of men who smell blood money and
want more and more. Utterly selfish and
mercenary motives alone could have
prompted the strike. American lives and
American success depend upon ships. Wage
scales were agreed to upon both sides. And
yet strike after strike flashes out like incen
diary fires. Union labor seems to have a3
much or more trouble in working for
Uncle Sam as it ha3 with those whom it
has been pleased to call "the money barons
of the land."

VACCINATION URGED
BY HEALTH DOGTOR
Pr. D. Hrown. city health officer,
last night reported that four mild cas
es of smallpox have been taken to the
isolation' hospital and urged that ev
eryoiie within the district cooperate
in an effort to stamp out the disease
to prevent the possibility of it getting
beyond control and thus causing an
other quarantine embargo being order
ed by the state authorities.
According to Dr. Brown numerous
persons were exposed by the peoplo
now in custody before they realized
they had smallpox and called in a doc
tor and for that reason it is very es
sential that everyone who has not been
successfully vaccinated have this done 5
at once.
Dr. Brown's statement follows:
it is urgea ioai every mie in iuc ;
A i ! i r-i wHst Van vi rit Knn e ii foec fill! 1
varciimieu receuuy facciuaicu at (
once. This measure is requested in
view of the probability that the dan-.
ger of smallpox is not entirely over t
and t general vaceinatjon is one of the i
surest means of eradicating the dis-;
ease." ,
There is no epidemic here but Dr.
Brown wants to insure that the situa-!
tion will not reach that stage and asiss
the assistance of everyone in this re-.
spect, pointing out that if everyone 1
becomes vaccinated there will be no
chance of fee disease spreading. I

HOOVER ON VICTORY GARDENS
The importance of the Victory
Garden as a factor in solving the
dillicukies of the present food
situation is pointed out by Herbert
Hcover in a letter to Timothy A.
Kiordan. federal iood administra
tor for Arizona. He writes:
We have been saved from posi
tive shortage throughout the coun
try largely by virtue of the ac
cumulated household stores which
are the results, of home endeavor.
The food situation of the world
must steadily degenerate as Ions
as the war "lasts. It is therefore
of prime importance to add every
item to the total production.
Furthermore our over-taxed rail
ways will be greatly relieved if we
have a larger area of gardens
planted than last year.
'It seems to me that the ex- i
perience of last season Indicates j
that aside from a moderate plant- .
inc of nerishable vegetables for
immediate use, the substantial
part of 6ich gardens, should be
devoted to potatoes and beans.
"These commodities are of the
utmost value from a food point of
view and have great advantage in j
that they can be preserved in the (
household without artificial treat- 5
ment. I

Notwithstanding the fact that the,
Germans for some time past have ad-j
vertised largely their intention to be
gin a general offensive on the allied ,
fronts at no distant date, nothing be-,
yond intensified bombardments and!
here and there infantry attacks on

In both, these kinds of maneuvers, i
the Teutons have met more than their
match in the euns nr the men of the
I allied armies the Belgians, British, 1
French, Americans, Italians and Por-1

efforts to hearten the people at home I
are beginning to require something

er tack has been taken which either;
must result in an attempt to carry out ;

result in the German populations be-J

HAROLD STEINFELD IS
ORDERED HELD TO
AWAIT DRAFT CALL'
His Claim for Exemption Di3-i
allowed and Will Probably!
Be Called to Go With Next!
Quota, March 29th.
According to the Tucson Star, re
ceived here yesterday, instruction
have been received by the local draft
hoard of that county to place Harold
Steinield in the legular order of liabil
ity under the old draft. The Star says"
"The instructions, received by tele
graph early yesterday were as follows:
" 'Harold Steinfeld will be handled
the same as any other registrant in
his proper order. Disregard the pre
vious wire instructions.'
"While no advices were received by
either the local or district board, it
was presumed from the message that
President Wilson had passed adverse
ly upon Mr. SteinfeM's appeal for ex
emption and that instructions were rs
ceived by Adjutant General Harris,
upon which he based his instructions
to lh" local board of Tucson.
"The last instructions the4ocal board
received from Adjutant General Har
ris were to suspend operations of the
draft as to Mr. Steinfeld. This put
him on a suspended list and eliminat
ed him from consideration in the draft
to fill up the contingent to go under
the now national call for 90.000 men, of
which the Tucson quota will be 13
men.
Mr. Steinfeld end a number of oth
ers who have been held back from the
camps on appeals, head the list as It
now ttands. Most of those at the head
o" the list are. like Mr. Steinfeld, out
of their order r.umber, but in se
quence. Their associates on the origi
nal order of liability have already
gone to the army either by volunteer
ing or by draft.
"On this list Mr. Steinfeld is said to
be the 20th man from the top. but ow
ing to the fact that a number whose
numter comes before his have applied
for special induef'or into special regi
ments, virtually volunteers, the possi
bility is very strong that he will be
one of the 13. All those who volunteer
in the call for special service who are
at the top of the list, will be credited
it is said, to the next big draft to be
made when congress gets through with
pending legislation. In other words,
their volunteering now does not reduco
the quota to go at this time, but it
does operate to reduce the numbers re
quired in the next draft. This is ac
cording to present advices.
"The thirteen, according to the best
information obtainable, will leave
about March 29. Whether they will
leave from Tucson or not is still a ques
tion, since soma of the men are not
here. The names of the 13 can not be
ascertained until the Epecial inductions
are cleared up and the final list .ar
ranged." .-. '
WOMAN ACQUITTED.

her character.
In tharming ihe jury for its verdict,
Mrs. Howe said:

honor, not for her life."

ton, Greenlee county. County Attor
ney Chambers wanted tho case tried

transfer the case to Greenlee county,
having no discretion in the matter.

SMALL TOWN GUY AT

! The picture is a recent release, and is

The story has to do with the adven

"Gets-It" Makes Corns Come Off The
"Banana-Peel" Way
Why have to flop on the floor,
squteze yourself up like the letter "Z"
and with bulging eyes draw your face
up Into a wrinkly knot while you gouge
and pull at the "quick" of a tender
corn? That's the old. savage way.
"Gets-If" is thi modern, painless, sim
ple way. Lean over and put two drops
of "Gets-U" on the corn, put your
stocking and shoe right on again, and
forget the corn. Pain is eased.
Gets-lt" has revolutionized the
treatment of corns. It never irritates
the true flesh. You'll stop limping on
the side of your shoe, and do away
with greasy salves, bundling bandages,
thick planters, and painful methods.
I'se "Gets-It." It's common sense.'
