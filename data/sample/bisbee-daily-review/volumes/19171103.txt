OPERATORS IN
DISTRICT TO
Investigation of President Wil
son's Labor Commission
Nears End. May Leave for
the Coast Tonight
Operators of the Warren district
will confer with the president- fed
eral labor commission this morning,
and It Is thought jpossible hat Sec
retary of Labor W. B. Wilson and
his party may leave Bisbee this even
ing for the west, probably San Fran
cisco. Yesterday the commission conferred
with and questioned several Bisbee
people, including Sheriff Harry C.
Wheeler, Miles W. Merrill and Bas
sett T. Watklns, during the day, and
a committee of loc; business men
during the evening. The commission
has now talkad to some of -the men
deported from the camp July 12, and
to ethers having complaints to regis
ter; to the sheriff, to some of the
miners now employed and who have
been employed during the entire sea
son, and to representative business
men.
No Comment Forthcoming
No member of the commission last
evening would make any comment on
the progress of the investigation.
Neither would the secretary state
what end the commission had In
sight.
j, It is expected, however, that the
commission may end its investigaiion
of Bisbee and Warren dirtrict condi
tions today when the mine operators
conclude their conference with the
visitors.
Due to the seriousness of tho
threatened strike on the Pacific coast
of the employes of the Pacific Tele
phone and Telegraph company, the
commission may go direct to San
Francisco. Secretary of Labor Wilson
(has asked all parties to the contro
versy to postpone any action until the
entire commission is in 'the California
cjty. This may indicate a change of
plans on the part, of the commission,
as it contemplated a visit to the
Verde district, following the disposal
of the Bisbe? investigation.
Masses Facing
Prosecution on
Several Counts
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Nov. 2 An injuctton
granted by Judge Learned Hand re
straining Postmaster Thomas G. Pat
ten from barring the August number
of The Masses, a socialist publication
from the mails was vacated today by
the United States circuit court of ap
peals. The hieher court held that the tnas-
azlne bad violated the selective service i
law and the espionage act and as a re
sult of this ruling it is said the federal
authorities will soon begin criminal
proceedings against the publication.
In granting the injunction Judge
Hand had maintained that "only dire:t
advocacy of resistance to the draft
law would warrant the exclusion of
The Masses from the mails.' and on
this point the court of appeals gave the
following decision:
'That one may wilfully obstruct the
enlistment service, wi'.hout advising
In direct language against enlistment,
and without stating that to Terrain
from enlistment is to a duty or in one's
interest, seems to us too plain for' con
troversy. "To obstruct the recruiting or en
listment service within the meaning
of the statute. It is not necessary that
there should be a physical obstruction.
Anything which impedes, hinders, re
tards, restrains "or pu'.s an obstacle In
the way of recruiting, is sufficient"

ECONOMISTS OF
COUNTRY DIFFER
ON BIG QUESTION
Academy of Political and So
cial Science Brings Out
Some Interesting Views on
Pressing War Problems.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PHILADELPHIA, Not. 2. A gen
eral division cf opinion of the ques
tion of whether American industries
should be reorganized under govern
ment auspices to concentrate Its full
energy upon the production of war
material or whether heavy taxes be
levied to meet the costs of the war
under the existing system of indus
trial Individualism, featured the ses
sions here today of the war finance
meeting or the American Academy of
Political and Social Science.
Congressman John J. Fitzgerald,
chairman of the appropriations com
mittee, predicted a period of unex
ampled taxation, which, he said,
would be necessary rather than loans
to meet the costs of war.
Mortimer L. Schiff of New York,
presenting the "Conservative Banker"s
View,- said there must be no tamper
ing of enterprise, but unwise or un
just taxation.
"The public must not be discour
aged and values must not be jeopard
ized by an unfriendly attitude by the
government toward business he said.
Government First.
Mr. Schiff said the government must
monopolize the investment market if
necessary. The government, be said.
Is entitled to have Its money, require
ments supplied before and, if need
be, to the exclusion of private enter
prises or even of states or municipali
ties. "Last, and most Important, the peo
ple must belaught to save and all
unnecessary expenditures must be
avoided. Thrift and economy must
prevail." ,
Socialized Era.
Dr. H. C. Adams of the University
of Michigan and Frank A. VanderliJ
of New York urged the necessity of
a new, socialized era of industry in
which the vast energies of the nation
be directed primarily to the purposes
of the war, without the waste of com
petition. In summarizing the trend of theory
that forecast new standards in Ameri
can life, Mr. Vanderlip said:
"No man, no matter how great his
pretentions, can be considered patri
otic when he employs labor at non
essentials to an extent that makes
hi ma competitor of the government
in the present crisis. Business must
be reorganized, with the immediate
needs of the nation as its first aim
and thought."
Another View.
Edwin R. A. Seligman of Columbia
university said government loans are
Indispensable to sound war finance,
but to attempt to finance war exclu
sively through loans was short
sighted. "And," he added, "to attempt to fi
nance a war exclusively through tax
ation Is suicidal.
"War taxes must be high enough to
assure a solid foundation for the loans
and to ensure a rapid payment of the
debt within a relatively Bhort time."
The fundamental thing is our war
finance, according to Roy G. tlakely,
of the University of Minnesota, In the
reduction of consumption. "This Is
even more important," he said, "than
increased production. Economies
should be forced by governmental sus
pension of unnecessary production."

Member of Labor Commission
Urges That Secretary of La
bor Recommend the Com
mandeering of Telephone
Plant
Secretary of Labor W. B. Wil
son last night refused to state
what recommendations, if any, he
had made to President Wilson In
regard to the Pacific coast tele
phone employes' strike. Secretary
Felix Frankfurter of the commis
sion said Mr. Wilson had tele
graphed to Vernef Z. Reed the
federal mediator, and to L. C.
Gasper, vice president of the In
ternational Brotherhood of Elec
trical Workers, regarding the situ
ation. It is understood that the secre
tary urged all parties to the con
troversy to defer any contemplated
action until the arrival of the en
tire commission. This includes the
Reed proposal of commandeering
the plant and employes of the Pa
cific Telephone & Telegraph Co.
SAN FRANCISCO, IS'ov. 2. Govern

recommended by Verner Z. Reed in
a telgram sent to Secretary of Labor
Wilson today. Jr. Reed, federal
mediator in the telephone strike, an
ticipated failure of the Seattle contro
versy, which has partly disorganized
service in the Pacific northwest and
threatened to spread to California.
Mr. Reed asked Secretary Wilson
and the members Of his commission to
recommend commandeering of the
plants of tbe company to President
Wilson "in the interest of national de
fense." During the interim, Mr. Reed
said the government would expect
striking employes to return to their
posts and others to remain there.
Company Refutes.
Mr. Reed's action followed final re
fusal of the company to recognize the
telephone 'operators' union, demanded
by organized electrical workers, as the
principal consideration In any nego
tiations looking to settlement of con
troversy, which involves approximate
ly S00O unionized employes in Wash
ington, Oregon, California and Nevada.
Mr. Reed further recommended that
officials, superintendents, foremen and
employes of the company and its sub
sidiaries, whether on strike, be com
mandeered into the federal service.
The girl operators are asking recog
nition of their union as their principal
demand and the electrical workers are
i
seeking a higher wage.
Would Commandeer All.
Mr. Reed said In his telegram to
Secretary Wilson he recommended
the commandeering by the president
"of all the plants and properties of

Co. and its subsidiaries thai may be
needed for the nation's defense, that

"I expect," said Mr. Reed, "that ev
ery operator, aa soon as he or she
receives this news, will continue at,
work, or report for work until such
time as the action of the president Is
known."
Representatives of the organized em-
pi0yes were In conference tonight to

RUSSIA ASKS
HONEY AS THE
PROPER HELP
! Premier
Kerensky's Declara
tion Interpreted in Some
Quarters to Mean Gold.
Country Still Has Large
Credit Here.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2. Premier
Kerensky's statement tha: America's
most effective help to Russia would
! be the sending of money was regarded
here as possibly l'jrcasting formal re
quest for the transportation of gold to
Russia, but it was thought more like
ly that wha:the premier bad In mind
was the establishment of credits to be
expended here In the purchase of sup
plies for Russia.
"Have her send boots," the premier
was quoted as saying in response S a
question as to how America could help
best, "leather, iron, and," with empha
sis, "money.' ?
Would Be 'Precedent.
The sending of actual money out of
the country to any of the allies would
establish a precedent and will be dia
metrically opposed to the American
government's present policy, which
aims at the conservation of the huge
store of gold piled up since the war
started. As-a means of making such
conservation effective, gold was plac
ed, by presidential proclamation oi
the list of commodities which must !
licensed for export and, the federal
reserve board, under Secretary Mo
Adoo's supervision, announced a policy
of holding gold exports to the mini
mum. ! i
The American government, appar
ently, is entirely willing to grant fur
ther requests for credits. It has
granted Russia's requests with alacrity
and Secretary McAdoo has announced
repeatedly that the treasury would
place money wherever it would be
nAst effective in fighting Germany,
Russia Has Balance.
Until today Russia had not. expended
the first of three credits established
for her benefit in this country, totaling
$325,000,000. The formal transfer to
day to Russian account of $31,700,00)
from the treasury to the federal re
serve bank of New York brought the
total she had withdrawn up to $190,
900.000, or $15,900,000 more than the
first credit jf $175,000,000.
There still remains available for

ITALIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
NORTHERN ITALY, Thursday, Nov.
'1. p. m. (By the Associated Press).
The immensity of the convulsion
through which the Italian army is
passing makes individual impressions
count for little. Yet, as an eye
witness at the extreme front up to the
day of retirement and then as a par
ticipant in the retreat to the new po
sition westward, the correspondent's
experience is typical of those hun
dreds of persons that the army re
moved from the danger zone.
It can be stated that we were situ
ated with General ('adorns and the
general staff. His sturdy figure was
often seen as he went to and from
the front where the Duke of Aosta,
commander of the third army, and
General Cappelo, commander of the

of the wall of steel that the Italians

APPOINTED HEAD
Bavarian Premier Is Officially
Announced As the Succes

Advent to Be Interesting.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
COPENHAGEN. Nov. 2. Count Geo.
F. von Hertling has been appointed;
Imperial German chancellor. This was j
announced In an official statement re-!
celvad here from Berlin.
BERLIN, via London, Nov. 2. The
Berlin newspapers, without exception,
concedes the appoinment of Count
von Hertling as German imperial
chancellor and anticipate his accep
tance of the post. It was stated that
King Ludwig of Bavaria, in response
to Emperor William's request, has re
leased Count von 'Hertling from the
post of premier of Bavaria and thus"
removed the last formal hindrance to
his appointment tohe chancellorship.
The Germania says that Von Hert
ling will return to Munlsh within a
fe wdays for the purpose of terminat
ing the tenure of his office there and
will be back In Berlin by the middle
of the month, when, it is expected,
the relchstag will reconvene in ad
vance of the date originally set. The
new chancellor, it is presumed, will
then develop his program In response
to an Interpellation and receive a vote
of confidence from the majority par
ties. THE "OLD FOX."
AMSTERDAM. Nov. 2. The "old
fox" Is the sobriquet by which Count
von Hertling la known in Bavaria, ac
cording to the Berlin TageblatL The
descriptive name, the newspaper says,
was given to the count because of the
"backstairs" methods that have char
acterized his five and a half years Ba
varian premiership.
Little is expected from Von Hertling
in the diretclon of internal reforms,
the Tageblatt declares. He always op
posed parliamentarism, although he
acted like a parliamentary minister.
Von Hertling has not felt the spirit
of the new era, the newspaper says
in conclusion, but "his philosophical
spirit long recognized that this war
must end otherwise than by annex
ations and (he war indemnities that
characterized small wars In the past.
He is permeated by the spirit that is
to bring about a new order of things
in regard to the mutual relations be

RETROGRADE
MOVE BY THE
Huns Retire From Points
Along the Famous Chemin
des Dames Sector. Invaders
Stopped at the Tagliamento
River.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
The Germans have retreated from
points along the historic Chemin des
Dames sector on the Aisne front in
France, where for several months the
French troops of General Petain had
been keeping them sharply to task.
Just where the retrograde move
ment took place and how far It ex
I
tends cannot yet be told, as tbe Ger
man official communication announc
ing it merely says that the Teutons,
unnoticed and undisturbed by tbe en
emy, systematically withdrew their
lines from the hilly front in this re
gion. The entire line to the north of
the Aisne, where the Germans were
last reported as facing the French, is
undulating In character from the Soia
sons sector eastward to the vicinity
of Craonne, and therefore it is impos
sible, from the rather terse acknowl
edgment of withdrawal, to determine
the terrain which has been given up.
Nevertheless it appears that the
Germans, tired of the terrible ordeal
they had been forced to undergo tor
some time from the French artillery
and violent artillery attacks, hate de
cided to fall back, upon Laon. capital
of the department of Aisne, which
with its network of railways has been
the quest of tbe French. It is po.!
ble. and seemingly probable, that the
withdrawal of the Germans will com
pel also the falling back of the Ger
man forces in the turn of the battle
line In this region running north
ward to St. Quenlin. if. indeed, it does
not affect the German positions as
far north as Arras.
In Italy
. On the Italian front the Austro
Gennans and Italians are in combat
along the middle and lower regions
of the Tagliamen'o river, with the
Teutonic forces on the east and Gen
eral Cadorna's army on the western
side of the stream. As far as is known
the enemy has not yet been able to
cross the river, which is in freshet,
but It seems apparent that from the
Carnic Alps south along the battle
line to the head of the Adriatic the
Italians now are holding their new
line of defense securely.
Italy Patriotic
Meantime, sentiment in Italy is
seething with patriotic fervor, wirh
even the old Garibaldi veierans and
men invalided home as a result of In
juries in the present war desiring to
rush to the scene of hostilities.
On the other fronts there have been
no engagements of great importance.
The Britons have carried out minor
operations for gains west of Passchen
daele and southeast of Poelrapelle. -n
both of which priosners ware cap
tured. To the east of Ypres the Ger
man guns have been violently shell
ing the British lines.
Although, according to the Russian
premier. Russia Is warworn and be
lieves she has the right to claim that
the allies now should take the heav
iest part of the burden off her shou!
ders, the new republic has no inten
tion to declare herself out of the war.
Help, he said, was urgently needed,
especially in the form of money and
supplies. He appealed to the world
net to lose faith in the Russian revo
lution. Newlands Thinks

PETROGRAD, Thursday, Nov. 1.
"Russia bas fought' consistently since
the beginning. She saved France and
England from disaster early in the
war. She is now worn out by the
strain and claims as her right that the
allies now take the heaviest part of
the burden."
Thus Premier Kerensky explained
Russia's position to the Associated
Press correspondent. The correspond
ent called attention to widely contra
dictory reports on Russia's conditions
and asked the premier for - a (rank
statement of the lactst ! . ' t
"Is Russia out of the war?" Premier
Kerensky laughed.
"That," he answered, "is a ridicu
lous question. Russia is taking an
enormous part in the war. Russia be
gan the war for the allies. While she
was already fighting, England was
only preparing and America was only
observing.
"Russia at the beginning bore the
whole brunt of the fighting, thereby
saving Great Britain and France. Peo
ple who say she is out of the war have
short memories. We have fought since
the beginning and they must now take
the heaviest part of the burden on
their shoulders." 5
"Could an American army be of use
if sent to Russia?"
"tl. would be impossible to send
one," said Kerensky. "It is a ques
tion of transport The difficulties are
too great."
"If America cannot send troops,
what would be the most useful way
for her to help Russia?" was asked.
"Have her send boots, leather, iron
and," tie premier added emphatically,
"Money." f. .
The premier was asked, regarding

BALLOONANTIGS IS
HIT AT THEATRE
Without a single exception, "Bal
loonatics," shown at the Royal yester-
I toy, is one of thei most laughable
'comedies any theatre in iiisbee has
ever presented.
There is not a pie throwu into any
body's fcce in "Bailoonatics." but
there, is pome of the most wholesome
and yet most ludicrous fun ever con
ceived for the picture screen.
Alire Howell demonstrated that she
doesn't need custard pio to make her
funny. Her fuzzy topnot of yellow
hnir. her unmanageable feet and her
pathetic smile leave no room for the
, common plates of slapstick w ork.
'Tsllocnatic8" will be shown again
at the Royal today and this evening. j
and all who did not see "Bailoonatics"
yesterday should certainly spRre the
time today, as it is a production far
out of the ordinary.

CANADIANS ARE
CLOSING IN ON
PASSUDAELE
CANADIAN HEADQUARTERS IN;
FRANCE, via London. Nov. 2 (By thej
Canadian Press. Limited), The Cana
dians have closed In further towards
Passchendaele. Following the great
oattie on the left wing, when our
troops on the extreme left proved
their marked superiority over the
enemy, while our right outposta ven
tured into Passchendaele, the fighting
has been intermittent all along the
line. Opposite Meetcheetle, where the
front lines are near together, the Ca
nadians and the Germans, under the
Red Cross flag, buried their dead and
evacuated their wouned Wednesday
afternoon. Stretcher bearers of both
!5lgB
forces passed and repassed one an
other in the mud and slime.
When our left moved forward on
October 30 this battalion faced Meet
scheele. In 400 yards of rising coun
try, one succession of shell hoJe:,
filled with stagnant water, lay before
them, and to the right was a marsh.
They skirted the marsh and struggled
forward up the heights, paying for
every yard of the advance, for the
Germans fought well here, defending
every fortified shell bole. Raked by
machine-gun fire. 6hell constantly,
with comrades falling around them,
and but a dip of occasional hollows
to shelter them, they went forward
to their objective. Meetscheele had
to be taken. The whole position de
pended on success In this movement.
Canada's oldest battalion captured
Meetscheeje. Tbat capture will live
In Canadian history for the daring of
the battalion which made it. -

Tombstone Koch was sighted. He left
the road and the officers ordered him j
U surrender. Instead he started to
run. The officers fired and Koch, real- j
izing his predicament, threw his gun j
away and surrendered. j
Koch's Reason. ,
Koch, according to Sherift Wheeler J
made a clean breast of the entire af- j
fair. He declared that he attempted
'j rob the bank in order to get 200
which he desired to send to his mother,
who is In Germany. He also told the
sheriff that he had two brothers killed
fighting for the kaiser and expressed
the desire that the Emperor of ier-i
many had been one of his brothers.

rival of the patient 'at the Copper

Brandt Has Chance.
The shot, which hit Brandt, first
went through bis left ami. It entered
his left breast and ranged downward
and lodged below the twelfth rib. It
was found, in operating, tbat no one ef
the intestine had been perforated,
which was, at first feared. The doc
tors, in attendance, declared that the
patient had more thari an even chance
to live and that the paralysis of
Braud't lower limbs might be due to

' Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water healers are in

SAN ANTONIO, Tex., Nov. 2. Posi
tive identification of three negroes of
the twenty-fourth infantry who partic
ipated in the riot at Houston, August
23rd, last, which resulted in fhe death
of twenty-two persons was made this
afternoon by Captain Haig Sherkerjian
of the twenty-fourth infantry, tes;lfy-
ing at the court martial trial of sixty-!
three negroes who are charged with
mutiny, murder and rioting. The iden
tififguion was made In connection with
a detailed narration of events leading
up to the rioting.
The three negroes who were Identi
fied were Corporal J. R. Hawkins, Cor
poral G. Brown and Private Ira Davis.
They were among the defendants in
the court room. The. shooting up of
Houston, according to Captain Sher
kerjian's testimony was precipitated
by the action of Policeman Sparks 'of
Houston in abusing Corporal Charles
Baltiiuoore of the twenty-fourth in
fantry when Sparks arrested him on
the afternoon preceding the outbreak.
At the time of Baltimoore's arrest the
'witness testified. Baltim'jore was on
military police duty and wore a police
badge that was plainly visible to
Sparks.
The trouble started. Captain Sher
kerjian testified when Baliimoore ask
ed Policeman Sparks why be had ar
rested a negro member 'of the twenty
fourth infantry. Baltimoore, accord
ing to Sherkerjian said Sparks "cursed
him' 'and told him it was "none of his
business.". Baltimoore then told
Sparks thfct he was on guard duty and
would have to report back to his com
manding 'officer why the soldier had
been arrested. To this, according to
the witness. Sparks replied he did not
have to tell "a nigger" and bit him on
the head twice with his pistol. Balti
moore then ran down the street while
Sparks fired three shots after him.
Baltimoroe was captured and taken to
jail.
Meantime the report reached Camp
Logan, where the negro trc'ops were i
stationed that Baltimoore had been
shot and killed.
Captain Sherkerjian testified that
Major K. S. Snow sent him - into the
city to investigate the report. He
went to police headquarters where be
conferred with Chief of Police Brock.
Both Baltimoore and Sparks fold their
stories of the incident in the chiefs of
fice, Sherkerjian testified and it was
agreed at police headquarters that
Sparks was at fault. Sparks was then
suspended.
Captain Sherkerjian then said he
took Baltimoore to camp where he call
ed all the first sergeants into his tent
and fold them of the incident, explain
ing that Sparks would be properly pun
ished and instructed the non-commissioned
officers to explain the situation
fully to the men at "retreat" at 6
o'clock. Major Snow had previously
cancelled all passes for the night, he
said.
Sherkerjian then detailed the hap
penings in camp later in the evening,
telling of learning that the negro sol
diery were 'obtaining ammunition and
of his effort to restore order.
The soldiers he said, seemed pos
sessed with the Idea that a mob of
Houston civilians were coming to the
camp to shoot them.
"Men. nobody can c'ome into this
camp to harm you unless U is over
me," Sherkerjian. said he told them.
" -We are tired of this. We will take
the law into our own hands'," one ne
gro shouted, the captain testified.
At this juncture Sherkerjian tes
tified, "somebody knocked me over. I
got up. pulled my flashlight and threw
it in the face of a man whose face im
pressed me. 'Drop that light or I will
put a hole through you, he commanded
me. I put out the light"
Here the captain pointed out Ira
Davis, a negro seated among the de
fendants as the man he referred ;to
Colonel J. A. Hull, judge advocate, con
ducting the prosecution said, "Ira Da
vis, arise." The negro Sherkerjian
had pointed out arose, visibly nervous.
He was then commanded to sit down.
Continuing his narration Sherkerjian
testified:
'It all happened faster than I can
tell you. Men began firing. There
was too much noise for them to hear
my commands to Stop.
'About this time I heard some one
yell. To h I with going to France!
Let's go clean up that city!' "
The negroes then started toward
town he added.
fidpto Feed Our Allies This Winter!
Our problem at the present time is to feed tie allies this winter by sending them as
much food as we can of the most concentrated nutritive food value in the least ship
ping space. These foods are wheat, beef, pork, dairy products and sugar. The solution
of the problem, therefore, is to eat less of tSese and more of the foods of which we
have an abundance and to waste less of all foods ; to save wheat, to save meat, to save
fats, to save sugar, to save fuel, to save m'lk, to use perishables. Use less of wheat.
Eat less wheat bread and don't waste a single slice. Save a pound of floor per week.
Eat less beef, mutton and pork; use any of this kind of meat not more than once a
day. Do not wastean ounce; use all leftovers. Use less butter; eat fewer fried
foods. Don't waste any butter, lard or drippings. Eat less candy; drink fewer sweet
drinks and so on down the line. We offer herewith some items and prices that will
help you keep the Food Pledge, at very attractive prices.

Our Meatless Day
Bisbee observed her first meatless day yesterday, and
did very well. Fresh catfish and croppie and red snapper
and halibut and herring and chicken and eggs stepped
into the breach and held the line just like the allies are
holding it on the western front. There was not much
grumbling. It is true that tae few who did grumble
made a lot of noise. But the great majority made the
best of it and really enjoyed their meatless meals.
The spirit of the thing even impressed the waiters
in the restaurants of the city. Instead of the foghorn
bellow of "ham. an' " or "pork ro-a-s-t" or ."steak with
onions r-a-r-e," the waiters called softly and politely,
"eggs scrambled, a nice order of catfish and potatoes
with their jackets on."
When it is considered that every meatless day means
thousands of tons of meat for the allies to carry them
forward for that final drive against the Prussian, It ought
not to be very hard. For our friends over there it will
soon be meat once a week. Why not, then, one meatless
day a week for us? And in the matter of wheat bread.
A wbeatless day for us means countless carloads of wheat
for England and France. And out there on the Flanders
plains and the fair valleys watered by the Oise and the
Aisne are thousands upon thousands of wooden crosses,
all motionless under the sun and the stars, that mark
the resting place of brave men who died for a cause
to which we are committed to the end. Shall we not
be unselfish for a day in a week in order that their peo
pie and their dependents may fight on with us to that
end?
Reports have come in that there are some traitors
in a few scattered communities in this great land who
are opposing the food pledge. Only gluttons and traitors
will dodge their duty to their native land. In Germany
a file of soldiers with fixed bayonets are sent to tell the
people what they must eat and what they must not eat;
to tell them what they must give and what they must
do and where they must go. But this is a free country,
thank God! and our government asks us to do these
things. As the food control measures grow more stringent
and stern, they advance foot by foot abreast of public
opinion. Public sentiment passed these measures through
its servant, the American congress. The masses and the
majority are behind our policies and our program in this
land. We are doing what we are today because we want
to do it, and because it is right and just and necessary
in the face of what we stand for under our constitution
and our flag.
We are not slaves or cattle, to be driven by the bay
onet to give and to do. We ourselves decide, and then
we DO gloriougly, without stint, world without end, never
ceaaingjuntil the right shall prevail.
President Wilson's commission, sent west for the pur
pose of laying the industrial unrest, is now in our midst
Its members prefer to listen rather than to talk. This
is most commendable The story of the Bisbee strike
and deportation is being told to them this week by the
deporters and the deportees. If the story the latter tell
is anything like their wild and false and foolish and
malicious interviews printed in one or two out-of-town
papers and in many publications friendly to the more
radical element of union labor, then they will do them
selves more harm than good, for these lurid statements
fall to the ground self-branded before a real investigation
of facts. Bisbee's story of her fight for life is the simple
and sincere narrative of home and town defenders and
it stands straight and true in any light and before any
investigation because it IS true. The rrjen who tell it
and the men who made the history for the telling are
as honorable and as high class of citizens as can be
found in any community in Ibis republic. The entire
city of today stands behind tiiat story and that act and
points today with some pride to the city that has been
saved and the great mining industries that were saved
with it.
I America Must Hurry j
Lyman P. Powell, an eminent American who has spent
some months in the European war zone, under the above
heading, writes most earnestly and Intelligently and pa
triotically to his countrymen through the columns of the
magazine section of the New York Times regarding the
war. In part, Mr. Powell, after declaring that Germany
is still unbeaten and strong and that the submarine men
ace, while met for the present, is not solved, writes as
follows:
We are going to win this war. Germany knows it.
She is getting ready for it. She is preparing to reap
quickly the results of peace while the allies are busy
distributing their fighting men among their many homes.
The German revolution will come at the psychological
moment The military front has not been broken. The
Germans have simply been bent back. German territory
has not been occupied. Nobody knows probably not
even the kaiser the exact economic strain to which the
German people are now subject, but anybody who is in
the fighting zone may find out for himself that the
economic strain has not reached the breaking point,
and will not reach it t'.il the western front is flooded
with reinforcements from our shore.
We must make sure the northern fleet and western
line suffer no harm. Germany will try every plan to
cripple both. She will use every agency to achieve hsr
end. Every airplane and hydroplane improvement she
will make to reach across the sea, as well as nearer home.
She will, if. she can which is impossible stir up sedi
tion, make the weak-hearted lately brought to patriotic
solidarity repent them of their courage, induce the con
dition of mind among many which in 1S64 brought the
formation of a peace that came near Lincoln's undoing.
and rehabilitate that highly treasonable, intangible pacific
and pro-German sentiment that would divide the coun
try, make even the well-meaning cry for peace at any
price, and give Germany the chance she now desire. to
end the war to her own satisfaction and to the salvation
of the Hohenzollern face
I am betraying no confidence. I stand as one of a
hundred million people loyal to the government. I am
proud of the preparations we are .making to settle this
war on a sound and enduring foundation. I ask nobody
to take my word because it is my word, but I venture
to assert that' no man who has been at' the front under
such auspices as were mine will question the essential
validity of my position, or doubt that every American
should help in every way he can to end with all dispatch
this war. Buy Liberty bonds. Help the Red Cross.
Stand by the Y. M. C. A. Brand every slacker with
the sign of slackerism. Create in your community such a
sentiment as will, enable the government to get men
properly prepared and adequate provisions over to the
front as soon as possible. America holds the future in
her hands.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
BACKING UNCLE SAM
In times of prace my robes are rent
o'er every statesman's blunder; I
clamor that our government for bone
heads. Is a wonder. O'er censress then
I rip and snorf, to wrathful frenzy
driven; it is a harmless Indoor sport,
to which most men are given. It
doesn't jar our Uncle Sam, this pes
simistic harping; he doesn't care a
tinker'3 jam for criticism carping. In
times of peace such talk will go, no
voter it disgraces; it serves to let our
s'atesmen know that we are keeping
rases. But when our country's in a
fight, and loyalty's essential, how
coed men hate the grouchy wight,
with dirges penitential! Now, I am
barking Uncle Sam. though all' thei
grouches hoot me; and I am silent as
a clam if things dfln't chance to suit
me. I still am talking much, by
Ungs. but talking circumspectly; my
Uncle Sam is doing things, and doing
them correctly. My Uncle Sam is
wise and great and all he does is
proper; and I detest the sort of skate
who's a disloyal yawper.
TIGHTENING.
GEORGC y DE KNOWS.
George Ade is known the world over in fable and
song and for his laugh-producing sayings, but every once
in a while George turns seriously to some big question
and he did so when he said, in speaking of the war:
"President Wilson was right when he said that the'
world must be made safe for democracy. The American
people have no desire to destroy Germany or prevent
it from regaining commercial importance. They want
Germany to restore the stolen property and go home
in a chastened mood. They want to jam the knowledge
into every close-cropped Prussian head -that just because
a man owns a high-priced automatic gun and. has lot3
of ammunition and a college education he has no right
to go out and shoot up his neighbors. The American
people are hoping to make it clear to the kaiser and the
crown prince and the various square-jawed Hindenburgs
that it is highly improper to form a partneashlp with
God for purposes of murder, and then treat God as a
silent partner. As to the final outccme, the battle of
the Marne was the beginning of the end. For 200 years
all the big events of history have marked an irresistible
advance toward the establishment of democracy. When
the Germans failed in their mad rush of 1914 it meant
that an all-wise Providence and the laws of evolution
were not to be thwarted by a military despot with a brist
ling mustache. Germany cannot win and therefore Ger
many must lose. The t-nd of bloodshed and sacrifice
and widespread terror will come as soon as the United
States of America begins to strike aggressive blows.
The more men we send to the front the fewer we will
lose. Our greatest enemy at present is Indecision. Our
strongest ally is Speed. Our most needful watchword
is Faith. We are going to end the war and then sit at
the council table to repress greed and curb injustice."
Here's hoping that John Purroy Mitchel wins the
New York mayoralty contest. His patriocsm and hon
esty are beyond all question. None of his opponents
can compare to him in the matter of eminent fituess
for the place. Patriotism should be an issue in every
election held in this country during the term of the
war for any office, city, legislative, executive or con
gressional." Party lines and politics should be promptly
wiped out if either candidate's patriotism has the least
blemish or stain.

the following to say in reeard t" the
mining prospects if John S. Williams
or tnis city: The old gold vein in
the Mammoth mine at Casa Grande has
been found and a generous vein of
$20 gold has been located, it was re
ported yesterday, with indications that
the lead will run a thousand feet, al
though this is doubted by Macia and
Williams, partners working the prop
erty. The ore is all free milling. A
mill has been designed to handle ton
nage, for it cannot be shipped 25 miles
at the present values. The Mammoth
once produced about $200 of good gold
values and then pinched out on the
bedding planes in schist. Apparently
the vein is permanent. Macia and
Williams went down under a 15-foot
fault and picked up the old vein and
developed 30 inches of ore. The Mam
moth is located between the Lake
Shore and the Jack Rabbit. There Is
considerable location work going on
around the district of Casa Grande, it
was reported yesterday.

IN BIG RETREAT
(By Review Leased Wire.)
ROME, Nov. 2. Describing the
events of the Iltalan retreat on Octo
ber 27 and later, a correspondent of
the Associated Press says General Gon
zaga was transported to Udine, suffer
ing from eleven wounds. All his stafl
officers were killed 'jr wounded and
only three of his fifty horsemen es
cort remained alive. General Badog
lie, with his Bersaglieri, stood on Ma
tajur, the new Thermopylae of the
Austrian offensive, commanding the
line from Caporeto to Cividale, fight
ing without hope but also without the
idea of surrender. Of three regiments
of Bersaglieri only one lieutenant re
mained alive and he was wounded.
The correspondent describing the ex
odus of the fugitives says they com
prised people of all classes In automo
biles, in vehicles of all epochs and ox
en drawn carts. Wrae persons trans
ported their belonging in hand carts
while other carried them. There were
women with half naked children in
their arms and others crying or beating
their .beasts because they had lost
their children in the confusion.
Halt and Blind.
There were wounded and there were
aged or sick being carried by relatives.
Some of the carts bore all the humble
furniture of a household. Here and
there a donkey or mule passed, loaded
with all the kitchen utensils of the
family. The girls of some families
carried with the greatest of care their
shoes in baskets, tramping along in
the wooden clogs that are worn in
these parts. Here was to be seen, a
man running away in full evening
dress; there a woman in evening toil
ette, wearing white evening slippers.
A heavy rain added to the miseries
of the refugees, i FoJt passengers
made quicker progress than those in
motor cars as the latter about every
ten yards were forced to stop for naif
an hour owing to the crush. After six
long, weary hours the band of refugees
with whom the correspondent was pi
ceedlng had made only six miles, in
rain and a strong, cold .wind which
chilled everyone to the marrow.
Pet Taken.
Many persons carried pets with
them. Dogs and even cats frequently
were seen and a soldier was observed
who with great difficulty was keeping
his cloak about him, sheltering a tiny
puppy. Some women in ox carts had
geese and others fowls with them.
At Riano, a small village before
Codroipo, there were a score of enemy
airplanes circling above the fugitives.
From a small church a group of young
girls in white dresses came out. having
just made their first communion.
Crossing the Tagliamento river the
fugitives reached Pordenone, where
there was nothing to eat and nowhere
to sleep until a stable boy took the
correspondent and some of the fugi
tives to his house which was three
miles from the town. Next mornjng
enly black coffee was to be had. No
bread or eggs and still less butter
could be purchased. After a long
search s'ome small tablets of chocolate
were discovered for which the party
paid seventy-five cents for each little
packet and a half dozen biscuits at
twenty-five cents each. , J

Roads Clogged
At daylight Sunday the vast traffic
of the retiring multitude clogged the
roads for milts. The Red Cross au
tomobile party expected to make ;W
miles inside of two hours, but it de
veloped that it would take at least
two days to achieve this distan-e.
The withdrawal of the heavy guns
and the munitions supplies revealed a
' military genius of the highest order
but the civilian crowds added to the
difficulty of the huge military removal.
! A torrential rain increased the hard
i ships of the soldiers and added to the
misery of the women and children who
j had walked seemingly endless miles
' over the road and through the fields all
j night.
I Sunday morning, at a railway cross
ling, a steady succession of flat cars
! assisted in the removal of the artillery,
i The monster guns were mounted ou
double cars with a covering of boughs
j as a screen against air raiders. The
rain was providential as clear weath-
er ould have permitted the enemy
! airplanes to bombard the roads and
j block the withdrawal.
Many Wounded.
! Along the line of retreat were many
, wounded being carried on litters
through the deluge of rain. The Red
i Cross train took aboard one soldier
' with a shell wound in his arm. Sun
day night this car made only fifteen
miles. In twenty-four fjurs tt readi
ed a town where the wounded mau was
taken to a hospital.
Military occupied the town and there
was no food to be hud. The mayor had
posted a proclamation ordering strang
ers away. '
An Italian officer offered to permit
the correspondent .to sleep on the
straw at the barracks, but later a place
was obtained in lae stall of a stable
adjoining a hotel.
Monday morning the Red Cross par
ty crossed the Tagliamento river.
'which at this pjlnt is about 500 yards
wide.
Another fifteen , miles consumed
twelve hours of riding through appar
ently unending masses of soldiers,
horses, cann'jn and i.he impediments of
the army. The men soaked and be
draggled, but calm and cheerful, were
not heard to utter a single word of
complaint since they began their exo
dus through fifty miles of moving
masses. All telegraph facilities were
closed along the road.
Monday night the Red Cross car ar
rived at the new headquarters.- Here
the correspondent's no-.es must end as
all subsequent movements f the army
are not be described for the present,
owing to military necessity.
The correspondent's recital is only
one chapter and thousands of other
persons had similar experiences in the
withdrawal. However, above all the
hardship and terror of the incident, the
fact stands out that the Italian army
succeeded against terrible orders in
saving the larger part of its ammuni
tion, supplies, and artillery as well as
virtually the entire personnel.

made it difficult to catch a glimpse of
the Gothas, which were soaring at

DURING HUN DRIVE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
GENEVA. Switzerland, Nov. 2.
Swiss soldiers stationed on the Alpine
heights on the frontier in the canton
of Grizons report that since the Ger
mans captured I'dine the number of
troop trains going lu the direction of
Trent has been doubled. The Swiss
troops say tiiat when the heavy .artil
!;'ry trains are passing the Germans
make siL'jke curtains at exposed points
to prevent the number of guns being
ascertained by on lookers. The Swiss
soldiers declare there Is every evi
dence that the Germans were surpris
ed by their success against the Italians
but in '.end to take every advantage of
t: e situation and are preparing to en
trench on the Tagliunicnto, as they did
on the Maine, ln the event of a failure
in their forward movement.
