127 KILLED BY
QUAKE IN ITALY
ROME, June 30. (By the Associ

Tuscany Sunday caused the deaths of
127 persons and injuries to several
thousand, according to the latest ad
vices from Florence. The center of
seismic movement apparently was
Vicchio, a town of about a thousand
inhabitants 40 miles northeast of Flor

Among the victims at Vicchio,
which suffered severely, were the lo
cal doctors. The railway station.
churches and factories at Borgo ban
Lorenzo, north of Vicchio, . were de
stroyed.
Airplanes have been sent in au ai
rections along the Appenine moun

some regions may have been isolated
by destruction of all meana of coih-
munication.
All relief effnrta are bem? centered
at Florence, Arezzo, Muzelle tnd
Siena. Arezzo is about 45 miles south
east of Florence and Siena is about
the same distance south. Speedy re
lief in the damaged area, it is resort
ed, is rendered somewhat difficult be
cause of the scarcity of supplies ana
lack of transportation facilities," be

AIMS BACK OF
Hitchcock Scouts Charge of
Borah That International
Bankers Back Taft
WASHINGTON. June 30. The
League of Nation covenant and the
influences at work to secure its ac
ceptance by the United States fur
nished the vehicle today for another
long debate in the senate.
Renewing his charge that interna
tional bankers are sponsoring the
League for selfish purposes Sena
tor Borah, Republican of Idaho,
charged that Thomas W. Lamont, a
partner in the Morgan banking
house, had purchased the New York
Evening Post as a part of a propa
ganda to force senate acceptance of
the covenant. He charged ' the
League to enforce Peace, headed by
former President Taft. also was con
trolled by the bankers.
Senator Hitchcock, Democrat of
Nebraska, defending Mr. Taft and
his organization, replied that not on
ly business men but organized labor,
the churches, the farmers and the
people enej-ally -were demanding
ratifies of the covenant ! -
Every oi." popular opinion that
had beet. us:en anywhere, he said,
had shown an overwhelming senti
ment for the League.
The League covenant was defend
ed also by Senator Gerry, Democrat
of IJhode Island, in a speech declar
ing it the only hope of Europe dur
ing reconstruction, and was attacked
by Senator Fall, Republican of New
Mexico,' who declared he could not
vote for its ratification without vio
lating his oath as senator.
Many others were drawn into the
debate, which occupied virtually the
entire day's session.
An argument over Ireland' place
in the League was started by a state
ment by Senator Borah that article
10 of the covenant would enable
Gerat Britain to call on other na
tions to help crush any movement
for Irish freedom. , The assertion
was denied by Senators Walsh, Dem
ocrat of Montana, and Phelan, Dem
ocrat of California, who declared ar
ticle 10 applied only to international
aggression.
Senator Poindexter, Republican of
Washington, suggested that if any
outside nation aided an Irish revolu
tion as France aided the colonies
In 1776, the act could be construed
as external aggression and all other
league members called on to help
subjugate Ireland.
Senator - Borah declared there was
no consolation in the fact that de.
cisions of the council and asesmbly
must ?be by unanimous vote to be
binding.

SEEK RELEASE
EL PASO, June 30. Immediate,
discharge from the army is asked
by 406 non-commissioned officers and
enlisted men of the 82nd field artil
lery, stationed here, which they for
warded to Washington tonight. The
signers, according to men who circu
lated the petition, represent virtually
every member of the regiment who
enlisted for the war emergency, and
the petition is based on the fact
that, the treaty of peace having been
signed, the war emergency no. longer
exists.
The petition is addressed to the
senate and house military v affairs
committee and was mailed to the
chairman of those bodies.
Referring to conditions on the
Mexican border, the petitioners de
clare: " We are reminded of the
unsettled conditions . prevailing on
the Mexican border. We wish to
bring to your attention the offer of
Governor Hobby, (of Texas) of two
brigades of troops, 7,000 men, for
border service. The refusal of this
offer indicates the war department's
intention to hold ua for all emergen
cies arising along the border, eyen
though our enlistments have ex
pired." "Conditions on the border are such
that it is impossible to discharge the
men enlisted for the war emergen
cy," said Brigadier General James B.
Erwln, commanding the border dis
trict, tonight.
The general declared line units in
this region were far below their full
strength and that enlistments for
these bodies were coming in slowly,
though enlistments for 'the specialty
branches were being received rap
idly. Arizona Railroads

WACKY OF SECRET SERVICE IS
BLAMED FOR BOMB THROWERS' ACTS
BY RICHARD SPIT-LANE
Noted Economist, Who Writes on
on Business, Financial and Kindred
Topics for The Daily Review.
The apparent ease with which ter
rorists ship infernal machines about
the country or plant them at tne homes
of persons they wish to destroy has
been a shock to the counyy. YVirfcin
the last four years there have been
more crimes which, for want of a more
specific term may be termsd dynamite
outrages, .than in the previous 400
years in America.
In the period preceding our entrance
into the war they were confined chiefly
to blowing up munition plants, de
stroying ships by explosions and
wrecking piers, wharves and termi
nals. Tnese were ascribed to agents
of the German government. Since the
armistice there has been a centering
of these attacks on prominent per
sons active in some phases or gov
ernment. Considering the large number of
crimes of tnis .character there have
been few arrests. The authorities
charged with the protection of citi
zens have been unable apparently to
combat the criminals.
How long is this to last?
There was a time when the secret
service of the United States had a
high reception for efficiency. The
record of the last few years would
seem to indicate that there has been
a complete breaking down in this high
ly important branch of the govern
ment service.
Very few of the German agents of
destruction operating in this country
Were apprehended. None of the ter
rorists busy since the armistice was
signed has been caught.
In England and France there has
been no such epidemic of this charac
ter as has been witnessed in the
United States. In those countries
there is a highly organized force of
detectives and a close watch is kept
on all persons suspected of nihilistic
tendencies. Here' the detective is not
so highly trained and the whole police
system, municipal, state and national,
is much less efficient.
It would not be difficult to round up
the agents of destruction and terror if
a competent body of secret service
men was organized. This was demon
strated by the independent work done
by a newspaper and a commercial or
ganization in one of the pricipal cities
of America.
There had been attempts to blow up
the homes of distinguished citizens of
that city and the newspaper and the
commercial organization, without
knowledge of the intention of each
other, began investigations. Tbe news
paper assigned reporters to the task,
and the commercial body employed
private detectives. Within a month
or so the agents of the two concerns
held membership in the so-called so
viet. They had full lists of the mem
bers, reports of all the speeches made
at the secret meetings, copies of all
the literature circulated through de
vious channels by the leaders and a
statement of receipts and disburse
ments of the soviet. The names and
addresses of most of the members
were in their possession and practi
cally every bit of evidence necessary
V to prove the character of the leaders
and their aims toward destroying the
government had been gathered. -
These agents still remain unsus
pected members of the terrorist : or
ganization. " All the literature they ob
tained, all the reports tney made, an
the transcripts of incriminating
speeches and conversations they ob
tained have been turned over to tne
government, but so far as Is known
have not been used.
If independent workers can accom
plish this much it is strange the gov
ernments supposedly skilful detec
tives cannot do more. Apparently they
can not " In fact the various branches of
the secret service ihave shown such
Incapacity, neglect -and - general stu
pidity In the last few years that there
is likely to be a demand for thor
ough, reorganization of the body.
There is a basis for suspicion that
some persons In . Wae-hington have
chilled the energies of investigators
and that the influence of German
propaganda reached into unsuspected
circles in wartimes. Possibly the
same unsuspected circles in Wash
ington exert the same suppressive
power today on the secret service
men. -
How potent there persons are may
be judged from the following:
Report was made to Washington
that a man of some notoriety as an
agitator had threatened the life of
the president and that he was in
Washington and had been placed in
a government position of responsibil
ity. The names of a dozen persons
who had heard his violent utterances
against the president were furnished.
Among them were the commander 01
a Ki. A. It, post, a ciaiiiom "
army,' a well known lawyer and other
persons of prominence.
Pmm the Washington official to
whom the report was made the reply
came that the informant was in er
ror. The man was not i Washing
ton and not in the government ser
vice. .
The pomDlalnant thereupon stated
that the man was at a. prominent ho
tel in Pennsylvania Ave. and his ap-
nointment to an important govern
ment position had been confirmed by
various of his relatives and associ
ates.
The Washington official insisted
the complainant was wholly mistak
en as an investigation had been made
which .had shown the man was not
at the hotel or in the government
service.
. . The complainant thereupon notified
the Washington official that unless
the official would assure him there
was reason for hiding the facts about
the person in question the whole af
fair would be made public through
the newspapers, for the agitator was
at the hotel, was In the government
service and still was uttering threats
against the president If the presi
dent should be assassinated by this
agitator, the complainant pointed
out, the Washington official would be
a party to the crime.
. Thereupon the Washington official
telegraphed that a mistake had been
made by his stenographer, as a letter
which was on the way . would ex
plain. The letter showed the official
was much agitated and promised ac-

tion.
That was the last the complainant
heard from the official but a few

GOOD BALL GAME
In the presence of a large crowd of
fans, who were kept on edge
throughout nine innings of an excit
ing see-saw contest, the Lowell base
ball team for the second time took
the measure of the dusky batsmen
of the Tenth U. S. Cavalry nine in
Wftrren Park Sunday afternoon.
The final score was 9 to 7. but the
lead switchpd several limes during
the game, keeping the spectators in
doubt as to the outcome until the
last man was put out in the caval
rymen's half of the ninth inning.
From the standpoint of close and
spectacular plays the game was an
excellent one, of a kind , which fur
nished the fans plenty of excitement
and gave them ample opportunity to
exercise their rooting powers. " But
an otherwise fine exhibition was
marred, unfortunately, by constant
"beefing" by the players on both
sides. That such tactics are not pop
ular with the fan3 was evidenced by
the demonstration of disapproval
from the stands which greeted the
protests made on the field.
In mitigation of the "kicking."
however, stands t out the . fact that
the umpiring, on both sides, was of
a variety to call forth the ire of the
veriest bush-league, team and nei
ther the Lowell not the. Tenth Cav
alry team play ball of the bush
league brand.
One of the principal protests, yes
terday was against the crippled
pitcher for the cavalrymen employ
ing a base runner. It is stated that
before the game an agreement was
reached between the teams that if
the cavalry heaver was able to pitch
he was also able to run bases, so the
subsequent argument is one which
the fans might well have been spar
ed. .
Next Friday, Saturday and Sunday
there will be a series of games be
tween the Lowell and Bisbee teams
and the 25th Infantry team from No
gales, so that some interesting
games are promised for these days.

Story of NumHer SO
i - .
40 yeare ago an old doctor was put
ting up a medicine for disease of the
blood, that cured the worst cases of
specific blood poison, and time proved
that the cures were permanent. After
many years I secured the prescription
(being a druggist), and took each in
gredient separately and referred to my
U. S. Dispensatory and other authori
tative books on medicine and found
the medical properties set down ' as
follows: "Employed In diseases of the
glandular system, in blood poison,
scrofula, constination, stomach and
liver troubles, chronic rheumatism, ca
tarrh, Jn sores, ulcers, skin eruptions,
mercurial and lead poison. Under Its
use nodes, tumors and ' scrofulous
swellings that have withstood all other
treatment disappear as If br magic.''
To commemorate my fortieth year as
a druegist I named this medicine

question. that cavorts .under

"who dVe think will win the

, THE FRUITS OF BOLSHEVISM
EVERY INDIVIDUAL bit of real information regarding
what is going on in Russia shows that Bolshevism has re
sulted in less freedom, instead of more freedom? except for
the Bolshevist leaders and their mercenary army.
In view of the cry of the Bolshevists in America for "free speech,"
the situation in Russia is all the more startling.
In "A letter to American Workingmen" by Lenine. published in
the Liberator of January, 1919, Lenine makes the following state
ments: "While the old burgeois and democratic constitution, for
instance, proclaimed formal equality and the right of free
assemblage, the constitution of the Soviet repudiates the hy
pocracy of a formal equality of all human beings . . .
, Since we here are concerned with the task of overthrowing
the burgeoisie, only fools or traitors will insist on the formal
equality of the burgeoise. . . . Our Soviets have taken
over all usable buildings in the cities and town out of the
hands of the rich and have placed them at the disposal of the
workmen and peasants for meetings and organization pur-.
poses." 1
In an article in the Bolshevist organ, Pravda, republished in the
Liberator of September and October, 1918, Lenine said:
"The nearer we get to the complete military suppression
of the burgeoisie the more dangerous become for us the petty
bourgeois anarchic inclinations. And these inclinations can
not be combated only by propaganda and agitation, by the or
. ganization of emulation, by the selection or organizers; they .
must be combated by compulsion.
The following decree, Issued by Zinoviev and published in the
Bolshevist organ, the Northern Commune of Sept, 13, 1918, shows the
conditions under which meetings may be held:
1: AH societies, unions and asosciations political, ec
onimic, artistic, religious, etc. formed on the territory of the
Commune of the Northern Region must be registered at the
corresponding Soviets or committees of the village poor.
2: The constitution of the union or society, a list of
founder and members of the committee, with names and ad
dresses, and a list of all members, with their simes and ad
dresses, must be submitted t at registration.
3: All books, minutes, etc., must always be kept at the
disposal of representatives of the. Soviet power for purposes
of revision.
4: Three days' notice must be given to the Soviet, or to
the committee of the village poor, of all public and private
meetings.
5: All meetings must be open to the repersentatives of
the Soviet power, viz.: the representatives of the Central
and district Soviet, the committee of the poor and komman
datur of the revolutionary police force.
6: Unions and societies which do not comply with these
regulations will be regarded as counter-revolutionary organi
tions and prosecuted, ',
Reading this decree 'in connection with the declaration of Le
nine, it is easy to see why ithere are no public meetings of protest
against the Bolshevist rule. This decree reminds those who knew
Russia in the past of the suppression of free speech under the czar.
' Light is shed upon the results of this decree by a quotation from
Pravda cf Au,?. 6, 1918. (Pravda, according to Max Eastman of the
Liberator, is the "Bolshevist organ.) A passage reads:
"Kazan, August 4th. The Provision Congress of the So
viets of the peasants has been dissolved because of the ab
sence from it of poor peasants AND BECAUSE ITS STATE
OF MIND IS OBVIOUSLY COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY."
If a Soviet Congress is dissolved because it does not agree wltn
the Bolshevists rulers, Vhat chance would an ordinary meeting
stand?
Evidently, "freedom of speech" in Russian means freedom to
Lenine and his asosciates.
JESUS WENT INTO THE FISH BUSINESS
BY THE REV. CHARLES STEL2LE.
II have no time to'go into the soup business for the sake of the
soup," said a church official, in discussing furnishing soup to
hungry men and women.
Well, I'd like to remind this amiable official who not only
had all the soup he needed but about everything else that makes men
contented so far as material things go I'd like to remind him that
Jesus went into the FISH business when he fed the five thousand
who were hungry.
Nor did JesUs heal the sick that they might come to hear Him
preach; he healed them because he had compassion on them and be
cause they needed healing.
It shouldn't be much of a degredation for pne who says he is fol
lowing in ths footsteps of Jesus to hand out soup to hungry men,
women and children just becaues they're HUNGRY!
"Give ye them to eat!" was the command of Jesus to His disci
pies.
It's a fortunate thing for the church that this official did not ex
press its real position on the question of caring for the hungry.
The church has served the unfortunate in this world conflict with
out thought as to whether those assisted were members of the churcn
or whether they ever intended to become such.
Their need was their passport Into the hearts of the representa
tives of the church who were in a position to serve and serve they
did, to the uttermost. -
But let the whole church be warned that in the new day that's
to come, at such fearful sacrifice, it must not fail to take into account,
the physical needs of the people.
LET NEW YORK BE CONSOLED
(Kansas City Star)
THE'KAST. particularly New York simply can't believe that
such a thing as prohibition is possible. And if it is possible,
a large share dI' the population doesn't really see how it is to
continue to iive and do business.
As a result of the experience of living next door to prohibition
Kansas for good many years. The Star begs leave to reassure the
panic stricken frequenters of Broadway and Fifth Avenue. They
will really be surprised to find how easy it is to adjust themselves
to the absence of booze. There are towns in Kansas of considerable
size where an entire rreration has grown up without knowing any
th'iig. about, cqjiils or even mint juleps. And nobody thinks any
thing about it! , ' .
A person can vet along without eating lobster or shadroe if he
puts his mind to it. . He doesn't riot because they happen to be ab
sent from the' bill of tare. New York will find it much the same when
booze is uiihsings.

CAMPING TRIP
Finds Beautiful Scenery . in
Mogollon Mountains;
.- Fishing Excellent
Attorney John Mason Ross returned
Sunday from an interesting camping
trip in the Mogollon mountains with
his family and a party of friends.
They report an enjoyable time on
Iron Creek and other streams in the
Mogollon mountains, reaching there
partly by auto and partly with horses
and on foot at a point about ninety
miles from Silver City, wnere trout
fishing was abundant with the finest
specimens from these streams 8000
high at the head streams of the Gila
river. There were plenty of wild tur
key and some deer seen.
The hunting season does not open
until the 1st of October but many
sportsmen have already made arrange
ments to hunt in this section for the
two weeks while it will remain open.
Mr. Ross was very enthusiastic
about the scenery of tne Mogollon
mountains and the streams, compris
ing the largest unbroken area re
maining in this country. The return
trip is a gradual slide of about 5000
feet to Silver City with an unbroken
wild area of the finest scenery in the
country.
. Especially to be mentioned, says
Mr. Ross, was the new Burson road
which connects Socorro and Magde
lena with Silver City; a shorter route
to the mountains -which when com
pleted will afford easier access so that
it can -be used without taking the
longer route. Mr. -Ros expresses his
opinion that, this road when complet
ed will be one of the biggest improve
ments in Western New Mexico.

LOVE WORTH $100
PHOENIX, June 30. A case of love
that can stand the test was developed
late yesterday when the; sweetheart of

money order coming in less than an
hour after the appeal by wire to the
girl had been made. She lives in Los

happened.
Dr. Gottheff and Dr. Towhsend ques
tioned him gravely. Kirk Moore ask
ed a few humble questions of the
Great Wizz, and everrone -wos satis

Judge Pattee he had nofhad a perma
nent residence for a long time. He
had been mostly a resident of Nebras-
' ka City, Neb., Buthe had wandered
; through the southwest, going from
I Denver to El Paso and had been a resi
j dent of Tucson for a month; used
neither liquor or tobacco, and he knew
no drugs.
Xfrott was arrested at the request
of the department of justice after he
demanded a passport to Mexico.
CHINESE MURDERED
TUCSON, June 30. Lou Tai Leong,
a storekeeper at 22nd street and 11th
avenue, was brutally assaulted at 2:30
Friday morning while asleep in his
store, and died about and hour and
a half later at the Arizona hospital.
One side of his head had been crushed
by a powerful blow from a two-by-four
timber, five feet long. The assailant
was seen leaving the premises by Low
Eng. another Chinaman, who was
sleeping in the yard at the back of
the store.
Low Eng opened fire with a revol
ver but the murderer escaped to his
automobile and drove away. He was
unable to give a description of the
man. A considerable quantity of
goods was taken from the store.
As the result of the murder, the
Chinese residents of the city posted a
reward of $600 for a clew leading to
the arrest of the assailant.
COCOPAH INDIAN ASK
FOR DEATH PENALTY
TOMBSTONE, June 30. When
John Johnson, a Cocopah Indian con
victed of murder of the medicine man
of the tribe, was sentenced by Judge
Sawtelle in the federal court Tuesday
afternoon and received life imprison
ment, he requested that the punish
ment be made death, at the same time
asserting his innocence.
Judge Sawtelle told him that he
could not be sentenced to death, be
cause the jury had selected that he
should not be.
"Then I will kill myself.- declared
Johnson. i
"You must not do that," replied the
court.
Tim motive established bv the prose
cution for the murder was the failure
nf the medicine man. Joe Barley, to
stop the influenza epidemic which was
decimating the tribe, living near bom
erton, and employed on the farms.

MUST COMPLETE ONE
YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL
Tempe, Ariz., June 30, 1919.
To the Editor of the Silvet Belt:
I submit the following as an item
of information which may be of in
terest and benefit to your readers.
At a recent joint meeting of the
board of education ' 01 the' Tempe
normal school of Arizona and The
northern Arizona normal school,
with the state board ' of education,
the following action was taken,
which will be of greatest import
ance to parents contemplating send
ing their children to the normal
school.
After August 15, 1919, no students
will be admitted to either state nor
mal school until they have completed
one year of high school work, and af
ter August 15, 1920, it will be neces
sary that they have two years of high
school preparation, before entrance
into either normal school.
This action was taken afer careful
oensideration by the boards of edu
cation and the state board. It has
been recommended several times by
the state legislature but was post
poned from year to year on account
of the scarcity of high schools in the
state. It is now believed that the
high schools are so numerous and
that the special provision for estab
lishing two-year high school courses
in rur.il communities will adequately
provide for at least two years of high
school work. It was necessary, how
ever, to drop one year at a time in
order that no injustice might be done
to students who are now attending
either one of the state normal
schools.
Respectfully yours,
A. J. MATTHEWS.
President.
of the most surprising strikes in the
southwest. Representatives of the
United States bureau of mines have
been on the ground and presumably
had made reports to the bureau.
The open cut which was 30 feet
long a week ago, has lengthened to
more than one hundred feet and is
being extended, in ore, with an av
erage , depth of thirty" feet through
out and a width of from four to twen
ty feet,, from which the apparently
unattenuated body of high-grade ot
sustained value is being quarried in
huge blocks. More than 100 tons ot
high-grade has been banked on the
dump and is . being sorted to an av
erage value of 25. per cent copper.
Mine-run assays made by the Phelps
Dodge company give 0.74 gold, 3.66
silver and 25.55 copper, a total value
of $108.80 at. present .prices. The
values are: Gold, .$14.80; silver, $4
and copper, $90. The showing of sil
ver is much less than previous as
says, but the gold seems to maintain
the previous analysis.
Exploration in the old shaft, now in
a dangerous condition, indicate that
the early miners sank directly in a
horse, within three feet of the ore
on the north and south, for the min
eral seems" to have come up around
the horse an all sides. The shaft it
self shows silver glance in small in
dications, which probably encourag
ed thesinkers of the shaft to proceed
to the depth, about 150 feet. On the1
way down, at about 75 feet, a huge
boulder protruding slightly from the
sides walls was discovered yesterday
to contain high-grade copper glance
of equal value with the surface or pit
mining now under way. Had the ear
ly miners straightened the shaft, cut
ting into the boulder, they would have
found the ore they sought for below.
The discovery of the big body of
ore vindicates the geological knowl
edge of old Capt. John D. Burgess,
who died about a year ago, who at
the time he was consulting engineer
on the property, then owned by the
Hermosa Copper company, described
geological conditions that have been
uncovered by the present operators.
Captain Burgess suffered considera
ble in his later years from the criti
cism of some of the later engineers
of Tucson, criticism since refuted not
only in the new copper strike, but
in other districts.
National Guardsmen
Being Demobilized
EL PASO, June 30. A number of
field artillerymen of the 146th field ar
tillery, who formerly were members of
Battery 'A,' New Mexico National
Guard have arrived here and are being
demobilized.
It is. expected their demobilization
will be completed by Tuesday night.
Many of the men here were mem
bers of the New Mexico battery when
it was called to the border following
the Columbia raid three years ago, at
which time it established a record as
one of the best trained organizations
in the national guard. The battery
was complimented by regular army of
ficers then and set several records
for efficiency and jnilitary prowess.
These men mainly are from the New
Mexico Military Academy at Roswell.
A considerable number of other New
Mexico men joined the battery later
when the National Guard units were
called into federal service.

Mfning Engineer Back From
' Mexico - With Welcome
News for Arizona
Hoval A. Smith, one of the most
prominent mining engineers of the
southwest, returned yesterday on bis
way east from a ten days trip through
a large portion of the state of Sonora
and expects to return again to Bisbee
in about two weeks to make this city
his home.
Mr. Smith's family are at present on
the coast, but will return to Bisbee
in about two months.
Yesterday Mr. Smith stated that Be
was very well pleased with the re
sults of his trip which was taken in
the interests of some mining proper
ties which he is interested in and he
believes that the stage is all set in
Sonora both in mining and business,
for tremendous activity, now that
peace is signed and the league of na
tion established. He stated that the
processes of readjustment, in econom
ic affairs, have gone forward during
the past few months of waiting for the
consummation of peace.
"Confidence is in evidence all over
this country and Sonora. All classes
of people are expecting good times
and industries and business are flour
ishing." said Mr. Smith.
'There are many problems in So
nora. to be solved yet, it is true. The
solution will not be easy. It will be
some time "before full normality is re
stored in the mining industry, but not
so long as the pessimists would have
the country believe.
"At present there is no trouble for a
distance of 100 miles Telow our border
and no indication of trouble in the
near f utre. Further south around Her
mosillo, the Yaqui Indians have been
running around the country, but no
serious trouble has been experienced.
The Mexican authorities have been
able to eope with the situation in a
very satisfactory manner. The people
are not in sympathy with the bandit
elements and in fact, are quite incens
ed at the recent occurrences further
east. .
"The resources of Sonora are tre
mendous and the development of this
section will be of the greatest bene
fit to Arirona. : The transportation
problems are not serious and I have
always considered that this district
was one of the large feeders to Bis
bee. "I had some trouble getting through
the section along the Sonora river be
cause of the heavy rains but with
horses we managed very well. The
railroad - branch line from Esperanza
to Tonichi had been damaged to a
considerable extent by the Yaqui In
dians but the Mexican government is
putting in strong garrisons there to
prevent further trouble in this country
to the south.
"With 6ilver at $1.07 there is no
question but that this country will be
developed rapidly in the near future.
Five years ago we were getting 20 to
30 ounce rock while now we are get
ting 60 to 70 and with the immense
demaad of European countries which
is bound to come in the near future,
for supplies and materials of all kinds,
it is our duty to help develop this rich
country as well as to help the country
to a more stable form of government."
Mr. Smith was formerly chief engi
neer of the C. Q. property with the
Phelps Dodge Cor., and was largely in
terested in the early days in the devel
opment of the entire Warren District,
especially in the Rough Rider group
of properties, the Warren properties,
and the Warren Ranch. He is still in
terested in he Union Realty Co., the
Union Mines Co.. and the Warren
Ranch, so that his views of the south
west come frotn years of experiences
in this district. .

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 30. Trading in
stocks today occasionally was reminis
cent of the dullness and hesitation
which in pre-war times marked the
advent of the new fiscal year and
its attendant uncertainties.
Despite last week's better bank
statement, call money opened at 6 to
6V per cent, rising later to 8 for mix
ed loans and 10 for all industrials. In
dicating increased discrimination
against the latter form of collaterial.
The - new order created by the Ver
sailles treaty found no very clear re
flection in the course of quoted values,
aside from the sustained strength of
shares which have assumed a fixed
place among so-called peace indus
trials. Transportations shared only moder
ately in the day's movements except
ing Texas and Pacific. Rubber issues
related to the motor divisions extend
ed last Saturday's gains. Motors were
relatively backward. Food shares
came next in speculative favor.
Baldwin and American Locomotives,
Central Foundry, common and pre
ferred, Central Leater, Hide and Leath
er, preferred, American Woolen, Amer
ican Express and International Paper
were conspicuous among the other
strong stocks. Sales, 1,125,000 shares.
Bonds including Liberty and Inter
national issues, were inclined to ease
fractionally. Total sales, par value,
$10,800,000.
Olfl United States bonds were un
changed on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 30. Fresh strength
developed in the corn market today,
largely as a result of bullish estimates
as to the size of the domestic crop
this season. The close was unsettled,
ViC to lc net higher, with Septem
ber $1.76 to $1.76 and December
$1.54 to $1.54.
Oats finished c to lMc down.
In provisions the outcome varied
from 25c decline to 17c advance.
Estimates suggested by current fig
ures on acreage suggested . that the
1919 yield of corn in the United
States would fall 300,000,000 bushels
under the total for 1918. Demand was
further stimulated by the fact that
stocks in store were meager and that
the movement of new wheat seemed
likely to delay the handling of other
grains.
An unlocked for increase of the vis
ible supply total had a depressing ef
fect on the oats market.
Lower quotations on hogs deprived
provisions of any tendency toward a
decided advance. Commission nouses,
though, were conspicuous at times as
buyers of lard.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK. June 30. Cotton
closed steady at a net advance of 28
to 56 points. ' '
THE METAL MARKET
krw YORTC. June 30. Lead steady.

AUTO COLLISION '
YV. C. Wray of Douglas, driving a
Chevrolet car, collided with a Ford
last evening near Tintown and in the
mix-up in jural a little Mexican child,
which he immediately took to the)
hospital for treatment. He could
not escape running over the child,.1
be says, so turned into the Ford as
the safest means of saving a more se
rious Injury.
SOCIETY IN GENERAL
WAS DIFFERENT THEN
Objection having been raised by
Mr. J. P. Connolly to a passage in
the story of Sergeant Webb in last
Sunday's Review, fn which reference
is made to the alleged burying alive
of transgressors against church man
date in madiaeval times, the Review
wishes to state that the incident was
published merely as a legend told by
the people of the Frnch city of Bor
deaux aa to the occurrence which took
place in their city in the period bis
toriana describe as the "Dark Ages."
There was no Intention in the Re
views story to raise any question' of
church conduct in a remote period,
either Catholic or Protestant The
Review feels that no Protestant
would raise objection were mention
to be made of, the fact that Cotton
Mather was instrumental in the
wholesale burning of "witches" in
our own history of the Puritan pe
riod, and that all good church people,
of whatever denomination, realize
that In past tinjes those in authority
were far less gentle in enforcing
their edicts than is the custom to
day. HERE FOR SUMMER COURSE '
Among those who have registered
for the Elementary School Practice
teaching course at the Summer Ses
sion of the University of Arizona
which opens here this week are. Miss
Alice Sabln, Pomerene; Miss Sadie
Goodman, St. David; Miss Glvena
Lewis, Douglas; MIs Nettie Miller,

ASK SERVICE
TO PARADE
The regular meeting of the 4th of
Jury committee was held last evening
and the final arrangements for the
coming celebration were completed.
It was decided to extend an espec
ial invitation to the returned soldiers,
sailors and marines to participate in
the parade as the committee had been
requested many times during the past
few days by the people ot Bisbee to be
sure and have the tnen parade, as they
wanted to see who the Cochise con.ty
men were.
-There was some discussion about re
arranging the order' of the parade but
aa armv retrulatinna a,i n wi.
: "itti by the troops who will take
iPart, It was found that such change
waiu noi oe eirected.
Everything will be free to the men In
uniform including the boxing matches
and the greatest : Interest is being
manifested in getting all of the men
out on this day. ' '
A number of ladies who wish to at
tend the boxing matches have inquired
If they would be permitted to attend
and the committee stated that a large
namber of tickets have already been
sold to the ladies and they are cer
tainly welcome to attend. Thla affair
is sot an old fashioned knock down
and drag out fight but a sporting pro
position all the way through which
any lady may feel at liberty, to take in.
Sheriff McDonald has agreed to act
as announcer for the day and will be
at the boxing match with. his deputies
so that order -will be maintained, and
a most interesting time is assured by
the committee.
