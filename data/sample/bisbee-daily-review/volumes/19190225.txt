Power Conway of Phoenix, and Major
William H. Brophy at a alnner and
reception given in honor of the re '
turned soldiers last night at the War
ren District Country club. More than
200 men of the district heard the talks.
Colonel Greenway, still the Arizonan
of former "Captain Jack" days, his
voice a little affected dt gasing, but
the soldier throughout, spoke for two
hours, relating the story of "Bill Da
vidson, former Bisbee resident, wh'
went to within eight miles of the front
without a passport' and in civiliar
dress, describing his own experiences
at the front, speaking in praise of .
men from this state in France, and
giving brief personal glimpses of the
heroism of the American fighting man.
A tribute to the platoon leader and uis
squad of ieariess followers, a call for
immediate disarmament of the Ger

Americans, and a brief sketch of .

two days before the Rough Rider''
death, were the features of his ad
dress. "Dougboys Won War"
"The men who won the war," de
clared the colonel, patiently, "were ot

platoon leaders, the men who jammed
forward with their squads and ma

f ightforward the American doughboj . J
It was his indomitable spirit and cour
age, his will to do and win, that car
ried him and his armies to victory."
Colonel Conway came all the way
from PhoenIx to Bisbee to attend tin
reception last night, that be might

district's claim, possession of Colonel
Greenway and Major Brophy. He
came, in addition, he said, to tell the

as a civilian, stowed himself away on
the transport and without deception
of mouth, went jo the front with Colo-1

"Have you had enough of that Da-

APRIL LOAN TO
BE FOR 5 BILLION
Bill Providing for Short Term
Notes to Be Called
Up Today
fBv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24. The Vic
tory Liberty loan to be floated late in
April is expected to be for five bil
lion dollars, the house ways and
means committee reported today in
submitting legislation authorizing sale
of short term notes instead of bonds.
After the ways and means commit
tee had reported, the treasury author-
, ized the statement that the five bil-
liens mentioned by the committee as
the possible size of the Victory loan
was not necessarily exact, since the
amount would not be determined fin-
a:iy uy me treasury iur a iuuma una ;
a half. The size taen wa depend
on government expenses which cannoi
be forecast accurately for the next
month or more.
The committee estimate was based
on the assumption that expeditures
for the fiscal year ending next July
first, would be $19,000,000,000, which
is five billions more than the estimat
ed receipts of $14,000,000,000 exclusiv
of the yield from the Victory loan.
Explaining the provision in the pro
posed bill for seven billion of notes.
the committee report said
The treasury department and the
committee believe- that out of an
abundance of caution we should autb
orize the issue of seven billions of
notes. since the excess of five billion
dollars will doubtless be required early
in the next fiscal year."
While declaring the issuing of short
term notes instead of long term
bonds,' was preferable, the report
added:
"It is believed that such notes.
should it become advisable or neces
sary, can be converted at or before
maturities into long time obligations

gations were issued at the present

Senator Lewis Speaks in De
fense of League of Nations,
Replying., to Criticisms of
Borah; Is Given Applause
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24. The first
address in the senate in defense of i-e
proposed constitution of the League of
Nations was delivered today by Sena
tor Lewis of Illinois, democratic whip,
who took issues with the recent criti
cisms made by Senators Borah of
Idaho, republican, and Reed of Mis
souri, democrat.
Speaking for nearly two hours. Sen
ator Lewis denied contentions of op
ponents of the league that it wou.u
abrogate the Monroe doctrine, that it
was a departure from the principles of
Washington and Jefferson, that it
would dictate world armament and
that 'American would be out Voted by
the United Kingdom. An immense
audience listened intently to the
speech and uproariously applauded
when the Illinois senator concluded.
Senator Lewis' address is to be fol
lowed soon by many other discussions
of the league. Senator Owen of Okla
homa, democrat, and Cummings of
lowa republican, will speak Wednes
day and the debate is expected to
continue daily until congress ad
journs one week from tomorrow, sen
ator Sherman of Illinois, republican,
announced today that he would ma&e
an address Monday.
Referendum Proposed
In the house today Representative
Lundeen of Minnesota, repuolican, in
troduced a resolution proposing a na
tional referendum on the league to ue
called by the secretary or, state within
20 days after its formal submission
to the senate. Tlje proposal for an ex
pression of popular opinion on tne
league was referred to by &enato
lewis in concluding his remarks:
'It will be before the American peo
pie, the Illinois senator said. "The
peopie will pass on this document in
the form of a treaty through their
representatives. But it also wiu havs
the added advantage in that its s
tinguished champion will go to his
countrymen with the truth. And they
will approve his understandini", as
they have everything he has gone to
them. Yes, the people will decide."
Senator Reed spoke briefly when
Senator Lewis concluded. He said
that if the Illinois member's argument
was correct, th league would not hav j
the power to limit American armament
and that of allied countries.
. "If that is the case," he said, "the
chief argument for the league is with
drawn and the chief reason for its ex
istence does not appear to exist."
Lewis Digresses
Senator Lewis digressed greatly
from his prepared address. He ana
lyzed in detail the arguments of Sena
tors Borah and Reed and also declared
that in May, 1916, Republican Leader
Lodge had spoken in support of the
league plan.. Replying to the argument
that the league would contravene the
Monroe doctrine. Senator Lewis de
clare J that by the very plan ot
society the world would guarantee
that doctrine. He also declared there
was no ground for assertions that
kings and emperors would control e
league for assuming that the Central
and South American republics wou
be members on equality with British
colonies, the American republics could
out-vote the European nations.
"It must be plain. said Mr. Lewis,
"that senators have read this docu
ment in a way that greatly mislei
them."
Senator Lewis said he could not con
ceive or refuse to assume that we
principal Latin-American countries
would not have equal representation
with Great Britain's colonies and as
serted that senators had misconstruea
the league charter by assuming that
the executive council instead of e
league itself would control its policier
The Illinois senator also declared
nations could submit to the league
only questions which they considered
were matters for its jurisdiction.

GENEVA, Feb. 24. Prince Leopold,
former commander in chief of the Ger

Vailey. who killed Premier Eisner,
according to a dispatch from Munich.
The socialist government continues to
search the residences of members of
the former royal family and of the no-
oiuiy.
According to uncontirmed reports a
list of conspirators was discovered in
the home of Count Arco-Valley. A
former Bavarian prince is said to have j

banked high with flowers and wreaths
and a large portrait of the dead pre

crowds thronged there yesterday to
pay him silent homage.
The communists in Munich, des
patches say, are dissatisfied with the
decision of the socialists to restore
unity among the socialist parties and
have broken off relations with the so
cialist parties. The Communists, it
is added, plan to establish, a dictator
ship of the proletariat as a soviet
republic. .
The socialists have discontinued the

'"Governor Coolidge. Mr. Mayor,
Fellow Citizens: I wonder if you

to see you. It warms my heart to
see a great body of my felIow,cit

spects during the recent months I
have been very lonely indeed
without your comradeship and
counsel, and I tired at every step
of the work which M to me to re
call what I was sure would be
your counsel with regard to the
great matters which were under

makes me very happy to get homer

I was not very deeply touched by
the cries that tame from the great
crcwds on thfe other side. But I -want
to say to you in all honesty
that I felt them to be a call of
greeting to you rather than to
me.

"I did not feel that the greet

heart the overcrowding pride of
being your representative and of
receiving the plaudits of men ev
erywhere who feit that your
hearts beat with theirs in the
cause of liberty. There was no
mistaking the tone in the voices
of mose great crowds. It was not
a tone of mere greeting, it was
not a tone ot mere generous wel
come; it was the calling of com
raue to comrade, the cries that
come from men who say "we have
waited for this day when the

with us, to see that a new world

proudest thing I have to report to
you is that this great country ot
ours is trusted throughout the
world. I have not come to report
the proceedings or the results of
the proceedings of the peace con

ceived very happy imaressions
from this conference! the impres
sion that while there are many
ditferences of judgment, while
there are some divergences of ob
ject, there is nevertheless a con
mon spirit and a common reali
zation of the necessity of setting
up new standards of right iu the

"What wo are doing is to hear
the whole cause. Hear it from the
mouths of the men most interest

ficially commissioned to state it;
hear the rival claims; hear the
claims that affect new nationali
ties, that affect new areas of the
world, that affect new commercial
and economic connections that
have been established by the
great world war through which
we have gone. And I have been
struck by the moderateness of
those who have represented na
tional claims. 1 can testify that I
have nowhere seen the gleam of
passion. I have seen earnestness,
I have seen teams come to the
eyes ot men vho plead for down

privileged to speak for; but they
were not the tears at anguish,
they were the tears of , ardent

interest seeks out first .of all,
when it reaches Paris, the repre

tion in Europe that suspects tiie

then the next day said: 'Let right

America's Creed in

"America said: 'We set up a
light to lead men along the paths
of liberty, but we have lowered It.
it is intended only to light our

of liberty and then we said: 'Lib

we would leave. Do you realize
how many new nations are going
to be set up in the presence of old

and left there, it leit by us, with

Oppose Plan Narrow and
SelfisK ; Throws Down
Gauntlet in Boston Speech
(By Review Leased ire)
BOSTON. Feb. 24. President Wil
son will fight at home as he has fought
abroad for a league of nations.' Re
turning from France, he had been on
American soil not more than three
hours today before he threw down
the gauntlet to those who distrust the
proposed concert of governments bas
el, he said, ou the American idea.)
which had won the war for justice an;
humanity.
An America confining to her own
territories her conception and purpose
to make men free, he said, would hav.
to keep her honor "for those narrow,
selfish, provincial purposes which
seent 90 dear to some minds that have
uo sweep beyond their nearest hori
zon." Before a responsive audience that
filled the biggest auditorium in the
city, the president pictured the Old
World fighting with stubborn despera
tion, and expecting in the end to do
better for the peoples than they had
known for centuries. He pictured the
American people entering the lists
with a new purpose the freedom of
mankind.

said with apparent feeling, "and it is

An another point in his address, the
president said that if the great hope
of the world for a league of nation
was dirarp.)inted he would wish "for
my pat never to have had America

GOOD TO BE BACK

Declares Arizona Officer
On Arrival Here
"It's good to be back in Arizona.
It's fine to be back among friends. And
it's the best feeling in the world to
know that you have friends and that
you are with them."
In these words, Lt. Col. John C.
Creenway expressed bis satisfaction
at being back home and with the peo
ple who know him best and appreciate
him most. There is a light of satis
faction in the eye of the returned sol
dier from overseas and pleasure in his
countenance, although war's effects
are also apparent. There is a touch
of color in the hair that was cot there
when he lett Bisbee, a volunteer in the
cause of humanity, and there are lines
in his face that are new to his friends.
Hun gas and the rigors of campaign
and trench still show their effects, but
in spirit and manner he is the same
Jack Greenway, who put 'aside the
affairs of big business to enter upon
the greater affairs of mankind.
Orderly From Arizona
"Every man over there carries con
stantly in his mind and heart the
thoughts of some one or some place.
It may be a mother or a sweetheart
or it may be a home or a country, but
his mind is centered ppon one thing.
With me it was Arizona and 1 longed
constantly to be back here where I
feel that I belong and where I am at
heme.
T had an orderly with me in France
and he also was from Arizona. He
was more than an orderly to me ce
.as my caorn. We used to s.t at nignt
in a trench or perhaps out in tht, tor-;
est, no matter where we happened to .
be when there was a- let up in the
fighting. With the coming of night
our minds would travel together back
to Arizona and we would talk about
it together and reminisce in the most
delightful way.
"We were right where we wanted
to be over there, but cur hearts were
at all times back here And after the
armistice was signed and we were
both able, to journey back, we were
glad when the orders came returning
us to this our country.
Has Had Enough of War
"I have had enough of war. All that
I want."
Speaking of the army overseas. Col
onel Greenway is of the opinion that
the -men should be brought home as
quickly as possible. "The men want
to come back," he said. "They entered
the war for a high purpose and with
the signing of the armistice they feel
that that purpose is accomplished.
Their hearts are back here and they

are entitled to be brought back at the
very earliest day pratcicable.
Colonel Greenway not only feels
that the men themselves wish to be
returned, but he thinks it would be
the part of wisdom for the administra
tion to bring them back.
"However, the terms of the armis
tice do not permit this to be done at
once." he said. "Under the armistice
Germany has surrendered only about
40 per cent of her armament. So long
as she retains that other 60 per cent,
sEe i3 a menace to world peace and a
danger to Europe. The allies should
compel the surrender by Germany of
her remaining arms.
"Pull the fangs of the boche and
make Germany harmless and then the
allies can talk terms of peace with
some certainty. With the boche armed
and equipped 60 per cent, he is still
dangerous.
"America should insist upon the al
lies taking this step md tffen it will
be perfectly safe and proper for all
of the American army to be brought
back and the American soldiers re
turned to their homes."
Seeks Good Rest
"What I wish most of all at this
time is complete relaxation. That is
my entire plan for the present. I put
aside all 'business when I went into
the army and I am not going to re
sume it for some time yet. Rest and
relaxation are what I want and I am
going to have them."
TLe wisdom of this plan is appar
ent. It will be some time before Col
onel Greenway has fully recovered
from the experiences in battle. Al
though he was not wounded, he was
gassed and had an attack of pneu
mo'ia rnd the effects have not yet

Colonel Greenway modestly refrains
from talking at length about himse.f,
although he expected that he wouiu
be called upon at the dinner which he
as looking forward to with much
pleasure and said that he hardly
would be able to escape talking of
himself there. About others, however,
he was glad to talk.
"Young Frank Luke of Phoenix
made a name for himself that will
stand out among those of the American
army engaged in this war," said Colo
nel Greenway. "He was the second
ace among the American fliers and his
accomplishments in the air were the
talk cf not only the American army,
but along the entire front.
Colonel Greenway expects to leave

NATIONWIDE STRIKE
AVERTED AS MEN ARE
ORDERED TO RETURN
125,000 Affected by Agree
ment ; Employers Grant
Increase in Wages
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24. All work
men on strike in the New York build
ing trade dispute and all other sym
pathetic strikers were ordered back to
work tonight under an agreement
reached at a conference here between
representatives of the building trades
association, the union and the secre
taries of war and labor. It was.agreed
that all matters in dispute would be
placed before a conference committee
composed of three men selected by the
employers and three by the workmen.
All matters upon which the commit
tee fail to agree after three days
would be submitted to Judge Henry
P. Dugro, of New York city, whose
decision would be made within two
weeks and would be final.
An advance in wages was the only
question involved and the employers
were said to have expressed a will
ingness to concede an increase. The
men demand an advance of one dollar'
to $6.50 a day.
Approximately 125.000 men were in
volved in the strike, which threatened
to become nation-wide. It was esti
mated that 90 percent of government
construction would have been stopped
if the strike had spread.

1U.S. REGULATION OF

Measure Provides for Licens

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 24 Legisla-

oy tne senate agricultural committee,
which ordered reported the Kendricks
bill providing for regulation of refrig

In ordering a favorable report on

by the railroad administration and
Btock and refrigerator cars and for
government regulation of branch
plants.
The packers, under the bill." are giv

year extension on the time to dispose
of their stock yard interests.
The control of the stock yards, it is
contemplated, would be exercised by
other private concerns.
While the packers would be per

must be furnished to others In accord
ance with regulations to be Issued by

Recognizing the Soldier
One of the most meritorious features of the Hughes civil service
bill, introduced in the state. senate, is that it recognizes the man, or
woman, who has served the United States during the war with credit. Mr.
Hughes deserves the thanks of the soldiers, the sailors and the friends
of these men for his foresight, his candor and his inclination to cut
away from politics and adopt a reform that will, if passed, raise the effi
ciency in the state government many times.
T. A. Hughes is a business man. His home is in the Warren
district where he has lived many years, coming there from the town
of Clifton. He knows Arizona and Arizona people. He is not an
orator, nor a politician in the commonly accepted sense of the word,
but he is constructive in the legislation he desires passed by the state
of Arizona.
' The proposed measure would place Arizona in such a position that
all states would point with envy to its machinery of efficient govern
ment. To a very large extent the measure would take the administra
tion of the state government out of spoils politics.
Think of a business house that changed its corps of employes from
the chief down to the janitor every two years! How long would such
a business exist in the present day of keen competition and efficiency
standards. Yet that is the very thing the state of Arizona is doing
every two years and, sometimes, oftener. The efficient administration of
the business of the state of Arizona is just as much to be desired by the
tax payers as is their own business. When the force of state employees,
at th end of a two-year period, go out of their appointive -offices they
have just become efficient there. New men come in. They learn all
over and at the expense of the taxpayers.
Under the Hughes bill the employes of the state would be perma
nent. They would not be liable to every political wind th.. dances to
blow one way or another. There would be one test the employes
efficiency. Furthermore, the measure provides for promotions in the
service of the state. It contains strict provisions by which the service
will be kept out of polities'. The politician, office holder or aspirant for
office who solicits money from men or women holding jobs under the
proposed act, would be guilty of a crime and liable to severe punish
ment. Lastly, but no less important, is the fact that the soldiers, sailors,
marines and nurses, whw saw service under the American flag and who
were honorably discharged from it are remembered.
The clause dealing with this feature reads:
"Persons who were engaged in the military and naval service of
the United States, including members of the army nurse corps during ";5o
years 1898. 1S99, 1900, 1901 and 1917. 1918, 1919, 1920 and 1921, or en
gaged in any wars in the military or naval service of the United States
and who were honorably discharged therefrom shall be preferred for
appointment to civil offices, provided they are found to possess the
business capacity necessary for the proper discharge of the duties of
such office and it shall be the duty of the examiner or commissioner cer
tifying the list of eligibles who have taken the examinations provided
for in this act, to place the ns.me or names of such persons at the head
of the list of eligibles to be certified for appointment."
The Hughes bill is a good measure, built for the efficient manage
ment of the business of the state of Arizona. It should be passed.

France and Her Fears
France Is absolutely justified in insisting upon an organized inter
national force to back up the League of Nations. She .fears that,
if attacked by Germany, it. would be many months before. the other
nations could get their fighting forces in action, and France alone
knows the awful cost, in blood and treasure, of waiting for succor from
the nations. Nor, under stress of such fears, can France ever be what
she might otherwise be. -
But, at the peace conference, notably among the American repre
sentatives, there are opponents of this plan of France. These opponents
declare that an act of war by any nation against France would be
taken as declaration of war against all the other nations of the society
of nations. This might be true, but, from the standpoint of our
friend France, there is rflom for doubt as to efficacy of the arrange
ment and reason for consideration of details right up to the last point of -any
question as to the safety of France.
Peace treaties, league of nations pacts, etc., are on paper, which
may be "ecrapped." , Secondly, nations, are not going to be pl(inged
into war for other nations' weal by official say-so. The world has
learned what war is. It means service and suffering for all, from the
trenches right back to the baby in the cradle who needs milk. It means
death and mutilation at the fireside, in school, church, or office, as '
well as at the cannon's mouth. There is going to be loud demand
for popular referendum from the peopls of the interested nation."
when the next war goes to brewing. Indeed, how quickly Germany can
recuperate and attack France nobody at the peace table knows, at this
writing, and it would be quick death to France if attacked with immedi
ate and mighty aid from outside impossible. -
All this is not sayin? that France's plan is the right and only one.
There' is a plan, and we're going to call it Rooseveltian. It is to put.
it absolutely out of Germany's power to make war on Franse or any
body else. Take all her warships, save enough for mere police duty.
Prohibit her keeping a standing army, save one merely large enough
for police duty. Forbid her constructing submarines or airplanes
save such as are adaptable to comemrcial purposes only. Dismantle
her Krupp and other munition plants. In short, make it materially
impossible for her to make war.

Isn't this a reasonable profit?
It is what Swift & Company
in 1918.
earned
There seems to be some misapprehension among officials in Cochise
county a3 to the purpose of Pima county in issning bonds to complete
the road from Vail to the Cochise county line near Lenson. Some
Cochise county officials, with whom the wish is apparently father to the
thought, have taken it for granted that the purpose of Pima county is to
abandon the Borderland . rout from Vail through " Davidson Canyrm to
Huacbuca, Tombstone, Bisbee. This is not the purpose of Pima county in
making an appropriation for the construction of the Benson road. It
is to make that city, Willcox and other towns in the San Pedro and
Sulphur Springs valley more accessible to Tucson tl.at the money is being
expended on the Benson ro'ad. . ' -
The Borderland route will always be the one most used by tourists.
It i3 the most scenic of the two and the best in all weathers. Pima
county and the state have considerable work yet to do on the road in
Pima county in the vicinity of Barrel Canyon and near Empire ranch,
but the road is splendid for the greater part of its extent in this
county.
It is reported that work on the Borderland route three miles east
of Tombstone has been abandoned or is to be abandoned by' order of
the Cochise county supervisors. Such a course would be a breach of
faith with Pima county which expects Cochise to connect up with the
Borderland route. Many thousand dollars were expended on the road
through Davidson canyon and if Cochise county is to abandon the im-provt-nieut
of the 1 ordcrland. this expenditure will be partially lost.
If Cochise county persists in this policy of ditching the Borderland
route, the Chamber of Commerce here s-houid send a delegation to Tomb
stone and see if some arrangement cannot be made to carry out the
understanding that has prevailed for years, that the two counties would
co-operate in improMns the I'-ordeiiand rou'e acros-s southern Arizona.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Feb. 24. The most
popular reasons assigned for the fur
ther general advance of prices in the
stock market today were the several
indications of a restoration, in part
at least, of public confidence. This ac
cession seemed to be founded largely
on the decision of the government to
issue short term notes instead of a
long time bond loan, and better trade
reports.
Most of the stocks which forced last
week's market higher levels were again
to the fore today.
The outstanding features were Kelly-Springfield
Tire, Goodrich, U. S.
Rubber and General Motors at gross
gains of 3 to 6 points; Mexican Petro
leum 6 points. Sumatra Tobacco 6 and
Baldwin Locomotive 4.
The demand for rails was the most
varied of any recent period. Canadian
Pacific leading at a gain of 3, other
Pacitic, also grangers and eastern
shares rising 1 to 2 points. The mod
erate reversal at the close was primar
ily due to the rise in call money to 7
per cent for mixed collateral. Sales
amounted to 900,000 -shares, a record
f 'i i" t i ia vof '
Liberty bonds were active and
strong, foreign issues dull and the gen
eral railway and industrial list trregu
ar; Virginia 6's losing 1 per cent.
Total shares (par value) aggregated
11 ,275.000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on calL

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Feb. 24. Corn averaged
higher in price today owing chiefly to
the scantiness of the crop movement
cnl to predictions of unsettled weath
er. The market closed unsettled lc
off to lc up. with May $1.244 to
$1.34 and July $1.19l4 to $1.19.
Oats finished Vic down to a like ad
vance. Provisions gained 20c to S7c.
In the corn pit, the central fact ap
pears to be that rural holders gave no
evidence cf being inclined to sell, and
that on the contrary corn was still
being fed freely on the farms,
Oats were sustained by an impor
tant decrease of the visible supply
total.
In the provision market the stimu
lus of huge exports together with corn
strength operated more than an offset
for big receipts of hogs.
