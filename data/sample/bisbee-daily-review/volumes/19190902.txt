When the New Mexico, flagship of
Admiral Hilgh Rodman. passed
through the Golden Gate at the head
of 42 fighting ships of various types,
it found a bay dotted with small craft.
a phore line black with spectators
and the sky blurred with airplanes.
The old battleship Oregon, small in
comparison to Admiral Rodman's
dreadnaughts, but once probably the
most famous battleship in the world,
had the place of honor in the naval
raeeant. From the Oregon, Secretary
Daniels reviewed the fleet as it
passed on the port beam of the old
battleship.
As each of the 42 ships reviewed
passed the "bulldog," Oregon, and sa
luted the secretary with 19 guns, the
Oregon's band played a bar of the na

After the review. Admiral Rodman
and other officers of the fleet boarded
the Oregon to pay their respects to
Secretary Daniels.

MEXICO PUZZLE
Friends Diagree On Whether
Adam Shaefer, Murdered By
Bandits at Pinos Was Citizen
Of Mexico or United States
EL PASO, Tex., Sept. 1. Efforts
were being made tonight to learn the
nationality of Adam Schaefer, a min
ing man who was killed at his mine
at Pinos. Zacatecas. August 28. The
American Smelting and Refining
Company received a telegram from its
officials In Aguas Callentes. Mexico,
today statine that "Adam Shaeffer"
had boen killed at Pinos bv bandits.
It was announced at the office of the
smelting company that "Shaeffer"
was an American citizen although of
British descent. He had a mother
and sister living in Pittsburgh, accord
ing to Schaefer's brokers.
Investigation developed the fact
that Adam Schaefer, a mining man
having a gold-silver mine at Pinos,
Zacatecas, was well known here,
where he transacted his business
through local concerns. Herman An
dreas, who attended to his banking
account, stated he was an American
citizen. W. W. Stewart, formerly gen
eral manager of the Parral Light and
Power Company of Parral, Chihuahua,
for whom Adam Schaefer worked be
fore going to Pinos, said he was pos
itive Schaefer was a Mexican citizen,
having been born in Parral.
He said his father was Philip
Schaefer, a former resident of San
Antonio, Texas, who went to Parral
in the early days and who was him
self an American c'tlzen, but was
married to a Mexican woman, accord
ing to Mr. Stewart. The American
Smelting and Refining Company's min
ing officials, the American consul in
Juarez and friends of Schaefer were
telegraphing to Washington and Agus
Callentes tonight In an effort to estab
lish Schaefer's citizenship.
No details ' of Schaefer's killing
were contained in the brief telegram
received here today. The error In the
snrlllng of his name was attributed to
the transmission of the message over
Mexican wires. There is little doubt,
Schaefer's friends here say. that he
was the man killed in Zacatecas.

U.S. E
Recourse of Labor Is at Polls,
Postal Workers' Advised ;
Forming of 'Third Party' Also
Would Be Injurious, Warning
WASHINGTON, Sept. 1. Drastic
changes in the civil service system
to benefit federal civilian employes
are under consideration by thp federal
salary classification commission, Ed
ward Keating, secretary of the com
mission and former representative
from Colorado, today told the conven
tion of the National Federation of
postal employes assembled here.
"Women who do the same work as
men should receive the same pay as
men," Mr. Keating said. "We believe
In a system or promotion which will
lead from the lowest end of the lad
der to the highest.
"We are also convinced that civil
service employes should not be
placed at the mercy of any bureau
cratic tyrant, no matter what his po
sition might be. The civilian employe
is entitled to a fair hearing before an
Impartial court if he has grievances."
Representative O'Connor of Louisi
ana, warned the postal employes
against striking unless it is a last re
sort and that way to win recognition
is by the power of the federation at
the polls.
"Don't form a third party." he said
"It would be foolish and would be
weakening to your cause. Confine
your political activities to the two ex
isting parties and support the one
that gives yon the kind of legislation
you demand.
"I am a Democrat," Representative
O'Conner continued, "6ut If the
Democratic party should manifest hos
tility toward you and your cause, I
say beat the party from the head
down."
Representative Nolan of California,
also advised against a third party.
Speaking of the high cost of living,
he said that "if the president can't do
the things he promised to do in re
ducing the cost of living, then the
government as an employer, must
bring up wages to meet the cost of
living."
Representative Madden of Illinois,
champion of the resolution to Increase
the pay of postal employes $150 a
year, told the delegates "it was the
best that we could get," at the pres
ent. He said he knew the bill would
pass congress, but did not know
what action the president would take
when the measure came up for ap
proval. Service betterments sought by the
organization as outlined by Thomas
F. Flaherty, city treasurer, include
higher wage standard; a rate of time
and a half for work In excess of eight
hours; double time for Sunday and
holiday work; unnecessary night
work eliminated, Saturday half holi
days; thirty days' sick leave annually
with full pay and indefinite sick leave

ARE CAUTIONED
AGIST STRIKE
WILSON HOLOS
SACK TREATIES
OF HUM ALLIES
Refuses Copies To Senate, On
Ground Fears Encroachment
On Presidential Powers;
Again Deadlocks Hun Treaty
WASHINGTON. Sept. 1. The re
quest of the foreign relations commit
tee for latest drafts of the proposed
treaties with Germany's allies has
been refused by President Wilson on
the ground that compliance would set
a precedent encouraging senatorial en
croachment on the presidential power
of treaty negotiations. .
In an exchange of letters made pub
lic today, Mr. Wilson wrote that it
was "out of the question" to accede
to the committee's suggestion, and
Chairman Lodge replied that although
the treaties were closely connected
with the treaty with Germany, the
President undoubtedly had authority
to keep information about them from
the' Senate if he chose. ,
The correspondence apparently
brought another impasse betweenr the
president of the committee on the
much-debated subject of what informa
tion the Senators should have in their
consideration of the treaty with Ger
many. Mr. Lodge and others have de
clared the committee could not act in
telligently until all or the Versailles
treaties were before it, but at. the
White House conference Mr. Wilson
told the committee that the form to
be taken by the four treaties under
negotiation depended largely on the
Senate action regarding the instru
ment now before it.
' A copy of the agreement of June 16
relative to the Rhine district also was
denied the committee, the President
writing that it would only become per
tinent after the treaty was ratified
and that its publication now might be
embarrassing to other governments.
To this Senator Lodge replied that it
alreadv had been published in a Brit
ish white book and from that source
had been circulated in this country
through the Congressional Record.
. The correspondence was made pub
lic by Mr. Lodge who Indicated that
no further effort would be made by
the committee in the matter. The com
mittee did not meet lodav, but tomor
row it will resume its hearings and
probably will have another executive
session to work on proposed amend
ments and reservations to the treaty
with Germany.
The only amendment pending be
fore the committee now is a proposal
hv Senator Fall (Republican). New
Mexico, to strike out the provision for
an international labor organization.
When the question of amendments has
been disposed of, drafting of the rati
fication resolution will be taken up.
It Is expected that the committee
draft will include several reservations
to the League of Nations covenant.
At its opening hearing tomorrow
the committee will question Eugene
Pivany of the Hungarian-American
federation, who asked to be heard re
garding the claims of Hungary at the
Versailles conference.
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, the
Democratic leader, had given notice of
his intention to speak on the treaty
at tomorrow's sessions of the Senate,
but it was said at his office tonight
that he might postpone tis .".ddress
until Wednesday.

SUGGEST FENCE
TO END BORDER
CATTLE THEFTS
'Horse-High, Bull-Strong, and
Man-Proof Fence Is Wanted
To Stop 'Reciprocal Rustling'
Which Has Become Serious
PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 1. An inter
national fence along the Mexican bor
der, horse-high, bull-strong, and prac
tically man-proof ,. is the suggestion
made yesterday by members of the
Arizona livestock sanitary board,' for
the purpose of putting a stop to the
"reciprocal rustling" of cattle that Is
continually going on in the border dis
trict. The cattle rustling situation on the
Arizona-Mexican border Is getting so
serious as to require the attention,
not only of the state livestock board
and their inspectors, but the military
authorities as well.
The Arizona livestock board yester
day received a 'letter from Colonel
Carnahan, of the 25th infantry, In
charge of the Nogales district on the
border, calling attention to the
amount of cattle thievery going on in
that district from both sides, and
pointing out the possible serious con
sequences, and suggesting a means of
stopping the practice.
While Colonel Carnahan is careful
to state that it is not a military mat
ter, he adds that he Is more than
willing to be of any possible assist
ance In devising methods of combat
ting the practice, and suggests that
representative cattlemen from both
sIdesof the line get together at some
border point with the board and mili
tary authorities and devise means of
putting; a stop to the cattle rustling.
"Prom the reports we have been re
ceiving." said Chairman E. H. Crabb
of the. livestock board. "It seem ap
parent' that there Is a lot of what
might be called 'reciprocal rustling'
going on from both sides. A gang of
Mexican rustlers come over and run
off a lot of American cattle. Then a
lot of Americans, who are only look
ing for an. excuse, go over and run
off a lot of Mexican cattle to get even.
The practice must be stopped in some
way, and the board probably will
adopt the suggestion of Colonel Car
nahan for a meeting on the border to
look Into the matter.
"The board would like to see a
strong, substantial fence along the
border, but we have never before
said so because it seemed unlikely of
accomplishment. Perhaps the matter
has by this time eotten into such se
rious shape that the suggestion for an
international fence will be taken up
seriously. It would not absolutely
prevent rustling, but it would help to
track and capture both varieties of
bandits, because they would have to
cut the fence, to make a raid, and
would be easily tracked from the
point where they crossed the line."

Says Merico Honor Guarded.
Declaring that in international
matters, "the honor of Mexico had
been guarded with energy and pru
dence," the president gave four main
causes of international friction, as
follows:
American frontier conditions;
damages to foreign property In
Mexico; damages resulting from
Injury and deaths of foreigners
and the results of application of
law developing from legislation
carrying out revolutionary ideals.
Regarding the first, which has been
marked by punitive expeditions,
President Carranza asserted the be

been concluded for the reciprocal
policing of the frontier, the causes
for unpleasantness would disappear.

the president asserted the efficiency
wiin wnicn tne government has pun-
sincerity and abilitv of the Mexican
government to fulfill guarantees.
Discussing the fourth cause of fric
tion, the president said that this was
most serious since it involved a limit
of national overeignty. He took up
his previous declaration expressing
the refusal of Mexico to sacrifice her
liberty to govern according to her
own necessities and not "simply to
satisfy the demands of oil interests.'
Statements from various govern
ment departments which were Includ

president to show the country was in

The report of the board of health

veys some startling information. Dur
ing the year ending December 3, 1918,
there were 6607 deaths In the tat
Of this number 1063 died from tuber
CUlOSlS Of the lungs. Th blsr death
rate from tuberculosis is due to the
fact that this state Is a mecca. for
consumptives and a constant stream
of these unfortunates are coming in
from the eastern states seeking relief
rrom this malady. Generally they
come too late and simply arrive here
to die.
Influenza carried away Ell, while
pneumonia and bronchial pneumonia
carried away 1987. This high death
rate from pneumonia is no doubt due
largely to influenza which developed
pneumonia. Nearly half of the deaths
were due to resDiratorv diseases, that
is diseases of the 1 tints, and Tieariv
one-third were due to pneumonia. The
next highest causes were diarrhoeal
disease in children under two years
which were 557. and epidemic dis
ease in voune and old. 511: whi1 an-
tomoblle accidents claimed 120. vie
urns.
Pneumonia took the largest toll of
any disease in this state and anneara
to be extremely fatal. People should
tnererore use extra caution in dealing
with ordinary colds or any affliction
which may lead to pneumonia In or
der to reduce the number of victims.
The infant mortalitv wa a vprv
large. The number; of deaths under
14 years was 1805. or over 27 ner

by a better understanding of caring

RALPH WALDO EMERSON
.
NO AMERICAN HAS HAD more influence upon the thought
of America than Ralph Waldo Emerson.
His writings have been like a vast quarry into which
later writers have gone, channeled out blocks of thought
and shapened them by words best suited to their particular audi
ences. '
Much of Emerson's philosophy has found its way into many of
the modern religions and 'even into the so-called business literature
of tho oay. 'v)4
His whole basis of thought is contained in one of his short es
says, "Nature," but as a matter of general interest and profitable
knowledge a reading of his complete book, "Conduct of Life," is
suggested.
Emerson Is particularly rich in simple, strong epigram, and here
are a few taken from the mass of his writing:
Envy is ignorance.
Genius works in sport. 7
Nature is upheld by antagonism.
Insist on yourself; never intimate.
Thought makes everything fit for use.
All healthy things "are sweet-tempered. .
No object really interests us but men.
The best fruit of travel is conversation.
Do your work and you shall reinforce yourself.
We acquire strength from the forces we oveicome.
There is properly no history;it is all biography. '
Whenever we tare sincerely pleased we are nourished.
In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts.
Ever spirit makes its' house, and we make a shrewd guess
from the house to the inhabitant.
The best part of health is a fine disposition it is more essential
than ttlent, even in the works of talent.
Mankind divides itself into two classes benefactors and male
factors ; the second is vast,' the first a handful.
The frost that kills the harvest of a year saves the harvest or
a century) by"destroying theweevil or tho locusts-
Theie is a tendency in things to right themselves, and the war
and revolution or bankruptcy that shatters a rotten system r.llows
things to take a new natural order.
Wars, fires, plagues, break up immovable routine, clear the
ground of rotten races and dens of distemper; and open a fair field
for new men.
THE MUNICIPAL MARKET
TIE POPULARITY OF any movement that will help- to reduce
the cost of liviiig was well demonstrated Saturday when the
Warren district's first experiment in conducting a municipal
market was launched at Lowell. Crude and primitive as were
the initial accommodations, there nevertheless was such a popular
response on the part of the public that the success' of the venture
seems assured.
Tho means taken to deliver produce direct from the rancher
to the producer were the height of simplicity. They consisted sim
ply in a small vacant tract of ground and plenty of newspaper pub
licity. The ranchers, gardeners and orchardists brought in their pro
duce or- motor trucks, backed into their imaginary "stalls" on the
market site and the shoppers bought direct from' the trucks.
Th-i middleman, the commisloh merchant, tho jobber, tho re
tailer. Hie shipping clerk, the railroader, the deliveryman, all were
eliminated. Through the simple process of buying direct from the
producer a clear light was thrown on the problem of high costs about
which so much mystery has been thrown. .
Mrs. Housewife enjoyed all tho thrills of a bargain counter rush
at the market, together with the advantage of getting "her produce
fresh from the garden. The public responded nobly to the appeal
to make the initial venture a success.
it is announced that the market will continue in operation on
Saturdays and Wednesday hereafter and that a permanent building
may be constructed if the public's interest continues.
One of the most notable results of the opening of the market
was a general reduction in prices by the stores. In fact, the open
ing day proved a success in every way. If Mrs. Housewife can fore
go the convenience of the delivery syscm and shopping by telephone,
the municipal market probably will be a permanent institution at
, least during part of the year.
Tho American legion and the city council are to be congratulated
on tho practical results of their camprign to cut the cost of living,
both by the purchase of two carloads of food from the army and by
the establishment of the municipal market.
Oarranza has just executed fifteen conspirators who tried to start
a mutiny. He may have his' faults, but he can teach us efficiency in
tho business of discouraging folks who would like to overthrow the
Government.
There is one consolation In the Russian situation. We can
use the same old form every time It is necessary to recognize a
new patriot leader.
At any rate, posterity can tell us how the league will work. And
a lot of senators show a disposition to wait for that testimony.
Stephen C. Mason calls the t'lumb plan the fi'st step through
the gateway of state socialism. Our guess is that the first shall be
last.

to farmers, organize to assault congress for a privilege.

COTTON GIN STARTS
SEASON AT $16 BALE
PHOENIX, Sept. 1. The Arizona
Egyptian, Cotton company started its
first ginning operations of the season
Thursday at ibc local gin and will con
tinue itroughout the season. The
company began its season with a gin
ning p-ce of $16 a bale.

BIGGEi-T LtMONS GROWN
IN FLAGSTAFF
FLAGSTAFF, Sept. 1. That lem
ons can be grown in Flagstaff has
been proven by Mrs. J. C. Milligan. In
fact, Mrs. Milligan Is demonstrating
that they can be grown much larger
here than v.e are accustomed to see
ing thorn. '
She has a k-mon tree, now several
years c'd, showing in a tub. Both
this year and "last it filled with blos
soms and bore several large lemons.
From .Vie lemon last year, Mrs. Milli
gan made four glasse of lemonade.
There is. one on the tree this year
not rio yet which is as large as
one's two fists and which as the
lady . who described it, said "will
make enough lemonade to fill the
tub if it don't stop growing soon."
ACCIDENTALY KILLED
AT COLEMAN LAKE
WILLIAMS. Sept. 1. A partner of
the yoi'ng men recently arrested by
City Marshal Darns one of whom re
ceived a fine of $20 for carrying con
cealed weapons is said to have acci
dentally shot and killed himself just
south and east of Coleman Lake on
Thursday.
Th3 r-ame of the man killed is W.
A. Vernum ,aged 23, from Princeton,
Mo. The two youngsters with him
were 16 and 19 years of age, whom
Burns had arrested. He had a 22-
caliber rifle and probably didn't know
the m'.'nzle from the butt of it, as they
said they weer going to hunt big
game, and called antelopes "cantel
oupes." The coroner's jury rendered
a verduit of accidental death.
RETURNS FROM OUTING
WITH BIG FISH TALES
MESA, Sept. 1. The fish are bit
ing- at Stoneraan Lake, said J. T. Bar
ker, who with Mrs Parker and the
children spent the past three weeks
there and at Mormon Lake. Of the
first-named body of water the fisher
men said, it seemed to be full of very
hungry perch- and that a catch of a
dozen food sized ones as but the
work of a few minutes. The trip was
an enjoyable one and the south side
farmer returnd to find that his cot
ton ha l been doing its very best while
he was away.
These soft drinks make the country sadder Budweiser.
PHOTO NEMESIS OF
. ESCAPED CONVICT
PHOENIX. Sept. 1. Fate in the
form of a photograph arriving at the
police station at the wrong time over
took V H. Couston early this week,
('ouster started for the Oklahoma
state penitentiary yesterday in custo
dy of CfHccr El'is of the city police
force. If the gtnall snapshot, sent out
by the warden-of the Oklahoina pris
on, hi I not. reached Chief of; Police
Brisbo's the day upon which Cohston
was arrested he might never have re
visited his former home from which
he escaped in Deeeiuber.
Coupon was taken into custody
Tuesday morning by Officers Mc
Grath and Papo. It was thought at
the ti ne he was part of a gang operat
ing Le.-e and h- was held without bail
at the jail in an effort to locate his
pals.
He first came to the notice of the
officer when a man named Graham
telepaned that he had been held up
the ni.rht before while walking along
the Ba-.keyo t'.acks. Later he encoun
tered Coustoi. near Yuma road and
Twenty-firs', avenue. McGrath and
Papo started out to look for him and
soon pioked hint up.
At '.he police station he was closely
questioned, but denied ever having
held up Graham. He gave his. name
as W. Miller Late that afternoon a
series of pictures vere received of
convicts escaped from the McAllister
prion and among them was that of
Couston. As soon as he was confronted
with the photohe confessed.
According ti word received from
Oklahoma, Couston was imprisoned
for grand laiceny for a term of five
years
have any chan.te to recover from hi8
ilness in the prison at Florence. He is
convinced that he will die soon from
disease and considers the hospital
there s his lone chance for recovery.
AL GARTIN ARRESTED;
TRIED TO SHOOT NEILL
FLV.-STAFF, Sept 1. Albert Gar
tin Was arrested Sunday morning by
Chief of Police Neill after he had grab
bed i rifle and threatened to kill Mr.
Neill.
Gar'.in is a well known character
here, having punched cows hereabouts
mot of the time for the last 20 cr 25
vears. A few years ago he became
insane, probably lrom excessive use
of drugs and because he was develop
ing a mania to kill he was arrested and
:-entered by F. W. Perkins, at that
'ime ;udge in the superior court,, to
Mie st-Ue insane asylum in' Phoenix.
He escaped from that institution in a
couple of weeks and about a year later
lound sis way back here. He had been
normal until lately, when he began to
jathe.r up rags tnd junk and accummu
late firearms. He was being watched
pretty closely, is it was feared that he
might ?gain develop a mania for kill
ing. He recently bought or got posses
sion cf the home of "Dad" Staley,
vho i now in the county hospital, and
cn Sunday morning . threw several
.agoi. loads of refuse into the street.
Mr. Neill called on him, asking him
not to throw the stuff into the street.
' hen Gartin grabbed the rifle threat
enin . to kill Neill. The latter grap
pled with him, shoving him backward
against a rock, over which he tripped,
makiric disarming easy.
Gaitrn will (vobab)y be committed
to tho i.syluiu again.
CREME'S CONFESSED
SLAYER GETS LIFE
PHOENIX, Sept. 1. Nick Rigles, con
fessed slayer of Harry Creme, waived
all formalities which might stay his
sentence and within less than 24 hours
after avowal of the crime, appeared
before Judge Stanford of the superior
court for judgment. He was sentenced
to a life term in the state penitentiary
at Fiivence.
Clos ted with the judge and a sten
ographer earlie: in tbe day, Rigles
poured forth a repetition of the dis
jointed tale he told the county offi
cials the night before. His story,
punctuated with sobs, checked up in
all esr?ntial details with his first
story.
"1 X'll; Harry myself. Nobody else."
he re-'erated. '. ' , .
Th-v truth of this statement is- now
.ouchd for by the atuhorities, who
stite they- have positive evidence that
no ot'ai'r person was implicated ill the
kiiliim'at 41 Wall street a !week ago
last Monday.
In his cell Rigles ' expressed relief
at th ) iaci. that all is now over, and
'asked in a despairiug toue if he would
CONTRACT IS AWARDED
FOR MESA-TEMPE ROAD
MKSA, Sept. 1.- Among the people
of tho r alley who are acquainted with
McElrath & Sh-Jinway, the contractors
whose bid for building section two of
the Mfsa-Tempe highway, there is a
general feeling of satisfaction over the
lettiu gof the contract. The contrac
tors n?ve signed up for t'ae work, but
it ye; remains lor the supervisors to
add tUfir approval to the bid. That
this ' 1 be done, those who know the
contractors do not doubt
O. C. McElrath is one of the most
energn;ic cotton growers of the south
side nnd within the last two years has
made Pp3i enviable competency in
the industry. However, while he now
is a rancher ,tho fact remains that his
life has been spent largely in road
building and construction work. He
has the reputation of knowing the
business from one end to the other,
coup'-rd with tu energy that is un
unboi.nded. Spcve Shun.ay is In the cement
busi.ieiK at Mesa. He also is a prac
tical crntracto-" and builder, though
recently he has been giving the bulk
of his time to cement construction
work. Shumway is a driving sort of in
dividj'l who kteps his work moving
iust us fast as men and material can
be handled.
Whatever comment is heard upon the
awar Jit g of 'lie bids the opinion
seem-': o be that for quick and satis
factoty road building, the right men
have jen sec- red. Section two will
exten.l from Mesa to the railrod just
'his side of tht city limits of Tempe.

GEN. CALLES AT TUCSON
TUCSON, Sept. 1. General Elias
P. Calles, governor of Sonora, passed
through Tucson lat night en route
from Mexico Cjty to his new station
in his native state. General Calles,
although still governor of Sonora, has
been given a field assignment with
army and is expected to take the
field against the Yaqul Indians upon
his arrival at Nogales. He will be
succeeded as governor next month by
Governor Elect de la Huerta.
; (iinerHl Calles some time ago ac
cepted a 'place in the eabinet of Pres
ident Carranza, but was . relieve and
reassigned to military duty when In
dian raids in Sonora became frequent.
Calles is recognized as oue " of the
most energetic generals In the Mexi
can urniv and his return to Sonora is
expected to result in more active taiu
paigus against the ludiaus.
THE 0NCE-0VER
By "Griff"
"TRAVELING GENTLEMEN"
It is unlikely that any of the pas
sengers on the daily "Deportation
Special" will ever aspire to be travel
ing men after a couple of months of
It.
WIVES HAVE NOTICED IT TOO
Justice of the Peace Winters
says he has noticed that since the
strict enforcement of the prohibi
tion laws far fewer wives seem to
need beating than before.
LEGS
It took a nervy press agen to put
over the picture of Mile. Mistingnette,
the Parisienne who has arrived in
New York with the claim that she has
the most beautiful legs in the world.
But he "got away with it." Even we
would not refer to it' in this chaste
column had not a Kansas editor cen
sored madameoiselle's picture the
other day and printed it minus the
le-er, limbs-with Just the head and
bust showing. Now the question is
whether he really shielded his read
ers' morals any by leaving It all to
the imagination. ' ?
SPEAKING OF PRESS AGENTS
We rather suspect that tome Of
these towns sending out reports of
the huge stores of liquor confis
cated there are doing a little
clever press agent work. There's
foxy old Phoenix, for Instance, ad
vertising herself as the "Paris of
Arizona," just on the eve of a pop
ulation test with Tucson, the
Southern Arizona metropolis.
CLEANLINESS NEXT TO
GODLINESS
Owing to the threatened coal
famine, Berlin has limited her
residents' to two hot baths a
month. But with what the" aver
age Berliner has on his soul, he
could cut out bathing entirely
without missing it much.
PIE
With all those California grapes
spared from the wine press this year,
there ought to be no shortage or rais
ins for the Christmas mince meat pie
crop.
By the way, what's happened to
the wail of the California grape
growers that prohibition would
ruin them? We have n't noticed
any drop in the price of grapes
so far. . s
CHAMPION STRIKE BREAKER
Champion Jack Dempsey has n't
Joined the actors' strike yet. It was
hoped he would walk out with the
other Thespians and prove he was a
champion by doing a little fighting in
stead of drawing down $ 1,000 a night
for treading the boards.
DO IT EARLY
The first snow of the year fell at
Hornell, N. Y., the other day. "Do your
Christmas shopping early," and "get
your winter's fuel in now" will soon
be dinning in our ears.
PROPAGANDA
We are n't naturally suspicious,
but we wonder if that story
about cold storage turkey killing
five persons in Ohio the other day
was n't put out by the profiteer
whose hoards have been unearth
ed by the high-cost-of-living
sleuths.
THE HEIGHT OF COMPLIMENTS
Governor Hobby of Texas was a vis
itor at El . Paso last week and the
Pass City papers vied with each other
in giving the executive a big "spread."
G. Allie Martin, the versatile dramat
ic cricket, acttng managing editor, fea
ture writer and honiorist of the Her
ald wrote one of these ."Intimate" pen
pictures of the governor and his wife
and their home life, winding up a col
umn and a half of encomiums with
the startling fact that Governor Hob
by on getting into a new town, does
n't immediately ask with a wink
where he can "Get something." G. Al
lie must find it's getting as scarce In
El Paso as elsewhere.
ANOTHER BANDIT IS
HEARD FROM
G. Renteria, the Mexican bandit
leader who kidnaped our two avi,
ators and held them for ransom,
announces he is now in Bisbee.
We suppose he's come for that $6,
500 out of which he was "short
changed" by Captain Matlack, and
having been promised same by the
war department, probably will de
mand 8 per cent interest. Might
as well work a good thing for the
limit. ,
ONE TANGIBLE RESULT
We suppose the prohibitionists will
claim credit for the fact that no sea
monsters have been sighted off the At
lantic coast swimming beaches this
year.
Come to think of it, there have
n't been any man-eating sharks
this year either. Ending the war
with Germany undoubtedly is re
sponsible for this.
A USE FOR THE CAMPS
If they Jail all the good profi
teers as promised, there will
have to b a big increase in the
number of prisons. Using the
German internment camps for
this purpose might take care of a
few of the food hoarders and
gougers.
ACCEPT, SIR, ETC.
Miss May I. Knott of Dodge
City, whose name appeared among
the slightly Injured In a recent
motor accident, has been suggest
ed by the Wichita Eagle as an
ideal secretary to the President.
A STRANGE CONDITION
"In scanning our exchanges a pecu
liar condition of affairs is revealed to
us," admitted the able editor of the
Grudge Gazette. "It appears that,
while in 'no town where a paper is
published are there any profiteers, all
the towns from whence other papers
emanate are literally crawling with
them. Although the merchants In all
the neighboring hamlets are gouging
and skinning and hogging mercilessly
and to the uttermost penny, here at
home, wherever it may be, the dealers
are merely conservative or progres
sive business men. In short, In the
evea of the country editor, his own
advertisers are never scamps and ras
cals, but always prominent, influential
and angelic. And. to be perfectly can
did about it. that condition obtains
here in Grudge. Country editors are
not absolutely obliged to live, but they
klnda like to while they are at It.
Turning Back the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(From The Bfsbee Daily Review of
: Wednesday, Sept. 2, 1903.)
Bisbee is to have a night officer.
It was so decreed at last night's meet
ing of the city council. ..The new man
will receive a salary of ?100 a montn.
He is yet to be chosen.
Over 2000 people saw W. M. Ross go
down to defeat at the hands of Sel
Tarr in the drilling contest last night.
Several hundred dollars cnangea
hands on the result. Tom Devine. C.
C. Warner and A. K. Adamson were
judges of the contest.
The board or supervisors after a
stormy session yesterday accepted
the bid of F. E. Johnson of Bisbee
for building the addition to the court
house. The bid was $18,514.50.
The firemen's ricnic which was
held August 16 was such a success
that another will be held e.Trmber
13. at Lewis Springs. Jimmie Nichols
will again be in charge.
The condition of Stewart Hunt, who
has been very ill for the last few
weeks, is reported improved.
Dr. Broderick, one of the popular
physicians of the Copper Queen staff,
left yesterday on a visit to his old
home in Kansas City.
J. S. Pannelee, accompanied by his
niece; Miss Mamie Welch, left last
evening for Los Angeles where Miss
Welch will enter school.
Miss Pearl Lamore left yesterday
for Tucson where she will enter the
convent in that city, which offers ex
ceptional advantages for education.
C. F. Nichols was a visitor from
Douglas yesterday.. He came up on
mining business.
MINING. NOTES
Max Marks reports that during the
month just passed sinking at the Mar
quette has progressed faster than at
any similar period in the history of
the shaft.
It is revolted that there is now very
littje water in the workings of the
Copper Queen company. Superintend
ent Clawson has had every pump
working with the result that the Hol
brook and Czar shafts are practically
dry.
The Aurora Mining company is a
new aggregation of Cananea men who
have recently made a rich strike.
They found a copper ledge seven feet
in width.

PETE HERMAN
BADLY BEATEN
WATERBURY, Conn., Sept. 1.
Pete Herman of New Orleans, batam
weight champion of the world, was
defeated in a 10-round no-decision
bout by Joe Lynch of New York, at
the Driving Park here this afternoon.
Newspaper critics give Lynch eight of
the 10 rounds, the other two being
even.
Lynch forced the fighting from the
start to finish while the champion
fought on the defensive most of the
time, showing only occasional flashes
of the form expected of him. In the
third round, Herman landed two
hard rights to Lynch's body but the
New Yorker came back strong and
captured honors in all of the ensu
ing rounds. Herman was never In
danger, however, as Lynch's blows
seemed to lack power.

Perhaps you have noticed the effect

Bills have been introduced to license
