Decks Are Cleared for the First Game of the 1917 Champion
ship Series Between New York Giants and Chicago Ameri
cans. Fans Throng Windy City Searching for Accommo
dations and Also for Seats at Opener.
At 12:30 o'clock today the Associated Press-Review leased wire will
begin sending the fans of the Warren District, through this office, a
detailed account of the first world series game between the Chicago
White Sox and the New York National Giants.
Play by play the report will be sent. Each and every ball delivered
from the hands of a pitcher will be sent to the several hundred Associat
ed Press offices throughout the country- The results, Immediately they
are received, will be called out to those in front of the Review office.
Following the game a box score and bulletins will be posted. On Sunday
morning the full details of the first game, attendance and other features
will be covered adequately.
In furnishing a play by play report of the world series, the Associated
Press, last year, established a precedent unknown in press work or in
wire activities before. Through the leased wire facilities of the organiza
tion, which extends into every part of the nation, the report will be sent.
A wonderful feature of the sending is the fact that one operator, located
at the White Sox field in Chicago, handles all of the wires of the coun
try. Instead of there being numerous relays at the various bureau points
all wires will be centered in Chicago. The result is an instantaneous
service.

CHICAGO. Oct. 5. The caldron of
baseball is a-boil here tonight on the
eve of the world's series between the
Chicago Americans and the New York
National league club. Every ingredi
ent necessary for the most spectacu
lar struggle of recent years has been
contributed by clubs, players and fans.
If the weather man donates a day in
keeping with the importance tf the
occasion, the opening game of the se
ries at Comiskey park tomorrow
should result in a battle which will
equal in brilliance, tenseness and en
thusiasm that of any game in diamond
history. ,
Chircago Thronged.
Players, magnates, ' ticket specu
lators and fans from the four corners
of the country have been gathering on
the ph'jres of Lake Michigan for sever
al days and the stage is set for what is
expected to be the most dramatic cli
Eiax to the baseball season of 1917.
War In Background.
To the cities concerned, especially
Chicago, as the scene of the intital con
flict, the impending battle between the
White Sox and the Giants is of para
mount impor;ance. It is the basis and
source of unlimited controversy, wag
ering and heartburn. The turning
contest has been r.rgued from every
conceivable angle without the partis
ans of the two teams agreeing upon
any one feature of the play or the re
sult. Weather Uncertain.
There is bu: one idea in common be
tween the two rival camps of rooters
and that is the desire for fair weather
when the clans of Rowland and Ms
Craw rush 'jut upon the diamond eager
for the test of baseball skill and nerve.
What the morrow holds for the fan
and the player in this respec: is hard
to forecast tonight. The weather pre
diction for Saturday is fair and cool
but throughout today there were rain
squalls and high j-ales amj tonight
gray clouds hung luw and November
like winds were sweeping aci'jss the
city.
President Comsikey was not appar
ently worried by the indifferent sup
port of the local weather man, how
ever, for he places absolute reliance
in a little pocket almanac which states
the weather for the opening game of
the world's series will be "fair."
Fith In the Almanac
This bi: of Information was given by
the Old Roman in the course 'jf a "fan
ning bee" in one of the offices at White
Sox park today. For years the presi
dent of the American League champ
ions has relied upon the accuracy of
this almanac. When special days
were give at the park, such as Frank
Chance day in honor ot the former Chi
cago National iii'jl, who came here as
mur.ager of the New York Yankees,
the little book said "clear and warm"
and when a day was set aside for Ed
Walsh last year the little book again
was consulted for a date promising
favorable conditions and in both cases
the weather was all that could be de
sired. The fans tonight are praying t the
gods of baseball that Comiskey's alma
nac may prove as reliable as in the
past for the postponement even for a
day may prove as reliable gooftheshrd
day, of the opening game would upset
the scheduled plans and arrangements
not only of the players, but thousands
of supporters of the rival teams and
non-partisan spectators who have
traveled hundreds of miles to be pres
ent at the firsi. clash of western and
eastern major league pennant winneds
in some years.
Fans Flock In.
From far points In all sections of
I
the country these thirty-third degree
baseball fans have come to witness
what they confidently predict will be
the greatest world's series in many
seasons. The hotels are thronged to
night with these invaders from dis
tant territory and late comers are hav
ingdifflculty in securing accommoda
tions. Their troubles are as nothing com
pared to those of persons who have to
purchase their tickets to the game at
this late hour. It is doubtful If in the
long history of world series contests
the pasteboards necessary to gain ad
mission to the parks iave ever been so
scarce. For once in their tempestu
ous career the ticket speculators are
forced to see prospective purchasers
with fists full of bills seeking vainly
for the cards which will on Saturday
separate the chosen and those who
must remain outside the walls.
Speculator Reap Harvest.
Those fortunate speculators who
have been able to secure tickets are
reaping a golden harvest almost the
equal of that gathered by the lucky
and shrewd investors who picked up
"war bride" stocks in the early days of
the European war. eBtween them and
the fan who would see the series at
any price there is little or no arguing
tonight. Once a vendor is found waL'j
holds the "open sesame" to Comiskey
Field the transaction of parting him
from his coupons is a matter of but
a moment in most cases for the fan is
apparently willing to pay any amount.
Five dollar seats for three games with
a face value 'of $15 sold as high as
seventy-five dollars and even these
figures are likely to be surpassed if
the weather is fair tomorrow.
One Hundred Thousand.
It was estimated by a local baseball
authority tonight that there would
have been no difficulty in selling fully
one-hundred thousand seats for the op
ening game. Thousands of orders
have been turned back and President
Comiskey said tonight that he feared
that he had lost a host of friends due
to his inability to supply all with
tickets for the series.
Those who could not secure seats in
the ordinary way paid the speculators
their own prices, if money was no ob
ject. If they could not meet the lat
ter's demands they might be certain f
gaining a choice seat in the unreserved
sections of the stands.
At an hour when the staid citizen
was homing his way to dinner, the
lines were already forming outside the
portals of White Sox Feld.
Prepare For Night.
Equipped with chairs, balnkets,
lunches and other comforts for inner
and outer man, the fans began to gath
er. Btys and young men predominat
ed but here and there along the ever
growing queues there could be seen a
woman or an elderly man who bore the
discomforts of the long wait with the
same apparent nonchalance of their
youthful companions. Vendors quick
to take advantage tf the situation ap
peared with lunch stands and sand
wiches, coffee, cushions and tobacco
were soon on sale. Business was
brisk throughout the hours as mid
night approached.
Both Teams Confident
Although confldetce was rampant
among the camp followers of the two
teams there was little evidence of
; heavy watering. Most of the betting
j was confined to t urns ranging from
five to twenty-five dollars and these
amounts were placed at or close to
even money. It probable that In
the aggregate the total reached into
thousands of collars but there were

No Assessment
Senator Henry F. Ashurst of Ari
zona, wired the Review last night
that the president had signed the
resolution suspending for two years
work on all unpatented mining
claims. Behind this measure have
been alligned Senator Ashurst, Sen
ator Smith and Congressman Hay
den and it much to the Arizona del
egation's credit that it was passed
at this session of congress.
FIGHT FOR CHEAT
INCREASE IN PAY
Miners and Operators Come
to An Agreement On
Wages. Is Based On Pos
sible Raise of Cost to Con-
sumer.
(Br Review Leased Wire
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5. Bitumin
ous coal miners of the central com
petitive field won their fight for a
general wage increase tonight when
operators and miners' representatives
in conference here reached a compro
mise agreement on the terms of Hie
new contract The agreement pre
sages a wage raise throughout the in
dustry since the central field scale
serves as a basis for all other dis
tricts and a consequent advance in
the government's fixed price for coal.
The Public Pays.
Operators' representatives agreed
to tha new wages on condition that
they are absorbed in higher coal
prices. After the agreement, drawn
by a sub-committee, is ratified tomor
row by the field conference they will
go to the fuel administration and ask
a revision upward of present coal
prices to meet the raise. The wage
Increase, according to operators esti
mates, will add from 35 to 50 cents a
ton on the cost of producing coal in
thick vein mines and considerably
more in mines with thinner veins.
The contract will contain provis
ions to prevent strikes and lockouts
and will be so drawn as to be impos
sible for either operators or miners
to break on the grounds of so-called
changed conditions.
The Raises.
Under the agreement an increase
of 10 cents a ton will be paid for pick
and machine mining as against the
minsrs' first demand for 15 cents; day
labor will be advanced $1.40 a day in
stead of $1.90 asked; the pay for
yardage and dead work will be in
creased 15 per cent instead of 20 per
cent demanded. Trappers will get
75 cents a day raise and other boys $1.
Will Ask Increase.
In seeking a revision of coal prices
to 'meet the wage increases, operators.
It is understood, will ask the fuel ad
ministration for any additional in
crease in prices to cover higher min
ing costs generally. Operators in
many fields are contending they can
not mine coal at a profit at the prices
recently fixed by President Wilson
and tli at any increases must of neces
sity more than cover the wage raises.
John P. White, president of the Uni
ted Mine Workers, said tonight the in
creased wages would stimulate pro
duction and prevent mine employes
from leaving the mines.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 5. More of
Count von Bemstorff's confidential
cable exchanges with the Berlin for
eign office were made public by the
state department tonight, furnishing
documentary proof of the extraordi
nary activities of Bolo Pasha, now a
prisoner in France, and throwing fur
ther light upon the machinations of
the German diplomatic service.
The messages signed by Von Bern
storff and by Von Jagow. then foreign
minister, show that $1,700,000, which
the ambassador expected authority to
place to the credit of Hugo Schmidt,
then a representative of the Deutsche
bank at New York, was sought as a
loan to a leading political personality
in France, and was counted upon to
bring peace. They were exchanged in
February, 1916. when the French so
cialists were threatening to overthrow
the government and there was talk
of France being tired of war and was
dissatisfied with the part played by
her allies.

BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM. Oct. 5. (4 p. m.) (By Asso
ciated Pre3s.) The southern extremi
ty of the new battle fronts the sec
tion extending from Ypres-Menin high
way northward by Polderhoek, Came
ron Covert and Reutel today contin
ued to be the position to which the
eGrmans were devoting most atten
tion. This sector has been under an
extremely heavy enemy artillery fire
since the British push started yester
day and it seemed certain that the Ger
mans would not let the last word rest
with the series of counter attacks they
delivered or attempted to deliver,
against this front yesterday afternoon
and evening.
British Hold Lines.
Today the British were holding
stiOngly to ail the positions secured
yesterday with the exception of a few
advanced posts In a very small area
of the Reutel region, where they drew
back slightly after a third German
counter thrust. The eGrmans amass
ed for several other attacks but all
these were nipped in the bud by artil
lery and machine gun fire. The entire
British line was remarkably well dug
in by morning.
"Tanks" Take Part.
The "tanks" again did well during
the fight at various points. One of
these monsters was the first arrival in
the village of Reutel. When it was fol
lowed in by some infantry it traundled
back to other work. The British later
withdrew their posts fro mthe ruined
hamlet to more favorable ground just
behind. On the extreme left of the
British attack "tanks" assisted in tak
ing several redoubts which had been
giving trouble with their machine
guns.
The scarcity of towns in the zone
of yesterday's offensive robbed the
fighting of those spectacular features
attendant upon hand to hand work
among shattered buildings.
Killed Or Prisoner.
In the battle around Poelcapelle,
however, there was considerable sharp
work. Six enemy battalions in the
front line here all were killed with the
rifle and machine gun fire or made
prisoner.

PEACE BASIS
FOR AMERICA
Former President Says Disso

Defeat of Germany and
Elimination of Turk Neces
sary. (By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK. Oct. 5. Theodore
Roosevelt, speaking here tonight at a
"National Service"' mass meeting un
der the auspices of the mayor's com
mittee on national defense, declared
the only peace which will make the
world safe for democracy must 'be
based upon the -complete overthrow
of Germany and the dissolution of
Austria and Turkey. Included in the
program he outlined were a free
Arabia and Armenia, Poland and
Lithuania, with an independent Czech
commonwealth and a Jugo-Slav state.
Peace Rumors Hurt
"Continually we hear rumors of
peace." he said. "I think the circula
tion of such rumors is injurious to
America and to the cause of decency
and democracy. We should make it
clearly understood that the conduct
of Germany has been such that we
regard as enemies of mankjnd all peo
ple who would strive to bring about
a peace based upon treating Germany,
Austria and Turkey on the one hand,
and the allies on the other, as stand
ing on a footing of equality. The only
peace that will make the world safe
for democracy is a peace based upon
the complete overthrow of Germany
and the dissolution of Austria and
Turkey.
"Unless we have used the phrase in )
a hypocritical and insincere manner,
this is the way to make the world
safe for democracy, and the only way;
and this means that the only peace we
can accept is the "peace of overwhelm
ing victory. Turkey's conduct toward
the Armenian and Syrian Christians
has been such as to make it evident
that the Turk must not only'be driven
out of Europe, but the empire de
stroyed. Give Arabia freedom, give
Armenia freedom. Establish a free
city at Constantinople and keep the
straits absolutely open for the Rus
sians and every one one.
"Restore Italian-Austria to Italy and
Rumania-Hungary to Rumania.
"As for Belgium, she is not only
entitled to restoration, but to the
heaviest kind of indemnity. Let France
have Alsace-Lorraine; let Poland In
clude the whole Baltic coast, to which
she is entitled. Let the English and
the Japanese keep the colonies they
have won.
U. S. Wants Nothing
"As for the United States, we wish
nothing except to have it clearly un
derstood that the Mot) roe Doctrine
is to be upheld in the future as in the
past. South of the equator this doc
trine can be left to Brazil. Argentina
and Chile, who are strong enough to
maintain it. and whom we will aid in
maintaining it only when they so de
sire. "Peace should come along the lines

to make the peace permanent and
minimize the chances of war in the j
future. But avoid folly and hypocrisy.
and do not make believe that any
paper scheme will bring the millen
nium or abolish all chances of future
war. After we have done all we can
do by Hague conferences and arbitra
tion agreements and treaties, let us
profit by the lessons of the last three
and a quarter years, and remember
that all these things taken together
will be an utterly Insufficient safe
guard for peace against alien aggres
sion. There is but one permanent
method of securing safety for this
nation, and that is by training our
strength in time of peace, by pre
paredness; and the only effective pre
paredness must rest on a system of
universal obligatory military training
for all our young men."
German Intrigue Cited
Referring to the Bolo Pasha revela
tions, he declared that statements al
ready published had disclosed that
"the German ambassdor for the last
two years prior to the breaking of
diplomatic relations was engaged In a
campaign In this country to influence
public opinion throuch the press,
through pacificist organizations and
similar bodies. How large the cor
ruption fund that was spent in Amer
cla. we do not yet know. But it was
certainly very large."

BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, Oct. 5. The sun this
morning was shining down through
the crisp October air on an unwaver
ing line of British troops along the
new defences which they reached in
yesterday's great drive. The night
had brought virtually no change in
the situation and the British rapidly
were consolidating the positions tlm
were the fruit of one of the most im
portant conquests of the war. The
night was comparatively calm as far
as infantry action was concerned.
The enemy, however, concentrated
an intense artillery fire on the entire
battle front and during yesterday aft
ernoon and evening they massed their
shattered troops at various places for
counter attacks. These were attempts
born of disposition and In almost ev
ery case the on-rushing waves of Ger
man infantry were caught in a heavy
artillery, machine gun and rifle fire
and crushed before they reached their
objectives. The German artillery fire
was particularly heavy .up to mid
night along the section in the vicini
ty of Polderhoek. In the afternoon
and evening the enemy launched no
less than five counter attacks in this
sector of the front, but each time were
driven back with heavy losses.
BERLIN GRUDGINGLY ADMITS.
BERLIN, Oct 5. (British Admiral
ty, per Wireless Press.) The Ger
man official report follows:
"Western theater: Front of Crown
Prince Rupprecht of Bavaria: Yes
terday was a day of battle of unusual
intensity for the leaders and the
troops of the fourth army. It has been
withstood. From early morning until
into the night the struggle was con
tinued by repeated English attacks

region northwest of Langemarck to
south of Ithe Menin-iYpres roail 15
kilometers. On the terrain on which
this hitter fluctuating fighting of in
fantry took pla?e, massed artillery,
both men and guns worked uninter
ruptedly at their maximum efforts.
The hottest points of the battle were
at Poelcapelle, the isolated farms
three kilometers west of Passchen
daelle, the roads crossing east and
southeast of Zcnnebeke. portions of
the woods west of Becelaere and the
village of Gheluvelt.
Acknowledges Gain.
"Over this line the enemy was able
temporarily to push forward but und
er the pressure of our counter attacks
he could not hold his ground although
until late evening fres-h forces were
continually brought into the fray. The
English gain was restricted to a strip
of land of one to one and a half kilo-

"The sanguinary losses of the Ens
lish divisions at least 11 were en
gaged on the battle front in the early
attack alone are reported as very
high. The effective co-operation of
all our arms also caused this power

If betting was scarce, forecasts and
predictions as to the outcome of the in

made up for any deficiency in this re
spect. The fans of the competing
clubs did not hesitate tv voice their
opinions In no uncertain tones. Play
ers, managers, and magnates, while
more conservative still let it be known
that they believed their respective
clubs would quickly establish a lead
which would indicate the relative
strength of the two combinations.
Manager Clarence Rowland, speak
ing for the Chicago club players, said:
Rowland Speaks.
"This series means a great deal to
Chicago and we have n'ot left a wheel
unturned to bring the world's champ
ionship to Comiskey. We realize that
the Giants are a great team but the
White Sox have had to battle all sea
son in our own league with three
clubs that were as tough, or tougher,
to beat. My men are in the pink of
condition and eager to meet the Giants.
I have had three ainbit.'jns and two of
them have been realized. They are
the winning of the American League
pennant and the privilege of meeting
Manager McGraw for the highest hon
or of the game. He is unquestionably
the greatest leader of the National
League. My third ambition is easy to
guess I want to give Comiskey an
other world's championship flag."
While Manager McGraw of the New
York club, adhered to his rule of no
predictions regarding victory he was
willing to discuss the series in a gen
eral way.
He said:
McGraw Talks.
"The White Sox are going to be a
hard team to beat, and while I natural
ly expect the hardest kind of a fight I
am confident that tne Giants will prove
much more formidable than many ex
pect. Everyone of the Giant pitchers
who Is likely to work in the series is
In perfect condition and I feel sure will
be able to hold his own against the
Chicago batters. I have a splendid in
field and outfield combination and we
will have no excuses to offer if we
lose but I have fixed my mind upon a
different ending to the series and all
the players feel the same way about
the outcome."
Both President Ban Johnson, of the
American League and Owner Charles
Comiskey of the Chicago club spoke
confidently of the chances of the
White Sox but none of those connected
with the two teams cared to go on rec

the rival pitchers for the first clash.
While neither Rowland or McGraw
would sfate his probable choice, the
concensus of opinion among the ex
perts and fans was that Ck'Jtte would
lead the White Sox over the top
against the Giants while the New

Second Choice.
Second choice twirlers were Faber
and Perrltt but almost without excep
tion the wish was expressed that CI
cotte and Schupp might work in order
that the question of pitching suprem
acy between these two stars be settled
at the tmUet. This statement will
have no effect upon the plans of the
rival managers, however, and it is
probable that neither will make a fi
nal selection until he has seen the
pitchers warming up tomorrow after
noon. The Line Up.
In other respects the line-up and bat
ting order will be the same as forecast
for several days past. Charley Her
zog:, the Giant second baseman, stated
tjnight that he was fit and ready for
the hardest kind of a fight and that
there was no question, in his mind of
his ability to play full seven games if
necessary. Under these conditions
the batting order for the first game
probably will be as follows:

SERIES AT MINEOLA.
MINEOLA. N. Y., Oct, 6. The
world's series became a more en
grossing subject of conversation than
the world war among the Illinois and :
New York soldiers of the "rainbow"!
divisions Jpday. The arguments con
cerning the respective merits of the ,
pennant winner in the National and '
American leagues gained force from ;
the fact that this was pay-day for the
165th infantry, formerly the 69th New j
York. J
The New York soldiers, almost in
a body, headed for the camp of the
149th field artillery of Illinois, when j
they had received their pay. The Ill
inois men took all the bets offered as
long as their cash held out and then
tried to wager their personal belong
ings that the White Sox would beat
the Giants.

BOIS DENIES ENTANGLEMENT
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct, 5. Profes
sor Jules Bois, French lecturer, nam
ed by State Attorney General Merton
E. Lewis, of New York, in connection
with the activities of Bolo Pasha, gave
ont a lengthy statement here tonight
affirming his patriotism and denying
that there was anything improper in
his dealings with Bolo. The sum of
$5,000, which Bolo gave to him, he
said, was for the purpose of aiding
Bois' French propaganda work in this
country.
Awaits Judgment
"I await," he said, "the definitive
judgment which will pass its . decree
on the case of Bolo. If he is guilty,
although I have always acted in good
faith, according to the dictates to my
conscience, as proved by facts, I shall
by my work get together the full $5.
000 voluntarily given to me In order
to facilitate my patriotic work and
employed for that and i shall donate
this same amount to some French wr
fund."
Boi3: said that he first met Bolo
Pasha in Paris in a newspaper office.
Early in 1916, in New York, Bolo tel
ephoned him recalling their conversa
tion in Paris.
Meets Again.
"We met a few days afterward,"
the statement ocntinues. "saying: I
have come to New York to buy paper
for printing. You know I like to en
courage the press. I am very rich
and I put aside a part of my fortune
to help sustain the newspapers and
it
a
to patronize literary men. Since you
are here to expend French ideas and
since undoubtedly you have not too
much money on hand for this patrio
tic work allow me to contribute to
this good cause. Let me place to your
credit with the Royal Bank of Cana
da $5,000 to carry on your work. In
exchange I ask nothing but I would
be grateful if you would give a lec
ture, the proceeds to go to the fund
for those blinded In the war.' "
This lecture was given, the state
ment says, and the proceeds of $10,-
000 were given to the fund suggested
by Bolo Pasha.
Pasha Thanks Bois.
"Bolo Pasha thanked me," Bois
said, "and he confided to me that It
was his great desire to see Mr. Hearst
take up the cause of the allies. He
assured me that already he had been
given the promise that the Hearst
syndicate would never attack France.
1 encouraged him."
This conversation was reported to
the French government, according to
the statement, which continues:
Introduced to Hearst
"A few days later Pasha Invited me
to a large dinner in Mr. Hearst's
honor. 1 accepted. This, if I remem
ber rightly, was in March, 1916. He
Introduced me to Mr. Hearst with
whom I could not exchange two
word, for at that time I spoke very
little English.
"It has been mentioned that at this
dinner there were present Boy-Ed
and von Papen of the Germany em
bassy. They were no more there than
William or the crown prince.
"I am deeply distressed as to what
has happened but my conscience is
untroubled. My work attests my patriotism."
Tanks Active in
Flanders Battle
(Continued From Page One)
was smashed badly during yesterday's
fighting. Another attempt just north
of the Ypres-Roulers railway was delt
with similarly.
As To Losses.
It Would be interesting to know what
the German casualties have been.
Certainly they were enormous. The
Germans wen: down like wheat under
the terrible artillery fire from the Brit
ish guns. Latest reports indicate that
the British casualties were light The
artillery had prepared the way so
thoroughly that the infantry had com
paratively little difficulty in achieving
their objectives.
With the British secure in all the po
sitions they won Thursday along the
more than eight-mile . front on the
Ypres sector in Flanders, Field-Marshal
Haig's men were busy Friday con
solidating their newly won positions.
Nothing but the dropping of shells
from German guns served to interrupt
the breathing spell the Birtish were
taking, except here and there small
counter attacks.
In addition to the enormous casual
ties inflicted upon the Germans the
British captured 4,446 prisoners in
Thursday's attack, among the 144 Vf
ficers. Comparative quiet prevails on all
the other battle fronts.
Rumania U Objective.
Apparently the Teutonic allies in
Rumania, after several weeks of inac
tivity, again are preparing to attempt
to force back the Russo-Rumanian line.
The Russians have teen forced to sus
tain an offensive near Radautz. while
near the Buzeu river region attacks by
Bulgarian trc'jps have bee ndefeated.
Austrian Admit Loss.
Admission is made in the latest Vi
enna official communication that the
Italians were successful in winning
trenches from the Austrian:-! on the
western slope of Monte San Cabriele.
Coalition In Russia.
In Russia a coalition cabinet has
been formed with M. Keren.iky as pre
mier, notwithstanding the demand of
the democratic congress that n'j gov
ernment should be constituted without
the sanction of the congress.

Training Will Be
Intensive In All
National Camps
(By Review Leased Wire.) j
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5. Training j
mapped out by the war department
for the national guard and national
army divisions before they will be
registered as ready for duty abroad
is baaed on a 16-week course of the
most intensive kind of work in the
open, varied with lectures by Ameri
can and allied officers who are ex
perts in modern warfare. To insure
uniformity of training throughout the
entire army, divisional commander
have been urged to see . that the
schedules, announced today, are fol
lowed closely.
Great stress is laid upon the neces
sity for night training. Trench raid
ing, scouting, trench building and op
erations of all kinds which may be
called for in actual combat, will be
duplicated at the camps through the
night hours. To give the men some
respite, their Wednesday and Satur
day afternoons will be kept free ex
cept in the case of backward indf
Tiduals or units. Target practice
runs through the entire course and
the schedules call for 40 hours train
ing each week.
A striking feature of the program
is the fact that virtually the entire
16 weeks will be devoted to training
individuals, platoons and companies.
New elements will be Injevted into
the training each week so that every
phase of modern trench warfare will
be dealt with. The lecture program
is calculated to show the soldier not
only Just what he is to expect at the
front, but also what will be his duty
unde rail circumstances of war.
As the men harden to their work,
the hours of vigorous physical exer
cises increase and marching maneuv
ers are extended. At regular inter
vals review courses will be gvien and
a program of test courses to deter
mine every soldier's ability and to be
the stepping stone to promotion.

SHERIFF WHEELER
ANSWERS HIS
DEFAMERS
Purporting to represent the action of
the Warren District Trades Assembly,
E. T. McCoy sends a set of resolutions
to Harry C. Wheeler that protest
against his appointment as an officer
in the U. S. army. The basis of these
resolutions Is the deportations of the
L'W. W. horde from Bisbee on the
morning of July 12. Notwithstanding
the fact that the United States go em
inent has moved against the wobblies
and placed their leaders in jail, McCoy
speaks for union labor here as special
pleader for this outlawed order. As
to whether union lab'jr is beh'n'i these
resolutions is another matter. It Is
hard to believe that this is the case.
Sheriff Wheeler's answer is one of
the most dignified and patriotic and
high minded statements that has been
given to the public 'hroush Lite press
for a long day. It is reproduce! here
with pride in our sheriff and the firm
faith that' he will achieve his great
and well earned ambition:
Sheriff Wheeler's Answer.
A copy of the resolutfons recently
adopted by the Warren District Trades
Assembly with the approval of the A.
F. of L. of the state of Arizona were
recently sent me &nd upon carefully
reading said resolutions little doubt Is
left as to the antagonism I created in
the ranks of the Trades Assembly and
the State Federation of Labor by my
recent actions In suppressing the
treasonable and unpatriotic assembl
age of the I. W. W., who had taken
possession of this district.
I had supposed the I. W. W.'s to be
an organization of itself, by i-.self and
because of its known radical tenden
cies as an organization, to be in dis
favor with all fair organizations "of
American labor; my acti'jns were di
rected against the I. W. W.'s. I charge
them with being enemies of my gov
ernment and country and my conten
tions seem to have been upheld by the
government In as much as there are
166 I. W. W. leaders under arrest by
government order under charges sim
ilar to those which I made against
them July 12th of the present year.
In consideration of the resolution of
the Warren District Trades Assembly
as directed against me, copies of which
they have sent to various officials in
the United Statesand having inform
ed me that they intend to publish the
same in the local press, so far without
having done so, I wish to state in ref
erence to .said resolutions, I t?nd to
day, where I have always stood, un
willing tV yield one inch of ventage to
any foe of my country or Its govern
ment and I care not who or what the
man may be, if he be a foe of the Unit
ed States, he is my foe without com
promise to the end.
I have never been opposed to honest
labor buf lab'jr seems to have taken up
the I. W. W. cause against me and. as
a means of hurting me most, is oppos
ing my entrance into the army of the
United States. I have no wish to per
manently enter the army, being in the
old age of my youth; I realize I could
yield but a short period of usefulness
to the army, but such as I am I have

one volunteer at this time, 'of a man

You would deny me a position of

of Cochise county, succeed in being
admit'.ed to the army of the United
States, it will mean the last of the
Wheeler family has gone Into service.
Yesterday Harry Wheeler received a
letter from his younger brother, Wil
liam, that he would shortly sail for
France as a first lieutenant in the
165th Infantry, Forty-Second Division,
United States army.
Wheeler comes from a military
family. His father was retired a
colonel, at the time in command of
the Twenty-Second infantry. Harry
C. has served in the regular army and
in the volunteers during the Spanish
American war.
William Wheeler, his brother, had
been a resident of Brooklyn, was
graduated from the first Plattsburg
training camp as a first lieutenant.
He was immediately assi"gned to the
Rainbow Division, the 165th Infantry.
This regiment is one of the most fa
mous in the country. It was formerly
the Sixty-Ninth, New York, composed
largely of Irishmen. It is commanded
by Colonel Hine, formerly a resident
of Tucson and well known in Bisbee.
The division is under the command
of Major General Mann and is camp
ed at Mineola, Long Island.
"I finished Plattsburg officers'
camp O. K.," says Wheeler to his
local brother, "and w-as assigned by
the war department to the 165th In
fantry, which was the 69th New York
Irish regiment. They are a splendid
bunrii and mostly all Irish. We are
In the Rainbow Division (42nd) and
expect to sail for France within "
Lieutenant Wheeler then tells his
brother of much hard work; many,
many men in uniform and great- en
thusiasm. He ends his letter with Tt
desire for letters and a hope that he
will fcerve his country well and re
turn to his native land.

In many respects Dickinson's in
vestigations have taken on a novel
idea. He is combining his expert
knowledge of general mining condi
tions with a detailed survey of their
socialogical side. The latter, in the
view of Dickinson, Is an important
factor in determining satisfactory or
unsatisfactory results in any indus
trial community.
To this end the safety engineer has
taken up rents, food prices, prices of
electricity, gas, ice, and the hundred
and one other commodities which en
ter into the sum total of a single
man's or a family's expenditures in
their living. He has investigated the
entertainment side of Bisbee. the pure
ly social, the fraternal, and has gone
into the question from every angle.
Mrs. Dickinson, during her Bisbee
visit, has made many friends. With
ber husband she will be an ever
welcome visitor to the community.

FEEL EFFECT OF
NEW REVENUE TAX
Even "The Makin's" Cost
More, While Tailor-MacW
Soar By Leaps and Bounds.
Thursday the retail tobacco dealers
of the district met and adjusted uni
form prices for the sale of tobacco.
This new schedule was necessitated
by the government demand that an im
mediate inventory be taken of all to
bacco stocks on hand, and the notifica
tion that such stock would be subject
to tax. The price list adopted by
local merchants is but a tentative one,
and it is subject to change on the re
ceipt of definite information from the
revenue collector. As yet the amount
of the tax is unknown, although it has
been estimated from the various trade
journals that It will approximate
twenty cents on the dollar.
Packages Changed.'
Purchasing agent E. C. Campbell of
the Phelps Dodge Mercantile company
said yesterday that some of the tobac
co companies are contemplating a
change in the sizes of their packages:
prefer: ing to Bell a small package at a
popular price than to continue their
present packages at the increase. How
ever, it was Campbell's opinion that
even the raise would not affect the
selling market, as, the average smok
er can meet the change without being
seriously inconvenienced. Tobacco is
classed as a luxury of life, and in view
of the leaping costs of the necessities,
little grumbling over the new schedule
is anticipated. As a matter of fact,
the cigar tax is toV small to affect the
price of single cigars, save in a few In
stances. I. W. W. ARRESTED.
Denver, Oct. 5. Charles R. Jacobs,
former secretary of the local Industrial
Workers of the World organization,
was arrested today on an indictment
returned by the federal grand jury at
Chicago, when he went to the office
of the United States marshal to get a
permit to visit Meyer Friedkin, an I.
V. W. leader here arrested Saturday.

Sulphur Springs Valley Farmers
Helping to Build a Great Country. By
Hon. William Delbridge. Without II
lusfrations. Bisbee: Bisbee Ore. $0.05.
The profound and fascinating sub
ject, "Sulphur Springs Valley Farmers
Helping to Build a Great Country,"
has been approached by modern
writers from many angles, but niver
has it been as deftly and skilfully
handled as by William Dolbridse.
Bringing his notable faculty for in
sight into human nature into play,
he has woven humor and pathos with
a master hand. The article is con
tinued. First Installation Excellent
The first installment abounds in
rare treats of description. After
sketching rapidly and brepzily the
road conditions in Sulphur Springs
valley, he writes:
"After passing the school house a
short distance. Lo, and behold, there
stood a big sign, 'Ice Cold Drinks Sold
Here' ... we walked nip to the
bar. A pretty little girl without a
touch of paint or powder, bright
eyed and healthy, smiled . . . and
asked us what we liked. Coca Cola,
says Richard, and, say, it was the
coldest drink we have tasted for years.
Where did you get the ice? Papa
brings it from Bisbee when he comes
home from work, said the litlte girl.
Let's take a look around, says I."
Brilliant Description Follows
Then follows a symphonic descrip
tive passage which tells of flowers
and trees and butter and milk. But
a quick transition comes. The author
grows curious. .
"Where do the boys and girls come
from who go to school? we asked the
little girl before leaving. Some of
them come four or five miles to
school they told us. And how do
they get here? we quizzed. Some of
them walk and some ride on burrows,
they said. Thus we learned that Bis
be boys and girls who complain of a
few blocks are blessed beyond com
parison with .thousands of others."
Space Limits
Lack of space prohibits a further
detailed review of this article. What
surprises the next installment will
hold remains to be seen. Certainly
the Ore is to be congratulated on he
acquisition of such a brilliant writer
for its staff, and the reading public
await with bated breath the continual
of his present splendid serial.

Taking It Standing
By Grace S. Richmond of The Vigilantes.
She had had a letter from her only son that morning.
It was the sort of letter which ought to make any moth
er's heart leap with pride. But it was such startling
news that pride was instantly overcome by fear.
"Mother Dear:
"I want to enlist. I known you were glad I wasn't
called in the first conscription and I thought I was
glad. Somehow, after a little, I wasn't I've been going
round feeling like a sneak. Every time anybody con
gratulates me on having escaped I wish to heavens I
hadn't But now I'm glad I did, so I can do the thing
myself.
"I hope this won't break you all up. You don't want
me to go on feeling like a sneak, do you? I don't think
it's good for a fellow to feel that way. Maybe it's not
good for his country either. Please write at once and
tell me how you feel.
"Lots of love,
"Tom."
The first letter she wrote in answer to this began in
this way: j
"Dearest Tom: '
"I certainly want you to do what is right but I am
not at all sure that it is right in your case. You have
never been remarkably strong, though I think perhaps
you are as well as the average young man who spends
his hours behind an office desk Then, I remember how,
as a boy, you dreaded the sound of a gun. Do your think
you could bear it to kill men you, who cried your heart
out over a dead bird? Oh, do think twice about this
thing "
Then she remembered that he must have thought twice
en times a hundred times 'before he came to this
decision. She tore up the letter and began another.
"I don't know what to say to you. Of course I want
you to do what is right I wish your father were alive
the responsibility is so heavy for me. If you should en
list, do you suppose yoj could get a position where you
wouldn't have to go to the actual front? Just as useful
a position, but where I needn't feel that your life was in
danger every hour. I dou't know how I could bear that.
I -
But she didn't like the look of it. After long thought
she started another sheet.
"I have tried to write to you in a way that would in
fluence you against enlisting, but I am afraid that I 6ught
not to do that. I have hoped I might escape the awful
sacrifice of seeing you go to the war. But if you fee!
that it is surely your duty, I know I must bear my part.
You can little imagine what it is to me "
At this point she broke down and cried of course.
One can't write about one's awful sacrifices without feel
ing much worse the moment one sees the words upon
paper. That's a fixea psychological law. But bv tn
by she wiped her eyes. She wasn't a coward, and sho
felt that the words were cowardly. She tried again.
"I think it very brave of you to want to enlist, when
you still might escaie the draft. I want you to do your
duty. Of course I shall be very anxious and lonely, but
I know I must do my part. I don't want you to feel
like a sneak though I do think there are others great
strong fellows whose mothers are not widows who cou!
go much better than yo'i. But if you feel that you must
go, I shall not hold you back. "
And still it wouldn't do. Her heart was aching desper
ately, but suddenly she began to think about Tom's feel
ings when he should read her letter. Those wailing
words about her loneliness and her anxiety and her
reluctant willingness to do her duty! Was that the way
to send her boy off, with his heart heavy with fear for
her, that she couldn't bear it? Just because she was a
woman must she pull on a man? make him feel as badly
as she could make him wonder if he should ke doin
right if he left her? Why couldn't she put spirit into
him. fince he had so much of his own? If she wrote
with a fine courage, if she said nothing about what it
was going to cost her, was there any danger of his think
ing she didn't really care? Hardly!
Once more she began the sheet and at last she wrote
as she must write, if she would really do her part at
treeing his manhood.
"You're the real thing, and I'm so proud of you I'd
like to hug you! Of course you don't want to go on
feeling like a sneak and I should feel like one myself
if I let you. Go ahead and enlist, dear and I'll enlist
with you for the duration of the war as the phrase is."
It was the next day that she had her telegram from
the boy. He couldn't wait to write the words of glowing
pride in her. And as she read it she realized, once for
all, that the way to face things is to face them standing
not cowering or stooping or evading, but standing
head up, shoulders square, eyes front. '
The blow doesn't hit so hard that way.
"You are the real thing yourself. Will enlist today.
Love. Tom."
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
SOAP-BOX SEDITION.
Elihu Root is unquestionably right when he says that
"the men who are speaking and writing and printing
arguments against the war now and against everything
that is being done to carry on the war, are rendering
more effective service to Germany than they could render
in the field."
The German government long ago recognized that fact,
but The World knows no antidote for that kind of dis
loyalty except patriotism, and the best way to combat
the kind of treason that Mr. Root describes is by appeal
ing to loyal public opinion which is overwhelming in this
country even if it is not always vociferous.
In the mean time there are plenty of soap-boxes and
there are ninety-nine patriots in the United States to
every traitor. Soap-box sedition can be fought with soap
box patriotism, and whatever the fervent orators of the
street corners may have to say about the government
and the war we have yet to find evidence that anybody
lias been influenced by their speeches. Much of this
soap-box rhetoric is the product of mere controversial
vanity and love of personal notoriety, and a great deal
can be left to the common sense of the American people,
(t was sufficient to save the country in the Civil War
when Copperheadism was everywhere, and it will be
sufficient now. Our own opinion is that most of the soap
box orators are never .?o harmless as when they are talk
ing and that they are probably doing more to solidify the
country on the issues of the war than any other agency
except German diplomacy.
The one thing to remember in regard to all this speech
making is that if actual crime results the man who urged
the criminal act is equally guilty with the man who com
mitted it . '
CHANGE OF SUBJECT
I talked of war and dead men's
bones till all around were tired, and
something else than grief an1 groans
my weary aunts desired. So then I
talked about the crops, the barley and
the wheat, till people heard my soulful
yawps the whole length of the street
I said, '"I'll give them divers tunes,
from this, my willing lyre," and so dis
cussed the price of prunes, the cost of
baled hay wire. I spieled a while J"
art and song, of flowers that bloomed
in spring, and thus I chirped the whole
day long, of this and t'other thing.
And every time I paused to draw a
deep, refreshing breath, the other fel
lew plied his jaw, and talked of war
and death. When all the world is
talking scrap, and blood and sickness,
there's no attention for the chap who
speaks of buds and bees. I'd like to
hand out cheery words of wisdom to
the push, I'd like to talk about the
birds that carol in the bush. I'd sing
of sunsets in the west, that gild the
crag and tor, but when I pause to take
a rest, some chap brings in the war.
DRAFTED MEN WHO
ARE ON LEAVE TO
GO IN NEXT BATCH
GETTING THE HOYS IN THE TKEXCIIES BY CIIUISTMAS
Bisbee closed her saloons with good grace and looked
upon the enforcement uf the bone dry law with serene
placidity. The demon rum was an enemy. It was a good
thing to keep it away. But when the war tax came along
yesterday and placed the hedge of higher prices about
My Lady Nicotine, then did the average Bisbee citizen
rear back upon hishind legs and roar. The old timer
who went to buy a sack of tobacco for his pipe or a plus
for his hip pocket was met by the stern and unyielding
cl'-rk who held out his hand for more money. From a
i
time since the memory of man runneth back not to the
contrary, a rack or a plug of tobacco has been ten cents.
Cigars and cigarettes, too, cost more money than they
ever did before. It costs money to conduct a modern war
and the man who uses tobacco must pay, whecrer he
buys a Liberty Bond or not
And now comes certain adherents, henchmen and
myrmidions of the county government of Cochise and af
firm that the county has nothing whatever to do with
that stretch of road frcm the foot of Bisbee hill to the
macadam road that marks the boundaries of Johnson
addition. The county laid the macadam to the border
line of the city. The rest of the road to the hill 1b the
city's affair. Well, then, so much the worse. Has the
city street department taken an anesthetic? Is it on a
vacation? Is it in the bankruptcy court? Surely that
bit of road is calling in a loud enough voice to wake the
dead for some one to come and repair it before it be
comes impassable and traffic has to scale the sides of
the mountain to go to and fro between Bisbee and
Lowell. Already drivers are using the space in the car
tracks in order to get through. How bad does a road
have to be before it is ie-surfaced and graded again?
Places will be left in the fourth con
tingent for all those who have been
discharged for periods of from ihirty
days to six months or more, accord
ing to orders received from Federal
Agent Breen at Phoenix, by the dis
trict board at Tucson Thursday.
It had previously been ordered that
those who had received exemptions
for periods extending beyond the date
of departure of the last, contingent
would go with the second draft if
there was a second draft.
The new order means that if a man's
temporary discharge expired even
year hence, he would go to whatever
camp there is at that time as a mem
ber of the fourth contingent.
The significance of the order is that
there will be no second draft, but
that all registered men will be ex
amined and sent when ordered.
The district board at Tucson passed
judgment upon a large lumber of
claims Thursday in every county in its
jurisdiction.
The decisions were: Graham county

ARRESTED WITH PACIFICTS
"Dazzling Dora" has them dazed in Phoenix. The
staid and steady. Republican devotes considerable space
to a description of Dora'.; charms. Tut, tut, and also fie,
fie! If the state capital does not set an example for the
simple pilgrims of this bone dry Spartan state where
will a high ideal be found by the men and women of the
high places in the mountains and the wide places on
the mesa? Phoenix with her musical comedy dames
and Douglas with her c-aharet are trying to lure and ca
jole Bisbee from her picture shows and her evening
jaunts to view the sunset. But they will not suci-eed.
It is the simple life for the Border Queen. Tonight our
people will assemble to witness the dignified and In
spiring rendition of Shakespeare by the Ben Greet play
ers. In the not distant future we will listen to the learn
ed discourse of Ida Tarbell, writer and reformer supreme
of the new school. Time was when the click of the poker
chip and the bark of the Colt's forty-five were heard as
often as any other sounc in this canyon. But Bisbee
was not wedded to her old idols. She has cast them off,
and now she holds up her hands In horror at the wild
ways of Phoenix and Douglas, those Babylonian muni
cipalities that used to point to this mining camp as a
place of wickedness.
Harold S. Storey, a California news
paper reporter who was employed in
Tucson for a shore while, has been

Thursday night, in company. with oth
ers, he was escorted out of South
Pasadena by the home guards when
a pacifist meeting was raided..
Upon leaving Tucson Storey went to
the Hawaiian islands to arcept a
teaching position in a school, but ap
pears to have returned to his former
stamping grounds. He was a young,
college-bred iellow. with a ministerial
aspect, enhanced by small sideburns.
Storey was arrested in company with
Rev. Robert Whittaker at a pacifist
meeting in Los Angeles Monday.
Fifteen men were taken from the
pacifist meeting in South Pasadena
Thursday nicht. 'driven to the city
limits in automobiles and given the
suggestion not to return. Women at
tending the nieet'ng were told that
further attempts to meet would not be
tolerated . The meeting was being
held in a private residence. Indigna

the victory practically assures the fu
ture of the northern Arizona lumber

it is stated. Charles R. McCormick
and company sought to have the
freight rates fixed by the Arizona com
mission on lumber shipments from the
northern Arizona mills to points in
the southern part of the state increas
ed because they were discriminatory
as against the San Pedro jobbers. Had
this increase been allowed, it was
claimed that the Arizona mills would
have been unable to compete with San
Pedro and thus their only favorable
market would have been closed with
the ultimate result thai the mills could
not long continue to operate.

The arrest was made on the road near

looking for bootleggers when Percy
spied an automobile coming down the
Rodeo road. The officers stopped the
men and questioned them as to where
they had been and where they ere

were coming from Rodeo and that they
were on their way to LOuglas. They
said there was nothing in the car.
While the men told a fairly straight

ed queerly and he thought a search
necessary, so he wen through the ma

of the machine he could find nothing
until it dawned on him that possibly

BARNES CIRCUS IS
NEWER AND BIGGER
THIS YEAR EVER
Fliting as the pleasures of the cir
cus itself, the contract man of the Al.
G. Barnes circus paid his annual visit
to Bisbee, hurrying from city hall to
varioifs newspaper offices, hunting up
grounds on which to place the "big
top," reserving billboard space and
attending to the thousand and one
things necessary to placing the big
amusement plan in our midst.
. Friday, October 26, is the day set
for this biggest and best wild animal
circus. The Barnes Circus has made
a distinct place ' for itself in the
amusement world by adhering to a
standard rule, hundreds of people are
required to carry on this exclusive
animal actor program, as each set of
animals must have a teacher and help
er. Pretty girls have been chosen
mostly for this work, as their sensa
tive natures give them a clearer und
erstanuing of the bmtishness of the
fiercest jungle beasts. They are less
prone to confusion than the man and
present a prettier picture. The
strength of wild animals is' so tre
mendous that mere man strength
amounts to nothing; it is the courage,
fearlessness and self-assurance that
counts most, and these are the quali
fications women seem to possess.
Over 1,000 wild and domestic ani
mals are carried by I! lis big animal
wizard and a program full of dash
and ginger is given in 65 feature acts.
A brand new feature is a big animal
pageant by the entire ensemble. A
jungle nursery, where the baby ani
mals, of which the show has a num
ber, are placed together. A person
ally conducted tour of the animal
tent, under the guidance of a compe
tent lecturer and attendants, designed
especially to give children and teach

and New York City, committed sui
cide here this afternoon shortly after
leaving the hospital where he had
been for the past several days re

On Public Road.
The tragedy occurred on the state
highway in a thickly populated part
of the north city while be was out
riding with Miss Marian Browning,
the daughter of George E. Browning,
a brother of John M. Browning, the
gun inventer. Giving as an excuse
that he desired to leave the automo
bile before turning around to leave
for the city young Dupont stepped out
of the car and walked back a few
paces and then drawing a' new pistol
from his pocket placed it to his head
and fired. The bullet passed through
the head. The sound of the shot at
tracted the attention of women and
children in an orchard and they rush
ed to the spot where the young man
fell, arriving there at the same time
as did Miss Browning. The young
man was placed in an automobile and
rushed to a local hospital where he
died about two hours later.
Wanted Health.
Dupont came west for his health a
short time ago and went to the ranch
of J. S. Turner at Lost Creek, a few
miles east of Ogden. He said that
he decided to gain health and strength
preparatory to enlisting upon an
American submarine destroyer. The
family of George Browning who have
a lodge on their ranch met young
Dupont several weeks ago. While at
the Turner ranch Saturday Mr.
Browning was informed the boy was
ill and brought him to an Ogden hos

physicians.
He was discharged from the hospi
tal today and accepted an invitation
to go for a ride with Miss Browning
at 4 o'clock. The tragedy occurred an
hour later.
RECOMMENDS THAT
MARRIED MEN GOME
TO THE SERVICE LAST
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. Oct. 5. Recommenda
tions that the liability of married men
subject to military service by con
scription be postponed until all avail
able unmarried men shall have been
called into service are made in a list
of suggestions for the guidance of the
administration of the draft act pre
pared here by a number of local board
members, addressed to the president.
the governor, the provost carshal and
state adjutant general.
Drafting of married men, while sin
gle men without dependents are not
called, results, the recommendations
say, in "much intense public dissat
isfaction and resentment which, as the
number of such cases increases, must ;
more and more seriously impair public
confidence in the whole principle of
conscription, and to that extent the
successful conduct of the war."
It also causes "the indefinite sep
aration of husbands and wives, which
inevitably tends to produce serious
moral and social dangers." The rec
ommendations continue: "It exercises
an adverse influence upon future child
birth, which is naturally fewer in war
times; and imposes unnecessary pub
lic burdens .in increased casualty and
death payments, and unnecessarily
withdraws from production the older.
more experienced and established
men.
The recommendations also suggest
that registrants be examined only as
fast as the government can put them
In cantonments, and also that power
be conferred upon local boards to dis
charge registrants who, in good faith,
support dependents, whether or not
they belong to classes specifically
enumerated in the regulations.

Sonora Expected
to Return Soon
'By Review LeasPd Wire)
NOGALES, Oct. 5. The local draft
exemption board announced today
that it had sent word to a colony of
about 400 alleged draft evaders, now
in a town in Sonora, that if they would
return and undergo their examina
tions for service in the national army
they would be given the benefit of
Provost Marshal General t'rowder's
instructions regarding leniency in
such cases.
According to reports received here,
the plight of the men is such that
they are expected to accept the
chance to come home and discharge
their obligations. It was reported by
persons returning from Sonora that
employment had been refused them
by Americans controlling the larger
industries; that, hotels had refused,
them accommodations and that many
of the men were destitute.
The Southern Pacific company of
Mexico has offered to return without
charge any who will agree to report
to the exemption boards on arrival
Trainmen say groups of the men
gather at every station and scan
American newspapers to see whether
they may return for duty without lin

REVIEW WANT ADS
BRING RESULTS.
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few nin
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

XEW YORK, Oct. 5. Stocks re- ,

early period of indecision in which .
some specialties mad further ma-,

Tha rallv wh ch ,
seemed to proceed from p. combina
tion of substantial support and short
covering, embraced many active is
sues, but was most effective In the
investment division.
Interests committed to the construc
tive side of the market professed to
derive much encouragement from the
expected early adjournment of con
Ere?s. and an added factor of favor
able Import was found in the Indica-
ticns of a further relaxation of money
ratos The suggestion of the local,
federal reserve board to limit loans American Zinc 16

was in line with the attitude of thsjc. and A 744
main body in Washington.
Rails responded one to four points,
the Pacifies, Reading. New York Cen
tral and St. Paul reflecting a special
inquiry. Low-grade western and south
western issues, as well as coalers,
kept pace with the movement, though
in minor measure.
Industrials- were Irregularly respon
sive. United States Steel assuming its
accustomed place of prominence on
the rise from 105fc. yesterday's to

of Vi. There was further liquidation
of Bethlehem steels. Midvale steel.
Colorado fuel, oils, tobaccoes and
utilities. Sales amounted 16 770.000
shares. International bonds, includ
ing the French municipals, were
heavy, other war flotations showing a
lower trend on wider distribution. Do
mestic issues were irregular, the Lib
erty 3's varying from 99.76 to 99.82.
Total sales (rar values) aggregated
$3,475.0fC. United States coupon 3's
gained per cent on call.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 5. Prospects of
light receipts for some time led today
to a material upturn in the corn mar
ket. Prices closed firm. to to
net higher at 119 December and
116 May. Oats finished Unchanged to
J4 up. and provisions at the same as
yesterday's finished to advance.
Strength in corn values developed aft
er the fact became apparent that bids
from here to the interior had been
accepted only to a meager extent. The
scantiness of the response was taken
to indicate that the farm demand for
the feeding of hogs would be in
creased so as to absorb much of the
supply when would be otherwise forth
coming. Under these circumstances a
moderate decline at the outset was
soon much more than overcome.
Oats hardened in sympathy with
corn. December delivery of oats
lagged, however, owing to apparent
complete stoppage of buying for ex
port. Purchases of lard and meats for
Belgium and Great Britain gave
strength to provisions, especially
nearby months. I was said 20,000,000
pounds were taken for Belgium alone.

NEW YORK, Oct. 5 The market
was higher all around. Many attempts
were made by the various contingents
1 to precipitate a renewal of liquidation.
but on the whole downtown offerings
were rather light There was not as
sociated with the advance any particu
lar news, and the same seems to have
resulted in large part from short cov
ering. Congress will adjourn Satur
day, so that attention for a while is
not likely to be focused on Washing
ton to as great an extent as hereto
fore. Judged by the usual standards,
stocks are cheap, but until there are
more distinct signs of investment b'ty
Ink overshadowing forced and arbi
trary liquidation there will no doubt
be experienced much Irregularity .

'Master Spy9 Is
Aires ted by the
U.S. Authorities
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 5 Further
details of the hunt United States au
thorities are conducting for German
agents in San Francisco became
known today when it was announced
that a presidential warrant bad been
requested for Conrad Schirman, Ger
man chemist here, who has been held
in custoday secretly for the last five
days.
Federal authorities called Schirman
the "master spy.' His activities (
they said, consisted of organizing a
plot to place bombs in the cargo of
ships leaving for orinetal ports and
of attempting to bribe an officer of
the Deutsch warship Zealand, which
was in port here recently to carry
messages to consuls in Holland. These
messages, the federal authorities de
clared, were of grave importance. In
them, Schirman was alleged to have
related the unsuccessful attempt to
effete the escape of Frani Bopp, for
mer Deutsch consul general here,
from an internment camp on Angel
island. Three men were convicted of
attempting to effect Bopp's escape.
'I will do anything to assist the
'atherland," was one o the statements
federal authorities said Schirman
made in the messages.
