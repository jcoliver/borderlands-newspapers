WASHINGTON. Dec. 10. Copies
of instructions telegraphed by Wil
liam R. Hearst to the editors of
his newspapers and of other mes
sages received and sent by him at
Palm Beach, Fla., early in 1917,
Just before the United States en
tered the war, were read today into
the record of the senate committee
Investigating brewers and Germaa
propaganda. They were taken
from the files of the department of
justice and given to the committee ;
by A. Bruce Bielaski, chief of tho
bureau of investigation. I
Mr- Hearst's messages directed that
editorials advocating embargo on
shipments of munitions and food to
the allies be prepared for his Nev
York papers; instructed that a "ref
erendum peace vote" in the olectioj
dibtricts in each cit7 where. Hearst
organs were printed be taken, and
that Windsor Mackay prepare a car

DOUBTS ZIMMERMAN EXPOSE
Other of the telegrams related to
the famous Zimmerman note, In which
Germany proposed an alliance with
Mexico and Japan and which the As
sociated Press revealed to the world.
One message, signed "Doctor," and
sent from Palm Beach, said the note
probably was a forgery prepared by
the attorney general "to frighten con
gress into giving the president the
powers he demanded and perhaps also
Into passing the espionage bill."
This telegram was dated March 2(
and was sent after "Van Hamra" at
New York had telegraphed Hearst at
Palm Teach a copy "of the Instruc
tions as sent by Dr. Alfred Zimmer
man, German foreign secr'.ary.' to
German Minister von Eckhardt in
Mexico through von Bernstorff, now
in possession of the United States gov
ernment. "
On March 1, S. S. Carvalho of the
New York American, sent Mr. Hearst
a telegram saying that "Senator

AS PRESIDENT
Makes This Plain at Cabinet
Meeting at Which He Pre
sides; Wilson Passes the
Azores Tuesday
WASHINGTON, Dec. 10 Vice
President Marshall presided over
today's cabinet meeting, at the re
quest of President Wilson, who Is
en route to Europe and set, ac
cording to the White House staff,
a precedent in the conduct of
American executive affairs. No
other vice-president, so far as rec
ords show ever presided at a cab
inet session.
In taking his seat, Mr. Marshall set
at rest any theories that he might be
acting as president. He said he was
attending 'the gathering "informally
and Impersonally, not undertaking to
exercise any official duty or function."
Before going to the White House.
Mr. Marshall explained that the presi
dent, before departing for Europe, ask
ed him to preside at the caoinet meet
ings and had repeated the request by
wireless from the George Washington.
Mr. Marshall made it plain that he
had no idea of exercising the func
tion of the President.
No business requiring the attention
of the president developed' at the
cabinet session, it was said, and the
wireless carried no message from it
to the presidential ship.
The cabinet meeting today was the
last which Secretary McAdoo will at
tend, as he will be succeeded next
Monday by Carter Glass. Mr. Mc
Adoo bade farewell to members of the
cabinet and attaches of the executive
offices, although he will remain in

of the Americans at the Rhine a com

four bridges spanning th stream, two
here and one in the north and another
to the south, over which the American
arpiy js expected to rrjss Dwrabr

Col. James Rhea of Texas, head of
the American commission, has been
dealing for four days with the local
authorities on questions incident to
the taking over of the bridgehead. In
stead of antagonism or even passive
acquesence he encountered co-operation.
The mayor of Coblenz issued a
proclamation in which he requested
the inhabitants to refrain from all
acts of discourtesy or violence and to
accord the Americans such assistance
as was possible. It was due to the
mayor's request, supplemented by one
from the military commandant, that

While the Americans were marching

United State Urges Both
Chile and Feru to Take Ev
ery Step to Preserve Good
Relations
By Kt-vifw Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 10 Informa
tion reaching the state department to
day indicated that the situation with
respect to Chile and Peru growing
out of ihe disputed ' provinces o?
Tacna and Arica, is more hopeful.
The L'nited States has urged both
countries that every step be taken to
preserve amicable relations and it
was said that the offer of the Ameri
can government to adjust the dispute
was mfcde with a view to preserving
peaceful relations throughout the
American continent.
Peru has accepted the offer of the
United States, but no official word
has come from Chile. Officials, ac
cordingly, showed great . interest iu
press dispatches today from Buenos
' Aires,'- saving there is a tendency tn
Chile to accept, the Argentine offer
and refuse1 the tender of good offices
of the United States.
It was learned today that President
Wilson' had gone abroad prepared to
meet any query regarding "the rela
tions between Chile and Peru. For
months the bureau which was devoted
to gathering data regarding the vari
ous nations of the world and the
troublesome questions involved is
known to have been working upon
the trouble that has existed in South
America since Chile's victory over
Peru in 1S79. :
The treaty', of -A neon, signed in
ISSa, fcrovided for '. plebiscite in the
two provinces of Tacna and Arica in
ten ytars .to determine whether the
proTinces should remain the territory
of Chile or become part of Peru. The
plebescite has never been held. Peru
is said to claim that Chile made im
possible conditions regarding the
plebescite, such as the control of the
officials of the election and the rights
of all inhabitants in the two provinces!
to vote. Chile is understood to con
tend that she was ready at the ap
pointed time to hold the plebescite,
but that Teru refused to agree to it.
Chile, accordingly, now claims the
question is, settled and Tacna and
Arica are Chilean territory.

SAN DIEGO. Calif.. Dec. 10. Ex
tensive preparations for aerial mail
service to all parts of the United
States from San Diego are being made
by war department. Air mapping ope
rations, now welt under way. will be
amplified early next week, when a sec
ond air squadron will leave Rockwell
field for a flight o Needles and re
turn. Authority for the flight has been re
ceived from the war department.
The next air mapping operation, to
be carried out by the Rockwell field
airmen probably will be into the states
of Utah. Wyoming and Nevada.
No authority for making flights into
this territory has yet been given by
the director of military aeronautics,
although notification of the desire of
the war department to chart those
states has been received.
Officials of Rockwell field today
declared that while they could not
state officially that Calexico and Phoe

aerial mail carriers bound to and from
El Paso and San Diego, they believe
that these two cities should be includ
ed in the list of stops.

The total value of the property to be

Here, as at Treves, the Americans
are dealing with the de facto author
ities. The workmen's council is main
taining a commission but the officials
found were those who long had been
functioning and the Americans are
leaving to them the problem of ar
ranging their own affairs in the new
party's council. As an indication,
however, that the determination not to
treat with the council will not cause
any trouble for the American commis
sion, is the re.eipt of various mes
sages signed by Mathias Erzberger,
dealing with subjects which the Amer
icans have discussed with the mayor.
The Americans have not attempted
to interfere in any way with local in
stitutions or the manner of life of the
people. The inhabitants retire and
arise when they please, and permis
sion is even given to those whose busi
ness requires it to cross and re-cross
the Rhine at will.
UNDER YANK CONTROL
COISLENZ. Monday, Dec. 9. 10 p. ni.,
(By the Associated Press.) Coblenz
tonight is under the complete military
control of the Americans, with the
municipal authorities co-operating.
The American forces comprised the
second battalion of the 39th infantry
which arrived here this afternoon to a
request from the German authorities.
The reception of the Americans was
most friendly. The last German
troops left Coblenz Sunday morning.
There was no trouble of any kind
and none is expected. Some citizens
of Coblenz said they felt better now
that the Americans had arrived.
The friendly spirit with which the
civilians of Coblenz greeted the Amer
icans began to evince itself in the vil
lages along the railroad over which
the Americans came to Cohlen?. At
many places Sunday crowds of chil
dren cheered and waved their hands
as the Americans passed. The 'spirit
displayed became more friendly as the
Americans approached Coblenz. When
tha. Americans arrived and detrained
in an outlying section of the city they
were met by a large crowd, including
municipal officials. Among the others
waiting to see the Americans were
two professors with all the pupils of
a boys' school.
The train which transported the
Americans to Coblenz was manned by
a German crew, the American soldier
occupying coaches formerly used by
German troops. One coach carried
newspaper correspondents.
The battalion is commanded by Lt.
Col. James Locke, with Maj. Fred
Hackett second in command. In ad
dition to their rifles and ammunition,
the soldiers carried full packs con
taining emergency rations and addi
tional food supplies were brought by
the train to tide the men over until
ration trains arrive.
When the Americans took up guard
of the Coblenz ends of the Rhine
bridges, German soldiers were doing
sentry duty on the opposite ends. To
night the American sentries along the
Rhine could see the lights of the for
tress of Ehrenbreitstein, which stands
on a rocky promontory 400 feet above
the river, where several regiments of
German soldiers still are quartered.
It is said- that the fortress can accom
modate 100,000 men.
The Americans will not cross the
Rhine until further orders, the bat
talion remaining in Coblenz more in
the nature of military police until ad
ditional forces arrive.
manifestations of fear that a heavy
' burden may fall upon the Rhenish
' provinces unless they separate from
Germany and also of growing animos
ity toward Berlin.
The Bavarians of Palatinate in a
large majority hostile to any further
connection with Prussia. Some of
them declare that the Rhine should
be the new frontier. There also are
suggestions that state-owned property
such as the coal fields in the valley
of the Saare would pay the share of
the Rhenish province of Palatinate in
the bill that the allies may present to
Germany.
Business men in Saarbmck and
Saarelouis today dwelt upon the ad
vantage of closer commercial relations
between the Rhenish provinces and
Alsace-Lorraine and France, and did
not . conceal their apprehension of
economic disaster if the military oc
cupation should obstruct commerce
across the Rhine.

An Old Marshal of
France and a New
Those Lorrainers held the celebration of
all the history of that famous province of
Metz the other day when President Poin
caire conferred the honor and baton of a
marshal of France upon Petain. Premier
Clemenceau was there, and Marshals Joffre
and Foch and General Pershing. The
ceremony took place in the plaza where
stands the statue of Marshal Ney and .
French troops who had taken an immor
tal part in the greatest battles of the war
were there, and an .American regiment also .
stood at parade before the statue.
Are the dead given to know aught of the
affairs of the living? Who can say? But
surely that figure of bronze thrilled with
the old marshal's flame as it looked down
from its pedestal upon the new born glory
of France. And it was fitting that the
finest of all French triumphs should have
taken place before the statue of Marshal
Ney. For France never had a greater or
more glorious figure than Peter Ney, the
red headed son of a peasant innkeeper, who
rose by his bravery and genius to be a duke
and a marshal of France.
At the battle of Essling, Napoleon gave
Ney the proud title, "the bravest of the
brave," when he rode hi3 horse belly deep
into a little stream before the town and
waved his sword all indifferent of the rain
of bullets that made the water boil around
him. It was Ney who commanded the
rear guard in the retreat from Moscow and ,
saved the remnants of Napoleon's grand
army. Ney fought like a lion at Austerlitz,
Jena, Leipsic and all those battles, when
the emperor made his last stand in France
against overwhelmning odds. But 5t was at
Waterloo that he won his greatest glory.
In command of the Old Guard there, he had
seven horses killed under him during the
day, and as the twilight stole upon that
stricken field, Ney, waving a stump of a
sword, left to him by an English cannon
ball, advanced on foot at the head of the
grenadiers, exclaiming : "wait and you shall
see how a marshal of France dies on the
battlefield." But he did not die there. He
was reserved for death at the hand of a
Bourbon king, who never learned anything
or never forgot anything. He faced the
French firing squad, this, hero, who had
shed his blood twenty times for France,
and died as he had lived, "the bravest of the
brave."
And so it was eminently fit and proper
that Petain should be named marshal in the
presence of all the great of France of to
day, with Marshal Ney presiding over it all
from his marble heighth. H had earned
this high honor many times over. This
great France of today was but paying the
the debt that a little France of another day
had failed to pay. A small atonement for
that firing squad at dawn of a dark dav.
Petain could well be proud to receive his
baton under the protecting and benignant
shadow of the old marshal of Napoleon's
day.
This column viewed with alarm the
other day, the utterances of President Wil
son and Winston Churchill of England,
upon that most delicate and vital subject,
the freedom of the seas. President Wilson
has been quoted as favoring disarmament
and a general balance of sea power among
the allied nations! Churchill was quick to
speak for England against this plan.
England is an island with far flung col
onies in all of the seven seas, and her very
life depends upon her power at sea. Her
navy has saved her more than once in the
past and its service in the great war is too
fresh in the minds of all to be referred to
now. And England, since 1 81 2. has been
fair and just and most unselfish in her use
of this power at sea. This is the one and
only question over which she would show
anything but the utmost tolerance and pati
ence and conciliation in her differences
with her allies upon peace questions. And
already it has arisen. This is the greatest
danger of the peace conference. And ev
ery German junker, still hugging to him a
hope, and every German sympathizer, still
cherishing a fond delusion, is taking fresh
courage now, and again pushing the old
propaganda game, in the effort to dodge
the draught of the dregs of defeat in a con
troversy between England and America
over naval armaments. England's navy is
the breath of the English life. It has just
saved the world and the nation, friendly or
unfriendly, that undertakes at this time, of
all times, to question the British seapower
or rival it, is at least presumptious and cer
tainly ungrateful and is endangering the
peace ofthe world before the clouds of war
have fairly lifted. This column does xiot
believe that President Wilson even contem
plates any controversy with Britain over
sea power, and instead of maintaining a
sinister silence, he should come out and say
so and thus quiet the alarm in both coun
tries that has been raised by the spread of
unwarranted and foundationless articles by
featherbrained correspondents. '
SUGGESTS JOB FOR M'ADOO
, (Mobile, Ala., Register.)
Eminent engineers again pronounce the
tunneling of the English. Channel feasible.
The project has been talked of for . forty
years, and its feasibility admitted, but for
political reasons the tunnel was not permit
ted to be built. Also, for the same number
of years people have had to make the pas
sage between England and France in boats,
and suffer the great anguish of seasickness,
under conditions of peculiar severity. Now
that war conditions may be regulated, how
ever, the political obstacle is removed, and
the project has come once more under dis
cussion. We should not be surprised if
our Mr. McAdoo, the builder of the Hud
son river tunnel, were asked to take the
work in hand. It is a job about his size;
and he would make a success of it as quick
ly as any other man alive.
FLIES 128 MILES AN HOUR
(Boston Globe.)
The Gallaudet type D-4 biplane, a giant
all-white (machine, built at the plant in
Warwick, was given a successful trip a few
days ago in the presence of naval officials.
Upon the completion of the trial Com
mander Wessan, head of the naval inspec
tion delegation, said the machine was the
fastest in the air, having made 128 miles
an hour.
The machine was put through many
"stunts" and a stiff trial, which extended
from this city to Newport.
Again has the pro-German policy of
Hearst and his papers been brought before
the public gaze, this time by a government
agent, who declares that the wcrst of the
German propagandists in this country dur
ing the war relied upon Hearst and his
papers as their greatest asset in moulding
public opinion in favor of the unspeakable
Hun and his methods and madness. Hearst,
can protest and deny until he is black in
the face, but the fact remains that his un
American folly bordered close upon, if it
did not cross the line of treason. He bears
the brand and it should be kept before the
public gaze.
Henry White, the only republican mem
ber of the American peace commission, is
being assailed by many papers of the coun
try for his publicly expressed pro-Germanism
before and at the outbreak of the war.
It is unfortunate that President Wilson
should select such a man for such an im
portant position. There are plenty cf able
republicans ' whose Americanism is 1 00
per cent.
If President Wilson could only persuade
that peace commission to cut the price of
butter, eggs and beef, his trip to Europe
will be defended to the last, as a great suc
cess, (by the average citizen of this (republic.

! VIENNA. Monday, Dec. 9, (liy the
Associated Piesj.) Austria's desper
ate efforts in 1917 to withdraw Iro:n
; the war were described In a state
i ment to the Associated Press today
! by Count Czerin, former Austro-Hun-j
gariau foreign minister. General Lu-
ceudortf, the German thief quarter
master genera!, was the great stumb
ling block and Austria feared, in un
dertaking a separate peace w.tii lUt
entente that Germany would declare
war on her.
"I never thought it possible to beat
the entente, particularly after Amei
ica entered the war," said Cium
Czerniu. i
"A separate peace would have
meant war with Germany. I have
proof mat Germany at once wuuiu
have made war on us.
"Even supposing we had turned to
the entente and had succeeded in win
uing the war there never would have
been any winning side for us because
the entente, by the conference of Lon
don in 1916 promised freedom to the
various peoples of the empire, leaving
us in the divided condition we are at
the present time."
Referring to Germany, Count Czer
nin said there was ouly one group bent
upon a victorious peace and declaring
that England must be crushed.
"This was the military party," he
went on. "headed by Ludendorff, who
is a remarkable military man. Dut
it was our misfortune that he was too
popular with the soldiers; so the em
peror needed him and could net send
him away.
"I sent Emperor Charles a letter, a
copy of which I have at your disposi
tion, declaring to him that the subma
rine warfare surely would fail; that
we would never win and that we must
force Germany to conclude peace. I
told him a revolution was coming;
that Emperor William would lese his
throne and that he himself would lose
his throne and that every government
head must see that we were the losers.
"America's entrance, I pointed out.
meant our ruin; her influence would
be felt within a few mcuths in spite
of the balief in Germany that America
would never be able to arrive In time."

STATE F PROBE
ONE OF ACTIONS!
OF LEGISLATURE
Investigation Deemed; Esen
tial by Many Legislators Be
cause of Departmental Expenditures
PHOENIX. Arjz., Dec. 10. One cf
the first things which the new legis
lature will probahly do will be to ap
point a committee of its members or
a special commission to look into the
condition of all state funds. The
report of this committee will be re
ceived and in hand before any ap
propriations are made for state de
partments. The investigation Is deemed essen
tial by many legislators because of
the disclosure that many state de
partments have exceeded by large
sums appropriations niado by the leg
islature for their support being en
abled to do so because of revenue
from sourcea other than direct taxa
tion. Unless some curb is pla,ced on this
practice, neither the legislature nor
the new governor can get very far in
working economies and state officers
can run riot on expenditures without
any check on them by the legislative
body or the executive.
Governor Up Against It
Some idea of what a new state gov
ernor is up against and the legisla
ture as well when It comes to inaugu
rating a program of economy may be
gained from the following facts gath
ered by the State Taxpayers' associa
tion. Big Prison Deficit
The budget upon which the tax
levy for the next year 1918 was
levied, contained an item of J33,
456.58, levied to meet a so-called
deficit in prison maintenance. All
meaning that the management of the
state prison had used all the taxes, all
the other revenues and had over ex
pended beyond those two sources of
supply, the sum of $33,456.58. Go
ing back to the legislative appropria
tion. The legislature said that
$100,000 and no more should be ex
pended for maintenance of the state
prison. In the 1917 general ap
propriation bill it also said: "That
no deficit shall be created nor shall
any. warrants be issued nor any ob
ligations be incurred in excess of the
amounts herein appropriated." Vet
in the face of the fact that only
$100,000 was appropriated for pris
on, maintenance, the prison manage
ment actually used $161,363.77 for
iBeintenauce of the prison for the
single year.
A Trust Funds Juggled
Among the amounts ot receipts
from other tsources than taxes in each
year, there have been amounts deriv
ed from sales ot state lands.
These amounts should have been put
at interest, that such interest might
become available for support of spe
cific state institutions, and might to
the extent of the amount of interest
oornofi lessen the fax burden other-
tnat support.

Fake and Forgery
The message regarding the Zimmer
man note, signed "Doctor" read in
part, as follows:
"Agree with Francis. Zimmerman
note all probably absolute!. fake, and
forgery, prepared by very unscripu
lous attorney general's very unscrupu
lous department. Everybody knows
that the secret police are the most
conscienciousless , manufacturers of
forged evidence in the world.
"Gregory's whole career in office as
Francis showed in recent editorial,
has beeu a spy center and plot con
ceiver. He has not been bound by
morals, facts or tiie constitution. He
has. employed the secret service to
enforce England's unlawful orders. He
has attempted to put a bill through
congress to make any criticism of his
acts or of the president's .acts or ot
any political move or measure treas
onable and punishable as such.
House Corporation Lobbyist
"He is possibly violently pro-British.
He is surely violently pro-corporation.
He is located whore he can do the
corporations the most good and he
has been unwilling to be removed or
they have been unwilling to have him
removed even for a position on the
supreme benc?i. He and Burleson
are House's appointments and House
has been a corporation lobbyist all his
life. j
The object of the Zimmermann
forgery was to frighten congress into ,
giving the president the powers that j
he demanded and perhaps also into
passing the espionage bill. When Wil-;
son wanted to give away the rights
of the United States in the Panama;
canal he pretended that he had pri-
vate information of a dangerous In-1
ternational situation sufficient to jus i
tify his acts. He has never revealed j
his private information and no one i
now believes that he ever had any. j
Charges Evidence False ;
"He could pot repeat this Talse j
claim on this occasion so a complais-!

evidence to enable Wilson to have his!

is that the whole pejsple of this coun
try, ninety per cent of whom do not

because of these misrepresentations
and these forged documents, it they

tioned several times in the inquiry,
..sent Hearst a message from New
i York, under date cf March 1. saying
he believed the story of the Zimmer
I man note was a "hoax." and that the
'document was "planted by British
j agents."
Would Restrict Wilson
j Under date of March 3. Hearst sent
ithese messages to Carvalho:
j "I feel congress should remain In
'continual session and protect the peo
ple's liberties.- This making a dic
tator of president, desperately dan
Jgerous precedent. It may do no hn
! mediate harm with a good president,
; but it may do immense injury with
i some bad one. Wilson is
1 federalist, as I wrote in first year of
j his term and as Francis showed, in
i alien and sedition editorial. The fed
! eralists are autocratic in tendency.
President of this republic to
iday has more power than any king, in
(any constitutional monarchy in the
j world. If he gets more he will be a
dictator and possibly a desKt. It is
'the duty of true democrats to be vigi
lant, especially as all these encroach-
ments on popular rights are being
jmade' in the name of democracy."
i Cartoon for Mackay
Markay could make strong eight
column cartoon occupying in depth
two-thirds editorial page, showing

picture to be quote watchful waiting,

Uncle Sam, your neighbor, Japan. Is
eagerly awaiting ap opportunity to
strike you in the back."
Under date of March 4. this tele

day explaining my opposition to such
powers and advocacy of extra session
was not printed in Sunday paper,
please elaborate it some what and
make it an editorial approving ac

Wilson, say he Is good president and
undoubtedly meant to use power for
good purposes but the precedent is a
dangerous one to establish and sen

rights and rrotect the liberties of the
people.
Senate Honor Roll
"Say that the few senators who
voted to retain the rights and func
tions of that body constitute a roll of
honor. They did not lack respect for
president, but they had a greater re
spect for the institutions founded by
the fathers. The day will come when

immediate action to check or stop
Hale dispatches. They come by wire

bidders had competed with a good
deal of spirit. After the bulge, how
ever, realizing by holders set in, and
attention centered on the fact that
arrivals here were on a more liberal
scale than had appeared likely. Rela
tive weakness followed, and at the
last nearly all gains had been wiped
out.
Continued demand from the sea
board together with good domestic in
quiry gave steadiness to oats.
Food administration measures to
stabilize hog quotations tended to
strengthen provisions.

GEIGER AND MEN OF COMPANY
A DESERVES MORE THAN PASS
ING MENTION BECAUSE OF PO
SITION IN DISTRICT
The departure of Lieutenant Gelger
and the United States guards from
Camp Lowell is worth more than a
passing mention. This command has
been in the district for several months
and the relations of both officers and
with our citizens have been most
pleasant. The commandant is an ex
ecutive officer of more than ordinary
ability. He and his staff and the sol
diers have improved and beautified
the camn in many ways. In fact, they
have made it a model small camp.
During all the influenza epidemic not
a case was reported from the camp.
Care and attention to details, strict
regulations and intelligent effort made
this fine record. The discipline his
been rigid but never stern. Many
citizens will join the Review in praise
of these officers and men and wish
Lieutenant Geiger and his men suc
cess and happiness in new quarters.
BEAUTIFUL VASE
FASHIONED FROM
FRENCH "75" SHELL
MRS. CLYDE ADAMS OF LOWELL
HAS UNIQUE MEMENTO OF
GREAT WAR IN FORM OF SHELL
VASE FASHIONED INTO FLOW
ER HOLDER
Mrs. Clyde Adams of Lowell, has a
brass vase that is surely more preci
ous than any cunningly carved vase
of silver or gold by any famous master
of the old days. It was sent to her by
her nephew, a Kansas City boy, now
In France, and is a shell from the
great little French 75 gun And who
ever it was who fashioned this shell
casing into a vase was master work
man himself, for it is most cleverly
twisted and bent and carved to propor
tions of beauty. "Verdun" is carved
upon it, and also the French and
American flags. Sturdy and staunch
it stands, like the French poilu at
Verdun. It is an emblem of the new
France and is not alone an ornament
but a token and worth the place of
honor among the most beautiful things
of any home.

ASHURST WILL EXPLAIN U. S. EM
PLOYMENT SERVICE TO BUSI
NESSMEN MONDAY AND TO
COMMERCIAL CLUB AND PUBLIC
TUESDAY NIGHT
BecaMse of the small attendance at
the meeting called for last evening
by W. R. Ashurst. United States labor
agent here, to discuss the problem of
unemployment and the establishment
of a public agency through which sol
diers and sailors tan be placed in era
t loyment upon arrival in the district,
organization plans were noi carried
forward as had been hopT for. How
ever, upon invitation cf J. C. WhUe,
president of the- business men's ai
soclation. and C. W. Allen, of the
Warren District commercial club', Mr.
Ashurst will aopenr before the former
organization Monday night to tell its
members the needs of the situation
and the Commercial club Tuesday af
ternoon. Mr. Ashurst has calleJa meeting of
the Vommunity labor hoard, business
men and all others interestt d. to be
held Tuesday night at 7:30. o'clock at
the office of the United States em
ployment service in the Allen block.
At that time the local committee to
work in conjunction with the govern
ment, will be named. Last night's
meeting was attended by Mr. Allen,
on behalf of the Commercial club, J.
C. White on beljalf of the Business
Men's association.. J. Wilbert of
the Community labor board, -Mr. and
Mrs. Schumacher, the latter being the
feminine member of the community
labor board, and J. J. Jones of Lowell.
The labor situation with special ref
erence to the matter of placing the re
turning soldiers and sailors in lucrat
ive employment, was discussed at
length, following the reading by Mr.
Ashurst of the federal labor director's
call for the meeting, the general dis
cussion developed the fact that it was
the consensus of opinion that the
employment service already had been
valuable to Cochise county and prob
ably would be more valuable in the
future. Instances were brought to
light where the service had rendered
valuable service by finding employ
ment for idle men and in finding help
for employers who had been' greatly
in need of laborers. Instances were
cited also to show that by not keeping
closely in touch with the employment
service, business men had been put
to great inconvenience. In one or two
instances it was stated, business men
who had been in need of help readily
could have found the assistance they
desired had they placed their order
with the employment service.
Mr. Ashurst is anxious that a large
number of people shall attend the
meeting Tuesday night, as the prob
lem of unemployment is one in which
the entire community is' interested
and which all ijhoulJ labor together
to solve.

ration just as at the tiine when school
closed. So.ne changes in the teaching
force are noticed. Mr. Sindeband take3
the Spanish classes of bcth Mrs. Doug
las and Mr. Cunningham. A Mr. South
from Louisiana, is ready to take up a
prt of the work formerly taught by
Miss Kutlfdge. deceased. The auto
repair man who h id already qualified
and come on the ground, played us a
trick, and got himself in bad, by ac
cepting another job after contracting
with our board; but another will be
obtained at once, doubtless, as a night
letter sent last night would indicate.
All Spanish classes will recite at the
as per the programs that are posted
both at the V and at the high school.
The connection made since the clos
ing of the night school with higher
governmental authority, in which the
work of our schools is to receive the
sanction of the United States govern
ment, and the diplomas showing the
completion of our work receive com
plete recognition, should lend great
encouragement to many students of
the night schools.
Inasmuch as the next examination
will octur at farthest by eirlv spring
time for citizenship papers, all those
who are in that list of students should
lose no time in getting into the
classes, that all possible drill may be
had. Let the Bisbee class keep up Its
reputation with the judge of the su
perior court. Not one of our men
failed last time.

C. & A. BAND OUGHT
TO HAVE RECOGNITION
Those Warren district ladles who
have worked so earnestly and success
fully for the relief of stricken Bel
gium and France desire that some es
pecial recognition be given to the C. &
A. band boys for their free and gen
erous response to aid In this work.
When the ladies planned their Thanks
giving dance they appealed to J. L.
Clugston of the band for aid and abet
ment. Clugston conferred with the
boys and they decided to donate their
services, notwithstanding they had
been unable to give a dance for weeks.
So they signed the pledge card with
"music" for that night. The quaran
tine prevented the dance, but the
ladies appreciated the willing spirit
of the bandsmen just the same as
though they had played and made a
lot of money for the cause.

LENT SPORT
It is a matter of great gratification
to the bowlers of Bisbee to" know that
the quarantine is again orf. thus per
mitting the bowling alleys at the "Y"
to open for the season! The bowlers
have waited with great patience and
are now awarded by having the alleys
well renovated, repaired and put in
first class condition in every way pos
sible. A number have already request
ed that a tournament be started at the
earliest possible moment, some of the
teams already being in course of or
ganization. It has been decided to
admit the ladies to the tournament,
which is good news indeed. It is
aimed to open the tournament on Sat
urday. December 21. Hence it is very
necessary for every man who wants
to participate in this tournament to
leave his name at the office at the
earliest possible moment. "A rumor is
in the air that Douglas is looking
with longing eyes for the bowling tro
phy which has been held for two suc
cessive seasons by the Warren district
bowlers. Hence it devolves upon ev
ery man and woman who enjoy the
sport of bowling to get busy at once
and by continuous and thorough
practice, develop themselves for a vic
torious defense of the on-coming at.
tack.
UNDER THE YOKE AT
EAGLE THEATER TODAY
A supreme action story of variety,
color and dash, of vigor, romance and
the thrill of adventure, of the rash
and Xie of Spanish love in a vivid
Philippine setting. That is what has
been provided for Theda Bara In her
very remarkable super-production..
"Under the Yoke," shown at the Eagle
today. As the heroine of a stirring
episode during the period when th
United States quelled the turbulent
islands. Miss Bara presents a char
acter scarcely equalled before on the
seen. She is at once wilful, but
adorable; romantic, but capricious;
and artful, yet artless. And she
triumphs in the portrayal.
Another curious thing about human
nature is the way it would rather
make $25 a week and have to spend
2G to live on than li and have to
spend $17. Columbus. Ohio, State
