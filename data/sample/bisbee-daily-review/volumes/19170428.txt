of bands playing tbe Star Spangled
Banner came through the window, and
yet give him a fair trial," was a prime

SURPRISED BY
BIGNESS OF
TASK
Information Wanted By U. S.
More Far Reaching Than
Viviani Expected. Needs of
France Are Outlined.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, April 27. Confer
ences between France's war mission
and repsesentatives of tbe United
States government today broadened
in their scope.
Far Reaching Mission
The French mission left Paris with
unlimited powers to negotiate with
the United States on all subjects
military, naval, financial and econo
mic but at the time it was believed
that little more would be required of
it in this country than to salute
France's new brothers-in-arros. The
mission has found, however, that defi
nite and specific understandings con
cerning the war against Germany are
desired and the conferences are pro
ceeding on that basis.
Needs of France
Members of the mission in confer
ence with various officials informed
them today that the things France
needs most from the United States
are money, food in quantities, fertil
izers, coal, steel, oil and transporta
tion equipment for service on both
land and sea, especially a great num
ber of ships to carry materials from
the new to the old world.
The French visitors spent virtually
the entire day exchanging views and
Information with representatives of
the American government. Ground
work for joint conferences of the Brit
ish, French and American representa
tives was laid during a talk between
British Foreign Minister Balfour and
Rene Viviani, head of the French con
ferees. From Admiral Cbocheprat
and other naval members of the com
mission. Admiral Benson and other
American naval officers received first
hand information regarding the war
operations of the French navy. No
official statement concerning their
talk was made, but the French offic-

men were found who swore they could
be far under all these conditions. Tbe
government is said to regard the case
as the climax of its numerous prosecu
tions of German plots. The defend
ants include former Representative
H. Robert Fowler, and Frank Buch
anan, David Lamar and Frank S. Mon
nett. It is charged that through Lab
ors' National Peace Council, alleged to
have mainly financed by Rintelen. tbey
brought about labor troubles in muni
tions plants and among higher work
ers handling shipments.
Lamar known as the "wolf of Wall
Street," brought from Atlanta federal
prib'on, where he is serving a term
for impersonating a government offi
cer, elected to serve as his own coun
sel. He objected to being placed on
trial on tbe ground that be had been

(By Review Leaded Wire).
WASHINGTON, April 27. The
administrat'on's food control leg
"islation will be introduced in the
house tomorrow by Chairman Lev
er of the agriculture committee.
A sena'e committee is preparing
a similar b'll for early introduc
tion in the senate.
The measures will incorporate
Secretary Houston's suggestions
fcr laws to give the government
direct supervision of food produc
tion and distribution. One would
author'ze hp agricultural depart
ment to license food manufac
ture, storage and distributing con
cerns and if necessary, to operate
them for the Public. Another
would give the President power
to direct the council of national
defense or some other govern
mental agency to fix maximum
and minimum pr'ces if advisable.
A sum of $25,000,000 is. asked
for the department of agriculture
to use in carrying out the pro
gram. Officials hope it will not
become necessary to fix prices
and they believe that that power
conferred in the government will
in itself prevent the occasion
arising.

Mr. Balfour himself passed a stren

writing his first report to England,
speaking enthusiastically of his warm
reception here and eagerness of the

will be made public later in line with
Mr. Balfour's desire to take not only
the two governments, but the two
peoples fully into his confidence, was
said to contain "very Joyous news for
the British people."
Attcrney General Gregory called on
Mr. Balfour In the afternoon and Is

THE FATEFUL WHEEL
With the rolls of those liable
for service complete, the task of
selecting the men to go in the
first increment of 500,000 will be
gin. .It has been suggested that -this
be done by means of the .
county jury wheel. The first man
whose name is drawn would go,
with the first 500,000 men to be
called out for training within a
few montha The second drawn
would go with the second incre
ment to be called six months
later; the third with the third in
crement with duty a year off, and
so on.
EACH CAMP A DIVISION
Meanwhile the work of building the
cantonments will go forward. Regular
troops and national guardsmen will be
ass,Knea to wU Ml.h arm of th
I
service so represented as to proviue
tbe framework of a complete aru.y div
ision at each point The ruardsmen
will be selected firjm the territory cov-
lered by the training district so far as
j practicable. Police duty at the can
tonments will become part of the re
sponsibility of each district command
er and he will make such assignment
of his forces as he may deem wise.
Meantime both the regulars ami
guardsmen will continue recruiting to
war strength.
Officers Camps In Few Days
With the new regiments assembled,
a rigorous course of training will be
undertaken. The officers' training
camps to be established within a few
days in each district will begin at the
end of three months, pouring new of
ficers into the organization and the en-
j ijPte(i njen selected from the ranks of"
the regulars for commissions will be
I given special instructions to fit them
I for officers. Until the army of young
men presents itself at the ramps in
J August or September the regulars and
( guardsmen also will pursue a vigorous
course tf training.
Chance For Volunteer
They also call for the transfer to
the first 500.000 men obtained by draft
of from 150.000 to 200.00ft non-commissioned
officers trained in the regular
and national guard regiments. It is
here that the opportunity lies rtor men
to volunteer now as enlisted men in
the ranks of the two services. On
them, even to a greater extent than
upon commissioned officers will de
pend the efficiency of the new armies.
The backbone of any military organ
ization is its non-commissftned force.
In the months that precede the call

COLEMAN. Tex., April 27. Today's
session of the court trying Harry J.
Spanell for the killing cf Lieutenant
Colonel M. C. Butler, at Alpine, Tex.,
July 20 last, was devoted almost en
tirely to testimony of defense wit-netssc-s
intended to show that the rep
utation of Spanell was good while
that of Butler was bad.
Mrs. J. W. Rixon of Alpine testified
she heard "whisperings" about Butler
being too attentive to Mrs. Spanell.
She could not recall any person who
ad spoken to her concerning Butler.
Mrs. Spanell was shot at the same
time that Colonel Butler was killed
in Sranell's automobile. Spanell was
acquitted on the charge of killing his
wife. He testified she was killed dur
ing an altercation between himself
and Butler and the shot which killed
his wife was fired by Butler.
Defense counsel announced today
that Sapnell would take the stand in
his own defense tomorrow.

"The Fountain Beautiful"
WILLIAM H. CRANE
The beloved American actor, Will
iam H. Crane, who will appear here
at the Orpheum theatre Tuesday, May
1st, under the management of B. C.
Whitney, has passed the fifty mile
mark as a public entertainer. He en
joys the proud distinction of having
been responsibly identified with the
original production of more native
nlays than any other actor.. Some of
his best known comedies have been
"Our Boarding House," "The Henriet
ta," "David Harum." "An American
Minister," "For Money," "A Fool of
Fortune," "On Probation," "A Virgin
ia Courtship," and "Father and the
Eoys." These have kept the good
work of this famous comedian going
un to the present time, when he is
bringing to this city for the first time
a new comedy, "The Happy Stranger"
from the pens of Harvey O'Higgins
and HiriPt Ford, authors of "The Ar
cvlo t'f";." "The Dummy," and'"Po-'vp-a'v.y."
This new vehicle of Mr.
f'rflne's is fresh in story and method
t,i rii'fH from beginning to end with
-ll'rs and chuckles. The fun is so
oi'kI rnd quiet that it is a whole-"i-e
relief from the more vigorous
-sp"Hs with which the vast majority
t vir theatrical entertainments seek
w-jr fjiy into our hearts.
In this new comedy with a happy

"t 'Tt of fun. Mr. Crane is surround

Fodor Dostoievsky, the famous Rus
sian author, who wrote "Clime and
Punishment." the film version of
which is to be shown at the Central
theatre today, has had a career which
's so full of strange happenings as to
challenge the imagination of the av
erage American.
Dostoivsky wrote "Crime and Pun
ishment" while he was still in fairly
"(vA stsnrtine with the Russian gov
ernment. Ihoueh his hooks had beer
a little tno radical to suit the hiuh of
ficials. He was sent to Siberia for seven
vrars for participation in one of the
most gigantic plots ever at tempted
rirainst t' established order.
WMIe in Siberia, he wrote his fam
ous "The House cf the Dead." which
is the most remarkable word picture
of this dreary land of snow and ice
ever conceived. Dostoivsky is also
the author of "The Idiot." a book that
deals with a man who is slightly de
ficient. He is rich and has had a
most remarkably scientific education.
The result is that he seems normal.
The point which Dostoivsky brings
out is that had he been born poor, he
would have had no chance ever to be
come anything.
"Crime and Punishment" is per
haps the best known work of this au
thor, since it has been translated into
every language and has created a scn-

WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE MILITIA?
Tlie Arizona Gazette is emminently right in its an
swer to Governor Campbell's query as to why the young
men of the state were not joing the First Arizona In
fantry. Adjutant General Harris:
"Until that stable is cleaned, until the smirch which
has deepened upon Arizona military cloth throughout
the Harris regime, first by one means and then another
and ethers, all. let us grant, attributable to the occupa
tion by a basically good man of a position for which he
has no fitness, no efficiency until this is wiped out there
can be no enthusiasm created, no enlistment fervor
aroused for the First Arizona, says the Gazette.
"There is our answer to your request. Governor Camp
bell, given in no spirit of unkindness to the adjutant gen
eral, but uttered, as we conceive it, in the manner of a
duty owing to you and to Arizona and in conformance
with the frankness which each and every American owes
to his brother and his country in the present h:cr of
severe triaL In the spme rpint v-e to a step further
Get rid of Harris.
There is only one trouble with the Gazette's answer.
It does not go far enough. The Phoenix newspaper does
not explain- why Adjutant General Harris is an incubus
on the First Arizona; why his presense in the position
he now hclds is a serious detriment to the success ot
Arizona's offering to the military branch of service of the
United States in its present need.
Adjutant General Harris was a mistake from the out
set. He was never qualified for the position. Adjutant
General Harris is merely one of the mistakes in the ad
ministration of Governor Hunt. That official instead of,
desiring to actually build up the guard to a point ot
efficiency wanted an Adjutant General who would limit'
the capability of the First Arizona and render it inactive
and inefficient In Charles W. Harris, Hunt found such
a man as he desired and the present condition of Ari
zona's one regiment is mute testimony to the fact.
Politics are played in a great many guard regiments
but other states could learn a great deal in this direction
by a close study of the First Arizona. It has been one
long political fig'iL The guard has deteriorated from one
which had much promise to an organization for the
aggrandizement of Adjutaut General Harris and for the
promotion of the political fortunes of the former gov
ernor. If the feeling of a large majority of the enlisted men
ran be accepted as any sort of a criterion the officers of
the FirstArizona, installed through politics and pull,
are not of the highest calibre. There is no reflection
meant upon the men, personally. They were put in their
offices to do 'the bidding of Adjutant General Harris.
This was proren at the time of the court martial pro
ceedings in Pftoenix about two years ago. It was proven
during the last session of the legislature when the pro
Harris contingent signed petitions to the lawmaking body
of the state.
Any organization, military or otherwise, is judged by
the average of its officers. In the case of the first Ari
zona this average can hardly be very hig'i.
In Harris' efforts to build a personal machine be ha
lost sight of many necessary qualifications for officers.
In one instance lie overlooked entirely the character of
a nian, appointed to an ofliccrship. During the past few
weeks, through one channel or another, he has caused
the appointment of a man from Sout.'i or North Carolina
to a captiancy in the guard. We presume that the ap
pointee is 'strong' for the adjutant general.
It has been one long procession of politics since Ad
jutant General Harris took charge of the work. A man
who enlisted in the militia, on the whole, soon got tired
of the atmosphere. Many of them have served under
good officers, for there are many in the guard, but these
men realized the inability of their officers to make for
efficiency in their units. As a result when reenlistment
was offered the men, they refused. When the time cams
for the taking of the federal oath, they refused. Many
want to get into the regular army or into one of the
volunteer units but tlicy hav had enough of the First
Arizona.
We agree with the Gazette in toto. (let rid of Adjutant
General Harris and eliminate t.'ic polities which liavo
been played with (lie militia. This done it may be pos
sible to raise the general standard of the olhccrs of the
L'.it'j's guard.
NATIONAL PROHIBITION.
Will the war drive us into national prohibition of the
liquor traffic, as it has driven nearly all the other belli
gerents? The issue has suddenly become vital. Prohibi
tion leaders are already laying plans for a big drive
against King Alcohol as soon as congress has its urgent
military legislation out of the way. The dry states are
being urged to bring all their influence to bear for th
enlightenment of the wet states, and there will be a con
ceded effort to set befcre the whole country the lessons
taucht by the war experience of other nations.
Russia, of course, is the great example. From the
most drunken of nations, Russia has become the most
sober. Never was there such a lesson in teetotalisra. It
has meant the moral and economic regeneration of
Russia, and prevented military collapse.
The other powers furnish sobriety texts nearly as
effective. France has prohibited the use of all strong
drink, though permitting wines. England has greatly
limited the liquor consumption, with market improvement
in the health and morale of its people. Germany has
enormously reduced her production and consumption of
alcohoL So has Italy. Several small European nations,
both belligerents and neutrals, have practically abolished
alcoholic beverages.
Designed at first to facilitate the mobilization and dis
cipline of troops, the anti-alcohol measures have come
to be largely economic. They are defended because they
enable a nation to devote more energy to the war. They
make munition workers more dependable and produc
tive. They save money for the purchase of war bonds.
And they save enormous quantities of grain which nor
mally would go for distilling or brewing liquor and turn
it to use as food.
This last consideration may become the determining
factor in the American campaign for prohibition. At e
time when the nation faces a perilous food scarcity, the
argument that we can find better usese for our corn,
rye and barley than to make whisky and beer out ot'
them is sure to carry much weight. A good argument
can also be made for turning most of our existing supply
of spirituous liquors into commercial alcohol to be used
as material for explosives.

THE POST THAT FITTED.
President Woodrow Wilson has named Elihu Root as
the chairman of the commission to be sent to Russia
from the United States. By so doing he has recognized
the principal that party lines have no place in govern
ment, during a period of the kind in which we now find
ourselves, and has, at the same time, appointed the most
-rf ed ' meH -an to cne cf the most important posi
tions within his gift.
Russia is the key stone of the war. Upon Russia's
actions may depend the ultimate end of the war. Thera
is no sense in becoming hysterical about the present
on"ict and imagine that because America has entered
the war on the side of the Allies that it is all but ended
Thoueh we believe Germany or Kaiserism to be on the
wane there are certain possibilities which might turn
the tables in a very short time. Russia must be kept in
line and her government must be stabilized to the
point where that great country can continue to be of
the enormous service which it has been in the past.
To Elihu Root and his commission belongs the ardu
ous work of pointing out the Russians the way of
making a Republic. The great difficulty of the task may
he well imagined when it is pointed out that we are ask
ing a people, but recently cleared of the most notorious
nbsolutism in the world, to realize their opportunities in
days, whereas it took us years to prefect our system
if we can call ours in any sense perfect
In choosing Mr. Root for this work, the President took
into consideration the emminent qualifications Jie had
for the work. Mr. Root is known as the one of the few
leading Americans. His name is a similar leadership and
for brains. His work in the United States, as secretary
of war, as United States senator, as secretary of state
and in other important positions have proved his worth.
He knows, in all probability, more about international
law than any man alive and is as well, and perhaps bet
ter versed in the practice and history of democracy thai)
any other American. He will take to his post a know
ledge of all lands; a breath of understanding uneclipsed
in the United States and an executive capacity enjoyed
by few men in t.'ia world.
We rejoice in the selection of Mr. Root by the Presi
dent and feel that under his able guidance all may go
well with Russia in the latter country's time of need
and advice.

MAY BE AODED TO

From satisfactory results obtained
from the cultivation of rubber trees
in Southern Arizona, the rubber in

assets of this part of the country

turned to Bisbee yesterday after an
auto trip to Xogales and back.
The two men visited the big rubber
plantation on the Nogales road, 21
miles from Tucson, which is being op
erated by an English syndicate. Mr.
Bowen found that 500 acres have al
ready been planted with rubber trees
and that preparations are under way
at the plantation to increase the acre
age to 5000. The rubber trees art
raised in nurseries at the ranch and
then transplanted. The richness of
the soil and low altitude of the Santa
Cruz river valley, said Mr. Bowen last
night, are proving excellent so far fot
the cultivation of the rubber trees,
and the men in charge of the experi
ment are confident that it will turn
out a huge success. There are now
about 15 big buildings on the planta
tion and more will be built as the in
dustry expands. ,

ATTORNEY GENERAL
DEFINES ALIEN ENEMY
Alien Enemy Is Any Citizen
of a Country Which Is At
War With The United
States.
Attorney-General Wiley E. Jones
has officially designated what an
"alien enemy" Is. He states that an
alien enemy is any citizen of a coun
try at war with the United States no
matter whether the "alien enemy" is
personally hostile or not.
A telegram to the attorney -geneial
brought out the question which Mr.
Jones answered as follows:
"A citizen or subject of a hostile
country is an 'alien enemy' in law. A
country at war against the United
States is a hostile country and its
subjects, no matter where residing,
are deemed in law 'alien enemies.' As
you propound no legal question as 1
understand it. but only one of propri
ety. 1 deem it unnecessary to make
suggestions at this time. Write me

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April 27. Dealings
diminishing by ono unater lo one
third from the two previous sessions
was almost the only sifnificant feat
tire of today's professional market.
Less than naif a score cf leading
stocks made up the great bulk of the
business. Trading was marked by ir
regular advances and declines, final
quotations In the prominent issues
show-ins no change or a slight loss.
Rails and coppers were the only
stable stocks. Metals were 1 ' to 2
points higher at their best, biy sag
ged later.
Fluctuations in United Stales Steel
which ranged between ll.Vv, and 317Vi
closing at lit! unchanged on the day
were characteristic of the general
movement aside from motors, which
were increasingly heavy. Total sales
610 000 shares.
Itonds were irregular, betterment
in domestic issues, especially rails,
being neutralized by concessions in
foreign war issues. Total sales, par
value. $3,850,000. I. S. bonds un
changed on call.

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. "Api fr 27. Seventeen
cents a bushel advance for wheat was
recorded today in less than half an
hour on the board of trade, although
the big margin calls enforced of late
kept the aggregate of business rela
tively small. After many nervous
fluctuations the market closed unset
tled 3?4 to 14V, net higher with May
at 2.6714 to 2.C8'4 and July at 2.2314
to 2.244. Corn gained 2 to 4;
oats Ts to l' and provisions 25 to 92
cents.
Disclosures of the fact that the
wheat market was virtually bare of
offerings, especially of the May op
tion, set the pit wild while new ex
port bids were higher than ever be
fore. Prices for May delivery jump
ed 1 to 3 cents between sales and did
not stop until the market had reached
2.70 as against 2.53 at the opening.
A fall of H'4 quickly ensued in the
May price when holders showed a dis
position to realize profits but renewed
tightness of the market led to rallies.
New crop months, in which the bulk
of transactions took place were sway
ed chiefly by the strength of cash
wheat and of May No. 2 red wheat,
the ordinary contract grade, was com
missioned for spot delivery $3.04 a
bushel, by far the tcp price on record
for Chicago. Corn was governed
mainly by sympathy with wheat. Oats
developed only moderate strength.
Eullish foreign news did a good deal
to lift provisions.
(By L. J. Overlock)
BOSTON, April 27. The Boston
market developed a better tone today.
It points to a sold out condition and
on a smoll volume of trading prieeR
advanced easily. The day's news was
favorable for high prices for the cop
pers. The good coppers are worthy
of enjoying an advance, also all the
raw material stocks.

BRITISH FELL FIFTEEN
MORE GERMAN FLYERS
IN DAY OF THRILLS
FROM A STAFF CORRESPOND
ENT OF THE ASSOCIATED PRESS.
WITH THE BRITISH ARMIES IN
FRANCT. via London. April 27. The
German airmen had one of the great
est surprises of their lives late yes
terday. The day had been heavily ov
ercast until nearly six o'clock in the
evening, when the clouds suddenly
thinned and the sun broke through.
A few German machines had been
sighted well back of their lines dur
ing the obscured period, but when the
sun shone out several enemy squad
rons which had been housed all day
came out to stretch their wings In
the slanting afternoon's sun rays.
They bad scarcely taken the air
when the British machines pounced
upon them, and in the after tea-time
fighting that ensued, several German
machines were seen to crash and
eight others to be driven down com
pletely out of control, which are be
lieved to have been destroyed.
Between six and eight o'clock the
air filled with wonderful incidents of
deeds of daring. There were running
fights and general melees. One dar
ing young Britisher who only recently
returned to the air after several
months rest, deliberately "sat over
an enemy airdome" and watched six
enemy machines leave the ground
and beein to climb toward him. He
was sitting at 13.000 feet and remain
ed there until the leader of the chal
lenging planes had attained about
6.000 feet.
In the meantime he had noticed
that one of the hostile birds was some
thing of a stranger. It had a very
long tail and a very short nose. The
Britisher, however, did not stop to
worry about it He dived at the high
est of the climbers and gave him two
bursts from his machine gun. Down
went the German in a crash just out
side a bit of wood.
While this little action was going
on five other Germans had formed be
tween the British plane and his home
line. Firing as he came, the British- i
er tried to break through the forma-,
tion but failed. Then he turned away j
as if about to attempt an escape to- j
ward the south. All the Germans j
started in pursuit. One of them out-:
distanced the others and was ap- j
proaching the Britisher when the lat- i
ter whirled about and. fired Into the'
German at point blank range and saw :
him burst into flames. j
Next in line was the long tailed, '
short nosed stranger.
"I drove him down, too," said the
pilot's report, "but after falling a .
great distance he flattened out and
was apparently ail right."
A young khaki clad pilot was car
ried far from his own airdome, but ',
managed to cross the British line
safely just before nightfall. His ma-'
chine was absolutely riddled with
bullets, but he was unhurt
Not content with felling 15 hostile ,
machines during their brief flying in
terval yesterday, the British airmen
also downed one observation baloon
and sallied forth under the stars last I
nieht on a great bombing expedition 1
during which they upset three Ger

man trains bringing troops toward

completely derailed and the engine of
the third appeared to explode.
The Germans have evidently
brought more of their best pilots op
posite the British front to meet the
determined aerial offensive that has
been in progress since early in April.
Most of the machines met nowadays
are handled in a manner far above
the German average. It Is seldom,
however, that the Germans ever at
tack the British unless they outnum
ber them at least three to one.
A long Germaa pilot however, took
a fatal chance yesterday against a
British scout formation which was es
corting reconnaissance machines. By
clever maneuering, at which the hos
tile airman also was adept the Brit
ish managed to entice him to attack
one of theirs from behind. As be did
so. a second British machine dived
t the German's tail and down he
went one of his wings breaking off
