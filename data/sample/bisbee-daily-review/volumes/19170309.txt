MADRID via Paris. Mar. S. The

of resistance to the Cenmin submar

of espionage. The party has just
adopted an appeal to Spaniards on

Submarine warfare on merchant

PEKIN. March 8. Tuan Chi-Jui who resigned as premier several
days ago. and proceeded to Tien Tsin, returned to Pekin today and con
ferred with the cabinet and the President. A compromise has been reach
ed so that parliament may decide whether China shall break off relations
with Germany end join the entente. The foreign minister now is ap
proaching all the ministers of the entente and asking the conditions under
which the entente will jointly accept China as an ally. Japan has sug
gested that China allow cotton, wool and iron to be exported free to Japan
in return for permission to increase the niaritine customs from 5 to 7Vi
percent.
It is expected that there will be

Count Zeppelin Dies

LONDON, Mar. 8. Count Zep

patch from Berlin received by
Reuter's Telegram Company.
According to a Berlin telegram

the President expressed the opinion
that old statutes "might raise insuper

then he has received the opinions of
the attorney general and . of the sec
retary of state.
Fear Congress'll Scrap.
One problem involved in considera
tion of the situation is the probable
difficulty over the organization of the
next house because of the almost
evenly distributed balance of power
between the Democrats and Republi
cans. A long drawn fight probably
would delay action on the armed neu
trality question a contingency which
the President is determined to avoid.
It is taken lor granted in all quar
ters that before July 1, Mr. Wils'on
will summon an extra session of con
gress. The only question open to

immediately. Many members of the

that no opposition was developed.
They readily went forward under sus

after having been amended to remove

Originally this bill proposed the
abolition of the board of control and

to placing the educational institutions

It was estimated 1.000.000 tons,
or a thousand vessels of 1.000
tons each, with a speed of nine
knots, could be built at a cost of
$100,000,000 in a year. These
boats would be 1S3 feet over all

The work union? the candidates
last week shows just why the Re
view's big contest is shaping itself
into such close competition.
The big special vote offer that clos
ed last night was in effect since Feb
ruary 26. Instead of the candidates
who really want to win getting in
right at the jump and on the announce
ment of that offer, nothing was done
during the days of the 26, 27. 2S. Mar.
1. 2 and 3. Then Father Time, who
waits for no one. gave the second
warning that the special vote sched
ule would come to a close Thursday
night, and it did. At this warning
the candidates jumped into the firing
line with renewed vigor, but all start
ed at once all ended last night at
once and the result was what? Ev
erybody got about the same share.
But if tl.e wise one. the one who
really wan's to win. had made good
during the first six days of that offer,
days that practically went to waste
among the merry vote gatherers, that
ONE would have been the exception.il
one she would have gained a dis
tinctive lead.
Are You Convinced?
Now, then. Miss Candidate, are you
convinced that the contest editor is
not fooling when he says the race is
close, and that it will remain just as
close as it is. if the same lack of
quick reaction follows when the new
offer is announced tomorrow. With

(Special to the Review)
DOCGLAS, Mar. S. A delegation j
of pioininent citizens of Willcox and 1
vicinity are in the city today for the
purpose of presenting the claims of
the northern end of the county for a
new county which would practically
include the northern half of the pres
ent county of Cochis,e and take away
from the old county about fifteen per
cent of' the taxable wealth, leaving in
the old county about one hundred mil
lions of taxable wealth.
The delegation mentioned above In
cludes Hon. S. F. Langford. a business
man of Willcox now, who formerly
resided at Clifton and represented
Greenlee county in the last legisla
ture; C. W. Wisher, manager of the
Nichols Lumber company; J. Pat
Cook, secretary and treasurer of the
Arizona Lumber company; S. S. Har
denbrook, manager of the hardware
department in the store of Norton,
Morgan & Company; J. P. Cummins,
rancher, and H. O. Parks, bnviness
man of Willcox. These gentlemen lire
being piloted in this section by Tom
Fulghum. who has been here and at
Uisbee for several clays.
The claim is put forth by these gen
tlemen that with the county seat at
Tombstone they are greatly incon
venienced in transacting any business
they may have at the court house or
with the public offices. They would
be no better off if the county seat is
moved to Bisbee or Douglas, as now
proposed. With a new county and the
county seat at Willcox on the South
ern Pacific railroad every section of
the new" county would have easy ac
cess to the place for transacting pub
lic business. The claim is further
made that it would not cost any more
to the taxpayers to support the new
county than the present tax burden
amounts to and that the taxes would
not be increased in the remaining por
tion of the county, as much of the
long distance travel would be elimi
nated. It is proposed to have the petition
for county division ready to present
to the board of supervisors aboutAp
ril 1. The petition must contain the
names of twenty-seven hundred quali
fied registered voters of the county.
The new county boosters say that
they will easily secure this number
with probably one thousand more
names than is required.

opinion that if the people of the north
end desire a new county they should
be allowed to have it; it is regarded

TEXAS GOVERNOR'S
GROCERIES ALLEGED
PAID FOR BY STATE
(By Review Leased Wire)
Al'STIN. Tex.. Mar. 8. Investiga
tion by a house committee of charges
trought in the legislature against
Governor James E. Ferguson by Rep
resentative H. P. Davis, today was
concerned with the examination of
vow hers for supplies purchased for
the executive mansion. The vouchers
said to have been approved by the
governor before being turned over to
tlie state comptroller were for groc
eries, meats, vegetables, fruits, gaso
line, automobile supplies, musical
goods and other items. It is contend
ed by Davis th.it many of the sup
plies represented by the vouchers
could not properly he paid lor by the
state.
Comptroller Terrell, on the stand
to identify records, testified that war
rants had been issued from his office
to pay for groceries, under the head
of "incidentals" until the courts ruled
this was not pennissable.

FAMOUS CLUB SEEKS
FUNDS FOR RELIEF OF
SUFFERING BELGIANS
That the roar of cannon and . the
rattle of artillery are not loud enough
to drown out the cries of hundreds of
men. women and children in Belgium
who are Innoc'.-nt sufferers from the
great Eui'opean conflict, it being prov
en by the activities of many organiza
tions and individuals In this country
who are striving to ameliorate these
sufferings by raising huge sums to be
used in the purchase of food ami
clothing to be sent to the hungry and
ragged people across the sea. And
of the many organizations .which have
undertaken to aid the un.rtunate
Belgians, none has done so with more
energy and sincerity than the Rocky
Mountain Club.
Not long ago there was more than
half a million dollars in the treasury
of the c lub, which U had been planned
to use in the construction of one of
the finest club-fjuses in the world.
But when the pleading cries of the
Belgian sufferers reached the ears oi
the club's members, they unanimously
voted to abandon the plan for a new
club house and to turn over the en
tire amount as a nucleus for a fund to
be used for Belgian relief. The fund
is known as the Rocky Mountain Club
Hoover Fund, and is to be used first
jf all to relieve tfie suffering among
children in the little kingdom. Ml
members of the club, one of the most
exclusive in the i'nited States, are
working hard to make the fund one of
the largest ever subscribed in tills
country" and it is probable the vigorous
campaign which is being conducted
now. will result in the Contribution of
! hundreds of thousands of dollars.

THREATENED MEXICAN
BATTLE IS FIZZLE
(By Review Leased Wire)
KL PASO, Mar. S. An unexpected
show of forte by. both the American
and Mexican military forces was be
lieved to have caused tiie Villa reb
els south of Fort Hancock to flee to
the mountains in the vicinity of Villa
Ahmuada last night. Villa partisans
here were also given to understand
plainly yesterday that if a raid was
attempted along the border by the
Villa troops it would mean an -invasion
of Mexico in pursuit of them by
Ameiican troops and this also believ
ed to have had its effect.
It is now believed that the invita
tion sent to General Jose Carlos Mur
guia by the Villa commander, Epifa
nio Holguin to come out and fight
was a bluff, for when General Mur
guia despatched troops and followed
these troops In an automobile the
Villa band retired to the Sierras. Am
erican aeroplanes which crossed the
border today failed to locate any reb
els. Colonel Rojas Juarez, chief of staff
to General Murguia, who was in El
Paso today on private business, an
nounced that General Murguia was
preparing to retuin from Guadalupe,
where he had established his base,
after his scout cavalry had reported
no Villa troops in the vicinity of San
Martin today.

DOUGLAS MEN BOUND
OVER OH CHARGE OF
STEALING WHISKEY
Ed Fremont and P. E. Burke
Held to Await the Action
of Federal Grand Jury at
Conclusion of Hearing.
norGLS. March 8. On the charge
or breaking the seal on a railroad car
in the Douglas yards and entering the
car and stealing 40 cases of whiskey,
Ed Fremont and P. E. Burke were
held to the act Km of the fedor.il grand
jury following a preliminary hearing
this morning before V. S. Commission
er H. C. Bonrnler. Fremont's bond
was placed at $1,000 and nurke's at
$200. There was no evidence to show
that Burke was connected with the
robbery, but the" fact that he was
found on guard when 30 cases of the
whiskey were recovered later in Tirtle
villo apparently convinced the court
that he bad something to do with the
affair.
Fremont is a former railroad man.
He and Burke were arrested a week
a so tonight, the robbery having oc
curred two night previous, on Feb. 27.
Warrants were issued for five men,
the other three being T. J. Hickev,
Richard Roe and John Doe, the identi
ty of the last two not being divulged.
It is reported all three men tied fi'Jin
Douglas last week. The testimony
this morning showed Hickey left
town one night about eight days ago,
going by auto to Lordsburg.
Fifteen witnesses testified at the
hearing, consisting mostly of railroad
men who had handled the car and of
ficers wh'j worked on the case. Ger
ald Jones, of Tucson, assistant V. 3.
attorney for Arizona, represented the
government and Doan and Doan the
defendants. J. M. Treahey, deputy D.
S. marshal, was here from Tucson and
R. M. Henry and P. G. Burnham, spe
cial officers rr the E. P. &. S.
were here from EI Paso. A good
sized crowd listened to the hearing,
which took up three hours, ending at
1 o'clock.
SERVICES TONIGHT
WILL BE IMPORTANT
The revival service conducted by
Dr. Hart and Mr. McGann at the
Presbyterian Church last night was
better attended than any preceding
meeting here.
The reports of the Cottage prayer
meetings and afternoon services were
good, and arrangements were made
for their continuation. Dr. Hart made
the announcement that tonight's serv
ices were to be the most in.portan
of any of the week's services. E;
particularly urged alJ superintendent:
and Sunday School teachers to be
present.
The lesson last night was on Cor.
secratAm. Mr. McGann's solo, "ifuvt
Thine Own Way, Lord," was very cp
propriate.
Dr. Hart took his text from !' -i'
12:1 and preached a most convinciu;
sermon. It is hard to quote from i
without giving all. He said "The bes
you have is the least you want tc
offer to God. We sing 'Oh. for a thou
sand Hearts,' and do not offer one
one-hundredth part of one. We have
thought we could work the shell game
on God, but God's command is to give
the best. A self centered purse means
a miser, a self centered perston means
death. Self denial means to affirir
that it is not so. The crux of the
whole matter is consecration 'of God."
HART CONQUERS BAD
MAN IN HIS LATEST
FILMAPPEARANCE
"The Return of Draw Egan"
Is One of the Best Hart
Pictures Ever Shown Here.
- Appears Again Today at
the Orpheum.
William S. Hart, noted character of
the "movies," appeared at the Orphe
um last evening in his best produc
tion for the films, "The Return of
Drew Egan." It is a Kay-Bee Trian
gle feature and is above the usual
Hart standard. It will appear again

j Draw Egan is a bandit leader and

former lieutenant who. after attempt
ing to ruin hi-", is killed in a duel

say, Draw Fean wins the girl and the
nlaudits of the townspeople.

of the best things Hart ever appeared i
in. He appears to be nm" for the '

MODERN DANGERS ARE
STARS INPHQTOPLAY
Maurice and Florence Walton
Make Good in Films at the
Central Theatre.
"If we win any success at all be
fore the camera, it will probubly be
due in a large measure to the fart
that We are accustomed to express
(silently in the dance the same emo
tions which we must express silently
before the camera," declared Florence
I Walton in discussing her motfcin pic
ture debut with her celebrated partner
Maurice in the Famous Players Para
! mount picture, "The Quest of Life,"
'which is the attraction at the Central
theatre today.
The statement was made in reply
to the inquiry as to whether or not
Maurice and Miss Walton were appre
hensive concerning the prospect of
facing the camera for the first time.
The accomplished Miss Walton tt.'.ik
a very practical viewpoint of the mat
ter, as her remark Indicates.
"You see, every dance has its story
its tragedy or Its romence, and we
have been expressing these emotions
.silently for such a long time that it
t seems almost second nature to us,"
'continued the dancer. "Of course
ttiere is a vast difference between the
art of dancing and that of nStion pie
ture acting, but I hope that our ex
perience in one will help us to master
the difliculties of the other."
I Maurice and Miss Walton danced be
fore all the crowned heads of Europe
(and have received many exceptional
tributes of personal esteem from roy
j alty. They have danced in all the
European capitals, in South America
land in in the principal cities of the
! United States where they have in
j variably scored great successes. In
I New York they created a positive
'sensation while dancing at the ex
elusive Biltmore' Hotel.
Though "The Quest of Life" stars
these celebrated dancers, it is a dis
tinctly dramatic tale of the struggles
of a young girl whose ambitions lead
her to study stenography in night
school while she is earning her living
as cashier in a butcher shop. Obtain
ing employment in a dancing schdbl,
she becomes deeply interested In
Maurice, a celebrated, dancing star.
Her doctor tells the girl that she is
doomed to die from mafignant disease
within one year.
In a panic of despair, Ellen detei
mines to get as much out of life as
she can. When given an opportunity
to dance with Maurice, she does so
and their Dance of Death creates such
a sensation that they are starred on
the stage. Mapleton, the manager of
he theatre, takes a violent fancy to
her, and Ellen's overwrought condi
tion leads her to accept his attentions
Jer.pite the fact that she is really in
'ovc with Maurice. The struggle of
these two men for the love of Ellen,
and the wonderful regeneration of the ,
i rl v. iiich is wrought by the kindness I
'.f the one, makes a fascinating, pow-l
ciiul drama into which have been!
woven spectacular glimpses behind
.he scenes of several of the celebrated
co-stars' greatest dancing successes. J
In support of Maurice and Florence
Walton there appear Russell Bassett,
Julian L'Estrange, and others of note.

More Provincialism.
It is rather an easy matter to suppose that a man or a
woman who has never been west of Back Bay or Hoboken
might think that the western limit of the United States
was the Mississippi River. We are accustomed to th'nk
of Easterners as being extremely provincial and narrow,
but in meeting many New Yorkers, Bostonians and oth
ers from the Atlantic seaboard, in this part of the world
who have remained here long enough to have their eve:?
opened, they always proved their worth. They became
'regular' folks and did not return east with the idea that
Arizona was composed of eight-tenths Indians, one-tenli
Mexicans and one-tenth bandits. It has remained tor a
California newspaper man, representing the Sacramento
Bee, to show the greatest amount of provincialism and
stupidity in recent years, especially where Arizona is
concerned in the equation.
Harry Richard Gimbal is the man's name. I'e is an
accredited member of the Bee"s staff and came to fie
border either to investigate conditions or as a member
- the Calif rnia Vatioral Guard. Upon his return an in
teresting 'story is handled by him and prcves his worth
for a place in the .Ananias Club.
Accusing the people of the State of Arizona with a de
posit on to 'gouge' the soldiers, Gimbal declares that the
country is largely Mexican and has no further object
Mi .n t iva" m ney rut of the poor, benighted guards
BW3 .' ha e been so unfortunate as to be sent to these
parts. He de:la-es thnt Tucscn is the only town in Ari
rona which is half way decent. He tells of manner in
vhich the troops were held up by people who had camp
sites for rent or water to sell, in short, he accused Ari
zona and Arizcnans of everything in the catagory of
wrong doing, and was especially bitter toward the border
town of Nogales. t
Sympathy should be extended a newspaper man who is
so blind as to judge any whole by a single part. Arizona
should not be judged by either Tucson or Nogales, though
it is safe to venture the assertion that there is little diff
erence between the two communities. .
Several years ago soldiers were a novelty in Southern
Arizona. During the last two years the border towns
have become accustomed to them and it is only the
stranger who remarks on the numbers of these khaki
clad men who are seen on the streets. Douglas has, long
ago, forgotten that soldiers are there. They are now
Douglasites and are treated as such. They are, more or
less, an integral part of the community. This is the same
in Nogales. In Tucson soldiers, or guardsmen, (and the
California newspaper man does not seem to differentiate
between them), were met with open arrms. Of course,
they liked it. Nogales, on the other hand, was on the bor
der. There was danger of raids and other troubles and
that town had little time to waste in entertaining the
guardsmen from the State of California.
Nogales business men are accused, by the writer, of
having one price fcr the local resident and another for
the guardsmen. He declared that the $!5 received by the
militiamen did not last very long. He inferred that it did
not last at all. All of which is, undoubtedly, true. It ii
easy to believe it when the guardsmen who have come
to this border are considered.
Arizona border points bavo, on the whole, been very
considerate cf the soldiers and the guardsmen. Some
like one camp better than another but. on the whole, they
appear lo be satisfied with the treatment accorded them
in this part of the United States.
Perhaps it Is un-necessary and foolish to criticise what
might be said In a California paper about Arizonans
'gouging' any one from California. California is a great
state, undoubtedly. It has some great people, undoubtedly.
It's a nice place to visit and It's a nice place to be from.
B it If Arizcnans ever succeed in imitating California!!
tu the matter of 'gouging visitors, then by the saute to
ken they are worthy cf being called "real smart. " It is
hard to conceive how It can be done.
The Parcel Post Failure.
The University of Wisconsin after an exhaustive in
vestigation of the parcel post system of distributing food,
has set It down as a failure.' Even without the testimony
of the university experts the public realizes that it has
not met expectations. It has satisfied neither producers
nor consumers. It has not established general easy, quick
and cheap communication between the producer and the
consumer.
Many explanations have been given for this failure. A
New York state publication called Table Talk holds that
it is chiefly due to the limitations of the farmer himself
that it is impracticable for him to sell his products to
consumers via parcel post route, because:
"To sell his hams and bacon and other meats, to say
nothing of his other farm products, the farmer must do
what every other individual in business must do build
up his trade and have his distributing machinery. He
must either advertise in local newspapers, or he must
write direct to friends and thus create a demand for his
wares.
"Thus 'drumming up trade' is a business in itself. It
I is the Job of the middleman or retailer a thankless task.
if we may judge from the many attacks made on the re
tailer or middleman in the last few years.
"Now. the average farmer knows the raising of stocks
fnd produce much better than he knows the retail busi
ness. He reads price-lists from the side of the seller,
not cf the buyer. To keep track of market fluctuations
while he peddled his meats through the mails woiift be
no small task."
All this is true enough. But must the parcel post
therefore be given up as hopeless? It has really niado
considerable progress in this country, considering its
short history. Is no more progress possible?
Granting that the farmer doesn't know the business end
of selling direct to the consumer, why can't he learn it?
And why can't he be helped by public authorities, who
are or ought to be deeply interested in cheapening food
distribution?
Several states have already undertaken such co-operation,
through their agricultural departments, issuing
bulletins on the state of the retail market and the de
mand for various products. These bulletins are printed
in the newspapers, and in some cases distributed free to
the farmers themselves by mail. One of the southern
states supplements this with a department maintained
in a group of newspapers, where producers and. censum
ers can state their wants.
There is much room for development along this line.
.And the federal department of agriculture could do much
more tsan it is dcing to promote the utilization of the
parcel post. So cculd the postoffice department.

!.ol ,irl3 aainot pacifists, as follows:
1 ays throughout life remember that the man who
will not defend his country will not defend his wife, his
child, his home. Do not marry such a man. No man who
is not a patriot i3 to be trusted with a woman's welfare."
Thus professional pacifism gets another body-blow. If
girls make up their minds not to marry pacifists, it's easy
encugh to foresee that pacifism will die a natural death.
There's nothing really new, however, about this phase
of the question. And the advice wasn't really needed. As
some philosopher has remarked, "Nature herself has
taken care of that" It's the natural thing for young
women to prefer men who are willing to fight, no matter
r.'iether the fighting is personal or patriotic for them
or for their country.
The girls may utter fine sentiments about peace; but
when the soldiers are marching off to war or returning
from the front, all their pretty pacifist philosophy goes
glimmering. It's snubs for the peaceful civilians and en
thusiastic devotion fcr the men in uniform. It's only
women who have lived and learned who preach or toler
ate pacifist doctrines, and even they are likely to be car
ried off their feet by instinctive admiration for fightiug
men.
Women are, and always have been, the chief sufferers
from war. And they are still the chief obstacles to the
triumph of pacifism.

Belligerent Bellhops.
The readiest army of defense, according to recent re
ports from the nation's metropolis, is the New York po
lice force. It is said to be organized and trained as a
regular army, some 10,000 strong, prepared at an hour's
notice to defend at least part of the country from Inva
sion. Now comes word of a valuable adjuuet. to this '"liiiest"
fighting force. The bellhops of the Hotel Biltmorc have
been mobilized and subjected to military training. They
are drilling, 300 strong, every day on the hotel roof, whicn
makes an excellent parade ground. And the movement
is spreading to the other hotels. It is expected by the
promoters of this movement that there will soon be thou
sands of bellboy!; learning the. marching evolutions an'I
the manual of arms in the various New York hostelrics.
Pretty soon, then, all Uncle Sam will have to do in
case of a foreign invasion will be to touch a button or
tOiout "Here, hoy!" and a million bellhops, more or less,
will hop to the trenches as promptly and cheerfully as if
they were ouswerlng a call for iecwatcr.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. March 8. Turkey
again has attempted without success
to secure the 'consent of the United
States to the abrogation of the ancient
"Capitulations" under which foreign
ers under Turkish rule enjoy extra
territorial rights and are exempt from
many peculiarities of Moslem law.
U. S. Insistant

partment's plan Pj transfer to Turkey
four of the American consuls with
drawn from Germany the Ottoman gov
ernment proposed that a new form or
exequatur be issued to them, omitting
the right to sit as judges under Ameri
can law in cases involving Americans
and American property. The United
States replied that it could not con
sent to such a change.
Berlin Meddles.
The negotiations, which have not
yet reached a conclusive stage on
Turkey's part explained why Germany
has been detaining the four consuls
who were ordered from German to
Turkish territory. The Berlin gov
ernment did not want to embarrass
her ally by sending the American of
ficials to Turkey while the point re
mained undecided.
Turkey's move renews an effort
made early in the war to cancel the
loug stauding extra territorial conces
sions to Christian foreigners.
Enmity Grows.
The development adds to the handi
cap under which the state depart
ment is working in its effort to con
tinue friendly relations w ith Tin key.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Mar. 8 Informa
tion has reached the government from
a semi-official source that through
perfection of a powerful wireless tel
egraph plant in Mexico City direct
communication between the capital
and Germany has been established.
Officials realize that to confirm this
news Is of great importance and an
investigation has been ordered. Thru
connection by Mexico City with the
land telegraphs leading to the United
States, Germany would be able to se
cure complete exemption from the
censorship now imposed by the Amer
ican government at the wireless sta
tions at Sayville and Tuckerton. and
by the British and French govern
ments in their control of the Atlantic
cables.
I Far reaching possibilities thus
would be opened for the violation of
American neutrality or even theTmen
acing of the national safety in the
critical situation existing. Sea raid
ers and submarines might be directed
and full information concerning the
departure of ships from American
ports furnished.
German agents in this country
might keep in close touch with Ber
lin, and in case of war even more se-
! rious results might follow.
From other semi-official sources in
formation has reached Washington
that secret meetings are being held
by Germans in Vera Cruz and in Mon
terey to determine upon uniform act
ion by Germans in Mexico in the
event of an outbreak of war between
the United States and Germany.

NEW YORK. Mar. 8. A relapse to
the listless condition of last month
was the most striking feature of to
day's market. Dealings fell away by
30 to 40 percent in comparison with
the operations of recent Oys and the
number of issues traded in suffered
correspondingly.
There was a concurrent diminution
in activity in ultra-speculative stocks
probably in consequence of the fail
ure to enlist public in that quarter.
Such changes as occurred in prices
of important stocks represented little
more than the cr.piires of tu trading
element.
The more substantial :idrfnces,
very few of which were fully retained
included The Texas Company, which
rose 5 a4to 234, with three each for

CHICAGO, Mar. 8. Eig clearances
at Baltimore and forecasts that the
government report on farm reserves
would prove bullish did a good deal
to bring about advances today in the
prices of wheat. Quotations closed
firm 1 to 1 net higher, with May
at l.SS to l.SS'i and July at 1.58
to 1.59. Corn finished 1 to IVi up and
oats gained V to In provisions
the outcome ranged from 12V4 decline
to a rise of 15 cents.
Despite bullish sentiment which ul
timately ruled the wheat market,
prices tended downward at the out
set. As the time approached for the is
suance of the government report on
larni reserves, the confidence of the
wheat bulls became more, and more
apparent. Gossip was current too
that foreigners were buying future
deliveries here, and it was said that
for the first time since the German
war zone decree was issued on Janu
ary 31, American ship owners were
coming into the ocean freight market
in fairly large numbers.
Corn showed independent strength.
The government report on fa nn re
serves was expected to be bullish and
turned out to be much more so than
had been anticipated. Oats were
firm in sympathy with corn. Besides,
there was persistent buying at Win
nipeg, presumably for the British gov
ernment. Advanced guesses on farm
reserves of oats proved to be consid
erably in excess of the government
total.
Provisions were irregular and muc'.i

STORAGE BATTERIES
For the benefit of those who have
not heard much about the EVER
READY storage battery, we wish to
say that this is the most wonderful
battery on the maiket. It is abso
lutely guaranteed against troubles
that destroy other batteries, such as
sulphation and buckled plates. The
EVER READY battery will not be
damaged by being run down often or
by standing idle for months, this in
other batteries will cause sulphation
and buckled plates. The plates in the
EVERYREADY are their own patent
and are so braced that they cannot
buckle and if anything happens on
the inside of the EVERREADY with
in the guarantee limit of a year and a
half, we will fix it free of charge.
This does not say that a year and a
half is the life of the battery as this
battery will last for several years
with ordinary care. If you want to

The Man from
Ray Says: (8) .
"SUCCESS IN BUSINESS, and especially in
MINING, is a good deal like riding a bicycle
you have to keep moving or you'll fall, and
you have to LOOK AHEAD to keep on the
smoothest course."
Frederick E. Young and the large force of men with which he is de
veloping ARIZONA RAY
are certainly "on the move" for sixteen hours a day" and the showing
they have made justifies us in predicting that if you will LOOK AHEAD ,
a little and buy ARIZONA RAY COPPER, it will have a whole lot to
do with making YOUR COURSE SMOOTH in the future.
What do you suppose is responsible for the fact that the Ray Consoli
dated is one of the greatest copper mines in the world? "They kept
moving." Why do you suppose Jackling and his associates have made
millions out of Ray Consolidated? THEY LOOKED AHEAD."
That is what YOU SHOULD DO LOOK AHEAD, and buy on this
special offer NOW.

Plan in 1000 share lots for Arizona Ray, REGULAR STOCK (NOT

There is no telling what the next 48 hours may bring forth on the prop

"HER NEW YORK"
VEHICLE AT THEATRE
Gladys Hulette Featured in
. Pathe Plav to be Shown at
the Royal Today.
Phoebe Cester. a little eountry girl,
whispers to her pet hen. 'You've laid
an -egg for a man from . New York.
Ain't y'ju proud?" and while taking
breakfast to Fhilip, the new boarder,
who had come from that far distant
magic plare with its noisy, throbbir.s
life, she gazes at him as one from
another land. This is the first of the
story of "Her New York." featuring
Gladys. Hulette, which appears at the
Royal theatre today. Returning to the
city with a new found love and
gained health. Philip bravely struggles
to .sell his p'jems to bring his "eg"
girl to her New York. In the mean
time. Phoebe's brown hen proves to be
a golden one and lrer egg money buys
a ticket to Philip and her Wonder
land. On the train. Laura, a flashily
dressed woman, meets Phoebe' and
tempting her with a nice new dress,
takes her to her house. There, Owen,
a former employer of Philip, is fas
cinated by her simplicity. Such gran
deur and strange "fizzy drinks over
whelm her, but Pi'ovidenee intervenes,
when the little brown hen hops into
the street with Phoebe scrambling
after. A big-hearted policeman, as a
guiding angel, finds and takes bewild
ered Phoebe to Philip, and acts as
"bridesmaid" at their wedding. 1
Their little' home, built on much
love and little food, is brightened by
the doption of Johnny, an abandoned
baby, that Philip finds on the dumb
waiter. J'jhnny brings luck and Philip
secures a good job through Owen and
in nicer Quarters their cup of happi
ness seems to be full, when. Owen, to
further his ends, contrives to get
Philip to gamble with borrowed
money. Phoebe, convinced by trick
ery that love and her New York are
unreal after all. But, the . yielding-,
grief-stricken country girl awakens
Owen's better self and with his help
the unhappy household is reunited.

To keep these poisons and toxins
well flushed from the stomach, liver,
kidneys and bowels, drink before
breakfast each day, a glass of hot
water with a teaspctonful of limestone
phosphate in it. This will cleanse,
purify and freshen the entire alimen

into the stomach.
Get a quarter pound of limestone
phosphate from your pharmacist. It
is inexpensive and alnrbst tasteless,
except a sourish twingo which is not
unpleasant. Drink phosphated hot
water every morning to rid your sys

also to prevent their formation.
To feel like young folks feel; like

As soap and hot water act on the skin,
cleansing, sweetening and purifying,
so limestone phosphate and hot water
before breakfast, act on the stomach,

it was directed against the tying up
indefinitely in foreign treasury bills
