WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. So far as

NEW YORK, Feb. C The Ameri

steamship St. Louis, detained here
since last Saturday because of the
international situation, would not sail
for Liverpool "before noon Thurs

asserted that they were still awaiting
word from the state department at
Washington.

caused by the sailing from Liverpool
on January 21 of ihc Kronland and
on February 3 of the New York, now
said to be the only American passen

While anxiety felt by American ship
owners pending a more definite turn
of affairs resulted in the Standard Oil

port, their owners apparently were
not worried.

FAINT HOPE OF
PEACE SHINES
But German Minister's Ex

U. S. Fails to Stop Plans
for War.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. Every
phase of the situation which at
any hour may bri" t the United
States to war with Germany was
discussed by President Wilson
and his advisors at today's cabi
net meeting. The faint hope that
Germany after all might modify
her new submarine campaign so
as to avoid making an active ene
my of America was touched upon,
as was the possible position of
other neutrals. But most of the
cabinet's attention was given to
reports by each member upon the
energetic efforts of his depart
ment to prepare for war if it is to
come.
Doubts Worth of Sign
In some quarters here the inter
view given by Foreign Minister Zim
merman in Berlin expressing friendly
feeling toward the I'nited States was
viewed as a favorable sign. Little
weight was attached to it by the cab
inet, however, for the foreign minis
ter's remarks that he hoped the Am

Germany's reasons for inaugurating
unrestricted warfare on the sea was
construed as meaning that no, change
of course was to be expected.
Eavestone no Issue

of the. British steamer Eavestone and
the killing of an American negro sea
man are not regarded as establishing

About Constipation.
Certain articles tof diet tend to
-check movements of the bowels. The
most common of these are cheese, tea
and boiled milk. On the other hand
raw fruits, especially apples and ban
anas, also fcraham bread and whole
wheat bread promote a movement of
the bowels. When the bowels are
badly constipated, however, the sure
way is to take fone or two of Cham

WHERE WE STAND.
Maybe the American people will be content to have our
entire European trade restricted to one ship a week.
Maybe they will be willing to have that lone ship fel
low a special course from its home port to England,
kindly prescribed by the German government.
Maybe they will take a peculiar pleasure in decorating
that ship with "three vertical stripes one meter wide,
each to be painted alternately white and red",' and "each
mast showing a large flag checkered white and red."
But from all indications, the nation doesn't take kindly
to the idea of letting Germany prescribe a new style for
our national colors, and letting her mine or torpedo our
ships and citizens if they venture as usual on their lawful
errands on the world's free highways.
Americcns have a stubborn and ineradicable belief that
the sea is as much theirs as anybody else's, and that Lhc-y
have as much right to navigate the so-called war zone
as they have to sail Lake rie or the Mississippi Hiver.
They fought one war to maintain that right, .and seem dis
posed to fight another if necessary.
To submit, to Germany's amazing prohibition of mari
time traffic would cut us off almcs: totally from com
mercial and passenger communication with Europe. ' It
would play havoc wiUi our domestic trade and our legiti
mate industries. It would annihilate a foreign traJi
amounting to several billions a year. It would "scrap"
international sea rules, so laboriously built up during
centuries, substituting for law and orderly procedure
the mere whim of a powerful and ruthless belligerent. It
would shame up forever in the eyes of all nations.
England has interfered illegally with our traffic to Ger
many and Austria, but England has in most respects fol
lowed international usage and has played the game hu
manely. When she has hindered our sending cargoes to
her enemy, she has destroyed neither goods nor life, but
has merely diverted the alleged contraband cargoes and
paid for them. Germany proposes to sink without warn
ing every ship, whether of belligerent or neutral flag, that
ventures without her express consent into a broad zone
covering nearly all accessible European ports, around
which she has drawn a paper U-boat blockade of a sort
that has no sanction whatever except Germany's ovr.
fist.
Anybody, abroad or at Jionie, who questions how the
American people feel on this matter, and how they will
act when the moment for action comes, doesn't know
America.
cause of a law well drawn and well administered. Great
care is taken in investigating applications for help, and
no pension is granted unless it is evident that otherwise
the children would have to be placed in public institu
tions. No allowance is permitted in excess of the amount
that would be required to support the children if they
were in an institutional home. Thus needy cases are
properly cared for, but there is no abuse or waste.
It is fouud that with an average pension per family of
$25.09 a month, which makes an average allowance of ?S
a month for each child, it costs $4 per child less than it
v.-ouid in an institution. Thus the system is justified
economically as well as morally.

TEACHING LINCOLN.
The suggestion that the life of Abraham Lincoln be
taught in the public schools is opposed by a Nebraska
newspaper on the ground that "if our boys are compelled
to study Lincoln they won't like him."
It isn't meant, apparently, to insinuate that Lincoln
himself is unlikable on close acquaintance. The idea is
that, inasmuch as children dislike nearly everything they
are forced to study, they would dislike Lincoln, too, if he
were added to the curriculum.
It might turn out that ay. But doesn't it all depend
on the manner of teaching? There seems to be no reason
in the nature of things, why boys and girls should usually
dislike an author they have studied in school. It's stupid
and mechanical instruction that does the harm. The
pupiU of a "live teacher", who breathes the breath of
life into the books she handles and, the subjects she
j teaches, doesn't have any such trouble. Her children
don't leave school loathing things or people because they
have studied them.
If Lincoln is taught in the usual dry-as-dust way if
.'ie's divided into "an earlier,' middle and later period"
and each period is elaborately dissected and dissected and
criticised, if his speeches and writings are analysed after
the usual manner of literary instruction in high schools,
if the pupils are required to pass drastic examinations on
all the facts and dates of Lincoln's career, if hp is held
np as a superhuman model of all the virtues, it's needless
to say they won't like him. ' But if he's set forth as a
flesh-and-blood human being, with all .'lis queer, homely
qualities along wilh his noble character and big brain,
then how can any American child help loving and emu
lating him?

"TO THE LAST GERMAN."
From Emperor William's birthday proclamation we
learn that "t.'ie unshakeable German people, tilled with the
consciousness of its strength and with the will to victory,
stands ready at the front and at home to defend its cause
to the last man."
Nobody has ever questioned the determination of the
Hol'c-nzollerns and the Prussian war ring to fight it out
to the last German rather than acknowledge their error
and crime and accept punishment for the vast wrong they
have Inflicted on the world and on their own nation. But
it would be interesting to know, at this juncture, just how
t'at "last German" feels about it. How long will it be
until we have some sort of birthday proclamation from
the crumbling German tr141cb.es nd the soirowXul Ger

WIDOWS' CHILDREN.
A review of the "mothers' pensions" situation shows
surprising progress in this new field of public helpful
ness. The reform is less than six years old. It was in
1911 that Missouri enacted the first widows" pension law.
Now 2S states have adopted fie system of pensioning
deserving widows bo that their children may be cared for
at home instead of Being sent to public institution.
The reform has, naturally enough, developed some de
fects in its operation. In Oregon and Illinois parti ulaily
it has been found that in many cases the petition:, wire

$25,000. A YEAR.
We have a scrt of feeling that John Jaob Astor isn't
setting his American peers a good example. In an era
v.lien nearly all of us are grappling grimly with the
economic wolf, alifts Cost of Living, young Astor blandly
confesses or his mother does it for him that his living
expenses in three years and a half have amountod to
?SG,035.
Really, isn't it going pretty strong when a three-year-old
baby can't get along on less than $25,000 a year?
To be sure, little John Jacob has obligations that he
can't very well dodge. He has to live on Fifth Avenue,
and his share of the taxes on that property are over
$11,000 a year. . One must keep an expensive household,
too, in little John Jacob's circle. It costs him about $11,
000 a year for his part of the house expenses and he
doesn't entertain much, either. He pays his doctor $2000
a year and his lawyer $10000 a year. You might not think
that a baby needs a lawyer, but that just shows how
little you know about aristocratic babies. He has a
troublesome income tax to pay. And he has to hae
clothes and toys. Those indispensable articles have cost
him about 5,000 in his short life.
Maybe John Jacob csn't help it. The pressure of en
vironment is hard for an outsider to appreciate. And
yet, we can't help suspecting that the young man is go
ing it a bit strong. And such habits grow.
If it costs him $23,000 a year when he's three, how can
he get along on less than a million a year when he grows
up? And by that time maybe Uncle Sam won't allow
anybody to have a million a ycat Income and inheri
tance taxes point that way. .
STUDENTS AFTER TRUE. EDUCATION.
Students at the University of Wisconsin have decided
to go after real education. They are tired of the con
Hcrvatism and sluggishness of university life and are de
termined to stir tilings up for their own future good. A
"Forum" has been organized, the aim of which is to pro
mote genuine education. ' The students say:
"The true purpose of education is to so spread enlight
enment as to bring happiness to the greatest number of
people and to enable each individual to live his own life
to the full extent of his capabilities." They feel that col
leges and universities in general turn out a "successful
business man. engineer, agriculturist or dilettante," but
not a truly educated man. "It is time e, as university
student.-, realize our responsibilities. We must enlarge
our humanity, so that wc may be of real use to society."
Through their torum t!uy plan to "supplement the
classroom." It. is "to fuse our conipartmental education,
and to combine learning and living."
This criticism Wisconsin students make of themselves
is only too applicable to students of most of our otiier
institutions of learning. The fault lies on both sides ct
the professor's desk. That these students realize tl.e
weakness and are ready to undertake the remedy them
selves, is a hopeful sign. In fact, there are many "hope
ful i.ins" in the educational Held today, that students of a
coming generation will seek and liad the true education
l.'icy need.

Mayor I. C. E. Adams last night of
ficially announced at the meeting of
the city council that he intended to
tender his resignation March 6 and
asked that the members of the coun
cil be ready at that time to name his
successor. Mr. Adams at first stated
! that he would resign at the next
meeting of the council, but at the sug
gestion of City Attorney L. B. Whit
ney, agreed to serve until the first
meeting in March.
"It is a 'hani-and-egg' proposition
with me," said the mayor. "I have
given my services to the "city for two
years and have come to the conclu
sion that my time is really worth
more to myself and my family than
It is to the city. I am going into bus
iness in Lowell and will not be able
to give the time to my present posi
tion. During my term in office, both
ith .you 'men and the last council. I
have found the city council of Bisbee
to be progressive and honest, and 1
do not believe there has been one do!
lar of the city's money spent by the
members of either body that can not
be absolutely accounted for. I sin
cerely hope that this honest and pro
gressive spirit will always be in evi
dence."
One of the mayor's last acts before
officially announcing his intention to
resign was to recommend that some
action be taken in order that salaries
be provided for the next mayor and
council. He declared that it was not
right that the mayor and council
should give so much time and effort
in the interests of the city without
any compensation.. Although it
would be impossible for the members
of the present council to receive any
salaries, all agreed with the mayor's
suggestion that steps be taken to
bring about, if possible, some action
that would result in future officials
being paid for their efforts. City At
torney Whitney was ordered to pre
pare an amendment to the revised
statutes of Arizona providing salaries
for mayors and councilmen in all cit
ies over a certain population. This
amendment will be introduced at
Phoenix as soon as drawn up and
approved.
The question of a pound for dogs
nd burros was brought up by City
Marshal Jinimie Allison, who declar
ed that stray burros were getting to
te a menace to the city. Allison de
clared the situation was getting des
perate and that one woman had
threatened to sue him for damages
unless he gathered all the loose bur
ros into his arms and threw them ov
er the edge of the Grand Canyon, or
otherwise disposed of them. The
question was thoroughly discussed
and then handed brick to Allison to
solve.
After having been revised several
times, the proposed new gas ordi
nance again came up for considera
tion. On examining the ordinance
closely several places were round
where slightly different wording would
improve it and it was decided in or
der that all local plumbers and con
tractors be thoroughly satisfied that
they would be treated fairly, that
these changes be made before the or
dinance was passed.

WANT 3 MILLIONS
FOR STATE EXPENSES
NEXT TV0 YEARS
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PHOKXIX. Feb. 6. Interest in the
legislative program today centered
about the general appropriation bill
the whole committee of the House.
The bill was at first read in its en
tirety. At present it carries appro
priations for the next two years
amounting to $::,ll'5,ti00 larger than j
any of its predecessors since the ad-
mission of Arizona to statehood but ;
that is accounted for by the fact that
it will provide for the total expendit
ures of the state for two years, where
as other general appropriation bills
have been supplemented by statutory
or continuing appropriations which
the appropriation committee has as
sumed would be repealed.
When the bill was taken up by sub
divisions, it became evident there
was going to be a hard fight against it
Many believe some of the appropria
tions should be increased while oth
ers are equally determined t'at the
total shall be reduced. This bill, is
expected to have the right of way ov
er other legislation.
Comparatively little other business
was transacted in either house.
The day before a bill to appropriate
$200,000 for the completion of the
capital building was killed in the
Senate but this morning another to
appropriate $50,000 for an annex to
house the supreme court and the
state library was brought into the
House. Another bill proposes the
erection of a monument in Apache
county, near Navajo Springs where
the first territorial government was
set up.
A bill was presented in the Senate
by Mr. Colter of Apache requiring
the recording of all livestock brands.
There are now many brands carried
in the records of cattle owners who
long since went out of business and
it is desired to remove them from the
books or permit other owners to
make use of them.
A bill was introduced by Mr. Wil
kinson requiring the publicity of fi
nancial . matters relating to all state
offices, commission and institutions.
A bill by Rutherford of Yavapai pro
hibits the campaigning lv officials
who are candidates for renoinin.-ition
or election, by the use of matter
printed or written on letterheads of
the office, and prohibits the sending
of such matter in official envelopes.

whole the first notice was taken of i
the opinion of the supreme court last
Saturday, holding the county classifi
cation law to be invalid. A House

DISABLING OF SHIPS
BY GERMANS THOUGHT
CONCERTED MOVEMENT
WASHINGTON. Feb. 6. A report
from Manila said that of the twenty
three damaged German vessels tied up
in the islands all but six had been ex
amined and none had been found that
could be put into condition without
a large expenditure Vt time am!
money.
So wide-spread and thorough h::s
been the concerted disabling of Ger
man ships in Ameriian ports thut
some officials think il could be ex
plained only by a blanket order from
Berlin. It is suggested that such in
structions might have gone forward
early in the war or might even have
been issued as a .standing order be
I'uc lhe war to roer Mich exigencies
as now have arisen. There has been
no indication, however, that the Amer
ican government has authentic Infor
mal ion on the subject.
As explained today the policy of
the government is to make no use of
these ships, even if war comes. H
w as said authoritatively th.it there had
been no decision even to take over
the ships in the event of war, much
less use them.
Tinier the present intention of the
;iverniileiit. therefore, the net result
of damage to the war-bound ships

Piston heads in two of the liner's
engine rooms had been cracked and

The "Hoosier Special Model No-1751 at a reduction of $5 from the
standard price while our allotment lasts a few left
Never have we seen the women of this district respond to a kitchen cabinet sale as they have to this one which
opened Monday. The reason is plain: Many, have intended to get the celebrated Hoosier. Nearly every woman
wants one. And this cut-price on "Hoosier Special" cabinets would Create a sensation even in normal times.
Buy NOW in the face of rising costs on goods of all descriptions it brings an unheard of bargain!
Choicest Materials Supreme Workmanship
The sliding table top 3D inches by 42 inches is pure uluminuin,
and this rare substance has doubled in cost. In fact, the Hoosier is
made of the finest materials throughout, and every bit has gone up
enormously since the war. Except for the makers' foresig.'it in buying
ahead, their tremendous output and our profit-sacrifice, this value would
be utterly impossible. Don't watt till some proud friend of yours
shows you this beautiful cabinet in her kitchen.
You will long to have this cabinet then. But the price will b
back to f5 more than now. The Hoosier Company has given us posi
tive instructions that the regular price must he resumed on our next
lot of "Hoosier Special:?." So if you have the least idea of ever get
ling a kitchen cabinet today is the time! Eut only a few remain. Come
early to be safe. One dollar, remember, is ail yoa need to deposit.
Pay the balance $1 a week.
i After the show go to the English
i Kitchen for a dish of New York oys-
tr-rs or steak, chops, salad, etc.

A Hint to the Aged.
If people past sixty years of ape
could be persuaded to go to bed as
soon as they take cold and remain in
bed for one or two days, they wtwlri
Irecoicr much more quickly, especially
if they tnke Chamberlain's Couch
Remedy. There would also be less
danger of the cold being followed by
:any of the more serious diseases.
