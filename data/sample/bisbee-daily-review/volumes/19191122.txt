Department Officials Await
Reply to Note Warning
Carranza Government
Jenkins Sends Note
Bands of Rebels
Surround Puebla
Federal Troops Did Not Make
Slightest Effort to Capture
Kidnapers, Jenkins
Says in Letter
WASHINGTON', Nov, 21. Slate de
partment officials still awaited to
night, a reply to the note warning
the Mexican government that any fur
ther molestation of Ww.. O. Jei'kins,
American consular agent at Puebla,
who has been arrested twice in con
nection with Lis lecent abduction by
bandits, would seriously affect rela
tions between the United States and
Mexico.
While the text of the American
government's communication has not
been made public, the summary pub
lished by the state department indi
cated that it was one of the sharpest
ever sent to the Carranza govern
ment. It said the United states waa
both' "surprised and incensed" to
learn of the re-imprisonment of Jen
kins and demanded his numerate re
lease. So far as was made known, no re
port regarding Jenkins reached the
department today from the embassy
at Mexico City, but officials believed
that it he had not "been released be
soon would be as a result of the state
department's demand.
Discussing the general Mexican sit
uation today, state department offi
cers revealed that before the world
war the army general staff estimated
that complete Intervention in Mexico
by the American government would
require 450,000 men, operating over a
period of three years. Present esti
mates were not made available, but
it is known that arrny ofSicials hold
that the force necessary at this time
would be much less, because of the
increased army equipment, such as
motorized transport, artillery and air
planes. During the day the department
made pubic a complete report from
Jenkins on his capture and his subse
quent treatment in a nospital at
Puebla after his friends had agreed
to pay $150,000 in gold for his ran
dom, pledging their lives that the in
stallments would be forthcoming. It
was under daie ct November 7, and
amplified tin account which Jenkins
wrote to 'Pi.ivsn'at've Davis of
Tennessee, and which
made public yesterday.
Mr. Davis :
Jenkins said that "a very import
ant matter" was that "althougu the
UU 1dULflDLIl
local government could hardly be re- j De obtained. The committee was
strained fro msending troops out im"lcomDOsed of three I. W. W. members
mediately to punish my captors when .
they learned of my capture, they
have not made the slightest effort to
do so since I returned twelve days
ago, although they have reen incited"
to do so, but excuse themselves by
paying they will do so."
'The rebels are only a few miles
distant," he wrote. "They have been
' there for months and years, 'l uvy
plant, cultivate and gather their cm,
entirely unmolested; the whole coun
tryside U tilled with them, and yet
the government apparently makes no
effort to drive them away and give
protection to this city. There arts In I
the immediate vicinity of this city not i
less than half a dozen Important j
bands of rebels, all of them well
known to the government, and no de
termined effort has ever been made
to fight them. This is the situation
as it is today near this city."

SENATOR LODGE DECLARES ONLY WAY
TO RATIFY PEACE TREATY IS TO PLACE
IT BEFORE PEOPLE AT NEXT ELECTION
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21. Compromise efforts lo ratify the peace
treaty were thrown into the background today by developments
strengthening the possibility that the whole controversy might be
transferred to the political arena for a decision by the people in limn.
Senator Ixdge, chairman of the foreign relations committee and
Republican leader of the senate, declared in a statement there was
"no room tor further compromise" and urged that the reservations
of the senate majority be carried into the campaign.
There was no further expression to determine whether a like
stand would be taken ultimately by President Wilson and tlie admin
istration senators, but it developed that the president's senate sup
porters had no definite assurances as yet that he would reopen the
subject for compromise by resubmitting the treaty when the new
session of congress begins December 1.
The declaration of Senator Lodge reversed the position he and
most other Republican senators had taken toward injection of the
treaty into politics and was accepted in congressional and official
circles as clothed with an aoded significance by Senator Ledge's
conference with Will II. Hays, the Republican national chairman,
just before the unsuccessful fight Wednesday for ratit'icat ion-witii
the majority reservations included.

ARGUMENTS ON
VOLSTEAD ACT
VALIDITY END
Brewers Fight tb Have War
. Time Prohibition Declared
Illegal, Now in Hands
Of Supreme Court
i
WASHINGTON, NoV. 21. The va
lidity of the war time prohibition
law and the Volstead act for it en
forcement was put squarely before
the supreme court today with the
closing of arguments attacking and
defending both measures. There was
i no intimation as to when an opinion
might be rendered, but owing to the
importance of the issue, early deter
mination was considered probable.
After rendering opinions Monday
the court will recess until December
8, so it is not likely the cases will
be decided before that time. Nation
al constitutional prohibition becomes
effective January 16, and if an opin
ion is ont rendered by that date, it
would make no difference what the
court decided, as tha country then
would have passed through the war
time prohibition period.
Arguments today were confined en
tirely to the appeal by Jacob Ruppert,
a. New York brewer, from dismissal
of proceedings brought to prevent
federal revenue officers from inter
fering with the manufacture of beer
containing more than one-half of one
per cent alcohol. Elihu Root, counsel
for Ruppert, charged prohibition ad
vocates in congress with taking ad
vantage of the "year of grace" al
lowed by the constitutional amend
ment and which he said came "very
near" being a contract' between the
congress and the states and with
having "heckled and harried" the
liquor interests while attempting to
shove forward national prohibition a
few months under the pretext of the
war emergencq. Mr., Root also de
plored the granting" of unlimited
power to the federal government.
In attacking the validity of the
war time prohibition act. William D.
Guthrie, appearing also for Ruppert,
asserted the "mere fact that some
American troops were still abroad
did not expand or increase the pow
ers of congrens" and that the act
was obsolete as demobilization had
been completed and the war ended.

Returning from a tour of inspection

vice president, A. 1'. Thompson, as

ly yesterday that the company would

also will be moved to Douglas, he
said. This move was made, according

While nothing definite has been
given out tegarding a general office

CARLISLE STILL CLEVERLY EVADES HIS
PURSUERS AND THE OFFICERS ADMIT THEY
HAVE NOT THE LEAST IDEA WHERE HE IS
CHEYENNE. Wyo., Nov. 21. William L. Carlisle, the train ban
dit for whom posses have been searching since Saturday, continued
to outwit his pursuers last night and today.
Armed men covered wide areas of wild country today, in and
around Medicine Bow and in the vicinity of Casper without success.
No one, apparently, has the least idea where the outlaw is.
Officials of the Union Pacific railroad announced today they had
spent $13,00(1 in the search, and in addition hundreds of men volun
teered service in the man hunt. In the meantime armed guards are
maintained on all passenger trains, for railroad men are confident
the bandit will make another robbery attempt, though possibly not
until he has spent the $250 he obtained in the robbery of Union Pa
cific train No. 19 near Medicine Bow Tuesday night.
Baseless rumors have appeared from many places, including
Denver and Pueblo, Colo., where the bandit is reported to have been
seen. Little credence is placed in those, and yet officials here admit
there is nothing more definite than these rumors concerning the
bandit's hiding place.
Governor Curry was asked today to offer a reward for the cap
ture of the bandit. He promised to do so if the prosecuting attorney
of thecounty in which the robbery occurred would ask it. The only
reward now offered is one of $200 from the state prison at Rawlins.

Proposal of Labor
Secretary Expected
To End Coal Strike
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21. Secretary
of Labor Wilson stepped to the front
again tonight in an effort to bring
miners and poerators together after
a proposal by each side had been
rejected and the slate wiped clean.
Mr. Wilson is said to have formal
ly presented a defiiite proposal for
settlement of wage disputes which
would send bituminous miners back
to work before the country was in
the throes of a coal famine, but its
nature was not disclosed. It was
generally believed he suggested a
wage increase of 31 per cent.
Both sides united in asking him
to " join the joint sub-scale commit
tees after the miners had definitely
rejected a 20 per cent wage advance
and the operators had finally re
fused to agree to a counter pro
posal from the workers for a 40
per cent increase, a seven hour day
and a six day week with half holi
day on Saturday.
When the conference adjourned
after a six hour session, Thomas L.
Brewster, chairman of the operators,
declared that their offer1 had been
withdrawn and that the slate was
now clean. .

BEER IN EAST
ST. LOUIS, Nov. 21. Beer of 2.75
per cent alcoholic content was de
clared non-intoxicating in a decision
filed in the United States district
court here today by Federal Judge
John C. Pollock, in granting a tem
porary injunction restraining United
States District Attorney Walter L.
Hensley and Collector of Internal
Revenue George Moore from interfer
ing with the manufacture or Sale of
this beer by St. Louis brewers.
The decision was mailed by Judge
Pollock from Kansas City, Kans., and
as he was not here to sign the order
making the injunction operative,
doubt arose as to when it legally be
came effective. Counsel for the com

which will be presented to the judge

By the Workers
PHOENIX. Nov. 21. Following ap
pointment by the local post of the
American Legion of a committee to
investigate radical activities in this
region, interest waa focussed tonight
on a statement published here today
In which James L. Gannon, secretary
of Metal Mine Workers' Industrial
union No. S00, said to e a branch of
the Industrial Workers of the World,
was quoted as declaring a state-wide
strike of copper miners would be call
ed in the spring, unless a six-hour
day were granted.
"We will get the six-hour day if we
have to take it," Gannon was quoted
as saying in an interview.
"If it is not grant?, we will refuse
to work three or four days each
month, which will cut down pur work
ing hours. The copper barons won't
stand for this trimmmg o their
purses and will capitulate to our de
mands. "The example of the coal strikers
will not be duplicated, because we
will win our strike, owing to the per
fect organization the t. W. W. has ef-
fected in thls'state. Sevenry per cent
of the copper miners in Arizona are
members of our organization and
more are steadily joining as a result
of the quiet, but successtul campaign
being made."
Governor Campbell was accused by
Gannon of "playing to the grand
stand" in a recent statement to a
New York paper, declaring his inten
tion of ridding Arizona of I. W. W.
He said such an attempt would result
in shutting down ever' copper mine
in the state.
Gannon said he deplored violence.
but asserted he had received Informa
tion from the I. W. W. at Centralis
Wash., that their hall had been raided
before shots were fired.
Gannon admitted that the 1. W. W.
were not organized in iarr. :iiwr.'
among the farm oanJs employ-" in
the Salt river valley, but declared,
the labor element is inpUlly awaken
ing and coming to full realization of
the necessity for real action like that
advocated by the I. W. W.
"Wage scales 'n lh: mines are
good," he said, "but a few conditions
should be remedied ir r.any ot them,
and it is only by assuming an ag
gressive attitude, constantly and re
peatedly asking, seeking and fighting
for more money and Improved condi
tions, that we can be of greatest ben
efit to our members,
Gannon recited several alleged in
cidents in connection with the I. W.
W. strike at Jerome last February
and smiled as he told how he as
sumed the role of martyr to the I.
W. W. cause in refusing to accept
liberty from jail on the promise to
return to work.
"I was fighting for a cardinal
principle," he said.

FROM CASA GRANDE VALLEY
CASA GRANDE, Nov. 21. There is
no room in the Casa Grande valley for

Russians, who arrived in two carloads
there Saturday night, prepared with
large wads of money to invest in cot

The merchants'and business men of
the town gathered hastily with the
real estate men and decided they did
not want the Russians, who during
the war ranged themselves In passive
non-combative hostility to the war, de
claring themselves conscientious ob

real estate men decided they did not

brought them in was told to pull out
with them. No land would be sold to
his clients. He protes?e ta: tne lo

Russians if they had come singly, but
this was denied.
When the controversy raged as to
how soon the Russians would leave,
members of the American Legion as
sembled and quietly herded the visi

to return to that dear Glendale. from
whence they came, that Casa Grande

CAMPBELL CHALLENGES
NEW MEXICO GOVERNOR
PHOENIX, Nov. 21 Governor
Campbell has issued a challenge to
Governor Lanenzolo of New Mexico
to see which of the states can raise its
quota to the Red Cross anti-tuberculosis
drive first. The campaign starts
December 1, continuing for ten days.
Aizona's quota is $75,000 and that of
New Mexico is $59,950.
In the challenge the governor says
that many of the people of the two
states came here strcken with the
white plague and that when they re
covered they did not wish to leave,
loving the community and making it
their homeni. "As a consequence,"
he writes, ' there exists ore than ordi
nary interest among the people of
both Arizona and New Mexico -re
Red Cross Christian seal ' campaign,
by which funds are to be raised for
anti-tuberculosis work in 1920."

that the Thatcher ward be divided

was the. size of the ward, it being

one bishop to proierly take care of.
There are about 1,200 people in

GEORGE FIGHTS
As has boon tlie history of the
squared circle for a hundivd years,
and as will he written in the sporting
columns as lon:r i.s tho fight game
exists, Youth will have iis way.
Pilled against experience, knowledge
of the same and courage, the fresh
ness and energy of the young man
will call for its own, and will not
be denied. This is the story of the
fight last night between Fred (Kid)
George, of San Francisco, and Wal
ter Caldwell, the speedy and hard
hitting middleweight of Albuquerque,
when the litter won the decision
after ten rounds of hard hut clean
and clever fighting. In the third
round Caldwell nearly finished the
go by swinging hard and straight to
Kid George's jaw, putting him down
for the count of eight. He had just
started to get up when the bell rang.
When the decision was made, Kid
George, one of the best known men
in the American ring, who, with the
exception of four years, .has been
fighting since 1908, announced that
he had fought his last fight, and
that he would devote his time here
after to promoting and managerial
duties.
" am 31 years of age," he said,
while scores of friends crowded
around him to shake his hand and
congratulate him on the showing he
had made. "I have fought the best
there are, and now it is time to quit.
I used all that I had tonight, but
was simply outfought. I feel that
it is time to bring my ring career
to an end, and I am glad that it
ended with this kind of a fight
against a youth of the stamina of
Caldwell.
"I do not propose, however, to
leave the fight game. I will remain
with it in other capacities than that
of fighter. The tribute which was
given to me tonight by my Bisbee
friends has made a deep impression
upon me."
Caldwell was in superb form, as
was Kid George. The former is long
and slim, .with broad shoulders .and
a deep chest. 'He has Ion? arms
and he swings with every ounce of
force in his young body. At the
same time he fights carefully, and
never wastes energy if he can avoid
it. George fought carefully, his ex
treme cleverness and knowledge of
the game saving him from much
punishment, oBth men fought very
cleanly, both willing" to give the
other an opportunity when a slip or
a tumble threw one or the other off
his balance.
The first round was even. Cald
well started with short leads, but
George showed his cleverness right
fro in the start. The round was even
and slow, with tlte fighters evidently
trying each other out. In the second
round. Kid George bothered Caldwell
with straight jabs to the face, that
caught the New Mexico boy as he
tamo- Into close quarters, but not
with sufficient force to cause any
damage. Caldwell opened up his
ewings in this round, but could not
land. This round was even, with the
crowd with George
The third ard decisive round op
ened with a rush. Poth men were
anxious to go, with Caldwell leading
for the jaw and stomach, and George
countering with ' straight lefts' and
rights to the face. Towards the end
of the round, Caldwell swung his left
and cleanly to Kid George's jaw,
dropping him on his back on the
canvas. Referee Mohan counted eight
when the bell rung, but George was
almost on his feet when the round
ended. This was Caldwell's round
by a 1V margin.
In the fourth round Caldwell start
ed things, again. He was quick in
his actions, and evidently on his toes
to finish things, but George had re
covered from the wallop of the pre
ceding round, and forced the New
Mexican lad to be careful. George
did the leading, but Caldwell coun
tered with good effect. Caldwell's
round.
Caldwell opened the fifth round
with a left and right to the jaw.
George was giving ground, when
Caldwell rushed him, when the old

Caldwell rushed George when the

Caldwell countered with straights to

away with lefts and rights to the jaw,
but George covered well and jabbed

In the ninth George began by forc

right to the jaw, but getting one in
return that evened matters. Geprge

round with a long swing to the jaw

Kid George took the last round by
a shade. Caldwell opened with a
left to the jaw' and a right to the

to force the fighting but George was
careful, using right and left jabs to

playing hard for the kidneys when
ever they clinched. Caldwell slipped

Bruno, who was outweighed by six

first, the initial punch being alni't

his opponent over the ring and tak

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"This was quite according to rule; for the incompetent servant,
by whomsoever employed, is always against his employer."
Charles Dickens.
DIVERSIFIED ARIZONA
MUCH has been said and written and sung of late years to dispel
the once popular national illusion that Arizona is a dry, arid
state a land of rattlesnakes and Gila monsters, of sagebrusn
and sand, of broiling sun and desert wastes, redeemed only
by the mineral wealth which it pours into the lap of the nation and
the world. But perhaps no more eloquent and unanswerable refuta
tion of this now vanishing slander on Arizona's versatile productivity
can be made than through a glimpse into the window of the Phelps
Dodge store in this city displaying the "Arizona products" exhibit
of the Home Economics Department of the Twentieth Century Club
of Bisbee.
The women of the Twentieth Century Club have arranged an
exhibit of the diversity of which any state in the union not exclud
ing that agricultural and horticultural paragon, California might
well feel proud. Everything in the window is Arizona grown or
Arizona made. And here are some of the products which "desert"
Arizona can boast, as displayed in that window.
Figs, apples, peaches, apricots, grape fruit, lemons, oranges,
pears pumpkins, squashes, all kinds of berries, cabbages, tomatoes,
wild honey, cactus candy, olives and olive oil, vinegar, cotton, corn,
graham flour, sweet potatoes, corn meal, canned milk, many other
vegetables and fruits, and a variety of products made from these
too numerous to mention.
These staples do not. come from any one section of Arizona, but
from all parts of Arizona. They are not "freaks" of desert agricul
ture, but products of the highest quality and flavor, of the largest
size, and produced in enormous quantities.
The day when California was pointed to as a land of overflowing
plenty, and Arizona as its antithesis, is past. Arizona, at its present
rate of agricultural development, will soon be pushing California for
honors. Under irrigation, the Yuma and" Salt River Valleys, for
instance, are already as fertile and diversified in production as any
famed "garden spot" which California can boast. And it must be
remembered that Arizona still has over 1,000,000 acres of unreclaimed
land which, under irrigation, can be made as productive as are now
the Yuma and Salt River sections. ,
t
IN NO MOOD FOR TRIFLING
c
AME one day this week a colony of Russians to the little town
of Casa Grande, Arizona. They were oozing moneyl at every
pore money which they were fired with eager disire to invest in
Casa Grande and its cotton-growing possibilities. But they were
pacifists and "conscientious objectors," who had refused to shoulder
arms in the great world war for the country which had given them
refuge from a land of oppression and was making them rich.
There is in Casa Grande a post of the American Legion; of the
men who, with America as their birthright, had gone out and done
Tor America what the Russians, enjoying America as a gift, had
refused to do. These men decided that Casa Grande wanted none
of the pacifists, with their tempting bait of gold. (Which, by the
way, they had amassed under the protection of the American insti
tutions for which they had refused to fight.)
The patriotic Casa Grande merchants agreed with the service
men. But the Russians hesitated about leaving the fertile Casa
Grande fields, with the prospects of making more gold. And the
Legion men promptly rounded them up, herded them to the depot,
put them aboard train, and bade them never to come back.
The American Legion, especially since the Centralia murders
by the I. W. W., is in no mood for trifling with aliens who shirk the
responsibilities of Americanism while enjoying its blessings, any
more than it is in a mood for trifling with the cowardly traitor within
the gate which perpetrated the Centralia murders.
NO MORE BERGERS
to
VICTOR I ERGER. thrown out of congress for his un-American
course during the war, is expected to seek "vindication" by
becoming a candidate in the special election at which his place
will be filled. The country will look to the voters of Milwaukee
S;vc him the answer such a challenge deserves.
If there is any vindication due anywhere, it is due 1o Milwaukee
and the country. If the misfortune of having Victor Bergers in the
country cannot be escaped, at least they can be kept from pitting in
congiess as representatives of the laws and institutions they have
no love for. .Mr. Berger, we trust, will excuse Americans who have
a prejudice in favor of their country if they regard him as an unde
sirable lawmaker for a democracy he does not believe in. If he thinks
he has a calling to be a legislator, they would recommend to him
that he go and legislate for some other country. There is no present
opening in America and none is anticipated. Berger us no Bergers,
now or hereafter, world without end. Amen!
.CALLING THE RED BLUFFERS
THERE has boon a lot of bluffing by the terrorists during the
past, year or two about what they were going to do with our
western democracies.
They were going to make us all Bolsheviki in France, in
England, in America. S'Death0
The first real show down as between the Reds and democracy
came in .Massachusetts two weeks ago, and the fellows who stood
for civil war and murder and torture in the United States were turned
down cold. Governor Coolu'.ge winning by a huge majority.
The general elections have just been held in France. What the
Lenine-Trotskyviiches were going to do with France was a plenty.
But. that was In-fore, the election, in which they were beaten by the
parties represent ing democracy by at least G to 1.
The rule of the whole people is not dead in this world.
It really doesn't mailer whether a military commission or an
international stuff succeeds the supreme council, just so it is some
sort of a body with a little authority.

THE OLD OFFI CE PASTE POT
How dear to my heart is my once old-time "sanctum,"
When fond recollections present it to view.
The contents, the oirt, that faced, backed, topped and flanked them,
And every grease spot that my 'prenticeship knew.
That lame swivel chair and the cuspidor nigh it;
The tools editorial scattered pell mell;
The big pile of copy, the shears that sprawled by it.
And e'en the rude paste pot which served me so well.
The old office paste pot, the litter bound paste pot.
The fly-covered pasie pot where bugs loved to dwell.
Kow fierce the effluvia (try to conceive it)
Arose to the tune of the brisk scissors snips.
No cool stein of lager could tempt me to. leave it.
Through summer night's steins were plain heaven to my lips.
And now, far removed from that bum situation,
A tear of regret will intrusively swell,
As fancy recalls my old copy-desk station.
And sighs for the paste pot which failed not in smell.
The eld office paste pot, the litter bound paste pot.
The fl-covered paste pot which smelled worse than ailing eggs.
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 21. Up betimes, and quickly to town, knowing that it is a day of
much work, and sorrowing that my fellow reporter had journey to Douglas,
there to cut grrss in the streets with his lawn mower and had drank not
wisely but too deep of the sleepy Douglas air which has placed Douglas and
Agua Piieta outside of the United States, and my work had been increased
gi er.Uy thereby. To the restaurant, where I did meet my good friend
Lcugfcery, who told no with great glee that he had danced with friend wire
last evening while I labored, and much to my disgust confided that he
enjoyed the dance better than the badger fight. Mcthinks that this is not
true cf the rest cf us pcor mortals who watched our fighting friend's mighty
puil ai the badger's neck en yesterday eve. To the office, where 1 ciid find
that my lepor'er was still indisposed, but knowing right well that he came
from San Diego and had all the necessary equipment of ye Californian real
estate man. would amuse me greatly by his alibis when he did appear.
Still thinking of ye effects of white mule, I did converse long and mightily
wiih ye Reverend Karshman over the prohibition question, and he told me
that ye ex-aimy officer, who would lecture here scon, would convince me
most surely, end I did promise to furnish the Reverend Doctor some horrible
examples from the Review staff of printers and reporters, and, though he
did not accept. I am sure they would be a mighty drawing card. To Lowell,
where Harry Seeley and Emil Marks did tell me much political gossip con
cerning my friend Supervisor Roberts and his necktie that he will wear as
a disguise in his governor's race, although methinks it will be a walk, and
a slow one at that. Eut ye American Legion dancing manager Haas did
interrupt cur discussion by basely suggesting that I furnish him with a
cigar, but when I told him that my wife had only allowed me my usual ten
cents he did buy me a cigar that he said was "Ye Private's Delight," and
after smoking thereon manfully and with much persistence I agreed with
Mr. Seeley that it was one of the Ranks. Back to Bisbee, where I did see
Kid George, and he labored mightily with ma as to why he would win the
tig fight, anil Manager French thereon did confide to George the cruel words
that he was old and going and Caldwell was young and coming, which re
minded me of my bald spot, and I thereon did pull down my cap hastily ere
it was discovered. To the office, where I labored strenuously, wishing tor
pay-day, and was cheered in my labors by a visit from Mrs. Flannigan, who
recounted for me tales of yesterdays wherein a former telegraph editor of
the Review drank long and deep of the good pink tea that the society ladies
did brew for him, and I thought sadly of my present telegraph editor's
drinking habits, which are also long and deep, but agreed with Mr. Goodrich
that, ye newspaper man at ye pink teas must be a funny sight and not to the
best traditions of the service. To bed, tired and sleepy and hoping that my

ON E1BT1
Displaying a profusion of Arizona
grown products amid which Bisbee
and its surrounding country appear
well to the fore as a production cen
ter, the window in the Phelps Dodge
Mercantile company store in which
is. arrayed the exhibit of the Home
Economics department of the Twen
tieth Century club, was the cyno
sure of hundreds of admiring eyes
yesterday.
The display, compactly and sym
metrically arranged to show each
article to the best advantage, and
with the various exhibits bearing
identifying labels of grower and dis
trict in which grown, is a revelation
as to the diversity of Arizona's ag
ricultural and horticultural possibili
ties. The exhibit was prepared under
, the supervision of Mrs. E. J. Flanni-
gan, who is jn charge of the Home
Economics department of the Twen
tieth Century club. The articles dis
played are all of a quality equal to
that of similar products grown in
other states of the union, especially
noted for them, and give visible guar
antee that there is no limit to the
career of Arizona as an agricultural
state under irrigation.
Following are some of the prod
ucts displayed, with sections of Ari
zona in which grown and name of
grower :
Preserved figs, grown and preserved
by Mrs. E. E. Ellinwood, Bisbee;
Spitzenberg apples, Fred Hyne, Chir
achu mountains; beans, Mrs. Orson
McRae; peaches, apricots and pears,
grown and canned by Mrs. E. Gus
tin, Bisbee;. pure Arizona honey,

and corn, Safford; pumpkins, apples

Reno Woman Runs
Again For Senate
WASHINGTON, Nov. 21 Anne
Martin of Reno, Nev., will again seek
to be the first woman elected to the !
United States senate on the Republi- j
can ticket. She ran as an indepen
dent last year for the unexpired

and was defeated by Senator C. B.
Henderson, Democrat.
, National Republican leaders are en-
Arizona Rose flour; jellies by Mrs.
W. B. Maynie of Bisbee; and a box
of citrus fruits from the Yuma coun
ty chamber of commerce.
The ladies of the Twentieth Cen
tury club wish especially to thank
the Yuma Chamber of Commerce
which,' through Mr. J. V. Longstreth
of the University Extension county
home economics department, sent its
exhibit of fruits in the Yuma sec
tion by special request.
The Arizona products display may
be seen again in the window of the
Phelps Dodge store today. It is well
worth inspection by all and will be
found a revelation as to what thej
state of Arizona can really produce-.
couraging her to seek the nomina
tion. .
Some of the things Anne Martin
says she will advocate if she is elect
ed to the senate are:
Popular election of the national rep
resentatives on the council and as
sembly of the League of Nations, and
representation for vouou in the as
sembly. Land legislation along the Lr-o of
the Kelly soldiers' land bnr that willl
enlarge individual opportunity on a
sound economic basis.
Administration by the government
of the natural resources, land, water
power, mines and forests, to lower
prices and open new opportunities to
the people.
Government care for prospective
mothers and infants.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NKV YORK, Nov. 21 Stocfc:s were
firm to strong at the outset of today's
trading and made genera eTt-'nsions
to their gains at mid-day, but fell
away rather sharply under pressure
in the active selling of the lasC hour.
Much of the early advance was
naturally ascribed to less srrsngent
monetary conditions, and another
Tally in foreign exchange. For the
first time this month, call loans -were
renewed at 8 per cent -snG plenty or
money was available Tarer at per
cent. '
Relaxation did not include time
funds, however, for which 7i per
cent was eagerly offered. Many loons
were reported to have been negotiated
on a neight per cent basis and com
mercial discounts also were firmer.
Sentiment among traders was more
hopeful, but this was neutralized by
the conservatism of commission
houses, where belated liquidation was
in progress. The coal strike situation
and related industrial conditions also
invited realizing for profits in recent
purchases.
United States Steel was among the
first of the accepted leaders to yield,
but the late recession began with
coppers, where declines of 2 to 4
points followed the publication of ad
Terse quarterly statements. Sales
amounted to 1,075,000 shares.
Angle-French 5s were the only
strong feature of the bond martcet.
the tendency otherwise, including
Liberty issues, being toward moderate
irregularity. Total sales, par value,
$17,f.00,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
BRADSTREET'S REPORT
NEW YORK, Nov. 21. Bradstreet's
tomorrow will say.: Distributive
trading continues at a swirt pace with
demand still apparently outstripping
supply, despite a number of ordinarily
disturbing elements. Indeed, the
ruling complaint might well Be Bum
med up in the word "scarcity," which
still seems to dominate all lines from
the mine or mill to the ultimate con
sumer. Hardening money rates, un
settled stock markets, advancing
prices for many staple commodities,
insufficient supplies of soft coal in
large areas of "the west, demoralized
exchange markets, high paid and in
efficient labor and retarded export
trade, all operative as they are, seem
to offer no important check to do
mestic buying. Statistics of bank op
erations show no let-up. indeed, they
are larger this week than ever be
fore, and failures have dropped to a
low point compared with records of
previous years.
