League for Amnesty for All
Political Prisoners
Scores a Fizzle'
NEW YORK, Dec. 25. The Christ
mas day celebration of the League for
Amnesty of Political Prisoners met
with disaster when the police, soldiers
and irate citizens broke itup. Several
hundred men and women, placarded
and '-single filed" for the start of
their walk up Fifth avenue, dwindled
to about fifty persons, divided into
two wandering bodies.
Church congregations emerged from
services at noon without finding the
league'B carollers, who were to sing
for them in manacles and in prison
garb. Police warnings of drastic ac
tion to be taken if attempts to violate
tne law were made, brought changes
in the league's Christmas program.
Placards carried by the "walkers"
were destroyed wholesale by the po
lice and volunteer assistants. A num
ber of arrests were made for dis
obedience of police orders, and con
stant Interruptions by police and ci
vilians resulted la disrupting the
"procession."

These vessels, which were . taken

price has been fixed for the ships, but
$250 a ton is suggested as a probable
valuation by high officials.
The six ex-German liners held by
the shipping board pending the final
determination of their status are not
included among the vessels which may
be offered for sale.
The decision of the board not to

"It is the opinion of the government,
and of the people I have the honor to
represent," he stated, "that the above
mentioned decision of the supreme
council is neither righteous nor rea
sonable; that it will not lead to recon
ciliation, peace liberty and happiness,
nor to the foundation and perpetua
tion of a strong and stable Poland;
but, on the contrary, will lead to con

creates the same conditions that led
to the downfall of the old Polish em
pire and will as inevitably cause the

Organizations Cheer Homes,
But Hungry Single Men
Are But Few
NEW YORK, Dec. 25. Christmas
dinners went begging on the Bowery
tonight. Roast turkey with all its
"trimmingB," candy and mince pi
failed to attract half as many hungry
men as were served in former years.
This was attributed to prosperity and
prohibition.
The famous Bowery mission served,
only 400 persons, where in former
years they have been called to provide
for at least 1,500. At Hadley's rescue
hall fewer than 300 appeared for din
ner. Many missions did not serve th
usual Christmas repast because of the
lack of applicants.
The usual Christmas noon hour din
ner at the McAuley Water street mis
sion was postponed because of the
lack of applicants. Not a man ap
peared at noon, although 400 pounds
of turkey and many good things had
been prepared. A few years ago it
was not unusual for the mission to
feed 1500 but tonight fewer-than 300
hungry men appeared.
Families Get Help
Outside the Bowery, Christmas
cheer was spread Into many humble
homes by organizations, institutions
and individuals.
1'ne Salvatio.i Army furnished
Christinas dinners to more than 2000
families. More than 500 merchant
sailors were entertained at a dinner
at the Institute of the American Sea
men's society. Several army trucks
bearing Christmas trees and thou
sands of presents, made tours of the
poorer sections.
Nearly 7000 children were made
happy with gifts, valued at $14,000,
and distributed at the annual Christ
mas tree celebration of the New York
lodge of Elks. Approximately ten
tons of Christmas supplies were dis
tributed by the Knights of Columbus
to wounded soldiers.

I sympathize with every word you
say in your letter, about Nicholas

Normally, I only care for a novel if
the ending is good, and quite agree
with you that if the hero has to die he
ought to die worthily and nobly, so
that our sorrow at the tragedy shall
be tempered with the joy and pride
one always feels when a man does his
duty welland bravely. There is quite
enough sorrow and shame and suffer

there is no need for meeting it un

right from Loughery and slipped to
the canvass but came up with a rush
and pummeling Loughrey's stomach

loose a 'round-the-circuit left and
stopped it on Loughery's mouth. The
Bearcat sidestepped, bit his lip and I
calmly announced; "Now I'll fight."

er asking Loughery if he wasn't get
ting tired. "Just beginning' to enjoy
it," he replied and despite his torn

and set. Palmer forced Loughery
against the ropes but was backed in
to his corner under a left and right

ery clinching to stop it. Loughery
broke the clinch and rained left
rights on Palmer's head and the
crowd stood up with yells for Lough
ery. As Palmer backed out of this
iHinishment he caught a straight left
on the jaw, clinched and in dodging
a threatening right again fell between
the ropes and on the ground. And
again he came back as willing as ev
er. But Loughery took the agressive
and forced Palmer to move in through
some long swings to a clinch. Palm
er still smiled a bit. but was tiring.
When the gong ended the fight lough
ery was handing out lefts and rights
barn door swings and short jabs.
One judge gave the fight to Palm-!
er, the other to Loughery and Referee
Al Williams declared the match a
draw. ; .
Johnny Meyer won a technical
knockout over Young Banta, of the
Czar shaft, when the latter's second
threw a towel in the ring in the fifth
round of their scheduled six round
fight. It was Tanta's second apear-
ance in the ring and despite his
weight, 153, seven pounds more than
that of Meyer, he 'was whipped from
the first gong. Meyer easily guarded
off Banta's attempts and though ap
parently working hard, showed his
ring experience and superiority in ev
ery minute of the fighting. In the
fourth round he ptaggered Banta with
a straight left. From then on to the
end Banta was grbgy and entirely de
fensive. Early in the fifth round he
went down for a count of eight and
to save Banta from a clean knockout
the towel was thrown in.
Battling Herrera was given a de
cision over Young Griffo in the first
round of their four round match,
when Griffo was hurled through the
ropes by a barndoor swing of Herre-
ra's. Griffo struck the ground on his
hands and sprained his ankle as he
hit the edge of the ring.
Red Milbarn, the fighting A. D. T.,J
showed signs of his training with the
Western Union when he outpointed
and thoroughly wh'pped Cyclone
Shea. Red had every round and re
ceived no more than two severe blows
but he gave plenty.
"Red" Gannor played the ringside
tune on the bell and Undersheriff
George Henshaw did the Billy Jor
dan stunt. ' " '
Despite the good weather, the clos
ing of the mines and the good card
there were no more than 600 people
at the fight. Promoter French said he
had expected more than 1000 fans at
the- fight.
After the fight Palmer declared he
believed he had earned a decision ov
er Loughery. Loughery said that it
was a good draw but that he had
Palmer going in the tenth and "I was
wishin gwe had five more rounds to
go for I know I had him slipping," he
says.

reached this country, are unusually good. They tell better than the cabled accounts the true story of the fight. No word story describes the kindly act
of Carpentier helping his defeated opponent to his corner as does the picture. The picture of the knockout blow, preceded by another of those light
ning left jabs, shows the force with which Carpentier is hitting.' The left led to the chin and the right followed. In the other picture Beckett is shown
hopelessly out prone on the floor of the ring wvth the victor standing back as fresh as a daisy. Ring fans who say Carpentier has no chance whatever
with Jack Dempsey might study closely two of these pictures and then reconsider. Carpentier looks every inch a real fighter and one who should be
counted in on the world's heavyweight championship.

Quality Goes GearTltrough
To drive a car, providing it's a reliable and reasonable
priced car such as the Dort, is plain COMMON
SENSE, and in accord with the spirit of the times.
To be without the time saving and health-preserving
benefits such as a car affords, lessens activity and lim
its usefulness.
Dort buyers who In the past years have paid much
more than the Dort price are enjoying full satisfaction
in Dort ownership.
Not alone because Dort up-keep and operating ex
pense is comparatively trivial, but because in looks,
power, strength, simplicity and stability the car meets
requirements.
You will like your Dort for its eagerness to do
things your way for Its power, flexibility, simplicity.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY

"Count that day lost whose low descending sun.
Views from thy hand no worthy action done."
Author Unknown.
THE DAY AFTER
CHRISTMAS is over, but it has left behind its usual rich heritage
of stimulated friendship, brotherly love and the Christian spirit,
the danger of reaction from Christmas joys.
This is the thought to hold steadfast today, on guard against
In this regard the quotation by an unknown, author at the head
of this column is particularly pertinent. Study the two lines of the
simple rhyme carefully. Yesterday we were all doing "worthy ac
tions,"" not singly, but by the score. We were all happier because
of the loving kindness of friends and relatives, and friends and
relatives were all happier because of us.
There is no need for that jaded "day after" feeling because
Christmas Day has gone. The day itself is gone, but not the spirit
of the day. Human hearts are richer today by all the noblest senti
ments of which the human heart is capable, both given and received.
Human charity and thought for others ruled supreme on Christmas
day, and there is no reason why we should let this rule of altruism
die because the day specially consecrated to it is over..
It is the mission of each and every one of us to keep alive this
Christmas spirit for 365 days out of the year, and not only to keep
it alive but to so foster and cherish it that it shall grow daily in
strength and in the spreading of its fruits broadcast.
"Peace on earth, good will to men" is the shibboleth of Christ-,
mas, but it is a shibboleth which applies equally to every day in the
week, and every week in the yeaf.
COMFORTING WORDS
THOSK are comforting words spoken by General Tasker H. Bliss.
American representative on the supreme war council, in which
he announces that there is plenty of food in Europe to feed all
its people, if its distribution is properly handled.
It is not pleasant here in these United States, in spite of the high
cost of living, labor unrest and other domestic troubles, practically
everyone has enough to eat and praper shelter and clothing, to hear
of starving thousands in various parts of Europe, who seem to in
sist on starving no matter how rapidly we pour out our American
dollars in subscripon funds for their aid.
To think of emaciated, hungry fellow human being across the
ocean, lacking the barest necessities of life through no fault of their
own, but simply because thesenecessities are not to be procured, is
calculated to throw a depressing effect" over any well-laden American
dinner board. But for the peoples of Europe to be suffering through
their own bad management is quite another matter, for it is a mat
ter which easily can be remedied.
General Bliss says that the food is there. The immediate and ef
fective remedy, as he suggests, is the pooling of resources and ex
change of raw materials among the European countries by which
all may be supplied and none go hungry.
What that hungry peopla of Europe need is not so much Amer
ican charity as a lesson in American thrift, economy and management.
THE LATEST ROCKEFELLER GIFT
WE may all think as we like of John D. Rockefeller hiniseir, but
- no matter how prejudiced some of us may be against the
instrument, all must admit that the effects of his huge gifts
to mankind are vast and far-reaching in benefits to the race.
John D. Rockefeller has just observed Christmas by making so
ciety a gift "of $100,000,000 bringing his total in public donations to
nearly half a billion dollars. Of this huge sum, one half is to be used
in increasing the salaries of college professors throughout the nation,
and one half in combating disease on a national, or rather world
wide scale through improvement of medical education, public health
administration, and scientific research.
The good which will result from such expenditure of 5100,000,000
is too obvious to require comment here. Better salaries for college
professors means better professors, with an incalculable impetus
thus given the making of intelligent citizens through higher educa
tion throughout the nation. And who shall say what discoveries in
medical science may result from Mr. Rockefeller's gift to contribute
to a sturdy, healthy and happy race of the future?
Principally to be noted is the fact that to achieve results, such
projects for the public good must be undertaken on a titanic scaled
Their undertaking is made possible only by the possession on the
part of Mr. Rockefeller of his vast fortune, combined with his will
ingness to turn it to the public good.
MILWAUKEE
THERE would have been surprise in the election returns from Mil
waukee if the country had not betu prepared for the news. The
return of Victor Bergcr to congress after the house of representa
tives had once refused him a seat on the grounds of hi3 un
American platform and utterances could not have been expected from
any other city in the country.
i But Milwaukee elected him in 1918 because he represents the
un-Americanism of the city, and his re election shows that MilwauKot,
Is, running true toiler record. That, evidently, is the logical ex
planation for what occurred at the special election. It means that
unless Milwaukee tan have au un-American representative like
Berger in the American congress, Milwaukee wants no representation
at all. Possibly Milwaukee will find some objections to that sort ot
an interpretation of her election returns, but it is the interpretation
the country will give it. Kansas City Str.
Now the booze chorus asserts that constitui ional prohibition

is considerable of a dwindle from the first confident claim that it

About the only reason we could ever find for the anti-breakfast
propaganda started ojtt by health reformers a few years ago was
that up to t lint time most people were eating breakfast regularly
and seemed contented. ,

Xoa may say what you like about President Carranza of Mexico, but at
least he's a sport. He has just signed a bill permitting bullfighting in
Mexico, and that popular sport is to be revived after an innocuous desuetude
of two years.
Still, while bullfighting may have been under tlie baa in the Soathern
Republic for two years, we have not noticed cny let up in the gentle art of
throwing the bull during that time.
o
And, it may' be remarked in passing, bull throwing is by no means con
fined to the other side of the border.
HIGH SCHOOL RECORD
VOL. 1. BISBEE, ARIZONA
No. 8
Miss Genevieve Stimson, who has
been teaching at the high school for
several years,- has resigned her posi
tion. She went to Long Beach, Calif.,
where she was married Christmas day
to David Williams, formerly an engi
neer for the Calumet and Arizona Min
ing company. They will make their
home in Long Beach. Mrs. Williams
takes with her the best wishes from
all her Spanish and history students,
the faculty and her many friends.
Ethel Werner, the newly elected
president of the girls' Hi-Y club, pre
sided over a meeting for her first time
last Monday at the regular weekly
club meeting. The club decided to
make up two big boxes of clothes and
good things to eat for some deserving
families and present them on Christmas.
Prank Galusha, a member of the
Junior class, has heard the call and
answered it. He joined the navy
through the local recruiting office.
Walter McRae, one of the members
of the December graduating class,
will be employed at the high school as
a carpenter. McRae is very handy
with tools and has turned out some
very' fine work. His latest piece of
work, a large cedar chest, was in the
building at the time of the fire but
was saved, a little, the worse for
smoke and water.
Eben D. Lane is again employed at
Owen's cleaning works. He gave up
his job at the approach of the football
season so as to enable him to try out
for the team. He made good and
receive! his letter.
Ed J. Lawrenson, athletic coach for
the high school, has been chosen by
the local post of the American Legion
to coach its team to victory. "Coach"
has turned out several championship
teams and his friends expect him to
whip the Legion material into a team
of championship caliber.
S. S. Safford, who is a member of
the commercial department of the
high school, is slowly recovering from
an operation recently performed at
the C. and A. hospital. The students
and faculty of the high school wish
him a speedy recovery.
Ungrammatical though this remark may seem, it may also be added
that with two national political conventions and a presidential election com
ing up, there will probably be more bull thrown on this side of the border
next year than there has been in these "United States since Mark Hanna
was a boy and P. T. Barnum was in his prime.

SCIENTIFIC NOTE.
Often we have heard of a tree's bark, but
In Nevada there is a kind of acrcia tree that gets angry, says the
American Forestry magazine It shuts its leaves (the tree, not the magazine)
when the sun sets and coils up its tvigs. If you will pull at this it moves
uneasily. If distuibed, as by transplating, its lerves stand out io all direc
tions and quiver violently. It takes an hour ur two for the tree to get over
the spell of anger demonstration.

"College education," says a man who thinks he knows all about it,
"never in this world made a young man anxious to inilk a cow in a muddy
lot."
Of course not! But it made him enxious to invent milking machines,
sanitary', non-muddy, milking barns and other up-to-date dairy equipment.
That's all a college education did for him.

STANDARDIZED DRESS
NEW YORK, Dec. 25. "I think the
Americanized standard of dress is on
the way," said Mrs. Carrie Chapman
Catt, president of the National Ameri
can Woman's Suffrage association,
upon her return from her recent tour
of the United States.
When asked what form suJi a
standardization would be apt to take
she outlined the following:
"All costumes will embody sense,
beauty and dignity. Dresses will have
short skirts, but not too short Sensi
ble heels in place of French heels will
be demanded by women in tne way of
shoes. The waist wHl be comfortably
evening, but they will not be extreme
'backless' affairs such as Paris has
decreed.
"Ahove all, American women will
demand a national dress which anni
hilates mincing 'hobble' steps. Skirt
freedom will be the main point of the
dress of the future."

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW,

Old Timers of Bisbee
V FRANK VAUGHN
(This is the fifth of a series of arti
cles dealing with the "old timers" who
built up Bisbee and the Warren Dis
trict. A sixth article, dealing with the
story of Arioch Wentworth, will ap
pear in tomorrow's issue. Ed.)
Of all the m.n who came into Ari
zona hen even the name of the terri
tory was In dispute, and who have
ueeu it develop from a land of cattle
ranges 'and cactus beda to one of the
richest and most progressive ot West
ern states, none, perhaps, has had the
varied and interesting life of Frank
Vaughn, who is now living in Tomb
stone canyon, who is as active as he
was 40 years ago. and who retains the
same spirit of adventure and love for
the wide spaces as he had when he
first trailed an Apache.
Unlike the greater part of the pio
neers of Bisbee, Vaughn came into
Arizona from California. In the early
'7's he was a member of the United
States navy, and had come around
the Horn when there was a threat of
trouble with Mexico over the revolu
tionary tactics of Porfirio Diaz. II4
" loft the navy in California arcr sev
eral exciting experiences in Mexico,
and invl877 arrived in Prescott, Ariz.
Prescott was then the capital of the
territory, and . the, affairs of' Arizona
were transacted in a long cabin.
Phoenix was hardly more than a col
lection of tents, while its population
wa made up chiefly of Marlcooa In
dians. In the spring of 1S4S Vaughn start
ed southwards with the building of!
the Southern Pacific railroad into
Tucson, already famous as one of the j
oldent towns in the United States.
The road was continued into Dfmiug,
X. M., and then the Santa Fe began
building from Benson to Guaynias,
Mexico. Vaughn threw in his 101 with
this road, and was master mechanic
at Benson,' and, later, at Charleston,
near Tombstone. His work as me
chanic was interrupted at intervals
by his labors as school teacher.
. 'In Chaileston and Tombstone he be-J
came immediately acquaiutea with all
the characters, mostly baa, wtio made
i that section of country one of the not-,
ed "hot towns" of the West. He knew
James Burnett, the famous wit, when
the latter was justice of the peace,
and he also numbered among his ac-
.quaintances such men as "Stuttering !
Jerry" Benton, who was credited with
killing thirteen men, two of whom he
laid low with a blow from his fist;
the Erp gang, including the brothers
Virgil, Wyatt, Jim and Morgan; "Doc"
Holliday, "Curly nili", and Frank
Leslie.
The Erp gang was perhaps the most
noted of the bad outfits of southern
Arizona. Cool, courageous and
quick-witted, they instituted a reign
of terror which all the rorces of law
and order seemed unable to stop.
This may have been due to the fact
that one of the brothers was always
in. public office, where he could ren
der efficient aid in the tight pinches.
Vaughn was In Tombstone when the
Erp gang killed Billy Clanton and
Frank and Tom McGlougbrey in Fre
mont street, over a dispute which had
arisen over the robbery of a stage.
Vaughn remembers how the hills
around Bisbee were well timbered,
especially with oak and cedar, which
studded all the slopes, and which was
used In carrying forward the mining
operations of the camp. He also has
definite recollections of the Apaches,
whom he holds in supreme contempt,
and who, he says, were not driven out
of the country sooner than they were
because of the difficulty of catching
them.
The Indians were very bad in what
is now Cochise county when Vaughn
came into the district. They would
come down to Cochise through Page
canyon, 25 miles north of Bensqn, and
would ran.ee through the Whetstone
mountains and through the Chirica
haus and Dragoons, also. Their num
bers were never formidable, according
to Vaughn, but their cautious method
of warfare and their habit of strik
ing at isolated ranch houses made
them feared and hated. Their-home
was In the White mountains, whence
came their names of the White Moun
tain Apaches.
They were a degraded, filthy and
most inhuman race, according to
Vaughn, and were distinguished by
their cruelty and barbarism. They de
fied the settlers for years only he
cause of the fact that they traveled
in smatl bands and were familiar with
every nook and cranny of the coun
try. Ot the well-known Apache chiefs of
the early days, Vaughn was well ac
quainted with the famous Esquimo
zeen, head of a tribe which made jla
headquarters at the San Pedro river
near Fort Grant. Instead of being a
fine, up-standing figure, with a mag
nificent headdress floating in the
wind, and of fiue physique and pres
ence, Vaughn describes him as a dirty,
drunken brute, who kept up a show
of friendship for the whites while ho
was more than once suspected of be
ing the medium through which ammu
nition and supplies were furnished to
Apaches on the warpath.
Mr. Vaughn was married in 18S9 at
Benson to Miss Harriet Exton, sister
of Vaughn's partner in the cattle
business there. Varied by many trips
out of the state, Mr. and Mrs. Vaughn
have lived continually, n Cochise
county, and principally in Bisbee,
where he still follows the profession
of contractor.

The Lost Shoes
When Nick and Nancy found they were caught in the
spider's web they didn't know what to do at first. You see
they had lost their magical green shoes that could make them
any size, so they couldn't wish themselves big again. And
they couldn't go to look for them because they could scarcely
move. Whenever they did they seemed to get tangled up
more than ever.
"Oh, we'll never get out of here to hunt for Jocko, our
poor lost monkey!" sighed Nancy.
"Cheer up," said the magical mushroom in her pocket.
"Just be brave and have patience. That gets most people out
of trouble.
And its advice just came in time, for if the children hadn't
ned pretty hard they might have felt really frightened. For
all at once they heard a spinning noise and turning around
they saw a great, big. spider, a green one, mind you, sitting
t a tidy spinning-wheel. And my, but it was spinning fast,
They saw a great big spider sitting at a tidy spinning wheel,
ith so many legs to turn the wheel and so many arms to
eld the thread. 1 '
But it soon stopped and came over.
"Good morning,"- it said very pleasantly. "I didn't know
I had visitors. That's very nice, I'm sure.. I'll just have you
stay for dinner." - ,
The twins wondered whose dinner the spider meant, its
dinner or theirs, but they tried to look interested.
"Thank you!" they said politely. " C
"If you'll excuse me I think I'll run over to the ant hole
and get a nice fresh ant," said the spider. "The rooster has
Seen there, but he's probably left some." -
"Will you please look for two pairs of green shoes?"
asked Nancy. "We lost stme."
"Certainly I" said the spider, obligingly. "I'm glad you
spoke of it." And away it went.
Nick and Nancy were sure they could get away now.
