Senate Is Predicted
Neither Side Is Absolutely
Certain of Strength, But
It Is Generally Conceded
That All Will Be Passed
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 Four more
reservations were approved by the
eenate foreign relations committee to
day as part of its new program for
Qualified acceptance of the peace
treaty.
Its action brought the number of
reservations approved by the commit
tee up to 14, and while it was said no
more, were to be considered for the
present ,it is considered likely that
there will be additions as senate con
siderations of the treaty proceeds.
The four accepted by the committee
majority today provide for decision by
congress as ' to who shall represent
this country in the league of nations,
and as to what other International
representatives shall be chosen under
the treaty; for validation of proceed
Inges relative to enemy property only
Insofar as qucb. proceedings do not
violate the laws of the United Si.af.os;
for renunciation by this government of
any part In ihe German colonics; and
for a blank h , provision , to crns?rye
the "national honor and vital Inter
ests" of this nation.
One of the subjects on which reser
vations still are to be drafted la the
equality of voting power In the league,
action being delayed until the senate
has acted on two pending committee
amendments dealing with voting
strength In the council and assembly.
One of these, by Senator Johnson, Re
publican of California, was debated in
the senate all of today and may be
brought to a roll call tomorrow. It
- generally Is conceded that both will
be defeated.
Not all of the reservations adopted
in committee today had the solid sup
port of the reservation forces, but the
Republican leaders declared a major
ity of the senate had been pledged to
them. Senator McCumber, Kepunit
can of North Dakota, who stood with
the other Republicans in favor of all
of the ten approved yesterday, voted
in the ne gative on the one relating to
congressional choice or American rep-.
resentativca In the league, ana Uiat j
concerning the German colonies, ben
ator Shields, Democrat of Tennessee,
. stood with the Republican majority
throughout
Meantime eidence developed that
the leaders on neither side had a hard
and fast grip on the attitude of their
respective forcea as to the commit
tee's reservation program. Some sen
ators standing with the reservatlon
Ists were understood to be dissatis
fied with the committee's proposal re
garding the Monroe doctrine, while on
the Democratic side the senators who
believe some reservations should be
accepted, brought Increasing pressure
to bear on Senator Hitchcock of Ne
braska, the administration leader.
The situation seemed to" forecast a
prolonged fight on the senate floor In
an effort to modify the program now
being formulated by the committee
majority.

ROUSE VOTE
Representative From Massa

' Tague, Democrat, Given
Seat; Fraud Is Charged
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23. Without
a record vote the house late today
unseated Representative John F.
Fitzgerald of Massachusetts, former
mayor of Boston, and seated former
Representative Peter F. Tague. Both
are Democrats.
Before seating Mr. Tague the
house refused by a vote of 167 to 46
to order a new election, a proposal
offered by Representative Luce, Re
publican of Massachusetts, and en
dorsed bv Mr. Fitzgerald. Previous
to this vote. Representative Over
street, Democrat of Georgia, had
withdrawn his motion to declare Mr.
Fitzgerald entitled to retain his
seat.
By its final action, the house ac
cepted the report ofs a majority of
its elections committee, 'headed by
Representative Goodall, Republican
of Maine, which threw out the vote
in three precincts of the Fifth ward
of Boston, with the result that Mr.
Tague was held to have received a
plurality of the votes in the election
last November.
In urging the adoption of this re
port, Mr. Goodall asserted that for
the house to sustain tbe committee
would have the effect of serving no
tice on political bosses that they
could not override congress by "ille
gal actions" at an election.
Martin Ney of Boston was named
by Mr. Goodall as the "political boss"
whose support gave the election to
Mr. Fitzgerald. Other representa
tives also attacked Mr. Ney, although,
in turn, he was defended by others
as a citizen and "constructive states

SEC. WILS

- FACTIONS IN
CONFERENCE
Dramatic Appeal by Cabinet
Member Averts Dissolution
of Strikers and Operators'
Committee in Washington
Settlement May Be
Reached By Friday
Miners Reject All Proposals
and Operators Non-committal;
Union Leader Refused
i to Withdraw. Strike Order
WASHINGTON, Oct 23. A dramatic
eppeal by Secretary of Labor Wilson,
himself a miner, prevented an open
break tonight between miners and op
erators, almost ready to go home after
failing to settle the strike of 500.000
soft coal miners, set for ten days
hence.
It was near the end of a long and
heated session at which the miners
formally rejected one plan of settle
ment and refused to arbitrate wages,
that the secretary, taking hold of a
slender thread, brought the two sides
together and kept them here for an
other conference tomorrow.
As members of the two groups,
weary after three days of arpvmect
and wrangling, left the meeting place,
they refused to hazard in opinion as
to whether the strike coald be avert
ed. In some quarters, however, there
was a more hopeful view than hereto
fore. Secretary Wilson, a bit hoarse
after long pleading with the factions
for consideration of the public's
rights, actually seemed cheerful. Much
of this feeling was due to the fact
that he had persuaded the warring fac
tions to make another attempt to re
store peace at the very moment they
were ready to quit.
"The miners rejected and the oper
ators neither rejected nor accepted
my first proposal for settlement of
their troubles," Secretary Wilson said
tonight. "They now have before them
for consideration a proposition sub
mitted by me that .they go Into con
ference with each other, without reser
vation, as if no demands had been
made or refused, having in mind the
interests of their respective groups.
"The miners are willing to do that;
and the operators are willing, pro
vided the strike order is withdrawn."
oJhn I j. Lewis, president of the
United Mine Workers of America,
leading from the conference room a
group of his men, said:
"The strike order stands."
Thomas L. Brewster, head of the
Coal Operators' association, leaving
the meeting with a party of his asso
ciates, stopped long enough to sav
"We are just where we started."
But out of the mass of conflicting
claims there seemed a better chance
tonight that Secretary Wilson might
be able to bring the miners and oper
ators together. .

Governor Campbell
Principal Speaker
At Southwestern
Cotton Congress
MESA. Ariz.. Oct.' 23. Governor
Campbell and Dwight B. Heard, pub
lisher of the Arizona Republican of
Phoenix, were among the principal
speakers at the opening session here
today of the' Southwestern Cotton
congress, which is being held in con
junction with the Arizona cotton car
nival. The carnival also opened to
day and both carnival and congress
will be concluded Saturday.
Governor Campbell stated the pres
ent cotton crop of Arieona is valued
at $25,000,000, a sum equal to the as
sessed valuation of the entire state
a few years ago. The governor ex
pressed faith that the cotton indus
try is permanent 'in Arizona and that
prices will never be less than two or
three times the price of cotton before
the world war. ;
Mr. Heard, who attended the world
cotton conference iat New 'Orleans
a few days ago, summarized the pro
ceedings there.
Mr. Heard compared the con
ference at New Orleans to a great
clearing house of ideas on the cotton
trade, referring to the splendid train
ing, clear minds" and broad vision
of the large delegations of spinners,
especially those from abroad, and
emphasized the great advantage
bound to accrue from the frank dis
cussions between spinners and growers.
KAISER NEVER
WORRIED OVER
U.5.DECIS
Testimony Introduced at In
vestigation in Berlin Shows
German Government With
held Facts , From Public
BERLIN, Oct. 23. (By The Asso
ciated Press.) President Wilson's j
peace offer was a matter little con
cern to the German empire, accord
ing to the evidence presented before
the sub-committee investigating the
war. Furthermore, the intervention of
the United States apparently was not
seriously considered by the emperor.
The incident caused a sensation and
recurred during the examination of
Count yon Bernstorff, former ambas
sador in Washington.
The Socialist deputy, Dr. Sinz-
heimer, turned toward von Bernstorff
and said:
The kaiser's telegram to which you
refer, dated January 16, 1917, and ad
dressed to Herr Zimmerman, (foreign
secretary,) says literally "his majesty
instruct sme to thank you for your
communication. His majesty does not
care a bit about' President Wilson's
offer. If a breach with America can
not be prevented, it cannot be helped.
Events are developing.'"
There was much excitement at the
hearing when the message was read.
Dr. Karl Helfferich, former vice chan
cellor, whispered "nonsense!" Dr.
Sinzheimer maintained that the peace
conditions sent to President Wilson
on January 28, 1917. which were said
to be the same as those eGrmany of
fered on December 13, 1916, were real
ly nothing like them.
Every one present appeared astound
ed at this statement and Count von
Bernstorff exclaimed excitedly: "Then
I am told this today for the first
time."
Under cross examination von Bern
storff quoted the erman emperor and
eneral Ludendorff on his (Bern-
storffs) return from Washington. The
emperor said von Bernstorff had fail
ed on two points, first, in allowing tne
British to confiscate the trunk with
a Swedish diplomat's papers, thought
to contain his Mexican telegrams, and
second, by permitting the United
States to send James W. Gerard to
Germany as ambassador.
Ludendorff accused him of attempt
ing to make peace by agitating against
the submarine warfare and declared
that the U-boat war would bring peace
in three months. He then told the
former ambassador that President
Wilson's peace proposal could not
pass the reichstag; It would be
championed only1 by the Socialists,
adding that a "rotten peace" was Im
possible. At today's sitting the question of
Poland's fate in connection with Pres
ident Wilson's peace efforts was dis
cussed. Count von eBrnstorff said that In
his discussion with the United States
government there was no question of
territory concerned in giving Poland

Advance Allowed by Gov

a Raise in General Tariff
Hines and Officials
Attend Conference
Pirector Promises to Place
Data Before Interstate Com
merce Commission Before
Property Is Given Back
WASHINGTON, Oct 23. Increases
in rail transportation rates to offset
the increase in operating expenses
during federal control will be sought
immediately from the Interstate Com
merce Commission by the railroad
corporations.
This decision was reached today at
a conference between Director Gen
eral Hines and representatives of the
Association of Railway Executives.
Mr. Hines made it clear that the gov
ernment has no intention of initiating
advances, but is willing to put all his
information and the services of the
government experts at the disposal of
the railroad corporations if it was de
sired to act Independently by the In
terstate Commerce Commission.
The offer was accepted. ,
There was no indication how much
of an advance the railroad men
thought necessary.
Indeed, it is considered likely that
nobody now knows how far apart nor
mal income and expensed are under
present rates. In announcing a grow
ing deficit month after month. Direc
tor eGneral Hines has made 1t clear
that while increased payrolls and the
higher prices of all materials and sup
plies had much to do with the failure
to make expenses, the abnormal fall
ing off in business also was a prom
inent factor. The last, two months
have seen business picking up to sch
an extent that the deficit is being cut
down.
The railrcad men, therefore, will
have to figure on many things, in ask
ing the commission to give them
higher rates. The amount most often
heard In discussing an increase has
been 25 per cent, perhaps due to the
fact that the last increase iitiated by
Director General McAdoo was of that
amount. Operating expenses have in
creased about 95 per cent and the
deficit Incurred by the government In
the first eight months of this year was
approximated $290,000,000. The sub
stantial gap between Income and ex
penses mav be widened still further
by the pending demands for more
monev. made by virtually all the rail
road unions.
Teh conference between Mr. Hines
and the executives w pa'd tr have
been occupied entirelv with discus
lion of methods of procedure.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 23. Out of
the national industrial conference,

of labor, employers and the public in
attendance, there remained tonight
only the delegates appointed by
President Wilson to act for the pub
lic. Meeting today after the with

message from President Wilson re

on the work for which the body was
called the establishment of a new
relationship between capital and la

president's wishes before the two
groups, declared the conference ad

which they pointed out three distinct
gains from th controvrsy ovr collet

The course which the public dele

major portion of the time being de

the public conferees were not In
agreement as to the president's in

whether they should merely make
recommendations as to the organi

The employers' group of the con

statement:
"The adjournment of the nrUicnal
industrial conference as originally
constituted brings .up sharply the
three definite gains:
"First, it has been demonstrated
that failure is inevitable where pre

J. C. RYAN IS LAID TO RES
"May his soul rest in peace."
While hundreds of his friends
crowded St. Patrick's church to the
doors yesterday afternoon the sim
ple but impressive liturgy of the
Catholic church for the dead was re
cited for James c. Ryan, highway
commissioner for Cochise county,
who died at the C. & A. hospital early
Wednesday morning.
Long before 4 o'clock, this time
which had been set for the perform
ance of the last rites over the dead
man, his friends and those of his
family had started to fill the church,
and when the funeral " procession,
headed by the members of the local
lodge cf E.Iks, reached the edifice,
there was left only the seats which
had been reRerved fof them, tne pall
bearers and the relatives.
As the gray casket, loaded with
flowers, was slowly wheeled to its
place in front of the high altar, tho
choir sang "Nearer. My God, to
Thee," while the officiating priest,
the Rev. Fr. Rouselle of Douglas,
took his place within the altar rail-
' Ing. Following the casket were Mrs.
Ryan, her three sons, and the parents
and brothers of her husband, the ap-
pearance of w horn .was the signal for
an impressive stir " among the con
gregation. After the relatives came ",the mem
bers of the Elksc lodge, who took
places near the front of the' church.
After Mrs. Ryan, who . was. very ap-J
pareutly suffering tinder a heavy
strain, and the other members of the
family had been seated, Fr. Rouselle
began the ritual for the dead. Around
the casket, and filling the space be

The banks, many of the merchants
and the employes of the Phelps Dodge
store have signified their intention to
(subscribe, and there is little doubt
that the campaign will be finished
Monday with Bisbeo subscribing her
full quota.
Because of the Interest which ha3
been evinced in the memorial Dy the
girls and young women of the Y. W.
C. A., Miss Greeley, girls' secretaiy,
has been placed on the district com
mittee to assist in the solocitation of
funds.
The majority of the subscriptions
are for small amounts, 800 subscribers
having assisted in, raising the total of
1950. The largest subscription is one
for $250, another is for 550, and there
are two or three for $25.
With the Roosevelt memorial cam
paign half over, membership fees, so
far as reported to state headquarters
from the counties, total more than
lialf of the quota allotted, indicating
that the full amount will be sub
scribed, at least. But according to
precedent in the collection of funds
by the campaign system, the. closing
days are always the largest m point
of collections, by reason that entnus

$25,000 quota and the 15,000 member
ship quota for Arizona will be
doubled. '
The state as a whole has entered
heartily into the spirit of the Roose

.Roosevelt's popularity in Arizona, and
$50,000 and 30,000 members is more
in keeping with the way things are
done in Arizona. The quotas are
based on the election registration,
which at best does not represent in

ARRANGEMENTS FOR PATROLLING
I RAGE ARE
IDE
Definite steps for the patrolling of intervals to warn pedestrians of the
the roads which will be traversed by
the racers on entering and leaving
Bisbee In the El Paso-Phoenix road
race on Noember 2, together with
plans for the placing of signs along
the highway, the parking and guard
ing of machines over night, the warn
ing of traffic and the taking care of
the drivers and mechanicians, were
begun last night when the BIsbee race
committee met at the rooms of the
Commercial club. Those taking part
in the deliberations were J. R. Hender
son, president of the "Warren District
Automobile club; J. J. Bowen. chair
man of the race committee; Sheriff
James McDonald; J. ' A. Kempton,
chief of police; Thomas A. Egan, sec
retary of the Warren District Com
mercial club; X' J. Ryan, deputy
Sheriff, and M. W. Powell.
The committee estimates that of the
42 cars which are to start in the race,
at least 30 will reach 'Bisbee. The
start will be made at El Paso at 6:30
o'clock on Sunday morning, November
2, and the first car Is due to arrive
In Bisbee about 2 o'clock In the aft
ernoon. As they arrive, they will be
checked In. after which they will be I
parked on. Main street from the north
end of the Phelps Dodge Mercantile
company's building, along the curb to
the end of Brewery Gulch.
Chief Kempton will have sli men.
In two squads, to guard the cars from
the time they enter Bisbee until they
leave the next morning at 6:30 o'clock.
His nolice force will also be Increased
to take care of traffic during the
hours when the machines will De com
Insr In and going out of town..
In the same manner. Sheriff Mc
Donald will Increase his force of depu
ties, so that all the road within the
county lines will be clea for the rac
ing cars. The main road from Douglas
to Bfsbee will be closed to Bisbee
bound traffic at 11 o'clock in the
morning, and all traffic will b forced
to come by wav of the valley road and
the Douhle Adobes. Traffic from Bis
l)e to Douelas will b shunted into
the vplley road at 10 o'clock. At
noon the main road will Tx closed to
traffic. At the sm time, deputy
sheriffs will be stationed at every In-terjiectlne-
read to keen vehicles out
of he path of the racers.
Th same procedure will be adopted
on the road out of Bish ovr (he

J. J. Bowen and J. J. Ryan, deputy
sheriffs, will go over the roads on
both sides of Bisbee on Sunday to fix
the locations of the deputy sheriffs,
and, in general, to have things pre
pared for the advent of the racers a
week hence. All these precautions
are to be taken with the idea of avoid
ing even the appearance of an acci
dent, and the general public Is asked
to co-operate with the officials to the
fullest extent in this regard
News of the racers from the mo
ment they start until they enter Bis
bee will be received from every town,
checking point and control along the
road from El Paso, from which it will
be either telegraphed or telephoned to
the Commercial club. Here a staff of
typists will copy the bulletins, which
will then be sent to various bulletin
boards In Bisbee, Lowell and Warren.
The committee alao took steps last
evening to reserve rooms for the
drivers and mechanicians for the
night of the race. They will be given
the freedom of the baths at the T.

Walter Krel Tells of Big Change
Brought About By Tanlac.
"I believe in giving everything Us
due and I want to say right now
that I Just can't praise Tanlac too
highly for what It has done for me,"
said Walter Krel while discussing
the medicine, recently. Mr. Krel has
charge of one of the departments at
Palms, Los Angeles, Cal. Mr. Krel's
remarkable experience with Tanlac
will be of interest throughout Cali
fornia. "Fo rmore than a year before I
tried Tanlac," he explained, "I had
an awful time with my stomach. I
could not eat anything without bloat
ing all up with gas and feeling mis
erable. I got so I could not eat
anything, scarcely, and as a result
I became very nervous and lost
weight and strength rapidly. I dop
ped down from one hundred and for
ty pounds to one hundred and twenty-six
pounds and was in such a
bad fix that I could hardly keep go
ting worse until I was almost corn
times and tried everything anyone
would tell me about, but kept get
ting worse until L was almost com
pletely down and out.
i "I kept reading bo much about
Tanlac that I finally concluded to
get a bottle and that was about my
luckiest day for I started to im
prove almost :it on:e. I have used
seven bottles now and the benefits
I have received cannot be measured
In dollars and cents. I can eat just
anythirtg I want and enjoy it and am
not the least bit nervous. I have
gained in weight steadily and am
now weighing one hundred and fifty-five
pounds. This gives me an
actual gain of twenty-nine pounds
In a little more than two months
and makes me ten pounds heavier
than I ever Tas. Giving an en
dorsement for a medicine is some
thing new for me, but I am certain
ly very glad to do so In this case,
for Tanlac is one medicine everyone
should know about Such a medi
cine deserves the highest praise and
it's a real pleasure for me to make
this statement."

IN MEMORIAM
I IT seldom happens in any community that the death of a man
will bring forth a general expression of sorrow, or that all the
citizens of such a community will unite in expressing their sense of
personaljloss when one of their number has heard the final summons.
This, however, has been the case in the death of Mr. James C. Ryan,
county highway commissioner, and the best tribute that can be given
him, the finest monument that can be erected to his memory, is the
universal sentiment of regard for him and sympathy for those near
and dear to him which has been expressed in the Warren" district and
throughout the county which he, had served so well.
After all has been said and done, the truest measure of a. man's
worth is the place which he holds in the hearts of those who know
him. When the love of one friend for him is multiplied by thou
sands when even those who might have opposed him. in public
affairs are the first to testify to his Integrity, his uprightness, and
the wholesomeness of his character it may be said of him that his
life has been worth, while, that his success has been real, and that
his memory has been laureled more fittingly t"han if he had done the
greatest of deeds but had lacked these primary virtues. Such is the
opinion of Cochise county concerning Mr. Ryan, and because of this
has come the general expression of sympathy to his wife, his children
and his relatives. .
So Cochise county mourns him, not because it has lost an engi
neer, not because he has left perhaps unfinished tasks, but because
it has lost the strength of character, the keenness of intellect, the
enthusiasm and abiding energy which made Mr. Ryan a leader in
this part of Arizona, and which would have distinguished him in any
other part. Through his untimely death not only has the Warren
district suffered, but in as great measure has the county been be
reaved, and the state which he loved and which he was proud to call
his own.

"The actual ownership of most public utilities is by the
people themselves. The first liens on most public utilities are
very often owned by trust companies, banks, and largely by insur
ance companies throughout the United States. Nearly every man
carries an insurance policy. The average citizen has a bank account,
yet not one citizen out of a hundred realizes that in one form or an
other his actual savings and insurance and his wire's and children's
welfare depend upon the solvency and continued operation of public
utilities. There is probably not one man in fifty whom we meet on
the street who does not own a. part of a public utility, whether he
knows it or not. So the question relating to public utilities are not
confinesd to the consumers otfce side and the public utilities as
such on the other, but the whole question is one involving financially
nine-tents of the entire population. Furthermore, public utilities
Ehould not only be solvent in themselves, but there should still re
main a reasonable incentive to reasonable .development along the
lines to be demanded by future generations. Nothing should take
place in this country to discourage individual and collective efforts
along progressive lines."
UNDERWRITING PROFITS SMALL
INSURANCE, like banking, has been an industry about which the
general public knew little.
Both industries, by combining the resources of the multi
tudes, make it possible to accommodate individual needs when
occasion arises in a manner which would be impossible in any other
way.
Insirance companies are really agents to collect money In small
amounts for fire and other insurance risks and then pay it out In
large amounts to those unfortunate enough to have property or other
losses, covered by insurance.
' ontrary to general opinion, insurance companies make little
profit on underwriting, the net profit for 1918 being only $1.89 on
the hundred. For the protection of policy holders, well managed
insurance companies maintain large reserves and surplusses, and it
is from these funds, wisely invested in bonds and loans on farm and
city property, that insurance companies must pay dividends.
A conflagration such as the Eaa Francisco, Chicago, Baltimore
or other big fire would wipe out any insurance company without
immense reserves, and the general public depending on insurance
for protection would be the heaviest loser.
DICTATION VS. ARBITRATION
We believe in arbitration between employers and employes. A
corporation may properly Bubmit to arbitration a demand for higher
wages or for shorter hours or for improved conditions of labor. It
could not arbitrate a demand from persons in no way connected with
it that it should require all its employes to join, even against their
will, an organizalion prescribed by those outsiders, and should con
stitute itself a coercing and collecting agency to compel their con
tinued submission to that body. Harvey's Weekly.

OLD PROSPECTOR FINDS
RICH DEPOSIT OF ORE
JEROME, Oct. 23. Ore assaying
$76.26 to the ton has been discovered
by W. H. Bruce within six miles ot
Tucson and he has staked ten claims
in the mountains. Mr. Bruce, who
is an old time prospector and claims
that metal lies where you find it, was
yesterday displaying his assayer's
report as evidence of the correctness
of his theory of metal in the Tucson
mountains.
According to Mr. Bruce the vein
is a large one and he is engaged in
exploring it. He has followed the
outcrop for a considerable distance
buth does not yet know its exact ex
tent. Silver predominates in the sam
ples assayed, with a total of $34.76
to the ton, lead flows at $16.50 and
gold at $3. This is considered rich
ore for the section and the old pros
pector isnow trying to interest acp

what he believed to be a rich bein
of gold bearing quartz and is also
seeking capital to exploit this discovery.

MESA TEACHERS KICK
AT LIVING CONDITIONS
MESA, Oct. 23. Teachers of the
Mesa schoois are not so much dis-,
satisfied with their wages as with '
living conditions in Mesa. Profiteer
ing landlords and landladies, higher,
rents than ever ;n the past, uncom-j
fortable and close quarters and simi-j
lar features are responsible in larg
est part for their unrest. ' This was 1
the statement this morning of one
of the teachers whose raise last week j
brought her salary up to about $130
per month.
Under conditions, she states, the
teachers of the district cannot live as '
they believe they should even on the
advanced wage. The woges, how
ever, are not entirely at fault. In one
instance which she cites, one teacher
occupying a single room in a house
which rents for $25 a month is pay
ing $25 for the room. Where two
teachers are occupying one room, of
which she has information, they are
charged $40 each month. In nearly .'
every instance, she states, the rents
have been raised 50 to 100 per cent
over last year, and few teachers have
been able to secure even second
class rooms at $20 a. month.

THE TOWN GOSSIP
By F. F. M.
Oh, what a happy life is his,
The man who sits apart.
And writes the funny head-lines
With a swift but dainty art.
Sometimes I think he does not read
The news he puts them over.
But simply sits and dreams away
Of daffodils and clover.
How pleasant should his labors be
Who never writes a story,
But blazons them to all the world
In heads of blazing glory.
Who scribbles busily all night
Without a pain or care.
And puts into his fiery work
The news that isn't there!
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
o .
Oct. 23. To town late, finding the weather chill when I arose and much
disposed to linger long in bed, but a few Judicious admonitions from my wife
aided by a threat or two concerning what might happen if I did not bestir
myself, brought me to my breakfast with tingling ears. To the meat mar
ket, where I was mightily impressed by the sides of goodly beef that hung
there .and much taken with the prices, which seemed fair. Also much taken
with the chickens, which haft been an old falling of mine. To Mr Ryan'B
funeral, where I did think that all the Warren district was present and in
all truth,-1 could not but believe that we have lost from among us one whom
we could ill arford to dispense- with.. Many flowers there, and a pleasing
service, which, after all, seems pitifully small to do in such a heavy sorrow
Thence to the Y. W. C. A., where I talked with Miss Greeley, of whom 1
have spoken before, and who is doing a fine, work for the young women ot
Bisbee. To Allison's also, where- thore was some news waiting for me. which
he gave to me in a very courteous and pleasing way. Also with Judge
English and Mr. Shaw, who have a i:pe but sometimes biting humor, which
amuses me much, especially to see how some try to dodge the shafts they let
fly. Many hunters going out to the hills; also many coming back, while the
quail and the ducks disport gaily in their accustomed haunts, seemingly
little bothered by our shotgun experts. Not much news on the streets, and
so not overly much work in the office, but enough to keep me busy. This
for the boss. To bed early, after eating some chili and beans, which I have
premonition will raise the Old Nick with me before breakfast.
THE IMMORTAL INTESTINE
By EDMUND VANCE COOKE.
(Dr. Varanoff ct'ima to have rejuvenated man by Inserting the intea
tlnal gland of an anthrapold ape. Hence this romance of the future.)
H. Wellington Welles felt a little bit seedy,
So he called to his office boy, Sammy the Speedy, ,
"My intestinal glands are in dubious shape;
Run down to the drug store and buy me an ape."
Away speeded Sammy, but soon he returned
With courage deflated and visage concerned; .
"There ain't any apes and we all got ter die,
Cause Wall Street has cornered the total supply."
Now, unless you have seen one denied and devoid
Of intestines derived from a young anthrapoid,
You can have no Idea of the scene which ensued
And the rage with which Wellington Welles was imbued.
He sent forth a summons to all of the M. D.'s, '
' Who would thus be. deprived of their anthrapoid fees; '
He summoned all people of various stations
Who had had, or expected to have, operations;
He summoned but no! having summoned this force.
There was no other class left to summon, of course.
The battle was brief. He was victor completely
And Wall Street succumbed and surrendered discreetly.
And possessed of a power beyond dreams and vagaries
H. Wellington Welles held the World's Ape-iaries.
But the paeans of victory died in his throat:
He hfKi captured the apes, but the apes had his goat.
For alack! and alas! (here the story grows teary)
Every ape on the place had performed hara-kiri!
Impelled by some spite no one yet understands.
They had wasted those precious interior glands,
And thus you and I lost our chance to invest in
That boon to our race An Immortal Intestine!
(Copyright, 1919, N. E. A.)

amount was cash in the Bank of

There comes to all of us a time
Vhen we must acquire confidence In
our ability to Co what m- t be done.
The teacher is indispensable to
tnu.t people, llut loo often ho la
regarded as something never to bo
Whoily deserted. In singins I think
there 1 a -hesitancy on the part of
most pupils to strike out for them
selves. They come to depend fo up
on the teacher as to be unable to
do much of consequence outside the
studio, where his discerning ear and
eye may be ever ready to suggest
I had been studying about three
months, I think, when my teacher
devoted a part of one of my lessons
to a lecture. It was a mine of sound
advice.
"You must rely on me, Rosa," he
eaid, "but not entirely You are
learning to think for yourself, and'
I am glad that you seem to be doing
that intelligently. It is well. For
without confidence In your own Judg
ment no teacher living can make an
artist of you.
"You continually ask questions,
which is Just what you should do.
It shows a desire to be convinced.
But you are now singing better than
you imagine. Let that give you
confidence but not over-confidence."
I protested that I hoped I was not
conceited.
"I didn't speak of conceit," he re
plied, "what I did mention was: 'over
confidence. You must guard against
that. Not enough confidence is bad,
but too much is sometimes worse, for
It may lead to disaster.
"This afternoon I have asked
some opera singers members of
the Metropolitan company to come
to hear you sing. I want you to for
get that you are a pupil. Feel your
self an artist; have confidence in
yourself, as you Justly may. But do
not take too seriously anything they
may say e-pecially In the way of
praise."
: Long aftr he explained why he
had cautioned me In this respect.
Ho had feared that if I believed the
things ho knew these artists would
sincerely say that I might be given
too much of the thing he was warn
ing me against: over-confidence.
Z was naturally excited to know I
was to sing before distinguished
opera stars. Nervous, f courses -but
I kept repeating over and over
to myself that I must be steady.
"The time af length came, after
the artists and I had been intro
duced. They were great personages
to me. as they still are, and I was
atremble lest I fail.
I was somewhat shaky when X
began the "O Patria Mia" aria from
Verdi's opera, "Alda." It is difficult
music. I felt I could not do It any
thing like. Justice. Yet I realized that
if I hadn't some merit my maestro
never would have asked these pro
fessionals to come and pass Judg
ment, as it wee.
I finished, and was astonished
when the visitors began to applaud,
Just as an audience does. I held
myself back, though, and made my
self realize that the applause no
doubt was more for politeness" sake.
Then I sang another aria, and then
Svo more. After that Carmella and
I sang two operatic duets. That
ended the audition, which In a way
it was. ' After ths visitors had de
parted my teacher complimented
me, though not excessively. He said,
a month later, that I deserved mora
than he gave.
"From now on," he warned, "you
must not think of what I tell you
too much. Don't misunderstand. .
You cannot well forget. But when
you are singing at home, and es-.
pecially for others. Just remember
that you are doing the singing in
the way you should, which will be
the right way, or nearly that.
"The teacher," he continued, "la
only the guide. In the studio - he
corrects the faults, approves that
which is done as it should be done. ,
But the artist is made only by de
veloping the independent side. X
want you to think independently
more than ever. Ask yourself if
what I suggest your doing Is right.
AVhen you are' certain then go on.
"The road lies ahead. It is filled
with obstacles, and some will give
you trouble. The time, however,
has come for you ,to stand artisti
cally on your own merits. Re-
member." i
From that time on I gained In
the respect he wished. He is still
my teacher, but I know he wants me
to be the artist as much of aa
artist, without him, as I can.

Pain and Frees the World of Much
Sickness, Misery and Distress
Nineteen years ago chemical Begy discovered Mustarine.
He made it with real, honest yellow mustard.
To which their pain relieving ingredients were added.
He said to the medical profession:
"Here is something twice as effective as your old fash
ioned, mussy, blistering mustard plaster."
"It's full of concentrated heat and heat eases pain."
"It won't blister it can't blister."
"And one box will do the work of 50 mustard plasters."
The doctors tried it were astonished almost amazed.
It stopped pains, aches and soreness quicker than anything
ihey had ever seen.
They prescribed it for sprains and strains, for lumbago
and gout. They found it invaluable to quickly reduce in
flamation and remove congestion.
They urged its use , in Tonsilitis, Bronchitis, Pleurisy,
Sore Throat and Chest Colds and found it wonderful.
They grew enthusiastic Mustarine was great.
They tried it for rheumatism to limber up stiff joints ad
muscles and it didn't disappoint.
If you haven't tried Begy's Mustarine get a small box
at your druggists today it costs but little, the results are
marvelous but be sure it's Be gy's the quickest pain killer

"My Advise to My Daughter"
Intimate Letters of Successful Actress, Kitty Gordon, Tell Daughter
That Work Not Money Means Happiness.
By KITTY GORDON.
(Introductory Note. 'Miss Kity
ty Gordon, famous actress and
film star, never thought thess
letters of advice to her daughter,
Vera Beresford would ever be
published. She wrote them out
....of the fulness of her successful.
life to her only child, who l now
coming into lovely young life.
They are intimate, personal,
worldly wise perhaps,, but
....jammed with advice that is 100
per cent worth while. Learning
that Miss Gordon had written
these letters of advice to her
daughter, the Review prevailed
upon Miss Gordon to permit their
publication, as they are not only
unusual, vital and exceedingly in
teresting, but contain much ad
vice that every parent and daugh
ter can read profitably. There
. will be six of the articles, the
first one today being the short in
troductory letter written by. Miss
Gordon to her daughter, telling
of the purpose she had in mind
In writing the series.) .
My Dear Daughter Vera:
You're getting to the age now,
Vera, where you are no longer a
child. You are getting to the age
where you must think and act for
yourself make your own way in life.
I will do what I can td help you make
a success of your life, of course, but
whether you are a success or not
will, in the final anal3'slB, depend
largely upon yourself.
Now, don't misunderstand me,
Vera; By success I don't necessarily
mean making an enormous lot of
money. By success I mean leading
a life you feel is well spent I mean
by this that when you come to Ifie
end of your life many, many years
from now. I hope, you can look back
over it and say to' yourself, "Well, I
certainly got a lot out of life. I'm
glad to have lived. I've been content
ed and happy."
Happiness, Vera, Is the biggest
thing we can get out of life. If I can
point out the way to you to get hap
piness out of your life I'll feel that
I have accomplished a great deal.
I'm! going to tell you, in a few" more
letters, my advice on the way to get
the most happiness, contentment and
satisfaction out of your life.
Your mother,

daughter will advise her to "Be Able

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 23. Not in many
months has the stock market recorded
t.nch violent fluctuations and extraor
dinary activity as attended today's un
settled session, the turnover running
far in excess of two million shares.
The tone was irregular to heavy at
the outset, but soon strengthened on
further spectacular movements in
Bteels and affiliated issues at extreme
gains of 2 to 15 points.
Meanwhile such recent favorites as
motors, oils, shippings and food shares
developed increasingly heavy tenden
cies, contributing largely to the
market's complete reversal at noon
All gains were effaced "while the
extensive selling movement was under
"way, reactions from best prices of the
first hour ranging from 8 to 15 points.
In a number of noteworthy instances
overnight losses of 3 to 10 points were
registered
Lacking more obvious reasons,
there was a disposition among traders
to attribute the market's feverish
course to the bolt of the labor delega
tion from the industrial conference,
and to related industrial develop
ments. On the surface, nothing In the
money situation accounted for the
market's vagaries. Call loans were
freely made at yesterday's minimum
of 5 per cent, after opening at 6 per
cent and some loans were made at
the unusually low rate of 4 per cent
before the close.
Feeble rallies occurred In the last
hour, the comparative strength of
rails and tobaccos inviting moderate
buying elsewhere. The recovery- fail
ed to hold, however, the market clos
ing with man yimportant stocks only
fractionally over the day's minimum
quotations. Sales amounted to 2,235.
(100 shares. To add to the day's con
fusion, foreign exchange weakened.
, Italian remittances made a new low
record, with concurrent declines In
rates to Scandinavian centers.
Bonds were Influenced by the
course of stocks, turning from early
strength to heaviness later. Liberty
Issues were irregular, with the foreign
division. Total sales (par value) ag
gregated $15,850,000,
Old United State bonds were un
changed on call.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct 23. Nervousness
and lower prices characterized the
corn market most of the time today,
hclefly owing to the complicated in
dustrial outlook. The close was un
steady, c net lower to lc higher,
with December $1.24 to $1.24 and
May $1.22 to $1.22. Oats finished
c to c down, and provisions vary
ing from 12c decline to a rise of 60c.
Although buying on the part of
strong commission houses rallied the
corn market from an initial break, the
announcement that the Industrial con
ference as first constituted had quit
and that the mine workers had re
fused Secretary Wilson's strike set
tlement proposal led to a renewal of
depression. Weakness of the stock
market was soon made another bear
ish factor. On the other hand,
knowledge that hog prices had recov
ered from a fresh setback of 25c to
40c had a tendency to disturb short
tellers of corn. Besides there was
continued evidence of determination
among farmers and Interior elevator
owners not to sacrifice holdings.
Oat averaged lower with corn. Be
sides the longshoremen's strike weak
ened somewhat seaboard demand.
Packers buying gave a general up
ward slant to provisions. The buying
nd was said to be based on expecta
tions that hog receipts would be cur
tailed owing to the recent big shrink
age in value.
STOCK YETTER
A bullish demonstration was staged
at the opening today, but same was
short lied and the general list as the
session went forward crumbled under
the general selling that assumed large
proportions. The news from the in
dustrial conference at Washington
late yesterday, and the various reports
in circulation today touching on the
labor situation brought forcibly to
mind the presence of important Issues
confronting the country that up to
yesterday were treated rather lightly
by many, especially by those who have
been carrying on bullish efforts In
most cases without regard to values

or the factors surrounding the gen

We are still of the opiinon that
further readjustment of the financial
situation is necessary before a re
sumption of bullish efforts.

honor of being third to finish the
trip across the, continent and return

ly Bitro-Phosphate Is
Good for Thin, Ner
vous People
A PHYSICIAN'S ADVICE.
Frederick S. Kolle, M. D., Editor of
New York Physicians' "Who's Who,"
says that weak, nervous people who
want increased weight, strength and
nerve fofce, should take a 5-grain
tablet of Bitro-Phosphate just before
or during each meal.
This particular phosphate Is the
discovery of a famous French scien
tist, and reports of remarkable re
sults from Its use have recently ap
peared in many medical journals.
If you do not feel well or are too
thin, go to any good druggist and get
enough Bitro-Phosphate for a two
weeks' supply it costs only fifty
cents a week.
Eat less; chew your food thorough
ly, and ir at the end of a few weeks
you do not feel stronger and better
than you have for months; if your
nerves are not steadier; if you do
not sleep better and have more vim,
endurance and vitality, your money
will be returned, and -the Bitro-Phosphate
will cost you nothing. Adv.

He continued to fight, although Al
