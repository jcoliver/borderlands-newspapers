UNDATED WAR LEAD BY THE
ASSOCIATED P R E S S. Conditions
along the Vesle between Suir.scns andl
Rhe.nis are unchanged. Thora r.ave
been no developments of importance
on the line running from the region
of Montdidier toward the English
channel. In both regions there is a
tenseness which seojiis to forecast bi;
events.
Heavy rainfall doubtless Is having
more to do with the holding in leash
of Marshal Foch's troops Uian the op
position the Germans are throwing iu
their way.
The Gnnans have been shelling the
Americans and French on the north
bank of the Vesle or delivering heavy
counter attacks against them, but
everywhere they have met with a
stern resistance. TJiey also have de
luced the southern line of the stream
with shells of all calibres. Including
pas projectiles, and even have broueht
their famous flame throwers into play,
but all to no purpose. The allies
everywhere have remained firm.
Where the Germans have thrown
shells in the Fismes sector, American
missiles have been returned with add
ed interest. This particular sector has
been a veritable inferno. Gas in large
quantities was released against the
Americans who were virtually un
harmed by the fumes. A kindly switch '
in the wind at one time even turned
back the gas against the enemy. The
French also have answered the Ger
mans in kind.
During the hiatus in the fighting on
the Scissong-Rheims sector the Ger
mans are believed to be moving their
main bodies northward to the posi
tions chosen for a stand.
An inkling of what fhe Germans
have lost in men made prisoner and
guns captured by the allies has be
come -public through an utterance of
the French premier at a session of
the ministry council at which General
Foch was made a marshal of France!
"Thirty-five thousand prisoners and
700 cannon have been captured." said
the premier, who added that Paris no
longer was In danger, that Soissons
and Chateau Thierry had been re
conquered and that 200 villages had
been delivered through the formidable
thrust of Foch's men through the Sois-sons-Rheims
salient.
Much interest attaches to the man
euvers of the Germans and the French
and Pritish troops with the latter of
whom seme Americans are believed to
be brigaded on the front running from
Montdidier to the region around Ypres.
Ultimately the operations here may
have a strong bearing on those now
in progress in the south and, if the
allies keep up their successful thrusts
and. the Germans continue to with
draw, compel a realignment of the en
tire battle front.
The French north of Montdidier
have crossed to th'e west side of the
Avre river between Braches and Mor

Louis J. Malvy, minister of the in
terior in the Viviani, Flriand and Ki

the most astute political figures in
France.
His position was first assailed in
July, 1917. M. Clemenceau, now pre
mier, charged that M. Malvy was
spreading "defeatist" propaganda
among the troops. M. Malvy resigned
as minister of the interior early in
August.
M. Clemenceau's charges against M.
Malvy followed the arrest of Miguel
Almeryda. editor, and M. Duval, di
rector of the newspaper Bonnet Rouge,
upon the latter of whom was found a
check for a large sui of money, the
source of which he admitted to be a
German banker named Mane o Manne
heim. Almereyda later was found dead
in his cell, apparently a suicide.
M. Malvy was much criticised for
having had confidence in such per
sons and for having granted pass ports
to Duval for numerous trips to Switz
erland, while the llonnet Rouge was
printing articles in -defense of Ger
many. It was estimated that Duval
had brought sums aggregating 500.000
francs from Switzerland, of which
20.000 frances went . to Almereyda.
Duval was recently found guilty of
treason and shot.
M. Malvy introduced in the cham
ber of deputies a bill demanding that
he be tried before the" high court and
the chamber appointed a committee of

case. This commi'tee submitted its

French peasants, who have be.-n iv-

southwest of Fismes, were rescued bv
the Americans after having pass?d
through two battles and remaining
prisoners to the Germans for five
weeks. The peasants werf nearly
starved, their scant supplies of food
I havine been almost exhausted before
the last battle of the vesie began.
The cave formerly was a nnarry.
When the Germans arrived in the
neishberhood in the latter part of May
the1 peasants round about Ville-Savove
usse'tibled in the cave rather firm
'leave. The entrance was at the foot
of a hill, great layers of rock and eartli
acting as a covering.
Many shells had struck close to th-s
roof, several exploding oirect'y over
the place. The peasants took all the
supplies from their farms, but finally
werP compelled to anpeil to the Ger-
mans for additional fool. They were
given an allowance so scanty that they
were compelled to forace for susfance.
The refugees mainly were elderly men
and women with a few children.
When the Americans arrived many
knelt in prayer at their deliverance.

GLOI3E, Ariz.. Aug. 6. Delegates to
the seventh annual convention of the
Arizona state federation of labor held
at Miami this week are preparing for
a clash between the factions seeking
to control the meeting.
The first clash resulted today from
an attempt to unseat President Croaff
on the ground that he was holding an
executive office in the state federa
tion and a federal appointment which
is contrary to the by-laws of the A. S.
F. of L. The convention voted to sus
tain the chair 27 to 26.
John L. Donnelly introduced a
strong resolution which was passed
by the convention. The resolution
pledged the support of organized lalior
in Arizona to the war aims of Pres

better feeling between capital and
labor In this state. The resolution
asks labor in Arizona to abide by the
principles of contract and agreement,
and devote their efforts to crushing
military autocracy.
The delegates are preparing for a
longthy debate when the workmen's
compensation law conies up for dis
cussion. The convention is pretty
evenly divided on the question and
some interesting debate is in store
for tomorrow. President Croaff in liis

handsome fown of silver la.ee and
tulle over cloth of silver, a veil caught
in dainty fashion with sprays of orange
blossom, and carried" a bouquet of ex
quisite white orchids.
. Miss Saliie Grant, maid of honor,
was gowned in a Ho Peep shepherd
gown of blue taffeta, and little Mar
jorie Osborn, the bride's niece, daugh
ter of Sidney P. Osborn, secretary of
state 'or Arizona, made a piquant

will make their future home.
FINE PEACHES FROM .
JOE COLFORD ORCHARD
Joe Colford brought in to The Re
view office yesterday a basket oi
poaches from his orchard in Wood
canyon just above liisbee that are the
finest yet displayed in this dis'.rict,
whether from Arizona, New Mexico
or from tho famous orchards of the
Pacific coast. Every peach in tne bas
ket was of unusual size and colored
to that wonderful shade of red that
marks the perfect bloom of a perfect
peach.
And yet every day or so one meets a
man wha declares that fruit docs not
do extra well in this country. Maybe
not, but these pessimists ought to see
Joe Col lord 's peaches.

A Substitute
For Sulphuric Acid
In view of the high price of sulphuric
acid, and the great difficulty in obtaining
deliveries on account of the Government
demand, many former consumers of
sulphuric acid are using Hercules Nitre
Cake as a cheap and efficient substitute.
HERCULES
NITIE CAKE
contains between 29 and
32 free available sulphuric
acid. As used in flotation,
leaching, and chloridizing roast
plants, and also for many other
purposes, when dissolved in
hot water to saturation, it gives
just as (rood results as free sul
phuric acid. It is being em
ployed with great success by
many large concerns.
Hercules Nitre Cake can be
bandied much more easily than
can sulphuric acid. It is a
Tie price cf Hercules Nitre Cake is $3. CO a ton f.o.b.
Hercules, California, or Bacchus, Utah. Jt tins price
a ton of 66 O. V. as Nitre Cake u ill cost $S. 75.
Compare this with the price you are now paying for
66 acid. For full particulars regarding this product

Let's Win the War
In Nineteen-JSineteen
And now General Crowder has asked for
registration of the new draft by September
5th. That day is just a month distant.
Much must be done before the machinery
of the draft can make these new men avail
able. A precious month or more was lost
when the war department blocked draft leg
islation proposed before congressional re
cess. But now the new draft bill has been
introduced in congress and the nation will
insist upen prompt action upon this bill.
Ctass one men of the first draft will be used
up this month and weekly registrations will
be rcquiied cf the boys ccming of jge to
fill the September quota for overseas duty.
This column cannot see any good reason
why class two of the first draft should not
be called upon for at least a pc,rt of a
monthly quota. But that is not the point.
If the war department officials wish to
call only class one men from any draft,
well and good, they ought to know best.
And now we must hurry and worry to get
the new draft bill passed and in working
order to supply men. If it had been passed
before congress adjourned we could have
saved this strain. It provides 13,000,000
men from 18 to 21 and from 32 to 45. It
is a good measure and should have been
enacted months ago. Why should the boys
of the land carry all the burden of war.
The older men are entitled .to their chance.
Of the older men 3,00(5,000 of class one
will be available at once from this second
draft. Thousands of these dodged behind
petticoats after war was declared and thous
ands more are simply waiting for the call,
not caring to give up work and home and
business until actually demanded by their
country. Now that the grim deadliness of
the war is coming home to us and the
enormity of the task looms ahead, it is ex
pected that there will be fewer seeking ex
emption than before.
This delay in enacting the new draft law
only makes the plainer that fatal and allur
ing error of so many public men of the
allied nations in underestimating the size
of the job ahead. We'have 2,000,000 men
now; we need 2,000,000 more by spring,
and we will need 2,000,000 more before
the campaign of 1919 is at an end. The
more men we can arm and send abroad
in the next twelve months the more quickly
we can bring the war to an end. We ought
'to prepare NOW for this job. If 4,000,000
men' can drive the German back to the
Rhine next year, then 6,000,000 ought to
be able to cross that famous stream. The
simple, practical and cheaper way to win
is to win as quickly as possible. Foch's
smash with a quarter of a million of Amer
ican troops opened Washington's eyes to
the possibilities cf next year and they quit
fiddling and dwadling and putting off of
the raising of the draft age. . If Foch can
pass from defense to offense with a quarter
of a million Yanks, he ought to be able to
smash 'em with 2,000,000, and we plan to
give him 6,000,000 to bridge the Rhine.
The next five months in legislative hall and
executive office and shipyard and shop and
mine and mill and training camp and loco
motive cab will tell just what America can
do to get ready to win the war next year.
The slogan in these United States for the
next five months should be: "Let's win the
war in nineteen-nineteen.
MONDAY BY THE !
Great Britain
Let those who, in their haste, have al
leged that England has not done her full
part in this war, ionsider these facts and
hang their heads in shame: Lord Curzon
of the British war cabinet announced the
other day that Great Britain has given
7,000,000 men to the war. Heavens, what
a total! And Australia, Canada, New Zea
land, India, Ireland, Scotland and Wales
are all represented here; the Seven Sisters
of the Seven Seas, come to help the Mother
at home. Five million Britons are under
arms today in foreign fields of war. de
clared Lord Curzon, so 2,000,000 must
have already done their tit. This means
that there are but -few soldiers in England
now, except invalids and men in training
camps and depots awaiting orders to sail.
The total includes the navy, too. England
has soldiers in France, probably 2,000,000,
maybe 3,000,000 by this time;- and soldiers
in Italy, in Egypt, in Palestine, in Russia
and in Greece. She has kept the seas for
four years inviolate from any German keel
upon their surface. And English gold as
well as English blood kept the war going
until America entered with her billions to
help carry the load. All unprepared at the
beginning except for her Grand Fleet, Eng
land has blundered often and moved slowly
at times amidst great confusion, but there
has never been a doubt as to the resolu
tion and final death grip of the British .bull
dog on the daschund throat. England is in
to stay. In deep. In 7,000,000 men.
"Stand Fast!" is England's word by mouth
of Lloyd George to the allied world. And
some dar, not far distant it may well be,
English troops are going to move eastward
from either Albert or immortal Ypres in an
offensive unmatched and unknown in this
great war. The Briton never forgets. That
German drive of March 29 last is yet to
pay for. And never fear, the Hun will pay.
The stern, dark side of war now presents
its terrible face to America the casualty
lists of the last big drive are just coming
in ! With a quarter cf a million men en
gaged in some of the hardest fighting of
the war, America can well expect no light
lists of the dead, wounded and missing.
But the young republic has been blooded
before. She read the Civil war lists, the
heaviest of modern war with the possible
exception of Napoleon's wars, and did not
shrink from paying the price of an un
divided union. And she will not shrink
now from the great price of world free
dom. But it is sad, very sad, to read the
names of those gallant boys from state after
state of this union who died in those French
forests and among the ripened grain of the
wheat fields and in the sunny vines and
sloping meadows of the land of France.
They died far from home; died so soon
after they pressed foot on France. But, by
the living God! their memory will never
die, either in America or France. Sergy
and its woods and farms and fields will live
forever and for aye in the song and story
of three great nations of the world. .
As the stories of the last Marne battle
come in from the pens of both American
and foreign correspondents, the glory of
the American troops who fought there
glows brighter. When the Prussian Guards
were sent in to drive the Americans back
from Sergy then was seen what the corre
spondents called the? "classic fighting of
the campaign man against man and the
better to win. There was no call for quar
ter. The pride of the professional German
soldier was up against the pride of the free
man of a peaceful republic, both preferring
death to surrender. And as the fighting
extended further eastward hour by hour,
the Prussians who attacked were annihil
ated in every instance." It was declared
further that members of the Prussian Guard
taken prisoner stated that theii orders were
to hold the line at all costs. They obeyed.
Most of them died on that line. Their cour
age and fighting qualities compelled Amer
ican admiration, even as they did at Ypres
three years ago when the English at' bay
destroyed two divisions of the Prussian
Guard, fighting then as now, to the death
and gave ungrudging admiration to their
foes. The common foot soldier has fought
well many times before this war in a bad
cause at his leader's call and command.
More's the pity.
It is quite a ways from the Marne to the
Vesle away from Paris. Maybe some
Frenchman has been tampering with the
crown prince's compass. Could it have
been Ferdinand Foch?
MISS CUMM1NGS SAYS
FORT GRANT NOT
UNDERSTOOD !
PRAISES STATE INDUSTRIAL
SCHOOL AND SAYS IT IS OPER
ATED ON VERY SCIENTIFIC
AND ECONOMICAL PLAN ALL
THE WAY THROUGH
Miss Ksther Cummings; deputy
state and county probation officer, re
turned recently from Ft. Grant wnere
she went by orders of the Juvenile
Court to place a delinquent girl in the
industrial school. The institution has
always sulfered in the public mind
in the past and for this reason Miss
Cummings who has visited the insti
tution frequently, wishes to change'
any such impression by giving a few
facts. Wins CummingB said:
"The institution is at Vort Grant,
Gra'jam county, about 34 miles from
Wlilcox and Is surrounded by several
hirndred acres of land which now is
under cultivation. The boys and girls
departments are separate, the former
being in charge of W. A. Moody, sup
erintendent ot the institution, and the
latter by Mrs. W. A. Moody who tn
turn is assisted by Miss Gettings, the
matron. Miss Gettings has charge of
teaching, cooking and housekeeping.
In the development of industrial train
ing and dicipline the institution under
its supervisors lias taken an advanced
position.
"1 here are at present 94 boys and
15 girls from the ages of 13 to XS
years in the school. Neither boys nor
girls are committed there after the
age of IS years unless it is found ne
cessary. If such measures be taken
they must remain until 21 years cf age.
"the Juvenile court alone, has the
authority to commit any one to the
institution.
"The boys are taught tailoring,
plumbing', farming, shoemaking, car
pentry and printing. Each boy on en
tering the institution is asked to what
trade would Jie care to adapt himself
and, whatever it may be, he is in
structed in It by one skilled in that
particular field. A dairy plant is to
he installed at the institution later.
"The girls, the same as the boys.
I are taught what is fitting occupations.
I such us cooking, kitchen and dining
room work. sewing, laundry and ail
else pertaining to -the home. This.
however, may at first appear some-;
what nnattrartivu and uninviting but;
each is required to do it in the uest J
possible maimer and by persistent el-
it.i 3 strong habits of industry are i
foimcd. I
"A certa'n number cf hours are tie-1
voted to the regular school work and
the remaining time is given to train
ing in the work chosen by the boy or
girl. It any of the rales are disobeyed
either b boy or girl or their behavior
is not satisfactory, they are put on
the 'Lest Privilege Roll' and a slight
punishment is attached. This punish
ment consists merely in depriving the
boy or girl cf certain privileges which
are given the others.
"A very impressive sight is the Jlag
ceremony held at the institution dairy,
in which the boys show the excellent
military training given them by Major
Harter. of New York, who lias been
employed" by ' the institution to in
struct the boys. The flag is raised in
the nicrning and all the members of
the institution are present, and is low
ered at sunset.
In a wcrd the children are uuder
the most favorable conditions for dally
and hourly observation. The offi
cials are men and women of education
and are skilled observers of the chil
dren under their, charge."

the absence of rain, moreover, werejBenn
somewhat offset by the possibility that Dundee
storms from the northwest or from the - Emma
gulf would penetrate the corn belt.
Besides, the trade showed consider
able disposition to await the govern
ment weather and crop reports due to
morrow. Oats were swayed almost entirely
by the action of corn.
Trade in provisions was only of a

To Our Subscribers
j Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it necej
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
fj This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mistakes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory both to the
subscriber and the paper.
fj Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
J Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis

While possessing an excellent show-j great advertisements for a dentist am!
ing in silver-lead, manganese and van
adium, a group of ctoims lying near
the old town or Charlesrtin, this e.jiin
ty, now being developed by lr. VT. K.
Hankin of Bisbee with "William Freyne
ar.d .Miihul Grfdell, the tivo latter
being on :';e property, is noted chiefly
at present for the production of two
immense ivory liu1 ci'ls, ;he teeth of
seme huge, prehistoric ani.na!. One
of U'.ese the doctor his on exhihi'ion
in his cilice in Uie Iii-nk cf Kisbec
buildiug. The other is at the proper
ty. The teeth did not ccme directly from
the property hut from the bed rf t-'.e
San Pedro river, nearby. There,
slumbering in a bed of clay, which un
doubtedly has served as a prtserva
tive through countless ages, the skel
eton of the monstrous thing which
once drew breath of life and roamed
across the plains and valleys of Ari
zona, has lain covered until a few
weeks cgc, when flood waters bared
part of the Jiead. ,
It was dug up by Freyne and Gred
ell. who noticed the peculiar whitish
color of one tooth, protruding through
the surrounding soil. Getting them
out of the hole offered no difficulties
as the jaw bene of whatever animal
It had been was so decayed it fell to
pieces leaving only the ivcry of the
tooth to attest that one it had been
. set in the jaw of a great beast.
That there may be bones which can
be assembled and preserved for the
instruction of posterity, is the belief
of Dr. Hankin. Some day he intends
to go to the place pointed out to him
by Freyne and Gredell to try to un
earth the remainder of the skeleton.
In the meantime he has the two teeth
as mementoes of a departed day when
living things so huce they would
make a rhinoceros of the present day
seem like a lap dog by comparison,
reamed the country over. v
Dr. Hankin recently Iwrote the
Smithsonian Institute in Washington,
try"? to identify the kind of beast or
reptile which wore the tooth. Inciden
tally he asked what such teeth would
he worth. Upon this no-nt he receiv
ed no enlightenment but he was in
formed that the Institute would be
willing to give $C,000 for a complete
skeleton. That would be easy money,
Jf the doctor knew what kind of a skel
eton to hang onto the teeth, but with
out that knowledge it would be hard"
to proceed. Therefore, unless he can
dig out enough bones to complete the
beast and identify its genera, the teeth
will remain interesting but unprofita
ble to their present owner.
Each tooth weiehs several pounds.
They are a fraction under a foot in
length and about eighteen inches in
circumference at the largest part. The

"When they size up those teeth and

tin ir teeth were that large, they feel
better." siiid 'he doctor with a smile.
"Get say, I'd hate to hare been a den
tist in the days when they wore teeth

four cr five of them in a morning. It
would take a blue print and a derrick

in a gold filling wcw! It would take
the output cf a season from Alaska.
There',! be just one consolation. The

correspond."
.Phoenix: A further investigation
today of tho find of skeletons last Mon
day in three caves on the Indian resei-vation-twenty-two
miles southwest of
phoenix, was held today. Altogether
twenty skeletons were found. Sonr
of the older Maricopa Indians were
questioned by Coroner Charles D.
Wheeler and Sheriff Wilkey and said
that the skeletons were those of Papa
go Indians who had at one time or an
other, prior to ten years ago, come
from the Papago country in the south
ern part of Arizona and northern
Mexico to work and had died on the
reservation. The Maricopas, they said,
had put the bodies of them into these
caves. The Maricopas, who have a su
perstitious fear of the dead, would not
go near the caves. They offered no
explanation of the fact that some of
the skeletons were those of children.
All the skeletons that were intact
were well clothed, the clothing having
been nearly new at the time of the
placing of the bodies in the cave. A
pair of shoes on one skeleton had evi
denlty never been worn. The clothing
bore marks of Chicago and Philadel
phia makers. The coroner's jury, ac
cepting the statements of the Mari
copas. found that the caves were a
burial place.

Prisoners sleeping on floor in German prison camp at Darmstadt.
This photo shows a war prisoners
barracks in Darmstadt. The photo
was obtained from a French in
terne who is at present in Geneva,
Switzerland. It givta a clear idea
of the lot of prisoners held by the
Huns. The sleeping accommoda
tions are improvised on the floor.
The prisoner's own chair, made at
his own expense, is placed at his
feet at night to insure a proper
limit for him and to prevent the
German officers in chants from
stepping- all over him. The men
cover themselves with their own
clothing and odds and ends of
other clothing and bedding.

Seven vessels were torpedoed by the
Germans while the British captain was
aboard the U-boat. Previously the
English officer had been in command
of a merchant vessel which had also
met its fate at the hands of a submar
ine crew.
"On the third day after I liad been
taken prisoner," said the captain,
"Just after the midday meal, I gath
ered that the submarine was about to
carry out an attack on a convoy which
had just been sighted. The U-boat
approached submerged for some dis
i tance and torpedoed a large steamer.
Our whereabouts apparently were de
i tected, I was told, by an allied light
' cruiser, for we dived rapidly to a great
depth.
j "Hardly had the submarine reached
,an even keel when we heard and felt
a tjemendous explosion which caused
J the U-boat to vibrate from stem to
j stern. It was a depth charge from the
I cruiser.

hours in such a situation. I'll admit
that I was turning over In my mind
whether I should see my famllv aeain.

eighteen fathoms deep for a long perl-1

Evidently they p'eked up a clue, for

not so near us as that from the cruiser
but quite close enough to cause the
submarine to tremble and then roll
about as though in a heavy sea.

Purpose of Battalion
It is the purpose 01 the develop
ment battalion to receive' from the
various division organizations, men
who are physically, mentally or mor
ally unfit for efficient competent ser
vice or for special branches of domes
tic service and to recommend for dis
charge men who cannot readily be
equipped for either form .of service.
To accomplish this the psychology
loard, the medical department con
nected with the battalion, the military
officers in charge, the educational an 1
physical departments will co-operate
to the fullest degree to bring about
rroper classifications for instructiou
and training groups so that men may
as quickly as possible be made fit for
some branch of the service.
Lieut. O. M. Smith is in charge of
the physical department and A. J.
Fry of the Y. M. C. A. has been ap
pointed by Maor Nelson to head the
educational work, and the programs
of these two men will co-ordinate in
such a way that the educational pro
gram for non-English speaking men
will be almost continuous in that
direct, education in English, recrea
tional games, formal calisthenics and
elementary military tactics will alter
nate for several hours each day.
Classification of Men
For the realization of the purposes
of the battalion, the men have been
classified Into groups as follows:
Group A, men who by comparatively
slight intensive military treatment
tan quickly be made fit for service.
Group B, men who on account of
their lack of knowledge of F.ng'.isu
need. instruction for shorter or longer
periods before they can be effective
soldiers.
Group C men who are psysically
unfit for competent service but who,
through ttieir skill in various Unes,
can be used with slight special train
ing in various departments iu the non
combatant service.
Group D, men who are physically
unfit for combatant service and with-

Mrs. Hall's -Health Falls
Completely Tanlac
Restores Her
"I regret now that I did not take
Tanlac sooner as I would not have
had to sell out my business," saul Mr.'-.
Minnie Hall, proprietor of the lunch
stand known as ".Mother's Lunch," m
the Farmers Market at Seattle, Wash
ington, recently. Mrs. Hall has livel
in Seattle for eighteen years and re
sides at 330 Thirty-ninth avenue. North
West. Continuing her statement Mrs.
Hall said:
"I had suffered from stomach trou
ble and nervousness for several years.
My system got In a terribly rundown
condition and kept geuing worse until
It resulted in nervous prostration. 1
sold out my business because 1 ju:-:t
could not hold out any longer. I was
then taken to the hospital, where I
lay for nearly two weeks, and when
they carried me home I was no bet
ter off than before. My headached so
badly I felt like my eyes were weight
ed down with lead, and my back hurt
so it felt like it would break, my stom
ach got in such a bad condition 1 could
hardly eat anything, and what little I
'did manage to force down would fer
ment, and the pain caused by it would
almost draw me double. Gas would
form and bloat me up so I could not
wear my corset, and I was so nervous
and miserable that 1 never knew what
a good night's sleep was. I lost weight
all the time, and had gotten In such
a bad fix that I really thought my time
had about come.
"Then as a last resort I began tak
ing Tanlac, as I had read end heard so
much about it, and the first bottle
made a big change in my feelings. 1
have taken fouf bottles now. and it
has made such a wonderful improve
ment in ny condition, that I have
bought my business back, and am
working every c'.ay withouythe least
bit of trouble. I have already gotten
bark fifteen pounds of my lost weight,
and am not bothered any more with
headaches or backache. My appetite
is fine, and my stomach is in such
a good condition that I ccn eat ju:;t
anything I want and never feel a sign
of indigestion. I think so much of
Tanlac. that whenever anyone comes
to my stand and talks of having indi
gestion and stomach trouble, I always
tell thetu to take Tanlac. una 1 Know
several people who are taking it be
cause they know what it has cono fcr
me."
Tanlac is sold in r.ls'oec by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Dongas Drug Co.
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, in Sa-.i Simon by
J. B. Cooke, in Willcox by A. A. Nichol
son, in Lowell by l-owell Drug Co., in
Benson by C. F. Moss Pharmacy, and
in Gleeson by B. A. Taylor. Adv.
out special skill in any line who will
be discharged from the service as soon
as their unfitness for any Hue of ser
vice has been fully determined.
Plans Individual Instruction
It is with Group B that the educa
tional department has to deal and tbis
group comprises by far the1 majoi::
of the men. The number of "Y" sec
retaries, together with men selected
fiom Group C, will instruct the tiain
lng groups that will be formed ami
carry the Instruction through the
games and other exercises. It ts
planned to have these instructiou
groups tolerably small so that In
large measure the instruction caa 53
individual. In organizing groups, tile
mental ratings as given by he psy
chology board will be used and men
physically fit for service, will be or
ganized into groups separate fro
those groups of men with physical de
fects, so that the instruction can be
co-oidinated more properly with their
future military instruction. Groups
of men who on account cf mental con
ditions are not likely to be effective
soldiers, will be organized into purely
labor groups and given suitable in
struction for this purpose. No mili
tary instruction will he included in
the program for this group. The
whole program tvill be based upon
the form of service which each indi
vidual man seems destined for.
The value cf the development bat
talion cannot be over-eftii'iated. . Not
only will progress in regular organi
zations be much more rapid with the
elimination temporarily of the unlit,
but with the intensive training which
these men will receive, many of them
will be reclaimed lor sci vice and be
made into excellent fighting men.

Though inuanco costs are mount-
ling V( ry rapidly and fire insura.i-e

'this lime it w:ii be necensury to make
an increase in file rates in the mining

Rise in the cost of building ma

we will say that John Jones built a

His breast and face were badly lacer

materials and labor have gone up 30
greatly, however, that it would cost
$2,000 today to replace the house that
originally cost half that amount. Even
if the lire he mi:;ht have today only
destroyed half the house, there would
be no salvage for the Insurance com
nanv if it attempted to restore the
house to its original condition as may
be demanded of it under the policy.
In the n:atter of replacement of
equipment or purchase of new equip
ment, I might call attention to the fact
that all over the country the municipal
ities are waiting for cost of material
and labor to decrease, which certainly
will not be until after the war has
ended. If then. There is a scarcity
cf material, so much so, in fact, that
when the city of Phoenix recently
wished to extend its water mains it
was fcund necessary to put down
wooden pines for a periad iJntil iron
pi"os co'iU be obtained to replace it."
Mr. Slaker's chief work in this dis
trict was to survey and rate improve
ments made recently on mining prop
erty In the vicinity of P.isbee. There
also were a number of new residences
anfl business buildings to be rated
or re-rated: His mission in Douglas
is similar. While here he was much
