(Pr Review Leased WIr) !
PARIS, Dec. 18. After 1
four days of gathering views
of leaders in France, President
Wilson's closest advisers say
he has seen no reason to
change his belief that the foun
dation of a league of nations
is inseparable from the actual
peace treaty itself. These ad
vices say that the president, in
explaining his definition of
"the freedom of the seas," will
reassure Premier Lloyd George
that he has no intention of
demanding a reduction of the
British navy to a point involv
, ing the safety of the em-
pire, but will emphasize his
feeling that the plan of a
league will strengthen the em
pire. King Victor Emmanuel, who is ex
pected to arrive on Thursday, already
has been fully advised of the presi
dent's plans through conferences with
Count d Cellere, Italian ambassador
to the United States, but the presi
dent will take the opportunity to
make personal explanations to the
king and also to make clear his friend
. liness toward Italy.
The hope is expressed by those sur
rounding the presdient that the ex
change of views will clear away any
partial misunderstandings which may
exist In regard to Mr. Wilson's atti
tude and prepare the way for the as
semblage of the conference with com
plexities removed, so that it -ill be
ready to deal with principles and any
outstanding differences of opinion
that remain.
In all his conferences the president
has taken opportunity to impress his
views, it is said, by those who are
authorized to speak for him, that no
one nation is entitled to assume the
role of master, or dictate the manner
or the conditions of the representa
tions of others.
There is some indication that con-

senate today on the war revenue bill.
The vote on the amendment was 50

negative votes.
Debate on this contested provision
and two hours unexpected discussion
of other subjects delayed progress on
the bill, but leaders still hope tor its
passage by next Monday with a view
to securing an extended recess over
the holidays. Tomorrow the senate
plans to take up the amendment for
repeal next July 1 of the existing zone
system of second class postage rates,
and substitution of a modified zone
system. Several senators expect to
deliver speeches on this subject.

Captain Laning Now Wants
217,000 in Enlisted Section
of American War Fleet
Congress Debates Advisability
of Acceding to His Request
for Enlargement
(By Review leasee Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. Leg
islation authorizing increase of
the permanent enlisted strength
of the navy from 131,000 men to
217,000 was recommended to the
house naval affairs committee to
day by Capt. H. Laning, acting
chief of the bureau of navigation.
This would include 173,000 sea
men. 24.000 apprentices and fire
rhen in training. 12,000 in trade
schools for training and 6,000 in
the flying corps.
Captain Laning explained that this
large increase of men Is needed to
carry out the policy of the naval bu
reau of operations, as recommended
to the naval affairs committee by
Rear Admiral Badger last Thursday,
of making the navy of the United
States equal to thfc "most powerful
maintained by, any nation of the
world."
"Unless an increase in the person
pel is authorized," Captain Laning
said, "no expansion can be carried out.
The, navy was terribly handicapped
by a lack of men even before the
United States entered the war. Ships
were only badly manned and as fight
ing units were almost useless. It
was not until early this year that the
number of men become sufficient.
When the naval reserve force is de
mobilized at the end of the 'national
emergency' as required by present
laws, the navy personnel will be even,
more inadequate than it w:as two
years ago."
Captain Laning also emphasized
the need for more officers in the regu
lar and submitted a plan by which
they might be obtained. It provided j
that permanent commands in the reg-1
ular navy be given to temporary com-,
missioned officers or the navy ana eriy a cier in tne ornce 01 me na

CHICAGO, Dec. 18. The gov
ernment closed its case today In
the trial of Congressman-elect
Victor L. Herger of Milwaukee
End four other socialist leaders
charted with conspiracy to violate
the espionage law. After Judge
Land is overruled a motion to take
the case from the jury and dis
charge the defendants, the social
ists began their case by calling
Adolph Germer, general secretary
of the national socialist party, one
of the defendants, as the first
witness.
Counsel for the defense asked to
have certain government testimony
bearing on the question of conspir
acy excluded from the record. Judge
Landls reserved his decision.
Germer did not get much further
than giving his early personal history
before the court adjourned.
He said he was bcrn -in East Prus
sia, Germany, 36 years ago, and was
brought to this countrv by his par
ents in December 18SS. - His father
was a coal miner and the family liTed
in Braceville, 111. Germer attended
the public and parochial schools and
then went to work in the coal mines.
In 1912 he was a delegate to the
World Conference of Miners, held at
Amsterdam. Germer said he became
a socialist in 1900 by joining the social
ist democratic party, which later be
came the national socialist party. He
said he first met Berger in 1903.
He was elected general secretary of
the national socialist party in 1916.
He described the details of the party's
organizations at length and told of

(By Review Lea.ed Wire)
PARIS, Dec. 18. The American
delegates to the peace congress
have resolved to advocate the
siiiking of the surrendered enemy
warships and resist any proposi
tion to distribute them on the
basis of naval losses. This an
nouncement is made by those in
close touch with the American
representatives, who. it is added,
feei that such a position would re
sult in avoiding contention and
materially support President Wil
son's declaartion that the war was
not based on aggression or acqui
sition of property.
England, through Sir Eric .Geddes.
first lord of the admiralty, had previ
ously acquiesced in the American plan
to destroy the surrendered warships,
and, it. is declared, will continue to
support the measure, although it is
expected that some of the lesser naval
powers will demand that the prizes
be distributed.
American naval stations will be
maintained for at least a year at
Brest, Cibraltar and in the Azores to
render aid to American merchant
ships. The consent of France, Eng
land and Portugal has already been
secured. The aero and radio stations
at these points will be in readiness
to respond to calls for aid by Ameri
can shipping in distress and facilities
will be afforded for needed repairs
and supplies.
The other naval establishments in
Europe have been ordered abandoned
as rapidly as possible, and progress in
this direction has already been con
sidered. The United States navy had
27 aero stations along the European
coast, the material of which, except
at Brest. Gibraltar "and the Azores
is being shipped home. Naval trans
ports, relieved of carrying munitions
will hereafter convey food supplies.
It is expected that the army also
will soon be able to use a number
of its transports similarly on eastern
voyages.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Dec. IS. The an
nual postoffice appropriation bill car
rying a total of J3oi,3a0,000 was pass
ed late today by the. house with an
amendment requiring the postmaster
general to use army aviators for mail
airplanes instead of organizing a sepa
rate posial flying corps. This is the
first of the 190 supply measures to
be passed by the house and it now
goes to the senate.
Supporters of the amendment pro
viding that air mail planes shall be
"operated and maintained by the per
sonnel of the army air service under
the direction of the postmaster gen
eral, argued that under this pian
operation of the service would be less
expensive and that at the same lime
opportunity would be given to train
aviators for the army. Opponeuts con
tended that the' division of authority
between the postoffice and the war
departments would interfere with the
successful operation of the service.
Other provisions of the bill direct
that the secretary of war shall turu
over immediately to the postoffice de
partment more than -i0 airplanes for
extension of the service. The ma
chines specified include 100 De Havi
land fours, 100 Handley-Pagea, and ten
Glenn Martin day bombers. One hun
dred and seventy engines also would
be furnished the postoffice depart
ment. Other amendments to the bill con
tinue in effect wage increases of 15
to 20 per cent granted last year to
clerks in first and second clusa post
offices and carriers in cities. Pro
vision also is made for the creation
of a committee of five senators and
five representatives to recommend to
the next congress readjustment of the
salaries of all postal employes, includ
ing postmasters.
Legislation providing for au in
crease of 60 per cent in the allow

GREAT PROBLEMS!
DEMAND SERIOUSO
CONSIDERATION
Financial Resources of Coun
try Must Be Rationed Dur
' ine Transition From War
to Peace
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON', Dec. 18. A
new era in Americas finance "re
plete with new and momentous
problems demanding no less se
rious consideration than those of
war," is predicted in the Decem
ber bulletin of the federal reserve
, board, made public today.
Rationing of the financial resources
of the country during the transition
period, not widely differing from that
required when the nation was at war;
aid to foreign governments through
the medium of banks, in addition to
that which may be required from the
American government; prevention of
inflation of industry to "those lines
which may properly be called essen
tial," and methods for absorbing of
war loans, were some of the sugges
tions made for securing a sound econ
omic basis for the future.
With the termination of the war,
the United States in common with the
rest of the world is confronted with
problems and needs growing out of
reconstruction but in the opinion of
the board definite limits must be set
to the requirements of public financ
ing. - '
"The liquid capital of the country,"
the bulletin continues, "may tor a
long time to come be inadequate to
meet the demands of the world and
some process of husbanding or ra
tioning it must therefore be applied
during reconstruction, just as has
been the case during the period of the
war . The methods will not be the
same, but will be closely analogous to
those pursued during the war."
Attention is called to the fact that
the federal reserve system is now in
an "exceptional position for influenc
ing the distribution and use of bank
ing credit upon an economic basis."
Necessity for the reduction 'of loans
on war paper is deak with at length
and direct absorption of the govern
ment bonds now carried by the banks
through extensive popular savings is
suggested as a means of creating new
current wealth.
With tnereturn of banks' obliga
tions to normal liquidity and as com
mercial paper takes the place of notes
secured by. bonds and certificates of
indebtedness, now.- making up a large
proportion of the federal reserve sys
tem assets, the bulletin says, prices
will gradually work toward a normal
and stable basis. -.-
"Coincident with the reduction of
democratic -war loans," the bulletin
says with reference to foreign aid,
"there may probably be expected to
develop a direct demand upon our
banking resources for accommodation
designed to facilitate the movement
of goods (q other countries. . . .
from this time forward the bulk of our
foreign ', financing -will necessarily re
tain to a peace basis and the services
of our banks will lie in supplying the
means of financing the movement of
coasummable goods to the foreign
countries by w hich they are needed.)"

ed by the congress, is as follows:

Syrkin. New York; Joseph Barondess,
New York, and Morris Weinchevsky,

York, is secretary of the delegation,
which is under instructions to leave
for Europe as soon as possible.
Mr. Marshall, chairman of the com
mittee on Poland, in presenting- the
bill of rights to the congress, ex
plained that it was drafted jointly by
lour committees that have been con
sidering conditions in Russia, Poland,
Galicia, Lithuania, Ukraihia and the
new Slovak regions. The report rec
ommended the following:
"That the American Jewish con
gress respectfully requests the peace

peace as conditions piecedent to the
creation' of the new or enlarged states
which it is proposed to call into being,
that express provision be made of the

as follows:

The congress adopted the proposi
tion of the national Polish depart
ment and Polish national defense com
mittee for a commission to investi

the Jews and to make a public re
port of the findings. The confmunl
cutioi' from the Polish organizations

THE DUTCH ARE GETTING UNEASY
Many influential and conservative Hol
landers, even those with pro-German lean
ings, view with anxiety the continued stay
of one William Hohenzollern within their
dominions. A Dutch official of high rank
expresses himself frankly on the subject, a
follows:
"Much as I regret that it was a Dutch
nobleman who offered the fallen Hohen
zollern his castle as a refuge, I am not sur
prised. Part of our nobility has always felt
more in common with Prussian Junkers
than with our thoroughly democratic peo
ple. Early in the war the press published
the name of Dutch junkers who were
fighting as officers in the very German
army which would have overrun Holland
as it did Belgium if it had suited the pur
pose of the ex-kaiser and his accomplices.
"The presence of the ex-kaiser in Hol
land is an eyesore to the overwhelming
mass of our people, who from the begin
ning to the end of the war remained whole
heartily in sympathy with the allies. Our
people will not forget that the very man
who fled for safety to our country, and is
today sharing our scanty food supplies, not
only ordered his hordes to slaughter our
Belgian neighbors, but also sent hundreds
of our sailors and fishermen to death
through the destruction of a large part of
our mercantile fleet by the pirates of his
navy."
An editor writing in an influential jour
nal of Holland, says:
"I do not consider it safe to leave the ex
kaiser in Holland, whether interned or not.
It may be, and, I sincerely hope that de
mand will be 'made for his extradition.
Since the governments of victorious na
tions have decided that all those Germans
of whatever rank who are responsible for
the dire atrocities committed during the
war on land, at sea, and from the air shall
be brought to justice, the ex-kaiser can not
possibly escape that fate. This can only
happen after the lapse of many months.'
OUR SOLDIERS WERE 'KNIGHTLY'
(From speech by Otto H. Kahn at V. W. W. cam
paign meeting, Boston, recently):
As I observed our army "over there,
1 felt that in them, in the mass of them,
representing as they do all America, there
had returned the spirit of knighthood. I
measure my words. I am not exaggerat
ing. If I had to, find one single word with
which to cliaracterize our boys, I should
select the adjective "knightly."
A French officer who commanded a
body of French troops fighting fiercely and
almost hopelessly in Belleau wood, near
Chateau Thierry (since then officially des
ignated by the French as the Wood of the
Marine Brigade), told me that when they
had arrived almost at the point of total ex
haustion, on the 4th or 5th of June, sud
denly the Americans appeared rushing to
the rescue. One of their officers hurried
up to him, saluted and said in execrably
pronounced French just six words :"Vous
fatigues, vous partir, notre job." "You
tired, you get away ; our job."
And right nobly did they do their job.
Need 1 ask whether we shall do ours?
Many and conflicting are the stories that
still come out of Germany upon food con
ditions. Ever since the beginning of the
war, the word from this land has been
that the people were starving and the other
word has been that they had plenty. And
it is still so. Here is the view of a well
known newspaper correspondent who is
with one of the armies of occupation, and
it ought to be worth as much as any other:
"So far I can not find any outward sign
of hunger in Germany. There is good
food to be had in all the hotels I have seen,
and even in the country inns. The bread
is coarse, but good butter comes for the
asking. Meat seems plentiful. Cheese is
served for breakfast instead of eggs or
bacon. Coffee is ersatz, or substitute,
made from corn, and not bad. There is no
dearth of sugar. In the hotels potatoes and
cabbages come up with the meat."
BOOZE BY AEROPLANE
(New York Tribune.)
Deep are the difficulties of the destroyers
of the demon. Booze, booze in quantities,
is finding its way by aeroplane into the
sternly severeign state of Florida booze
by the way of New Orleans; booze from
Cuba; booze from the four winds of heaven
The Florida prohibition bill, which its au
thor describes as "the mast drastic anti
liquor law ever framed in the history of
the world," is being defeated of its pur
pose. Hundreds of aviators fly regularly
from half a dozen places in Florida to vari
ous points where illicit stills are in opera
tion. Flights even as far as Philadelphia
have been known.
As a result this law of unparalleled dras
ticity has had to be amended so as to in
clude in its sweeping confication of all ve
hicles or means by which booze is brought
into the state "all machines traveling
through the air." Already it - has
made contraband of automobiles rigged
with "jag tanks." It seems that another
way of introducing the demon into Florida
(and apparently other dry states) was by
motor cars as well, so rigged that the tanks
shall carry gasoline in one side and alco
holic atrocities in the other. Then rooms
are rented by the hotels at so much per
night (sometimes as high as $10), which
includes booze to be found in the bureau
drawers.
All this is a new and unexpected diver
sion of the devil. With a thousand miles
of border to the south of us, three thousand
to the north of us and aeroplanes flying in
every direction the outlook for an abso
lutely air-tight, water-sealed America is not
so bright as it was. The aeroplane i3 evi
dently more of a complication than any
body had ever dreamed. And the sudden
ending of the war finds the United States
with ten thousand aeroplanes on its hands,
part of which it may . have to sell off at
bargain prices. We hope for the sake of
the cause that these may not fall into the
hands of the unrighteous to be used for
nefarious purposes.
ON THE RETURN OF A BOOK
(From Life.) . )
I give humbly and hearty thanks for the
safe return of this book, which, having
endured the perils of my friend's bookcase
and the bookcases of my friend's friends,
now returns to me in reasonably good con
dition. I give humble and hearty thanks that
my friend did not see fit to give this book
to his infant as a plaything, nor use it as
an ashtray for his burning cigar, nor as a
teething ring for his mastiff.
When I lent this book, I doomed it as
lost; I was resigned to the bitterness of the
long parting! I never thought to look upon
its pages again.
But, now that my book is coming back
to me I rejoice and am exceeding glad!
Bring hither the fatted morocco and let us
rebind the volume and set it on the shelf of
honor; for this, my book, was lent and is
returned again.
Presently, therefore. I may return some
of the books that I myself have borrowed.
Topeka State Journal: President Wilson
has been asked to give aid to the demo
cratic party in Germany. Apparently the
Huns have not heard of the results of his
attempt to aid the Democratic party in this
country during the recent campaign.
v' Knoxville Journal and Tribute: "Bread
is being made in the American army by the
new 'sponge' process," it is announced in
Washington. That sounds very much like
the way the Huns are trying to get their
bread.
Kansas City Star: Most of the European
belligerents seem to be agreed on what is
coming to the kaiser. Like the Missouri
juror, they all are convinced he should be
hanged, after being given a fair trial.
Grand Rapids Press: The brewers will

HEED OF SAVING

TRATED
Special Program Being Con
ducted; Knapp Will Ad
dress Meeting at High
School This Evening
Members of the food administration
are frequently asked the question.
"Why is continued food conservation
necessary?"' The same question is
propounded to the grocers daily. A
special program is being conducted
this week throughout the couutry for
the purpose of interesting people in
food conservation and pointing out the
reasons.
The general public are invited to at
tend a meeting at the- Bisbee hinh
school auditorium this evening at S
o'clock. At this meeting. Mr. C. T.
Knapp will speak, outlining the neces
sity for coutinued conservation of
food. Mr. Knapp has made a study
of conditions at home and abroad and
his remarks will be very interesting.
The C. & A. band will render a pro
gram, having patriotically donated
their services for the occasion. There
will also be some musical numbers by
the Bisbee quartet, Messrs. William
son, Blair, Hooper and Tuell.
The committee has also secured the
services of some of the high school
girls to act as ushers.
Mrs. Henry Poppen is in charge of
the week's campaign.
It Is earnestly desired that there
be a large attendance at the meeting
tonight.

manded by Col. Kdmun S. Wr'sht.
who was formerly stationed at Kouk

When the boys from Arizona ar
rived at the camp they were thought
rough and hard-boiled by the officers.
Before leaving, however. they were
congratulated as being the only real
men in the camp.
The treatment accorded tiie boys
was exeel'.'cMit. and while a few milk
fed privates complained of food,
which was spoiled once or twice,
practically all of the boys of this
state gained in flesh and brawn dur
ing their short stay in the unit end
the concensus of opinion was that
they had had a "bully time" at camp.
They were loud in their praises of the
officers and of the adjutant of the
camp, who thought so well of them
that he promoted several of the number.

During the four years of prohibition
in Arizona it was thought that the fra
ternity had about exhausted all means
of transporting liquor, but an entirely
new method was brought to light in
the seizure today. ,
Hot wate'r bottles are used in this
new process. Rubber goods of a good
grade are purchased and filled with
whisky. The rubber bottles are then
placed in a trunk and carefully packed
so that there will be no rattle.
This method precludes the possibil

SPANISH INFLUENZA-JUST GRIP
CAHODFLAGED UNDER A NEW NAME
Most Authorities Now Agree That This Disease Is Simply the
Old-Fashoned Grip, the Same That Has Swept Over the
World Times Without Number. Since 1831 the United
States Has Had Five Epidemics.
The Last Epidemic in 1889-90
Came From Russia by Way
. of France and Was Given a
. French Name, La Grippe.
Ihis Time It Comes by
Way of Spam
ORIGIN OF THE DISEASE
Spanish Influenza, which appeared
In Spain in May, has swept over the
world in numerous epidemics as far
lack as history runs. Hippocrates re
fers to an epidemic in 412 B. C. which
is regarded by many to have been in
fluenza. Every century has had its at
tacks. Beginning with mi.this coun
try has had five epidemics, the last in
1889-90.
THE SYMPTOMS
Grip, or influenza, as it is now
called, usually begins witli a chill, fol
lowed by aching, feverishness and
aometimes nausea and dizziness, and
general feeling of weakness and de
pression. The temperature is from
100 to 104. and the fever usually lasts'
from three to five days. The germs j
thus making the breathing easier,
between the shoulder blades to open
the pores. Then VapoRub should, be
rubbed in over the parts until the skin
is red, spread on thickly and covered
with two thicknesses of hot flannel
cloths. Leave the clothing loose
around the neck as the heat of the
body liberates the ingredients in the
form of vapor. These vapors, in
haled with each breath, carry the
medication directly to the parts af
fected. At the same time. VapoRub fi
absorbed through and stimulates the
skin, attracting the blood to the gur-
fa and thus aids in relieving the
congestion within.
NO OCCASION FOR PANIC
There is no occasion for panic in
fluenza or grippe has a very low per
centage of fatalities not over one
death out of every four hundred cases,
according to the N. C. Board of
Health. The chief danger lies in com
plications arising, attacking principal
ly patients in a run down condition

HOMER DUBOIS DIES
RECENTLY IN TUCSON
The Tucson Star of recent date
contains the following story of the
..u n t..i,:- ...... ...
time, was a resident or tsisoee ana is
well known to a number of the old
timers of the district and Naco and
Cananea. They will regret to hear
of his death:
"Homer M. DuBols, well-known Art
zona pioneer, died last evening about
10 o'clock at a local hospital. He has
been in poor health for some years,
but was taken severely ill only re
cently. He came to Arizona about
35 years ago in the boom days and in
his later years he, was able to live
comfortably on his income from sev
eral pieces of property he owned here.
"Mr. DuBois returned to Arizona
the last time about two years ago,
upon the occasion of the death of
bis son, Eddie DuBois, who was killed
in an automobile accident near Ray.
His other son, Delmar, died about a
month later. Both were children by
his first wife, who died a number of
years ago.
"Mr. DuBois is survived by his
wife, who lives at Jacksonville, Fla.
She accompanied him to Tucson two
years ago, when they came from New
York to attend the funeral of Eddie
DuBois. A telegram was sent to her
last night informing her of her hus
band's death.
"The deceased was 54 years of age
and was born at Abbeville, Vermil
lion parish, Louisiana. He was en
gaged in the cattle business in Texas
in early manhood and was In busi
ness at Naco, Ariz., in the days when
Cananea was a bonanza camp.
"According to his friends, who were
legion in the southwest, DuBois was
a man of strict integrity in his busi
ness relations and in private was
charitable to those in 'need. He was
well-read and his leisure enabled him
to enjoy this diversion. An old-time
friend of Sheriff Ryle Miles, it was
his greatest delight to visit the sher
iffs office almost nightly and rem
inisce of old pioneer days."

BY REVIEW
i NEW YORK, Dec. IS. Heaviness
' prevailed in the stock market today
I alter a firm opening, prices soon
I yielding on light offerings. Pressure
I was not confined to any particular
group, oils and other recent strong
favorites displaying reactionary ten
dencies. United States Steel backed and
filled within a fractional radius, but
independent steels broke more se
verely with the related equipments.
Coppers were temporarily strength
ened by announcement of the organi
zation of a new export company hav
ing for its main object the stabiliza
tion of that industry, but failed to
retain their moderate gains. Tobac
cos, leathers, sugars and utilities were
included among the other irregular to
heavy issues. Sales amounted to
350,000 shares.
The one encouraging feature of the
session was a drop in call money to
4 per cent the ruling rate, however,
apparently was 4 per cent. Deal
ings in foreign exchange were at low
ebb, neutral remittances, especially
to Stockholm and Switzerland, show
ing more firmness.
Conditions in the bond market were
mixed, international issues, notably
Anglo-French 5s duplicating the year's
best at 97, while Liberty isues sagged
under the further weakness of fourth
44, which made a low record at
$95.40). Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $10,875,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. IS. Corn averaged
higher price today chiefly owing to
weather conditions unfavorable to the
crop movement. The close was steady
at the same as yesterday's finish to
lc up. with January $1.36 W to
$1.J6 and May $1,354 to $1.35.
Oats finished unchanged to off,
and provisions varying from 45c de
cline to 5sc advance.
Trade in corn was mainly local and
prices fluctuated often but within a
rather narrow range. During most of
the day, bulls had the advantage, as a
result of continued scantiness of re
ceipts and because of the outlook that
dampness and mild temperatures
would further tend to restrict arrivals.
The only pronounced weak spot in
the market was coincident with a
notice from the food administration
that practically all war rules as to
the handling of grain had been can

here. Three months ago ne came to
Bisbee to wrestle, but was disappoint
ed in getting the match because of
the influenza epidemic. Sin,ce that
time he has been at work in the
mines. His hard work there, added
to his daily workouts at the Y. M. C.
A., has added masses ot muscle to his
already strong frame.
'The Dago is so confident he can
win in a walk from Dixie that ne is
willing to offer the Russian any kind
of terms he may choose. He can
wrestle at any time, any old style
Dixie may prefer and at eaten
weights. If that offer isn't giving
Dixie all the best of it. Id like to
know what would be. All he has to do
is to write me, Ted Rhodes, postoffice
box 1917. Bisbee. and let me know
when, how and for how much he
wants to go on the mat. The Dago
will have money to cover h's side bet
and will be willing to ro on with him
at any time."
Dixie teleeranhed his challenge to
the snurtine editor of the Review from
Jerome and doubtless, as scon as be
can get in touch with Rhodes, arrange
ments for a classy mat engagement
will be started.

The Celebrated Band
In the 158th Infantry band are a
number of men and boys who were
residents of the Warren district and
a number of whom now have relatives
in the district. Some have parents
while others have wives and intended
wives. The band was in the district
and gave a concert at the Orpheum
on June 20. The band has made a
nnfinn.il renutation and while at Camp
Kearny was called to play at more
functions at San Diego than any oth
er band that was stationed at Camp
, Kearny. They left Kearny soon after ;
their visit nere ana nave ruuuuu
to increase their popularity since. The ,
members of the band from the War- j
ren district that the Review has been j
able to learn are as follows: Sgt. i
Richard Osborn, Cpl. Richard Clouds-1
dale, Cpl. Joe Holden, Sgt. Richard
Harper. Sgt. J. W. Chambers, William ,
T. Osborn, Tom Adams, Secomdo
Musso, Clyde Pommell and Alien

The boys on their return to the dis-1
trict will no doubt have many inter-
esting tales to tell of their reception
in Paris and France.
