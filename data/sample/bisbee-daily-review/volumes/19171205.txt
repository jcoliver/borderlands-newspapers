Million Dollars Will Be Spent
At Once On County Roads
Asphalt Highway Bisbee
to Douglas Assured.
Cochise county is to have a million
dollars worth of permanent highways
In the near future. The voters of the
county decreed it at the bond election
held yesterday by a vote of five to
cne. With six precincts (all email
ones) not heard from, the total vote
was 2,165 for and 581 against. If ev
ery vote In the precincts was recorded
against the issue, it could not change
the result
It was a splendid victory for prog
ress and prosperity. Every precinct
in the county reported, except Will-
cox and Bowie, gave good majorities j
for the bond issue. The Warren Dis
trict voted yes on this vital improve
ment 13 to one. Douglas gave only
v two to one majority for the good
roads bends. St. David was the ban-i
1. f , nt1no- K7 '
to Z for the bonds. ' Most of the rural I
districts gave overwhelming majori
ties for the bonds. a -Twenty-five
Milea of Asphalt.
The vote of yesterday means that
the two largest cities of the county
will soon be connected by a solid as
phaltum highway 25 miles long and 18
feet wide. Today a steady stream ot
travel jolts and bumps over the road j
between Douglas and Bisbee. Summer j
rains wash out large sections of this)
road and winter windB blow a cloud !
of dust in the faces of travelers and
1 uncover rocks to hamper their way.
The million dollars to be realized
from the bonds will be used to build I
, roads where they are needed the most, j
Its distribution will be mont fair and j
equitable and it will be handled by
honest and competent men. I
Surpasses Greatest Hopes. j
The victory of yesterday for prog
ress was greater than even the most
ardent friends of the issue had hoped
for. Two to one was the best that
any good roads worker would predict
and many feared the election would
be close. But Cochise citizens rallied
splendidly for this great improvement. :
Their action will stand as a mounment j
that will long be pointed to with pride f
by the people of this section of the

General Dukhonin
Is Murdered By
Infuriated Mob
(By Review Leased Wire)
PETROGRAD, via London, Dec. 4.
(British Admiralty, per Wirefess
Press.) An official announcement
was issued today signed by Ensign
Krylenko. the Bolsheviki commander-in-chief,
confirming the killing by in
furiated members of the Bolshevik!
of General Dukhonin, former commander-in-chief
of the Russian armies, who
recently was deposed because of his
refusal to request German army offi
cials to enter an armistice with Uie
Bolsheviki.
General Dukhonin was killed by be
ing thrown from a train after the Bol
sheviki forces had captured head
quarters at Mohilev, where he had re
mained after his deposition! General
Komiloff, also a former Russian commander-in-chief
and who some time
ago started an unsuccessful revolt
against the Kerensky government,
fled from Mohilev before the arrival
of the Bolsheviki forces.
The text of the communication of
Krylenko follows:
"Today 1 entered into Mohilev at
the bead of the revolutionary troops.
The headquarters was entirely sur
rounded without fighting. The last
Obstacle to the cause of peace has
fallen.
"I cannot be silent on the sad act
of lynch law practiced upon the for
mer highest commander-in-chief. Gen
eral Dukhonin. . Popular hatred sur
passed the limits of reason, and in
spite of all attempts to save him, he
was thrown out of a railroad train at
the Mohilev station and killed. The
flight of General Konriloff the day be
fore the fall of headquarters was the
cause of this excess.
"I cannot allow the banner of the
revolution to be stained, and it is
necessary strongly to condemn such
acts. A revolutionary people are fear
ful in a struggle but they must be soft
after victory."
General Dukhonin was dragged from
a train In which it was intended to
send him to Petrograd and beaten to
death.
Christmas Mail
Is Arriving In
France; Reported
(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IX
FRANCE, Dec. 4. Christmas mail for
the troops began to arrive in the Amer
ican zone today. In one town aftine
a thousand sacks were delivered. The
contents of most of them consisted
of packages of various sizes. Some
of the packages had written on them
"Open at Christmas," and similar in
scriptions. The American postoffices have
made every plan to keep the mails
m'jving from them to the positions
where the addressees are quartered.
Many of the offices are small and it is
feared unless they are constantly kept
cleared congestion may result from
the heavy Christmas mail that Is ex
pected. HAIQ REPORTS ARTILLERY

Western Metal
Producers Will
Protest Prices
(By Review Leased Wire)
SALT LAKE CITY, Dec. 4.
Whether on not western me ail pro
duers will approve federal price fixing
of silver or any other metals appears
decidedly questionable in view of the
prevailing sentiment expressed this
afternoon at the opening session of the
conference of western metal pro
ducers at the commercial club.
While no definite action was taken
in the matter, the spirited debates in
dicated a steadily growing sentiment
in favor of launching. a vigorous pro
test against government interference
in the metal market especially with
reference to silver.
Oppose Profit Tax
Violent opposition was also express
ed to the excess profits tax law in its
present form. While expressing a
willingness to do their share towards
helping in the war, even the confisca
tion of their own property, if need be,
the metal men insisted that the law
in its present form was discriminatory
and unjust to the metal piVducers.
The proposition of the Idaho Mining
association to the effect that the law
3hould be amedJ so as to.elimina:e
all reference to capitalization and to
provide for taxation on the basis on
which individual int'jnies is based,
met with strong support but action
on this was deferred temporarily.
Want Legislation Deferred
In order that the various problems
might be presented to conference in
concrete form, committees were ap
pointed to report tomorrow. One com
mittee is to draft a resolution bearing
on the excess profits tax. aho'Jier is to
present data and reedtumendations re
lating to the silver question and still
another is to present data and recom
mendations concerning lead and zinc.
A telegram was sent tonight vo Sec
action by the government on the sil
ver question be deferred a general
committee representing the confer
ence can reach Washington.
Seventy Producers Attend
The conference was attendedxby 70
leading metal producers from Wash
ton, Montana, Idaho, Nevada. Colorado
and Utah, the largest delegation from
outside states coining from Idaho.
United States Senator Willim H.
King deferred his departure for Wash
ington in order to attend the meeting
In order that he might be fully ac
quainted with the desires of the west
ern metal men. .
Russians Have
Right to Peace,
Army Man Saysl
(By Review Leased Wire)
STOCKHOLM. Dec. 4. The pro
German press in Sweden is greatly
elated over the reoort that Lieut. Col. i
William P. Jdson. chiefly of the Amer-I
lean military mession to Russia, paid j
a friendly visit to Leon Trotzkv. the'
Bolsheviki foreign minister at Petro-j
grad, and -assured hira that Russia
had a right to start peace negotia
tions" and that "the time for menaces
againts the Bolsheviki had passed."
The Dagbladet says:
"This means, assuming that Lieu
tenant Colonel Judson acted under in
structions from Washington, that the
entente may expect little help from!
America m a war to the bitter end
Even newspapers friendly to the
allies see in Colonel Judson's report
ed action idications that "America in
clines to accept the conseqences of
the Bolshevviki rule, and that France
and England will be left to carry on
the war alone." j
The Russian minister to Sweden, j
M. Goukevitch, is openly Incredulous1
concerning the report. He said he
did not believe it and believed that
It was either a direct falsehood or
rad been improperly reported over
the Et hevlki controlled telegraph
wires. The Petrograd telegranh
agency, which is controlled by the
Bolsheviki, on Monday announced 1
that Lieutenant Colonel Judson had
psld an "official visit to the Smolny
Institute," the Bolshevik! l.eadquar '
ters, and that the visit had caused
a sensation In entente allied diplo
matic spheres." '

HUNS TAKE MOKE
CARE OF THEIR
or
(By Review Leased Wire)
President Wilson, In a message to
congress that Is regarded as. one of
the most momentous declarations in
American history, again has enunciat
ed, but more strongly than before,
America's purpose In the war.
He also asked congress to declare
war on Austria-Hungary, the chief al
ly of Germany, but failed to include
in his request Turkey . and Bulgaria.
Germany's other allies, declaring that
were "mere tools, and do not yet
stand in the direct path of our neces
sary action."
The president re-asserted that Ger
man power as now constituted must
be crushed and that then, when the
eGrman people have spokesmen whose
word can be believer, "we shall be
willing and glad to pay the full price
for peace and pay it ungrudgingly."
"Let there be no misunderstanding,"
the president said. "Our present and
immediate task is to win the war and
nothing shall turn us aside from it un-
till it is accomplished. Every power
and resource we possess, whether of
men, of money, or of materials, is be
ing devoted and will continue to be
devoted, to that purpose until it is
achieved."
' Germans Getting Cautious.
The Germans apparently have ceas
ed the reckless expenditure of lives
of their troops in trying to blot out
the Cambrai salient held by General
Byngs forces. After four days of on
slaughts that have been characterized
as equalling any previously witnessed
during the war, only the artillery now
is engaged. Although the Germans
claim the capture of more than 6,000
British prisoners and more than 100
guns( reports from the British war
office and from correspondents indi
cate that the German loss in men kill
ed, wounded or made prisoner was a
terrible price to pay for the very small
recovery of lost terrain.
While it is expected that further at
tacks will be delivered on the Cambrai
sector, which is a salient vitally men
acing to the important railroad junc
tion of Cambrai, the British troops are
declared now to be in a better position
to offer stronger resistance than here
tofore.' Artillery Still Active.
As yet the anticipated renewal by
the Austro-Germans of their infantry
attacks on a large scale against the
Italians on the Venetian front has not
materialized. The enemy artillery,
however, continues active from the
Asiago plateau eastward toward the
headwaters of the Piave river. On
the. Trentino front an enemy attack
which was prepared for by a heavy
bombardment met with repulse. Alang
the Piave valley the Italians again
have dispersed Austrian bodies con
solidating for attacks.
No Change at Palestine.
In Palestine the battle between the
Turks and the British fr the posses
sion of Jerusalem has not begun.
Taken all in all, there is no change
in the situation in this region, al
though General Allenby's forces have
carried out small offensives in the na
ture of raids and killed or captured
the occupants of Turkish trenches.
The Russian general staff head
quarters on the northern front ha9
been captured by the Bolsheviki
troops under Ensign Krylenko. The
headquarters capitulated without fight
ing, but General Dukhonin, the commander-in-chief,
who declined recently
to carry out the orders of the Bolshe
viki to negotiate an armistice with the
Germans, was thrown from a train by
Bolsheviki troops and killed.

BREAK WITH AUSTRIA DOES NOT
SURPRISE MANY: READJUSTMENT!
Of U. S. AFFAIRS UNNECESSARY
(By Review Leased Wire) l
WASHINGTON, Dec. 4. Declara-'
tlon of war with Austria-Hungary in-1
volves a little readjustment of affairs!
between the United States and the!
i!ual monarchy .be.-ause the state of,
war which congress is about to de
clare exists, actually has been in ef
fect for many months. j
There have been no such depreda
tions on American lives and rights by!
Austrian military forces as has been
the case, with Germany, but Austria'
aathe ally of Germany has gradually'
ccme into a position where the Amer-I
ican government has realized that
she must be included with Germany
as an enemy. This was apparent
even before the Teutonic invasion of
Italy made the Austro-Italian frontier
literally a part of the western front
on which American forces are oper-j
ating. .There has been no outstand-i
ing "overt acf on the part of Aus-I
tria against the Unite States; there I
have been rather a series of acts
short of being classed -as cause for,
war. They go back to the beginning'
of the European war.
Were Austrian Subs
Long before Ambassador Dumba
was sent home as an instigator ot
strikes in American manufacturing
plants, the government had evidence
that the Austrian diplomatic and con
sular service was being used in this
country for Germany's warlike pur
poses. The secret service found the
Austrian diplomatic code and the of
fices of Austrian consuls were being
used for activities Germany could not
carry on in the United States with
-.er own officia's. In some cases
where submarines sunk unresisting
passenger liners with great loss of
,'ifc, it appeared that the U-boats
themselves were Austrian, but there
was little doubt that the officers and
crew were- Germans and that the sub
mersibles were acting under German
"rders. The most flagrant cases of
that sort was the destruction of the
Italian liner Anconi, in which re
sponsibility neer was definitely es
tablished. The first attack on an American
of the nation was that upon the Amer
ican tank steamer Petrolite. An Aus
trian submarine fired on the ship.
ARIZONA VILLAGERS
BUILD HOUSES OF
PREHISTORIC DEBRIS
(Py Review Leased Wire)
"SO' OMONSVILLE. Ariz., Dec. 4.
Houses built in part from the debris
f so-rie race, the history of which no
"ne has any knowledge, is a peculiar
"es'ure of this village. Fragments of
"ttery, very numerous in certain lo
calities, become mixed in the adobe
of the large sun-dried bricks of
whic'a the houses are constructed,
serving as a BOrt of hinder. Thus any
householder may stand by the walls
of his domicile and with his pocket
knife dig out pieces of beautifully
decorated ' and glazed pottery, fash,
loned, perhaps, thousands of years
pgo. Also, figuring as a common
stone in the low foundation it is quire
possible to find xne tr more of the
rude mortars in which some prehis
toric housewife ground her corn.
The water jar of a majority of the
families here -is one of the ancient
ollas, made of poetry, some over two
feet in height, hundreds of which have
been dug up in perfect condition in
this valley. It is well established that
from the Rio Gila those ancient resi
dents took water for irrigation, as
traces of. their canals have been
found by modern builders of the same
utility. Above this village the founda
tion walls of their communal houses
extend for several miles, thus prompt
ing the first Mexican settlers to call
the region Ciudad Vieja, meaning an
ancient village.

German submarines in the Mellter

been interchanging flags to avoid re
sponsibility for lawless acts.
Quite aside from the question of
"overt acts," however, the principal
consideration of the government in
deciding on war with Austria-Hungary
is the nature of the alliance between
Austria and Germany which made it
anomalous to war with the latter and
not with the former. Difficulty piled
upon difficulty and much as he hoped
to avoid it, the president was forced

I. W. W. Are German Spies
The Germany spy system in the
United States today is known to be
manned largely by subjects of Austria-Hungary,
many of them members
of the Industrial Workers of the
World, and the recent attempts of
that organization Jlo. hamper the gov
ernments' war preparations are
known by the department of justice
to be traceable to the German sys-'
tern.
American secret service men found
the trails of the notorious Von Papen
and Boy-Ed leading through the Aus
trian consular service in this country.
Every turn of the government toward
combatting the German espionage
system found evidences of how Ger
many was using Austria.
Members of congress and many ad
ministration officials realizing, the sit
uation have for months urged a dec
laration of war.
REDLIGHT DISTRICT
OF BISBEE MUST GO,
CITY FATHERS SAY
Acting under definite instructions
from the secretary 'of war and in com
pliance with the act of congress regu
lating the moral conditions in and near
military camps, the Bisbee city council
last night passed a resolution ordering
the chief of police to close the red
light district of this city. The time
liniit for the execution of this 'ortiei
was left to the discretion of Cnief Al
lison, but it was the general expres
sion of the mayor and councilmen thai
it be done within the next ten or fif
teen days.
Lieut. Poppaneau of the regular
army appeared before the council by
request in connection witn tne 'jrdrt
Mayor Ericsson had received from the
war department, and declared that
sinee a detachment of the 35th in
fantry was permanently stationed be

ccuncil was plain. After the council
had passed the resolution. Lieutenant
Popponeau thanked that, body In he
half of the government.
The resolution prohibited tiie dis
trict l'jr the period of the war. in con
formity with the prohibition clause of
the act of congress. No ordinance cov

measure and just as effective.
CITY COUNCIL MEET;
POLICEWOMEN MAY
BE APPOINTED HERE
At the council meeting last night
Mrs., Fred Reynolds and Mrs. Harry
A. Stewart, representing the Parent
Teachers' association, asked for the
appointment of a policewoman for
Bisbee. The council referred the mat
ter to Chief Allison for investigation
and a report.
The council discussed at length the
necessity for strict ccriomy in ex
penditures for the next four months,
especially for street work. The floods
last summer necessitated so much ex
tra street work that the budget for
that department was encpertcl hv
some $2000. For a while last summer
street cleaning gangs were. busy the
greater part of everv week after a
heavy rain cleaning the streets of the
business section of debris washed
down the canyon. The work was im
perative if traffic was to be main
tained through the streets.
Collections for the month of No
vember, according to the report read
by the city clerk, totaled $16,413.40.
Of this sum $408 was realized from
police court fines.
There were five 'ires last month,
only one of which caused much dam
see. The total fire loss was about
$1200. 1
GOVERNMENT BARS
CERTAIN TRADERS
IN LATIN COUNTRIES
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 4. A black
list of 1600 firms in 20 Central and
South American countries with whom
merchants of the United States are
forbidden specifically to do business
except under special licenses, was pro-,
mulgated tonight by the war trade;
board. H is oll'icially styled "enemy
trading list," and constitutes the lirt
section of a record which eventually
will include the names of firms in ;
most of the countries of the World, In- j
eluding the United States itself. j
Latin'Amerlca Is dealt with first be-:
cause of the large number of German I
firms in the southern republics ac:ive
in aiding Germany's cause. Evidence
put before the war trade board has
shown that many of these firms, in
cluding public utilities companies,
have financed to a large degree Ger
man propaganda work in the United
States. All those named in the list
issued tonight have been charged wi'.h
secretly or openly assisting America's
enemies.
The action is taken under authority
conferred on the president by the
trading with the enemy act and is de
signed solely for the guidance of
American concerns and to enable
them to observe the provisions of the
law.
Any license issued Cor trading with
firms named in the list will be apart
from the regular export and import
licenses which must be obtained for
shipment in or out . of the United
States of most commodities.
It is possible that in many in
stances licenses may be Issued, as it
may be found that trading in certain
commodities with those named in the
list will not work any advantage i'Jr
Germany or her allies.
To minimize inconvenience to mer
chants in this country, arising from
the declaration, the war board will
classify the names of nonenemy firms
dealing in the same commodities who
may serve as subsiitutes for the black
listed concerns.
In issuing the list officials make it
plain that it cannot be made complete
and that merchants trading with en
emy firms r.'Jt named are in no meas
ure relieved from prohibitions and pen
alties contained In the trading wUh the
enemy act. Most of the firms named
in the list issued tonight bear Ger
man names, although others evidently
are of English, Spanish, French and
Portuguese derivation. The list as it
applies to Brazil contains the greatest
number of firms, with Mexican second.
The announcement of the list said it
was issued at the urgent request of
Americans engaged in foreign trade,
wh'j sought government guidance in
their efforts to obey the law.

COMMISSIONERS TO
HOLD MEETING ON
COUNTY SEAT MATTER
The county . commissioners of Co
chise will hold a special session at
the court house in Tombstone to can
vass the petitions for removal of the
county seat. The result of this exam
ination of the petitions, regarding
their validity," etc., will depend
whether or not a special election will
be held to vote on the location of the
county seat.
DouRlas has agitated the county
seat removal recently, and there has
been some talk in Bisbee of going after
the county capital. The same argu
ment against Tombstone's extreme
and undesirable location could be used
against Douglas. The Warren district
is the center of the county's popula
tion and wealth. But far be it from
the Review to start any county seat
fight a', this time. This paper merely
mentions the fact in the case, as it is
bound to do in behalf of its own com
munity. If the commissioners find the
petitions adequate and legal, and then
call a county seat electAn, it will be
time enough then to talk about the
claims of contestants and the claims
of Tombstone to hold the seat of gov
ernment she has held so long.

A PRAYER FROM THE FIELD.
. .
God grant that in the bitter strife
. Which an must face who linger here.
Upon the. battered Field of Life,
Or with the laurel swinging near
Along the world's red firing line
The battle of the strong and weak
The fate of all the Fates be mine
I will not shew the Yellow Streak.
If fortune play me false or fair
If from the shadowland I creep
Or up the heights and linger there
Or topple downward to the deep
Or up the rugged path of Fame
Where one man fails another mounts
God grant that I play out the game
For their is nothing else that counts.
Grantland Rice.
CHRISTMAS GIFTS.
There is every indication that practical common sense
will govern the conduct of tb Christmas buyers this
year. Useful rather than pretty gifts will be the rule.
A million soldiers in camp and field must be remembered,
and their gifts, governed by thi limits of transportation,
must of necessity be compact, practical and useful.
And yet the spirit of Christmas should be as true and
fine and great this year as it has ever been before. It'
is essentially the children's day. There must be toys
to gladden the hearts and sustain the fond traditions of
other Christmas mornings. The sale of drums and horns
and lead soldiers and toy guns and swords and cannon
ough to be greater than ever before. Every little boy
in the land is sighing right now for a gun for Christmas.
Ah, it was only a few years ago that the boys now in
France were little boys eagerly apaitinij Christmas
mornings with its drum and toy soldier and glad hours
at play. And they are soldiers now, these boys of yester
day, with real guns in their sinewy hands and serried
rows of German cannon facing them on the ridges be
yond the mist and the Champagne valleys.
' What shall we buy our boys for Christmas this year?
A toy gun for the little boy at home instead of candy.
Candy for the big boy In France instead of a gun.
It will be a strange Christmas this year. A million
young men are under arms. War taxes and the multi
tude of needs of war press us sore. But we can all give
a little gift to make a heart glad. The spirit of Christmas
should rise supreme above mortal doubts and fears, for
it was born of immortality.
If we must be practical and economical this year, we
can none the less observe the spirit of the day. Tbe day
has always been overdone with ornate display. It was
ushered in first by simple shepherds, a carpenter and a
woman and a babe In a stable.
Let us go ahead and prepare for the day with brave,
proud hearts. If we are at war, it is a war for the right.
Good judgment, good sense and love can more than atone
for a lean purse in bringing, a glad Christmas time. A
happy medium always makes a happy day.
We have meatless an'V'wheatless days, but we do not
need to have a giftles Christmas. And at the same time
we do not need to offend the watchful Mr. Hoover or
any of his clan.
This country has been shamelessly prodigal and waste
ful in everything and stern measures of repression will
be good for every one of us. A practical Christmas
ought to be just as happy as an extravagant one. A fond
thought and token for our soldier boys, a toy for the kid
dies, a gift for a loved one at home, a smile for our
friends and a prayer for our country. These will make
a war time Christmas.
Strange as it may see n, the Devil's letter to the kaiser,
published recently in these columns, has been the most
popular war article among Bisbee readers that has ap
peared for a long time. This general expression of ap
proval of a letter that links the devil with the German
emperor and makes liis satahic majesty play second fid
dle, is significant of the estimation in which Wilhelm is
held iu this district.
EMBARGO ON TELEPHONE CALLS.
(Washington Star.)
The first war time embargo on telephone messages I
the District will become effective immediately, when re
quests on operators for the time, for baseball, football
or other sporting results will have to be discontinued.
In aa announcement recently the Chesapeake and
Potomac Telephone company declared that unless this
step ia taken the company cannot render the efficient
service necessary to war time conditions.
In Washington alone the company estimates operators
are asked clock time thirteen thousand times a day.
From bow on individaala seeking to ascertain the loca
tions of fires, the outcome of sporting events and the
time will not be able to obtain bis information from op
erator. "
Telephone traffic in Washington today is flowing 50
per cent above normal, creating a telephone situation
most difficult to handle, according to the company.
PROBABLE EXODUS OF CARRANZA.
(Los Acgeles Times.)
Mexico has been going steadily to the devil ever since
Porflrio Diaz was exiled In 1910. Now it is Carranza's
tur to go, and no tears will be shed either north or south
of the Rio Grande w'ben he departs. Although he has
officered his army with Germans and pro-Germans, yet
Von Eckhart will not loan him any money, and Wall
street has closed Its purse with a sudden and relentless
snap in answer to his urgent appeals.
Nature and the United States are both arrayed against
Carranza. 'A recent freeze annihilated the corn crop In
Northern Mexico, and President Wilson has placed an
embargo on the exportation of foodstuffs to that country.
Mr. Hohenzollern's government has made large pur
chases of Mexican army officers, but those purchases
have of late been discontinued.
There are 14,000.000 Mexicans who are not weeping
for the loss of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and Califor
nia seventy years ago; who are not deeply moved because
Carranza will not adopt the anarchical constitution that
Lincoln Steffens wrote for Mexico, and who are neither
Villistas. Zapatistas nor Felix is tas. But they are 14,
000,000 who are beginning to feel the pangs of hunger.
Their foodless condition they attribute rightly or wrong
ly to Carranza, and unless the general Central and South
American conference called by Argentina for January can
adopt effective measure? that will save him the presi
dency his retirement from office will be as sudden as
that of his predecessors.
Whether he will be succeeded by a sane and patriotic
ruler or by anotV-r self-seeking, bombestic aUninity is
something that only the Lord can foresee and the Lord
won't tell.
, Once we had a "billion dollar congress" and .we made
a lot of fuss about its extravagance. Now comes a twelve
billion dollar congress and we accept its expenditures
with equanimity. As Galileo said: "The world does
move."
A son of General Botha is fighting in the British army.
No stronger proof could be advanced of the success of
British policy than this item of news. General Botha
was one of the bravest and bitterest of the old Boer
chieftains who fought Britain so well only a few years
ago. And today his son fights for Britain with eager
pride. General Smuts, another brilliant Boer chief, is
also fighting for the British in Africa. English colonial
policy, since the American revolution, has been her
brightest bid for greatness and glory in the world's affairs.
If friends and sympathizers with the I. W. W. methods
of Improving the condition of the working men can get
any happiness or satisfaction out of the acquittal of Em
bree at Tucson last week they are welcome. Embree
was a leader in the Bisbee strike.' He was arrested,
placed in jail and brought to trial on a charge of inciting
a riot and of being a bad actor generally. He was ac
quitted because of lack of definite and certain evidence.
His riot was nipped in the bud by the deportation. But
be and his fellows did a lot of harm. They led a lot of
workingmen into a strike without a shadow of a griev
ance and they plunged the entire district into the unrest
and disordered business conditions that a strike always
brings. Aud. as is always the case, the rank and file
suffer Iofs of time aud money and habits of industry,
while the leaders go free to continue their ill adv'sed
methods and vicious attacks upon the fundamental
principles of society.
At last we are to moveVrora a foolish and false positiou
and declare war -upon Austria. The president's request
of congress yesterday to number this German province
among' our enemies will be granted at once and will have
the hearty approval of the nation at large. The Austrian
embassy at Washington will be closed and these German
dependents ordered to depart these shores. Austria is
merely a German puppet. The strings from Berlin move
the little Austria boy. Austrian guns and soldiers and
ships are under the orders of the German general staff
and have been used always for tbe same purposes of
pillage, outrage and destruction of free peoples that the
German instruments have been used. Any hope that
Austria will break from the yoke is as vain as the Jiop
that the German people will cast off the HoheiizoUerns.
We are fighting all thing German until we win the war.
Bulgaria and Turkey arc of the same Infamous stripe
and Russia is making every preparation to join them.
The world's'best against the world's worst is the align
ment of the war.

(Continued From Page One.)

They have been months crowded with
events of immense and grave signifi
cance for us. I shall not undertake to

to be diverted until it is won. But it , tfaat are ready t0 agree t0 et.
is worth while asking and answering i t t h rt iatir anA th
the question when shall we consider
the war won? '
Hear Pacifist Talk.
From one point of view it is' not
necessary to broach this fundamental
matter. I do not doubt that the Amer
ican people know what the war is
about and what sort of an outcome
they will regard as a realization of
their purpose in it.' As a nation we
are nnited in spirit and intention. 1
pay little heed to those who tell me
otherwise. 1 hear the voices of dis
sent who does not? I hear the criti
cism and the clamor of the noisy,
thoughtless and troublesome. I also
see men here and there fling them
selves in impotent disloyalty against
the calm, indomitable power of the
nation.
What the War i For.
I hear men debate peace who under
stand r.either its nature nor the way
in which we may attain it with uplift
ed eyes and unbroken spirits. But I
know that none of these speaks for the
nation. They do not touch, the heart
of anything. They may safely be left
to strut their uneasy hour and be for
gotten. But from another point of
view I believe that it is necessary to
say plainly what we here at the seat
of action consider the "war to be for
and what part we-mean to play in the
settlement of its searching issues. We
are the spokesmen of the American
i tletnent based upon justice and the
reparation of the wrongs their rulers
have done. They have done a wrong
to Belgium which must be repaired.
They have established power Over
other lands and peoples than their
own-rover the great empire of Austria-Hungary,
over hiUierto free Bal
kan states, over Tjirkey and within
Asia which must be relinquished.
Admire German Enterprise.
Germapv's success by skill, by in
dustry, by knowledge, by enterprise,
we did not grudge or opose. but ad
mired rather. She had built up for
herself a. real empire of trade and in
fluence, secured by the peace of the
world. We were content to abide
the rivalries of manufacture, science
and commerce that were Involved for
us in her success and stand or fall as
we nad or did not have the brains and
the initiative to surpass her.'
But. at the moment when she had
conspicuously won her triumphs of
peace she threw them away to es
tablish in their stead what the world
will no longer permit to be establish
ed, military and political domination
by arms, by which to oust where she
could not excel the rivals she most
feared md hated.
Peace Must Remedy Wrong.
The peace we make must remedy
that wrong. It must deliver the onee
fair lands and happy peoples of Bel-
j giirm and northern France from the
people and they have, a right to know Prussian conquest nd the Prussian
whether their purpose is ours They menace but lt must aiso deliver the

Partnership of Peoples.
That partnership must be a partner
ship ol peoples, not a mere partner
ship of governments. It might be Im
possible, also. In such untoward cir
cumstances to admit Germany to the

be said again that autocracy must
first be shown the utter futility of its
claims to power or leadership in the
modern world.
Must Defeat German Master.
It is iuilMjshil.Ie to apply any staud-
things sooner or later cure Itself by
processes which would assuredly act
In.
The wrongs, the very deep wrongs,
committed in this war, will have to be
righted. That, of course. But they
1-aunot and must uot be righted lv
the commission Sot c'fnllar wrongs
against Germany and her allies. The
world will not permit the commission
of similar wrongs as a means of repar
ation and settlement.
World Understand Issue.
Statesmen must by this time have
learned that the opinion of the world
is everywhere wide awake and fully
comprehends the issues involved. No
representative of any 'seK-governed
nation will dare disregard it by at
tempting any such covenants of self
ishness and compromise as were en
tered into at the congress at Vienna.
The thought of the plain people here
and everywhere throughout the world.
the people who enjoy no privilege and
have very simple and unsophisticated
standards of right and wrong, is the
air all governments must henceforth
breathe if they would "live, lt is in
the full disclosing light of that thought
that all policies must be conceived
and executed in this midday hour of
the world's life. German rulers have
been able to upset the peace of the
world only because the German people
were not suffered under their tutelage
to share, the comradship of other peo
ples of the world either in thought
or in purpose.
Had No Voice.
They were allowed to have no opin
ion of their own which might be set
op as a rule dC conduct for those who
exercised authority over them. But
the congress that concludes this war
will feel the full strength of the tides
that run now in the hearts and con
sciences of free men everywhere. Its
conclusions will run with those tides.
All these things have been true
from the very beginning of this stu
pendous war; and I cannot help think
ing that if they had been made plain
at the very outset, the sympathy and
enthusiasm of the - Russian people
might have been once for all enlisted
on the side of the allies, suspicion and
distrust swept away and a real and
lasting union of purpose affected.
Russians Vtave Been Poisoned.
Had they believed these things at
the very moment of their revolution
and had they been confirmed In that
belief since, the sad reverses which
have recently marked the progress
of their affairs toward an ordered and
stable government of free men might
have been avoided.
The Russian people have been
poisoned by the very same falsehoods
that have kept the German people in
the work, and the poison has been
administered by the very same hands.
The only possible antidote is the truth.
It cannot be uttered too plainly or too
often.
Re-Iterates Former Statement.
From every point of view, there
fore, lt has seemed to be my duty to
speak these declarations of purpose,
to add these specific Interpretations
to which I took the liberty ot saying
to the senate in January. ' Our en
trance into the war has not altered
our attitude toward 'the. settlement
which must come when It is over. I
said in January that the nations of
the world were entitled -not only to
free pathways upon the sea but also
to assured and unmolested access to
these pathways I was thinking, and I
am thinking now, not of the smaller
and weaker nations alone, which need
our countenance and support,' but also
of the great and powerful natioos, nd
of our present enemies as well as our
present associates in the war.
I was thinking, and am thinking, ot
Austria herself, among the rest as well
as of Serbia and of Poland.
Seek Permanent Peace.
Justice and equality of rights can
be had only at a great price. We are
seeking permanent, '.not temporary,
fonuda tions for the peace of the world
and must seek them candidly and fear
lessly, as always the right will prove
to be the expedient.
What shall we do then to push this
great war of freedom and justice to
its righteous conclusion? We must
clear a way with a thorough hand all
impediments to success and we must
make every adjustment of law that
will facilitate the full and free use of
our whole capacity and force as a
fighting unit.
War On Austria.
One very embarrassing obstacle that
stands in our way is that we are at
war with Germany but not with her
allies. I therefore very earnestly rec
ommend that the congress immediate
ly declare the U. S. in a state of war
with Austria-Hungary.
Does it seem'' strange to you that
this should be the conclusion of the
argument I have addressed to you? It
is not. Tt is. in fact, the inevitable
logic of what I have said. Austria
Hungary, is for the time being not her
own mistress, but simply the vassal
of the" German government. We must
face the facts as they are and act up
on them without sentiment in this
stern business.
The government of Austria-Hungary
is not acting upon its own initiative
or in response to the wishes and feel
ings of its own peoples, but as the in
strument of another nation. We must
meet Its force with our own and re
gard the central powers as but one.
No Other Course.
Th (war tan be successfully con
ducted in no other way. The tame
logic would lead also to a declaration
of war against Turkey and Bulgaria.
They also -are the tools of Germany.
But they are mere tools and do not
yet stand in the direct path of our
necessary action. We shall go wher
ever the necessities of this war carry
us. but it seems to me that we should
go only where immediate and practical
considerations lead us and not heed
any others.
The financial and military measures
which must be adopted will suggest
themselves as the war and IU under
takings develop, but I win take the
liberty of proposing to you certain
other acts of legislation which seem
to me to be needed for the support of
the war and for the release of our
whole force and energy.
' Must Extend Legislation
, It will be necessary to extend in
certain particulars the legislation of
the last session with regard to alien
enemies; and also necessary, I be
lieve, to create a very definite and
particular control over the entrance
and departure of all persons into and
tic in the United States.
Legislation bhuillU be enacted de
fining as a criminal offense every
wilful violation of the presidential
proclamations relating to alien ene
mies promulgated under section 4067
cf the revised statutes and providing
appropriate punishments; and women
as well as men should be Included
under the terms of the acts placiug
restraintt upon alHn enemies.
Suggest Imprisonment
It is likely that as time goes on many
alien enemies will be willing to be
ted and housed at the expense of the
government in detention camps, and
it would he the purpose of the legis
lation I have suggested to confine of
fenders among them In penitentiaries
end other similar Institutions where
ihcy could be made to work as other
criminals do.
Recent experience has convinced
me that the congress must go further
In authorizing the government to set
limits to prices. The law ot supply and
demand, I am sorry to say, has been
replaced by the law of unrestrained
selfishness. While we have eliminated
profiteering in several branches of in
dustry it still remains impudently
rampant in others.
Farmers Complain
The farmers, for example, complain
with a great deal of justice that, while
the regulation of food prices restricts
their incomes, no restraints are placed
upon the prices of most of the things
they must themselves purchase; and
similar iniquities obtain on all sides.
It is imperatively necessary that
the consideration ot the full use of
the water power of . the country and
also the consideration , of the sys
tematic and yet economical develop
ment of such of the natural resources
of the country as are still under the
control of the federal government
should be Immediately resumed and
arflrmatively and constructively dealt
with at the earliest 'possible moment.
The pressing need of such legisla
tion is daily becoming more and more
obvious. The legislation proposed at
the last session with regard to regu
lated combinations among eur export
ers in order to provide for our for
eign trade a more effective organlia
tlon and method of co-operation
ought by all means to be completed at
this session. '
Recommend Financial Committee
And I beg that the members of the
house of representatives will permit
me to express the opinion that it will
be impossible to deal in any way but
a very wasteful and extravagant fash
ion with the enormous appropriations
ot the public moneys which must
continue to be made if the war is to
be properly sustained, unless the
house will consent to return to its
former practice of initiating and pre
paring all appropriation bills through
a single committee in order that re
sponsibility may be centered, expendi
tures standardized and made uniform
and waste and duplication as much
as possible avoided. '
Additional legislation may also be
come necessary before the preseiw
congress adjourns in order to affect
the most efficient co-ordlnatjon ' and
operation of the railway and other
transportation systems of the coun
try; but to that I shall, if circum
stances should demand, call the at
tention of congress upon another oc
casion. If I have overlooked anything that
ought to be done, for the more ef
fective conduct of the war, your own
counsels will supply the omission.
What I am perfectly clear about is that
in the present session of the congress
our whole attention and energies
should be concentrated on the vigor
ous and rapid and successful prosecu
tion of the great task of winning the
war. f
America Was Forced
We can do this with all the greater
zeal and enthusiasm because we know
that for ns this is a war of high prin
ciple, debased by no selfish ambition
of conquest or spoliation; because we
know, and all the world knows, that
we have been forced rinto it to save
the very institutions 'we live under
from corruption and destruction. The
purposes of the central powers strike
straight at the very - heart of every
thing we believe in; their methods of:
warfare outrage every principle of!
humanity and of knightly honor; their
Intrigue has corrupted the very;
thought and spirit of many of our:
peoples. Their sinister and secret1
diplomacy has sought to take our.
very territory away from us and dis-j
rupt the union of the states. Our;
safety would be at an end and our
honor forever sullied and brought into i
contempt were we to permit their tri-j
umph. They are striking at the very'
existence of democracy and liberty.;
War of Purpose j
It is because it is for us a war of,
high, disinterested purpose In which '
all the free peoples of the world arej
banded together for the vindication
of right a war for the preservation i
of our nation and of all that it has
held dear of principle and of pur- j
pose that we feel ourselves loublyi
constrained to propose for Its out-1
come only that which Is righteous.1
and of irreproachable intention, for
our foes as well as for our friends. !
The cause being Just and holy, thej
settlement must be of like motive anB'
quality. For this we can fight, but
for nothing less noble or less worthy
ot our traditions. For this cause we ;
entered the war, and for this cause ;
will we battle until the last gun is
fired. j
I have spoken plainly, because this;
Eeems to me the time when it is most ,
necessary to speak plainly, in order1
that all the world may know that;
evcu in the heat and ardor of the:
struggle and when our whole thought ,
Is r.f carryi-ij,' the war through to its j
end and we have not forgotten any
ideal or principle for which the name:
of America has been held in honor j
among the nations, and for which it i
has been our Rlory to contend In th'
great generations that went before!
lis. A supreme moment of history I
fas come. The eyes of the people j

hxnd of God Is laid upon the nations.
He will show them favor. I devoutly,

TAKES VICTROLA
The yonng ladies' club Tc'jm of the
Phelps Dodge store, was entered last
evening and the Victrola that has been
used to furnish the music for the
dances was carried off. Entrance -was
gained to the club rooms by breaking
one of the windows. The thief then
opened the door and carried the ma
chine out. It is believed Co be the
work of a Mexican, as one was seen
going down the railroad track south
ot the Copper Queen store with a ma
chine in his arms. He also took the
largest portion of the records. He let
several of them fall in his hurry . to
get 'out and the pieces were found.

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

STOCKS ARE DULL
NEW YORK. Dec. 4. Stocks were

message and reacted almost violently
in the feverish final hour, extreme
reversals ranging from 2 to 4 points,
t'nitfd State3 Steel declined from 92
to S77. The entire war division for
feited gains of 1 to 3 points, while
rails yielded 2 to 3 points. New mini

71 and Baltimore and Ohio preferred
at 55. v
Coppers, tlls and other semi-war

GRAIN MARKET UNSETTLED
CHICAGO, Dec. 4. President Wil
son's recommendation that immediate
war be declared on Austria Hungary
did not cause a ripple today in the
market here. His references in the
posed new price fixing led to some
seUing of corn in the last hour. Corn

day's finish to '4c higher, with Jan
uary $1.20 an May $1.1S. Oafs
gained to lc net. Provisions un
derwent a setback of 27 to 65c.
At first the corn market showed a
somewhat upward bent. An advance
seascn counted as a stimulus.
Oats bulged sharply, owing to pro
nounced scarcity of offerings during
the last two days.
Announcement o( trade restrictions

NEW YORK, Dec. 4. While there
have been some suggestions' in the
press to the effect that a declaration
of war on Austria, would be advocated,
nevertheless, the suggestions of the
chief executive in connection with
this caused quite a little surprise and
induced hasty realizing in a degree
that taxed the absorptive powers of
the market. Consequently declines
were general and much uncertainty
existed at the close. Overnight re
flections and considering the presi
dent's message will be quite essentia
and perhaps produce a calmer feeling,
as the situation generally does not
appear to have been complicated in
a degree that would warrant the ex
pectancy of renewal of drastic liqui
dation. Quite on the contrary, it would
seem to appear that legislative ac
tivities, more especially with respect
to the taxation program, are likely to
be more constructive than during the
last session of congress, primarily for
the reason that signs are not lacking
of a tendency to amend the tax pro
posals in a way that will be less
harsh to many corporations. While
indeed by the usual standards there
is little doubt as to the attractiveness
of securities from the viewpoint of
merit StilL under existing conditions
irregular movements are to be ex
pected. Consequently long lines
should be amply safe guarded and
kept in conservative bounds.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
ST. PAUL, .Dec. 4. Eleven com

' The order calling the mome guards

General Rhineow. In all 1500 men will
be on guard duty here tomorrow.
Decision to add to the home guard

NightSchoolNotes
The time of meeting of the book
keeping class in the night school at
the high scho'ol has been changed so
that ii now meets on Wednesday for
two periods, from 7:20 to 9 o'clock,
and during the corresponding periods
in the afternoon.
The "20th Century Text," which is
the basis of instruction, is practically
the only system in which the trans
actions, as well as the business papers
illustrating them, are identical with
those in the business world. By bring
ing the student in contact with actual
business papers, such as drafts, in
voices, bills of lading, etc.. a great deal
is done to overcome the shock oftn
attending the transition from the
school ioom to the business office.

GREAT FILM TODAY
"Draft 258," which starts a two-day
run at the Eagle today, is a photo
drama that will make America dearer
to every one of its citizens. It is the
story of a typical American family.
Mary Alden, a shop-girl, tells her
sweetheart she will marry him when
he co m to her in a uniform, and he
happily complies with her request.
One jf her brothers, Mat'-hew, is a so
cialist, and German agents use him as
their tool before he realizes their true
motives. Mary is a genuine torch of
patriotism, inspiring , many to give
both themselves ana tneir money to
the service of the government. Mary
is abducted by German agents and
placed in an aeroplane factory which
they are about to blow up. The cli
max is exciting in the extreme, ana
the production gi'ows with patriotism
and devotion to the nation.

A Logical Prediction
The Jerome Verde Copper News, in its Issue of November 29th,
under the heading "OUR OIL FIELD," prints the forlowlng:
"Practically the last doubt that the Chino Valley field Is to be
drilled for oil at an early date ha been removed. Several of the
companies formed to exploit the field are financed to the point
where they are justified in putting up derricks and ordering rigs.
The interest-that it being taken in Jerome, Phoenix, and elsewhere
In Arizona will make it easy for these companies to go right ahead
and put down well without delay.
"Therefore we can loo.k forward to and prepare for one of th
biggest oil boom In history. The new field 1 right at Jerome'
door and If the peoole of this camp fail to participate in the
enormous fortune that are almost certain to be made it will be
their own fault.
"Little doubt exist that the companie which drill properly
In the Chino field will get oil in commercial quantities. In fact,
the chance are that they will get oil in greater quantities than It
ha ever been found elsewhere, for nowhere ele is there such a
bed of oil sand as the original well of the Chino Valley Oil Com
pany penetrated.
"Chino Valley is not in the position of the ordinary unexplored
field. It is pretty nearly proven already. Not one geologist or
practical oil man who has looked over the valley has turned it
down. On the contrary, every one of them has endorsed it en
thusiastically. "Morevoer, oil has actually been founJ oil with gas pressure
so strong as to force it up through a 1900-foot column of water.
"The wonder is that Chino Valley has not been exploited before,
that it is not today one of the greatest producing oil fields in th
world. But we here on the ground who are In a position to partici
pate in the profits just ahead are not going to cry about past
neglect."
The Jerome Verde Copper News is, you might say, "on th
ground." They are In a position to know what can be expected
in the new CHINO VALLT DISTRICT. And they are not given
to making rash, predictions.
The United Chino Oil & Refining Company, owning outright
960 acres of chosen ground in the Chino Valley, is offering its is
sue direct, under permit from the Arizona f rporation Commission
which reads that at least 60 per cent of the money YOU PAY
shall be used In ACTUALLY DEVELOPING THE PROPERTY, and

ACTUALLY SEARCHING FOR OIL.
And Jack Bolin. George MacBean and Frank Brown will see

Now js the time to come in for a few dollars now is the time
to take a "chance and help explore the Chino Valley. It is the
pioneer who always reaps the rich returns in the, Oil Industry
and if you come in with the right kind of people, who will use your .
money for development in the right way, you stand a good chance '

British cavalry on the western front
and Italian mobile anti-aircraft
gun guarding Venice.
Recent dispatches have told of
cavalry activity on the western f i ont
and anti-aircraft activity in the vi
cinity of Venice. Photos show these
two agencies in action. It is consid
ered unlikely that cavalry will play
much of a part in the" battles to ci.me
oa the western front, at least not
before demoralization sets in among
the Germans. The gun shown in the
lower photograph has been very suc
cessful in keeping German fliers
awayfrora Venice. It is mounted on
a truck which can take the gun to
the scene of activity where tt is n, jst
needed. ... ...
