LOS ANGELES, Aug. 25. Eugene
S. Ives, general counsel for the
Southern Pacific Company of Mex
ico, and for many years a practicing
attorney of Tucson, Ariz., died sud
denly today at Mist, Cal.
Word of his death was received by
W. J. Duran, an official of the Union
Pacific company. Mr. Ives had gone
to Mist to oin relatives for a trip
through the Yosemite valley.
Bom in Washington
Eugene S. Ives was one of Ari
zona's most distinguished residents.
He was bron In Washington, D. C,
November 11, 1859. He attended the
public schools of the capital city and
graduated from Georgetown college
in 1S78. He afterward studied Id
Austria and France, holding many
degrees from various educational in
stitutions, one of them being Columbia.
Prominent In East
Ives practiced law In the state of
New York until 1895. While a resi
dent of the empire state he was a
member of the state senate. In 1S95
he moved to Tucson and has since
made Arizona hi shome. For years
he has been the attorney for the
Southern Pacific and has been look
ed upon as one of the most success
ful lawyers in the southwest. "
President of Council
In territorial days Ives was a mem
ber of the council and, on each oc
casion, was its presiding officer. In
the primaries in 1911 he ran against
Senator Mark Smith. Senator Henry
F. Ashurst and the late Reese M.
Ling for the Democratic nomination
for the United States senate.

He has always been associated
wh the Democratic party and was
looked upon as a leader in its ranks,
He came into much prominence last

governorship. Though he (has not
been actively engaged in preparing
the brief on which the case has been
submitted to the supreme court, on
appeal from the Maricopa county su

have been the head of the former

told of the problems that confronted
those who were dealing with the sub
ject and asked their co-operation in
the work to be done. He objected to
the word "control" in connection with
food conservation, he said, because th
administration, in the main, wished
to rely on voluntary effort and patriot
ic co-operation. '
All sections of the country were rep
resented at the conference. Mr. Hoov
er reached the city at mid-afternoon
and after the conference adjourned
at the dinner honr, announced he
would return east within several
hours.
Fair Deal Promised
Mr. Hoover made it clear In a state
ment which he authorized later, that
the purpose was to deal as fairly with
all interests as was possible, and that
in order that this intention might be
come a fact it was essential that all
should act in a similar spirit.
Opinion Wat Wrong
K. T. Meredith of Des Moines. Ia..
who presided at the meeting, said
when he went to Washington recent
ly to confer wtih Mr. Hoover he car
ried the word that the farmers of th
west were "against Hoover" because
of the fear that they would suffer
through price regulation. He said he
had found out that this impression
was "all wrong; that the food admin
istrator Intended to protect the far
mer against a lower price than was
his due." Mr. Meredith said he be
lieved the price as eventually fixed
would be a protection to the producer
against a low price and the consumer
against a high figure. Short! yafter
the arrival of Mr. Hoover a meeting
was held at the stockyards, attended
by representatives of the packers, the
railroads and the livestock commis
sion men of the middle west, the pur
pose being to work out a plan for a
co-operation of these interests with
Mr. Hoover and the federal trade com
mission. For Even Distribution
The conference Is said to have ar
ranged for appointment of joint com
mittees of all interests involved to se
cure even distribution of shipments of
livestock into the Chicago market so
theer will be no "light" and "heavy
days. It is believed this arrangement
will lead to the establishment of a per
manent "five-day market."
Denies Pric eFixing
In a statement Issued tonight Mr.
Hoover denied there is any founda
tion for a statement that the food ad
ministration expects to fix prices of
beef or pork products.
Before Mr. Hoover left Chicago he
was handed a formal request from
the packers that he appoint a federal
administrator immediately to tak
over entire control of the livestock In
dustry. Producer' Committees
The administration hopes to devel
op by discussion with representative
committees of the hog producers, the
cattle producers, the commission men
and the packers, the statement says,
greater stabilization of the industry
during the war and in such a way to
encourage production, to eliminate
speculative profits and risks so far as
may be. and by so doing to protect
the consumer.
Hoover's Resume
Mr. Hoover's address before the 125
representatives of farm ournals in 24
states, said to represent an approxi
mate circulation of 12.000.000 readers,
was a resume of conditions which lead
to the appotntment of a food control
ler, which comments on the adminis
tration of that office. He asserted at
the outset that the food problems ot
the present would have occurred
whether or not the United States went
into the war; that they are "based on

disturbance of economic forces."
- Shortage in Europe
The shortage in European produc
tion of foodstuffs caused by the diver
sion of millions of men fro mtheir pro
ductive labor to war and the deplet
ed soil has thrown upon this nation
the responsibility of increasing its ex
ports of both wheat and meat. This
condition must be met by turning "the
face of our agriculture toward decreas
ed production of animal food and ul
timate decrease of our export of bread
and fodder grain," a situation that will
arise when "it becomes more logical
for our allies to kill and eat their ani
mals and depend upon us to replace
their animal food, than It is to import
fodder in hope of maintaining their
animals."
Speculation Condemned
Speaking of speculation and "an
unnecessarily higher cost of living in
our industrial centers," Mr. Hoover as
serted that "no one has yet refuted
the fact that our farmers last year
"received under $1.50 per bushel for
their 'wheat but our consuming popu
lation brought their flour based on
over $2.50 wheat for a large part of
the year." A remedy for "these evils"
must be sought, he said, "if we are to
protect our people and maintain our
efficiency in the war."
Shortage of Bottoms
Shortages in overseas transporta
tion of foodstuffs have brought im
port problems to the United States
which cause a diminution in the con
sumption of certain products sugar
and vegetable oils, for instance. Mr.
Hoover asserted vast uantities of cer
tain foods are now being stored in
foreign ports awaiting a return of
peace.
Australian Wheat
"It Is worthy of consideration," he
said, "that by the first of January
there will be 300,000,000 bushels of
wheat in Australia awaiting market
and another 100,000,000 bushels in
India, not now available to our allies.
If peace were to come or if the sub
marine were to be overcome there
would be longer a shortage in the
world's wheat supply, but there would
be an overstock. We have placed an
embargo upon the shipment of food
and other commodities from the coun
try because, if we allow an unlimited
drain on our supplies, we will face an
absolute shortage next spring."
In reviewing the conditions that
lead to the establishing of a com mi s
- sion to fix the price of wheat for the
year, Mr. Hoover urged:
Must Eliminate Gambler
"We should organize the distribu
tion of our wheat and flour so that
the speculator has no door, nor even
a crack, through which he may enter."
Mr. Hoover concluded by asking for
co-operation on the part of the editors.
"The food administration muBt be
the combined work of thousands," be
declared. "It is beyond any one man."
next week. Probably Garfield devoted
some time to the situation today and
called into conference Frances S. Pea
boby, chairman of the coal commit
tee of the national council of defense
and George Otis Smith, chief of the
geological survey.
The federal trade commission is
working on a scale of profits for retail
coal dealers which it will submit to
Dr. Garfield. Indications are that re
tail prices will be fixed to complete
the government's control of the coal
industry, already put into operation
with the fixing of mine and wholesale
prices.
Regulation of the production and
ditsribution of crude oil and its prod;
ucts under the food control awl was
predicted tonight.
Although the government has no
power to fix a scale of prices for oils
it can reuire that the industry oper
ate under a licensing system and this,
officials said, probably will be put
into effect.

DENIES HOOVER ATTEMPTS
TO INFLUENCE PRICES
WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. The food
administration today denied reports
that Herbert C. Hoover is attempting
to influence the price-fixing commit
tee. Leaded by Dr. H. A. Garfield, to
put a price of $1.65 on the 1917 crop
of wheat, and gave out copies of a
telegram sent by Mr. Hoover to a
North Dakota newspaper, which de
clared the food administrator was of
fering no suggestions as to the price.
Replies to Congressman
Mr. Hoover's telegram was in reply
to one from Representative Young of
North Dakota, which concludes:
"Anything we get about $1.65 a bushel
will be on account of clenched fists
shaken in the faces of Garfield and
Hoover."
Mr. Hoover's message declared the
farming interests have a majority rep
resentation on the prce-fixing commit
tee and that its membership is made
up of men in whom the whole country
has confidence.
No Speculative Profits
"My duty is simply to see," said
Mr. Hoover, "that the farmer receives
a fair price, whatever that may be,
and to see that the consumer obtains
hig bread without speculative profits
in between the farmer and the con
sumer which were maintained ov-r
the first half of this year. I assume
that the farmer no more wants to
bleed the consumer by obtaining more
than a fair price than he wants to be
bled by the producers of food and oth
er commodities who also are being
asked to maintain fair prices."
Will Recommend Price
The Garfield committee, it is under
stood, will be ready to recommend a
price by the middle of next week.
Rumor puts this price at slightly
more than $2.
Wheat prices were discussed today
in the senate. Senator Gronna de
clared that government control would
have a ruinous effect on production
and instead of stimulating would re
strict It.
COAL MINE REGULATIONS
WILL BE ISSUED VERY SOON
WASHINGTON. Aug. 25.--Regulations
to govern the opera fion of coal
mines will be issued by Dr. 1L A. Gar
field, the fuel administrator, probably
many cases within the age limits fix
ed by law of men who are married and
yet whose accumulations or other eco
nomic surroundings are such that no
dependency of the wife exists in fact.
Plainly, the law does not contemplate
exemption for this class of men.
Can Not Bs Abrogated.
" "Th eregulations promulgated on
June 30, 1917, should be regarded as
controlling in these cases, and the or
ders issued under that regulation di
recting exemption boards to establish
the fact of dependents in addition to
the fact of marriage ought not to be
abrogated.'
Partial Support,
"The attention of this office has
been invited to the fact that, in a few
instances, local boards have certified
to district boards as held for military
service, men whose families are actu
ally depednent upon them for support
on the theory that the wife is able to
work and should be put to the necessi
ty of going to work to support her
self and children. This situation is
expressed in the following opinion of
the district board of New York City,
in which opinion this office concurs,
with the understanding that the
phrase 'support available for relatives'
is support partial or total previously
extended to the applicant himself.
Wholly Dependent.
" "We dp not cocur in the view sug
gested in some quarters that in case
of wife and childre nactually depend
ent on applicant's labor for support,
and where there are no other means
of support, the wife should be put to
the necessity of going to work to sup
port herself and children. Bona fide
dependency of wife and children on
labor of applicant where in bis ab
sence they will be left without reason
ably adequate support, after duly tak
ing into consideration soldiers' wages
and the support available from rela
tives, as stated in the ruling of the
provost-marshal general is ground of
discharge.' "
This opinion clearly and adequately
expresses the intent of the law in this
regard.
Compiled Rulings.
"Paragraph B, compiled rulings of
this office No'. 6, addressed a state of
affairs where the parents or other rela
tives of the wife or husband are able,
ready and willing adequately to sup
port the wife and children, if any, dur
ing the absence of the husband. This
ruling was responsive to a class of
cases that had been brought to the at
tention of this office where claims of
discharge had been made on the
ground of dependency of a husband,
who, as a matter of fact, was not de
pendent upon himself. The ruling
directed the attention of local boards
to the fact that scrutiny of cases of
this kind might disclose that no dis
charge was advisable.
Exceptions.
"It was not intended that para
graph B, of the compiled rulings
should apply to the case of the head of
a family whose family, at the time of
his summons and prior thereto, were
and had been mainly dependent upon
his labor for support. V
Errors Rare.
"Instances in which local boards
have been in error in respect of these
two classes of cases are rare. It was
to be expected that with some 4,500
boards there would be some un-unifor-mity
of decis'on in this regard. To
provide against this un-uniformity, sec
tion 27 of the regulations provides for
the automatic appeal of all depend
ency cases to the district boards. Dis
trict boardshould scan the decisions
of local boards on, the subject of de
pendency and wherever it appears that
such derisions are Illegal (as In the
two rases mentioned or otherwise) or
where there does not seem to be a uni
form ruling the district boird should
reverse or modify the decision of ttie
local board."

In his message to governors respect
ing new mobilization orders. General
Crowder said:
Five Percent First
"The congestion of traffic that will
be ntailed in the early part of Sep
tember by the movement of the na
tional guard into training camps
makes it inadvisable to attempt to
move any larpc perc-nlase of the na
tional army on September filth. For
thin reason the war department has
communicated the following schedule
of movements of the national army to
the provost-marshal general: Five
perectn of the quota of each state be
ginning September filth, forty percent
beg ning September I9tu. forty pei
cent beginning October third; the re
maining fifteen per cent as soon there
after as practicable.
Plans Changed.
"The object of calling five per cent
Is to place in the camps enoiish men
:o form a skeleton organization to as
sist in receiving and assimilating the
large cont ngents. For this reason
it is required that local boards send
inly white nun and so far as practic
able that they send men with some
military experUuce or cooks. In mak
ing this selection order numbers are
not controlling but great care must be
tpVeii not to send men whui-e order ol
call is so late that they will not he
within the quota of the hoard. The
"arelul selection of these men will he
of Kreat assistance to the orderly or
ganization of the national army and it
is hoped that local boards will act
withthis end in view.
One Percent Per Day. '
"'n order that i: may not ie neces
sary to make any special railway ar
raucements and to prevent a conges
tion of normal railway tradic local
hoards should be instructed to send
proximately one per cent of their
luotas on each of five successive days
beginning September tiPh. It
thought that eery buard in the coun

per cent of its quota by September

Dear Sir: In reading the locals of

Joseph Halcro and his partners were
beat out of this mine by Marcus A.
Herring (Old Kentuck) arid George
Eddleman who jumped the mine on th

the Copper Queen Mine. The mine has
been known ever since that tin w all

Mine 'of Bisbee; Arizona. In 1879 Mark
Herring gave George Kline and Char

the mine for doing the assessment

NO TRACE FOUND
Deputy Sheriff William Brakfield re
turned late last evening from the Hua
chucas, where he went to investigate
the shooting of Jack Ashworth and Jo
seps Halcro. He was able to get a
fairly good description of the Mexican
but was unable to get any trace of his
movements. It is more than probable
that he made his escape through the
mountains to Mexico. Ashworth and
Halcro are both recovering from the
effects of their wounds and neither
will suffer any serious results.

iE
Fred H. Moore, Who Is Ex
pected to Visit the Warren
District in Next Few Days,
Defendent in Los Angeles
Court
Fred H. Moore, I. W. W. attorney,
who is contemplating a visit to the
Warren district in the interests of the
deported men now located at Colum
bus, has been sued, in the Los Ange-
les courts, for divorce.
Moore is
charged with desertion. j
The Los Angeles Times or Friday!
printed the following regarding the j
filing of the complaint:
'Fred H. Moore, an attorney who.
it is alleged, was deported from BU
Ariz., at the time of the recent
I. W. W. trouble because of his activi
ties In defense of the strikers, was
yesterday afternoon made defendant
in a divorce suit filed by Mrs. Moore,
through her attorneys. Neighbors,
Hoag & Burke.
"There whereabouts of Mr. Moore
at this time are unknown, althougii
he is believed to be in Phoenix. Mrs.
Moore bases her suit upon alleged de
sertion. She says that what money he
has sent during the past year has not
gone far toward supporting her and
their three-year-old child.
"According to reports, Mr. Moore
has been giving a great deal of his
time to the defense of I. W. W.'s. He
represented them at San Diego and,

Moore alleged she received less than
$100 of that fee."

Sunday Morning, August 26, 1917.
The twenty-dollar hog has arrived. He wears a gold
collar and has his tail tied with a pink ribbon and his
feet are manicured by an artist. He Is arrogant, too.
He won't look at a poor man. Boy, page Mr. Hoover!
Los Angeles has an octogenarian club. Seven spright
ly and young old men compose its membership, and they
met the other day and had a dandy time. Their com
bined age totals 606 years. These 86-year-old youngsters,
with their picnic parties and their cheerful smiles and
their "pep" and optimism, put to shame many young
men who frown and grouch around and complain of their
petty ills of the flesH and of the spirit
And now cometh Fred Moore, an alleged attorney
with I. W. W. leanings and emoluments, to investigate us.
We have been investigated quite a considerable bit lately.
First came a federal investigator, then the attorney gen
eral of the state, and then the governor. All reports up
to this time were satisfactory. Wonder what Moore's
report will be? Wonder who's coming next? It's all
right, though. We are as square as a die here and as
straight as a French seventy-five gunner's aim.
Here is a pleasant little joke plucked out of all this
grim business of war: German papers now announce that
their government views the pope's peace proposals with
suspicion and is inclined to believe they eminated from
England. They fear that the pope has become a party
to English intrigue to cheat the kaiser out of his glorious
victories by a premature peace. The Prussian is a pon
derous joker when he does turn his heavy hand to that
sort of thing.
Lens is still holding out against the Canadians in
spite of their grand fighting abilities and the preponder.
ance of their artillery. But, lest any one be inclined to
underestimate the difficulty of the task set for our cousins
north of the Great Lakes region, it might be well to con
sider just what they hare to do. Lens, like Bisbee, is a
mining city. The fiercest fighting just now is in front
of the Grassier slag dump. Suppose an army should
advance from Lowell to take the Czar shaft. That is
about what the Canadians are up against right now. Con
sider the difficulties. The Germans are seventy feet
underground in some places. What effect would ordinary
artillery fire have upon the tunnels and passages under
the Czar? How many places are there between Lowell
and the Czar already provided for machine guns? Ima
gine two thousand of these weapons spouting bullets like
a fire hose does water from a hundred nests among the
slag heaps and at the mouth of the tunnels. But Lens'
fate is sealed. Foot by foot and house by house the Cana
dians are gathering it in. Its capture means fuel for
France next winter and a corresponding shortage of fuel
for Germany and it must be taken at any cost
Austrian airmen spent all of the first two weeks in
August dropping messages into the Italian lines which
appealed to their "dear karoarades not to fight." Lot of
gasoline and effort wasted here. The Italian reply was
the most intense bombardment and the fiercest drive of
all the war on thfs front. But there is a significance in
these efforts of the central powers to seduce Russia and
Italy by fair words Bad indeed must be the militarv
condition of the proud Teutons when they resort to plead
ings and subterfuge against their enemies.
Estimates now are for thirty billions for the cost of
the war for America, ten billions of which goes to our
allies. Further estimates on the cost in pensions to the
wounded and to the dependents of American soldiers kill
ed in battle are based upon the assumption that we will
lose 76,000 men in Europe the first year of the war and
317,000 the next. We will have two million men under
arms. Therefore, It is calculated that eighty out of every
one hundred will come safely through the storm of death.
These estimates are based upon the experience of France
and England during the first three years of battling on
the western front.
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON
"But the Lord said unto Samuel, look not on his
countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I
have refused him; for the Lord seeth not as man sceth,
for men looketh on the outward appearance, but the
Lord looketh on the heart" I Samuel, 16-7.
Even Samuel, chosen prophet of the Lord, was prone
to judge by appearances. It is a common failing of all
mankind, and has been ever since Adam's oldest son
went into the Land of Nod and chose a wife. We choose
the big red apple when the small yellow one is always
the sweetest We choose the halls of marble and of
power rather than the sweet simplicity of the garden.
If a man puts on a bold front if he talks loudly and
at length, if his clothes are cut in the latest pattern and
are of the most 'costly weave, we open the door with
v
many a genuflection and bid bim enter.
If a woman has a majestic figure and Grecian features
and a large hat and a flowing robe of silk we follow in
her train.
The brindle fringe and gold braid and bright colors
and gorgeous plumage and square yards of displacement
seem to have a fatal fascination for us when we make our
first estimates of friend and foe.
We judge a man's fighting qualities by his size and
a woman's true value by her beauty. We judge a man'j
religion by the length of his face and the sanctity of his
expression. Always we judge by appearances.
By outward seeming are we led, on and on, and our
feet are bruised by the rocks of reality and we fall into
many a pit, and in the end we are almost undone.
When the prophet Samuel was called upon to choose
the first king of Israel he annointed Saul of the tribe of
Benjamin, a man who stood head and shoulders above
his fellows; a kingly man, majestic, comely and strong.
Surely here wag a king, a man among a million, argued
Samuel, happy in his choice of a ruler for his beloved
people.
But Saul had an imperious heart and a stormy soul,
and in the end the Lord God refused him. Then the Lord
called upon Samuel to go forth and choose another king
for his people, and this time the Lord designated David,
the shepherd boy, a mere stripling, with a mild eye and
a modest brow and a harp in his hand. And this gentle,
humble, kind hearted youth became the most successful
warrior and the greatest king that Israel ever knew In
all the years of her glory, her grandeur and her woe.
"Man looketh on the outward appearance,' but the
Lord looketh on the heart" We choose a wife for her
beauty and not for her steadfastness and her patience and
her disposition and her understanding and her greatness
of soul. And then we wonder why we are so un'iappy.
We choose a friend for his pomp and circumstance
and his flow of conversation and his promises and tho
regularity with which he drinks from the glass of fash
ion. And then we wonder why he fails us when the wind
of adversity blows and the storm of trouble sweeps the
flowers from our path.
We choose a business partner, a manager, a clerk,
a workman, by bis outward limbs and flourishes. And
then we wonder why he always falters in a pinch and
errs in the most important things and fails to answer
"aye" to the roll call when the crisis comes.
Napoleon was a little man, but he was the greatest
leader of fighting men that this world has ever known.
And the marshals he selected to lead his armies were
not imposing-looking men, nor were they the sons of the
rich and the great of his land. Rather, they were of
the most humble origin. Ney, the bravest of the brave,
was an innkeeper's son. Massena was angular and
scrawny and had a mild face and a homely one. But he
was a tactician par excellence and the emperor never
called upon him in vain.
The Savior of the world was a Carpenter's Son. He
was of lowly origin and mild demeanor. For his immoi
tals he selected fishermen and peasants, even as His
Father before him had selected His prophets. The out
ward appearance of these men was not impressive, they
had neither wealth nor earthly power, but their hearts
were of pure gold. They defied the imprisonment and tor
ture of kings and suffered death for the Cause. The all
seeing Eye had judged these men aright. They failed Him
not
Why, oh why, are we always excited and misled by
appearances. We know that still waters run deep. We
know that a brave heart beats oftenest in a frail body
and that an indomitable spirit shines behind a modest
and retiring exterior. The bluster and brag and boasting
and beauty and brazen trappings of the undependable
man, and the sweet smile and silk sash and silver orna
ments of the undependable woman have beguiled man
kind Into looking at outward appearances ever since
Noah's three sons left the ark.
The peacock struts in the sunlight and the nightin
gale hides in the ticket, but WHICH HAS THE SWEET

The war has created a new and fas
cinating art, developed apparently by
the French and practiced by them and
the .British with conspicuous success
They call it "camouflage.? Its the art.
of deception for purposes of conceal1
ment from the enemy.
A battery of guns Is docked out with
branches to make it look like a clump
of underbrush. A "tank" is painted
mud color to make it indistinguishable
from the soil it crawls over. Tents
are smealed in all sorts of outlandish
hues to make them blend with the land
scape like natural objects. Soldiers'
uniforms are colored to suit the par
ticular work they are engaged in, by
I day or night, according to the light,
the weather conditions, the soil anl
the vegetation. Airplanes are made
to blend with the sky and clouds, boats
and ships to blend with the water.
It isn't really a new thing, thoueh
its military use is a novelty. The bird
have been practicing camouflage for
countless ages, suiting their color to
their environment to escape detection
by their foes. Sometimes they do it
by blending into the color of bark,
leaves, plants, grass or soil, and some-

ent: Except for the telephonist, who
was crouching at the entrance of the
dugout, receivers over his ears and
the telephone in his hands, we all
stood breast deep in the trench, peer
ing through glasses. The captain said:
"Do you see that half plucked wood
on the horizon? There is one tree, to
ward the middle of it, taller than' the
others. Follow it down toward the
trenches until you come to a sort of
grayish spot in the fields. That is a
big German shelter. I was up near
there myself yesterday to have a look
at close quarters before doing this
work today. I am going to regulate
first on that shelter."
In the orders that followed the cap
tain used several technical words.
"Plus" means to lengthen the range
and "less" to shorten by a given num
ber of yards. "Augment" means toH
fire more to the right and "diminish"
more to the left, by a given number
of degrees on the sighting apparatus
of the gun. The "elements" are in the
various figures registered on the gun's
sighting apparatus when the shot is
fired. A "piece" is a gun.
"First piece," commanded the cap
tain. "Direction, shelter. Five thou
sand yards."
"First piece," repeated the telephon
ist into the instrument "Direction,
shelter. Five thousand yards."
I knew that somewhere in the thick
et, half a mile back, men were point
ing a cannon at a mark they could not
see. But for my part I could not take
my gaze from that gray spot near the
horizon. It seemed impossible that
we, three miles away, should be able
to bit that tiny mark.
"Ready!" said the captain.
"Ready!" repeated the telephonist
"Fire!"
"Fire!"
There was a loud explosion, a shell
whirred over my head. I gazed breath
less. A long time seemed to elapse.
Then a black geyser as high as a tree
spouted up somewhere behind and to
the left of the far gray spot I knew
It was behind only because the spot
was not veiled by the smoke. With
one is shooting at a mark at ones own
level three miles away accurate obser
vation is not easy.
"Long," said the lieutenant
"Less 25, augment by 1," the captain
ordered.
"Less 25, augment by 1," echoed the
telephonist. 1
"Ready Fire."
The geyser in the distant field
sprang this time directly in line with
the gray spot, but well behind it
Same elements," ordered the cap
tain. "Less 25. Ready Fire."
"Still long," said the lieutenant
"The devid," said the captain. "Same
elements. Less 25. Fire."
Ah! The geyser sprang full In the
center of the gray spot. The captain
grinned at me.
"Inscribe the elements," he ordered.
"Inscribe the elements," repeated
the telephonist
Back in the battery, some one was
writing on a chart the figures which
would enable the gun to repeat exactly
that shot at any time.
German Prisoners After
The Deluge of Shells
Says a correspondent, writing of
German prisoners after the recent
drive in Flanders: I saw this morn
ing great numbers of the prisoness ta
ken during the last 24 hours and just
brought In. They had the look of men
who had been through hell. They were
drenched with rain which poured
down their big steel helmets. Their
top boots were full of water, which
squelched out at every step, and their
sunken eyes stared out of ash-gray
faces with the look of sick and hunted
animals. Many of them had cramp in
the stomach through their long expos
ure and hunger before being captured
and they groaned loudly. Many of
them wept while being interrogated,
protesting bitterly that they hated war
and wanted nothing but peace. They
have no hope of victory for their coun
try, and the advance into Russia fills
them with no new illusion, but seems
to them only a lengthening of the gen
eral misery. They do not hide the suf
ferings of their people at home and
say that in the towns there Is bitter
want and only in the rural districts
is there enough to eat In the field.

the prayer of the newspaper man.
Many people for many years have
prated of the flivver. While admitting
that it was not built for either beauty,
room or speed, yet they have always
stoutly maintained that its engine
would run when all other engines were
stalled in their stalls. "The little old
flivver rambled rings along." that was
the burden of their song.
But the newspaper man has a fliv
ver that will not run. Otherwise it
is all right
Tis a sad tale, mates:
The newspaper man started out the
'other evening with his family to go
to Naco in the flivver to hear the
band play and witness the last grand
review of the First Arizona. The fllv-
dous British gunfire. The older men
and non-commissioned officers who
have come back after receiving
wounds and other soldiers of long
training say that the boys of the young
classes who are now filling up the
ranks have no staying power under
shell fire and no fighting spirit.
Among the prisoners whom I saw
today I think about a quarter of them
or perhaps a little fewer, were these
young boys, anaemic-looking lads with
terror in their eyes. Others were more
hardy looking men, though pale and
worn. It is certain that they made no
great fight yesterday when the allies
were near them, except when they still
had cover in concrete emplacements,
and it is no wonder that all fight had
gone out of them.
Men We Have Met
Camouflage, An Art Devel
oped from War's Horrors
The Hindsighted man, who never
sees an opportunity until it is too late.
The Backboneless man, who always
has to ask advice of some one and
generally some one who doesn't know
The only Honest man, who must con
trol no one else honest enough to
take things in hand.
The Spendthrift, who never has any

Biggest Locomotive
In the World
The greatest steam locomotive in
the world ha,s been put into service by
the Baldwin Locomotive works. It is
so gigantic that its boiler had to be
made flexible at three different joints
so that the locomotive could turn
around a curve. It is over 100 feet
long and weighs some 420 tons.
Twenty-four driving wheels, each
standing as high as an average size
man, affords its traction. The driv
ing wheels are distributed along the
length of the locomotive in sets of
four pairs, the wheels of each set be
ing coupled together and driven by
two giant steam cylinders. Under full
s tea oi, the locomotive can exert an
83-ton pull on the cars behind it
which means that it can easily haul
a freight train two miles long and
23,000 tons in weight over an ordinary
good roadbed at an average rate of
about 14 miles an hour and possibly
more.

MY URGE
Written for The Review by a Bisbee Subscriber.
To me, those hills, rock-ribbed and bare,
Holding the valley in calm security,
Are more than guards
They are silent, majestic symbols
Of untold wealth held firmly within their folds;
That valley, like a bowl,
Oblivious to the life that springs within it,
Is more than human shelter
It is a time-worn reproduction "
Of the palm of Him who made it ;
Those houses, perched upon the very brink,
In unfair contrast with the crag on which they set,
Aer more than homes for those who toil
They are the chrysalis of a mighty city,
Which will case them off tomorrow.
Wtih this vision as my urge,
I will take the tools of my calling and work,
That he who comes after may know
Of him who went before.

The letter follows, in part:

clerks in that city were too timid and
were not allowed to start one. My
men succeeded and the organization
was started, and the hours' of labor
reduced. That union, I believe, is in
existence today.

LISTEN TO DAD
Listen to dad, young fellow. He
knows a whole lot more than you
think he does. He's been through the
mill the same mill through which
you will have to pass. He isn't an
old fogey or a crank, as you may sup
pose; he knows a lot of things ha
hasn't told you, and he is trying to
swerve you around the corners so you
will escape some of the rocks that he
ran upon when he was just about
your age.
Dad isn't asking you to do anything
to punish you. His requests are not
made because he doesn't want you to
have a good time, and be like other
boys. Dad is just as much interested
in your pleasure and your success In
1 fe as you are. Hut because he can
see a little farther ahead than you can,
because he knows the results of cer
tain things, because he is patient and
takes the time to study out exactly
what will follow a certain course of
conduct, you may imagine that he is
standing in your way. Don't get that
into your head. boy.
Hear this: There isn't a failure In
the world today who took dad's advice, i
And there isn't a successful man in
the world who doesn't owe a part of
that success to the 'nteresi somebody j
else a dad or a friend took in him.
Listen to dad, kid. A father is the ,
biggest asset any boy ever had. ex-:
cept his mother. If he were to die
tonight and leave you the whole world ;
lor your very own, you would be poor
er than you are now, with dad living.
You are farther advanced than dad
was at your at;e; you arc farther
along than dad is at this time: you do'
not know more than he knows now. So '

Great American People
AN ATLANTIC PORT, Aug. 25.
America's war zone begins at a spiked :
Iron picket fence, skirting a water (

town.
On -one side ot that fence movie
shows with gaudy posters, peaceful
groceries, motherly housewives doing'
the marketing, women in bright, sum-!
mery clothes wheeling baby buggies.!
And on the other side vast fields of !
parked artillery caissons, grimly)
shrouded cannon, their snouts pointing '
skyward; ambulances, military motors,
swarming men in khaki, a gray atmos
phere of war. This was the picture
unfolded on a trip to the unnamed
port.
The Fence a "Dead Line"
Sentries march up and down, out
side the picket fence. One half the
street belongs to the town, the other
half to Uncle Sam, and those who try
to cross to the forbidden sidewalk on
Uncle Sam's side find cold steel threat
ening their vitals.
Once beyond the guarded gates the
civilian who is permitted to pass, if
armed with the necessary magic paper,
finds himself in the midst of militar
ism. A silent soldier with a big auto
matic banging at his hip is always just
two paces behind him.
He sees a row of huge warehouses,
piled to the lofty roofs with mountains
of boxes labeled "hard bread,"
"beans," "soap." Those boxes will be
opened in France. He sees a great
courtyard crammed full of machinery,
all painted battleship gray. In perfect
order, each pile numbered, he beholds
thousands upon thousands of tent
poles, tent stakes, tent flooring and
canvasses.
Transports at the Pier
There are the rank's of army wag
o:ih ai'.u khaki tops like those of old
piairie schooners, ambulances with
stretchers swung from their roefs, bat
talions and motor trucks, supplies of
e7ery conceivable kind.
In a small open spai-e on-j company
had hung its wash khaki shirts flap
ped in the breeze. At another place
a long file of men, armed with the cups
and plates, marched past the cook.
Occasionally a whistle shrilled orders.
Transports lay at their piers ready
to carry this staggering conglomera
tion of men and materials across the
sea, where the hooded guns can flame
into life against the enemy and where
the men will await their turns to go
over the top.
On one transport the tailors bad
rigged a swing and were taking turns
in it, like schoolboys An officer walk

Mountains of Ammunition
Another officer stood at a window
and looked out over the scene at long
lines of men trundling crates marked
with the spread eagle, at intermniable
mountain ranges of munitions, steady
processions of heavily loaded motor
trucks, at the peaked roofs of this won
der city, at throngs of fighting men.
"And this," he said, "is only the be

The Wobbly to Old Bisbee
Will Never
By F.
In Bisbee 'bout a month ago they
staged a corking show,
'Twas when the Wobbly multitude was
. forced to pack and go.
When Wheeler and his deputies one
morn when it was dark.
Rounded up the Wobblies and march
ed them to the park.
Twelve hundred men who wouldn't
work were forced to get in line.
Twelve hundred men who used to
work in every Bisbee mine.
Twelve hundred men who'd threatened
the country1 near and far.
Were rounded up at Warren park and
loaded in a car.
A vicious looking lot were they, a
worthless, shiftless breed,
Who breathed of crime and treason,
in their dangerous Wobbly creed.
Men whose very presence was a men
ace to the place.
Men whose acts of treason threatened
Bisbee with disgrace.
They shipped them to Columbus town
and placed them in a camp,
Wabbly, rough-neck, hophead, bum and
vicious foreign tramp.
With their leader, William Cleary, the
bunch was very sore.
And when they were all settled they
started in to roar.
They roared about their treatment,
they swore they were abused.
Their families were starving and very
much ill used.
They telegraphed to Wilson, to Camp
bell and to Jones,
They hollered loud for sympathy, in
false and lying tones.
BIG CHRISTMAS
FOR ALL SERVICE
National Organization Has in
View a Big Celebration for
Every Soldier and Sailor on
December 25
The American Red Cross with its
three millions members has ju9t com
pleted plans for the Christmas Cheer
of every soldier and sailor in the na
tional service. Many of the men who
will be in the cantonments and trench
es this year will be spending thei
first Christmas away from home.
None will be forgotten.
Red Cross Chapters nearest the 32
army camps and cantonments will
probably arrange in their towns, com
munity Christmas tree3 with carols,
pageants and holiday movies to which
the 600,00 men in training will be in
vited. Arrangement of the details of the
Christmas celebration for our men in
France is being made, but the Red
Cross w ill see to it that every soldier
has his Christmas package with its
message of good will from the women
on the home side of the Atlantic.
There will be surprises in every pack
age, but all of them are likely to con
tain writing paper, pipes, tobacco, ci
gars and cigarettes, unbreakable mir
rors, puzzles, dominoes, handkerchiefs
and playing cards.
Many of the chapters are already at
work finishing their Christmas allot
ments of comfort bags. Most of them

with extra pairs ot woolen socks,
housewives with needles, pins, thread

how to wrap these Christmas pack
ages for shipping will be issued by the
Rtd Cross. The Red Cross will also'
welcome the co-operation of anyone
desiring to have a part in sending
Christmas Cheer to the men in train
ing or at the front. Some people will
want to give money to buy articles,
bags,' mouth organs, envelopes and
paper, safety razors, extra soap, ,
spoons and knives. Some will want
to have a personal part in tying up the
packages. Children will be asked to
help with the package making.
The gifts will be bought from con
tributions especially given for the
Christmas greeting. The Red Cross
war fund will not be used for this pur
pose. Last year the American Red Cross
sent presents of various kinds to the
men on the Mexican border, and the
marines at Haiti and San Domingo.
The articles were suggested by Gen
eral Pershing on the request of Red
Cross officials. Commenting on the
Red Cross Christmas gifts to the sol
diers, be said, "These things bring tha
soldier to remember that the people at
home are behind him. You do not
know how much that is going to mean
to us who are abroad. You do not
know how much that means to any
soldier who is over here' carrying the

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK, August 24. All other
considerations of a feverish week in
the stock market were subordinated to
conditions created by the government's
price:Gxing policy. Disappointment
at the cut in soft coal wag largely
counter-balanced, however, by the
more cheerful feei ng created by the
schedule for the antraclte product.
Action remains to be taken on such
important commodities as steel, iron,
copper and oils, all of which, especi
ally the latter, were much unsettled.
Declines in rails other than those of
the coal group, and in shippings, to
baccos and a future specialties were
sympathetic, with indication of sub
stantial support on the rebound.
Foreign conditions as exemplified by
the Russian situation were again a
drag. The loan of an additional hun
dred million dollars to the Russian
government was regarded as foreshad
owing furthere advances to other of
the entente allies.
Steady withdrawal of this country's
gold, mainly by Japan, gives emphasis
to reports that measures to restrict the
outflow may soon be necessary. It Is
realized, however, that a sudden halt
in this movement might seriously de
range the foreign exchange markets.

uncertainty in the Russian situation
and apprehension over the govern

NEW YORK MARKETS.
NEW YORK, August 25. With one
exception that of the previous week)
end today's brief period of trading on
the" stock exchange was the dullest of
the year, transactions falling to the
meagre total of 110,000 shares. '
Trading derived its sole support
from short covering on the more hope
ful views entertained respecting
Washington's attitude toward price
control.
Slight pressure upon metal stocks
and equipments represented nothing
of a tangible character and was more
than neutralized by firmness else
where. Dealings .in rails were light
but mainly at higher levels, with Rock
Island again the feature at extreme
gains of one to 'three points.
Competentent authorities issued en
couraging trade reports, although not
ing further caution pending adjust
ment of schedules by Washington;
Leading railways issued additional
favorable statements of earnings, At
chison reporting a net gain of $ 880,000
for July.
No features of especial interest were
presented by the bank statement.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, August 25. Trading in
wheat for future delivery ceased to
day on the board of trade until after
the war. . September, the sole remain
ing option, made a dignified exit from
the market at 211, which was Vt cent
below final figures yesterday. Corn
was subjected to selling pressure
throughout the season and closed
weak. 2 to 2 net lower, with De
cember at 107 to 107 and May at
105 to 105. Oats lost to 1 and
provisions had weak support and fin
ished from 50 to 1.10 lower. Settle
men prices for outstanding September
contracts will be fixed by a committee
appointed by the president of the
board today. September prices
through the session ranged between
213 and 210.
Unofficial reports current around the
wheat pit were that the government
price would be set at $2.10. Large de
liveries were looked for with the de
termination of the official price for
wheat under government control.
Higher corn prices expected by the
trade today because of the hint of
frost yesterday did not materialize.
Offerings of oats from local houses
were heavy and prices sagged with
com.
Provisions receded at the start on
stop loss selling. Further recessions
met only feeble rallies. Weakness of
live hog prices contributed to the
downward course of meat products.

WASHINGTON, Aug. 25. Prepara
tions made today by senate leaders for
next week's discussion of the war tax
bill presaged one of the most deter
mined and spectacular struggles of the
war session.
Amendment Certain.
The bill was not taken up today,
the senate recessing after a brief ses
sion until Monday for conferences of
those prominent in the .fight for and
against further increases. Material
amendment of the bill was regarded
as certain, with the amount of tax in
creases expected to be the crux of next
week's contest.
Postage Tax Over.
Consideration of the postage tax,
scheduled for today, went over until
Monday. By Wednesday these sec
tions, including the special income tax
on publishers and various proposals
tor increasing second-class mail rates
probably will be out of the way.
War Profits Next.
The war profits section of the bil,
Senator Simmons stated tonight, is to
follow the postage sections and on
Monday or as soon as possible there
after he plans a determined effort to
have a definite date fixed Tor a vote
both on profits taxes and the entire
bill. .
Final passage by next Saturday is
hoped for, but most leaders believes
tonight ten days or two wetks will be
required.

first meal after arriving at the Okla
homa post.
Four Are Injure.
The injured are: Privates Oakley,
Bloomer, McGrew and Raymond Rose.

died on the way to the hospital. The
shell is believed fo have exploded af
ter having been left partially buried
on the field, by the heat of a fire near
by, over which the men were cooking.
Officers Puzzled.
Army officers were puzzled over tht;

Sustains Local Board in i
Number of Cases But Re
verses Them in Others
List of Men Drafted
The district board at Tucson is still
working on the claims of Cochise
county . They sustained the Cochise
county board in granting 142 cases but
reversed them in a number of others.
The Tucson Citizen has the follow
ing account of the actions of the board
on Friday:
The instructions of the provost mar
shal to county attorneys to appeal
practically every case in which the lo
cal board allows exemptions on the
ground of dependent relatives is fore
ing the district board to do over again
the work of tie local boards in every
county as far as exemptions are con
cerned. The district board is not for
mally treating these cases, but is
giving each one careful consideration
as evidenced by the large number of
reversals of the action of the Co
vchise board in dependent cases. The
district board is applying uniformly
the rule adopted for dealing with de
pendent exemptions to every county
in the state.
Cochise Cases Considered
The board this morning continued
the consideration of Cochise county
cases. The decision of the Cochise
board in allowing exemptions in three
cases was reversed.
Lars John Sunden of Douglas was
refused exemption by the local board
on his claim of two dependent chil
dren. The decision was reversed by
the district board on his own appeal
and be was granted exemption.
Eugene R. Lopez of Willcox was
refused exemption by the local board
but his claim was reversed by the
district board later. Three depend
ant children were offered as the rea
son for exemption.
uavm . Campbell of Bis bee waj
granted exemption by the district
board after a decision in the negative
was first administered by the local
board. His claim was that of a de
pendent mother.
The board held an afternoon ses
sion yesterday and resumed at 10
o'clock this morning with all mem
bers present G. H. Dowell, general
manager of the Copper Qeuen Min
ing' company, and a member of the
board. Was on duty at 8 o'clock this
morning Boning oui we uocnise coun
ty claims for exemption. The record
in every case in which exemption 'is
allowed must be certified and a small
army of clerks is required to file and
classify the papers and keep the re
cords. An additional room for the use of
clerks was secured today in the
Southren Arizona Bank & Trust com
pany building. The board meets in
the law library of John B. Wright,
the secretary.
Cochise Cases Reversed
The district exemption board in ses

were afraid to go to work. Some that
I know you threatened that if they
would go to work the next day it would
be the last And to many you were
not quite so diplomatic, but told them
that if they would go to work the next
day their hearts would be cut out and
hung upon their door knobs. What I
know about these things could be mul
tiplied by hundreds of others. Our
city o cials wee even threatened.
These conditions became intolerable.
Our sheriff was full aware of what
was going on and when he thought,
upon sufficient evidence, that it was
getting to a dangerous point where
you people were getting desperate and
that you were going to do something
to close up the mines, he thought out
a pl?n that was the most humane that
of gathering you together and deport
ing you and your sympathizers. Had
he waited 24 hours and let you start,
which he knew you were going to do,
there would have been hundreds kill
ed instead of two. You might say that
that was an illegal act. I will agree
that it was as illegal as to blow up
buildings with dynamite when there
is a conflagatlon in a town and the
water facilities are inadequate to
quench the conflagatlon. ' It must be
done to try to save the rest of the
town, and it would be only equitable
that the rest of the town should pav
the cost of those buildings that were
blown up. So are we ready to pay the
cost, whatever it may be; but we have
saved the town.
"Now let me predict that this town
is going to be the standard for hours
and pay and labor conditions in gen
eral for many years to come.
"If I had the say I would give many
of you people a show to come back
and set whether you could not behave
yourselves, but the vast majority here
says no, and no it shall be. But if yon
break away from your affiliations there
are lots of opportunities elsewhere,
and if you should happen to be where
there is a Lolalty league, by all mean;
join it; and when you are asked what
it stands for you may answer like one
of the Loyalty men did here when he
was asked by an I. W. W. before the
strike: 'It stands for loyalty to my
family and loyalty to my country. And
if you have your conscience attuned j
right, you will add, 'and loyalty to my
emnloyer.' !
"Before closing I wish to relate an !
instance of what I heard and which is
outside of the labor question, to show .
you the depravity of the minds of the
I. W. W.'s. If it is not a fact, I want
you to correct me. I understand that j
there was hung up in the I. W. W. i
lodge room a profile or picture of Jesus '
with the working at the bottom, "The I
First Scab." I am not a Christian, but ;
nevertheless sin-e I have commenced
myself I have loved the !
beautiful character of Jesus- for the
great ideal he has left the world, j
'Peace on earth and good will to man.'

of the lowly Nazarlne, by saying, 'G?

Heed the warning now! Apply Spoktite at once and
not only stop the rattle but prevent the possibility of collapsing wheels.
A few drops squirted into the cracks caused by shrinkage of the wood
will swell your wheels tight as new and ketp them tight.
Cheaper, Better, Quicker Than Old Way
The old, or mechanical, way does not
prevent further shrinkage or swelling. The Spoktite
way does. The old way costs about $230 per wheel.
Spoktite tightens 4 wheels for $1.00. The old way
keeps your vehicle idle half a day or more. Spok

trouble of removing them Thousands of wheels have
been tightened the Spoktite way and not a single case
of failure has yet been found.

FINDS LOST GUN
If you had lost a pistol out of your
automobile while touring Colorado
three years ago and. while visiting a
friend in Arizona should see the self
same gun lying on his center table and
had it returned to you. wouldn't that
be a queer chain of circumstances?
That is what happened when John
Palmer of Bisbee was in Douglas
Thursday as the guest of friends.
"Where In the world did you get this
pistol?" he asked in a tone expressing
wonder as he looked at the weapon.
"Bought it from a smelterman for
$3.50." as the reply.
"Well, its mine." said Mr. Palmer,
and then proceeded to how the local
man distinctive markings, told him
the number and otherwise demonstrat
ed familiarity with the weapon.
Without demur the friend returned
it to him, and he carried it back here
with him. How the smelterman ob
tained the weapon, a 38 caliber Smith
& Wesson lammerless, is not known.

PRICE FIVE CENTS
MINES, MINING, LOCAL STOCKS AND COPPER
Price of Copper May
Receive Attention of
the Government Board
Government Will Find Hard Work of Fixing Price of Copper
Metal so That Industry Will Not Suffer Irretrivably
General Mining Conditions in the West Do Not Seem to
Be Bettering Montana's Big Smelter Tied Up by I. W.
W. Walkout Declared by Radicals
"Crops may be raised Indefinitely, year after year, but ore taken from
tbe mine Is gone and cannot be reproduced. Some of the authorities upon
the subject of what price should be fixed for copper metal would do well to
consider that fact." says Skillings' market letter.
On the one hand the government is merely fixing a price upon the pro
duction of farms for stated periods, whereas it is iixing a price for the actual
purchase of a part of the mines. The government fixes no prices on the farms.
Some of the authorities on price fixing of copper seem to figure that cop
per mines are permanent institutions and the cost of production the only vital
question to arrive at in determining a price for the metal. The farmers are
not selilng their farms, but the mine owners are selling their mines, when
production Is considered. The farm becomes more valuabele as years go by,
while the life of the mine is measured only by what it can produce just once.
The farmer is entitled to good prices for. his products and so Is the mining
company, and consideration of what Is embodied In the foregoing should not
be given by those whose duty it is to establish prices for metals during the
war. Mines are not permanent Institutions like farms.
There are two great drawbacks to copper price fixing. If the price of cop
per be fixed below 25 cents per pound, it will affect the wages of 200,000 mine,
mill and smelter employes. Mid affect the income of 450,000 individuals, banks,
insurance companies and other stockholders in copper companies. The drop
in wages which are on sliding scales, varying with the price of copper
would be 25 to 75 cents per shift, or about $40,000,000 per annum. This
would be a serious dislocation to the entire states of Arizona and Montana,
and to Alaska, and to large portions of Utah, Nevada. Michigan, Tennessee.
California and New Mexico, where the copper Industry furnishes the back
bone Industrially. Incidentally each one cent In the price of copper means
$2G,000,000 per annum difference to the companies and their stockholders.
Trampled Toe
As is said in another article on this page, it all depends upon whose toes
are stepped on. In the case of the copper producers, however, there Is noth
ing to be found which is analagous to some other industries in the country.
Every industry must aid In the payment of the stupendous costs which the
government of the United States and consequently the people of the country
must put up with. Every industry, on the whole, is willing to do Its share.
All realize that the war Is as much a matter of salvation to them as to the
lowliest miner or employe In their organization.
In the previous sentence is to be found the greatest trouble to be encoun
tered when any price fixing is considered the employe. He is the biggest
factor in any going concern and that this Is true In the copper mining world
is quite obvious.
Arizona Interested
Arizona is more directly effected by any interference with copper condi
tions than any other state in the country. In this state a large part of the
annual production is mined. Any order, any action on the part of congress,
which would reduce the price of the metal below certain standards would
double the war's toll on the state.
The government says "cut your price" and labor says "raise your wage.
It Is a most embarassing predicament that the copper people find them
selves in at the present time. It Is to be hoped, for the present and future of
Arizona, that due consideration and healthy thought be given to the question
before anything arbitrary is outlined and put Into effect.
General Conditioroc
General mining conditions have bettered but little In the west in the past
week. Montana is still in the throes of I. W. W.ism and there appears little
likelihood that it will be eliminated from Arizona until the federal govern
ment takes a more active hand.
In Montana the Washoe smelter has been forced to close.. This was
brought about by certain radicals of the Mine, Mill and Smelter union, over
riding the recent vote taken and going on strike. It means the closing down
"of one of the biggest reduction plants in the world; an Industrial center where
15.000 men are employed.
In Globe the situation is unchanged. Little progress is being made,
however, to a complete resumption of mining activities. In other parts of
the state there are signs of I. W. W. unrest.
Bisbee Is free from I. W. W.'s and their doctrines. Consequently, the
mines are going ahead, though with slightly reduced forces. The decision to
do without aliens In the local properties has made it extremely difficult to re
cruit the working forces up to normal. Moreover, the draft has cut a big
hole into the forces of every property in the Warren district.
With a readjustment of employment conditions after the first draft is
mobilized, there promises to come a normal resumption of work In every de
partment. Bureau of Mines Active
The Arizona state bureau of mines has devoted considerable attention to
war work, the work being divided into two distinct branches. That of S. C.
Dickinson, safety engineer of the bureau, is devoted largely to first aid train
ing for hospital and ambulance service, while the work of M. A. Allen, min
eral technologist. Is to stimulate ,the production of minerals essential for war
purposes. Mr. Allen has been working on the compilation of the mineral
resources of the state, and Is making arrangements to give the necessary
assistance and advice to those desiring to work these mineralf Many of the

MIS BUREAU
GIVES SERVICE
IN THIS STATE
State Bureau of Mines, Organ
ized But a Few Years Ago,
Has Grown Tremendously
In Every Possible Direction.
Many times the question is asked.
"What is the Arizona state bureau of
mines and what are its objects?" Al
though the law that created the state
bureau had a long list of objects, its
leading object, which embraces all the
rest, is SERVICE. Its object Is t'j per
form any service which the mining in
dustry of the state, miners, operators
or prospectors, may require, and which
are within the limit of possibilities of
the funds available.
Three years ago the state bureau
was an infant Organization, operated
virtually without money, doing what
little it could to call to the attention
of the public the vast importance of
Arizona's mineral resources, and to
assist wherever possible in the utiliza
tion of those resources. It was with
out affiliation or connection as a state
organization, although it was a depart
ment of the University of Arizona.
The legislature of 1915 recognized
the possibilities of a state bureau of
mines, and created as a state organi
zation the University of Arizona bur
eau 'of mines as the Arizona state bur
eau of mines, with an appropriation of
15000 annually. While this was a won
derful enlargement in the scope of the
work possible by the bureau, the al
most unprecedented development, the
search for new minerals and the in
flux of mining population into the
state, made the $5,000 appropriation
dwindle t'j the comparative size of the
$500 appropriation of the previous
year. The bureau was able to do a
great deal of work, but it was limited
to the few things of supreme Impor'-
ance.
The activities of the bureau extend
ed primarily into a publicity and bul
letin extension service, the furnishing
of personal and individual information
to those requesting the same, and the
dissemination of timely information
which was thougiit of value to the peo
ple of the state.
The search for new minerals and
metals made the rock analysis and
assaying department of the bureau
such a busy one that it shortly became
necessary to keep a man exclusively
on that work, and for the past year
samples have been coming in at the
rate of 200 samples per month.
More important, however, in the
work of the past year, has been the
formation of the policy which the state
bureau of mines plans to pursue. The
outlining and starting of a campaign
of education for the mines and pros
pector, which will enable him to seek
and find more easily both the new and
old minerals. This will allow him to
utilize more completely the minerals,
will cause him to conserve and de
velop without waste of financial or na
tural resources, and will help hiiu to
avoid mistakes.
The state bureau of mines in close
to the people; it has no red tape, and
when information is at hand which
the people of the state should know,
it may be speedily put before them.
As to the policy adopted regarding its
bulletin service, it has been decided
that frequent bulletins put out in a
non-technical manner, a small number
printed so that reprints may be more
frequent and up to date, and it is
hoped that eventually there will be a
bulletin at hand that wil answer any
inquiry in complete form that may
come to the office. This means that in
a general way the bulletin work of the
next three or four years is outlined,
they being published in the order of
their Importanec and demand.
The bulletin service is divided into
series, such as the mineral technology
series, the economic, law, metallurgi
cal and other series, any complete ser
ies being an elementary textbook on
their respective subjects, relating
principally to Arizona.
The wonderful productiveness of the
Arizona mining fields In such varied
lines and its natural spread over the
production of newer minerals, have
caused, during the past year, more de
mands upon the bureau than could pos
sibly Jjg financed. Not alone were the
funds insufficient, but in order to give
the people of Arizona the best infor
mation possible specialists were need
ed. In generous recognition of the
past work of the bureau, the state leg
islature of 1917 increased its appro
priation from 15000 to $25,000 annual
ly. This virtually does not allow much
expansion of its work beyond the de
mands already made upon it, but it al
lows for specialists in the various
lines.
Besides the director and the admin
istrative force there win be on the
staff of the bureau a metallurgist,
whose duty will be to keep the people
informed as to the true metallurgical
conditions within the state, to assist
men employed in the metallurgical
plants of the state to gain the knowl
edge that will better them in their
position, to inform the seller or small
quantities of ore as to the metallur
gical treatment of the same, and to
serve as the metallurgical engineer
for the state of Arizona.
The growing importance of the rare
and non-metallic minerals as empha
sized the necessity of the mineral tech
nologist on the staff of the bureau,
who will be able to advise how to find
the rare minerals and how to utilize
them properly after they are found, to
keep in touch with the markets and
to Bee that the people of Arizona get
the greatest value from their natural
resources in this line.
More important than the conserva
tion of our mineral resources is the
conservation of life, and this is to be
the particular field of the safety en
gineer of the bureau. It has been defi
nitely proven that but a small percent
age of the accidents and fatalities can
be prevented by mechanical means,
the larger percentage being In the hu
man factor, which can only be lessen
ed by constant care and thought. The
safety engineer will be the leader In
safety movements throughout the
state, the stimulator of interest in safe
ty, the organizer of safety clubs, and
will keep before the miners of the
state the importance of the safety
movement, lie will also advise the
operators as to the devices for safety,
for it is only by co-operaticn between
the miners and operators that any
thing like the ideal conditions can
be obtained.
The work of the bureau o m-es
for the next two years naturally di
vides Itself into three parts, bulletin
and information service, extension
work and research.
The bulletin service will be largely
an extension of what has been going
on during the past two years, altnougn
there will probably be more bulletins
published, in a greater variety of sub
jects. The bulletins are distributed
free to anyone within the state, and
at a very small cost to those outside
of the state.
The extension service will consist in
bringing the work of the bureau di
rectly to the people, and It is antici
pated that regular courses of lectures
will be given in every city and town In
the state several times during the
next two years. It is bringing the
university to the people who are un
able to attend the classes on the cam
pus. It is anticipated that the lec
tures will be given with a liberal use
of lantern slides and moving pictures,
for visual instruction in the absence
of textbooks is almost necessary.
The research work of the bureau
will be done In co-operation with the
United States mines experiment sta
tion located on the university campus
at Tucson, by men supplied by the
state to work under the direction of
the metallurgists or the U. S. bureau
of mines upon Arizona's problems.
The state bureau of mines has as
wonderful possibilities for develop
ment as have the mines of the state,
and will undoubtedly be a factor In
bringing new mines into the state.
More mines mean more employment;
more employment; more income from
taxes; more employment means great
er population and greater population
means more affiliated businesses.
The prosperity of the mines reflects
over every other industry.

of Claims for Low Costs

, The Engineering and Mining Jour

managements of most of the copper
producing companies took the greatest
pride in showing how cheaply tuey
could produce copper. The broker
age houses, interested in promoting
movements in the stock market, went
the managements better, while the fi
nancial papers capped the climax wita
their tables of alluringly low costs and
wonderful profits computed therefrom
at a scale of prices for copper. But
since the cost of producing copper
has appeared likely to be a factor in
the determination of price for the met-
under eovernment control
all
j members of the old chorus have b?e
j 8inK:ng ln a different key. The pro
ducer who not long ago was blithely
alleged to be making copper at 10c per
pound is now lugubriously represented
as being subject to a cost of 19 or 20c.

In the first place, companies report

In other words, these was not proper

Highest Price Paid for Silver
Since the Civil War Has
Been Registered Since Au

The price of silver has shown prac
tically a steady advance since the first

the highest since th Civil war. Deal

in regard to the purchase of silver bul-

On August 1 silver was quoted in i

The fiigh figure of 86 3-4 cents recent

period of about three weeks.
A h'h silver market is no small
factor in increasing profits c copper
and other mining companies wlilch re

considerably benefits the Cobalt prop
erties, especially Kerr Lake and Nip

advance in silver in three weeks, how
ever, those companies that would ben
efit the most have failed to rellect
this advance in silver stockmarket
wise. Closing prices of many of these
stocks shows but fractional changes
as compared with those of three weeks
ago, when silver was quoted at 80
cents.
American Smelting turned out 71,

is the largest single factor in silver

minerals involve metallurgical prob
lems which are being worked upon by
the research department of the bur
eau. Mr. Allen's work throughout the en
tire year will be devoted to furthering
the mineral production of the state,
and to the search for rare mineral de
posits. Publicity De Luxe
A feature of the work of the bureau
is its publicity department, which is
in two distinct branches. Its service
within the state and that outside of
the state. The bureau is not hamper
ed by red tape, and when important
mining information comes in that may
note mat. me papers use u v,viuw
Tlie publicity outside of the state is
j devoted to the writing of stories on
Arizona mining for many of he tech-
nicai, semi-iecnnicai ana uimuuini
pers, from tne Atlantic to tne racwc
coast. Regular articles are supplied
for these papers individually, which
call attention to the resources of tie
state of Arizona and the opportunities
for Investment there. It is a very de
sirable and valuable service, and has
been instrumental in calling to the at
tention of prospective investors the
real opportunities of Arizona.
Much Correspondence
Most voluminous of the work of the
bureau Is its individual correspondence
department. Almost every kind of a
question imaginable is asked, varying
from "How far Is Mars?" to "How
long is a string?"
The bureau of mines serves as a
bureau of information in its broadest
senes and answers Inquiries of any
nature regarding mining, metallurgy,
geology, mineralogy, mining law or
other affiliated subjects as completely
as possible.
This branch of the work emphasizes
the one word policy of the bureau of
mines, which is "Service."
a Research Department
The research department of the
state bureau of mines is working co
operatively with the U. S. bureau of
mines on the campus of the University
of Arizona. In order to prevent dupli
cation of work, the state bureau pro
vides research workers to work under
U. S. bureau of mines in several other
parts of the country, notably at the
University of Utah, Salt Lake City,
Utah, of Washington at Seattle, and
at the University of Idaho at Moscow.

COST-TO HUE COPPER
HW HUGE QUESTION

cording as to whether they choose to I
figure a cheap mine and a dear rail- j
way, or vice versa.
Another fallacy in the matter of j
costs pertains to those mines that pro-1
duce valuable substitutes other than j
copper. Most of the copper produc-1
ers work ores that yield a little gold j
and silver. It is the common prac- ab,e indorsenient ever given a proprie
tice to deduct the value of such by
products from the cost of producing : fry medicine was the statement made
copper. So long as that does not ' recently by H. J. Williams, a coal min
pmount to much, and so long as it is : er at the Tennessee Coal and Iron
the common practice among producers,
there is no great misrepresentation.
When, however, the ore yields a good f
deal of value other than copper, there
may be a great deal of misrepresenta
tion. Thus, there are some mines ;
whose classification is doubtful. For
example, should the mines of the Co
eur dAleue in Idaho be classed as
lead mines or as silver mines? At one
time their lead value might predomi
nate, at another time their silver val
us. according to market conditions.
Among the copper mines, the Ana-1
cenda and United Verde are especi
ally noteworthy for their high silver .
value. Anaconda being not only the .
largest copper producer of the United :
States, but alto, with its output of
10,790,705 oz. of silver (in 1916), the
largest silver producer. Possibly, in .
the case of the Anacondo company the
matter cf determinating the cost of i
epper, zinc, silver, gold, lead, and var-1
ious by-products, but also is a nopern '
tor of custom smelteries and refiner
ies, railways, coal mines, factories of .
several kinds, public utilities, mercan
tile stores, etc. The company itsell
has never attempted to state its cost
of producing copper. j
Finally, there is the great question
of the investor in a copper mine get-:
ting his money back; that is, the prin- j
cipal invested in the business, both for)
the acquisition of the ore body, in the
first place, and the subsequent equip

purrhase of ore bodies, humen in
genuity has not yet been able to de
vise a general rule. In some cases,
especially those of flat-lying ore bod
ies that can be delimited by the drill,
we can make fairly reliable estimates.
: Eut with all other classes of ore bod-
ies, like those of Butte, Mont., Jerome,
Ariz., and Bisbee, Ariz., nobody can
say what is going to be their duration
and what should be the annual allow

This is the problem into which the
Federal Trade Commission was lightly
launched. Its report cannot pos
sibly be anything but a hodepodgc of
fragmentary data, which will not be ol

The loveliest negliges this season
are fashioned in chiffon or georgette

graceful folds. A satin ribbon girdle
fastens at the waist line, lending added
charm to the garment.
The exquisite daintiness ot a lin

pliclty of its lines and the tasteful
manner in which lace is employed. A
very wide net top pattern is used and
the effect is such that a double flounce
line appears. The bodice is extreme

and elbow-length sleeves. A narrow

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY MORNING, AUGUST 26, 1917.
"FIGHTING FUST WILL TAKE
ITS PLACE IN FRONT RANKS OF
AMERICA'S ARMY OF DEMOCRACY
In Spite of Odds, Criticism and Difficulties, Arizona Has Or
ganized and Schooled the Finest Nucleus of a Regiment
in the Country Great Opportunities Offered for Ad
vancement in the Contingent They Will Be Heard From
Arizona will have no cause to be
ashamed of ber representation in the
forces that Uncle Sam will send to
France to bring the Kaiser to terms.
During the last few months the First
Arizona has undergone a wonderful
change in its camp at Naco. Although
the boys of the First had been drill
ing hard ever since being called out
lOr duty during the Mexican crisis.
they redoubled their efforts when war
was declared on Germany and have
since been studying, training, drilling,
hiking and practising war maneuver.
almost continually.
The result is that today the regiment
is probably in better condition than
many regular army units and, with a
few months more intensive training,
should be ready to carry the Stars and
Stripes to France to undergo final
training within hearin of the big
guns and within sight of the fighting'
fronts.
Men Are Determined.
The reason for the present efficient
status of the regiment is simple every
enlisted man and officer is determined
that the First Arzona shall give a good
account of itself in the war. Several
months ago there were approximately
1100 enlisted men and officers in the
regiment. Now there are between 70u
and 800. But, in spite of the fact that
this might appear discouraging to an
outsider, it is one of the most encour
aging things about the organization. I
When the regiment was mustered,
into the federal service several 1
months ago, before the general order.
mustering in all national guard regi
ments throughout the country, every
member who did not want to enter the
federal service was excused. This cut
a considerable number of names from j
the roll of the regiment. A short time :
afterwards orders were received to j
discharge every member of the regi-j
nient with dependents. Still more
members left the regiment under this
ruling, cutting the original number:
practically in half. j
Drilling Intesified. '
Or Un? i y thi would sve been dis
couraging in the extreme.
But the officers and enlisted men
who remained looked on the bright sii'.e
of things. They realized t'.a: every
man who had remained in ite service ,
could be relied upon to stick to his
post for whatever eventua'unes might
come. And so the little Arizona regi
ment, in the face of rilicuie and criti
cism began the task of rebuilding it-i
self. It was a figBt ik existence, fori
there were vague rumora tast the reg-
intent might be disbanded. This only i
inspired the members to harder work'
for they were determined that the
First Arizona should not die when men I
were needed more than ever before
by the nation.
Months of hard work followed. Drill-
ing were intensified. Men were shift-!
ed from company to company and from I
department to department until the of
ficers were satisfied that each man
was in the place where he could offor
the miximum of service. The First Ar
izona began to show improvement.
There was a better feeling among the 1
members. Any petty rivalries that may .
have existed faded away as the boys
in khaki began to realize that the more ,
they worked together the better show ;
ing they would make.
New Methods Studied. i
When word was received that Gen
eral Pershing had arrived in France
I and was makiug preparations for
j thousands of American troops to train
j behind the firing line the little camp
j at Naco was feverish with enthusiasm.
! And when the news came that the first
contingent of troops had successfully
evaded the German submarines and
landed in the war zone, work at th
camp became almost an absession with
the regiment Every manner of drill
ing and training calculated to fit the
men for active service work abroad
was taken up. Trench work, bayonet
drills, hand-to-hand fighting, and a
score of other methods of fighting
which have proved effective in the
world struggle were carefully studied
ied.
Today, the First Arizona, although
small, can hold its own among the best
former guard regiments in the coun
try. The discipline is excellent and
the cooperation that has sprung up
between every branch of the regiment
has biOught that which cooperation al
ways brings efficiency.
Today the regiment has something
that proves that it is gaining the res
pect and admiration of the public, a
"rookie company,"- or, as it is better
known, an "awkward squad." Instead
of trying to "steer clear of military
service, scores of young men In every
part of the state have, during the last
few months, showed an eagerness I'J
enlist in the regiment Not all have
been accepted, for, although far under
war strength, the First Arizona is tak
ing only men whom it knows can be
depended upon in every way. As a
result the "rookie company' is made
up of men of intelligence and ability.
Many members have left good posi
tions IV) enlist, for they are confident
that tbey are going into an organiza
tion that means business.
The first few weeks of the rookie's
life proves hard in many ways, but the
novelty serves to smooth down 'the
rough edges and, when Mr. Recruit has
bad bis three "shots in the arm" of
anti-typhoid serum, has been initiated
into the mysteries of the wood pile and
kitchen police, and has been assigned
to one of the companies, be generally
feels about 100 per cent better than
when he first walked with shaky knees
before the medical officers to be ex
amined. One of the things that is bringing
in recruits rapidly, although nV vigor
ous recruiting campaign is urfder way,
is the excellent chance of advance
nient. When the First Arizona reaches
Linda Vista, Calif., it is probable that
it will be greatly enlarged, under th
new orders recently promulgated by
the war department. Hundreds of men
will be added to regiment to bring it
up to the strength called for in the
new orders. This will mean that scores
of non-commissioned and commission
ed officers will have to be selected.
And it is only natural to assume that
these, or at least a majority of them,
will be picked from the men already in
Aie regiment From every indication
the First Arizona offers the enlisted
man more chance of advancing, provid
ing he is made of the right stuff than
any other branch of the army service
in this part of the country.
All in all, the, outiook for the regi
ment is unusually good and when it
gets to France, Arizonans should be on
the lookout for cheering reports from
the "Fighting First."

FRANCE TO TAKE UP DUTIES IN
AMERICAN
RED
CROSS
ACTIVITIES
careful consideration. From the be
ginning of the war Mr. Douglas has
often expressed to his friends that he
was anxious to do anything in his
power to aid his country in the war
and was willing to make any reason
able sacrifice in this effort. He male
this willingness and desire known
sometime ago to H. B. Davisson, sec
ond senior partner in the firm of J.
B. Morgan & Company, who is the di
rector general of the American Red
Cross. Recently when in Washington
he met John D. Ryan, who is director
of war relief and repeated his willing
ness to serve his country should a
place be found where he could ren
der desired assistance. . Mr. Ryan
assured Mr. Douglas that there was
urgent need for competent men to
handle the great work of the Red
Cross and at once communicated with
Brigadier General Murphy ( who urg
ed that Mr. Douglas come to France at
the earliest possible date. Since ho
was informed of this call he has been
rushing his business into shape for
:-.is departure.
He has large local interests here and
it Douglas. He is a director in the
Bank of Bisbee and interested in the
Bisbee Improvement Company and a
number of others besides several en
terprises in Douglas.
He is president of the Bank of Doug
las and president of the Douglas In
vestment company, holding the control
of the electric light and power plant,

den hotel, the Douglas Traction
Light company and the large ice plan'..
Second in command of all these en
terprises is W. H. Brophy of this city.
who will give some extra time, when
necessary to keep them going success
fully as they have been in the past
C. O Ellis has been so long at the
head of the business management of
the Bank of Douglas that the absence
of Mr. Douglas will not result in any
wavering of this splendid financial in
stitution. Mr. R. G. Arthur will be
spurred to extra endeavor in the man
agement of the public utility "enter
prises because of the absence, of Mr.
Douglas.
Mr. S. P. Applewhite, who has been
the valuable assistant and private sec
retary to Mr. Douglas for a number
of years in all his business enterprises
will bave charge of the J. S. Douglas
office in Douglas and Mr. Douglas i
eaving with the satisfaction, of know
ng that bis business interests will bo
well cared for during bis . absence
whether that be short or long.
Hurts To Leave Family.
Mr. Douglas showed plainly yester
day that about the only regrets that
he bad in connection with bis depart
ure for. France was the parting from
his family. Mrs. Douglas he said.
would accompany him to New York
and then go with their youngest son,
James, to Mt Clair, New Jersey
where James would enter the McVick-
ers school. Later it is the intention
of Mrs. Douglas to go for a visit with
her son Lewis wherever he may be lo
cated. He was given a commission as
second lieutenant as a result of the
training be received in the officers' re
serve camp at Presidio, California. Hj
has been assigned to the artillery
branch of the army and now goes to
American Lake, Washington, for train
ing. He will accompany his parents to
New York and go to his post from
there.
The best wishes of hundreds of cit
izens of Cochise county and of Arizo
na go with Mr. Douglas. His public
spiritedness and interest in the indus
trial progress of Arizona has endeared
him to the state. That Arizona's
most prominent and useful citizen
may come back to the state is the
earnest hope of all.
Three boxes, each containing SO
pounds of red lye, have been received
by Stark Corporation of Manchester,
costing $6000. Same dyes could be
purchased for $90 prior to the war.
The last invoice was brought over by
the Deutschland on its second trip.

SUMMER COMPLAINT
During the hot weather of the sum
mer months some member of almost
every family is likely to be troubled j
with an unnatural looseness of the ;
bowels, and It Is of the greatest im
portance that this be treated promptly,
which can only be done when the med
icine is kept at hand. Mrs. F. F.
Scott, Scottsvllle. N. Y.. states. "I first
nsed Chamberlain's Colic and Diar
rhoea Remedy as much as five years I
ago. At that time I had a severe at- j
tack of summer complaint and was
suffering intense pain. One dose re
lieved me. Other members of'my fam
ily have since used it with like re-
ults." Adv.
Report received in Washington says
that most influential group of bankers
in New York has advices that chances
of peace between now and spring have
increased tremendously. Preparations
are under consideration for rearrange
ment of banking facilities to meet
changed conditions. j

From Any Point of View
"We Make 'Em Fit"
The advantages of tailor-made clothes are apparent from
every angle. Appearance, durability and the look of
newness which a tailor-made suit possesses even when it
is old are advantages that you should consider. Re
gardless of your point of view, the tailor-made suit
should be your selection.
We have on display nearly five hundred fabrics, most
desirable for men's suits and overcoats.

ENGLISH PENSIONS UP.
The idea of a national union of di
1 charged soldiers and sailors was ad
vanced a step the other day when one
hundred delegates from various local
organizations decided to 1'orni a na
I tior.al federation with executive com-
mittees in different parts of the I ail
ed Kingdom. The main work of the
committees will be to secure proper
treatment for their members in the
matter of pensions and allowance.
I Jrvnes Myles K'Jgge. member of par
liament, addressing the delegates slid
that while pensions were liberal tnan
i ever bfore, the amount grantej was
I in many cases totally inadequate.
