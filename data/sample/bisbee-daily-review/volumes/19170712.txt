Speculation In

CHICAGO, July'll. Traders tonight
; interpreted the action of the Chicago
board of trade today in fixing a mini
mum price of $1.28 for December and j
May deliveries in corn as practically ;
terminating grain speculation in the
United States during the war. When
trading recently was restricted in
wheat so as to forbid new deals in
futures the price for wheat fell near
ly $1 a bushel, traders and specula-i

corn. Prices advanced until finally '

After the capture of Halicz,
on the iront from Halicz to
Zolotvin, about 30 miles to cneaP
the south, General Koerniloff
forced the Austro-Germans to!
continue their retreat. In their;
advance from Halicz the Rus-I
sians forced the fleeing enemy
across the Lommca and occu
pied two towns on the western
bank of the river. The next
natural barrier is the river
Stoka, about six miles west of
the Lomnica.
South and west of Stanlslau the
Russians have reached the Posiecz-Le-;
siuvia-Karmacz line, the central point
of which, Lesiuvka, is four miles west
of the river Bystritza. This line is
about seven miles east of Kalnez, the
nearest large town west of Stanislau
and which is situated on the Stoka riv
er. The extension of the Russian
fighting line to Zolotvin brings the
battle ground into the foothi'.ls of tli
Carpathians.
On Tuesday the Russians captured
2000 more prisoners and 30 guns,
bringing their total captured from July
8 to 10 to more than 10,000 officers
and men and 80 guns. A large number
W machine guns and much war ma
terial also was taken. Berlin gives no
details of Tuesday's fighting in Ca'i
cia, merely saying: "Movements
south of the Dniester have been exe
cuted until now as planned.'
Bridge Is Destroyed
On the Tjelgian coast, east of Duu
kirk, the British and Germans are
fighting again afcmg the Yser, the
scene of many hard-fought battles.
By destroying the bridges across the
Yser, between Nieuport and the North
Sea coast, the Germans were able to
advance and occupy the isolated sec
tion. Berlin claims the capture of
1200 prisoners in the penetration of
600 yards along a front f 1400 yards.

STRIKING AUSTRIANS AND GERMANS
DENOUNCED BY SON OF FATHERLAND
The following open letten to "men
of German and Austrian nationality
who went on strike with the I. W. W."
was written by Carl Clauben, an Amer
ican sitizen. Clausen was born and
raised in Germany and Berved for a
time as an officer in the Imperial navy.
He is now a staunch American, but,
in spite of international differences,
s'ill respects the land of his birth
enough to urge others of German and
Austrian descent to "act like upright,
honest men and not like spies, agita
tors and crooks.
Here is Clausen's sentiment:
It has come to the writer's knowl
edge that all men who owe allegiance
to Germany and Austria, working in
the Bisbee m!nes. went on strike with
the I. W. W. This seems almost in
credible and can only be explained
that they did so through ignorance
and fear.
To all of these men I want to say:
"If you have any' shame and self-respect
return promptly te work before
it is too late."
True our country is at war with
yours, but this is the very reason why
you should refrain from any act which
will stamp you as active enemies of
this country which gives you shelter
and protection, permits you to follow
freely and unmolested your occupation
and in return only ask that you obey
the laws and refrain from any overt
act against this government while in
its domain.
Your employers, for whom you
worked, have treated you fair and just
you least of all have reason for com
plaint, neither as to wages or treat
ment. Why then don't you do your
duty and stand by your employers and
respect the laws of the country that
protects you Instead of joining men
whose aim is not only to tie the hands
that have enabled honest workers to
secure good living, a good home, edu
cation for their children and happi
ness, but by their revolutionary action
endanger the well being of this govern
ment. By joining these men you also
become active enemies of this country, j
which, although at war with your j
country, gives you the same protection I
that your country gives to Americans ;
in Germany and Austria and you, like
they, are expected not to raise, your .
hands arainst the country whose pro- j
tection you entoy. In other words i
you are placed on your honor.
By joininr the renegade element of i
the I. W. W. you become active ene- i
Bisbee, July 12, 1917
I have formed a Sheriff's Posse of '1 ,200men in
Bisbee and 1,000 in D uglas, all loyal Americans, for
the purpose of arresting, on charges of vagrancy, trea
son, and of being disturbers of the peace of Cochise
County, all those strange men who have congregated
here from other parts and sections for the purpose of
harassing and intimidating all men who desire to pur
sue their daily toil. I am continually tcld of threats and
insults heaped upon the working men of this district by
so-called strikers, who are strange to these parts, yet
,who presume to dictate the manner of life of the peo
ple of this district.
Appeals to patriotism do not move them, nor do
appeals to reason. At a time when our country needs
her every resource, these strangers persist in keeping
from her the precious metal production of this entire
disirict.
Today I heard threats to the effect that homes
would be destroyed because the heads of families in
sisted upon their rights as Americans to work for them
selves, their families and their country.
Other threats have and are being daily made.
Men have been assaulted and brutally beaten, and only
today I heard the Mayor cf, Bisbee threatened and his
requests ignored.
We cannot longer stand or tolerate such condi
tions! This is no labor trouble we are sure of tht
but a direct attempt to embarrass and injure the
government of the United States.
I therefore call upon all loyal Americans to aid
me in peaceably arresting these disturbers of our
national and local peace. Let no shot be fired
throughout th s day unless in necessary self defense,
and I hereby give warning that each and every
leader of the so-called strikers will be held person
ally, responsible forany injury inflicted upon any of
my deputies while in the performance of their duties
as deputies of my posse, for whose acts I, in turn,
assume full responsibility as Sheriff of this County.
All arrested persohs will be treated humanely
and their cases examined with justice and care. I
hope no -resistance will be made, fori desire no
bloodshed. However, I am determined if resistance
is made, it shall be quickly and effectively overcome.

Commander of "Short Guys9
Brigade" Confident Small
Men Will Win World Battle
WORD from Washington that
the height limit for war
army recruits had bepn
altered so as to allow
small men to enlist was received
last night with great joy by Colon
el D'Arcy Smith and Captain
Frank Galligher, of the staff of
the "Short Guy's Brigade", an
amateur military organization of
this city.
Colonel Smith has for several
months contended that short men,
make the best fighters, and he
stated in an interview last night
that the action of the war depart
ment yesterday proves that, as
usual, he was right.
"The action of the government
vindicates us short guys," said
Colonel Smith. "For years we
embryonic Napoleons and Funs
tons have been given the rough
toss whenever men were wanted
for the army and navy. Now we
are offered the chance ' to prove
that though we are short of stat
. ure we are long in courage. I am
confident the short men of the na
tion will win the war.
"The short man has many ad
vantages over the tall, lanky
soldiers, for instance; the order
to charge the enemy Is given and
the short guys jump froqi the
trenches and start after the kraut
eaters "ditches. The Germans
may fire at the tall boys, but the
runts can get over to the enemy
and poke bayonets in their shins
before the Fritz boys look down
and see them. This military strat
egy may not seem clear to the lay

mind, so I will give another ex
ample : Suppose I am , with a
bomb-throwing squad and we run
out of bombs. The tall fellows are
in danger of stopping a 12-inch
shell fired by the enemy, but 1
can step under a mushroom and
go to sleep without being noticed
until the row is over."
"How does it feel to be so short
that you can look a worm straight
in the eye without bending over?"
Colflnel Smith was asked.
"Ahem!" grunted Colonel Smith
as he stepped on a chair and
reaching up one arm placed his
hand on the shoulder of a normal
sized man, "We short men are
proud of our lack of height and
if the Short Guys' Brigade, of
which I am commander, can be
rounded up for warfare drill before
we enlist, I think we will be able
to show Tony Frieburg and the
other giants in this town that
height is not might when it comes
to military tactics."
"Are the Short Guys planning
any new branches for their com
pany?" ?sked the reporter.
"Yes," relied the colonel, "We
are going to organize a squad of
cavalry."
"Where will you get enough
horses?"
"The Short Guy's cavalry wont
need horses," explained Colonel
Smith, "We will ride to the front
on fox terriers. The brigade has
no fear of getting injured during
the fighting. unless we got stepped
on. That is all I care to be
quoted as saying."

recommended that the mediation con-

could accomplish little at the present

Jerome Encouraging.
Judge McBride was more hopeful to
night of a satisfactory solution of the
strike problem at Jerome where the
I. W. W.. leaders were deported re
cently. He received a message from
one of the operators in that district to
day saying that the companies were
pleased with the attitude the Interna
tional Union of Mines. Mill and Smelter
Workers had taken toward the I. W
W. element and the general way In
which the International Union's
strike had been conducted.
A demand was made for a "closed
Khop" at Jerome, the ultimatum ex
piring Friday. Because the situation
has been complicated by te activities
of the I. W. W. leaders in that dis

Hunt, President Wilson's personal rep
resentative on the niediation hoard
concurred tonight in Judge McUrideV
statement to the department of labor
that there was no immediate hope of
reaching a settlement of the strike dif

Pickets Dispersed.
"Tne situation is at a standstill."
Hunt said tonight.- "The operators
and strikers are deadlocked for the
present, at least, and I am now acting
as a peace-maker anrl advising the un

matier what "the provocation," he
added.
Mounted deputy sheriffs late today,

DISLOYALTY CHARGED
NEBRASKA CHURCHMEN
AND COLLEGE 'PROFS'
Action of Pedagogues at Unl
versity Brings Scathing De
nunciation From State
Council of Defense.
'By Review Leased Wire)
LINCOLN, Neb., July 11. The "con
spicuous" leaders of the Lutheran
church and "certain professors" of
the University of Nebraska were de
nounced" for "treasonable utterances,
disloyal activity and passivity that has
tended to give aid rt Germany, ?n
enemy," Jn a statement Issued today
by the Nebraska state council of de
fense, after the most solemn and ser
ious investigation and consideration."
The statement, it is explained, is bas
ed upon reports from every section of
the state and upon hundreds of let
ters from patriotic men, many of whom
declare they had lost thousands of
dollars because they would not "tame
ly submit to pro-German influences."
The names of men against whom
the charges are made vrm not iiiai'.t
public but George Copeland, vice
chairman of the council of dr fense and
head of the fctod conservation divi
sion o fthe council, said : "Conditions
became such that tne council could
no longer repress the bitterness it
felt." (He said ample evidence to war
rant his assertions had been obtained
by the council.
Churchmen Deny CI fcrge
Pitmiinent Lutheran churchmen
here said the council should have con
. fined its denunciation to "German
Lutherans" and asserted there was no
cause to question their loyalty. Ger
man Lutherans who were arregec to ne
in sympathy with Germany would not
discuss the charges.
Chancellor Samuel Avery of the
University of Nebraska, who has been
very active in patriotic relief work and
has even taken part in the campaign
for recruits, wbuld not be quoted, but
'it is kn'own he has strongly disapprov
ed a number of professors who-e pro-!
German utterances have caused dissen
tion at the university. Some time ago
students protested some of their pro
lessors were saying "this Is not our
war and we will not fight because we
do not know what It is all about."
When complaint was made to Chancel
lor Avery, it is understood there were
some conferences with professors at
which the chancellor, who was then
urging the students to enlist, let it be
known in emphatic language such doc
trines must not be heard in univer
sity cjass rooms. ,
Half the male students at the Uni
versity of Nebraska have either en
listed in some branch of the service
or have volunteered and been accept
ed fjr work on farms in the central
district. Some of the professors have
enlisted.
Lutherans Denounced
Referring to disloyal Lutherans the
council in its statement said:
"Perhaps never in history has it
been deemed necessary by a public
body to single out by name a great
church or 'organization and appeal to
the patriotism of its members to offset
and check the dangerous tendencies
of many of the conspicuous represen
tatives of that organization.
. "Depending upon the American pa
triotism of the men and women who
comprise the Lutheran church mem
bership the Council makes this appeal
to them to put a check upon the un
American activities of some of their
conspicuous and influential represen
tatives. The council could not wait
until great damage is done before mak
ing its protest. Perfectly aware that
its protest is unusual, but conscious
of the absolute necessity jf such a pro
test the council makes that protest
now in order that American interests
may be faithfully protected.
Confident that it is useless to make
further appeal to the conspicuous rep
resentatives of that church the coun
cil addresses its appeal to the rank
and file of the church membership
and hereby calls upon the member
ship to make known, on behalf of the
Lutheran church, devotion to America
the country that gives it protection
and religious liberty."
The council declares it will use all
"Its power and authority to suppress
in Nebraska any interference with the
determination to pu6h this war to a
speedy and successful conclusion"

Words and ?lusic of Beautiful
Song Both Written by Mrs.
Bertha Strinker, Formerly
of This City.
Mrs. Bertha Bauer-Strlnker, a Co
chise county girl, whv was born in
Tombstone and spent the early part of
her life in Bisbee,, but who at present
is a resident of Phoenix, has written
a state anthem entitled 'I Love You.
Arizona." Copies of the words and
song have been received here and cop
ies will soon be placed on sale in the
local music stores.
The words and the music were both
written by Mrs. Strinker and the words
pay a fine tribute to the state from
which it takes its name. The song
was presented to the last state legis
lature but that body did not have time
to acj upon it It has, however, been
accepted by business men's associa
tions of several cities as the state an
them. The words are as follows:
They sing songs about Xentucxy,
California by the sea;
They sing songs of Old Virginia,
And the battles fought by Lee,
But the song that sounds the sweetest
In all this world to me.
Is, I love j'ju. Arizona.
' And your quaint old history.
Chorus
I love you, Arizona.
Your name sounds sweet to me;
You're the land of so much sunshine
And all prosperity;
Where the rose blo'oms in November,
What a lovely sight to see!
I love you, Arizona,
You're the dearest state to me.
I love your fertile valleys.
Your mountains filled with ore;
And another state cannot compare
With 'ju from shore to shore.
For the land that once was desert
Now are fields of golden grain.
Where the cattle now are roaming
On your fine big desert plains.
I love your big Grand Canyon;
'Tis wonderful to see.
It is the work of nature
That makes it dear to me.
In ail the distant foreign lands.
In travels far and wide,
My mem'ry still clings i thee,
Arizona, oh, so grand.
I love you, Arizona,
For your mineral wealth as well.
For the priceless htores of copper '
And other ores that tell
Of the wealth within your bosom
That beckons to the world.
&To c'ome accept your treasure,
Where nature lies unfurled.
All love seems here abounding,
All kinship as if one;
Our fellow man a brother.
And God our guiding sun.
Earth gives forth his offering pur?
Each seems to have his share
In the land of Airzona,
Where good is everywhere.

A STITCH IN TIME WILL SAVE NINE.
If the better class of citizens of this community
had not been indifferent, during the past six months, to
their danger, there would have been no strike in the Bis
bee mines. Pretty strong statement, but facts bear it
out We may not have been asleep, but we were surely
Not in a thousand year can they ever get a hearing
with an employer of labor under a leadership that has
already gone on record as declaring that any settlement
of the trouble can only be temporary, as they have tasted
blood money and want more.
They can never hope for any recognition of their
terms with the Jerome case, where their leaders of the
I. W. W. violated their own solemn agreement thirty
days after it was made, standing on the records against
them?
For what, then, are they striking? Not for any defi
nite principle or object. Not because of any specified
abuse or of mistreatment or unendurable conditions. Not
for any certain and fixed scale of wages.
AND BECAUSE OF THESE FACTS, PUBLIC OPIN
ION THE COUNTRY OVER IS SOLIDLY AGAINST
THESE COPPER STRIKES.
Public opinion generally, and not the mine owner,
has declared that this strike must, therefore, be inspired
either by treason or anarchism. And public opinion will,
in the end, make this country too hot to bold this brand
of strike leaders.
Many strikes in the past have had a considerable
weight of public opinion behind them. But these strikes
in Arizona at this time have not had a feather weight
of it They have not even a reputable labor union or
ganization behind them. I
The leaders know why they called the strikes, and
why they are keeping them going. They are paid for
their work. They are professionals. It is their business.
But do the strikers themselves know? Who is paying
them for their idleness? .What do they really hope to
gain from losing two or three weeks' wages and turning
public opinion against reputable union labor organiza
tions ?

GLOBE NOW CAPITAL
The capital of Arizona, as far as the
governor is concerned, is now situated
at Globe, to which place the governor
went when the strike broke out. ::ai
colm Fraser, secretary to the gover
nor, forwarded to Globe Tuesday a big
batch of mail and papers requiring the
attention of the governor. Fraser said
he had received no word from tne
governor as to when to expect nun
home.
nodding when the vanguard of the "wobbly" swarm ap 8troyed by their own vloience. Only a fixed principle
peared here. They talked and harangued, and we smiled
tolerantly They held meetings and plotted and con
spired to cripple our mines and hamper our business
and hurt our city, and we stood supinely by and let the
fire get a good start.
Then, when the strike was called and a consider
able number of miners had actually walked out, we began
to get busy. t
We could not believe that the miners would pay at
tention to these wild-eyed shouters. We took things for
granted. And, as a result, we have had a strike on our
hands for two weeks, and it is still "on."
Douglas and El Paso profited by our example and
did not let them light. It was easy. Jerome let 'em light,
but not for long. You can put out a fire with one bucket
of water if you start in time. But that same fire will
keep two engines busy it it gets a good start.
Hindsight beats foresight, of course. But we know
now. Oust the plotters while they are hatching their
plot. Then there is not a chance for an epidemic of trea
son to spread.
Now there is a class of citizens here, fortunately in
the small minority, but still a few, we are sorry to say,
who are actually ready to encourage yea, who have al
ready encouraged such a propaganda as we are now
facing and slowly but "surely stamping out. Such citi
zens are but little, If any, better than the "wobblies"
themselves.
The man from abroad who makes war upon your
country is an enemy, but the citizen of that country who
extends aid, comfort and abetment to his country's en
emies, is a traitor. And history judges a traitor more
harshly than it does the fighting man, even though the
latter's cause was bad.
The citizens and the loyal miners have banded ino
organizations whose sole object is the best interest of
this community. They are standing straight and firm for
their town and their flag. Those who are not for us are
against us. There can be no half-way ground. This is
not an ordinary strike. These are no ordinary times.
These "wobbly" leaders yes, and many of their rank
and file have tried the patience of this community to
the uttermost. Federal patience with this high-handed
stroke at the copper output is also beginning to crack.
Treason is an ugly word, but none other seems to fit this
strike situation. And the strike leaders, the strikers and
the aiders and abettors and sympathizers of these men
are getting further and further, every day, outside the
pale of the great mass of the citizens of this country
who place love of home and pride of city and devotion
to flag above every other consideration.
Determined, unyielding, fearless action upon the side
of the right should animate every citizen of this place
in dealing with this poisoned sore. An infected sore may
well become a cancer IF IT IS NOT CUT OUT!
WORDS VERSUS SUMMER WAGES.
"We will not mediate except directly with the mine
operators," declared the "wobblies" at Globe, in answer
to efforts of the state and federal agents to hold a con
ference. Then they added, frankly, that they would not
call off the Arizona strikes until the Montana strikes
were settled in their favor. And they also added, just to
give the state and federal agents something to consider
and digest, that even if all their present demands in
this state were met that they had new demands to make
In the future. f
The mine operator who would enter conference with
these creatures ought to be placed in an asylum for the
feeble-minded and hopelessly insane.
To confer with these strike leaders would be as
though a man set upon by wolves should stop to hold
a parley with them.
And how these "wobblies." declaring their strike
ainis and purposes as above, can get miners to leave their
work and go on strike tinder their leadership and guid
ance, passes all comprehension. How are the pick and
shovel boys going to gain anything from quitting work?
What definite thing are they striking for?
and a righteous cause shall endure.
If a "wobbly" came to the door of your house at
night, and insisted upon leading you off in the dark by
a path that he brazenly told you led to nowhere and
was split by an unbrldged chasm, would you follow him,
you striking miners? Well, that is about what you are
doing right now in this Bisbee strike.
You don't believe it?
. That's too bad for you. Every one else KNOWS it
is true. Your biggest, best known union labor leaders
know it Ask them. Ask Moyer.
The cards were stacked against you by your own
leaders before they dealt you your hand. The longer
you stay the more you lose. FOR YOUR MONEY, AS
REPRESENTED BY YOUR LOST WAGES, IS THE
ONLY MONEY ON THE BOARD.
Your leaders have already publicly declared, and
shown by their Jerome perfidy, that they are not striking
for any fixed thing. They are striking, merely to strike
It is meat and drink to them. It is the breath of their
body. It has gone to their head and made them wild
and dangerous. They are like a whirling dervish with
a naked knife in his hand. Strikes are the only bones
they gnaw. Try to pin them down to any one certain,
fixed, definite gain possible to any striking miner, and
they will answer with a torrent of words that are as
empty as last year's birds-nests.
And what will you do with these wrods? Will you
save them, in place of your summer wages, to carry you
through the winter?

In another large room further up the street sit women
with deft fingers and gentle eyes who prepare and pin
and pile bandages of healing and helpfulness that go to
the Flanders battlefields in the form of hospital sup
plies. The women in the first room work for Uie muni
tion makers, and they serve their country well. The
women in the second room work for the Red Cross, and
they serve both their country and the Nazarene, who

CUTS WATER REVENUE.
One phase of the strixe situation at
Miami affects the farmers of the Salt
River valley in a material way. Ap
proximately $38,000 a month is being
lost to the Salt River valley project
by the closing of the mines, through
not using the power from the dam.
All pjwer contracts contain a strike
clause, providing that the mine oper
ators will not have to pay for power, if
any power beyond their control, pre
vents them from operating and using
the power for which their contract
with the reclamation service calls for.
The mines at Miami are the Vn ly
ones in the strike region which affects
the project The loss of this $38,0io a

brought before the council of the Salt i

INTIMIDATING ALL

Local Serbian Declares His
Countrymen Are Loyal But

Them Into Staying Away
rrom Their Work.
That the Serbians and Montenegrins
of the Warren District are very desir
eous of working in the local mines and
thereby aiding their country's ally
the United States Is the opinion ad
vanced by one of the most prominent
of the local colony. Intimidation by
the Austrians is keeping the rank and
file of the Serbians and Montenegrins
from returning to work.
"The Serbian people are the most
loyal in Southern Europe to their
country", said the local man. "Dur
ing the Balkan wars and during the
present conflict there nationalism has
not been questioned. " A great major
ity of them realire that the United
States at the present time, is aiding
their fatherland in every way possible
and will become the motive power
whereby the dream of the Slavonian
races, in Southern Europe, will be
come a fact.
"On the other hand we see the Aus
trian at work. These men, some of
whom are naturalized, desire only to
see any industrial activity -that may
aid the United States and, conse
quently, Serbia, Greece, Montenegro,
and the other allies, crippled in every
way possible. To that end they have
intimidated the Serbian and Montene
grin workmen until the latter tv.o na
tionalities fear to turn around.
"The Serbians and Montenegrins are
allowing themselves to be used by the
Austrians against their own interests,
locally, and against their nation's in
terests. Austria has been the oppres
sor of the Balkan states for time im

Bisbee 'Molly Pitcher' Routs
Wobbly 'Pickets at Laundry
If there were just one hundred men
in this city with the spunk and cour
age of Mrs. Burgess, wife of one of the
miners, of the Copper Queen, the
"wobblies" would be on the run be
lore night. ' And they wouldn't stop
within the limits of Cochise county.
When Mrs. Burgess beard that the I.
W. W. outfit were picketing the War
ren laundry, during the strike flurry
there last Friday, and annoying the
girls as they went to work, she did not
stop to argue or exclaim about this
outrage, she acted at once.
The immortal Molly Pitcher, who
served a camion at the battle of Mon
mouth in the old Revolutionary days,
never had a thing on Mrs. Burgess.
This Bisbee miner's wife put on her
hat and jacket and started for the
scene of action. Joining eight girls
who were going to the laundry to
work, she asked their permission to
go with them. About fifty "wobbly"
pickets were on duty, when by every
law of organized labor and state and
nation they had no right there. At
the head of her small company Mrs.
Burgess marched like Marshal Ney at
the head of the Old Guard. Right into
the "wobbly"" line she charged!
And she scattered them right and
ltft. They fell back in dismay before
this one determined woman. She
struck at them and lashed them with
her tongue until they quailed.
"You cheap skates," she stormed.

business intercourse with any country
with which the United States is at

and providing for government seizure
of the property of alien enemies and :

ed something about being glad there

he backed away from her and her
whiplash tongue.
The "wobblies" gave up the picket
job on the laundry.
Another feature of this laundry
strike was the manner in which it was
started among the poor dupes of Mexi
can girls by "wobbly" vultures. Noth-
ing more unscrupulous or mean or
' cruel could be conceived in connection
with a strike. They "promised these
' girls if they would quit work at two
dollars a day that they would give
j them three as long as they staid out.
; The Mexican girls quit, believing, in
their empty declarations. ,
,' A few days later one of these girls
came to the Manager Vance Johnson,
' asking for her place back and declar-
' ing she was hungry.
"What about that three dollars-a-
' day pay you were to draw on strike?"
' asked Mr. Johnson.
i "E-h-h-h " explained the girl, hold-
. ing up her hands, palms down, and
shaking her head sadly.
A section which would have prohib

ed States and enemy territory was
stricken out and the provisions re
stricting firms In neutral countries
were modified so that such firms would
be leached by the act only if they
had Inter-related business relations

the ocean freight rates they have been

that high freight charges can do to
make the war a failure, to make it im

mated population of 6,504,185 must
give 43.3S2 of the 625,000 young men to
be drafted.
A city with 25,000 population would
be required to give 166 men. The ap
portionment would be subject to slight
allowances for alien enemies, for men
who have volunteered an d for other
causes.
The population estimates far from
attempting to show actual populations,
simply are improvised figures reached
by considering the number of regis
trants in each sub-division as 9.32
per cent of the population, since the
total number registered, 9.859,382, was
9.32 per cent of the total estimated
population, 103.635.300. The process
resulted in large dummy population
showings for cities with war indus
tries where there has been a recent
inflow of workmen without their fam
ilies. Since the figures are based on
the number of men available for mil
itary service, however, officials con
sider the estimates as far as bases for
apportionment.
Population Estimates.
Pleas for exemption of any man
need not be made by him, but may be
entered by a wife, other dependent,
employer or any other third person,
the provost marshal general's office
explained. It is also explained that any
registered man absent from his home
district need not return for personal
examination but may be ordered by
his home board to be examined else
where. The dummy population estimates in

SLAVS DASH AFTER
FLEEINGAUSTRIANS
(Continued From Page One)
Further inland near Lombertzyde
the Germans did not have as much suc
cess. After gaining some advanced
positions the British threw the attack
ers back to their own lines by a coun
ter attack. Whether the German ef
fort is another attempt to reach Dun
kirk or Calais or is merely a stroke i'j
offset a probable British offensive has
not developed.
The latest British official statement
does not mention additional Infantry
fighting on this sector and says be
German artillery Are has diminished.
German attempts southeast )t Arras
and in the vicinity of Lens on Wed
nesday were without success.
Italians Again Advance
Violent artillery fighting marked
Wednesday on the Aisne and Cham
pagne fronts in France and east of
the Meuse in the Verdun region
Northwest of Selo, on the Carso, the
Italians have occupied the Austrian
town 'of Dolina.
A slight decrease in the effective
ness of the submarine campaign
against British shipping is noted in
the weekly report of British losses.
Fourteen 'merchant vessels of. over
1600 tons were sunk the last week in
comparison with 15 the previous
week. Under 1600 tons three were
lost, a decrease of two. With one ex
ception the loss is the lowest of any
week since Great Britain began issu
ing weekly reports of shipping losses
four months ago.
Defeat Admitted
LONDON, July 11. Admission by
the Austrians of a defeat at the hands
of the Russians is contained in a mes
sage from Austrian war press head
quarters as forwarded from Amster
dam by the Central News. It says:
"For two days our troops repulsed
strong Russian attacks. In trenches
which had been destroyed by artillery
fire one division defended itself
against attacks by superior Russian
column. But when fresh Russian re
serve j were 'jrc-ught into action our
troops were compelled to retreat gi
ing up their first line."

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 11. Newly Institut
ed war emergency curbs on trading at ! Keweenaw
Kansas City and St. Louis together
with a prospective additional check on
transactions here brought about much
nervousness today in the corn mar
ket About breaking all high price rec
ords for the season. Quotations closed
unsettled at to 2 net advance
with September 159 to 159 and
December 121 to 121. Wheat fin
ished off to a like advance at 203
for July and 191 for September.
Oats gained 34 to 2 and provisions
were unchanged to 10 cents lower.
Buying on the part of shorts carried
corn prices sharply upgrade and then
a break ensued on word that a meet
ing of Chicago Board of Trade direc
tors had been called. Rains in Texas
and Oklahoma failed to offset reports
that irreparable damage had been done
in Oklahoma and that a drought area
extended northward to the Dakotas.
Wheat swayed with corn but kept
within narrow limits. Harvesting of
winter wheat was said to be. making
favorable progress and there also was
improvement fn the general condition
of the spring crops. In the oats crowd
the chief infiuence was the fact that
despife numerous fluctuations the corn
market averaged higher. The bearish
field reports regarding oats were thus
more than counterbalanced.
- Provisions received only meagre
support. Some of the best recent
buyers were caught In the selling.
Cash trade was said to be disappoint
ing to volume.

NEW YORK, July 11. In some
stocks, especially the motor and ship
ping gains were recorded and in the
final dealings, shorts were exercised
over the firmness of the list. It was
evident that the short Interest was
large and the bulk of today's buying
ing was for short account, although
there was a moderate Increase In the
outside inquiry In steel. The belief
In some quarters being that the steel
manufacturers and government offici
als who conferred today on price of
.steel, will arrive at a conclusion sat
isfactory to alL The shipping shares
under the lead of the Marines were
strong on a revival of the talk that a
plan may be evolved to wipe out the
arrea-range approximating 78 cent of
stock; of the Marine Preferred. The
Russian war news was highly favor
able. There was nothing to Indicate that
a definite peace move on the part of
Germany. The news as a whole is In
terpreted in different ways, but the
majority of leading Interests seem to
think that the news as It is being re
ceived will promote a betterment In
the Industrial even to some temporary
depressions may be seen In other
lines.
