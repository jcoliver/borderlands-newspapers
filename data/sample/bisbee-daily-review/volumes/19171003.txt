ETALIATIO
BY PEOPLE OF
Government is Criticised for
Its Failure to Exact Repris
ais rrom tne Uermon reo-
ple for Air Raids.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. Oct. 2. In last night's
raid, 10 persons were killed and 38
Injured.
Firing of guns and occasional - ex
plosion of bombs are becoming mat
ter of fact occurrences with London
ers who, while heeding official warn
ings to take cover, show no signs of
panic.
People Hurry Home.
The people have accomodated them
selves to the enforced alteration in
their method of living and are hurry
ing home at the close of the working
hours to take an early dinner and pre
pare to spend the evening In the se
curity of their homes or in the great
er safety afforded by the protection
of the subways, the basements and
other underground refuges. Many
carry wraps and food and make them
selves as comfortable as the circum
stances will permit in the corridors
of the big hotels, which are becoming
a favorite place for the residents, the
walls affording protection against fly
ing glass. A large proportion of the
people continue their usual work
Last night, for example, the delivery
carts continued on their rounds, the
drivers- taking cover when the bom
bardment became intense, only to pro
ceed whn the guns at intervals ceas
ed firing.
Government Criticized.
The London press is becoming
strongly critical of the government.
Semi-official explanations that the
British cannot spare machines for re
ciprocal raids are questioned by the
Northcliffe newspapers, the Daily Ex
press and others which point out that
the Gfrmans are able to spare air
craft for raiding England and have
enough along the battle lines to give
the British a continuing fight "for
supremacy in the air.
It is argued that the Germans evi
dently have out-built the British in
aircraft and may be expected to con
tinue in an Increasing scale and im
prove the types of their machines
while the British are trying to catch
up with them. Predictions that this
would be the case were made months
ago by some of the newspapers and
by experts like -Lord Montague of
Beaulieu. Lord Montague also pre
dicts that the Germans will soon pass
t.be experimental stage of operations
and be able to attack London in all
kinds of weather, nearly every night.
Several theatres which advertised
performances last night withdrew
them at the last moment, mainly be
cause only a handful of people appear
ed. Others went through their per
formances in the presence of a few
persons but removed patrons in the
galleries to the ground floor.
Just as the guns began to roar, an
ambulance train with wounded from
France arrived at the London station.
Red Cross workers rapidly unloaded
f'e train and carried the men to shelt
er as glass broken by shrapnel com
menced to fall to the platform.
Several bombs fell in the river in
the southwest district while the roof
of a building in which a large number
of people sought cover was damaged.
No one was injured.
Question Considered.
The Evening Standard states "on
the highest authority" that the gov
ernment is paying special attention
to the question of reprisals for Ger
man air attacks on London and other
places.
It says:
"There is no qualification about the
decision of the government to under
take very effective reprisals at the
earliest moment consistent with Tie
advice of the high military command."
People Warned.
The Wilhelmshaven Tageblatt pub
lishes two pages of advice warning
the people against possible air raids
by the entente aviators.

CHICAGO. Oct. 2. Two more ar
rests of members of the I. W. W. for
whom the federal government officials
have been looking since their indict
ment a week ago were reported today.
They were Grover H. Perry, taken in
Salt Lake City, and John Ahleen, ar
rested in Minneapolis.
I. W. W. Described
Copies of the indictment returned
by the grand jury were made public
today. It describes the organization
known as the I. W. W. as composed
of 200,000 persons, mostly laborers in
the industries necessary to the exist
ence and welfare of the people of the
United States transportation, min
ing, meat packing, canning, lumber
ing, farming, livestock, fruit, vege
table and cotton raising.
Itt Aims
The indictment further defines the
members of the organization as defin
irg themselves as the "worKers" and
the "proletaria," and describing all
other classes of society as "capital
ists," the "capitalistic class," tho
"master class," the "ruling class," "ex
ploiters of the workers," "bourgeolse,"
and "parasites." The purpose of the
organization was to abolish the latter
class and gain for the former control
and owenrshlp of all property, "such
abolition to be accomplished, not by
political action or with any regard to
risht or wrong, but by the continual
and persistent use and employment
of unlawful and forcible means and
methods, involving threats, assaults,
injuries, intimidation and violence
upon the property the other classes,
and finally the forcible revolutionary
overthrow of all existing governmen

Secretary Baker indicated today
that no decision had been reached as

CLIFTON, Oct 2. The three

making preparations for a com

today and includes the men em
ployed in the various departments
of the three companies who have
been on salaries since the strike
was called July 1.
The strike, which was expected
to end October 1, is still in
progress. The strikers claim that
the reason (or continuing the
strike was the fact that all men
on strike were not promised em
ployment when work was re
sumed. On September 22 the com
panies announced their readiness
to accept the terms agreed to be
tween the federal mediators and
the operators. The strikers were
ordered to resume work October
1, and had notified the operators
through their grievance commit
tee of their intention. However,
when it was learned all of the
strikers would net be re-emp!oyed
it was decided to continue the
strike, with pickets out and ef
forts made to prevent the men
from returning to the mines. Many
of the craftsmen and othed Amer
ican employes reported for work
at the concentrators and smelters,'1
but owing to the inability of the
companies to operate the mines
the plants could not be operated.

F
AIRMAN KILLED
ON WEST FRONT
Lieutenant Vosse, Missing
Since Late In September,
Identified. Was Killed By
British Airplane Pilot
(By Review Leased Wire)
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE AND BELGIUM. Monday,
October 1. The body of the famous
German aviator, Lieutenant Vosse who
was recently reported in a German
official communication as missing, has
been found within the British lines and
British airmen have already dropped
messages behind the German front,
giving notification of his death.
Vtosse was killed September 23
while engaged in a spectacular com
bat with a British airman. It is a
peculiar coincidence that the famous
French airman. Captain Guynemer lost
his life about the same time in battle
over enemy territory and was reported
missing until the Germans found and
identified the body.
The opponent of Vosse is one of the
most brilliant British aviators who for
the purposes of this narrative may be
referred to as Brown that not being
his real name. Here is the story:
The Story.
A number of British planes were pa
trolling on the twenty-third, flying at
a height of 7,000 feet when one of them
was attacked by a German rednosed
Albatross and a triplane. It appear
ed later that Vosse was the pilot of
the triplane. Two other planes rush
ed up and engaged these tVj, with a
third enemy scout who appeared on
the scene. About eleven other enemy
planes were waiting at a distance to
join in the fray but did not attack as
some ten British planes were circling
about keeping them off.
Third Enemy Join.
The third enemy scout who had join
ed in the combat vanished but the Al
batross and the triplane fought in won
derful form. Brown singled ju: the
triplane and a hard fight ensued.
Brown got in a number "jf good bursts
from his machine-gun and several
times had to change drums on his gun,
so furiously was he firing.
Opponent Circle.
For a long time the two opponents
circled, dived and maneuvered for po
sition and so close were they at times
that only a few inches separated their
wings. Eventually Brown got a little
above Vosse and made for triplane,
the British airman working his ma
chine gun steadily all the time.
Narrow Escape.
Vosse passed Brown's right wing by
inches and dived. The British air
man wheeled into position and observ
ed the German gliding westward with
his engine shut off. He dived again

The Germans also attacked, during
the night, south of the Ypres Roulers
railway in the neighborhood of Zonne
beke, but were repulsed. The last 24
hours have been bitter ones for th
enemy along the Ypres battle front.
Not only have the Germans suffered
a stinging defeat but this defeat has
been accompanied by grievous losses
in men. The tremendous fire to which
they were subjected by the artil'ery,
rifles and machine guns was a revela
tion even to those .accustomed to

great British war machine.

North of the Ypres-Roulers railway
the German artillery played heavily
on the British front areas. The cor

the artillry activity was intense.

BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE AND BELGIUM, Oct. 2
(By the Associated Press.) The bad
ly punished German troops east of
Ypres today were largely resting on
their arms after reverses suffered yes
terday when they attempted in a se
ries of air counter-a'tacks to driva
the British back. Possibly the desig
nation "resting" is a misnomer, for
the enemy was sitting under a terrific
bombardment from hundreds of bis
guns which were deluding his back
and forward areas with hish' explo
sives and turning his fastnesses in-o
twisted mases of debris, which forced
the German to defenses farther back.
Any of the, nerve-racked, half.
tunned German prisoners who have
lived under tnese Donmaramenis ra
tell of the tragedy now being enacted
along the German front in this section
of Flanders. Thanks to the German
counter-attacks, there has been hard
ly a moment's cessation of the intense
artillery work of the British since last
Thursday's action, in which Field
Marshal Haig's troops executed their
latest offensive.
Defenses Demoralized
Captured Germans say that their
forward defenses have been greatly
demoralized by this ceaseless pound
ing. Relief and ration parties venture
out, to be turned back or to make
their miserable way forward by cir
cuitous routes to the men holding thn
advanced siell holes, who have often
compelled to hold on without water
or proper food. Badly needed ammu
nition has frequently never reached
its destination.
Every Approach Covered
Every approach to the German lines
is covered by British guns, making the
movement on enemy infantry an ardu
ous process. Naturally the question
arises what effect all this is having
on the morale of the German troops.
It is generally admitted among the
pi isoners that the morale of their men
has deteriorated since the beginning

WASHINGTON, Oct. 2. Liberty
loan financing was marked today by
the over-subscription of the largest
issue of short-time treasury certifi
cates of indebtedness put out by the
government, $400,000,000. The certifi
cates bear 4 per cent interest, mature
December 15, and may be redeemed
sooner upon ten days' notice.
Total Not Stated
The amount of the over-subscription
was not stated by the treasury to
night, but the taking of the entire
issue, which is $100,000,000 or one
third greater than any previous offer
ing, with a margin to spare, was re
garded as presaging the success of
the second Liberty bond issue.
Today's offering of certificates bring
the total up to $1,250,000,000, or more
than 40 per cent of the minimum 6et
by Secretary McAdoo for the second
Liberty loan. With the proceeds of
the latest certificate issue available,
the government will have anticipated
the second Liberty loan receipts to
the extent of $1,250,000 and much of
the money will have been paid out.
Highly Commended
The issuance of certificates of in
debtedness in blocks from $200,000,000
to $400,000,000 is highly regarded by
the treasury officials as a method of
alleviating stress on the money mar
kets which result from the suddfra
withdrawal of a considerable propor
tion of a large loan.
Continuation of the enthusiasm
which marked the opening day of the
Liberty loan campaign was reported
to the treasury tonight from many
sections of the country.

McAdoo Warn.
CHICAGO, Oct. 2. A warning that
the United States was not in the war
merely for altruistic purposes but was
fighting for her sacred rights, her in
tegrity as a nation and her security
for the future was served on a large
Chicago audience tonight by Secretary
McAdoo in urging that generous sup
port be given the second Liberty Loan.
Secretary McAdoo declared that Ger
many, in actual fact bad been at war
wi:h the United States long before a
state of war officially was recognized
and Germany's destroying American
lives through sinking ships was in
each case, he said, an act of war. "We
should have been at war long since
with eGrniany,"' he continued. 'Pres
ident Wilson, in his eagerness to save
America from this colossal conflict,
went to the extreme of l'jrebearance
and patience in order to escape with
peace and honor, postponed the con
flict until it was no longer possible
to avoid the Issue."

tal between $50,000,000 and $60,000,000.
Prominent among the new agencies
through which appeals for bond sub
scriptions are to be made, announced
today, is the entire state educational
system. Liberty L'oan meetings are
planned for each school room in the
state. Corporations whose sombined
payrolls amount to many millions of
dollars weekly have been banded to
gether by the formation of an industri
al committee. This body will direct
the campaign intended to reach the
thousands of small investors those
who will buy the bonds of $50 and $100
denominations. Large subscriptions
unofficially reported today were: The

$1,000,000; the Atchison, Tcpeka and
Santa Fe railroad company, $5,000,000;
annd the Prudential Insurance com
pany of Newark. N. J., $7,500,000.
Suffragette Against Bonds.
BALTIMORE. Oct. 2. Mrs. Henry
O. Havemeyer, of New York, a member
ot the advisory council of the national
woman's party, in an address before a
meeting of 150 suffragettes here today
appealed to the suffragists not to lift a
finger in aid of the Liberty Loan. She
declared she would n'jt work for it, al
though she had served on the commit
tee of women which toured the country
for the first Liberty Loan.
"I haven't the nerve to ask money,"
she said, "for a battler for democracy
when we who demand true democracy
are thrown into jails for ti'oing so."
The suffragists present greeted her
with applause and fost of them de
clared they were ready to follow her
advice.
Mrs. Abby Scott Baker, of Washing
ton, an official of the national woman's
party, urged the women to boycott the
loan. She said she had three sVns in
the service of the government but that
made no difference.
Buy Now
BOSTON, Oct. 2. "Buy now" was

Thomas B. Smith and eight others
charged with conspiracy to murder
and other crimes in connection with
the fifth ward killing. Altogether 17
men are under arrest here and in New
York in connection with the political
feud.
Tonight Senator Vare gave a state
ment in- which he said everything Ma
loney swore to as far as it concerned
the Vares was an "absolute lie," and
was enly part of the general "frame
up," he warned the people of Phila
delphia in a statement two days ago.
Maloney testified that Deutsche came
to his office and wanted to engage 18
"husky" men for work in the fifth
ward. Deutsche, according to Maloney,
said a gang of men were coming from
the tenth ward to "rough things" and
he wanted to protect himself and his
followers. Maloney said Detusch in
formed him that Senator Vare would
furnish the money and when he went
to Vare's office he saw Congressman
Vare, who told him, the witness said,
that Deutsch was well supplied with
funds and everything would be all
right.
Maloney also said he met Senator
Vare on the street and was told by
him to see Captain Tate of the city
detective bureau and arrange to have
detectives sent to the ward on pri
mary day. Th witness told of the
events of primary day and described
his efforts to get the alleged gunmen
out of the city. Two days after the
primary; Maloney said, he received p.
special delivery letter containing n
$1,000 bill.
The hearing will continue tomorrow.

ate raised it to $2,416,000,000. The
conferees draft increased the to'.al as

the house and $12S,000,000 above the
senate.

The bill now is estimated to raise
about $850,000,000 from incomes, corpo
rate and individual and about one bil

Full Generals to
Be Created Soon
by U.S. Congress
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2. Revival of
the grade of full general is piannea Djf
the war department to provide suitable
rank for Major-General John J. Persh
ing, commanding the American expedi
tionary forces in France.
It wa3 learned tonight that Secre
tary Baker already has submitted the
department's program, which includes
provision for the title of General IV) be
held by the officer serving as chief of
staff and the making of several lieu-tenant-generaU
to command corps un
der General Pershing, to the senate
miliary committee and that legisla
tion carrying it into effect is to be
pressed for prompt passage when con
gress reconvenes in December.
Title Extinct
But four American army otllcers
have borne the title of general Wash
ington, Grant, Sherman and Sheridan,
and only a few have been lieutenant
generals. Since General Shcrmau
lied in 1S88 the rank of general has
been extinct.
Promotion Necessary.
Secretary Baker explained to the
committee that early promotion of
General Pershing was essential, be
cause he is to command a great army
of many corps, entitling him to the
highest military title and in 'order to
obviate embarrassment resulting froD
the high rank of the allied command
ers with whom he is associated.
Action Expected.
That General Pershing would be pro
moted has been taken for granted in
army circles ever since he was select
ed by President Wilson for the su
preme trust o Heading America's sol
diers against the Gennans, though the
general belief has been that lieutenant
general would be the rank.
Although the United States govern
ment always has been slow about Con
ferring high rank in the army, it is
realized at the war department and in
congress that Pershing probably will
lead the greatest lighting force Ameri
ca has ever put into the held.
As soon as the forces in France have
reached a strength which will justify
the action, the divisions will bu organ
ized into army corps, and a licutenaut
generai should command each corps.
and got a good shot at his opponent;
then followed this with a heavV burst
from his gun and Vosse did a slight
righ;-liand turn and cowinued to
down until he disappeared.
End Of Battle.
This ended the adventure so far as
Brown was concerned. He flew away,
not knowing who his opponent had
been or what had become of him. La
ter the shattered machine was found
and the body identified.
Much Fighting Lately.
There has been much fighting in the
air recently and the aviators have had
some remarkable experiences. One
British lieutenant, flying last Wednesj
day, had just forced the enemy fj ptill
down a big balloon when he was en
gaged by machine-guns from the
ground. He dived on the gunners and
fired more than a hundreds rounds, dis
persing the crew, who fled, leaving two
of their number stretched on the
ground. Continuing onward, the lieu
tenant had nine separate combats with
enemy planes. Eight of these were in
decisive,' but in the other case he
brought d'jwn the German.
Returns Home.
In this last combat he got right on
the enemy plane, first killing the ob
server, then firing into the pilot and
engines. The enemy plane spun down
to earth. The British airman engaged
in still further fighting and returner!

The Warren District Commercial
jlub takes exception to the statement
of one "husky and honest milkman"
quoted in an editorial in Tuesday's
paper. The milkman stated that milk
was high mainly because bran here
abouts cost $90 a ton.
The commercial club is willing to
admit that the milkman was husky,
but they're a little dubious about. h:s
honesty. Their figures show that Ari
zona bran is selling for $65 a ton, and
that Colorado bran (red) is selling
for $60 a ton. These are Increase
over last year's prices, the former
having sold for $4S ami the latter for
44. However, there's $25 difference
between $65 and $itO, and the commer
cial club is anxious to correct an er
ronious .statement that might eventu
ally work some harm.

PITCHING STAFF OF
WHINING TEAMS ARE
KEYSTONES OF SERIES
New Ycrk and Chicago Both
Have Excellent Stcffs. Theti
Work WiU Undoubtedly
Determine World Champ3.
NEW YORK. Oct. 2. No single fac
tor has a greater bearing upon the out
come of a world series than the pitch
ine; staff of the two teams involved
ThiR is an accepted axiom of p.'jfer
tiional baseball which is particularly
true of the two clubs which are sched
uled to begin their battle for the pre
mier honors of the diamond at Chicago
on Saturday.
While neither the New York Nation
rls nor the Chicago Americans cui'e
equal the machine-like perfection ia
balance and play which has disting
uished several preceding combinations
in the i-eries. they are, nevertheless,
i-trong aggregations which appear to
be evenly matched. Under these cir-.
cums'.ances any edge or advantage
which may develop is likely to appear
in the work of the hurling forces.
So far as numerical strength is con-
j cerned th?re is little if any choice as
both the White. Sox and the Giants
! have seven twirlers who have worked
I in the box with reasonable frequency
j during the season. The records
j show that manager Rowland sent Dan
( forth in:o 46 games; Clocct into 44;
I Faber 35; Russell, 33; Williams, 39;
i Henz, 17; and Scott. 24. Wolfgang,
j although ra'ed as a pitcher, has done
I but 11: tie work on the mound against
i opposing teams having been used to
pitch to his team males during prac
tice. j For the New York Nationals, Dem
: aree las figured in 34 games, including
his Chicago National 1917 record; An
j derson 33: Schupp, 32; Perri't, 31;
i Sallee, 29; Ilenton and Tesreau, 28
each. It will be seen from the fore
going figures that tlie Giants have
shifted their hurlers more frequently
! than the White Sox but the results do
not appeir to indicate that this had
j any outstanding effect upon their win
j ning ability. In the matter "if right
' and left hrind twirlers the situation if
I again a stalemate for each club carries
and mcs four right hand delivery box-
men and three por.side or southpaw
pitchers.
How those rlgh' and left handers
will fare against opposing bat wicldcrs-
i problematical. Kduie Collins, Weav
er and Jackson have all shown ability
to hit portside pitching which "they
i and other member.) of the White Sox
i (Mm tk ro lilffli' 11 Inrp til a inaiiiritc
of the games if McOraw's plans do no:
miscarry. Felsch is another Chicago
player who has shown that left band
ers have ro terrors for him. The team
hatting average against portside hurl
ing is close to 200 which appears to
give the-n an advantage over the Gi
ants in this respect.
The New York players, however, be
1'eve that .hey will face Cicotte and
Faber. boMi right hnaders, n.'jr? fre
quently than the White rjx soutn
piv's. Tor V:'..t reason they are par

these two pitchers, especially the so

even the American League batters re
garding the methods or means by
which Cicotte gets the wierd curves
and breaks which has made his deliv
ery so effective this season. It is cer
tain that the Giants win scrutinize I
L'oth the ball and breaks with extraor-!
dinary care.in the coming contesis. j
Faber's "moist ball" delivery is also !
'certain to bother the New York bat
ters especially if the pitcher can main
tain control. Russell and Lanfc;th are
the formidable left nanders likely to be
used against the MtGrawites.
The Giants' s.rongest box quartet
will probably be composed of Sallee,
Schupp, and Benton, all left handers,
with Barritt the leading right bander.
Anderson, Tesreau and "Demaree will
form the second string and any one of
this trio may prove unexpectedly ef
fective under certain weather and sky
conditions. It will be seen, however,
that the Giants' leading boxr.ien are
southpaws and if the records are cor
rect the White Sox will not b so han
dicapped before this form jf delivery
as would appear to be the general im
pression. So far as other departments of play,
in which the pitchers are concerned,
.here do':S not appear to be any great
advance one way or the other. In
Lauing and fielding there is little mar
gin on either side. Th Giants twirlers
id .'e a few more double plays fj their
credit and the White Sox hurlers have
he edge on stolen bases.
CIGAR ASHES FATAL
TO FORD WHEN THEY
Bisbee Man is Forgetful of the
Fact That Gasoline is Vola
tile and Highly Inflamable.
Hb Memory Improved.
A man stopped with his car at the
Fcrd garage in Johnson addition yes
terday afternoon for some gas. "Jim
my," the demon gas mm at the ga
rage, had four gallons in the tank,
and was letting the fifth one trickle
through the hese, when 'this casual,
careless, cursory gent, standing on the
running board of lr's car, thrust his
hand behind him and with a simple
little movement flicked the ashes from
his lighted cigar into the mouth of
the tank. Bing! Bang! 'Siss-boom!
"Jimmy" dropped his flaming hose,
not being up on the latest tactics for
liquid fire offensives as practiced now
adays on the Flanders battle front,
and cut the gas off from the big tank
and beat it.
The owner of the car, he of the
lighted cigar, fell off the running
board and crawled beyond the range
of the ycung volcano he had started.
People crowded up around the blaze
that was raging at the mouth of a
200-gallon gas tank, but a special dis
pensation protected them; the side
walk did not raise like entrenchments
above an exploded mine. It was a
narrow escape for the entire garage,
but the fire was extinguished without
very much damage.

Wednesday Morning, October 3, 1917.
The coal situation looks dark for the Warren District
this winter. Neither New Mexico or Colorado will agree
to furnish coal at the prices set by the government.
Boy, page President Wilson's coal administrator.
It has been estimated that the allies combined can
muster twenty-four and one-half million tons of shipping
outside of their warships at this time. Pretty -fair ton
nage. "A right smart considerable." as they used to say
in Missouri in the rural districts. The U-boats have a lot
of work to do. And the United States has contracted to
add six millions to this total within the year.
Theodore Roosevelt is serving ills country as well or
better than if he had raised his division and gone to
France. His voice and pen are striking mighty blows at
traitors and slackers and incompetents everywhere. He
has branded the rebellious worklngman and the covetous
capitalist alike with a white hot brand. He is striking
every day at national deliquencies and applauding nation
al virtues. The colonel has never commanded more re
spect and attention and wielded more Influence for good
than he is doing right now.
Bulgaria wants to quit. But she must fight on until
her treasury is bankrupt, her army destroyed and her na
tional boundaries shrunk to pitiful proportions. Her
rulers guessed wrong and the people must pay. She
plunged her arms into Serbian blood up to the elbows
and the stain cannot be washed away by regrets and
fears. Bulgaria and Turkey, the two greatest dupes
6ince Esau sold his birthright for a mess of pottage, will
curse the kaiser and the war for a hundred years to come
with undiminished fluency and fervor.
Six air raids over London in eight days with a total
of fifty dead and two hundred and forty injured is the
boast of Berlin at this time. Women and children maimed
and mangled by the score. What an exploit! What a
triumph in the noble art of war. A government that will
deliberately kill women and children with no military
success at stake cannot expect to be negotiated with
by Christian nations. There is only one next step, and
that is another offensive, and another, and another, ua
til the Prussian boars are beaten down into their own
muck.
Bavarian troops are bearing the brunt of the fighting
on the western front this fall. In the sector where the
British guns are doing the most deadly damage, there
can always be found the Bavarians. Prisoners taken in
the most desperate counter charges always assay 16 per
cent Bavarians. What mourning there must be in this fair
province of the Central Empire. Prussian troops are
used only at rare intervals. Prussian officers keep in
places of safety. But the Bavarians, for them there is
no rest from the slaughter, no intervals in the harvest of
death. And Bavaria, by the way, is said to be almost ripe
to join Austria in revolt against the Prussian.
Von Hindenburg, the idol of the German people, has
been a complete and stupendous failure all of the two
years he has been in supreme command of the central
empires' armies. The fact admits of no argument. "His
sole bid for fame rests upon Ms defeat of the Russians
at the Mazurian Lakes and other places to numerous to
mention. But beating the Russians is no criterion of a
commander's greatness. It is not a much harder job
than beating a chenp carpet. Consider Hindenburg's rec
ord on the west front. His first summer witnessed the
opening of the Somnie ofiensive that ended last October
with the Germans reeling back a beaten army when the
rains came and saved them. Last spring Hindenburg
made his famous strategic retreat. All summer long he
has been pounded back on the western front, barely
holding his own in some places, losing all the high
ground in others. Not a single battle has he won in the
west since he has been in command. Petain and Haig
have bested him in every encounter of any magnitude. It
would be worth while to know what the German people
really think of their invincible idol at this time. His war
machine will never be as great or as strong as it has
been. It will need more repairs next year than it did
this, when he used up all of the sixteen divisions of his
strategic reserve. Predictions are bold and frequent
that the fat Prussian with the imposing pompadour will
be supplanted before the big wtsash comes next spring.
As evidence of our woeful lack of preparedness, witness
the case of the recruits at Fort Funston having to use
wooden guns with which to drill. Our small arms fac
tories have just begun to make deliveries, and yet we
broke off relations with Germany some eight months
ago. It is easy enough to criticise the overworked, over
whelmed war department, and every one is doing it, bat
this lack of rifles points to some woeful piddling and
mismanagement. No war department since the world
was made, has ever had bigger burdens to carry on such
short notice than has the Washington bureau of ordi
nance. But it still remains as a fact that American fac
tories have been making rifles for the allies for three
years, and there was at hand when America declared
war scores and scores of plants that has been changed
already for peaceful occupations to the manufacture of
munitions and weapons of war. Our total output of rifles
should be twenty thousand a day at this time instead of
three, as must be reported in a mournful voice.
Congressional appropriations this year exceed the wild
est dreams o fextravagance ever dreamed by prince or
potentate before. The Roman Caesars used to put many
secestres in circulation in their day, but all the Roman
emperors together, and the kings of Persia and Babylon
thrown in, did not spend in one hundred years a small
part of the money it takes to conduct this war for a
month. Consider: Congress has authorized the expendi
ture of eight and one-half millions to train the draft army;
162 millions for Hoover; eleven millions to promote agri
culture; seven billions for the army; one billion for
shipping; seven billions for the allies; one and one-half
billions for the navy. Heavens, what a total! Croesus
himself could scarcley have fitted out a regiment for war
today and kept it in ammunition. And yet the German
papers and statesmen are feeding stuff to the German
people about America not being wholeheartedly in this
war. The American has placed his money in the pot
and he will stay until it is opened and the Kaiser has
to leave the game.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
GRIEF GULTURE.
Ueglected bOrrows never thrive;
they must be nursed if they'd survive.
I sometime sit around and mope, like
one who's said farewell to hope; I
grouch around and scrowl and sulk,
and dish up sighs and groans in bulk.
If people note this woe of mine, and
try to stop the flow of brine, I sign
more deeply than before, more furious
ly walk the floor. There is no fun
in being blue, if no one stops to pity
you. If, when I grieve and tear my
hair, the folks around me do not care,
but say, "We wouldn't give a cent for
any sulky skate's lament," I wipe the
tear drops from my face, and leave the
well known wailing place. I 'plant
my sorrow right away, and smiling
greet the sunny day. NV hermit ever
has the peeves: no hermit ever sulks
and grieves. There must be company
for gloom; a lonesmoe sorrow will not
bloom. The man who sulks and broods
at home, like Manfred in a Byron
pome, would quit it if his kids and
wives would just pursue their work
day lives, and give no heed to hi3 de
spair, and act as if he were not there.
Not a word has been telegraphed or written about the
German or British fleets for many months. There has
been no sea fight in this greatest of wars since the Ger
man "victory" at Jutland in June of last year. . During the
first year of the great conflict there was plenty of fight
ing on the high seas. German raiders were hunted down
one by one, a British fleet was broken and then the Pri's
sian ships that won this victory were destroyed by Vice
Admiral Sturdee. For weeks at a time the sixteen-inch
guns of the peerless battleship, the Queen Elizabeth,
thundered against the Turkish defenses of Gallipoli.
English monitors bombarded the Belgian coast. German
flying squadrons were encountered every few months and
driven back to their base. But since the Jutland fight
only the submarine and the torpedo boat have turnel
powder on salt water, if the work of the Italian monitors
In the Gulf of Trieste be excepted. Will there be .me
great sea fight before the end of Ihe war? -The cxper-'s
used to predict it and analyze its possibilities a yoar
ago, but for many months now no word has appear.!
about the Grand Fleet or the kaiser's landlocked ships
of war that rock in an inglorious anchorage.
HE TOO IS SERVING.
(Collier's Weekly).
The oiler who watches the bearings of ti big driving
wheel, or the workman who drills rivet holes all day long
in the machine shop, sometimes pauses to sa yto himself:
"Why can't I be in the thick of it? Why should other
men no more patriotic than I, in the trenches and near
them, have all the big moments and the thrills, while I
go through the same meaningless drugery day after day?"
They may not phrase it thus, but such is the protest in
the back of their heads. They should get rid of that de
lusion. For every man who mixes with his daily steint
the desire to make it useful in winning the war is in hi
way a soldier. Remember what Daudet tells of the art
isan and his finished handiwork:
"Among the two thousand workmen of the town there
was perhaps not 'one who had not aided in the great work
according to his skill and his strength. But. they had
worked in isolation, each one by himself, groping his
way. . . .
"And now they saw their machine, standing before
them, complete, all its parts fitted together. And proud
they were of it! In a moment they surrounded it, salut
ing it with joyous laughter and triumphant cries. They
admired it as connoisseurs, stroked it with their rough
bands, caressed it, talked to it in their own rude dialect:
'Well, old girl, how goes it?' The founders pointed to
the enormous screws of bronze, saying: 'We cast them"
The smiths replied: 'But it was we who worked the iron,
arid mixed it with the drops of our sweat.' And the
braziers and riveters, not without justice. Hang tho
praises of the huge boiler coated with red lead like a
fighting elephant. If these boasted of the metal work it
self, the engineers, designers, and fitters prided them
selves just as much upon the form the whole had taken."
Even translation does not kill the spirit of this, the
spirit that Kipling voiced in "The Ship That Found Her
self" that the humblest rivet in the machine Is a mighty
as the whole machine. Our workers at home are till
rivets of the machine in the trenches.
LIFE
Only a storm tossed twig
Bearing a withered leaf;
Only a teardrop big
Telling a crushed heart's grief.
Only a tiny grain
Dropped from the golden sheaf.
Kindly the gentle rain
Sought it aud gave relief.
Only a tiny blade.
Only a line of green;
Fairylike dewdrops played
Diamond-bedecked its sheen.
Gentry the south wind blew
Smiling the sun bent low.
Pointing to life anew,
Crowned with a golden plow.

Ambrose Dizaboon, who is support

leeu years of. cge. in Tucson, prob
ably will be given a temporary d.s
uharge as the result of a telegram re
ceived Monday by the district exemp

I valley and mesa land is being cleared
by hundreds of men to be planted in
' guayule next January. Wells are be

been completed. The well is high up
above the river and a considerable dis
tance back, but furnishes an inex
haustifc'e supply and the water does
not drfcp an Inch. It is twen'y feet
dsep from the surface. Other wells
are proving just as good.
Isaac Aytrs, one of the circulators

I reckon I had about all the miserable

constipated all the time, frequently
had severe headaches, and the past
five years especially, my stomach ha
been so weak and out of order I
couldn't digset what I would eat and I

everything in the line of medicines ani
spent three months at the mineral

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct? 2. Corn bulged in
value today after an early show of
weakness. Reports from Texas had
absorbed all offerings of new corn
rave impetus to the upward swing.
Prices closed firm. 6g to lc net
hisher at 1.19 Decenrber and 1.16H
May. Oats gained b to lc, and pro
visions 10 to 25c.
Heavy selling, which took place at
the outset in corn, was ascribed to
increasing assurance that the bulk of
the crop had escaped danger from
frost, especially as no unseasonable
low temperatures seemed possible
during the next few days. Scantiness
of present supplies, however, acted
as a check, and there was a decided
veering away from the bear side after
mid-day.
Unfavorable weather and smallness
of country offerings gave independent
strength to oats. The rise in pro
visions was due chiefly to announce
ment of a big reduction in stocks of
meats at western packing centers.
Exclusive of SL Louis, the decrease
for September was 64,000,000 pounds.

Lzuela, de Frankfurter Zeitung pub
lishes what it asserts is the German
foreign office record of a conversa
tion on the South American situation
of February 18, 1903, between Presi
dent Roosevelt and the late Baron
Speck von Sternberg, the German am
bassador. nl this conversation President
Roosevelt is quoted as having said he
though . the best guarantee for the
amelioration oi aoutn American eon-
ditions would be the establishment of
a German state in southern Brazil.
Colonel Roosevelt in his luncheon
speech at Chicago said that in 1902
when Germany proposed a "tempo
rary" occupation cf Venezuela he sent
for the German ambassador and told
him that "that Venezuelan business
has been going on long enough and I
cannot afford to let it get to the point ;
where it will cause trouble." He ask-
ed the ambassador what Germany
meant by temporary possession and
the ambassador replied that be did
not feel at liberty to discuss such an
important question. He delivered the
following ultimatum:
"Tell, your government that in 10
days it must arbitrate the matter or
I will send Dewey down there."
The eGrman ambassador, according
to Colonel Roosevelt, said he coul l
not send such a message and he did
not think the president knew what it
would mean.
President Roosevelt said that if it
meant war Germany had chosen th
one spot where she could not fight .
the United States. The president then
ordered Admiral Dewey to be ready!
to sail in an hour's notice.
The ambassador again visited the '
president a week later and said ho'
had not dared send the message and ;
the president told him that he had
ordered Dewey to sail within 48 hours.
The ambassador said this would be an
awful thing for the United States, but
President Rosevelt retorted that it I
would be more awful for Germany.
Within 36 hours the ambassador again
returned to the president and inform -
ed him that Germany would arbitrate.

GIRLS! DRAW A MOIST
CLOTH THROUGH HAIR,
DOUBLE ITS BEAUTY
Try this! Hair gets thick,
glossy, wavy and beauti
ful at once. .
Immediate? Yes Certain? that's
the joy of it. Vjur hair becomes light,
wavy. Huffy, abundant and appears as
soft, lustrous and beautiful as a young
girl's after a Danderine hair cleanse.
Just try this moisten a cloth with a
little Danderire and carefully draw it
through your hair, taking one small
s rand at a time. This will cleanse
the hair of dust dirt or excessive oil,
and in just a few moments you have
doubled the beauty of your hair. A
delightful surprise awaits those whose
hair has been neglected ii is scraggy,
faded, dry, brittle or thin. Besides
beautifying the hair, Danderine dis
solves every particle of dandruff;
cleanses, purifies and invigorates the
scalp, forever stopping Itching and fall
ing hair, but what will please you most
will be after a few week's use, when
you see new hair fine and downy at
first yes but really new hair grow
ing all over the scalp. If you care for
pretty, soft hair, and lots of It, surely
get a 25 cent bottle of KnowlrUn's
Danderine from any drug store or to!
let counter and just try it. Adv.
for the year of $45,000,000. This was
chiefly before the blockade .but the
profits are reckoned for the year. The
National Navigation company paid
dividends of 76 per cent and the Hell
enic company paid the unheard-of
dividend of 165 per cent.
Bank shares have soired in the
same wcy during the year. So also
the big trading companies paid from
15 to 23 per cent dividends.
People even had money to spare to
buy foreign loans, and about 12,000,
000 francs of the French loans were
taken in Greece, 1.000,000 rubles of
the Russian loans, and similar
amounts of the British loan. New
baDks were founded to take care of the
growing business, and building opera
tions went ahead with a boom.
These conditions of boom and pros
perity strike all countries from time
to time, but how they should have
struck Greece when the government
vas in a state of steady convulsion
and the allied fleets were closing in
all around her, has been hard for the
experts to explain. One theory for
the high premium on Greek money
is that the presence of great numbers
of allied warships poured a flow of
foreign gold into the country. But
the chief reason is believed to be the
practice of economy. The blockade
and restrictions kept out a lot of high
priced luxuries. People lived simpler
and got along with their home prod
ucts. The outside world has heard much
of the troubles of Greece during the
last year. But this o'her side, the
material prosperity while the govern
ment was trembling, has not been so
much as heard of and Is in marked
contrast with the rest or war torn
Europe.
