Meeting; RequestFor Secret
Meeting Granted.
(By Review Leased Wire).
PARIS, June 1. (3:50 p.
m.) Premier Ribot today
announced in the French
chamber of deputies that the
government would not facili
tate the voyage of French So
cialists to the international
Socialist congress at Stock
holm. All the deputies, except the
Socialists stood and . cheered
when Premier Ribot added:
"Peace can come from vic
tory alone."
Continuing, the premier said:
"It is certain that in peace negotia
tions no party can take the place of
the government. The peace of tomor
row cannot be a peace of any party,
' neither of the Socialist party nor of
the Catholic party. As it concerns
France, it should be a Frttoch peace.
When the hour Oouies. the government
will ask the advice of your committee
and it will tell everything. The gov
ernment has a complete knowledge of
its responsibility.
Would Be Laughable.
"It would be laughable if one nought
to make the country and army believe
that peace could come from such con
ferences. Victory ai'jne can bring
peace. What would they think of us
in the United States if we allowed
Americans to believe there was weari
ness among us after three years of
war? Our energy must continue in
domitable." Premier Ribot then referred to what
he terms an "audacious and impudent
campaign" to spread reports that se
cret agreements had been signed with
Russia, adding:
"We shall ask the Russian govern
ment to publish all the document, in
question at an early date."
"It is even said," the premier ex
claimed, "that a secret convention with
Russia which is offensive and non-defensive
exists and that it was executed
by the president of the republic him
self. Gentlemen, this is an infamy."
The premier closed with the an
nouncement that the government was
ready to arrest certain elements
charged with inciting riots and that
the government also would see that
foreign residents in France did not
escape responsibility to the military
laws of their own countries.
Secret Session.
Marcel Caichin, the Socialist deputy,
arose after the premier had concluded
and said that the country could not be
told the whole truth. Deputy Caichin,
who recently returned from Russia,
said he had. brought documents from
Russia which he desired to lay before
a secret session of the chamber. The
secret session was voted by a large
majority and the galleries were
cleared.

WASHINGTON, June 1. The first
administration food bill, under consid

Debate today was limited by unani
mous consent to ten minutes, and no
senator will be permitted . to speak
more than once.
An amendment by Senator McCum
ber modifying the provision adopted
yesterday, making the holding and
storage of foodstuffs and other necessi
ties a felony, was adopted. The amend
ment specifically would permit storing
where no effort is made to cause a
shortage or affect the price.
Senator Fletcher's amendment to au
thorize the secretary of commerce to
engage in the catching and marketing
of fish to enlarge tue nation's food
supply was rejected.
Two amendments designed to pro
hibit speculation in food products were
introduced. One, by Senator Thomas,
would authorize the President 10 sus
pend gram exchanges where dealing in
futures is permitted, and the other
amendment, by Senator McKellar,
would forbid speculation.
Debate on a proposal by Senator Fall

WASHINGTON, June 1. Important
revisions in the plan for training the

that the half-million men to be called

Baker indicated that building would

four sites selected are at American
Lake, Wash.; Atlanta, , Ga.; Ayre,
Mass., and Wrightstown. N. J.
A more plentiful supply of canvas
than expected made it possible to put
some ot the troops under tents. A can
vas shortage was largely responsible
for the original plan to house the army
in wooden barracks, for army officials
have preferred tenting fiom the start.
Most of the tents used probably will
be placed at southern camps.
In making the announcement. Secre
tary Baker said also that forces in
excess of those which could be cared
for in the 16 cantonments would be
placed under canvas. This was taken
as referring to National Guard divi
sions, although the militia bureau has
received no instructions in tnis re
gard. Guards Are Needed.
There Is no indication of any inten
tion to alter the plan for formation Of
16 divisions of the guard. The ques
tion of filling these up to war strength
probably will not be settled until selec
tion of men for military service in
the draft army begins. It is possible
that it will be found at thai time, if
state forces have not been recruited
to full strength, to consolidate into a
smaller number of divisions; but un
der the law either the regulars or
guard can be filled up with men from
the selected lists if that is desired.
Meantime the National Guards of
the eastern portion of the country will
be drafted into the federal armies ou
July 15.
All of the guard units will have been
drafted into service by August 5. That
does not mean, however, that all will

in forming a coalition ministry.
It was reported upon reliable
authority that the new premier
offered to allow Sir Wilfred Lau
rier to name half the members of
the new government and to grant
the Liberals authority equitable
to that given the Conservatives
on all questions of administration.
The condition attached to the
proposal was that if voluntary en

not provide the number of men
necessary to keep the first Can
adian divisions now in overseas
service up to strength, a measure
of compulsory service should be
put into effect.

lies of the United States should they
need it, if every consumer will use
only such fuel as is necessary," said
J. F. Welborn, member for this dis
trict of the coal production commit
tee recently named by the Council of
National Defense, in a statement urg
ing economy, issued today.
"A great many people are attempt
ing to buy for immediate delivery the
largest part, if not all, of their next
year's coal requirements. This natu
rally tends to create a shortage," the
statement says, "when normally there
would be a surplus. No handlers of
fuel will take advantage of this to
exact exorbitant prices."
The statement says Colorado mined
one-third more coal in the first four
months of this year than in the cor
responding period last year, and If
miners are exempted from military
service, and especially if carriers are
adequate, "there should be no short
age of Colorado coal this year in
markets heretofore supplied by it."

MORE ARRESTS WILL
BE MADE THIS WEEK
Local Organizations Urged To
Co-operate With Govern
ment In Seeing That All of
Military Age Sign.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. June 1. Depart
ment of justice officials are of the
opinion that the situation with re
spect to the draft army registration
Tuesday is well in hand; that there
will be no really serious disturbances,
and that the nation will wake up on
Wednesday to find that outbursts have
been sporadic and not the result of
a general feeling against the law.
It was pointed out at the depart
ment tonight that more than 10,000,
000 are required to register under the
law, and that it would be surprising
indeed if such a day were to pass off
without incident, as bo general elec
tion ever held in this country passes
without some disorder.
Attorney General Gregory's orders
have caused the arrest of about 30
persons up to today in connection with
anti-draft propaganda. Only( a few
more, probably less than half a dozen,
are expected before Tuesday. Such
a showing is looked upon as extra
ordinary and as a convincing indica
tion that despite oratory against reg
istration and the few conspiracies
discovered to interfere with it or to
prevent the response of; the men of
draft age, there has been no substan
tial movement to defeat the purpose
of the law.
Expect Few Slackers.
The department expects that there
may be a number of evasions of the
regulation provision that will look
large in total, but not when the great
number subject, to the law is consid
ered. Many even of those who do
evade Tuesday are counted upon
eventually to come forward to makp
good without prosecution. It was
asserted tonight that out of the 10,
000,000, slackers will not number 1
in 100. . . . ... .
Attorney General Gregory reiterated
bis request that local organizations
aid in the work of seeing that every
man between 21 and 30 years of ape
in their communities registers his
name.
"The department, he said, "has
been greatly aifed in several in

GERMANY WATCHING
LIBERTY LOAN SAYS
NEW YORKFINAHCIER
Enemy Anxious To See If U.
S. Is Going To Make Mighty
Effort At First of War, Says
Prominent Speaker.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. June 1. The Liberty
Loan of $200,000,000,000 "is but the
start," . said Frank A. Vanderlip,
president of the National City Bank,
today, in speaking before the Mer
chants' Association on the necessity
of employers assisting employes tc
subscribe to the loan.
"We are going to need sums of
such magnitude that were never be
fore dreamed of in any undertaking
in which we have ever engaged," he
declared.
Otto H. Kuhn, of Kuen, Loeb &
Co., also was a speaker. As an Amer
ican, born of German parents, he
ciade a stirring appeal to other
Americans of German birth or ante
cedents to support the government.
"Speaking as one born of German
parents," h said, "I do not hesitate to
state it is my deep conviction that
the greatest service which persons of
German birth or antecedents can ren
der to the country of their origin is
to adhere and stand up for those great
ideals and traditions which they and
their ancestors inherited and in which
they were brought up. They must
set their faces like flint against the
monstrous doctrines and acts of a
rulership which has robbed them of
the Germany which they loved and
which had the affection and the ad
miration of the world.
"It is my deep conviction that the
more unmistakably and whole-heartedly
they throw themselves into the
struggle which this country has en
tered in order to rescue Germany, no
less than the rest of the world, from
those sinister forces that are, in Pres
ident Wilson's language, the enemy of )
all mankind, the better they protect
and serve the old name,"
Thomas W. Lamont, of J. P. Mor
gan & Co., another speaker, declared
that the nation, and particularly the
middle west, has not awakened to the
need for the Liberty Loan.
"The task ought not to appear dif
ficult," he said, "but it is hard. It
is iiard for several reasons, but chiefly
because the country has not yet awak
ened to what it has got to do. That
spirit of rising to emergencies is
shown more in New York even than
it has in the middle west.
"The country as a whole has not
risen to the fact that this loan has
got to be made, and the one great
reason it has got to be made is that
Germany is watching to see whether
we are going to make a mighty effort
in the very first step of the war."

statement, Mrs. G. H. Scill, of this town,
i says: "For three years I sutfered untold !
agony with my head. I was unable tb

I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when

just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a younr; boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all.
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,

' MAJORITY AGAINST STRIKE.
From many sources, in close touch with the Jerome
situation, it has been authoritatively learned that a
minority caused the present strike in Jerome. This add
ed to the fact that the leaders, are striving for an end
at a time when such actions, in a larger sense, consti
tute at least a serious breach of public faith if not actual
treason against themselves and their fellow men has cost
the strikers their cause before it has got well started.
Sentiment throughout the state, and particularly in the
large industrial centers, is against the tactics of the
striking miners at Jerome. The miners in Bisbee and
they reflect in great degree the feeling in other camps
in Arizona-r-are satisfied. They do not want trouble.
They do not believe in adopting a course, at this time,
which is prejudicial of the best interests of themselves,
inasmuch as it is detrimental to the good of the nation.
Though slow to awake to their full responsibilities, the
people of Arizona are fast coming to the conclusion that
the war with Germany is just as much our war as it is
those of the people on the Atlantic seaboard. That it is
far removed from us, in its. actual carnage and its tern
bleness, does not reduce its effect upon the people of this
region of the nation. This can he particularly brought
to light if we can imagine ourselves the beaten enemy
of the Imperial German Government.
To the end that Arizona shall participate in the war.
with its full quota of men and industries, lis people will
not tolerate unwise and unjust labor disturbances. Such
a strike, as is now in progress at Jerome in normal
times would be sifted by the people for its causes and
the Justice of its demands. They would come to a con
clusion, most certainly. At the present time, however,
that conclusion was arrived at on short notice. The resi
dents of the state do not want their industrial mainstay
wrecked on the rocks of personal ambition. They will
have none of it and the consequence must be a loss m
prestige for the cause which brings the condition about
Men are gullible, but they can be and are being, brought
to a stern realization of the facts. Reason in Arizona is
supplanting sentimental agitation. A cause must have
justice in its van .before it can be victorious. It must
cme to the beard of arbitration and of conciliation with
clean hands. The men who make strikes possible the
large percentage of workers and ace blindly led by aspir
ing and, in nearly all cases, designing and personally sel
fish leaders are waking to the truth. They are about
to call a halt. x
Bad enough at any time is the d it nipt ion of industrial
progress but at the present it is criminal and the people
are fast coming to that conclusion. The causes which
stimulated the 6trike at Jerome must be cast to the four
winds. They are seditious as well as destructive. 1
URGES PUPILS TO CONTINUE IN SCHOOL
NEXT FALL.
An urgent appeal to pupils to remain in high school
next fall as a patriotic duty has been issued by Dr. P. P.
Claxton, United States Comimssioner of Education. Dr.
Claxton points out that there are in the high schools of
the United States this year more than one and one-half
millions of boys and girls, and somewhat more than
200,000 of them will graduate this month and next. In
an ordinary year 90,000 or more of these would next fall
enter college, normal school or technical school to lw
prepared for such service to society. State and Nation
as can be rendered only by those who have received edu
cation beyond that which the high schools can give. He
says "Many college presidents and others fear that on
account of our entrance into the war few boys and girls
will enter college next fall and that the total college at
tendance will be very small. The number ought, how
ever, to be much larger than usual.
"The more mature young men are, the more service
able they are in Uie army. Tie selective draft will take
only those between twenty-one aud thirty. In the total,
cf 60.000.000 people of productive age in the United
States the 350.0OO students in colleges and normal schools
and technical and vocational schools of high grade con
stitute only about one-half of one per cent Mure than
half of these live in cities and cannot be employed in
agricultural production except as a few of them may find
work on the farms during the summer Their going to
college will not lower tie productive capacity of the
country as a whole In any appreciable degree. The c:l
leses, normal schools, and technical schools will all he
open with undiminished income from public funds and
endowments, and the expense of their maintenance will
continue. It is quite probable that many of the older
students will not return next fall and the higher classes
will be smaller than usual. The graduates from the high
schools should see to it that the lower classes more than
make up for this deficiency.
"This appeal is made on the basis of patriotic duty.
If the war should be long and the country will need all
the trained men and women it can get many more than
it now has. There will -be men in abundance to fight in
the trenches but there will be a dearth of officers, en
gineers, and nen of scientific knowledge and skill in all
the industries, in transportation, and in many other
places where skill and daring are just as necessary for
success as in the trenches The first call of the allies
is for 12,000 engineers and skilled men to repair the rail
roads of France and England; and other thousands will
be needed later Russia will probably want thousands of
men to repair and build her railroads. The increase in
transportation and the tax on our own roads will call for
large numbers of men of the same kind. New industrial
plants, shipyards, and our armies abroad will call for high
ly trained men beyond all possible supply unless our col
leges and technical schools remain open and Increase their
attendance and output.
When the war is over there will be made upon us
such demands for men and women of knowledge and
training as have never before come to any country. There
will be equal need for a much higher average of general
intelligence for citizenship than has been necessary until
now. The world will have to be rebuilt and American
college men and women assume a large part of the task.
In all international affairs we must play a more impor
tant part than we have in the past. For years we must
feed our own industrial population and a large part of
the population of Western and Central Europe. We must
readjust our Industrial and social and civic life and insti
tutions. We must extend our foreign commerce. We
must increase our production to pay our large war debts
and to carry on all the enterprises for the general war
fare which have been begun but many of which will be
retarded as the war continues. China and Russia with
their new democracies and their new developments
which will come as a result will need and ask our help
In many ways England, France, Italy, and the Central
Powers will all be going through a process of recon
struction and we should be ready to give them generously
every possible help. Their colleges and universities are
now almost empty. Their older students, their recent
graduates, and their younger professors are fighting and
9
dying in the trenches, or are already dead; as are many
of their older scientific and literary men, artists, and
others whose work is necessary for the enlargement of the
cultural and spiritual life and for all that makes for
higher civilization For many years after the war is over
some of these countries will be unable to support their
colleges and universities as they have supported them in
the past America must come to the rescue. We must
be ready to assume all the responsibilities and perform
thoroughly and well all the duties that will come to us
In the new and more closely related world which will
rise out of the ruins of the old -orld which is now pass
Ing away in the destruction of the war To what extent
and how well we may be able to do this will depqnd upon
you young mea and women who are this year graduating
from our high schools and upon those who will follow In
the next few years, to a larger degree than upon ani
other like number of people"

Shoppers have been realizing for a good while that
prices of all commodities have been going up and up
again. But they have been prosperous, and for the most
part they have groaned a little and then bought as usual
But now the time is coming when some things will no
longer be for sale.
Heads of linen departments in the big stores are not
apologetic about the doubled prices for wares which have
always before sold at certain standard rates, but they
warn prospective purchasers that when the supply on
hand is exhausted no more of these things may be looked
for. They say there are going' to be no more breakfast
cloths, for iustance, those yard-and-a-half squares which
housewives find convenient for so many purposes. Such
flax as can be obtained will all be woven into goods by
the yard. Women who have always bought the best of
double damask may just as well get their minds ready to
replace their worn tablecloths with crash.
This is no suggestion to rush out and buy linens one
doesn't need right now, thus creating an artificial rise in
prices already far too high, but is a warning to conserve
linen of all kinds as far as possible
There are certain purposes for which linen and liuen
only can be satisfactorily used, such as handkerchiefs and
table napkins. Towels can be adulterated with cotton up
to a fairly high percentage, but unless they are at least
half linen they are not absorbent enough to give good ser
vice. But tablecloths" may be made of cotton, and so
may many other things customarily of linen. Using linen
for dresses or cushion covers is wasteful in the present
stage of the linen industry.
It is well for the housewife to adopt a platform of con
BervationT-to take the best possible care of the linen she
has, and to buy no new linen where cotton can possibly
