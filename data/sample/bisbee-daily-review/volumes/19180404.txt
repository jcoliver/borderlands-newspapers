German Offensive Discussed
By Wilson in Conference
With Department Heads ; to
Rush Troops to France.
(Rv Review Leased 'Wire
"WASHINGTON. April 3. With the j
hattle of Picardy brought to a stand
still for the time being, at least, and
the initial momentum or the German
drive overcome, military observers
here were plainly puzzled tonight by j
the fact that a great counter assault j
had not developed. The psychological j
moment of the counter stroke under i
the rules of strategy they think is pass
ing. if it has not already passed, with
out a recorded movement of the allied
forces toward throwing back the ex
hausted foe before he has had time to 1
dig himself in.
Officers here admit frankly, howev
er, that they do not know what is the
situation at the front. If any report
has come from Generals Bliss or Persh
ing that would serve to explain the
defensive tactics of the allies, it is a
carwefully guarded secret. Naturally
nothing ould be made public regarding
such advices even without Secretary .
uaner s oraer 01 yejsierua snuiuiis
down absolutely on war department an
nouncements regarding operations in
France. The order has served, howev
er, to make officers even more cau
tious about discussing the situation in
formally. I
May Plan Super Drive
It wab suggested as possible that
the plan of campaign mapped out by
General Foch is of far greater scope
than would be involved in an effort to j
hurl the enemy back to his old lines.
The German defenses there, which sue
cessfally stemmed the British assault
in 1916 are still intact and even if the
allies were successful in rushing the
German ilnes back over the twenty or
thirty mile zone he has wrested from
them they would face thfse defenses
when their own organization was bad
ly demoralized by their advance, and.
their men showing the wear and tear
of a prolonged offensive.
For this reason some officers were
inclined to look elsewhere for the ag
gressive campaign to which they are
pinning their faith. They have count
ed upon the creation' of a unified army
under General Foch to produce .offen
sive operations and they see nothing
in the situation at this time to warrant
the conclusion that the allies have not
the necessary reserve forces or sup
plies. It was suggested that the new pur
pose of employing American troops to
fill out allied fighting divisions might
have some bearing upon the situation.
If General Foch is laying his founda
tions for continuous operations of an
aggrerf.ive character, he would need
to be certain of his reserves nnd the
detailed plans for employment of Ara
V erican troops would have to be worked
out.
Rush Men To France
Speeding up of American troop
movements to France is engrossing at
tention here. President Wilson held
his weekly conferences with the heads
of the war making and production
branches of the government today and
it is understood that the ways and
means for throwing the full resources
"of the United States into the conflict
this year were talked over.
One immediate step to that end i3
known to be in contemplation. It has
to do with the calling to the colorj of
the 800.000 men which it already has
been announced will be mobilized
through the selective service machin
ery during the year. Assurances have
been given that no great withdrawals
of men from agricultural and industri
al life would be made at one time, bjt
the indications are that a statement
now being prepared regarding the nu;n
ber of men to be called out first under
that plan wiil show that a larger force
will bt mobilized this month than red
been intended before the German drive
altered conditions abroad.
The means of housing and training
the men rapidly becoming available
and the movements to France have
been already greatly accelerated.
It was learned authoritatively that
with additional British troop ships
available the war department now has
in sight transportation and supplies
for all the men it plans to "Bend under

General Maurice today.
"At present the enemy is engaged In

then replaced them with divisions

supplies.
"A great number of Gffrman di
visions are exhausted and must be
moved back to the depots and be re

parts of the front The Germans thus

are not fighting for imperialistic or an

Tbe minister said he was anxious
that the rectifications of the frontier
should not leave any embitterment
behind, and expressed the opinion that
Rumania in her own interest must
turn to the central powers.
"In concluding peace with Rumania
and Ukraine," he continued, "It haa
been my first thought to furnish the
monarchy with foodstuffs and raw
materials. Russia did not come into
consideration in this connection owing
to the disorganization there..
Will Get Much Food
"We agreed with Ukraine that the
quantity of grain to be delivered to
the central powers should be at least
on-j million tons.
"Frnm Rumania we will obtain a
Germany, but we shall go forward to- consjierable surplus of last year's
gethjr to the last ifl our aeiense tor harvest. Moreover, about 400,000 tons
of grain, peas, beans and fodder must
be transported via the Danube. Rum
ania must also immediately provide us
with S00.000 sheep and 100,000 pogs,
which will improve our meat supply
slightly.
Replying to the annexationists,
Count Czernin said.
'The forcible annexation of foreign
peoples would plaes difficulties in the
way of a general peace an dsuch an
extension of territories would not
strengthen the empire. On the con
trary considering the grouping of tha
monarchy, they would weaken us.
What w require are not territorial an
nexations, but economic safeguards
for the future.
"We wish to do everything to cre
ate in the Balkans a situation of
lasting calm.
"We know the desire for peace is
very great in Serbia, but Serbia has
Leen, prevented by the entente powers
from concluding it. Bulgaria must
receive from Serbia certain districts
our existence as a- state and lor our
future.
"The first breach in the will of our
enemies for war has been made by
the peace negotiations with Russia.
It was a break through or the peace
id?a. It is evidence of childish dilet
tantism to overlook the inner connec
tion wetween the various conclusions
of peace. The constellation of enemy
powers in tbe east resembled a net;
when one mesh was severed the others

peace at any price is despicable for
it is unmanly, and it is foolish be
cause it continuously feeds the al
ready dying aggressive spirit of the
enemy. The desire for peace j? the
great masses is naturally as well as
comprehensible, but the leaders of the
people must consider that certain ut
terances produce abroad just the op
posite effect from what they desire.

No Desire to Oppress
"The second' group of war prolong

distortion of iact to assert that Ger
many has made conquest in the east.
Lenine's anarchy drove the border
people into the arms of Germany, is
Germany to refuse this Involuntary
choice of foreign border states?
"1 he German government has as lit
tle desire for oppression as we, and
1 ara convinced that neither annex
ation nor weaklings can prevent for
ever a moderate, and honorable peace.
They delay it, but they cannot prevent
it.
"The hopes of our enemies of final
victory are based to a great extent on
our interior political conditions and
n certain political leaders, not for
getting the Czecns. Recently we were
almost on the point of entering into
negotiations with the western powers,
when the wind suddenly veered round
and, as wa know with certainty, the
entente decided it had better wait a

our country justified the hope that tt

Count Czernin attacked the Czech
leaders and Czech troops who, he de
clared "criminally fight agains ttheir

people to be united against this "high ,
treason."
"If we expel this poison," he de
clared, "a general, honoiable peace is

CHICAGO. April 3. -Counsel for the
government in the trial of more than
one hundred leaders and organizers
of the Industrial Workers of the
World, accused of violating the es
pionage act, today tendered to the
defense four jurors aftej. having ex
ercised two of its sir peremptory chal
lenges.
The defense announced that accept
ed jurors would be tendered back to
the government In groups of four.
In questioning prospective jurors,
the government laid special stress
upon the question of their sympathies
In the war One of the government's
peremptory challenges was In the case
of Thomas W. Allis6n, a settlement
worker of Chicago. He is the father
of Brent Dow Allison, who has been
known as a pacifist and who faced
possible charges of desertion if be
failed to appear at Camp Grant today
as ordered by his draft board.
The other peremptory challenge by
the government was in the case of
Frank Martin, Chicago, who was ques
tioned closely as to certain relatives
who speak the German language.
The question of the right to conduct
strikes during the war will form an
important part of the defense it was
indicated by George F. Vanderveer,
counsel for the I. W. WV, In question
ing veniremen.
"Would it take less evidence for
you to return a verdict of ruiltv be
cause the country is at war" he ask?d
one venireman.
"Do you 'eel that all strikes should
be suspended during the war?"
Among other things" the men are
charged -with encouraging strikes to
hamper the manufacture o fwar ma

character of members of the 1. W. W.

COUNCIL SEEKS TO
PAVE TWO SECTIONS
OF BISBEE STREETS
Taking advantage of time and stirr
ed by local political issues and a com
ing campaign, the city council last
night in a postponed meeting from
Tuesday night took up paving matters
in the heart of the city, and definitely
decided on the paving of Xaco road
from the dcot to the top of Slag
Dump hill. The city clerk was ordered
to advertise immediately for bids for
this work and the city engineer has In
structed to have ready his plans and
specifications for such advertising.
In addition a committee of the coun
cil was appointed to visit the property
owners on Main St. in the block begin
ning at the post office and ending
above the Fair store. The property
owners will be requested to sign pledg
es to do their share of the paving and
leveling of this block. If the support
of the property owners can be secured
the council will order the paving of
this section. The pavement below the
postoffice, they declare, is satisfactory
for the present..
City Engineer McXish presented es
timates of the cost of paving for tha
two proposed jobs. In each instance
the total amounted to about f 2.50 per
square yard. It was reported to the
council that the street car company is
ready to do its share of the paving on
both operations. This will amount to
one-third of the total cost. Property
owners will pay four-fifths of the bal
ance and the city the remaining one
fifth of the balance.
Street Superintendent C. A. Bailey
was ordered by the council to get rea
dy Immediately for the sinking of the
city well to additional depth to secure
a more adequate water supply. The
superintendent was authorized to or
der supplies needed, and instructed to
start the work as soon as possible. It
is anticipated by the council that the
budget laid aside for this work will
not fully complete the sinking, and
that the next city government will
have to provide for further funds.
An ordnance to comply with the 1917
state tax law and providing for the col
lection of city taxes by the county nd
the sitting of the board of supervisors
as a board of equalization for the city,
was passed. The effect of this Ptatute
Is to do away with the offices of city

ROAD IMPROVEMENT NOW
ASSURED.
(Douglas International.)
At the meeting of the Cochise county
board of supervisors held in Tombstone
yesterday the bids of the Copper Queen
branch of the Phelps-Dodge corporation
and of the Calumet & Arizona Mining
company were accepted for one-ha If of the
million dollar road improvement bonds
voted last fall by the county. While noth
ing definite has been stated by the com
mission it is understood that the members
feel confident that the remainder of the
bonds will be disposed of in time to prevent
interference with the continuance of the
work.
It is fortunate that Cochise county ha3
such good friends as these two mining com
panies, for in the sale of these bonds our
county was certainly in need of a friend
after bids had failed to bring satisfactory
and desirable purchasers. Had not the
home companies come forward as buyers
of the bonds the matter of the proposed im
portant road improvement work would
now be indefinitely postponed.
The fact that these local companies, ac
quainted with our conditions and with
those charged with expending the bond
money on the roads of the county, must be
regarded as a tribute to the road commis
sion, composed of Harry A. Clark and
Mayor W. M. Adamson of Douglas; John
J. Bowen and Captain J. P. Hodgson of
Bisbee and A. H. Gardner of Tombstone;
the confidence of the bond buyers that un
der the direction of this commission the
money will be economically expended Vo
doubt was an inducement which prevented
any delay in carrying out the road improve
ment program. An important part of this
program is the paving of the link of the
state highway between Douglas and Bis
bee, besides other work on the borderland
route from Rcdeo to Benson and on to the
Pima county line.
The sale of the road bonds should pro
vide joy among the county road boosters.
The bonds were carried by heavy majori
ties in all sections of the county, excepting
on three or four precincts.
After certain state officers of the Hunt
administration had admitted their part in
the disgraceful scene in a San Diego hotel
where certain Arizona soldier boys had be
come so drunk as to draw reprimand and
punishment from the army, . Governor
Hunt, in an interview in El Paso, declares
that the soldier boys got the state officers
drunk. He places the shoe on the other
foot with a vengeance. To Arizona peo
pel who know the facts of the San Diego
disgrace and who know Governor Hunt
more than passing well, how natural and
characteristic is his El Paso interview. A
leopard cannot change his spots, either at
home of away from home. Once a Hunt,
always a Hunt. And he carries a shield of
brass to protect him frorrt the arrows of
truth and indignation that fly against him
in a cloud from the bows of his long suffer
ing and outraged constituency.
It now seems to be pretty well establish
ed that the recent German offensive cost
the Hun over a half million men. Thi3
means that for every mile of the thirty-five
miles of ground gained they paid fifteen
thousand men. Now comes the question,
who won the second battle of the Sommr ?
Even rf the Germans hold all the ground
they have gained, they paid tod much Tor
it. And it is not expected that they can
hold it, for the great allied reserve has not
yet been brought into action. A terrible
counter stroke now might well regain this
costly ground. But the campaign, based
upon its present status, appears to be an
actual defeat for Germany. The allied
armies arc unbeaten and still full of fight.
The Gciir 3n icccrves have been chattered.
Ar.d the great campaign of the summer is
yet io be fought. With thinned ranks the
Hun must fight on, while hi3 enemies draw
constantly upon fresh reserves of the best
fighting material in the world. The Ameri
cans are coming! That is the battle shout
in Europe just now. Had Germany net
struck at all she would have had a half mil
lion more men with which to withstand the
battles of August sure to come. The three
peoples opposing her in the we3t will fight
on to a decision. Germany tried io force
that decision by April 1 , but instead the
date came only to witness All Fool's Ddy in
Berlin.
CURBING THE HUN.
Of five thousand war gas masks made
in the United States for shipment to France,
two thousand nine hundred were discover
ed defective Monday when they were in
spected by the, war department. The de
fects were attributed to the Hun in the
factory.
On March 1 8, the Associated Pres3 told
us that a spy is possibly working behind
the American lines in France.
A nefarious batch of more than one
hundred I. W. W. is now on trial in Chica
go for alelged violation of the" espionage
act, and an Arizona I. W. W. attorney is
assisting in their defense.
More than one-half of thi3 gang of trai
tors have spent some time in Arizona with
in the past year spreading their evil doc
trines. Last fall, torch-bearing Prussians seared
a black line across the Salt River valley, of
Arizona, when grain and hay was set afire
on a dozen or more occasions.
The menace of the pro-German, the dis
gruntled agitator, the pacifist, the I. W. W.
and the propagandist has come home to this
state. We have felt it in production. , Our
industries have been handicapped through
it. Society in its broad sense has come in
contact with it, and, sad to say, in some in
stances, has been tainted with it.
Bonds issued in direct opposition to the
Liberty bonds of thi3 government, have
been publicly offered for Sale by these para
sites. It is time to call a halt to curb these
propagandists of the kaiser in their opera--tions
in this state.
Enactment at the special session of the
legislature this summer of an alien enemy
act, providing ' for the prosecution of all
who in any manner seek to injure the state
or government or who have pro-German
sympathies will solve Arizona's problem.
The governor, and only the governor, can
make possible such action through inclu
sion in his call of just such a statute.
Wisconsin has arisen at last and thrown
her spear full and fair against the brass
shields of the traitors who have so long mis
represented her. In the election Tuesday
for U.. S. senator, out of 230,000 votes
counted up to Wednesday morning, Berg
er, the German traitor candidate, received
only about forty thousand. i Six to one
Wisconsin has voted against disloyalists.
Lenroot, committed body and soul to Presi
dent Wilson's war program, seems to have
been elected by a slight margin over a loyal
democratic candidate. Berger will likely
go to prison or an internment camp instead
of the U. . senate. When it is remem
bered that Wisconsin has a larger number
of German and Scandinavian born people
in prctortion to her population than any
ether state in the union, one must bow in
wonder and admiration before the magic
properties of the melting pot in this free,
prosperous and just land.
The fourteenth day of the great struggle
on the west front witnesses the forward
drive of the Germans at a standstill and the
allied counter offensive not yet under way.
Germany's effort to force a decision has
been frustrated. Now the question arises,
is her capture cf ground and men and
equipment worth the loss of a half million
or more of her best soldiers ? Can she hold
her gains? It is certain that the allies have
not yet used their reserves. They have the
power to strike a mighty blow, but as to
the wisdom of striking now, or waiting un
til later, this is for,our leaders to judge. Be
sure that General Foch is not afraid to
strike. He is a fighter as well as logician. In
the meantime the Germans are digging in
and bringing up heavy guns. Any day or
hour now may well bring momentous
event3 in its train.
Another arm df war for the mobiliza
tion of this county's fighting and produc
ing strength has been added with the com
pletion of the Cochise County Common
Council of Defense. The objects of the
council are co-operation with the slate and
national councils, constructive and effen
sive war work, and greater cificency
among the residents of Cochise county.
HAS THE CITY NO RIGHTS?
(Kansas City Star.)
Has Kansas City no rights in the present
situation?
Here is a whole town tied up, business
interrupted, street car service stopped, tens
of thousands of person3 not directly con
cerned in the labor troubles thrown out of
work cr put to intolerable inconvenience,
the city for hours at the mercy of a mob,
and the militia called out and all because
a few laundry drivers were dissatisfied!
It seems inconceivable!
At a time when the government needs all
the resources of the country, not only in
men and munitions and food, but in money
as well in war saving stamps and liberty
loans the business of this big city is slow
ed down and brought almost to a standstill.
And not because of any serious grievances
affecting a large number of persons.
fill the gaps in the French and British ranks
in Picardy. It is estimated that at least a
hundred thousand of them have been call
ed already, and as many more will soon go
forward. Quite a neat little reinforcement,
even in thi3 great war. And it saves the
original British-French reserve army still
intact for the decisive counter blow when
Foch decides that the time is ripe to strike.
We are helping a little, friends, right now;
quite a little bit, if you please. Ata boy,
Sammie, ata boy !
LIBERTY BOND DRIVE
IN WARREN DISTRICT
"Gee, but you fellows ' are in luck,"
yelled the United States soldiers along the
road to their comrades marching by on their
way to join in the Pacardy battle. "Eat
'em up ! ' was the final injunction from those
disappointed ones to those who march
ed towards the battle line. How distinctly
American are these expressions and this
spirit. The highest, finest type of our coun
trymen called and received this American
call in France. "Eat 'em upl" Surest
thing you know. Broadway, New York,
and the main street of many an American
country town called from the French road
side in the language of their country to
their own kind and no interpreter is needed
for us to understand that call, even as it
was understood by the khaki columns go
ing into battle. It is the American call,
scunded in the distinctive American way,
just as our troops are being thrown in con
siderable numbers into the thickest of the
fray. Word from France is to the effect
that besides Pershing's army holding a con
siderable sector of trenches, all the Ameri
can troops available have been called to
Most significant at this time are the city
election returns from Chicago, metropolis
of all that portion of America lying west
of the Alleghenies. Hundreds of thousands
of foreign born citizens dwell within her
limits. I. W. W. and socialist headquart
ers for the country have been located in
Chicago for years. Black handers, anarch
ists, and every species of wild eyed rioter
and enemy of all government and society
swarm along Halstead street like the spume
on the waves of the sea. And yet, in yes
terday's election in Chicago, with a social
ist candidate for council running in every
one of the thirty-three wards, not one was
elected. Two hold overs alone remain in
that city council presided over by Thomp
son, the disloyal mayor. Great and wond
erful has been the work of the. melting pet
in Chicago. She has rebuked all traitors
and pacifists and agitators. Good men and
true have been elected to office all along
the line; men who can be depended upon
to uphold the flag and the country's honor
in the second city of the union.

referred to Sam W. Proctor, secretary
of th? state corporation commission,
for solution by a woman from another
state who says she is "89 years young
but should have known better." This
youthful octogenarian writes to the
commission that she at one time pur
chased 1.000 shares of a certain com
pany v hich is incorporated in Arizona.
The capital stock of the company at
that time, she writes, was $69,000,000
of a pal value of 1 a share. Since
then the company has been through a
tran.-.ferming and juggling process, sho
declares, until the capital stock has
been veduced to $1,000,000 of a par val
ue of ttn cents per share.
"They have offered me 100 shares
of the new stock for my 1,000 shares
of the old stock," the woman writes
"Now please tell me where I stand, if
I have been stung and whether 1 owe
the company money." Mr. Proctor Is
still figuring on the problem.
Word has been received in Naco of
an application lately mad? by Mrs.'
Addie Bury Pamtowsky for divorce,
from Jacob Panitowsky ,an aged mil-j
lionaire of Oakland, Cal.. whom shc
tad married only 35 days before She f
asks $300 a month for her own neces
sities. In Arizona, she was the wi.'ei

The body of Mi's Macpie Feather-j
man, daughter of Mr. and Mr. Wil-
liam F"atherman. of Tombstone, ar-j
rived Tuesday from Kansas City, yto.,
where death occurred and was taken I
to the family home on lower Fourth !
street where it remained until 41
o'clock. wh-n funeral serric?s were:
held. Interment was had in te City j
cemetery. Death was the result of i
pneumonia. A number ol relatives,'
including a sister from Silver City, j
X. M.. arrived to at'end the funeral..
Eighteen months at hard labor and a
fine of $300 or one day for each dollar
for Cole Evans and Earl Erwin and a
two years suspended sentence for Mrs.
Belle Evans, were the sentences im
posed by Judge Stanford on the trio
convicted by a jury of introducing in
toxicating liquor.
The sentences were passed after the
defendants' counsel pleaded for lenien
cy. W. L. Barnuiu made a strong plea
urging the court to extend mercy,
pleading to the end for "corrective
punishment."
That Mrs. Evans in Feeking to warn
her husband and brother-in-law that
the officers were in wait for them was
only ao'ng what any loving and faith
ful wife would do. was the contention
of P. ii. Hayes who declared her con
duct was justifiable.
The jury in the case of the woman
who went to Buckeye to "tip off the
men coming from the coast with a ma
chine loud of lifiuor, recommended a
suspended sentence.
READY FOR START
With practically the same commit
tees working in identically the same
districts, the Liberty Bond drive for
the raising of this district's share of
$1,113,870. is ready for launching as
soon as the necessary supplies and ma
terials arrive from the district head
quarters. It is hoped that these sup
plies will be in hand on Saturday,
April 6, the date aet by the national
government for the inauguration of
the drive and the first anniversary of
this nation's entry into the war.
At a meeting last night in the War
ren District commercial club rooms
J. N. Gaines, county chairman for the
sale of the bonds presiding, the organ
ization for this district waa completed.
The meeting was largely attended by
the workers of the last October drive,
by representatives of the banks and by
new workers willing to lend assistance
in tie third drive. Several addresses
were made, and plans for the drive
were discussed at length. No definite
action was taken, however, on new or
novel plans presented.
The old committees where they
stood Intact were appointed by the
chairman to handle the third drive.
Where the committees had suffered
loss of personnel, new members were
added to bring up their strength. Com
mittee chairmen of last October were
then assigned the same territory they
canvassed on the last drive and in
structed to proceed in exactly the
same manner as on the previous oc
casion to visit every resident in their
territory and secure his or her pledge
to one or more bonds.
The women's committees and organ
ization is separate from the men's, and
was well represented at the meeting.
It was filled to capacity with members
and assigned the same work as on the
former drive.
The personnel of the committees will
be published later in the Review.
eanUme plans suggested at the meet
ing for stimulation of sales will be con
sidered and should they be adopted,
will be announced later. Farther de
tails of the drive, the date of starting,
and similar data, has been left until
the papers arrive for workers.
Novel Car Ride
For Commuters
Warren and Lowell residents com
muting into Bisbee last evening on the
street car which leaves Warren at 6:30
o'clock, were given a novel treat in
bumps and jars, when car No. 103 be
came pusher for cor No. 102, and boost
ed the latter from the Custom House
stop to the siding in front of the dis
pensary. The delay occasioned some
cemmeut by passengers but most jok
ed over the incident.
The leading car had pulled out of
the Custom House siding when a fuse
blew out. After waiting several mo
ments the car started forward but did
not have the power to climb Slag
Dump Mil. Half way up the hill the
car in the rear bumped against the
lead car, began pushing, and finally
shoved the vehicle over the grade.
Residents of the district who have
seen the El Paso & Southwestern en
gine pushing the train from Osborn.
stood along the streets and stared at
the inauguration of a similar system
on the street car lines. They had seen
one street car pull another, but never
before had they seen one push the
other.

The story centers about the deeds

This criminal becomes involved with
a band of crooks known as the Pack,
through his efforts to rescue fioni
them a lovely girl who, he bslieves. ii

girl pass through man exciting ad

through the streets of Paris in txi

flight across the English Channel.
Eventually the girl identifies uerself
as a secret service agent, tut giv?s

Conchita Cordova, the part played

His repentance comes almost too

-If Yon Want to be Rid of Catarrh
Deep-Seated Disease That Can
not Be Reached by Local
Treatment.

MISS HAMILTON IS

Tiu Moililie n Hniailtr.n. uoetio i
reader of the chautauqua circuit,-1
fallo.i tn arrive in nisbee vesterdav
to ive her talk at the Y. M. C. A: !
last night, .miss nana. ton was rcuru

'When you hawk and spit cnt3 yon
almost strangle in an effort to get
your breath, because your air-passages
are all choked up with. Catarrh,
end your condition grows worse from
day to day, you are about ready to
realize that Catarrh te by r.o means a
Limp'.e ailment.
If you hare had the disease for any
Icr.gth of time, you have doubtless
used enough treatment to convince
you that you will not be able to find
any lasting relief from the remedies
that are so generally relied upon.
Others who have been afflicted with
Catarrh have used atomizers and
sprays, ointments, salves, jellies and
other local applications by the whole
sale, without making the slightest
progress toward a cure.
You are doomed to the same disap
pointment, if you rely upon the same
misdirected methods of treating this
disease, for Catarrh is too stubborn
and deep-seated to be reached by
medicated applications which are ap
plied only to the surface.
Why not save yourself the expense
and the delay of getting on the right
road, by discarding entirely all these
plans of treatment which others have
found to be absolutely without
merit? Not only is Catarrh a source
of suffering to yourself, and annoy
ing and repulsive to those about you,
but it is a disease that is not to be
considered lightly, for if it is not
checked the. lungs sometimes become
affected, and everyone knows how
serious that is.
Catarrh is caused by millions of
tiny disease germs that infest the
blood. When they attack the delicata
membranes and air passages of the
nose and throat, you can never get
rid of them by sprays and atomizers.
They ' must be thoroughly routed
from the blood. That is why S. S. S.
b used so successfully in treating Ca
tarrh. This remedy is so thorough in
cleansing the blood that it routs out
every germ cf Catarrh or other dis
ease. S. S. S. goes right down to the
source of the disease, and if you will
begin its use today, you will finl
yourself at last on the right treat
ment. Go to your drue store and get
a bottle today, and if you want any
special advice regarding your case,
you can obtain same without charge
