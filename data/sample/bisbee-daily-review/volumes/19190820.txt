LEAGUE OF NATIONS BINDS U. S.
IViORALLY ONLY; HAS NO AUTHORITY
OFFORCE. SENATE TOLD BY WILSON
in
President, Testifying At Public Hearing Before the Senate
Committee, Says Congress Still Has Power to Say When
U. S. Shall Take Up Arms; Reveals That Allies Have Japan's
Statement in Writing That She Will Give Back Shantung
WASHINGTON. Aug. 19. President
Wilson, interpreting the league of
nations covenant today for the senate
foreign relations committee, declared
it Imposed no legal obligation for the
Ve of American military force in pro
tecting the territory or independence
of any other nation. . '
. But he added that the covenant
might involve in certain communities
an "absolutely compelling moral ob
ligation," which might be even strong
er than a legal promise.
Call League "Rope of Sand"
Pressed for a more exact definition
by committee members, -who insisted
that the whole arrangement was "a
rope of sand he asserted that on the
contrary he considered it as placing
the nations in "an attitude of com
radeship and protection," which would
compel respect for the principles of
justice and liberty.
Meeting the committee in a round
table discussion in the east room of
the White House, in contradiction to
precedents of more than a century,
and with the whole nation listening
through the medium of a relay of pub
lic stenographers, the president went
into many of tlje details of the peace
negotiations and touched on ail the
hotly debated questions which have
divided the senate in its consideration
of the peace treaty.
Article ten of the covenant, guar
anteeing the integrity of league mem
bers against aggression, he declared
would leave to each nation "complete
freedom of choice, as. to the applica
tion of force Evipn if the American
representative of the council loined in
a unanimous recommendation of mill-;
tary action the final decision for peace
. or war so fas as it concerned the
United States must rest with congress,
he said.
Sees Moral Coercion
Whatever advice the council gave
under Its authority to take such action
as is "deemed appropriate" must also
'be deemed appropriate by the United
States to be binding on this govern
ment, he argued, though in the back
ground would be 'such a potential
moral force that ,. he : doubted if the
nation would often decline to act.
The president revealed that Japan's
promise tP 'return Shantung province
to China was reduced to written
form in the minutes of the peace con
ference. .. He asserted he had "every
confidence that the promise would be
CITY COUNCIL FAIRS MUNICIPAL
MARKET, SUITABLE SITE PROBLEM
At last night's meeting the city
council went on record in favor of a
municipal market as one means of foil
ing old man John J. Cost of Living.. A
committee was appointed to co-operate
with the food committee from the lo
cal post of the Legion of Honor and
steps will be taken at once to atcure
a suitable site' for the market
Location seems to be the. chief
stumbling block to the plan, as there
are very few vacant pieces of property
in Bisbee that . could accommodate the
wagons and automobiles of twenty or
thirty produce dealers and the cars tf
purchasers. If a suitable location can
not be found in Bisbee, It Is probable
that a site will be chosen In Lowell.
Maj. Ira B. Joralemon, chairman of
the American Legion's food commit
tee, and several members or tne com
mittee were present ana put the prop
osition ' before the council. Mayor
Erickson and the aldermen were a unit
in indorsing the plan, If the obvious dif
ficulty of obtaining a suitable site and
the question of price regulation can
be solved. Mayor Erickson named as
the council committee to "confer with
the Legion's committee Aldermen N.
C. Bledsoe, I. A. Rosok and Hicks.
In presenting the proposition Major
Joralemon said investigation had
shown that In the country contiguous
to Bisbeo far more produce, such as
green vegetables, eggs, fruits and meat
is produced than the district can con
sume, but that owing to the primitive
methods of distribution the costs have
reached unreasonably high figures.
In Europe, Major Joralemon pointed
out, the middleman has been practi
cally eliminated, and m a number of
the cities in this country the municipal
market has been found an effective so
lution for the high cost of the food
question. At present, he Bald, produce
Is disposed of to the consumer after
carried out and told the senators it
was the best that could be got out of
the negotiations, Japan having given
notice she would withdraw from the
conference if her demands were re
fused." The American delegates, he
said, had tried to keep the nation free
rrom obligations In European affairs
so far as it was honoratly possible
to ao so.
Keep U. S. Boys on Rhine 15 Years,
, But he asserted that it might be
necessary to 'keep some American
troops in the Rhine district under the
treaty ior the next 15 years. 1
He declared the nation would be its
own sole judge whether its obliea
tions had been fulfilled under the dis
puted withdrawal clause of the league
covenant; that purely domestic ques
tions were safe from the league's in
terference; and that the Monroe doc-
irine was clearly Dreaerved.
The league, the president alleged.
was built on the plan of General
Smuts of southern Africa. Mr. Wil
son revealed that he had suggested
the United States' to take no part of
tne German reparation, but had asked
that the conference reserve disposi
tion of the German Pacific island at
Yap, on suggestion that it was need
ed for an American naval station.
Declines Some Questions., . .
Some of the senators questions
the president declined to answer, on
the ground of r international . policy.
How the American delegates voted
on Japan's proposal for a racial
equality clause in.. the league jcoven
ant, he said he could not disclose
In the ' interest 6r international
policy," and for the same reason lie
said he could not go into the negotia
tions over the French frontier or
give the committee a copy of the re
cord of Japan's Shantung promise.
.any action on tne treaty was
urged in a statement by the president
at the outset of the conference. This
was necessary; he held . so that a
peace; basis might be reached. The
other treaties under negotiations now
at Versailles were being delayed, he
said, until .the world learned what
would happen to the treaty with Ger
many. He said he saw no reasonable
objection to the senate reservations,
but thought it unwise to Incorporate
them In the ratification itself. In
replying to a long series of questions
by Senator Brandegee, Republican,
the president wis led into an exhaus
tive discussion of the co-mingling of
'Continued on T&M Two)
three different l handlings, . each of
which means a profit of at least 15
per . cent, with a 10 per cent loss in
handling.
In establishing a municipal market,
Major Joralemon said a board should
establish maximum prices, and there
should be lively bargaining between
producer and consumer on prices be
low this point The maximum, he said,
should be considerably less than the
prices charged by the stores. He be
lieved that a municipal market could
supply the needs of Jthe community in
vegetables and fruits for at least six
months of 'the year..
Major Joralemon also suggested
that in order to solve the rrfteat ques
tion, a small refrigerating plant could
be constructed at. the city market,
where farmers fwho . kill . their own
stock could place the meat for preser
vation until its sale o tne consumer.
He said the farmers were getting 6 or
7 cents a pound for their meat, which
with the cost of handling in this way
would bring It up to about 14 ectns,
instead of the 38 to 40 cents the con
sumer must pay under the present
system.
A screened building or sheds should
be provided, he said, and a site chosen
easy of access so that the farmers
could back up their carts or wagons
and the shoppers pass to the rear. He
estimated, the cost of a small refrigejt
ine plant at about (2000.
If a suitable site could not be ob
tained In ftisbee and if the citv coun
cil here did not approve the plan,'th
maior said the lerion was prepared tn

confident thev would have no trouble

Invasion, Says Baker; Troops
Ready Along! ; Entire Border
WAHHlNGTOrf, 1 Aug. 19. No offi
cial announcements are being made of
how the United States government in
tends to handle the- bandit nuisance
In northern Mexico from' this point
on, but there is -every evidence that
all preparations liave .been made to
meet future depredations with a
swift movement pfjtroops, Buch as
now is beinir concentrated aeainst th
i desperadoes who peld the two army
aviators ror ransoip.
Swift moving cfvalry, fully equip
ped with machine fains and guided by
airplanes, it is understood, will be re
lied upon, and wl be prepared ; to
move quickly from' strategic points
along the border of the bandit coun
try on the Rio Grande. , Organization
of the border guard to insure the
greatest speed in these movements
has been completed, the cavalry regi
ments being bo distributed as to place
the nucleus of a flying column at
caTefully selected points, along the Rio
Grande. . !
Movement of troops of the Eighth
cavalry into Mexico today inaugurated
the new plan, according to officials,!
iand from this time on similar inci
dent "will be handled without gloves."
In announcing that Major General
Jos. T. Dickman, ,' commanding the
southern department, had acted on in
structions from the war department,
Secretary " Baker intimated that only
the danger in which the two officers
were placed prevented an attempt to
rescue them by force.
"When the reports came of the cap
ture of these two officers, and their
being held for ransom," Secretary
Baker said, The Ivyar of execution be
ing set-en the next-day In defaults
the ransom being paid, there was, of
course, no opportunity to make a
military rescue within such a time,
and I therefore directed that the ran
som money be paid, and that force be
arranged to take up the hot trail of
the bandits and pursue them with the
hope of being able to capture as many
as possible.
Details of how the dash was to .be
conducted were left entirely to Gen
eral Dickman, the only requirement
being that it should be made with a
"swiftly moving force."
Cavalry with machine guns and
.guarded by airplanes would be used
If captives are taken they would be
brought to the United Statea.
The close proximity of the bandit
rendezvous to the border Ted to the
hopethat the American troops might
overtake them before they would have
time to scatter. f
Reports to the state department to
day from the consul at El Paso said
that late last week General Dieguez,
Mexican commandant at Chihuahua
City, had ordered Mexican cavalry pa
trols out through the country where
the American officers were held, but
there was no indication whether these
patrols were operating.
. The department was also advised by
the American embassy at Mexico City
that when it made representations re
garding the capture of the two avia
tors the Mexican foreign office prom
ised to see that every possible step
was taken to assist in the rescue of
the men.
Dispatches to the department from
Chihuahua said the governor of that
Mexican state, with the approval of
President Carranza, had offered a re
ward of 50,000 pesos for the capture of
Francisco Villa. Two colonels and
three captains of the Villa forces, cap
tured by the federals, were said , to
have been convicted of treason Sunday
by a militarp court martial and execut
ed by a firing squad yesterday.
The Mexican situation was given

200 "Kidnapers" Will Travel De Luxe
The schedule for the special train which will carry the 200 defend
ants in the deportation cases to Douglas and back every day next week
was given out yesterday. "Deportation Special No. 2", as the new train
will be known, leaves Bisbee at 12:10 each afternoon, reaching Douglas
at 1:25 p. m. Returning, the train will leave Douglas at 6:10 p. m,
reaching Bisbee at 7:25.
Arrangements have been made to serve a lunch daily on the train
soon after its departure. It had been planned to have two "singing
waiters" colored boys from Tyrone, N. !M, serve the lunch and help
entertain the guests, but this plan was knocked in the head when word
was received yesterday that both are now in jail.
It is expected, however, that plenty of amusement will be provided
for the travelers to keep time from dragging heavily on their hands.

MILWAUKEE, Wis., Aug. 19.
Three companies of state home
guards were ordered from Camp
Douglas tonight to aid in keeping or
der at the Cudahy Packing company's
plant at Cudahy, near , here, where
one man was killed, eight slightly
wounded and a score injured, in a
clash between strikers and the po
lice this afternoon.
More than six hundred strikers,
men and women, took part in the riot
The wounded and injured were not in
a serious condition, it was reported.
The trouble began when women of
fice employes started to leave the
plant late this afternoon under guard
of deputy sheriffs. A number of wo
men, wives of strikers, threw sticks
anl stones at thm. they rid, a"d
the deputies came to their rescue.
Strikers then joined their wives and
became so riotous that the deputies
drew their guns and fired into the air.
A free-for-all fight ensued and the
deputies said they were forced to fire
into the crowd to restore order.
The Cudahy plant has been closed
for two weeks. A disagreement over
wages and unionizing of workmen
caused the walkout.
A committee of strikers were in
conference tonight, with Michael
Cudahy, president of the company,
trying to reach an agreement that
would end the strike.
This morning a mob of 500 strik
ers stormed a train that stopped at
Cudahy. The men said that they
thought the train brought strike
breakers to the plant. A riot call
was sent out and deputy sheriffs ar
rived. One striker was arrested,
and for a time the men threatened to
storm the Jail. , This feeling brewed
all day and reached a climax in this
afternoon's riot
Paul Helmskie, 35 years old. the
man killed, was one of the strikers.

there was no important . distinction,

"But I am assuming," returned Mr.
Brandegee, "If the council should ad

Autoists Are Warned to Drive
Slowly Over Road While It
Is Bein Worked On; Report
Many Mishaps, Some Injuries
Three automobile accidents have oc
curred In Upper Tombstone Canyon in
the past two days as a result of tho
dangerous condition of the road where
the grading is now being done. V. P.
Hanks was the latest victim, wrecking
his Ford machine Monday night and
bruising himself. Mr. Ranks, a shirt
boss at the Junction mine, was return
ing home about 9:30 o'clock when a
rapidly -moving car came down the
canyon with ehadlights blizing full
strength.
Mr. Banks was partially blinded by
,the glare of the lights and in order to
avert a collision starred off the road
to the right where the 6treet car
tracks cross: There is an open cul
vert at thiii point and the machine
dropped Into it, being badly wrecked.
Sunday a party of tourists ran off
. the grade and overturned, the man and
woman In the party being quite pain
fully hurt. Two children in the party
escaped uninjured. Sheriff James
McDonald came along about that time
and took the victims to town'for medi
cal treatment.
Yesterday a party of soldiers came
down the canyon going at a good rate
of speed, when they struck one of the
many obstructions in the road and one
of the men was thrown from his seat,
striking on his head In the road. He'
also was compelled to have medical
attention. , 1
Residents of the upper canyon have
seen a number of hair raising escapes
as a result of careless driving over the
dangerous road and autoists have been
warned that they must go over this
section very slowly while work Is in
progress.

that he was totally blind. But after
consultation with the greatest of Brit

has, according to the dispatch,, met
with great favor in Great Britain.
There has been much demand in

Strong in eery factor for success, the United States Oil and Refining
Company of Arizona again takes up the quest for oil, this time with
ii
no reason for interruption or chance for delay. '
Wifh the well now equipped with a new 1 4-inch casing, and insured
from caving and flooding, a few shifts will drive the bit into the oil
sand stratum encountered in the first test well at 340 feet; without
any contamination from water. Thus! permitting an accurate quali
tive and quantitive test, with prospects of most fratifying results.
t With the fine California Standard Rig, the drill will rapidly pass
through the shale and sand stratification and, entering the cap rock
at 700 feet, make swift progress toward the area below the cap rock,
where lie stored the pools from which the sand3 above were enriched,
the oil passing into them by capilliary attraction through laminae and
fissures in the cap rock. .
The hour is at hand. The Bowie Field is about to come into its own.
As an oil area it is geologically sound. Only superficial investigators
might question it. '
You have a chance to participate in its rich promise by purchasing
"promotion" stock at 10c a share. The price of the company's, or
treasury stock, is 50c. The promotion stock was the private property
of the original promoters of the company, who have surrendered to
the Bank of Bisbee as trustee four-fifths of their original stock, to be
sold at 1 0c a; share,' the proceeds to be devoted to development pur
poses and not to go into their own pockets. In this way you get
stock worth 50c for 10c in a Company far advanced in development,
sponsored and officered by the leading citizens of Southern Arizona,
assuring you a square deal. It is an opportunity not to be overlooked.
This stock is for sale by J. L. Powell, the company's secretary, at I. W.
Wallace's, Main Street, and L. J. Overlock, Broker. Also by author-'

THE AMERICAN LEGION
JUDGING from the way L. A. Engla post, the Eisbee branch of the
American legion, has entered into home affairs, these young men
are going to have considerable to say about the local and na
tional government they have helped to' preserve. When one con
siders that in the United States there will be approximately 4,000.000
members of this organization and that each one. through his famii)
relations, will help to Influence at least four other persons of adult
age. it becomes evident that we have here a united body which can
exert tremendous, if not decisive, pressure on the policies of tliu
nation.
Already at home we have seen an example of the practical way in
which they have taken up every-day affairs in their efforts to reduce
the cost of living. With the aid of the labor unions and Mayor Enck
son they pushed through the deal for two carloads of army food to
be sold to the people of this district, and have followed this up by
laying plans for a municipal market that may help to bring down
prices of local produce.
That they will be a tremendous factor in politics goes witho.it
saying Thcse men who have fought together and risked their lives
together, are prelty sure to stand together at the ballot box. The
old-fashioned political bosses recognize that In the legion they have
found an organization holding the balance of power which they can
never hope to control. The returned soldier comes back with broader
ideas tha i when he went away and with pretty definite views as to
home needs and desires. Their united power for good can hard.y
be over-estimated. , ,
The basic foundation of the league rests on lofty principles,
which it is to be hoped will not in the stress of strife, be forgotten.
Among these principles are:
To maintain law and order.
To foster and perpetuate a 100 per cent Americanism.
To preserve the memories and incidents of the associa
tion in the great war.
To inculcate a sense of Individual obligation to the com
munity, state and nation.
To combat the autocracy of both the classes . and the
masses. , .
To make right the master of might
To promote peace and good will on earth.
To safeguard and transmit to posterity the principle of
'justice, freedom and democracy. v
To consecrate and sanctify our comradeship by our de
votion to mutual helpfulness.
An ambitious program this, but one which the legion, under
wise leadership, should not fail to accomplish.
REGULATE PROFITS ON FOOD
. ....juin lhn mgrinr nnat of . livinET it mi Kilt -
AS U. lUCIUia iwiiuius -- . ;
be well to consider regulation of profits as practiced during
the war. Ia an effort to reduce prices to the consumer, who
is crying for relief, the federal authorities are seizing per
ishables held in cold storage, apparently with the intention of bring
ing about their immediate distribution. Further efforts are directea
toward additional distribution of perishables under threats of prose
cution. Beyond question, this campaign will reduce prices on butter,
eggs, provisions, etc.. for the immediate present, but will the ultimate
result be satisfactory?
Leaving out the question of manipulation, of hoarding, of pron
tecrlng or any of the other acts charged, the fundamental reason
for storing perishable foodstuffs is to conserve, during the period oi
heavy production, a surplus which will supply the natural demand
during the succeeding period of scant production. This being the
case, is not the public likely to suffer later on in the fall and winter
of this year, if holding of cold stored foods are reduced below a
reasonable level? ' ' . .."
During the operation of the Food Administration,, there were
restrictions upon the amount of food which could be held, but tbero
were further and more severe restrictions upon the profit whicn
could be charged on the commodities in question. Would it not be
preferable to revive such a program at the present time and restric.
profits to a reasonable increase Over cost, rather than to force an
unloading of surplus foods which would be uneconomic, if not
actually wasteful? ,!.
Profit regulation was a decidedly successful factor in regulating
the cost of living, during the. war. Granting that steps of some sM
must be taken to cope with the present situation, it seems logical
that the same remedy would again be successful.
PREFERENCE FOR THE SOLDIER
. ,, w n tho last legislature by Senator Hughes
of Cochise, had become a law. all appointments in Arizona would
be under the civil service and soldiers would be receiving the
preference, says the Tucson Citizen.
As it is soldiers are receiving the preference and particular y
in the highway department, where Lieut. Thomas Maddock, state
engineer, lias a force practically made up of returned sold.er.
There is no guarantee . that this will continue, however, under
future administrations and the only safe way is to take these
positions from the spoilsmen and place them under civil service.
Unfortunately the Hughes bill was killed by the Democratic
majority in the senate. We hope to see it initiated, however
Here is a chance for the American legion to accomplish some real
good for the returned soldier. . .
The Hughes bill provided that the civil service commission, to
be appointed by the governor, should in all cases give the returned
soldier preference where he was competent. This, is as k should
be The man who is good enough to fight for his country and rlsK
his life for the colors is good enough to be a public servant at home.
The legislature turned the soldier down, but he has the initia
tive. It should be an easy matter to put through the Hughes bill
or some other giving the soldier preference in public work under
the initiative.

DOG BITE RESULTS
IN CASE OF RABIES.
GLOBE, Aug. 19 Thomas B. Smith,
of Hackney avenue, is the first resi
dent of this city to be stricken with
rabies following a dog bite. Mr. Smith
was bitten by his pet dog about 9 p.
m. July 31. The dog Ijad always been
very affectionate and Mr. Smith was
petting the animal when it turned and
bit his hand. The dog; ...disappeared
immediately. . after bitingr Mr. Smith
and so- far as cair be learned-the '-4og
has never been located. Mr. Smith,
who Is about 70 years old, is being
given the Pasteur treatment for rabies
and his condition is said to be very
good. He will suffer no serious ef
fects from the dog bite.
Smith's dog, a fox terrier, bit sev
eral dogs and two cats. The dogs were
immediately destroyed, but the cats
were allowed to live several days, to
determine the extent of the malady.
Both cats died within ten days after
being bitten by the fox terrier.
Dr. Wirghtman says this is the first
case, of rabies called to his attention In
this city and warns residents of Globe
to be very cautious of dogs which
show syptoms of hydrophobia. Sixty
five dogs have been destroyed within
the past two months and the cam
paign to exterminate dogs, running at
large, will be pushed with renewed
vigor during the coming month. Resi
dents are advised to keep their dogs
at home or see that they are properly
muzzled if allowed to run at large.

TEMPE PLANS PURCHASE
OF ARMY FOODSTUFFS.
TEMPE, Aug. 19. The tow, of
Tempe is going to buy a carload of
army surplus food supplies if the peo
ple of Tempe want it. This was an
nounced yesterday by Mayor J. A.
Dines.
It is the plan of the little valley city
to order a carload of the army food
stuffs from El Paso, provided enough
orders are filed by Tempe residents to
justify ordering that nantity, which
will total 36,000 pounds at the least.
On account of the lack of city funds
to handle the purchase, Mayor Dines
stated that it will be necessary for the
town to take subscriptions. Each sub
scriber or buyer will be asked to file
a list of foodstufs desired by himself
or herself, depositing a check or cash
to cover the value of the order. The

STORMS DESTROY
A VALUABLE DAM
PRESCOTT, Aug. 19. Roland Ains
worth visited the city yesterday from
Walnut creek and erported the com
plete destruction of his $5,000 storage
dam on the range during a cloudburst
and heavy rains of last week. He
says such a heavy fall of water has
never been known in the above coun
try, and that nothing artificially con
structed could have withstood such a
terrific series of storms as passed
over the country.
The dam had recently been complet
ed and was to have been utilized for
watering range cattle and farming, be
ing the Jargest lake in that section of
the county. It also was to be used for
fishing and pleasure purposes, having
been stocked this spring with black
bass and catfish. The reservoir cov
ered an area of nearly four acres, hav
iug a depth in certain places of nearly
ten feet: It will be rebuilt at once
and utilized next year for the same
purpose.

TRAVELED ROAD DOUGLAS TO
BISBEE NEEDING REPAIR.
DOUGLAS, Aug. 19. Much com
plaint is being made in this city by
those who are called to Tombstone,
the county seat, and. to the Warren
district on business, because of the
seeming neglect of the road now trav
eled while the regular road is being
paved. The condition of this road is
such that with every ..succeeding rain
it is impassible. Itjs claimed that
with little expense the holes cut in the
road during the continuance of mud
could be filled and with some dragging
it could be kept in pretty good shape.
It is claimed that tie paving of the
road between Douglas, and Bisbee was
because of the urgent!: need of a good
road to accomodate the heavy traffic
using it. It is further claimed that the
traffic is as heavy now as it was when
the paving was started and the old
road closed to traffic.
Just when the paving will be com
pleted to Bisbee is something that
cannot be estimated now, but it prob
ably will be six or eight months, judg
ing by progress made since the work
was started.

A STOPY WITHOUT A MOBAW
WUen G. J. Keljy, the baseball scout

bee last week, gn elderly man, roughly
clait end, with signs of care, on, his
featurep stopped hira and asked; "Are
n't jouMr. Kelly?" Kelly admitted
thp truth, really enough, as the old
man seemed a bit timid about asking
such, an essentially personal question.
"Didn't you used to make book at Bel
mont Pork, New York." the old follow
asked, and Kelly admitted this also.
Then the two got acquaipted again.
The old man had been one of the most
consistent bettors and winners of
twelve years ago. when Belmont park
was at the height of its fame as a
race track. He seemed to- have al
most uncanny ''hunches", or the best
of information straight from the feed
box, as he seldom lost a bet. It was
nothing for him to play $10,000 on a
horse straight to win. Kelly and his
partner were refusing no bets, but the
old "man of mystery" put many a nick
in the bankroll. All these incideats of
the good old days were rehashed by
Kelly and the Bisbeeite. Kelly all the
lime expecting a "touch" was due and
that tbo old man had gone the way of
99 per cent of ithe plungers or yore
and was working hard for his daily
"ham and." When the "touoh" did
not materialize, Kelly finally volun
teered and asked the man bow he was
"fiexd." To nave the propor moral
atmosphere the eUI fellow should have
admitted he was "down and out," a
victim of his insatiable gambling
mania, but instead be told in a inatter-of-fact
way how he had quit the racing
game about $SO,000 to the good, had
invested part of it in government
bonds ahd had sunk the rest in a
mine over toward Benson, which he
was at present working, and which
promised to make him' rich. His

WHERE HOARDING IS DONE.
New York Tribune.
That there is any considerable
hoarding by householders is improb
able. It is to their interest to buy
little. Nor is it likely tht there is
marked hoarding by retailers, for they
fear a fall in prices and seek to keep!
their stocks low. But the evidence is
that large dealers have extra goods
which they are holding back. This,
if true, greatly simplifies the proc
ess of remedy,- which is the simple
one of unlocking the warehouses and
selling their contents for what they
will bring. It sounds almost too sim
ple, and perhaps it is. The violent
fall In prices might be only tempo
rary, consumption might be greatly,
even wastefully, increased, and when
the surplus was gone the second 6tate
might be worse than the first.

without hardly knowing I had done a
bit of hard work," sajd Joe Ellinger,
a well known farmer'livihg-at Rock
ford, Wash., while in Murgittroyd's
Drug Store in Spokane, Wash., re
cently. Mr. Ellinger homesteaded his
place in 1880 and has been living
there ever since. '
1 had been bothered a 'good deal
with rheumatism and w& generally
run down in health," continued' Mr.
Ellinger. "I didn't have any appetite
to speak of and sometimes the very
smell of food, or even the' sight of it,
turned me against It and I couldn't
enjoy what I did eat and it seemed to
do me no good at all. At times the
rheumatic pains were so bad I could
not even turn over in bed without
first rubbing my legs till they limber
ed up and sometimes they would
cramp and draw up so I would be in
such pain I could hardly stand it. -If
I. happened to be walking when these
pains and cramps struck me I would
Just have to stop in my tracks, be
cause I couldn't take another step. I
was troubled with dizzy spells, too,
and if I made a quick move I could
scarcely keep on my feet and every
thing in front of my eyes would seem
to go black. I couldn't get a good
night's rest, either, because ,1 was
wakeful and tossed around e good
deal and when I got up in the morn
ing I felt all tirel out, with no energy
to do anything and I seemed to be
getting worse all the lime.
"I was in just this fix when I got
to reading about Tanlac and decided !
to give it a trial to see what it might j
do for me and it certainly proved to
be just what I needed, because since
I have taken it I haven't bad a single
rheumatic pain and my legs don't
cramp or bother me a bit now. 1 1
never get. dizzy any more, either, and
Tanlac sure did make my appetite
pick up, and now just the smell of
food makes me feel all the hungrier
and I can eat anything I want ami
enjoy it and what I eat does me lots
of good, too. I have gained seventeen
pounds in weight and have plenty of
energy and can go to bed at night
ana, sleep sounaiy for eight or nine
nours ana get up In the morning
feeling rested and refreshed, instead
of air fagged ouflike I used to. Tan
lac certainly did the work for me and
that's why I think it's such a fine
medicine and well worth recommend
ing to others."

WEDNESDAY, AUGUST 20, 3910
PITTSBURGH, '.Aug. 19. Francis
Ouimet, of Woodland, risked ' his
health to struggle through the
26-hole qualifying ' round of the Na
tional Amateur Golf championship at
the Oakmount county club, In ordef
that he would not, lose the opportun
ity, he has waited Jfor more than four
years another chrtnee to win the
amateur championship.
Ouimet was barred from amateur
golf in 1916 by the officials of the U.
S. Golf association, who ruled that he
was a professional, because he haa
entered into the sporting goods busi
ness. Later when he went into serv
ice, he was reinstated and this
tournament is the first opportunity he
has had to regain the title he once
held.
The Boston golfer was forced to
play in the rain most of the way. a
number of times he swayed after hit
ting his shots, and he was so weak
on the final nine holes of the after
noon play that he toppled his tej
shots at the 13, 14, and ISth. But he
finished the day with a medal score
of 1C6, in a tie for lfith place, with
the 32 who will continue tomorrow In
match play rounds, i v
Ouimet was attended by two physl
cians after he completed his play ana
was ordered to bed in the Oakmount
club house. . . ,
Physicians said that he was suffer
ing from poisoned tonsils and that his
back was .exceedingly lame, 'Indicat
Ing that he had caught cold.

strained from walking out when Flor
enz Zeigfeld obtained an injunction,
forbidding the Actors Equity associa
tion "to Interfere with" the ' produc
tion. When this injunction, however,
later was vacated, the stars Joined
their fellow actors.
Rumors that managers might "lock
out" actors 1t3- all theaters as the be
ginning of an economic war on the
striking stage stars were denied today
by Will Page.
The actors' association announced it
had been advised by the United States
board of business agents of the New
York Building Trades that the tetter's
members will be revested not to at
tend any theaters controlled by mem
bers of the Producing Managers' Pro
tective association.
The actors also -said they had re
ceived a pledge of support from Lew
Field, asserting he Is not a member of
the managers 'organization 'and that
his company had Equity, contracts.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Aug, 19. The stock
market gave a better account of itself
today, prices recovering materially in
a number of leading shares on- the bet
ter feeling engendered by the settle
ment of the local traction strike. The
day was not without its disquieting in
fluences, however, a new phase devel
oping in the Mexican situation, while
complete demoralization was- witness
ed In the foreign exchange market,
with sterling, francs and lires at low
ests quotation ever recorded at this
center.
Oil Bhares- were depressed" as a re
sult of reports indicating the navy de
partment contemplates drastic action
because of the refusal of Pacific re
fineries to sell their product on terms
imposed by the government.
Trading was in smaller volume than
yesterday, but the movements which
was at its best in the last hour on the
demand for equipments and steels,
comprehended, a relatively greater var
iety of issues.
The transportation division was the
most notable exception, to the higher
trend, that group failing to make more
than slight response to advices from
the northwest, telling of beneficial
rains over agricultural centers. Sales
1,025,000 shares
Bonds, especiall rails, were irregu
lar' with Liberty issues, the foreign
group holding steady. Total sales, par
value, $12,200,000. Old TJ. S. bonds
were unchanged on call.'
THU GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 16. A firm under
tone and absence of liquidation gave
strength to the corn market today.
Dip were frequent, but were readily
overcome . and shorts repeatedly
sought cover. Light offerings . and
cash grain at a premium over Septem
ber were important factors. Corn clos
ed strong, 34 to 5c net higher, Sep
tember leading with final figures,
September $1.83 to $1.83 and Decem
ber $1.44 to $1.45. Oats advanced
to 1 cent and provisions, finished
the day at 50c to $2 higher.-
The extreme weakness of foreign
exchange, sterling touching a new low
point, was reflected in a sag in corn
prices early in the session, btu this
factor was apparently ignored later
when a changed sentiment was ob
served in the trading and buyers
crowded, the' market.
Oats moved in sympathy with corn
with early preponderance of selling
and later stiffening on pronounced
buying sentiment Small country off
erings and some export inquiry con
tributed to the firmness.
Provisions were unsettled, art early
decline being followed by a rally on
strong demand, which moved prices
above yesterday's close. Later fluctuations-
were in narrower limits and
the final figures were about the top
point

GET PHOENIX
"Same . Old Phoenix Gall" Is
Statement of Soldiers As to
Proposal They All Cough Up
For State Legion Building
The Phoenix proposition for a state
"home" for the American legion to
be built at the state capital, as pub
lished in yesterday t morning's Re
view, was met with hoarse bursts or
raucous laughter when read by local
leaders of L. A. Engle post.
"Same old story of Phoenix always
boosting for Phoenix, as the general
sentiment expressed. The plan to
assess Cochise county $20,000 as its
"bit" in building, the home also met
with derision. .
"The first aim of the local branch
of the legion will be a home in Bis
bee," ; said Tom Egan, one of the
members of the executive committee
and one of many ' who expressed
equally forcible viewpoints on the
Phoenix project. , J
"It probably will: be years before
we can erect a building of our own,"
Egan said. "Just now we are trying
to rent suitable quarters where the
pressing business of the post can be
transacted and where the local men
oers can reel at home. After we have
done this, it will be time to talk
about constructing a permanent home
here, but the Phoenix plan for a state
building is only another example of
Phoenix gall.
"It would be a fine thing, all right,
for Phoenix to have a state legion
building erected there; then she
wouldn't have to worry about provid
ing a local club house. Let her eo
ahead and take care of her own
quarters the way the rest of the posts
in me siate win nave to do.
