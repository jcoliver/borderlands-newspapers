THE ASSOCIATED PRESS, The
Germans are in retreat along the
entire front north of the Marne.
Aisne-Marne salient ris about
twenty miles, across and the ad
vance of the French and allied
troops on the arc constituting the
bottom of the sack has averaged
between two and three miles be
yond the line officially reported a
day or two ago.
This means that the German
crown prince and his generals are
extricating their troops from dan
gerous positions as best they may.
Reports from French headquar
ters have indicated' that the Ger
mans were carrying out extensive .
preparations for the evacuation of ;
the territory between the Marne
and the Ourcq, and it is undoubted
that the allies will endeavor with
all their resources to drive in on
the enemy flanks.
Bruyeres, which lies a little more
than three miles to the northeast or
Armentieres. Is at one end of the new
allied positions, and Chaumuzy, soutii
west of Rheims wood, lies at the oth
er. Here the new line unites with
the old.
Chateau Thierry, which was once a
pivotal point of the Germans advance
in the recent offensive, now is teu
miles or more to the south of the al
lied front. All this territory, running
northward from Chateau Thierry as
well as to the east and west has been
retaken largely by the French and
American troops.
The 'battle between Soissons aid
Rheims, said by eye witnesses to be
the greatest of the war on the west
ern front, seems to have been fought
with such ferocity that both sides are,
for the moment, apparently exhausted.
Since the French and Americans
struck the German lines from Fon
tenoy to Belleau a week ago last
Thursday, the Germans have been
forced to reform their lines and pour
into the salient south of the Vests
river many divisions of fresh troops
which were probably intended for use
elsewhere along the front. The effort
of the enemy to stabilize his line has
brought about what for the time beinc
is virtual deadlock, but over the situa
tion there hangs at all times, a pos
sibility and a probability, that some
new stroke would be struck by either
side.
So far as shown by official state
ments, the allies have pushed the Her
mans south of Soissons back to an
extreme depth of over eleven miles,
Oulchy-Le Chateau being the point of
deepest penetration. The Germans
have held their ground on the north
side of the Marne along most of the
line from Dormans east to Reiul and
only here and there have yielded
ground between the Marne and
Rheims.
The line aS it stands at present

DALLAS. Texas, Juiy 27. With one
fifth of the precincts of the state

run far ahead of former Gov. James E.
Ferguson, his chief opponent in the
race for re-nomination for governor.
His vote at that stags was 102,056 as
compared with 39,219 -for Ferguson.
Political writers on the Dallas News
and the Houston Post, two papers
which had supported Hobby through
out the campaign claimed his nomina
tion by majorities of between 300,000
and 400,000.
The vote was record breaking in
size. With women voting for the first
time and the men voters aroused to a
high pitch of excitement by the keen
ness with which the campaign had
been waged for three months, the to
tals ran far ahead of what had been
expected. It is estimated that more
than 740,000 votes had been cast.
Much interest centered in the con
gressional contests. In the seven
teenth district at midnight Congress
man Thomas L. Blanton declared he
had been nominated over Jos. Adkins
of Brady. Win. G. Blackmon and Oscar
Calloway. Close races were reported

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE AISNE MARNE FRONT, July 27
(By The Associated Press). The
progress made . by the Franco-American
troops on the Aisne-Marne front
is censidered Eminently Satisfactory
by the commanders and the failure of
the Germans to employ artillery ex
tensively has tended to confirnrthe be
lief that their heavy guns on the
greater part of the field have been
moved far back, perhaps to a position
which mny mark a new line.
While steady pressure is being main
tained on the arc forming the bottom
of the sack, the allies are determined
ly hammering the flanks where Von
Boehm and Von Eben have concen
trated their armies, returning blow for
blow in the hope that they can hold
out until the main body of the Ger
mans can be withdrawn with a mini
mum loss.
Aerial operations were again of less
Importance today on account of the
weather. It was cloudy all day and
there were numerous showers, mak
ing it impracticable to keep up the
observation ballcon which usually
mark both lines.
Ocacsionally both the allies and the
enemy attempted to use planes but
these in most cases were forced to
descend on account of rain.
There is a growing belief that the
enemy will make no effort to stand
on the Ardre river. Fere-En-Tardenois,

Advertising From Nation's
' Pro-Germans
(Tly Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, July 27 Evidence that
Geo. Sylvester Viereck, whose claim to
Americanism is being investigated, ob
tained $100,000 for his own uses from
pro-Germans who believed they were
contributing to improve the status of
enemy aliens, has been obtained
through examination of witnesses and
of his bank accounts, it was announced
today at the office of Merton E. Lewis,
states attorney general. About half
this sum was invested in German war
bonds and municipal securities. After
America entered the war and Viereck
changed the name of his publication.
The Fatherland, to Viereck's Weekly,
his source of revenue, which was the
German government, was cut off. To
carry on his alleged German activities,
it was charged by Alfred Becker,
deputy attorney general tie employed
agents to collect funds under the rep
resentation that the money was to be
used to finance the agricultural and
industrial labor relief bureau which
he said was organized to aid unem
ployed enemy aliens. These agents,
called as witnesses, told of their work
in all parts of the country and of ob
taining sums ranging from $500 to
$800.
According to Mr. Becker the evi
dence indicated that Viereck paid him
self a salary of $700 monthly and that
the labor organization placed' $400 or
S500 worth of advertising in Viereck's
Weekly each week. In these two ways,
Mr. Becker declared, Viereck appar
ently obtained personal possession of
virtually all the contributions.
"Dr. Wm. Hale in a statement issued
from his summer home at Ashland,
N. 11., tonight denied that he had edit
ed the speech attempting to justify
the sinking of the Lusitanla delivered
by Dr. Demburg in Cleveland, as
charged yesterday by Attorney Gen
eral Lewis. Dr. Hale declared he bad
no "part or lot" in the speech.

CLERICAL LABOR INVOLVED
Numerous applications have been re
ceived by local grocers for changes in

time the cards were issued to con
sumers the latter were asked to ex
press their preference and designate
the amount of flour or bread desired,
provided they did not wish their en.
tire allotment in flour or bread but de
sired some of each.
As a duplicate record is kept of all
cards issued, it can be readily seen
that it would be impossible to change
card record with the grocer and card
record on file in the clearing house
whenever a customer desired to make
a change. The operation of the card
system is entirely at the expense of
j the grocers, who pay the expenses of
the clearing house.
There are at the present time In
I excess of 8000 cards on file in Bisbee.
lc.well and Warren. It can therefore
be readily seen that if the majority o
people desired to change tlieir cards
it would require a large clerical force
to keep these cards in order. This
.natter has been emphasized by the
federal food administrator for Arizona
and it is hoped that consumers will
refrain from requesting changes in
their cards as tlieir dealers are not
permitted to make such changes.

Great Lakes Men Peeved at

British Strike Situation Yet

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. July 27. By an or
der tonight establishing a training
system for merchant seamen on the
Great Lakes similar to that establish
ed in other American waters and re
quiring companies comprised in the
lake carrying association to take re
cruit seamen and firemen on board
their vessels for practical experience,
the shipping board declared it had met
the last "legitimate grievance" in the
union's strike resolution.
Secy. Victor A. Olander of the sea
men's union, said the order of the
board only made the situation worse.
Officers of the union have been ask
ed to a conference tomorrow with
Chairman Hurley and R. P. Bass, 4h
board's labor expert, to determine
whether the men shall go out Monday,
as planned, in a strike which the shin-
ping board has declared could not be
justified at this time when a tie up of
lake transportation probably would
mean paralysis of the war program.
There have been suggestions, that
in the event of a strike, some of the
thousands of men in training for tb
navy at Great Lakes. Ills., might be
used to man the vessels.
The national service - officials
were busy today at Coventry and
Birmingham preparing forms calling
I the strikers of military age to the col
ors should they ignore the govern
ment's ultimatum and not return to
work on Monday. It is difficult as yet
to decide upon effect of the ultimatum
as many taking advantage of the en
forced idleness have gone to their
home or on a holiday.
As far as the number of men out
there is little change from yesterday
Saturday is a half holiday and should
there be any number who have decM
ed to return to work they would be
unlikely to resume before Monday.
The newspaper correspondent sa"3
the government's ultimatum has made
a deep impression on the strikers
which will be shown at the mass meet

mated that only one-fifth of the muni
tions workers of Coventry are unem

Damage Actions Not Legal
ly FUed
Tbe first move of the defense in the
actions field by Struckmeyer & Cleary
was made in the superior court at
TombstoneTombstone yesterday when
a motion to strike was filed in each
ol the 213 suits :ield by those attorneys
in behalf of the alleged deportees.
The motion to strike was short, and
read as follows: Comes now the de
fendants herein and move this court
to strike from its records and files
plaintiff's pretended complaint herein,
for the reason, as appears from said
complaint, that the same was not
signed by plaintiff herein, or his at
torney." It being a fact that in all
of the damage cases filed the com-
p'aints were in printed form and there
was not the sign of a signature or a
written name thereon.
The motion to strike was based upon
the provision of the revised statutes
of Arizona, which says: Sec. 41S. The
pleadings shall be' in writing and
signed by the party, or by his attor
neys and field with the clerk of the
tourt.
Upon the filing of the motion to
strike, the matter was taken up by
Judge Lockwood and September 14th
was set as the date for hearing of the
motion.
There were four of these motions
filed in each of the 213 actions so
that the county was enriched by the

man army in the Soissons Rh tins
salient has retreated to a new
line of resistance.' where another
attempt will be made to meet the
attack of the French, American,
l.ntish and Italian troops.
Thug was the German with
drawal, reported in advices from
Paris, viewed by military officials
here tonight. ,
The retirement of the enemy did
not alter the belief in official circles
that tiie enemy still contemplates fight
ing it out in the region north of t03
Marne. Severe rear guard actions, it
was assumed had been carried on by
the enemy to cover the concentrati-,i
along Jihis line and the hasty throw
ing" upuT field entrenchments. It is
not believed the line could be definite
ly located until it had been reached
by the Franco-American advance
guard in following up the retiriug en
emy rear guard.
Secretary Baker said there was r.o
indication that the vigor of the allied
attack around the ealiont had lessened,
and there was every sign the enemy
was being pressed and harrassed.
General March, in his talk with the
newspaper correspondents, drew atten
tion to the inner pocket of the salient,
where the recent British advance
scuthwest of Rheims threatens a new
pincer movement. Enemy troops
south of this pdvance. between the
British and the Marne are in jeopardy
and the French, today's official reports
show have alreidy progressed In ham

inner pocket by their advances below

been thrown into the Aisne-Marne bat

nounced the formation of two addi
tional American army corps. He ex
plained the assignment of the thirty
divisions which compose the five corps
now organized to their respective
higher units, did not mean the corps
had been actually drawn together.
Many of the divisions still were wi'h
French or British forces for final
training.
Members of the senate mi'itary com
mittee learned from General March
that the july movement of troops tt
France probably would reach a total of
300.000, making a new record. Inci
dentally the movement last week was
put at fifty thousand men. or about one
half of what has been the rule for

FRANK VAUGHN IS
GIVEN COAT OF HIS
OWNJAINT
PRISONERS TAKE EXCEPTION TO
STATEMENTS HE HAD MADE
about' THEM WHICH WERE
PRINTED IN ARIZONA LABOR
JOURNAL
FLORENCE, July 27. It has. Just
leaked out here that Frank J. Vaughn,
state painter who has been at work re
pairing the. buildings on the Inside of
the walls at the penitentiary was on
Monday afternon last subjected to a
coat of his own paint and that it was
applied by the convicts with one of
Vaughn's brushes. The convicts took
exception to a statement that was
made by Vaughn and published in the
Arizona Labor Journal in its issue o
July 19th. According to the story as
circulated here the attention of the
guards was called to one end of he
yard by some of the prisoners and a
few of the others made their way to
where Vaughn was working and tak
ing him into one corner of the yard,
stripped him of his clothes and then
they rapidly applied a coat of gray
point to his body. He was covered
lrom head to foot and then released
and allowed to go. He made bis way
out of the institution and took the next
train to Phoenix and then to Tucson.
There is now another painter on the
job at the penitentiary and it is not
thought that Vaughn will reurn to com
plete the work.
The article that caused the prisoners
to take the action that they did is
headed as follows: "No Union Men in
Florence Prison; Institution Has
Ample Gunmen With More on Way
There.
The article itself is as follows:
"The penitentiary at Florence is,
for the first time since it was built,
being thoroughly repaired and repaint
ed in the interior, Mr. Frank J. Vaughn
the state painter has charge of the
work, and while in Phoenix this week
made the following statement. When
1 arrived at the penitentiary it was my
intention to select from among its in
mates . some carpenters, plasterers,
plumbers, painters, and other mechan
ics to do the repair work, but we found
after a thorough search, that such men
were not there. We did find one man
who claimed to be a carpenter, also
two men who claimed to be structural
iron workers, but their actions, words
and general attitude belied their state
ments. 1 found it necessary to sn
gage some mechanics from the out
side to carry on the work, and the only
assistance we can make use of from
the Inmates of the prison is that of
common labor. I think this matter is
of sufficient importance to attract puo
lic attention, indeed, it is remarkable.
when we consider the great strikes, i
the deportations, and the overbearing, j
threatening and intimidating attitude
of some county officers and gunman
toward the workingmen of the state!
within the last year. I will also say,
that if we need gunmen to help us re-1
pair the buildings, we could get them
inside the walls as prisoners. I under- j
stand that there are some other gun-1
men on their way here now to become I
guests of the state for the satety oi
society."
The Frank J. Vaughn 'mentioned
above was a resident of Bisbee for a
number of years and was engaged in
the pointing business here. When
Hunt was reinstated in the Governor'3
office he went to Phoenix and was
given the oppintment as state painter.
His wife is still a resident of this
city- Vaughn was in the city last Wed
nesday, having arrived from Florence
that morning and stayed until Thurs
day when he took the train west again.
It was noticed when he was here
that his white moustache that he had
worn for years was missing and that
his face and arms had an unusual rud
dy complexion, but those who saw him
thought that it was caused by his
working outside in the intense heat
of Florence and Phoenix. While he
was here he made no mention of his
experience at Florence, although he
talked. to a number of his former
friends about his work.

GRIMES NOW ABLE
TO STRAIGHTEN UP
Had Suffered Torture With
Rheumatism for Ten
Long Years
"I actually gained ten pounds on two
bottles of Tanlac and it has fixed me
up in splendid shape after evctything
else had failed to do me any good,"
said C. H. Grimes, a well known car
penter, of 164 Roy street, Seattle,
Washington.
"For ten long years I suffered tor
tures from Indigestion and rheuma
tism," he continued, "and during the
past two years I became very much
worse. Last Bummer I was in such bad
shape that I was barely able to get
around and just one month ago I felt
bo miserable that I was afraid I'd have
to go to bed and stay there. My stom
ach was in such an awful fix that I
could hardly take any nourishment M
all. What little I did force down soured
on my stomach and swelled me up so :
could hardly breathe and I, was so
weak that I could hardly walk a blocK
without giving out. My head ached
like it would split, my kidneys gae
me no end of trouble and 1 had men
an awful pain in my back at times that
I felt like I couldn't stand it. Every
muscle in my body ached with rheum
atism and my joints would get so stiff
that I couldn't straighten up. My right
leg was lame from the knee down and
I could scarcely use my right hand at
all. My face was so drawn and sunken
in that anybody could see that I mao
a mighty sick man.
"I reckon I took about every medi
cine there is in the market trying to
get well, but I grew worse instead of
better. I hoped against hope though,
and when I heard so much about Tan
lac I decided to try it next. As scon as
I started on my first bottle I felt like
it was beginning to straighten me out
and soon I realized that at last I had
found what I needed. Well, sir, my
appetite has picked up so wonderfully
that I am always the first at the table
u n A thA loot tn InovD M v atnmnr'h i
J in fine condition, and I can eat any
I thing I want without having a bit of
trouble afterwards. My kidneys are
working all right too, and that atul
pain in my back is clean gone. I
haven't a twinge of rheumatism
about me and I am taking on weight
so fast that my face has filled out and
I look like a different person. Tan
lac has helped me so wonderfully that
it is hard for me to tell how grateful
I am for all it has done for me."

Cost of Material
May Delay Work
"The Cochise County Highway com
misison is having Its troubles and it
may be that road work will be de
layed under the bond issue according
to the present outlook," said a high
way official, who was In Bisbee yes
terday. "When the estimates were
made for the present road construc
tion, labor of all k'nds and materials
were anywhere from 20 to 40 per cent
cheaper than today and much of the
material is still soaring. It may be
that the commission will let the con
tract for completing the grading,
draining and bridging of sections one
and two of the Bisbee-Douglas road
on Monday, the commistson having
one bid for that work last Thursday.
It looks as if it will be a long time
before the paving will be done on the
Bisbee-Douglas road. It is possible
that the other dirt road can be con
tracted for, but the entire program
today is a very undecided situation."
The commission will try and unravel
the tangle Monday when they meet in
this city.

THREE
ALL FOOD AND DRINK
PLACES FORCED TO
BE CLEAN
SET OF RULES THAT MUST BE
RIGIDLY LIVED UP TO GIVEN
OUT DURING WEEK BY COUNTY
AND CITY HEALTH OFFICERS
WITH ARMY CO-OPERATION
All stores, restaurants, confeetion
nries, boarding houses or other places
in Bisbee serving food or drink and
some of those merely catering to the
ecrofort of their patrons, such as bar
ber shops and manicurists have been
informed during the week by the coun
ty and city health officers, with the
sanitary corps of the United States
army cooperating, of rules which must
be observed in sanitation for the
health and general welfare of the com
munity. In order to assist in the cam
paign, Capt. II. L. Miller, district san
itary officer, with headquarters in
Douglas, was here during the week
on several occasions, cooperating with
Dr. C. H. Hunt, county health officer,
and Dr. D. Brown, city health ofTieer.
It has been decided between the
three physicians, that as the work of
distributing rule cards, etc., will be
completed about Uie end of this week
a two weeks' interim will be allowed
to intervene; then a complete and
careful inspection of all the places
previously visited will be made. A list
will be compiled and published, show
ing the old and new rating of each
place. This will be done periodically
thereafter.
Among the rules for eating houses
are those concerning proper lighting,
ventillation, screening of food from
flies, adepuate refrigeration, etc. Chief
among all others stands the rule that
no invalid person in bad health may
be employed in a place where food or
drinks are served; in other words
every employe of such places must
stand rigid physical examination and
be shown to be in good health.
"These precautions are highly neces
sary, particularly in a town cf such
physical character as Bisbee," said
CaDtain Miller. "In the past Bisbee
either has had an exceptionally cap
able set of physicians or been extra
ordinarily lucky to have escaned epi
demics of typhoid, typhus and other
communicable diseases."
Instead of depending merely for en
forcement of the rules laid down upon
the action of the law, public opinion
will be called into play to a large
, extent. Thus when the rating of John
Jones, confectioner, restaurant man or
whatever he may be, shows that in the
twa weeks elapsing receipt of the
rules and the first rate taking, be
has made no effort to provide the
sanitary appliances demanded, the
public will liave an opportunity to see
and know Just who these people are
and to avoid dealing with them.
The rules may appear arbitrary but
their enforcement Is necessary for puln
lie welfare, the physicians say. Hence
they will be enforced to the limit. !

PRETTY CHILD MOTHER
TO BE DEPORTED
TO MEXICO
BISBEE YOUNC MAN IS CHARCED
VITH AIDING YOUNG MEXICAN
GIRL TO EVADE UNITED
STATES IMMIGRATION OFFIC
ERS AT NACO,
TUCSON, July 27. ' The most beau
tiful woman prisoner" that has ever
been detained at the inundation sta
tion is said to be Senorita Sara Riva,
17-years-old, who is awaiting the dis
position of deportation proceedings
brought against her here, by the bj
reau of immigration at Washington.
She is charged with entering the Unit
ed States after she had been debarred.
She is of the blonde type of Mexican,
having auburn hair and blue eyes,
and notwithstanding her life has been
one of tragic circumstances ad condi
tions, her features are touched by the
suggestion of childhood and innocence.
She is, moreover, as spirited as a
thoroughbred, and during her examina
tion in deportation proceedings sh
several times crossed her Interrogator.
It is alleged that Miss Rivas entered
the United States at Xaeo, Ariz., sur
repitiously, after she had geen de
barred at Xoga'es. Kenneth S. Kneed
ler, a Bisbee miner, formerly a tele
graph operator at Nogales, Ariz., who
j is her brother-in-low, has been arrested
j and bound ever to the United States
district court here, on the cha.'ge of:
aiding the young woman to enter the
United Siates. It is alleged that Kneed
ler employed an automobile drlvtV
named Ramirez to go to Xaeo fron
Bisbee. and meet Miss Rivas on the
international line near Xaeo. Immi
gration officers had learned of the al
leged conspiracy and placed both Miss
Kivas and the automobi'e driver under
arrest. Kneedler was subsequently ar
rested. It Y'Ts a tragic story thrt the yo'jng
girl told. But seventeen veers of a.je,
she is twice a mother, her first child
being born when she was thirteen
years of age. These were the common
law issue, she said of her relationship
with Jesus Ruiz, of Cananea. a mem
ber, .o" what was at one time the
wealthiest family in northern Mexico.

"For every man in the front ranks
there must be a number of men trained
technically or in mechanics, in the
work behind the lines. I do not nian
that these men must be out or the
danger zone; they aften are in as
grave danger as those in the front
trenches. I mean they imjst be In

Application for canning certificates

Owing to the scarcity of sugar at

it is absolutely necessary for them
to commence work of canning, pre

It is also requested that consumers

They are requested to apply for and

mans arc doing' their utmost to hold
the hi?ii ground southeast of Soissons
for a continuation of their line either
along the Andre or further north along
the Vesle.
The flanks of the French, British
and other armies are withstanding
every effort cf the Germans, who ap
pear to be making a most determined
cTort south of Soissons. The line re
mains much the same as It has been
for the past two or three days, the
only changes being slight advances.
The battle line now totals approxi
mately fifty miles, although there is
no actual fighting along every mile of
it, and is a more broken one, made
so by the character of the enemy's
withdrawal, especially on tho south
i side.
Tho effect has been the presenta
tion o" a hlgnly dangerous, spongy
frcnt. into which any r.irl of the ad
vancing allied line piic'it fall. Were
it not for the bunting down of tho
enemy and cleaning out of poi'its of
obstruction, some parts of the line
could bo far in advance of where they
arc
The Germans have left officers who

illy deserted units sc that at t'mes
it appears almost ironical to refer to
th"ir defense as a renr guard action.
It is uist that, however, although by
any standard except those established
In thi.; war. the almost half daily end
minor encounters would be styled big
battles.
Prisoners brought to one of the
American division headquarters today
were men of the landwehr who con
firmed former statements of prisoners
that the armies engaged in the re
tirt inent are leaving only enough men
to resist efforts to hurry them. Like
other prisoners they professed weari
ness in the war and said this feolin'-'
was general, but supposed they must
go on. since the men in high conimtiid
so willed.
Tho advance was not great, but it
was accomplished in the face ot liurc
irimLers of nm hlne guns. The Amer
icans advanced slightly, their positions
almost in the i ruler of the arc. while
on their risht, the French advanced to
and through Port A-Rin.a;i. one of the
few. places where the Germans were
stil clinging near the north hank of
the Marne.
Another forward movement was th.it
of the Ameri -ill's in Fere Forest w here
they were checked yesterday. The ac

inner edge of the woods. Be'iind the
Americans was tiieir heavy artillery,
which sent shells far over the short,
eneil field of operations into the main
bod'es of the German troops, and also
harrasscd their transport.
The higher artillery was used as a
barrage ir.to and across the fields,
the Germans net replying to any great
extent.
U hon the Americans advanced into
the oj.en, lines cf machine guns con
cealed in the woods, shel holes and
every possible point of cover, swept
them with a murderous fire. It was
insufficient, however, to do more than
slow up the advance, which ecntinued
steadily and cautiously until a group
of houses in the center of the area
had been occupied. This incident of
the advance was characteristic of the
greater part of the resistance alonp

Saving for Service
WHEN the -war began The Mountain States Telephone and Telegraph
Company was ready to render instant serrice to the Government.'1 It
at once, on its own initiative, made the needs of the Government
paramount, giving them precedence over general economic requirements, and
adopted a policy of strict conservation of all its resources.
To meet all the wartime telephone needs of our territory the Mountain
States System has restricted to war purposes new construction and the lim
ited supply of material and labor, as far as possible without impairing the
general service. Every bit of plant equipment has been utilized and new
methods of handling traffic devised. . .
Each telephone user is an essential part of the system upon whose co
operation the conservation of its resources and the maintenance of good

A Resume j
Well, it seems to be over, for the time
being at least, this, the first allied offensive
of the year. To those who allowed fond
hepes to grow in the sunlight of glowing
first reports it will be somewhat disappoint
ing, and even to those who calmly and .
thoughtfully considered it from a most con
servative angle, it failed of their desires, if
not of their expectations. . But the allied
effort was not in any way a failure, even
though it ends leaving the Germans still
defiantly in possession of their present
salient which our headline writers had de
clared in letters a foot high was a death,
trap, and all that ret.
In the first place, Foch's drive stopped
the German fifth offensive dead and en
abled the allies to win back all the lost
ground. In the next place it resulted in the
capture of some 30,000 prisoners and well
over 500 cannon and countless machine
guns and all kinds of valuable war plunder
and supplies. Again, it cheered and heart
ened the allied armies all along the front,
and this most important of all. And in a
corresponding degree it jarred and shocked
and depressed the Huns. It also cost the
Germans a heavy toll of dead and wounded
men. German losses since July 1 5 have
been staggering, Of sixty divisions that
Ludendoerf had in reserve he certainly used
half of them. This means that he will have
twice as much trouble and hard work in
organizing another offensive on any kind
of a scale to be dreaded by the allied high
command.
But probably the most important and
cheering thing about the entire serie3 of bat
tles of the past ten days has been the show
ing made by about a quarter of a million
American troops. It was their first baptism
of fire in a real battle of colossal propor
tions. They more than made good. Not
Washington alone, but Paris and London
glowed over their steadiness, their dash,
their courage and their success. And as for
Berlin, well what it really thought of the
American efforts along the Aisne and the
Marne will not be known until after the
war.
I, may well be that the tide has not really
turned yet in favor of the allies. Another
great German drive may have to be with
stood before the summer ends. But it is
turning. Of that there is not a doubt.
Picked German soldiers have died by the
hundreds of thousands since their lines
swept forward in such irresistable fashion
last March. .. . They cannot be replaced by
the German staff. While, in that interval.
Foch, losing many good men, too, is call
ing upon the Americans now in France,
division after division, to replace his Tom
mies and his poilus in the grim game and
carry it on through to the finish. The first
effects became apparent in the recent bat
tles. They will become more and more
apparent as the weeks go by.
So let us take heart from our successes,
not fearing to look our failures in the face.
We still have a hard, steep, costly road to
go to the top of the hill, but it is appre
ciably closer since Foch's legions stopped
th-s Hun on one side of a salient last week
and drove them reeling back on the other
side of that ssmc salient, closer, maybe
than wc knew.
And if we feel so very badly about our
foes flnunling thrir ftarr3 in our faces along
thz edges of $h;:i picket vrr. so fondly hoped
wo.'ld be !hcir grave. let a:; t?rnember that
the British held r. harder pocket at Ypres for
a long ar.d tcnib-c year before they relieved
the pressure by Icking Mcssines Ridge. The
I Iun's courage and staying qualities here
have nnl yet stood n; severe a test s the
Ti;r.iniirs nice at Yprcs.
Whr.n the battle fb.mrs out next month,
as it sutcy will, rcirrmhor we will have
,-t least another quarter of a million Amer
ican soldiers in the front lines, drawn from
English and French training camps where
they are now almost ready. If they do as
well as their brethren did on the Marne,
it may well be that our triumph, delayed
now, will come then, and be doubly sweet.
There is a vast difference in the temper
ament and disposition and feelings of the
British Tommies and the Ge:man soldiers
on the western front, and nowhere are these
things shown more plainly than in the
songs the soldiers of the different armies
sing in trench and camp. Fritz sings vain
glorious and pompous and serious songs
altogether. The Tommy sings gay and lilt
ing tunes and sentimental love songs and
ditties that bemoan his hard fate in having
to dig in the mud and get shot at. Fritz,
to hear Tommy sing, might easily believe
his morale is low. But it is not so. The
war is too blamed serious for Tommy to
take it that way. He jests over his hard lot
in camp and field as well as he je3t3 with
death when he goes over the top. It is an
Anglo-Saxon trait. Our Spanish war song,
it will be remembered, was "A Hot Time
in the Old Town." Fancy a Heinie singing
that kind of a song! The French are in
clined to stirring and intensely patriotic
songs, but they also have light and vain and
humorsome ditties that they delight to sing
in their billets and along the road.
This column often receives nice letters
from folks who have moved away from
the district and write for the Review, stat
ing that they miss it very much and say
ing other nice things about their old home
sheet. But, for the first time, a Bisbee res
ident writes from a vacation trip impatient
ly to urge that her paper be sent to her at
the stated address for the next month.
When they begin to write from the gay
and sunkiosed beaches of California to tell
how much they miss and need the Review,
then it is time for the entire office force
to swell up a little and take a little more
pride in their simple newspaper. Of course,
it was news from home that this subscriber
wished to see, and not the superlative ex
cellencies of this paper's literary style or
attainment. But, that is just the point.
The ordinary, average, every-day, honest-to-goodness,
heart-beat news from home is
the strength and beauty of an' paper. That
is its mission, to print the news about the
home folks, and print it so that folks both
at home and far away will love to read it
and be glad.
Secretary Baker is being criticised more
and more severely for blocking the exten
sion of the draft age in the last congress.
It is now contended that class one will be
exhausted by September and that there will
be a scarcity of men for continued troop
shipments before additional legislation can
set the draft and training machinery in
proper gear. We have two and one-half
million men now in the army and Baker's
plans call for two million in France by the
end of the year. He will comb the deferred
classes for class one men and, of course,
use the million who became of age June. 1 .
But it is now estimated that we must send
from five to six million men to win the
war. We want to win it next year. About
three million" men will be secured from ex
tension of the age limits, all class one. It
is understood that all class one men in the
country will be sent to the war before men
with dependents are called upon. But by
these are not meant those men who mar
ried after the passage of the draft legislation.

HOHENTOUS HAPPENINGS OF FOURTH YEAR OF
WORLD WAR, AS HEVfEWED BY IRE
ASSOCIATED PRESS
HAS BEEN PERIOD OF EVENTS BIG WITH FATE IN LIVES OF NA
TIONS INVOLVED; TWELVE M ONTHS OF ALTERNATE HOPE AND
CONCERN FOR THE POWERS OF ENTENTE ALLIANCE
HJvents big with fate of nations have
marked the fourth year of the war,
which now comes to a close. It has
been a twelve months of alternate
hope and concern for the Powers of
the Entente Alliance.
It was on July 2S, 1914, that Austria
declared war on Serbia, beginning the
great struggle. During the past twelve
months there have been occurrences
that In 'some aspects have been of
even greater import in their influence
upon the world than those in the pre
ceding period. Russia's collapse, the
Italian defeat last autumn, the stupen
dous drives of the Germans against
the allied armies and the wonderful
defensive operations that have again
and again checked the enemy when
success for him seemed near at hand
have held the world breathless. But,
transcending the significance any
event in the actual theatres of the
war, America's full participation in
the conflict, involving the transporta
tion overseas of more than a million
men to engage in it must remain for
all time the great outstanding feature
of the fourth year of the struggle. It
is upon America that the Entente is
relying (for the men and resources to
turn the tide.
A year ago the number of American
troops going to Europe had not begun
to assume large proportions. A few
regulars and some National Guards
men had been sent to France, but
most of the big military training
camps were still being built and the
men selected as the first contingent
to be called to the colors were still in
citizens' clothes. Until the. first day
of August of 1917 the total number of
American soldiers taken overseas was
26,967.
Soon after that date the movement
of troops was accelerated. Thousands
were despatched across the Atlantic,
during the winter months, but it was
not until the great German offensive
was started late in March of 1918 that
the movement began to assume really
noteworthy proportions. The figures
for the months from Aug. 1, 1917, to
July 1. 191S, follow:
August, 1S.323; September. 32.523;
October, 3S.269; November, 28.016;
December, 48.840; January. 45.776;
February, 4S.027; March, 83,811; April,
117.212; May, 244.345; June, 276,382.
On July 1, 1918, there were 14.644
American Marines in France, bringing
the total number of American troops
in that country and Italy up to 1,019
115. During the recent fighting in France
the work cf the American soldiers has
compared favorably with that of other
fighting men in the world. They have
held sectors here and there along the
front. They are in Alsace and north
ward in the Lorraine sector. The fam
ous St. Mihiel sector is held by Amer
icans, who are posted also on the line
along the heights of the Meuse. East
cf Rheims they took part in the fight
ing during the last phase of the Ger
man offensive, while in the Chateau-1
Thierry sector they held their line in j
a vital region against the utmost fury'
of the Teutonic onslaught. North of I
Chateau-Thierry, Americans helped to!
stop the drive of the Germans in the i
early days of June - and in the Sommej
sector, at Cantigny and Grivesnes they ;
have given proof of their soldierly ;
qualities. ' .
The Allies have been called upon to
face two great offensives during the i
past year. The first of these came i
last Oc tober in Italy and the second
in France, began on March 21. The i
German drives in France, while separ- J
ated by periods of from a few days to '
several weeks, have been considered
as different phases of the same often- 1
give. The abortive Austrian attacic
against Italy in June also is looked up

on as merely another attack against
the western front and not as a distinct
military operation.
But these offensives perhaps never
would have been begun had it not
been for the collapse of Russia during
the past winter. German and Austrian
troops, released from the Russian
front, were taken to France and Italy
to help swell the masses of men hurled
against the Allies in the western thea
tre of operations. As long as Russia
remained in the fight she held great
numbers of Teutonic troops in the
east and her withdrawal from the war
exercised a fundamental influence on
the course of its development.
Situation a Year Ago
The year opened with the fortunes
of war apparently favoring the Entente
The British had forced back the Ger
mans to the famous Hindenburg line.
The French had established them
selves firmly along the Chemin des
Dames, north of the Aisne. The echoes
of Verdun were still ringing fie knell
of German hopes in that sector of the
battle area. The Italians were hold
ing their lines along the Isonzo. The
rejuvenated Russian "regiment of July
First" had carried the war far into the
Austrian defenses in Bukowina and
Galicia.
Through August and September,
1917, there came rumors that Russia
was exhausted by the war. and quiet
settled down along the lines from the
gates of the Carpathians to the Baltic
Stories were heard of fraternization
of German and Russian troops but as
surances came from Petrograd that
Russia would stand true to her allies.
Fall Offensive in Italy
The German and Austrian high com
mands had no illusions as to further
Russian belligerency. There came to
the allies reports that the Central Em
pires were taking the pick of their
fnrpA from the Russian front and con
centrating them for a drive against
some pert of the line in tne western
theatre. Then came intimations that
the blow was aimed against Italy.
The storm broke at Caporetto on
Oct. 26 and almost immediately the
whole Italian line was thrown into dis
order. Pouring through the passes.
where in some instances disaffected
Italian troops held positions, the Ger
mans and Austrians made progress
which from the first was alarming. By
wise generalship, the Italian line was
withdrawn from the Isonzo. It paused
at the Tagliamento and then retired
further until it rested on the Piave,
almost within sight of the domes of
venire Hprp the Italian armv reform
ed its columns, consolidated its posi
tions by withdrawing irom tne nnae
tian mountains to the Asiago plateau
and, assisted by the French reinforce
ments brought to that battle front,
stood at bay.
Russian Collapse
Events in the meanwhile had been
moving swiftly in Russia. On Novem
ber 1, while the offensive against
Italy was under way, Alexander F.
Kerensky, then the Russian premier,
announced that Russia was worn out
by the war and that the allies must
shoulder the burden thenceforward.
Seven days later Kerensky was de
posed by the Bolsheviki. The fall and
flight of Kerensky was the signal for
Germany and Austria to enter into
peace negotiations with Russia. On
November 30 the Polshevikl announc
ed that Russia was cut of the war and
proposed that all the allies join in ne
gotiations for an armistice.
Russian and German represents
tives met at Brest Litovsk on Deceni
hpr 22. and terms of Deace were ex
changed. No progress was made with
the negotiations, and the conference
was broken up on January 11. In the
meantime, a new republic had sprung
from the side of Russia. It was Uk
raine, a territory extending along the
Rumanian and Galician frontier from
the Black Sea northward to Cholm. in
ancient Poland. With this republic,
the Central Empires made peace late
in January. ,
The failure of the Bolsheviki author
ities to reach any agreement with the
Germans resulted in the renewal of
hostilities on February 18, and the
German armies moved forward once
more.
Brest-Litovsk Treaty
This brought about a renewal of the
peace negotiations, and at Brest-Litovsk
the Bolsheviki were given to un
derstand that Germany would recog
nize the kingdom of Poland, the re
public of Ukraine, the independence of
Finland, and tha separate government
al status of Lithuania, Esthonia and
Livonia. Turkey, as an ally of the
Central Powers, was given a great area
to the east of the Black Sea, including
the regions of Batum, Kara and Erivan
With the announcement of the final
signing of the treaty between the Bol
sheviki'and Germany, the Allies gave
up hope that Russia would remain in
the conflict, and at once they began
to strengthen their lines against the
ccming of the great German offensiN"
by which Berliu and Vienna hoped to
force the Entente nations to make
peace.
Rumania Capitulates
With the greater part of her terri
tory occupied by the Germans, Aus
trians and Bulgarians, with her gov
ernment driven from Bucharest to
Jassy and with the Russian lolshivi
ki openly hostile toward her, Rumania
fcund herself in a critical situation.
Rumanian troops during February and
March advanced into Bessarabia, a
part of the new Republic of Ukraine,
but they were hemmed in by the ene
my forces and obliged to withdraw.
At last, on May 6, Rumania signed a
treaty of peace with the Central Pow
ers. By this treaty Rumania lost the
province of Dobrudja, on the south
side of the Danube, which she had re
ceived after the Balkan war, and
agreed to a rectification cf her west
ern frontier. Economic concessions
also were made under pressure from
the Teutonic Alliance.
Peace Tentatives
The period between December 1,
1917 and March 1. 1918, may be called
the period of peace tentatives. It is
true that before the end of the sum
mer Pope Benedict made an appeal to
the warring nations to enter into peace
negotiations, the basis for pourparlers
being the restoration of Belgium and
Serbia and the return to Germany of
her lost colonies. This appeal, made
cn August 13, was answered by Presi
dent Wilson on August 29, when tne
President announced that the German
government as constituted could not
be believed and that the United States
was ready to enter into negotiations
when the German people showed they
desired peace and when they spoke
through any authority which would be
representative of them.
The German answer to the Pope's
appeal reached the Vatican cn Septem
ber 21. It expressed hope that nirtnar
warfare could be averted through the
good offices of the Pope, but declined
to enter into any engagement to meet
what the Allies had declared to be
their minimum war aims.
German Peace Offer
German efforts to secure a peace
which would leave to Germany all the
fruits of her victory gained through
Russia's collapse," and with Belgium
and large portions of France to be
used as pawns at the council table,
beean with the address of Count Czer
nin, then Austrian foreign minister, at
Brest-Litovsk, on December 26. The
keynote of the address was general
peace without annexations and indem
nities. On January 8, President Wilson, ad
dressing Congress, said that the Unit
ed States must know for whom the
German rulers were speaking. The
address was a complement to an ad
dress made on January 5 by David
Lloyd George, the British premier.
To these addresses reply was made
by Imperial Chancellor von Hertling
of Germany, and Count Czernin. The
latter was pacific and conciliatory in
tone, while the former, alluding to
"the good German sword," showed he
was speaking for the militarists of the
Germanic powers.
"Four Principles" Enunciated
To these replies there was rejoinder
by President Wilson, who, on Febru
ary 11, again addressing Congress, laid
down what have come to be known as
the "Four Principles" upon which
peace can be based. Briefly, these
principles were:
Final settlement must be based on
essential justice.
Peoples and provinces are net to be
bartered about like chattels.
Every territorial settlement must be
for the benefit and in the interest of
the populations concerned.
All well-defined national aspirations
shall be met with the utmost satisfac
tion consistent with the future peace
Pope Benedict, in a pastoral letter
issued at Easter, made another appeal
for concord among the peoples of the
world, but it brought forth no tangible
results. At the Pope s behest, prayer3
for jieace were offered in Catholic
churches throughout the world on St
Peter's Day, June 28.
1 In April there came revelations from
Paris that Emperor Charles of Austria
had written letters to Prince Sixtus
of Bourbon, a relative. In these com
munications the Austrian monarch con
ceded the claim of France to Alsace
and Lorraine and hinted that peace
overtures would be welcomed.
As one result of this, ("rant Czernin

Hertling's address voiced (lie senti

intent upon "destroying Germany.'
the war must go on.
The Enemy Offensives
Last winter it became known thai
the Germans were massing rones on
i the western front. Reports came that
'large units were training behind the
lines and that new and more terrible
engines of war than had been known
before were to be used in German er
fcrt to break the Allied lines, crush
their armies and force them to make
peace. The drive was well advertised
aud even the place where it was to be
launched was known with compara
tive certainty.
On the morning of March 21. the
Germans began their attack from the
vicinity of Arras, on the north, to La
Fere, on the south, and centering their
heaviest columns against the British
forces, under General Gough, at St.
Quentin.
Staggering before the impact of the
blow, the I'ritish army fell back rapid
ly. For eight days the Germans pour
ed through the old Allied line in an
effort to crush the British and drive
a wedge between them and the French,
who were holding the lines to the
south. Then came a period of reac
tion and the Germans came to a stop.
They had driven ahead for thirty-iive
miles, along a front extending more
than fifty miles before they were halt
ed. Hardly had their legions been held
before Amiens than a new offensive
was begun in Flanders on April 2. It
swept the British back through Ar
mentierres. but did not break their
lines. The British, with the Frenfh
who were rushed up to the front, stop
ped the Germans after they had reach
ed the hills southwest of Ypres. There,
on April 9, the Germans suffered a
terrible defeat that halted their offen
sive in that quarter.
Foch in Supreme Command
In the midst of the drive in the Rec
tor toward Amiens the Allied nations
took a vitally important step. They
named General Ferdinand Foch, hero
firct httie nf the Marne. gen
eralissimo of the Allied forces on ttje
western front, which mciuues an me
line in Italy as well as in France. Even
the Murman coast, in northern Rus
sia, has been held to be under his com
mand. After a period of quiet, the Germans
attacked once more, this time on the
Aisne river," and in seven days they
.,ur tho Mamo at Chateau Thierry
making a penetration of about twenty-
eight miles. At tne Marne iney rrc
checked and the impetus of the blow-
was broken.
With hardly a day's pause for reor
..niiinn nr their forces, the Germans
again attacked, choosing the sector
between Montdidier and iNoyon, o"
tho ennthern side of the salient driven
into the Allied line during the March
offensive, as the stage or tneir cn
slaughL This offensive ran for five
days and was stopped north of Com
piegne after losses which were des
cribed as unprecedented had been in
flicted upon the Germans.
From June 14 until July 15 the Ger
mans were engaged in shifting their
fr.rre and then they again struck
This time the line of attack was from
Chateau Thierry eastward, around to
th north nf R.heims and then down
the Vesde river to Prunay and from
that village eastward to aiassiges.
Thin attack at the close of the year
developed into one of the most ambi
tious of the German strokes.
Geiaian forces crossed the Marne
over a wide front, but were unable to
make ground against American troops
near chateau Thlerrv and could no'
aHvanre ranidlv further east. They
did, however, forge ahead on the north
side of the Marne and between that
at roam anri the mountain of Rheims.
It appeared for a time that they might
reach Epernay.
Then General Foch struck a counter
blow, which is still in progress. Amer
ican and French troops attacked the
Germans between Fontenoy, on the
Aisne, west of Soissons and Bellieu. cn
the Clignon northwest of Chateau
Thierry. So sudden and powerful was
the blow fiat the Germans leu Dae
rapidly until their reserves could be
hurried up.
The ranid advance of the allies, how
ever, so menaced the German forces
further south that an July 19 the ene-
tnv- hppan a retrpat across the Marne.
On Sunday, July 21, French and Amer
icans entered Chateau Thierry and
pressed on after the retiring Germans.
Since that time the allies have gained
slowly, but steadily, not only south of
Soissons, but also north of the Marne
and between that river and Rheims.
There are indications that a German
retreat from the salient is now under
way.
Italians Stand Firm
On June 15. the Austrians began a
drive against Italy. It was a failure
The Austrians crossed the Piave, but
on the west bank met with such stub
born resistance that progress was im
possible. Slowly the Austrians were
driven back toward the river, and then
the I'iae, swollen by rains, in the
mountains, completed the overthrow
of Austria's hopes. After suffering
terrible losses the Austrians retreated
to the eastern bank of the Piave from
the Montello plateau to the Adriatic.
Minor Operations
Among the year's operations cf com
paratively lesser importance were the
British drives in Palestine and Meso
potamia; the Turkish advance in the
Caucasus; the French and Italian of
fensive in Albania, and the fighting in
the German African colonies.
Jerusalem was captured by the Brit
ish on December 10. and shortly after
ward the fall of Jericho was announc
ed. Since the taking of Jericho the
British forces in Palestine have not
been active on the offensive.
General Maude led the British
trcops into Bagdad on March 11, and
rhnrtly afterward died from cholera.
His fones pushed further up the Tig
ris until the intense heat of summer
terminated rperations.
The Turks alter the collapse of
Russia, took advantage of the demor
alized erudition 'f 'u' Uusiilun torces
to advance through the Caucasus and
i.btain possession of the regions sub
Fen'cntly redid them by the treaty ot
l'r st-l.ltovsk.
The French mil Italian drive in Al
bania, began, on July ti and is stil! in
prepress.
During the year Britis'i force. In
Africa drove German forces before

German Southwest Africa and finally
compelled them to disperse or surren

of the vast rolotiiul po' sessions held
by lier when tile war began..
Submarine Warfare
' The past year has been marked by a
gradual decline of submarine sinkings
as compared with t lie number of ships
being built by the Entente allies. The
operations of the British a.id Ameri
can destroyers have spread terror
among the "wasps rf the sea," while
a great mine field completed In May
by the British navy converted virtual
ly the whole North Sea Into an area
closed against I'-boat activities.
The harbors of Zeebrugge and Os
tend, from which German submarines
had been operated against Entente
shipping, were either sealed entirely
or made virtually valueless as submar
ine bases by daring naval and air
raids by the British in May.
U-Boats in American Waters
German submarines visited Ameri
can waters in June and san' at least
ten ships, the field of the U-boat oper
ations being from fie North New Jer
sey coast south to the Virginia Capes
and easterly half way to tne Bermudas
The only United States transport
lost while carrying troops to Europe
... a a tha XllQlJllim wllll'll W3S tOmP-
doed off the north coast of Ireland on
February 6 with a loss of ll men.
Hospital Ships Sunk
During the year eleven hospital
ships have been sunk by submarines,
the latest and most flagrant case cf
this violation of the Geneva Conven
tion being the destruction of the Brit
ish steamer Llandovery Castle, carry
ing Canadian nurses and doctors. This
took place on June 27. only twenty
four of the 258 persons on board being
rescued.
The total shipoing reported sunk
since August 1. 1917. is more than
3.250.000 tons.
Against this destruction of shipping
tha Allies have combined their shlp
t.i7i.ino ranaeitv The actual number
of tons tf shipping launched and put
into service nas not oeen p'iriif iru.
Official announcements; have been
made in the recent past, however, to
the effect that more ships are being
hm than am heinz sunk. On Julv 4
ninety vessels were launched at Amer
ican shipyards.
Losses in Battle
The year's fighting has entailed
oit irvsaeo for most of the belliger
ents. During the drive into Italy last
October and .Novemoer tne teutonic
armies claimed the capture of more
than 180.000 Italians. In the German
offensives in France this year about
190,000 French. British. American and
Portugese were reported to have been
taken prisoners.
Added to these losses are the cas
ualties in killed and wounded. No
Hofintta figures have been issued by
Germany and Austria but it has been
reported on what appears to ne goou
authority that in the fighting from
March 21 till June 14 the Germans lost
mrra than r.oo.ooo men. The French
and I'ritish losses were considerably
smaller, as the Allies were iignung
from entrenched positions.
Financial Aspects

great Liberty Loans. The proceeds

The total cost of the war to England
up to December 15. 1917. was placed
ot I R ! nnfi nnO while French votes
of credit are somewhat smaller. At
latest reports the total of the oerman
war loans approximated $31,000,000-
000.
Internal Disorders
Thoro hova hppn numerous reports
of disorders in countries engaged in
the war. Riots ana Diocasnea uuvc
been reported from Germany and Aus
tria manv times during the past spring
and summer and there is little doubt
that the Slavic races of Austria are
seething with disroutent.

stage in this connection early in May.
when a pro-German plot was aetecieu
in the. bud. with the arrest
of seventy-eight leaders of the Sinn
Fein.
Recently disaffection was reported
in South Africa, but it has apparently
been stamped out.
One Monarch Died
During the year cne ruler of a bel
ligerent country died. The death of
the Sultan of Turkey was announced
in June, subsequent reports intimating
he had been murdered.
Assistance For Russia
Since the collapse of Russia, the Al
lied nations have sought to find a way
to assist the people who are being ex
ploited by the Germans. French, Bri
ish and American forces have been
landed on the Murman or Kola penin
sula, on the north coast. They have
not actively intervened, however, be
ing there only to protect Allied prop
erty which had been landed at the port
of Kola before Russia withdrew from
the Entente Alliance.
In Siberia there is a well-defined
anti-Bolslieviki movement which has
been built up around Czecho-Slovak
priscners of war who armed them
selves and inflicted defeats on the
Bolsheviki. A new government has
been set up there under General Hor
vath, president of the Chinese Eastern
Railroad. Japanese, British and Am
erican Marines have been in the city
of Vladivostok for months.
Neutrals
Countries which are not engaged in
the war have suffered during the
twelve months. Switzerland and Hol
land, being adjacent to Germany, have
been threatened by the Central Pow
ers a number of fines in matters rel
ative to eccncmic concessions. Hol
land especially, has been hesct with
difficulties, and at present the Allies
are protesting against her exporting
supplies to Germany.
Norway has signed an agreement
with the United .states by wuch com-
' mi Trial relations may he earned on.
Sweden has been dealing openly with
I Germany and h;is been threatened
'with a virtual bovrott bv Great Brit
ain. Both nations have lost severely
through depredations of German sul
iiiarines. Denmark is In a serious plight also.
a:ul it has been reported that there is
great suffering aniens the people of
that country.
New Belligerents
Tl'ree new ro'tntries have declared
war mi Germany il'inns tlie ye.ir. Thrv
are Ccsta Kiia, Guatemala and Hayti.
The Argentine, although near a break
because of the machinations of von
Luxhurg. the German ambassador at
Buenos Aires, has taken no step in
that direction. Mexico has remained
neutral.

LITTLE TALKS ABOUT
YOUR
KEEPING the Iitte things the things
you may think unimportant in
good shape on your Ford has a lot
to do with its life and service.
If you lose a grease cup on the road,
replace it. It costs only a few pennies and
you can't get the right lubrication without
it.
See that your spark plugs are clean and
not cracked. See that your electrical con
nections are snug and the insulation per
fect. Tighten up any nuts and screws
that work loose.
Little things like these mean months
or years more service from your Ford.
Drop around now and then and have the
little parts that are worn replaced. That's
the cheapest way to keep your Ford in
fine fettle.

Repair work on 700 feet of the Un

reopening that property. The shaft
was built about ten years apo and has
been shut down for some time. When

was thought advisable again to open
it, discovery was made that the tim

Lowell shaft. About 80 feet of materi
al remains to be gone through before
the connection will be completed.
The C. & C. shaft will be down to

so small that it actually will he neces

COMPLETE NEW HOSPITAL
DETROIT. Mich.. July 13. One of
the most cemnlete hospitals in the
world, expected to take a large part in
the work of rehabilitating American
soldiers wounded overseas, is being
erected here by Henry Ford, erected
faster than the average building is con
structed in peace time, because of gov

of materials.
On a 20-acre tract the hospital,
which will bear Mr. Ford's name, will

It will be a four story structure with

Information Gathered

Tell Quite Pleasing Story of
Industry
Have Common Purpose
Several factors are responsible for
this situation, but all with foundation
based upon the war needs of the Na
tion. Such speeches as those deliver
ed by Major James Douglas in Doug-
Has and P.isbee during the present
week and which will probably be re-
peated during his coming visit in the
northern part of the state, have been
h'shly important. More than anything
else, of occurrence to this time, they
have brought it home to the mining
districts that everybody is on a com
mon footing and that there is really on
ly one jrb on hand licking the Hun.
Liberty Loan work in which the miner
and the shift boss and the superinten
dent and the manager have worked
shoulder to shoulder, and then turned
with the same solid ranks to lied
Cross subscription lists, has been a
great eye opener. Everyhodv has
found everyhodv else strict'v human,
and the work of digging metal to car
ry on the war and to protect the sol
diers of the nation has gone on with
new and steadily gaining spirit.
Facing New Period
All of this is or double importance

of eliminating the loal work caused

SMALL OPERATORS

IN
IMPETUS GIVEN PRODUCTION
FROM SMALL PROPERTIES OF
ARIZONA TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF 26 CENT METAL
If the war industries board sought
to ascertain through its advance in
the price of copper whether such
course would have the effect of stimu
lating production, it is likely to get
an affirmative answer through the
July returns, and a strongly affirma
tive one. through August results, pro
vided the 21 ct. price is continued or
still further advanced.
The results from the higher price
are not so marked in relation to out
put of the big concerns, but they are
most notable in the heavier shipments
and operations of the small operators
and leasers. These are encouraged,
or rather enabled, to mine and ship
medium grade ores with their limited
grade and are responding with stead
ily increasing shipments to the cus
tom ere divisions of the smelters. A
sufficiently higher price to enable the
larger operators to get into their low
grade coupled with assurance that the
higher price would prevail for a suf
ficient time to justify the increased
expense of opening into the low grade,
would duplicate the results now being
got from the .small operators.

(P,y H. J. Minhlnnick)
Voicing from its clangorous throats
the great symphony of copper, the last
word in the science of metallurgy and
the supremacy of Arizona and the
Verde district in the production of the
red metal, the magnificent new smelt
er of the United Verde Extension Cop
per company is in operation after
many months of tireless effort on the
part, of its owners, its designers, its
engineers and superintendents, and fis
faithful corps of workmen.
My only task Is to endeavor to trace
the progress of a car of ore from the
time it is hoisted at the mine until the
finished matte is piled on the bullion
platform for shipment to the refinery.
Transportation From Mine
Pending the completion of the great
haulage tunnel, the ores from the
mine are transferred to the smelter
in thirty-ton Ingoldsby ore cars over
the rails of the Clarkdale branch of
the Santa Fe. Prescott and Phoenix
railroad, the cars, on "arrival at the
smelter, running on tracks immediate
ly over the receiving bins, into which
the ore is dumped and from which it
is discharged into a 1300-ton bin placed
below the others.
From this bin it is carried on a huge
belt convever to the crushing and
sampling plant where the usual samp
ling cf the ore is done, the samples
being sent for assay to the assay of
fice, which is one of the most com
plete in the southwest and fitted with
every appliance for the most accurate
determinations.
Crushing Plant
The crushing plant is equipped with
a No. S gvratory and 4S-inch Simonds
vertical disc crusher. ' From these ma
chines the ore is sent on conveyor
belts to the bedding bins.
The ore for the blast furnace is
crushed to three and one-half inches
in size and that for the reverheratory
furnaces to approximately three
eighths of an inch.
To Blast Furnace
Taking first, the oxide ores which
are treated by the blast furnace, the
coarse ore is taken from the coarse
bedding bins by belt conveyors dis
charging by trippers Into hoppers or
bins above the blast furnace charge
floor. Other bins contain the neces
sarv flux and coke and the charge car
which is stationed on platform scales,
is filled from the several bins contain
ing the necessary materials for the
charge ore. coke, and fluxing mater
ial. The charging apparatus is arranged
to secure the verv maximum of ac
curacy in assembling the- furnace
charee and it is claimed that it will be
possible to regulate each charge with
the most absolute accuracy to a sin
gle pound of each ingredient.
The charge car discharges directly
into the blast furnace which is of the
most up-to-the-minute design but which
in its broader aspects, presents no
great differences from the patterns of
furnace in operation at the Calumet Sc
Arizona and other modern plants in
the west.
To Converters
After being reduced in the blast
furnace, the ore is tapped into a matte
ladle and taken by a forty-ton Morgan
crane to one of the three converters
for filial purification and reduction In
to commercial matte.
The blast furnace has a capacity of
from r00 to S00 tons per day.
The slag is tapped off In the usual
way into slag cars which are hauled
by electric locomotives to the slag
dump.
Sulphide Ores
The finely crushed sulphide, ores are
taken from the fine storage beds bv
conveyer belts to n series of hoppers
located above the Wedge roasters lo
cated in the roasting plant, where the
ore Is calcined in the usual manner.
The fumes from the roasting plant
pass through a dust chamber to the
erc- stack as do also the fumes from
the blast furnace.
To Reverberatories
The calcines are taken in hopper
bottomed cars to bins which serve the
reverheratory furnaces, being removed

The Flux Mining company, compos

last Monday. The first shipment of
three car loads of concentrates was
made Friday and it Is expected that a
total cf five carloads will be sent from
there to the El Paso smelter before the
first cf August. However, the mill is
not working to capacity at present and
will not be until August 1. It now is

The ore is a sand carbonate carrying
an average of 5 ounces silver anil 10

The Bisbee company took the prop
erty over in March. Prior to that time
it had been worked by R. R. Richard
sen of Patagonia, its owner, and by
other stock companies which had been
formed to develop it. However, be
cause of the refractory character of
the ore only about 60 per cent of tiie
values could be extracted. The flota
tion process utilized by the Shattuck
paved the way for success for the lo
cal men and they took hold of tho
Flux giving a five-years' bond of
$130,000 for it. Mr. Kollberg was chos

president, and Mr. Stafford mine man

the company has approximately 173;

The property lies one md a half

roadbed being hard and smooth. Mr.
McGregor said.
While many minor details remain
to be adjusted between now and the

of the company that the mill will be
running at full capacity or very near

DONNELLY SAYS
COMPENSATION
. BILL GOOD LAW
TUCSON, July 27. That the pro
posed workmen's compensation meas
ure, which has been initiated and will
be voted on in November, is meritori
ous and the best law of its kind ever
offered in the United States is the
opinion of John L. Donnelly. Donnel
ly is one cf the foremost advocates of
the organized labor movement in Ari
zona. He is a former president of
the Arizona Federation of Labor.
Dcnnelly feels that the fight being
made against the measure by certain
officials and other members of the
organized labor movement in the state
is the result, chiefly, of ignorance,
(supplemented by a suspicion that ev
erything in which the corporations are
interested is inimical to the future of
organized labor.
"The workmen's compensation law
that is being proposed to the voters of
Arizona for their approval this fall is
the most comprehensive measure ever
offered in any state in the union." de
clared Donnely yesterday while in
Tucson. "It proposes the payment of
the largest sums of any compensation
law in use at the present time and
actually compensates the dependents
of anyone who comes within its scope.
"Another feature of the measure is
the fact that it will tend to establish.'
in tne
western country particularly,
a different relationship between em
ployer and employee. The law will
make for mutual forbearance and con
ciliation instead of antagonism.
"Some union men may take excep
tion to the fact that many of the cor
porations are in favor of the law, with
out entering into the merits of the
measure. This weuia not De me ursi
time that the organized labor move-1
ment and the corporations found them
selves upon common ground and acted
in concert. It is not generally known
that union labor and the corporations
joined hands in beating the Kinney
bill at the last regular session of the
state legislature. Ofttimes we find it
expedient to shake hands with the
corporations and act in concert with
them. This is particularly so at the
present time with the world war going
on."
It is Donnely's opinion that a great
majority of working men of the state
will vote for the compensation meas
ure. He declared it is only a matter
of getting the merits of the bill before
the voters.
GREAT PLANT

nished with spouts discharging into
the side and back of the reverberator
ies. These furnaces are fired, with pow
dered coal and this feature is one of
the most interesting of the entire
plant. It will be described in some
detail a little later. For the purposes
of the reduction in the reverberatories
it will suffice to say that the powdered
fuel is fed from bins by means ot
variable speed screw conveyors, drop
ping into mixing pipes, of whiclt there
are four to each furnace, where it is
mixed with air at a pressure of four
ounces about that cf the ordinary
blacksmith's forge.
The mixture of powdered coal and
'air ignites immediately on entering the
furnace, the color of the flame near
the admission nozzle being a brownish
red which changes within a few inches
into a reddish white and almost in-:
stantly into an intense and dazzling
blue white blaze which effects an

receipt at the works, it is unloaded
into storage bins from which it is tak-
en by belt conVeyors through a crush -
or ivhiVii rorinros thp fuel to one-inch
From the crusher it moves by screw
conveyors and elevators to the storage
bins, thence feeding to a rotating dry
er which extracts the greater percent-
1 age of the contained moisture. From
the dryer the coal is fed to a battery
of Fuller ball mills where it is pow
dered to a fineness that permits eighty
five per cent to pass a 200 mesh screen
while from ninety-five to ninety-eight
per cent will pass through a 100 mesn.
To readers not familiar with measures
of fineness, it may be said that this is
about the consistency of the best cem
ent As the name indicates, the mills are
operated 'by means of heavy revolving
steel balls which reduce the coal to
the desired fineness. As the dust
arises from the bottom of the mill it
passes through a blower fan contained
within the casing, which forces it
against a screen, any particles too
coarse falling to the bottom of the mill
to be further reduced.
In Use
As was stated in the section descrip-
tive of the reverberatory furnaces, the
powdered fuel is blown from the mills
to bins and from these it passes by
screw conveyors of Variable speed
either to the reverberatories or to the
two single boilers wnicn are mus ureu
The principle oi comousuuii in m.
fireboxes of the boilers is precisely
the same as in the reverberatories
the fuel is fed at predetermined speed
into a mixing pipe where It receives
the necessary amount of air and is
then blown into the firebox where com
bustion takes place precisely as in the
furnaces, the small amount of ash re
maining being carried to the stack.
Power House
The power house equipment Is, nat
urally, complete in every detail and
the house itself has been arranged so
as to permit the installation of addi
tional engine and dynamo units as the
same may be required.
For the converters, there are provid
ed two 1S.0O0 cubic foot blowing en
gines and for the blast furnace two
400 ft. Root type blowers.
All drives throughout the plant are
electric and the dynamo Installation is
cnrresnondinclv extensive. The gen

NORTH TIGRE PLANS

TIC OVER PROSPECT OF DEVEL
OPING BIG MINE ADJACENT TO
EL TICRE HOLDINGS IN SONORA
Frank J. Holmes, manager of the
North Ticre Leasing company's prop
erty, which was formerly the North
Tigre Mining company property, has
just returned from a trip to the mine
and other sections of Sonora.
Mr. Holmes states that in all por
tions of Sonora there is great activity
among mining people, new mines are
being ripened up and new companies
being organized to operate some of
the properties which have been idle
for vears owing to the unsettled con
ditions.. Mexican capital as w ell as i
much American capital is now going
into that section, and he looks for
some big things being done immediate
ly south of the border in the very
near future.

the North Tigre property for years,

Of Interest
The seed of gardening in these war
days has been planted in every wom
an's heart, but like everything else,
takes time to grow and the place to
make it grow. Heretofore all one's
energies have been devoted to the cul
tivation of flowers, now that is all
changed when every spare moment is
spent in working with the most prac
tical vegetables. We find corn grow

matoes dangling in place of purple
fuchsias and beans and squash trained
with tender care. Of course the great
est of care may be taken with each
small shoot but one wishes in her
feminine heart to look her best.
So the garden smocks of summer
are simply conducive to go a-diging.
Made of crepe, linen or some other
summery fabric, they are embroidered
and trimmed so that as great a vari

MA'AMZEUE
AT THE MOVIES
The movies would be alright if it
weren't for the inevitable people in
hack of one. They seem to be sitting
there for the sole purpose of removing
all the joy and knowledge that might
be gained from a picture. It is not
necessary' to enjoy a play only with
the kind of silence that is spoken of.
that a pin could not be Jieard if it fell,
that would be appalling, and is not de
sired, but just comparative peace.
There are so many different topics
that are discussed at the theatre, it
is a problem to know just what form
of torment is going to befall one. The
mcst popular is conversationalist
fiends. The moment that they resume
their seat alter the "Star Spangled
Manner," they begin for the evening (
until the last beam fades. They never
allow any sort of emotion that is de
picted upon the screen to interrupt
them, go right on talking through the
mcst tragic parts. They can talk an
entire evening upon any subject, but
the most favored is the subject, disease
in all its forms, symptoms and effects.
With wide experience along these
lines, never omitting a detail and re
lating each pain from the moment they
were taken ill until the all supreme
moment of coming out from under the
ether. Then too in every single case
it is the very worst case of its kind
that the doctors have ever seen.
Some one has called these people
conversation hounds, and another ac
cident that occurs with startling fre
cjuency is having the misfortune to sit
in front of two people who have not
met for some time. This entails a
long disclosure of an almost entirely
1 local nature, of the recent deaths,
births, and marriages of their friends
and relatives. Theda liara may vamp
land l!ill Hart may fight but nothing
so trivial could engage their thoughts
and the most baffling mystery imagina
ble is why it could possibly interest
any one present.
Another variety of an annoyance
that often ruins a whole evening is
the nuisance who acts as interpreter
to whoever they may be with. It is
an insult to one's intelligence to have
each line read and explained as well
as the fact that it leaves the poor un
fortunate who is being explained to in
the light of a mental delinquent. They
then go ahead and tell the story as
1 though it would not very soon be un
raveled before their very eyes and
speculate as to the end if they have
not read the book or viewed it before.
The climax never comes for them for
they are too busy saying. "I told you
so." This type is the mcst familiar
of nil provoking movie fans.
Then one of the most entertaining
of all the people who sit near are
those that know all the inside life of
an actor, that Mary Tiekford Isn't
nearly so demure as she looks, they
whisper, that they know Dounlas Fair
banks personally, that the leading lady
used to be a chorus girl and that her
hafr lias been dyed because they used
to see her when she was a brunette.
I And of the scandals concerning hem
I it could not be all told in cue evening
it wculd seem but they get along pret
ity well, for only having a few hours.
I Then the people that always see the
(play through a blur of wrong impres
isions, they come in during the middle
of the show and every one must move
and make way. while they obstruct the
view of some one who is especially en
thuscd and looks extremely unpleas
ant as though you were deliboratel
planning not to let them see again dur
ing the evening. These people guess
at the characters and speculate as to
just w ho is who. They e ven get n:cd
as to what the play is whether the
comedy or the feature.
Then the young things that seem to
feel as though they must hold hands
and murmur soft things to each other
Anil everything reminds them of some
thing in their own lives. They always
behave as though they were the only
ones present.
Of course a certain amount of talk
ing is to be expected, but not the de
tails of the ills of life figuratively and
literally discussed and commented up
on. The movie is a recreation and a
pastime not a gadfest.

Dead of American Army; j
Aids in Proper Internment
PARIS, June (Correspondence of
The Associated Press) Thousands of
miles from their maternal hearth, the
American dead; heroes of the second
battle of the Marne who have suc

French mothers, fathers or sisters who
have felt the sorrow of the kindred of
these heroes. 1
Daily, the funerals leave the ciy
hospitals for the little cemetery dedi

Paris overlooking the capital. Daily,

marches forth to the funeral to be

guard of honor and though no volley
is fired because it is forbidden by the
French authorities, the American bug
ler sounds "taps."
A service is first held in the little
chapel in the hospital. Protestant
chaplains officiating over the dead of
their faith and Catholic priests over
theirs. The hospital organization such
as can be spared including nurses, or
derlies, clerks, doctors, attend the ser
vices. The bodies are borne from the chai
el to ponderous army motor trucks.
As each body is brought to the con
veyance, the Republican Guard and
the Marines execute "present arms."
When all t.iie dead have been placed
upon t"::eir military bier, the process

head are the chaplains in motor cars.

The coffins are draped with Ameri

one given by the Republic of France
r.iid another by the City of Paris. Tri
color ribbons bind the wreaths. In
letters of gold, the ribbons are marked
"Aux Defenseurs de la I'jtrie."

STORY OF NUMBER 40
40 years ago an old doctor was put
ting up a medicine for diseases of the
blood, that cured the worst cases of
specific blood poison, and time proved
i that the cures were permanent. After
many years I sccuri-d the pi rscripticm
(being a druggist), ami took each in
gredient separately and reterred to my
U. S. Dispensatory and other books on
medicine and found the medical prop
erties set down as follows: "Kmployed
in diseases of the glandular system, in
blood poison, scrofula, constipa; ion,
stomach and liver troubles, chronic
rheumatism, catarrh, in so.es. ulcers,
skin eruptions, mercurial and lead
poisoning. I'uder its use nodes, tu
mors and scrofulous swellings that
have withstood all other treatment
disappear as if by niticic." To com
memorate my fortieth y ;;r as a drug
gist I named this medic'iie Number 4
