AUSTRIAN LINE SMASHED
BY ITALIAN OFFENSIVE
BATTERIES
OF
EFFECTIVE
Huge Guns Hauled Down To
Isonzo Front To Assist In
Advance On Big Adriatic
Seaport.
(By Review Leased Wire).
On a front of nearly ten miles on
the Carso Plateau the Italian troops
have smashed the Austrian line bard
and taken various positions from the
town of Castafinavizza, Gulf of
Trieste. In their renewal of their
offensive the Itajians received vali
liable aid from some of the nine Brit
ish batteries that have hauled their
big guns down to the Isonzo font to
help in the efforts aimed at in the
conquest of Trieste, Austria's big sea
port on the Adraitic.
Not alone were the Italians suc
cessfu Itn capturing numerous point
cf vantage, but more than 9000 Aus
trian prisoners, including officers in
excess of 300. were taken. The Aus
trians were taken by surprise by the
sudden onslaught of the Italians, who
to divert, attention from the southern
end of the Isonzo line had struck a
hard blow to the north. ,Later the
Austrians launched heavy counter at
tacks but the Italians held the ground
they had won.
' The now advance of the Italians
brings Ihem appreciably nearer Tri
este, which, fom the lower part of
the line, is less than 10 miles away.
The ground traversed and yet to be
passed over is difficult for military
operations and with other successful
advances such as the last one, the
objective of tne Italians will not be
attained except by fighting of a most
deeperato nature.
Comparative calm prevails on thq
western front in France held by the
Pritish hut farther south around' the,
bend in the line fom Soissons east
ward, intensive artillery duels are in
projrress between the French and the
Germans, being most severe in the
regions of Moulin de Vauclerc, the
Californie Plateau and Chexreaux.
On none of the other fronts has
there been an engagement of any
great importance.

bonds by the action of the Railroad
Liberty Loan CommHtee, headed by
Alfed H. Smith, president of the New

Presidents of every railroad In the
country to assist their employes to
buy bonds on installments.
The appeal to the railroads' execu
tives pointed out that more than 1.
500,000 men are engaged In the trans
portation industry and their annual
wages approximate $15,000,000. The
committee was formed, they were
told, to aid In providing the machin

a bond to be paid for out of their fu

leave the service of a company, it
was suggested the obligation to sub

War Preparations Made By United States Are Remark

ASHINGTON, May 24.
American people today
warmly expressed thanks
with which the British war mission has been received in the
country, declared that what the United States has accomplished
dunng the forty days since the United States entered the war
is most remarkable and said he would carry back to the Allies
his belief that with as little delay as human inperfections allow
the full and decisive weight of America would be thrown into
the struggle for democracy.
The message was delivered through the Washington cor
respondents gathered at the National Press Club to hear the
last speech of the British statesman. It was spoken with evident
feeling. '
Of those who say that war preparations of the United
States have proceeded slowly, Mr. Bolfour, said they "know
very little of the actual way in which public life is and must be
carried on in free countries."
"I think that what has been accomplished in these forty
days most remarkable," he said.
American Press Praised for Patriotism
He added that he felt confident
congress would give the President the
great powers necessary to successful
conduct of the war. ,
In expressing the mission's grati
tude for the reception given them,
the foreign minister spoke of his re
gret of being unable to visit many
other cities and voiced the hope that
it could be done at a later and hap
pier time. To the correspondents
themselves and the American prees
generally he paid a tribute for their
"accuracy and patriotic principles."
Mr. Balfour called on President
Wilson at the White House today for
probably the last time during the
visit of the mission. The two states
men have established a real personal
friendship.
Winds Up Affairs
The mission spent the day In wind
ing up Its affairs and making ready
to leave for Canada. Everything has
been accomplished that can be until
final legislation is passed by congress
and the mission Is able to leave with
a clean slate after nearly tlx weeks
on American soil.
Joffre Butler, of the foreign office,
who has been the press representa
tive of the mission., received orders
from London today to remain In this
country for some weeks longer. At
the Press Club meeting resolutions
were adopted asking Mr. Balfour to
express to Mr. Butler the gratitude
of the newspapermen for the states

handled his delicate task.

CHICAGO, May 24. Pitchers convicted of using the "bean ball," a highly
dangerous ball thrown directly at a batter's head, will be expelled from organ
ized baseball as a result of a ruling by the National Commission here today.
The ruling was not alone directed to players in the major leagues but to every
member of clubs operating under the national agreement.
The commission's ruling, as announced by Chairman August Herrmann,
follows:
"it has come to the notice of the National Commission that certain pitchers
are being charged with using the 'bean ball' which charges, if true, will not
only be a great detriment to the game, but; would result in most severe in
juries to players and would be unsportsmanlike in the highest degree.
"ihe commission tnereiore serves notice that if a charge of this kind is
presented to it at' any time against an player, and after an examination
thereof the same is proved, it will result in the expulsion of the player) or
piayers so charged from the game."
Chairman nerrmann characterized the "bean ball" as brutal and added
that he couid not force himself to believe that a pitcher would deliberately
hurl a ball at a batter's head with the intention of injury to him. He declared
that sucn a practice might result fatally. President Johnson of .the American
League had previously declared that pitcher found guilty of using the ball
deserved a jail sentence. ,
.'Herrmann asserted that no specific cases had enforced the ruling, but that
general reports that certain pitchers were using the delivery resulted in it.j
Expulsion of a player for ube of the illegal ball means that be cannot enter
the employe of a club operating under the national agreement for at least
five years, as a petition for reinstatement will not be considered in less time.
The commission made tentative plans to play Sunday games is six eastern

the receipts to be donated to the army and navy for a war relief fund. The
commission suggested that the money be given to a fund for soldiers' de
peuuents. These games if permission for them is given would be regularly
scheduled contests, one of the week day games being adtanced for the Sun
day date. Chairman Herrmann estimated that $100,000 could be raised by six
Sunday games.

FEDERAL GRAND JURY
TURNS SPOTLIGHT OH
ALLEGED MION TRUST
Eighty-Eight Indictments Re
turned Against Individuals
And Corporations Result of
Probe.
(By Review Leased Wire).
BOSTON. May 21. Eighty-eight cor
porations and individuals were indict
ed by the federal grand jury here to
day for conspiring to monopolize inter
state commerce in onions.
The indictments were returned as u
result of a natAjn-wiue inquiry into the
cost of food oenducted last winter u
United States 'Attorney George W. An
derson, of this city. In' a statement
outlining the case, Mr. Anderson said:
"The gist of the charge is thai the
defendants have maintained a national
onion association, composed of large
Onion dealers who buy up a bulk of the
onions of producing states during the
summer and early fail, storing them in
warehouses owned or controlled by
the various members and putting them
upon the market from September to
April. The government charges that
this association has had a dominating
and illegal control of the onon trade
for the past three years.
"The government expects to show
that as early as September, 1916, at
least 75 per cent of the year's crop,
then harvested, was in the control of
the members of this association The
headquarters of the association are at
Kenton, O.
"It is a part of the plan 'of the asso
ciation to have monthly meetings in v
rious parts of the country so as to get
as large an attendance .as possible
which might not otherwise be reached
only through the mails. After these
monthly meetings the secretary issues
to the members printed "confidential
reports' containing a suramray Vr re
view of the amount of onions available
in various producing sections, followed
by such suggestions' as: 'The bulk oi
the onion crop is now in the hands of
speculators, fully 75 per cent of wtom
are members of this association.'
Corporations Named.
" 'This report shows that the move
ment for the entire United Statea,need
be only 80 pars per day. The results
rest with the members and by all
means arrange to keep onions m'oving
regularly.' We should not fool our
selves and make this a fictitious value
market, but be sure of conditions and
the key to the situation is to keep
some moving all the time.'
"For the 1916 crop the producers
probably received less than 2 cents a
pound. In imidw'nter many, of these
onions were . sold to retailers and
through them to consumers at 10 to 15
cents a ponnd. It is claimed by the
government thta this tremendous mar
gin between the price accruing to the
producer and the price paid by the con
sumer was largely due to the illegal
control of the trade exercised by this
association."
The following corporations are
named in the indictments:
M. Piowaty & Sons, Chicago: The
Horr-Warner Company, Wellington, -O.;
John B. Froy Company, Rochester, N.
Y.; Wayl, Zuckennan & Co., and A.

ELECTRIC CHAIR AT
" SING SINS PRISON
Young Dentist, Who Confess-!
ed Killing Father-In-Law, 1
Walks To Death With!
Smile On His Face.
(By Review Leased Wire).
OSSINING, N. Y., May 24. Dr. Ar
thur Warren Waite was electrocuted
at Sin? Sing prison at 11:10 o'clock
tonight for the murder of his father-in-law.
John E. Peeft, of Grand Rap
Ids. Michigan.
The young dentist walked calmly
nnd with a Arm step from his cell to
the death chamber, accompanied by
the Rev. A. N. Peterson, Protestant
chaplain of the prison. He faltered,
however, as he neared the electric
chair but recovered quickly ond nod
ded to the group of physicians, prison
officials an others who had assem
bled as witnesses.
Waite submitted quietly to the or
depl of being strapped in the chair
and went to his weath without a word
of protest or goodbye. Three shocks
were administered within four min
utes. The two hours before his death
Waite spent in prayer with his spir
itual adviser. Just before 11 o'clock
the clergyman asked the doomed man
if there was anyonei to whom he
wished to serd a message of farewell.
"No. thank, you." Dr. Waite replied
with a smile. "There is really no
one to whom I care to send a fare
well message."
"Not even to your mother?" quier
ied Dr. Peterson.
"No, sir,' was the answer.
The chaplain declared the young
doctor, who confessed to the poison
ing of his father-in-law in the expec
tation that his wife would obtain a
large share in the estate, seemed to
look upon his approaching death as
r wonderful adventure.
Not once during the day did Dr.
Waite lose his composure. He main
lined the same smiling indifference
that has marked his stay of almost
r year in the death house.
Waite said farewell to bis brother,
Prank A. Write,- ft 6 o'clock. The
brother had spent nearly the entire
afternoon talking over family mat
ters. All that Dr. Wiite said at parting
tbs: "Well, good bye Frank."
They clasped hands for a moment,
ears sprang to his brother's eyes
but Waltz's eyes were dry and there
-vas a smile on his lips.
Dr. Amos R. Jameson, squire of
the prison, examined Waite in" the
.ft7moon and was astonished to find
Ms temperature and pulse exactly
normal. The squire said this was the
nost remarkable instance of "nerve"
e had ever seen hi a condemned
man.
Waite was awakened at 6 o'clock
his morning after a night of sound
ileep. During the day he ate three
hearty meals. At supper time the
principal keeper asked him If he de
sired any special dish in view of the
fact that It was to be his last meal.
"No. I think not." Waite erfied
after some deliberation.

THE PERFECTION OF KULTUR.
The distinguished Prof. Oswald Flamm of Berlin has
broken into print again. This time he is criticising the
German admiralty. The American reader will instantly
jump at the conclusion that Prof. Flamm is disgusted and
horrified with the policy of ruthless submarine warfare.
as practiced in these latter dayt.. But that is just where
the average American fails to grasp the workings of the
Prussian professional mind. Flamm is lambasting the
German navy both the supreme command and the in
dividual commanders of U-boats for their absurd tender-heartedness.
While carrying out pretty satisfactorily the new Prus
sian policy of "sinking everything," the herr professor
complains that the U-boats are not sinking everybody,
frequently crews and passengers are allowed to escape
the death they have so richly deserved by the criminal
' act of venturing to sea in disregard of German orders.
The U-boat commanders, to be sure, don't give warning
and stand by to let noncombatants escaje before sinking
their ship. But is amounts to about the same thing when
the men aboard the merchantmen have a few. minutes'
respite after their craft Is torpedoed, before it sinks.
Prof. Flamm insists that nql. one man be allowed to
escape that the crew of every merchantman destroyed,
no matter what the nationality of the ship or the men,
be exterminated, as a lesson to the world.
If this were the only Instance of the kind it might be
accepted as the pitiful vagary of a brilliant mind turned
by brooding on the war. But unfortunately. 'it is only
too representative of the mental operations of a large part
of Germany's leading men of learning. The hideous in
humanity of such suggestions from the -supposed expon
ents of German enlightenment has done more than any
thing else to bring German "kultur" into disrepute and
contempt throughout the world.
Such men us Prof. Flamm, of course, do not represent
the fine old German "culture" to which mankind owes so
much. But it cannot be said, either, that they adequately
represent the new "kultor," which aims at material effi
ciency in the social organization rather than the mental
and spiritual development of the individual
There is no efficiency in the inhuman ruthlessness
' preached by the Flamms and Reventlows and Bernhardis
and Treitschkes. Every exhibition of calculated inhu
manity on the part of the Prussian government has only
steeled the enemy to firmer resistance, aroused greatei
hositility throughout the world, made the war task of
the German nation harder, and added to the difficulties
that will beset the German people in their future rela
tions with the rest of mankind.
HOUSEHOLD SUPERSTITIONS.
The way in which ancient superstitions cling round the
household, in spite of the advancement of modern life, is
strange indeed. One of these which should immediately
be banished to the outer darkness of exploded theories
is that of spring cleaning. When a woman has to turn
her house upside down, turn out every drawer and closet
and make herself and everybody else miserable for two
or three weeks each spring and fall, it is a Bure', infallible
sign that she is a bad housekeeper. She is using super
stition instead of common sense in her household.
There ought to be a definite day in each week for "odd
job." Two hours a week devoted to special cleaning or
overhauling will keep the biggest house in perfect order
and cleanliness. Doing these things all at once is the
most difficult and also expensive way of keeping a house
clean and comfortable.
Ironing is another superstition. The woman who irons,
or allows anyone to iron for ber, more than one hour per
person per week is simply lacking in intelligence. She
hasn't brought her mind to bear upon the work of her
household.
Sweeping with a broom is almost too antiquated and
inexcusable to be mentioned. Still, there are women who
do it. It's high time these women stopped.
The hardest superstition to die. and the one at tin;
foundation of all the others, is that a woman's time and
energy have no money value. The most expensive thing
in life is human labor. The organization and systematiz
ing of housework in order to conserve labor as much
as possible is the first thing for a modern woman to leariV
The extravagance of wasting time and energy by cling
ing to superstition can no longer.be tolerated in an en
lightened community.
THE BRAZILIAN MISSION.
This is a season of diplomatic missions. We have just
been entertaining distinguished missions from France and
England. Another has arrived from Italy. Others are
cn the way, or about to start, from other belligerent
countries. We ourselves are dispatching an important
mission to Russia. Various neutrals are preparing to
Bend representatives here for the settlement of practical
matters connected with the war. And one of the most
important and significant of these out-of-the-ordinary dip
lomatic bodies is the one coming from Brazil.
The Brazilian mission is headed by an eminent states
man named Dr. Ruy Barbosa. Its purpose is said to be
the arrangement of a mutually helpful war program by
Brazil and the United States. Brazil has severed rela-

precaution sent out from Washington

If she could arrange to get trombus the arms and muni
tions necessary to suppress the threatened German in
surrection at home and wage an effective campaign
against Germany, she would probably enter the conflict
along with us.
We should have to supply her with nearly all her fight
ing paraphernalia, and with liberal credit for its purchase.
On the other hand, Brazil is in position to furnish a good
szed army of well trained men, and a large amount of the
food needed by us and our allies.
Our government will doubtless make every effort to
come to terms with the Brazilian envoys. We can afford
to be liberal in view of the desirability of lining up so
powerful a nation to help ns fight German absolutism.
It would be a big step in the direction of arraying the

TROLLEY FARES.
On top of the rise in the price of bread, meat, vege
tables and a hundred other things, the New York traction
companies are trying to raise street care fares. They
insist that they can't afford any longer to carry passen
gers for a nickel, and are asking for permission to boost
the fare to six cents.
At the sanfe time the Cleveland lines, which have only
a small fraction of New York's volume of patronage
and whose rides average longer and might naturally he
supposed to be more expensive, continue to carry pas
sengers for three cents, with little prospect of a rise.
Why this difference? A citizen familiar with the trans
portation problems of both cities explains it All the
water was squeezed out of the- Cleveland trolley system
a few years ago, and it has been running since on a
basis of fair profits on its actnal value. Moreover, the
people of Cleveland are so well informed regarding their
transportation problems, as a result of years of public
discussion, that they know how the system ought to be
run and how much it ought to cost, and insist on good
.management and minimum rate. Inasmuch as the people
have taken control of the trolley lines into their own
hands, it. is easy for them to make their will effective.
The transportation system of the metropolis is full of
water, which demands dividends. The people of New
York know little about it, and apparently care little.
They have no effective controL
That makes the difference.
WAR ZONE FOR WOMEN.
American women have fortunately not been misled by
the efforts of a few mistaken leaders who were trying to
arm our women for self-defense. There is no need of
military activity. The men can do the fighting. It may
be that even such semi-military work as making hospital
supplies has been over-emphasized. They are necessary,
bnt it is possible to supply them without drafting for the
purpose women w ho have other duties to attend to.
The president of one of the big state federations of
women's clubs, declaring that every American woman
must be a good soldier, explains that every woman
"should enlist in war against waste food, in production
of food, and in conservation of the health of her family."
And she is absolutely right These natural and congenial
forms of feminine effort' are more important just now
excuse will be available as to why any
person is not registered.
Must Be on Roll.
After the day of registration has
been announced it remains with ah
men between the ages of 21 and 30
years to see that they are on the rolls.
All excuses must be made that day, anu
they will know at 'once whether or not
they are exempt.
"Every precaution will be taken to
make it certain that the registration
will be conducted with exact justice,"
is the -statement , sent out from the
Washington headquarters. It adds further:
"Tae law is specific and allows no
latitude too the boards, either in the
matter of registration or in the later
matter of exemption from service. In
fact, the law is self-executing. Every
man within the age limits fixed by
the selective service act must regis
ter and the penalty of the law tor eva
sion of registration, will fall, not
only on the man who fails to appear,
but on any member of . i registration
board who may be shown t'J be in col
lusion with the person who attempts
to escape his duty.
The law provides the penalty of
imprisonment with no alternative of e
fine for any official or any registered
man who shall make a false return or
attempt such practice. The safeguards
against favoritism or evasion are ample."
May Register Before.
In order to facilitate the registra
tion, those persons who are ill and
those who expect to be absent from
their home county on registration day
may register before the general regis

The Junction Briggs team and the

day in thei third schedule game of
the local season. The game promises
to be one of the hardest fought
games of the season, as these two
teams are now so close together in
standing that it Is creating considera
ble interest among the fans. The Im
portance of this game Is enhanced by
the fact that in the preceding game,
the C. 4 A. tied with the Copper
Queen for first place, with the Junc
tion Briggs only one game behind.
If the Junction team should emerge
the victor, it will be tied with the
Queen nine,; and should the Indians
grab the session, they will continue
as the league leaders, which position
they have held for the past three
weeks.
Both managers and captains will
put forward their best players in the
effort to land the bacon. The teams
are holding daily practices and are

even possession of liquor at any kind
of military camps or clubs. A bill ap
plying similar restrictions to the navy

The prohibition section of the war
army bill provides:
"That n opersons, corporation, part

"It shall be .unlawful to sell any
Intoxicating liquor. Including beer or
wine, to any officer or member of the

always works. You just put on about
2 drops. Then the corn not only
shrivels, but loosens from the toe,
without affminx . the surrounding
flesh in the least. Why, it's almost
a pleasure to have corns and see how
'Gets-It' gets them off in a hurry and
without the least pain. I can wear
tight Eho, dance and walk as though
I never had corns."
"Gets-It" makes the use of toe-Irritating
salves, bundling bandages,
tape, plasters and other things not
only foolish but unnecessary. Use
thi3 wonderful discovery, "Grts-It,"
for any soft or hard corn or callus.
It is the new.simple, easy, quick
way, and it never fails. You'U never
have to cut a corn again with knives
or scissors, and run chances of blood
poison. Try "Gets-It" tonight

Sun and Wind Bring Out Ugly Spots.
Howv to Remove Them.
Here's a chance. Miss Freckle-face,
to try a remedy for freckles with the
guarantee of a reliable dealer that it
will not cost you a penny unless it
removes the freckles; while if it does
give you a clear complexion the ex
pense is trifling.
Simply get an ounce of othine
double strength from any druggist
and a few applications should show
you how easy it is to rid yourself of
the homely freckles and get a beauti
ful complexion. Rarely is more than
one ounce needed for the worst case.
Be sure to ask the druggist ftr the
double strength othine as this is the
prescription sold under guarantee tof
money back II it fails to remove the
freckles.
The first government move to re-
jvamp coastwise trade Is seen in re
fusal of the government bureau to
write war risk insurance on Failing
craft This will keep them in the
coastwise trade, releasing steamers for
overseas work.

asked.
"We have never undertaken tt con
trol the Louisville & Nashville," he
replied.
Mr. Walters said he considered that
Atlantic Coast Line was better situat
ed than some of its neighbors.
Favors Pooling Car.
Howard Elliott, of tbe New Haven,
and member of the railroad war board.
told Clifford W. Thorne, representing
shippers, who ci'oss-examined him,
that he favored some scheme of pool
ing cars and terminals should it be
necessary in the interests of national
defense. He also believed it destrabi
that a government agency be created
to tell the railroads just what was de
sired of them.
He was questioned regarding a set
of economy suggestions issued by the
war board. These proposed such econ
omies as speeding up repairs on loco
motives nad cars, increasing the run
ning time of locomotives, reducing boil
er repairs and more careful steaming.
Mr. Elliott said he thought most of
the changes suggested were practica
ble: that they were Intended to result
in Increased efficiency of the rail
roads, and that up to a certain point
they did nbt contemplate any additions
to capital. He said the war board felt
that if everything suggested could be
done the capacity of tbe railroads
would be greatly increased, but he did
not believe all the things could be ac
complished because of the human ele
ment entering into the operation of
railroads.
Admits Big Profit.
Regarding traffic on the New Haven,
Mr. Elliott said, in response B Mr.
Thome's inquiries, that had more
terminal facilities been available last
year the road would have reaped a
larger gross and' net income. He said
the Hell Gate bridge route would assist
the railroads in handling freight at the
New York terminal and consequently
would result in lesselnng congestion.
which even now was Improving each
day: .
Julius Kruttschnitt, chairman of tho
Southern Pacific, was questioned first
regarding the timber lands owned by
the system. Mr. Thorne introduced
figures be Bald were compiled by the
government showing that the Southern
Pacific owns one-twentieth of all the
privately owned timber lands in the
country. Mr. Kruttschnitt said It was
true that the Southern Pacific's re
turn on its capital tsock last year was
slightly over 12 per cent and the
greatest return In history.
Cross-examination 'of railroad exec
utives will be concluded tomorrow.

Heavy demand has practically dou

people who know nothing about rais

dier, in a fit of homesickness and
lonesomeness, has yielded to surround
ing temptations and then,-when he
came to himself, has been ready to put
a bullet into his own head for re
morse. What can be done for the boys this community,
in mese nours ot nomesicRnessr mere
is only one thing to do provide them
with wholesome entertainment, recrea
tion, a place to gather and tb write let
ters home. There is no organization
so well equipped to do this as the
Young Men's Christian Association.
When the boys put on the un If oral
of a soldier end go off to the fi'ont o
to camp, the restraints of home vanish.
Life takes on an entirely new aspect
Men's natures change. They seem to
get a new viewpoint of life. Often this
view Is distorted and those things
which were abhorred at home seem
less repulsive, and as time goes on,
morals break down.
Here is where the Y. M. C. A. comes
In and puts In its big, hard, effective
Wjrk that has earned the commenda
tion of no less a personage than the
President of the United States. Quot
ing from his recent executive order
"Officers are enjoined to render the
fullest practicable assistance and co
operation in the maintenance and ex
tension of the association, both In per
manent posts and stations and In camp
and field."
Some of the things required to serve
1,000,000 men:
200 Y. M. C. A. buildings.
1,100 Trained secretaries.
200 Pianos.
200 Movie machines.
200 Graphaphones.
268.000 Feet of film, daily.
3,000,000 Sheets of stationery, daily.
40,000 Pounds of ice, daily.
10,000 Pens and five barrels of ink.
Ten thousand dollars will build,
equip and man a standard camp build
ing until January 1. 1918.
Four thousand five hundred dollar
will man such a standard equipment.
Three thousand five hundred dollars
will supply ntotor truck traveling Asso
ciation outfit with motion picture
equipment, graphaphone, records, etc.
These trucks will serve the isolated
outposts, where small groups are un
guarded.
Three thousand dollars will erect
one of these standard camp bulldingv
One thousand five hundred dollars
will equip one of these buildings for
service to a brigade or alvut 6,000
men.
One thousand men will furnish de
livery truck for the handling of sup
plies of the different buildings. A
dozen such trucks are needed.
Five hundred dollars will buy 5.000
copies of the New Testament At the
border every copy was quickly
snatched up.
Two hundred and fifty dollars will
furnish a motion picture and recreation
for 4.000 to 6.000 men a night Good.
wholesome pictures take up time which
otherwise might be spent In gambling
and other vices.
One hundred and fifty dollars will
buy a piano for a camp building.
One. hundred dollars will provide
stationery and writing materials for
one month for one of these brigade
buildings.
Sixty dollars will supply a building
with ice to cool enough drinking water
for 5,000 men for a niVinth.
Fifty doll;? will buy a graphaphone
and a few records for the soldiers' use.
At the board of directors meeting at
the local association last evening the
board decided to make a campaign in
District to secure funds.
Today they will visit the business in
terests of the district for this pur
pose. It is h'oped that sufficient in
formation has been given and interest
created to merit the liberal support of
LODGE BUYS BONDS.
At the meeting last night of the
local Knights of Pythias, tho lodge
decided to invest $200 in Liberty
Loan Bonds. Although this amount
is not very large, the lodge intends
to keep on increasing its purchases
of bonds as funds for this purpose
are received. , ther lodges in tha
city are expected to follow this lead.
FOX STAR HEARD FROM.
James W. Kirkbride, a well-known
local resident has received a letter
from the publicity agent of Miss
Gladys Brockwell, one of the William
Fox screen stars, asking that the pic
ture organization be granted permis
sion to use a picture and a poem
which Mr. Kirkbride sent to Miss
Brockwell, some time ago. The local
man has granted that permission and,
no doubt, his work will goon appear in
the press sheets of the William Fox
Company.
