lon and Sierra Mojeda have revolted.
Deniet Connection
Villa's chief of staff tonight denied
reports shown him of supposed con
nection with the Clerical party or the
Felix Diaz party with the Villa roove
mtnt. He said .there was no connec
tion with either of these movements,
nor with German influences in Mexi
co, Emiliano Zapata being the only
revolutionist who was connected with
the Villa party.

Kearns said he deserted to Mexico
near here from an American cavalry
command and was impressed into the
federal force defending Ojinaga, where
he served fifeen days. He said he was
placed in charge of the machine guns
defending the main road entering
Ojinaga until federal soldiers left them
alone. He said they had plenty of
ammunition.
Cavalry Moving
A column of Villa cavalry was seen
moving up the Rio Grande to a point
about twenty miles above Ojinaga
today. It was followed on the Ameri
can side by American cavalry patrols,
watching its movements. The column
was believed to be pursuing the fed
eral column under Colonel Flores.
which is understood to be retreating
toward Juarez.
Colonel Trillo, Villa's secretary, de-J
nied today that Jose Ynez Salazar.
well known as a leader of forces op
posing the present Mexican govern
ment, was killed at N'ogal ranch, Chi-
huahua. as reported several months

late this afternoon of the departure
from Ojinaga. of Francisco Villa with
upward of 1.000 men. Porfirio Ornelas
with tour hundred to five hundred men
is left in command of the captured bor
der port. According to the advices re
ceived by the consul general, the Villa
followers rode away in the general di
rection of La Mula pass, which is on
the road to Chihuahua City. Reports
from the latter place indicate that the
populace is in a panic, fearing attack
by the bandits. General Francisco
Murguia, commander of the govern
ment forces in northern Mexico, left
Chihuahua a week ago with the major
portion of the garrison and is reported
to be in the vicinity of Saltillo, Coa
huila. Villa folio were, operating soutf
of Chihuahua, have cut the railroad
and are repotred entrenched along the
line and prepared to resist any at

General Eduardo Hernandez, temporar
ily in command of Chihuahua, has less
than 1.500 men, while General Carlos
Murguia, at Juarez, has less than 500.
Duck Hunter Attacked.-
The appearance of Villa bandits
within thirty miles of Juarez seems to
be proven by attack upon a party of
American duck hunters today near
Fabins, thirty-two miles east of here.
These men were bunting close to the
international line when some 200 shots
were fired on them by roughly dressed
Mexicans wearing red arm bands. Jeff
L. Glaves, an El Paso fire department
captain, was shot through the thighs
by a bullet from a high power rifle.
Wounded and dazed, he staggered
across the line where he was struck
with a rifle butt and robbed of his
shotgun, rifle and a small amount of
caifi. He was later brought to El
Paso and placed in a hospital It is
said he will recover. The scene of the
shooting is a woody river bottom
where the boundary is marked ouly by
a few weed-covered monuments. The
hunters insist that both they and their
assailants were on American soil when
the fusillade began.
Troops To Presidio.
At military headquarters it was an
nounced late this afternoon that a
motorcycle machine gun company and
a company of infantry had been dis
patched to Presidio to assit in guarding
the interned Mexican federal soldiers.
This makes four companies sent from
here for that purpose. Army officers
said that no decision had been reached
as to the disposition of the Interned
men.
The problem of feeding the Mexi
cans ins a serious one, since Presidio
is sixty miles from the railroad, the
country is rugged and the roads poor.
Mexican Consul General Seguin an
nounced late today that he had sent a
large sum to General Juan Espinosa y
Cordova, late commander of the Ojin
aga garrison, the money to be used to
purchase supplies for the interned sol
diers as well as the Mexican civilians
who are refugees in Presidio.
Colonel II. G. Sickle, in command
here, tonight declined to discuss the
report that a cavalry captain had been
confineu to quarters at Fort Bliss. The
captain this morning crossed the Rio
Grande at Ysleta, thirteen miles east
of here, and brought back two of his
men captured by Mexicans.

ITALIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
NORTHERN ITALY, Nov. 16. (By
tlie Associated Press) The booming
of Italian naval guns could be heard
distinctly here this morning, showing
that the navy as well as the army
was doing its part. The fire of the
naval guns was directed against the
enemy positions on the lower Piave.
Reports received during the early
hours continued to be favorable.
The inundated section between the
Piave and the Sile rivers effectively
holds the enemy at most
enemy at most exposed
miles and the water is from a foot to
five feet deep, depending on the topo-
(troops. While this section is blocked
j by water the enemy still clings to the
I west bank at Zenson, but they are
j crowded into a small U-shaped posi
tion and are relying on their batteries
across the river to keep the Italians
back.
Pontoon Unsuccessful
Austro-German efforts to bring ov?r
large forces by pontoons have not
succeeded, according to latest reports
either at Zenson or at points further
north, where the invaders are reeling
their way toward getting across.
Enemy attacks in the Asiago sec
tion or the eastern Trentino frontier
are very heavy with the evident pur
pose or trying to separate the Italians
on the Trentino rrom thoe on the
Piave rront.
Enemy air raiders were seen flyins
over the Italian headquarters early
today.
The batteries rired on them.

from the delegates attending today's
session of the thir:y-seventh annual

u k iauui.
l The farmers were represented by
A. C. Townley, president of the aFrm

the last annual convention of the Ca

Another Busy Day.
The committee spent another busy
day. Twt resolutions having to do
with the federation's close relations
with the federal government on war
work are understood to be giving the
fedeartion leaders some concern.
Either one of them it is said, is likely
to participate sharp debate on the floor
of the convention.
One of the resolutions was introduc
ed by delegates representing the
bridge and structural iron workers.
The preamble declares that American
labor is loyal and determined to use
its best efforts to establish and main
tain the co-operation of all organized
workers to assist the government to
carry on the war. It then states that
a great amount of the materials neces

Bolesheviki. who are battering the
ancient walls and buildings with
heavy artillery, according to a well
authenticated report received this af
ternoon.
The government troops are said to
have a fairly plentiful supply of food
and ammunition and to be capable of
holding out for some days.
Exaggerated Report
According to the Informant or the
Associated Press, a semi-official
American returning from Moscow,
the stories of wholesale looting and
burning there have been exaggerated.
There has been indiscriminate firing
throughout the city, but aside from
the havoc at the Kremlin there has
been little damage done to property.
The loss of life since the beginning
of the insurrection is estimated at
from 2,000 to 5,000.
General Kaledines, upon whose help
the defenders or the Kremlin are
counting, is reported to liave cut the
railway southward to prevent provis
ions arriving while he is moving to
ward Moscow.

a stand at the government palace,
whero later their leaders were ar
rested. Moscow advices are to the effect
that the government troops control
the central portion of the city and
the Bolesheviki the outlying districts,
where there is much disorder. The
victims in the street battle are esti
mated at from 700 to 2.000.
In Kiev, while a patrol or Cossacks

ernment, met with defeat the hands
of Bolshevik! soldiers of Petrograd
while endeavoring to march, upon
Tsarskoe-Selo and were compelled to
retreat back to Gatchina, whence they
started for the attack.
News of Kiev

concerning Kiev, where it was said
the cossacks and military cadets had
gained control of th city after consid

dropping bombs on the enemy lines.
To the south, near the mouth of the

"Holland of Italy." Italian enginere
have opened the dikes against th4
enemy forces which crossed the stream
at Grisolera. who possibly have been
trapped by the inrush of ;he water.
The inundation will make harder the

WRITES ABOUT MEN
FROM THIS COUNTY
AT CAMP KEARNEY
P .B. Camp, who was formerly con
nected with the Douglas International,
recently visited Camp Kearney and
wrote the following story that was
printed in that paper on Thursday.
It is Interesting reading on account
of the number of Cochise county boys
tbat are now at that camp:
CAMP KEARNEY, LINDA VISTA,
Cal.. Nov. 10 (By Mail). Yon moth
ers and sisters, wives and sweet
hearts, fathers and brothers of the
men from Arizona, whom you sent
away with a smile some weeks ago.
may be glad to learn from one who
has seen that your sons and brothers,
your husbands and lovers are each
and every one alive and well and
rapidly learning to be soldiers. Here
at Camp Kearney I found both the
men of the old national guard and
several thousand men who were
drafted for the national army, the lat
ter arriving some few weeks ago from
Camp Funston, from which place they
had been sent to fill out the old 1st
Arizona infantry to Ml war strength.
In place of the 1st Arizona, I found
the 158th V. S. infantry-. This regi
ment is composed entirely of Arizona
men. CoL A. M. Tuthill is now a
brigadier general commanding the en
tire Infantry brigade.
I saw Captain Horene, also Cap
tain Taylor, who is still holding down
his old job. Our own exclusive
Apache Indians were still holding
down their job. Ike Klein was dis
covered Where? In the company
tore. of course. Where else would
'Id friend Ike fit better than in the
regimental exchange? Chet Johnson,
"te only," same fellow who used to
Tstle copy for the International and
lpter the Bisbee Review, was discov
ered by yours truly in the mess hall,
fef was getting on the outside of a
Wg helping of army chow. I hailed
through the screen. He liked to
'oko when he recognized my long,
lean form. While I was punishing his
hand and the couple of hundred sol
diers who were eating were compar
ing the difference in our heights
(if I were In the same company with
Chet they wouldnt have to look any
further for the original Mutt and Jeff)
who should rush up tickled as could
be, but Bill Wright same fellow who
used to Teed the job presses for the
International. (Say, major, have you
got a 'service flag out on the roof? If
not you ought to have; the paper Is
well represented.) Bill Is leaner, so
is Chet. and Ike has lost fifteen
pounds though he whispered to me
confidential like that he'd only drilled
two hours since he arrived.
Many were the others who shook
my hand and asked about the old
town. I had 'em all together, gave
'em an hour's talk and reading. They
sure gave me a handsome reception,
and to make it more enthusiastic and
homey-like the two battalions of the
Colorado Infantry were there. Same
two that were camped out by the C.

guards went home. Major Hamrock.
who then commanded. Is now a colo
nel; his regiment is the 157th in

them; so is Captain Ifcad and Lieu
tenant Donovan. Sure was great to
see and meet 'em all again.
The camp is located 17 miles from
San Diego; auto and train fare, 8ti
cents round trip. Including war tax.
Men are allowed In town Wednesday,
Saturday and Sunday. Good climate.
good water, and only six miles to thej
nearest ocean point. Aeroplanes fly
ing all day long. Soldiers, sailors,
marines, everywhere on the streets.
Cafes all swamped. Everybody happy,
and the men and officers Imbued
with a spirit of determination to get
Into the war and do their best.
Arizona can well be proud of her
men. They are second to none a fine
healthy bunch, all imbued with the
sipirt of patriotism that will carry
them "over the top." Take off your
hats, you people at home, to the men
who represent your state. Give them
three cheers and support them in
every way possible while they are
away. Write to them; they like to
hear from you often. Send them a
Christmas box. One from the city
to the Douglas men would be a fine
thing. Five cents apiece would fill a
dandy.
San Dipgo may go drv on election
day, November 22. Men in uniform
are not allowed in the saloons.

form who are going to help win this

AN ARIZONA SOLDIER
There is something about the great state of Arizona,
regardless of the county and altitude, that makes for
manliness. The very atmosphere of the forty-eighth star
seems to instill in its citizens, whether new or old, the
"pep" and stamina, the perseverance and determination,
and the willingness to accept things as they are, which
go to make of a composite people a great credit to "any
commonwealth. This feature has been, particularly,
shown since the war with Germany has been a fact.
Arizona's soldiers are meeting with compliments. Though
the state, undoubtedly, has some "wasters," the majority
of its men, sent to training camps of various kinds, have
reflected great credit on the home or their birth or
adoption.
Witness the viewpoint of a former Bisbee man:
"On the whole, you never saw a more contented and
conscientious bunch of men in all your life. Of course,
once in a while, you hear fellows kicking, but you know
how much you hear of that in civil life even the most
congenial of us find fault once in a while. But what I
mean, is that the men here are taking to their work
with a snap and determination to make the best soldiers
of this division. We lead the entire camp in Liberty
Bonds, by a good margin; and from all reports we are
meeting the very success which our officers wish to at
tain in the other departments of the work So you see
we are justly proud of our regiment, and feel that, when
the time comes "somewhere" in France (or more likely
in Germany, if you please), we will give a good account
of ourselves."
The foregoing was written by "Doc" (J. O.) Goodman,
of Bibbee. Doc Goodman was employed at the Lowell
shaft of the Copper Queen. He was drafted and went to
Camp Funston. That his attitude is universal must be
judged from his words. The letter, it might be said, was
addressed to an individual in Bisbee and not intended for
publication.
Though The Review has no definite knowledge on
the subject, it would offer the opinion that Doc Goodman
was a good miner and a good citizen. He looks at thing"
as they are and not from the standpoint of a dreamer,
soiely. Yet Goodman, and his kind, dream. They dream
of practical!' ies and of methods, practical methods, of
putting their theories into effect. Realities come from
such dreamers as Goodman, for he realizes that to "make
a go" of anything worth while, work, work, work is re
quired; that training is essential; that sacrifice of per
sonal ambitions and personal inclinations must be made.
Goodman's reference to the people in civil life who
complain is pertinent, especially at the present time. He
says that some fellows are inclined to "kick." Judging
from the tenor of his letter, however, the men who are
at Camp Funston, earning thirty dollars a month an-1
due for the trenches of France, are not doing much
"kicking." Would that his attitude could be grasped
and understood by a great many nien, throughout the
country, who are listening to German treason and ma
licious malcontents.
Arizona, and America, is full of Goodmans. The stat'j
and nation also have many of the other kind who would
rather wail and complain of their lot, than wcr't
and dream of the future, builded on the present.
Which would you ra'her be? Which class deserves
the honor and thanks of the country?
NORTHCLIFFE AND AMERICA
Lord Northcliffe, the great English publisher, has re
jected an offer to enter the British cabinet. He tells
Lloyd-George, the premier, that he can do better work
for the British empire unhampered "by a loyalty that 1
do not feel toward the whole of your administration."
Northcliffe then points out several tt-atures of the situa
tion which throw great light on the entire war and. par
ticularly, upon America's part in it.
People, in the United States, are inclined lu criticize.
It is. perhaps, the best fault that the American mind hat
assimilated through birth and environment. Public offi
cials, from top to bottom, are hauied over the coals in
every gathering place of the country. There Is little
hide-bound reticence in the nation and the result has
been that America has gone further, in a few short
months, than Europe has in several years.
Says Northcliffe, in his letter to Lloyd-George:
"Returning after five months spent In the virile at
mosphere of the United States and Canada, I find that
while these two countries are proceeding with their war
preparations with a fervor and enthusiasm little under
stood on this side of the Atlantic; while the United
States Instantly put into operation conscription over
wich we wobbled for two years, and Is making short
work of sedition mongers; while Canada already has
given such proofs of thoroughness as the disfranchise
ment of conscientious objectors and the denaturalization
of all enemy aliens naturalized within the last fifteen
years; while we, for our part, are asking immense sacri
fices from these peoples there still are in office here
those who dally with -such urgent questions as that of
unity of war control, eradication of sedition, mobilization
of the whole, man and woman power of the country and
the introduction of compulsory food rations.
"I had personal experience while in America of the
obstruction and delay in certain departments in London,
which, for example, postponed sending Lord Reading's
vital and most successful mission. I still find the cen
sorship being misosed, and that men in various positions
of authority who should have been punished have been
retained and in some cases elevated.
"I trust I make no breach of confidence In saying
that some of the documents which have passed through
ray hands as head of the mission are such as if pub
lished, would greatly increase our prestige in the United
States and hearten our people at home.
."May I also take this opportunity of giving warning
about onr relations with that great people from whom I
come. We have had the tragedy of Russia, due, partly
to lack of allied propaganda to counteract that of the
Germans. We have bad the tragedy of Italy, largely due
to that same enemy propaganda. We have had the
tragedies of Serbia, Rumania and Montenegro. There Is
one tragedy which I am sure we shall not have, and that
is the tragedy of the United States.
"But from countless conversations with leading Ameri
cans, I know that unless there is swift improvement in
our methods, the United States will rightly take Into its
own hands the entire management of a great part of
the war. It will net sacrifice its blood and treasure to
the incompetent handling of the affairs of Europe.
"In saying all this, which is very much on my mind,
believe me I have none but the most friendly feeling to
ward yourself and that I am greatly honored by your
suggestion."
Northcliffe may be many things but he is fearless.
He criticized the British government until it awakened
to its responsibilities. He forced conscription. He made
the English people rise to the occasion until its organ
ization is envied the world over. That he still criticizes
his own people and. particularly, his own government Is
heartening in spite of its pessimistic angles., Northcliffe
would just as soon criticize America, if America de
served it.
His warning to England. andthe shoe can, no doubt,
be worn by the other European a'.lies, is very pertinent
at this time. America started from the bottom in it3
preparations. That the nation was not prepared, at the
outbreak of the war, is regrettable but not chargeaMe to
any particular man or men; it was the fault of a com
placent nation. The nation and Its forces, now bein
mobilized In its most efficient fashion, will not tolerate
European bungling. There must be efficiency on the
fighting front and Northcliffe has sounded the keynote
of tli is country's determination in the great fight for
democracy.
Northcliffe may be the English Hearst; but we cannot
conceive of Northcliffe endeavoring, by a negative ap
proval of any action to hurt his own country. Hearst is
accused, by many able Americans of doing that very
thing. In any event the English lord's warning to Eng
land is timely and it is also heartening to this nation. It
comes from the heart and, as the result of the keen
observation of a man whe knows. It is ample proof that
we are doing things, in spite of much criticism and sedi
tion within the boundaries of the country.
WHAT ONE WOMAN SAVED IN A WEEK
There ran be no doubt that the campaigns waged to
save food are having their effect. One woman writes
to the Woman's Home Companion and says In the De
cember issue:
"I resolved to start a campaign in the kitchen to
prove just how much truth there was iu their promises
of economizing in cooking materials. I was rather doubt
ful about making due pound of butter do the work of
two. but it can actually be done, for we've tried it.
"Then we tried doing without eggs where we'd for
merly used them. By following good recipes we fouuJ
we had saved four eggs in that morning's baking. Kcrh
are now fifty-five tents a dozen here; so this is another
help.
"Instead of using mi'k at fifteen cents a quart, 1
substituted a little can of some I saw advertised. It'j
been absolutely as good for our cooking and baking, and
aside from being cheaper It's much more convenient to
have several cans In the refrigerator ready to us in
stfad of waiting for tile milkman."
