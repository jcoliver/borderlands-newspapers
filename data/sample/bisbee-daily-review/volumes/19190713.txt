Irish President De
livers a Masterful
Talk to Interesting
Audience.
CHICAGO. July 12. A fifteen min
ute demonstration greeted Eamonn de
Valera, "president of the Irish repub
lic," when he rose to speak at a lun
cheon In his honor today. He was
borne on the shoulders of guests and
carried around the room as he waved
an Irish flag in one hand and an
American flag in the other.
100 On Committee of Welcome
Mr. de Valera came to Chicagq this
morning and was received by a com
mittee of 100 and a large crowd.
Among the events on his program to
morrow is a mass meeting at the Na
tional League baseball park.
Makes Lincoln Simile
In his luncheon address, Mr. de Va
lera told his auditors they were "like
those whom your great Lincoln iron-i
ically derided as upholders of the
great principle tnat 'ii one man
makes a slave of another it is nobody
else's business.' "
Self Determination the Issue
The principle of "self-determination
of peoples to select their own govern
ment" he said, was the basis of no
fewer than ten of the fourteen points
which "your president put forward as
America's aims in the war and the
grounds on which America would
make peace." So, he said the Irish
people had "seized the opportunity of
the recent elections to ' prove In a
peaceful manner that they desired an
independent republic."
Secession a Misnomer
"The word, 'secession' as applied to
our-movement tor independence is a
misapplication of the term, for there
has been no previous voluntary anion
or partnership," he said. "Our only
demand of England is that her forces
of occupation be removed in order
that the government set up by the Ir
ish people, the de jure government,
of which I have the honor to be the
chief executive, .may function as the
people desire it to function.
Hopes, for U. S. Recognition
"The recognition of this govern
ment and of the republic by the Amer
ican nation as the true government oi
Ireland will materially assist us in our
efforts to carry out the will of the
people. I feel certain that the Ameri
can government will respond to the
wishes of the American people, and
I believe that this demonstration to
day Js a clear indication of the wishes
of the people of this great city."
Deplores Anti-Wilson Episode
Referring to the hissing of the
name of President Wilson at de Va
lera's New York meeting, the speaker
said:'
"What I think Is this: I would be
deeply humiliated if my presence
here in your country and my advocacy
of the just and reasonable claims of
the Irish people should be made the
occasion of any demonstrations of
hostility to your president. He is
your president and whilst as Ameri
cans you have a right no doubt to
criticize, you will forgive me for say
ing I feel if is not good taste before
a stranger. I am here to get the aid
of all lovers of liberty in America,
and they embrace all sections. Those
who would identify us with any sec
tions and those who act unworthily
of' what is a holy cause, are, even
though . it be .unconsciously, the
worst enemies, of Ireland.'
Raps extractions of Press
"Finally, I cannot see any. good pur
pose that is served by -the. press exag
geration of the New York incident.
As I pointed out -this morning, one
or two in a meeting can make a great
noise and it would be a very obvious
device for those who are opposed to
our cause to -send agents for that
purpqse."
SEAMAN STRIKE

tives of the United States shipping

Mr. Gilbert is going to do about it
At this point George Hoke, who has
been chief council for the defendants,
announced that Gilbert had waived
his right to be represented by council.
"I ask your honor that I may be
permitted to make my own plea to the
jury. The attitude of more than 250,
000 farmers and a million of people
throughout this Northwest will de
pend upon the decision of the jury."
Judge Dean questioned whether
the law would permit one of the de
fendants to try his own case in an
action of this kind, without legally
representing the other defendant.
Assistant Attorney General J. E.
Markham objected, holding that they
could not properly grant the defend
ants request, fudge Dean then asked
the attorney, to submit authorities
on the issue and Townley took his
Chair while the lawyers argued.

WASHINGTON, July 12. The day
light saving was rescued from repea:
today by President Wilson's veto or
the agricultural bill. The President
also vetoed the sundry civil appropria
tion, because, he said, by restriction
of funds it crippled the work of re
habilitating and restoration disabled
soldiers and sailors to civil life.
The latter veto was accepted with
out contest by congress and the sun
dry civil service bill went back to the
committee to be reframed.
Veto of daylight saving repeal was
not accepted so readily, although the
prevailing opinion was that a neces
sary two-thirds vote to repass it over
the president's veto probably would
not be mustered.
The first test will come in the
house Monday, when, according to an
nouncement. Republican Leader Mon
dell or Chairman Haughen of the ag
ricultural committee will move the re
passage of the bill, with the daylight
savings repeal intact, over the presi
dential veto.
Both bills provide funds for which
agencies of the government long have
been waiting .- They already are
months behind schedule because they
failed of passage in the last congress.

IRISH LEADER
Declares a Campaign, Fostered
By Catholics and Germans,
To Create Anti-British Feel
ing, is Now in Progress.
BELFAST, Ireland. July 12 (By the
Associated Press). The twelfth of
July celebrations were carried out to
day in Ulster on a large scale. Sir
Edward Carson, the Irish Unionist
leader, speaking att he Orange demon
stration at Holy wood. Belfast, said:
"There is a campaign going on in
America fostered by the Catholic
church which soon will be joined by
the Germans and their funds, in order
to create a great anti-British feeling.
"Heaven knows I want good feeling
between America and this country. I
believe the whole future of the world
probably depends upon the, relations
between the United States and our
selves, but I am not going to submit
to this kind of campaign, whether for
friendship or for any other purpose.
"I seriously say to America today
you attend to your own affairs; we
will attend to ours. You look after
your own questions at home; we will
look after ours. We will brook no in
terference into our own affairs by
any country, however powerful. It Is
not for that we waged the great war
of Independence which has just been,
concluded. What right had an Ameri
can mission to come to this country
come here in a breach of hosipality
of one nation towards another to at
tempt to stir up strife in matters in
wh'ch they were not connected?
"The encouragement those men
gave the Sinn Fein party has created
for the British government far more
difficulties than ever before. I be
lieve that the visit of these men and
the encouragement they gave to law
lessness, which is being preached
throughout the land, has aided greatly
to the campaign of assassination ot
innocent persons who were only doing
their duty .to their country and who
were foulyi murdered on the roadside,
with men ' looking on, who had not
the courage to arrest the assassins
or give such information as would
bring them to justice."
Sir Edward Carson denounced Sir
Horace Plunkett, who, he said, was
elected chairman of the Irish conven
tion because he was "thoroughly hat
ed and distrusted by both sides," ana
added the speaker, "a nice mess he
made of it."

New County Jail to be
Erected at Douglas
According to announcement made yes
terday by the board of county supervis
ors, composed of I. C. E. Adams, C. M.
Roberts and J. M. Sparks, who were In
Douglas on official business, in the near
future the board will call for bids for a
site and for the construction of a new
and modern branch county building in
this city. The- building will consist of a
jaih and court room- for the justice of
the peace, and offices for deputy sheriffs
stationed here.
The most pressing need of the county
as far as its business in Douglas is con
cerned, is a new branch county jail. The
old one has long been worthless and for
the past two or three years has not even
been in use. It is a ramshackle adobe
huildinr. and the only way a prisoner
could e kept in It would be to have
armed guards on the outside day and
night. For some time the county ha
been paying the city $50 a month for
housing its prisoners which is consid
ered a needless expense besides which
the city needs a'.i its cell room for its
own prisoners.
Before long architects will prepare
plans for the proposed building arid sub
mit to the supervisors, and after a plan
is accepted bids will be called for both
for a site and for construction f the
building. The supervisors said they
could not give an estimate as to the
prolwhle cost of the new structure until
plans have been decided" upon. It Is prob
able the building will be two stories
high, with offices and court room be
low and the jail above. .
It is said that Douglas and vicinity
Turnished more than 50 per cent of the
county prisoners, and the necessity for a
branch county jail here is very evident.

A Summary of the Situation as
Viewed by Unbiased Auth
orities Who Forecast a Prob
able Shortage and a Higher
Price.
The nation faces an inevitable scar
city of coal and higher prices this
will develop into the seriousness of
an old-fashioned famine.
No-less an authority than Dr. Har-
rv . A. Garfield. U. ' S. Fuel
Administrator stands sponsor
for this statement. Other government
bureau chiefs agree with him.
There is a little ray of hope in
Dr. Garfields startling announcement
however. The distressing situation
which a scarcity of coal invariably
brines, can be minimized. Therefore,
the calamity of an actual famine .may
Xe averted.
The possible remedy, says Doctor
Garfield, lies In an early buying move
ment. This is the nation's only
chance.
But, our councclor warns siarntfi
cantly, this remedy must be applied
at once. There cannot bo further
postponement.
Each day early buying is delayed
adds to the-difficulties of fall deliver
ies. This serious shortage of coal is for
casted not only by Doctor Garfield and
the Fuel Administration, but by three
other government beureaus.
The Geological Survey-Uncle Sam's
statistician predicts a serious short
age because, it says, the nation al
ready is short 48,000,000 tons in com?
parison with the preceding calendar

of the Information and Education Ser
vice, says coal Is going to be scarce
i because labor will be scarce
through DirectorGeneral Hines, sees
a.. impending danger because cars
The Administration of Railroads
in which to haul coal will not ,be
available.
Dr. Garfield's Sum, Up
octor Garfield sums up his reasons
for a belief in a serious situation about
as follows:
An inactive market since the armis
tice was signed, a mild winter, the
consumption of last summer's stocks
rather than the isuance of new orders
for coal this year and a resumption
of business which will come late in
the year.
The labor shortage plays an import
ant part in the forecast.
The Geological survey says that the
mines have been working only on half
Uime basis since last fall.
Idle mines mean idle miners.
and most of these idle miners have
been recruited from the ranks of ali
ens, enied work and wages, these
aliens are retnrinng to Europe by the
boat loads. Already 34,000 have left
these Bhores. At the present rate, by
fall, the labor shortage will be serious.
Secretary Wilson declares that war
took 140.000 miners from the industry.
And the cessation of immigration has
not pernitted the repletion of the wan
ing ranks.
You cannot mine coal without labor.
You may have all the demand the
most optimistic sees ahead. You may
have all the cars the most sanguine
believes in. You may have all the
other necessary conditions for a pros
perous season in the coal industry;
but without men to dig the coal, and
without men to handle the coal, coal
won't get into the bins.
Then add to this the car shortage
predicted by Mr. Hines.
Mr. Hines deals in figures. He says
the railroads have just so many cars
in which to haul the nation's commo
dities. Last year, because of war necessi
ties, coal was given a preference.
A different situation exists today.
Embargoes have been lifted. Many
industries denied coal for two years
are preparin gon a huge scale to fill
a long-unsatisfied want of the people.
Lost Time To Be Regained
Automobile production is going to
coma back into its own. The building
materials industry is going to make
Sewing machines, lawn mowers, car
pet sweepers, kitchen utensils, cooking
btoves, phonographs, pianos and the
thousand and one other commodities
restricted in production, are going to
be produced in unprecedented quani
ties not onlv for domestic use, but for
all the world.
Al lthis means transportation tne
employment of freight cars.
And so, Mr. Hines says there will
be a division of cars this fall. Coal
must take its chance. Coal can be
hauled now in the summer months.
Coal can and should be , bought and
stored now, because it is the. natural
thing to do. This will give other com
modities a chance.
So, soely upon the Question of sup
nly and delivery the dealers and the
consumers find sound advice in Mr.
Garfield's . warning to buy now aiid
store.
And now eometNthe argument ot
higher prices. If the other reasons
tor eariy buying do not suffice, the
pocket-book argument provides the
motive impulse.
Higher prices for coal are predicit
ed by such authorities as Secretary
Wilson and Mr. Babson of the depart
ment of labor; by Irving Fisher, pro
fessor of economy at Yale university,
by J. Ogden Armour, one of the na
tion's masters of industry, and by
Judge Elbert H. Gary, the head of the
great steel industry.
These gentlemen say that present
prices are natural and are here to stay.
They base their reasoning upon the
increased cost of production and in
creased taxation.
Seventy-five per cent of production
cost is labor's wages, labor's com
pensation is reflected in the price of
its products.
Labor today is working on a war
level basis. And labor won't consent
to a reduction.
Taxation was increased by war bills.
Taxed won't be reduced for many
years to come.
Readjustment Only Upward
A new level of prices for labor and
labor's products is established", iheie
will be no readjustment unless it is
upward.
This fact, plus the natural increase
of costs whieii demand and supply
briny;, plus the natural increase ox
; costs wnich the ditliculties 01 winter
deliveries encourage, points to fan in
evitable higher price lor coal this fall
and winter.
There is yet the question of freight
rates to be considered.
Samuel O. Dunn, editor ot ' Kaiiway
Age," declares that the railroads will
have at least a 15 per cent increase
at once.
Senator Cummins, who will be chair
man of the senate interstate commerce
committee, says ho is going to intro
duce a bill in congress to provide for
a ii'cessary increase to take effect by
July 1.
And sound reasoning is given by
both authorities for Due freight rate
increase.
The roads are to be returned to pri
vate ownership shortly. With them
will go a huge deficit created by government-increased
wages.
The roads either will have to cut
wages or increase income.
Labor won't consent to a reduction.
To attempt it without this willingness
certainly would brine trouble.
, The tardy buyer of coal sets" some
i consolation out ofthe possibility of tie
i railroads being kept under govt-Fn-:
ment control for sinie time to come,
j The buyer is laboring under a mis
j guided belief. Senator Cummins says
his party the one now in control of
the senate will not recommend the
( iniim dUte return of the railroads to
private ownership because this would
bankrupt thi roads.

SOLUTION IDE
y ROBT.LOVETT
NEW YORK, July 12. Consolida
tion of all the railroads of the United
States into a few large systems from
12 to 25 as a possible solution of the
nation's railroad problem, is opposed
by Robert S. Lovett, president of the
Union Pacific railroad, in a memoran
dum to congress made public here to
day. Judge Lovett for a time was di
rector of the division of capital ex
penditures of the government railroad
administration under William G. Mc
Adoo as director general.
The effect of the proposed consoli
dation, would be, in his opinion, "to
impair the, credit of the strong roads,
instead of improving the credit of tiie
weak roads. The inevitable effect
would be to reduce the average of
credit of all the railroads."
"Congress," he asserted, "has no
right to compel one railroad to consoli
date with another. It may give one
the right to acquire the property of the
other by condemnation, but it must
pay for it, and here is the difficulty,
pay for it in cash.
"The underwriting of a fabulous
amount must be provided. Will con
gress appropriate the billions neces
sary? Have we bankers enough to
provide the money except by a series
of years? And what will happen to
the financial .welfare of the country' in
the meantime?
"My judgment is against the con
solidation of all the railroads of the
country into a few large systems, be
cause the companies will be too large
and too unweildly for efficient and
economical management. I believe
that the absorption of some of the.
weak lines by the strong lines, upon
fair terms, should be promoted, but
competition in service and facilities
should not only- be preserved, but
should be extended."
Judge Lovett also opposed the plan
which has been discussed for pooling
the net earnings of railroads by di
viding them into groups and establish
es rates sufficient to yield 6 per cent
roads must pay their way, and rates
must and will be increased to relieve
the taxburdened people.
So, whichever way the pendulum of
chance swings whether Uncle Sam
runs the railroads or private owner
ship resumes their operation freight
rate's will be increased and this, if
Senator Cummins and the Republican
party have their say and majority
parties usually do will come by July
1 of this year.
Higher freight rates add to the
costs, of coal. This is still another
reason why dealers and consumers
should get the early buying habit at
once.
Labor Vital Factor
Now, let us sum up tne situation:
Doctor Garfield urges early buying
end storing for two reasons a prob
able scarcity of coal and an inevit
able higher price.
It is apparent that not enough coal
can be mined this fall and winter to
supply the certain abnormal demand
of both domestic and industrial buy
ing. You cannot force a camel through a
needle's eye. Neither can you force
an unsually' large full years' demand
into a few monthes of production.
It is not a question of coal. Un
bounded supplies are in the ground.
The problem is getting the labor to
dig it.
The forthcoming and fast-approaching
shortage of man-power is going to
cripple production. A crippled pro
duction means coal shortage. .
And yet, granting . that the labor
problem can be solved, there 6till is
left the transportation question.
Mr. Hines tells us there won't be
enough cars to haul coal even if we
get the men to mine it, if we delay
buying and do not move thesupply
this summer.
Using the simple law of deduction,
it would seem buying now and storing
is the natural the obvious thing to
do.
Therefore, the avoidene of a coal
famine this fall lies with the coal
dealer and the" consumer of coal.
These two can solve the problem and
and avert a national calamity, and the
burden of the responsibility lies with
them.
Let the dealer, through personal ap
peals and newspaper advertising to
his trade, encourage the filling of coal
bins this summer. Let the large user
of coal buy his supplies and stock up
now.
And, furthermore, let them start on
this plan immediately. . .

or some other specified return on the
book values of each group. Earnings
in excess of the average, he pointed
out would he set aside for the un
profitable roads that earn less.
Suggestion put forward by many
financiers and railroad men that the
government should guarantee fair divi
dends on the book value of the rail
roads and leave the management in
the hands of the railroad" owners, was
criticized by Judge Lovett as imprac
ticable, because he did not believe the
government would take all the risk
and none of the profits.
If a small return of 2, 3 or 4 per cent
were guaranteed, he said, this would
not be sufficient to pay the interest
on bonds already outstanding.
'It would make doubly surer what is
already abundantly secure," he con
tinued, but it could afford no collat
eral nor new issues nor secure new i
loans.
"The importance of re-establishing
railroad credit cannot be over esti
mated," said Judge Lovett, "but nev
ertheless, I am persuaded that no
guaranty short of a return upon the
fair value of railroad property will be
helpful to that end, and that a guar
anty of full value is not practicable
without government operation, which
I regard as beyond present discus
sion. '

The great Duke-Knowles field in Comanche has been Koinf? riht ahead,

11.000 barrels, is just a mile and a half: the ISraswell with 7000 barrels. i.

Tho capitalization of the Brown-Comanche is $100,000. which is very
conservative for such large acreage in the very heart of this wonder pool.
This gives the company sufficient capital to develop its big holdings and

MQRAL BANKRUPTCY MEAT
PACKERS VIOLATING FOOD LAIS
That's Club Bill In Congress Holds Over Profiteering Firms
BY A. E. GELDH0FF
N.
E. A. Washington Bureau
1128-1134 Munsey Bldg.
WASHINGTON. D. C, July 11
Members of congress who are fight
ing the meat trust have worked out
an entirely new method for control
ling the great Chicago packers and
helping to reduce the cost of living.
It's embodied in the Kenyon:Ander
son bill, which has met the approval
of all those interested in the abate
ment of the abuses of packer sov
ereignty, and has just been introduced
in both houses of congress.
Here's the idea:
When a merchant is unable to pay
his debts his business is put in the
hands of a receiver, who manages it
until it is once more on a firm finan
cial foundation, when he turns it back
to the owner, purged of debt.
That's called financial bankruptcy.
The same principle has been applied
to the case of the packers, although
instead of financial bankruptcy .it's
called MORAL bankruptcy.
When any packer violates any of
the provisions of hte Kenyon-Ander-son
act, which places him under a li
cense, he is to be declared a moral
bankrupt, and his business is to be
turned over to a receiver. This re
ceiver is to run the business in. the
public, interest until it is evident that
the packer can obey the law, when his
business is to be returned to horn.
"This proceeding is quite simple,"
said William B. Colver, chairman of
the Federal Trade Commission, who
has done more than any one man to
expose the iniquity of the meat trust.
"It simply adopts the procedure of
the courts everywhere in this coun
try. By it the packing firms are not
dispossessed of their property; they
are merely placed under suspension
by the courts because they cannot
be trusted to operate their business
properly.

Men prbminent In British trade!
cihcle8 who are visiting America say!
Mr. Vanderlip's doleful reports of Eu-'
ropean conditions and European sen-!
timent do not fit Great Britain. Theyj
do not minimize the task that is bc-j
fore the British, but they declare the
spirit of confidence that prevades the
nation and the progress toward re
adjustment, , and. reconstruction made
so far are wonderful.
The trouble with Vanderlip and oth
er visitors, they say, is that they do
not appreciate and cannot measure
the facts by the cursory view they
get in a hurried journey through n
part of Europe. They see the desola
tion, m thg( war-swept area and they
see a people pretty well exhausted
and they come away full -of the idea
that the situation is hopeless or near
ly so. A -look at the boat crew in col
lapse at the end of a terribly hard
race might .make a poor-observer feel
there Was no more strength in the
team but a week later another Idea
might be obtained If one had oppor-1
tunity to see what" rest and nature
had done meantime. ! -
Europe to-a large degree, has been
prostrated and the destruction and
exhaustion are manifest in a thous
and forms, but the signs of recupera
tion are many, they say, especially in
the British Islea and they insist that
you can .see the same in France ahd
Eelgium if you look for it and that
while it will take time and much of
effort to get things right the real pro
gress,' that of a change in the spirit ot
the peopel from the terrible weariness
despair and lack of initiation has
come and everyone is perking up ana
throwing tft the desperation lhat clo
thed the continent.
That's the big thing they say the
alteration in the mental attitude.
They believe Great Britian is lead
ing the way and that the confidence
of the British is spreading through
the neighboring nations.
As evidence of British confidence
they point to the organization of 17,
000 manufacturing and producing
concerns to work together for the
world trade. . This body is sending
its agents into every part of, the globe
to represent Its Interests, advise it or
every opportunity of commerce from
a "chain of commercial outposts
throughout the world.'
The cleverest and most aggresive
spirits of Pritish trade are active in
this organization. One of them, speak
ing of the nterpise said: "A big
job? Of course we have a big job,
.one of the biggest we ever jhave
known in the history of the nation.
"All the more reason why we should
go to it with heart and soul. There's
no joy in winning little things.
There's something fine in doiug big
things. We're ia for something tre
mendously big now. And we're going)
to win."
BORAH REQUESTS SENATE BE

PARIS. July 12. Senator Borah's
request that the United States Senate
be given the joint memorandum of
Secretary Lansing, Henry White and
General Bliss on the Shantung, ques

conference circles. While it was gen
erally known that these three mem

Germany's rights in Shantung to Jap

COUNTY RUADS
STAND SEVERE
TESTS
By A. H. Gardner, Secretary
Cohise County Highway Commission
The past fourteen days has been a
severe storm period, over the state bi
Arizona and Cochise county in par
ticular. The heavy rains and floods
therefrom have given the newly con
structed roads the supreme test as is
Instanced by the situation at Douglas,
in the vicinity of the Whitewater
river bridge. This is the locality where
so many people in Douglas and the
Warren District who for months have
been shouting from the house tops
that the grade of the new highway
from Douglas to Forrest Station was
too high, are now convinced that the
grade is not high enough. Commis
sioner H. A. Clark, last Sunday, took
several of the critics out on the road
and when they returned to Douglas
they were converts to the original idea
of the commission and its engineers.
No matter what a commission or its
engineer may know by personal ob
servation by gaining knowledge from
those who ; have gone through the
"you flood period," you will always
find many people from "Missouri" at
home. "So far as the Douglas-Bisbee
highway is concerned, "they have
teen shown."
About four miles of paving has been
completed from Douglas towards For
rest Station.
' The Silver Creek bridge is progres
sing and one span should be poured
the coming week.
All concrete work from Bernardino
Station towards Douglas is progres
sing. Work is about finished from Pearce
to Cochise, there remaining but one
bridge (nearly completed) and the fill
ing of six dtps to be done which will
leave the road finished all but drag
ging, tl is now open to traffic and a
speed of 25 miles an hour upwards can
be attained easily from one end to the
other. '
The Benson-Tombstone road . is fin
ished with the exception of three
bridges and the finish 'dragging and Is
open to traffic.
The state highway from' Bisbee to
Fairbank is in excellent shape . and
open to travel almost to Fairbank, but
the Fairbank end is only for pleasure
drives as yet. as you must turn back
when within a mile of Fairbank.. It
will be open through about July 25.
The "follow the ground" builder has
been completely rputed this storm

three wells in the ground, one of them
Well No. 1, is down 1400 feet, and an
other well Is down 2000 feet, with a

BY REVIEW
WEEK'S REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 12. Greater In
dustrial and mercantile activity, a
sharp advance In call loans to quota
tions approximating the year's highest
rates, the more adverse movement of
exchange against London and Paris
and the president's delivery of the
peace treaty to the senate, were the
outstanding factors of another busy
week in the stock market.
Expansion of general trade and fin
ished products was most clearly shown
in enlarged bank, clearings, the sub
stantial gain in unfilled orders re
ported by the United States Steel cor
poration and the widespread demand
for leading commodities, as indicated
by the rise in metals, refined copper
being quoted at 21 cents a pound.
Weakness of sterling and francs, the
former receding to lowest levels in
almost five years, was without effect
upon market values, but among inter
national bankers this movement em
phasized the need for early completion
of the plan to effect Europe's finan
cial rehabilitation.
The' president's address to the sen -
Me was made the occasion of a bear
attack, but prices rallied easily in the
various issues which have been tne
special objects of speculative atten
tion for the past four months.
From the view point of the investor
the most disappointing feature was
the further backwardness of high
grade rails and the failure of the
bond market to reflect more than a
moderate mid-year inquiry. This was
accounted for in part, however,, by
new corporate financing, which
absorbed much of the floating supply
of hew capital.
Latest official advices show a down
ward revision of estimates for some
of the principal crops, especially
wheat, but the prospective yield, even
allowing for additional deterioration,
promises to exceed by fully 100,000,000
bushels the high record of four years
ago.
RESERVE BANK STATEMENT
WASHINGTON, July 12. Gold re
sources of the twelve federal reserve
banks showed a decrease for the
fourth successive week on the state
ment of conditions at the close of bus
iness July 11, issued tonight. The de
crease amounted to $17,122,000, and
reduced the ratio of gold reserves to
the notes which they secure from 61.7
per cent, as it stood on July 3, to 60.5
per cent.
BANKS HOLD BIG RESERVE
NEW YORK, July 12. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shown
that they hold $33,082,270 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
an increase of $26,654,570 from last
weeK.

v STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 12. Starting at a
moderate pace, today's brief session of
the stock market soon became active
on renewed buying of speculative
shares .especially tobaccos and motor
accessories. ,
Later . the movement embraced
equipments, shippings, steels and mis
cellaneous issues, also low priced rails
with Denver and Rio Grande the. chief
feature at a gain of virtually 5 points.
United States Steel was variable at
the outset, but developed marked
strength toward the close, gaining al
most 2 points. Crucible Steel made a
sudden rise of 6 points.
Coppers were not very responsive to
the 21-cent price quoted for the refin
ed metal, although Anaconda, Utah
and American Smelting hardened with
the general list in the sweeping up
rush at the end. ,
The more prominent features were
American and Lorillard Tobaccos,
United Cigars, Annex Rubber, Kelly
Springfield and Keystone Tires, Unit
ed States Rubber, Mexican and Pan-

shares. 'Sales 82,500.
Trading in bonds lacked special fea
ture, but Liberty issues and underly
ing bonds of secondary transportation
were steady to firm. Total sales, par
value, $4,375,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call during the week.
COPPER MARKET.
N. Y. The copper market Is steady
with quotations about unchanged at
18 l-4c for spot and July shipments
and 18 1-2 for August It is noted
that one large dealer is willing to
book what is considered favorable
business at 18 3-4c for August, but
most sellers are holding for the high
er level. The 1 demand Is somewhat
smaller than It was on the previous
days of the week and what contracts
have been placed have involved mod
erate quantities.

the Town
in the good old state of Texas.
When he first arrived there he no
ticed that the corners of all the build
ings were worn off until they were
beautifully rounded about six feer
from the ground. This phenomonen,
Mr. Kendall found by careful observa
tion to be caused by the general prac
tice of the natives in leaning against

THE WOMEN OF FflflWCE TAKE CARE
DF RELIGIOUS BELIEFS OF FAIWILY
The Cathedral of Cologne is One of the
Masterpieces of German Art; Was 800
Years -in Building.
BY W. R. "WEBB
First Sergeant, Army Service Corps, A. E. F.
In this week's Btory I will attempt
to .tell a few of my experiences, while
in France and Germany, which I had
with the various Welfare Organiza
tions such as the Red Cross, the Sal
vation Army, the Y. M. C. A. and the
K. C.
Religious Toleration
In my story two weeks ago, some
of our conscientious Catholic friends
took exception to a mention made of
an event which happened some four
hundred : years ago and which was a
story told by the guide at Bordeaux
appointed by the church there for
the specific purpose of explaining
the story so that I simply have the
guide' word for it as to the story.
There was no attempt on my part
to stir up any sentiment against or
in favor of the Catholic church. I
simply tell these stories as my ex
perience in France and any returned
soldier will vouch for the truthfulness
of :these stories.
I have no prejudices in regard to
any church as I find that I have
something in common with every liv
ing person regardless of religion and if
there ever was a time in the history of
the vrld whe8it is advisable for us
all to be tolerant of all people, it. Is
now. We have just emerged from
a cycle of world-wide slaughter where
there has been no sense of proportion
in regard to the other man.
Catholics and Protestants, Jews
and Gentiles all came into this world
in exactly the same manner, live
here a brief period and then pass on
over exactly the same route without
prejudice for or against any of them
on account of their creeds, national
ity or individual thoughts.
Yet in the name of religion these
brothers of humanity have been
fighting among themselves during
the past centuries believing that his
creed is the only one, and that alt
others are wrong and lead straight
to helL
Today this spirit is being elimin
ated. While I was in France I saw
a delegation of Protestant ministers
who t were, on their way to Interview
the Pope with the object of bringing
about co-operation between the Cath
olic and Protestant churches of the
world so in what I have to say m
this article it will be simply the
facts in the case and printed with a
view of giving the reader the truth-i
ful information in regard to condi
tions in France and not with any in
tention of making trouble among the
various organizations mentioned.
French Catholics
In speaking of religious matters In
France it is impossible to do so with
out mentioning the Catholic church
as' that is the only religious belief
in that country. I .visited dozens of
cathedrals in all parts of France and
several in Germany. The cathedral
of Cologne is one of the most won
derful pieces of architecture in the
world. , It is situated on the west
bank of the Rhine river and Its three
spires rise above every other build
ing In that big city.
I attended the service In , this
cathedral on Easter Sunday this year
and witnessed the most impressive
religious ceremonies of any church
it has been my privilege to attend.
This cathedral was nearly 800 years
in the erection of the edifice and the
art glass window? alone are worth
going the necessary five thousand
miles to see.
Altar to Allies
In Paris, Notre Dame, which is the
French for "Our Lady", is probably the
most noted cathedral in Europe,
more because of the associations inj
connection with it than its size or
age. It stands on a small island in
the Seine river in the heart of Parts
and has' been used for centuries as
the place where the authority for
governing was entrusted to the for
mer kings and queens.
It became even more famous dur
ing the present war as being the
only Catholic church in the' world
which has erected an altar to the
Allied nation of the world In a cor
ner of the main building which has
been given the name of the "Allied
Chapel," and is crowned with- the
flags of the allies.
In France the men do not take their
religion very seriously but the women
make up in earnestness for the in
difference of the men. It seems to
be the general belief that the women
should look after the religious need
of the whole family.
Faith of French Women
As an instance of the implicit faith
of the French women in their beliefs
I will site a little experience I had in
Bordeaux. While wandering around
the little shops on the Rue St. Cather
ine I dropped into a small lace shop
and waB greeted with some saluta
tion in English and soon found that
the proprietor and his wife had been
in Chicago , and could talk very good
English, so we soon became fast
friends, as the French always have
time to talk, especially to an Ameri
can soldier. ,
They mentioned their daughter
Jeanne several times and of coures
I was interested immediately. Jeanne
soon made her appearance and after
a greeting In French she asked me
If I would not like to go to the
Cathedral with her while she said
her prayers. On the way I noticed
a Madellion suspended on a' chain
with the picture of a Frenchman so
I asked her who the picture repre
sented. She said It was a lieutenant
she was going to marry in two weeks
and he was the one she was going to
pray for, as he was still on the line.
After reaching the cathedral she
left me to wander around looking at
the pictures and statues while she
went to the altar in the center of the
church. After a few minutes I came
up to where she was kneeling and
found her with her arms around an
other very beautiful girl who was a
widow.
In a few minutes she joined me and
I asked her who her friend was. She
said this girl was the widow of a
captain who had been killed about
six months previously and that she
came to the Cathedral every day to
pray that her son would be as great
a man as his father and be of greater
service to France.
I left Bordeaux that evening for
Paris and did not return for over a
month, but as I was walking up from
the Midi Station to the 'American
headquarters I met Jeanne again and
after the ' formal greetings I asked
her about the beautiful widow. She
said the widow was doing nicely and
the baby boy was growing more like
his father every day. I' asked her
where sha was going and she said
she had bee'h married two weeks and
was on her way to' the Cathedra? on
the same mission as the beautiful
widow. I though, to myself at; the
time that if the American people
took their various religions as seri
ously as -these two girls did and had
the same implicit faith combined
with our advanced educational- ad
vantages we would have far more in
terest taken in our churches than
we have in the present day. These
two girls Bhow to true type, the ex
pression of the Spirit of France. .
Ride In Box Cars
In regard to the Welfare Organiza
tions in the A. E. F.. I will first give
a few of my experiences during my
year's stay in the A. E. F. When we
first landed af La Havre we had
heard a great deal about the Welfare
organizations in France and so I im
mediately hunted up the Y. M. C. A.
and found where there had been one
but was temporarily closed. We
loaded Into the famous "40 hommes
et 8 Chaveaux" the next day and rode
all night, all the next day and up till
10 o'clock the second .night in box
cars so cramped that we could not
even lay ' down to sleep.- Being a

In the 12th Century Cologne becam the home of German art. This great
cathedral was begun in 1248 and was completed in 1880. Cologne, now a
city of 600,000 people, was. founded in 38 B.C. by the Romans. 'In 138 B.C.
it was raised to the dignity of a colony of Rome hence the name. It was
here that the mother of the notorious Emperor Nero was born.
area the next day and marched 16
kilometers toN our first', home in a
barn in a little town near Nevers.
Y. Canteen Closed
We stayed in that area for about
two months and finally ran out of
smoking tobacco so after much per
Buation I succeeded in getting a pass
to Nevers at 4 o'clock one afternoon
for the purpose of getting a supply
at the Y canteen at Nevers. The only
means of transportation available
was an 1812 model bicycle but as my
pass was to terminate at ' 9 o'clock
the next morning I had to make the
best of it. I rode up and down the
hills of France for something lfke
18 miles that night and arrived in
Nevers pretty, much down and out
about 7 o'clock. I hunted up the Y
and found the secretary, explaining
to him that I had rode about a hun
dred miles for a small supply of
cigarettes for the men In my com
pany. He said that the canteen closed
at 5 o'clock and would open at 9 the
next morning. I urged and coaxed
him for about 10 minutes to sell me
a few, as I could not be there the
next morning, but there was nothing
doing even when I offered twice the
price for them.
Of course what I thought of him
wouldn't do to print, t went over to
the K. C. and explained my predica
ment and they gave me a small box
for nothing. I also hunted up the
Red Cross and they gave me aJfew
more so I returned to camp about 4
a. m. the next morning with about
two cigarettes per man and a great
deal of grievance against the Y.
Shortly after that we moved to
little town near Paris by the name
of Noisel. When I arrived there I
found a email canteen being oper
ated by the Y in charge of a Unitarian
minister, assisted by two Jewish sol
diers. There was a Blgn out to the
effect that the canteen would open
at 6 o'clock. I was going on guard
at 6:30 and wanted some tobacco. I
waited till 6:25 and no one showed
uPi so I had to . do without. I had
occasion about 7 o'clock to go over
to a cafe on business and found both
the clerks ' there, having a good time,
and apparently with no intention of
opening the canteen that night.
No Cigarettes
A few days later I was at a little
town called Veaux near Chateau
Thierry and a Y truck loaded with
tobacco and candy stopped and asked
for some officer with the 82nd divi
sion as he had a truck load of can
teen supplies which he was ordered
to deliver. He was told that the 82nd
division had moved the day before
and no one knew where they were.:
He would have to go to Paris to1 find
out. He said he had come from Paris
and so guessed he would have to
take the stuff back If he couldn't
find the 82nd. The men who were
there told him they were all out of
tobacco and asked him to sell them
some of the supplies. He refused to
do so as he was ordered to deliver
it to the 82nd so he took them back
127 kilometers to Faris.
So we see that from these experi
ences the men formed an opinion of
the Y which it will take years to
live down-and all because of a few
inefficient secretaries who could not
or were afraid to use just a little bit
of good common horse sense in their
-business affairs and we find that all
of these adverse experiences were In
connection with the canteen. And
this condition was not confined to
any isolated instances. It was gen
eral in the canteen business in most
every Y or at least every one I saw.
Another thing that was disliked
about the canteens was the fact that
we always had to line up and wait
anywhere from 15 minutes to an hour
before we could 'get anything. As a
general rule the men were billeted in
small towns and they would get pass
es to the nearest city for a day or
two at tima. They wanted to see
.1 'J A a. A.!
iua biguia aim uui wasie any Lime
in waiting in line. They had to lifle
up for everything in camp and when
on pass they felt that they were to
a certain extent free American citk
zens for the time being, and objected
to doing anything that savored ol
army detail.
Salvation Army Different
With the Salvation Army condi
tions were a little different I remem
ber one night I arrived in camp after
supper and was too late to get any
thing to at I went over to the
Salvation Army ' building and asked
the man there if he would sell me a
package of cakes. He asked me.it I
was hungry and with the reply that
I was he said, come , around to the
back door and I'll see what I can do,
as the canteen is closed now and we
can't sell anything. I went around
to the back door and he was waiting
with the package of cakes. I offered
to pay him for it but, he said the
canteen was closed and he couldn't
sell anything, sq refused fo accept
the money.
The value of the package was ten
cents but the value of the service
rendered was a friend for life and so
we find that the Salvation Army was
small iu- size -aB compared with the
Y but it stood ace high in the estima
tion of the men because they always
tried to render a real service of some
kind instead of trying to do a big
business.
American Girls in France
As regards the American girls In
France who were with the various
Welfare organizations, I have heard
a few criticisms about them, but it
came always from people who had
never seen one . working there and
who knew nothing of the facts at all.
Some have stated that the Y girls
and Red Cross girls were seen smok
ing cigarettes in the cafes in Paris,
and as I believe I have been in prac
tically every cafe in Paris frequented
by Americans, and on all of the
prominent occasions I believe that I
am qualified to say that such is not
the case. I have asked other men
and with one exception they all are
unstinted in their praise of the
American girls wcking in Francp.
While in Paris on Nov. 11th I did
see one American girl who was not
conducting herself as the best of tiO
ciety would demand but on that day
I also noted even the highest officers
in the American army were doing
even worse stunts than she was, so
that out of Bome 2500 Y girls it is
not a great catastrophy if there
should be one black sheep among
them.
One Y girl, one Salvation Army
girl or one Red Cross girl had more
influence in building up the run down
morale of the men returning from
the front Jne than fifty men secre
taries of any of the Welfare organiza
tions. I have never heard of an Ameri
can soldier speaking of the American
girls there with any other terms than
those of the greatest respect and ad
miration and who would not defend
the character of the American girls
regardless of the occasion.
After being isolated for some five
or six months in a lot of little French
villages where an American girl was
never seen and then to accidentally
meet a real American girl was one
of the greatest God sends the soldier
had. I remember one time after "we
had been in France for over four
months some one discovered that
there were two American Red Cross
girls in a city about 20 miles from
where we were billeted. During
these four months we had never even
heard of one, much less seen one, so
that evening there were some fifty
applications for passes to' this city
All the men in the company wanted
to see what an American girl looked
like. Unless a person has been in a
foreign country away from his kind
for a while he cannot realize how
quickly perspective changes and how
home ties are forgotten and their in
fluence banished from the mind and
especially under the conditions, we
were living in. I have seen hundreds
of soldiers .go into one. of the huts
and just sit around looking a the
girls there, with no intention- of
speaking to them, but perfectly satis
fied to see what they looked like
again.
Girls Like Officers
The only objection to the Y girls
and Red Cross girls I ever beard ol
was the fact that they almost in
variably, when off duty, associated
with the officers which caused a
feeling among the men that they
considered the enlisted man below
their social scale. Of course this la
not a legitimate complaint as the
girls had a perfect right to associate
with whontever they pleased when
off duty. One of the men In Coblenz
spoke to me about it one evening and
we walked around the streets that
evening and took in all the prominent
cafes for the purpose of seeing if this
condition was a fact with the result
of finding 26 Y girls and 12 Red
Cross girls and 100 per cent officers.
This reminds me of the usual form
In which the soldier usually started
to tell a story. He began something
like this: "When the American sol
dier has returned to the United
States, the Y secretaries have left
Paris and the officers have said good
bye to the Y girls," etc. The aver
age American soldier is no boob and
he usually . forms a pretty correct
estimate of the situation which is
hard to disprove.
The Knights of Columbus did an
excellent piece of work in the A. E.
F., with their policy of giving away
whatever they had. Their organize,
tion operated in fewer number of
places than other societies but when
ever they did do anything it was well
done. Cigarettes and tobacco were
always on the counters for those who
cared to help themselves and any
legitimate request for athletic sup
plies was always granted in a way
that gave the impression to the men
that these supplies were for the sol
diers and the men always appreciated
anything In the way of out door
sports.
"Y" Money Well Spent
Now the question naturally comes
up as to whether or not the money
donated by the people of the States
was wasted. From my experience I
will say that as a whole the money
was well spent Naturally these or
ganizations were not 100 per cent ef
ficient. But can anyone mention a
war industry of any kind that was
100 per cent efficient. The Ameri
can army was far from being 100 per
cent efficient, the people at home
were not 100 per cent efficient in
their work. The very nature of war
made it Impossible.
The truth about the Y work lies
between the Y enthusiast who claims
that everything they did was fine,
and the disgruntled soldier who Bays
the Y did nothing for him. Both
Bides are far from the truth.
Good Work By "Y"
At Bordeaux the Y has erected a

theatre Beating 8,000 men with a shoif
of some kind every night. It is al
ways packed to capacity. At Paris
the Y conducts half a dozen hotels
where they furnish accomodations at
practically half the price of the
French hotels. They conduct tour
ing trips to all the point 3 of interest
gratis. In Coblenz they have an en
tertainment ' "Feist Hall" and two
large theatres which are filled twice
a day. At every" point of scenic in
terest in France and along the Rhine
they furnish means for the soldier to
see these places at a very small cost.
At St. Nazarie the Y conducts a
school for soldiers who have theatri
cal ambitions and they put these
men in companies which travel the
Y circuit and give them the neces
sary experience and the soldiers the
entertainment. There is hardly a
camp of over 500 men where the Y
does not operate a hut of some kind
and give the men reading matter and
stationery, handle their mail, money
remittances and a hundred other ac
comodations which the army organiza
tion does not provide. The state
ment that the Y did not get to the
front is utterly false, as the records
at headquatrers show that 49 of
them were killed, 89 were seriously
wounded and 23 were cited for ex
ceptional bravery, while hundreds of
the Y me nand women risked their,
lives at the front many of whom I
saw personally.
Gen. Pershing Praises Y"
General Pershing in his report
cabled to the Secretary of War on
Jan. 16th, 1919, states: "The welfare
of the troops touches my responsibil
ity as Commander in Chief to the
mothers and fathers and kindred of
the men who came to France in the
impressionable period of youth. They
could not have the privilege accord
ed European soldiers during the
period of leave of visiting their
families and renewing their home
ties. Fully realizing that the stand
ard of conduct that should 'be estab
lished for them must have perman
ent influence on their lives and on
the character of their future citizen
ship, the Red Cross, the Y. M. C. A.,
the Knights of Columbus, the Salva
tion-Army and the Jewish Welfare
Board, as auxiliaries in this work,
were encouraged in every possible
way. The fact that our soldiers, in a
land of different customs and lan
guages, have borne themselves In a
manner in keeping with the cause for
which they fought, is due not only
to the efforts in their behalf, but
much more to their high ideals, their
discipline and their inate sense of
self respect. It should be recorded,
however, that the members of these
welfare societies have been untiring
in their desire to be of real service
to our officers and men. The patrio
tic devotion of these representative
men and women has given a new
significance to the Golden Rule, and
we owe to them a debt of gratitud
that can never be repaid."
Investigation Report
WTiile at Chaumont a few months
ago I, met Raymond B. Fosdick, chair
man of the Government's Commission
on Training Camp Activities of the
War Department. General Pershing
had asked him to investigate the vari
ous Welfare organizations and report
to him the results. After an extend
ed tour of the camps in France and
Germany he submitted this report,
which gives the best idea of the
actual situation and condition in the
Welfare organization that I have
heard of. In part his report is as fol
lows: "Of the seven organizations that
joined in the united war work cam
paign for the $170,000,000 fund last
fall, six are working with the troops
in France the Y. M. C. A., the Y.
W. C. A., the Knights of Columbus,
the Jewish Welfare Board, the Salva
tion Army, and the American Library
Association. The other organization,
the War Camp Community Service,
Is not represented, as it would bei

impossible to develop its specialized
line of work in France.
"These organizations have been
working directly under the adminis
tration section of General Pershing's
staff. Added to the tremendous pro
ject of education, .athletics, and en
tertainment which the army itself Is
conducting, the work of these socie
ties helps to form what is probably
the largest and most comprehensive
leisure-time program ever undertak
en. The effect of this work upon the
future citizenship of the United
States is incalculable.
"Of the six organizations, the Y. IK.
C. A. is the largest. Its budget con
stitutes 58 per cent of the money
collected last fall. It has received
a good deal of criticism from the sol
diers. Some of this is merited; much
of it is due, I believe, to misunder
standing. Probably the bulk of the
criticism arises from the operation
by the Y. M. C. A. of the army can
teens. Personally I believe It was a
mistake for the Y. M. C. A. to go Into
this business. The canteen has been
an army perquisite by which company
funds were increased, and the sol
diers could not understand why it
should be handed over to a private so
ciety which was raising millions at
home for support.
"Moreover, the persopnel of the Y.
M. C. A. was untrained for this kind
of work. In the minds of the soldiers
it became a commercial organization,
and from this stigma it has never suc
ceeded in freeing itseif. It must be
remembered that the Y. M. C. A. un
dertook this work as a service to the
army command. The charge that it
made money out of the canteen is er
roneous. Fine Character of Personnel
"Another ground for citicism may
be found In the character of the per
sonnel. While many of the men wera
excellently qualified, many others were
utterly unadapted to the work, and
had no common ground in mixing
with our virile, red-blooded young sol
diers. The Y. M. C. A. women in
France were of an exceptionally high
Lorder, far better adapted on the aver
age than the men. The Y. M. C. A.
has 2,500 young women serving with
the troops. Their work is beyond
praise. The Y. M. C. A. had the en
tire womanhood of America to draw
from, whereas the best material among
the men was in the army.
- "In discussing these circumstances
one must not forget the enormous
volume of creditable work which It ha
carried on. Its huts are to be found
with nearly every unit of troops in the
A. E. F. Its athletic department, its
widespread entertainment facilities, its
admirable organization of the leave
areas, the work which it did in
forming the educational machinery of
the army, are all on the credit side of
the balance, and at General Headquar
ters I found the liveliest gratitude for
the Y. M. C. A.
Y. W. C. A.
"The work of the Y. W. C. A. covers
two general fields: Providing proper
accommodations for women employed
both by the army and the welfare so
cieties, and providing rest and recrea
tion rooms for French women In war
industries. The work of this society
is of an exceptionally high character,
and its willingness to accept respon
sibility, together with its imagination
in discovering and its ingenuity In
meeting the real needs among women
workers, have had gratifying results.
The K. C.
The Knights of Columbus Is carry
ing on work largely similar in rlan to
that of the Y. M. C. A. It has a sub
stantial number of huts and recreation
halls, and it has done good work. It
has done much to stimulate the in
terets of the army in boxing ami is
taking generally a prominent part in
the interallied games at Pershing
Stadium, near Paris. A legitimate
criticism would be that the amouut of
Its work In France Is not as larse as
the size of its allotment in lust fall n

The Knights were late in starting
and they have never overcome that
handicap. Moreover, I believe- they
are losing a real opportunity through
failure to employ women personnel.
I am convinced that the average i
woman worker attached to hut is'
worth four or five men workers. Cer.
tainly her effect on the morale and'
6pirit of the troops is extraordinary.
An "honest-to-God American girl", as
the soldiers call her, can do more to!
keep the men cheerful and create an
atmosphere of home than any other
factor, and the work of our women in
France has been in no small degree
responsible for the unflagging devo
tion and inexhaustible patience with!
which our troops earned forward their
high enterprise.
"The work or the Special Commlt-
tp nf the. National Catholic Warl
Council which corresponds somewhat
roughly to the Y. W. (J. A., is being
conducted in Paris with marked suc
cess. The institution which this com
mittee is conducting in Avenue Wag
Tam in Paris is perhaps one ofthe
most interesting and significant
pieces of work in the city.
Jewish Work
"The Jewish Welfare Board is ad
mirable in every respect, and Is
working under able leadership. Its
buildings servo all troops regardless
of faith, and I was interested to note
in a trip to the Le Mans area how
widely its facilities were employed by J
Jew and Gentile alike. j
Salvation Army Popular I
The Salvation Army is easily thej
most popular of the six organizations. :
The work of this organization Is
much smaller than most people think.!
Where the Y. M. C. A. has 6,000 rep--resentatives
in France, and the
Knights of Columbus 800, the Salva
tion Army haa less than 200. Its
fame has spread far beyond its work.
and it is difficult to find a doughboy i
who does not apeak its praise- Con-!
trary to general belief, it does not j
give supplies away free except in!
cases of need. Its policy la to sell
its canteen supplies even its famed
doughnuts. It is the inherent spirit,
of service that has endeared this or-j
ganizatiou to the doughboy. Its per-(
aonnel has been carefully selectea
from trained workers in the Salva-,
tion Army,, and no task has been too
humble, and no service too small for
theui to perform. ;
Library Association j
"The American Library Association:
with its ample supply of books, has
workrd largely through the other or-1
ganizations. although.' through its;
mail Iservic. it-hassept thousands of'
books to individual soldiers Upon re
quest. No matter how isolated a'sol-j
dier might be, bu could have books
for the anking.
"I have come increasingly to the
hrlirf in t'wo years' of 'intimate asso
ciation with this work, that the sec-,
tarian basis underlying much of itj
lo fundamentally wrong None 'of the
societies works exclusively for its
own constituency, but the auspices
through which privileges are extend
ed are sectarian. The tendency of
this arrangement is to stimulate rival
ries. To see the representatives of i
these agencies vying in an attempt
to make a last good impression upon j
returning troops Is to despair of the j
whole system of social work in the
war. j
"To have Protestant huts. Catholic
huts, and Jewish huts in the samej
camp or operating in the same areaj
is wrong in principle and represents a j
waste of overhead and a duplication
of personnel. No one resents thrisl
more than the troops themselves. A j
baseball is a baseball to the soldiex;
no matter whether it is presented by
the Y. M. C. A., the Knights of Colum
bus or the Jewish Welfare Eoard.
The same it true of huts, chocolate,
entertainment, stationery, or good ad
vice. "If we ever have another war, I be
lieve far better results will he ob
tained by eliminating religious strati
fication of the sort just mentioned
and by reducing to the lowest pos
sible minimum the number of or
ganizations working directly with the
troops. There is no reason why a
single non-sectarla-t organization In
this war should not have handled the
whole problem of recreation, for the
army.
"I believe we have reached a poirt
in the development of much of this
social work. ' The successful experi
ence of the army officers at home
and In France In handling complex
entertainment and educational pro
grams justifies this belief."

THE WEEK WITH THE T
T "SUXCAT, JULY 13, 1919.
Summer days may be responsible
for anything. They may induce that
spirit of inertia which causes even
milady to forsake the bridge table,
turn her back on the afternoon cup
of tea and say farewell for a time to
the formal luncheon. They may pro
voke new programs, Unusual because
of warm weather fancies and the de
sire for a distinctive seasonal idea.
AH of which may or may not have
anything to do with the plan which
the members of the Business Girls
Club of the Y. W. C. A. will carry
out tomorrow evening when they are
hosttsses to the members of the Red
Triangle Club at a Dutch supper in
the cafeteria. A Dutch super sounds
interesting but not so thrilling as the
follow up. .The young ladies are go
ing to show themselves to be enter
tainers in the last degree and have
reserved thirty seats at the motion
picture theatre to accomodate the par
ty. Of course the members of the
Business Girls Club will pay the war
tax as well as the price of the ticket
and just picture those of the sterner
8iX refaining from passing out the
necessary coin and dangling their
hands carelessly at their sides while
the girls bid them enter and see the
"fillums" at their expense. Put this
lively and growing group is strictly up
to the minute and likely to" launch
more than one new scheme of enter
tainment in the future. Incidentally
the name of the club is to be changed.

LETTER
Home Service section of the Amer
ican Red Cross have been instructed
by Pacific Division Headquarters to
inform relatives of men in the Expe
ditionary forces that inquiries about
casualties, illness, location and gen
eral welfare may be directed to the
Adjutant General's Office, War De
partment, Washington.
Request for the discharge of men
serving in the Army of Occupation in
Divisions 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 will be con
sidered by the War Department when
there is extreme need, such as illness,
death or entire dependence. These
requests may be sent by members of
the family, Chapter Home Service
section or Division officials,' to the
office of the Chief of Staff, War De
partment, Room. 221, State, War and
Navy Building, Washington. Requests
must be supported by affidavits from
a physician in case of illness, and by
disinterested persons in other cases.
All Red Cross Chapters In the Pa
cific Division are preparing the his
tory of the accomplishment - of the
American Red Cross In California,
Nevada and Arizona, during the war.
These chapter records are sent to
Division headqnarters in duplicate,
one copy of them being forwarded to
National Headquarters, Washington,
and the other being kept in the Di
vision files for permanent record.
These histories form the basis for
many statistics of national accom
plishment and also contain stories of
picturesque occurrences in. individual
communities. They include detailed
accounts of the production accom
plished in each chapter, of the assist
ance distributed by the Home Service
section, the work of the Juniors, the
record made by the Nursing Service
during the influenza epidemic, and in
sending nurses ami nurse's aids into
direct war work, the work of canteens
in serving troops, and the many con
tributions from each chapter territo
ry to war funds and membership
drives.
Boys and Girls in the Pacific Di
vision will collect salvage during the
coming school term, sale of which will
make up th fund which entitles each
school so financed to membership in
the Amertaan Red Cross as a Junior
auxiliary. Membershin as a school
auxiliary is. based on the collection
of a sum of monev eouivalent to
cents for each pupil in the school..
Salvage collected by the Juniors and
sold through the Chapter Salvage and
Shop is credited to them, the income
thus received becoming the Chapter
School Fund. In accounting for its
activity, the Salvage and Shop De
partment segregates for this fund aft
cash received from sale of articles
sent in by the school children.
The plan serves a multiple purpose
the school spirit is emphasized, as
child makes individual, contribution,
the school being credited only for the
cooperative effort; the idea of thrift
Is strengthened and the child's desire
to help other children is fostered,
since 60 per cent of the membership
fee goes into the National Children's
Fund for relief of Children abroad.
The remainder is to be expended by
the Chapter School Committee for
community relief for school children.
Other means of raising money for the
membershin fees are nermitted hut
schools are urged to carry out the
Salvage pYogram as far as possible. J
About 450.000 Russian prisoners In
more than 100 German prison camps
who are being repatriated to their
own country are receiving much need
ed assistance from the American Red
Cross and the Inter-Allied Commis
sion. Thousands of them have been
prisoners for four years, had lost in
terest in themselves and had given up
hope of ever seeing Russia again. The
distribution of food by the Inter-Allied
Commission and supplies and per
sonal comforts by the American Red
Cross produced an almost immediate
change. They want to go back to
Russia and although not a demonstra
tive race, these Russian soldiers are
extremely grateful for what America
has done for them. .
The Red Cross Commission entered
Germany last January and established
headquarters In the American Embas
sy at Berlin. The work of repatria
tion is expected to be completed by
the end of August
Billions of flies that are adding to
the troubles of the people in the Bal
kans are not going to have the unin
terrupted feast they have been look
ing forward to. The American Red
Cross has shipped large quantities of
mosquito netting to its mission in that
country.
Red Cross photographers have made
exclusive pictures, motion and still, of
the Interior of the Rheims Cathedral,
special courtesies being extended to
them by the church authorities. The

"I'm coming back some day, and when I do it will be as a STAU!" Two years
ago Dorothy Green said this over her shoulder to the casting director at the World
Studio at Ft. Lee. N. J., who dismissed her because she insisted in pushing into
the front row of "extra" girls engaged for a movie production. Last week a new
star reported at the Jersey studio.
"You don't remember me, do you?" she asked the casting director. "You fired
me once and I told you I would come back as a star. Here 1 am."
Y. W. C. A. OPENS SCHOOL
FOR SERVICE ABROAD.
Only Women From Europe and Near
East Eligible.
A school to train women for "old
country" service in Europe and the
Near East is to be opened in New
York City by the Y. W. C. A.
The school is the result of requests
from representatives of a dozen na
tionalities as well as of Americans
cf foreign-born parents who feel the
need for trained women in the recon
struction work of the world at pres
ent. Only women from the Near East
and devastated countries of Europe
ami American women connected with
these countries by parentage are eli
gible. Students must speak and read
the English language and the lan
guage of the country in which they
The course lasts six weeks and ad-
mission is by scholarship entirely, all
living and tuition expenses being met
by the Y. W. C. A. Four houses have
been" rented in the neighborhood of
the association's headquarters at 600
Lexington avenue. - These houses will
be used as school and dormitory
buildings. ' ! f
The course will include instruction
in recreation for children, health edu
cation, infant welfare, contagious dis
eases, prenatal and maternity care,
social work, cooking, folk dancing, j
systematized housekeeping, arts -.and
crafts, story telling and community
singing.
No girl will be considered under
twenty-one years of age.
While the whole purpose of the
course is to enable students to adapt
social principles to conditions abroad,'
the school itself will do no foreign
placing.
This year's school is an outgrowth
of schools conducted by the Y. W.
C. A. .in various parts of the coun
try for the training of Polish-born
women for service in Europe. These
women are known as Polish Gray
Samaritans. Already twenty have
been asked for by Mme. Paderewska,
representing the Polish government,
and thev will sail soon for Warsaw.
Miss Elsa Butler of the Y. W. C.
A.'s division on work for foreign
born women, and dean of the school,
says she expects an enrollment this
year that will represtn at least ten
nationalities and possibly more.
The Y. W. C. A. is planning a' lot of
things for the next few weeks which
will keep the girls busy in preparing
the details of the numerous events
which are scheduled to appear.
Next Friday evening theHi-Y boys
and the Hi-Y girls have arranged for
a little outing in the evening at Hy
land park with Miss Greely and Earl
Thompson as chaperons. The party
will consisi of about forty of the young
people who will leave from the Y. W."
C. A. and with' refreshments and danc
ing they plan to have a most enjoy
able time.
Tomorrow night the business girls
of the Y. W. C. A. will entertain the
young business men of ttie'eity with
a dinner at the Y dining room and
later they will adjourn to the Lyric
theatre where seats have been reserv
ed for the party. This affair is being
given as a farewell ' party to Mrs.
Long who has 'been the president of
the girls club and -who is leaving Bis
bee fcr.the east to make her home.
On Saturday evening the" girls from
Tucson who are staying at the Y. W.
C. A. will be entertained by the house
girls with a most interesting program
and everyone predicts some Interest-
ing happenings that night.
On Friday night. July 25th. the girls
club has arranged for a big time in
the form of a" cabaret and dance on
the tennis court. -
Among the many interesting events
on the program for that evening is an
interpretation of the Vernon Castle
dancing by Adgie Kagle and Winston
Travore; an Oriental dance by Tuey
Gill. Lassie Campbell and Francis
Smith. George Downs will put on a
number with a chorus of pretty girls
and Myrtle Threat will entertain with
a Southern rag. A Spanish dance will
be an interesting number by Bertha
O'Jede and a classy rag number will
be put on by Esther Weimar and Mil
dred Smith.
Tables will be distributed around
the court which will be brilliantly
lighted and refreshments will be
served while the program Is in pro
gress. The music will be furnished
by Mrs. Ben Stock and Ray Lindsey.
Miss Renaud will have charge of the
decoration. Miss Lewis is arranging
for the refreshments and Miss Henry
and Miss Stevenso will have charge
of the program. The proceeds will go
to the Girls' Club, and they plan to
make this event even a greater suc
cess than the Carnival which was
given some time ago.
The local Y. W. C. A. Is planning
on a program this year which will
have many interesting features
Among the "drives" to be held this
year is one on better shoes for women
which is being planned by the na
tional headquarters in New York
along the following line:
"Save a Foot!"
This may be the slogan of the new
est drive to be launched throughout
tne Lnited States in the near future
It is a Y. W. C. A. campaign for
"better reet" and it will be known
throughout the country and perhaps
abroad as the Shoe Campaign.
"For five years women's feet have
served all of the big drives of the war
and perhaps it is only fair that they
be pensioned by a drive all their
own." . At least Mrs. Bertha M. P,
Andrews, assistant director of the
physical education department of the
Y. W. C. A., says that there is no
campaign so necessary to the health
of women.
"Women's shoes are as bad as thev
can possibly be," is the contention of
Mrs. Andrews, "and men's shoes are
becoming worse every day. The great
cry 'We can't get a good shoe
the manufacturers do not make them
This is in- a great measure true. It
was with this fact in mind that a
conference of .shoe manufacturers
was held, at the headquarters of the
National Board Y. .W. C. A. last
spring. The problem , was to produce
a low snoe. with a low, flat heel, a
flexible shank that would allow
enough exercise of the muscles .of the
arch to keep them strong and. a shoe
with enough room for the toes and a
straight inner border to fit the foot,
which ' is naturally straight -. on the
inner sida. The shoe was also to be
attractive.
Samples are coming In. to the Y.
W. C. A., but few of 'them, according
to Mrs, Andrews, combine good sense
with beauty of line.
Here are sonje Y. W. C. A. rules
for good feet:
1. Throw away your arch support
ers. 2. Use simple home exercises.
3. Treat your feet as if they were
human.
;4. Wear low shoes all winter. Pro
tect; your ankles with spats when
necessary, but never wear a shoe
high enough to prevent circulation
and use of the foot and ankle' muscles.
5. Don't blame the flat heel shoe
for your broken arch. Blame the
high heel jhoe you wore before.
6. In walking point your toes
straight ahead.

department as Percy. Mr. Page for
the past year and a half has been
assistant boys secretary. He has now
left the Boys' Department and will
spend the summer on the ranch of
his parents at St. David. Many of

loose him. The new assistant boys'
secretary will be John Byrd Salmon.
John is one of the popular boys of the
High School, a football advocate and
one of B. H. S. best. He is well
known and should make good.

boys and those interested should
come.
SPENDING YOUR ; WEEK'S VACA
TION AT THE "Y" CAMP
(By George Franklin Brown)
A week with Earl V. is reallv en
joyable, in spite of all year around
school. And not because he can make
blisters with his towel either, but be
cause he was once a boy and is still a
boys own friend. I might also say,
brother, although he la a big brother
which are more enjoyable than small
brothers, because you must take care
of ihe smaller one while the big ones
take care of you.
Friday night I embarkel -on the
good ship Studebaker laden with bed
ding. We went on a pretty rough
sea, traveling from ten to fifteen
leagues per. hour. ..We arrived safely
at ; port, where assistant cook Mike
met us and showed us the unburied
treasure, the contents of the candy
store. - .
We viewed rather critically the
cook shack and bunks, and after feed
ing on some of the supplies, retired.
But of no use, was this attempt to
retire for I found the graphonola and
kept it going until 1 a. m. Mike final
ly got tired and threatened slaughter
so we went to sleep. About two thir
ty, there was one awful rumpus, and
the V. V. V.'s rolled in, tired, sleppy.
crabby, hungry and noisy. Mike, to
pacify them, got up and made the
bunch some goo, and their stomachs
filled they felt better.
About 10:30 a. m. the whole crew
landed. Their ship was a big Buick,
EVERETT TRUE
and Earl V. Thompson was the head
pirate. AVe separated our packs and
prepared to stay a while. After tents
were pitched, chow was served, and
oh boy, it was good.
Everybody had a tent. Intermedi
ates, V. V. V.'s and all. Oh boy, we
sure started on a week of fun, and
we had it. That night with the ex
ception of a few scares and midnight
chorus by Harry Chain. Somebody
shut them up and after that we sure
had a peace at night.
Of course visitor's day, Wednesday,
was the big day in camp. Earl V.
sure looked natural that day. He
wasn't a bit bashful either. What
did my heart the most good was to
see those mothers lined up just like
we were to get their chow chow
.beans. Oh boy the cake th-y
brought was delicious. Made us ail
a bit homesick. I reckon.
We had Bible study each morning.
It was quite a transformation that
of Earl V.'s from a homely cook to
a good looking teacher. We enjoyed
ourselves immensely the following
days. CampHre every night. Camp
Jazz read, and stunts and singing,
everything to make up real camp life.
We sure hated to come in Saturday,
but perhaps it was better for ns for
we ilidn't get tired of canrp and it
will always be in our memories, this
good time at camp with the good
looking chief. Earl V.. his big 'fet,
and slop a la good grub.
Looking back, for that is all we
can do now, for we do ont know when
we will have another, camp, , this
week's vacation was surt great
There is only one thing that make
me sore, and the-other fellows too,
and that is the fact that this camp
weather must be spent in school.
Of course we're all law abiding citi
zens, but me thinks that the three
months would be better spent in camp.
Oh boy it. hurts to go to school la
camp weather. -

ARIZONA ETHICS AND OATHS
(Western Advertising.)
ACCORDING to the Tucson Citizen, the State Dental Board of
Arizona exacts the following oath from every dentist to
who a license is granted:
"I hereby pledge my solemn oath that I will not advef
tise as a dentist in any capacity and will not associate myself in the
practice of dentistry with' any dentist or firm of dentists or corpora-
tion engaged in performing dental .work or services that does adver
tise under the penalty of the revocation of my license by
the secretary of state of the State of Arizona."
The Citizen raises the question of whether or not It is constitu
tional to exact such a binding obligation upon any profession, ana
hints that the general dental profession of Arizona is attempting to
form a trust which limits the number of practitioners in that state,
and states that the legislature passed a law designed to '"smash the
ring" by throwing open the state to almost any one to practice den
tistry. It is claimed that Governor Campbell vetoed the bill only after
an understanding with the State Dental Hoard by which it was
agreed that in the future the board would be more ethical to would-be
practitioners. There aren't very many people in Arizona now, and
and if the Dental Board is allowed to pursue its ruthless way prob
ably in ten years the number will be even further reduced.
A dentist advertises when he puts his name on his office door.
He advertises when he allows himself to be addressed as "Doctor."
He advertises in making his ofice look attractive. He advertises
when he displays his instruments of torture in a glass case. There
are other ways in which the most ethical of the reactionaries adver
tise without knowing It.
Then there is the most unethical of all advertising not absolute
ly illegal joining clubs and fraternities to get business; also dolling
one's wife up and having her flit from place to place, referring to
her husband's performances as "Doctor did this" and "Doctor did
that" and "Doctor is so busy." It has even been hinted that dentists
on occasion attend church arrayed in fine apparel to attract atten
ttion to themselves and increase their clientage, which, would surely
be advertiseing.
Perhaps all this unethical practice will be abolished by the Den
tal Board of the great state of Arizona.
Is it possible that dentists generally regard it as a crime for one
of their profession (inprint) to urge the public to have their decayed
teeth attended to before it is too late? Is it a heinous crime that
should be punished by imprisonment or worse to advocate the more
extensive use of the toothbrush?
Again, it is advertising when some progressive dentist puts in
an X-ray outfit and allows a newspaper to, mention the fact; even
the presence of an X-ray outfit displayed in an office would be ad
vertising. Probably, though, th-3 Arizona tooth-carpenters do not em
ploy such instruments. If they do, doubtless they fear it will become
generally known, and keep the matter a profound secret. .
Is there something about Arizona dentistry that will not bear
publicity?

"AND GOD TOOK .HIM"
BY THE REV. CHARLES STELZLE
NOCH walked with God.'.'
Daily, in quiet places, wherf they could be aiope
away from the noise and the bustie of tlio crowd.
And one evening Enoch took a longer walk than
usual and God said to him:
"It is late, Enoch, and it's a long way back. You'd better coma
along with me all the way it's nearer to my home than to yours."
And God took him.
It's a beautiful story.
Enoch was an old man. And I guess he was tired. And as the
days advanced he took longer walks with God until he was invited
to "come home," wliere he belonged,
Whatever else this may teach men, it's a picture of the normal
life. As good men grow older their grip on the things of tlio earin
loosens, and their view of heaven widens.
And they come to know God better. " . ' '
And some 'day, as they "walk with God," He will take tnc-m

And "death" loses its sting And the grave its victory. "Death"
Is merely the point of departure for the new life where God is, and

TRIFLING
THIS IS THE only nation in the world where the average fam
ily cn spend five hundred dollars tor a piano, the sole pur
pose of which will be to annoy the neighbors tor tnree or
four years whi!e Susie is growing up; after which time it
will serve, once in a fortnight, for lather to tap out "Over There,"
with the index finger of each hand.
Because we have taken our advantages so carelessly foreigners
call us uneducated.
Abroad the art3 mean something, and only those have expensive
musical instruments who can master them.
The piano is a wonderful instrument, and a lifetime is too short
for the trained, eager student to master it.
But here any miss of sixteen, after six months' casual lessons,
will break a baby grand to ride, make it canter, and fix trot and
pranc; give it the third degree, and make it howl for mercy, all with
out apparent effort; or an under standing of the awtulness of her
crimes.
So, a few years ago, we turned out "artists" by the hundred.
"Painters" of cliina and ' wood, masters of art, who burnt Gibson
head3 with a hot poker on an imitation tennis raqiiet, and gave it to
their beloved for a birthday gift.
Without thought of what was beautiful, or of what was fitting,
or of the real essence of art, we shunted our young onto art sidings
like mere box cars, crammed them with loudi of psettdo artistic
Junk; and forever ruined tnem for any appreciation of the fine things
of life, by making "art" cheap, tawdry and common.
With the gods of the material somewhere dethroned by the spii
itual upheaval of the war, maybe we can take a new lack on this art
ocean, and sail a few ships somewhere besides to t he bottom.
We hrve the native capabilities; witness the triumphs of the na
tion's singers on European operatic stages.
We need teachers that are artists rather than craftsmen, and
students that are earnest and eater, rather than merely dexterous.
Lcnine's method is to help the poor man by teathing him to help
himself to anything he wants.
FULL WEIGHT AND MEASURE
WILL HELP CUT HIGH GQST
Of PIG
BY BIDDY BYE.
In cutting the hih cost of livinp one
of the important points that the con
sumer must insist upon with food, fuel
and textile merchandise is a fair system
of weights and measures.
The I'nited States Bureau of Standards
has established certain standards of
weight, measurement, time, etc., by
which all other measures are guaged
and corrected. In addition each state
determines for itself certain regulations
of weights and measures to govern the
sale of articles within state boundaries.
Luh housewife should familiarize her
self with the regulations in her own
state, should supply herself with a reli
able scale for weighing purchases, and
then keep a careful eye upon her pur
chases to see that dealers are conform
ing to state laws.
Laws differ in each state, but the
standards adopted in Chicago are fair'y
typical. For instance there Is a stand
ard for bread to which all bakers must
conform. A lightweight loaf should le
reported at once to the local depart
ment of weights and measures, or to the
state department that the consumer may
be protected against short weights.
In Chicago a one-pound loaf is the
standard. Kach loaf must have affixed
to it a label, 1 inch square, stating the
weight of the loaf and the name of the
baker or manufacturer. Those selling
bread must weigh it in the presence of
the purchaser if requested to do so.
The standards for milk and cream re
quire that the cover or cap of every bot
tle must bear in indelible letters the
name of the person or firm bottling the
milk and must lie marked with the bot
tlj'e exact capacity.
I'ersona or firms selling ice must sell
it by avoirdupois weight, and it must
be weighed at the time of delivery by
the delivery man on scales adjusted and
sealed by the inspector of weights.
For fuel, the driver or delivery man
must be provided with a ticket bearing
the name of the seller of the fuel, and
marked with the net weight of the fuel
ordered by the purcnaser. If the buyer
so demands the fuel must lie rewelghed
In his presence on a scale designated
by the city inspector of weights and
measuics. ,
All ear corn, potatoes, coal, larga
fruits, vegetables and other bulky arti
cles sold by dry m"isure (quart) peck, or
bushel, shall e sold by heaped measure,
according to the Chicago standards.
Every consumer is required to pay in
full for the goods he purchases and
should require from the merchants full
weight and measure of the goods bought.

TEXAS IS NEXT
IE OIL FIELD
FT. WORTH. Tex.. July 13. Ex
tensive development of the Panhandle
district of Texas by companies ex
ploring for oil has been undertaken.
The significance of these develop
ments is very great as the territory
lies on lines of easy transportation
through the great middlewest, south
east and inter-mountain districts of
the country.
Reports issued by a number of
geologists who . have carefully sur
veyed this territory give rise to hopes
that this district will rival the now
famous Ranger and Burkburnett fields
in production of oil. Early test wells
put down in the Panhandle have
good showing of oil from 3 to 5 sands
at relatively shallow depths.
One of these wells, however, was
carried down to' the level of from
3200 to 4200 feet, where the geologists
say the pay sand lies.
The latest and most forceful en
terprise which has been launched in
this field is that of the Giant Oil Co.
Ft. Worth, Texas. This company,
while launched open and above board
as a wildcat with the full understand
ing of its investors that is was a
gamble and all they put in it was
lost if they failed to get oil, never
theless, has the essential characteris
tics of a real development company.
It has taken over 8500 acres through
the middle of the Panhandle and will
make deep test of these areas.
The Home Peoples Oil Co. is drill
ign near Deep Lake and their well
u lntrirlno- In and loarlin? eeoloeists
and oil men to believe that they will
get a real oil well. Not far distant
from this location the Lelia Lake De
velopment Co. is drilling two wells
between Hedley and Lelia Lake.
Both of these will bo deep tests.
South of the Red River the Childress
Oil & Development Co. is drilling the
Wild Ike, while the Carey Develop
ment Co. of which W. E. Carey is
head, is drilling between Esteline and
Childress.
Considerable drilling activity is
evident southwest of Amarillo about
11 miles. Deep tests are also going
down near Goodnight, north of Clar
endon, and near Claude, the county
seat of Armstrong county.
MEXICO'S OILICT
THE GOVERNMENT REFUSES TO
GRANT PERMITS FOR COM
PANIES TO DRILL
WASHINGTON, July 12. The Mex
ican government has committed an
overt" act of confiscation in prevent
ing American oil well drillers to work
on lands owned by American individ
uals or companies by sending soldiers
into the fields and driving away the
workmen, state department officials
said today.
Complaint was made to the Mexican
government on April 2 of this year,
it was learned, against the refusal of
the government to grant permits to
the oil companies to drill. No. an
swer was received until after the
Juarez incident, it was said, and then
President Carranza announced no per
mits, provisional or otherwise, would
be granted until the companies bad
complied with the law.
Compliance with the laws, it was
said by state department officials,
would constitute recognition by the
companies that the Mexican govern
ment owned the oil lands.

AUSTIN, Texas, July 12. Among
the additional subjects submitted to

the following: .
"The passage of a law requiring the
owners and ope'fators of oil and gas
wells to report to the railroad com
mission of Texas the amount of oil
and gas produced and disposed of with
the price at which sold."
The message would also require all
handling oil and gas to make reports
of their transaction to the railroad
commission. . It then sets out that the
railroad commissioners have not re
ceived a salary increase in twenty-five
years and recommends that their sal
ary be raised from $4,000 to $6,000
a year. Senator Smith ofHenderson
introduced a bill in accordance with
these recommendations.
The Copper Queen offers service an
nuities for men who have been 15

are physically disqualified for active
work. The annuity amounts to 2 per

ORE BODY
The enn mine reports a big strike
on the 1700 foot level said to be one
of the biggest producers in the Bis
bee Warren District.
The Shattuck-Arizona Mining Co.
took over the Denn in 1906 and since
that date has spent considerably over
$4,000,000 in its development and in
prospecting its possibilities. With
the water proposition to contend with
this mine has been a discouraging
deal until the recent strike was made
when their hopes were revived and
it looks now as though the property
would be one of the big producers in
this district.
The water is still a big problem
although it is being handled success
fully at present. Prospecting is going
on at the 1700 foot level, in order to
go any deeper it will be necessary
to install larger pumps as the water
has covered the prospecting work
done on the 1800 foot level, .?
The ore at the 1700 foot, lave! runs
from 6 to 40 er cent copper with
some gold and silver. The ore is
mostly sulphides and oxides with
some culprite deposit of considerable
size, wnne tne size or tne new ore
body has not been determined there
is every indication of an immediate
output of two to three thousand tons
of high grade ore. evelopment
work is being pushed to determine
the size of the new body and what
there is on the 1800 foot level.

DID YOU KNOW THAT
About one quarter of the under
ground employees of the Copper
Queen are returned service men, many
of whom are learning mining for the
first time.
The Inspiration ore- reserves give
that mine a life of sixteen more years
and when that ore is gone, the mil

worth its junking value.
The new high school to be built In
Morenci is to include a four room

also offers facilities for teaching
hygiene and home nursing.
The Old Dominion once nearly fol
lowed the route of the Tombstone
mines, becoming flooded, and it was
only by hard work, twenty four hours
a day and the use of almost every
known-method of removing water,
that the mine was saved from bu

June Production la Lowest Sines No
vemberSix Months' Output Indi
cates 56,000,000 Pounds in Current
Year Company Producing at Ncr
mat. Miami's production in June amount
ed to 4,385865 pounds of copper, a
decrease of 603,715 pounds as com
pared with May output and aproxi
mately 306,000 pounds less than was
reported in June last year. Although
the June showing is the lowest since
last November, the decrease in pro
duction is not a result of the coppei
situation, because Miami has been
and is one of the few producers able
to make money, even with the coppet
market lower than the 19 cents pre
vailing today.
In the first half of the current year
Miami has produced 2S.152.000 pounds
of copper, an average of 4,692,000
pounds per month. In the corres
ponding period of 1918 output amount,
ed to 29. 093,000 pounds a decrease
in the current year Of only 941.000
pounds. The first six months' show,
ing indicates a total in the current
year of 56,304.000 pounds, as against
58,407,000 pounds actually shown in
the full twelve months of 1918. As
evident from the foregoing, there is
no curtailment in effect at the Miami
properties.
Miami's low production cost was the
primary factor for the decision of
the management to continue opera
tions at normal. Last year the copper
cost was 14.833 cents per pound, and
in 1917 it was 12.511 cents. With
copper above 19 cents, Miami is prob
ably showing a profit of four cents
a pound, as it is estimated that in
stead of a higher production cost thai
in 1918. the figure has actually been
lowered in the current year.
Because ot the factt hat Miami has
pulled through the depression of a
demoralized copper situation without
any material reduction in output there
is every reason for believing that
with the copper outlook improving
each week Miami will exceed the rec
ord production of las t year. To
equal the 1918 total an average of
slightly over 5.000,000 pounds must
be shown in each ot the next six
months. The average in 1918 was 5,
757,000 pounds, monthly. .

The tlire Scandinavian rountik-s
Sweden, Norway and Denmark united

That's the lliff of Lars Larsen-Ledet,

advocating a union of the three nations
ever since the war taught them the ne
cessity of close co-operation to keep

The united nation probably would take

Increased and has been Immensely
strengthened by the war.
"Dormisrk and Norway speak practi

as the KnKlish spoken in England arid

a trifle different, but still every Nor

Swedish, and every Swede can under
stand Danish.
"Our civil laws are practically the
same, our customs are the same in
nearly every particular we are one peo
ple. Why rot one large nation instead
of threa small ones?" .
Mr. Lars?n-Ledet believes Finland
would become a member of such a united
state because of the preponderance of
Scandinavian, people in Finland.

Sacramento Hill
Being Removed
The April record of 176,000 cubic
yards for the removal ef Sacramento
Hill of the Copper Queen at Bisbee,
exceeds all previous marks. Up to
date approximately 2,000,000 cubic
yards have been removed, or about
40 per' cent of the total amount to be
moved before sufficient ore will be
uncovered to maintain a steady sup
ply of ore for the new mill.
The work of taking down Sacra
mento Hill is one of the largest min
ing projects of the world; every day
eighty trainloads of dirt and rock are
hauled away to get rid of the waste
which covers this ore body. It is a
task which involves millions of dol
lars, and is only possible by large
operations.
The' work on'the big concentrator
which is to handle the ore from "Sac"
hill was stopped last October because
of the inability to secure machinery
and building materials during the
war, but inasmuch as the mill prog
ress was ahead fcf that of the mine,
the delay in the mill will probably
not delay the output.
The Dallas shaft of the Coppr
Queen is to be enlarged from two
compartments to five, and the Calu
met & Cochise is undergoing devel
opment, being sunk further from the
1500-foot level.
