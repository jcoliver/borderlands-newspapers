WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. Two battleships, one
battle cruiser, 12 scout cruisers, five submarine "flo
tilla leaders" and six submarines are recommended by
the navy general board in a report made public today
in the program to make the navy of the United States
"equal to the most powerful maintained by any other
nation in the world" not 1 ater than 1925.
The Btatement of policy as to the ul
timate strength of the navy and the
;time when it should be achieved Is a
reiteration of the board's position as
carried in its report to Secretary Dan
iels, each year since 1915. Mr. Dan
iels did not himself recommend any
building program, withholding this for
later presentation.
In its recommendations, the general
board urged a policy of naval expan
sion that will guarantee protection of
coast lines and the rapidly expanding
merchant marine against any naval
power in the world. Such protection,
the board declared, can be had only
by increasing American seapower to
a point where it is "second to none"
and maintaining it at that level.
To Prevent War
The board asserted that the war
Jiaving demonstrated that possession
of a fleet powerful enough to protect
its commerce is vital to any nation
in time of hostilities, the mainten
ance of such a navy by the , United
States would be a "great preventative
of war, for no nation would lightly
provoke hostilities ' where her, own
commer.c.e would thereby be imperil'
ed." ;

SMUGGLED GUN
Tony Remic, Italian miner of Low
ell, yesterday threatened " to dig his
own grave and kill himself" before
Deputy Sheriffs Tom Foster, Mert
Oilman and Constable Bohnfalk, of
Lowell.
This morning Remic is lying in the
Calumet and Arizona company hos
pital, where his condition is said to
be critical. He 13 suffering from three
self-inflicted wounds, which Dr. Bled
soe says may be fatal.
Shortly after two o'clock yesterday
afternoon Remic called at the deputy
sheriffs office In Lowell and asked
that he be provided a pick and shov
el and two men to assist him to dig
his grave. Deputy Sheriff Foster pro
tested, explained that Remic was
not dead yet and should not be wor
rying about his grave.
Remic was insistent and threaten
ed he would shoot himself.
"I have a gun at home and when
my grave is dug I will kill myself, so
that I may be put in the ground
where I belong," he said.
Deputy Sheriffs Foster, Gilman and
Constable Bohnfalk immediately took
lltriuit; uiiu tusLuu; jwli iiio .nicta
tion to bring him yesterday afternoon
to Tombstone, where an examination
to test his sanity would be made.
Coming to BIsbee with Remic, pre-
paratory to bringing him to the coun-
ty seat, the officers brought their
prisoner to the city jail, where he
was locked up temporarily.
Shoitly after four o clock, Chief or
Police Kempton went into the cells

TO" DEFEND
the American navy, therefore, must
depend, the board said, upon the naval
Btrength of the power in a position to
challenge our legitimate commercial
expansion upon the high seas.
The board asserted it already was
evident that first line ships of the
American navy mu6t have heavier ar
mament than the 12-inch guns of the
first dreadnaughts. These sbips, the
board said, were rapidly assuming
the same relationship to the navy's
superdreadnaughts that the older bat
tleships bear to the first dreadnaughts
themselves, with the time approaching
when they can no longer be consider
ed as effective first line ships.
Want SupershTpa
The board recommended ' the con
struction of ten scout cruisers, cited
the value of such craft to the British
fleet during, the war and declared
them to be essential to "any-well bal
anced navy." Recommending con
struction of five ships of the super
destroyer type, the board emphasized
the usefulness of such ships.
For development and construction
of aircraft during the year the board
recommended an appropriation of
$27,000,000 with $6,000,000 to be used
for experimental construction. .

AWAIT LEGISLATION
WASHINGTON, Dec. 9. Given an
renewed opportunity by restoration of
the measure to the committee of the
whole, senate critics of the Cummins
railroad bill today launched a new
and heated attack on various provi
sions of the legislation designed to
meet conditions incident to the forth
coming return of the railroad prop
erties. Senators LaFollette, Republican of
Wisconsin, and Dial, Democrat, South
Carolina, led the renewd attack and
their discussion of the bill occupied
virtually the entire session. The re
sult at adjournment was that the
measure was no nearer passag. Lead
ers, however, expressed hope tonight
that, final vote would be reached be
fore the end of the week.

During the debate today Republican
leaders of the senate and house con
ferred regarding holiday recess plans
and leaders of the lower branch were
assured that there is every prospect
pf having the railroad legislation sent
to conference before the holiday re
cess planned to begins December 20.
Final enactment of t1 legislation is
not probable until af$er congress re
convenes next; Jjionth.: Confidence was
expressed biheconf reees, liowever,
that President -Wilson would await

Senator LaFollette urged a five
year extension of government control
and charged that the pending meas
ure was virtually for the benefit of
the railroads.

as outlined in the recent sharp note
to Mexico renewing the request for
Jenkins' release.
No reply to that note has been re

ber of filled-in coupons mailed or turned in to the political editor of the
Review.
Senator Hiram Johnson of California and General Leonard Wood con

Wood took a sudden spurt In the ballots received yesterday by the political
editor, and at 5 o'clock last evening was only one vote behind Senator John

W. G. McAdoo continues to lead the Democratic race, closely pressed
by President Wilapn. The Democratic coupons received total only one third
those of the Republican, and unless the Democratic voters of the district
get busy during the remainder of the week, the district will go on record
as overwhelmingly Republican.
Interest in the coming Democratic convention hat been lessened some
what by the uncertainty as to whether President Wilson will make the race.
Many followers of President Wilson in the district are chary of expretsing"
a preference for any other Democratic leader until they are certain that
Mr. Wilson will not run... A considerable number, however, are turning in
coupons to the Review expressing Mr. Wilson at they choice, Irrespective
of the improbabability of his making the 1920 race.
Fill in the coupon below with the name of your favorite, and addrett It
to "Political Editor, Bisbee Daily Review." Namet are required to be signed
to the coupons so as to validate the count and prevent "ballot-stuffing," but

DEAR TED:
I was glad to hear that you were
to be confirmed.
Secretary Rootneft on Monday and
Governor Taft took his place. I have
missed and shall mips Root dreadfully.
11a has been the ablest, most gener
ous and most -disinterested friend and
adviser that any president could hope
to have; and immediately after leav
ing he rendered me a great service by
a speech at the Uiioi League Club, in
which he said in most effective
fashion the very things I should have
liked him to say; and his words,
moreover, carried weight as the
words of no other man at this' time
addressing such an audience could

have done. Taft is a splendid fellow
and will be an aid and comfort in
every way. But, as mother says, he
is too much like me to be able to
give me as good advise as Mr. Root
was able to do because of the very
difference of character between us.
If after fully thinking the matter
over you remain firmly convinced
that you want to go into the army,
well and good. I shall be rather sor
ry for your decision, because I have
great confidence in you and I believe
that in civil life you could .probably
win in the end a greater prize than
will be open to you if you go into the
army though, of course, a man can
do well in the army. I know perfect
ly well that you will have hard times
in civil life. Probably most young
fellows when they have graduated
from college, or from their post
graduate course, if they take any, feet
pretty dismal for the first few years.
In ordinary cases it at first seems as
if they efforts were" not leading any
where, as if the pressure around the
foot of the ladder was too great to
permit , of getting up your energy,
your perseverance, your ability, and
your power to force yourself to the
front when you have once found out
and taken your line. However, you
and I and mother will talk the whole
matter over, when you come back
here on Easter.

strength.
Buffalo Bill was at lunch the other
day, together with John Wills, my
old hunter. Buffalo Bill has always
been a freat friend of mine. I remem

when the Wild West show was there,
fie got upon the rear platform of my
car and made a brief speech on my
behalf, ending with the statement
"a cyclone from the west had come;
no wonder the rats hunted their cel
lars" -
As for you, I thing the West Point
education is, of course, good for any
man, but I thill think that you have
too much in your for me to be glad
to see you go into the -army, where
in time of peace progress is so much
a matter of routine.
Senator Hanna's Death.

DEAR TED:
Poor Hanna's death, was a tragedy.
At the end he wrote me a note, the
last he ever wrote, which showed him
at his best, and which I much ap
preciate. His death was very sad for
his family and close friends, for he
had many large and generous traits,;
and had made a great success in life j
Irritating Remark by Quentin.
White House, Feb. 27, 1904.
DEAR KERMIT:
Mother went off for three days to
New York and Mame and Quentin
took immediate advantage of her ab
sence to fall sick. Quentin's sickness
was surely due to a riot in candy and
ice cream with chocolate sauce. He
was a very sad bunny next morning
and spent a couple of-days in bed.
Ethel, as always, was a good -as gold
both to him and to Archie, and large
ly relieved me of my duties as vice
mother. I got up each morning in
time to breakfast with Ethel and
Achie before they started for school,
and I read a certain amount to Quen
tin. but this was about all. I think
Archie escaped with a minimum of
washing for the three days. One day
I asked him before Quentin how often
he washed his face, 'whereupon Quen

Famo Does Stop Seborrhea
The Dandruff Disease
If you have dandruff, you have
Seborrhea.
Zi you have Seborrhea, you will
hr.ve falling hair and itching scalp
and finally if the seborrhea reaches
the aebaceous (land baldness.
If you use Famo you can kill the
bacilli that cause the Seborrhea.
If it Is falling out your heir is fight
ing for its life. '
Seborrhea Kills Hair
As fast as nature grows new hair
th Seborrhea germ kills it off.
Unless you kill the germ with Famo,
l:c new hair will grow weaker and
weaker, and finally fail altogether.
Seborrhea attacks the hair like
Pyorrhea attacks the teeth.
7amo is a formula worked out by
one of the recognized pharmaceu
tical laboratories in Detroit.
These Detroit laboratories supply
ninety per cent of all the physicians
and pharmacists in America.
Ia one of them, after three yt.ars
work, skilled chemists found Famo.
Scientists now know that Seborrhea
causes falling hair, and finally bald
ness. These Detroit chemists say
that Famo kills Seborrhea.
They say it will not only save hair,
but grow it beautiful, luxuriant
hair.
In Famo these chemists have com
bined ingredients they have supplied
thousands of times to physicians.
Famo Revolutionary
Never before was this wonder-working
formula applied to the growth
of the hair. Famo is revolutionary,
and works revolutionary results.
Not a drop of alcohol is used in its
preparation an unheard of thing.
Famo chemists said, "Alcohol hurts
the hair and hastens grayness. We
will find' other ways to hold it
together." They succeeded.
Famo Stops Itching
Famo gives to the hair new lustre
and intensifies the naturcl color of
the hair. You will note the beneficial
results from the first application.
The dandruff scale is dissolved and
disappears.
Famo penetrates the scalp and gives
health to the roots of the hair.
It
It stops all itching of the scalp.
Every member of the family should
use it. Even if you do not have
dandruff Famo will make the hair
more healthy and beautiful.
Famo is sold at all toilet goods
counters. Applications may be had
ct the better barber shops.
It comes in two sizes a email size
at 35 cents and an extra large bottle
ct $1.00. Your money will be re
turned if you are not satisfied.
Seborrhea is the -medical name
for a morbidly increased flow
from the sebaceous glends cf
the scalp. The seborrhean excrc-
tion forma in scales or flakes
and is commonly known cs

Japanese Wrestling.
White House, March 5, 1904.
DEAR KERMIT:
I am wrestling with two Japanese
wrestlers three times a week. I am
not the age or the build one would
think to be whirled lightly over an
opponent's head and batted down on
a mattress without damage. But they
are so skillful that I have not been
hurt at all. My throat is a little sore,
because once when one of them had
a strangle hold I also got hold of his
windpipe and thought I could perhaps
choke him off before he could choke
me. However, he got ahead.
i
White House, April 9, 1904.
DEAR TED:
I am glod I have been doiig this
Japanese wrestling, but when I am
through with it this time I am not
at all sure I shall ever try it again
while I am bo busy with other work
as I am now. Often by the time I
get to five o'clock in the afternoon I
will be feeling like a stewed owl,
after an eight hours grapple with
senators, congressmen, etc.; then I
find the wrestling a trifle too vehe
ment for mere rest. . My right ankle
and my left wrist and one thumb and
both great toes are swollen sufficient
to more or less impair their useful
ness, and I am well mottled with
bruises elsewhere. Still I have made
good progress, and since you left they
have taught me three new throws
that are perfect corkers. ,

Love for the White House
White House, May 28, 1904.
I am having a reasonable amount
of work and rather more than a rea
sonable amount of worry. But, after
all, life is lovely here. The country
is beautiful, and I do not think that
any two people ever got more enjoy
ment out of the White House than
mother and L We love the house it
self, without and within, for its as
sociations; for its stillness and its
simplicity. We love the garden. And
we like Washington. We almost al
ways take our breakfast on the south
portico now. Mother looking very
pretty and dainty in her summer
dresses. Then we stroll about the
garden for fifteei or twenty minutes,
looking at the flowers and the foun
tain and admiring the trees. Then I
work 'until between four and five,
usually having some official people to
lunch now a couple of senators, now
a couple of ambassadors, now a liter
ary man, now a capitalist or a labor
leader, or a scientist, or a big-game
hunter. If mother wants to ride, we
then spend a couple of hours on
horseback. We had a lovely ride up
on the Virginia shore since I came
back and yesterday went up Rock
Creek and swung back home by the

purpose is thorough, providing for fair price committees in every lo
cality in the state, working in conjunction with the representatives
of the law to ferret out and punish profiteers. The best part of the
war on unjust profits is perhaps the penalty provided. This includes
a fine of ?5,000 or two years in the penitentiary, or both. With the
big majority of merchants in Arizona conducting themselves honest
ly and distaining to gouge the private citizen's purse in the present
period of industrial unrest, two years in the penitentiary is none
too stiff a sentence for the few greedy and unscrupulous profit hogs
who endanger the fair name of their state of Arizona. It is to be
hoped th.?t the Phoenix fair price meeting will soon bring concrete
results.
TRYING THE PUBLIC PATIENCE
THE big body of citizens throughout the nation havje borne the
coal strike with something like indifference so far, owing to the
fact that, except in actual centers of peoduction, its ill effects
have, not been heavily felt by the public at large. But now the
strike is to be brought home to every citizen in the country, through
the. drastic order of Fuel Administrator Garfield, resuming the war
time fuel restrictions the "lightless nights", and other disagreeable
features. The people bore these drawbacks cheerfully during the war
when the spirit of noble sacrifice in a lofty Cause was the stimulus.
Will the people make the same sacrifice uncomplainingly for the sake
of a comparatively small group of men who are dissatisfied with
working conditions? "Midwest faces blizzard with coal bins low"
says a headline. And now comes the Garfield order, affecting all alike,
whether facing blizzards, or an actual coal shortage, or not. The pub
lic is due to sit up and take notice of the coal strike from now on.
GERMANY RECALCITRANT
THE time for the final showdown with Germany has come. The
attention of the United States has been so diverted to the
League of Nations fiasco in the senate of late that the nation
has ra'her lost sight of of the German situation. The latest dis
patches from Paris now reveal Germany, a year or more after her
acknowledgment of defeat through signing of the allied armistice
terms, in an openly defiant, impenitent mcod, refusing to sign the
protocol by which it is intended to enforce the terms of the peace
treaty. In other words, an unchastened Germany has ho intentions of
living up to those terms to which she pledged her word, if she can
possibly dodge the issue; and she is using every subterfuge in her
efforts to dodge. The last note of the allies, gratifying to observe,
warns Germany "for the last time", and assures her that the allies
are ready for military action. This is as it should be. The time for
a final, conclusive show-down with beaten but unhumblcd Germany
has come.
THE REAL MALADY OF THE PARLOR
BOLSHEVIKI
LENINE'S statement at one of the soviet conferences, that among
ono hundred so-called Bolsheviki here is one real Bol.Vnevik,
thirty-nine criminals and sixty fools, was made, we suppose, as
to Russia. How the proportions run in America there are no
really authentic figures to show, but John Spargo, who has made
some study of the subject, leaves no doubt with us, in an examination
he makes of the propaganda in this country in the World's Work,
that we have our full share of each.
The real BoIsheTik ar.d the criminal. are hot difficult to a'c
tount lor. It is the fools who puzzle. They believe themselves unin
tellectuals and liberals, but are guided not by their reason, but by
their emotions. Anything in America thai seems to be undemocratic
in the operation of the government, such as the suppression of in
flammatory rpoech, brings their unmeasured condemnation, but the
tyranny, brutality and injustice exercised by the soviet government
in Russia meets their tenderest indulgence.
Mf. Spargo finds that this type of parlor Bolshevik has been the
eager dupe of ovorv "ism" lha.. has come up in recent years. Com
munism. Marxism, syndicalism, feminism and in art cubism al) have
hailed in their turn, made fashionable,, endowed by those peisens of
wealth who want to be considered patrons of genius, and havi reign
ed their hour Pobhevtsm now seems to be the professor of all with
this lunatic fringe. It's "intellectuals" in this country ignorantly ac
cept it as something new in idealism, whereas it is neither new or
idealistic. Its eyes are shut to its operation in Russia where it is the
nioiit oppressive tyranny ever felt by a people, but their oars are wide
open (and wagging, beins or that type) to the entrancing music of
its theorists, who are quite lions at 'intellectual" tei.s with their
foreign whiskers and waving cigarettes.
Mr. Spargo's scientific groupings of these types nntlcr the names
which the various forms of their hypaesthesia seem to indicate may
be accurate, bnt probably is over elaborate. They may be suffering
fiom psycho-this or psycho-that, but mainly they aro suffering trom

"I AM FIRMLY CONVINCED THAT ILLINOIS OR

THE EASTERN ELEVENS."
SAYS EXFERT
"HARLEY WAS BEYOND ANY QUESTION THE
GREATEST ALL AROUND PLAYER OF THE YEAR,
EAST OR WEST, NORTH OR SOUTH."
BY E. C. PATTERS6N
The western conference has ended
the most interesting and most dra
matic football season in its history' a
season that opened with thrills and
that ended with as thrilling a finish
as the game could furnish. For Illi
nois finally won out from Ohio State
in the final championship test as a
great ract horse might win a stake
event, jumping into the lead by half a
head just two lengths from the wire.
There was tragedy in the fact that
fthe great Harley had to end his career
with a defeat, but after all Illinois
playing the harder schedule, justly de
served her triumph.
, It would be harder to find teams
, better matched than Illinois, Ohio
State, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Chicago
and Iowa.
No small part of the credit for this
-most interesting of all seasons must
go to such coaches as Zuppke of Illon
nois, Wilce of Ohio State, Howard
Jones of Iowa, Richards of Wisconsin,
Dr. Williams of Minnesota and Stagg
of Chicago.
I am firmly convinced that Illinois
and Ohio State could have beaten the
best of th eeastern elevens. In the
combination of old style line plunging,
field work, and forward passing these
ewo elevens were superior. Indiana,
lor example, was far below the confer
ence average. Minnesota had beaten
this eleven 20 to 6 and had beaten this
eleven 20 to 6 and even Northwestern
with Its crippled team had turned the
trlckj Yet Indiana won from Syra
cuse, Jrated by many as the strongest
eleven in the east. It would be im
possible to imagine Indiana beating
either Ohio State or Illinois.
It is true that Kutgers defeaeted
Northwestern. Vet, Chicago, well
down the list, had already beaten
Northwestern 41 to 0 and even Michi
gan had beaten her, the only confer
ence victory that Michigan gained.
Harley was beyond any question the
greatest all around player of the year,
east or west, north or south.
There were at least four fine ends
on conference terms. They were

WHAT FATTERSON
THINKS OF HARLEY
Only consider this star's equipment.
He was a wonderful broken field run-!
ner, one of the greatest of all time, j
He had rare speed, a baffling change i
of pace, an elusive side step, a strong
straight arm, and a sudden twist wnen
encountering a tackier.
He was also an exceptionally fine
punter, one of the best in the country, i
He had no superior at accurate pass- j
ing, having the ability to throw a foot
ball straight and true to some waiting
teammate.
He was a fine drop kicker, a sharp,
clean line bucker and a s:ar upon de
fense. The season has shown other famous
ftars, but only one Harley only one
man who could dodge, buck, punt,
pass, drop kick and tackle. Harley
was to western football what Eddie
Mahan of Harvard was to eastern foot
ball, except that Harley was a better
drop kicker.
It will be a long time before the
game sees his equal for al laround bril
liant play.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW,
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Dec. 9. The more om
inous developments in the coal short
age a 12 per cent rate for call money
aud further crumbling of international
exchange caused another reaction of
prices on the stock market today.
From the various industrial and
railroad centers came further advices
telling of the paralyzing effects of the
fuel restrictions, these in number of
instances resulting in complete sus
pension of business.
The 12 per cent money rate came
in final dealings, following an opening
quotation of 7 per cent. In banking
circles the flurry was regarded as a
temporary affair.
Rails reflected support at intervals
but eased with the general list later,
their moderate, reaction' fcelng accom
panied by the publication of Beveral
adverse statements of earnings.
Sugars and some of the distinctive
food issues were steady to firm most
of the time and United States offered
occasional resistance to pressure, al
though tomorrow's statement of iso-
vember tonnage is not expected to
throw much light on existing indus
trial conditions. Sales amounted to
1,000.000 shares.
Bonds were heavy on the lower
trend of speculative rails, the Liberty
and Victory issues also easing slight
ly. Total sales, par value, J26.850.000.
Old United States were unchanged on
call.

'" Back Bad Today?
Backache is usually kidney ache
and makes you dull, nervous and tired.
Use Doan's Kidney Pina tor weak kid
neys the remedy recommended by
your friends and neighbors.
- Chas. Rendleman, miner, 158 Opera
Drive, Bisbee, says: "Many years ago
my kidneys were in an awful shape.
I could hardly move my back was so
lame and stiff. Hy kidneys were
weak and acted irregularly. The kid
ney secretions were highly colored and
I had to get up often at night to pass
them. When I tried to bend over,
sharp pains would dart through my
back and I would- become dizzy. A
friend told me about Doan's Kidney
Pills and I tiled them. Two boxes of
Doan's completely cured me. Since
then I have used a few of Doan's
Kidney Pills occasionally and they
have kept my kidneys well and
strong."
Price 60c, at all dealers. Don't
simply ask for a kidney remedy get
Doan's Kidney Pills the same that

The Green
Nancy and Nick, the twins, -rushed off to the chestnut,
tree as soon as the dew was dry on the grass. They were
anxious to see the magical mushroom again, and find out
what it meant by talking on green shoes.
Sure enough there it was tucked away safely behind the
stone where they had left it, and beside it were two pairs of
the queerest little green shoes you can imagine.
"Good morning, children I" said the mushroom. "I'm
,glad you came early. Now
what I'm going to tell you.
: "I have an idea that it isn't
monkey of yours. It may take
"Good Morning, children,"
you came so early.
things a little easier for you I'm going to be sort of a fairy
godmother. Now to begin,- suppose you try on those green
shoes and see if they fit."
Nancy and Nick slipped off their sandals and put on the
funny shoes. They couldn t have fit better if the store man
himself had tried them on.
"That's splendid! said the mushroom after the twins
had stamped around awhile. "Now Nancy, suppose you
pick me up and put me in your pocket. There! That's the
way!
And although the mushroom could not be seen any
more its voice was as 'clear as ever to the children's great
surprise. -
"As long as you are careful of me," it went on, "you
can understand what everything says, animals, trees, flow
ers, toys, everything in the world. And when you have
your green shoes on you can go anywhere you wish or be
any size you choose. But I can't tell you where to go. You
must choose' your own way of hunting Jocko."
"Hadn t we better be starting now?'

"This was my condition ana 1 might
have still been in this shape now if it
hadn't been Igor a frifiid who recom
mended Tanlac to me so highly that I
decided to try it at once. It seems too
good to be true that after all these
years I finally found a medicine that
can do what Tanlac has done for me.
Why, I never have the sign of a pain
now and no matter what I eat I digest
it perfectly and donl' suffer from gas
or from pains in my stomach. Those
dizzy speels never come on me and
I'm not constipated and sleep like a
log every night and get up feeling
like a young man. Tanlac is the fin
est medicine I ever heard of and it
was a lucky day for me wnen my
friend told me about it and you can
count on me to pass the good word
along whenever I get the chance."

"Acute indigestion bothered me

I was afraid to eat anything because
it always caused me awful suffering.
Gas would form on my stomach and I
would feel as tight as a drum and I
would get so short of breath I thought
every minute would be my last one.
I was so constipated that I had to take
a laxative every night, and at times
I would get so dizzy I couldn't walk
and would have to lean up against

over and I came to myself. I never
