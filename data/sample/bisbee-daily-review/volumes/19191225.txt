Express Companies Will Be

RELIEF BILL STILL
BEFORE CONFERENCE
Huge Deficit of $646,000,000
From Government Opera
tion Must Be Faced
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24. President
Wilson tonight issued a proclamation
returning the railroads and express
companies to private control March 1.
Failure of congress to enact reme
dial legislation was given as the rea
son for extending by two months the
time originally announced for- return
ing government control of the rail
road properties. In his message to
congress last May President Wilson
said the roads would be turned back
at the end of the calendar year. ,
"No agreement having yet been
reached by congress," Secretary Tum
ulty said in announcing the proclama
tion, "It becomes necessary in th
public interest to allow a reasonable
time to elapse between the issuing of
the proclamation and the date of its
r.ctually taking effect."
Bill in Conference
The Esch-Cummins bill designed to
meet conditions incident to the return
of the roads now is in conference,
with the prospect that an agreement
on differences between the house and
senate will be threshed out before
March 1.
Face Big Problems
Inasmuch as the stafis or the vari
ous systems have been retained vir
tually intact by the railroad adminis
tration, the return of the roads tc pri
vate control will involve legal and
financial rather than operating ques
tions. (Continued From Page Fire)

Measure Passes
ALBUQUERQUE. N. M., Dec. 24.
That the country is facing the great
est strike evr known if a railroad
bill containing an anti-strike clause
is parsed, was the statement made
today by W. S. Patterson, secretary
treasurer of the International associa
tion of Machinists on the Santa Fe
system. A secret vote was recently
taken among six of the leading shop
crafts on all railroads under federal
control and the decision was almost
unanimous to strike in case congress
deprives the men of this weapon to
erfforce their demands.
Union men say that under no cir
cumstances will they agree to any
compromise looking toward the sac
rifice of their right to strike in cp.se
such action becomes necessary,
whether it is the result of the pass
age of the Cummins bill, the Esch bill
or any other oil'.

Twenty-Five Murders Record
of Criminals Who Employ
Women Decoys
NEW YORK, Dec. 24 Murders and
robberies committed in Lemans by
gangs of American and French sol
diers, using women as decoys, were
described today by Major George
Armstrong of Detroit, who served as
assistant provost marshal in the
American troop area.
Major Armstrong was called by the
defense as a witness at the court
martial of Capt. Karl W. Detzer of the
308th military police company, who is
charged with cruelty to prisoners
while directing criminal investigation
work in Lemans.
Major Armstrong testified that he
had direct charge of 200 military po
licemen in Lemans from August, 1918,
until January, 1919, and that during
this period 1,500,000 Americans passed
through the area.
A large lawless element was at
work, he said, and .while he was in
Lemans 25 murders were committed
and chateaux robbed of thousands of
dollars' worth of furnishings. The
thugs, he said, were known as the
"river gang," "chateau gang," ' jewel
ry rang" and oJier designations denot
ing their "specialty."
All the thugs, he said, were arrest
ed by the military police and are now
serving sentences of two to 15 years.
Notwithstanding the character of the
men with whom they had to deal, he
said, all M. P.'s in the area were or
dered not to strike prisoners except in
self-defense.
Elihu Root Files Bill That
Asserts Prohibition Law Is
Unconstitutional
TRENTON. N. J., Dec. 24. Another
legal attack on prohibition was
launched today when Elihu Root, as
chief counsel for a brewering corpora
tion, filed a bill of complaint in the
United States district court asking for
an injunction restraining United
States District Attorney Bodine and
Charles Duffy, collector of internal
revenue, from enforcing the prohibi
tion law. The bill declares that both
the Volstead act and the eighteenth
amendment are unconstitutional.
The attack on the 18th amendment
amendment- Is based on the ground
that it deals with a subject outside
any power granted to congress. Is a
violation of the 10th amendment in
regarding to states' rights and Is, in
fact, not an amendment to the consti
tution but "mere legislation."

FOOD IN PLENTY
FOR ALL EUROPE
General Bliss Advises Plan
for Handling Necessities
Under One Man
WOULD AID GERMANY
TO SETTLE UNREST
No Fear of. Revival of the
Central Powers as Menace,
Says Officer
WASHINGTON, Dec. 24. The fate
of Europe is so closely interwoven
with that of Germany that the other
European nations should lend her
every assistance in the organization
and maintenance of a stable govern
ment, General Tasker H. Bliss, Amer
ican representative on the supreme
war council, said today.
Present unrest in Europe is due
almost entirely to unfavorable econ
omic conditions, General Bliss said,
but this could be rapidly and wholly
corrected if all Europe combined re
sources. General Bliss urged the pooling of
necessities and raw materials undei
one man who would be designed "di
rector general of supplies," and who
would have associated with him a
"director general of distribution" to
see that supplies were apportioned
where most urgently needed.
Declaring that food production in
Europe this year would be from 80
to 83 per cent or normal, General
Bliss expressed the conviction that
there would be enough for all if prop
erly distributed and there was no rea
son for famine in any part of Europe.
General Bliss said the fear of a
revival of German militarism had
been greatly exaggerated; that the
German army and munition facilities
were so reduced as to make her come
back as a combatant hopeless.
With Germany excluded from the
economic coalition, he declared, there
would -be an element of discontent
which would inevitably react on the
other countries. i

EXPECT NEW ARIONAZA
MILITARY COMMANDER
DOUGLAS. Dec. 24. Maj. Gen. Ed
ward M. Lewis, recently assigned to
the command of the Arizona military
district, is expected to arrive in "Doug
las by the end of the week to assume
his new post. He has been in com
mand ot Camp Gordon, at Atlanta, Ga.,
but relinquished command there De
cember 18, following his appointment
to this district. It is presumed he is
now at San Antonio, as he was to re
port to the headquarters of the .South
ern department before leaving for
Douglas.
General Lewis belongs to the in
fantry branch of the service and saw
extended service jn France. , For a
considerable time he was in com
mand of the district of Paris and
later was placed in command of one
of the sectors held by th3 American
army. He is an old friencr of Col.
Guy Preston, commander at Camp
Jones, who also saw service in France
and who held the temporary rank of
brigadier general. Colonel Preston is
anticipating the arrival of General
Lewis with much pleasure. The gen
eral has the reputation of being popu
lar with both officers and men.
The arrival of General Lewis will
mark the first time that the Arizona
district has been commanded' by a
major general since, the departure of
Maj. Gen. De Ros.y C. Cabell, more
than -a year ago. and citizens hope that
the. assignment of a major general
to .this district means that more
troops are to be stationed here.

Old Timers of Sisbee
IV J. C. KRIGBAUM Continued
This is the fourth of a series of
articles on the "Old-Timers" of Bis
bee and the Warren District, which
are appearing daily in the Review.
The story in this issue deals largely
with one of the most sensational rob
bery, murder and lynching episodes
in the history of Arizona. -Ed.)
Delaney went into Mexico. He drift
ed into Minaa Prietas, where notice of,
the robbery had circulated, and he waa
recognized frwm the printed descrip
tion. He was arrested and held for
the authorities of Cochise county. Dan
Dowd went into Chihuahua, with Dep
uty Sheriff Billy Daniels in prusit.
Daniels trailed him through the Chir
icahua mountains, aided by Heith,
leader of the gang. Heith was lunsus
pected and had gone so far as to be
accepte as guide In the pursuit of
Dowd. When, however, he declared
that the robbers had gone into Tomb
stone, Daniels became suspicious and
continued on the search alone. In the
mountains he came across a French
man, Pardee, who had heard the gang
planning the robbery and who declar
ed that Heith was the leader and
guiding spirit of the outfit. Dariels
sent word back immediately to arrest
Heith, while he continued on into
Chihuahua.
He found Dowd in the mess house
of a large mining company, and after
the superintendent had been informed
of the presence of Dowd and why the
American authorities wanted him, he
placed the robber in . custody. With
the assistance of the railroad men
Iowd was smuggled into a baggage
car and taken into El Paso, where the
first news in many days of Daniels
was sent into Bisbee in the laconic
telegraph message:
"Send me J100. I have Dowd."
Kelly was captured in Deming, N.
M where he was recognized by a bar
ber who was shaving him and who
gave the information to a deputy sher
iff. This brought all of the gang into
the hands of law. The robbers were
placed in the jail at Tombstone to
await trial, and in the court proceed
ings the greatest interest was mani
fest throughout the county, while the
verdict of the Jury in the case of
Heith was to result in his lynching.
In charging the jury Judge Penny
declared that Heith, as instigator of
the robbery and the consequent mur
ders, was to be considered . as guilty
as any of those who actually killed
the four in Bisbee. The jury, however,
brought in a verdict of murder in the
second degree, and Heith was sen-'
tenced for life. When the verdict of
the Jury became known, the people of
Tombstone were thunderstruck, espe
cially after Judge Penny's charge to
the jurymen. At 8 o'clock in the morn
ing, therefore, they went to the jail jn
a body, secured the keys, and took
Heith out. He was cool and collected,
and requested only that no shots be
fired into his body. He was hanged to
a telegraph pole, after he had tied a
handkerchief'around his eyes with his
own hands.
Following the hanging or Heith,
Kelly wrote a set of verses concerning
the death of his leader. Because of
the fact that the author was under the
sentence of death at the time he
penned the doggerel, the verses were
given a wide , circulation, but have
rarely appeared in print and are given
in the Review now for the first time.
The copy is in the possession of H. M.
Woods, now residing on School hill,
who was a resident of Tombstone
when Heith was hung. The verses
follow: 1
As I awake this morning at eight
I heard a knock at the outside gate.
The jailer went to open the door,
And there beheld a hundred or more.
Krigbaum came to Ward's relief,
And the jailer left on account of his
. belief.
The stranglers came to have some fun.
They roped John Heith and away they
run.
The mob went out four by four.
And met the sheriff at the door.
They gave a howl and then a roar.
And throwed theold man on the floor
Henry Solan, brave and true,
Entered the door to cee what he could
do.
But he found it was of no avail, -For
the mob had taken Heith from
jail.
They went down Toughnut, crossed
the main,
And then came . back to Toughnut
I again.
I They marched Heith down to near the
bend
And there they said the fun would end.
Tht valian Heith for nerve he had no
lack,
He told the mob he had one request to
make.
Said he: '"My boys when I am dead,
Don't pierce my body with your lead."
They, placed brave Heith beneath the
wire,
And pulled him up six feet or higher.
The way he died it was a shame.
But Sheriff Ward was not to blame. '

(By the condemned Mick (Kelly).-
FoUowing the hanging of Heith a
coroners' iuquest was held, with Dr.
O. W. Goodfellow making the examina
tion of Heith's remains. (The verdict
returned by this jury is declared to
be a classic among documents of its
sort and is presented here also for the
first time. It follows in full:
"We, the jury, find that Heith came
to his death from erophfsema caused
by strangulation ,a disease common in
high altitudes, which might have been
self Inflicted or otherwise."
Emphysema, it may be remarked, is
a distention caused by air or other
gases, and is attendant upon hanging.
The other five were hanged in
Tombstone on March 2$ 1884, all of
them going to their deaths without a
tremor.
Krigbaum was also present when a
Mexican was lynched in Bisbee soon
afterwards for shooting up a gambling
house, and resulted in the beginnnig
of ihe Bisbee public library. It seems
that Ben Williams, superintendent for
the company, was bringing a member
of the company into camp. Ae he and
his guest, fresh from the east, swung
into Bisbee, they came upon the body
of the Mexican hanging from the limb
of a tree near the road. Tne eastern
er, it is said, left the camp the next
day, and upon his arrival in New
York, sent out a number of books, the
influence of which he thought might
keep the peopl eof Bisbee from taking
the law into their honds in such a
thorough but startling manner m the
future.
Krigbaum also recounts the Indian
scares that came to Bisbee, the death
of Billy Daniels, killed by Indians
between here and Douglas; the activi
ties of the Erp gang in Tombstone,
and all the incidents, amusing, tragic
or unique, that distinguished the early
history of Bisbee. He is living with
his wife and one son, Theodore, in
Tombstone Canyan, while another son,
Fred Krigabaum, and a daughter, Mrs.
Olive Beckner, are living in San
Francisco.

THOUGHTS FOR THE DAY
"Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the newborn King;
Peace on earth and mercy mild,
God and sinners reconciled."
Charles Wesley.
"Without the door let sorrow lie,
And if for. cold it hap to die.
We'll bury't in a Christmas pie.
And evermore be merry."
G. Wither.
THE ETERNAL CHRISTMAS MESSAGE
CHRISTMAS is the most universally celebrated birthday in the
world; the birthday of the Peasant-Carpenter of Nazareth, the
S;!ir?nie Teacher of the race, who at the age of 30 laid aside
tht .ools of His trade and went forth to proclaim the most
revolutionary program of history."
This pros-am He called the "KINGDOM OF GOD," the full real
ization of which will break the power of the world's oppessors both
economic and religious. For His Tearless proclamation of Kis teach
ing He was orucified not by the Jewish people, but by a little clique
of ecclesiastics and oligarchs whose power to exploit the people, His
program would destroy.
The fundamentals of His program are that all men are brothers
and should live together on a basis of mutual service and equally of
material supply; that Mammon "the God of Riches," is the chiet
enemy of God and His Kingdom and must, therefore, be overthrown
if the Kingdom of God is to come, and that true worship consists
not in ceremonies and creeds, but in bringing all the doings of hu
manity into obeJience, to the law of love, thus enabling humanity to
develop into the highest type of spiritual beings.
For about three centuries His followers obeyed Him by living
the communal life which he taught, but for sixteen centuries our so
called Christian civilization has rejected Him for dogmas and creeds
about Him, making thereby a bloody track across the ages. None
of the wars, poverty and crimes of the historic past could have oc
curred if the world had accepted His program.
Is it not about time for people who believe in Jesus to demand
that the world would be run according to His plainly indicated plan?
Why postpone the Kingdom that He taught? Haven't we had enough
of wars, poverty, -crime and unrequieted toil? To oppose His plan,
evem negatively, as is so generally done, is to i eject and to merit
His rebuke: "Why call ye me Lord, Lord and do not the things I say."
.
Here are a few things which will result from the practical carry
ing out of this progTam of Jesus of Nazareth:
lThere will be no wars. (A real League of Nations will be one
good btep in this direction.)
2 There will be no poverty no children or aged people sutter
ing from hunger and cold in a land where food and fuel are
abundant; no anxiety ror the future supply of daily needs and
no lack of the things necessary to enable all to live complete
and abundant lives without fear.
3 There will be no burdensome labor for children, who on the
contrary will have full opportunity for complete development
unto maturity, nor for old pecple who, having done their share
of the work of the world, may be free to do their own pleasure
in peace and plenty.
4 Crime will be practically unknown it will be easier to do right
and harder to do wrong. Crime promotion will have ended.
5 No strikes or lockouts; no swollen fortunes, no wage slaves or
paupers.
6 No special ' privileges for the few and deprivations for the
many. ,
7 The will of God will be the supreme law and righteousness and
justice will rule all human affairs.
This program is the only practical way of running the world. All
other systems, including the present have proved unpractical, have
plunged the people into deeper woe and will continue to do so. The
universal prayer, "The Kingdom Come," can be answered, only when
men and women realizing that Jesus' program must be made operative
in this world, set their faces against everything which hinders that
program
How is it with you, reader? We ask not what you think of Jesus
theologically, but do you think His reported utterances wise and that
obedience to them v ould l e good for the world? If you do. It is your
duty, by your voice, influence and vole, to further such obedience.
If you do not know what He taught concerning social and political
matters, it's time you found out. The world has had enough of a
Christianity which is content to "sit and sing itself away to ever
lasting bliss," but which at the 'ballot box turns its back on Jesus
and is governed chiefly by partisanship and fear.
FINISH THE JOB
Almost everybody believes in ;irbii ration except the man who
thinks he can win without it.
American:' in China tell us the dollar is worth 7C cents there,
mill we louder whether tbio i.i a complaint or a. boabt.
THE WISE MAN.
There is a man in our town and be is very wise.
He hunts out all the U. S. bonds and when he finds, he buys.
Some bonds he buys at 94 and some at 96
He pays the cash and begs for more, at size he never kicks.
This man of wisdom has a box, or iron, with key to match.
He puts the bonds into this box and lets the dollars hatch.
Then the poor boobs who sold the bonds, trot right across the street
And spend their money on a car in which to rest their feet.
They chuckle loud and chuckle long and buy much gasoline,
And call the man who bought the bonds the old man Evergreen.
When hard times come, their car a wreck, they hunt the bond man
then.
And borrow back their savings fund at eight per cent or ten.

AMERICAN LEGION MASCOT
VOL. I.
BISBEE, ARIZONA
No. 8
Last year in camp and trench but
this year home to help Santa Claus
spread the good cheer of Christmap.
That's the American Legion's roc-'j
ord and they more than did their
share on both occasions.
Last night, before their dance in
the Maze hall, the legionaries, undar
the direction -of Post Commander
Angius, distributed, candy and fruit
to the children, Mr. Draper, a mem
ber of the legion, acting as Santa
Claus himself.
Early in the evening the legion
band played in front of the Phelps
Dodge store, the music helping ma
terially to give Bisbee the proper
Chiistmas eve spirit.
In the plaza all the children in
Bisbee lined up and shook hands
with Santa and received their share
of the candy and fruit donated to
them by the Bisbee merchants.
As successful as their Christmas
party for the children of Bisbee ear
lier in the evening was thp American
Legion's Christmas eve dance given
in the Maze Hall last night.
' The legion band played for the
dancers and the floor was crowded
from nine o'clock until after mid
night. What might be called the main
event of the evening was the prize
waltz. The prize dance was an
nounced,, the prizes described and the
result was thp.t so many graceful
waltzing couples danced for those
prizes that the three judges had to
acquire a keen eye and an acute
quality of discretion. The winning
waltzers were Mrs. Thomas Mallon
and Mr. E. Stimson. Mrs. .Mallon
was awarded a beautiful manicure
pet and Mr. Stimson has the choice
of a pair of gloves or a $5 merchan
dise order. Patrick Morris, John
Davies and H. L. Fenner were the
judges.
The dance was under the direction
of the entertainment committee, mem
bers of which are: C. L. McKay, W.
J. Hicks and Tony Caretto.
More of the candy donated by the
merchants to the children in the dis
trict, and to be delivered by the
legionaries, was distributed at the
dance to be brought home by the
dancers to their younger brothers
and sisters or the children next
doo.
SMILE WITH US
HARD
"The Germans," s;1d Senator Gray,
"expected great things of President
Wilson. They're terribly disappointed
that he should be so hard.
"It's like the case of the young fel
low who proposed for the pretty girl's
hand. Her father gave him a hot re
ception. The girl, when -.she heard
about it, said:
'"Clarence, dear, I can't tell you
how shocked I am that clad snould
treat you like that! Dear me, I idol
ized dad and now to think that ray
idol has feet of clay.,'
" Clay?' said Clarence. 'Clay? I
guess you mean concrete.' " Detroit
Free Press.
FROM SUN TO SUN THE ONCE OVER
Edward Thierry, who is now in South Africa with the Universal-Smithsonian
African expedition, believes that is about the best big game yarn he
ver hoard:
"So you have returned from Africa? Had any narrow escapes?"
"Only one. I was chased by a big lion, and, having no cartridges left,
1 threw away my rifle and faced the brute. As he sprang at me I caught
him by the lower jaw with one hand and by the nose with the other. And
there I stood and held his mouth open until he starved to death."

LIES OF THE DAY
With Christmas here and New Year's coming there's no evidence of boot
legging in these parts.
Yon are not kind of wondering why Friend Smith, to whom you sent
a $2 neck-tie, didn't send you something as a Christmas greeting.

Don Maiquis of the New York Sun wrote that but he doesn't really
mean it. We have a friend in New York who says the red wine still flows
and you don't have to be an Arabian Knight to find good hooch, of course,
if you want it. Some of the side street cafes, he writes, will listen to your
specific order:
"Coffee in a cup!" Say it as though you meant it, the friend advises.
When the "coifee in a cup" is on your table there's liable to be a splash
of red on the saucer or, maybe, a wandering red drop maneuvering its way
down the side of the cup.
And when you taste it you know you're not drinking coffee nor rasp
berry juice.

But did you f nd a little brandy left in that bottle? Mince plo sans

A BAD SCRAPE
"My wife got me into a bad scrape
this morning," s.aid Mr. Gabb.
"How was that?" asked Mr. Naybor.
"She used my razor' to sharpen a
pencil," replied Mr. Gabb. Cincinnati
Enquirer.
THE United Slates is well nd of Enlma Goldman, Berkman and
the rest of that motley crew which under duress sailed on the
Soviet t-rk. Cavilling al this government, they denounced the
law and then cried because that law -did not avail them.
The nation is to be congratulated on the departure of a portion
of this concerous element. But the knife should prune harder and
deeper. If. as is claimed, secretary of Labor Wilson fcas ruled that
mere membership In the I. W. W. docs not countenance immediate
deportation, then there shouiti be a new secretary of labor.
Signs begin to appear that we are on the way to a condition ot
iiulustiial stabilization and common svnse. That it may be assured,
no step should be ieft untaken to make suro that every red and
radical in the United States today is sent to his Bolshevist heaven in
Russia. The time to send thorn is BEFORE they do damage, not
afterwards.
The exodus bus been started. The Scriptural injunction against
putting the hand to the blow and then not turning back is commended
to those federal authorities who have to do with this question.

(From the Bisbee Daily Review of Thursday, Dec. 25, 1902)
The Review employees will observe
the Christmas holidays and there
will not be a paper tomorrow morning.
The latest rumor has it that the
Santa Fe company is planning to
build an extension of their line into
Cochise county. Several of the com
pany's officials were here several
days ago to look over the prospects.
There is consolation In the thought that this wild clamor for
direct action is but a part of the reaction.
.The world would l- a hater place to live if the wisdom f the
fathers could bo visited en the children.
Any polity that displease noisy people is iilmoyt certain to meet,
with the ;ipp:ovul ot quiet people.
The mater an 'Ism approaches the ultimate limits of folly, the
more zealous its converts are.
The Tombstone stage was robbed
last night near Fairbank by Two un
known men. Onn of the men held
thje horses while the other ordered
the driver to throw out the express
box. All they got was half of a
twenty dollar bill. The men's feet
were wrapped in gunny sacks so as
to throw the officers off the trail.
Lunch counters are now becoming
the fad in the saloons. The "Fish
Pond" started the ball roJHng and
now the "Mazo" is the last to fall in
line.
The Review wishes to thank the
lirewcry saloon for a Christmas pres
ent of a quart of pure old rye.
team wishes all the members of the
team to meet at the fire house to
morrow morning at ten o'clock. From
there they will go to the grounds on
Quality Hill where they will have
their lirst practice.
The Methodist and Presbyterian
churches held their Christmas serv
ices last night and both were well
attended. Both churches had Christ
mas trees and Santa Claus was pres
ent to distribute candy to the chil
dren that wero present.

LINEN FROCKS ARE IN
FAVOR AT PALM BEACH
A sure indication that linen dresses
are to be in favor at Palm Beam in
the winter season is the fact that
many such dresses were worn at the
Paris races (he past summer. One
particularly attractive frock is report
ed as being of cream-colored lined bor

REMOVING CHRISTMAS GREENS
A pleasant way to manage the re
moval of the Christmas greens is to
make a little ceremony of the per
formance. On the sixth of January,
twelfth night, burn the wreaths and
branches of holly and cvcrygrceii.
This is an old, old custom and means
that the entire household will have
good luck for the coming year.
In Fiance and England a cake was
baked with a bean in it ror the occa
sion. When the cake was cut the
person who got the piece with the
bean in it was regarded as king for
the evening.
If the youngsters can have a sort
of party time out of the disposal o(
their Christmas troe it won t bo quite
such a blow to see it taken down. And

SANTA GLAUS GONSPIRESWITH
AMERICAN LEGION TO GLADDEN
BISBEE DHIL DBEN CHRISTMAS
"Keep In line, Johnny. Hold my
hand or you'll get lost," pleaded the
motherly sister to her younger broth
er, both of whom were in the long
Christmas line that attended Santa
Claus party in thar plaza last night,
at which he gave away candy ana
fruit and said hello to all the chil
dren. "Well, say, sis, I want to see Santa
Claus. He's been he're a long time
now and he's got more than half the
world to get around to. I don't care
if I do get lost!"
That was Johnny answering defi
for it was true Santa Claus spent
many of his precious minutes in Bis
bee last night.
Early in the evening he slipped
quietly Into town (somebody said he
left his reindeer and sleigh at thfc
divide so he could make ' a quick
start to Tombstone). But he wasn't
too early for Fisbee. The American
Legion band was waiting, all tuned
up, to give him a musical reception.
While he untiringly gave out candy
anH fruit, said "hello" to all the chil
dren and generously gave of his good
cheer the American Liegion Dauu
played for him.
When he called upon the American
Legion for reinforcement there were
ready hands to respond. When his'
supply of candy and fruit dwindled;
under the heavy demand upon it byj
the front line rank of the Warren,
district kiddies the legionaries hur
ried about the city and through the
generosity of the local merchants
were able to bring back a liberal re
plenishment to Santa's stock.
Soon after the plaza party he
rushed to Warren where he made
personal calls on the children, de
serting the chimney entrance for the
front door.
On his way back through Bisbee,
on his way to Tombstone, he quietly
dropped down the chimneys and fill
ed the stockings.
Never was Santa so talkative as he
was last night. One of the legion
aries found him tiptoeing away from
the Y. M. C. A. where he had left the
essentials for a smoker pipes, tobac
co and good cheer.
"Hellow, sergeant! Sure. I remem-
last yvai, icuiciHuvi . (-
"Helol sergeant! Sure, I remem
ber, and you made a date with me
for this year . in Bisbee. Y'know,
sergeant, I thought this year's busi
ness was going" to overwhelm me.
But with the greatest war in his
tory and Americans finding their
peaceful level I knew this Christmas
was to be unprecedented, but, y'know,
my work this year is being made
easy by the American Legion," Santa
Claus hesitated long enough to say
all this and before he quietly disap
peared he added:
"I remember when Bisbee was one
of my short stops, but not so now."
With that he was gone but he had
given generously of his good cheer
and he seems to be everywhere in
Bisbee today.

RAILROADS TO
ll
BE GIVEN BACK
11 CHEER
(Continued from Page One.)
Even bigger problems confront the
express companies. Consolidated into
one system under government opera
tion, the four original corporations arc
reported to have asked the depart
ment of justice if there would be any
violation of the Sherman anti-trust
law in their remaining a unit.
In two years of physical possession
of the railroads, the government has
encountered a deficit of approximately
$646,000,000, according to estimates
submitted to Senator Cummins. When
the roads were- taken over January 1,
1918, congress guaranteed them a
rental of $900,000,000 annually, based
on the average income of a three-year
test period. Operating revenues in
1918 fell $236,000,000 below the stand
ard return and this year will be about
$250,000,000 under that amount. The
remainder of the deficit has been in
curred in expenses of administration,
inland waterways, etc.
Two appropriations have been made
by congress, one of $300,000,000 and
the other of $750,000,000, much of
which has been used as a revolving
fund by the railroad corporations and
for the purchase of new equipment.
These amounts will be repaid to the
government.

Battling Herrera versus Young Gr iffo, 4 rounds 126 pounds.
Johnny Meyer versus Young Ban ta, 6 rounds, 145 pounds.
Frank Lough rey versus Kid Palm er, 10 rounds, 145 pounds.
The ring: craft of a veteran In the
pink of condition will be pitted
against rushing youth and boxing skill
in Warren Park this afternoon, when
Prank Louehrey, master of over 100
battles, clashes with Kid Palmer, the
19-year-old welterweight champion of
the United States army, in a ten-round
boxing bout for the championship of
the Southwest.
Interest beyond anything yet mani
fested in the many good bouts held
this year in Bisbee, or for that matter
anywhere else in Arizona, attaches to
the Palmer-Loughrey meeting, and ev
ery indication points to a Southwest
ern record for attendance at Warren
Tark this afternoon.
Fans are coming fm man widely
divergent points to see the mill, ac
cording to orders for seat reservations
which came in by telegraph and tele
phone to Promoter French yesterday,
as well as reports from the advance
guard of out-of-town fans. With the
mines shut down in Cananea -for the i
holiday, large numbers of boxing en-,
thusiasts are coming from the Mexi-1
can city. From Tucson will come a
big delegation of admirers of Happy
Woods, who. thrcugh his clean-cut
knockout of Eddie McLarney, the navy
champion, in Tucson Tuesday night,
has earned a match with the winner
ofthe Palmer-Loughrey mill. 'These
Tucson followers are anxious to get a
line on how their favorite will size up
with the principals in today's battle.
Officers of the Nineteenth infantry,
stationed at Douglas, which is Pal
mer's regiment, arrived in Bisbee yes
terday with the report that many auto
truck loads of soldiers will come up
from the border city this morning to
take in the bout There will also be
big delegations from Tombstone, Fort
Huachuca and Nogales, while requests
for seat reservations have-come from
as far away as El Paso.
With the Copper Queen and C. & A.
mines shut down over the holiday in
the Warren district, the Bisbee attend
ance is expected to set a record for
the district itself.
A special ring has been constructed
in Warren Park for the bouts, which
will begin promptly at 1:30 o'clock,
in order to give the fans plenty of
time to get home to their Christmas
dinners. Hundreds of ringside chairs
have been placed in addition to the
grandstand and bleachers, so ar
ranged that every spectator will get
an unobstructed view of the ring.
Palmer and Loughrey went through
their final light workouts in the K. of
C. hall here 'yesterday afternoon, be
fore a big gathering of fans, who were
much impressed with the condition of
both. "Loughrey, aided by the skillful
handling of the veteran Kid George,
has brought himself to a condition of
practically physical perfection, and
declares he is every bit as good as
when he stood up for 20 gruelling
rounds against the late Les DArcy,
then the greatest of all Australian
champions and the talk of the entire
boxing world; or when he swapped
gloves with Georges Carpentier, now
heavyweight champion of Europe.
Palmer has youth and remarkable
boxing skill on his side, and many
fans, both In Douglas and here, fig
ure he will prove too much for his
older opponent; but the backers of
Loughrey are pointing to the fact that
it Js practically next to Impossible to
knock the Philadelphian out, and that
while he will have no fear of Palmer's
punches, he will be landing some tell
ing blows himself, and will be using
alljhfs superior ring, cunning against
the younger man. In addition, Loueh
rey has In his corner the crafty Kid
George, who has no peer In the South
west when it comes' to mapping out
a campaign during the actual progress;
of ,thfl battle; ; ,,j ,n; i:-i' ! t'l
."With both' men In such splendid con
dition, both backed by such high-class
records and fistic reputations, and
both confident of victory, it is small
wonder that hundreds of fans are puz
zling their brains this morning to
choose between the pair, and that In
terest has mounted to fever pitch.
The six-round special event between
Johnny Meyer and Young Banta Is of
Itself attracting many to the ringside.
Meyer Is giving away considerable
weight to his aggressive and hard-hitting
opponent, but will denend on his
coolness and superior boxing skill to
bring him victory. It should be a
rushing battle, brimful of action,
throughout. Young Banta hails from
the Czar shaft, and many fellow
miners will be at the ringside to cheer
him on.

has by no means abated, as the tour

the men next above them. Taking ad
vantage of this opportunity, "Pop"

The match was bowled Tuesday eve

from his place as fourth man on the

of sixth man on the First team by
Frank Wilson, Bill Brown, and Jimmie

that he would be willing to present

not to be persuaded.

KID PALMER
Urdefeated welterweight champion of the United States
army, says: "Frank Loughrey is a veteran Doxer, who has
fought champions, and one of the hardest nuts in the welter
weight division to crack; but I feel certain that when today's
bout is over he will have gone the way of all the other boxers
who have met me in the Southwest."

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. Dec. 24. The ex
treme dullness of today's stock mar
ket, transactions falling to the small
est total of any full session since mid
summer reflected the detached a.tti
tudo of traders and the nublic at this
period of the year. In the main, how-
ever ,the undertone was firm, with oc
casional intervals or strength .particu
larly in some of the obscure or in
active miscellaneous specialties which
suffered impairment in the November
reversal.
Money was again the one disquiet-
ing feature, call loans rising to 15 per
cent from the opening rate of 10 and
declining to the initial quotation just
before the close. Little or no effort
was made to negotiate time loans
which ruled at recent maximum fig -
ures.
American Tobacco securities, Amer -
ican Linseed, Endicott Johnson, Rem -
ington Typewriter California Packing,
Barrett & Co. and several of the su-
gar and shipping issues were conspicu-
ous for their consistent strength at ex-
treme gains of 2 to 7 points.
Rails and representative steels and
equipments made only moderate up
ward progress at best, but metals and
local utilities notab.lv Manhattan Ele
vated, denoted steady accumulation,
Sales amounted to 625,000 shares.
Bonds were strong on the rebound
in speculative rails, investment trans-
portations also stiffening. Liberty is-
sues cased again but foreigns were
slightly better. Total sales,, par value.
aggregated $31,750,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on
call.

TRAVELS IN AUTO

Star ot the East
Christmas Eve in Armenia. .
In the doorway of a hut, peering through the darkness,
down the road which winds to the distant sea, a little
girl in tr.ttered garments, aits and dreams, and dreams.
Around her, likewise dreaming, are other little chil
dren. They know it is Chistmas Eve. They know what
it means. "Christ was born on the morrow," they tell
each other gravely.
For these are children of Armenia, children of the
faith, children of Christ, who died that the world might
be saved.
For their faith these little children have suffered, are
suffering now. Some h.-.ve seen their fathers, because of
faith, fall at the- hand of the brutal Turk. Others have
known the terror of that moment when their mothers were
dragged away, never to ccmu home again. Sorrow has set
its darkeneing cloud on their childisii faces.
And yet their eyes zrt still r.light with hope and their
little hearts best resolutely with the warm blood of faith.
They have been told the story, the never-dying 6tory,
of Jesus, born in a manger, In Bethlehem not so many
miles away and of the Three Wise Men who came out
of the East, following the Star, and bearing gifts of frank
incense and myrrh.
Star of the East, whither wandrest thou tonightl
They gaze into the heavens, and there, even as it was
two thousand years before, the Star still is shining a
beacon of love and hope, unchanging through the centur
ies. And the children peer again down the road towards the
sea in th; ar'iiecs, waiting, wr.iting.
Where, oh, where, tonight, are the Three Wise Men,
bearing their precious gifts, and led by the shining Star?
The road from the sea is long, and to him who journeys
there, the way is a weary one, and the road across the
sea, where travel the ships, is longer still, and the way
there, too, is ?. weary one.
But, across that sea, at the other end of that long,
weary road, is a Country, and that Country is great, and'
big, and wr.rm of he?rt.
America! There, in this mogic land, dwell now the
"Three Wise Men." There, too, are other little children
happy children, thoughtful, kindly children.
And these little children of America, also know the
story of the Star and of the Bobc. They know, too, that
there, in that saddened, stricken land, across the sea,
peering down the road through the dark.iess, the lonely
little children of Armenia r.re wr.iting.
And they shall not wait in vain. '
From the Land of joy and plenty, from great, generous
America, bearing the gifts of the children, the Wise Men,
once more, r.s they did when Christ ws born, follow the
SUr.
The banner they hold aloft bears the words, "Near
East Relief." It is ?. banner of hope, a symbol of service,
to the suffering peoples of the Bible Lands. They know
its magic message. It has saved them before: it shall
save them again. It shall more than save them, by the
help of the men, women and children of America it shall
build them up into a nation, strong and independent.
And the little children of Armenia, the lonely little,
hungry, shivering orphans, wait hopefully, .confidently."
They know that the "Three Wise Men" will come.
They know that the great ?.nd generous people of that
mighty mother-land, America, will be true to them, will
stand by them, even r.s they themselves, through all the
black reign of terror and oppression, have stood firm in
the f?.ith of Him, whose 8t"r the Wise Men ever follow.
