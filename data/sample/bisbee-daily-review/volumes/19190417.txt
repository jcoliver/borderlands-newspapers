Lowell Resident Attacked by
Pair Armed With Knife,
He Tells the City Police
Mystery Shrouds Affair,, as
Wife of Wounded Relates
Different Story of Cutting
With a deep wound in his
back and bleeding profusely,
J. W. Jdhnson, who lives
above the Brooks garage in
Lowell, was rushed !to the
Copper Queen - hospital for
medical attention last night
shortly before midnight.
According to Police Offi
cer Hill Ruff, who, in com
pany with Deputy Sheriff
Tom Foster, learned of the
whereabouts, of the wounded
man, Johnson alleges that he
was held up by a Mexican and
American in front of the
Brooks garage, and that when
he resisted their attempted
hold-up the American grab
bed him while the Mexican
cut him with a large knife.
The officers state that when they
entered the rooms occupied by John
son and his wife Mrs. Johnson insist
ed that the affair was an "accident"
but when Johnson was questioned fur
ther he related the other story.
The officers are somewhat prone
to believe that other motives were
responsible but from the operating
rooms at the Copper Queen hospital
early this morning nothing would be
divulged which would throw a light on
the mystery.
The wounded man was attended by
Dr. Hunt. The wound which is an
ugly one takes the shape of a "V" and
extends down the left side night above
the kidneys for more than eight
inches. The depth of the wound could
not be ascertained but it was stated
that the man will recover.

Ne Intervention and No Rec

Premier Successfully Passes
Crisis in England by His
Stand on Foreign Affairs
LONDON, April 16. No interven
tion in Russia; no recognition of bol
shevism, and the fulfillment of his
election promises, including those re
lating to indemnity from the enemy
German emperor, were the outstan
Germa nemperor, were the outstand
ing features of the report which Pre
mier Lloyd George delivered in the
house of commons today. j
Every member was in his seat andj
the galleries were packed with dis
tinguished visitors, among them the
Prince of Wales and the American
ambassador, John W. Davis, when the
premier entered the chamber, with the
cheers of the great crowds outside the
parliament grounds still ringing in
his ears. He appeared fresh and in
buoyant spirits.
Jn the main, though, the mood of
the premier was serious, in conformi
ty with the weighty subjects discuss
ed, and the audience listened with pro
found attention to his speech, which
lasted for almost an hour and a half.
The Laborites vigorously applauded
the premier's announcement of non
Itnervention in Russia and non-recognition
of bolshevism, but remained
silent while the conservatives cheered
the statement that the allies would
continue to aid friendly elements
which were fighting boshevism.
At the conclusion of the premier's
speech, "when members and those in
the galleries were pouring out in quest
of belated luncheons, William Adam
son, leader of the labor opposition in
the house, rose and characterized the
speech of the prime minister as elo
quent, but not entirely satisfactory.
Mr. Adamson's comment summed up
the opinion of pthers among his audi
tors and numerous elements among
the public, whom the newspapers for
the last few days have prepared for
illuminating revelations in the speech
conjeerning tihe peace terms formu
lated. Interests In the debate rapidly de
clined, the mmbers flocking into the
lobbies to discuss the premier's
speech. John R. Clynes, labor mem
ber and former food minister, declar
ed it would be better to kill bolshe
vism by feeding than by fighting. He
complained that it would be humiliat
ing to receive the peace terms from
Germany .and said that apparently Mr.
Lloyd George would come to parlia
ment 1 for a vote of confidence after
the settlement of terms in which par
liament had no part.
At 6:30 o'clock a member called at
tention to the absence of a quorum.
The doors were opened, but instead
of the members entering to make a
quorum, many of those present walked
out, and the house was counted out,
standing adjourned for the Easter re
cess until April 29.

SOLDIER ATTEMPTS
TO STORM JAIL
Trooper Goes to Rescue of
Comrade Arrested by
Lowell Officers
Early this morning sleepy Lowell
was the scene of a drunken soldier, a
rifle with fixed bayonet and a threat
to rescue from Lowell's bastile an in
carcerated comrade in arms. -. ..
Deputy Sheriff Tom Foster, who
was at the Copper Queen hospital, was
called by phone. The provost guards
at Lowell were informed, and if we
can go by past performances, by the
time the paper goes to gress a sol
dier, a rifle, a bayonet and a lot of
false courage will be sheltered behind
the bars wherein lies the comrade
that this warrior would rescue.
. According to early morning visitors
from Lowell way the police of Lo
well arrested earlier in the evening a
soldier who was disturbing the peace.
However, they only got one of them
and as the false courage of the other
became more convincing . to himself
he proceeded in battle formation to
rescue his "pal" who had been so un
fortunate or perhaps fortunate to
land in the clutches of the law.
At- press time the soldier is still
master of a little no-man's-land which
he has created for himself but there is
a flank mpvement under way by the
guards and the police and the enemy
is expected to be captured without
a fight.

PARIS, April 16 (By the Associat

its confidence in the government on a
question whether France's conditions
of peace should be made known to
parliament after Foreign Minister
Pichon had declined to outline the de
tails of the peace preliminaries until
the treaty had been signed.
The usual calm marking the morn
ing sittings of the chamber, where
electoral reform was under discussion,
was broken by Depiity Andre Lebey,
who, seeing that' M. Pichon, the for
eign minister, was present, asked the
minister when he would accept an in
terpellation on the conditions on which
the government would make known
the terms of peace to parliament.
M. Pinchon replied that he was will
ing to be interpellated immediately,
but that he refused to give any de
tails of the peace preliminaries, these,
the minister added, would be submit
ted for ratification by parliament a.
soon as signed. He then asked that
th mnttpr be droDDed. making it a
question of confidence in the govern
ment. The house, after some heated
speeches, supported M. Pichon in his
refusal to postpone discussion until to
morrow by a vote of 334 to 166.
At the "demand of the socialists a j
vote for closure of the debate was j
taken by a personal vote and closure j
was carried. 212 against 102, show
ing that some 150 deputies abstained
from voting.
M. Pichon in his address pointed
out that to submit the peace prelimi
naries to parliament before the sig
nature of the treaty would be uncon
stitutional; that it would be submit
ting legislative for executive power.
M. Pichon reminded the house be
fore voting that the government de- j
served well of the country. He re-!
called that M. Clemenceau had given ;
warning that France would have to ;
make concessions. The foreign min

" PHOENIX, April 16. Although the
last legislature appropriated $50,000
to build the Sacaton-Florence power
line, it may not be worth while con
structing it, according to a statement
by State Engineer Maddock tonight.
"The line was intended to give pow
er to the state prison at Florence
and to the city as well," said Maddock,
"but a question has arisen whether
the water users can furnish a con--
stant . supply of electricity. SuperinJ
tendent Elliott seems to .think he
can give us plenty of power in the
summer when we do not need it much,
but not much in the winter when wo
need .it badly. The water users in
tend to establish additional steam
plants so that water will not be wasted
in the non-irrigating portions of the
year, but these plants will not be com
pleted for possibly two years.

little use of building the line."

gates of the 18 powers this afternoon
was presided over by M. Clemenceau,
who communicated to them the date
on which the Germans would be in
vited to be at Versailles.
One question considered was wheth

the name of the council of five, or in
the name of all the allied and associ
ated powers represented at the peace
conference. The impression prevail
ing after the meeting was that all
should join in the invitation.
The council of ten met after the
meeting of the delegates of the IS
powers and considered the procedure
to be adopted at Versailles and also a
number of collateral phases of the
peace tieaty that had been referred to
the foreign ministers.
The council was held at the foreign
office on the call of the council cn

PRELIMINARY PLANS
FOR VICTORY'LOAII
DRIVE AREGOMPLETE
Teams Selected to Help Co
chise County Over Top
in Campaign
Declaring that the citizens of Co
chise county would have to marshall
all the energy and business manage
ment at their command to make the
fifth- Liberty war loan go "over the
top," J. N. Gaines, county chairman
of the Filth Liberty War Loau com
mittee, yesterday afternoon called to
order a meeting of business men of
the city to formulate plans lor the
launching of the bis drive which will
commence April 21 and close on' mid
night May 10.
"We've got to grab thi3 thing by the
nap of the neck," he said with much
emphasis. "And .when we do so we'll
be able to go out and get the money.
Optimism must reign instead of pes
simism and an equitable distribution
of the burden throughout the district
will be one of the paramount "neces
sities vital to its success."
Mr- Gaines then dwelt on the
changed conditions in the community.
He pointed out that working condi
tions were not the same now as they
were during the fourth loan drive.' At
least 50 per cent of the workmen in
the mines had been laid off and in
most instances those remaining have
had a reduction in wages.. He said
that he had wired the officials of the
Eleventh Federal Reserve bank of the
conditions that now obtained and ho
felt satisfied that in apportioning the
quota for this section those officials
would consider with all seriousness
the changed conditions and. that the
quota this , time would, be at least a
million less than the quota of the last
loan.
Hard Work Necessary
Mr. Jesse Yoakum said tnat hard
work and lots of it would be necessary
to make the loan a success. He then
pointed out that most of the laboring
men in this section were still paying
on the fourth loan bonds and where
they subscribed a hundred or more
last time they- will probably only sub
scribe half that amount for this loan.
Mr. Henderson said that everything
looked brighter to him. "We; have
never . fallen down before," he said,
"and never will. When we get started
we'll, pull, through alright. No U3e
thinking, of. failure. Lots of people
w ill be reluctant about coming thorugh
and some of them won't be able to
but we must drain those who can af
ford it." .
Arthur Xotman, superintendent for
the Phelps Dcdge company, said that j
while nothing definitely had been de- j
cided upon he was sure that his com- j
parry would not make any payroll de- j
ductions on this loan. There had been
quite a lot of dissatisfaction on the j
part of the men on this account. He ;
. was of the opinion that the .matter
should be handled by the banks. Mr.
Notman then assured those present
that he would heartily co-operate in
the movement and that soliciting the
mines would be taken care of by men
working in the mines who would work
under the direction and supervision
of central headquarters.
Women Organized
The matter was then taken up re
garding the operation of the different
teams in the various districts. It was
decided that three men should work
with each woman's team. Mrs. Sam I
Frankenburg was consulted on the !
telephone regarding the women j
chosen to campaign the districts and j
she informed Mr. Gaine3 that the wo-1
men were ready. Their organization j
has been perfected and they are mere- j
ly awaiting the signal tc commence
firing. j
The selection of the men to compose j
the teams to canvass the district in .
co-operation with the women was j
then taken up andHhree men were se-1
lected for each team. A meeting of j
those men who have been selected will :

No Mystery About Abner Davis Trtistee Plan
Many people are skeptical, some do net want to understand. There are
those who are looking for something crookeO. all the -time, so they do not rec
ognize a straight proposition when they see one.
"" SIMPLE ENOUGH
I have told you that the location of well No. 4 was secured before .the
Trustee Plan was started. In fact, I was i a position to drill this well and
pay tdr it before one dollar was ever paid i i on the Trustee Plan-therefore,
I could have owned this well and I could guarantee the return of your money
if. Well No. 4 failed to come in as I guarantees,- and I would have the well,
and you would have your money. But wel! No. 4 is now a part of the Trustee
Plan for your profit. Of course, if I had to use your money to drill a well,
and bad no other resources it is plain that I could not return your money if
the well failed- -
WHY TWO FOR ONE? . '
The biggest protection to. you lies in the fact that under my plan I can
drill two wells with the same money it takes the ordinary one well .company
to drill one well.
, - INSIDE FACTS ABOUT PROMOTION
The ordinary company promoted to drill a well must be capitalized at
enough to pay for the lease, pay commissions, pay expanses, pay salaries
to officers and then pay for drilling the well. Salaries, expenses, commis
sions and profit on the lease and the profits to promoters are always equally
as much as the actual cost of the least and well. The promoter must make
his profit and take it out of your money before your money ever goe3 into
actual investment.
UNDER THE ABNER DAVIS TRUSTEE PLAN
There are no salaries to officers; no promotion profits; no commissions
to pay, no boosting, the price of leases and taking the prcfit by the promoter
but all of your money goes into leases at actual cost price, and into legitimate
expense and the cost of wells, and I wait 'for this mcney to actually earn
profits and return your principal of 100 per cent. Then return you 100 per cent
profits, leaving you a full 100 per cent invested and earning more profits,
before I begin to profit at all from your money.

These relinery viev-s snow stccions identical with tne Abner Davis Refinery
now under construction at North Wichita Falls, Texas.
These ore the reasons v.hy ycur money will drill twice as many wells and
earn twice as much dividends and build a permanent business for you as well
as for me. These are the reasons the average stock jobbing, manipulating pro
moter cannot make good they simply cannot understand the idea of a man
actually using all the moniy and waiting for his profit from actual production
when the cuEtom has been for the promoter to take always 51 per cent and
often 75 per cent and sometimes the whole 10C. per cent, and klave the invest
ing public with some gildec"- stock certificates as the sole evidence of the
money invested.
If I fail to make good as your Trustee if I fail to make money for you
I cannot make money for myself. .
I am your trustee. Your money is trust funds placed in my hands for cer
tain purposes, and I cannot take a dollar of this money for salary, commis
sion, prolit on leases or promotion profit, because I agree not to do so
therefore, if I did these things I would be guilty of misappropriating Trust
Funds, and my days would be numbered.
BETTER TO BE HONEST
I believe all men are honest at heart, and if temptation is removed, that
most men would be honest. I have purposely eliminated every temptation
on earth from the Abner Davis Trustee Plan and have made my profit de
pend absolutely and entirely ujon the profits to be earned; hence, there Is
no incentive to be other than honest, in carrying out the Trust, for only
through actual profits from' the operation cf the business can 1 pront a
single dollar.

AVood and Scott Fear Parallel: Method of Paying Bills Re-
to Harry Thaw Case
in Army
(V.y Review Leased Wire)
. WASHINGTON". April 16. Three
major generals of the regiiiar army,
Leonard Wood and Hush L. Scott (re
tired), former chiefs of the general
staff and each of hom trained -and
commanded divisions 'during the war,
and John L. Chamberlain, inspector
general, opposed f V3' before the
American Bar association committee
inquiring into the subject of military
justice, any plan of taking from the
president and the.comanding generate
the control they now exercise over
courts martial. The present contro
versy as to war time sentences began
with the proposal of Lieutenant Colo
nel Samuel Ansell, Termer acting
judge advocate general, to repose in
the judge advocate general final juris-
diction of these cases.
The three officers heard today were
in agreement that the proposed change
would impair the disciplinary system,
although all of them- saw defects in
existing laws or regulations iwhicii
should be remedied. To meet com
plaints as to excessive sentences the
officers 'were of the opinion that the
president should be authorized by law
to fix minimum penalties in war times
' as well as peace.
"But whatever is done," General
Wood declared, "do not give us any
'possibility of a Harry Thaw case in
the army. Give us a simple, direct
process. We don't want the haggling
over technicalities of civil court
cases."
General Chamberlain shared this
view as opposed to the suggestion that
the military legal system should be
put entirely under army legal authori
ties. He opposed the suggestion that
it be made mandatory that trained
legal officers preside over courts.
General Scott was positive in his
assertion that; control of discipline
was an essential function of command.
"The weakening cf discipline in the
Russian army," said General Scott, j
who was a member of the Root mis-j
sion to Russia, '"destroyed Russia." j
"The fundamental., defect in our
ocurt martial procedure," . General !
Wood said, "is not in the machinery,
but in the failure to carry cut its oper-!
ations properly." j
General Wood urged that more j
careful " scrutiny should be given to
cases before they were brought to
trial .particularly- ty division or d3-
partmem commanders; that greater
use be made cf the many disciplinary I
measures not involving legal pro-i
ceedings ot'the disposal of command
ers; that competen tcounsel be assign- '
ed for ail prisoners to proteft their .
rights and that judge advocates of
courts incline toward the French, sys

jected by State Auditor
Is Discovered
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Aprit 15. The State
Board of Equalization will provide the
fuuda. tor those 15 departments in
favor of which State Auditor Boyce
recently said he would refuse to is
sue warrants. This was the state
ment reported at the capitol today as
having been made by a member of
the board.
Boyce stated that he would refuse
to issue the warrants because senate
bjll SO barred any department from
exceeding its appropriation and that
the 15 departments which he placed
under the ban there are no specific
appropriations.
The way out of the difficulty, as
credit edto a member of the board of
equalization, was said to lie in senate
bill, 135, the so-called "levy bill" under
which the board is authorized to levy
a tax "sufficient, with other sources
of revenue to defray the necessary ex
penses of the state for' each of the
fiscal years, to pay the deficits for
the preceding fiscal year, to provide a
sinking fund and to pay the annual
interest on the state debt."

Look at the dividends that have been paid
by these 56 Burkburnett companies since
last September.
Stock in any of them could have been
bought at par only a few months ago.
Yon didn't buy then you would have to
pay handsomely for their stock NOW.
These companies guarantee their stock
holders but ONE WELL, yet look at the
dividends they paid and see what their
stock is worth now.
We have FOUR leases ALL in the Burk
burnett Pool, all surrounded by producers
and new producers coming in around our
leases every week.
We guarantee to drill THREE WELLS
the FIRST one will soon be started
then the SECOND and the" THIRD.
Suppose all three are producers, our stock
holders will certainly be paid handsome
dividends won't they? ;
We know of no other company guaran
teeing you THREE wells.
;
If they are all producers won't you regret
you are not a stockholder?
It's not too late to join us, but you'll have
to hurry Our stock will all be gone if you
are too slow making up your mind.
Send in your subscription quick if you
want stock in all THREE wells.

This lease is located on the great RICE DOME AND HAS ENHANCED
IN VALUE AT LEAST FOUR HUNDRED PER CENT since its pur
chase by the Golden Goose Company some weeks ago. Your money
works with ours, to drill these wells. Ycur help with our ability and
money will undoubtedly bring big and quick returns. We are among
the last of the low capitalization companies. Investors who get in on
this will do so during the next few days. . Over two and cue-half Mil
LION DOLLARS already paid in dividends in Burkburnett. Fifty com
panies now in the dividend class. Companies with one-half-acre lease
now being formed and have been organized for one hundred, thousand
dollars and even more. Two wells with production of only 1,500 bar
rels daily each based on par will give our investors an estimated daily
income of $16.00 on only a hundred-dollar investment, $48.00 per month
on a ten-dollar investment. We are conservative in bur estimates and
refer you to the HUMBLE WELL, which was reported flowing 2,400
barrels daily. This well paid for itself every three to five days, and
the company disposed of half of their holdings for twenty million' dot-,
lars. We have drilling locations for ten deep wells and forty shallow
wells. ,
Thousands of Investors Made' Rich by Burkburnett Oil.
Did You Get Your Share?
BUY NOW WHILE YOU HAVE A CHANCE
We are operating in what is known as the greatest oil pools of the
times. Who ever heard of an oil field where the flush production was
and is as high as 2,500 barrels dally, from a depth of 1,700 feet? Terri
tcry adjoining our acreage has four distinct and separate oil sands.
Geologists and experienced oil men predict that at least five or six
sands exist. When our acreage is thoroughly developed and we are
taking oil from all five sands we estimate that the production should
be between ten and fifteen thousand barrels daily. This is possible
and reasonable. Fifteen thousand barrels daily of oil would mean an
income of thirty-six thousand dollars per day, or four-fifths of our
entire capitalization. One hundred dollars invested at par-would then
pay back monthly in dividends $2,400. This sounds big but look for
just a minute at what Burkburpett oil companies have paid. Floydada
Oil Company announces 400 per cent dividend to be paid in 21 days.
Fowler stock originally sold fcr one hundred per share. . Recent deal,

their earnings already. Lease in Block 5S reported sold for $250,000
for only ten acres, or $25,000 per acre all Burkburnett. Everything
being equal our lease should be worth $500,000 or half a million dol
lars based on the price that was reported paid for 10 acres in Block
ES, when the now drilling deep test wells come in.
OUR NEIGHBORS ALREADY PAYING DIVIDENDS NOW.
Black-Eumett Oil Company on the north is now taking oil from
the first sand and are paying iuontAly dividends on $150,000 capitaliza
otin, or more than three times what we are capitalized for. Quanah
Oil Company, which joins us immediately on the north, is also a divi
dend payer from oil taken from the second sand. Their capital is one
hundred thousand or double ours. Bear in mind we are among the last
of the low capitalization companies, only forty-five thousand dollars.
Our lease of twenty acres cost us only three hundred and fifty dollars
per acre. Leases within a mile of us have sold as high as $2,500.00
per acre, or seven times that paid for ours. We ask this question:
Is our lease worth our entire capitalization? Are the chances to get
oil and the profits from our proposed refinery worth a small gamble
by you?

Building a University , .
We do not know if the Tucson Star or any other newspaper has been
tie dominant factor in the building of the University of Arizona. We
do not pretend to hold the key to the successes which have come, one
after another 'for the past twenty years to the university. But, we are
interested in the following item from the Arizona Gazette, of Phoenix,
under the heading "Twenty Years Ago in Phoenix." It follows:
"The Tucson Star is making a desperate effort to bolster up the rapid
ly defuncting institution known as the territorial university."
The history of the University of Arizona has been one of interesting
advances punctuated with periods of depression. Tucson, home of Jthe
institution, has ever backed it with consistent endeavor and with in
creasing energy. The newspapers of Tucson in the same manner have
from day to day given of their time and space to the school. Through,
their constant attention the public has come to know the needs of the
university, its advances, its successes, its work and its play. They have
given it publicity.
During the last sessions of the Arizona legislature a remarkable ex
ample r.i this newspaper loyalty to the University was shown. Large
funds were -urgently needed for the support and extention of the Uni
versity. Some opposition was voiced to granting the budget requested.
The Tucson papers took up the fight, gave the university publicity,
explaining fully for what funds are needed, backed up argument with illus
tration of past accomplishments, and became a large factor in finally con
vincing the legislature that the institution's requests were legitimate and
necessary.
The lesson in this series of university experiences is obvious. Wich
out the press-the territorial university might have died twenty years ago.
Without the press the university might have suffered severe losses at
the hands of any one of a dozen legislatures. We do not believe for a
moment that the newspapers alone are responsible for the successes
which have built up and finally made oi the university an institution of
which, the entire state may be proud. But we do believe that the word
of tha press has made this construction the easier and the qiJcker
realized.
Wobbly Activity
f 1
J. W. W. or bolshevik propaganda is being insiduiously spread
throughout the United Stales aud especiaHy throughout the mining sec
tions, where quite a large foreign element eixsts, among which they ex
pect to make recruits. The past month or two propagandists have been
at work in the Oatman field, and much of their literature has come to
light. This. literature is the vilest kind of bolshevism, and the men who
are disseminating it 'were but recently released from the federal peni
tentiary, having served a sentence on conviction of espionage. Loth are
American-born, but rabid anarchists. Their propaganda is being urged
on the union miners of the district, and every effort, is being made to
cause antagonism and unrest among the workers.
Union menj"as a whole, are against I. r. W., and the real workers
are using every effort to stamp it from trade unionism. ( Samuel Gompers,
the man who stands above everything in his stalwart Americanism, is
fighting the red plague with every w-eapon at his command, and today
union miners are trying to prevent the spread of the destructive forces of
bolshevism among the laboring classes. And now it is up to the civilian
population to come to the aid of the' real unionized orders of the country
to beat cut and down the dread menace of the red forces. At Oatman and
at Chloride the I. W. W. has been engaged in his nefarious work and the
citizen, who Relieves in the upholding of organized government and the
rights of the real workers, should stand solidly back of the men who are
brought close into contact with the disloyal element and have to combat
it in all jts phases. The members of the Western Federation of Miners
of our mining camps have to ferret out the secret agents of the bolshe
vists, but if they have not the support of the whole people they will have
a hard time preserving order and keeping their organizations intact.
If the people would let these beings get Jhe upper hand of the government,-we
would have a reptition of the awful conditions that Russia has
suffered under the absolute rule of Lenine and Trotzky. Murder, lust
and starvation stalk abroad over that great land and there is not the
least glimpge of where it will end. Women have no more standing among
these beasts than the animals of the fields. Under their constitution a
man can take and use a woman as he sees fit. There is no marriage rite
and the women of the country are mere swine in the eyes of the men who
seek to impose their rule on the whole world. It is this government,
or lack of government, that the I. W. W. would impose on the people of
America.
In the bloody conflict, just ended, our boys gave up everything to
fight and, perhaps, die for Americanism. At that very time the I. W. W.
were the stealthy allies of the Hun in America. The union man was one
of the staunchest supporters of Uncle Sam. In the shipyards, in the muni
tion factories, in the mines he was giving his best.
The danger to Americanism is not yet over, and we know that the
union man has not changed; he is still the American he was then. There
fore, do not confuse unionism with bolshevism.
The I. ,W. W. works in the dark. Compare him, if you will, with
brave boys over there who have unflinchingly and openly gone through
the hell of battle that there might be preserved a free and decent country
for them and theirs to live in; that their womenfolk and children might
not be subjected to the brutalities of, the Hun, as they were in Belgium.
Is the state of the women of Russia any more desirable?
Let us keep faith with those boys who lie in graves on foreign soil,
and help preserve the America they fought for. Mohave County Miner.
The fact of class may not excuse bolshevism, but it explains it.
We made everything safe for democrats except the next congress.
Bolshevism is making itself at
that knows its own father.
They tell us that chaos is threatening Germany, and we are inclined
to hope that chaos isn't bluffing.
' Having nailed the hide of militarism to the barn door, it 1s unthink
able that America should refuse to clinch the nails. '
The Czechs are willing that Poland should have the majority right
in the Tescheh coal fields if they may have the miner rights.
The kind of work that sbils the hands very seldom soils the mind.
'
The bolshcvisfs idea of a reactionary form of government is any.
A man's success goes to his
place on the premises.
War prosperity was merely a fever that induced thought in terms
of millions. Normal conditions may seem less joyous, but they will
be inoer healthy.

COMMISSION UPHELD
PHOENIX, April 16 The state cor

of Phoenix to water users living out

dered by Judge Stanford in the case
of the city against the commission
which was argued and submitted Sat
urday. The case grew out of action brought
one year ago when the city had some
difficulty with subscribers for city wa
ter living on streets outside the city
limits proper.' The corporation com
mission set a rate which did not meet
with the approval of the city commis
sion, and the result was a court ac

MIAMI POSTOFFICE THIRD
MIAMI, April 16 The United States
postoffice department's report on the
postal savings of the country, just re
ceived by Postmaster Tom Feeney,
shows some very interesting facts
in regard to the standing of Miami
in Uncle - Sam's big banking insti
tution. : -
The postoffice of Miami stands
third in the state of Arizona in the
amount of money on deposit, and
has nearly double that of Phoenix.
The postal savings of the Miami
office are larger than at- least 20
of the leading cities of as many
states in the east. They are larger
than any city in Arkansas, Georgia or
Idaho, and there are only five cities
in California which have larger de
posits. And in Illinois, ' with her
many big cities and manufacturing
centers, there are only four cities
which have larger postal savings de
posits than Miami.

SENATOR SMITH IS GUEST
PHOENIX, April 16. Two speakers
at the Kiwanis luncheon today noon
made the meeting one of the best in
many weeks. Milton Carlson, hand
writing expert, was the first speaker
introduced. He is here for a few days
testifying in a federal case. During the
course of his talk he told of many in
teresting incidents regarding the man
ner in which checks and legal aoc-a-ments
are forged and the manner in
which the forgery is detected and
proven by handwriting experts, of
which there are but a few in practice
in this country.
Senator Mark A. Smith was next in
troduced. He began by telling of the
marked maijner in which Phoenix has
progressed and grown 6incp his last
visit here. Of his many acquaintances
here during the times as far, back as
1880, he said that but a few remained.
These pioneers, he said, were largely
responsible for the stable estaoli3h
ment of the present city of Phoenix.
He said that. In -his opinion, the rail
roads should be returned to their orig
inal owners, the men who were cap
able of running the railroads for the
interests of the country at large. Salt
River valley cotton, he said, was con
sidered at Washington the best cotton
grown in the world and it was this cot
ton which was selected above all oth
ers, when linen in large quantities was
unobtainable, for the manufacture of
airplane wings and balloons.
TRIAL OF FAIN SET
PHOENIX, xpril 16. The trial of
Jesse C. Fain, formerly special agent

for this afternoon in the federal court.
Fain is charged with misusing govern
ment funds entrusted to him. His case
has been postponed from one session
of the federal court to another during
the past year, because of various cir
cumstances. A Man

STRIKERS URGED TO
RETURN BY BURLESON
Operators- Assured Increase
Will Be Granted if Re- j
quest Is Just
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 16. Steps
toward settlement of the strike of
New England telephone operators
were taken today by Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson and Secretary Tumulty.
Each official urged the strikers to
return to work immediately and sub-
! mit their demands to the general man
ager of the New England Telephone
and Telegraph company.
The operators were assured that
their application would be acted
upon promptly after its submission
to the general manager of the com
pany. In a statement given out late today
after a conference with Secretary Tu
multy, Mr. Burleson declared that the
postoffice department was not freeto
grant wage increases which would
have to be paid for by the public
"without carefully inquiring into the
relations between revenues and expen
ditures" of the company. He prom
ised, however, that if the increases
were found to be "just and reason
table," they would be granted, even if
the charges to the public had to be
advanced.
Mr. Burleson warned the strikers
that unless they returned to work at
once the people of New England,
"now suffering so seriously from the
loss of service," would turn against
them and would be "les3 likely to give
the employes the support necessary
to warrant favorable government ac
tion " ' v

Refused to Accept Steel Prices
Not to Effect Purchase
of Other Supplies
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, April 16. Walker D.
Illnes, director general of railroads,
addressing the National Lumber
Manufacturers' association today said
he wanted to make it clearly under
stood that although he had refused to
accept the schedule of steel prices re
cently announced after conferences of
the federal industrial board and repre
sentatives of the steel industry, the
railroad administration was going
ahead making its necessary pur
chases In every line of industry. The
statement was called forth by R. a.
Long of Kansas City, who with other
members of the association discussed
with Mr. Hines the refusal to approve
the steel prices. Mr. Long said the
position of the railroad administration
had led the public to believe the prices
were not low enough and that when
people held up improvements awaiting
lower prices the result would be the
damming up of business.
"The government has obligated It
self to keep up the scale of mainten
ance equal to that during the test per
iod before the war," said Mr. Hines.
-The result is that we will have, to
buy more material and will have to do
more work than the railroads would
do under private management."
Refuses to Recede
The director general discussed the
situation freely, refusing to recede
from his position. His approval of the
prices he said would be in effect an
endorsement to the American public
that the prices were fair. He refused
to take any such responsibility be
cause he had not been convinced" that
the prices were as low as they should
be
Mr. Hines however, accepted a sug
gestion that the public should know
which individual speakers said it did
not know that the railroads were go
ing ahead buying supplies. The di
rector general said that the import
ance of public statement of policy
with respect to purchases had beet
emphasized and added, "I shall be
glad to consider the form and manner
in which it ought to be made; be
cause I can see the point."
The discussion started when Mr.
Long after receiving permisson' from
1IT. nines 10 guesuuu mm, aticu,
Prices Too High
"How do we know or, rather, mora
directlv. how does Mr. Hines know
that the price as applied to steel pro
ducts, is not a reasonable price?"
"The industrial board, the majority
of it, believed that the steel interests
would not make any lower prices,"
said Mr. Hines. "That was the real

AMERICAN VOTES FOR
W0LIEI1 ADVOCATE IS
DEPORTED BY BRITAIN
Activities in Favor of Ireland
Bring Action Against
Miss Troy
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, April 16. The deporta
tion from the United Kingdom of Miss.
Lillian Scott Troy of San Francisco,
an American suffragette, is announced
Miss Troy was a friend of Baron
Lewis von Horst. formerly of San
Francisco, who was interned by the
British government in August, 1914.
Miss Troy, it is said,' .worked inde
fatigably to obtain the realease of
Baron yon Horst.
She is the only American of any
prominent in England to suffer de
portation and the case is exciting con
siderable interest hre. It is .said that
before the war Miss Troy and Baron
von Horst worked for the woman suf
frage cause and also assisted in flood
ing Ameiican newspaper offices here
with propaganda on behalf of home
rule for Ireland, coupling it, it is
charged,, with the suggestion that Ire
land and German should work to
gether. I
Miss Troy was' a member of the!
Women's Lyceum club and ' a close
friend of Ann Martin of Nevada, a
prominent American suffragist, who
is also a member of the Lyceum club.
Miss Martin was arrested in London
in 1910 for assaulting a policeman.
The order of deportation was based,
it is said, not on any one alleged ac
tion,, but on an accumulation of acts
which the authorities considered
made her an 'undesirable sojourner
here. In this connection her out
spoken ideas on the Irish situation,
her pronounced views on the rights
bf labor and frequent clashes with
the government were cited P
Miss Troy is well known to labor
leaders in London and they commend
her for her relief work in the Ber
mondsey district, for the wives and
families of dock strikers. The Croy
don branch of the associated society
of engineers has adopted a resolution
calling for a one-day strike of all or
ganized workers in that district as a
protest against her deportation.

Mining and Financial News
SY REVIEW
WW VflRk' inrll 1C Th a nhi-lmi-
iacior in me turtner advance or quot
ea -vaiaes on tne stock excnange to-
ay was tne speecn in tne nouse oi
commons of the British premier, which
confirmed the opinion prevailent in
financial circles that the peace nego
tiations were near conclusion.
Revival of local labor difficulties
and Increasing conjecture respecting
impending industrial dividend pay
ments prompted caution by traders,
even though these conditions were
neutralized by easrier money tenden
cies and the auspicious launching of
the "Victory" loan.
Apart from United States Steel,
which rose almost a point to 100
aDi fell back to 9S, the bulk of the
dealings once more centered in ship
pings and oils, equipments showing
more activity.
Metals improved for a time. Sales
amounted to 1,300,000 shares.
Sterling, franco and lired moved
more advantageously to this market,
but the London rate rallied. Call
money ruled at 534, against yester
day's 6 per cent rate. ,
' Liberty 3's were strong, others
shading. The general - bond market
was irregular and featureless. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $12,875,
000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 16. Corn averaged
lower in price today owing mainly to
chances of a harbor tie up at New
York and of clearim weather through
out the corn belt. Prices close! ner
vous, varying fromfc off to c ad
vance, with May $158 to $1.58 and
July $1.51 to $1.72.
Oats finished unchanged to c
down, and provisions at a decline of
20 cto 70c.
Weakness in the corn market was
the most evident right at the outset.
Bear took promjft advantage then of
the serious conditions wacing s-hip-
pers as a result of the general strike
of New York marine workers looked
for tomorrow.
Selling pressure, though developed
on all the hard spots ,and kept the
market unstable.
Seeding delays prevented any im
portant sag in the oats market.
Provisions, like corn, reflected un
certainty connected with New York
harbor troubles emand visibly slack

DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS
SEEN AT LYRIC TODAY
Douglas Fairbanks in a new Art
craft picture entitled "Headin South"
in a thrilling tale of two borders
Mexican and Canadian dealing with
the capture of a notorious band of
Mexicans who defy all laws and gov
ernmental warnings.
The scenario is by Chief Director
Allan Dwan, presenting Fairbanks in
a mysterious character who trails his
man from Canada to Mexico and
eventually turns him over to the au
thorities. There is an undercurrent
of fascinating mystery that runs
through the story, with a strong ele
ment of suspense that is maintained
to the very last scene of the picture.
According to Author Allan Dawn the
public seems to prefer characteriza
tions rather than being overburdened
with plot, and in "Headin' South"
Fairbanks appears in his most inter
esting portrayal.
Fairbanks is an expert horseman.
and his riding scenes at the head of
200 cowboys are intended to thrill the
most blase patron of a theater. , The
real Mexican border at Nogales was
selected as the background for "Head-
in South," disclosing views of con
ditions that will cause endless com
ment.
For these scenes a special train was
chartered from Los Angeles to No
gales which included eight Pullmans
and 12 freight cars, transporting over
200 people and an equal number of
horses, among which was "Smiles,"
the famous Fairbanks pony, who has
a number of strenuous scenes.
"Ginger." the Alaskan malamute,
who is Fairbanks' favorite dog, was
taken on the trip and on several oc
casions was given up for lost when he
was on a hunt for prairie dogs. Adv.

REVOLT GOES TO JURY
Testimony Shows I'Arrest of

PROSECUTION ENDS
CHAMBERLAIN CASE
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, April 16 Following a
day of grilling cross examination by
government attorneys of Col. Freder
ico Cervantes, alleged leader of the
military expedition which the govern
ment claimed vas Bet on foot to in
vade Mexico, the trial of Colonel Cer
vantes, Rafael Iturbide, Manuel Icaza,
Fernando Liceaga and eight others,
closed late today and the case given
to .the jury.
It developed during the closing day
of the trial that the arrest of these
men at the Socorro, Texas, ford on the
night of March 18 probably saved
their lives as the Mexican government
troops from Juarez had planted three
machine guns on the Mexican side of
the ford with orders to the federal sol
diers to fire on the expedition as soon
as it crossed the border. Advance in
formation of the alleged expedition
was furnished the Mexican govern
ment by Lieut. Col. Jose de la Rosa,
a secret service agent among the al
leged filibusters.
During the direct examination of
Colonel Cervantes today he claimed to
have been going to Mexico to spread
thi propaganda of the Mexican liberal
alliance, which was organized in- New
Yoik and has branches in Los Angeles,
Lardedo, Brownsville, San Antonio, El
Paso and other American cities. He
also said Gen. Felipe Angeles, the
head of the alliance, was in Mexico to
make speeches in favor of the alliance
and had no army at present.
He admitted receiving a message
from General Angeles on March 12
saying he, Angeles, 'was marching
south to confer with other rebef lead
ers and persuade them to subordinate
themselves to the alliance as Francis
co Villa had done." He said Angeles
had persuaded Villa to cease killing
his prisoners of war, to respect lives
and properties of foreigners and that
Anjreles had gone to Mexico to "civil
ize Villa" which, he said, he had suc
ceeded in doing.
The government attempted to prove
by a letter purported to have been
written by Mrs. Angeles to General
Angles that Angeles is conducting a
military campaign against the Mex
ican government and that Cervantes
and his followers were going to join
him.

BED GROSS SENDING
MILLION YARDS OF
GLOTH TO BALKANS
SALONIKI, March 11. (Correspon
dence of the Associated Press.) To
meet the great need of clothing
throughout the Balkan states, the
American Red Cross commission to
tte Balkans is sending to Serbia, Ru
mania, Montenegro and Albania mil
lions of yards of cloth, thousands -of
sewing machines, large quantities of
thread, needles and buttons and hun
dreds of tons of old clothing. . These
things will be apportioned among the
countries according to the extent of
destitution. The commission is also
shipping large amounts of food to va
rious points in the Balkans which
have suffered from the German occu
pation. .
ir any one of the Balkans goes
unclad or unfed," said Lieut. Col.
Henry W. Anderson, director of Red
Cross activities in the near east, "it
will be only because we lack the trans
portation facilities to reach the re
moter Interior sections. We have garn
ered up millions of pieces of clothing
and . thousands of tons of food from
every nook and corner of Europe and
will rush them to those sections of
the Balkan states which are most in
need. .
"We have taken over the surplus
stocks of relief supplies held by the
American Red Cross commission to
Italy. We have also had diverted to
our use, for distribution in the Balkan
peninsula, large quantities of material
intended for use in France and other
countries during the war. One of the
principal items is condensed milk, of
which we are ' shipping more than
3,000,000 cajx3. This doubtless will
save thousands of starving children."

THE ARIZONA BISBEE COPPER CO. OF BISBEE, ARIZONA, OR
GANIZED UNDER THE LAWS O? THE STATE OF ARIZONA;.
19 claims, or 380xacres, situated in the Warren Mining District, in
the same district and locality as the Wolverine, White Tail Deer, Night
Hawk and Boras mines, all of which are in ore and their stock selling at
or above par. f '
At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the above Company,
held here on Monday, April 14, 1919, they agreed to put 50,000 shares
of this stock on the market at 50 cents per share, par value $1.00, and
non-assessable.
Heretofore this Company has been a close corporation, all equip
ment and sinking up to date has been . financed by the Company person
ally. There are equipments on the ground at the present time to sink
to the depth of one thousand feet, all paid for, and in excellent condi
tion and leaving, a substantial cash balance on hand.
The money derived from the sale of this new issue of stock will be
used for additional work that has been mapped out at this meeting.
The public of late has gone mad over oil stocks and a great many of the companies
that have sold stock have proven to be failures or wild cat schemes of the worst kind.
Men that work or have worked in the copper mines know copper and its value; also ;
the future of it and its prospects." '
Why should you send your money out of the state to let some one else Invest it for
you in something you know nothing about "or where It Is going to, when there is opportunity,
here to' make money?
You may be promised fabulous returns on your investment, but how many realize
those promises? Ask the men that have been there.
Don't you think it good conservative business Judgment to put your money Into some
thing here at home, something you know and understand? This property is here you can
go and look it over and come to your own conclusions as to its future. If location or surface
showing amount to anything, this is the making of a big mine.
You all know what 50 cents has done for its investors in the making of the big pro
ducers here today. 1 "
There never has been any wild catting in this district, nor has there ever been a failure
in making a mine in this district when a shaft ha3 been sunk. ' Now, why don't you take all
this into consideration and take advantage of this offer? You all know the men that are
connected with this Company; if you don't, sea me and I will tell you. These men are sound,
conservative business men, that made their maney in the mines and large property holders
of this district and have lived here for years.
There is a two compartment standard shaft and to date are down 245 feet and making
from 4 to 5 feet a shift. On May 1 there will be an additional sh'ift put on so as to rush the
work. The Company's intention is to cut a station at 300 feet and start to drift and cross-cut
but at the same time continue to sink. -
Now, remember this, there are only 50,000 shares that I have to put
on the market, and no more, and 1 assure you that when this is gone
there will be no more at that price. Now, it is up to you to take advant
age of this offer, as 50,000 shares will not last long in this district. Yours,
