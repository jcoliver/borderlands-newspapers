Hard fighting continued in the bat-J

of Cambrai.
Unofficial reports late in the day
Indicated the probability that General
Byng's troops had wrested possession j
of the hotly contested Bourlon wood '
from the Germans and had recaptured '
the town of Moe'uvres. The village
of Fontaine, less than three miles
from Cambrai, was reported in flames,
suggesting the probability of an im
pending German retirement from that
place.
Resisting Desperately
The Germans are resisting desper
ately the British advance, which, is
being pressed most energetically on
this east-to-west front. General Byng's
evident intention is to -drive in be

(By Review Leased Vire)
BRITISH ARMY HEADQUARTERS
IN FRANCE, Nov. 24. The Germans
have been rushing guns to the Cam
brai setcor, as far as possible from
other parts of the line, as they have
suffered serious losses in artillery. The
counter battery work of the British
has been most successful from the be
ginning and prisoners admit that a
large number of their guns rave been
knocked out. No accurate acc'junt
has been made as ye: of the captured
booty In British hands but consider- j
able portion of the guns are heavies.
Innumerable machine guns were also
captured.
The work of the British air service
since Tuesday has been magnificent, j
.Because or atmospneric conditions tne
airmen have been forced to fly exceed
ingly low. This has placed them with
in the range nt only of the machine
guns but of the rifles.
The enmy airmen have not been in-1
aciive and numerous battles have tak
en place in the midst of laiden clouds.
The Germans have suffered consider
able losses in machines. One Britisn
brigade of planes, has in fignting be
fore Cambrai, raised its total of ene
my planes shot down during tbe year
to four hundred.
Tanks Work Fine.
The w-ork accomplished by the tanks
has had a bad effect on the morale 'Jl
the German troops, according to pris
oners. When the tanks made their
first appearance on the western front
they filled the Germans with dismay.
This fear diminished, however, be
cause of tne belief that the artillery
tould cope with the iron monitors. The
great numbers of tanks thrown into
Tuesday's attack made it impossible
for the German artillery to deal with
them, and as a result something of the
old fear came back to the enemy infantrymen-.
Smash Barbed Wire.
The tanks have come through thus )
far 'with losses remarkably small, in
view of the vigorous warfare they car
ried deep into the enemy territory.
Their greatest feat was the smash
ing of the deep strung of barbed wire
before the Hindenburg line and the
manner in which they crossed ditches
and mounted through wooded eleva
tions like Bourlon wood has given add
ed evidence to their practicabili;y.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON.' Nov. 24. Severe
criticism of the persons responsible

wholly illegal and without authority
in law, either state or federal."
After extensive investigation of the
cause and circumstances surrounding
the copper miners' strike, the com
mission found that the deportations
were planned by a number of Bisbee
citizens, and although no disor
edr or violence had been threat
ened by the strikers. Most of the
men forcibly herded together and sent
out of the state on a special train of
box cars were law abiding American
citizens, the report said, and few were
Germans or Austrians.
No reference was made in the re
port to the question of whether any
were members or leaders of the In
dustrial Workers of the World.
The commission reported that the
deportation interfered with operation
of the selective draft law and sug

It was also found that the leaders in
the enterprise utilized the local office
of the Bell Telephone company and
attempted to exrcise a censorship

concerning the deportations from
reaching the outside world. This sit

YourThanksgiving Suit should
Be a Kuppenheimer
When you look at one of our Kuppenheimer Suits, we know that you are
going to look at the style and lines and all tfcaL But you are going to look
beyond that because you cannot afford to gamble on the life of your clothes.
Not the way things are today.
Take a good look at the lining and the way it is sewed in; feel the front and
note how well fortified it is against puckering and caving in, put. your hand
into the shoulder and see how well it is padded. Pnll a sleeve inside out
and see,how well it is sewed. Pull a trouser's leg inside out and note how
well the seams are finished off. These things are always found in
Kuppenheimer Clothes
And coupled with the finest of materials that the House of Kuppenheimer
uses, it is the very backbone of a suit
This sort of workmanship and material is not found in many makes of suits.
That is why we are glad to compare Kuppenheimers with other brands, for
the workmanship and values are always there.
Prices $20 to $32.50

HARDLY HAD A WELL
DAY IN SEVEN YEARS
Persuaded By Wife to Take
Tanlac He Gains 17 Pounds
and Troubles Are Gone
"My wife was determined fiat I
should try Tanlac, so one day while
J was away from h'jme she bought a
bottle and simply made me begin tak
ing it ajid the results are, I have actu
ally gained seventeen pounds and feel
better than I have in seven yrrars."
This is what C. C. Moore of 155 Etella
street. El Faso, Texas, says after using
a few bottles of the "Master Medicine."
"I had suffered from indigestion and
stomach trouble until my hoalih was
so shattered I couldn't enjov living at
all. In fact I hardly knew what it
was to have a well day in ."even years
until Tanlac straightened mo out. I
had gotten to where I couldn't eat any
thing or even drink water without suf
fering from it. I lived for months
on nothing bnt milk and other liquids
and these also caused ine all sorts of
trouble.
"I often got so weak and dizzy I
would fall on the streets unconscious
and when 1 came to myself I would be
at home in bed. I was very nervous
all the time, could scarcely sleep and
bad awful headaches. No one knows
how I suffered and although I spent
lots of money and tried everything I
knew of, nothing seemed to reach my
case or do me any gobd.
"I kept falling ofT in weight and the
day I started on Tanlac I weighed only
one hundred and nineteen pounds. I
commenced to feel better in a few
days after I began taking Tanlac and
bave gradually picked up ever since. I
now weigh one hundred and thirty-six
pounds bave gained seventeen
pounds in weight and what I bave
gained in health and strength is more
than I can tell. I can now eat what
I want, as much of it as I please with
no bad feelings afterwads. My head
aches are broken up, I sleep like a log
and simply feel like a different man."
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie

PASSPORT LAW, GOT HIM
Patron's of the postoffice who went
in there early yesterday morning were
surprised to see that the janitor has
failed to do his duty and the place was
not swept cut as usual and there was
other evidence that Simon Escobada,
who had been on the job for about
seven years had failed to show up. In
quiry disclosed the fact he had gone
to Naco in search 'jf his daughter aged
about 14 years, who mit was reported
to him had gone there with a Mexican.
He left and wen; across the line with
out reporting at the immigration office
and when he got ready to come back
there was nothing doing. He was fin
ally admitted to this side after the im
migration 'officers had been advised of
the facts in his case. His daughter
had not let; town but had gone to stay
with a girl friend without the formali
ty of notifying her father.
NOW HAS FULL QUOTA
The old First Arizona Infantry regi
ment, now the 158th United States In
fantry and stationed at Camp Kear
ney, California, has been raised to full
war strength and now is I'jniposed of
3,600 men, according to word received
at the office of the adjutant general.
This is three time the size of the regi
ment in its state militia days. To com
mand these companies of nearly 300
men of which the regiment is compo;
ed, there are five lieutenants, three
Crst, and two second lieutenants, be
sides the captain for each company.
The 158th regiment is also completely
supplied in equipment and is ready for
service at the front, being one of the
best trained regiments of the old na
tional euard in the country, havfhe had
more actual el per lent e on the border
than any except a very few.
EVERY ONE MUST ANSWER
There have been many inquiries
made to the local draft board during
the past few dars as to whether men
exempted on the first draft would have
to fill out and send in their copies of
the questionaire which are soon to be
mailed to every man. Every man or
military age will have to answer the
questionaire, according to a member of
the board. All the previous exemp
tions are null and void, and every
man is eligible for the national army
until he again is exempted from ser
vice under the new regulations. Prep
arations are being made for the next
call which is now expected to be issu
ed sometime in February. No grounds
can be found for the rumor afloat that
no drafted men will be allowed to vol
unteer for any branch of the service
after December 15. N'j such -order has
been received from the war depart
ment.
IN BAD AGAIN
Frank Brown, who was at one time
a resident of the Warren District, but
who for the past year or so has beld
various positions around Ph'jenix, and
is at present employed as commission
er at that place, was arrested at Lords
burg a few days ago according to re
port and was fined $30 for carrying
concealed weapons. Deputy Sheriff
Simpson of Tucson was on his way
back fj Tucson with a Drisoner named
Pecklo, whom he went after at Silver
City, and had reached Lordaburr when
Brown came up and started to abuse
Pecklo. Simpson ordered Brown to
stop and Tecklo called Simpson's at
tention to the fact that Brown had a
gun In his pocket. Simpson tuok the
gun from Brown and then handed It
to an officer, who took Brown away
and at the same time told Pecklo that
he would have to remain as a witness.

ChickenDick Wills
His All to
Needy
T. A. Hughes, the Bisbee insurance
man, was named administrator for the
Andrew Hartman estate one day the
past week .and thereby hangs a tale.
The late Andrew Hartman was bet
ter known as ' "Chicken" Dick. He
lived up in Dubacher canyon and kept
chickens, hence the title before his
name. Many stories have been writ
ten of him, but the last is the best.
When "Chicken" Dick died he left a
will bequeathing all his goods and
chattels and real estate to the Cop
per Queen hospital. He had been
treated at the institution at various
times before be died of the incurable
disease of cancer of the lungs and
just to show his appreciation, either o!
his own personal treatment there, or
the treatment In general that such an
institution affords to the wounded and
weary of the world, this quaint old
man of the mountains made the hos
pital his heir.
Besides a li'jrse and buggy and
housebold 'goods and a lot of chickens,
Hartman left three or four houses In
the district of more or less value. At
a recent conference between the ad
ministrator and officials of the Cop
per Queen it was ab'out decided to
turn all the property to money and
then use this legacy to establish a
memorial in the hospital in the name
of the donor.
Hartman, for all his quaint and quiet
ways, had a forceful character and an
eventful life. He enlisted in the Union
army from Illinois as a drummer boy
at the age of thirteen. Many a long
year ago he drifted to the mountains
and high places of Arizona. They tell
many stories about him. But no man
of all the many, high and low, who
have come here and gone, could have
a better story told of him than this
last tale of "Chicken" Dick Hartman,
wh'j left his small possessions to a hos
pital. It is not how much you eave,
but how well you leave it.
This old man had been cared for Jn
the hospital of the Copper Queen, and,
when death cajue close to his door to
tell him he would not have to suffer
but a little while longer, he resolved
that he would do a little good in the
world after his death.
It may have helped and strengthened
the old man, before he went away, as
he thought that small fruits of his toil
and saving would be used to help some
other pilgrim from the mountains, 'or
the plains, when sickness laid its
heavy hand on him as he lay in cabin,
camp "or hotel. So he made his will in
favor of the Copper Queen.
The Queen is rich and great, but no
hospital in the world ever has enough
with which to do all that it is called
upon to do, and Ilartnian's legacy will
be used as the directors think he
would have it used, as a memorial to
help some one who needs help nfosL
Many men die and leave fine houses
and broad lands but few men die and
leave a bed behind in a hospital where
the unfortunate may bave care and
paling hand.

The Sunday Sermon
At present seven hostess houses are in operation by
4the war council of the V. W. C. A. in large camp centers
and twenty-five more are in course of . construction.
Eleven more have been called for. The council expect
to spend one-half of the four million dollar war fund on
hostess houses, emergency, houses for employed girls and
war work abroad.
An idea of the scope and energy of the campaign by
United States government agents against the I. W. W.
in the Kansas oil fields may be gained from the fact
that three thousand arre&ts were contemplated unless
the agitators left the state. This 'wholesale government
raid upon these wobblies is taken by Bisbee as an offi
cial O. K. of our deportation of July 12.
Senator Claude Swanson, member of the senate com
mittee on naval affairs, declares that the United States
navy is fit and ready for war. According to the Virginia
senator the naval force i now number more than a quar
ter of a million men and 250 merchant vessels have been
armed and 787 naval vessels are in course of construc
tion. The health and spirits of the men are of the best
and their equipment already provided and the- training
of new men making line progress. In fine, declares
the optimistic senator. "The American navy in this war
will measure fully up to its highest standards of the
past."
Rain has again come to the aid of the hard pressed
Germans on the battle frcnt. Late dispatches from the
Cambrai sector indicate that the fine weather of the
preceding weeks had given place to a downpour the
second day of the battle. This will serve to check the
British advance and hamper the widening of the breach
in thVHindenburg line. Time and time again. rain has
robbed the British of the fruits of victory. What might
have been a vital blow at Cambrai has been turned Into
a local success on a bis scale. It was a brilliant victory
but not a decisive one. However, if the weather clears
and the attack continues, the pressure on the Italian
line may be relieved, and that, after all. Is probably
the main cause behind the tremendous blow at the
Cambrai line.
A well authenticated btory is told by a Loh Anjeles

men are dropping poisoned candy from their planes over
the Eelfort region and that many French children have
died horrible deaths from eating these deadly sweets.
It sounds unbeliereable. but surely this is no worse than
suffocating children in London by gas bombs dropped
from the air. There litis been nothing in Gcmitn ways
and means o far in t.h? war that ran he used to retute
tliis story. They have perpetrated every crime flgain.st
humanity that a fiend could conjure from the darkened
recesses of his soul. If they would cut off the hands of
Belgian 1kvs, why would they not poison French chil
dren? By their printed and spoken ethics nothing must
stand in the way of the German advance. Cathedrals.
cottages and children, all these have been victims by the
i
thousands of Prussian steel, flame and cruelly. And the
allies fight on with gr'm determination that will never
he stayed until the kafonr's legions have been broker
and destroyed.
"Then Benaiah, the son of Jehoida, went up and
fell upon him (Joab). and slew him; and he was
buried in his own house in the wilderness." I
Kings 2-34.
This etory of the slaying of Joab by Benaiah is one
of the great lessons of the Bible that applies so aptly
and so well to our present everyday life. It is the first
recorded narrative setting forth that now well known
fact that "the young must be served."
Joab had been David's chief captain all through his
stormy reign. He was the mightiest warrior of old Israel.
He led the king's armies in a hundred bloody battles and
never met with defeat He fought a hundred fights him
Belf with sword and spear and always killed hta enemy.
He was the acme and the essence of victory In the wars
of his time. Hard as Iron, strong as the west wind and
cruel as a barbed spear, war was Joab's trade by practice
and Inclination. He ' was feared throughout Israel and
adjacent tribes and nations. His invincibility had come
to be a" proverb in the land. For forty years he had
carried a sword In bis band and chain armor upon hii
back.
Anil then came this man Benaiah, a new man. a
young man, unknown end unsung, and killed the old
fighter without a struggle. Killed him with ease, buried
him, washed his hands and came away to serve the
king la his stead.
No details at .all are given of the old killer's last
fight, except that he fled from his slayer, and the 1m
pression is left that Benaiah finished him with ease
and dispatch.
David, just before his death bequeathed to his son,
Solomon, as a heritage, the death warrant of Joab.
Sounds strange that David should have thus rewarded
the man who had fought for him so long and so well.
But Joab had become as cruel and relentless as a tiger.
He had killed Absalom against David's expressed com
mand, and he had killed Abner, who was David's guest.
He had also plotted with the enemies of Solomon, David's
choice for his throne. So it was decreed that he should
die, and Benaiah was selected as the man to do the work.
No matter how high we climb or skillful we become
or fortunate we are, there is some one to take our place.
Some one to come and do a thing better than we ever
did. In our pride we tnink we are Indispensible. We
become cold and cruel and hard. We are obessed with
the idea that we cannot lose. We are the king's right
hand man. But along comes a Benaiah with his two
handed sword and his speed and bis youth and his
strength and we sink in the sea of life and do not leave
a ripple behind. This Becaiah sits in our place and men
bow before him. and talk of his prowess and forget that
we ever fought and won in the days of old.
The singer, the1 writer, the builder, the trader, the
chief captain, these tarry aVhlle in high places and then
they pass on to the lanu of shadows, and men come
after them who sing and wii9 and build and trade and
fight as well as they. Always there lurks In the ob
scurity of Young Man's Land a Benaiah waiting eagerly
for the chance to come forth on winged feet to take the
place of the best of us. But we are inclined to view
our own work with satisfaction and look with too kindly
eye upon our own powers and be too sura of our own
indispensible value to our firm, farm, fort or forge. And.
blinded by egotism, made arrogant by success and using
our power with a hard and heavy hand, we are easy prey
for Benaiah when he comes.
If Joab had curbed his natural ferocity and allowed
gentleness and mercy to find room in his heart he might
well have died as the king's man, full of honors and
renowned as the unbeaten captain of Israel to the end
But he lived only by the sword, and by the sword he
died.
Every man has a Benaiah waiting to take his place.
But we can live and act and buy snd sell and give and
take and rule and obey in such fashion that when our
Benaiah comes he will not appear before us like a spectre
of vengeance with a frown and a sword, but rather with
a smile of love and a sigh of sorrow at our departur?
and a friendly grasp of the hand and with head bowed
as he asks for advice and counsel.
Beware of Benaiah', for some day surely he will come.
Ah you live today so lie will come tomorrow.
Forced back to the . border of the Venetian plains,
the Italian soldiers who fled pell mell from the moun
tain passes before the German helmets, are no"w standing
like a granite walL rut a second time to the real test,
the Italian is making good. He may yet be all the
better for that awful drubbing at Balnsizza and his ter
rible retreat. He has been blooded aol, burned with
powder. Next spring he may go back over this ground
and knock again at the door of Laibach with a stronger
and more confident fist than he has raised against it

leg heralds a bombardment. Consid
erable movement behind the enemy
lines suggests the relief of a division.
It is by continual consideration of
such things as these that a comman
der deduces the plans of his oppo
nent.
The ordinary everyday observation
is embraced under three main heads
ground observation, kite balloons, ana
airplanes. Ground observation is work
which engages thousands of trained
soldiers every day of the year, and
it is the work of the men in these
ground observation posts to keep a mi
croscopic lookout over the enemy's
front-line trench system and its im
mediate vicinity. The work ot the
balloons and airplanes is generally
devoted to the enemy's artillery and
back areas. Conditions of ground ob
servation vary from tiiose of a roomy
out in the side of a hill on a summer
day, to those of a tall chimney, swing
ing through several feet in a storm
of sleet with a hostile battery contin
uously trying to level the chimney
with a well-aimed shot. The observer
has his maps, his glasses, his note
book and a telephone.
Observtr Sees Much
Looking out of his slit, be sees im
mediately before him his own trench
system, then a strip of land of greater
or less width, torn by shell holes,
withered by gas, covered with broad
masses of rusty wire. Beyond this
runs the irregular line of the hostile
front parapet, and behind this again
the complicated network, that is the
mass of enemy support, reserve and
communication trenches. In the back
ground stretches the enemy's reward
territory, dotted with ruined farms,
bare patches of wood and lines of
tree stumps that mark, a road. There
is no sign of movement save for a
smoking chimney or the white steam
of a moving train, far away in the
distance.
But in reality things ar happening
all the time, if one can only see them.
Suddenly a particular point in a weed
grown field catches the eye. Some
thing has moved, and a patient watch
ing through the telescope reveals a
regular succession of spadefuls of
earth being thrown from below the
surface. A new communication trench
IU1
is being dug, and daily watching wi
reveal the direction it is taking.
Speck Becomes Gun
A morning inspection of the hostile
parapet reveals a speck of light color
that was not there the day before.
The speck seems to have grown dur
ing the night as each successive dawn
allows it to be seen; it is perhaps a
new machine emplacement. Some
thing that looks like a hedge appears
one morning across what was an open
field the previous night; it must be
a screen to hide something, and pro
longed study may discover what that
something is.
The ground observer's work is just
one drop in the streams of intelligence
that flow unceasingly along thousands
of channels to the central brain that
must determine their combined mean

RICHARDSON WELL
PLEASED WITH THE
WAR WORK CAMPAIGN
New Mexico is some state," de
clares A. B. Richardson, Bisbee Y. M
C. A. secretary, who returned yester
day from the war fund campaign, "not
only in size and square miles, in its
wonderful mountain rangeB, its cliff
dwelling monuments, and extensive
mineral deposits, but also in its people,
do in Americans and the Spanish Amer
icans, the latter of which compose
about sixty-five per cent of the state,
in the conduct of the War Work Coun
cil Campaign, which has been one big
task since early in October. I travel
ed over the entire state, visiting all of
the larger towns and more tensely
populated communities, presenting the
work and merits of the Red Triangle,
and I found a mighty response of the
New Mexicans. To be sure, the peo
ple over there are not too familiar with
the work of the association, there be
ing only two Organizations in the en
tire state, and for this reason consid
erable time and effort was of necessity,
expended in the education of the peo
ple to the function of the association
in war time. Then too, the great pro
hibition campaign was on, and we wi la
held the definite 'organization of our
forces until after that most import
ant issue had been rightfully settled at
the polls, and then we got down to bus
iness in a hurry.
"We had our headquarters at Albu
querque, and our organization consist
ed of district secretaries at nine other
points throughout the state. The very
best people of the state were interest
ed in the campaign, more than eight
hundred enlisted in committee service.

Ten Fatherless
Children Are
Adopted Here
That music warms the heart was
most aptly demonstrated Thursday
night at the dance given for the fath
erless children of France by the local
committe, of which Mrs. W. H. Bro
phy is chairman. Ten children were
adopted by the society and it is a cer
tainty that the future life of these
children is assured. '
Financially the dance was a suc
cess. Nearly four hundred dollars- was
received from tickets to the dance
and from sales of coffee, programs, ci
gars, badges and donations.
In addition to the children adopted
by the local society a number of the
children who have been left fatherless
as a result of the war, were adopted.
The following adopted a child for one
year: Mrs. Elanor Arthur, Douglas;
Mrs. Lucila McGregor. Bisbee; Mrs.
C. H. Lund. Douglas; Mrs. Martha
Huxtable and ' the Misses' Criniou,
Guthrie and Collins of the Warren
school. i
With these adoptions the state of
Arizona is now supporting 139 father
less French children. It is believed
by the local committee that more
adoptions will be made as soon as the
people of this country begin to realize
how badly these children need as
sistance. GRAVITY IS NOT
TEST FOR GASOLINE
"The popular opinion that specific
gravity (or degrees Beaunie) will suf
fice as a test for gasoline is unfortu
nately errorenous." says the United
Slates bureau of standards.
In commenting ou this statement re
cently, J. J. Sparks, head of the local
agency of the Standard Oil company,
said: "The reason gravity is mislead
ing as a test for gasoline is plain
enough when you understand that
boilin g points alone determine real
motor fuel efficiency. Gravity tells
nothing at all about boiling points and
their proper range and 'continuity.
"To be 100 per cent efficient, gaso
line must have its boiling points in a
continuous, unbroken, gradually rising
scries.
"In this connection it Is aUo impor
tant to note that only straight-dia-tiluled,
refinery gasoline can have its
boiling points in a continuous chain.
No mixture on earth could be con
cocted to contain all the hundreds of
necessary fractions. .Yet the gravity
of this mixture might be satisfactory,
thus deceiving any one depending on
gravity for motor fuel efficiency and
economy."

THRIFT STAMPS ARE
TO RESOLD AFTER
MONDAY, DEO. 3RD.
"Good morning, nice day; thrift
stamp, please."
"Beg pardon "
"Yes, nice little day sure; thrift
stamp, thatswhatisald!"
And Mr. Postoffice Patron will be in
his right senses too, when, after De

lady at the postal savings window
serves him a thrift stamp for the sli
ver quarter that be did not buy cigars
with. She may question the goodness
of the morning and the niceness 'of the
day but Mr. Patron is entitled to the
thrift stamp.
Investment In war savings certifi
cates will be as simple as the pur
chase of postage stamps under a plan
announced by Secretary McAdoo for
the nation-wide certificate sales cam
paign, which he will inaugurate on
Monday, December 3rd, of which Post
master Bailey as advised yesterday.
Any person may invest amounts as
small as twenty-five cents at a time at
posttofflces, banks or trust companies,
at most railroad stations, stores and
factories and at many other public
places where accredited persons will
act as authorized selling agents. After
the sales begin the certificates may
be purchased at any time. At the
average 1918 selling price such Invest
ments in certificates will yield four
per cent interest compounded quarter
ly. The certificates will be dated,
January 2, 1918, and will mature Janu
ary 1, 1823, or five years after date.
The entire wealth and security ot the
United States Is behind them.
Exempt From Taxation.
The tax exemption provisions of
these certificates, particularly from
the standpoint of the purchaser of
smaller amounts, makes the invest
ment attractive. No person may pur
chase at one time more than 1100
worth or hold at one time not) re than
$1,000 worth of these certificates.
These obligations of the United
States will be evidenced by stamps of
two demon inationa a war savings
stamp costing from $4.12 to $4.23 ac
cording to the month in which purchas
ed and having a maturity value of $5
and a thrift stamp costing twenty-five
cents.
During December. 1917. and January
1918, War Savings stamps will be
sold for $4.12 each. At the begiir.in-j
of each of the succeeding months Ksf
1918, starting February 1, the cost of
a stamp will increase one cent per
month. All war savings stamps is
sued during 1918 will mature on Janu
ary 1, 1925, when they will be redeem
ed at $5.00 each. The difference be
tween the purchase price paid at anv
time during 1918 and $5.00 represents
the Interest the government w".i pay
the holder.
$17.60 Net Profit.
With the first war savings stamp
bought by the purchaser wilt obtain
without expense a war-savings certifi
cate containing spaces for tiveury s'ic'i
stamps. If the twenty spaces are filled
during December. 1917, or January,
1918, the cost to the purchaser will
have been $4.12 fOr each stamp or
$82.40 for the filled certificate and on
January 1, 1823. the government will
redeem the certificate at $100, giving
the holder a net profit of $17.60 for the
use of his money.
Thrift stamps costing twenty-five
cents each are from time to time as
purchased to be affixed to thrift cards,
which will be supplied without cost.
Thrift stamps will not bear Interest
but a thrift card when filled at a cost
of $4.00 may be exchanged tor a war
savings stamp bearing interest at 4
per cent compounded quarterly mere
ly by turning the card into the post
office, bank or other sales agency and
paying the difference between $4.00
and the current price of a war savings
8 tamp. The thrift stamp feature of
the plan will afford an unparalleled op
portunity for the rtnall investor to
save in order to place his or her money
at interest with absolute safety.
May Surrender Certificate.
The privilege of surrendering a cer
tificate to the government and receiv
ing the cost thereof plus interest at
the rate of about 3 per cent has been
provided for the convenience of thone
who may have bought certificates and
later on find themselves In need Of
their money. It is hoped, however,
that this privilege will be exercised
only in cases of necessity Upon ten
day's written notice after January 1
next postmatter will pay off certifi
cates at their cost to purchasers plus
an increase of one cent a month on
each war savings s'amp on the certifi
cate surrendered, as shown by a table
of value appearing On the certificate.
Under this plan it will be absolutely
impossible for a certificate or the
stamps thereon to depredate In value,
nor can there ever be any question
that It is worth the price shown there
on. That is the story of the system un
der which the sale aud redemption of
war-savings certificates will operate.
There can be no tecbniralities to ton
fuse, no change of depreciation In
value, nor any operations which any
chilj can read and cannot compre
hend.
Money deprived from war having in
vestmen s will be uted to meet the ex
penses or Ihe war. The greater pan
of these, funds will be expended will!

?OPULATION INCREASED
The population of Warren was in
creased on Friday by the arrival of a
new son at the home of Mr. and Mrs.
I. Fred Reeves. All concerned are
ioing nicely.
MORE ENGINES ARRIVE
Two more powerful engines for work
on the Sacramento Hill arrived yester
day and were taken to the machine
shop to be made ready for use on the
various tracks that now run atound
that hill. The company now has ten
of these little Moguls and it will keep
them all busy hauling away the rockB
and dirt that is loosened every day by
the large number of blasts that are set
off.
DOING CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE
The heavy blasts that are set off on
Sacramento Hill are doing consider
able damage daily in different parts
of the disirict In a number of build
ings the continued par has loosened
plaster and caused it to fall while in
close proximity to the hill windows are
broken almost daily by the concussion.
Strangers who are stopping over night
in the hotels are alarmed over the
loud reports and mare tiiau one has
called the clerk to find, out if it was
not someone trying to blow up the
:own, a bank or something else.
One hears a lot of talk about pro-

I Warr?n these days, but did it ever
occur to you. Mr. Warren District
Citizen, that Lowell, the centre town
of the district, was enjoying some
prosperity of her own right now that
is the real article? There's not an
empty house or store building ip the
town, and citizens' there "are consid
ering a draft for carpenters and ma
sons. Lowell streets are crowded with
traffic all day long and her stores
are busy. Bank deposits, according
to J. M. Lyons, cashier of the Bank
j of Lowell, show that the town has
i recovered entirely m a business way
r from the strike and the volume of
business is as large, if not larger.
than ever before in the history of
the town.
Merchants Well Pleased
The opening of the Den mine gave
a decided Impetus to business in and
around Lowell. This industry alone
placed 100 men on construction work.
Merchants are looking forward to a
fine holiday trade. F. W. Ritter, o
the Lowell drug store, declared that
business was good. Mr. Ritter and H.
H. Liley, of the Central pharmacy,
will soon establish a drug store in
Warren. It is needed' there.
J. M. Brophy, one of tbe gamest
and most optimistic business men in
the district, declared that his garage
and carriage company business was
better than it ever had been and he
is confidently looking forward to 1918
as tiie banner year of the district.
Has Been Banner Seasno
Mauager Rodgers. of the Wlllard
Service station, declares that October
shoved a gain of 500 per cent in busi
ness ever aay previous month since
their business was established in Lo
well last April.
When this station was first opened
for business in the district. Mr. Rodg
ers did all the testing and repairs
and charging of batteries. Now he
has two assistants and they are busy
svery minute.
Mr. Rodgers, by the way, is a firm
believer in the fine results that fol
low advertising. He gives Tbe Re
view a lot of credit for his success
in business. "If you have something
to sell." he said, "whether it is brains
or merchandise, tbe best way is to tell
the people about It."
Any Warren or Bisbee citizen who
has occasion to drive through Lowell
every day cannot help but be im
pressed by her busy streets and stores.
Autos are parked solidly along the
curb of the main street and one has
to crawl through the traffic.
Another sure index of prosperity fat
the picture show. The Central the
atre is doing a fine business and is
showing tbe highest class and costli
est films In the market
Many improvements are being made
in both the business and residence
sections of Lowell. As Bisbee and
Warren grow, so will Lowell, the con
necting point and half way ground be
tween them, increase in size and importance.

An upswing in fJie copper shares at the end of ihe week, in which Magma
Copper was the leader, on the strength of the recent splendid fere development
on the 100X level, is accepted as marking the beginning of the return of con
fidence in the general situation as affecting the metal. It is -possible that
there is reflection in the improvement or reports that the price fixed for
copper for the next quarter by the government may be higher. Necessarily
In such event there is reflection also of satisfaction that labor matters have
been adjusted for a consHerable period and that the mines will be able to
go to maximum and keep there. Any suel. summing up also means that
labor's wages will continue undisturbed.
In the Warren dist-ict all conditions are at this time in harmony with the
improved outlook indicated above. Ore production during last week attained

in the saddle. Development work is going along witn me usual manner ui ,

War Taxes On Mining Cos.
Ably Discussedby Local Man
T. O. McGrath Lets Much Light Upon Mooted Question of
Large Interests to Property Ownets and Investors What
Is the Value of Product Mined? Interprets Internal
Revenue Ruling
T. O. McGrath. cr Shattuck Arizona.
In the current h-sue or the Engineer
ing and Mining Journal, sets ror;h an
exceptionally clear analysis or :!e war
taxes on mining companies. The ar
ticle s in response to an editorial ap
pearing in an earlier number or the
Engineering and Mining Journal. In
the current number the Journal prin'a
a column editorial acknowledging Mr.
McGrath's article and tii" issue takpn
therein of the previous editorial, the
whole comprising much of an acces
sion to the views of Mr. McGrath,
whos-.e article is copitd from the Jour
nal as follows:
An editorial in the Journal of Oc
tober 27. dealt with the question of de
pletion allowance as defined by the
commissioner of internal revenue, as
follows:
In the case of mines, a reasonable
amount for the depletion thereof not
to exceed the market value in the
mines or the product thereor which
has been mined and sold during the
year Tor which the return and com
putation was made.
The question arises: What is the
market value ln the mine or the pro
duct mined and sold during the year"
Apparently there can be only one in
terpretation or this clause; namely,
the deference between the cost of
extraction and the selling price or the
product, or the net operating profit
earned.
To illustrate: If I should make an
agreement with a mine owner to take
over his mine for one year's operation
and should pay him at the end of the
year the market value in the mine of
the product mined and sold during the
year's operation, less a certain per
centage for the use of my money. 1
certainly would pay him the differ
ence between what it cost me to ex
tract the product and the price at
which I sold the product, or the net
profit, less my commission.
Now. according to a literal interpre
tation one may deplete an amount
equal to his yearly operating profit,
and no more. Howt ver, if t.'ie Journal
had pone n little further into this rul
ing it would have found something In
teresting. For instance, ns to the t"
tal amount of depletion allowable, the
same ruling states: "Provided, that
when the sum of the annual allow
ances for depletion equals the original
capital invested, or in case of pur
chase prior to March 1, 1913, the fair
market value as of that date of the
mineral in place, no further allowance
on this account shall be made." The
black face type is mine.
Apparently not only may one ex
empt from taxation an amount equal
to his total operating earnings Tor
each year, but ir the property were
acquired prior to March 1. 1913. he
may continue to deplete his earnings
Tor each year until he has exempted
an amount equal to the "rair market
value or the mineral In place on March
1. 1913."
Whut is the Tair market value or
material in place in a mine on March
1. 1913? ir my interpretation or the
clause defining the amount or yearly
depletion allowable, is correct, then
the fair market value or the mineral
in place on March 1. 1913. would be
the difference between the operating
cost ot extraction and the market price
or metals on that date or the net value
or the ore in the mine according to
operating cost and ruling market
prices.
Therefore, in the case of a mining
company which had on March 1. 1913.
one million tons of 5' copper ore in
place, ami whose net operating cost
per pound was lOx-ents. ir the market
price or copper was 15 cents, a fair
market value of the mineral in place
on thnt date would have been cen's
per pound of copper. $. per ton of
ore, or VVOO.000 for the mineral in
place, and such a company would be
permitted, if it desired so to do. to
deplete its total operating earnings for
each year until $5,000,000 had been
allowed.
Thus it can readily be seen that the
only possibility of a company, whose
property had- been purchased prior to
March 1. 1913. paying any income or
war-profit taxes whatsoever during its
life, would be (a) that conditions
should change so as to make the min
eral in place ot greater value as taken
oat than it was on March 1. 1913; (b)
metalc holding at jrigures than the
price or March 1, 1913; (c) the op
erating costs being reduced below the
; cost used in the estimate; (d) the
' grade or Vre proving to be better than
estimated; or (e) that more tonnage
should be developed after March 1.
1913, than was estimated to be in
1 place cu that date. However, against
i these possibilities of a company's pay
! ing taxes at some remote period would
be (a) the chance that the value of
the mineral in place, as taken our.
might fall below the estimated value
iof March 1. 1913, caused by pricM
. or metals being lower than those on
: that date; (b) by operating cost in
creasing above that shown in the es
Uimate; (c) by the grade or ore prov
ing lower; or (d) the tonnage in place
! less. One or all or these causes mig'::t
' result in lowering tiie n-t value of
the mineral in place ns estimated on
' March 1. 1913, and no taxes would be
. paid.
I If t.'ie interpretation or the internal
l revenue department's ruling above set
. forth are correct, and the department
J sees fit to stand by them, other thing.
' being equal, the stocks of thise min
. ing companies whose properties were
I acquired prior to March 1. 1913, should
sell at a premium. The internal rev
enue department has recognized re
serves for depletion and depreciation
set aside out of earnings as capital
returned. If the reserve for depletion,
when the property was acquired prior
to March 1. 1913. is to be basrd upon
the net value of the mineral as of that
date, instead or the actual investment
in the property, how can such deple
tion reserve be a return or capital?

When We Strike Oil
During the past ten days we have devoted a great deal
of space in this paper to the. subject of "OIL IN Ari
zona" and particularly in reference to the shares of the
ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY.
' We have not concealed any of the facts the State of
Arizona has "a Corporation Commission all the facts
are placed before them and two of the Commissioners
have to pass upon the organization location of prop
erty plans of the Company and the possibilities of the
Company's ultimate success before a permit is granted
to sell the shares in this State.
The permit for the ARIZONA OIL & REFINING
COMPANY'S shares was duly signed by Hon. F. A.
Jones, Chairman, and Hon. A. A. Betts, both members
of the Commission. Both of these men made a careful
investigation of the Company's plans and interviewed
the Company's Geologist, Mr. E. A. Edwards, the man,
who is so highly endorsed by Doheny and the Union
Oil Company.
The General Securities Investment Corporation, are not
the promoters of the ARIZONA OIL & REFINING
COMPANY, either directly or indirectly; they desire,
however, to publicly congratulate the officers and direc
tors of the Company and to commend the actions of
the officers to the people of Arizona, BECAUSE
While most of the new organizations take out one-half of their capital
stock at the start for "property" as they term it, not one share of the
ARIZONA OIL & REFINING COMPANY'S is promotion stock. Every
share issued is bought and paid for and the treasury receives the
money.
No officer or director is receiving one dollar of salary. No officer j
or director has a share of stock that has not been paid for. '
The Company has a deed for the property, and while the campaign,
for raising funds is only about two weeks old, the Company has over
five thousand dollars to start drilling and has assurance of from
ten to fifteen thousand dollars immediate money to continue drilling.
The sale of shares as outlined by us and accepted by the Board of
Directors will net the Company from (75,000 to S100.00Q. all of which
money is to be spent in drilling and proving to the "skeptics," the
"Doubting Thomases" that there is oil in the Chino Valley of Arizona.
We have been identified with Arizona stocks since 1906 we have
been identified with successes and failures no brokerage concern
can claim all successes. We des're to state POSITIVELY arid UN
QUALIFIEDLY that we have never seen a cleaner promotion than
the one offered by the officers of the ARIZONA OIL . REFINING
COMPANY.
If they win out and we believe they will every share will be worth
a dollar to ten dollars, andeven teller than the winning of a few
dvilars a share, it will put Arizona en the map as an oil producing
State, adding millions of dollars to her mineral wealth.
There isn't an officer or director of the Company from H. G. Richard
son, County Attorney for Pinal County, and Hon. David F. Johnson,
State Treasurer, to E. A. Edwards, the Geologist, who is shirking the
responsibility. The Board of Directors and the management is a
"UNIT" working without remuneration to put Arizona on the map
as an oil State.
If you want to be among the majority the boosters for Arizona
help drill the first well close to the first discovery well nd thirty
dollars for a thousand shares might be worth thirty thousand dollars
in a very few months it's a chance you can't afford to let pass by.

Jerome District
Signs Agreements
Judge Ernest W. Lewis of Phoenix,
has just returned from the Jerome dis
trict where he went under appointment
from the government as mediator to
formulate an agreement between me
miners and operators which would in
sure the continuous 'operation of these
important properties at least during
the time of war. He has brought back
with him a copy of the agreement
reached, an agreement based upon the
work of the late Judge McBride, wno
was mediator in that district, with
some changes to make it conform to
the style of agreement reached in the
Globe-Miami and Clifton districts. The
most important section aside from
those framed by Judge McBride is that
which provides for a federal adminis
tration arbitrator. This arbitrator is
to act in a judicial capacity when dis
putes between the operators and the
workers arise, if such instances do
come up. He Is to hear complaints
from both sides and adjudge the right
in such Instances. The arbitrator for
the Jerome district is to be Joseph S.
Myers, who is also serving In like ca
pacity for the Globe district There are
to be two alternates to act in case he
is unable to do so. Aside from this
feature the agreement is said by Judge
Lewis to follow along the general lines
negotiated by Judge McBride during
the time he spent at Jerome. It is cal
culated to keep the properties upon a
stage of maximum production during
the course of the war and thus add to
the list of assured copper supply one
of the greatest copper fields in the
greatest copper states in the world.
HOMESTEAD ENTRY WHEN

The general land office department
of the interior has made public the fol
lowing letter addressed to registers
and receivers:
Sirs: You are advised that under
date October 20, 1917, the secretary
of the interior Instructed this office
as follows:
"I have received and considered your
memorandum of September 11, 1917,
(and accompanying papers, in the mat
ter of homestead entrymen who, sub
sequent to date of entry are placed
under judicial restraint; that, who,
because of conviction for a crime or
crimes are incarcerated in jails or
other institutions and thereby pre
vented from continuing residence up
on and improvement of their claims.
"I am of the opinion that such re
straint should not,, under the law, or
as a matter of policy, be held to ex
cuse compliance with the requirements
of the homestead law, but that such
conviction and restraint do not war
rant the cancellation or forfeiture of
the entry.
"I have therefore to direct that in
all such cases the entries shall, upon
the filing of evidence of such judicial
restraint, be placed in a state of sus
picion and so held until the termina
tion of the judicial restraint, where
upon the entryman shall be required
to comply with the requirements of
the applicable homestead laws as a
prerequisite to final proof and patent."
BUTTE CONCRETING.
Shaft Improvements Conform With
Those With Which Bisbee
Pioneered.
BUTTE, Mont.. Nov. 24. Far reach
ing improvements tn the matter of
! making its shafts fireproof are planned
(by the Anaconda Copper Mining com
pany in consequence of the lest'Jns
learned from the fires at the Tramway,
Mtdoc and Granite Mountain shafts,
and for the Anaconda, the lining of the
Tramway shaft is the beginning of a
task which it is proposed to extend to
every one of the company's more than
score of shafts in the Butte district.
For some time the North Butte
company has had the concreting of its
Granite Mountain shaft under way,
steel "I" beams 12 inches wide encas
ed in concrete is employed to brace the
shaft instead of timbers, the steel
beams first being riveted together and
then imbedded in concrete. An ob
jection found t this method by some
of the engineers is the danger to be
apprehended by "moving ground", in
cident to faults, which abouud in the
district, and might throw the shaft out
of line rendering its relining-up a dlffi- '
cult task in view of the chiseling away
of the concrete and the general inac
cessibility of the steel lining.
To meet this objection, the Anacon
da company in the case of the Tram
way shaft, which was destroyed by.
fire for a depth of 200 feet early this
year, the shaft walls are being lined
with a wire lath and concrete is forced ,
through the interstices of the lath by ,
means of what is called a "concrete";
gun. The result Is a lining of concrete
enclosing the wire lath, rendering the
wire impervious to the disintegrating
effect of the chemical action of copper
water, and rompllely encasing the
shaft and making it firepi'jof.

S THE DEVIL'S OUTCAST S
l
SUIT ON NOTES.
BY NED WHITE
Bisbee, Arizona
As the devil was passing along one day,
On his rounds through the inner gate.
He said, with a leer, "How came you here?"
To a soul on a red-hot grate.
The soul replied, as he turned with a groan,
And coughed up a sizzling spark,
"I am a Wobbly! And my goal
Was your gates of outer dark."
The devil looked down with a scornful frown.
On the squirming, wriggling soul.
And he said, with a sneer, "Then came you here
On a strike! you whimpering fool?"
The soul replied, as he turned on his side
And spit out some sputtering slag,
"I could improve on your second-class hell
Though I came not here to brag."
The devil then gave his horns a shake,
And said, with a muttered oath,
"My reputation seems now at stake.
And hell cannot hold us both!"
He turned in wrath to the scorching soul .
That sa t on the red-hot grids.
And said, "Go back, you loathsome swine,
And do as your master bids!"
The soul returned to the world of men,
On devilish mischief bent;
To poison the mind3 of wobbly fools
With treason and discontent.
He wanders now from place to place,
In various forms disguised.
Shunned by the honest sons of men.
And by the devil himself despised!

not consist entirely of warding ges

A person attacked Imust .either be

assailant is the speedier, running away
is a mere postponement of being beat

Think Destruction.
The German Kaiser has really
thought persistently of all non-Teutonic
countries in terms 'of destruction and
when he has spoken his private
thoughts, his speech has always been:
men's houses. In the United States it
lia baen left to the mercies of the
real estate speculator, with the resu.t
that the working man has had to pn.v
exorbitant rents, for bad housing and
worse environment. If you have t'o
pay 12 per cent for moneV to build
workmen's houses today instead ol be
ing able to borrow it from the govern
ment at 4 per cent. It means that the
rents have to be higher and the vork
man has to pay.
Ireland Set Example.
"The most brilliant and extensive ex
ample of housing reform achieved any
where is the building in Ireland dur
ing the last fifteen years of 10.COO cot
tages through government aid.
"In 1914, just before the war com
menced, Mr. Lloyd-eGorge came for
ward with the most comprehensive
housing program ever announced by
any responsible statesman. This pro
gram, put l'orlh officially as that of the
British government, was the proposal
to make a survey of urban and rural
housing conditions throughout Great
Britian and then, by government loans
at low interest, by government sub
sidies and by rent and wage commis-
250,000. Just before the war started
they were planning further housing in
volving an expenditure of $17,000,000.
This is all the result of 20 years of
hard work and housing education.
"In addition to the government and
municipal housing, there is a great
record of private enterprise such as
the houses built by the various co
partnership tenant societies which, in
the past 13 years have built over 12,
000 houses, with land and buildings
valued at over $42,000,000, and all the
different estates laid out on garden
city and town planning lines. There
are about 50 of these estates, varying
in size from six to 4,000 acres, and
comprising a total area of about 15,000
acres, of which only about 3,000 acres
have been developed, with over 13.000
houses, representing a capital invest
ment of $17,000,000. A large propor
tion of all this money for housing has
been loaned by the British government
at low rates of from 3V4 to 4 per cent,
and this aid has been largely the cause
of the successful housing results
achieved in England.

for relieving the destitute condition
of the women, children and old or
crippled men, the war has left behind
in runined homes.
It is the purpose of the alumnae as

and clothing, but farming implements,
seed and fruit trees. They look for

buildings.
In northern France thousands of an

The "RETURNED GOODS" Evil
We are always ready and willing to guarantee the quality of
our merchandise; if it is defective we will gladly replace it, or if
unable to replace it, w ill allow credit for its value, but here our
responsibility ceases.
Our Government is insisting that merchants conserve all re
sources and it will be necessary for our customers to co operate
with us to malle this conservation plan a success. Those who
purchase thoughtlessly, with the mental reservation to return
goods, should they ciiange their minds, are unconsciously antag
onizing our efforts to fulfill the Government's plan. We also
are partly to blame, having been too lenient in accepting re
turned goods for credit. However, in the future, as warned by
our Govern ment, we must consider every purchase an outright
sale, therefore, to avoid misunderstanding consider your buying
carefully, for we cannot accept the return of merchandise sold
in good faith and delivered as ordered In good condition.
The following extracts from the War Advisory Committee's in
structions dated October 3, 1917, will explain our position in these
mutters:
"A You avoid waste in men and material when YOU
keep what you buy. m .
-B By returning as little as possible YOU eliminate
unpatriotic waste.
"( Returned goods mean waste in men, money and
materials. It is YOUR patriotic duty to return as lit
tle as possible.
"D You enable the merchant to efXect an economic
distribution of labor when YOU shop in the morning
hours."
Goods bought thoughtlessly and afterwards returned occasion
a great waste of clerks' time, the dellveryman's time in sending
and calling for returns; a waste of materials used to wrap the
package rnd the deterioration caused by packing, unpacking and
repacking.
Mn have been drafted from every store and It is harmful to
our Government, if In order to replace these men. we are com
pelled to take them away from other needed work to perform
work that should easily be dispensed with.
