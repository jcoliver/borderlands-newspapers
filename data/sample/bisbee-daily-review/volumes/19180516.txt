WASHINGTON". May 15. Hearings
on the administration bill, proposing
exlyjisive development of waterways
for power and irrigation began today
before the special house water power
committee with Secretary Baker and
Houston urging changes in the meas
ure find its speedy enactment. The
bill would create a water power com
mission to be composed of the secre
taries of war," agriculture and interior
under which development would be di
rected. Secretary Baker urged a definite
pericd for licensing corporations, leas
ing water power and irrigation rights:
that leases be for a definite period,
and that the amount of compensation
to be paid private interests by the
government when it takes over plants
be fixed. The lease period suggested
jiow is 50 years with the government
retaining the option of renewing the
lease or purchasing the property
Secretary Houston also urged the
changes in tlie original draft bill to
make more spec-ilic references to com
pensation to private corporations when
water power plants are taken over bv
the government, and he submitted an
amendment under which licenses un
der the bill would be required to'set
i Hs'de an amortization reserve to he
held until the termination of the lease
or to be npplied in the reduction of
ihe net investment under the dirertion
of Ihe cm mission.
Mr .Houston said he did not believe
it necessary to include in the measure
a provision fixing a rate of return on
the investment of private interests in
the development of power, declaring
that such authority should be left to
the commission.
He also urged that the commission

L PERSHING!
TO
TROOPS OE ALLIES
- (By Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 15. General
Pershing probably soon will be com
manding French and British troops
as the process of brigading American
units with their allies on the western
front goes forward.
As if exemplifying the unity of
command and action into which the
United States and its co-belligerents
have entered it became known here
today that whenever American troops
predominate in the brigaded divisions
as the process goes on, these divisions,
under present plans, will be turned
over to General Pershing's command.
This plan would accomplish several
things which the military authorities
consulting upon it regard as very de
sirable. It would rapidly increase the
size of Uie American fighting conFI
mand on the 'battle line; it would con
tribute tremendously to the spirit of
unity and concerted effort and at the
same time, instead of holding large
numbers of American troops behind
the lines while training, would sur
round them with seasoned veterans
and under actual battle conditions
school them to be re-brigaded later
with fresh American troops coming to
France.
Latin Army Strong
In addition to this, as illustrative of
the unity of command under which
Generalissimo Foch directs all the al
lied armies, it was stated officially
beTe today that Foch commands the
Italian troops In Italy as fully as he
does American, British and French
troops In France and Belgium.
It was stated also that Italy, besides
sending troops to France in numbers
eciual to those being sent from the i
I'nited States has on her fightng line
a larger army more perfectly equip
ped than she had before the great
Austrian drive.
As giving the view of the allied
military experts on this plan, a high
efficer in the service of one of the
powers at war with Germany today
gave these opinions to the Associated
Press:
"From the news received and from
the knowledge of conditions as they
were when 1 recently left France I
cannot believe that the situation is so
completely In hand as to warrant any
slackening off in the rushing over of
American troops.
More Troops Needed
"Even should this supposition be
correct it would be a great military er
ror to work on such a basis. There
has been no more insidious propa
ganda than that which tends to se
duce popular opinion in the entente
countries into a false sense of secur
ity. What is being written today
about ,he Gernlan8 havinK used up ah
their reserve and having staked their
all on victory or defeat has been writ
ten almost literally, word for word,
at every crisis since the beginning of
the war. The result has often been
to delay preparation and to procras
tinate In tlie carrying out of measures
which eventually were forced to be
adopted.
"An incident such as the Ottawa
incident is one that might be seized
witji avidity by the enemy to cause
the slowing up in the flow of Ameri
can troops and to cause argument and
feeling about a matter upon which
there seems to be a perfect accord. I
cannot see that the statement as pub-
I lished in Ottawa in any way alters

AUSTRIAN
ALLIANCE IS MADE
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. May 15 According
to a dispatch from Switzerland, the
eBrlin newspapers Indicate that the
basis of the new treaty of alliance
agreed upon at-the recent conference
between the Gernion and Austrian
emperors contemplates fixing 25 years
as the period for the duration of the
alliance, the Imposition of strictly mil
itary oMipatons upon each nation and
the regulaton of economic relations so
as to realize the Mittel Europa plan.
The same message says advices
from Vienna are to the effect that no
formal agreement was signed because
the moment did not seem opportune,
but that nevertheless, the direction and
basis of the new treaty were definitely
fixed and that it only remains to
frame the different clauses.

CLOSE MILITARY UNION

dispatch from Berlin today says that j
now the mainl ines forth e cement
ing of the alliance between Germany
and Austria have been fixed, the poli
tical, military and economic negotia
tions wll doubtless hegn shortlv.
It is obvious, adds the dispatch that
the political and military arrangements
can be carried through faster than the
economic, which will probably 'take
several months to complete.
The phrase in the official report of
the emperor's confidence regarding
the consolidation and deepening of the
alliance, says the Berlin Tageblatt.
permits the assumption that the aim
of the convention is a close military
and political union and complete blend
ing of military resources.
Germany, during the conference of
the two emperors agreed on the solu
tion of the Polish question desired by
Austria on condition that Austria
Hungary conclude a 15 year conven
tion with Germany, according to a Vi
enna dispatch to the Berlin Lokal An
zeiger. Complete union between Aus-tria-HMungary
and Poland may short
ly be expected, the message adds.

Hun Emperors Meet
The meeting between the German
and the Austrian emperors at German
headquarters seemingly has been pro
ductive cf a strengthening of the rela
tions between Germany and the dual
monarchy, which it had been reported
unofficially were somewhat strained.
After parting Emperor William, and
Fmperor Charles exchanged messages
of felicitation over the accord arrived
at in their discussions and expressed
deep mutual friendship. It is asserted
that the emperors not only "reached an
agreement on the solution of the ques

also selected monarchs for Lithunia,

The launching of the collier Truckahoe.
The launching of the collier Truckahoe a few days ago set a world's
record for speedy ship construction. Just 27 days, 2 hours and 43 minutes
after the work of laying the keel commenced the Truckahoe slid into-the
. water. The ship will also set a new record for speedy complete construc
tion for the upper structure which, as can be seen, in this photo, was so
nearly finished before the loat left the ways that it will take but a littlo
time before the collier is ready for service.

Loyal and Calm
Some twenty warrants were served upon
the most prominent business men, county
officials and mine operators of this district
yesterday by a United States marshal, the
charge being a violation of law in the matter
of the deportation of I. W. W. members and
sympathizers on July 12 of last year.
Bonds were furnished and the indicted cit
izens will report at Tucson May 28 for ar
raignment and possibly for trial. The inci
dent did not create more than a ripple in
the district. AH those for whom warrants
had been issued who were in the district,
reported to the marshal upon request and
were duly served with their papers in the
case. This community as a whole feels
now about that deportation as it did last
July. It was both necessary and justified.
The sheriff, backed by loyal and patriotic
citizens, serving as his deputies, carried it
through, and loyal and patriotic citizens
calmly await the issue.
When the sheriff decided upon the de
portation he did so as a last extremity.
It was an operation to save the patient, .
which is to say the copper mines and the
community from a cancerous disease. If
there was a violation of law it was techni
cal and not actual. This nation was at war.
The copper output was threatened by a
movement, an organization, a conspiracy
that was nation wide. Copper was a ne
cessity for modern war. Only immediate
action could meet the situation, and the
loyal men of this district followed the sher
iff with that decision, firmness and skill
for which the men of the southwest are
noted. They also acted in defense of their
homes and community as well as their gov
ernment. While some resentment is felt in the dis
trict at this action of the government in
defense of members of an outlaw organiza
tion that are being tried in the courts of
Chicago for treason, yet the men most con
cerned, the men against whom indict
ments have been returned, feel not this re
sentment, nor does the community at large.
They abide the consequences and await the
result with calm confidence in the righte
ousness of their most justifiable act. Loyal
then, they are even more intensely loyal
now.
Last July Bisbee and, in fact, Cochise
county, declared, war upon the I. W. W.
And this declaration still stands. The I. W.
W. started the Bisbee strike last year. It
dominated the miners' union and seized the
reins of control. I. W. W. leaders directed
the strike and I. W. W. speakers, imported
for the occasion, conducted the nightly
meetings and spurred the strikers on. Red
card men intimidated loyal citizens desir
ing to work and threatened destruction of
life and property. If men outside the I. W.
W. were deported that July day it was be
cause they were at heart sympathizers with
that treason strike. No man was sent away
in those cattle car3 that day without first
being given a chance for his white ally. He
was given a choice between the I. W. W.
leadership and the old home town and the
government which was calling for every
pound of copper that could possibly be
mined and smelted.
The men indicted yesterday are leaders
in every war work for the government in
which this county has been a leader among
the counties of the nation. And they are
and will be leaders still in this great and
patriotic work. The community is behind
them to a man and to a woman.
The sheriff either had a right, after call
ing on the Federal government for troops
to protect peaceable men and property, and
being refused, we say he either had a right
to arrest these traitors and their sympathiz
ers and turn them over to the Federal gov
ernment or he had not. We feel these in
dictments are based on a technicality, and
the claim of conspiracy to deprive any I. W.
W. of his right will fail.
In the meantime the only thing for the
community to do is to face the situation in
a calm, sensible, loyal and confident man
ner. One great, compelling and all ab
sorbing and vital duty confronts ajl of us at
this time, and that is to do our level best in
all things to help win the war. Our ene
mies, the I. -W. W., upon whose account
some of our most representative citizens
have been brought to answer to the law,
are doing everything possible to hamper
the government and hinder it and harass it
in the prosecution of the war. But Sheriff
Wheeler, who led the drive, is now serving
his country in the army, sacrificing a $5,t)00
job to do so, and this community, which fol
lowed him so loyally and so true that mem
orable day, with a record for the Liberty
Loan and Red Cross and other war works,
that shines like a silver gleam in the sun
light, will continue to strain every effoit
to carry the war to a victorious conclusion
and oppose enemies at home and abroad to
that end that only a real man may face and
contemplate with a clear conscience and
the pride of an American in his soul.
THEY WANT THE MOON
Every time a congressional committee
digs into the governmental war program it
finds something rotten there. The latest
expose is the sluggard progress of the ord
nance department. Our manufacture of
light artillery, namely the three inch field
guns, is dragging in a most lamentable
fashion. The output is practically nill.
And the heavy artillery output is in worse
shape, if such a thing were possible. It is
said that ordnance experts were trying to
improve the French seventy-five. Shades
of Jove and his thunderbolts ! what a spec
tacle. The French seventy-five is the acme
of all weapons of war. It is the marvel of
the age and terror of all things German.
Yet our ordnance sharps, who have never
seen the smoke of a battlefield, would sit
in their offices and draw plans at their desks
which would make the seventy-five seem
like a blunderbuss.
It is past comprehension and belief. Yet
this is the cause advanced for the lack of
progress in our manufacture of light ar
tillery during the past year. It is the Lewis
gun scandal over again. The long and
costly months of delay there were explain
ed by the desire to make the Browning
gun, a superior weapon, it was alleged.
The delay in the airplane program was ex
plained by the same desire to attain per
fection and surpass the impossible. Ex
pounding theorems at the cost of battles
and human lives. Congressional inquiries
have been a joke in American public life
for thirty years, but when the history of
the Great War is written, congressional in
quiries will illumine several splendid and
vital pages of that work and have no little
credit for the winning of the war.
Bisbee launched a non partisan cam
paign for city government long weeks ago.
Now ccmes the league for national unity
and appeals to both old parties in general
to elect only loyal and "war-till-victory"
men to office the country over, regardless
and indifferent of party affiliations. The
non partisan ticket is the loyal ticket this
year of our Lord, 1918. Elihu Root, one
of the really great men of this nation, a
Republican, who buries his party prefer
ence at a time when the Democrats are in
power, joins in this appeal for non parti
san and loyal effort to win the war first
and then consider all else afterwards when
he signed the appeal and wrote to a friend:
"I do not believe there is a single con
gressional district which has not a staunch
loyal majority, but I understand that there
are probably from 20 to 30 districts in
which there are enough pro-German and
pacifist and extreme socialist votes to make
it possible for a disloyal candidate to be re
turned by a plurarity, if the loyal vote is
devided pretty evenly between the Repub
lican and Derrtocratic parties. Such men
would do infinite harm to our country in
congress ; their election would bring aid and
comfort to the enemy, would dishearten all
loyal citizens and would be discreditable to
both political parties." So, friends, when
you support and vote for the non partisan
city ticket in Bisbee you are in line with
the efforts of all true men the country over.
Current writers on the war have gener
ally agreed in giving to President Wilson
the credit for accomplishing the unity of
the allied forces under Gen. Foch. It is
the great stroke of the war from the allied
standpoint. And its real effects will not
be manifest, probably, until late in the
summer. But, as sure as fate, the results
of this master plan will bhow gloriously
upon the western front.
ARRANGEMENTS ARE
BEING MAGE FOR
LEGISLATURE
Comment as to What Bills
Will Be Passed and Who
Will Be Elevted as Presid
ing Officers.
PHOENIX, May 13. With the as
sembling of the special session of the
legislature but a week off, the bum
of industry that now permeates the
corridors of the capitol as workmen
are engaged in making; ready the as
sembly rooms and providing quarters
for the discommoded departments Is
expected shortly- to be replaced by the
gossip of politics. Just now, howfver.
it is industry that is in evidence and
to such an extent that W. A. Moeur,
commissioner of the land department,
was seen this morning diligently pick
ing his way through upturned desks
and office furniture that littered the
rotunda of each floor of the capitol,
trying to locate the exact spot that
the commission on state institutions
had selected for him to call his own
during the period of the session.
Put the time for the assembly is
near encugn at band to cause tne
wiseacres and know-it-alls to begin
sitting up and taking notice and this
they are already doing. Just now the
matter of principal concern is the or--niTtion
of the two branches of the
legislature. It has been established
by precedent that the organization of
the regular session does not hold over
and that a special session must re
organize, consequently Representative
Johns and Senator Clarldge will have
to be re-elected to preside over their
respective bodies.
Around the capitol it is generally
conceded that Representative Johns
is to again be speaker of the house
and Senator Claridge is to be re-elected
president of the senate. No one
is being mentioned as aspiring to op
pose them and what little dissatisfao
Hon has ever been expressed seems
to have blown over.
With the same officers presiding
over the two bodies, it is expected
that the remainder of the organiza
tionwill he practically the same. At
the regular session C. P. Hicks of
Present was secretary of the senate
and Sam W. Proctor was chief clerk
cf the house. These two officials had
a large corps of assistants for the reg
ular session and will probably be
quite as caDably assisted during the
special session.
How long the session will last is
the question upon which opinion is
divided. Before issuing his call for
a special session Gov. Hunt remarked
that there would be nothing In his
call that should occupy the attention
of the solons more than a "few days."
Whether "a few days" means 10 or
60 the governor failed to 'state and
speculation is extended over that wide
period.
One subject included in the gov
ernor call will probably be exclud
ed entirely, although it would have
reouired less time than any of the
others. T'lat is action ratifying the
suffrage amendment to the federal
constitution. Consress has not taVen
the action necessary to submit the
amendment to the states and it looks
as though the senate will not act in
time.
The bill to enable soldiers to vote
will probably occupy as much time as
any other measure. Senator Colter
is preparing such a measure and .it is
considered probable that other legis
lators will also have bills along this
line. At the present time it would ap
pear that such a bill will have little
effect on the vote, as most of the
Arizona troops are expected to be in
France by election time and the war
corridors of the capitol asworkmen
the front.
Dairv legislation is another matter
that is" expected to require much time
for its solution. This Is included in
the call and the present situation be
tween the creameries and dairymen
seems certain to demand considerable
time for its solution.
Altogether it would appear that the
session will last some "few days."
Land Commissioner Moeur finally
found himself located in the office
formerly occupied by State AudTTor
Jesse U Ioyce. Measurements taken
by the commission on state institu
tions showed that the space occupied
by the state auditor would fit the land
commissioner and other measure
ments showed that tiie auditor could
be made to fit in alt unoccupied space
in the back office with his clerks.
The legislature may now meet.

or equipping the team with uniform,
etc.
The three teams of the Warren dis

Hasty Bidv.ell turned In another
victory for the C. & A. baseball team
yesterday, deieating the Junction
I'riggs club 18 to 5 in a game featured
by the free, hitting of the winners.
Extra base hits were the rule rathor
than the exception and both of the
fans who attended the game cheered
lustily for the C. & A. club each time
cne of Manager Meachein's players
ramshackied the pill.
Bidwell kept the hits well scattered
and in only one inning were safeties
bunched for runs. In that spasm Gill
Pitman of the Junctions pickled one on
the nose for four bases with the sacks
loaded. The ball went through a hole
in the right center wall, it required
just six players and an even dozen
small boys to find the ball. The man
agement was taking no chances losing
this as its cost represented half of
the gate receipts.
Eason started on' the slab for the
J-B crowd but was touched up lively
and at times was wild while his sup
port was ragged. Errors mixed with
hits and free transportation netted
runs for the winners in almost every
inning.
HITS FAIL TO WIN
CIXCIVNATI. O.. May 15. B-.-n ton's
one base on balls, followed by a sacri
fice and a two base hit by Hoss. gave
Cincinnati the winning run over New

AMERICAN FLIERS
FIRE ON TRENCHES
(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN AtyMY IN
FRANCE, May 15 (By The Associated
Press). A heavy barrage was laid
down by the Germans on American po
sitions northwest of Toul this morning,
but no infantry attack developed. The
Americans in the line at all times dur
ing the firing were niady for the
enemy.
One of the American reconnaisanee
airplanes late yesterday afternoon
from en altitude of about 400 yards
fired upon German trenches, in which
there ware a number of the enemy,
with a machine gun.
The indications today pointed to the
possibility, that the American biplane
which suddenly dropped out of the
clouds yesterday, killing the two men
in It, was shot down by an enemy
machine, for it was established that
the engine of the biplane was running
at full speed when it hit the ground.

his. possession. A reward of $500 is
offered for his capture dead or alive.
It is not very often that a man goes
about the country looking for trouble,
but that is what a man named Mo
Nulty has been doing for the past 3
days between this city and Osborn.
And the worst part of the fact is that
he has been walking to find it and
has made the round trip each day.
j Now he is not looking for a fight or
; anything like that but he is looking
j for the trouble that has put the West
j em Union telegraph lines out of com
; mission between here and that point
d'.irini the past few days.
Monday one of the lines went out
I and it was reported. Tuesday the
! others went out and yesterday after-
noon about four o'clock the fourth line
! went out. From four o'clock until
hbout nine there was no wire and then
1 a line was out through over the tele-
phone lines to Tucson and a circuit
: opened up.
j Lineman McN'ulty and others have
been trying since Monday to find the
trouble but so far have not been able
to locate it. They have walked every
j foot of the way from Osborn to Bis
I bee and return and have examined
I each wire and pole and have not Ceen
able to find it as yet
The wires are working both east
and west out of Osborn but there is
no circuit from that place to Bisbee.
! It is expected that other wire meji
with telegraph testers will arrive from
Tucson today and an effort made to
locate the trouble along the line by
making a number of tests with instru
ments. ' The company hopes to have a line
working today. The telephone lirtes
west to Tombstone and Tucson last
night were not working in the best ot
condition and It was with difficulty
that a conversation could be carried

WOMEN: OF DISTRICT
MADE ESCAPE
The sheriffs office has been noti
fied that four Mexican prisoners made
their escape from an S. P. train near
Dragoon on Monday from James Cash,
a guard who was taking them from
the penitentiary at Florence to the
road camp near Clifton. The men were
hand-cuffed in pairs and made their
escape out of a window. No trace
of the men has been found as yet.
FROM MINES
Owen T. Smith was in the city yes
terday from his headquarters at the
old Exposed Keep property. He states
that the new management has taken
charge of the property and that he
will spend his time in developing
some other properties that he has in
that locality.
ON MINING TRIP
Judge Winters or Lowell has gone

eral other Bisbee and Lowell citizens.
He will be gone for several days. Dur
ing his absence Judge High Is at
tending to the business of the Lowell
court. Judge High is now justice of
the peace and coroner of two precincts
and acting U. S. Commissioner for the
district.
OFFICERS NOTIFIED
Local officers have been notified to
be on the lookout for a Mexican named
Jose Cr.rrez. vh' is wanted at Ray,
Arizona, for the crime of murder. He
is alleged to have killed a deputy
named Joe Donaldson on Monday
night when the latter went to arrest
him for carrying a gun. Gomez is
described as being about 5 feet 7
Of course, it is sad to read that sev
eral hundred Americans have been
killed by the Germans, but It would be
more sad to read that they had been
captured by the Germans. There are
quite a few conditions in this world
compared to which the leaving of this
life is .a pleasant picnic, and this is
one of thetn.
TOO LATE TO CLASSIFY
FOR RENT One single room; also'
two apartments furnished. Hayes j
House, near Catholic church, Tomb-1

Miss Lillian White of the Pacific di
vision of the lied Cross gave an ad
dress at the Y. W. C. A. to the women
of the Warren district, upon the sub
ject of "women in war work.'-' That
nurses are needed all through this
country in the training camps as well
as in France, and she says that r
man's life is as valuable while he is in
training as it is after he reaches the
scene of tattle. First we must send
plenty of men to Europe, and then
we must send plenty of nurses.
Every one present, after hearing
Miss White, resolved to let nothing
go undone that could be done to help
the men at war. And light was throwa
upon a great many things that a num
ber of people had been In doubt upon.
Miss White talked in a clear, distinct,
voice so that nil present heard every
word that she said.
She says that the men in the serv
ice may feel absolutely at ease about
their family, for if any bad reports
come to the soldiers they are request
ed to consult with the Red Cross at
once and they will do all in their
power to relieve this condition. Our
men must hav-j peace of mind if they
are to give themselves heart and soul
to the cause.
This talk w-as given principally to
the married nurses of the district,
for thev nre st trained and prepared
to do this service that the time is
coming when they will feel they must
enroll. The euestion of nurse's aid
came up and Miss White was not pre
pared to say as yet whether they
would be used in actual service or not.
Maybe In the convalescent hospitals.
A decision from the surgeon-general
is pending.
She lien axked every person in the
district to save every piece of flan:;l
and soft materials possible, at they
are very useful in the hospitals to
staunch the flow of blood and other
complications arising in the operating
rooms. Near some of the large hos
pitals there has been such a deninn 1
for these scraps that a complete clean

JAMES CASE STILL
ON THE DOCKET
The attention of the Superior court
at Tombstone is stil loccupied by the
trial of Mrs. Ernie James charged
with attempting to kill Miss Mary
Hughes in this city on the 25th of last
March. The state completed its direct
testimony yesterday morning and the
defense began the introduction of its
side of the case. It is now the opinion
that the case will not go to the jury
until late this afternoon and possi'lv
not until the next morning. The de
fense did not make much headway
yesterday and the defendant had not
been placed on the stand when court
adjourned. The session was liveied
in the afternoon by the fainting of
Mrs. Anabel Moore who was on the
witness stand for the defendant. Doc
tor Kdmundson who was in attendance
was called to give her some attention
and she was able to resume her testi
mony after some delay.
The state will have some rebuttal
testimoney as witnesses were sum
moned last night in the city to take
the early morning stage over this
morning. They will be used in re
buttal. A number of the other wit
nesses that have been in attendance
have returned home. From parties
coming from Tombstone the general
impression there seems to be tnat
there is little for the jury to do hut
render a verdict of guilty from the
facts and evidence that'has been In
troduced in the case.
