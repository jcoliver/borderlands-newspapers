Armistice Delegate Tells Ger
mans He Achieved Nothing
and "Had a Sad Mission,
With Few Happy Results"
"WEIMER, Monday, Feb. 17. (By
the Associated Press.) The natty
speches in the national assembly
which had been set down for this af
ternoon suffered a rude interruption
by the outcome of the new armistice
negotiations. The general outlines of
the new terms were known early to
day, and it was no surprise when
President Fehrenbach announced that
the speeches and arguments would be
deferred, so that Mathias Erzberger,
head of the German armistice delega
tion, might give a personal explana
tion of what happened between his de
parture for Treves last week and his
unexpectedly quick return today.
Herr Ezberger, noticeably wrought
up and laboring under a strain, began
with the announcement that the dele
gates were entitled to know at the
earliest moment the full details of the
negotiations. He then read the terms,
and the house listened in almost agon
ized silence. The slightest stir or
noise brought angry Lisses; the as
sembly never had beea one titho o
still.
The members of the house stirred
uneasily as he finished and stopped
for breath. Before continuing his ex
planation Herr Erzberger interjected:
"It is my wish that you never have
the fateful hours I have had. We on
the armistice commission have had to
bear untold responsibility."
Delay of Terms
He then referred to the unfortunate,
well nigh fatal delay in the arrival
of the terms at Weimar and went into
details on Marshal Foch's ultimatum,
which, he said, he was assured was
framed with the unqualified approval
of President Wilson. Herr Erzberger
told of his efforts to seucre modifica
tions, but said Marshal Foch had been
sternly insistent on the acceptance of
the terms. He touched only briefly,
but clearly on his successful protests
against Polish incorporation of Silesia
and his unsuccessful efforts to save
Bimbaum Bentschen and other Ger
man towns. He emphasized that the
allies would take over the responsi
bility of keeping the Poles in check
and give guarantees for the safety of
the Germans on the Polish side.
To Herr Erzbergers protests. Mar
shal Foch replied that all were purely
military measures, and in accordance
with President Wilson's fourteen
points.
Foch Denies Pleas
Herr Erzberger protested likewise
against the indeterminate extension of
the armistice, but Marshal Foch
brusquely declined to make any alter
ation and insisted upon inclusion of a
clause which gives him power to pro
mulgate any order to Germany at will.
Hedd Erzberger then demanded
whether the short indeterminate con
tinuation of the armistice might lead
to an early peace, to which Marshal
Foch replied: "I think so. I assume
so."
The minister said the difficulties
had geen greater because the nego
tiatiohshad become sharper and more
acute recently, and a long discussion
demonstrated that nothing more would
te changed.
The minister assured the assembly:
"I have confidence that Marshal
Fochs given word will be kept."
Achieves Nothing
Herr Erzberger said he had acheiv-
ed almost no results in his efforts to
have German prisoners released, be
yond a promise by France and Eng
land, each to send back 2.000 badly
- ounded men. He then read the Ger
man note, which he presented to Mar
shal Foch as the armistice terms were
signed. He had had a sad mission,
with few happy results.
"The world knows." he concluded,
"that we do not want a new war and
cannot coruct one. The. world will
condemn the entente for its severity."
President Fehrenbach then announc
ed that the ministers and delegates
intended to withhold their declarations
until Wednesday, and suggested that
the house adjourn immediately, in
view of the new situation.
The house accepted a proposal to
consider nothing tomorrow but an in
terpellation by Dr. Herns with refer
ence to the armistice terms.

Conference Expects Treaty to
Be Signed by Early Sum
mer: Heligoland Must Be
Completely Dismantled
PARIS, Feb. 1 (By The Associated
Press). The supreme council of the
gTeat powers today heard the portray
al of Serbia's claims. Some of the
representatives of the council, how
ever, remained away, feeling that the
time for talk was past and that the
present need was action for settling
back to the peace basis.
This movement is taking form in
the most responsible British. Ameri
can and Italian and French quarters
and promises to yield definite results
within the next few days.
The first effect will be a permanent
armistice plan, which Marshal Foch
will present within a fortnight, taking
the place cf the hort term armistice
announced yesterday. '
Permanent .Terms
These permanent terms will be the
preliminary steps toward peace and
will be incorporated into the peace
treaty to follow. This will bring a
peace treaty measurably within sight.
The present prospect is the first
draft of five or six main provisions
which will be ready when President
Wilson returns March 15, so that
early action tan be secured by the
full conference and the enemy powers
can be called in byApriL The peace
congress, with .all the powers repre
sented, would thus be constituted by
late spring and give prospect of the
conclusion of a permanent peace by
the early days of summer.
The principal feature is German dis
airnament down to the requirements
of an international police not
exceeding 25 divisions of about ten or
twelve thousand men each or a total,
force of approximately 250.000 men. j
Other restrictions will cover produc
tion of rrmament of all kinds and the
complete disappearance of the enemy's
submarine equipment. j
The Naval Terms I
The naval terms, while jointly
agreed to by the experts, have .not
yet been approved by the war coun
cil. It is understood the agreement
concerning the dismantling of the for
tifications of Heligoland and of the
Kiel canal, will have some reserva
tions from American quarters, so as
not to establish precedent for the non
fortificaticn of canals and waterways
wholly within American national
boundaries, such as Hell Gate, the
Cape Cod canal and the systems of
canals running parallel with the At
lantic coast line. The Panama canal
has not 'come up during the discus
sions, but suitable reservations will be '
made so that no precedent is estab
lished that will be applicable to this
waterway. The dismantling of Helgo
land reservations, will, it is believed,
have in view the establishment of pre
cedent against the fortification of
lands lying along the American coast
which are regarded as part of the
coast defenses.
After hearing the serbs today their
claims were referred to a commission
with the exception of the issue with
Italy on the eastern Adriatic, on which
negotiations still proceed.

no formal action on the request.
Instead, it voted. 7 to 5. tc report a j
resolution giving the senate measure
the right of way. Ten Republicans
joined with 162 Democrats in voting
for the resolution in the house after a
sham debate. Before adopting the!
senate biU. the house amended it so
as to provide that recruits should be
enrolled in the regular army for only
one year without further service in
the reserve. Their pay was fixed by
another amendment to $o0 a month,
the war time basis in the army.
Mann Attacks Democrats
Republican Leader Mann in -explaining
the votes of 155 Republicans
against adorting the rule to consider
the senate bill, said opposition was ;
not against the -bill, but was a pro-t
test against the failure to consltier a I
temporary program, that would enable
the quicker return of troops from'
Europe. The recruiting bill itself was
. adopted without- a dissenting vote. ,
lf the Democrats said "Vfr. Mamj.
"are unwilling to let the bowse consider
legislation that will bring drafted men

-Democrats. The responsibility for such

administration under legislation of the

PHOEXLX. Ariz.; Feb. IS. Senators
Winsor and Campbell today brought
into the senate a ' bill to provide a
working basis for .Arizona's co-operation
wnh he federal - governme"nt in
settling returned soldiers, sailors and
marines on farms in this 6tate.
As outlined in the bill the basis
of co-operation is .that the' state fur
nish the land and the federal govern
ment the money, the lands tobe adver
tised for and bought m the open" mar-
ket. Reclamation projects, on unim-! -
proved land are provided for and the j
state iana ooara is constituted a sol
diers settlement board. The measure
declares an emergency exists and bars
operation of the referendum clause
of the constitution. . , ',
A state soldiers' settlement fund
would be provided by all monies re
ceived by issuing bonds forhat fund
arid from gifts to the fund. Authority
is: given not 4nly to acquire and re
claim lands, but to train returned figh
ters as fanners and to arrange with
ine xeaerai autnomies tor tnis ex-4
Dense. 1 , . "
Farm Values Limited
The state would be allowed to ex
pend not more than 25 per cent of the
total purchase piice and " improve
ments. - The bill provides that unimproved
farms shall not be valued in excess
of f S000 and divisions for farm labor
allotments -not more than $1000.
Authority is given the settlement
board to obtain loans from the United
States gOTernment for settlers on
farms not to exceed $3000 and on
farm labor allotments not more than
$1000.
Classification of counties according
to their assessed valuation and the
fixing of state and county salaries
came Jn for a little amending at the
hands of a bill introduced by request
by Hughes. UndeT this measure the
state salaries would be fixed as fol
lows: Governor. $6000; secretary of
state, auditor, treasurer, superinten
dent of instruction, corporation com
missioner, mine Inspector and tax
commissioner, $5000 each.
Taxes for Grazing
The attorney general also would re
ceive a salary of $5000 on the under
standing that he must have been in
practice beforp th sunrpmo mnn frr-1
the five years prior to his assuming
office, and that when elected he de
vote his entire time tq the state,'
Herndon introduced, a measuM pro
viding taxes for non-resident owners
of animals grazing in the state, on
sheep and gcats 25 cents per year per !
nead and on cattle and horses 50 cents

NEW LIBERTY LOAN
DRIVE WILL BEGIN
BEFORE APRIL 21
(Continued from Pag One)
tion before the adjournment of the
present congress.
Secretary Glass' statement, issued
tonight, after announcement of the
ways and means committee's action,
follows :
"The Victory Liberty loan campaign
will begin not later than April 21. The
requirements of the treasury are im
perative and cannot be financed with
out such a campaign. The form and
terms of the securities to be issued
remain to be determined. "Whether
they be bonds or notes, it is absolutelv
essential that the widest possible
measure of distribution be realized.
This will necessitate a campaign of
the same character as that conducted
in the past-through the existing Lib
erty loan organizations. . They have
pledged again their united support in
order that the Victorv I.ihf-rtv i-.a
bonds or notes may be distributed j
as wiaeij as possible among the
American people." ; "
This furnished the first official no
tice, of the date of the campaign, and
disposed of the reports that an issue
of notes would be floated mainly
among bankers, rather than the gen
eral public.

Lt. CoL John C. Greenway sent word
to Bisbee yesterday that he would
arrive here Sunday night. Colonel
Greenway, who saw several months of
active service on the French front,
will return here to his home wearing
the Distinguished Service Cross, pre
sented to hun for extraordinary valor
and service in the recent fighting.
The colonel will be accompanied by
his brother, Gilbert Greenway, who
also saw service on the western from.
They will be met at Douglas Sunday
evening by a large number of friends
and will then motor here.
Extensive arrangements for a recep
tion are now under way preparatory to
the colonel's arrival. Next Monday
evening, he and Maj. William H.
Brophy will be the guests of honor at
a banquet of the Warren District
Business Men's association to be held
at the Country club. A program com
chainnan; Arthur Xotman, Chas. Al

be done in the interests of the banquet.
The Calumet & Arizona band has
volunteered its services for the even
ing. The number of guests for the
banquet will be limited to 200, and the
distribution of tickets is in charge of
C. W. Buth, secretary of the business
men's association.
Plans are also under way for a ban
quet at the Country club to the many
soldiers from the Warren district who
have returned from the war. At this
time, however, only a small number of
the original have returned, and it is
felt that it would be better to give
them a formal banquet when all the
men have returned.

Armour's Letter
"From where .we stand now, there
are two roads; one of then leads to
bolshevism. It has brought to life the
worst forces that are in men. We
find it manifested in excesses of de
struction, savagery and complete dls
regard for the rights-of others. It is
a desire for liberty gone insane and is
unthinkable in the United States. The
other road leads back to individual
and corporate freedom which is limit
ed only by the rights of others.
"Let us not forget that what the
malcontents call the old order of
things, has made the United States
the richest of nations and made Amer
ican citizenship worth more than any

An address which Mr. Armour had
planned to make was read tonight.
The address, in part, said:
"This congress can do the nation no
greater service than to make plain to
..ne pubac the true relations between
wages and the cost of products, be
tween proms and the cost of service,
between investments and the returns
thereon. I have come to the conclu
sion that the greatest need we face
today is that of understanding.

The League of Nations
While sharp criticism of the covenant of a league of nations is com
ing from some quarters, especially from the obstructionist press, and
while others are inclined to look more or less dubiously on te practicabil
ity and constitutionality of the league, a note of hope and desire that the
covenant may be the beginning of a better international agreement is
found throughout the press of the United States, Great Britain and
France. On the whole, however, reception of the league plan is favor
able, and the covenant, according to the Arizona Republican (Phoenix),
"must appeal to peace loving people everywhere." Further, this publica
tion says:
"It is something more and something less than a treaty. It may be
given force without the formal assent of a legislative body, yet the part
that any nation may take in it will depend upon legislation enacted from
time to time to enable the nation to perform its part. . . . ye have
little doubt that all the great powers upon which the execution of the
covenant will depend. . . . will make an honest effort to give force
to the agreement which has been so sincerely conceived to make peace
universal and permanent"
Similarly many papers of the United States view in the league the
consummation of a great world desire, long felt and patiently awaited.
"The world has waited twenty centuries for something like this." declares
the Boston Herald. The Globe (Boston) welcomes the co-enant as the
"long heralded parliament of man." while the Indiana Daily News
(Indianapolis) believes that "today a world nation is a reality, although
Bomewhat nebulous. After long and troublesome centuries the end of war
actually is in sight."
On the other hand there are those who do not believe that the cove
nant would provide against future wars, and who express strenuous ob
jections, still carrying a note of hope, against certain provisions aimed to
abolish war. The Kansas City Star is one of the most consistent op
posers of the league on this ground. It declares:
"It (the covenant) permits European powers to make the decision
on th,e size and extent of American armament a decision which would be
binding on the United States but which could be readily evaded by any
unscrupulous power. . . . The nation simply cannot afford to sur
render the hardly won safeguards of its national life, to accept a vis
ionary experiment. It should be possible to make the beginnings of an -international
occasion that at some future time might develop into a world
state. But the present plan is far beyond anything practicable at the pres
ent stage of civilization. It must be radically changed if it is not to be a
grave menace to the wellbeing of America and the world."
Opposing this view, the New York World believes with Disraeli that
"the Impossible has happened. The constitution of the league of nations
is a living, organic fact . . . not only the most important, but the
most profoundly serious political document of the country, for it marks
a new stage In the political and social progress of mankind, while the
New York Herald sees in it something which "should assure the peace
of the world for many generations, if not for all time." and the Indian
apolis Star thinks that "it certainly has every promise of being a long
step toward the abolition of war and the assurance of a reign of peace
and justice."
In Epite cf the fact that the St. Louis Star believes that "only the most
perverse political obstructionists can oppose the covenant, so conserva
tive and constructive an organ as the New York Sun argues that the
provisions of the covenant may be unconstitutional, saying, "Article 12
engages the members of the league not to go to war without submitting
the war quarrel either to arbitration or the executive council for in
quiry. The constitution of the United States contains no provision which
enables congress to divest itself of its exclusive and inalienable power to
declare war." . The Cleveland Plain Dealer, accepting the opposite view,
declares that "there can be no doubt of the reception of the proposed
constitution in America. It will receive vigorous approval from the
people."
The Montreal1 (Quebec) Star and the Daily Express (London) simul
taneously declare the covenant to be the "Magna Charta of the World,"
and editorial comment of the British press is, unlike the divided opinion
of this country, united in welcoming the covenant. This feeling is sum
marized in the Daily News (London) which says:
"There can be no infallible proof of the effectiveness of the league
until it actually is in being and at work, but the Paris draft is in itself
a convincing answer to those critics who saw in the whole conception of
the league merely a dream of amiable idealiets. It is manifest that the
league is a profoundly practical proposition which, though it will not
abolish war in a week, will beyond all question make bo smooth the way of
peace and so hard the path of war, that the fear of impending hostilitieo
will immediately be lifted from the earth."
While the French press is not so enthusiastic as the British over the
project, it bespeaks hope of the future from the covenant. Almost to a
writer, the French regard the covenant as a league of the allies, and in
this chiefly, is their hope hased. Fear of the German peril is read be
tween the lines in every comment and the Journal t Paris) comes frankly
to this issue:
"While we are speaking of fraternization," it says, "the French people
cannot lose sight of reality; 'and reality exists for us in the shape or
70 million humiliated Germans, shuddering under merited punishment.
It is half of Europe in chaos. When we are offended, amidst such perrep
tives, the seductive idea of disarmament, it is our duty to ask plainly
where are the guarantees and what is the force which will shelter us fro n
the reaction of tragic surprises. To these questions a careful reading
of the projected statutes of the society of nations and the eloquent
speeches made at the conference, there is but one answer: Moral force."
The same sentiment of danger from across the Rhine, finds -olce
in the Echo de Paris, which believes that "the twenty-six articles bring
us (France) no security. Until they are changed, we can sacrifice noth
ing of our means of defense to them," and tho Figaro (Fans) says "The
mystic society of nations has become a league of the five great powers
which beat Germany, and which, having conquered, mean to consolidate
both victory and peace."
Of "the dangerous dogma of the freedom of the seas." as the Daily
Express (London), aptly characterizes this question, little comment is
found. The Express concludes this vital problem "seems to have evolved
into a statement that the league shall 'secure and mamtath freedom of
transit and equitable treatment for the commerce yf all states. while,
returning again to Arizona, the Republican Phoenix) believes that this
"cause or dispute . . . is in a large part removed by the agreement
against favored cation clauses in commercial treaties, which Ido often
and to quickly have been translated mio elecsive and defensive al
liances and war-like groupings. Here. toD. is a prohibition of secret
treaties between members of the league. I: would be unthinkable in any
scheme of a family of nations, that there should be a private under
standing that special benefits should -ccrue to less than the whole
number of members."
While the socialist orgau Humanite "Paris) complains that 'It is im
possible to conceal the impression or disillusionment hat t lamination of
the long convention makes on us" and the Milwaukee Leader (Socialist)
declares that "the world constitution is a mechanical contrivance" with
out "the Taintest trace of democracy in it." both arc hopcrul that, as the
Milwaukee organ sees it. "the covenant might .perhaps serve as a step
pius; stone to the kind of world we Socialists want."
Bisbee's Paving Program
Latt night saw another step taken toward providing Birbie with
ample and much desired paving when the city council considered favor
ably an ordinance calling an election and in other wfce preparing for arly
submission of the question to the people. Under the o.-oposcd ordinance
the election will be held in five weeks, the earliest ncssil.V date und-.r
Uie las of this sMte.
Fortunately, one cek following the election the. couutil will be able

to pass on the election results, since a regular meeting night falls
on that date. The result will be that in six weeks Liisbee will hav
passed on its paving problems, establishing a record for dispatching
this work.
Paving specified under the plans to be submitted to the citizens will
include upper Main street and Tombstone canyon. Brewery gulch, and
Naco road, together with other needed links. Every foot of "the proposed
pavement is vitally needed in the city, and each unit will add materially
to the city's appearance and to property values.
Opinion, so far as public expression has been concerned, is not divided
on this issue. Every resident of this city apparently favors beginning
the work as soon as possible; each property holder is aware of conditions
existing in the district, and each knows that the building program will
work a long way toward solving present problems.
With these facts in view, and with the knowledge that the city council
and officials have worked incessantly since Christmas to give Disbe3
this building program, it is the duty of each property holder in the
district eligible to vote on this improvement, to register as soon as
possible and to vote. Let each man and woman consider himself and
herself a duly appointed committee of one to secure a maximum expres
sion on this important question.
An Important Meeting
Each meeting of the community labor board is an important meetiug
Conditions in this district and about the state are discussed at the
meetings. Means of meeting emergencies are taken up and decided upou.
The welfare of communities is discussed. Consequently, each business
man and every person interested in the progress and advance of his
community should take a share of interest in the meetings of the board.
Duty also calls representative citizens into the councils of the board
When war ceased to be and the dawn of peace broke over the United
States, every community found itself facing labor conditions problems
peculiar to industries and surroundings. The government discovered that
it would be necessary to call on each, city and district to assist in solving
these problems, and from this necessity the labor boards were born.
Reports of the community labor board on conditions in this county
as the past few weeks have passed, have become constantly less opti
mistic until it is now estimated that fully 1500 men are without en ploy
ment in this county. The board is now seeking to provide messjs for
giving these men work, and at least partial aleviation of the situation is
promised.
At the meeting tonight of the board, further means of aleviation will
be taken up. Two attorneys of the district have Volunteered their serv
ices and professional advice for the meeting, and immediate, emergency
road appropriations by the state will be discussed. If such appropria
tions are found advisable and possible, it is probable the board will make
recommendations to the legislature.
Officers of the Bisbee board are urging every business man end
every citizen interested in the progress of the community to attend this
meeting. It is "an important gathering, and should have a large attendance.
Ebert's Warning
Evidently the warning of Chancellor Ebert that "the armistice terms
are unheard of and ruthless" and that "we warn our opponents not to drive
us to the uttermost," were but more of the winnings of a whimpering
Han. They bring to mind, anyhow, the old saying that a barking dog
After repeated rumors that the Germans had refused to renew the
armistice, they finally accepted the new terms of the allied governments
in the last.hour and in full. These terms include the same provisions
which Ebert complained were "ruthless and unheard of." Among the
terms is one providing for continuation of the blockade during the arm
istice. This was Eberfs abnoranee the "ruthless and unheard of clause
which he especially opposed, and which he sent Erzburger to Treves to
protest.
The trouble is that Ebert has adopted the same German blundering
means of seeking relief which has characterized every leader the nation
has had. Instead of admitting defeat, admitting national disaster. Ebert
comes to the allies boasting a Germany which is capable of resistance.
Instead of seeking relief through presentation of economic facts and fig
ures, Ebert demands it with threat of renewed war. Instead of placing his
country at the mercy of the victors. Ebert seeks to intimidate an over
whelming power with empty words.
Typically German is the blunder. And the answer is typical of the
allies. Had Ebert pursued the course expected of the fallen his plea
might have elicited a different answer. Therein is a lesson for the Hun.
Teachers Pensions
The proposed amendment to the law relating to teachers' pensions
should receive the favorable attention of the legislature. The present
law. as a pension law. is defective in that it humiliates those whom it is
designed to serve. It places them in the light of paupers. A pension
is a reward for service due to all those who performed that service and
the payment of it should not be contingent upon misfortune. Such a
discrimination is unjust alike to those upon whom the pension is bestowed
and those from whom it is withheld. '
Teachers have ever been notoriously underpaid, but never before
was the discrepancy in wages between teachers and every other class
of service so striking as it is now. There is. therefore, greater reason
than ever why we should have a just and reasonable teachers' pension
system.
Otherwise the condition of the teacher should be made more at
tractive. It has been a drag upon our educational system that so few
enter upon it as a life work. To nine out of ten teachers the profession
is a stepping stone only, and perhaps to some of that nine it is only
a resting place, in which the teacher vegetates and the pupils suffer
loss of time and opportunity.
Thus the great bulk of our teachers never become a properly ad
justed part of our educational machinery. Arizona Republican.
The Punchboard Bill
Representative C. T. Francis, of Cochise county, has introduced a
measure in the state legislature (by request) "For the purpose of permit
ting bona fide merchants, engaged in business in Arizona, to stimulate
trade and to advertise their wares and meet legitimate competition." The
foregoing title could be shortened to read: "For the purpose of legalizing
punchboards."
The people of Arizona have gone on record against gambling of every
sort and character. Punchboards tome under the hammer in practically
every countrn the state. Where they are permitted the authorities
evidently feel that the people are not adverse to such piactices and with
such communities we have no criticism.
On the whole, however, we are against any measure that would
legitimatize the most insiduous form of gambling, such as the proposed
measure would do. Punchboard gambling is worse than open roulette;
than the old time "bank." Punchboards parado as methods for the sale
or merchandise. They are. in reality, the worst form of "skinning the
sucker."
It may be that Mr. Francis didn't understand the purport of Hous
Pill 104. If he did and introduced it. he should answer i home
community Iouglas; if h did not understand it. it appears to us that
he should be furnished a keeper. Tucson Star.
Arizona and the United States
The senate and house conferees in Washington have reached an
a grceraent wherein a road building program provides $50,000,000 tor ex
penditure throughout the United States in the coining var. In the
Arizona senate a favorable vote has been had on a road building measure
which would provide $30,000,000 for this state. No' wonder comparisons
are odious.

Introduced. Giving Votes j
to Women j
WASHINGTON. Feb. IS Advocates
of woman suffrage in the senate
stated today that they were consider
ing plans to obtain enactment at this
session of congress of a new. modi
fied resolution as a substitute tor the
Susan B. Anthony resolution recently
defeated in the senate by one vote.
Chairman Jones of the senate woman
suffrage committee and other cham
pions of equal suffrage are canvassing
the situation with officers of wom
en's organizations and a meeting of
the committee may be called later it
the informal inquiry develops any
prospect of favorable action before
congress adjourns.
The new resolution, dratted by Sen
ator Jones, would confer the right cf
franchise upon women by constitu
tional amendment, but only- to the ex
tent that men are iermitted tr votn
in the several states. It is designed
tomteet the objection of southern sen
ators. Senator Gay of Louisiana, democrat,
who recently voted against the Susan
B. Anthony resolution todav in in
duced a resolution containing the pro
vision of the Susan 11. Anthony pro
hibiting abridgement of franchise be
cause of sex. but with an added pro
viso giving the states and not the
federal government exclusive author
ity to pass legislation for the amend
ment's enforcement.

jj Mining and Financial News
jj BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
NEW YORK. Feb. IS. Uncertainty
and consequent irregularity of prices
marked sluggish trading on the stock
exchange today, the session reflecting
none of the previous day's public in
terest, activity or breadth.
Motors and some minor or uninipor
tan specialties comprised the firm to
strong issues and oils were again var
iable to strongly depressed.
Almost the sole hopeful feature was
the relative strength of rails, buying
of that group at intervals including
most of the representatives shares in
the granger, transcontinental and coal
divisions at 1 to 112 points gain.
Rails were almost the only shares
to retain a fair proportion of their
advance in the selling movement of
the last hour, which virtually effaced
General Motors extreme rise of four
points and affected moderate unsettie-
ment ekewhere.
United States Steel closed at a loss
of virtually a point after having made
a slight gain, other stels and equip
ments reacted one to three points,
with Marine preferred and Mexican
Petroleum's further reversal extended
. ether oils.
Rtient mixed conditions in the bond
xarket continued, speculative rails
-ho wins further heaviness. Liberty
bonds steadied, but international
war i-scues lacked feature. To
tt.1 sales, par value, aggregated $10,
S75.000. Old United States coupon
fours gained S per cent on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Feb. IS. Reports that
minimum average . prices on hogs
probably would not be continued after
March 1 had a decided bearish effect
today on corn. The market closed
unsett'ed. s4 to 2SC net lower, with
May $1.20 to $1.20 and July H7hi
to $1.17H- Oats finished unchanged
o lic net down. Provisions varying
from 60c decline to 50o advance.
Interest of the corn trade focused
on current gossip that it was the in
tcntieh to let the hbg market take
care of itself when the agreement as
to the February miuimum price ex
pired. The general impression was
the glut in the hog supply had been
'"r the most part disposed of. A ma
jority of grain dealers, however, ap-
; eared to believe that for at least the
t:Tne Ixing tl' price of hogs would
Ul sharply ence the restriction was
removed and that cereals would fol
low. Conflicting reports as to the out
look for continuance of the hog price
minimum led to rallies, but not of a
lasting sort.
Oats were steadied by the lightness
of receipts.
Provisions, like corn, gave way as a
result of the tulk about stoppage of
agreed minimum hog prices. Lard,
uowever, was relatively firm.

j BUTTE MINERS AGAIN
PRODUCING COPPER
(By Review Leased "Wire)
BUTTE. Mont.. Feb. 13 Several
thousand tons of ore were hoisted to
the surface In the mines of the Butte
district today. Capacity production
will not be reached until Thursday,
mine operators announced, and in sev
eral of the properties work will not be
resumed until the mines have been
cleaned and repaired.
Accurate figures regarding the num
ber of men who reported for work
are not available but it was estimat
ed by operators today that about 75
per cent of the force at work when
the strike was declared are back. It
was apparent today that the mine ope
rators are selecting the men they are
placing at work.
Cookingham deduces that another
$100,000 must be found if the Job is to
be Euisbed and the water turned on
the 15,000 acres included in the project.
