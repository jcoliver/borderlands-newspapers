PARIS, May 13. (French wireless
service) General Denekine, the head
of the Cossack anti-bolshevik govern
ment in southwestern Russia has com
municated his program to representa
tives of the allied powers. The princi
pal points of the program follows:
To continue the struggle against
bolshevism. '
Restoration of law and order.
Reconstruction of a unified and In
divisible Russia.
Convocation of a constituent as
sembly based upon universal suffrage.
Larger regional autonomy and the
estagllshment of self-governing dis

PARIS, May 13. (French wireless
service) The feeding of the Russian
population is no solution of the Rus
sian question, it is declared in a
memorandum sent to the7 peace con
ference by Prince Lvoff, Sergius
Sazonoff "and President Tschalkowsky
of the north Russia government, con
cerning the proposal to feed Boviet
Russia through neutral countries on
condition that the bolsheviki cease
hostilities. The memorandum con
tinues: "The task which the Russian na
tional movement must fulfill Is to
liberate Russia from the yoke of those
who have reduced her to her present
state of impotence and to the neces
sity of relying upon foreign countries
for her food. The feeling cf the fam
ished population is no solution of the
Russian question. Consequently, the
struggle to liberate Russia from her
oppressors and to give Russia a gov
ernment of her own choosing cannot
be stopped for any reason whatever.
The signers -of this declaration , wish
to state that Russia' will pay for the
food provided for her hut they hope
that the allies "win refuse to give
the bolshevik usurpers the right to
dispose of Russia's patrimony."'
BOLSHEVIK REJECT ALSO
PARIS. May 13. (By The Asso
ciated Press) A wireless mesage re
ceived here addressed to Dr. Fridtjof
Nansen, head of the commission to
feed Russia, from M. Tchitcherin, bol
shevik foreign minister, and relayed
by the foreign office at Berlin an
nounces that the bolsheviki refuse to
cease hostilities as a condition of the
provisioning of Russia by neutrals.
Tchitcherin declares that a contin
uation of hostilities is necessary for
political reasons and that it would be
poor policy to stop them. The soviet
government, he adds, is willing to
support a movement to feed Russia
"but will not be duped."

bond,, following thehirrest today on
a federal warrapt charging conspiracy
to defraud the government out of a
large sum of money by selling Inferior
grade hay at the price of superior
grade.
The aTrrests today followed a lengthy
investigation by federal agents
throughout the southwest, where hay
totaling $250,000 in value is said to
have. been shipped by dealers, under
Jaggers' inspection, to United States
army quartermasters . department at
Deming, N. M.; El Paso, Texas; Waco,
Texas; Naco, Ariz., and other points.
Both . men were arraigned late to
day, Peters being released on bond
and Jaggers held in jail until tomor
row, when he expects to arrange for
his release until the hearing, which
was set for May 19. .
The hay in question is said to have
been sold in carload lots to the army.
The warrant fixes the date of one
Bale as February 15. It is alleged
that whereas the hay really was
"standard" grade, it was marked grade
"A" and was paid for at the higher
price.
Peters, who came originally from
Australia, has been in the hay busi
ness in Tempe for a number of years, i
and is a pioneer of the Salt River val
ley. Jaggers, who holds the position of
federal hay inspector of the county,
also is secretary of the Maricopa
County Hay Dealers' association. He
was assistant food administrator in
the Mesa district; during the war and
last fall he was appointed federal hay
inspector. Jaggers has a hay and
grain sales house at Mesa.
Arnold B. Chaytor, representative
of the department of justice, still; is
conducting an investigation of, the hay
deals throughout the southwest and
it is stated that the eventual total un
covered may greatly exceed the quar
ter million estimate so far- reached.

prices, unusual interest attaches to
the bids. The standard price for
open hearth steel rails as announced
by the induMrlil board was $47 a ton.

READY TO RECEIVE AUSTRlANS
ST. GERMAIN, En Laye, May 13.
(By The Associated Press). The ar
rangements for the reception of the
Austrian peace delegates tomorrow
evening, for their accommodation In
the quaint suburban residence of the
early French kings and the presenta
tion to them of the conditions of peace
which are to be a duplication in many
respects of those handed the Germans
at Versailles, are completed.
It is evident that the Austrlans are
to be treated less as enemies and sub
ject to less restrictions than their
German allies. They will be received
on their arrival at St. Germain by
the chateleine of the department of
Seirie-et-Oise as the representatives of
th French government and will be en-
trusted to the charge of the inter
allied military mission under the
French Colonel Henry on which Major
Tyler represents the United States.
Appeasing Italy
The Italians will play a far more
prominent role in the reception of
the Austrian and the presentation of
terms than in the' case of the Ger
mans. Au Italian Colonel, ranking
with Colonel Henry and above the
other inter-allied representatives has
been delegated by the military mis
sion and the Italian plenipotentaries
probably will be given seats at the
. ihead of the table. ,
The museum of the chateau, con
taining relics of pre-historic times, by
unpremeditated irony has been select
ed for the ceremony of turning Over
to the delegates the - peace treaty,
which is ready. .
The room is much smaller than that
at Versailles, where the Germans were
informed of the demands of the allied!
andasgociated (governments ;and the
conference tables which are arranged
in exactly the same form of hollow
rectangles crowded to the limit. Ow
ittg to the limits of the -room; space
has been reserved only for selected
representatives of the press.
Foes Shun Public'ty
The Austrian delegation could
reach St. Germain early in the after
noon but in order to avoid a too public
entry into the town the special train
on which they are traveling will be
routed so as to arrive in the evening
at some small station outside St. Ger
main. From this station the delegates
will be brought jn automobiles aad in
conspicuously as possible. to theViUtt'i
ters reserved for them in two hotels

The intention to quarter the Turks

They probably will be located in Meu

DOUBLE BILL AT -EAGLE
THEATER
FOR TODAY ONLY
" "The Divorcee," which comes to the
Eagle theater today only, was taken
from the successful stage play, "Lady
Frederick," by W. Somerset Maugham.
It is a powerful story of intense hu
man emotions. In this dramatic Metr
production Ethel Barrymore is seen
In her artistic and emotional best.
She plays the same role which she
created on the stage and in which she
became internationally famed. The
story is a powerful one full of the
passions which sway and dominate.
Jealousy, intrigue, revenge and love
all take their turn upon the stage
of life but, as always, love and good
prevail and. the story ends with a
beautiful romance.... The action Is
swift and intense and Miss Barrymore
touches dramatic heights never be
fore reached by ad American actress.
On same program a big special
comedy featuring Larry Semon en
titled "Well I'll Be," will be shown.
This is an uproarous scream of a com
edy and one that is really funny. So

MUCKLESTONE, Cry of the Hour! With its stock rising
in price at phenomenal rate, this strong company is rapidly
forging into line as one of the big organizations of the
Texas fields. The par value of the stock is $5! The com
pany is drilling its first well, but it is drilling it right beside
"sensational production in the Burkburnett field, and the
imminent possibility of even greater production develop
ing has already forced a rise of $3 in the price.
UP TO $50 and the rapid exhaustion of the stock alloted
for the public to buy is the prediction freely expressed by
those who know conditions in the fields and the markets.
MUCKLESTONE GUARANTEES, to pay its stockholders
75 per cent of its production in DIVIDENDS and to use
only the remaining 25.- per. cent for development work.
This work will be pushed to the limit of physical resources
and new wells will be sunk as rapidly as possible, each in
the heart of producing areas. DON'T MISS THIS
CHANCE.
Our Million Making Acres

NO FEAR BOLSHEVISM
WILL GAIN FOOTHOLD
IN U. S. SAYS WILSON
NEW YORK, May 13. William B.
Wilson, secretary of labor, has no fear
that bolshevism will ever obtain a
foothold in the United States, ho
said at a luncheon at the United Waist
League of America.
"My reason tor this belief," he de
clared, "is that we are. developed
much more, from the standpoint of de
mocracy, than any country in Europe.
We can make progress without force,
unlike some other countries. Force
used for overthrowing autocracy may
be the highest form of patriotism, but
force used to dethrone democracy is
treason to the masses of the people.
For two years the department of la
bor, with a small force has fought the
philosophy of the I. W. W. and bol
shevism, which are closely allied."
Mr. Wilson believed, he said,
through labor unions throughout the
United States would repudiate bol
shevism, which quite falsely claimed
to protect the proletariat.
"The bolshevik! leaders consider
only themselves." declared Mr. Wilson.
"Their only purpose is the rule as the
czars and emperors of Europe have
dene. They even go farther than that.
for they propose to set up an obliga
tory and compulsory form of living.
Men are not to be allowed to leave
their jobs, under certain conditions,
even If they want to."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 15. Frequent
pauses marked the session of the
j s:ock exchange today, although trad
ing was again active and broad.
Price changes were mainly upward,
but the list manifested no very defi
nite trend until the final hour, when
highest quotations were made.
Steels, coppers and allied ' silver
shares were the chief elements of
strength., together with equipments.
Rails also went up, numerous dividend
paying shares registering advances of
1 to 2 points with secondary or minor
issues, presumably on, the growing
conviction that legislation aiming at
thei rbetterment is near at hand. '
Metals forfeited part of their ad
vantage on publication o fthe quarter
ly reports of several porphyry com
panies, including Utah and Nevada
Consolidated, which disclosed heavy
losses in earnings, but these were
largely regained in the spirited ad
vance which accompanied the close.
United States Steel made Ja net
gain of points, but the Independent
groups rose from 2 to 4 points.
American Car, American and Baldwin
Locomotive and New York Brake were
the outstanding features at 2 to 6
points advance.
. High-priced oils ' were under pres
sure most of the time, but Mexican
Petroleum turned the tide, rising . 4
points, Texas company recovering a
3 point loss and General Motors also
rallying.
Minor shippings strengthened, .but
that division as a whole was irregular.
Leathers, tobaccos, utilities and food
and fertilizer shares were mostly
higher. Sales amounted to 1,475,000
shares.
Local tractions were the strongest
features of the firm bond market'
Liberty issues - also showed more
Jsteadines,?. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $12,275,000. Old United
States coupon 4's rose per cent on
call.
CHICAGO, May 13. Decided set
backs in the price of corn resulted
today largely from the fact that
weather conditions for planting and
for the crop movement were better
than had been looked for. Tho mar
ket jclosea weak, 2M,c to 44c nat
lower, with July $1.64 to $1.64
and September $i;56 . to $1.56.
Oats finished lVsC to lc down and
provisions off 5c to 45c.
In the absence of predicted rains,
it was said that notable progress' with
plowing and other .field work would be
made in many sections or the corn
belt, and that dry weather where most
needed was the rule. It was a popu
lar opfnion also that the 10c advance
yesterday had been altogether too
sweeping, and that a reaction today
would surely follow. Besides offerings
to arrive from the country were larger
and eastern shipping demand was
poor. Under such circumstances, the
bears readily obtained again the con
trol of the market and although ral
lied were numerous ,the close wa.s
virtually at the lowest point of the
session, influenced partly by word
that four cargoes ( of Argentine corn
had arrived in New York since Satur
day. , ' ''
Auspicious crop' reports tended to
weaken the oats market.
Provisions were dull and low-ar in
sympathy with the action of grain and
hogs.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, May 13. Cotton
closed at 27.33 with the general list
closing at a net gain of 45 . to 60

A NERVOUS WRECK
from Three Years' Suffering. Says
. CardoiMade HerYeiL
Texas City, . Tex. la an interesting
itatement, Mrs. Q. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable tb
do any of my woik.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
ust from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took CarduL I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ego, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
taking CarduL
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardul.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troublesmade
from medicinal ingredients recommended

proven that the books are right. Begin

Phelps Dodge Mercantile company's J
barn which is being erected on a large i
tract of land adjoining Johnson addi-j
tion "is progressing- rapidly and it is
expected that it will be ready for oc-;
cupancy.by May 20., The present loca
tion; of the city barn Is at the foot of
Slag Dump hill where it has remained
for 14 years. The original site of the
company's barn was on the present
site of the Bisbee Improvement com
pany's offices, and it was in 1905 that
the barn was removed to its-present
location. '
. The new building will be of wood,
occupying a lot 50 by 100 feet. The
roof will be covered with corrugated
iron while the floor will be of cement.
In the near future a stablelarid corral
will be built adjacent to the new
building which will be used to house
trucks, wagons and teams of the Lo
well and Warren stores.
The reason for the new building at

of the present building is impeding the
work of development in connection
with the mines and transportation for j

Mem Part of Duke Field Gets Important WeiF
Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Friday, May 9. 1919
Our first well will start drilling May 26th, right in the heart of the biggest developments in the Texas oil
fields, and with producing wells near by on all sides it isn't a question of "Will we get oil" in this location it's
merely a matter of "How big a well can we expect?" '. Judging by the wells surrounding our lease we can con
fidently look forward to from 1 ,000 to 4,000 barrels daily production while a gusher of the 1 0,000 barrel class is not
at all unlikely.
There are a few thousand shares of Texas Duke Stock left but the demand has become so lively, due to the sen
sational developments in the field and our own drilling activity, that we expect to go "over the top" any day. Stock
is now selling at $ 1 par but will positively advance when
our well starts down on the 26th From present indica-- 62' ACTCS UlC WOnderflll RZllZtt FltU
tions there mav bft no stock left at that time. O
