Nationalists Demand
HomeRuU In Ireland;
Lloyd-GeorgeFlayed
Premier, Under Fire, Promises Home Rule To Sections That
Want It, Only To Invite Wrath of Ulsierites, Opposing It,
Forcing Issue Back To Old Position of Uncertainty
Nationalists Inflamed.
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Mar. 7. The presen
tation by the Irish Nationalists
in the house of commons this
evening of a resolution calling
for the immediate application of
the home rule statute to Ireland
Precipitated one of the bitter ses
sions in months and threw the
home rule question back into it
old position of uncertainty.
The resolution forced the gov.
ernment into a declaration of poli
cy towards self-government,
namely that any part of Ireland
that wished home rule could have
it but that no coercion would be
employed to compel Ulster to ac
cept it.
At the same time, the proposal
drew from the Ulsterites the ulti- t
matum that they would not ac
cept, which, coupled with the gov- .
ernment's pronouncement effectu
ally crushed alt hopes for a speedy
settlement
George Called Turn-Coat
The Nationalists tonight headed by
their leader, John Redmond, were in
conference, having withdrawn in a
body from the house of commons and
Mr. Lloyd-George was facing his first
embarrassing situation since he as
sumed the premiership. For more
than an hour before the Nationalists
left the house, the premier had faced
a whirlwind of angry -censure from
the Nationalists, which at times forc
ed him to take his seat because he
could not make himself heard. He
was called a turn-coat on the home
rule question, and one Nationalist ex
claimed: - .
"Hangiuan Carson! ! He is only tit
to be a hunt man, not first loid nf the
admiralty!"
The Hate of Ireland
The Nationalist resolution was
introduced by T. P. O'Connor,
who asserted that the manner in
which the government had han
dled the Irish rebellion bad trans
formed a friendly people into one
filled with bitter hatred against
England. He pleaded that home
,: rule should be put into prepara
tion immediately for the sake of
Ireland and in the interests of
England, the empire and the al
lies. Lauds Wilson
At one point he paid tribute to the
President of the United States saying .
that President Wilson in his recent j
speeches and notes had shown that I
the United States government recog-1
nized the rights of small nations and,
the principle of nationality. He called I
attention to the valiant service ren
dered by the Irish troops at the front
and asserted that they had enlisted
with the understanding that home
rule was to be applied to their coun
try. In conclusion he said there were
only two ways of remedy settlement
or coercion. He favored settlemenL
Redmond Pacifies
Mr. O'Connor was followed by Wm.
A. Redmond, who made an impass
ioned plea for a compromise between
the Nationalists and Unionists and
sat down amid the applause of the
house.
Ulsterites Stirred up
Thus far things had been running
smoothly, but Lonsdale, speaking for
the Unionists, threw a wrench into
the machinery by declaring Ulster
wanted nothing to do with home rule
of this sort, and sarcastically remark

ACTION Wl ON GERMAN
EXPECTED HOURLY, MAY ARM
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Mar. 7. New act
ion by President Wilson within the
next few days in the situation result
ing from the German unrestricted
submarine campaign, was expected
confidently today. If the form of the
action has been determined upon it
was not revealed. The possibilities
are the arming of American merchant
men: the convoying of the vessels by
warships; the immediate calling of
an extra session of congress and the i
placing of American ships desiring to j
pass through the danger zone under
government control.

WASHINGTON, Mar. 7. Demo
crats and Republicans of the sen

for early modification of senate
procedure so as to make filibus
ters such as defeated the armed
neutrality bill impossible in the
future.
The Democrats voted unani
mously to support a rule under
which debate could be limited by
a two thirds vote, recommended
by a conference committee of ten,
five representing each party as
the best way to solve the filibus
ter problem. The Republicans I
voted 30 to 2 to support the same j
change.

NOTICE TO CANDIDATES
The Review's biff special v'jte
offer, the best that will appear
"Tf onOiow until" the close of this
contest, ends tonight sharp at 9
o'clock, and all candidates who
expect I j .oceive special votes
for their subscriptions must be
at contest headquarters by that
hour. The contest editor will con
sider it a favor if the candidates
will t'jine early and often during
the day in order that be will not
have to take everyone's orders at
the last hour.
Every candidate is
one is a two-to-one
a favorite no
bet, so sayeth
everybody.
That is the way it has been from
the beginning, and that is the vay it
stands right now. The race in reality
yesterday was so close, not inont.Vm
ing any names, that the fourth can
didate was just s6 votes behind the
candidate in third place, and the dif
ference between all is comparatively
nothing.
Therefore it is just the difference
of a few votes at this time that can
change the standings, and the lack of
not getting your subscriptions .now.
today, before the big vote srheJul ?
expires tonight, may be just c!i'ou;h :
to lack puttins
you in the lead by tc- j
night.
Of course, what is fair for one is
fair for another, and those who don't
i
i
get their subscriptions in today will
get them in tomorrow or next day cr
next week, but the big fact remains
that the quicker Vur friends sub-!
scribe the sooner you will attain a '
safer lead among your competitors. !
Candidates who are making a real
effort are getting real results, the
territory still offers opportunities for
more subscriptions and if you are not j
pottinp thom it i ntiito nrrihnhle
are not putting your .shuulUerj to tue-j

If you really want to win and you
lack the spirit now, you'll have to ;
take on an extra close of vim to make;
up for the decrease in the V'le sche
dule later, after tonight. If you can '
do that you will probably catch up. ;

house.
One member suggested that the or-

retained by the Democratic postmas

what would happen if the one man
certified from the examination were
a negro. The postmaster genernl, ac
cording to those present, replied that
the examination would have to take
place and that there would be "no
special privilege to any one."

I Coming to the Eagle theatre today
only is the Bluebird feature. "The
Price of Silence," is Dorothy Phillips,
one of the most beautiful and talented
of screen stars. Miss Phillips is a
Baltimore giri and it was in Baltimore
that she made her first stasje appear
ance in George Fawcett's st'jck com
pany. Three years in the Savage pro
duction?, "Mary Jane's Pa" and
"Every Woman" followed, and she cre
ated the title role in the New York
production, "Pilate's Daughter." For
one season she played opposite Fran
cis X. Bushman at the Essanay com
pany, and two years ago became a
member of the U niversal company.
J'jseph De Orasse, who has taken
Miss Phillips' screen direction as a
star in Bluebirds, introduced Louise
lively to the series when the Austra
lian beauty first appeared in American
pictures. It was Mr. De Grasse who
directed Miss Phillips in several of
her recent Universal features, includ
ing "If My Country Should Call," a
recent release.
In "The Price of Silence" this tal
ented ac tress has the best role sh
ever played a part most exacting in
high emotional work, while calling, as
well, for adaptability in comedy and
lighter shading of screen artistry. The
production was made fij;n V. Carey

William S. Hart is, undoubtedly, the
leading actor on the American screen
stage today who depicts western char
acters. One of the peculiar things
about Hart is that his best characters
have been bad men, such as he ap
pears in today at the Orpheum theatre
when he presents "The Return "Jl
Draw Egan".
Draw Egan is fast on the "pull" of
a gun and his story is one of the best
ever filmed. Months ago Hart ap
peared in "Draw Egan" and the pres
ent release is a continuation of that
story. bu5 separate in itself.
Whenever Hart appears in the War
ren District his pictures are certain
to attrac t those who desire to see a
good attraction, well presented. In
"The Return of Draw Egan" the at
mosphere, photography and situations
compel t he verdict that it is Hart''
best. It will appear but two days a

Having danced their way to fame
in the European capitals and in South
America, the internationally celebrat
ed Maurice and Florence Walton are
now making their motion picture de
but in the Fa'iious Players-Paramount
picture "The Quest or Life, which is
the attraction at the Royal for today
only. Ashley Miller, who directed
the production, adapted the story
from the English play, "Ellen Young."
Maurice and Florence Walton have
probably done more to bring the
dance to its present high state of per
fection and to spread Its popularity
than any other two people in the
wjirld. It was Maurice who introduc
ed the Argentine Tango to Europe and
America after he had studied it in
South America. The celebrated
Apache Dance, which Is performed in
"The Quest of Life" was also created
by Maurice after he had seen the
crude performance in the Apache dens
of Paris. Having danced these, and
many other steps of the exclusive
Biltmore Hotel in New York and on
ffce stages of the lending theatres in
practically all of the princinal cities,
this popular pair can truthfully be
said to have spread the gosnel of met
ric grace all over the country.
Many are the delightful experiences
which Maurice and Miss Walton have
had 'while dancing before royalty in
the European courts but perhaps their
ost unioue and gratifying achieve
ment was that which they accomplish
ed in the case of Queen Mary of Eng
'and. After seeing the Tango per
formed by several dancers of indiffer
ent merit. Her Majesty placed an ab
solute ban on the dance at court and
". aecordinely becume tabooed in Lon
don society. At a ereat ball given by
nnc of the Russian dukes. Maurice
nd Miss Walton were invited to
dance. After they had won the ap
plause of the queen, her permission
"as granted to allow then to give
their version of the Tango. At. the
omnletion of the dance. Her Majesty
nplauded the pair and promntly lift
d the ban on the Tanso with the re
mark that she had no idea it could be
-erformed so gracefully.
"The Quest of Life," however, is
ot merely a dancing picture. It is a
"ery dramatic story pf a girl of lowly
parentage who is ambitious for her
future. Just as she- seems about to
-"Uze her dreams, the doctor declar
es that she bas but one pore ver to

see as much of life as she can in that

gaged by a theatrical manager and
"core again on the stage, but Maple
ton, the manager, begins to cast cov- j
etous eyes upon Ellen. The girl's '
nealth breaks under the strain, and i
Maurice secretly sends her to a sanl-
tarium, for which act of kindness
Mapleton later assumes credit. A se
ries of dramatic situations lead to the
discovery of the truth, however, and
Mapleton retires very ungracefully
from the competition for the heart of
Ellen.

HYPHENATED GUARD
ABUSED PRESIDENT
BETRAYED COUNTRY
Thursday Morning, March 8, 1917.
The Last Day.
By statutory provision the first! session of the third j
state legislature ends tcnight at midnight, or when the
tvro branches allow the clocks in their respective bodies
tv alight Oii that figure of time. The net results cf the
session have been very disappointing, from practically
every standpoint, yet i(jis with a feeling of relief that the
end is viewed. Though no constructive legislation has
been enacted, no insane laws have been perpetrated on
the people of the state.
Legislatures are necessary evils. Tiey were created,
originally, for the purpose of enacting wise laws for the
people. In the United States they have, in many cases,
degenerated into bodies whose chief object is to draw a
salary at the expense cf the public. The good they do is
;mall and the evil ctftimes by far over--eighs the former.
S-.ii has Leen the experience of Arizona.
Arizona is a new state. When the first aggregat.on
of legislators swarmed upon Phoenix tJie chosen few
were determined that all of the ills, to which the body
politic is liable, should be eradicated. They were going
to administer a tocsin which would rid the hide and the
soul of a great state of some parisitical growth. The
net results have been to add trouble, where there were
none before, and to augment a taxable burden already
..e r li.It .u c.n.ead t'.at :.me 0O0J tuiujs
have nt emanated from over-zealous and' untrained law
m-rs. 1hi.se god things, however, have been easily
. t. iien and contaminated ' by the grievous mistakes
made by the legislators.
Prore.:6iveism has been the byword of the people cf
. ri una. It has come to be a fetish with many and its
sound, if diagnosed, will ring like a pea in an empty
lw...e. It c.embles in the balance and convinces a slow
learning public of its emptyness and futility.
Now a third state legislature is fast coming to an end.
We see the tax rate rising, in an indirect manner, and we
can find little cause for such an increase except the de
sire on the part cf the faithful to secure lucrative em
.l.yment at the exjen.;e of the taxpayers. We have
commissions and commissioners and in the aggregate
they constitute one large mass of omissions. We have
been saddled with all of the harness, the noise and tu
signs of 'progress' and we find that nothing has been
changed except our annual bill from the city, country
and state.
With the closing of the third state legislature we again
breath a sigh of relief and will rest for twenty-two months
in the assurance that no ardent legislator is planning to
take away our birthright or to compel our chickens to
observe Sundays. We wait for the next session with the
hope that some saner mood will come upon the people of
Arizona and adopt a legislative system which will induce
able men and women to participate in the state's most
important office.
Till then, Adieux!

Supercilious England may no longer view Americans
with contempt for our gum-chewing habit. England it
self is now chewing gum. And according to all accounts, ,
it "charms the ojiewer" across the pond just as it does
here. This distinctively American product, for which
there was formerly no sale whatever abroad, is now go
ing to England at the rate of more than 20,000,000 sticks I
a month.
It is used mainly by the army. So great has become
the chicle vogue among the Tommies that it is said sticks
of gum are now issued as rations during a battle. The
process of mastication is found to soothe the soldiers'
nerves In time of stress, just as it has for years soothed
the nerves of normally nervous Americans. It also adds
to their sense of comfort by keeping their throats moist
when otherwise they would be parched from thirst or
fear.
The Canadian soldiers are given credit for the inno
vation helped, of course, by the thousands of Americans
who have joined the British army. When they went to
the training camps of Englaud and the fighting zone in
northern France they carried gum with them, and chewed
and chewed until the habit, was taken up by their com-

thing nowadays to see bcareded Frenchmen on the ImhiIc-

BOOTLEGGERS FLEE
TO MOUNTAINS AFTER
ATTACKING OFFICERS
The four Mexican bootleggers who
opened fire on Sheriff Harry Wheeler
and Deputy Sheriff Lafe Gibson near
Kelton early Tuesday morning, are be
lieved to be in hiding in the Chirica
huas. With the return to Tombstone
of the officers, details of the affair
were available yesterday. Wheeler
and Gibson had made their bed on the
j'oad beside the sheriff's car when the
Mexicans opened fire Tuesday morn
ing. The officers immediately re
turned the fire, and the skirmishing
continued for an hour. During the
fighting one burro was killed and an
otner wounded. One of the Mexicans
was also wounded. The Mexicans had
the advantage in the fighting, as the
officers were attacked when the moon
was at tneir backs, making it difficult
for them to see their assailants, while
the Mexicans had no trouble in locat
ing the officers but seemed to be poor
marksmen.
Wheeler and Gibson returned the
Mexicans' fire until the officers had
but a few cartridges left. They then
waited until just before sunrise and
then flashed the headlights of their
machine on the bootleggers' camp and
prepared to "rush it". The Mexicans,
however, had fled. In the 'meantime
L'nder Sheriff Guy We.lch and Deputy
Sheriff Harry Rafferty left the county
seat with ammunition and rifles to
assist their brother officers. Owing
Uj a mistage in the transmission of the
message telling where Wheeler and
Gibson were posted, the officers were
delayed several hours while searching
for Wheeler and Gibson, arriving at
the scene of the trouble shortly be
fore noon. The trail of the Mexicans
was then taken up and followed until
it was lost in the Chiricahuas. All of
the booze, which was being transport
ed on -burros and horses, w as confiscated.

CHICAGO. Mar. 7. Cancellations
of purchases by seaboard exporters
had a depressing effect in wheat to
day. Closing prices were heavy,
to 3 net lower, with May at 1.87
to 1.87 and July at 1.57 to 1.57.
Losses were shown too in other lead
ing staples corn to 1 at 1 14 .
oats lc and proisions 30 to 92 cents.
At first the wheat market displayed
a tendency to bulge on account of.the
assumed promising outlook for con
tinued demand from European Inter
ests, but the upturn in prices led to
n-.urh realizing influenced to some ex
tent by snowfalls in the west, where
moisture has been lacking. Holders
also were more or less uneasy because
of chances of a surprise tomorrow in
the government report on farm re
serves. It was not, however, until
word came of the cancelling of a mil
lion bushels export purchase at Oma
ha that the market began to break
sharply. Announcements that Presi
dent Wilson would arm merchant
ships rallied the market to a moder
ate degree, but the effect proved to
be only transient.
Corn weakened with wheat and as
a result of talk that foreigners were
re-selling at the seaboard. Oats fol
lowed other grains, advancing early,
and then undergoing a sag.
General liquidation brought about
a notable tumble in the value of provisions.

NOVEL ARGUMENT IS
PRESENTED IN BOOZE

UHOL. L'UlllllU it-Hiim
Officers Are Really Guilty of
Transporting Liquor Found j
on Captives. Contends thei
Lawyer for Defendants.
If an officer arrests a man. escorts
htm fj a Jail and then finds th.-.t thp
man has a bottle of booze in his pos
session, which is suilty of "really
transporting the booze?
This was the question brought up
in Judge J. I.. Winters' rourt in Low
ell yesterday at tlie preliminary hear
ing of Charles Davis ind Norman
Craig, charged with tiolatius the
state prohibition- amendment. The
two men were arrested by Officers J'.e
Hodges and Hilly Brakelield while, it
Is claimed, they were drinking on the
streets of Lowell. After . the men
were taken to the Lowell jail by the
officers, the latter testified, a bottle
of wriskey was found in the posses
sion of each, as the result of which
complaints were filed in Judge Win
ters' court.
At the hearing yesterday. Attorney
Kyle, for. the defendants, contended
that the men were nVit guilty of trans
porting booze, as they were standing
still when arrested. He argued that,
inasmuch as the officers placed the
men under arrest and took them to the
jail, they, the officers, were really the
ones who transported the booze. At
torney Kyle asked that the men be
released on the grounds that officers
had themselves testified that they had
not se:n Craig or Dovis carry the
tfjoze, or did not know they had in
their possession until 'the arrests were
made. t
The motion for dismissal was de
nied, however, by Judge Winters, and
the men bound over to await the ac
tion of the superior court. Both were
released on $100 bonds each.
alleged rustler
is held to answer
DOl'GLAS. March 7. Charged with
having stolen a steer from the Four
Ear ranch, owned by Neel & Cj., L. F.
Lewis waived his preliminary hearing
yesterday afternoon before Justice of
the Peace D. T. Dunlap. and was
bound over to await the action of the
superior court. His bond was fixed
at $1000. Not being able to furnish
it. he is in jail.
The charges against him were
sworn to by Livestock Inspector
Dulaney, who has been d'jing consid
erable detective work on the case. It
is understood that he has coupled
Lewis up with the loss of at least one
and possibly other animals, and with
the sale t meat to restuiants and
other places in Douglas shortly after
wards. In camps recently used by Lewis, it
is alleged several cowhides were
found. The brand had been cut from
most V)f them but remained in the hide
of the Neel cow. on which the charge
was tiled.
In order to insure his appearance at
the trial. Judge Dunlap also placed
John I'a'rrish, chief witness for tlie
prosecution, under hail of $1000.

pptriotis?n and without hope of gain
for themselves.
Home Rule Proferrea
Premier Lloyd-George followed with
the pronouncement of the govern
ment, and. after stating that any part
of Ireland that wanted home rule
could have it, suggested two alterna
tives for the settlement of the differ
ences between the Irish factions. One
was a conference of Irishmen, and
the other was the setting up of a com
mission of inquiry.
Lloyd.George Jeered
Mr. Lloyd-George was continually
interrupted, and. as he proceeded, he
was greeted with angry jeers from
the Nationalists, who accused him of
deserting home rule.
As the premier sat down, ex Prem
ier Asquith rose and began a concil
iatory speech. He pointed out the
seriousness of the situation and ad
vocated a compromise. He suggested
that the ministers of the dominions
who are in England should be called
in to act as mediators and report to
parliament.
Redmond Spurns Plans
John Redmond, the Nationalist
leader, immediately took the floor and
declared in no uncetrain terms that
he would have nothing to do with fur
ther negotiations: he and his follow
ers, he said, had been fooled once be
fore. After his brief speech, the Na
tionalists went into conference. Tlie
only result of this meeting made
known was that the Nationalists vot
ed approval of Mr. Redmond's action.
Another meeting of the Nationalists
has been arranged for tomorrow.

GERMAN PLOT TO
INVADE INDIA IS
EXPOSED IN N. Y.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Mar. 7. Department
of Justice officials were preparing to
day for presentation to a federal
grand jury tomorrow of evidence con
cerning the German spy conspiracy
In jthis country- Important docu
ments arrived by messengers from
Washington which it was believed
would further connect Dr. Ernest Se
kunna, a German chemist, and Dr.
Chandre Chakraberty, a Hindoo 'phy
sician" with Wolf von Igel, attache of
the German embassy who sailed with
Count von Bernstorff after indict
ments against him had been dismiss- J
ed. Dr. Sekunna and Dr. Chakraber-1
ty, according to police, confessed that
they had plotted under direction of J
Von lgel to invade India with a mili-
tary force by way of China.
It was disclosed .that on February
28 Dr. Sekunna and Dr. Chakraberty
filed in the county clerk's office here
trade style certificates to operate un-I
der the names of the "Oriental Soeie-)
ty" and the "Oriental Kitchen" as '
well as to conduct a monthly maga-!
zine which it was represented, would
be devoted to "art, science, literature,
politics and commerce, especially of
India, China. Japan, Persia ami Tur
key," and be known as the "Oriental
Review."

The health cf the family
is an important question and
one that should receive thev
most careful consideration in
every real home.
S.S.S.
has brought new health conditions into thou
sands of home in America homes where true
advertising carries its message, backed by
the endorsement of the many, many people
who have used it and found that S. S. S. does
the work. '
S. S. S. stands first to-day as blood purifirr after
a fifty-year test. If there were notbinf else, that alone
would tell the story.
S. S. S. is guaranteed purely vegetable and is most
helpful, not only as a hi nod purifier, but also as a gen
eral tonic when the system is run down.
Owing to tbe success of S. S. S, there are many
imitations. Therefore, demand the genuine S. S. S. by
name. Tbe only object any dealer has in substitulina
is that lie makes mors profit on the substitute. Wattb
