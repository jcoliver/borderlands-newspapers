WASHINGTON. Jan. 10. Wom
an suiirsje by federal constitu
tional aniendmeat won in tne
bouse tonight with exactly ihe
required camber of affiniiatie
voles.
While members in their scats
and tiirongs in the galleries wait
ed with eager interest, the house
adcpted by a vote of 274 to l- a
resolution for submission to ite
statts of the so-called Su.-an B.
Anthony amendment for national
enfranchisement of women.
But for tne promise of Speaker
Clark to cast his vote from the
chair for the resolution if it was
needed, the change of a single
vote to the opposition ocid Itave
meant defea;.. Republican Leader
Mann, who came i:om a Baltimore
hopiuU w here he has been oncer
treatment ever since congress
ccnveted. and Representative
Sims of Tennessee, just out of a
sick bed, and hardly able u walk
wbica settled the issue.
Opens On Senile
Tlie house hardly had ad.onrr.f-d be
fore the suffrage champioas began
their fight for favorable action on tae
senate side of the capitol. Recent polls 1
there have indicated that the cms-;
sary two-thirds vote con'J not be mv'
tered. but encouraged by tae house
victory and couminz uic.n infl'ioiio
of President Wilson ::o cause to their
supjwrt last nigU. the suffragists'
hope to bring the sen.:? into lite t
as to have the ameudmeu h-j:'ore til
state legislatures duin ihe cuu:irg
year. They feel sureat least of forc
ing a vote in the senate belore tlie
present session ends.
Advocates of tie amendment had
teen supremely confident of the re
sult in the bouse after Fres-iient W;l
mn advised the members Who called
upon him last nisht to s;:ii.ort it.
They were so confident that the close
vote was receii-ed with amazement.
Some of the opponents were almost as
much surprised.
When the first roll call was finished
unofficial counts put the refi.it in
doubt, and before the speaker could
mike an announcement there was a
demand for a recapitulation. Then the
name of each member and the W3y he
was recorded was ead.
Announcement of the vote was
geeted with wild applause. Women
in the galleies lireally fell upo-i each
others necks, kissing and embracing,
and shouting, "Glory, glory ballelu
jah!" The resolution as adopted follows:
The Resolution
"Joint resolution proposing an
amendment to the ccr.stitution of the
Vnitetd Slates extending the right of
suffrage to women. Resolved by the
senate and house, two thirds of each
houe concurring trerein, that the fol
lowing article be proposed to the les- j
islatures of the several states as an j
amendment to the constitution of the i
United States, which, when ratified by J
threa fourths of said legislatures, j
shall be valid as part cf said constitu-1
tion, namely: '
"Article 1, Section 1 The right T;
citizens of the United States to vote '
shall not be denied or abridged by the
United States or by any state cn ax-1
count of sex. I
"Section 2 Congress shall have I
power by appropriate legislation to en- j
force the provisions of this article.
Amendments Beaten
Every attempt made to amend this
language was beaten. Representati-.e (
Card cf Ohio tried unsuccessfully to :
put on it the same limitation carried j
by the resolution for the prohibition j
constitutional amendment, that it
must te ratified by the states within !
seven years from the date of its sub-:
nvssion. Representative Moores of
Indiana soushtto have a rcferend-ira j
or special convention in each state re
quired. The Gard amendment was re-:
jocted to 244 and the Moores
amendment 131 to 272. '
When the final vote came on the
re o'trtion Representative Austin of
Tennessee challeneed toe vote of Rep
resentative Dominick of South Caroii- ;
na. who appeared late in the roll csll
and said he had not heard his name '
called. Mr. Dominick told the speaker
he was in the hall and listening and
did not hear bjs name called. His vote
was then recorded.
The speaker watched the vote, pre
pared to cast t'.t omn into the breach
if necessary. "One more negative
vote. he explained afterward, as he
chuckled over the victory, "would
have chanced tlie situation and the
amendment resolution would have
been lost. In which even I would have
directed the clerk to call my name and
that would have been just sufficient
to carry it." Of the to'al membership

WASHINGTON. Jan. 10. Every;
phase of tBe war department's prep-j
arations for battles against Germcny ;
was outlined and defended by Secre-:
tary Baker today before the senate ! '
military committee. He answered ;
those who have criticised the depart-'
ment during the committee's investi
gation with the assertion that no sch '
armv as that now under the American ;
flag ever has been raised, equipped or i
trained so quickly and that never be-J
fore had such provision been made
for the comfort and health of an army.
The secretary read an exhaustive.

when it was concluded questions be j

all day tomorrow. i
Delays Questioned. I
Chairman Chamberlain and other '
committeemen wanted to know par
ticularly about delays in furnishing
machine guns and rifles and much at-:
tention was devoted to the army's sup- i
ply purchasing system. Mr. Baker ad
mitted there has been some mistakes!
and delays but declared that all fight- j
ing men in France were adequately j
equipped and armed, and that all sent
oTer would be. He took full resnonsi- i
bility for delay in approving a ma-'.
chine gun. upholding the value of the ;
Browning gun now in use. He also
said the superior weapon obtained by,
having the British Enfield rifle re-j
chamhonxl tar American ammunition '
compensated for the delay there. !
More than 1.500.K0 Americans are '
cow under arms. Secretary Baker!
said, and an army of substantial siie
already is in France ready for active
service.
Members of the committee were
' frank in their disapproval of the secret
, pnrch,sing system of the department !
'Mr. Baker, however, insisted that it;
was essential to guard against pubuci-'

Tells of Contract.
The secretary said he cancelled the.'
much discussed rag sorting contract,

ing work itself. The flsse Sorting!
j company, he said, was to get a profit j
jof only one half cent a "pound. !

"Powder is the most uncertain thing in the world,
except a woman." declared an old miner yesterday in
sadly commenting on the tragedy on Sacramento hill
in Bisbee, where three iren lost their lives nd nine
were badly hurt. "I have known." he west on. "a case
cp in Butte where a case of giant powcer fell a dis
tance of four feet and exploded with frightful effect,
and again I have seen a case of powder from this same
consignment fall 1.400 feet down a shaft and light as
dead and as harmless as a case of canned corn. I re
member, once, up in lc'aho, where we got in twelve
cars of giant powder and dynamite, and the men un
loaded eleven of those cars before dinner, all safe and
sound, and then that last car exploded all by itself alone
on the track, without any one going rear it and killing
and crippling sixteen men "
And what the old miner said about high explosive is
strange as it may seem, tinged and laced and laden with
truth. All the care in the world, and the expense and
intelligent effort, cannot entirely eliminate all uncer
tainty from the uses of high explosive. The government
experts, the railroads, the navy, the greatest chemists,
all have suffered from unexplained and terrible explosions
of the deadly element they have found necessary to em
ploy. Rock cannot be removed and copper mined without
the use of explosive. There Is always a risk, both to
operator and miner - and expert handler and engineer.
All that human intelligence and experience and fore-
' l
sight and expenditure of money and research and extra
ordinary precaution and rigid regulation and minute in
spection could do. -s done every minute of the day and
night in the operations on "Sac" hilL Witness the res
suit of these, that there had not been a life lost or ever
a severe injury during the many months of this giant
operation or the hundreds of thousands of tons of ore
removed or the thousands of tons of explosive used up
to this time.
But. una -countable end unavoidable as it was. the
tragedy moved this entire community to sincere grief
and deep sorrow.
Operators, citizens, business men and all classes, as
well as the miners. a.re bowed down with depression and
uncontrollable feeling because of this great loss to life
and limb that came after the many long years during
which a wonderful record for safety and security In t
hazardous calling had been maintained in the mines of
the entire district.
The Tragedy on "Sac" j
Hill - !
Far be it from this newspaper to precipitate anj
county-seat row. but since, sooner or late, the march
of progress will surely bring this matter to the front In
Cochise county, why not speak out plainly now and
declare the natural losic or the case? In the matter
of central location, wealth, population and roadways,
Bisbee is the natural ar.d ordained county seat of
Cochise county. The o'd argument about there not
being room in the city for a cre-Htable courthouse and
ard falls to the ground when one points to the vista
of Warren, a suburb of Bisbee. where a wonderful site
may be secured. Bisbee took no part in the recent
county-seat agitation started by Douglas interests, and
may not care to press the matter at this time. But the
fart remains that the wealth and population of the
county are mainly located in the southern part, and it
is unnatural and foolish and shortsighted to fondly
believe that five-sixths of our citizens will continue to
uncomplainingly travel many miles over the mountains
to an almost isolated community of other days every
time they have county business to transact. Soon or
'Ne ,U:is eoun'yseat removal question mill force itself
to the front, and if Bisbee wants the county capital it
is time to consider the matter. Consider the fact that
over six hundred thousand dollars was spent in the
Warren suburb last year alone, and you will have some
idea of what an important and beautiful pla-e it is fast
coming to be, and the building activity there is con
tinuing all through the wirter with undiminished vior
-TELL 1 HE TRUTH-
"Tell the truth and speed up the war." says the Kan
sas City Star.
If Northcliffe had not told the truth about the mis
takes of the British ordnance department, tens of thou
sands of lives might have been lost through the failure
to supply the armies with high explosive shells.
If the truth had not been told about the American
ordnance bureau, the effective entrance of this country
into the war might hare suffered an additional delay
of several months because of the failure of the chief of
ordnance to handle an overwhelming task for which he
had neither training nor natural capability. Loyalty to
incompetent officials may readily prove the deepest dis
loyalty to the nation.
An idea of the piffle and falsehood with which the
German government, through the newspapers that they
control, body and soul, is feeding to its people may be
gained from the following: A German major, captures
by the English in a recent drive In Flanders, was told
that be would be taken to England for imprisonment to
the end of the war. The major laughed heartily over
this information and declared that he had read in Ger
man papers of unimpeachable authority that the English
army in France was cut off from home and that a Ger
man army of occupation was on British soil. Imagine
this fairy tale being swallowed by an entire nation. A
major is supposed to be a man of education and force
of character, and his viewpoint would naturally be that
of the most enlightened people of his country
Field Marshal Douglas-Haig's report on the last year
of the war ought to brsce and stiffen the weak-kneed
and faltering ones of all allied nations. This calm, cool,
conservative and able csptain declares it has been a
good year fcr the allies and a disastrous one for the
Hun. He confidently experts final victory and is abso
lutely sure that the Hun will soon begin to break nnder
the terrible strain of the allied guns and the allied
pressure all along the line.
And still the German propagandist and disloyal or
timid American citizen continue to hamper and harass
and annoy this nation in its supreme war-work effort,
and right in the Warren district, too. The Bisbee banker
who told the Review a day or two ago of the silly story
circulated to the effect that money placed in the Kink
could not be drawn out until after the war. told another
story yesterday, upon which his customers are being,
filled by knaves or fools, that is still worse. He said
that patrons have come to him with the tale that for
every one hundred dollars they placed in the bank they
would have to pay an income tax of six per cent, or six
dollars. Whoever is circulating this rot and rubbish
is an enemy of Uncle Sara in war time. The only special
income tax upon individuals, as published in the Review
yesterday, is a rax of two per cent upon incomes ol
unmarried men of over one thousand dollars and upon
incomes of married men over two thousand collars, and
the tax only applies to that part of the income in excess
of these sums mentioned.

No one can blame the average American citizen for
getting "riled" and all worked up over the trifling,
piddlirg. technical, twaddling tactics of the ordnance
and .war departments that resulted in the Inexcusable
delay in equipping our soldiers with an adequate supply
of the best machine guns in the world. America indented
the machine gun. Tha Catling, the Maxim and the
Lewis guns, each epochal in its day. were the products
of American hand and brain. And then to think that
American soldiers should have to wait for machine-gun
equipment while an old grandmother of an ordnance
department head and a trifling and technical war secre
tary fussed and argued rnd hesitated and experimented
over different makes and wasted time that was as
precious as heart's blood! Congress is going to try and
take some of this misplaced power from the hands of
Baker and Daniels, the great incompetents of the cabinet,
and the nation should stand behind congress in this
effort.
A centralized and autocratic power with three vassals
is fighting four free nations; that is the situation today,
and we must be patient over the mistakes and delays
and lost opportunities of the allies compared to tlie
efficiency of the Hun. This talk of Germany fifth-tine
the world is all piffle. She has three allies, and every
one of them, under har war teachers. Is strong with
fighting men and munition makers. The allies are emu
posed of England. France, tlaly and the United States.
Four against four. Four prepared nations attains! four
unprepared nations. A year or two years hence the
real strength of the allies and the weakness of Germany
and her vassals will be much more apparent than it is
now under the camouflage of the first phases of the
mighty confict-

preparation to make ready for war. A certain American

actual and present military importance can be consid- '

The American army which is to he
sent into the battle to make the world
safe for democracy is rapidly being
formed. In the nine months since the
United States declared that a state of
war existed with Germany the army
has risen from 212.034 officers and
men to 1.539.509 officers and men.
This statement has been made by
Secretary Baker, who declared that
no other army in the history of the
world ever has been raised, equipped
or trained so quickly. The secretary
added that a "substantial force of
Americans already was in France and
fit for active service and that full
equipment is on hand for every man
who will be sent to F.urope during
191S.
Infantry Inactive.
On the fighting fronts the infantry
is inactive except for small raiding
operations, but the artillery duels con
tinue intense on various sectors. In
northern Italy snow has fallen to a
depth of from three to five feet, bring
ing operations to a halt. The move
ment of supplies to the enemy armies
in the hills is being greatly impelled
and the indications at present are that
fighting of great intesity will be im
possible while the snow lies on the
ground.
Peace Not Discussed.
Unofficial dispatches dealing with
the deliberations between the Bolshe
viki and the Teutonic allies at Brest
Litovsk indicate that for the present
peace is not being discussed, but the
proposition of the Bolsheviki to
change the scene of the negotiations
to Stockholm is the paramount issue.
Trotzky. the Bolsheviki foreign minis
ter, is said to have threatened the del
egates of the central powers that if
they do not acede to his request for
a transfer of the pour parlers to
Sweden the voice of their own people
and the strong arm of the Russian
democracy will be felt by them The
German delegates in Petrograd have
requested Sweden to act as go-bet-tween
with the allies.
A dispatch emanating from Switzer
land asserts that Bulgaria and Russia
have signed a separate peace compact,
but that the Russians have rejected
' separate peace terms on the proposals
effered by Turkey
Meanwhile, fichting continues In

of these operations indicate that the
