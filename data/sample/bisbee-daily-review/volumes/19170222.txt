ANARCHY, SAYS GRIFFIN
With Scores of Millions of Bushels of Wheat Choking Chicago
Elevators, Millions in East Are Threatened With Starva
tion, Unless Some MigKty Power Breaks Railway Con
gestion, So Foodstuffs Can Get Thru, He Says.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Feb. 21. President J. P. Griffin of the Chi
cago Board of Trade today telegraphed to the Interstate Com
merce Commission and to the presidents of eastern railways
insisting that unless an immediate embargo were placed on all
products east-bound out of Chicago, except fuel and food
stuffs, the' country will face the danger of anarchy and rioting.
In a public statement this afternoon Mr. Griffin asserted
that in addition to 40,000,000 bushels of grain in Chicago
awaiting shipment there are from fifty to seventy-five millions
more in country elevators held up because of the congestion
here.
Raps Commission
"I have no hesitancy in declaring '
that both the commission and the rail
roads are completely overwhelmed
and have lost grasp of the situation,"
said Mi. Griffin, "as a matter of fact i
the intervention of the interstate com '
merce commission has been harmful i
rather than otherwise, and the meth-!
ods of relief insisted upon, or offered i
fcy them, has been fanciful and with
out any substantial results."
Help Needed Now
The statement asserts that un
less a remedy is found the demor
alization will extend to all com
modities. It concludes:
"I am willing to predict that
within lees than 30 days the com
merce of this country will be pros
trated unless some large and
more influential power than the ,
railroads and the interstate com- '
merce commission is placed in .
control of the matter."
Potatoes up 1,000 Percent
Mr. Griffin said that grain is today
the cheapest food commodity in the
world. He said that prices rere at
present are but 20 percent above the
level which has ruled during the war,
while "potatoes and produce general
ly are selling from 200 to 1,000 per
cent higher than the level of a year
ago."
"The distress at consuming points."
he continued, "is clearly demonstrat
ed by the prices prevailing for spot
grain. While the value at Chicago
and other western markets is moder
ate, grain for immediate delivery in
the east is selling at a premium of
from five to twenty cents a bushel
above Chicago parity, freight condi
tions considered."
109.000 Cars Short
His attention was invited to the of
ficial statement that the car shortage
of the country is now 109,000 cars.
"I don't know just what those fig
ures mean," he said, "but I do know
that we could use 20,000 cars in Chi
cago right now."
Telegrams along the lines given in
his statement were sent by Mr. Grif
fin to presidents of eastern railways
and to the interstate co-rmeree com
mission earlier in the day.
East "Hogging" Cars
In these be asserted among other
things that continuance of the pres
ent situation will lead to the danger
of anarchy and rioting. He asserted
that the root of the trouble lies in the
use of a disproportionate number of
cars on eastern roads for carrying
manufactured articles bringing the
railroads a higher revenue than grain
and foodstuffs. He said that muni
tions of war formed only a part of
two or three hundred articles which
were given preference in the matter
of cars.
U-BOAT WAR SERIOUS
ADMITS BRITISHER
(By Review Leased Wire.)
Germany's submarine campaign was
described to parliament by Sir Kd
ward Carson, first lord of the British
admiralty, as serious, but he said
measures had been taken by the ent
ente under which it would be mitigat
ed by degrees. From February 1,
when Germany began her intensified
submarine warfare, to February 18.
allied and neutral vessels aggregating
304.000 tons had been sunk. Sir Ed
ward said, as compared with tonnages
of 234,00(1 and 24,000 respectively for
the same period in December and
January.
Sir Edward announced that the ad
miralty had a record of forty en
counters with submarines during the
first 18 days'jf February and instanced
several occasions where underwater
boats had been captured or sunk, but
without going into particulars.
Coineidentally the German minister
of the navy, in an address before the
Reichstag asserted that Germany's
submarine expectations had been sur
passed and that there was reason to
suppose that not a single L'-boat had
been lost

WASHINGTON. Feb. 21. Drastic
measures of precaution were adopted
today by the chief railroads rf the
east to meet varying emergency needs
for coal and foodstuffs from the Mis
sissippi River to Maine, due to the.
acute shortage and congestion of
freight cars.
Chief of these measures was the
despatch of rush orders to all rail
roads concerned Mr the prompt tran
sportation of gas, coal and coke to 18
towns and cities in the middle west
where it was announced "possible in
terruption" of light, heat and powor
service would result unless the short
age was relieved at once.
The shortage was said to be most
acute at Indianap'olls, where the coal
supply for gas was reported to be only
three days ahead of requirements.

or gas coke has been cut to 23,000
tons, barely sufficient for three weeks

be better supplied than any other city
on the list.

(By Review Leased Wire).
PHOENIX, Feb. 21. The senate to
day practically agreed upon compul
sory military training in the normal
and high schools. A bill requiring
plan for voluntary training. After a
discussion of it in the committee Of
the whole the substitute was rejected
and the original bill slightly amended
was restored to its place on the cal-
endar. It carries an appropriation of i
U0.r,00 annually. The bill was agreed '
to as that . Members were not sure
that that was enough and the subject
was sent to a select Committee for in
vestigation. '
Blow for Bootleggers.
The senate passed a bill aimed at
bootlegging. It makes the sale of
liquor a felony punishable by from
two to five years in the penitentiary
but the second sale must be establish
ed to prove the offense.

were :

Nearly all Uie amendments by the ap

was cut down about $1,500,000. The

vessels and cargoes, and while Bhips
bound directly to and from German
ports with their cargoes were deemed
subject to confiscation after the ex
piration of the period of grace, the
same rigid rules were not applied to
neutral ships carrying goods bound
to or from Germany or Austria thru
adjacent neutral countries.
The practical effect of the new or
der is expected to be to throw into
prize court at once many ships and
cargoes which heretofore have been
subject to detention but not to cou
fiscation.
The United States has refused to
recognize the legality of the blockade
orders in council, and has reserved all
rights under international law as in

ister at Vienna leaves no doubt that

WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 The gen
erally accepted idea that President
Wilson will address congress again
on the German crisis before the end
of next week virtually was confirmed
today in official quaiters. There was
no announcement and it was said that
the President still was considering
his next step, but officials pointed
out the necessity of congress making
provision for any emergency which
might arise after adjournment ' and
explained that the President would
not go to the capitol to ask for a dec
laration of war but merely for author
ity to protect American rights.
Insists on Our Rights
The President, it was reiterated. Is
just as anxious as any member of the
senate or house to avoid , war, al
though determined that the rights of
the United States be respected. One
of his reasons for desiring action by
congress now instead of risking the
necessity for a special session, was
said to be a belier that a call for an
extra session in an emergency might
result in dangerous excitement.
Various, problems resulting from
the break in diplomatic relations wjth
Germany are being cleared up but it
was emphasized at the state depart
ment today that the one big issue fac
ing the American government , is the
continuance of Germany's submarine
campaign.
Expect Sailors' Release
It was revealed that on Monday a
vigorous demand for the release of
the American prisoners on the prize
ship Yarrowdale was forwarded to
Berlin, and it is fully expected that
the demand will be complied with.
On the submarine Issue it was stat
ed officially, tho only step on the part
of Germany which will satisfy the
American government will be the re-1
newal of the pledges given after the
Sussex was attacked.
In the face of reports on the atti
tude of Germany and Austria-Hungary
most officials think the time rapid
ly is approaching when diplomatic re
lations with the latter country will
be broken, and steps taken to protect
American merchantmen desiring to
pass through the dangerous area.
There still is a disposition on the
part or state department officials not
to discuss the Austrian situation. No
grouna tor any nope mat me Vienna i
government will repudiate Germany
position is to be found, however. So
far as can be learned no reply to the
note from the United States inquir
ing for a clear statement of Austria's
attitude has been received.

MINSTRELS READY
FOR PARADE AND 2
BIG PERFORMANCES
"Best Amateur Show I Have
Ever Seen," Says Al Detloft
at Conclusion of Stage Re
hearsal Yesterday.
"The best amateur show I have ev
er seen."
This was the opinion expressed by
Manager Al DetlofT of the Orpheum
theatre, after he had witnessed the
stage rehearsal of the Y. M. ('. A.
minstrel jubilee in his theatre yester
day afternoon. The same opinion was
voiced by every other person that
was present and will undoubtedly he
voiced by every one who goes to see
the performance either Friday or
Tuesday night. Only a few seals are
left for the opening night and, from
piesent indications, the second house
will be sold out before Saturday night
lleserved seat tickets for the jubilee
can be secured at iho Orpheum Imx
ffice.
Particular pains were taken in pre
paring the performance to localize it
as much as possible, and all of the
"gags have some sort ot local as
pect. In the iiiinstrel part there will
be about twelve sons: numbers, solos,
trios, quartette and choruses, and
each one has been rehearsed until
there is almost no chance of a single
man missing a single note. The
jokes, dances, marching and every
thing else have been rehearsed with
equal care.
Severat ffee features will be pre
sented by the minstrel men. The
first, a regular old-time minstrel par
ade will be staged on the streets Fri
day. In full costume and with a band
at their head, the minstrel men and,
in fact, every member of the olio acts
will march around town to. show the
public just what kind of a show they
may expect. The free thriller, how
ever, will be staged on top of the Or
pheum theatre either Friday after
noo nor evening by Physical Director
Mac MaeLaughlin. Mac will pile up
an array of tables, chairs and bottles
on the very edge of the Orpheum and
do some dare-devil feats on top of the
pile. The event will be a free attrac
tion of the kind that should draw a
tig crowd. Announcement of the
ttime the stunt will be staged will be
made in the Review tomorrow morning.

WASHINGTON AND PEACE.
Today is George Washington's birthday and after a
century and a quarter that Great American remains tht
keystone of America's foreign policy. His greatness as a
general, as an internal leader and as a forcaster of th';
ueeds'Of what was then a small country, with a small
purview, comes to light today in a way which would al
most give us grounds for believing that Washington was
superhuman.
Washington stood for peace. He was a peaceful man
but believed the best way to secure and maintain peace
was to be prepared to resent any and every insult offered
this, the United States. His acts, while general of the
revolutionary army, and later when he was the President
of the country, constitute one long record of the realiza
tion that pesce was obtainable through but one channel
preparedness.
People of the United States are prone to idolize their
forefathers. They are liable to overestimate their abili
ties. 1c is inconceivable, however, how the foresight of
some of them could be overestimated in any way. Wash
ington of a century and a quarter ago could well sit in
the national councils today and his advice would carry
the greatest of weight.
Listen to what Washington said to Congress in hi ;
first speech after re-election:
"I cannot recommend to your notice measures
for the fulfillment of our duties to the rest of ths
world, without again pressing upon you the necessi
ty of placing ourselves in a condition of complete de
fense and of exacting frcin them the fulfillment of
their duties towards us. The United States ought not
to indulge a persuasion, t'iat, contrary to the order of .
human events, they will for ever keep at a distance
those painful appeals to arms, which the history of
every other nation abounds. There is a rank due to
the United States among nations, which will be with
held, if not absolutely lost.-by the reputation of weak
ness. If we desire to avoid insult.we must be able
to repel it; if we desire to secure peace, one of th
most powerful instruments of our rising prosperity,
it must be known that we are at all times ready for
war." -
The words of Washington would fit well in the mouth
of the leading American of today. They are fraught wit1
sense and keen- foresight today as they were in
Their import has grown in every way- until it would
seem that he advocated the only course for the Unite 1
States to pursue.
Though, through the era of modern inventions, through
the multiplicity of advances made by the peoples of the
earth, general conditions have 'materially changed th
basic fact, enumerated in Washington's address has re
mained the same. In other words, though the earth ha:,
aged one hundred and twenty-five years, human natur-;
has changed but little.
On this occasion of the celebration of his birthday it
is meet that his countrymen should recognize in him tin
wonderful genius that he must have been. His life and
his work live after hiniLtt us hope that his example
may become engraved in the hearts of his people and
result in a better and bigger and more courageous Amer
asked that the resolution be passed in order to help the
eastern women. Does Mrs. Marsh forget how much the
eastern women aided a wise President last fall, when
the country was beset with dangers from every Hide and
when they attempted to use as catspaws the 'western
women, who actually had the vote? And does Mr3. Marsh
and some of her male supporters remember the answer
of the western women? They stood behind President Wil
son. Certainly the answer is most convincing to us that
the majority of the women in this great west are content
' to allow Congress to attend to its own business and let
that of the individual states alone.
I We hail Mrs. O'Neil as both farseeiug, constructive and
imminently sensible in her stand.
FINANCING A STAJE.
Every two years Arizona is afforded a pathe'ic ex
ample of how not to finance a state, wisely says tha Ari
zona Gazette.
I The system in vogueof establishing proper appropria
tions for the conduct of state affairs and institutions Is
positively driveling in its inadequacy. A cave man might
have worked out a more equitable method.
First a committee is appointed. This committee is
usually composed of well meaning gentlemen who don't
know anything about finances, but are willing to learn---and
tJ-ey must be taught at the expense of the people.
On this committee there are always many divergent
opinions. One man thinks some stenographer should be
paid $10 a month less or more than she is receiving; an
1 o.Ler feels that there is $100,000 difference one way or
' the other In the requisition for some public work. Tho
$10 item usually occupies as much of the time and atten
; tion of the committee as does the $100,000 feature and is
t' e cause for just as acrimonious debates and bad feel
ing. Heads of copartmcnts are haled before the committee
and put through an inquisition as undignified as it is un
called for. They are made to feel like suppliants for
charity, and in the end a hodge-podge bill, made up un
scientifically and with scant regard for the real require
ments comes forth to be haggled over and torn to pieces
and reconstructed in open session. This proceeding usu
ally take at least half of the time of a regular legisla
tive' session.
C;tn any one imagine a great corporation running its
business' in this fashion? Why is it that public a.Tairr.
cannot be conducted along semi-business lines at least.
Vl:y cannot there be presented to each legislature a com
plete audit setting fortli accurately the needs of eac.i
department and the sum required to conduct that depart
ment for the biennial period. Why must the taxpayer
always be the "goat."
It's time to stop running this state "by guess and by
golly," and if the Third legislature can point the way it
will not have lived in vain.

1916 FREIGHT RATE LOWEST ON RECORD.
The average freight rate per ton per mile on the rail
ways of the United States was lower in 1916 than it ever
was before and the average wage per employee for the
year was greater than ever before, says the Qaiiway Age
Gazette in an editorial in its current issue.
The Railway Age Gazette says: "The preliminary
summary of returns for the roads earning over $l,000,0no
a year, just, issued by the Bureau of Railway Economics,
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1916, shows, that the
average receipts per ten mile were 7.07 mills, as com
pared with 7.22 mills for the million-dollar roads for 1915.
and that the average compensation per employee, exclud
ing officers, was $840.62 as compared with $813.17 in 1915.
The returns, which are compiled from the annual reports
of t''c reads to the Interstate Commerce Commission, rep
resent roads having approximately 89 per cent of the en
tire railway mileage of the country and 97 per cent of
the operating revenues. The average receipts per ton
mile for all of the roads in the country will slightly ex
ceed the figure for the larger roads, but the complete fig
ures can hardly fail to show an approximately similar
reduction. In 1913 the average for all roads was 7.'!"
mills, which was lower than for any oilier reretit ytvr
except 1913. when the average was 7.29 mills. In 1!MU
the average was 7.48 mills. Tiie decrease is probably to
be accounted for by a greater proportion of low-rated
commodities, because there was an increase in the ton
nage of products of mines from 507,000,000 in 1915 to
646,000,000 in 1916, while the increase in other class -s of
tonnage was far less in proportion. This doubtless r p
resents the increased movement of coal. The average
per employee has, of course, been steadily increasing f-jr
several years."

REVIVAL OF POETRY.
The library of Springfield. Muss., reports a growing
popular interest in poetry. Everybody is reading it. par
tieularly men. As an experiment, in response to the ap
parent demand, the library made a collection of recent
verse and placed it in au available position. Through
November and December the collection was constantly
used. When it was returned to the shelves, Lhe request.;
to have it put back where everyone could get at it were
so numerous that the collection has been returned to the
delivery room.
Probably other cities woul dshow the same tendency.
That the interest in poetry is general is shown by the
Hew erse tonus struggling to the light in our m.iKazni'
and papers, and by the many would be erslliers who ari1

its face in the deliberations of the

an i tor tae nonce attention is draw n
directly to lhe fact that Mr. Francis

of Cochise, a colleague of Mr. Francis,
is the introducer of the new- bill. The
words and music are composed by
Bertha Bauer Stnnker. of Pi.'jenix, a
former resilient of Bisbee. The words
of the anthem are:
They sing about Kentucky,

They sing songs about Virginia,
And the battles fought by Lee:

In all the world to me -Is.

"There's a Reason" .
STOCKHOLM, Jan. 20. (Corres
pondence of the Associated Tress)
Food conditions in Germany have
changed greatly for the worse in the
last five months. The correspondent
of the Associated Press who has been
a".ay from Germany since the first
week in August has just returned
from a stay of three weeks in Berlin.
He found that many staples of food
bad altogether disappeared from the
markets
others had grown so dear
tnat tney were bevond the reach of
fc t, ,,.0, tne daily al-
lowance of potatoes had been reduced
to ten ounces, and that either a short
age of flour or a disordered distribu
tion of it among the bakers had re
sulted in long queues of buyers stand-
' ing for hours in front of the bakeries.
Potatoes Scarce
Maximum prices of foodstuffs con
trolled by the government are still
very low for potatoes and bread, and
comparatively low for tueats. rota
toes cost only 72 cents, the standard
bushel of CO pounds, and bread a little
less than 3M: cents a pound. But the
potato allowance is insufficient-tor
j persons who have little but bread and
I potatoes to eat, and has to be eked
out with turnips.
One Egg a Month
It had been hoped to allow one e?z
a person each two weeks in Greater
Berlin, but the last one-egg allowance
.was made some five weeks ago and
I another is not promised until Febru
ary. When the correspondent left
' Beilin in August, it was still possible
to buy cheese. Since the end of Aug
ust there has been no cheese on the
market. It is said that considerable
quantities are being imported from
Holland but it'apparently goes to the
front except small quantities to the
restaurants and hotels.
Another serious reduction of avail
able foodstuffs has been the expropri
ation for control of all canned eata
bles. Four or five weeks ago the deal
ers were permitted 10 sell a fraction
al part of their stock, but only two
cans on each bread card. Permission
to sell a further part is expected to
be granted again soon but the dealers
are to be compelled to open each can
tefore selling it, so as to fprce the
buyers to consume it at once and not
hoard it.
Meat Prohibitive
Th .tIv n-nwllT,rP nf mpa, nf all
kinds in the Greater Berlin municipal
ities runs from 5V to cit. T!-o
cheapest varieties cost about CO cell's
a pound, the dearest 72 cents.
Grease Denied
One of the most serious depriva
tions continues to be the lack of fats
and oils. The weekly allowance of
tutter and margarine together is a
Utile less than three ounces a person.
Oil is so expensive that it is out of

POSTUM
The correspondent, experiencing this
himself in the tirst days of his visit,
lemarked on it.
"I feel hungry all the time," said
the person addressed.
Extending his investigations, the
correspondent heard similar expres
sions from all sides. The most bitter
complaints came from soldiers at
home. When the writer last visited
the front in July, the men's rations
were ample in every respect, and
there is no reason to believe the same
is not true today. The soldier -at
home thus notices the difference more
keenly than do those who have had
gradually to accustom themselves to
one deprivation after another. There
is a deadly monotony about meals in
the households.
Breakfast, a Fast
Ereakfast generally consists of rolls
marmalade (often made of pumpkins)
and a decoction of roast acorns, rye,
chicory and what not that goes by the
name of coffee. There is no real col
fee left. Some tea at high prices still
is to be had but the1 poorer people
drink a brew of raspberry leaves or
leaves of other shrubs, or trees. For
the "second breakfast" there is dry
tread.
Dinner of Spuds
Earner generally consists of boiled
potatoes with salt, some kind of boil
ed vegetable, and, on perhaps two
days of the week, a tiny piece of meat.
Fish takes the place of meat on other
days, unless one can buy a goose at
$1.55 a pound (they cost $2 a pound
just before Christmas) a duck at $1.44
a pound, a turkey at $1.32 a pound,
or a hen at $1.08 to $1.20 a pound.
Comparatively little game comes on
the market, apparently going to the
hotels and restaurants.
Supper on Beer?
Supper is the problem in the aver
age household. Generally there are
no potatoes left over from noon, and
if there are, there is no fat in which
to fry them. The usual German sup
per before the war consisted of cold
iieats, sausage, cheese, bread and but
ter and beer. There is no meat, no
theese and no sausage,. no butter on
four or live days of the week, no more
bottled beer, and many saloou keepers
refuse to sell beer to be consumed off
the premises. The beer, moreover, is
all but undinkable.
There remain then only bread and
fish, fresh smoked, dried, or canned.
And fcrre th" prohlom of cost is add
ed to that ot monotony. 'Ilie writer
paid in Berlin $1.20 a pound for ordi
nary lake trout and S4 cents a pound
for small fresh water bass. Drid
salted fish costs 30c. a pound and
smoked eel $1.92 to $2.40. Smoked
goose breast costs $3 to $3.50 a pound
and toiled phi imps are 72 cents.
Sardines Monthly
Once in every four or five weeks the
cify authorities place on the market
small tins of sardines, one of which
may be bought on presentation of the
municipal "lebensmittelkarte," or pro
vision card. Each family, no matter
pi how many members, has only one
of these cards. The sardines thus sold
may ne"had for about 4S cents for the
small tin. In the open duarktrt t'noy
cost from G7 cents for sardines in to
mato sauce to 72 cents for sardines

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Feb. 21 Declines
outnumbered advances in today's pro
fessional market.
Shippings were again materially af
fected by i lie further delay, respect
ing their stalus. United Slates Steel
at no time equalled its best quotation
of the previous day and closed at
10?', a net loss of l'j points. Relat
ed industrials; declined more than 2
points and Gulf States Steel fell six
points. Coppers were moderately low
er. Rails were a sustaining influence to
the extent that Reading at one time
re gistered a pain of 3 points, with
1 to 2 for other coalers and more min
or shares, hut ' standard issues like
the tt.-iiiscoiitinc litals and grangers
were dull and inclined to ease off.
More activity was manifested in
the Ion-inn exchange markets, remit
tances to Herlin reacting from yester
day's advance, with a new low record
for lires at 733V&. -Bonds were irreg
ular. Totsl sales par value. $3,418,500
V. C. Coupon 3's advanced M percent
registered and coupon 4's and Pana
ma rep istered 3's half percent.
CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. Feb. 21. Virtual sus
pension of business at all grain ele
vators here today resulted from dif
ficulty of obtaining railway cars and
was accompanied by bearish effects
on prices. The wheat market closed
unsettled. s. to 1 net lower, with
May at 1.7Ssi to 1 "S and July at
1.51 to 1.51. Corn finished Vi at
to down, oats off U at to'and
provisions varying from 2!& decline
to a rise of 15 cents.
Depression was manifest from the
outset. Values dropped about 2V.c
before the market received any sub
stantial support.
Corn, like wheat, was bearishly in
fluenced by the railroad congestion.
Mild weather acted also as a handi
cap on the bulls. Oats sympathized
with the weakness of other cereals.
Sham nrlvnnr-es in tha l.nr nifirL-f.t
carried provisions to new hiRh levels,
Profit taking on the part of longs,
however, wiped out all the gains ex

NEW YORK. Feb. 21 Now, ac
cording to reports the President will
ask congress for power to employ ne
cessary' agencies in order to grapple
with the situation the atmosphere
should clear. The underlying firm
ness which the stock market shows
would seem to strongly denote that
nervousness and uncertainty have
teen supplanted by confidence. The
contraction iu short interest has been
meagre and any developments sus
ceptible of a fAvorable construction,
will, we think, cause shorts to retire
hastily.

MAKING IT PLAIN
The Pure Food and Drug Laws aim
to protect the public by preventing
mis-statements on the labels of prepa
rations but some people continue to
accept "extracts" of cod livers think
ing they will get the benefits of an
emulsion of cod liver oil.
The difference is very great. An
"emulsion" contains real cod liver oil,
hich has had the hearty endorse
ment of the medical profession for
many years, while an "extract" is a
product which contains no oil and is
highly alcoholic.)
Scott's Emulsion guarantees the high
est grade of real Norwegian cod liver oil,
skilfully blended with glycerine and
hypophopphites. Scott's is free from the
fcilse stimulation of alcohol and is en
dorsed by pood physicians everywhere.

back. It has always gone forward.

Washington's Birthday
February 22
I
It is a good thing for this Nation, and for all of us who are citizens
of it, and for any who are not citizens, living in it, to be reminded at
least once a year, of the great men who laid the foundations upon
which a great National structure has arisen.
The story of the cherry tree is a joke nowadays: it may be true or
not. But the fearless honesty with himself which that story discloses
was characteristic of Washington's whole life, and no one can tell
how much we owe today to the fact that he was not afraid to tell the
truth, and to live the truth. -
It's a good lesson for today in business or in any of the activities of
life; to be truthful in advertising, in merchandise, and in all our deal
ings with others. That's our aim in this business.
In accordance with our established custom. thU
store will be closed all day to commemorate the
isrth anniversary of the birth of George Washington.
