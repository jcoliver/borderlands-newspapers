NEW YORK, March 24 Postmaster
General Burleson's action in dismiss
ing Clarence H. Maekay as president
of the Postal Telegraph-Cable com
pany, wa3 characterized by Mr. Mac-
kay as "despotic and brutal," in a

Mr Mackay added that -William
Hohenzollern " himself could not have
been more arbitrary, despotic and vin
dJttive," and served notice on Mr.
Burleson that he would "fight to my
last dollar and to the last ditch."
He ridicuWi .r. Burleson's state
ment that the dismissal was "the re
sult of his failure to obey onstruc
tions of the postoffice department," as
serting that the Postal's only two
failures to comply with instructions
were in cases where "ambiguity" of
the instructions caused delay, and
where the company "wouid have faced
prosecutions with possible heavy
lines" had it obeyed.
"This act of Mr. Burleson," he said,
'Is only the continuation of a deliber
ate conspiracy to wreck and ruin the
' Postal Telegraph system and then es
tablish a monopoly of wire commu
uieatoin in the United States."
Mr. Burleson's principal acts, since
taking over the lines, Mr. Mackav as
serted, had "been increasing of long

the proposition to increase telegraph
rates in the interest of the Western
Union Telegraph company; the seizure

ROAD BILL ID 7

(Ev Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, March 24. Tnere will be
no serious setback to the good roads
movement on account of the vetoing of
the 'senate highway commission bill,
said Governor Campbell today when
he killed that measure along with six
others. The governor said that he
vetoed he highway measure because
"it made the same bold and unjusti
fied attempt to take from the chief
executive the direction and control of
the state highway department without
a shadow of justice," as the bill he
killed March 6.
The biii to provide for the establish
ment of a state orphanage was vetoed
for two reasons, said the governor,
one, the indefinitcness of the act, and
the second, the executive's opinion
that the proposal was a step backward
Instead of forward.
Governor Campbell could see no rea
son whatever for the passing of the
bill to regulate the moving picture in
dustry. That business, along with all
others, could be handled under the reg
ular state laws, he said, and while he
i tavorei some tax on the film business,

feeling against regulations,

Tne detlal bm. during its passage

Sensational Charges Made at
Court Martial Trial of Of

(Ey Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, March 24. Prof, i
Rodger Adams of Urbana, Ills., testify
ing today for the government at the
court martial trial on Governor's is
land of Capt. Edwin C. Weisgerber of
Pittsburg, charged with acts detrimen
tal to the United States and Great
Britain and favorable to Germany,
said thlt analysis of a chemical mix
ture submitted by the defendant to
the British war mission as a sabntirute
for gasoline and purporting by him to
consist of 95 per cent water and 5
per cent chemicals, was in reality "a
saturated solution of picric acid and
gasoline."
The government contends that use
of the mixture with its alleged picric
acid contents would ultimately destroy
any internal combustion engine or mo
tor," and seriously impair operation of
submarines, motor trucks and other
military and naval equipment.
Adams' Testimony
Professor Adams, who is on the fac
ulty of the University of Illinois, and
was recently discharged as a major
in the chemical war service, testiiied
that his analysis showed the mixture
to contain six-tenths of 1 per cent
picric acid and ordinary commercial
gasoline. His tests, he said, showed
no evidence of water or any other in
gredients in the mixture, although he
admitted that there may have been
"slight traces" cf other chemicals
which would not appear in the an
alysis.
The mixture in question was sub-;
mitted to the British war mission in
Washington, July 15, 191S, and turned
over to the American chemical war
fare service for analysis.
This was done, Arthur H. Wykehani
George of Baltimore, assistant direc
tor of war supplies for the British mis
sion testified, "because we had no
secrets and were working together."
Says Fuel impossible
Continuing his testimony, Professor
Adams declared that it would be im
possible to form a syuthetic fuel hav
ing the properties of gasoline with S5
per cent water and chemicals. Under
cross-examination the witness denied
that he had pre-judged the possibilities
of the chemical mixture, but admitted
that he had never made a study of al
leged gasoline substitutes.
Wykeham-George, under cross-examination,
declared teat he understood
the mixture was submitted as a sub
stitute for gasoline, but that there was
no request or offer of remuneration so
far ts he knew. A memorandum sub
mitted to J. K. Burnett of Pittsburg,
who was associated with the defendant
in the manufacture cf the mixture,
claimed that the substitute could be
made at a cost o seven cents a gaso-
line and anywhere where either fresh
or salt water was available.

Attempt to Cross Atlantic
Start Expected to Be Made;
About May 1 ; Trial Flights;

(By Review Leased Wire) j
NEW YORK, March 24. Three of i
the four seaplanes with which thej
navy department plans to attempt its j
trans-Atlantic flight are at the naval j
air station at Rockaway Beach, from j
which the flight will start. They are
known as the NC-1 type of machine.
The fourth plane is under construc
tion at Garden City.
It is expected that trial fights will
be made within a week or ten days
and the actual trans-Atlantic flight
started soon after May 1.
Lieutenant John H. Towers is in
command of preparations being made
at Rockaway Beach. Each of the three
seaplanes there is equipped with three
Liberty motors, having 1.000 to 1.200
combined horsepower. Experiments
are being made in the arrangement
of the motors, but it is believed that
the final choice will provide for two
tractor or "pulling" propellers, and
one "pushing" propeller. There will
be four Liberty motors in the fourth
plane, under construction, and these
will be arranged in the so-called
"tandem type;" that is ,two tractor
and two "pusher" motors.
100-Mile Hour Spsed.
The speed of the first three sea
planes has been estimated by the
bui'ders at 100 miles an hour, and it
is said that at least one of the planes
has made above that speed in trial
flights.
The original gasoline capacity was
for a sustained flight of 16 hours, but
i changes in the design of the hull in
terior have allowed for increased stor
age space substantially increasing the
gasoljne capacity.
Other changes in the original de
sign contemplate lowering the pilot's
station nearer the pontoon so as to
render less dangerous the changing
of pilots in flight. The machines have
a wing spread of approximately 126
feet 5 inches, and the wings are 12
feet wide
It is believed that each plane will
carry a minimum crew of six men, two
of whom will be pilots and the others
mechanics and observers.
WASHINGTON. March 24. Naval
seaplanes which are to attempt a
flight across the Atlantic ocean in
May will start from Rockaway Beach,
Long Island, but the actual "jumping
off" place will be much farther up the
coast, possibly at some point in New
Foundland. Whether the machines
will steer a direct course for Ireland
or follow the longer route via the
Azores, apparently has not been de
termined. Acting Secretary Roosevelt an
nounced today that the destroyer TJar
ney had been ordered to proceed to
New Foundland to investigate the
harbor facilities along the coast for
the purpose of determining the best j
base from which the planes could
put out overseas, and harbors in
which landings could be made if it
became necessary to descend in the
voyage from Rockaway to the flight
base.
Unless difficulties with Jce floes
are encountered, the Harney is ex
pected to return to the United States
within about ten days, wben the offi
cers will submit their report.

REBELS OVERTHROW
RULERS AND SEIZE
CONTROL 111 HUNGARY!
Revolution Precipitated by
Plans Made by Peace
v Conference
(Continued from Pax One)
in bringing about final adoption of the
league of nations plan.
State department officials who are
familiar with conditions heretofore ex
isting in Hungary were surprised by
the rapidity with which boIsheTism
swept into control in Budapest and
were inclined to doubt that it had suc
ceeded reaching out of the cities to
the peasant agricultural class. The
peasants were said to hare been well
satisfied by their treatment under the
land-owning class and consequently
would not be a fertile field for the
propagation of bolsheviki theories.
One official suggested that the inclu
sion of peasants in the new govern
ment, called ' the "revolutionary gov
ernment of workers, peasants and sol
diers' councils" instead of, as in Rus
sia, the government of "workers and
soldiers councils" might be an attempt
to persuade the peasants to join the
movement.
Revolution Accomplished
Today's advices came from Bel
grade. Berne and Copenhagen and re
lated to different features of the move
ment. Each, however. referred to the
revolution as an accomplished fact.
The Belgrade advices ; declared the
new Magyar government lad an
nounced that hostilities were to begin
last Friday night, but they did not
state against whom the hostilities
w ere directed or whether they had ac
tually begun. The Berne dispatches
threw some light on the personnel of
the new government.
The appointment of Bela Kun as
minister of foreign affairs was par
ticularly disturbing to officials as he
was for some time an aide-de-camp ot
Leon Trotzky in Russia. The new
minister of war was described as hav
ing been an orderly in the second
army who was once .punished for in
discretion in military affairs.
The state department advices were
summarized in this statement:
Government Overturned
' The state department has received
a dispatch from Belgrade that the
Hungarian government was overturn
ed by the communist revolutionary
element under bolsheyist leadership in
Budapest onFriday. While telegraph
and other communications were cut
oft, and there was some shooting and
other disorders, all the foreigners in
Budapest are believed to be safe.
"Through Serbian sources, informa
tion has come to the department thlat
the Hungarian premier has resigned
and that the new Magyar government
announced hostilities- would begin at 6
o'clock last Friday, Budapest time.
The resignation of the Hungarian gov
ernment came after the French auth
orities in Hungary had directed the
Hungarian government to witdraw its
army forces to Szegedin-Debreczen
boundary, the Rumanians to hold the
Aradsrat-Marncment and the French
ta occupy the territory in dispute.
"A dispatch from Berne referring to
press reports of the situation says
turned the presidency of the revolu
tionary government of workers, peas
ants and soldiers' councils, according
to the press, is a workman who, at
first a conservative socialist, has
moved to the Left. ,
Kun Was Trotzky Aide
Joseph Pogoni (Pagany?) minister
of war, lormerly was president of the
Soldatenrat and was an orderly in the
second army and once punished for in
discretion in an army matter. Bohm,
who has become commissioner for so
cial affairs, was once minister of war,
and has lately gone to the Left. Bela
Kun, minister of foreign affairs, used
to be aidelde-camp for Trotzky in
Russia, serving as such four years and
described as a very radical bolshevist.
"Tht state department has received
a dispatch from Copenhagen stating
that Count Karolyi, heading the Hungarian-
provisional government at
Budapest, in a memorandum received
at Copenhagen, claimed that Ruman
ians, Czechs and Serbs started rumors
entente countries that bolshevism j
in
is developing in Hungary and claimed
that by these rumors the Rumanians,
Cxeths and Serbs hoped they might
be allowed to occupy .disputed dis
tricts of Hungary on the pretext of
restoring order and defending their
nationals."
LONDON, March 24 (British Wire
less Service) Commenting on the ac
tion of Hungary, the Times says:
"It is not yet possible to judge the
origin, and extent of this last disturb
ance In view of certain menaces
which Gorman statesmen and the Ger
man press have freely employed and
f the close relations between some
Hungarian and German intriguers, it
is susceptible of more explanations

AUTOMATIC AIRPLANE
TRAVELS 100 MILES
ALONE WITH BIG LOAD
Device Needs No Pilot, But
Goes to Object and Re
tfirns to Starter
FORT WORTH. March 24. Under
automatic control, an airplane capable
of carrying a heavy load and operated
without a human guide has made a
trip of 100 miles and landed within
a. short distance of the point it set
out to reach, Newton D. Baker, sec
retary of war, disclosed in an address
here tqay. Secretary Baker, with
General Peyton C. March, chief of
staff, came here to inspect the mili
tary establishment at Camp Bowie.
The device which made such a
flight possible, and which has 'been
kept secret, Mr. Baker said, is an au
tomatic guide for airplanes and was
invented in America. It is designed
as an instrument of war and the sec
retary referred to it in describing to
his audience the possible horrors of
future wars, if there is to be no
League of Nations.
When the armistice was signed the
invention had been so nearly perfect
ed that in actual test an airship with
out an occupant was successfully sent
on a trip of over 100 miles, he said.
An airplane went- out under control
of a pilot without making a landing,
returning to its point of origin after
locating the distant object for the
test. Then was sent out under auto
matic control another airplane to land
at the designated point and it effected
the landing so close to that point
that iiad it been a shell it would have
been considered a good shot.
Secretary Baker did not explain
the exact nature of the invention, but
he made it clear that the war depart
ment considers it one of the most
wonderful .pieces of mechanism, for
war's destructive purposes."
Such a device, the secretary said,
will never be necessary to use in war
if the League of Nations is formed,
"for the league will save the world
from a reptition of the horrible ca
tastrophe through which it ha just
passed."
ROBINS BLAMED FOR
RUSSIAN SENTIMENT
(By Review Leased "Wire)
NEW YORK, March 24. Responsi
bility for anti-American sentiment in
Russia was laid at the door of Col.
Raymond Robins, former head of the
American Red Cross mission to "Rus
sia," CoL -William Thompson, and other
Americans whom he characterized as
"bolsheviki apologists" by Hermann
M. Donner, former representative of
the Finnish senate in the United
Statesspeaking here today before the
National Civic federation.
Mr. Donner declared he had 'abso
lute knowledge." that Colonel Robins
while in Russia, made a trip to Mur
mansk, without the knowledge of Am
bassador Francis and the military and
naval attaches and created the im
pression there that the American gov
ernment was supporting the bolshe
viki against the Kerensky government.
It took the American ambassador sev
eral months to counteract the effect
of this announcement, he declared.
II. S. PLANES READY
; FOR TRANS-SEA TRIP
(Continued from Page One)
aircraft will be re-fueled and given
a final tuning up before they actually
depart overseas.
Several machines are being pre
pared for the flight and two or more
very probably will make the start.
Three planes of the NC-1 type have
been completed and a fourth is near
ing completion at the Curtiss plant at
Garden City, N. Y. Extensive tests of
the NC-1 have been made and 51 pas
sengers were carried in one of her
flights.
Whether it will be possible for the
machines to carry sufficient fuel to
drive them across the ocean has not
been made known. They could re
fuel at the Azores without difficulty,
and some of officers believe it would
be entirely possible .under favorable
weather conditions, for them to re
plenish their gas supply in mid-ocean
from a ship wiht which a rendezvous
could be arranged beforehand.
Plans Kept Secret
Detailed, plans of the iight are be
ing carefully safeguarded and there
has been no intimation as to whether
the machines will keep together or fol
low different routes. In view of the
announcement that destroyers will be
stationed along the route to safeguard
the crews in the event of accidents,
most officers believe, however, the
flying craft will follow one course.
' The navy department has not entered-for
the $50,000 prize of the
Loidon Daily Mail for the first air
craft that completes the trans-Atlantic
'flight. -At the department today it
was said that no inquiries had even
been made as to the conditions under
which the offer was made. Several

ADVOCATES DENY IT
DELAYS PEACE TREATY
Polish Question Now Is Near
Settlement; Lloyd George
Is Overruled
PARIS, March 24. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) The results of 'the
deliberations of the supreme council
today are not likely to be stated in
the official communiques, and prob
ably will take form in their effect
on the conference work, particularly
with respect to reparations, frontiers
and the League of Nations.
The advocates of the League of
Nations maintain that it is in no way
retarding the progress of the peace
treaty, as the league meetings are
held at night and are nearing a con
clusion whereas the obstacles to the
treaty are questions of principle, on
which the premier thus far have
been unable to secure an agreement.
The war council agai ntoday dealt
with Poland, "which question is close
to settlement. It is understood that
the recommendations of the Cambon
council for a Polish coridor across
East Prussia : to the Baltic will pre-
jcail, despite the objections raised by
iTemier LJOyd George. The Polish
j divisions at present in France will
probably proceed to the Baltic and
land at Koenigsberg, instead of Dan
zig, in order to avoid a clash with the
Germans over Danzig.
The League of Nations commission
resumed its session at S:50 o'clock
today, President Wilson presiding.
The commission is expected to sit un
til midnight- It was not believed that
the large number of amendments
would be completed and revision of
the covenant concluded without an
other meeting. " (
The amndment has been divided
into three classes: .First .those by
neutrals; second, those by an Ameri
can senator; third, those framed by
President Wilson, Colonel House and
Lord Robert " Cecil. The last named
group includes all points which the
iramers or the instrument believe will
clarify its ' meaning and satisfy ob
jections in all quarters.
The text of the speeches of Senators
Lodge and Knox and the main point-
of the recent debate between Senator
Lodge and Dr. Lowell are being gone
over in shaping these changes.
According to reports President Wil
son's view is that the two main obsta
cles to an early conclusion of peace
are reparation for war damages and
the "Franco-German Rhine frontier.
The belief was expressed by those
conversant 'with the president's view
that this situation will be clearly and
definitely presented to tne premiers,
and, if need hi, a suggestion will be
made that they remain closely togeth
er until these two difficulties are ov
ercome. The expectation also was ad
vanced that any doubts still remain
ing on whether the league of nations
would or wouiu not go into the peace
treaty would be settled in some def
inite understanding among the pre
miers who are the controlling influ
ence of the conference.
POLAND MUST HAVE
PORT, SAYS SMULSKI
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 24. The
fate of Poland as a stable and inde
pendent nation depends on the in
clusion of Danzig and its hinterland
within the new Polish state .said John
F. Smulski, Polish commissioner for
the United States, in a statement to
night, referring to dispatches from
Paris saying that the peace confer
ence might abandon the plan for a
"corridor' 'from Poland to the sea
coast. "Without territorial possession of
Danzig," said Commissioner Smulski,
'"the new Polish state will become a
mere advanced trading post for Ger
many. It wjli be obliged to do its
business through German merchants,
through German ports and through
German banks and to make the best
trades possible for its economic exist
ence, which wirr mean the acceptance
of terms subordinated to German com
mercial aggrandizement."

your feet four inches apart and
with your body erect alternately
raise your hands to your shoul

the side and then flex your arms.
Next extend bcth arms outwards
to the level of the shoulders ard
bring the har.ds back to the shoul

your arms symmetry.
Ycur hands are the "most im

how to carry your hands grace

whole contour of the arms. And
don't sit with your fingers tightly
intercdasped. This has the same
effect. And finally, gently mas
sage your arms every night with
a good old cleam. '

GERMAN CHURCHMEN
IGNORE FRENCH PLEA
PARIS, March 24 (French Wireless
Service) Monsignor Alexis Charost,
bishop of Lille, in a speech in Paris
Sunday, said that letters he had writ
ten to the archbishop of Cologne pro
testing against German acts at Lille
were opened by the German military
authorities and the German prelate
was scolded for corresponding with a
French bishop, "who wrote such wick
ed letters."
The bishop described the cynical
behak r of the Germans against de
fenseless population of Lille and also
the deportation of 7,000 residents of
thai city. The bis-hop said he had pro
tested to German churchmen, but their
attitude had been net to hear the

Arrangements to Be Complet

Firm's Land
For the purpose of looking into the
interests of local holders of Oklahoma
oil lands, Judge John liogan, one of
the officers of a local company, will
leave tonight for Tulsa, Okla. He
will remain away sufficiently long to
perfect arrangements for drilling on
the company's properties.
Hogan in the past two days has
been advised by oil men in Tulsa of
the bringing in next to the land of
the Arizona-Oklahoma, a Bisbee com
pany, of a 100-barrel well. In his
opinion this information proves up
the land held by the local organiza
tion. The. well drilled next to the Arizona
Oklahoma, declares Hogan, was put
down under agreement with the Arizona-Oklahoma
and with the local
company's rig and outfit ,the drillers
financing the hole. Stockholders of
the company in the district last night
were confident they will have a pro

Chicago Construction Awaits
Reduction in Cost of All
Kinds of Supplies
(Py Kevltw leased 'WIr)
CHICAGO, March 24. Fifty mil
lion dollars worth of new buildings
planned fur tnis year , in Chicago is
being held up because of high price
of building materials. This informa
tion was given members of the state
commission investigating the high
price of building materials by four
cf the leading architects in Chicago
today.
Chairman John Dailey of Peoria.
Ills., made this announcement to the
building supply dealets attending the
investigation and urged them to co
operate in the move to lower prices
and bring about a resumption of build
ing. He argued that by increasing
the volume of business the manufac
turers and dealers should be able to
reduce their prices.
C. F. AVieh. secretary of the Edward
Ilines Lumber company, testified that
the price of lumber had increased 43
to 60 per cent in five years due to
the inccrased cost of production and
operation. He submit ted figures show
ing the increase cost of labor, freight
ard overhead charges. He said labor
cost about 63 t?r cent more than five
years ago and that it cost the compan-,
ies 30 per cent of the price charged
consumers to sell and handle the com
modity. In reply to questions Mr. Wieh said
he did not believe prices could be re
duced unless the -cost cf labor was
lower. Wages, he said, could not be
reduced until the cost of living was
cut.

Local Americanization Work
One institution in Bisbee is better fitted than all others to carry on
Americanization work. The schools can accomplish a limited good
in this field; but their horizon is limited to the youth, and too often the
youth they might reach is not in school. The church does find ground
for Americanization activities, but is able to come in contact with rela
tively a small number who need attention.
The Y. M. C. A. Alone can reach the vast majority and Is seeking
daily to broaden its field of endeavor In this work.
One of the more popular and constructive weekly magazines of the
United States publishes each week a page of "Education fn American
ism." Each of the articles relates to different foreign elements in the
nation. And in each article is a paragraph dealing with "American duty
to the . . . immigrant."
Observers claim that the (foreign) workman is held at a distance
from American currents of thought and progress as tne result of a
t lack of understanding." says the latest of these articles. "They speak
regretfully of the fact that he goes from the mine or the ractory to his
heme and back again as a mere human machine. ... To meet the
situation it has been suggested that in all industrial centers . . . edu
cational organizations should take them in hand and encourage them
in the study of our language and nationalism."
The Warren district, as an industrial center, employing many foreign
born workers, has long since begun following out this program. Classes
for the foreigner in elementary English are first offered him. Later
he is given lessons in American government, and finally. He is prepared
through scientific courses for naturalization and assimilation into Amer
ican society.
And the Y. SI. C. A. is carrying on this work is reaching out to
the foreigner with the helping hand instead of "holding him at a distance
from American currents of thought and progress."
From Jhe mass they are moulding representative Americans, citi
zens who in the future will assist in maintaining the balance of the land.
The work deserves the support of the community, freely and wholeheartedly.
" ' Apropos April 1
Many perfectly good summer vacation plans have gone into the waste
basket in the past several days. Trips to the old home in the east, little
journeys to the coast resort3 or the mountains of Northern Arizona have
been abandoned.
Announcement that the three-cent railroad fare will not apply in this
state occasioned this sudden determination to remain at home.
The plans had been hastily made on the announcement early last
week that the reduced rate would be offered Arizonans on April 1.. Rail
road fare to cities in California came within reach of many persons under
the three-cent tariffs. Consequently many, especially in the warmer
cities, began making plans.
Then later in the week came the announcement 'that Arizona will
not be granted the reduced rate and the plans were consigned to the
waste basket.
Therefor California resorts suffer; Arizona individuals are disap
pointed, and we are prompt to the remark that its a helluva railroad
administration. which will perpetrate such April Fool jokes.
-Bold, Bad Phoenix
Recently Secretary of State Mit Sims and Deputy Land Commissioner
Ben Clark were held up on the streets of Phoenix by a highwayman and
relieved of $2.
We do not know which gentleman had the $2, or if It was anywhere
like evenly divided between them. But we are surprised that they should
have any ccin after living in Phoenix as long as they have.
Perhaps the highwayman made a mistake when he halted them.
No doubt he, believed they were strangers in the city. Had they re
minded him that they were working their side of the street he would
doubtless have apologized. But after finding the 52, it was too late
fcr them. The highwayman would not have believed them if they had
remonstrated.
Sims and Clark have npthing to kick about, however. Citizens from
outride Phoenix have to visit the capital occasionally. Upon such occas
ions they are forced to undergo a systematic and regular hold-up from
the time they get off the train at the depot until they depart.
Of course Sims and Clark were the real butts of? the joke. Some
people in Phoenix may have appreciated it but most of them were
visitors.
The Victory Loan
"This lean should be considered in terms of human lives, not per
centages or any other considerations, for it will constitute the real test of
Americanism."
Thus has Frank M. Smith, federal district director of the next Lib
erty loan defined the great and final drive of the government for funds
with which to carry out the United States' war program. The director
declares that some are in doubt as to the reasons for the Victory loan,
that there are those who would believe there is no need for the loan.
"The government spent all the Fourth loan before the last install
mnt was due from the people," continues the statement. "It has been
borrowing billions of dollars from the banks during the last few months
to -pay our war debts. The time has arrived when that money must
be paid back to the banks.
"The money which we are now asking is to pay for those vast
stores of equipment and ammunition which scared the Germans stiff
and made them realize they were beaten. We are asked to pay for the
preparations that saved thousands of American lives; for if the govern
ment hid not run up this bill, our boys would be fighting and dying in
the trenches tcday."
This, then, is the reason for the Victory loan.
Bisbee Will Pave
The main thoroughfares of Bisbee will be paved.
.This decision was reached yesterday when the electors of Bisbee
voted by an overwhelming majority in favor of bonding the city for
the improvements.
About the election there were several significant facts.
Bisbee put over its improvement election on the heels of failure of a
similar civic lection in Douglas.
The largest registration ever written prepared to vote on the bonds.
The largest per cent of registration ever voted, in the city on a bond
election went to the polls; S4 i-er cent of the registration voiced opinion
for or against the improvement. The bonds carried by six to one.
Progressive Bisbee has determined to have the best paved city in
the state of Arizona.
The future will bear reward for this determination.
Too many of us cling to the theory that a citizen's whole duty is to
cuss congress for what it does or doesn't do.
Its too bad that we cant outlaw bull along with booze.
And almost everybody is anxious that everything should come down
except the particular thing that he manufactures or raises.

LONDON CONFERENCE
ON RAIL WAGE ENDS
(Rv Review reased Wire)
LONDON, March 24. At the conclu

tween the railway meif and th"e gov-1
ernment at the board of trade today,
J. H. Thomas, general secretary of the
stability , of the Czecho slovak repub
lie," said the statement, '"and I there
fore appeal to the American people
not only to De patient, but also to ac
cept very crtically all reports of un
stable conditions within the boun
daries of the new nation."
LONDON .Feb. 2S (Correspondence !
of the Associated Press.) The wool
trade of Great Britain, which has been
controlled hy the government since
the middle of 1916, is gradually be
ing freed from restrictions and soon
! will be practically on a pre-war basis.
The only remaining restriction will be
that the government, which has
bought the forthcoming Australasian
clip, will act as merchants and put
this on the market at auctions atVixed
minimum prices, which, however, will
be somewhat elastic as the sales pro
ceed.
The first auctions will be held -in
the first wee kof April and about 60,
000 bales are expected to be cata
logued during that month. Belgian,
French and Italian buyers will be al
lowed to ocmpete with the British
trade for supplies, but there will be
no American competition.
The chairman of the wool council,
in making the latter announcement,
the other day, said that '"the contract
ror 325,000 bales, free on board. Aus
tralia and New Zealand, entered into
just before the armistice, appeared to
cover fully the requirenitnts of the
United States for some tine to come.
and no provision had therefore been
made in the British import program
for any sales of wool t3 America
through London. If any alteration iu
thees arrangements were desired it
would be necessary to consider such
proposals very carefully, with a view
to provide for reasonable American
requirements, but of course, to do this
would need some months "notice.
Regarding prices he said it was im

JAPANESE COTTON
GOODS IN ENGLAND
OJy Heview Leased Wire)
MANCHESTER. England. March 2i.
The arrival cf Japanese cotton
goods iu the markets here and expec
tation of further offerings from the
same quarter, is causing a good deal
of apprehension in the cotton nianuftc
turing districts where many opera
tives are unemployed.
It is pointed out that if the author
ities stopped the import of necessaries
and luxuries during wartime, the im
port of competing cotton goods should
be prohibited at a time when so many
Lancashire cotton operatives are
workless. It is urged that strong ef
forts be made to put the cotton manu
facturing trade here on such a basis
as will meet this Japanese competition

FIVE
GERMAN SCHEME TO
ATTACK AMERICANS
ALONG RHINE FOILED
Three Spartacan Agitators
Admit Plot to Start Fight
Against Army
COBLEX, March 24. (By the As
sociated Press.) Three agitators, ad
mittedly Spartacan sympathizers, con
fessed to the American military au
thority today that they came into the
occupied area for the purpose of fur
thering a movement among the Ger
man workmen to organize Spartacan
forces sufficiently that m time they
would gain strength enough to attack
the American soldiers nad take pos
session of the Coblenz banks and rail
way stations and receive assistance
from unoccupied Germany. Frederick
Schwarzkopf, one of the U-aders of
the movement, was arrested Sunday
with six other agitators. The military
' police now have nineteen Germans
. under arrest on various charges con
nected with efforts to create unrest
among the civilian workmen. Schwarz
kopf recently came to Coblenz from
Berlin. Ha told workmen he wa3
one of the Spartacan .group which
stormed the palace of the former Ger
man emperor.
The original plans were for au up
rising on March 15 or the day after,
according to those under arrest, but
the plan fell through owing to lack
of interest among the workmen.'
Schwarzkopf and the other leaders
planned to attack the German police
station, gain possession of arms, seize
the railway stations and telegraph of
fices nad later .take charge of the
banks and affairs generally. Schwarz
kopf said he received t'airty marks
a day from the Spartacans for his
work as an agitator.
The Americans had full information
of the plans of the agitators early in
March and soon began arresting the
leaders in the plot and also those
who showed any sympathy with the
Spartacan movement.
Reports to army headquarters from
various parts of the occupied terri
tory are to the effect that the civilian
laborers on the roads and various jobs
under American supervision have no
intention of striking or joining the
Spartacan movement.

AMNESTY TO GERMAN
U-BOAT COMMANDERS
DEMANDED IN BERLIN
BERLIN", Feb .US. (Correspondence
of the Associated Press.) Demand
that the peace treaty contain a clause
granting amnesty to German subma
rine commanders fcr the outrages
they committed in the ruthless sub
marine warfare, is voiced by the All
gemeine Zeitung. The Berlin news
paper evidently expects that the allies
will demand the surrender of all Ger
man submarine commatdt-rs and to
present an argument to .show vihy
these men should not be punished fo:
the crimes them committed on or un
der the seas. The paper also gives
warning that any attempt to hold them
responsible for their murders of In
nocent persons might fan the flames
of international hatred.
"These captains," asserts the news
paper, "were nto responsible for the
conduct of submarine warfore or for
carrj'ing on the unrestricted under
seas campaign. They were acting
within the scope of their orders and
the entente could not possibly hope
to defend the position that these men
were responsible when they simjly
carried out i na professional way the
Instructions they had received.
"If the entente is cetermined to
place the responsibility for the warj
on certain persons and make them the
subject of criminal proceedings, an
international tribunal would -be the
only competent court, and before htis
we gladly await the verdict.
"England and other members of the
entente, however, will do very well to
carefully ponder whether this would
serve as a precedent which might be
followed after the conclusion of peace
to renew the flame of hatred. If this
i sto me a peace of understating and
reconciliation, the treaty to be con
cluded must contain the traditional
amnesty clause."
Cub Backstop Has Enviable
Record as Fielder, But
'Is Light Hitter
'
"When Alexander, the Cubs'
great slab-artist, takes the mound
to twirl a game for tne National
league champs ,the man behind
the bat is always "Bill" Killefer,
who was Alex." battery mate when
the pair were with the Phillies,
prior to their sale to Chicago. No
other backstop ever works with
Alexander, and the great twirler's
success is claimed by many to be
in no small part responsible to
the heavy work of his receiver.
At any rate, Killefer, who will
be with the Cubs when they ap
pear in Bisbee, April 12 for an
exhibition game, is rated as one of
the top-notch backstops of the
big brush, and that is recommen
dation enough. He isn't so much
as a slugger as even his best
friends will admit .only pasting
the pellet for an average or .233
last season. But when men are
on the bases oh, boy! They
dont help themselves to many
pilfered sacks, as "Bill's" arm is
too accurate in getting the peg
down to the bag for a certain put
out for any monkey shines in base
running to be pulled off while
he is behind the bat.
And when it comes to fielding
his position and even a back
stop has considerable fielding to
do in the big brush Killefer is
all to the mustard. He stood at
the top of all the regular back
stops in the National league last
season, with an average of .982,
which isn't rotten by a long shot,
fans all admit. Four hundred and
eighty-seven times the old apple
nestled in his big mitt for a put-
out, and 121 other limes he had
assists to his credit, no mean num
ber for a catcher.
He made only seven errors in
608 chances. One hundred and
four games saw him don his mask
and mitt and go behind the bat,
more games than any other catch
er in the National league appeared
in. No wonder it is the concen
sus of fans' opinion "that he'll
do for the regular backstop job
again this year. As one old
timer put it,, "If he's good enough
for Alexander, he's good enough
for any old ball club."
ST. LOUIS, March 24. Organiza
tion of a League of Women voters to
to finish the fight for woman suffrage
and to aid in reconstruction work in
America, was urged by Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt, of New York, presi
dent of the National American Wom
an Suffrage association, in an address
here tonight before the golden jubi
lee convention of that organization.
Mrs. Catt proposed this as the besfr
and most patriotic memorial to the
pioneer women of the suffrage move
ment. As outlined by Mrs. Catt, the chief
purpose of the plan of the proposed
league of woman voters are:
Objects of Plan
To use its utmost influence to ob
tain the final enforcement of the wo
men of every state in the United
States and to aid the women of all
other countries to obtain their rights.
To remove the remaining legal dis
criminations against women in the
codes and constitutions of the Ameri
can states.
To stabilize the democracy of Amer
ica and "to make our democracy so
safe that every citizen may feel se
cure and great men will acknowledge
the worthiness of the American re
public to lead."
To achieve the objects, Mrs. Catt
called the women of America "to en
list for a five years service." Five
years, she believed,- ought to see these
purposes accomplished or well under
way. At the end of that time she sug
gested there should be an accounting
of achievements to see if it would be
necessary to continue the existence of
the proposed league.
Amendments Urged
"It must be remembered," declared
Mrs. Catt, "that no league of woman
voters can be possible on the lines
suggested unless the National Ameri
can Woman Suffrage association is
willing to amend its time honored
policy in response to what seems a
new time and new conditions. To
make these amendments, involves
the most fundamental changes in our
internal policy ever proposed. It will
doubtless arouse sharp differences of
apinion and action should be taken
only after careful and sincere reflec
tion." Developing her proposal, Mrs. Catt
declared the fight for suffrage must
be carried to a finish' because thirty
three 1 United States senators had
j blocked the suffrage amendment to
I the constitution. "Two years more
j should finish the fight," she declared.
"The task will be easier, and early
vicioiy more certain if voters and
non-voters stand together by their
common cause."

ADVISES VISITORS
WASHINGTON, March 24. In ter
es' fug side lilits on present day con
ditions in Belgium are given in an of
ficial B'jluian bulletin issued here, con
taining advice to repatriates aim oth
ers going to Belgium.
"The first commodity you must ab
solutely take with you," says the bul
letin, "is Vaiience and ro small
quantity either. Life is by no means
easy and cannot be easy till later,
when the reconstruction of Belgium
hus actually begun.
"Since there is at presei.t no wool or
cotton nor parnic-i.rs of any kind, nor
shoes exotpt at firumi pries, be
careful to renew your wardrobe and
to provide yourself with enough wool
for your bedding.
"Ladies, do not forget this is a
most valuable piece of advice to car
ry thread, needles and pins. Also,
since paper has reached an extra
ordinary value in Belgium, be sure to
take boxes of writing paper, pens,
ink, and as much ordinary paper as
your trunks will hold. You will find
you have saved about 100 per cent on
your stock.
"As far s food and provisions are
concerned, do not hesitate to provide
yourselves with as much sugar as you
can get. There are some suburbs in
Brussels where no sugar has been dis
tributed for six weeks. As for butter,
it lias disappeared since the govern
mtnt brought the price down to 8.50
francs" (?1.70). The formers prefer to
sell milk rather than to save it for
butter and as a consequence not a sin
gle pound is displayed in the shop
windows. Margarine does not even
exist any more, so bring some of each.

Russia's best diplomat is its army,

All-Russian government, discuss
ing the political (situation with
the correspondent of the Asso
ciated Press. Mr. Gins is one of
the group of young men who have
thrown in their lot with the new
ministry and who are determined
that the experiment of founding
a successful government shall
prove a success.
Mr .Gins was formerly a profes
sor of international law in the
University at Petrograd. With his
wife and two children ne was one
of that numerous band of Russians
who were obliged to flee easter
ly to escape. the scourge of Bolshe
vism and terrorism.
The young diplomat thought
that the powers would see in
Russia's regenerated army, as
shown by the taking or Perm,
the symptoms of the rebirth of the
state and evidence that the state
is fully able ko protect itself.
There was no doubt in his mind
about the friendly disposition of
the allies.

ALASKA GOAL FOR
PACIFIC SHIP LINES
SEATTLE, March 24. Kulok, an
Alaska point far out on the Aleutian
island string, may some day supply
Alaska coal to trans-Pacific liners
swinging north on the "Great Circle"
route between Japan and the Puget
Sound, according to Seattle steamship
officials, who are discussing the es
tablishment of a coaling station at
Kulok. At present, they point out,
vessels must be saver, they claim, if
the ship could carry, but helf their
present coal tonnage and could re
plenish their bunkers at Kulok.
A. F. Haines, general manager of
the Pacific Steamship company, has
prepared a statement in which he aims
to show that bunker space for 720
long tons or S60 long tons would be
saved on every trip from Seattle. By
carrying cargo instead or coal in this
space the company revenues would be
increased.
Coal is not far from being half way
between Seattle and Moji, where
trans-Pacific liners usually coal, ac
cording to Mr. Haines. "rom Seattle
to Moji, via Kulok, it is 4,848 miles.
Kulok is 2,140 miles from Seattle and
2,708 from Moji.
A plan for the establishment of a
similar mid-Pacific coal station at
Duth Harbon, Alaska, was discussed
before all Alaska coal lands were
withdrawn in 1906.

TERM "DIVISION' IN
GERMAN. ARMY NOW
WITHOUT IMPORTANCE
No Set Standard to Measure
Strength of Unit Exists
Since' War
COBLEXZ, March. 1 (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press) There
is no longer any set standard for the
strength of a division in the German
army, say American experts. This is
regarded a3 important in view of the
fact that delegates at the peace con
ference not long ago suggested that
the German army be limited-to six
divisions.
At the beginning of the w&r a Ger
man division comprised about 1G.000
men. In the latter part of the v.-ar the
divisions consisted of three infantry
and one artillery regiments, with pio
neers, signalmen and various other
technical trcps numbering approxi
mately 9000 men. At presen it is
declared, no division in the German
army has 5000 men and there are
probably divisions with less than one
thousand men.
In demobilization it has obviously
been the policy to make the regiment
the prime unit but to retain ia exist
ence all divisional staffs of divisions
which existed in July 1914.
T. is probable, accoring to the ex
lciis with the American army of oc
cupation, that there still exists in the
German army one hundred or more
divisional staffs in more or less skel
. eton fori- .-. These divisions are 'de-
mobilize- but not dissolved. Appar
. ently it has been the purpose to re
tain a considerable number of staffs
in skeleton form until the. future of
the German army is definitely decid
ed by the National Assembly in Wel-
. mar.
Taking these facts into considera
tion, the American officers who have
made a careful daily study of the de-'
mobilization of the German army as
well as all other activities of the en
emy troops, say that the term division
in connection with the present Ger
man army has no standard meaning.
In connection with the future army
' of Germany, the Americans assert
that the term division requires a de
fining clause such as a "division on
pre-war establishment," or a "division
en establishment basis existing No
vember 11, 191S."

(T.t Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, March 24. "Financial

children under 15 years of age. Every
mother would receive the equivalent
of 53.12 weekly until her youngest
child reaches the age of 15 years.
In addition $1.25 a week would be
paid for the support of the first child
and $3.12 for subsequent children, un

LONDON, March 24 The, discov

were submitted to the Mineral Re

en ible it to outdistance all other na
tions in the race toward replacing a
shortage of 16.225,000 gross tons of
shipping lost as the result of unre
stricted German submarine warfare
and of the failure of normal increase
by new production.
Mr. Hurley made this assertion to
day in a report of his trip to Europe,
where for three months he was in
close touch with the shipping inter
ests of foreign nations. The report
will be used in working out a policy
cf ownership and operation of the
American merchant marine.
Mr. Hurley estimated that in July,
1914, the sea-going steam bottoms of
the world totaled 41,225,000 gross tons,
which was reduced by war to 37,000,
000 gross tons, a net loss of 4,225,
000 gross tons. In addition, he stated,
there was a loss of 12,000.000 gross
tons which would have been con
structed if war had not stopped the
normal increase in production, making
a total loss of 16.225,000 gross tons.
Net Loss 969,000 Tons.
The allies and neutrals suffered a
total loss by enemy action, marine
risk and capture of 15,218,000 gross
tons, Mr. Hurley said, and gained by
Levf construction and seizure of en
emy ships I, 1-45,000 gross tons, leav
ing a net loss of 969.000 gross tons.
The net loss to the Central Powers
was even greater since they lost
3,016,000 gross tons and gained only
740.000. a difference of 2,270,000 gross
tons.
Only two countries, the United
States and Japan, have a larger
amount of tonnage now than when
the war began. Japan showed a net
gain of 25 per cent, Mr. Hurley re
ported, while the United States jump
ed far in the lead with a net gain of
125 per cent.
"The United States forged ahead as
rapidly as Germany fell behind," said
the report.. "In August, 1914, tbe
United States seagoing merchant! ma
rine, 500 gross tons and over, includ
ed 624 steamers of r,75S,463 gross tons
and S70 sailing vessels and schooner
barges of 947.S52, gross tons, making a
grand total of 1,494 seagoing merchant
vessels of 2.706.317 gross tons.
Seized Vessels.
"On November 11, 191S, at the end
o fthe war, ihe steam-going merchant
marine had increased to 1,366 vessels
of 4.6S5.263 gross tons and the sailing
vessels and schooner barges had de
creased to 747 vessels of S29.917 gross
tons, making a grand total of 2.113
seagoing merchant vessels of 5,515
1S0 gross tons.
"This does not include the seized
enemy vessels, which at the end of
the war aggregated SS vessels of 562,
005 gross tons, of which number SI
of 546,210 gross tons were steamers
and seven of 15,795 tons were sailing
vessels.
"The total construction in the Unit
ed States added to the merchant ma
ine during the war amounted to S75
vessels of 2,91145 gross tons. The
purchase from aliens of 233 vessels

the sale of the United States govern
ment .abandonment and othex causes,
accounts for the decreases. Losses of
15 German and requisitioned ships
amounting to 112.24S gross tons are
not included.
"Today we are potentially the great
est maritime power ok the earth, for
thereason that we possess the great
est shipbuilding instrumentalities."
Mr. Hurley stated that Great Bri
tain suffered a net loss in the war
of 3,443,000 gross tons, amounting to
18 per cent her entire tonnage.
Other nations which suffered heavy
losses include Norway, which lost
1,178,335 gross tons; France, 907.16S
gross tons; Italy ,52,124 tons; Greece,
337,545 gross tons; Denmark, 239,922
gross tons, and Sweden, 201,733.
( All Ambitious.
Every effort is being made by each
of these nations, Mr. Hurley asserted,
to regain thei rformer martiime stand
ing. "The study of the shipping board
experts revealed a teeming ambition
among other powers to achieve a high
er maritime standing." said the re
port. "In almost every country the
desire exists not only to replace war
losses, but to add new totals to be
used in the work of reconstruction
and in developing new foreign trade.
"Even Switzerland has not escaped
this desire to acquire a merchant ma
rine. Ships will be acquired as soon
as canal improvements are made on
the Rhine."
The chief interest now centers on
the question of whether the United
States can henceforth maintain her
hith place as a maritime power. I
find the peoples of the world aroused
to an intense interest and concern
as to the use we are to make of this
power.
"in America, you have heard much
of British competition. In Great Bri
tain I heard a great, deal more about
American competition. The truth is
that our friends across the water are
for the first time entering upon a
period of actual competition. In our
praise of British seamanship and Brit
ish operating ability we have been
prone to gnore the advantages which
lay on the side of the ships which
flew the Union "Jack.
"I have no misgivings about the
era of competition which is coming.
The obstacles of inexperience will
quickly give way before American in
dustrial strength and energy. It is
a ne wage of ocean transportation as
well as of public policy. It is an age
in which new conditions will rule and
old advantages will become inopera-j
tive. It is an agre of promise forj
those who would participate in Amer-!
ica's high destiny upon the seas." j
Mr. Hurley said prior to August, I
1914, both the foreign trade and the
shipping of the United States were
dominated to a great extent by Brit
ish because American traders and ship
operators who wished to do business
could do so most conveniently through
British agencies. In 1915, he recalled, j
only one-seventh of the foreign trade
of the United States was carried in j
American bottoms.

were approximately 50,000,000 long 1
tons," said the report. "With aver- j
age shipping efficiency the movement j
of these goods would have required j
about 9,000,000 gross tens of ships. j
Assuming an annual increase m
the foreign trade of the United States
equal to the average increase for the!
five years preceding August, 1914, our
foreign trade in 1920 would require a
greatly increased merchant tonnage if
it all were to be carried in American
bottoms."
Mr. Hurley declared it was an ac
cepted principle that a strong mari
time power should carry in its own
ships at least 50 per cent of the ag
gregate of its exports and imports
and In addition some cf the trade
between countries not yet in the J
shipping business. j
"Assuming a total export and im-j
port business in - 1920 of 70,000,000-j
long tons," he added, "it would require j
a fleet of about 7,500,000 gross tons !
t otransport 60 per cent in our own
ships."
One of the types of ships most de
sirable for the new merchant marine,;
according to Mr. Hurley, is a speedy,:
effective combination cargo and pas
senger liner of from 15,000 to 25,000 i
deadweight tons which could be op-!
erated efficiently in the transporta
tion of high-class merchandise, pas
.sengers and mail.
"Shipping men generally agree," he
said, "that it is not the total tonnage,
but the character of the vessels that
makes a successful fleet. The country
might have 10,000,000 tons of shipping
which if not the right sort could not!
be operated profitably in competition
with ships of a better type belonging
to another nation.
'I have heard a great deal of talk
about the construction of junk' ships
in America, emphasis thus being laid
on the number of small ships we had
under construction, it was sought to
convey the impression that our new
ships would suffer by comparison with
those laid down by our. friends and
associates overseas.
"It may surprise these critics to
hear, as I have heard, that British
.yards had under construction on
October 31, 66 ships of "6,000 gross
tons and over. Our program for that
date called for 106 ships of 6,000 grose
tons or over."
Mr. Hurley said three factors mili
tated most strongly against the nat
ural and desirable expansion of the
foreign trade of the United States;
first, the necessity .for developing
men, thoroughly American in every
way, to handle foreign trade; second,
the recruiting of an American person
nel for the operation of the ships and
the handling of the work at the ports;
and, third, the extension of banking
facilities.
The idea that too high wages are
being paid American seamen for this
country to compete with other coun-'
tries successfully "was ridiculed by
Mr .Hurley.
"It Is time for the public mind to
be disabused of this conception," he
stated. "The facts will dismay those
who are afitating for a lower wage
scale of American ships. We are Day-
new place upon the seas, or whether I our seamen $75 a month. Eng-
she must now disband the energies I lald, during the war, paid her seamen
?'2a month. The French and Dutch
are paying high wages. In Sweden
the seamen's scale is even higher than

being.
"There is every reason," Mr. Hur
ley continued, "for believing that ia the United States."

HERE ARE THE LOCATIONS
20 ACRES About 5' miles southeast of Ranger, in the Ranger
Duke pool, where we are surrounded by producing wells and big
companies, such as the Sun Oil company, Prairie Oil and Gas
company, Magnolia, and others. It is on this block that we expect
to drill our first well. The members of the company have had the
services of some nationally known geologists, and. they pronounce
this block equal to anything in the Ranger Field.
20 ACRES About 10 miles northwest of Ranger, surrounded
on five sides by gushers. This block is in the center of operations
in the field northwest of Ranger where there has not een a
single disappointment.
In the territory northwest of Ranger, some of the largest
gushers in the district have been brought in, and have made mil
lions of dollars for their companies.
This is a very valuable block of land and alone, we believe,
when developed, will be worth many times the capitalization of the
company.
Oil men place a value of $2,000,000 on a 500-barrel well; a well
of this size would pay, based on present prices, about $400,000
annually.
200 ACRES Just southwest of Moran, where producing wells
are being brought in regularly. '
The wells in this territory are not as deep as those near
Ranger, and the production is lighter. However, this 200-acre
block is a valuable piece of land, and we have every reason to
believe it good for production.
30 ACRES Just southeast of Putnam. This block is about
1 1-4 miles from the Cathey well, which was reported a few days
ago as making several hundred barrels. This well proved a large
sectioa of territory and, being on the west of our block, puts us
directly between this well and the heart of production closer to
Ranger.
We have, in the eastern part of Stephens County, Oklahoma, in
the Healdton Field.
20 ACRES, which are in the shallow veil field, where produc
tion is almost sure. The Healdton Field is too "well known to
require much mention here.
In the western part of Stephens county, Oklahoma, and directly
in line between the Burkburnett and Healdton Fields, we have
160 ACRES There are over 100 rigs drilling in Stephens and
Gotten counties, and this 160-acre block promises to be very' valu
able. In the Holbrook, Arizona Field, the greatest excitement and
the center of interest of the western states, we have.
640 ACRES This is a new field and is attracting a great deal
of attention. Many prominent geologists have looked over the
Holbrook Field and the general opinion is that "Holbrook is the
center of one of the greatest oil pools yet discovered."

DALLAS, Texas. March 13. The second wonder gusher of

Three weeks ago this well came in with 5000 barrels. Drilling
was stopped when the sand had been barely drilled into. The
drillers went five feet further Wednesday and the well responded
by sending oil hundreds of feet in all directions, almost bursting
the pipes, with 14,000 barrels per day.
On the north edge of the Ranger pool, two wells are on the

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, March 24 The uneven
and hesitant course which marked to
day's compartively dull stock market
was attributed not so much to the im
pending recess as to the disquieting
teuor of the foreign news.
An unexpected development was the
favorable change in the market for
metals. Reports' of a broad inquiry
for refined copper, the first since the
series cf drastic cuts in that commod
ity, lifted that group 1 to 2i points,
but much of this advance was can
celled on publication of the reduced
Anaconda dividend.
Sugars, several of the oils, and sun- j
dry miscellaneous issues gave a' semb
lance of strenth at intervals, but equip
meuts, motors and high-grade petro
leums were reactionary.
United States Steel and related
shares lost 1 to 3 points, equipments
1 to 2, motors 1 to almost 4 and ship
pings 1 to 2.
Rails showed all their recent slug
gishness. Sales amounted to 750,000
shares.
Nominal dealings in foreign ex
change .especially lires, refelcted fur
the rerratic tendencies. Call money
ruled at 5'i re rcent and time funds
eased, but few lqans were reported.
Liberty bonds shaded slightly, for
eign issues wer efractionally lower and
the general list was heavy. Total
sales, par value, $12,30O,O(JO. , Old
United States bonds were unchanged.
- GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, March 24. Export pur
chases of corn here, the first that
have been made in some time, lifted
the market today to new high levels
for the season. Closing prices, how
ever, were unsettled, &c net lower to
an advance of 2c, wtih May $1.47 to
$1.47 and July $1.3734 to ?1.37"s.
Oats gained i c to Ac. The result in
provisions was a setback of 15 to 37
cents.
At first the cornmarket showed con
siderable "weakness owing to larger
receipts and to fine weather. Then
word began to circulate that export
demand for corn had resulted in actual
business here amounting to upward
of 150,000 bushels and that additional
foreign buying was in prospect. Near
the end of the day, however, an offi
cial forecast of cheaper values for
foodstuffs led to something of a reac
tion. Oats sympathized - with the
strength of corn.
'Weakness in the hog market had a
depressing effec on provisions.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY, MARCH 25, 1919.
BUSINESS MEN WILL
' DEMAND LEAGUE OF
NATIONS SAYS HAYDEN
Congressman Believes Boycott
Stronger Than War, and
Pact Needed
Business men and financial inter
ests in the United States will see to
it that the League of Nations' plan is
adopted, in the opinion of Carl Hay
den, representative in congress from
Arizona, who arrived in Bisbee last
night. The greatest appeal of the
league covenant, declares Mr. Hayden,
is to business interests. Mr. Hayden
will remain In Bisbee over today. He
brings with him word from Joe Mal
donado and Mrs. Maldonado, formerly
of this city.
"The weapon selected by the league
for the enforcing of its mandates,"
declares Mr. Hayden, "is stronger than
war. Trade boycott goes home to the
entire people as no war can. We have
felt it here in the United States dur
ing the past two years. We have had
to go without tin for cans and have
had that reflected in the price of
canned goods. We have been limited
in our supply of rubber. We were
handicapped for many months and
until we adapted ourselves to manu
facture, by the lack of dyestuffs.
Boycott Helps U. S.
"The United States is fortunate in
a trade boycott, because the United
States is practically the only nation
on the glode which is self-contained.
We suffer less from the lack of im
ports and exports than any other
country. We can raise JpracticallH
everyinmg we need right here at
home. In this respect we can profit
through the covenant where other na
tions are laying themselves subject
to the most stringent weapon in the
world.
"The covenant of the league fur
thers industry and business in every
channel,' continued Mr. Hayden. "The
peace terms already dictated to Ger
many have declared the Hun shall
have an army not to exceed 100,000
men to be recruited for vi years. Now,
France is' the closest in danger from
Germany. She reasonably can argue
that with the German armed force
cut to 100.000 men, the French force
can be sliced from a standing army
of 1,000,000 to 300,000 or 250,000 men.
" "la the same manner the force of
England will be reduced, the force
of the United States will permit of
paring and other nations of the globe
will be offered the same opportunities.
Maldomado in Spain.
"Men by the hundreds of thousands
formerly required for the armies of
the globe will be released to turn
their hands to peaceful, productive oc
cupations. Taxes on the nations for
the upkeep of armies will be reduced.
Therein lies the great appeal for the
league. It is abusiness proposition
and with certain changes to protect
he Monroe doctrine it will be adopt
ed" ' Joe Maldomado is now in Spain,
declares Mr. Hayden. Mrs. Maldo
mado is in Washington engaged, in
war work.
Maldonado - went to Washington
three years ago from Eisbee, where
he had been interpreter in the local
courts. He was attached in the cap
ital city to the office force of Mr.
Hayden. When Mr. Hayden was com
missioned In the army, it was neces
sary for Maldona to find other feilds

Offered for Sale at
Once by City
By an overwhelming majority 258
to 42 the taxpayers of Bisbee yester
day voted in favor of a bond issue for
j street paving. More than 84 per cent
ot the registration voted in favor of
the bond issue, which is the largest
per cent ever registered.
With the .significant majority of 216.
city- officials are most surprised at
the result, for although they realized
the majority cf taxpayers of Bisbee
were in favor of street paving they
did not expect the election to termin
ate with such a majority.
Now that the electors have decided
to pave the streets the next step on
the part of the city will be to adver
tise the bonds of which there will be
200 at J1000 each. Should no difficulty
be experienced in disposing of the
bonds immediately, the city will take
immediate action-toward commencing
actual work.
Following are the returns of the vot
ing in the three city wards:
First ward Registered, S3; voted,
65; for, 46; against, 19.

EARLY MAIL DELIVERY
SOUGHT AT WARREN
A petition for better mail service is
being circulated among Warren resi
dents by local business men. Al
though two deliveries of mail a day
are made at Warren the residents feel
that something should be done to get
the mail at the postoffice earlier. At
present the mail is delivered at 9
o'clock in the morning and 4 o'clock in
the afternoon. It has been suggested
by some that the mail be thrown off
at DonLuis or have trains back up to
the Warren depot and leave the mail,
in order that it can arrive at the post
office in time for 8 o'clock deliveries.
reports of accomplishments in the first j
day we-e made and last night it was J
impossible to ascertain how much had j
been pledged in the early hours of the '
drive.
The first report of team captains
and workers will bo received by Ar
thur Noiinun, chairman of the drive, at
3 o'clock this afternoon. Team leaders
will meet with the chairman at this
hour for consultation as to results and
plans and difficult problems which
may have arisen will be discussed.
Teams were assigned to districts be
fore they left the Y. W. C. A. yester
day morning. The entire community
was divided into 12 districts, similar
to those of the last LiSerty loan drive.
Each team wili canvass one of the di
visions. Teams consist of captains and
at least two members selected by the
feapiains.
Flans discussed at the meeting yes
terday morning and tentatively adopt
ed are for a whirlwind canvass" of the
various districts today and tomorrow.!)
If the total of the budget has not ceen 1 1
subscribed by that -time, the teams j
will extend their period of work and''
begin a systematic campaign to secure j
subscriptions from every man and wc-;
man on the street, in the stores andji
offices, and elsewhere. It is hoped,
however, that the entire campaign can
be concluded insidethree days.
Subscriptions which are not solicit
ed may be left at the Y. M. C. A. or
Y. W. C. A. buildings, it was an
nounced last night. Experience has
taught the campaign managers that it
is impossible for teams to visit every
one, and that in the past large and
substantial funds have been lost by
not providing centrally located receiv
ing offices.

CALIFORNIA SENATE
PASSES I. W. W. BILL
lEv Kv1?w Leased Wire)
SACRAMEXTO, March 24 The sen
ate of the California legislature pass
ed today the "criminal t syndicalism"
bill. There was no negative vote.
The measure, it was said, was intend
ed primarily to '"stop the propaganda j
of an organization known as the In
dustrial Workers of the World, which j
seeks to accomplish its' objects by acts !
of terrorism." The measure now goes
to the assembly.
Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpos
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty.
there are evidently thousands of men j
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness. .
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is "contain
ed in modern foods. Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phos
phate known among druggists as bitro
phosphate, which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
most all druggists under a guacantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and by sun
plying the body cells with the neces
sary phosphoric food elements, bitro
phosphate quickly produces a welcome
transformation in the appearance; the
increase in weight frequently being
astonishing.
This increase in weight also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness
and lack of energy, which nearly al
ways accompany excessive thinness,
soon disappear, dull eyes become
bright, and pale cheeks glow with the
bloom of perfect health.
CAUTION: Although bitro-phos-phate
is unsurpassed for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen
eral weakness, it should not, owing to
its remarkable flesh-growing proper
ties, be used by anyone who does not
desire to put on flesh. Adv.
