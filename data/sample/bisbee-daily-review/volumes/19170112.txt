lature convened this morning it had
been reported to members, who had
determined to take action on a resolu
tion recognizing Thomas E. Campbell
as de" facto governor that the supreme
court would almost certainly render
a decision on that point not later than
next Monday. Accordingly the resolu
tion of recognition was withdrawn and
a split was everted. After a brief
session the Senate wag adjourned until
tomorrow morning and the House un
til Monday morning.
The House passed under a suspen
sion of the rules a bill appropriating
$50,000 for the current and contingent
expenses of the legislature. But how
the fund so appropriated are to be
made available is another problem.
Under the rules the salaries of mem
bers and attaches are payable every
Monday. The state treasurer ' and
auditor, however, decline to act upon
warrants bearing the signature of
either of the governors until the ques
tion of the de facto governor is set
tled. But both stated ... this morning
that they would do so" If the warrants
bore the signatures of both governors.
In the. Senate four bills were in
troduced by Mr. Rutherford of Yavapai
county. One of them proposes the ap
propriation of $20,000 for a bridge
across the Verde River near Cotton
wood and another 112.500 for a bridge
across Oak Creek near Cornville,
Yavapai county to raise a similar
amount in each case.
An'Jther bill authorizes the appoint
ment of assistant clerks to boards of
supervisors in counties of the fourth
class, with a salary of $125 a month.
Another bill defines lewdness not
now included in the penal statues as
crime and fixes the penalty on convic
tion at from one t'j five years in the
penitentiary. The salary of the ex
ecutive attaches were
fixed In each 1
house.
The secretary of the Senate will re
ceive $7 a day. the assistant secretary
$6. and air other employes $5 a day.
The same figures were adopted In the
House except the assistant clerk will
receive $7.
PHOENIX. Jan. 11. By unanimous
vote the lower house of the Arizona
legislature today adapted a resolution

commended to the secretary of the in
terior for the President's serious con
sideration the abolishment tor reduc

county delegation led the fight in favor
of the resolution.
Both houses went to work today
without even mentioning the governor

Senate by Rutherford, of Yavapai. Two
of these provided for bridees over the

SHELL FACTORY

Shells for British Govern
ment, Goes Up in Blasts.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Jan. 11. The plant of
the Canadian Car and Foundry com
pany, one half mile east of Kingsland,
N. J., in which there were stored hun
dreds of thousands Of shells destined
for the British government, was de
stroyed late today by fire and a series
of explositions which continued for
three hours. So far as could be learn
ed tonight, no one was killed or in
jured although it was said 17 Work
men were missing. No estimate of the
loss was obtainable but it was said it
might reach $4,000,000.
Approximately 1,100 men were em
ployed In the'-plant which comprised
between ,40 and 50 buildings. No mu
nitions were manufactured at Kings
land but the plant was used for the
filling of shells, the chief constituent
used being trinitrotoluol, one of the
most powerful explosives known.'
While it was estimated that nearly
500,000 shells exploded, primary fuses
or caps had not been attached to them
and consequently their detonation did
not cause the havic that follows their
explosion when used on European bat
tle fronts. The roar of the shells,
which sounded like a cannonade from
heavy guns, was heard for miles, how
ever, and the concusbions shook build
ings within a wide radius of the plant
Kingsland, Rutherford and other
places nearby were tilled with refug
ees tonight who had fled from their
homes in the vicinity of the plant A
dozen persons were arrested at Kings
land on charges of petit larceny and
Orders were issued by the sheriff of
Bergen county to the guards sent out
bv nlm in a11 directions to shoot loot
ers.
Thomas H. Huckin, county prosecu
tor, and his assistants began investiga
tion tonight to fix responsibility for
the disaster. The fire which began at
3:50 p. m. still was smoldering late to
night in the ruins. Shells exploded al
most continuously until 7:30 o'clock
but after that hour the detonations
were only intermittent
NEW YORK. Jan. 11. James J.
Kelly, warden of the Snake Hill peni
tentiary, about one mile from the
scene of the explosions said at 6:45
o'clock tonight that the detonations
were as violent as they had been ah
hour before. The priBon building,
which contains 219 prisoners, was be
ing severely shaken, he said, and he
felt alarmed for safety. All the glass
In the prison windows had been brok
en. The prisoners were badlv fright
ened but were behaving well and ar
rangements were being made to re
move them should the detonations last
much longer.

plant who fled to escape the explosions
are reported to have broken thromrb

on Behalf of Central Nations
"Comes BackM at Allied Na

(By Review Leased Wire)
1 BERLIN, Jan. 11. (Wireless to Say-
jville) Germany today handed neutral
governments a note concerning the re-
, of tne MtMIIe t0 tne German peace
proposals, the Overseas News Agency
announces
l Ak. A .'. n .. v. .......
11 IS ursb Biatru, - iwijb imr lie w a
agency announcement that the Ger
man government has received the re
ply of the entente to the note of De
cember 12, containing a proposition to
enter at once into peace negotiations.
The note continues:
"Our adversaries declined this pro
position, giving as the reason that it
lis a proposition without 'sincerity and
without Importance. The form in
which they clothe their communiea -
tion excludes an answer to them, but
the imperial government considers it
important to point out to the govern
ment of neutral powers its opinion re
garding the situation.
"The central powers have no reason
to enter into any discussion regarding
the origin of the war. History will
judge upon whom the immense guilt
of the war shall fall; history's verdict
will as little pass over the encircling
policy of England, tne revengeful poli
cy of France and the endeavor Of Rus
sia to gain Constantinople as over the
instigation of Russia which meant war
against Germany.
"Germany and her allies were forced j
to take up arms for defense of their
liberty and existence, consider this
their aim of the war, as obtained.
"On the other hand, the hostile pow
ers always went further away fiOm
according to the declarations of their
responsible statesmen, were among
others, directed toward the conquest
of Alsac-Lorraine and several Prussian
provinces, the humiliation and diminu
tion of the- Austro-Hungarian monar
chy: the partition of Turkey and the
mutilation of Bulgaria.
"In the fact of such war acts, the
demand for restitution, reparation, and
guarantees In the mouth of our ad
versaries produces a surprising effect
"Our adversaries call the proposal
of the fOur allied Teutonic powers a
war maneuver. Germany and her al
lies must protest in the most energe
tic fashion against such a characteriza
tion of their motives which were
frarjcly explained. They were per
suaded that a peace which was just
and acceptable to all the belligerents
was possible: that it could be brought
about by an immediate spoken ex
change of views and ' that therefore, '
the responsibility for further blood
shed could not be taken.
"Their readiness was affirmed with
out reservation to make known their
peace conditions when negotiations '
wore entered into which refutes every
doubt as to their sincerity.
Our adversaries who had It In their
hands to examine the proposition as I
to its contents, neither attempted an
examination nor made counter pro
posals. Instead, they declared that
peace was impossible so long as the
re-establishment of violated rights and
liberties, the recognition of the prin
ciple of nationalities and the free er
Istence Of small states were not guar
anteed. "The slnceritv which our adversaries
denies to the proposals to the allied
powers, will not be conceded by the
world to these demands because the
world holds before its eyes the fate
of the Irish people, the destruction of,

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. The en
tente reply to President Wilson's
peace note Is regarded in all quar
ters here as putting an early peace
practically out of the question, but
still leaving an open door for the
' President to make further efforts.
The official view on first consider
ation is that it constituted a complete
ansver to the President's note. Ger
man diplomats regard the reply as
even more severe than they expected.
.They declare it evident that the ene
mis of Grmany are waging a war of
conquest to crush and dismember her.
The Germanic a filed,' they declared,
never would agree to any such terms.
President Wilson's next movement
now becomes the center of nltentlon.
It will not be decided upon until a
careful and detailed study of the re
ply of both tbe central powers and
the entente has been made.
Several courses are open to thsj
President. He may inform each side
of the other's reply and in so doing
may forward the documents without
comment, or with some expression to
advance the situation to the point of
another exchange. He may begin a
series of confidential negotiation
' either through the ambassadors here
or through the ambassadors at the
foreign capitals. Also, he may base
his next step not upon the notes
alone, but upon an estimation of the
situation in the belligerent countries.

While the German diplomats de
nounced the terms laid down in the
"entente reply. American officials made
no attempt to estimate their real
feeling. Naturally they expected the
entente would state the limit of Its
expectations. At any rate they re

situation as a verbal stepping stone.

WaSHLN'OTO-V, Jan. 11. The entente allies replying to President
Wilson's peace note in a point communication express the belief
that it is impossible at the present moment to attain peace that will
assure them reparation, restitution and such guarantees aa they con
sider are essential.
In a separate note, the Belgian government expresses its desire for
peace hut declares it could only accept a settlement which would ts
sure it reparation and security in the future. '
Both of the communications, made j&blic by the state department
tonight are dated January 10 and were transmitted in iranslr.ticn from
the Fr.-nch texts through Ambassador Sharp at Paris.
The translation of the French text'
of the entente note, as cabled by
Ambassador Sharp, at Paris, follows:
"The allied governments have re
ceived the note which was delivered
to them in the name of the govern
ment of the United States on the
19th of December, 1916. They have
studied it with the care imposed upon
them both by the exact realization
which they have of the gravity of the
hour and by the sincere friendship
which attaches them to the American
people.
"In general they wish to declare
that they pay tribute to the elevation
of the sentiment with which the Am-
erlcan note is inspired and that they ! the immediate violation of Belgium
associated themselves with all their j and Luxemburg, and by her manner
hopes with the project for the crea-1 of conducting the war. her simulat
ion of a league of nations to insure j ing contempt for all principles or hu
peace and justice throughout the j manity and all respect for small
world. They recognize all the advan- states: as the conflict developed the
tages for the cause of humanity and
civilization which the Institution of
i 'iiernauonai agreements, aeaunea to
! old violent conflicts between nations
would pravent;
must Imply th
agreements which
sanction necessary
j to insure their execution and thus
to prevent an apparent security from
only faciliating new aggressions. But
a discussion of future arrangements
destined to Insure an enduring peace
which the responsibility rests with
the central powers and of which the
, principle itself tended to ruin the se-
curity of Europe; a peace which
I would on the other hand permit the
establishment of the future of Euro
pean nations of a solid basis. The
allied nations are conscious that they
are not fighting for selfish interests
but above all to safeguard the Inde
pendence of peoples, of right and of
humanity.
"The allies are fully aware of the
losses and suffering which the war
causes to neutrals as well as to bel-
ligerents and they deplore them; but
they do not hold themselves respon-
slble for them, . having In no way
either willed or provoked this war,
and they strive to reduce these dam
age in the measure compatible with
the Inexorable exigencies of their de-
fense against the violence and the
wiles of the enemy.
"It is with satisfaction, therefore,
that they take note of the declara
tion that the American communica
tion Is nowise associated In its origin
with that of the central powers, trans
mitted on the ISth of December by
the government of the United States.
They did not doubt moreover, the
resolution of that government to avoid
even the appearance of a support,
even moral, of the authors responsi
ble for the war.
President
the two groups of belligerents; this
assimilation, based upon public declar
ations by the central powers, is In
direct opposition to the evidence, as
regard responsibility for the past and
as concerning guarantees for the fu
ture; President Wilson in mentioning
it certainly had no intention of as
sociating himself with It.
"If there is any historical fact es
tablished at the present date, it is
the willful aggression of Germany and
Austria-Hungary to insure their hege
mony over Europe an dthelr economic
domination over the world. Germany
proved by her declaration of war. by
attitude of the central powers anj
their allies has been a continual de
fiance of humanity and civilization.
It Is necessary to recall the horror
which accompanied the Invasion of
Belgium and Serbia, the atrocious re-
clre Imposed upon the invaded eoun-
tries, the massacre of hundreds of
thousands of inoffensive Armenians,
the barbarities perpetrated against
the populations In Serbia, the raids
of Zf-ppellns on open towns, the de
struction by submarines of passenger
steamers an! of merchantmen even
under flags, the cruel treatment In
flicted upon prisoners of war: the
tti'Mclsl murders of Miss Cavell and
of Captain Fryatt. the deportation and
the reduction to slavery of civil popu
lations, etc. The execution of such
a series of crimes perpetrated with
out any regard for universal repro
bation fully explains to President
Wilson the protest of the allies.
"They consider that tl note which
they sent to the United States in
rnly to the Germsn note will be a
response to the questions put bv t
American government and according1
to the exact words of the latter, con
stitute 'a public declaration as to the
condition upon which the war could
be terminated.
"President Wilson desires more: he
desires that the belligerent powers
openly affirm the objects which they
seek by continuing the war; the al
lies experience no difficulty In reply
ing to this request. Their objects In
the war are well known. They have
formulated on many occasions by the
chiefs of their divers governments.
"Their objects in the war will
not be made known In detail with
all the equitable compensations '
and indemnities for damages suf
fered until the hour of negotia
tions. But the civilized world
knows that they imply in all
necessity and In the first in
stance the restoration of Belgium,
of Serbia, and of Montenegro
and the Indemnities which are due
them; the evacuation of the in
valid territories of France, of
Russia and of Rumania, with just
reparation, the reorganization
of Europe guaranteed by a stable
regime and founded as much
upon respect of nationalities and
full security and liberty (of)
economic development which all
nations, great or small, possess,

The Turks apparently are receiv

British in the Mesopotamia!! and
Eeyptian theaters. Following up
their advance northeast of Kut-el-Amara,
on the Tigris in Tesopotamla
early in the week, the British have
again attacked and captured Turkish
trenches on the right bank of the
river and inflicted heavy casuaTties
on the Ottomans.
On the Sinai peninsula. 30 miles
northeast of El Arish, Egypt, six lines
of Turkish trenches in front of the
town of Rafa, have been captured by
King George's men.
Hard fighting is still in progress
in the region of Riga in northwest
Russia, but the exact situation is still
not clear owing to the divergent re
ports of the Russian and German war
offices. Petrograd asserts that the
Russians south of Lake Babit cap
tured a village near the town of
Kalnsem and repulsed German coun
ter attacks further east.
Berlin says that all Russian attacks
were comparatively repulsed. Admis
sion is made by Petrograd that the
Russian and Rumanian forces in
Moldavia have made further retire
ments in the Oituz, Kassina, and
Suchitza regions, but it is asserted
that the Teutons who crossed the
Putna river north of KoksTiani have
been driven back across the stream,
suffering heavy casualties.
On the other fronts nothing but
minor operations and artillery duels
have taken place. The British on the
front in France have at several points
penetrated the German trenches in
flicting casualties on the defenders.

because it had other things in the
"works." -Another company which
perhaps better represents the answer
to the question, "What's the matter
with so many of the film offerings,"
bragged in print that it had turned
out a complete five-reel play in six
days.
In the methods followed by the
Clune company lies the hope of the
photodrama. In the signing of con
tracts, preparation of scenario (the
author greatly amplified his story for
this big production), and selection of
cast several months were consumed;
other months, nearly six in fact of
actual work were required for cut
ting, assembling and setting to music
of "The Eyes of the World." The
Clune company's aim is a finished
product in the belief that in that kind
lies the best commercial as well as
artistic possibilities.
"The Eyes o fthe World" will be
presented here in big city style, with
a large orchestra to play Us splendid

USING PSYCHOLOGY.
In a paper read before a meeting of scientists. President
Hall of Clark University credits much of Germany's amaz
ing efficiency in the conduct-of the war both at home and
in the trendies to the fact that Germany employed her
knowledge of psychology to place every man where Iia
could do the most and endure the longest. Men unable
mentally to stand the strain of fighting were put to work
at home. Only fighters were snt to the front.
France, too, is said to have used all the knowledge her
psychologists could furnish her in carrying on her fight.
England, for some unfathomable reason, has ignored
psychology as an ally in the war. The United States, too.
Is accused of having a foolish contempt or indifference to
what the psychologists can do. Of course, we are be
ginning to use psychology in many ways in our study of
criminals and defectives. But there's room for more.
If the distracted parents who can't imagine "what pos
sesses those children" would take a little time off to look
into the mental processes of their darlings they prob
ably would not only find out what possessed them, but
what was to be done about it.
Psychologists have perhaps made a good many mis
takes. Some of the things they have said in the past
they have taken back or revised. That seems to be the
way of progress. Eut It's foolish for the rest of us to
scorn the progress because of the blunders made by the
way. "'
DESERVED REVENUE
During the past year a matter that has been given con
siderable thought has been the immense demand for the
bulletins of the State Bureau of Mines from people ou
side of the State. Although the law that created the
Bureau of Mines allows the Board of Regents of the
University o Arizona to charge for the bulletins, the'
laws of the State provide that any money received must
be turned over to the State Treasurer, and will not apply
to the particular fund from which the money was spent.
It is believed that all of these bulletins should be dis
tributed free to the people of the state who desire them,
but it is also believed that the people outside of the
state, who do nothing to support the Bureau of Mines,
should pay something for its services. It is therefore an
ticipated that the Bureau will introduce into the legis
lature a bill providing for a nominal cost of bulletins for
those outside of the state, the money obtained to be re
turned to the Bureau of Mines printing fund to provide
for additional bulletins. In as much as the State Bureau
of Mines will probably publish a greater number of bulle
tins each year, the desirability of such a law is plainly
evident.
THE ART OF EGG HANDLING.
Can't anybody raise and sell eggs? According to W.
B. Barney, dairy commissioner of the great egg state of
Iowa, everybodycannot. In fact, he says, most of the
people on whom we now depend for our egg supply know
very little about handling eggs.
They don't know enough, in the first place, to keep only
good stock and rid their flocks of poor layers. They don't
know enough, in the second place, to take such care of
their hens as to get the best results from tliem. And in
the third place and this is w.'iat the commissioner is
particularly concerned with they don't 4 now enough to
get their eggs to market safely and profitably.-
Iowa's annual egg crop is estimated at $:'0,5imi.i(mi. Of
this amount,' .--ays Couiniiiisioiicr Barney, more thiiu
11,000,000 is lost in handling the eggs. Millions of cg;;s
are allowed to turn istalc before (lie producer sells them.
Millions more arc broken or spoiled by tan-less treatment
in the hands of the egg dealer.
Next sumuicr ConiniisMoncr Uamcy is going lo tour
the stale with a special car and an elaborate t-'iuipuicnt,
demonstrating how the eggs should be gathered, kept aud
handled all the way from the nest to the kitchen.
It isn't only eggs that iuvite such a demonstration. The
farm prod ijcqr-J hat is wasted in this country through carc
less, and stupid handling, rotting in the field or garden
or orchard or cellar or en route lo market, runs into the
hundreds of millions. It's just as important to eliminate
such needless losses as it is to increase our production.
It't even more important, because ijua the uvjilablc loud
supply 4it w Uttr?4i,il v.ilt let fiiuil nul fpeits:
SAVING OUR DAYLIGHT.
Now that the days are getting longer again, it's a good -l
time to begin thinking about saving next summers day
light. The National Daylight Saving Committee has al
ready taken the matter in hand. It will hold a convention
in New York City, January 30 and 31. Its purpose is to
call to the attention of the whole nation the advantages
of the plan adopted by many American cities last sum
mer. The idea is to have every clock in the United States
turned forward one hour on May 1 and back again on
September 30. Thus for the five months during which
the sun rises earlier and sets latest, the nation would be
expected to do an hour more of its sleeping in the dark
hours and an hour more of its work and recreation in
the daylight hours.
It's a step toward the good old customs of our fore
fathers, who got up early and went to bed early, usiug
the night for its proper purpose which is sleep and
getting full benefit of the sunlight. Everybody would
simply turn his clock or watch forward an hour when be
went to bed the last night in April. Then, a person ac
customed to rising at 7 would rise the same time as usual
by his timepiece, but in reality an hour earlier. It would
be an easy change to make if everybody would agree
to it
Of course, a perfectly reasonable and sensible people
would get up earlier in the summer. time without going
to the trouble of fooling themselves and making their j
clocks lie about it. But perfectly reasonable and sensible
people seem scarce. And inasmuch as Great Britain,
France, Germany, Italy, Austria, Norway, Sweden and
Denmark have all adopted the plan proposed, and several
other nations will adopt it this year, there's no particular
reason why the United States should hesitate to do it.
The reform means, in effect, getting through with your
day's work an hour earlier and having an extra hour for
recreation before it gets dark. It means mere sunligh'.,
and therefore better health. It means, too, economy in
the use of gas and electricity, because there's an hour of 1
artificial illumination saved in the evening.

THE PITTSBURG GUARDSMEN.
Pittsburg was very sorry for its National Guard regi
ment at the border. The lioys were aid to be dreadfully
weary and homesick. A public agitation was started in
their behalf. Meetings were held. A deputation of lead
ing citizens was sent to Washington to intercede and ob
tain their recall. The campaign was successful. The
Eighteenth was ordered home. And Pittsburg prepared
to receive the homesick lads with fitting festivities.
Then Pittsburg sot a surprise. The regiment refused
to participate in the home-coming banquet and other
preparations of welcome. The members were sore. They
said they had been misrepresented. They didn't want to
be recalled. They hadn't exectly enjoyed life - on the
Mexican frontier, but they had enjoyed the consciousness
of doing their duty, aud they were shamed of pulling out
before their job was finished.
It was a stinging rebuke for the meddling solicitude
which has. been responsible for much misunderstanding
of the National Guard. There has been a great deal of
complaining, but little of it has keen done by the Guards
men themselves. It is their civilian friends at home
aided and abetted by a few misguided National Guard
officers who have made most of the trouble. The
Guardsmen themselves, particularly the rank and file,
l ave done their duty as citizens and soldiers, without
slackening and whining. -
A FARMER GOVERNMENT.
Kansas now takes a back seat for radicalism. North
Dakota has leaped into the national limelight as the
boldest innovator of the whole 4S states.
The administration which has just assumed control 's
a government of farmers, by farmers and for farmers.
The governor is a simon-pure farmer, who never before
had anything to do with politics. The speaker of the
house is a farmer-, and an overwhelming majority of rep
resentatives are farmers. Every state officer but one is
a farmer, and the supreme court is filled with farmer
judges. The only thing that mars the general unanimity
is a slight "Conservative" majority in the state senate.
The program those farmers intend to put through is
enough to make an old-timer gasp for breath. Talk alHjut
farmers as a class being conservative! Here are a few
things these North Dakota agriculturists are committed
to:
State-owned terminal elevators. Hour mills, packing
plants, storage plants and warehouses; the inauguration
of the single tax, which involves the exemption of farm
improvements from taxation; state hail insurance; a
rural credit bank operated by the state at cost; the aboli
tion of political parties.
This program and the men back of it represent the
Farmers' Non-partisan league, a new force in North
Dakota affairs, which already numbers 60,000 men aud is.
said to be a secret organization. If a majority of North
Dakota citizens, being farmers, choose to run the state
primarily in their own interests, that's North Dakota':;
business.

NEW YORK, Jan. 11. The broader
and more active operations of today's
market were largely if not entirely
governed by foreign developments.
Rails were the only issues of Im
jortance to manifest backwardness,
making only trifling recoveries.
Heaviest among the rails were Read
ing, St. Paul. New Haven and some
oUhe trans-continentals.
Early dealings were attended by
further unsettlement in specialties.
General Motors adding another 5 '4
points to its spectacular reversal of
tie three preceding days, with one
to three points, in minor industrials,
equipments at 111. Coppers again
were in favor, regardless of denials
of any impending contracts with for
eign interests. Total sales amounted
to 1,150,000 shares.
Exchange rates on London were
firmer. . Francs and marks were un
altered, but rubles hovered around
'be low quotation of yesterday. Other
international issues were heavy,
Anglo-French 5's repeating last year's
minimum quotation of 9-Vi. Railroad
bonds tended toward irregularity. To
Ul sales of bonds, par value $5,
473.000. United States bonds wtre unchang
ed on call, but the tegistired 4 'a were
per cent down on an actual sale.
GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Jan. 11. Bullish antici
pations concerning the reply of the
entente allies gave a substantial life
today to wheat prices here. The mar
ket closed strong, 3 to 4 net higher,
with May at 1.874 to and July
at 1.51 to Corn gained W. to 1
and oats to In provisions the
outcome was a setback of 10 to 25
cents.
During the earlier trading the de
clines and upturns alternated rapidly,
the bears at times getting the advan
tage owing to renewal of peace hopes
and to continued fear of submarine
activity iu the Atlantic. News of the
sinking of the British warship Corn
wallis led also to a flurry about fresh
buying. Final quotations were at al
most the highest point reached.
Corn advanced owing mainly to
word of increased drought damage
in the Argentina.
Oats ' hardened with other grains.
Absence of support weakened provi
sions. After a general decline, how
ever, packers turned to the buying
side and effected something of a rally.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 11. Freezing
winds sweeping about the White
House grounds today played such
havoc with the suffragist "silent sen
tinels" on guard at the main gatet
that President Wilson was moved tc
send a messenger to invite the wom
en in to get warm. The invitatior
was net accepted, and at the head
quarters of the congressional union
for woman suffrage, it was said the
vigil would be continued tomorrow
This was the second day of the
union's new campaign to force Its
cause upon the President's attention
which it is planned to continue to
March 4.
In spite of frequent reliefs and the
use of hot bricks wrapped in news
paper and much drinking of hot choc
olate, the guards now and again
sought shelter behind the big stone
pillars flanking the gateway-. t
The President passed the sentinels
only once, as be returned from his
morning game of golf. He! smiled as
his automobile swept into the grounds,
but took r.o other notice of his visi
tors. Word of the trials of the women
reached the White House family and
shortly after noon the President gave
the first evidence of having his at
tention forced by sending the chief
usher out with his invitation. There
were no acceptances.
A message for transmission to
Dutch Suffragists was delivered by
the Congressional Union today to the
Netherlands legation. The Nether
lands women were congratulated for
placing sentinels outside the parlia
ment building in Holland during the
last few weeks, and were told that
the suffragists here also were "laying
seige to the seat of government"

early hostility which greetd the Am

effort not V. o anything wh..I woul
cause offense in this country.
Peace at 6 l early date is foresee a
here now Only on terms known tc te
acceptable to Germany. The allies,
are thought to have committed them
selves by the definiteness of their
statements to a continuation of the
war till such time as they have either
attained or been convinced that they
cannot attain a military victory. Their
note is regarded as so emphatic that
they cannot retreat from it without
at least one more spring campaign.
Officials will await with deepest
interest, confidential reports on tie
reception among the people of Ger
many of the entente reply. With Ger
man troops in France, Belgium, Ru
mania, adn large parts of Russia, the
demands of the entente are expected
to be received with great surpsise.
In that connection the phrase dis
claiming intention to exterminate the
German peoples is thought to have
been written.
Much interest attached to the de
mand for restitution of provinces
wrested from the allies in the past.
While no special locality was named,
Alcase-Lorraine is understood to be
indicated, together with any further
territorial reapjustmenta that the mil
itary situation may justify. This
clause is understood to have ben
inserted for its elasticity.
"The enfranchisement of popula
tions suhject to the bloody tyranny
of the Turks," is said to apply to
rabia, part of which already has de
clared its independence under allied
Protection. Armenia, most of which
is occupied by Russian troops and
Syria, the southern tip of which Brit
ish troops from Suez have just reach
ed. It is felt that if the Turks also
were driven from Europe, only a small
oart of thei rem pi re would be left.
Deep interest also centered in the
section proposing the "expulsion from
Europe of the Ottoman empire," and
'he failure to mention what govern
ment would take its place at Con
stantinople. That city with Us con
trol of the Dardanelles has been one
of the prime keynotes of the war and
was formally stated by Premier T re
no ff to have been promised by the
sliies to Russia. Whether the omis
sion marks any change of policy or
lack of agreement or whether it was
nade to emphasize the attitude to
ward the Turk, is unexplained.
Germany and her allies, it was stat
ed here tonight, never will agree to
terms similar to these in the entente
inte. Unforseen dvelopments, or
some measures by the United States.
German diplomats feel, can alone
shorten the war. It was reiterated
that upon no condition would Ger
many part with Alcase-Lorraine
which she considers a part of Ger
many proper. German comment was
especially bitter on that part of the
note in which indemnities and repar
ations are mentioned. The German
view wa3 that the allies have in their
note an i itention to g't ba'Jt t ie
territory they have lost and Keep that
I which they Lave gained.
I Only one hopeful passage was iitid
in German quarters. This was the
declaration of a desire above all "to
insure a peace upon the principle of
liberty and justice." Such a prin
ciple, it was declared, was what was
wanted by Germany.
The possibility that President Wil
son might see fit to communicate to
the central powers the terms of the
entente allies was considered in Ger
man quarters and it was felt that in
such an event it was well within the
range of possibilities that Grrmany
and her allies might then say .they
would be willing at least to discuss
these terms unacceptable as they are.
While the opinion prevails that should
President Wilson desire to continue
the negotiations, the note offers an
opening for him to do so.

FOREMAN IS OFFERED
BRIBE FOR JOB; MAN
IS HELOUP TO SCORN
Local Boss Who Hires Many
Men Tells 'Rustling Miners'
that He Hires Men on Merit
Not on Bribe.
Typical of the L'jsses In the War
ren District is the action of a fore
man. In the employ of the Calumet &
Arizona mining company, yesterday
morning when he caused the removal
of a man from the property because
the latter attempted to bribe him fur
work.
It would appear that a njan had
"rustled" for several days -with little
chance. For men were being put t'j
work at the mine. Finally he took
an envelope and, addressing it to the
foreman, had the watchman hand it
to him.-
Yesterday morning the man was
nearer the front and the first thing
the foreman did was to ask him to
stand out so the others could see him.
He then produced the envelope and
tbok a $10 bank note out of it.
He told the men who were looking
for work that he was not to be bribed
for work: that when he wanted men
be selected them regardless of their
looks, except as'miners. and he point
ed with shame to the man who had
made the attempt to buy a job for $10.
Undoubtedly, after the experience yes
terday, few efforts will be made to
bribe any of the Warren District fore
man or bosses.
