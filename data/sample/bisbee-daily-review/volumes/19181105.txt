AUSTRIA CAPITULATED IIP 1 KI11Y TO DO LKEMSE
REPEATED SUCCESSES OE OUR
TROOPS V1TH DEFECTION OF
HER LAST Ally FINAL BLOW
Forsaken by Her Fighting Friends, With Internal Eruption
Threatening, Knell of Hohenzollern Dynasty Appears to
- Be Near Since Allies' Representatives Have Prepared
Stern Demands; Only France Remains to Be Freed of Hun,
and This Rapidly Is Being Accomplished by British, French
and American Armies, Which Win Great Victories
UNDATED WAR LEAD, (By the Associated Press).
With Germany's allies vanquished and forced to accept terms
for a cessation of hostilities against them tantamount to ab
ject surrender, the die is now to be cast in front of the Hohen
zollern dynasty.
The inter-allied conference, sitting in Versailles, has
drawn up the terms under which Germany may have peace
and the indications are that these terms will be no less hard
than those imposed on Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and
Turkey. Z-M
Forsaken by all her allies, Germany, the power that
hoped to be able to dominate the world by force, is at the
threshhold of acknowledging defeat by capitulation or con
tinuing, which means ultimate utter defeat.
The terms accepted by Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria and
Turkey have shorn all these states of power. Those imposed i
on Germany surely will be no less severe in rendering that
country powerless to resume hostilities even in the far future.
Meanwhile, pending presentation of the dictum of the
allies, German armies in Belgium and France are the only
ones left of the Teutonic allied group which are under attack.
And they are being sorely tried. In the Italian theater Austria-Hungarians,
utterly crushed, having lost thousands of
men killed and 300,000 taken prisoner, are standing bewil
dered Isefore the victorious Italian, French, British, American
and Czecho-Slovak armies. Respite from further punishment
was given them Monday afternoon at 3 o'clock. Northern
Italy again is Italian and Trentr Trieste and other places which
the Italians always have claimed as their own are dominated
by the Italians and fly the tri-color of the kingdom.
Almost all of the Adriatic coast line now is in the hands
of the Italians and Albania is all but cleared of the defeated
Austro-Hungarians. Likewise eastern Serbia is freed of the
enemy and a few days more doubtless will see the remainder
of the straggling Austro-Hungarians making their way out of
the western part of the kingdom across the Save river into
their own territory. As for Bulgaria and Turkey, they no
more are menacing. ,

Over a front of thirty miles in north

WASHINGTON, Nov. 4. Three
hundred thousand Austrian soldiers
and not less than 5000 guns had
been captured by the victorious
Italian armies before the armistice
went into effect at 3 o'clock this
afternoon said an official dispatch
toqight. This included all captures

24th.
The soldiers f the once-powerful
Austrian army, the dispatch said, con

offensive started 63 Austro-Hungarian
divisions were put out of combat by
SI Italian divisions, three British and
two French divisions, with 1 Czecho
slovak units and an American regi

which was conducted under the high
command of his majesty, the king of
Italy, with an army inferior in number
and with still inferior means since the
24th of May, 1915, has come to an
end," said the dispatch. "With un

the Kalian army waged a continuous

WASHINGTON. Nov. 4 Austria

abject surrender. Not only have the
armed forces of the once powerful
Austro-Hungarian empire laid down
their arms to await the end of the
war and peace terms dictated by
the allies and the United States,
but Austro-Hungarian territory ia
open for operations against Ger
many! Even the munitions of the former
ally are to be used against the kaiser's
armies if refusal to accept conditions
now being prepared for them make
prolonged fighting necessary.
Terms Are Accepted
The terms which stopped the victor
ious advance on the Italian front were
accepted by the Austrian commander
in chief in the field in the name of
the Vienna government, and their
execution is guaranteed by the thor
ough beating already administered
which had converted the defeated
army into a disorganized, fleeing
horde.
Even the terms imposed previously
upon Bulgaria and Turkey hardly
were so drastic. In addition to all of
the military precautions, the Austrian
are compelled to retire from a single
strip of territory within the borders cf
their empire when the war began, sur
rendering all of Italia Irredentia and
thereby losing any advantage for argu
ment over boundaries around a peace
table.
Cede Much Territory
A map survey of the geographical
lines fixed for Austrian evacuation
shows the area is greater- than that
set by the Italians aa the goal of their
ambition when they entered the war.
At that time Italian leaders carefully
outlined and indicated on their war
maps territory along their borders
which they deemed it necessary they
acquire for racial and sentimrnial
reasons and also to insure security of
their frontiers.
In decreeing Austria's surrender
terms, the supreme war council at
Versailles has followed this outline
closely, but have enlarged on it. Right
of occupation of these vacated prov
ince ia stipulated; but it is to be noted
that for the time being civil govern
ment is to be administered by existing
local civil authorities in cooperation
with occupying garrisons. This means
the whole question of final disposition
of the territory involved is left to be
settled at the peace table.
Italians Are Thrilled

the last German stronghold west of

lines forward for an average gain of
five kilometers.
The forces on the heights are now
only about seven and one-half miles
from Carlgnan, on the Meuires-Metz

Sedan, bringing both places within

HUNS FIGHT STUBBORNLY.
WITH THE AMERICAN AilMY ON
THE SEDAN FICONT, Nov. 4, 6 p. m.
(By the Associated Press.) The
German resistance encountered by the
American troops in virtually all parts
of the front was the feature of the
fighting today. The opposition was
especially stubborn on tbe right and
left flanks, where the enemy brought
up reinforcements and defended him
self with machine guns and artillery.
The American left wing pushed for
ward slowly but doggedly. The
Americans occupied Verrleres and
Ochej. The right wing worked its
way down the river Meuse and
reached a line between Beaumont
and Beauclalre and Borth of Halves
end Wlseppe. This flank met with
the most stubborn resistance from the
enemy, who fought bitterly to pre
vent encroachment on the important
town of Stenay.
American troops in mass made no
effort to cross the river Meuse. Pa
trols encountered heavy machine
gun and artillery fire at every at
tempt. They remained at nightfall
upon the west bank.
The center moved so fast that they
took prisoner German reinforcements

HUN IS VINDICTIVE
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN, Nov. 4,
(By the Associated Press.) Buzancy,
the largest town delivered by the
Americans, reflects the spirit of tbe
vindictiveness displayed by the Ger
mans when they are forced to alAndon
a region they have held for any con
siderable time. The town had been
almost wholly Germanized. Grencb
civilians had disappeared a long time
ago and the signs over the shops
were all in German. On the streets
and avenues such names as Wilhelm
strasse had been substituted for those
in French.
There was evidence that the Ger
mans had carried on the usual activi
ties in the municipality but with com
plete contempt for previous conditions
and with a desire to wipe out any sug
gestions as to those who had former
ly lived there. Their departure, how
ever, was marked as in few other
cases, by a desire to leave desolation
behind them. From end to end the
streets of the town and the houses
reek with the stench of filth wilrully
distributed. The place was a scene of
loot, wanton destruction and enfoul
ment but whether the work was car
ried out by order is not known.
All such things as were portable
are gone from the town. Heavy fur
niture including mahogany tables,
w aril robes and pianos were broken to
bits and left in the houses. Interior
decorations were irreparably muti
Iated.

NEW POSITIONS IMPORTANT
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE SEDAN FRONT. Nov. 4, (By the
Associated Press, 10 p. m.) The im
portance of the new positions gainee
by the Americans, notably the heights
south of eUaumont, may be gauged
from a declaration by the chief cf
staff hardly an hour before the news
came that the Germans had begun to
retreat from their positions.
Sunday noon the correspondent hac
ask'jd as to whether the American
long range bombardment of the Mezi-eres-Longuoyon
railway had been ef
fective. The officer gave it as his opin
ion that a further advance of from
nine to ten miles was necessary before
the bombardment could become vitally
effective. Nor did he anticipate that
it would be possible to seriously dis
turb the Germans' communication for
days to come, for he pointed out, re
ferring to a large scale map, the infin
itely difficult terrain lying to the
north, with its succession of ridges, ra
vines, hills and forests.
The enemy, he shaid, though driven
behind his previously prepared forti
fied defenses had abundantly shown
the ability to utilize each knoll and
clump of trees for echeloned machine
gun protection, which had to be
wiped out individually before an ad
vance was possible.

THE
TRUTH
ABOUT
CANDY
I
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. W. Gladwell,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, 1 suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
ind my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... I gained, and was well
tnd strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to'help
others."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
lilments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years, ,
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need. '

Some people have the mistaken idea that if candy making ceased there
would be no sugar shortage.
Just to see what would be the turn of affairs under such conditions,
pretend that tomorrow you could get no more candy.
Tomorrow 200,000 people would be seeking new employment most
of them women. Think of it, a city the size of Toledo out of work!
Think of the Liberty Bond accounts that would go by default on
payments temporarily stop!
America's thirty-eighth largest industry would be no more.
Allied manufacturers would be seriously aff rcted.
Over $110.C0O,OOO invested in the candy Industry would suffer a re
lapse. ,
And, in view of all this, would you get an increased allotment of
sugar?
Why, if the sugar was entirSy taken away from the candy industry
and divided pro rata among the American people, each person woula
get less than one-third pound a month in addition to what they now
receive. Would this compensate for ths injury done the industry for
the untold happiness candy brings to children the satisfaction rt
gives the adult the acfrded strength it imparts to the fighting man?
Frankly now, in your opinion is the candy industry essential?

TERMS MADE
FOR GERMANY
TO ABIDE BY
(Continued from Page One)
diplomatic unity has been achieved un
der conditions of utmost harmony."
Mean Absolute Surrender
Subjected to analysis by military of
ficers here, allied and American, terms
of the Austrian armistice which are
said to be no more drastic than those
for Germany are interpreted to mean
absolute surrender. Nothing is left to
tbe good faith of the vanquished and
no restrictions or limitations are im
posed on the victors. These officers
believe Germany, left alone, also must
throw herself without reserve on the
mercy of the victors.
Then Comes Conference
Final adjustments, territorial or oth
erwise are all deferred to the peace
conference for which cessation of hos
tilities pave the way. The German
appeal for an armistice was submitted
on the basis of acceptance of the
peace terms already outlined by Presi
dent Wilson and when the discussion
starts the allies and the United States
will be in a position to dictate its re
sults. In fact the real peace confer
ence has been sitting at Versailles.
Think Hun Crumbling
The judgment of army officers as to
the situation on western front is in a
military sense that Cermany must ac
cept armistice conditions or face a
debacle of her armies. Signs of dis
integration of the German forces fac
ing the Franco-American lines have
been evident for two days. The Ger
man official statement yesterday ad
mitted an American break through. If
tbe breach is widened tbe German
armies will be cut in half as effectual
ly as were the Austrian armies in
Italy. They then may be crushed sep
arately. So strong is tbe impression here
that Germany will accept that when
word came that a statement was to be
issued by the state department tonight
a Washington newspaper put out on
extra saying the war was over and
Germany had surrendered.' It caused
no excitement. .

Causes So Much
nCSUtlt
Many people seem to think that acid-stomach
or superacidity is of little importance; that it
merely causes some slight trouble such as belching,
heartburn, sour, gassy stomach, food-repeating,
bloat, etc.
If those same pebple would only realize the real
truth about acid-stomach and when these first
symptoms appear would at once start to rid them--selves
of the excess acid, what a crushing load of
awful suffering, misery and ill-health would be
lifted from mankind!
Do you realize that the ill effects of an acid-stomach
extend throughout the entire system and more
or less affect practically every organ and tissue of
the human body from the crown of the bead to the
soles of the feet? Well, it's a fact. For instance,
probably few people would ever think that there
could be any connection between an acid-stomach
and dandruff and falling hair; or between an acid
stomach and a gouty foot. Nevertheless there is a
direct connection.
Now you know what acid mouth does to the
teeth. The acid eats right through the hard enamel
causing them to decay. What chance, then, do you
think the delicate organization of the stomach has
against excess acid?
The excess acid Interferes with ( digestion and
assimilation. It causes food to ferment. Makes
the sour stomach and creates gases. That's what
causes those acute stomach pains of indigestion,
that miserable bloated feeling after eating, heart
burn, belching, food-repeating, etc.
Moreover, that sour mass of fermenting food
becomes a breeding place for countless millions ot
deadly germs tonic poisons they are callpd. They
are absorbed into the system, impoverish the blood,
make It thin and weak. That is why so many peo
you see are weak and emanriated; thin, bloodless
and look bad: not downright sick, but always ailing,
lacking in vitality, vim and vigor. They've lost their
punch; are listless in both their work and pleasures
they're run down and seem "all in."
Now of course the right thing to do is to get rid
of the excess acid, give the stomach a chance to
digest the food properly and Nature will do the rest.
There Is a quick and easy way to do this. A won
derful new discovery makes it possible to remove
excess acid without the slightest discomfort. It is
called EATONIC, made in the form of tablets they
are good to eat just like a bit of candy. Their
' action in the stomach is a good deal like a piece of
blotting paper taking up a drop of ink they liter
ally absorb the injurious excess acid and carry it
away through the intestines. They also drive the
bloat out of the body in fact you can fairly feel
them work.
Try EATONIC and see bow quickly it banishes
the Immediate effects of acid-stomach bloat, heart
burn, belching, food-repeating, indigestion, etc. See
too, how quickly your general health improves
how much more relish you take in eating how
much more easily your food Is digested how sound
ly you sleep how nervousness and irritability dis
appear. It is so easy to get this help and it costs so
little. So why suffer another hour when sure, quick
relief is at hand? Everywhere people who have
used EATONIC testify to its power to bring quick
relief. The testimonials of some of these people
are so enthusiastic and tell of such remarkable re
sults as to be almost unbelievable.
If you are one of those who have "tried every
thing." but in spite of It are still lacking in physical
strength and vigor, begin at once to take EATONIC.
Don't put it off. Get back your physical and mental
punch. Have the power and energy to work with
vim. Enjoy the good things of life. Learn what
It means to fairly bubble over with bealth. Uke
thousands of others, you will say that you never
dreamed it possible that such a wonderful change
for the better could be brought about so quickly.
So get a big box of EATONIC from your drug
gist today. We authorize liim to guarantee EA
TONIC to please you and you can trust your drug
gist to make this guarantee good. If it fails in any
way, take it back he will refund your money. If
your druggist does not keep EATONIC write to us
and we will send you a big 50c box. You can
send us the 50c after you receive it. Address H. J.

Term Are Forecast
Aa attempt to apply the lessons of
the Austrian armistice, to Germany's
situations bring out several points
upon which military men based their
forecast of the German terms. For one
thing, it is regarded as certain that
complete evacuation of Alsace-Lor-raino
will be insisted upon as well as
the occupation of the Rhine fortresses
by allied garrisons. Surrender of the
German submarines and a substantial
part of the high seas fleet and the
occupation of land defenses that pro
tect German naval bases also is im
plied. So far as the German army is con
cerned, it must go back into Germany
probably without the whole vast mech
anism of war which it carried into
Francs and Belgium. AH the big guns.
! tanks and aircraft under the Austrian
I precedent, w ould be concentrated and
left under the direct control of the
allia.l and American armies.
It was pointed out, however, that
since Germany is the last of the cen
tral powers, when she surrenders,
there will be no need to provide for
the employment of her military equip
ment by Marshal Foch. There will be
I no one left against whom to turn the
guns. The terms for Germany, therc
: fore, probably will show that varia-
tion from the Austrian conditions
i Foch to Apply Them
One feature of the' Austrian surren-

program of demobolization and disarmament.
Attention already is beina: given
here to the next phase after Germany

! lost sight of the fact that armistices
'are only stepping stones to theperma
1 nent settlement of all the issues of the
! war. Political questions, boundaries,
I even commercial rights and privileges
all remain to be defined.
Industry Must Start

I the allied countries is said the neces
; sity is recognized of setting in mo
'tion the whoels of peace-time industry

der to afford employment and support
I to the millions of discharged soldiers,
j This is expected to hasten the peace
i conference once the Germans surren

! armistice or protocol which stopped
the Spanish-American war was signed
on August 12, 1898, it provided in its
; terms for a meeting of the peace pleni
potentiaries in Paris before October 1,
following. The purpose was to assem

only sufficient time to elapse to carry

Must Have Understanding

after they have reached a perfect un

will lav down these terms and while
they may choose to permit the latter

FINANCIAL PANIC ON.
LONDON, Nov. 4.-The Berlin Vos
siche Zeitung, discussing the finan
cial panic in Germany, says it is of a
more stubborn character and greater
in extent than at the outbreak of the
war. The newspaper adds that in
the mouth ending October 23 the note
circulation of the imperial and loan
bank Increased 2,6.'0,0o0..000 marks.
The note circulation of the Reich ibank
has risen to 16.SdO,000,000 marks as
compared with 2.000,000.000 marks at
the commencement of the war and
the loan banks now are circulating
9.000,000,000 marks in notes'.
The newspaper says the vice-president
of the Reicbsbank asserted that
recent hoarding had attained unex

public that a continuation of hoard

Austria
Those prophets who have for the last
three years been predicting the collapse of
Austria have at last been justified. It re
quired a long time, and pressure from both
within and without to bring the dual mon
archy to her knees. Twice before she
would have fallen but for aid from Prus
sia, but when the allied drive on Austria
started a few days ago Prussia could not
send a man or a gun from her own flaming
and broken battle line and the inevitable
came to pass. While the conditions of the
surrender were not known at the time, this
little monograph is being written, and the
actual conditions of her internal affairs are
in a state of uncertainty bordering on an
archy and chaos, it is almost certain that
the house of Hapsbusg will soon pass and
that this ancient monarchy will be split up
into several independent states, or rather,
nations. No longer shall the tail of 27 per
cent German population and 16 per cent
Maygar wag the dog of 57 per cent Slavic
population of" these peoples. The most and
the worst patched empire in all the history
of the world is now dissolving before our
eyes after 700 years of power, outrage,
duplicity and oppression. The house of
Hapsburg, as old as the empire, is passing
with the monarchy. These events are
epochal; they are also beneficial to man
kind. Perfidous Austria had passed from
a by-word into a proverb centuries ago.
She lost every war she ever waged and yet
gained and held by treachery and duplicity
and marriage and deceit and promises that
were never fulfilled, the lands and peoples
that comprise her domains. The Slavic
element of the empire, comprising that 57
per cent of the dog that has always been
wagged by the tail, is composed of Czecho-
Slovaks, (Bohemians, Poles, Ruthenians,
Czechs) and the Jugo-Slavs (Serbs, Croats,
Bosnians, Slovenes, Morlaks) have been
quick to take advantage of the military de
feats and famine and economic and indus
trial ruin that dragged Austria to her doom,
and have already organized their own
states and have been recognized by the
great allied powers.-
Austria, at the command of her master,
Berlin, started the great war by making de
mands upon Serbia that amounted to serf
dom. She placed a great army in the field
and contributed at least half of the heavy
artillery to the German war cause. She
fought bravely at first, and with much spir
it. But Russia would have destroyed her
in the second year of the war but for Ger
man aid. She never recovered from the
terrible battle of Gallicia, and her collapse
has been predicted daily since that com
paign. But she came back last fall and
aided by German troops and guns and mili
tary skill and intrigue, drove the Italians
from her back door clear to the gates of
Venice, and Italy was only saved by. a
hair's breadth. But this was the last flicker
of the failing flame. Her internal affairs
went from bad to worse and strikes ,riots.
mismanagement, famine, anarchy and se
dition walked hand in hand through her
fields and cities until, when the allies struck
at last with full force under unified com
mand, she fell with scarcely the semblance
of a real struggle. She was a shell without
and rotten within clear to the core.
Austria is Teutonic and German through
and through, but lacking German thorough
ness and sturdiness in time of stress.
That the loss of this ally with her fifty
millions of people and her protection from
the east side will result in the complete and
sure defeat of Germany goes without say
ing. But the loss comes at the beginning
of winter and cannot be felt.by Germany -in
a military way direct, until the spring
campaign opens. But the surrender of Aus
tria means a short campaign in the spring
if Germany elects to fight on. An allied
arm- of at least a million, and probably
two million, will strike at Berlin, from the
Austrian borders in March. And the task
of the army on the west front will be made
much easier, for Germany will have to send
a half-million or more men there to offer
any kind of resistance, and she cannot spare
a single division.
Many well informed and conservative
allied leaders look for Germany's surrender
to follow closely upon the Austrian col
lapse, but all wise leaders and good men
and true will press on with this war just
the same until the German army either
surrenders or is destroyed.
j German Machine Gunners j
When German historians come to write
the history of the great war, let them forget
for a moment, if they can, the von who
desolated Louvain, and the von who carried
off the women of Lille, and the von who
destroyed the Rheims cathedral, and the
von who murdered Edith Cavell; let them
forget the foxy crown prince and the cruel
Ludendorff and the pompous Hindenburg
and the recalcitrant Rupprecht and all that
glittering, gorgeous ungodly lot, and give
place and praise to their real heroes of this
war the machine gunners. Some of the
Prussian guards regiments have been very
brave and have fought and died like men;
most of the Bavarian regiments have al
ways fought well, and the Brandenburgers
and certain elements of the shock troops
and the Saxons and the Nuremburgers have
often been sturdy in attack and under
fire, but the machiners have always been
the bravest of the lot. No mercy for them,
and they know it. A bayonet thrust in the
throat is their portion. They are the real
heroes of the German armies, and they
have saved these armies time and again
since the eightenth of last July, and are
saving them today.
How many of them have been killed
since then no one can know, certainly not
less than one hundred thousand, and still
the German staff is able to find myriads of
them willing to drop back behind the re
treating forces of the Hun and hold the al
lied pursuers until new positions have been
gained. Still these machine gunners die to
stave off defeat another day.
And they are sorry, shabby heroes, too,
for they often call "kamerad" and try to
surrender after having done their worst
with the stream of leaden death they .deal
out to attacking forces. But you have to
give it to them at that, for they never get a
chi r.ce to surrender, and they know it, but
still they are willing to drop back and die
as the rear guard of the retreat.
When Napoleon retreated from Moscow
he selected Marshal Ney, the bravest of the
brave, to protect his retreat with the Youn
Guard. That retreat and that backward
fight against the Russian wolves by the red
headed hero of the Napoleonic era has be- '
come immortal. But every day for the
past thirteen weeks of the great war, un
named, unknown and unsung German ma
chine gunners fight and die to save the
beaten German armies from utter disaster.
The day that the German crop of machine
gunners fails will be the day that the re
treat of the German forces will be changed
into a rout, utter and complete.
This column listened with wet eyes to
the description by Mrs. R. S. Emerich, de
partment Y. W. C. A. worker, formerly
stationed in Turkey, of the death of a lady
from Baltimore and her little child at the
hands of the Turk in Mesopotamia. "We
received with thanksgiving," declared this
earnest and eloquent lady," the word that
Turkey had formed an alliance with Ger
many. Now, we thought, these massacres
will cease. Germany is a great, Christian
nation and she will dominate and control
the unspeakable Turk. But, alas, the wild,
disordered atrocities of the Turk at worst
were mere spasms of cruelty in comparison
with the wholesale and methodical and.dia
bolical atrocities committed by these same
Turks under the direction of German offi
cers and agents. And so I call aloud to the
people of this land to make no peace with
this monster except a peace that' will burn
deep into its heart and soul."
Students of the war are agreed that aside
from the unbroken German army, the Rus
sian problem is stilll the hardest for the al
lies yet to solve. To break Germany's hold
on Russia will require drastic regulations
and requirements that pierce to the very
heart of this most intricate and difficult
condition. A mere "hands off" command
will not be enough, even though all Ger
man troops are driven from Russia. The
German banker and huckster, and propa
gandist and merchant, and lawyer and
manufacturer, have all clutched at Russian
goods and land and trade and contracts for
the past year, and, aided by the unspeak
able Lenine and Trotzky have been grant
ed every conceivable form of concession
and legal transfer of the very life blood of
the land and its trade and business and fu
ture. It must be remembered that if Ger
many can win a peace that costs her every
thing in the west and the loss of Alsace
Lorraine and withdrawal from Russia in a
military way and even the loss of her fleet
and the payment of a great indemnity, and
is able to retain a subtle and hidden and yet
none the less tenacious and strangling hold
on Russia with her illimitable cannon fod
der and natural resources, still she will
have gained more than tongue can tell from
the war. And another generation may
well have to pay dearly for any lack of
thoroughness by this one in freeing Rus
sia not only from German military domina
tion, but from any German influence or
hold whatever. When Lenine and Trotzky
are driven out or strung up the house
should be cleaned after them and then fumigated.
"Mister candidate.
He with you arly,
He with you late;
He wear the hinges
Off your gate."
But not after today. This is the day of
ballots. Important and most far reaching
issues are at stake in today's election. The
American people are now engaged in the
selection of a war congress, and probably
a peace congress at the same time. It is
not party, but men that will count in push
ing the war and gaining the right kind of
peace and spending the billions yet to be
spent by this government and solving the
great problems of peace when it comes.
We need big, strong, forceful, broad, fair
men in congress now worse than at any
time since the Continental congress held
its first session. This is an "off" year, but
at that it is more important than most '
presidential elections because of the con
gressional contests. Every voter in the land
has a personal responsibility today in select
ing congressmen. Be sure of your man;
sure of his courage, his stand on the war
and his ability to handle peace problems
for the best interests of all of the people
and with credit to. our national government.
This column cannot refrain from saying
a word here about Ray Krebs, county re
corder and secretary of the county draft
board. Ever since the draft bill was passed
Mr. Krebs has been under an intensive strain
day and night to accomplish the many and
new and laborious task attached to his of
fice. . The first draft work of the office
was nerve racking. Now it is going smooth
er and faster and easier and twice as much
is being accomplished day by day than in
the beginning. Krebs has mastered its de
tails and its, mechanism. . Alert, eager,
proud of the work, he has made a splendid
record. His value to the board at this time
is incalculable. He has had no time at all
for a campaign. , All parties and classes in
the county who have had opportunity or
occasion to observe or learn of his work
will see to it that he has a splendid majority
in today's election. '
Without the least regard for party or
fact or feud or faction or class or any of the
thing3 that tend to hamper the develop
ment, of community or state, this paper
would most earnestly urge, in the interest
solely of better schools, the re-election of
Miss Elsie Toles of the office of county
superintendent of schools. This most able
and energetic young woman has made a
fine record with the schools of the county,
and more especially with the country
schools. She drives her car constantly over
mountain range and through the valleys to
visit and encourage and aid the rural
schools. Parents of school children cannot
afford to be indifferent to the re-election of
Miss Toles. By some freak of politics or
prejudice or joke; certainly without the
sanction or endorsement of the democratic
party of the county, a candidate's name ap
pears on the general ballot against Miss
Toles, when it had been generally under
stood that she should not have any opposi
tion. While there is only a remote chance
that she will not be overwhelmingly re
elected, yet it is well to be sure. The name
of Miss Toles' opponent appears on the
ticket of the majority party, and general
carelessness on the part of the voter might
bring about her defeat. Ask any school
teacher or friend you know who is inter
ested in schools and has knowledge in the
premises about the necessity for Miss
Toles' re-election.
Good news from every battle front
comes in a tide these days. ' The shift since
the middle of last July is staggering. Three
foes knocked out and the fourth groggy
and beaten. And only four months ago
the allies were ttraining every nerve to save
themselves from disaster. The unified com
mand had as much to do with the sudden
change as any one thing. And only Foch
himself knows how much the coming of
the Americans helped; certainly not a lit
tle. Far be it from us to brag. We have
done all they asked us to do, so far, and we
are ready to do as much more as they ask.
Foch carries our money, lives and honor to
the last limit of all human life and endeavor.
In a letter from W. H. Brophy in France
the former Bisbee citizen says: "You are
doubtless hearing much of this peace talk
these days, but I hope and trust you are not
paying serious attention to it. We hear it
here from every side but I have pride in tell
ing you that no one over here who amounts
to anything is paying the least attention
to it. Too fight on and to press on and
work on, these are all we know here. We
neither believe nor trust anything German.
We are too close to them and their terrible
trail."
At last the Americans, after a month of
patient and heroic effort, have broken that
German line between the Argonne and the
Meuse and passed over that terrible terrain
that held them up so long and cost them
so dearly. The present advance of some
six miles on Stenay represents an important
a half-dozen miles as any won in the great
war. Wait and see.
Vital peace terms entirely left out of the
President's fourteen points: Unconditional
surrender. A peace dictated by the allies.
Reparation by Germany. Guarantees by
Germany. Moral punishment at least for a
criminal nation. Economic barriers against
what is made in Germany. German dis
barment from the proposed league of na
tions. If the Bolshevik get their claws on the
tattered shreds of Austria the allies may
yet have to fight before they can enter
Germany by the Austrian back door. And
as for Austria, her previous troubles will
pale into insignificance if she allows her
affairs to be seized by these gentry . It will
be out of the frying pan into the fire.
"It will take months to evacuate Bel
gium," solemnly states the German govern
ment. "Well, then," retorts the Clay Cen
ter, Kansas, Times, "don't evacuate. We
can chase you out quicker than that.'
Many startling stories come out ot uer
many these days, but are they not the tal
Yitr want lis to hfar?
Germany still has an ally more power
ful than either Bulgaria, Turkey or Aus
tria winter.

EAST IS ACTIVE.
NEW YORK, Nov. 4. Final
speeches by candidate and party
managers brought the campaign to a
close in the eastern states tonight.
Both democratic and republican lead'
ers professed confidence that the;r
candidates would win at the polls to
morrow.
The campaign which began in
apathy developed in its closing days in
most states into one of the most bit
terly contested in years. The chief is
sue has been the election of United
States senators and representatives.
The appeal of President Wilson for
the return of a democratic congress
has been the storm center' of attack
and counter attack.
Democrats and republicans were
claiming tonight they would gain seats
in congress, but indications were the
result would be close except in dis
tricts where one party or the other
normally has an overwhelming major
ity. In New York party leaders are "up
in the air" because women will vote
for the first time there is no way of
knowing how they will divide political
ly. The republican state chairman
predicted Governor Whitman would
be elected by at least 200.000 but dem
ocrats were equally insistent Alfreu
E. Smith, president of the New York
City board of aldermen, would be the
victor, although they did not claim
victory by so large a margin.
CAMPAIGN IS INTENSE
CHICAGO, Nov. 4. Voters of the
middle western states were bombard
ed with final arguments tonight as a
climax to the short but intensive cam
paigns which have been waged by
candidates for state and federal of
fices which will be decided at the
polls tomorrow.
In the senatorial contests interest
generally centered in the Ford-Newberry
contest in Michigan; the McCor-mick-Lewis
race in Illinois, the at
tempt of Governor Capper to supplant
Senator Thompson in the Kansas
seat; the race between former Gover
nor Folk and Judge S. P. Spencer in
Missouri, and the Kenyon-Keyes strug
gle in Iowa. Senators Robinson of
Arkansas and Nelson of Minnesota are
without major party opposition for re
election and the re-election of Senator
Shepbard of Texas was practically
conceded. In addition to these there
have been contests in Kentucky,
where Gcf.ernor Stanley is opposed
by B. L. Burner; in Nebraska between
Senator Norris and ex-Governor More
head; in Oklahoma between Senator
Owen and W. B. Johnson and in South
Dakota between Senator Sterling and
O. V. Rinehart.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4. "Night
before election" rallies were notice
ably absent in most of the 11 western
states tonight and final newspaper ad
ve.-tisenients today and those to be
published to.norrow wound up one of
the strangest political campaigns of
history.
Spanish influenza .traveling west
ward irom its hotbed in New England,
swept the west as the campaigns were
being cpentd. A few preliminary
speaking trips were made by some in
dustrious candidates but many of
thcin did not make a platform speech.
Lack of "issues" also quieted the usual
"congressional year turmoil" until the
president's appeal for a democratic
congress put spirit Into the partisan
fights in soiue districts where there
was a good chance of successful con
test. Nine I niied States seuators were to
be elected tomorrow in Colorado,
Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Oregon and Wyoming. Thirty-three
representatives were to be chosen in
these seven states and Arizona, Cali
fornia. Utah and W ashington. Dele
gates were to be named from the two
western territories, Alaska and Ha
waii.
Women played a large part in the
campaign, in all Dut rew Mexico uu
Utah they were contenders for import
ant offices. Two, representative Jean
ette Rankin of Montana and Miss Ann
Martin of Nevada, were candidates for
United States senator.
All western states, except Montana,
Utah and Washington were to elect
governors and full state tickets.
Most of the states had on tneir Dai-
lots various executive measures. ive
states, Washington, Utah and Colo
rado, already dry, and California and
Wyoming had wet and dry measures
at stake.

ALBUQUERQUE. N. M., Nov. 4.
Tomorrow's election promises to be
the most exciting contest ever held in
this state. President Wilson's mes
sage of October 28, criticizing Senator
Fall, republican incumbent, has
kicked back and it Is generally be
lieved that many voters will flock to
Fall who would otherwise have voted
for W. B. Walton, his democratic op
ponent. Mr. Wilson's message has also in

opinion is Jhat he will win over B. C.

BELGIAN OFFICIAL.

HAVRE, Nov. 4. The official com

of the canal.

SIX
Polling Places In District;
Candidates, Amendments
To Be Voted For Today
Fifty-one candidates, exclusive of
the socialists are positiva of their
election today with majorities rang
ing from 50 to 5000, and 20 candidates
are going to be disappointed wr.en the
ballots are counted and the certifi
cates of election are issued. The race
lias been warm at times, but for the
most part a decided lack of enthusi
asm has been shown throughout the
state. The gubernatorial race is no
nearer a solution than at the opening
of the campaign; both Campbell and
Colter are making prediction as to
their probable majorities. The bet
ting in the Warren district has been
nil; few bets are posted and no big
money in sight. Phoenix seems to be
an even money proposition, with the
governors holding the spotlight.
The Cochise county race looks dem
ocratic to the "political dopesters,"
with a fighting chance for one, and
possibly three republican candidates.
Leaders of both parties are doubtful
of the large democrat majorities
that have been polled In former con
tests. Maricopa county seems to be

tain number of fighting men. Of this
number about half must be skilled me

along mechanical lines. '.The remain
ing half need not be mechanics but

Any men between the ages of 18 and

They must qualify under severe tests
of the interchangeable duties of tank
driver, machine gunner, rapid fire
gunner, and in certain instances tank

In response to an urgent request from the Government, last
April, we cheerfully turned over the entire output of "BULL"
DURHAM Tobacco for the exclusive use of our Soldiers and Sailors,
It was realized that, while this arrangement would meet with
the most generous approval of a multitude cf civilian users, it would
at the same time mean an irreparable loss to them, accustomed as
they were to "rolling their own" with good old "Bull."
Despite the heavier and heavier demand of ever -increasing
forces at the front, the production of " BULL" DURHAM Tobacco
has been more than ample. The future needs of our fighting men
have been anticipated. This happy condition has been attained by
a tremendous increase in manufacturing facilities, effected at a pro
portionate cost.
.Owing to this enormously increased output, a limite4 surplus of
" BULL" DURHAM is available today for those civilians who so
keenly felt the loss of their "makings," but who so whole-heartedly
gave up their "Bull" in compliance with the Government's wishes.
So that now, with truer and greater pleasure than ever, you
will, we are confident, with your own hands, roll a cigarette again
for yourself a cigarette machines can't imitate the mjldest, the
mosr fragrant, the mosr economical cigarette in the world.

apprf hension of soldiers without leave
and in desertion.
To that end commanding officers of
all departments of the United States
army have been directed by P. C. Har
ris, adjutant general of the war de
partment, to notify the state councils
of all desertions, giving the full name,
rank and organization of the soldier;
the toldier's home address; status of
soldier i. e. absent without leave or
absent in desertion.
It is believed that by co-operation
with the state councils, which have
branches in all counties in the state,
the apprehension of deserters will be
much facilitated.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Nov. 4. Peace stocks
had their inning aain today, invest
ment shares of various classes scor-
iiig substantial gains on Austria's
capitulation and publication of the
allies' terms to that country.
Rails, shippings and motors, with
occasional outbursts of activity in the
oil group, were the dominant features.
Trading was characterized by mod
erate dealings, but an almost steady
advance, save in the last hour, when
realizing for profits over tomorrow's
holiday caused slight setbacks.
Gains among rails of the investment
division ranged from 1 to 214 points,
the Karriman and Hill groups denot
ing absorption of an Impressive char
acter. Popular grangers, coalers and
moderate priced issues of the western
and southwestern sections were not
far behind.
Oils manifested much of their, re
cant activity and uncertainty, gains
of 3 to 7 points in Mexican Petroleum,
Royal Dutch, Texas company and Pan
American Petroleum giving way to
Irregular impairment at the close.
Sales amounted to 635,000 share3.
Bonds were strong on tne largest
turnover in many months, to which
the new Liberty 4 'is Contributed by
sales of numerous blocks, all at 98.
Railway bonds were 1 to 2 per cent
higher and internationals, especially
French municipals, made noteworthy
gains. Total sales, par value, aggre
gated $17,800,000. Old United States
bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN 'MARKET. '
CHICAGO, Nov. 44 Lesire thit
trades be evened up for the election
holiday rallied the corn market today
from declines brought about by the
signing of the armistice with Austria
Prices closed firm, at the same as
Saturday's finish to c higher, with
December 113 to 1134 and January
1UVA to 1144. Oats finished un
chanted to 1H up and provisions
varying from 10 oft to 5c advance.
Pears in corn had? a decided advan
tage until tiie last half hour, as prior
to- that juncture timidity on the part
tf the buyers seemed to have been
much emphasized owing to the fact
that all fighting ,'aouth of the Alps
and the Danube was at an end, and
that huge additional forces had thus
been set free to attack Germany on
other sides tnan the western front.
Selling, although not at first aggres
sive, broadened out quickly when the
market reacted from initial weakness
Liberal receipts, including increased
arrivals of new grain, added to the
handicap on the bulls. In the final
trading, however, the wish to curtail
open risks during the election ad
journment nullified temporarily every
other factor and forced the market up.
Oats showed independent strength
of a result of the government buy
ing. firmness of the hog market
steadied provisions.

CANDIDATE FOR
STATE TREASURER
EC MALLEY, MAKING CAMPAIGN
IN NEVADA FOR HIGH OFFIC7;
WAS FORMERLY EMPLOYED
HERE; BROTHER AT DON LUIS
The many friends of Ed Malley,
brother of James Malley of Don Luis,
will be pleased to learn that he is
making good and is now a candidate
i for state treasurer in Nevada. He
J worked in the mines here for a num
ber of years." The following taken
from a recent issue of the Tonapah
New3 will be interesting reading to
his many friends in the district:
"Ed Malley, candidate for state
treasurer, left Tonapah this morning
for Ely. He is traveling in his own
car and expects to make the distance
in ten hurs which would come close
to esiauusuiii a reiuiu in spuo ui uc
fact that the driver has but one arm
to handle the machine. "Ed is bet
ter known in Nye county than any
where else since he" served here in
various capacities from chief otf po
liec to sheriff and then sprang into
state-wide popularity as a candidate
for state treasurer. His success in
the campaign broadened bis ac
quaintance und gave the state an
executive whose ability expands with
opportunity and whose honesty and
integrity is emphasized by the im
mensity of the trust reposed by the
voters of Nevada in committing to
his care the millions of public funds
carried constantly by the state. In
Nye county Ed Malley is the special
idcl of the younger element which
has grown into maturity since Ed
began holding office. These were
boys and girls years ago whose
first admiration was elicited by com
ing in contact with the state treas
urer in local affairs and for whom
most of them will cast their vote
at this election. Ed Malley has been
identified with organized labor all
his life, having sprung from the
Icins of industry and qualified by
years of efficient and patriotic serv
ice for higher honors."
