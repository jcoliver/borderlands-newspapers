One million dollars for road and
highway work in Cochise county dur
ing the next year, the entire sum to
be raised by direct taxation, is the
plan or the board of supervisors,
completed yesterday following two
days of conference with taxpayers and
others in the "Warren district. Plans
have been launched and a bill which
would amend the state law to permit
raising this sum has oeen forwarded
to the state legislature. . Meantime,
members cf the board and the county
engineer are making a partial survey
of the county's roads preparatory to
starting work.
Announcement of the gigantic taxa
tion proposition for highway work was
made yesterday morning by Charles
W. Roberts, member of tne board from
Willcox. and ICE Adams, chairman
of the board, of Bis bee. Both mem
bers declared they will be in Phoenix
next week to champion their measure,
and they expect J. 31. Sparks, the
other member of the board, to join
them at that time. Later they antici
pate Mr. Sparks" presence on a further
inspection of the county's roads. The
Douglas member is at present absent
from the .state and could not return
for the conference of yesterday and
the trip which began yesterday.
Taxpayers Co-operate
The plan of the supervisors has
been carefully worked out and co-op-
eration of the large taxpayers of the
county has been secured, according to
Mr. Roberts, who announced the pro-
gram. It is anticipated that results
be immediate and that within six

it will be necessary to have passed byj
the legislature special legislation to
permit counties to increase their tax
levy over the 10 per cent increase at
present permitted by law. Last year
only 9200,000 was raised In the county
for road purposes, and to raise a mil-
lion this year the tax levy will have
to be increased 500 per cent. This
wCl be accomplished. Mr. Roberts be
lieves, through the bill which he has
prepared and which is now on its way
to Phoenix. Taxation in the. county
for roads under the proposed budget
will be approximately five mills on the
dollar valuation.
The iIan3 of the board are to afford
monevs and work for employment of

Shooting Occurs During Ses

Guards Diet BuiMing
MUNICH. Feb. ; 21. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) Herr Auer, Ba varan
minister of the interior, has been shot.
The shoting took place during a
session of the Landtag while Auer was
alluding to the assassination of Kurt
Eisner, the Bavarian premier.
Auer fell wounded in the left side
and Deputy Osel was killed and two
other officials were seriously wounded.
The shots were fired from the pub
lic gallery and caused a panic among
the deputies.
The diet building now -is being
guarded by the military.
Herr Auer was a member of the
majority socialist party. He first came-:
to prominence last November at the '
ume of the revolt in Bavaria, taking j
the portfolio Nof miniser of the Inte
rior m the new cabinet.
The following month, when the pe- j
riod of unrest in Munich became grave,'
Auer was compelled to resign, at the 1
points of revolvers of revolutionists,
kuo visited his home at night.
A short time afterward the minis-
eriI council of the people of Bavaria .
expressed its anger ever the forcing
. xv e. to relinquish his position and'
declared that his resignation "natur-

a member of the government." The
uocan.ent was s!snVi by Kurt Eirner,

L&sl uexeiuuer 17 prominent men,
including one non-Bavarian duke, were

Ariaiioff, Alleged Murderer,
Fighting Extradition Wri t
EL PASO, Tex., Feb. 21. M. Artenoff, arrested here
at the request of the authorities of Bisbee, today announced
his intention of fighting extradition. Artenoff is held on a
fugitive warrant, alleging murder in connection with the
death of his wife, which is said to have occurred on Febru
ary 7, on Artenoff 's farm at Stark. A petition for a writ
of habeas corpus, filed on behalf of Artenoff, was heard
in the district court this afternoon, with the result that the
prisoner was remanded to the custody of the sheriff.
Local authorities, when interviewed by representa
tives of The Review, stated that upon receipt of advices
from the El Paso authorities of M. Artenoff s intention to
fight extradition and obtain his release upon a writ of
habeas corpus yesterday, that Governor Campbell was so
advised, and is preparing extradition papers, which will be
sent immedately to Governor Hobby of Texas.
These papers should reach the Texas governor at Aus
tin, the state capital, some time Monday and immediate
action is expected, and if the extradition request is granted,
Artenoff will be immediately turned over to th Lowell au
thorities. M. Artenoff will then have to answer to the triple
-harems f defaulting, issuance of worthless cherks and
erand larceny.
The more serious charge of murder may be preferred
n tatr date, if the present search for traces of the bodv of
Artpnoff's wife, who mysteriously disappeared several
weeks ago, brings forth any clues.
Deputy sheriffs from Lowell Thursday visited Arten
off 's ranch at Stark, where the murder is supposed to have
occurred and though only a preliminary search was madt
and from which no clues were produced, a systematic and
thorough serxch by digging in various localities may develop
the sought for clues.
The authorities are of the opinion, in view of Arten
off s determined fight to prevent extradition, that the mur
der theory may prove to be a fact and are redoubling their
efforts to have him brought back to Lowell for investigation
and trial. -

OUTLINE RED CROSS
PLANS FOR WORLD
WELFARE AT
CPy Reriew leased Wire)
PARIS, Feb. 21. Jlembers of peace
delegations of all powers interested in
the proposed league of nations, and
ambassadors and ministers from vari
ous countries, together with several
hundred newspaper representatives
from allied and neutral countries, at
a dinner tonight heard H. P. David
son, of the American Red Cross, out
line international Red Cross plans for
world welfare. He has been named
chairman of a committee of Red Cross
societies representing the organiza
tions' in the United States, Great Brit
ain, Italy. France and Japan, to form
ul?e ard propose to Red cross socie
ties of the world a program of extend
ed Red Cross activities in. interest of
humanity."
Mr. Davison read a wireless from
President Wilson as follows:
"I sincerely regret I am not in Paris
to join in expressing support and ap
proval of the plans announced for co
ordinating and extending efforts of the
Red Cross societies of the world. I
have been familiar with these plans
from their inception. They contain
possibilities for lessening and prevent
ing distress among all people.
"This would be enough to justify
utmost effort, but there Is a further
promise that joint efforts of the Red
Cross societies acting In concert will
hasten and broaden the spreading ot
feeling among all peoples. For these
two reasons I am heartily in accord
with the step now to be taken, to
bring together, through Red Cross so
cieties of the world, all those forces
which in thi3 way can be directed to
ward lessening the sufferings and bur
dens of humanity wherever and in
whatever form they may exist. I sin
cerely trust that plans now to be an
nounced may have the special and ac
tive assistance of all governments and
all peoples before whom they may be
brought,"
A memorandum distributed among
guests told of what the combined
Red Cross societies of the five powers
proposed to do.
"What Is peace?" Mr. Davidson
said, "I am one of those who believe
99 per cent of the people of this
world are not interested in the pri
marily In questions of boundary, in
questions of economic or financial
treaties. In questions of government
and international relations. Peace to
them means peace of mind and peace
of body. They desire to live a normal
life and to be permitted to carry on
their vocations without unlawful or
unreasonable Interference."
Mr. Davidson alluded to work of all
Red Cross societies and the countries
represented in them, including Amer
ica with its 47,000,000 contributors.
He continued:
"As soon as the armistice - .was
signed, we, who were Informed con
cerning the crying needs cf the world. J
felt an impelling obligation to fef to-!
gether for the purpose of finding a '
way of contributing to the world the
benefit of our experience with the
purpose of co-ordinating efforts of all
Red Cross societies of the world in the
interest of mankind. It seemed to U3.
that with a lea?ue of nations based
upon high Ideals, there should also
.come a league of Red Cross societies
of nations and that there should be
developed in every country an active
Red Cross society for the purpose of
doing everything possible to endeavor,
not only to cure disease, but so far as
practicable to cleanse the world and
prevent disease and suffering.

ty tankers and government officials
-Pearing before the federal trade
commission today, to be a prime
cause in social unrest. The commis
sion was holding hearings to deter
mine whether it has power to stop
such operations.
Charles S. Hamlin of the federal

although reports coming to its atten
tion showed a revival of "fake secur

"The earmark ot the stock swindler

"We have investigated 130 national

said that the "marvelous facility for

N. E. A. Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON, D. C.
The treasury department has pre
pared and adopted an official emblem
to-stimulate the sale of 1919 war sav
ings and thrift stamps.
It bears the likeness of Benjamin
Franklin, whose picture also adorns
the new savings stamps, and an appro
priate thrift proverb encircling the
portrait. These thrift mottoes, taken
from the sayings of Franklin, will be
changed from time to time during the
campaign.
The campaign for the sale of $2,000,
000,000 worth of stamps during the
year 13 now in full swing, and reports
so far received by Harold Braddocx,
the new national director of the war
savings movement, indicate that, de
spite some misunderstandings due to
the change in design of the ?5 stamps,
the public is buying the new stamps
freely.
Secretary Glass urges for the W. S.

toward paying the country's after-the-war
bills.
"The -war is not over," he says, "so

The Powerful Minority
Forty per cent of the population of the world has written the consti
tution which, if enacted, will dictate and govern the ethics of the world.
For once, government will be controlled by the minority.
The combined populations of .the United States, the British Empire,
France. Italy and Japan, constituting the League of Nations at the begin
ning, is 40 per cent of the world's population.
Latest statistics place the population of the world at 1.671,000,000.
The population of the nations included in the first draft of the
League, including the Eritieh colonies and those of the United States and
the dependencies of other nations, is approximately 700,000.000.
Twenty-two per cent of the population of the world has written this
document to establish world etiquette, if India is omitted. In this case
the population of the league would be 366,300,000 persons.
The scale balance, however, for the minority becomes the majority
when other than population figures are examined.
The force of the minority is greater xhzn the force of the majority.
The brains of the minority out-weigh the rest of the world.
And in wealth, the minority could purchase the remainder of the
world seTeral times over.
Herein are the guarantees of the world's twenty-six commandments,
the assurances of self-determination and integrity to all nations.
For the minority is greater than the majority and all-powerful.
The Unprotected Emptor -
Secretary Carter Glass desires a national Blue Sky Law. There is
much to be said for it; something, perhaps, to be said for the law maxim.
"Let the buyer look out!" A people who never got a chance to cut their
eyeteeth might in time lose the instinct of vigilance. The World.
The World holds it is none of its business, except absolute fraud is
established, how often readers are tricked. The fool is destined to be
separated from his money, and it makes little difference who gets it. So
the banner of caveat emptor is raised and Secretary Glass is sneered at
for his sympathy with Blue Sky legislation.
But as Colonel Roosevelt declared many years ago, it is necessary
for society to shackle cunning as it has shackled force. The policeman is
specially charged with the duty of corporeal protection, but the citizen
when he traveled with lantern and private guards was supposed to better
care for himself. We have advanced so far as to post the plainclothes
man aryi step the hand of the pocket picker, though it may dull, per
haps, personal vigilance. But to some degree the opinion still prevails
that it serves the filched right if he succumbs to the allurement of the
promoter who dangles his bait in advertising columns. When the vic
tim complains, when be says it is too much to expect an average man to
analyze accurately complicated financial statements or to know at &
glance when the report of an engineer is honest, he is ha-ha-ed at as one
of uncut eyeteeth and long and fuzzy ears.
The Liberty bond sales familiarized a vast number of persons with
the idea that bits of paper may have value. Thus a way is opened to
other sales of bits of paper, and the get-rich-quickers are marching out
to a harvest. All sorts of schemes are afoot to induce holders of 4U per
cent government securities to convert their holdings into investments
promising to pay better. Unwary small investors, who find their fixed
incomes reduced through high commodity prices are being cajoled to look
for larger returns. Never wa need of a national Blue Sky Law as great
as now. For the benefit not only of the gullible, but for the preservation
of a confidence that legitimate promoters are vitally interested in main
taining, public authority should suppress fraud at its source. New York
Tribune.
Civil Service in Arizona
Good luck to Mr. Hughes' civil service bilL May it live long and
prosper. We are not strong fcfr measures creating new commissions, but
a. civil service commission, if composed of the right kind of men, w-ould
save to the state some hundreds of thousands of dollars within a very
short time. The state would not only save this money. The? effect would
be more far-reaching. It would contribute to greater efficiency in the
state offices and institutions, and, more than that, it would result in the
election of a better class of officials.
Many candidates for office are" bedeviled throughout their campaigns
by applicants, either in behalf- of themselves or their friends, for ap
pointive places. If the candidate yields to these importunities, that is
proof that he is an unlit man. and if he does not yield, the influence
b: ought against him may be so strong as to defeat .him.
Such a law as this is proposed to be, would make almost impossible
the building up of an impregnable political machine in such a state as
Arizona. There would not be enough parts of it to make it strong. As it
is now. with the many hundreds of clerks and other appointees in the
state house, and the various offices and institutions, there is created a
Praetorian Band, composed of not only the hundreds of appointees, but
there are thousands of relatives scattered throughout the state, all lined
up for the party in power.
Under the civil service plan, an nnhealthful influence would be with
drawn from candidates. And as a result of carrying out pre-election
pledges, the public offices would not be clogged with clerks stumbling
over one another. Only competent employes would get into the service.
The public business would be more promptly and surely transacted, and
there would be an absence of the confusion which prevails in many of
the offices.
One way to take offices out of politics is to destroy as much as pos
sible selfish interest in them. Much of the popular selfish interest in the
offices would pass with the enactment of this bill. Arizona Republican.
Newspaper Organization
Tucson, through the chamber of commerce, has invited the daily
newspapers of Arizona to be present in the city March 3. for the pur
pose of forming the Arizona Daily Newspaper association, Tucson
newspapers have taken the initiative in calling the meeting, and the
chamber is assisting and providing the entertainment. -
Organization of the newspaper men of this state has been a movement
long on foot and much needed by the papers themselves. An under
standing of the state's vital problems, a more thorough acquaintance with
various fields and districts, a more comprehensive working program
among the papers for the benefit of the state, will result from such an
organization- And editors, becoming acquainted with each other and each
other's peculiar needs and conditions, will be in better position to give the
reading public the kind of news they want
Other stages have such an organization and benefit from it. Why not
Arizona?
Real Consistency
To be consistent, the government ought to supply each of those six
thousand aliens it intends to deport with, a new suit and 500 or $50.

Said by Washington:
Tobe prepared for war is one of the most effectual means of preserv
ing peace.
Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence the jealousy of a free
eople ought to be constantly awake.
The name America must always exalt the just pride of Patriotism.
Give such encouragements to our own navigation as will render our
commerce less dependit on foreign bottoms.
Any attempt to alienate any portion of our count iy from the rest
should be indignantly frowned upon.
The very idea cf the power and right of the people to establish gov
ernment presupposes the duty on every individual to obey the established
government.
To the efficacy and permanency of yo'ir union, a government for the
whole Is indispensable.

answered: "A year or so ago my wife
came into the store and said she was
going to take a blood medicine. .She
looked over the kinds I had on the
shelf and I reckon you put up the
best 'spiel. as she took a bottle ot
Number 40. After taking it awhile
she gave it to our boy and one day I
was complaining of that tired feeling'
and she said. 'Here. I will dose you on
