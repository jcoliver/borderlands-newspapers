HO PEACE THIS YEAR,
SAYS GERMANY; ALLIES
MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE
Foreign Minister Zimmerman Says for Germany to Press
Further for Peace Now Would Be Sign of Weakness, in
Face of Pretentious Program Outlined by Allies for the
, Crushing of Germany.
LET THE WORLD SEE BY CONTRAST THE
ALLIES STAND AGAINST PEACE, HE SAYS
Only When the Entente's Giant Offensive Fails This Year, He
Thinks, May President Wilson Renew His Efforts, Thus
Far Met by Insults Only To Seek Peace Now Would Be
to Delay It Indefinitely, He Declares.
(By Review leased Wire.)
BERLIN, Jan. 14. (Wireless to
the Associated Press). Dr. Al
fred Zimmerman, the German
foreign minister, informed the
Associated Press today that In
his opinion, the entente reply to
President Wilson's peace note
bars the possibility for the pres
ent of further German steps to
bring about peace. In particu
lar, he said, it precluded any di
rect announcement by Germany
of her conditions. In answer to
the terms set forth in the latest
entente note.
Dr. Zimmermann asserted, how
ever, that the answer or the entente
to the President did not finally and
completely close the door to later ef
forts for peace before one side or
the other was completely crushed.
Allies Bar Peace
The foreign minister, in the course
of a conversation with the Associated
Press correspondent, last night, de
clared although with obvious reluc
tance, that it was impossible for him
to give a more definite statement of
the peace program of the central pow
ers than that indicated in the declara
tions of Dr. von Bethmann-Hollweg.
the chancellor, because the German
terms were such that the unsolicited
promulgation of them in their moder
ate details, after what he character
ized as the aspiring aim of conquest
and dismemberment outlined by the
entente, would be interpreted by the
entente as a sign of weakness and of
a desire for peace at any cost.
Terms Would Not Help
Publication of the peace terms of
the central powers therefore would
defeat its ' every purpose, said Dr.
Zimmenmann. The foreign minister
expressed doubt whether after what
he described as the rebuff to Presi
dent Wilson's peace efforts given in
the reply of the entente, the Presi
dent could take any further action for
the present, adding that the entente
answer excluded for the present any
possibility of peace:
When Entente Fails
"Expressing a profound conviction
that the problem of the entente pow
ers never could be carried into effect,
Dr. Zimmermann intimated that a
failure of the entente's offensive this
year, which he expected, might again
make it possible to approach the sub
ject of peace on reasonable terms and
with some prospect of success.
"The entente powers gave out for
themselves a big program," said Dr.
Zimmermann, commenting on the note
to President Wilson. "What more is
there for Germany to say regarding
it?"
"Now that the allies have to a cer
tain extent outlined their plans," said
the correspondent "do you think there
is any possibility of Germany declar
ing in some form or other its pro
gram for a peace settlement?"
Can Do no More
"No," the minister replied, after an
Instant's reflection. "I think we can
do nothing more. We cannot afford
to give the impression that we are
chasing after peace at all costs. After
the entente allies have put out this
highly ambitious program, an an
nouncement of the firm and moderate
terms of German peace would by con
trast probably be interpreted by our
adversaries as an indication of weak
ness and would be used by them to en
courage their people to fight on. Our
people would not understand any fur
ther effort by us for the introduction
of peace by the entente's program.
We have to consider public opinion
here."
Contrasts Terms
Dr. Zimmermann said be rould ob
viously see the advantages from one
point of view in declaring Germany's
terms and letting the world see by
contrast with those to which to the
entente powers have commited them

The admiral was stricken last
Thursday as he was leaving home
for the navy department, where
as president of the general board
he has been at 7iis desk almost
daily during the past sixteen of
his 62 years of service in the navy.
He collapsed and had to be carried
to his bed. When physicians were
caleld they were alarmed, but
knowing the admiral's great re
cuperative powers and his keen
aversion to any suggestion of his
failing,, they determined to make
no immediate announcement re
garding his illness. Inquirers be

But the great strength of the
aged officer had been sapped, and
there was no recuperation. This
morning his condition has become
so serious that it was decided to
state the facts to the public. Later
it became known that Admiral
Dewey had a severe illness more
than a year ago about which only
his physicians and intimates knew
and that he never had been the
same physically Since.
Mrs. Dewey and the admiral's
son, George, Jr., are with him and
have been told that the end is

Peculiar Act of German Com-
mander Toward All Neutral
Representatives Causes U.
S. to Inquire.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 Inquiry
was addressed to Germany today by
the state department as to the truth
of reports that German authorities
had asked all neutral diplomats to
leave Bucharest, Rumania, and had
provided for that purpose a special
train. Official information is desired
so American Minister Vopicka can
be authorized to depart if necessary.
No instructions have been sent him
since he was ordered at the time of
the fall of Bucharest to stay in Ru
mania. Officials are at a loss to under
stand why the German government
should wish to send the whole neutral
diplomat corps out of the captured
Rumanian capital though it is admit
ted that she has the legal right to
do so.
A minister is accredited to a gov
ernment and not to a place, but of
ficials believe that some representa
tive of neutral government must re
main in Bucharest, not only to repre
sent their own interests, but also to
represent those of the allied govern
ments who have turned over their af
fairs in Rumani to them.
Diplomacy offers little precedent for
such a request as Germany's despite
its legal justification. In the case of
Belgium, it is recalled, Germany did
not ask for withdrawal of Brand
Whitlock, the American minister after
the Belgian government had with
drawn to Havre, France, but contin
ued to recognize him in a semi-official
way. It was expected that much

Big Business Men Are Sub

(Bv Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. Thomas
W. Lawson, haled before the House
rules committee to tell what he knows
of or had heard about a stock .market
leak on President Wilson's peace note I
was none other than Representative
Henry, chairman of the committee.!
Then before his hearers had time to-i
recover from the shock, Lawson sprung i
one sensation after another by declar-,
ing that the cabinet officer referred
to was Secretary McAdoo;. that the
banker was H. Pliny Fisk, of New
' York, and that he knew the senator
only by the initial "O".
BERNSTORFF PROFITS.
To complete the sensation Lawson
went on to charge that Paul M. War
burg, of the federal reserve board, had
knowledge of the leak machinery;' re
peated a rumor that Count von Bern-
storff, the German ambassador, had
made two millions in the stock market, t
and mentioned a list of well known I
wen whom he thought should be ques-'
tioned. The committee promptly is-
sued subpoenas for all of them.
Tumulty Besmirched.
Mr. Lawson said iie had been told '
that Malcolm McAdoo, the secretary's
brother, knew of the leak, as did C.
D. Barney and Company and Stewart
G. Gibboney, of New Y'ork. A Mrs.
Ruth Thomason Viscount, of this city,
he said, had declared to him in the
presence of her attorney that Secre
tary Tumulty "received his bit." and
that W. W. Pierce, one of the White
House correspondents, was "the go
tween for Tumulty and other." Pliny
Fisk, Lawson said, was the banket he
referred to previously as dominating
a cabinet officer, and Archibald S.
White, he said, had given this informa
tion. Henry Was -Talkative.
Representative Henry was said by
Lawson to have told him at the con
ference that preceded the opening of
the leak investigation of reports con
necting the cabinet officer, banker and
senator, and also had told him of re
ports that Secretary Lansing had been
seen conferring with Bernard Baruch,
the Wall Street operator, said to have
made a clean up On the falling market
which accompanied the peace note.
Tried to Supress Him.
Lawson declared Henry had asked
him on patriotic grounds not to press
his charges. At no time the Boston
financier testified he had direct in
formation. Henry Denies It All.
When Lawson had finished his re
cital. Chairman Henry took the stand j
and swore that at no time had he
mentioned to Lawson the name the '
financier brought out on the witness
stand; that he had no information;
then and none now of his own know
ledge; and denied generally and com
pletely all of Lawson's testimony re
lating him.
Lawson Stands Pat.
When he had concluded. Lawson
rose and solemnly declared that every
word he had uttered on the stand was
the "truth, so help me God. without

To hack it up. Lawson said that
immediately after leaving Henry at

)
Denies Every Charge About
Leak Says It Is Effort of
Wall Street to Hurt the
Administration.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 15. Secretary
McAdoo issued a statement late to
day saying "no more shameless and .
wanton lie could be conceived" than
the rumor that he had been "inter-'
ested at any time and in any man-.
ner with the stock speculation or had '
been connected in any manner with a
leak." . .
Secretary Tumulty gave out this
statement:
"After the complete and . definite
statement which I made to the rules
committee last week It should hardly
be necessary for me to. say that there
is not a scintilla of truth in these
new flimsy charges."
Secretary McAdoo said:
"No man should be called upon to
notice such detestable and irrespon-
sible gossip and slander, but since my
name has been mentioned I wish to
say that no more shameless and wan -
ton lie could be conceived than the ru -
mor or suggestion that I have been
interested at any time or in any man
ner with stock speculations or pur
chases of stock in New Y'ork or else
where, or that I have been connected
in any manner whatever with the al
leged leak about the so-called peace
note.
"The putrid partisan politicians and
the putrid stock gamblers in New
York and Boston are giving the coun
try a painful exhibition of the con
temptible methods to which they re
sort in their efforts to Injure the ad
ministration. "If any man in or out of congress
will assume responsibility for these
slanders or if I ran secure legal
proof of the guilt of such a man I
will have him put in the penitentiary
where he belongs. It is time that an
example be made of the person who
started whispered and baseless insin
uations against men in public life."

The case for determining the right

PHOENIX. Jan. 15. The legisla
ture at the beeinnine of the second

point at which the approval or dis -
approval of legislation would become
essential. It was stated bv President

The question of salaries of mem

Today's sensational proceedings dis
posed of the elaborate preparations for
holding Law son in contempt of the
House for defiance of tue committee
at the previous hearing.
A great crowd was packed into the
ro'jin when Lawson arrived. Police
cleared an entrance for him
With a set of fourteen questions be
fore him, prepared by Representative
Lenroot, Chairman Henry began to
question Lawson. When he had com
pleted his first question, demanding
the names of the congressman who'
LawiMn said told him of a cabinet of
ficer, a member of Congress and a
banker reported to have been con
nected with the leak, and also their
names, Lawson rose and said be de
sired to make a statement.
"I a:n going to answer your ques
tions," he began significantly.
The crowd, which up to that time
had visions of Lawson being placed in
ihe custody f an officer in contempt
charges, settled back with an abvious
temporary loss of interest.
Lawson Reticent.
Lawson insisted that he first be
permitted to make a statement setting
forth that it was against his wishes to
give the names in public. Chairman
Henry insisted, however, that Lawson
should answer the questions put to
him and he said he would later be
iven an opportunity to make any
tatement he desired.
Despite the decisAm of the chairman,
Lawson insisted on making a state
ment and pleading for an opportunity
.irst to present his information in se
cret. Would Shield Names.
"May I not have just a word?" he
asked in pleading tones. "I will be

ie you owe it to nie tj allow me to

ly necessary. I em going to answer
our questions, if lorced to, but l

"I suted before that my reasons for
efusing to give the information 1 had
va.i that publication of names might
ead to the destruction of evidence aud

onvinced me that the matter was
ocrious to th nation and the ad

"But I did give one name to Cpeak

president of the Guaranty Trust com
pany of New York.
Mr. Sabin came before you and was
allowed to go away without giving
any information or showing his L'ooks.
Mr. Sabin has left the country and
his evidence is gone.
"1 am willing to give all the names,
but I appeal to the committee to take
all my answers in confidence. Then
if the committee deems it necessary
that I shall make them public, I will
repeat them in public. I don't want
10 quibble and I don't want to refuse."
Here the committeemen held a brief
whispered conversation and Chairman
ilenry am.'junced that the witness
snould answer the questions publicly.
Names Henry.
Lawson looked at the committee
sternly, squared himself in his chair
and said in a voice scarcely audible:
"Chairman Henry ol your committee
is the congressman who gave me the
names."
'1 he room hummed v ith excitement,
i! embers of the committee, although
they had heard rumors that Lawson
Mignt t'jnncct Henry's name with his
charges, shifted in their chairs. Law
son, silent and grae, looked straight
ahead at the chairman. Mr. Henry.
v. iiliout a sign ol perturbation, waited
a moment lor the buzzing to subside,
and then deliberately proceeded to
read the next question formulated by
the committee.
It was merely an elaboration of the
urst, put in slightly dillerent language
ivleiring to Hie tact that it made no
difference whether the itii'jriiiation
cauie nun as "luinor or gossip," anu
Lrougni a reiteration lrom Lawson
mat KcpresPiitative Henry had given
him the information in Henry's office
in the capitol on January 2.
Hie thud question called attention
to Lawson's statements that he hau
been tola by a broker that a New
X'.irk banker, a cabinet olficer and a
senator had a joint, stock brokerage
accouuL and directed that he tell tlit
couuiiib.Moii the names of those win.
nad given him that information.
"The man who told me that ai
Archibald S. White, ol the lirm oi
While and Company." Representative
Harrison moved and the I'jmmiUee ap
proved tuat White be subpoenaed.
Replying to the next question as to
whether he had relerred in statements
that members of Congress had en
gaged in baying and selling stocks,
La sun said he could not give their
names as be did not know them. It
u a ; ans Aci in,; the next question, as
to other persi.ns wh'i had given him
cid"nce in substantiation of his vari
ous statements, that Lawson hroiigh'.
in the names of Secretary Tumulty
and William W. Price, White House
correspondent of the Washington Star,
lie received a letter from a Washing
ton woman, Mrs. Ruth Thomas Vis
count, saying in part:
"My Dear Air. Laws'jn: If the name
of the n.an who was go-between in
the present leak and the amount of
the money he received is of assistance j
to you, 1 can supply the name and the j
amount he received and give the name
of at least one person at the White
House.
"If you are interested. I will make
an engagement to meet you at such
a place as you may designate."
The letter further requested that
Lawson hjld the information in the
strictest confidence in case he did not
proceed further in the matter. Law
son then said he made an appointment
with Mrs. Viscount, who came lo his
apartment with an attorney whose
name he could not recall. After a
long conference, he said, Mrs. Viscount
IU1U mill mat .Ml. X lilt? Udua 'an u
the leak agair between Secretary
Tumulty and others." I
Nj reference was made either by j
Lawson or the committee to the
amount of money referred in Mrs.
Viscounti's letter.
The seventh question asking whom
Lawson referred by saying a member
of Congress had given him three
names of persons reported to have
been involved in the deal brought
this reply:
"Chairman Henry."
Names McAdoo's Brother.
The next question and the two fol
lowing were virtually the same. MrH
Lawson was asked if he had any other
information in relation to his intinn
tions that another "high official of the
government had information regarding
the leak" and that a relative of a
cabinet official als'j had been men
tioned. He replied that the firm of
C. D. Barney and company, in Wall
Street; Malcolm McAdoo, a brother of
Secretary McAdoo, and Stuart G. Gib
boney, of the firm of McAdoo and
Gibboney, with offices at the Grand i
Central Station and at 165 Bi'oadway.
were the men to whom he referred.
Speaking with emphasis, he added
"that the public man who knew of the
leak machinery was Paul Warburg of
the federal reserve board."
Refers to Lansing.
Chairman Henry, took up a list of
cabinet officers and asked Lawson if
he had "connected" each of them with
the leak. Coming to the name of Sec
retary Lansing, Lawson said he had
u'Jt make a suggestion of him in the
affair in connection with the names
ihe congressman had given him as
oeing parties to the "leak-" "Do you !
refer to Secretary Lansing in any con
nection?" Mr. Henry asked: -
"Yes,"- Lawson replied.
Lawson Fights Back.
Henry then accused Lawson of drag
ging the name of Lansing into thii
hearing and Lawson flared up fur;-'
ously. j
"I have said the names of Lansing
and the German ambassador 'jut of I

information which I have not, and I

Lawson then related in detail h'jw
he had come to Washington at the re
quest of Chairman Henry and had
called on him at his office; how Henry
had told him that he wanted his help
to run down the leak charges.
"I told him that the only thing to
be done was to get first hand informa
tion and to get it Worn other people,"
said Lawson. "I said that I would
not give him hearsay information;
that my principal reason was that I
did not want to besmirch anyone un
justly but I declared that I could give
him a formula for getting all the in
formation through a real investiga
tion. "I asked him what the committee
had heard. He said the committee al
ready had heard that Secretary Lans
ing had gone to the Biltmore Hotel in
New York four times to meet Bernard
Baruch. The chairman also said that
he believed Secretary Lansing ab
solutely innocent of giving informa
tion and I said that was what I
thought about it.
"I said I will stake my head on it
that Secretary Lansing did not do any
thing wrong.' I- alt'j said that I
thought Secretary Lansing might have
given information that perfectly fair
for any man to give.
Chairman Henry also told me that
there had come to the committee a re
port that the German ambassador had
profit lied $2,000,000, but he said he did
not think there was any truth in it."
Looks Bad for Henry.
Lawson further declared that Henry
pleaded with him t the end of their
second conference; to cease urging an
investigation of the "leak" charges. U
would be a serious thing to the coun
try, Lawson quoted Henry as saying,
to have an inquiry at this time. .It
mig'it'be possible, however, Lawson
said Henry pointed out, to inaugurate
a wide inquiry into the stock market
situation in (he course of thirty days
or so.
At that point Lawson reiterated his
statement that he never told Henry
nor had he told anyone that he had
direct information regarding a leak.
In the midst of Lawson's remarks.
Chairman Henry rose from his seat in
the center of the committee table and
started around toward the witness
chair, telling Iawson that 'ie mould be

Diamonds
In a city the size of Risbee. together
with its suburbs, there is always
one jewelry store that is generally
considered to be the best place to
buy diamonds.
In Bisbee we believe that most
people. If they had an opportunity
to express a choice, would prefer to
have their diamonds come from
Gilmans.
Here you will find reliability and
quality as every diamond is care
fully graded and priced at absolute
value.
It is a good thing to know that
the reputation and the responsibil
ity of the oldest Jewelry store in
Pisbee is back of every diamond
you purchase at this establishment.

Instinctive recognition of Col. Cody's manly qualities t.t
heart and mind won and held the world's esteem and the
fervent worship of boyhood. What man on the sunny side
! ol the sixties has not, at some time or other, looked upon
Buffalo Bill as his ideal? And he was a man who actually
lived the stories that Cooper invented. It's sad to think
that there will be no more such men.
TUESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 16, 1917.
THE "SILENT SENTINELS".
An organization of woman suffragists, irritated by the
president's continued refusal to support a federal suffrage
amendment, has undertaken to picket the White House.
The president is not allowed to enter" or leave the execu
tive mansion without encountering one or more of these
"silent sentinels", looking at hira in mute but eloquent
reproach and displaying a banner with an appropriate
suffrage legend. A sufficient fund has been raised to pay
the pickets expenses and provide them with umbrellas
when it rains:
It may do no great harm, provided the zealous sentinels
don't catch cold, or the police don't run them in. Still,
even if they're within their legal rights, it's hard to un
derstand why the president of the United States should
be subjected to such annoyance. The project smacks of
British militancy, and militant methods have never been
pepular or profitable in this country. Big gains of Ameri
can suffrage have been made by calm, sensible procedure
rather than spectacular "stunts".
Courtesy and logic have been the American suffragist's
most effective weapons. Threats have never availed, and
never-wilW Men do not like to yield to women through
coercion.. ' And it's safe to say that the majority of Ameri
cans, women as well as men, don't like, to see their public
men, especially their president, badgered by well-meaning
bnt mistaken propagandists, no matter how praiseworthy
their cause may be.
There's grave reason, too', to question the wisdom of
these women's demand. It is generally recognized as
inevitable and right thai women should get the ballot.
But there's nothing like general agreement that the wom
en of every state should be given the ballot at once, by
federal amendment. It is felt, in most non-suffrage states
at least, that each state has a right to give the ballot or
withhold it, without dictation from other states. A con
stitutional amendment, if successful, would force suffrage
on some states that do not want it that is to say, on
states not yet ready for it. When they are ready, they
will want it. And until that time conies, is tiiere any
justice or any profit in forcing it down their throats?
THE LAST OF HIS KIND.
Prefacing brief comment on the death of Col. William
F. Cody, we take the liberty of quoting the following
stanzas written, we believe, by- Editor Rodgers of the
Prescott Courier:
"Sunset and the end of the trail;
Here the last faint footsteps fail
And I go on alone
Into the untracked ways;
I who in other days
Blazed many a road straight up
To the peaks that touch the sun
But now is the climbing done.
"No more to my feet the trail;
No more to my hand the rein;
No more Ah! never again
The sun and the wind, and free!
The far stars over me!
As the wilderness called I went
Now deep and solemn and low
A Mightier calls and I go.
"No guide nor compass nor sign;
Face out, to the uttermost dark;
And the wind in the pine boughs ilark!
I'aean and dirge for a king!
Life, I have loicd you well;
Forget the rest when you tell -Tliis
soul did not falter, nor quail,
Nor shrink from the end of the Trail."
With the passing of Buffalo Bill lias pa.;.-cd the oil
West. He epitomized a historical epoch. The hunter,
pathfinder, Indian-lighter became a ran huinn. Starting
life in the Wild West of Missouri and Kansas, where men
lived by knife and rille, he ended his days as a raider of
.cattle- for Chicago parking houses and a developer "f
jimgaled land for scientific fanners.
As a showman, Buffalo Bill made himself known to the
whole world. For two generations his name has been
familiar in millions of households. But he was not a
fchowman in the sense that Barmim was. IJc had no taste
and little tab-nt for uiero rood-natured h'-iirV'.!" I'.v " ai
WHY HE CAN'T GET HIS PAPER.
An American citizen living in Mexico, unable to get the
New York Times delivered as usual, complained to the
Mexican postoflice department and received this re
sponse: "In reply to year note, cited in antecedents, I manifest
to you that so long as these periodical publications edited
in the United States made obstructionist labor against
the dispositions emanating from the administration of
government of the Republic, putting difficulties in the
way of its pacification, the Directorate General, which is
under my charge, in accordance with the right conceded
it in the final part of Faragraph 5 of Article 16 of the
Postal Union Convention, extensive to all the countries
of said Union, has proceeded and will proceed right along
to restrict all copies of that kind."
It looks like a complete rejoinder to the complainant.
Incidentally it sounds like a proiiuncianiento from Get?.
Venustiano Carran-a, First Chief of the Constitutionalist
Forces, etc. Mexican officials, it seems, and in fact Latin
Americans in general, always write like that. Words,
words, words! No wonder Mexicans and Yankees hava
trouble understanding each other.

Progressives Revolt When,'
Standpatter Is Elected Vicej
Chairman of G. O. P. Ex
ecutive Committee.
lilt HEKO OF YOUNG AMERICA
By BUINKERHOFF.
THE ELECTORAL ELECTION.
President Wilson has now been re-elected president:
It happened last Monday. The casual reader may insist
chat it happened in November, but he is wrong. The
November election meant nothing in the sight of the cor.
titut'on. 'From a legal standpoint, the president was
not elected until 48 little groups of citizens designated as
-lectors met in their various state capitals and cast their
ballots. ,
Those citizens had absolute power. They might have
elected Mr. Hughes or Mr. Roosevelt or Mr. Bryan or
Mr. Debs or Tom Lawson, and their choice would have
been final. The Democratic party could rage and the
nation could be torn by factional strife, but the supreme
court would presumably have had to give its approval.
The basic law of tha land provides no alternative.
Nothing but a sense of public responsibility made those
electors vote as they did. But that is the most powerful
force in this country. ThatVery sense of public responsi
bility is stronger than law. Our laws have been broken
countless times. The constitution has been defied over
and over again. But only once in the history of th
United States has a single elector dared to use his own
discretion and vote contrary to the expressed will of the
community he represented. And that was from a noble
motive. '
"This," says the New York World, "is the sharpest test
that a self-governing people can apply to itself.' Clumsy
and dangerous as ve know the electoral system to be in
the possibilities of disputed results which it always pre
sents, its operation nevertheless furnishes quadrennial
proof that our institutions are stable and that they ar
not to be betrayed."
EXPLAINING INFANTILE PARALYSIS.
Ever since the beginning of the infantile paralysis epi
demic in and around New York last summer, there has
been widespread interest in the nature of this baffling
disease. At last American Medicine comes forward with
an explanation.
"The etiologic factor of acute poliomyelitis (that's what
they call the paralysis) is a pleomorphic, motile, anerohie,
pathogenic, oblipative hemoprotozoon."
This is really worse than any of us imagined. Heading
further, wc learn that it the ohligativc hotnoprotzoon
has "a developmental cycle consisting of a resisting, mo
tile, dividing and resistant spore stage, which elaborates
a virrs having a destructive affinity for myelin and sus
ceptible to great augmentation and modification."
It might seem superfluous to add anything further to
this luminous exposition. Inasmuch as the magazine
prides itself on its freedom from technical terms, the mat
ter must be clear enough to any ordinary intelligence.
Lest there may lie some slight haziness, however, as !o
what the learned writer is driving at, we hasten to quote
further details regarding this interesting hemoprotozou:
"It is pathogenic to man and domestic to animals, en
demic in the tropics, epidemic in tropics and in the tem
perate zone during the summer season, pandemic under
conditions of prolonged heat and drought and other uu
known factors."
There now do you understand? No? Well, it really
would lc a little clearer if doctors wrote English iustead
of their absurd jargon.
"I never yet met a:t American," says Bernard Shaw,
"who had any notion of the institutions of his native land
beyond a general and mostly erroneous idea that Ihcy
are glorious." And isn't it odd that so few of us have
ever met any Englishman who didn't reveal the same
ignorance and error about England?
tiuppo-.e we're not personally so prosperous as the
optimal s would have us believe. "Who are we, anyhow,"
suggests the New Yuik Times, " that all of us should V
perfectly happy in this most unhappy world? That our
prospeiily is not w.'iolly unalloyed may be counted In us
lor merit in the liual re koning."

NEW YORK, Jan. 15. The alliance
formed between Republicans nd Pro-1
gressives in the recent presidential i
nn.paign apparently ws threatened
with disruption tfcnight after the an-'
nouncenient t'at the executive com
mittee of the Republican naional
committee, in session here, had se
lected John TiIor Adams, of Iowa,!
pft vice chairman. I
Mr. Adams was named against the
wishes of Chairman W. R. Wi'lcox and
others on the committee it was said.
His appointment was promptly inter
preted by Progressive party leaders
as the return to power of the so
called "old guard" wing of the Re
publican party.
A resolution intended to bring Re
publicans nd Progressives into closer
harmony was passed by the commit
tee and a few hours later George W.
Perkins and Everett Colby, Progres
sive party leaders, announced they
had withdrawn their acceptances to
a dinner Chairman Willcox gave to
the committer Ths was due, they as
sr"ed. "to the action of the execu
tive .nimiHee over the protest of
Chairman Wulcnx."
In a signed statement Mr. Perkins
t1 Mr. Colby declared the action of
t'-e executive co mittee was a "de
liberate and wilful reflection upon
C r.iniiP.n Willcox and an affront to
rry Progressive votr n the coun
ty . "They asserted that the split
between the Republican and Progres
sive parties ws as wide open as ever,
and said they would issue a detailed
statement tomorrow.
When he learned of the j-talernent
issued by Mr. PerHns and Mr. Colby
Chairman Willcox first said he i eg ret
ted tiny had not attended the dinner,
as it was "strictly social" and had
'no polthal significance."

f ARIZONA ONE OF FEW
STATES WHICH BARS
ALL "PERSONAL USE"
In Kansas, Colorado, Maine,
Iowa, North Dakota and
Arkansas There Is No Limit
to Shipments.
Of considerable interest to people
of Arizona and yet of no particular
instructive value, inasmuch as the
decision recently handed down by the
supreme court validating tiie eDD
Kenyon act merely makes Arizona's
prohibition law more effective, is the
statement recently made by H. A.
Hugo, president of the Missouri
Wholesale Liquor Dealers' Associa
tion. tn this statement Huso declares
that the Webb-Kenyon decision was
not sueh a triumph tor the drys
because the liquor people were not
encroaching upon state laws when
liquor shipments are limited. Huso
fails to note, however, that no liquor
can come into Arizona and that the
court's decision on the Webb-Kenyon
pet makes it more binding.
I The interview follows:
i " "H. A. Hugo, president of the Mis
souri Wholesale Liquor Dealers As
sociation, discussing the decision
banded down Mondpy in the United
I "States Supreme Court sustaining the
Webb-Kenyon law, passed by con
gress, aid many persons had gained
a wrong impression of the effect of
tfcat decision by reading misleading
headlines in certain newspapers.
"The Webb-Kenyon law, enacted
several years ago," he said, "aimed
at curtailing into 'dry' states, but dis
tinctly states that no liquor shall be
shipped into any state, for use or sale
contrary' to the laws of said state.
Many states, which are 'dry' by stat
utory prohibition or by n vote of the
people, have enacted laws limiting
the amount of distilled liquors, wines
and beer which individuals are allow
ed to receive for their personal use.
"In Arkansas, Colorado. Iowa, Kan
sas, Maine and North I'akota no limit
is placed on shipments" for personal
use, these being "dry' states. In the
twelve other 'dry' states, shipments
for personal use are limited. All le
gitimate liqnor dealers are and have
been making shipments of liquors
into these states in strict accordance
with these enactments. Consequently,
the decision of the supreme court,
instead of being a huge victory for
the 'drys' as some of the headlines
had it, merely places the highest
stamp of legality upon these legal
shipments, and the citizens of those
states will continue to receive their
liquor for personal use in the pre
scribed quantities."

ten-reel picture drama. "The Argon-
auts of California", which w ill be
shown at the Lowell theatre on Janu
ary IS, are wonderfully accurate and
graphic reproductions of actual scenes
attending, the "operations of the fa
mous Vigilance Committee which took
the law into its own hands, captured,
tried, convicted and executed the ring
leaders of the "Hounds", the "Sydney
Coves" and other outlaw bands which
terrorized early San Francisco in the
turbulent times following the discov
ery of gold.
The climax 'ot this wonderfully stir
ring epic of the Golden Days, however,
is the abduction of Marian Stilwell,
the heroine, by the wicked Spaniard,
Don Enrico: the beautiful girl's soul
wrecking struggle with him for her
honor; the pursuit by the Viliglante
posse under the leadership of John
Brandon, her lover; the battle at the
Don's hacienda where Farina is a
prisoner; her rescue and the capture
jf the Don and his execution in I'orts
mouth Square in the presence of thou
sands. .

CLARA KIMBALL YOUNG
IN WORLD FEATURE AT
THE ROYAL THEATRE
! Beautiful Actress, Now With
Sleznick Pictures, Appears
ToHv at Main Street House
in.'The Dark Silence."
Last evening at the Y. W. C. A. the
Citizen's Committee, composed of lead
ing men and women of the Warren '
District, signed an agreement with j
the Redpath Lyceum Bureau, with
western headquarters in Denver, to I
furnish Bisbee with sl feature at-1
rracttnna hetveen Orfoher nnH March '
of the coming season.
Looking to secure the be?t talent
and entertainment for tile people of
the Warren District, the committee
discussed the offerings of the Red
path Bureau and another concern and,
after considerable deliberation, came
to the conclusion that the Redpath of
ferings had the more merit and, con
sequently, were signed up.
Leading the list of attractions will
be the Ben Greet Players. When Ben
Greet first appeared In the United
States his offerings were Immediately
accepted by the people as the best of
their kind in the world. With a cap
able company of actors Greet produced i
several Shakespeare's nAist famous
plays. For the most part he put on
his plays In the open. Among his most
famous vehicles is "a Midsummer
Night's Dream". What he will ap
pear In during his Bisbee visit has
not been determined but. In all prob
ability, it will be something from the
pen of the great English dramatist j
In addition to Ben Greet, two other
attractions worthy of special notice
are the Schumann Quintette, composed
of some of the most accomplished
musicians In America, and Thomas
Brooks Fletcher, the noted lecturer.
Mr. Brooks appeared in Bisbee two
years ago and the desire to hear him
again, by those who saw him at the
time of his previous appearance, is :

Principles of Progress
That the present state of
civilization of all races is the
result of an evolutionary pro
cess is today beyond question
of doubt One of the princi
ples of this slow form of pro
gress is the inventions which
have broken the barriers of
isolation and made as one all
the nations of earth. The rail
roads, steamships, telegraph,
etc., are prime factors, but
the public press is univer
sally recognized as one of the
greatest agents of public up
lift It spreads the desire for
knowledge; it furnishes sub
jects for comment; It creates
an air of independence, and it
keeps the great family of hu
manity in touch." No fam
ily circle is quite complete
without a daily visitation of
one or more of the leading
papers. To supply this need
for Bisbee and the Warren
District the Review has en

"The Dark Silence" with Clara Kim
ball Young is a picture in which this
popular actress shows to exceedingly
good advantage. It is a World Pic
I ture, directed by Albert Capellani, and
tells a vivid story of a girl artist who
meets a lover only to have him leave
suddenly to see his father on his dy
ing bed. The letter left behind to ex
plain matters is misinterpreted with
the result that Mildred, love sick,
leaves the studio to jbin the Red Cross
nurses. Ainsworth,: returning, is in
formed that Mildred, believing him
untrue, has discarded him. Down
hearted, he joins the army, and in bat
tle he is blinded. Fate works its magic
power and brings the wounded soldier
to the hospital where Mildred is en
gaged. She recognizes him, she cares
for him, but as he is blinded, he
knows not the Identity of his atten
tive nurse, and tells her the story of
his bitter romance.
Mildred then learns for the first
time the true circumstances of their
estrangement When Ainsworth leaves
the hospital. Mildred is engaged to
care for him. In the meantime, Sibil,
Ainsworth's sister, has learned that
Dr. Mario Martinez, an especially cap
able surgeon, had come to the city.
She obtains his services, restores sight
to Ainsworth, and then the soldier and '
nurse come face to face again, this '
time never to part It Is an unusually
interesting and fascinating . phtitodra
ma and will be shown at the Royal
theatre today.

the money but he hates to be scared
to death.
