Premier Outlines War
Aims of Britain and
Allies to Conference
jDemands Restoration and Reparation for Belgium, Final
Disposition of Alsace-Lorraine Controversy, Autonomy
for States Now Dominated by Germany, and Declares Al
lies Have No Intention of Disrupting Germany, Austria,
Turkey or Bulgaria. x
LONDON, Jan. 5. The British prime minister, . David
Lloyd George, today set forth Great Britain's war aims more
specifically and at greater length before the delegates of the
trades union than he had ever done before.
Having first declared that it was not a war of aggression
against Germany or the German people, and that the break
ing up of the German peoples or the disintegration of their
state was not one of the objects for which the .allies were
fighting, he proceeded to mention the fundamental issues for
which Britain and her allies were contending.
First among these was the restoration of Belgium and
reparation for the injuries inflicted. Next came the restora
tion of Serbia, Montenegro and the occupied parts of France.
Italy and Rumania. France must have Alsace-Lorraine and
to this end, the premier said, the British nation would stand
by the French democracy to the death.
The question of Russia was touched upon, and Mr. Lloyd
George said that Britain, as well as America, France and Italy,
would have been proud to fight by the side of the new Rus
sian democracy. But now Russia could only be saved by her
own people. He declared an independent Poland, an urgent
necessity for the stability of western Europe.
Rumania is to be protected, and the British and other al
lies are with Italy in her desire for complete union of the peo
ple of the Italian race and tongue. Of Austria-Hungary, he
felt that while the breaking up of the dual kingdom was no
part of the allied aims, it was impossible to hope for the re
moval of causes of unrest in that part of Europe unless genu
ine self-government was granted the Austro-Hungarian na
tionalities. The Turkish empire within the homelands of the Turkish
race, with Constantinople as its capital, niay be maintained.
But the passage between the Mediterranean and Black sea
must be internationalized and neutralized, and in the British
view, Arabia, Mesopotamia, Syria and Palestine are entitled
to recognition of their separate national conditions.
The matter of the German colonies.,
all of which now are in the hands of. populations are being subjected to the
the allies, will be placed before a con- ufferings and privations of a war .in

Sunday Morning Sermon
Tor in much wisdom is much grief; and
he that increaseth knowledge increaeeth sor
row. Ecclesiastes 1-1 S.
Thus said the preacher who was a king and the
wisest man of all the sons of men. His -court was the
gayest and the greatest upon the earth at that time,
and yet when he came to cast up the totals upon human
life and endeavor he found that with years and success
and wealth and fame came sorrow and much grief, and
what he found he set down upon the page in an ink that
will never fade away.
The Master must have loved His people very much,
the least of them as well as the greatest, in those old
days when the world was young, for unto the homely
ones He gave strength and unto the weak ones wisdom.
He not only placed a thorn under the petals of the rose,
but He placed a cup of sorrow in the hand of beauty
and the worm that never dies eats at the heart of the
high ones and the scornful of the earth. Solomon. the
wise king and great preacher, dipped his pen in the'
blood from the human heart and wrote in sorrow. But
he did not repine or complain or lament; he merely told
of the grief that dimmed his eye and broke his spirit at
the end.
That the most magnificent king of all times should
hare left his greatest message for the poor and humble
and weary at heart is not so strange as it may seem ar
first thought. He KNEW that gold and power and ex
ceeding wisdom were only vanity of vanities, and he
wrote of these things in shining words and pearl en
crusted sentences and they are his heritage to those
countless ones that sit in the shadow and mourn.
All of us are prone to think that with an increase of
salary come joy and great happiness.' But it brings
grief more often than gladness. We think that a change
of climate or scene vDl make us happy indeed. But the
same storms sweep all skies and the same gray mist
hangs over all lands ana the same scorching heat and
bitter cold and bad days circle the earth. We think that
fame is the acme of happiness. But the hand of fame
is never filled and for the envenomed sting of ambition
there is no healing potion that will prevail. -
Solomon knew. And with the most eloquent and
potent pen ever held by man he told the world that
with much wisdom came much grief. There is an im
mutable and immortal law of balances that will not be
denied. With each recompense there is a handicap, and
with every handicap there is a recompense. To the
simple, humble pCgrim who toils in the shadow is given
a glad heart and a strong hand. In his folly he would
barter these things fpr gilded fame in the house cf
kings. And then, with the ashes turning bitter, in his
mouth, he seeks to exchange his toga of power and his
beaten vessels of gold for his old happy, carefree heart
and his cheerful little scng. But it is too late. His
knowledge eateth. Inward; his collar of gold leaves a
mark from chafing that cannot be healed; his fame,
no matter how brief anj fleeting, has Inrected the tis
sues with a canker for which there is no cure.
"For in much wisdom is much griff." Solomon knew.
He saw more deeply into human nature than any man
has ever seen before or since. He was given the all-seeing
eye before which all the veils and mists that hide
our happiness and miseries are as crystal. The emotions,
fears, hopes, disappointments, rewards and motives of
human life passed before him in naked review, and. with
his Gcd-given wisdom, he sorted them in perfect propor
tions and judged them with an exactness that did not
vary one hair from the primal cause and the ultimate
effort. . And then, in tbe t flight or bis days, he de
clared that ia mu b wisdom there was much grief and
that sorrow increased w it Ji knowledge.
And yet Solomon did not intend that we should not
seek wisdom. Rather, he pointed out the certain rocks
upon that shore. Both grief and gladness are the com
aion lot of mankind. The brave man meets them and
does his heft. The man worth while eeks out knowledge,
knowing fu'J well that it increases his rapacity for sof-fr-iiis
at tV sami time that it Mis liis f-up of wisdom
1j r. tcea frv t H'irn a lut.'e aa-J lcvc a litt'.e and
plr.y a little and lose a little and laugh a little and
fuffer much. Envy is contentment's worst foe and
f preads more trouble for our frail lives than a pestilence.
Let us do our best, hiding our tears behind a smile
and then go away with empty hands, disappearing for
and setting our Hps to mask our sorrow. After tbe toil
is rest; after the strife is peace. We will give our mite
ever among the shadows that Solomon's God declared
would some day turn into everlasting light.

It is declared that Austria. Bulgaria and Turkey are
greatly dissatisfied with the domineering attitude of
Germaay at the Russian peace conference. But as to
just why these tools of the kaiser should be surprised
Into any emotion over the domineering attitude of the
Prussian, deponent sayeta not. It is his natural condi
tion, and has been for forty years in all matters per
taining to arms, society, education or Industry. That
he should assume any other attitude is past human con
templatioa. The lion and the tiger have been gentled,
but sever the hyena. Prussian lips have been schooled
to pronounce soft and fair words and to smile and aWle.
bat the Prussian heart has always been the same and
the Prussia hand knows only the iroa glove. The readi
ness of the "Prussian to talk peace misled a few people
who ha J blinded their own eyes in order not to see that
which they feared. But once in the rooms of the peace
conference and dealing and dickering with a broken peo
ple, the old gorge and arrogance and savagery and
egoism and lust and heedlessness of the blood of Attila
he Hun broke out, and the promise of peace without
annexation was cast aside with a sardonic smile and a
smiting of the iron hanl upon the table and the poor
slaves that' sat before -them were told that Prussia
would hold what she had taken and would act as she
pleased in all things. This fearful example of Russia's
plight may wen serve its turn with Christendom and
nerve the democratic nations to fight the great fight to
a finish. The only meek and just and humane Hun in
the world is a beaten Hun.

over the prospects for this year than I ever have been

all-year-round climate in the United States. .Wages are
the highest here and the demand for labor greater than
in any town or city in the country. Working conditions
here are as good as we can hope to see them in this
selfish, faulty old world. Business conditions are strong
and active. And more than all these. Is the spirit of our
citizens and business men and property owners generally.
Their attitude -is fifty-fifty at its best- They are ready
and eager to give a fair deal to all men and insist upon
that kind of a deal in return. These things, with the

"We rely upon our strong position," declares the
German chancellor in answer to Russia's protests against
a peace that included German domination of all con
quered territory. And therein lies the key to all Ger
man diplomacy and German action of any kind in deal
ing with other nations and peoples. They rely upon
strength. It this can only be brought home and kept be
fore the people of the nations that are fighting the Prus
sian, this monster will be taught that no man or nation
can successfully rely upon a strong position alone. Right
is might, in this age of eulightenmeut that marks the com
ing of the masses into their own. A strorg position is
only impregnable as long as it is on the side ot the right.
There are sharper things than the sword. There are
stronger things than muscle and iron and high explosive.
A tiny star-ray from Heaven has given this old world
the magic talisman of sriritual invincibility that is suf
ficient to prevail over all material things. And the
German chancellor with his iron jaw and cold eye and
brazen throat and arrogant gesture, will be brought, soon
or late, to see and to know and to how to the inevitable
summons.

found that bran has been selling in
the Arizona mills at around $50 a ton.

"WHERE THE WEST BEGINS.'
The Cochise county sheriff's office scores again
Barney Schiller, wanted at Tucson for murder, was ar
rested in Los Angeles the other day upon information
furnished by a Bis bee representative of the office. The
very next day a robber, fleeing from Bisbee, was ap
prehended on the roast through prompt and intelligent
measures taken by this alert department. The taking
of the Johnson murderer a few weeks ago is still fresh
in the public mind. Ia fine, Cochise county has about
the most effective and efficient set of sleuths In her de
partment of law enforcement, from the brave sheriff
himself, down to the l'st signed deputy, that can be
found anywhere in the west. There seems to be an
epidemic of crime in, tbe southwest right now, and it is
a most fortunate thing that this county has a legal organ

Blue Sky Law Is
Upheld by Court
Setting En Bank
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LOS AXGELES. Cal, Jan. 5. Con
stitutionally of the. Arizona "Hup
sky" law was upheld today in an opin
ion handed down in the United States
circuit conn.
Tha decision was in a case brought
by the Arizona MotT and Truck as
sociation asalnst the Arizona corpora
tion commission, and -other officials.
The eflect in this particular case is
to bring it to trial 'in Arizona.
Arizoiia's blue sky law was the sub
ject of attack at a hearing Friday be
fore a court consisting of United
States Circuit Judge Ross, United
States District Judge Bledsoe and Uni
ted States District Judge SawteUe of
Tncson. sitting in banks, on the m
tion of the state of Arizona, in Los
Angeles, to dismiss the prayer for an
injunction asked for by W. S. Lowe
and J. E. Morrison, representing the
Arizona Motor and Truck company.
The action is to restrain the corpora
tion commission from enforcing the
"bhie sky law."
After arguments by J. E. Morrison,
representing the Arizona Motor and
Truck company, and W. P. Geary, as
sistant attorney general of Arizona,
and Robert E. Fisher, speaking for the
state, Judse Ross announced that a de
rision would be deliTered at 10 o'clock
Saturday morning.
It was alleged on the pin of the
state officers that the stock seil'.ns
proposition of tne Arizona Motor and
Truck company, is a fraud on its faf ;
that it is an individual association
without any assets; that there hai
been no stock subscriptions on the
part of the promoters, who proposal
taking one-third of each $1 subscrib
ed for membership fees or stock sub
scription sales for themselves to be
used for promotion purposes, and that,
under the plan of organization, it is
proposed to hand over the corpora
tion oi association for the first year
to AV. S. Lo"e, one cf the complaic
ants, as general manager of the organ
ization. Attorney Morrison attacked the
"bine sky law." claiming it is a ar to
the exploitation of legitimate business,
and that every partnership doing busi
ness in Arizona is subject to the legis
lation now on the statute books of that
state. He argued that the operation cf
the law w ill deprive his clients of their
property without due process of tar.-,
and that it is up to the Arizona cor
poration commission, in their un
challenged opinion, to say whether
permits shall he issued to any vol
untary association, corporation or 1
dividual to sell frock or any ete:
IMie. There Is no allegation of fri'j-1
against the Arizona Motor and TrncU
pompacy. It vas a legitimate er.
terprise. he sa:d. to secure funds to
er"(t aa auionioiine assembling pia .j
in Arizona, that would sell to its su'-j
seniors and stockholders automobiles
for $950 which ordinary cost a Frscr.

Terming the story, regarding thej
proposed hearing asked by the Moun
tain States Telephone company and j
wherein the company was alleged to
have asked the corporation commis
sion for some arbitrary rules, as "pif
fie." H. D. McVay, commercial repre
tentative of the phone concern and
former resident of Blsbee, arrived in
she city last evening. Mr. McVay will
interview the local commercial clul)(
in regard to the matter while he is
here, and will remain here for some
days, also on other business.
The story appeared, originally, in
:he Arizona Gazette. It purported tr
ie a copy of the demands, made by the
telephone company upon the Arizon
corpDration commission. The 'Warren j
District Commercial Club immediately
took action on the matter and adopte.l J
resolutions against the granting of
the demands. i
McVay. while in Tu"son on his way
:o Bisbee, took np the story with the
Tucson Chamber of Commerre. That
argamzation went on record as belnT
perfectly satisfied with the revues:
of the company from beginning to enc.
The Arizona Star yesterday morr
:cg printed the following story regard-j
the chamber of commerce action o.i
he matter:
1n about two seconds the board c."
directors of the chamber of commerce
yesterday decided the charges that t!v
Mountain States Telephone Tele
graph company was endeavoring t
secure arbitrary right to raise rate
without superivision cf the corpora
tion commission, and to secure othf
drastic powers, were uncalled for. an 1
voted to so inform the Warren Chair,
her of Commerce of its action.
The decision was arrived at afte
he rules and regulations submit tel
by the company to the corporation
commission, read to them by H. D. Mc
Vay, special representative of th;
Mountain States Telephone & Tele
graph company of 1-1 Paso, who ap
peared before the directors at the r
request after the directors had receiv
ed a communication from the Warre t
chamber seeking co-operation in re
sisting the alleged powers.
"Further, the directors told Mr. Mc
Vay they were unable to see any rec
kon for objecting to the regulations,
which were presented In individu. !
coDies to each cf the directors f"
fhi-binv iHr w c .a amiiino.1 In t ' 1 '
hat one rule that which fixed th
rhare for re-lnstalation. of ttlephor.3
service after senice had been iisco--ttnued
for non-payment the rules ar I
regnlations were the same as tho;
approved in previous yecrs t-y tl'f
corporation commissioners.
"This section. Mr. !tfc"ay said, w.?
made necessary by ran'-h snbs-riler.-.
To get their rental required almos:
the cost of the rent and to take ox t
the telephone service was additionrl
cost. The company was compelled .
re-install such service and it desire 1
the right to penalize such deliquer;
subscribers. In Arizona, between J5.
9O0 and IS.000 was carried as an over
head by such deliquent subscribers,
in not one county was the net profit
meeting the dividend maximum pe
mitted by the state.
" 'AH we want is for the subscribers
to pay for the service and to cut down
the cost which the company is bearing
instead of asking for a higher rate,
which would place the burden upon
vo l who do pay your bills.' said M'.
McCay.
"This penalty is fixed at one do!l; r
and the advanced subscription for tl o
period of the contract.
"The action of the Bisbee Comraer
rial club and elsewhere was the result,
apparently, of a misunderstanding s.1
the time the matter came before In
corporation commissioners. lmmei:
ately the hearing action was suspend
ed, at the reouet of the company, u--til
the matter is thoroughly under
stood by the eommuniuc-a involved.

the company for permission to adopt

All these and other like adjustment
the premier showed would be carried
cut in accordance with the principle
of self-government, or the consent of
the governed, the enunriatun of which
may be t!ken as the keynote of his
sneeoh. This form of settlement he
declared, should replace the old sys
tem of negotiations at a council table
by a few schemers trying to promoV
the interests of one dynasty or an
other. Regret that Russia was no loncer
fighting cn the sides of the allies was
expressed by the premier, who declar
ed only Russia's own people wonlil
save her now from faline ultimately
under Prussian domination.
In beginning, the premier pointe:!
out that he was speaking not merely
for th? British government. He had
been at pains to consult representa
tives opinion Cf al sections of thouslr
before framing his utterances, and
thus was speaking the mind of the na
tion and the empire.

day was the cotr.p'icstion U Ttre?'.-Ii-ov.-k.

Great Britain's war aims were set
forth yesterday by Premier Llc 1
George in the broadest and at the
same time most spee-ific manner In
which they have yet been stated. In
one of the most striking and compre
hensive utterances of the war the
nreniier made it clear what the Bri'
sh nation and empire would retard
as a just and durable peace. Thi.-.
'e declared, must be achieved by th-
re-estabhshmctit of the fanctity of
treaties, terriotrial adjustments on the
bsis of self-government and the limi
ation of araments guaranteed by an
international organization.
Great Britain as not fiehtiur. said
the premier, to disrupt Germany, de
s'my Austria-Hineary or to take
Turkey's raoital or her home lands
from iier. The desire, instead, he in
sisted, was to turn Germany from her
schemes of military domination to be
neficint tasks in the world and to st
le the territorial ouestions of the war
in a way that would do justice to the
various nationalities affected.
In efefct a reply to and rejection
of the peace terms of the cenV
powers as voiced by their spokesman
recently at Brest-Lit ovsk. the premi
er's pec-ch as for the most part
affirmative utterar-ce. In treat detail
he went into the mai.y problems csll
ing for solution if tl:' pence he da'l
in mind was to be forrhcon.ipg.

(Iron Ore)
AH doubts concerning the final outcome of the process determined for
the treatment of the ores of the New Corueiia Copper company have been
qnieted and the great work of mining and leaching the forty million tons
already proved on the New .Cornelia lands Is fairly under way. That the j
tonnage to be beneficiated will ran far above this is certain because since j
the test of the ore formations were made, several years ago. the company
has added new territory, taking over the Ajo Consolidated ground with 1150 ,
acres that holds ore In quantity yet to be dt termined, but that certainly will
produce many millions, a portion of which will be direct-smelting, of higher ;
grade than the greater quantity, the bulk being ores of a grade similar to J
that of New Cornelia. The Ajo Consolidated immediately adjoins the New .
Cornelia claims, and. with the latter. maks a great block of ground, the
very heart of the camp.

This gives 13.212.993 pounds of electrolytic cathodes. 3.423.31 S pounds of

should be known that the product really starts from June of last year, as
prior to this time very little ore was treated and this in an experimental
way. So the figures above are really for only seven months of the year.
Pronounced Success by Dr. Ricketts
Iron Ore is in receipt of the following letter from Dr. L. D. Ricketts.
who is now acting general manager of New Cornelia and Calumet ft Arizona
in the absence of Maj. John C. Greenway. who has a leave of absence while
he serves his country in France, Dr. Ricketts had much to do with Ihe
working out of the process adopted by the New Cornelia company for the
treatment of its ores. lie is one of the most successful metallurgists the
world knows, and is consulting engineer for many of the largest copper
producing con-erns in the west and southwest The part of his letter re
ferring to New Cornelia follows:

main diHou'ty was that our scrap Iron was too coarse and we had difficulty

or less than 70 per cent of the New
Cornelia stock. In ordinary market
times this will mean a very substan
tial interest, amounting to about $30
to $35 a share of the capital stock of
Calumet Arizona. Ilased on what
the company holds in ore reserves
and the profit that ought to result in
fair markets. Calumet Arizona made
a very fine deal when it decided to
take over .New Cornelia. It has a big
investment there in money paid, plant,
railway, etc.. but i' a!I means to have
fceen fVistfficni by the ore deposits.
Gives Some Idea of the Location
The cuts we present of the ore de-,
posit and plant give a very faint idea
of their magnitude. The cuts being
taken by the steam shovels on the
top of ore portiou of the ore body
shows that the mining .will be corn-
paratively easy and cheap." The com
pany has three shovels working on
ore. The great Mesaba iron ore range
has to do some stripping to reach its
ore deposits, probably an average of
ju teet tbe range over, ana tnelr
mines make considerable water. Here
the ore body stands well above the,
surrounding level of the country, with :
verv little strinnlnr and no water will 1

be encountered for a long time. The
ore Is broken ahead of tbe shovels.

were in Arizona last spring there was i
some talk of working at one end of

We have ro information that the
board of directors are considering any

and thiit's a pretty long look ahead.
Incidentally one can figure where the
comonny has ores to Ust for more
han thirty years, permitting the tak -
i ine of more than 5000 tons a day for
period, aud this U a pretty fine

higher grade ores at these properties.
New Cornelia will secure about 3.3S3,

Vem- Cornelia for the present year.
These ores are taken from the low
rrade mass in which they are found.
They are a considerable addition to
the -opper output and vere not esti
mated, so far as we are aware, when
Ihe fieures on valuation of the ore
bodies were compiled.
Plenty of Water for All Purposes
The New Cornelia Copper company
is rarely fortunate in having devel
oped all the water it needs for its
,,iant ,nj people. When the ore was
first beinc considered bv Calumet
Arizona interests that finally secured
it. water was one of the things that
i cause.! no little concern. Ajo was
always described as a dry country.
The Panaaoes moved about the dis
trict following the action of the
springs. When one dried they were
forced to sek another, and springs
"ere rare. But there was consid
able vegetation in the valleys at the
foot of the mountains and this lent
the hope that water would be found.
Drilling was done and an abundance
of water was finally found. The maxl
n,um us. has shown no diminution of
the llow of the water level, the wells
being several hundred feet deep. The

STONES ALL LEFT
OF YPRES' GLORY

DO
i 1.1 Hill jy? u m fi ( I f i n tr.a 3 3 ,-;.-,) a iVvVi h J C
BEHIND THE BRITISH LINES IN
FRANCE. Jan. 2. Correspondence ot
the Associated rress). There is lit
erally nothing left of the once lordly
city of Ypres except heaps of dust
and broken stones. Although still
within the ranite of German artillery,
the city may be visited In compara
tive "safetly. as it is too far behind
the lines to offer a certain target for
continuous bombardment.
Yprt-s is 600 years old and carried
with tt before the war the impress
of an honorable past In the middle
aires, when the Flemish merchants
mere the great traders of Europe, the
city was fabulously wealthy, being for '
many years the center of the wool
trade. After its prosperity passed It
would have become obscure but for
the cathedral and Cloth hall where
the wool merchants once had met.
These two monuments were retnark
ab'e examples of the architecture of
their time, and for a hundred years
had made Ypres known and visited by
tbo world.
It remained for the German to turn
to asies wbat had been a place of
beauty for 50 years. The first bom-r-ardrpent
of Ypres came on November
1. 1914. The town was then full of
wounded soldiers and peasant refu
gees from the surrounding country.
They were crowded principally in the
catiuedrai and the Church of St. Nich
olas, in the vain belief that these
sanctuaries at least would be spared ',
by the Invader.
The battle on the Uls around
Ypres ended 17 davs later. The Ger-!
mans failed to break through the Brit
ish line, but the bombardment of the
town, instead f waning grew more
Intense. ' The Germans, foiled in their
a:emot to capture Ypres. determined
to destroy it. For a long period heavy I
sbe fell 'n'o 'he town at the rae
of 15 a minute. The Found of the
'continuous destruction could be heard
W miles away.
The inhabitants of the town mostly
fled soon after the bombardment
started. When it was over they re
turned to find the. beauty of their
town well-niph goae. The famous
Cloth hall still stood, but it was a
roofless skeleton; only -its cellars
were intact. The great square In;
froTtt of It was heaped with broken 1
stones and charred wood and nearby j
lay the broken bells, the famo'ts beU
or -hc! ffr COO years hail'
sounded every hour across the level
fields cf Beleium. i
As for the cathedral, one could '
stand inside and look up at roof;
which was HVe a sieve, while the:
inferior was filled with stones, frag-:
meats of marble statues from the !
tombf. charred wood that had once !
been the wonderful carved roof, rags"
of burnt canvas that had been beauti-!
fjl pictures, broken glass of wonder-'
ful color that tad been the famous
painted windows.
Such was Ypres after the first bom-
barrtirent. Who'e streets bad bea de-!
stroyed. yet there were still bouses'
where people could live; there was ;
still a broken skeleton of what had i
been a town. j
For six months Ypres was left its
comparative peace: shells st5!I fell in
the town at irregular Intervals, but it
was possible for people to live there!
and to open shops for the troops that '
parsed through to the battle line. j
The second bombardment began
without warninr on April ro. 1913.1
The fim shell fell in the "Great!
P'-are" when it was filled with people i
It is impossible today to get any ac-!
curate estimate of the loss of life !
caused by that first shell, but those
who ssw it still blxD-h and tremble1
with the mere memory of it. It was
a heavier shell than any that had1
been used In the first bombardmftat. .'
coming rrom one of the giant siege'
guns. It could be heard for 10 sec-'
onds in the air. the noise of it grow-;
ing as it came. like the sound of an '
express train. When it fell the thick j
smoke or its explosion rose 200 feet1
high. I
The fnll storm of the bombardment'
burst 48 hours later, accompanied by I
the rirst weves of poisoned ras used,
arainn the French and British lines.
Day and night for a long period the!
great shells poured into the town in
a steady stream, while above streets'
and squares and fields hung a sinls-'
ter cloud, gas. and smoke and dust. 1
W?ien this bombardment ceased It!
was hardly possible to find one's wayi
through the town. Houses and streets ,
had all melted together in heaps of
rubbish. The one or two walls which
still rtood only seized to emphasize1
the desolation; a few frarments of the.
church wall and tower, with their,
pointed arches, the remains of a bet-,
fry. a scarred fragment of the facade 1
of the Cloth fcalL From these ruins i
one could locate where the most Im
portant buildlps of the city bad stood
and could estimate the completeness
cf te mfn.
Sa Ypres remained for two more
years. The Germans completed their
destruction during the past spring and
srtnirer. emorjne th i,t recgnirb'e
restires of anythine by turning beaw
,u.-rcm snens arainst the pa-
l-,T y tne end or jt than.
was literally nothing left except dut
asd broken stones. That is all that
now remains of the famous town or
jres.
