Time Question on Ballots
CHICAGO, April 1. Complete un
official vote for mayor gave Thomp
son, republican, 157,888; Sweitzer,
democrat, 140,288; Hoyne, indepen
dent democrat, 110,898. Thompson's
plurality is 17,600.
CHICAGO, April 1. Mayor William
Hale Thompson, republican, was re
elected today In one of the most excit
ing political struggles the city ever
witnessed, the incomplete unofficial
returns late tonight Indicating that his
plurality -would be in the neighborhood
of 15.000. His nearest opponent was
Robert M. Sweitzer, democrat county
clerk, w&uiu the itmor- deTcateu four
years ago by a plurality of more than
147.000.
Much of the big vote which the may
or', received four years ago but lost
today went to State's Attorney Maclay
Hoyne, a democrat who ran as an in
dependent by petition.
The mayor's triumph was the sub
ject of noisy celebration tonight by
his followers.
700,000 Ballots Cast
The election, in which six candi
dates ran for mayor, fell on an ideal
day, with sunshiny cool weather and
the total vote cast, it was estimated,
was about 700,000 out of a registered
vote of nearly. 800,000.
The city voted "wet" by a sweeping
majority, the first time the question
had been voted on in Chicago. The
liquor adherents made a campaign
based on the slogan "let congress hear
your protest." The vote was three to
one or better in favor of saloons. The
Dry Chicago Federation made no con
certed campaign, relying on national
legislation. The "wet and dry" ques
tion was placed on the ballot by order
of the state supreme court which
found that the "dry" petition had been
kept off the ballot illegally at the pre
ceding city election.
Virtually all interested in the elec
tion was centered in the mayoralty
fight, although other city offices, in
cluding one aldeman from each of the
35 wardB, were elected.
War Record Issue
The mayor made his campaign on
his record in office and on pleas for
republican party support on the basis
of national party lines. His principal
opponents, Sweitzer and Hayne, the in
dependent, both severely criticized the
mayor and referred to "Thompsonism"
and his war record. . The mayor's ref
erence to Chicago as "the sixth Ger-
man city." his refusal to issue an in-

STRIKE SITUATION IN
BERLIN, IS SERIOUS
BERLIN, April 1 (By the Associated
Press). Although the majority social
ists claimed today that it was untrue
that prepondering numbers of miners
had joined the "miners union" experts
admitted that; the situation was fairly
serious. Throughout the Ruhr district
the workmen are willing to work but
are powerless in the face of the Spar
tacans'and have joined in their de
mands for a 50 per cent Increase in
wages and three hundred marks bon
us. The Bochum miners are striking
because the mine owners refuse to
pay them the same wages for a six
hour day .as ofr a seven and a half
hour day.
The National' Zeitung claims that
Richard Mueller and two other mem
bers of the German executive coun
cil visited Judge Weismann, who or
dered the arrest of Ernest Daumig,
president of the executive committee1
of the soldiers and workmen's coun-
ell of Greater eBrlin and notified him
that a general strike would be order
ed unless Daumig was speedily liber

threatened to strike.

Food administration officials ex

never exercised any control over the

The president's action regarding the
packers, officials said, - released the
industry from supervision of every
kind txercvised by the food adminis

margins of profit. These profits, it
was said, were limited to 9 per cent
on total annual business and about 2
per cent on the turnover on meats.
It was pointed out, however, that
the mandatory features of the Lever
act, under which the industry was
controlled, prohibited unfair practices,

force, but under the authority of fed

made by United States district attor

While the only information concern

to the food administration in a brief

which is still the foremost subject be
fore Premier Lloyd Gecrrge. . Clemen

standpoint which offers some pros
pect of agreement.
The first plan, was to give France
economic control of the Saare coal
fields so as to offset damage to the
ccal mines cf northern France. France
was not to have political control over
the large German population In the
Saare valley which would remain with
Germany. This proved objectionable
and one of the chief causes of the
council of four's inaction. The main
objection was the divided control, by
which France would be unable to op
erate the mines ewwectively, and en
force authority when the Germans
were exercising political control.
The new plan therefore, seek? to
combine French economic and politi
cal authority for e temporary period
until
the productive capacity of the
mines in northern France is restored,
industrial production revived and the
nrostration due to the war eadi- It
is estimated that five years will be
required to restore the mines to nor

of the length'of the propose joint con

Palmer has disproved the charge
that a "jack of all trades ya master of

U COL ROOSEVELT,
LIKE FATHER, CASTS
HIS "HAT Hi RING"
Son of Late Elx-President
Announces Intention of
Entering Politics
NEW YORK, April 1. Lieutenant
Colonel Theodore Rooseveit, who has
been discussed by . republican party
leaders in this city as a possible can
didate for he president of the board
pf alderman next fall, announced to
day that he intended to follow the
footsteps of his father and enter poli
tics. He " declineA- to state, however,
whethq rthe aldermanic berth would
prove acceptable to him, in case he
received a formal invitation to run for
that office, asserting that it was too
soon lor him to pick his initial goal.
He added that he was announcing his
"hat was in the ring" only because
he inteded to retire from business and
considered some explanation neces
sary- His present activities, he said
were confined to organization In this
country of the world war veterans'
association. ; ,
In making known his intention to
retire from business, Lieutenant Col
onel Roosevelt said he desired to de
vote himself "to public life," by which
he said he meant "entering politics.'
Of his aspirations he said:
" "They depend on what the public
wishes me to do. I naturally am
anxious to do what work I may be
called upon to do in my own state
in tne state in wncill my latner was
born, and where we have always
lived. Beyond! that I don't see what
I can say.
"I believe strongly in the princi
ples of my father. I believe strongly
In the principles of universal military
service, and I jb&ieve strongly in.' un
diluted nationalism.'' '-'
The business from which Colonel
Roosevelt purposes to retire, is bank
ing, for, after having been discharged
from the service, he reairued to a
Wall street office with which he was
associated before being appointed a
major of infantry in the officers' re
serve corps by President Wilson in
1917. Previously he had been con
nected with the' Hartford Carpet cor
poration of Thompsonville, Conn.,
whence he went after being graduated
from Harvard in 190S.

No Extra Session Needed for

Suit involving the property of the
"Warren Ranch, situate dthree miles
below Warren, half way between the
Country. club and the Osborn station,
was filed yesterday in the superior
court of Cochise county by Hoval A.
Smith, one of the stockholders in the
Warren Ranch company .against the
Warren Ranch company, a corpora
tion, the Garden Development com
pany, a corporation, H. B. Hovland,
E. B. Frawley and George C. Ililzinger.
The suit is over disposition of the
lands of the Warren ranch and of
the water now being utilized on the
Warren ranch irrigated acreage.
The suit grows out of the attempt
on the part of H. B. Hovland and the
Garden Development company to set
up a new tract of small acre homes
on the east side o fthe Osborn-Warren
railroad, and seeks to annul the lease
of the Garden Development company
from the Warren Ranch company of
this acreage and ask-s a temporary
. injunction restraining the Garden De
velopment company from a nattempt
to exercise its rights or do anything
under the lease.
Public Is Warned.
Simultaneous with the filing of the
suit notice of the pendency of the
action was recorded in the office of
the county recorder with the purpose
of giving notice of the action to any
persons who might be prospective set
tlers on the lands. j
The history of the case dates back
several years to the formation of the
Warren Ranch company by Smith and
norland, the two largest holders of
stock in the project. Immediately
after the ranch company was formed
the owners obtained from the Calu
met & Arizona Mining company an
.indeterminate lease of all waters
pumped from the company's mines
in the Warren district. This water
is carried to the ranch by a flume,
running from Bisbee, through Lowell
and Warren, and emptying into the
company's ditches near the Warren
district country club.
Within the past few months, the
action! sets .forth, Hovland has se
cured control of the boar dof direc
tors of the Warren Ranch company.
Meantime the Garden Development
company has been formed anu lands
of the Warren Ranch company have
, been leased to the development com
pany Jor the purpose of setting up a
colony of small, irrigated sections of
land below the Country cinb.
Planned Residence Tract.
The plan of the Garden Develop
ment company is to set up streets
and grades on the land3 east o fthe
railroad, track, park the lands, and
lease them for periods of twenty-five
years to residents of this district and
others.- Waters which heretofore
have gone to the irrigated lands of
the Warren company would then be
diverted to the leasees o fthe De
velopment company property.
' Smith, plaintiff in the action, sets
up as causes for annulment of the
lease and granting of the temporary
injunction that it is beyond the pow
er of the ranch board of directors to
make the lease; that the lease
amounts to a gift of the ranch com
pany property to the development
company; that no adequate considera
tion is offered for the ranch company
losses; that the ranch company, with
the present property under irrigation,
is worth. in the neighborhood of 200,
000, and that with the water diverted
and applied to the leased lands the
present value of the now cultivated
lands practically would be destroyed;
that the effect of the contract will be
to turn over the management and
control of the ranch company to the
development company and ao abandon
the purposes of the ranch company;
that the lease has been made by Hov
land, in "control of the Ranch com
pany board of directors, without the
authority of the stockholders or no-
tice tn thfi nlaintiff s-hn Mmcolf (. n
- r - . . . . uv .iiiii.iLi i o & ;

the lease, covering ,the surface of 37
patented mining claims, will in effect
destroy teh ' value' of the claims as
mining property turoug'u the 25-year
period of the lease,' and will prevent
the development an' doperation of the
claims. i
Contention of the plaintiff is that
diversion of the waters which in the
past have made a garden of the War
ren ranch and which have kept sev
eral hundred acres of the ranch prop
erty on the west aide or the railroad
track under cultivation, will deprive
these lands now under irrigation of
waters which will be Jrer'.eu to the
new lands." The section of the ranch
which would be opened up under the
development company project is now
desert land, from which the sage and
grease wocJ have never been cut.

Never Put It On Before Re
tiring, Advises "Girl of
Golden Apple."
By 'Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the Golden Apple."
Sould women use powder?
Of course they should if they
are careful in the selection of the
powder and know how to use it
properly. A great many women
do not know how to use it or
what kind to use.
In the first place, very little
powder should be used. It should
never be put on before retiring
for the night. It should be put on
only when finishing the toilet.
Fcr women who have greasy
skins, powder should be used
alone. For those who have nat
urally dry skins, a natural fat,
such as vaseline, lanolin, glycer
ine, or a good cream should first
Je nsed, very moderately, i3
soften and moisten the skin, and
the powder put on lightly after
ward. . . ,
The harmless .' powders are
made from wheat starch, coi-n,
rice, powder of almonds from
which the oil has been removed,
orris root, carbonate of magnesia
op chalk, talcum . and "oxide of
zinc.
A mixture of rice powder and
talcum is perhaps the best. Omy
the best is good enough for the .
skin. Rice powders are often
adulterated with phosphate of
chalk, alabaster, plaster, or even
white lead. Be sure you know
what is in the powder jrou use,
and then use it lightly and ar
tistically to put the finishing
touch to the toilet.

William H. Ragsdale, naturalization

taries. Many orientals, now held eligi-.
ble for citizenship because of their
army service, are expected to attend
the schools.
WASHINGTON April 1. Confi
dnce in the financial condition of the
country and its ability to float forth
coming Victory Liberty loan was ex
pressed today by Secretary Glass, in
replying to the suggestion of Senator
Calder of New York that a special
session of congress should be called
to stop depreciation in the market
price of Liberty loans.
Far from agreeing tnat the decline
in outstanding bonds might jeopardie
the popular campaign for flotation of
the Victory issue this month thereby
tying up credits and forcing the banks.
to take the new bonds, Mf. Glass de
clared that he was assured the treas
ury's efforts t solve the financial
problems of the country would have
th support of a "united and victo
rious people.'" Depreciation In bonds,
he said ,has been the result of arti
ficial causes and he knew of no one
who did not believe that all Liberty
bonds would sell above par before
matprity.
"There is today no Insufficiency of
credit for the needs of any useful
nor Insufficiency of gold to support
i our credit structure," Secretary Glass
j declared. '
Political Fight Echoed.
Echoes of the political fight which
occupied the- closing of congress were"
contained in the secretary's reply,.
rwhich was in the form of a letter
to the New York senator. He quoted
from a speech by Seijato rCalder on
the Victory Liberty bond bill, in
which he declared Uiat he saw no
reason "why we should feel certain of
the future."
Mr. Glass said there had been no
adverse ' developments since the bill
was passed, which would make nec
essary a special session as Mr. Cal
der advocate".
Already commerce and industry be
gin to show signs of the renewed life
which must follow the removal of the
restraints and interferences which
war made necessary," Mr. Glass said.
"The war is won. Our present na
tional debt of less than $25,000,000,
000 and our ultimate, debt after the
war bills are paid, which ought not in
any event to exceed $30,000,000,000,
against which we shall hold some
$10,000,000,000 of obligations of for
eign governments, is the barest f rac-1
j tion of our national resources. The J
iie'ation of our ' debt to Our popula-;
tion and resources Is small, indeea,'
compared to tha of any of the great
countries of Europe.
Dollar. at Premium.
"The discontinuance of government
interference, with the foreign . ex
changes made possible .by the cessa
tion of hostilities' ha demonstrated
the true position of dollar exchange,
which not only is at a" premium in
relation to the qufrencles of all of
the European countries which were
engaged t nthe war, but has approach
ed par or actually reported a pre
mium with respect to the currencies
of European neutrals.
"Our reserve at the greatest in
amount in the world, the greatest in
relation to circulation and deposit in
any of the countries which were en
gaged in the war, was on March 28,
1919, 51.9 per cent of the-combined
federal reserve note' an ddeposit lia
bilities of the federal reserve banks.
This compares most favorably with a
combined reserve of 49.8 per cent on
November 8, 1918, dust, before the.
I armistice was signed, particularly in
! view of the fact that since that date
the government's expenditures for the
most part growing out o fthe wart
have approximated $S,000,000,000, the'
greater part of which has necessarily
been provided by the sale of treasury I
certificates o findebtedness to the1
banking institutions of the country! j
Expenses to Shrink.
"The government's expenditures,
which shortly after the armistice

000,000,000 In a month, should after
the war bills have been paid, srink!
j quickly back to say $2,000,000,000 a

j "The liquidation which has taken '
place in Liberty bonds since the armi

the interest rate and terms of the

the fact that -many patriotic Ameri

COUNCIL PLANS RAIL
GUARDS FOR SUBWAY
The regular meeting of he city
council was held last night. Owing
to the absence of Mayor J. Erickson
and the city engineer, no business of
importance was discussed." It was of
fered as a suggestion by one of the
councilmen that the city purchase old
rails for the purpose of building raij
protection at. the edge of all unpro
tected subways. It was added that it
would be cheaper to erect such means
for protection than have the city loose
more damage suits filed by person

lack of proper protection. It was voted
on and passed that the city pay the

educational institutions. The govern
ment meets part of the expense and
the state meets part, so that the stu
dent does not have to pay any sum for
the training he receives. 1
It is the desire of Professor Gordon I
to build up several strong classes ot
local boys who are willing to start in

High Expectorations
Army canteen figures recently compiled show that -95 per cent of
the enlisted men" smoke; some 80 per cent prefer the cigaret; the rest
cling to the old dudeen, despite its many diadvantages; as those who
have tried to nest an eight-ounce pipe in a. form-fitting uniform may
testify.
"Where on earth have all the oid time Americans gone? We refer
to the generation that partook of eating tobacco.
Prom eclonial days the quid was the American brand. Our English
visitors, who came over and gazed upon our spittoons, went home duly
impressed, and some of the brightest chapters In foreign books of travel
of the day were those dealing with the American back-woodsman's abil
ity to drown the slyly peering rat in his corner 40 rods, or was it feet,
anyway? x -
What has become of the old fashioned saint, who sat in the amen
corner and browsed on his cud through the service with anry. one
spit? -
Can it be that the rural stoves no longer hiss through the winter
nights? '
Are the relative merits o ffine cut, and honey dew twist, and nat
ural leai, and cabin hunk no longer discassed by experts?
Has one of our fine old pioneer customs gone, never to return?
We hope not, we hope not. They are taking too dura much of the
simple, solid, homely,, old wool out of our national weave and leaving
us with a It of shoddy. '
Chin whiskers and eating tobacco; how that combination appealed to
our boyhood imagination, and how up-stage we strutted on our little
. notive heath when iwe shed a front tooth and could squirt corn silk
juice almost as far. as gran'pap.
And to our. mind, even yet, there is a benignity, a homely dependa
bility, aye a Christian friendliness,' about the town squire, with his
egg-sized cud nested down behind his whiskers, v He was a plain,
simple citizen who had in. him no guile.
Picture him in spat3, with a cigaret! -
We hope the boys get back home 'before their manners are en
tirely corrupted, and they lose all taste for the native, humble pleasures
cf the countryside. . .
Father Plans
Now cometh the season of the Garden Catalogue when father spends
his evenings mooning through the beautifully colored views of holly
hocks, sweet peas, turnips, beets and so forth and mother watches him
askance, fearful that this year he may decide to dig up the front lawn
for a garden patch or. buy the apparatus for growing some red cabbages
under, glass in the parlor. There'B really no telling' how father will break
out when he becomes a subject of self-hypnosis- through perusal of
seed company's enticing offerings. .
He generally figures, on buying J142 worth of seeds. . Of course
this is more than enough to plafttf a twelve-afire meadow and father
has space for only a four by; five foot garden, but: there are so many
delightful varieties of pleasure" flowers and utilitarian plants that he
declares it is absolutely impossible to cut down on his list. Lrother
suggests that father solve the difficulty by having a double or. triple
decker garden with layers of earth on stilts, a la the bunks o? transport.
And. while father seriously considers the-proposition,-the lamily has a
hearty laugh on him. , -
' At last as the time for planting creeps nearer and nearer father, upon
the urgent request of the family and with his common sense finally
on the job, cuts down his purchase to about $ 6. He sends off his check
with a beatific smile. '
"You'll lose all your interest before the seeds come, says mother,
sorrowfully. " "You won't even plant them!" ; -
"Oh. yes I will,' says father. "It's going to be different this year."
Mother -emiles a wry smile. That's what you've been saying every
year for the past 15 years!" she declares.
The Borderland Question '
Whether the Borderland Route shall be switched from Davidson
Canyon to eBnscn, will be deeided at a joint meeting of the boards of
supervisors of Pima and Ccchlse counties with the highway commissions
and state engineer sometime next week at Tucson. ' ......
The fact that . the state engineer is considering-. expending. Pima's
allotment of state money this year on. the road from Tucson to the Rillito
would indicate that he is not figuring on co-operating with Pima county
on building The road from Vail toward Benson.. To spend the money, on
the latter road, be would have to declare it a state highway and abandon .
the Davidson canyon route. .
There. Is a great deal of sentiment in Tucson in favor of keeping the
Borderland just where it is. It is highly probable, that the Bankhead
National Highway will follow the present route as It. runs within six
miles of Fort Huachuca and the route' by way of Benson leaves this
important bearing on the question; . " ',: ,
Te Bankhead locators will leave El Paso the latter part pf April
to inspect routes across New Mexico and . Arizona. . We think it would
be a great mistake to even consider changing the Borderland before they
have had an opportunity to make' their report; It might haVe an -important
bearing cn, the question. . . 4. :. . ' '
Of course Tucson wants a splendid road to Benson. That Is why
Pima county has voted $40,000 bonds, for the purpose and" If this is
not sufficient, more money will be forthcoming. There is no great
necessity bwever, for switching the Borderland to this route. Let the
state finish the road through Davidson Canybn and east of Empire Ranch.
Pima county will take care of the Benson route. Tucson Citizen.
Says the Yuma Sun: "Frank M. Green, aged. 36, arid born in Illinois,
was wed to Miss Ethel Jamison, age 23. who first .saw. the light of day
at Salt Lake, Utah, by Justice Smith." Queer how far Miss Jamison and
Justice Smith have traveled in the game direction.
The Prescott Courier suggests that residents of the Mile High city
should take their annual baths on Prescott's annual clean-up day, since
"city teams will carry away the rubbish free of charge."'
If names mean nothing, this item from the Miami Silver Lelt is
harmless. Otheiwise we might imagine a frame-up. "Mr. and Mrs.
Johnnie Bean of Moonshine Hill left for the coast." '
We take thi3 from the Somerton News of the Yuma Sun, for those
jTio are good at figures. "The high cost of living has at last been solved
by A. A. Moody. During this time of high prices when milk of dubious
quality as well as, quantity keeps reaching skyward and continues to
become less milk and more water, it is mighty nice to go out in the
yard and milk a goat. Mr. Moody purchased a goat about five months
ago, paying the sum cf J50 for it. Up to this time the animal has
consumed four bales of (hay and is eating oh the fifth. And in the
meantime Mr. Moody is receiving five and a half quarts of milk a day,
worth 30 cents a quart. Pretty good for one little goat." .
The Arizona Star (Tucson) suggests that Phoenix "the careful
p:ototype of Los Angeles," now seeking to get away from the daylight
saving plan "will be using the new time before the season Is far ad
vonced." t

MrJ. BROPHY, MANAGER
OF DEPARTMENT STORE,
TO LEAVE DISTRICT
Pioneer Resident Resigns Po
sition and Prepares to Move
to Oakland
M. J. Brophy, manager of the Phelps
Dodge store and allied branches fn the
Warren district for seven .years, has
resigned his position and will leave
the district for his future home in Oak
land, Calif., about April 15. He will
be succeeded by George B. Winfrey,
formerly sales manager, of a Kansas
City grocery house. El C. Campbell,
for 15 years employed in the locai
store and is now manager of tiie
wholesale grocery departments, will
assist Mr. Winfrey.
Mr. Brophy has been a resident of
the Warren district for 35 years, 30
of which he has been connected wit,h
the Phelp3 Dodge company. It has
been largely through his efforts that
the concern has succeeded, and his departure-
from the company will leave
a desk vacated which' has for years
found him untiringly working. . 1
' Mr. Brcphy. was born in Ireland. At
the age of 23 yea'rs? in 1SS2,' he took
passage for the United States, with
San Francisco as his destination, and
for one year after arriving' b.9 worked
In the Bay City. He then came to Ari
zona, locating in the then thriving
pioneer mining camp of Tombstone. In
18S4 he removed. to Bisbee, which was
just beginning to grow into a mining
camp, and for two years was employed
in the Copper Queen mines. Netx he
was given a clerkship in' one of the
company stores, and from this position
he gradually worked up until he be
came manager.
Departure of Mr. Brophy from the
district takes away one. mere of the
real pioneer citizens who have, aided
in building up the several towns here,
afid thins put further the. ranks of the
"old timers" who came when Bisbee
was a cross-burro-trails prospect.

Going Through Life
Without Husband
LONDON. April 1. There are
one and a half million women in
this country who win- never have
the chance of getting married, is
the statement of Miss Norah
March, editor of National Health.
In 1917 there was a surplus of
1,337,000 marriageable " women
over marriageable men, and since
then there have j been the war
casualties of 1918.
Miss March says that emigra
tion will remove a few of these
surplus women, while economic in
dependence will prevent women
from marrying men for the sake
of a home.
"Many men and women in this
age of modern advancement,' says
Miss March, "are getting different
views from those held in the past,
and regard women's right to moth
erhood as a supreme individual
prerogative. Having such a wide
choice of wives, the question re
mains as to whether the men will
chose the best and strongest wo
men, as upen the women will de
pend largely the future human
race, since the best of manhood
has been' cut off. The choice
really rests with the woman, for
with her 1s the right of refusing
an offer of marriage." -

U.S, ASKED TO PROBE
DEPORTATION FROM
' CUBA OF DELEGATES
Porto Rican Tobacco Work
ers held in Havana as
Bolsheviki
SAN JUAN. Porto Rico. March 13.
(Correspondence of the Associated
Press.) The United States govern
ment is being asked to investigate the
detention at Havana and subsequent
deportation from Cuba of Ramon Bar
rios and Alfred Negrin, delegates from
the Porto Rican tobacco workers, who
went to Cuba to study working condi
tions of their trade in that island on
behalf of the Porto Rican Tobacco
Workers' union.
Barries and Negrin, who are Amer
ican citizens and who were provided
with passports from Porto Rico, have
arrived here after their deportation.
They say they were held in absolute
isolation as bolsheviki at Havana for
six days and that the Cuban auth
orities refused t permit them to com
municate either with legal advisors or
with the American minister. . .
They declare they were searched by
the Havana police, that their letters of
introduction and other documents
were taken and that they were kept in
a political prison. They were inform
ed, they say, that it was useless for
them to write letters to the American
minister for . if they . did, the letters
would not leave the hands of the au
thorities. The two delegates of Porto
Rico assert that they protested be
cause they were given no opportunity
to be heard by the United States au
thorities, that they, refused to sign
deportation papers and that the police
officials then called in two detectives
and ordered them to sign the papers
for the prisoners. They arrived at
Havana on February 17 and were de
ported on February 22. Meanwhile, ap
peals had been made to Washington in
their behalf by both houses of the Por
to Rican legislature but the local au
thorities received word that the mes
sage was not received in Washington
until after the two men had been re
leased. 41

I'll Praise Tanlac as Long as
I Live, She Says Was
In Bed Ten Long
v Months
"I'll praise Tanlac trie longest day
I live for giving me back my health,"
said Mrs. B. . W. Smith pf 3113 Bur
dett street, Omal-ji, Neb., recently,
when the special Tanlac representa
tive, who had heard of her remarkable
recovery, called to ascertain the facts.
. 'Eight years ago." continued Mrs.
Smith, "I began suffering from stom-i
ach trouble, loss of appetite and nerv-j
ousness. My head ached so at times
it felt like it would jump from my
shoulders. Then acute rheumatism got
hold cf me, and pained me so I could
not sleep. My feet, knee joints and
elbows would swell terribly and the
pain was almost unbearable. Before I
took Tanlac I had not beeu, up and
about, nor able to go down town for
three long years, and was in bed for
ten months perfectly helpless. I was
under treatment every day for three
months, and I tried everything -until
the bills got so big I dreaded to thin:
of them, but I never got able to be
out of bed but very little.
"I suffered until I lost 35 pouncs,
but I have gotten back every ounce of
it siuce I began taking Tanlac. Pret
ty soon after I started on it my ap
petite came back, and I got so could
eat anything. My nerves got stronger,
and iny pain commenced to get less.
After the second bottle I felt much
stronger, and it wasn't long before I
could get about the house and do my
work- I haven't a pain of any kind
now, and my sleep is as sound and
restful as a baby. I am full of life and
energy and feel fully able to go down
town when I please, as I can walk and
stay on my feet all day. In fact I can
do as much work as I ever could in my
life, if not more, and I just feel so
happy over what Tanlac has done for
me that I want everybody to know
about Jt. I have told lots of people
about it alrcaJy and khow many wno
are taking it on account of what it
has done for me." .

BALLOONS USED AS
BUOYS TO MARK AIR
" MAIL PLANE COURSE
Emergency Landing Grounds
Provided Along Long
distance Route
LONDON, March 3. (Correspond
ence, of the Associated Press.) Bal
loons are used, as buoys above the
clouds to , mark the course of the
long distance . airplane mail service
from Marquise, near Boulogne, France,
to t Cologne, Germany, says an
announcement of the Royal Air force,
which Is operating this service. Each
balloon is marked with signs to indi
cate to the airplane pilot its exact
locality anJ thus enable the pilots to
shape their course anew when the
weather is bad or the clouds are very
low. The balloons also mark the
landing grounds for the airplanes. Ob
servers in the balloons are required
to report the condition of weather
above the cloud layer, trie speed and
direction of wind and fto pass this in
formation to the nearest wireless sta
tion lor transmission to the airplane
pilots.
Chain of Stations.
A chain of wireless stations has
been organized along the routes for
the. transmission of weather reports
and I fthe pilot of an airplane is com
pelled to make a forced landing he is
expected to report this location by
wireless or telephone, to the nearest
station so that a motor truck can be
dispatched to recover the mails and
render assistance to the airplane.
A3 it is the intention of the Royal
Air Force to maintain a night mail
service on this route, a chain of "light
houses also has been established and
alter, it is announced, the balloons
will be fitted for carrying signal lights
and remaining alofl at night as a fur
ther guide to the pilots.
Should a pilot lose his way in the
clouds, arrangements have been made
whereby he will be able to get in com
munication with a wireless station
from which he can receive directions
how to proceed to the nearest landing
ground. This w ireless guidance is ex
pected .to be used , in bad Weather or
.n night flying.
Emergency Stops
Emergency landing grounds have
been located along the route in addi
tion to "the regular terminals and the
airplanes carry plgeoiis to be used as
messengers in case of accidenL
This through service from Marquise
to Cologne presents difficulties, be
cause of the range of mils 2,000 feet
high between the flat country, of
Northern France and the valley of the
Rhine. This stretch of hilly country
has few places suitable for landing
and pilots flying above it frequently
encounter clouds and bad weather.
The Royal Air Force has for some
time been carrying mail regularly be
tween. Marquise and Valenciennes and
Namur, Belgium; and between Valen
ciennes and Spa. the headquarters of
the armistice commission.

LOWER WHEAT PRICE
SOOII PREDICTED BY
U, S. FOOD OFFICIALS
Restrictions on Imports May
tJe Lifted to Cut Cost

Lower Fare to

Is Promised
First Reduction on War Taxes
Announced as Pullman

. NEW YORK. April 1. While there

Dour," the United States food adminis
tration grain corporation intends to do
everything in its power to reduce
prices to the government buying level,
which necessarily must be reached
when "the new enormous crop begins
to move into the markets within 90
days," according to a statement here
tonight by Julius H. Barnes, president!
of the-corporation.
Referring to the fact that recent
continuous advances in wheat' prices
paid in western markets apparently
contradict statements frcm the indus
trial stabilization board at Washing
ton that lower food prices could be ex
pected in the near guture, Mr. Barnes!
said: I
"The reason for this seems to be I.
that current deliveries of wheat from;
the farm have been insufficient for
milling needs." He added that "al
though the grain corporation has r
sold from its accumulated holdings
within the last two weeks practically
40,000,000 bushels of wheat, the price
has been only moderately held in
check."
"Fortunately," he continued, "Amer
ica has a surplus of rye and barley
and oats, and in order to relieve the
strain of foreign buying upon our mar
kets, we have advised the neutral gov
ernments that America will be unable
to furnish any more wheat or wheat
flour to them; that they are free to
buy these other grains in our market,
but must send their ships for wheat
to other sources of supply.
"Also, commencing next week, the
grain corporation will buy, for ship
men in relief to liberated countries m
Europe, rye flour, corn, oats and bar
ley flour and will thereby reduce its
current purchases of wheat flour.
"Should all these factors fail to con
trol the price of flour in the United

Goldworthy, director of the rail

here.
Goldworthy, recently at
tended a meeting of railroad of
ficials, on the coast, said that it
was intimated there that excur-.
sicn fares formerly operative be
tween Phoenix and the coast
would go into effect again this
season. He said that plans also
had been discussed ior the re
establisliment of excursion rates
to the east. These raies mean a
saving of approximately 20 per
cent on round trip tickets.
PHOENIX. April 1. The first
reduction on war taxes was an
nounced here today, wren it was
made public at the raliroad ad
ministration ticket office that a
cut of 7 cents had been made on

rate, was 33 cents and the new;

WASHINGTON. April 1. Secretary
Baker announced today that he had
been forced to abandon hopes he has
entertained that a victory parade"of
three distinctive . fighting divisions
might be arranged to take place in
Washington. The divisions h& had
hoped to assemble for the purpose, he
said, were the First, representative of
the old regular army, and the first
to land in' France; the Second, whicbj
includes the marine brigade, and thej

unit built up from the forces of most
of the states.
' The secretary- said experience had
shown that it would be impossible to!

forced to limit the review to the 42nd i
division alone. Plans for divisional
parade of that organization, it is un

Whether this will even be practicable
has not yet been decided.

RESOLUTION AGAINST
LOBBYING OPPOSED
AT CLUB CONVENTION
Action of State Federation at
Yuma Criticized by
Wpmen
PHOENIX April 1 Opposing a
resolution against all 'lobbying"
adopted by the federation of women's
clubs at Yuma last week, Mrs. J. L
B. Alexander, at the central Arizona
district federation convention today,
declared that vCmen must solicit votes
of legislators if they expect favorable
action on bills in which they are in
terested. Mrs. Alexander's stand was
supported in an address by Mrs. J. W.
White of Chandler.
"It is only by repeatea and consist
ent work. said Mrs. Alexander, "that
we can hope to accomplish the ob
jects cought by our endorsement of
legislation.
"There is a marked distinction be
tween lobbying and legitimate presen
tation of petitions and the presenta
tion of arguments on pending legisla
tion never is denied the people. Wo
men of other state federations, not
ably. Indiana and California, recognize
the benefits of personal work ' with
legislators and maintain a strong leg
islative committee at the capitol.
."Another consideration . is our op
portunity by the ballot to send to
the. legislature - only such men and
women as we know will not only vote
for, but will work actively for moral,
humanitarian and 'social betterment
legislation.' " - i
Mrs. H. A. Guild, president of the
state federation, discussed, the rela
tion of the district to the state federa
tion and pointed out the necessity of
the district federation in Arizona,
where clubs are widely scattered.

LONDON, April 1. The cost of liv
ing for'a workingman's family in Eng
land was nearly doubled during the
war, according to & statement issued
by the ministry of food. The ministry
bases its estimates upon that of a
committee headed by Lord Dumner,
which reported that in 1914 the aver-!
age weekly expenditure for food for a
working-class family of six persons
was the equivalent of $6.12. The min
istry estimates that the cost has now
advanced to $11.81 a week.
The ministry echoes the statement
cf Premier Lloyd George forecasting
that the workingman's cost of living
vonld be reduced about $1 a week
this summer.

LONDON, March. 3. (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press.) Just
as soon as aircraft regulations have
been difinitely arranged by the peace
conference, an airplane passenger and
freight service will be inaugurated be
tween the principal cities 'of England
and the continent, it Is announced.
It will be an experiment only insofar
as the whims of the public are con
cerned, as the fifteen machines to be
used all saw more trying service, in
night bombing work during the latter
months of the war.
There is no doubt in the minds of
the promoters that the project will be
popular at first ahong tnose who en
joy adventure and are not hampered
by lack of funds, but in making the
announcement of the new service, F.'
Handley P.age said that his company
wanted to put the service purely on
a business basis and that charges
wo,uld not be out of reach of the aver
age merchant, who might want goods
transported quickly or make quick
trips in Europe.
Announcement .of the flans was
made simultaneously with the first
public exhibition of a passenger ear
ning airplane in I-ondon. The plane
Is one of the night bombers with the
fuselage equipped to accommodate 17
passengers. It saw service over Ger
man cities, but appeared much differ
ent on exhibition. Kuge glass win
dows had been cut into the sides of
the fuselage showing tne saloon fitted
with" heavily upholstered leather
chairs lined on each side of the car
riage with narrow isle between.
Space is provided for 10 passengers
inside. The seventeenth one sits out
side in the very "bow" of the machine
in the seat formerly occupied by a
gunner.
The machine has a lifting capacity
of six and one-half tons exclusive or
its own weight, is fitted with four mo
tors .two tractors and two pushers,
and travels at an average speed of

DY REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 1. Better news
from abroad, more promising domes
tic trade conditions and signs of a re
laxed money market were of material
assistance in promoting the further
irregular advance of quoted values
on the stock exchange today.
Sentimental factors included the re
moval of federal restrictions against
the packing interests and the more
encouraging views entertained by
leading financial authorities regarding
general business prospects.
The market retained all of its long
established professional 'characteris
tics, however, pools extending their
operations into various channels, espe
cially leathei rand copper shares.

SPRING IS HERE
March Twenty-first the First Spring
Day.
According to scientists the first day
of spring is March 21, and now we are
really in spring. The flowers are bud

and here and there you can see a wee
bit of green on the trees. Everything
seems to breath with a desire to throw
off the shakles of winter clothing as
soon as possible.
Men especially are anxious to iress
lightly, although it is -very dangerous
to do so. You can't tell when a chilly
day may tcome right after a warm
spring day. Then you have a cold
and a good chance for either pneu
monia or the influenza. To avoid this
possibility, as well as to clean out the
system of the poisons which 'accumu
late In the system of the human being,
it is the best thing in the world for
you to take a good laxative such as
Laxcarin. Laxcarin is the spring
medicine of nature and will help you
to get over the uncertain and danger
ous days of spring. Cleanse your biood,
your stomach and your inner system
withia few laxcarin tablets and look
confidentially into the future. Use
harmless and unfailing rational and
well known efficacious medicine which
is known to thousands and thousands
of physicians and used.

PARIS, March 3 (Correspondence of

Clemenceau was opening his mail this

merely glancing at some letters, mak
ing short annotations on others, in a
fair way to dispose of his courier in
the usual few minutes. Suddenly, j
upon opening a somewhat soiled and;
cheap envelope the contents fell to ;
the floor with a metallic sound. j
The premier picked them up, .read
the letter slowly, then read it again, j
and then sat there staring at the paper;
with tears filling his eyes in spite of;
his efforts to suppress tiiem. The let- j
ter read: -
"They have not given ycu the wai j
c.css; here is mine. It has only two;
stats while you deserve two palms, but
it is the best I can offer; here it is."
It was signed: "An bid poilu."
And the "grand old man" of France,
who with dry eyes ias looked upon
the horrors of two- wars, picked up
the little rusty piece of metal ,the
ribben of which is soiled by the rain
of the trenches or bespattered with
the blood of its former owner ant?

had been viol ted in connection with
the reversion of the pardon.
Previous witnesses have testified
that the Ida ciunty grand jury, whicu
investigated the pardon, had voted in
dictments against Rathbun'a father
and brother, and. his attorney, George
Clark,, but that these were not return
ed when Rathbun agreed to set aside
the pardon and go to prison for life ' Queen
for criminal assault.
Kindig maintained the indictments
were of no value until they were actu
ally returned in court, and further de
clared he did not believe the evidence
sufficient to convict persons named,
and asserted it was common practice :
to grant immunity to some person in
securing the conviction of another.
When Representative Clark of Lynn
. tv asked Kindig whether he be
lieved a wrong had been done young
Rathbun was permitted to go to the
penitentiary for life while his attorney
was allowed to go free, the witness
replied:
' "I know he had attacked this girl in
a most outrageous manner; I knew he
attacked several other young girls who
were ashamed to appear in court and
tell their story. I knew he was guilty
of larceny and that he belonged in
the penitentiary and that's where we
put him."

but handles at its plants a very large
quantity of ore for other Interests.
By reason of the world-wide short
age of silver and the high prices,
American femelting has shown a large
revenue from its own silver produc
tion. Silver mining was a nimportant
revenue producer for the company be
fore the disturbances started in Mex
ico, but with conditions there becom
ing more settled, and with American
Smelting & Refining Company's "plants
in that country increasing operations,
the current year should show a much
larger production of silver in Mexico
than in 1918.
The American smelting plants last
year turned out 72,572 J506 ounces of
silver,- compared with 69,841,061
ounces in 1916.
According to a preliminary esimate
of the federal reserve board the total
silver production of the United States
and Mexico last year was 118,700,000
ounces. The 1918 production of- 72,
572,000 ounces by American Smelting,
therefore .figures out 61 per cent of
the total production of the United
