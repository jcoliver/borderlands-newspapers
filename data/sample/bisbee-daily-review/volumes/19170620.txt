Suffrage Clause Is Passed By
House of Commons; Op
ponents of Subject Point To
Action of Miss Rankin.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, June 19. The princi
ple of woman's suffrage was adopt
ed in the house of commons to
night by the overwhelming ma-,
jority of 330 votes. Sir Frederic
Banbury's amendment against the
proposal was rejected by 385 tt
56.
LONDON, June 19. The house or
commons tonight by a large majority
passed the final reading of the clause
in the electoral reform bill dealing
with the question of women's suffrage.
It is expected that a proposalnow will
be made that the franchise be confer-
red on women on the saifle basis as
men.
The majority by which the house of
commons reaffirmed its adhesion to
the ; principle of woman suffrage as
tonished the warmest supporters . of
the measures. They anticipated a vic
tory but none seem to imagine that
there would be such a sweeping tri
umph. , Miss Rankin Mentioned.
The members .evidently felt that the
subject long ago had been exhausted
and that nothing further could be said
than had been uttered in the woman
suffrage bills which already had been
passed by the house at various dates
on second reading.
The government left the question
to the unfettered judgment ofj the
house, not attempting to influence
opinion on it in the least degree. The
front benches of both Bides lacked
most of .their leading figures, and the
air of foregone conclusion hung over
the whole of the discussion.
The opponents oi tne measure
among other arguments made the best
they could of the reports received here
of the attitude of Miss Jeanette Ran
kin, the only woman representative
in the American congress, on the ques
tion of the entry of the United States
in to the war.
Opposition Fails.
Sir Frederick G. Banbury, unionist,
for instance described Miss Rankin as
having been hysterical and-unable to
vote, but this and other pleas against
the ability of women to exercise the
franchise fell on deaf ears and when
the division was called the members
trooped into the house with the aim
of putting an end once for all to a
question which they had made up
their minds no longer was an acade
mic one, by voting upon it as a live
issue. So assured were the support
ers of the measure of the tmteome of
the division that even the magnitude
of the majority in its favor did -not
mnta thorn In a-n iimiaiiol ri.TnnnRtni.
j i
tion when the figures were announced.
The decisive division is expected
Wednesday by the adoption of a pro
posal for the enfranchisement of wo
men of thirty years and upward as a
p9rt of the electoral reform bill.

LONDON, June 19. Vice Admi
ral William S. Sims, U. S. N., has
been appointed to take general
charge of the operations of the al
lied naval forces in Irish waters.
Admiral Sims will act in the ca
pacity while the British naval
commander is absent from his
post for a period, the official an
nouncement of his appointment
explains. The American admiral's
flag meanwhile has been hoisted
as the allied senior officer in these
waters.
New Reaches Capital.
WASHINGTON. June 19. A
brief message from London today
brought the navy department its
news of the appointment of Vice
Admiral Sims to command allied
naval forces in Irish waters dur
ing the absence of the commander
of that district. The department
had no other information as to the
new responsibilities placed upon
the American officer.
The Washington government
has given Admiral Sims wide pow
ers to enable him to meet any sit
uation that may arise. Because of
the distance from Washington to
the scene of operations, no effort
was made to hamper him with re
quirements that he report for or
ders. The admiral has full au
thority to act on his own initiative
in disposing the forces at his com
mand so as to secure the greatest
co-operation with the French and
British navies and also the maxi
mum efficiency in the battle
against German su" marines.

advices are the first to Indicate '
that he has been at sea with his
ships. The statement that Admi
ral Sims has noisted his flag as se
nior allied naval officer in Irish
waters led to much speculation as
to what American warship he
might be using as a flagship, as
presumably he would hoist his
flag only aboard an American ves
sel. The only facts disclosed by
the department as to vessels now
in European waters have been
that destroyers have been sent to
British, ports and the naval collier
Jupiter to a French port with sup
plies. Tremendous responsibi 1 i t i e s
have been placed on Admiral
Sims' shoulders. The tale of tor
pedoed ships in Irish waters is an
oft-repeated one. It has been said
that even without the American
vessels, the British have had thou
sands of ' destroyers, submarine
chasers of all sizes and kinds,
mine sweepers, aircraft, and every
other known method of combat
ting submarines posted in these
waters in the effort to keep open
the shipping lanes.
In some quarters, it was pointed
out that the announcement that
the American officer had been
placed, even temporarily, in com-,
mand of British forces greatly su
perior to those under the Ameri
can flag in those waters might
have a political effect in Ireland,
where the situation is turbulent
with the approach of the Irish con
vention period. It might tend to
show beyond question, it was sug
gested, that the British and Amer
ican governments were in perfect
accord.

has called a strike on tne mines, so
that they were afraid to report for
work on the night shift. The mines,
it was said, could use on the day shift
all of the men who reported for work.
It was indicated that no strike
breakers would be used. Strikes called

who were employed by the mining
companies, were called out. This fol
lowed the refusal by ttie mining com

declared that unless the mining com

the Montana Power company to grant
demands of the electricians and the
mining companies aL.O granted the
demands recently made by the newly
formed Metal Mine Workers' union,
the electricians employed by the min

The senate bad only a brief discus

until late tonight. Opposition there
appeared to be waning and leaders
hoped to conclude general debate to
morrow, planning then to consider
amendments and pass the bill by Fri
day or Saturday.
Food conditions which f? the al
lies and this country were explained
by Mr." Hoover. Without government
food control, he said, success in the
war may be imperilled. Such a con
trol in a great degree, he said, was
voluntary and was not enforced a
"mobilization of the spirit of self
denial and self-sacrifice" in preventing
waste of foodstuffs.
Rationing Not Proposed.
That rationing or other enforced
rgulat!on of the 'American dinner
table is proposed was denied by Mr.
Hoover. Also he-said requ'sitioning of
factories or regulation of wages was
not contemplated and that excision of
war profits in distrbutlng of food,
largely by voluntary co-operation of
business interests involved, is the
prime object of thetill.
Four basic measures of food control
planned. Mr. Hoover said, are expert
regulation, control of distribut:on in

'CHICKEN CASEY,' HEW
INCE PICTURE, BILL
AT ORPHEUM TONIGHT
Dorothy Dalton, Thomas H. Ince's
new and magnetic star, is the heroine
of "Chicken Casey,? which will be
seen on the Triangle program at the
Orpheum theatre today and tomorrow.
The play has to do with the adven
tures of an actress who plays a clever
trick on a young author to convince
him tnat she is fitted for a role which
sho desires. It Is necessoryfor the ac
complishment of her purpose that she
disguise herself as a girl of the slums
and undergo a series of startling ad
ventures. She is "game," and the
eventual discomfiture of the author is
complete.
The play is said to be extremely
amusing and offers excellent opportun
ities, not only to Miss Dalton, but also
to Charles Gunn, the new Thomas H.
Ince leading man, who appears as the
author.
"God's Country and the Woman,"
one of the greatest of all northern life
films, will be the feature at the Eaplo
today and tomorrow.
The dogs used in "Cod's Country and
the Woman" are John Johnson's team
of Siberian sledge dogs. Johnson is
a Finlander and collected this team
by selecting one dog at a time here
and there throughout his travels in Si
beria. He brought the dogs from Si
beria to Dawson, Alaska, and they
were entered tor a number of years in
the Alaska Sweepstakes, where they
broke all records and won from all
comers for three consecutive years,
thus earning for themselves the title
of "World's Champion Team." They
hold the record for 410 miles steady
going. In one of the races this dog
team has been known to travel for 48
hours at an average rate of more than
22 miles an'hour. under the direction
jf "The Iron Man pf Dawson," as
Johnson is known. Their presence in
the Vitagraph camp during the lene
December nights lent an atmosphere
that everyone regrets nor navmg reen
able to incorporate into the picture,
for these dogs, like the nightingale,
are wont to make their music at night.
At some time .between midnight and
dawn one of these dogs would start his
wild w'jlf-like howl, would soon be
joined by the other fifteen, and the
team of several timber-wolves that
was housed at some distance, and also
used in the picture, would take up the
chorus. It was, to say the least, uncanny.
Few people realize that over 3T.0.O0O
pounds of various herbs are u-W an
nually in making Lydia E. Pitikham's
Vegetable Compound, and these herbs
all have to be gathered at the season
of the year when their medicinal prop
erties are at their best.
The watchword in preparing these
herbs is cleanliness, the process of
percolation Is perfect. All utensils
and tanks are sterilized and the medi
cine is pasteurized, clarified and fil
tered before it is bottled for the
consumer.
It is this wonderful combination of
herbs, together with the skill and care
used In the preparation, which has
made this famous medicine so success
ful in the treatment of female ills.

Watoga, W. Va Mrs. S. W. Glad well,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, 1 suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had ,
terrible headache, backache,-and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... 1 gained, and was well
and strong, and 1 owe it all to Cardui.
I am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
sthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
ailments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

WALLACE REIO AND

AT CENTRAL TONIGHT
I Wallace Reid as the sole pupil of a

at the Central tonight when these two

some Mr. Reid gets placed in a corner
of the school room with his eyes to the
' wall because he has the temerity to
chalk on the blackboard, "I luv my

THE KAISER AND THE SOCIALISTS.
What, has the Kaiser to do with the Socialists, asks
William English Walling or the Vigilantes. Walling Is
the author of "Socialism As It Is," "Progressism And
After." "Socialists And The War," and other works. To
his own question he answers:
We know, that the support of the Socialists inside of
Germany was regarded as very valuable and that there
was not much difficulty in obtaining this support. But
what has the Kaiser to ask for and what can he hope to
get from the Socialists of other countries? The Kaiser
has just two things to ask of the Socialists of Russia,
America. England, France and Italy:
1. That these Socialists support him in his demand
for peace at such a time as German arms have attained
their maximum possible strength, namely, at that time
which Clausewitz, the greatest of all German military ex
perts, called the "moment of victory."
2. That these non-German Socialists should create the
maximum difficulties for their governments, for example,
by asking for unattainable economic demands, for a de
gree of personal freedom impossible in war time, and
above all by anti-war riots and rebellion against all exist
ing governments (outside of Germany.)
The Kaiser's program for Socialists (outside of Ger
many) is being carried out almost to the letter at least
by a part of the Socialists in all the Entente countries.
It is hardly necessary to refer to Russia, as the condition
in that country can be noted on the first page of tho
newspapers every morning. But we must recall that the
Socialist party of America has taken almost the same
position as the Socialists in control of the Russian Coun
cil of Workmen's and Soldiers' Delegates. This has gone
so far that the self-respecting American Socialists and
genuine internationalists are leaving the party on the
grounds of its support of the Kaiser's program. John
Spargo, one of the five members of the Executive Com
mittee and perhaps the best known Socialist author in
America, has' already left. Allan Benson, the candidate
for the presidency last fall, has announced that he will
leave as soon as the party referendum has definitely en
dorsed the action of the recent party convention in St
Louis which many Socialists have denounced as out
right treason.
In France the party if? divided into two almost equal
halves, one faction acting along the above-mentioned
Russian and "American" lines. The situation in England
is somewhat better as the British Labor Party, an organ
ization recognized as Socialistic by the international So
cialist organization, is pro-ally; but the two smaller
Socialist parties are violently in favor of an immediate
peace on the basis o "no annexation, no indemnities," in
accord with the plans of the German Chancellor and his
entourage.
It ought not to be necessary to explain how the Kaiser
has achieved this result. This is just one more of the
astounding successes of the German propaganda such as
that achieved by BernstorfT in the United States and that
carried on by the German agents in Russia at the same
time in the court' of the Czar and among the anarchists.
The only difference is that a special machinery existed for
the purpose of winning foreign Socialists for the Kaiser's
use. namely, the so-called international Socialist move
ment. Just as the German government exercised a vast
influence over the little neighboring countries of Europe
by military and economic pressure, so the Grman Social
ists have for years dominated nearly all the Socialist
parties of Europe with the exception of those of France
and Belgium. When the present war came on, here was
an ideal machine to be used for the Kaiser's purposes
especially as the German and Russia Jewish Socialists aie
predominating in the United States.
In order to accomplish his double object, however, the
Kaiser needed to make use of two kinds of German So
cialists. From almost the beginning of the war the Ger
man Socialists have preached the peace terms desired by
the Kaiser, namely, "no annexation, no indemnities," a
return to the status quo which existed before Uie war,
allowing the Kaiser to absorb his present military allies
and completely to dominate his beaten and weakened
neighbors, who would have obtained uo compensating ad
vantage out of the war. All factions of the German So
cialists also favor immediate peace "regardless of the
strategic situation" which means a peace resting on Ger
man military advantage, that is a peace on the Kaiser's
terms. But now came a difficulty. It was necessary to
gain a popular support for this program at home and at
the same time to gala popular support for it abroad. This
required a division among the German Socialists. The
pro-Kaiser majority Is used for the purpose of getting
support at home, but for the very reason that it sup
ports the Kaiser it Is useless as a bait to obtain' the
support of foreign Socialists for the Kaiser's program
The so-callad minority, on the other hand, led by the
famous world renowned Socialists, Haase, Kautsky and
Bernstein, opposes the government in domestic affairs
though by entirely legal and therefore absolutely nana
less ad ineffective methods. However, this is sufficient
opposition to satisfy the Germanophile and ultra pacifist
foreign Socialists. These leaders are therefore in a posi
tion to obtain a favorable hearing for the Kaiser's pro
gram abroad. So much for the Kaiser's first object.
popular support of the German peace terms both inside of
Germany and by foreign Socialists.
His second object is to promote revolution abroad with
out promoting a revolution at home. For this purpose the
minority just mentioned is not satisfactory. And at this
point the Kaiser is saved by a third Socialist group,
which he has done nothing to favor, namely, the revolu
tionists of the Llebknecht faction, most of whom are now
in jaiL
The very existence of a group of revolutionists in Ger
many such as that led by Llebknecht, Rosa Luxemburg,
Clara Zetkin and others furnishes sufficient ground for
the revolutionary dogmatists and fanatics of Russia and
other countries to believe, or to claim to believe, that a
revolution is oompletely pending in Germany. While such
an idea, is laughed at by the German government and all
well-informed persons In Germany, the belief that a Ger
man revolution is about to take place has been encouraged
and carfully worked up in all other countries where this
particular species of Socialism is strong for example.
in France, Russia and the United States. In England,
on the other hand, where revolutionary Socialism is very
weak and pacifism is strong, the Germanophiles have
laid stress upon the idea that there is a strong peace
party in Germany. The one statement is as untrue as the
other. Although it is possible that a protracted series of
severe defeats would ultimately bring Germany to a re
volution, the situation at the present moment is sufficient
ly indicated by the fact that practically all the best
known revolutionary leaders are either in jail or under
charges of high treason which may put them in jail at
any moment The Socialist majority faction is anti-revolutionary,
the minority advocates purely legal means in
its opposition to the government, and the revolutionary
group is represented only by two or three or at the most
half a dozen of the 110 Socialist members of the Reich
stag. Pacifism is equally weak among the German So
cialists. All three of the factions just mentioned are in
favor of a German peace as already stated. With the
possible exception of the small revolutionary group, all
would be glad to have the war end at a time when they
are fully aware that the Kaiser has every advantage in
the dictation of the terms of peace.
SUMMARY
RECLAIMING THE REJECTED.
i
Of the American citizens registered for selective ser
vice, about two-thirds appear to come under the classi
fication of 'indicatd exemptions." That is, pending per
sonal investigation of each case, they are regarded as
probably exempt under the army rules. Most of them
are disqualified for physical reasons.
The government has wisely decided not to let these
millions of physical defect exemption cases go by default.
It has been pointed out by medical experts that hundreds
of thousands of men now unfit to enter the army could
be rendered fit by medical or surgical treatment. The
war department is therefore planning a comprehensive
campaign of physical reclamation.
Men who would ordinarily be rejected because of , bad
teeth are to have their teeth repaired so as to pass the
tests whenever it is possible and it is said to be possible
in most cases. Men a few pounds underweight are to be
fattened up by a course of wholesome diet and exercise.
Men a few pounds overweight are to be reduced by the
same rational process. Men with flat feet are to have
their feet treated. Trivial eye defects are to be cured.
Mild cases of tuberculosis are to be taken in hand. There
will be a general overhauling and repairing of the reject
ed without cost to them, at the hands of government
specialists.
This physical rehabilitation work will proceed with
the rejected men while the men selected as fit are un
dergoing military training. Then when the second army
is selected, those who have been reclaimed will be re
garded as fully eligible and utilized as they are needed.
This is an admirable undertaking, which should, and
doubtless will, have the enthusiastic co-operation of the
men concerned. Every citizen suffering from a disquali
fying physical imperfection should rejoice in the prospect
of being restored to full health and strength and fitted to
serve his country in any field to which he may be called.
Short skirts are now justified on the score of war
economy. But why should women do all the sartorial
economizing? It is proposed that men follow the same
policy by adopting kilts. It would save woolen cloth.
And the men would be a lot more comfortable during
the summer in mosquitoless communities.
There's many a man past 30 who is sneering at the
cowardly evasion of the fellows who didn't register,
when he himself has shirked the purchase of a war bond.
Between the two classes there isn't much to choose.
One seldom buffers a lack of appetite when food is
scarce.
Indications point to an early re
sumption of operations on a grand
scale in Belgium and France if, indeed
they have not already begun in Flan
ders and Champagne. A significant
statement in the latest Berlin official
communication says that in Flanders
and Champagne "the fighting activity
has been revived at several points,
Aside from this there is no informa
tion as to the exact state of affairs. In
Champagne the Germans have made
an attempt to recapture positions be
tween Mont Blond add Mont Carnillet
taken by the French, Monday, but
met with repulse, suffering heavy cas
ualties- To the northwest, around
Craonne, heavy artillery duels are be
ing fought.
The situation in Flanders Is even
more obscure, as neither the British
nor French statements tend to clarify
the German report of the recommence
ment of hostilities. Artillery duels of
great Intensity are known to have
been in progress between Boesingbe
and Frelinghisen and in the regions of
Streenstraete and Hetsas.
Troops Pouring In.
The Macedonian theatre also prom
lses early developments on a large
scale. While along the line where Gen
eral Sarrail's forces are fighting the
Teutonic allies near the Greece-Serbian
border the reports show only ar
tillery duels to be in progress, the en
tente commander still is pouring men
into Thessaly and occupying, import
ant localities. Another indication that
the Greeks are turning toward; the en
tente cause is shown by the fact that
considerable quantities of arms and
ammunitions have been surrendered
by the populations of invested towns
and villages.
Again the Austrians have endeavor
ed to dislodge the Italians from posi
tions northeast of Jamiano in the Car-
so sector of the Austro-Italian theatre.
A surprise attack has been repulsed
with severe losses in men killed and
made prisoner. On Monte Rombon,
however, the Austrians were more suc
cessful in n' attack, capturing advane
ed positions of the Italians on the
southeastern slopes of the mountain.
Crisis In Austria.
A high honor has been conferred
on Vice Admiral Sims of the United
States navy, commander-in-chief of
the American naval forces in the war
zone. The British admiralty announc
es that during the absence of the Bru
sh commander-in-chief on the coast
of Ireland, Vice Admiral Sims has
hoisted his flag as the allied senior of
ficer in charge of operations in Irish
waters.
Advices from Denmark, Switzerland
and Holland indicated a cabinet crisis
in Austria by reason of the fact that
the Poles in the Reichsrat, seeking the
downfall of Premier Clam-Martinic,
and also the foreign minister. Count
Czernin, have refused to vote the Aus
trian budget.. ,
Another steamer, the Standard Oil
tanker John D. Archboid, has been
sunk by an enemy submarine. It is
believed that three members of the
crew were lost in the disaster which
occurred when the vessel was two
days out from France bound for Boston.

Monday Night, Admits Part
In Many Robberies.
Francisco Medina, arrested In this
city Monday nihi by Bisbee and Lo
well officers, yesterday pleaded guilty
before Judge M. C. Hign to a cnarge
of burglary and bound over to await
the action of the superior court. Me
dina confessed, after his arrest, that
he and a Mexican man and woman ar
rested two weeks ago, were responsible
for many burglaries in the Warren
District during the last month. Most
of the loot was recovered, but Medina
said that a quantity of it had been
sold in Cananea.
When Medina was arraigned yester
day he pleaded guilty to the charge
of robbing the home of Tony Kline,
the specific charge on which he was
held. He did not even wait to hear
the complaint read, interrupting the
reading of it to admit the truth of the
charge. The police and county of
ficers, who worked diligently on the
case for weeks, are confident that
they now have the ringleaders of the
gang of burglars in custody. Since the
arrest of the Mexicans the robberies,
which were becoming frequent, have
stopped. If necessary a dozen local
residents will go to Tombstone to ap
pear against the Mexicans and testify
to having identified various articles of
clothing and jewelry found in the
Mexican's possession as having been
stolen from them.

tain advantages which would prove
fruitless if she espouses the cause
of the other side."
Carlos Gonzelas Penas, novelist,
said:
"The war not only effects the na
tions engaged but is a battle of nation
alism against absorbing brutal militar
ism." Arturo Cisperos, journalist, wrote as
follows:
"We cannot longer permit within
Mexico the carrying on of German es
pionage. The odious campaign of that
part of the Mexican press .which is
subsidized by Germany and which
sends out news prepared in Berlin is
calculated to divide public opinion as
ia Spain. Perfidious Germany has
sought at all costs to embroil us with
the United States. This Is proved by
the publication in the pro-German pa
pers of the United States of stories of
wireless dispatches between Mexico
and Berlin of an alliance against the
United States between Mexico and
Salvador and by declarations that high
Mexican officials have been paid mil
lions of dollars to secure support for
Germany. To these intrigues we
should respond by a declaration of
war."
Luis Ledon said an alliance with
Germany would be highly disastrous
for Mexico, for assuming that the Ger
mans should repulse the attacks of j
the Americans in Europe they would
come to Mexico and conquer it as a
tasce of operations against the United
States as they crushed Belgium.
"We should ally ourselves frankly
with the United States," said Senor j
Ledon. "on moral as well as economic ;
grounds for they have all the money j
we require for the rebabilation of our j
country." I

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, June 19. The stock
market settled down to routine con
ditions today after an early setback
which fcore the familiar marks of bear
pressure. Initial, losses of 1 to 2
points in the several speculative
groups were speedily retrieved on
short covering. Trading became apa -
thetic until the final hour when sell
lng was renewed. The net result, ex-
cept in isolated instance, was insig
nificant. -Special
stocks furnished much of
the day's motive power under the ae
tive guidance of pools and other pro-.
fessional interests.. The. inquiry for '
motor issues at gross advances of 2
to 6 points was predicted on the re- j
ported purchase by the government of :
large amounts of cars and trucks toj
augment the proposed air fleet
Money rates relaxed materially, al-
though much of the day's require-
ments were again met at the six per j
cent rate.
United States Steel moved within a
narrow radius and closed at 127; a
net loss of points. Other shares of
the class moved withi similar limits,
the only noteworthy exceptions being
Bethlehem steel old stock, which lost
6 on a single sale. Total sales ag-1
greeated 860.000 shares.

.CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. June 19. Increased of-
ferines of the 1917 crop had a bearisH,
effect on wheat today. Largely in con-
sequence the finish, although steady,
was four to 6 down with July at 205
and September at 181. Corn closed
off to 1 up, and oats unchanged to
lower. Provisions gained 5 to 12
cents net.
Much of the selling of wheat was
credited to the southwest and was gen
erally resarded as hedging to facili
tate the marketing of the new crop.
Weakness developed especially In the
July option, but wheat for immediate
delivery was even heavier.

litwl AAra fwim a eothntV wiSh Tiad T0-

Oats traders took fbeir cue to a
considerable degree from the action
of corn. Improved cash demand for
meats finally gave strength to provi
sions after a period of depression due
to realizing sales on the part of-holders

San Francisco Stevedore De

Case Secured 1 1 Pounds of
Nitre For Experiments.
(By Review Leased Wire
SAN FRANCISCO, June 19. Mrs.
Rena Mooney, on trial for murder in
connection with a bomb explosion,
July 22, which killed ten persons, was
identified today by Samuel Samuels, aj
stevedore, as the woman to whom he
gave eleven pounds of nitre eleven
days prior to the explosion.
In his opening statement to the jury.
Assistant District Attorney Louis Fer
rari asserted that the state would
offer evidence intended to show direct
connection between the nitre which he
said was one of the bases of dyna

to have been found in Mrs. Mooney's
apartment, and the explosion.

she wanted it to experiment with. I
said I had no sack and she opened her
hand bag and took out a small sack. I
hurried back to the vessel and got her
about eleven pounds. She handed me
twenty cents and said 'go and get a
drink,' jumped into the machine and
drove off."
On cross examination by Edwin Mc

Samuels admitted that "three or four

him for nitre. He- could not remem

FINED.
Ed O'Brien was given a suspended
sentence of 25 days in jail on being
convicted in Judw Frank TlAmas'
court yesterday on a charge of fight
ing. O'Brien and Emil Maniaus were
arrested by Officer Walter Sheppard
and both entered pleas of not guilty
when arraigned Monday afternoon. At
their trial yesterday .it was testified
that the men had met on the street
and started quarreling over a lunch
bucket The preponderance of testi
mony was to the effect that O'Brien
had struck the first blow. Mamaus
testified that O'Brien had stopped him
and told him that he was willing to
take an automobile, drive outside the
city limits, and fight the matter out
Then, said Mamaus, O'Brien struck
him. The charge against Mamaus was
dismissed and O'Brien was warned
that if he reneTed the trouble with
Mamaus again be would be forced to
serve out his sentence.
