PETROGRAD. Feb. 22. The Ger

inevitable says Ensign Krylenko.
commander in chief of the Russian ar
mies, in an official statement issued
today. "The people's heroism must be
opposed to the advancing enemy," it
Is declared.
The statement says that detach
ments 1.000 to 1.500 strong, lightly
armed and able to entrench quickly
and attack determinedly, will be able
to stop the German advance. This is
characterized as "real revolutionary
mobilization," and this has been or
dered. Ensign Krylenko. the Bolsbevikl
commander in chief, who issued the
statement says ihat if the people suc
ceed in throwing against thfe enemy
concentrated masses of revolutionary
citizens, who not only in accordance
with military strategy but also secret
ly from every corner, everywhere, in
small detachments and large battal
ions, will struggle for every town, vil
lage, street and bouse, then there are
no forces which tbe Germans can suc
cessfully oppose against them.
The statement says that all able
bodied men must be ordered to work
on fortifications and in the construc
tion of obstacles along all the routes
of the German advance. Any bocr-soeise-who
resist must be tried and
forcibly compelled to work. ' Regis tra
tioa facihties for the revolutionary ar
my have been opened at all local coun
cils and with the staffs of the red ar
my.
It is added that arms will be deliv-!
ered by localities.
Revolutionary discipline must be i
brought to the highest degree of effi
ciency by the handing over to the rev
olutionary tribunals all who do not
obey the order.
"All to arms- All to the defense of

Facing absolute subjection bt tbtt

Russian premier and commander in
Chief have taken what steps they could '
to initiate at least a nominal defense!
against the invaders of their country
Orders directing that guixilla warfare
be carried on and piecing Petrograd
in a slate of siege have been issued by
Lenme and Ko 'enki and it is xpect-
that the Germans will meet with
,'some resistance before long.

(German commander who is operating
in tbe northernmost Baltic province.
The Russian navy, too, is completely
disorganized and. while it is desired
to withdraw the warships from Reval
and Helsingfors to Kronstadt. it is be
lieved that this operation is impossi
ble, in view of the' disuse into which
the Baltic fleet has falien. Only the
submarine boats are In a seaworthy
condition, it is reported.
There is as yet no definite advices
as to the rumored" fall of the Lenin e
Trotzky government. The proclama
tion directing that resistance be offer-
d to the German advance however,

did not bear the name of Taotzky. who
hitherto has been a virtual dictator,
which may be significant.
The Germans have pushed' still far
ther eastward in tha last4wenty-four
hours. In the far ibrth, theVilliige of
HapsaL on the south coast of the Gulf
of Finland, has been captured. Far
ther south the city of Rieshitsa. about
100 miles east of Riga, has been enter

they were welcomed by the people.

which stamped out slavery in the Civil
War are again at stake, not omy m
this country, but throughout the world,
was the principal theme of an address
by Charies S. Whitman, governor of
New Yor. at tha Washington birthday
banquet of the Creve Coeur club here
umight. He said in part:
wa the orecurscr of the emancipation 1
nrn.-iamatif.ti It was onlv a matter of !
a people with the ideals obtaining 1.368 cars were sent to
oar foreia-.hers would banish slavery ! boaru from Chicago and East St. Louis j
from itis land. Ei:her the docu-ine of
tie fathers was true, or it was false,
an i the great man whom Illinois gave
to the union spoke truly when he ealti:
Th country will be all tlave or all
free.'
"The ouicome of the revolutionary
war was certain ironi the beginning.
Tee irmi-is of the king v;ere fighting
against an ideal. Seven years or sev
enty years would have made no differ
ence in the final outcome. The men
who wore the biae were fighting for
an ideal. The men who wore the gTay
slacere and honest as raajy of thein
were, were standing in the way of the
onward sweep cf humanity.
"It is vain to discuss in detail the
evenls immediacy preceding the out
1'reak of the war in Europe. Ia the
last analysis there is just one reason
which made this war injvitaUe. Hor
rible as has. been the awfj slaughter,
the war had to coaie; there is not
room enough in the world for the two
i.ieas of government. Once and for
ever. God grant, the issue is going to
be fought to the finish.
"This is aot a war on the Gerrnrn
people, nor is Geruacy merely making
war on the peopie of other iands. This
is a combat between ideals of govern
ment. Uelsiam. broken but nncon
quereJ; Eagland, struggling as she
has never struggled before; the sons
o Fran.-e. fingiag as thty bleed and
sxnilir.g as tiey cie. are just as truly
'fighting for an kieid as were the rag
ged continentals at Saratoga or at
orktown. or the men whose bloody
feet lefi their impress in the snow at
alley Forge.
"I know that there was a Germany
in the past that her sons and daugh
ters have had every reason to love a.
Germany of poetry and sang, literature
art, science and cf education, but that
Germany id no more. It has given
place to a Germany of the iron heel
tad the clanking sabre to a misrhty
ntion dedicated to the proposition,
that 'mislit makes right' tbst there is
no such thing a freedom of thought,
freedom of heart, or freedom of life;
thai slavery is the natural and proper
condition of the human race."
Governor V.'hiunan then reviewed
the conditions under which the na
tional army wes raised and expressed
deeo confidence in the troops.
"They are all righL," ae exclaimed,
and continued:
- "Somewhere in France and by and
jut as truly a mere is a ooa in
Heaven, somewhere in Germany they
will demonstrate their devotion to the
ideals which they have learned in Am
erican homes. It is for us to see to it
that we. the men and women behind t
the men behind the guns, act well our
part; that nothing be done and that
nothing be said to bring aid an$ com

up into a wrinkly knot while you gouge

"Geis-lt" is the modern, painless, sim

of "Gets-It" on the corn, put your

forget the corn. Pain is eased.
"Gets-lt" has revolutionized th

FOR A FEW DAYS ONLY
The reat progress that has been madj ly this Company, and the obvious fact
the Chino Valley Oil Dcom is fast developing inio a strong reality, makes the
treasury shares of the United Chino, at present price, a speculative investment
that is seldom equaled and never excelled. Th's prite will again be raised within
a few days.
What Has Been Accomplished in Two Short Months
Just a little more than tv.-o months agowa offered you treasury shares of
this company at the exceedingly small figure of 2'2 cents per share, cash, an addi
tional 2 cents per share to be paid when v. e were producing oil in commercial
quantities.
In this short. time, by using our stockholders money in furthering their in
terests, ard by efficient business methods which are necessary for the success of
AXY business enterprise, we have, bought complete drilling equipment as fine as it
s nossiVle to buy ar.ywhere ir the ccun-ry, and we have this equipment in the
field, where a strained :ffcrt is being rmie by a large force of men. under cop
mend of one of the most aggressive engineers in the west, to get the machinery
set up, the rig built and the beam bobbing.
At the present time, these men are driving away, with the assistance of expert
men from the producing fields of Souths ti Califomis the rig is being construct
ed, 1 8 men are actively employed by the company, and several big six-horse teams
are hauling the heavy machinery to the spit where cur No. 1 well will be put down.
Net a penny is being wasted, but the enti'-e financial energy of our treasury and the
phvsical and mental energy of the men behind this company, are concentrated on
making our enterprise a
. A Talk With an Oil Expert
Last week, the writer spent two day in the fieH, in the company of oil ex
port? from CaVfornia and others, amon tV-ern Driller DeWitt, a man who was for
many years with the Standard Oil people a practical oil man who has spent his
life, since he was 8 years old (and he is now 53) in the various oil fields of the
world. Mr DeWitt will be associated with this company in putting down our first
W3ll.
We took him to the ground where our weil had been spotted by experts and
as!:ed him what he thought of the'eountry. We told him frankly that expense was
no object that we had moved the location of our well from near the railroad to
its present location on the Ritter anti-clire in the Black Forest, four miles away,
because that spot hed been chosen by experts as the most LOGICAL place to
drill for oil. Mr. DeWitt, after a careful study of the surrounding country, stated
most err.phaticalV th?t he believed we had the choicest piece of ground in the dis
trict, and that if we did not bring in a flowing well, his forty years in the game had
taught him nothing. He explained his position in the matter, by calling attention
to surface indications which "he said could be caused ONLY BY GAS FROM BE
LOW which means OIL. Mr. DeWitt predicts a FLOWING WELL and so
thoroughly enthusiastic is he about the prospects in the CHINO VALLEY, that he is
going to REMAIN THERE, although he car-.e from California to do temporary
work in bui'ding our ris and setting up th drilling rig.
We Have Kept the Faith and We Believe We'll Get the Oil
Do you know why UNlTED CHINO OIL is the most popular and mosi talked
of issue fn the state of Arizona tbday?
Do you why we have hundreds of friends throughout the state, who are con
stantly expressing their confidence in this company, and backing up that confi
dence with their financial support?
Do you know why the recognized brokerage houses of this state, men with big
followines who handly only clean-cut issues of responsible companies, are handl
ing UNITED CHINO?
The Answer Is Simply Because We Have Kept the Faith
We have used the money received from the sale of our treasury stock in a
legitimate manner. We have spent thousands of dollars in buying equipment and
supplies, and we've spent NOTHING unless we believed absolutely it was for the
benefit of the company. We have created an ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT FUND
which quickly assumed substantial proportions, and we are bending every possible
effort toward MAKING BIG MONEY for those who have had confidence enough
in us to give us their financial support.
We Are Willing to Stand on What We Have Accomplished
Today, the future of the UNITED CHINO seems absolutely assured. We have
stock subscriptions already which insure ample funds to continue our aggressive
operations, arid the value of -this stock is increasing every day. It will be impossi
ble, after a few days from now, for anyone to buy UNITED CHINO at the present
price, because that price will positively hz raised, and probably doubled, within a
very short time.
The Day We Spud In
UNITED CHINO oil stock will have a value of at least twice the present price.
As the drill goes down, that value will increase, and when the oil is struck and
we have reached the point where we believe most positively that it WILL BE
UNITED CHINO stock should easily be worth a hundred times its present price.
IN NINETY DAYS TIME, we have every reason to believe that UNITED CHINO
will be selling for around 50 cents per share.

A Man in a Million
Up in Kansas they are running
Henry Allen, the Wichita editor and
famous orator, for governor, and yet
Allen is in France engaged in Red
Cross work for the government. He
has two or three opponents, but if this
writer knows Kansas, and he thinks
he does, more than passing well, thfy
will never get to first base in this
race with Henry Allen. If there was
ever a man peculiarly fitted by the
rare talents of his mind and the great
ness and resolute courage of his heart
to be a war governor, that man is
Henry Allen. Eloquent as any spell
binder of the old Greeks, forceful,
practical and keen, he is also as sim
ple as an old shoe. He sang the swan
song of the Progressives at the Chi
cago convention something over five
years ago.' He is the greatest aftir
dinner speaker in the west, or the
east either, for that matteV. !n de
mand the country ovr as a lecturer'
at his own price. He has a tongue J
of flame and a heart of gold, thisj
Henry Allen. His record, his ability
and bis popularity all pointed to him
as the logical candidate and easy
winnar of the Kansas governorship.
He decided to make the race. But
when the call came for him to go to
France to help from the stores of his
great heart and mind and loving per
sonality, the boys over there, he
waved his hand at the fascinating
figure of fjrme that stood in the easy
path, left his family", business, ease
and friends and, with a brave smile,
took the hard path of duty as hi
eagle eye and flaming soul saw that
path. Sure Henry Allen will win the
Kansas governorship; win it because
Kansas is Kansas, and because Alter
is Allen, and because love of country
and admiration for unselfish loyalty
dominates all politics, parties and
principles at this time: Listen to
William Allen White, the famous Kan
sas writer and publicist, upon the
Kansas governorship. Arizona might
well adopt this political text. She.
too. has a man of Allen's stamp in
Red Cross work in France. White
96 ys:
"A governor as a leader in war
time speaks for a state as well as pre
sides over its executive department
Henry Allen is known all over Amer
ica. Kis voice will reach far. As
governor he will have much national
influence. Ke never will lower the
flag. And the only way a Republican
in this campaign can let the world
know how Kansas stands is to nomi
nate and elect Henry Allen.
"The other candidates may be
equally patriotic tut their victory
will mean little inside of Kansas and
nothing outside of Kansas. Allen's
victory will put Kansas on the map.
And put it on the map right side up.
That is why factional differences axe f
being forgotten in the Allen canli
dary. Wiat are factions, what evta
are parties, besides the great clash of
ideas that involve in this war!"

THE GERMAN WEAKNESS.
It remains for a Japanese states
man, lyenaga, to point out in the
plainest, strongest, greatest words the
fundamental reasons for Germany's
plight today, with the world against
her. She sought, confidently, to dfr
tach Japan from the allied cause, and
offered American possessions, not her
i own. as the bait. Her worst nere
raw and coarse and even blatant
Yet it was serious. We cannot con
ceive how a great and efficient nation
should commit surh a. gross diplo
matic folly. But Japan understands.
Listen to lyenaga:
"The German edifice is reared on
the theory that man has only appe
tite. There Is no denying that this
theory, vigorously applied, will take
its upholder a lrng way. Man IS
governed by his appetite, but not
wholly. HE HAS. Germany to the con
trary. A SOUL!"
This Jap, coming out of the mysteri
ous east, where knowledge and phil
osophy and psychology were old and
hoary before there was a Europe in
habited by man, knows so well how to
interpret the Prussian eco. Direct
from the caveman it came, and his
nation and found the caveman's club
when it dug the foundations for Its
temples. Germany is a materialist
She welded her empire from German
free states by winning victories in
war and offering spoils. Her snc-j
cesses and greatness are founded
upon brute strength, trained and ap-j
plied bv a keen brain. Her dealings!
w$i ether l.e-icns Kot tViy 7r
have been based solely upon might
Thus Rome conquered the world
Thus would Germany. A .sop here
and a blow there. A lie to one nation
and a oromise to another. Broken
faith is alright if backed by the bay
onet Nothing aucceeds like success
The materialist, and he alone shall
rule. The dreamer and sentimental
ist and humanitarian, these are only
to be sneered at and duped or driven
before the gale cf materialism. But.
as this wise and deep and thoughtful
Jap has said:
"Man has a sojL"
This soul revolts at materialism
carried past a certain point Hence
the Godiy things hidden deep In man
have arrayed the world against Ger
many and her docsn. is written.
PEACE.
One peace that will not help Ger
many the peace recently declared be
tween President Wilson and Congress.
The row was sttrted, as most rows
are, by radicals and politicians for
their own selfish aims and to pro
mote their own interests. Gumshoe
Bill Stone was the first to inject bit
ter partisanship into congressional
consideration of the war. This was
natural, for Stone was in a bad posi
tion at home because of his pro-German
stand at the beginning of the war.
Of course h goes to the other ex
treme to square himself. But good
sense and American patriotism ave
prevailed over the machinations of
the cheap shouters and the legislative
and the executive departments of the
nations are in accord and working to
gether again. This means victory. B
all means, let us talk and keep peace
! among ourselves and with our allies.
But let us neither think, talk nor con
sider peace with Germany until we
have cracked the spiked helmet and
baUere(j the ego out of the head be

CONFUSED.

RESOLUTE!
"While discussion of pea:e t? more
active than at any time since the
war began, the determination to push
the struggle to the end was never
more resolute than now. says Henry
Clews, banker and publisher. "The
greatest obstacle to peace is probably i
the attitude of milkary . Germany.
This is something to which civiliza
tion cannot and will not consent; so
the
war-weary Titans 'must continue
their wretched struggle until victcrj
definitely decides which side is the
strongest Happily endurance, as wel;
as reason, justice and liberty are on
the side of the Allies, whose unlim
Ited resources and stoutheartedness
will eventually bring the war to cj
successful conclusion. As for peace
proposals, it is plain -that at the mo-L",
ment both sides are as yet too wide
apart in their views to admit of a set-j
tlement The desire for peace is
questionably still running strong

Possibly later events may give oppor

Pecos Valley Oil
This, field in which oil has been known to exist for
many years is now being rapidly developed. A num
ber of the big companies being in the field. Among
them being the Great Western Oil and Refining Co.
The Standard Oil Company, The Home Investment
Company of Oklahoma. All of these companies have
already brought in one or more producing wells ar.J
are sinking other wells rapidly. Land in what is known
to be proven oil land extending from 40 to 50 miles in
length on either side of the Pecos river and from 1 2 to
1 5 miles in width, this land, much of which was of very
little value for any other purpose, is now eagerly sought
after and high prices paid for oil leases. Among the
most active companies in the field is the Lake Arthur
Oil Company, with 18,000 (acres in the heart of the
proven field. This is the pioneer company and the land
was carefully selected by Prof. Milton McWhorter, when
the choice of the entire field was to be had. Prof. Mc
Whorter is an authority on oil lands and has visited
personally practically all the oil fields of any conse
quence in this country and Europe. He is now devoting
his entire time in this field and states that this will be
the largest oil field in the United States and that the oil
is a paraffin base and runs very high in gasoline.
The Lake Arthur company has three fully equipped
oil rigs working. One well already producing oil and
two ether wells nearing the oil depth which should be
brought in within the next 60 days. These wells be
ing sunk are artesian wells, which have always produced
some oil, but are now being deepened down to the main
oil bearing sands. The artesian water has been cased
out by forcing cement down through small pipes by
which the artesian water is entirely eliminated. Bisbee
people have now perhaps the only opportunity they will
have to get some of this stock at one dollar per share, as
when sufficient funds are raised to. pay for casing the
two new wells being sunk, there will most likely he no
necessity for more stock to be sold, as the oil produced
is now bringing $3.00 per barrel at the refinery at Lake
Arthur. This will not only pay for further development
but will soon be paying dividends to its stockholders.
The directors, at a meeting on January 3Jst, passed
a resolution that after April 1st, 1918, no more stock
would be sold for less than $2.00 and if the new wells
now being drilled are heavy producers, such as the first
one, the price will be far above $2.00 '.
DR. M. W. LANG
of the Lake Arthur Oil Company, is now at the Antlers
Hotel while here. Samples of oil and gasoline are in
display in Sasse's window on Main Street.
