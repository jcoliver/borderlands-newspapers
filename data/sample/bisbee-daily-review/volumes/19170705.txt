Federal Attorney Declares Ar
rest of "Wobbly" Organizer
Proves Connection With
German Government
' (By Review Leased Wire.)
SCRANTON, Pa., July 4.
Following the arrest today
of Joseph Graber, an or
ganizer of the Industrial Work
ers of the World, charged with
being a spy in the employ of
the German government, fed
eral authorities declared their
i investigation had satisfied
them that recent strikes of the
Industrial Workers of the
World in coal districts had
been stirred up by Germans in
the hope of lessening the
power of the United States in
the war by decreasing coal pro
duction. Graber, who was
taken into custody by United
Spates Marshal lames S.
McGee, was held without bail
under the alien enemy act.
'"Information in our hands, V
said John M. McCort, assistant
United States district attorney,
who has charge of the investi
gation, "proves the connection
between oreanizers and leaders
of the I. W. W. and the Ger
man government."
"Graber is an organizer I. W. W. and
. is a German agent. Our information
proves, too. that German money has.
been poured into the district in an
effort to cause strikes and thus lessen
coal production."
Beginning last summer numerous
strikes occurred at the various mines
in Luzerne and Lackawanna counties.
Industrial Workers of the World par
ades and demonstrations became com
mon. In the late summer Sheriff
Phillips raided an I. W. W. meeting
at Old Forge, near here, arresting 300
men. Recently twelve strikes have
been In progress in this vicinity.

WASHINGTON, July 4. Hig prices

WASHINGTON, July 4. Ap
pointment of J. S. Myers and John
McBride as federal conciliators to
confer with operators and workers
in the copper mine strikes in Ari

ment of labor today. Although no
reports have teen received from
either of the agents, cepartnient of

The department denied that for

tnat such appointment appeared un

ST. LOUIS, July 4. Thousands of
negroes driven out of East St. Louis.
Ills., by the race riots are quartered
on this side of the river.
Scores of them, with all of their
earthly possessions tied up in sheets

ever, are being taken care of in the
homes of St. Louis negroes.
Leading and carrying small children
the refugees continued to arrive to

not had a square meal since early

Where these refugees will go ulti

Independence Dag Is Celebrated
By Staunch Patriots of Bishee
JULY 4. 1917, is a date of the pustj
this morning, but it will long be re
membered In the history of the
Warren District as the most pat-;
riotic anniversary of the declaration
of American independence ever cel-J-(
brated in this part of the state. It was
a strange hut impressive Fourth of
July and the celebration througout the
day was one that confronted in every
detail with President Wilson's request
that the people of the nation refrain
from expensive celebrations and niRke
the day a solemn and sincere demon
stration of the nation's respect for
Old Glory for all that it ha3 stood
for in the past and for what it will
strive for in the future. .
The city was not elaborately de
corated, but there were enough flaes
and bunting displayed to keep the
thousands of citizens who filled the
streets keyed up to a high pitch of
patriotic enthusiasm. There were no
fire-crackers to speak of, but thcr.
were human voices that were lifted
loud in cheers giant throats that
emitted more wholesome noise than
giant-crackers.
Parade Inspiring. J
The bUcest and most impressive
feature of the day was the parade in
the morning. Doubts that may have
existed in the minds of some that the
parade would not be a success pre
dicted were dissipated early yester
day morning, when hundreds of miners,
muckers, bankers, businessmen, pri
vate citizens and school children; in
fact, men, women and children from
every rank of life, walked slowly up
Tombstone Canyon and began to sil
ently form the various divisions which
had been arranged .
Nearly two thousand people were In
line when the parade, headed by the
Legion of Honor, started marching
down the winding road toward the
busienss district. At every turn in
the picturesque canyon the line of
marchers was increased in numbers.
There was only one b:ind, but it did(

dressed them and after promising to
have the citizens' guards d'sperse,
persuaded the strikers to go about
their business and not attempt to
blockade traffic.
The excitement began early this
morning, when an, automobile truck,
leaded with fourteen armed guards
' passed through the picket line which

WOBBLY
BROKER JAW .
When the Fourth of July parade
started yesterday on its inarch
down the canyon, one Vf the loyal
miners in the ranks saw a "wobbly"
standing on the walk. "Here," he
called, "come and take this flag
and march with us. Let's all be
good Americans together.
"Not on your life." snarled the
man. "I don't associate with such
trash."
HiB treasonable words incensed
the marchers in this part of the
ranks to a point past all telling.
When the parade reached the post
jfficc this "wobbly" was still
abreast the marcher who had of
fered him, the flag up the canyon.
The band struck up the Star Span
gled Banner. Hals went off every
where and the patriots began to
cheer. The "wobbly'a" head re
mained covered.
"Take off your bat when the band
plays that tune," called the
marcher.
"Not me," replied the "wobbly,"
defiantly.
Bing! The marcher struck hard
and right on the point of the jaw.
The "wobbly" reeled back into the
post'offtce door. Other marchers
rushed him and only the interfer
ence of Sheriff Wheeler and dep
uties saved the man from violence.
The incident is to be regretted,
the only unpleasant one of the day.
But it is not to be expected that
red-blooded Americans will march
in a parade and submit to Insult
to their flag and their national
hymn.

EAST ST. LOUIS. 111.. July 4.
A federal investigation of
Monday's race riots here, "in
which 33 negroes and four
whites were killed and approxi
mately 310 nesro homes were
burned, was begun today by CoL
George Hunter, chief quartermas
ter Of the central division of the
United States army. Colonel
Hunter is under instructions to
make a full report of the trouble
to Major General Thomas H. Barry
at Chicago, commandant of the
central department.
For the first time since the riot
ing began Sunday midnight the
city was absolutely quiet today.
No trouble 'of any description was
discovered, and the fire depart
ment, which has been busy con
stantly Monday night and all yes
terday fighting fires in the negro
district, did not receive an alarm.
Residents of the city spent a
dreary Fourth of July, for the most
part remaining in their homes.
More than 2.000 Illinois national
guards patrolled the streets. The
city's Fourth f July celebartion,
which was to have been held in
City Hall park, was called off and
all saloons and theatres remained
closed. Guardsmen prevented citi
zens from congregating in any sec

Campbell seated beside him. Follow
ing this truck was another upon which
was seated Major Charles M. Bundel.
This truck did not get across the line.
The miners surrounded it and when
cots and bedding were discovered they
pushed it back to the street a block
down and ordered the driver to return
to the city.
Truck Breaks Down.
After a half hour's conference with
mine officials. Governor Campbell suc
ceeded in getting permission to bring
the armed guards from the mine back
to the city. They were loaded on the
provision truck which was driven
through the pickets. The men, who
had been cautioned against violence
by Secretary Smith and other leaders,
cheered Governor Campbell.
When a short distance from the
picket line the truckj broke down and
the guards were forced to walk the
rest of their way. They were surround
ed by a crowd of jeering miners who
had broken away from their leaders
temporarily. The men continued to
hurl jeers and names at the guards as
they walked.
As the mob passed the corner of
Broad and Mesquite streets the armed
citizens marched out in a body behind
ao American flag and started clearing
the streets.
Clash Is Avoided.
For a time it appeared s if there
might be serious trouble but the inter
vention of several leaders and a plea
by Governor Campbell to the men,
after he had persuaded the guards to
disperse, quieted the situation.
An order of the superior court was
required to obtain bayonets for the
guns which the Home Guards, as
members of rifle clubs, carried. The
bayonets were onhand here for gov
ernment service and were taken by
the court because of the emergency.
Major Bundel was sent here as the

of a call by Governor Campbell for
federal aid. He came here from Doug
las and is making a military survey of
the situation.

The First Two Days Far Exceeded Our Expectations in
This HALF-Price Sale of
Women's Dresses and Coats
THE FIRST TWO days of the sale of Women's
Suits and Dresses, at HALF regular prices, far exceeded
our most sanguine expectations. THERE WAS NOT a
disappointed person Not even the most skeptical shopper
could question such values. We heard so many exclama
tions of surprise and pleasure, that made it a very gratify
ing sale aside from the fact that a new sales record was
established.
BUT THERE Is more to a sale of this kind than mere figures show.
This sale tells us that we arc serving the public in a way that will gain
more and more friends for an already popular store. AND THAT'S
GRATIFYING. TOO.

FIRST ATTEMPT TO
SETTLE STRIKE AT
GLOBE IS FAILURE
I. W. W. Declare Companies
Must Grant Every Demand ;
"Wobblies" Still Refuse To
Recognize Union.
(By Review Leased Wire).
GLOBE. July 4. he Metal Mine
Workers' branch of the Industrial
Workers of the World delivered their
ultimatum to Governor Thomas E.
Campbell at 5 o'clock this afternoon
at a conference when they informed
Arizona's chief executive that they
would not return to work until every
one of their demands were granted by
the big copper companies in the Globe
Miami district. -
They informed bini that while they
were picketing in conjunction with the
International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smelter Workers, they were not in ac
cord with the demands made by this
organization and that they would not
return ot work if the International de- j
mands were granted.
General Manager P. G. Beckett, ot
the Old Dominion company, refused to
join the conference and asserts that
he will not enter into any future con
ference with the strikers until he is
guaranteed ample protection for the
men who have been loyal to the com
pany and remained at their posts.
Conference Failure.
As a result of Manager Beckett's re
fusal to enter the conference and the
differences between the two organiza
tions which are striking, this after
noon's conference failed to bring the
strike any nearer an end.
Governor Campbell frankly admit
ted that the situation here was as seri
ous as he had been advised before his
arrival and asserted that John B. Mc
Bride, representative of the depart
ment of labor, who will arrive in Globe
tomorrow morning, will "have a most
difficult job in attempting to bring the
two striking Organizations together,
owing to the bitterness displayed be
tween the rival leaders."
''The end is not in sight," said Gov
ernor Campbell, "and from what I saw
today .and what Industrial Workers in
formed me, it may even require Inter
vention by the government before
peace and harmony is restored out oi 1
the present chaos."
The governor declared that he was
disapppinted at his failure to make any
progress toward a settlement of diffi
culties today and said that he would
not make any further attempt to bring
the factions together until the arrival
of McBride.
May Rush Mines. ,
One of the principal' differences Tie
tween the two organizations U the re-
Icent permission granted by the secrt-
tary, George Smith, of the Ietnrnat.On
al, allowing the pump men who arc
now working in the mine, to remain at
their posts, while the Metal Mine
Workers insist upon them coming out.
So serious has this difference be
come that rumors are currnet in both
Globe and Miami tnat Industrial
Workers plan to rush the mine some
time tonight for the purpose of taking
the men away from the pumps, in
ternational men assert that they will
join with the guards in any effort to
prevent an attempt of this kind. j
Although the pump men are work-'
ing almost cotninuousiy with short !
crews they were given some assist-:
ance today when clerks fiOm the Old i
Dominion office aided them. Men with ;
white collars also entered the engine
room and helped the engineers wipe !
off the machinery.
The truck load of supplies which
was allowed to pass the picket lines
this morning will last but three days,
it was reported. I'nion leaders refused
to state whether they would allow any I

it's a matter of business
and common sense.
That's why you ought

you buy from the dealer.
Paint isn't like an
apple you can't tell by
looking at it or by biting
it how good or bad it
is.
It takes weeks, perhaps
months, and maybe a
year or more to tell
whether vit was worth
what you paid.

an executive department of the United
States has seen fit to divert dispatches
from their destination and withhold
them for official inspection.
In this case no notice of the govern
ment's intention was given and the
first intimation of the practice came
when last night dispatches addressed
to the Associated Press at New York
by its Paris correspondent were, by of
ficial order, delivered to the secretary
Of war in Washington, who, after in
specting these dispatches, delivered
them to the Associated Press here.
Other dispatches delivered to the sec
retary of war here today, addressed in
the same way and through the com
mittee on public information, were de
livered to the Associated Press in
Washington with certain portions
eliminated.
The volume of matter diverted to
Washington was very large and no
adequate piOvision for the examina
tion or censorship had been made. The
war department was overwhelmed and
a consequent delay of hours in impor
tant dispatches resulted.
Assurance has been given by Secre
tary Baker that the new procedure Is
to be practiced only temporarily and
that doubtless censorship will be short
lived. Baker's Statement I
NEW YORK, July 4. Secretary of!
War Baker reiterated, on his arrival
here tonight to deliver an Independ
ence Day address, that the new war
department censorship is only tempo
rary. "The present arrangement is only a
temporary one," he said, "and will be
maintained only so long as Is neces
sary to perfect a smooth-working plan
to handle this matter without imperil
ing the lives of American citizens. I
am sure the Associated Press is just
as much interested in this object as
are we."
Asked as to the probable duration of
the present arrangement Secretary
Baker said it was impossible to state.

How Long Must I Suffer
From the Pangs of Rheumatism?
Is there no real relief in sight?
Doubtless like other sufferers, you
have often asked yourself this ques
tion, which continues to remain unanswered.
Science has proven that your Rheu
matism is caused by a germ in your
blood, and the only way to reach it is
by a remedy which eliminates and re
moves these little pain demons from
your blood. This explains why lini
ments and lotions can do no perma
nent good, for they cannot possibly
reach these germs which infest your
blood by the millions.
S. S. S. has been successfully used
for Rheumatism for more than fifty
years. Try it to-day, and you will
find yourself at last on the right
track to get rid of your Rheumatism.

. YOU FELLOWS ON THE SIDEWALK.
How did you fellows on the sidewalk feel while the
parade was swinging by yesterday morning? Didn't you
feel kind of cheap and small and mean as you slouched
there in idleness while loyal citizens and workingmen of
your city marched proudly by carrying the stars and
stripes? Honest, now, fellows, how DID you feel?
Away down deep in your heart, were you not ashamed
of your sorry and disgraceful position on the anniversary
of your country's birth?
This great little city never did herself more proud
than when her people cast aside their mirth and their
employments and formed into that monster procession
that wound so gayly and so bravely down the sun kissed
canyon.
How proudly the men stepped along! Heads back,
eyes shining, inspired by a high resolve. And the women,
too, were stirred by patriotism. In white dresses thoy
marched In the dust of the streets. And then came the
children, the boys and girls who will some day be called
upon to sow and reap and work and win for the Republic.
It was a great parade. Everybody in town worth while
talked about it all the rest of the day. Strangers here
from the north, the east and Pacific coast, looked on in
wonder at tlie fine showing of patriotism and earnest
ness, of these mountain folks who never do things by
t
halves. .
v
The first ambition of every real boy is to follow a band.
Then when he gets Into his teens he wants, worse than
anything else, to march in a parade. Nothing stirs the
blood and arouses the highest enthusiasm like the !llt
and swing of many men marching together along the
streets of their own town. They are part q.a cause,
carryfng it along. They are lifted cut of themselves. A
parade is public opinion, public sympathy, public ex
pression. In action. Every man with a drop of red blood
in his veins likes to get out and march with his friends
and townsmen. The call of marching feet affects them
all alike, the old men and the young.
But you fellows on the sidewalk yesterday, honest,
now, how did you feel when the band played the nationr.l
hymn and the marchers wave their flags and cheered?
Didn't you have just a doubt or two. and a qualm or two
about your course? What did you think of your leaders
and their loud words then? Pretty muddy water they
have led you into, isn't it? They have led you away from
the recognized leaders and friends of union labor. They
have led you away from your savings bank window.
They have led you away from your work and your habits
of industry. They have led you away from your pleas
ant and friendly associations with your,fe!low workmen
and your neighbors and townsmen. '
And it has come already to pass that when Bisbee, your
city, celebrates the birthday of the nation, you stand of
at one side and watch the parade go by. You have be
come a stray dog in the city's affairs. You are on the
outside looking in. You are a barnacle on the side of
the ship. You are not pulling your weight in the boat.
How do you feel about it? How much longer are you
going to be an ostrich with your head In the sand nd
all the rest of your body and your happiness exposed to
destruction?
If these was any finer sight in the world than that of
the American flag floating from the mountain top above
Bisbee yesterday then tlie people of this town are agreed
that they have never seen it. The stern, high, stubborn,
enduring hill frowning upon us in all its ugliness and
yet giving generously to us of its vast wealth. The
glorious emblem of the Republic streaming above the
rocks and crags. Both the mountain and the flag adorned
and protected our valley. .
The boys of the navy are all swelled up over their feat
of not losing a ship or a man or an animal of all tlie
first American expedition to France. And well they may
be proud for it was a most difficult and brilliant thing to
do. Tlie American jack tars are making a fine record
in the World War.' American sailors havr always ranked
with any in the world and American naval gunners and
captains, from John Paul Jones down to Admiral Sims
have never failed to beat their enemies on the sea.
Constantine merely guessed wrong but it cost him
his crown.
THE THREE M s.
Frank A. Scott, chairman of the Munitions Board of
the General Council of defense, sums up the situation
clearly and strongly in a recent public statement on the
progress and prospects of the war. Mr. Scott says:
"This is a world war and the fighting units are nations,
not armies. The preservation of our homes and our coun
try now rests on our ability to win the war. Every
man's brain and energy is needed at the fighting front
or in the ranks of the producers. Every resource of the
nation must now be made available for war needs.
"War has become the most complex of all the sciences.
It uses all of them, and moreover it pushes every science
and every industry which is required at all, to its utmost
limit of performance.
"Munitions today are more than guns and powder, they
are the entire resources of the nation made available for
the "uses of fighting men. Fighting men on the ground;
under the ground; on the sea; under the sea; in the air.
Science must contribute instruments to road distances
over which no man can carry a measuring tape; science
must contribute instruments with which to hear the
miner at work under ground. The engineer, the chemist,
the electrician, the metallurgist, the photographer, the
skilled workman, each must have the best there is in
him and in his art, if victory is to be attained.
"We inust have valor and patience and persistence in
our fighting men if we are to win; and these fine, soldierly j dep-riving tne defendant of its property
qualities will avail nothing unless they are sustained and j without due process of law in inipos-
backed up every day and hour by the brain work and the
brawn work of the producers of this country.
"Men, Metal and Machinery are three "M's" that go far
toward national ability to wage modem war successfully.
The United States is rich in all three. Can we make
them available in the right time and in the right way?
We can never answer that question in but one way. We
face the problem, and we will find the answer. We munt
analyze our task; co-ordinate our efforts, standardize our
needs; economize in our methods and then produce, pro
duce, produce. Our three millian square miles of terri
tory contain the greatest aggregate wealth in natural re
sources on the globe; our hundred millions of people are
the most resourseful and energetic of any equal member
on earth. Our scientists, workmen and executives need
yield first place to none.
"To assure victory these resources of men and material
must now be welded together and directed into channels
that will cause a ceaseless flow of fighting men and fight
ing material toward the battle front. To assist in ac
complishing this is the mission of the General Munitions
Board."
EMPLOYERS' LIABILITY
LAW IS UPHELD
BY SUPREME COURT
Supreme Court Makes Ruling
Upon Two Cases One From
The Superior Court of This
County.
Upholding the constitutionality of
the employers' liability law, two ver
dicts for damages awarded against two
Arizona mining corporations for in
juries received by employes, yesterday
were affirmed by the supreme court.
The mining companies are the Inspi
ration Consolidated Copper company
of Gila county and the Superior and
Pittsburg Copper company of Cochise
county.
In the latter case, Frank, Tomich, a
few hours after he first had com
menced his lators for the mining
company, was injured and commenc
ed action against the company, basing
it on the employers' liability law. He
was awarded $8,000. The company
demurred to the action on the ground
that obedience to the liability law vio
lated the Fourteenth Amendment by
ing unlimited liability on it as an em
ployer for personal injuries sustained
by an employe while in its employ in
cases where defendant has been guilty
of no fault, want of care or neglect of
duty and because the statute attempts
to give plaintiff the right to recover
judgment for personal injuries not
withstanding the Injuries for which
said judgment is sought were contrib
uted to by plaintiff's negligence.
Justice Cunningham in his opinion
affirming the judgment of the lower
court says in part as follows:
"Appellant contends that Chapter
VI of Title 14 is void for the reason
its terms conflict with Sections 5 and
7 of Article XVIII of fhe state consti
tution. "Section V is that:
" 'The defense of contributory negli
gence or of assumption of risk shall,
in all cases whatsoever, be a question
of fact and shall, at all times, be left
to the jury.'
"This section does not restrict the
power of the legislature to modify or

A SECRETARY OF HEALTH.
That a physician be made at once a member of the
President's Cabinet was urged by Dr. Charles H. Mayo, of
Rochester, Minn in his address as in-coming president
of the American Medical Association.
Dr. Mayo said that we have our chance to make the!
physical American the type to lead the world in every
calling; that the time has come when we must build up
and guard our own people, when we can no longer re
place men with the old-ime ease; that with the war
producing injured men by the thousands there is a new
impetus to the care ad cure of cripples to make them
useful members of society; that we have a chance to
make progress quickly, and first of all there should be
war prohibition.
One of the most important admonitions in Dr. Mayo's
address was to throw away any belief that there was any
nation superior to ours in medicine or anything, else. He
declared that many momentous medical discoveries of
late years had been made in this country, but had not
received recognition until they had been appropriated by
the Germans and sent back labeled "Made in Germany."
No one has a better right to advise the country in time
of need than Dr. Charles H. Mayo, from whom has come
much of the medical and social progress of many "ear,'date'
negligence. The restriction contained
in the section is clear that no law
shall be enacted which attempts to
make the defense of contributory neg

iterposed they are required to be es-! perintendent 'of tne State Industrial
tabiisbed by a preponderance of the
evidence to the satisfaction of the jury.
Whether the plaintiffs negligence
contributed to the wrong, or whether
the plaintiff assumed the risk and dan
ger from which the wrong arose, must
be determined as a fact from the evi
dence by the jury.
"Section 7 commands the legislature
to enact an employers' liability law.
by the terms of which any employer
shall be liable for the death or injury
of workmen employed in all hazardous
occupations named, 'and any other in
dustry designated by the legislature,
whenever such death or injury is
caused by any accident due to a con
dition or conditions of such occupa
tion, except when such death of in
jury has been caused by the negli
gence of the employe killed or injur
ed." The opinion recites a single restric
tion placed upon the legislature in
j carrying out this constituional man-
That restriction is found in tne
back. Nor could a saner appeal be made at this timel foreging words, "except when such
than that a physician be made one of the advisers of the
president Money, property, war-making, all have their
representative In the cabinet. Why not an expert in the
conservation of human life?
COLLEGE PATRIOTISM.
A short time ago there was a general feeling of disgust
at the attitude of college students. Self-appointed stu
dent leaders, with half-baked notions of socialism and
pacifism, were telling the government what to do about
etc." A careful examination, said tne
court of the act dicloses no violation
of the limitation on the power of the
legislature.
Concerning the allegation of contrib
utory negligence set forth in the de
fendant's answer, the court says: "The
defendant having in its answer ad
mitted that its negligence In part was
the cause of the damage by setting
forth a charge of contributory negli
gent against the plaintiff authorized
a verdict against the defendant in any
event. The matters left open for in-
Thomas E. Pulliam. who has hel.i the
office for tlie past two and one-half
years. The appointment will become
effective on July 10. x
"Mr. Ingalls came to Arizona in lSSS
from Salinas, Cal., and at once became
identified with tlie business and -political
life of the state. Aside from hav
ing held practically all the political
offices in the county of Yuma, as well
as mayor of Yuma, Mr. Ingalls has
been a member of the territorial leg
islature, assistant secretary of the ter
ritory, superintendent of the peniet.i
tiary in territorial days, and for sev
eral years was surveyor genreal. He
is a thirty-third degree Mason and is
prominent in other organizations.
Thomas E. Pulliam. the retiring su-1
perintendent tf tlie industrial school, j
has given an excellent management of j
that institution for nearly three years.
Mr. Pulliam's home is at Flagstaff, and j
he also has held many political off'u es, j
all of which he has administered with j
credit. Previous to going to the in-
dustrial school he was sheriff of Co
conino county.

spectacular martyrdom, and bringing the fine term
"pacifist" into reproach.
The memory of all that misguided and troublesome pro
paganda has now been wiped out. The propagandists
have been suppressed or have changed their minds. They
have turned out to have been wholly misrepresentative of
the student bodies they presumed to speak for.
The young men out of our colleges and universities
have given overwhelming proof of their patriotism. They
have "come across" more enthusiastically than any other
class of men. To many colleges the students have en
listed almost cn masse. Many graduating classes have
been so depleted that It was impossible to hold a com
mencement. In college after college hardly an able-bodied
man remained to finish out tlie year. Nearly half the stu
dents in the country are said to have enlisted as volunteers.

he plaintiff was entitled to recover as
measured by the . allegations of tho
complaint and the evidence, and.
whether the accident was due to a
condition or conditions of employment
and such as is un?voidab!e.
Replying to allegations of irregulat
ity in the trial court, the opinion pro
ceeds: "While the record discloses
many departures from the Meal tiial
of a lawsuit, these departures were
consented to, acquiesced in. submitted
to or indulged by arpellant without
objection, and do Tiot appear affirma
tivcly l'Pn the record t" have worked
a prejudice to appellant's rights. The
verdict returned is largo in amount.
but that matter lay with th-i jiiry. No
question is made that the verdict is
not sustained by substantial evidence."
Much of the same ground was gone
over in tUNse of the Inspiration
company but init case contributory
negligence on the part of the appellee
was alleged that the furnaces he suf
fered, an injury to his eyes, was the
result of his failing to have proper
treatment in time. The judgment of
the lower court in this casO was als.i

ARIZONA NEVER HAD
CHANGE TO GET
A CANTONMENT
Senator Mark Smith Writes
That State Was Never Con
sidered Seriously As Site.
The following letter from SenaU r !
Smith relative to the army canton- j
ment location was recently rceeived in i
Tucson:
United States Senate.
June 27, 1917.
Mr. C. W. Hinchcliffe,
Tucson, Arizona.
My Dear Friend: Confirming n-.y
telegram of yesterday, I beg to sabni.t
Me history of the location of thete
cantonments, which I trust you wwl
present to U.'jse members of the club !
who are interested, and give suc
publicity to it as to show that neither
my colleague, Representative Hayde;i,
nor myself have been in eny way neg
lectful of our duty to the great sta.e
of Arizona in the matter of the loca
tion of a cant'onment anywhere within
its borders.
Gen. Greene, as I have further
learned today, was designated to ex
amine the country west of- the Peci s
and make such recommendatoins a 3
de saw fit as to the proper places fir
cantonments of the national guard. I.e
reported that if ne was to be locate J
in New Mexico it should be at Deri-'
mg; if one was to be located in Ai.
zona it should be at Tucson; if tv. o
were to be located in Arizona the sec
ond should be at Prescott. The wao.e
question before the department wi s !
at what point the cantonment cortsM-1
ering the scarcity ot soldiers betv,-e n
San Diego and San Antonio cou'.d
best be located. It was decided heie
that Iteming would be the most satis
factory i'or army purposes.
The reast n for jitaMishing so niary
places in Texas was because -of tl-3,
sohrter haul in tarnsporting the sc 1- j
diers to them, and a much less hai 1 ,
to a seaport from which, the soldiers
would embark when ready to go to tl o
front. I am assured by everyone ha .-
ing these matters in charge here
from the secretary "of war down thtt
the senators and representatives ha 1
nothing whatever to do with tile i:i-.
fluencing these selections--; that they
were made purely from the standpoit t
of army efficiency and economy - in
the transportation of troops.
There was never the least possib.l-
ity of getting a cantonment in At
zona. The wh'jle congressional dele
gation worked in unison and work i
persistently. There was one canto l-:
ment established in Virginia and nt V
ther Senator Swanson nor Scnat. r
Martin knew anytning about it until
it was done. All New England h:.s
but one location. The great state of
Pennsylvania has none at a'l. TI:
great State of New York has 'only 0" :
so you will see, and my friends in Ari

there has been no nrglinence on the

This film is being releaesd in Los An

that they are released In the big cities.
The Chaplin and Hart program will
