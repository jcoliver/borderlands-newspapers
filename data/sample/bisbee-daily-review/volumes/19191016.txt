Postmaster, General Burleson today
gave the National Hardware associa
tion and the American Hardware
Manufacturers' association, in Joint
session here, the first public account
of his administration, which he has
made since he entered the cabinet
Policies which have made him the
object of perhaps the most bitter at
tacks directed : against any of . Presi
dent Wilson's advisers were explained
and the difficulties of his administra
tion under war conditions were de
scribed, to the, business men forming
the audience. ' ' '
- "Record has Deen made of what 1
stand for," Mr.. Burleson declared,
smashing his fist Into his open palm,
"and lt is not going to be-changed."
Chief among his critics Mr. Burle
son listed the express companies,
which he said were angered by his
development of the parcel post; the
railroads, opposed to changing the
basis of mail pay from weight to
space; owners of pneumatic tube sys
tems, which he declared had been
nothing short of "graft;" newspapers
and magazines, which had been forced
to pay higher second-class rates, and
the American Federation of Labor,
Offended by his stand against public
employes affiliating with an organi
zation using the strike to enforce de
mands. He declared he had been
confronted with powerful opposition
exerted through congress by these
Interests.
Mr. Burleson particularly defended
his enforcement of the espionage act,
which he said earned him the epithets
pf the disloyal because be excluded
sedltionlst newspapers from the
malls.
Turning to current political ques
tions, the postmaster general declared
the welfare of the country waited on
ratification of the peace treaty by
congress and the passage of import
ant, legislation - urged by President
Wilson many months ago. . -
"Now they are Talking about a re
cess in November." he said, "with
many things left undone. If the party
in power undertakes any such step,
the attention of the people will be
brought to the facts."

EASTON, Pa., Oct. 15. Law and Or
rter must be reserved in America and
Immigrants coming here must realize
that when they reach tnese snores, ine
time for the use of force Is behind
them, Attorney General Palmer de
clared tonight In an address at Found
ers day exercise at Lafayette college.
"The mistake which seems to have
been made by many who have come
here recently from other parts of the
world." said Mr. . Palmer, '.'is this:
They affect to believe that the" general
movement for better conditions of life
in other parts of the world must have
Its counterpart in this newer world.
They refuse to see the stupendous ad
vance which has been made in that
movement here during the last centu
ry by men of large minds and broader
visions who preceded them in this
land for the very purpose.
"It Is difficult for us to give credit
for sincerity to many of the ultra
radical "class-war agitators, who seek
the Bhort and rough road hunt by
Force when they have at hand the
smoother, though possibly longer,
rout. It Is perfectly clear that some
of them aro honestly mistaken: If is
equally clear that many of them are
mere self-seekers who would exploit
some of their unthinking fellows for
their own benefit. The Ingenuity of
man nan maae tne Atlantic ocean a

New Inventions will make It narrower

crosses It to rid himself for all time
of all the misconceptions of govern

filled his mind."
PARIS. Oct. 15. (By the Associated
Press) The Clemenceaa ministry was
sustained in the chamber of depnties
this afternoon by a vote of 324 to 132.
The premier thus victoriously emerged
from the bitterest and best organized
assault which the . ministry had ever
faced. The chamber adopter the cab
inet's policy on the chronoglcal order
of elections, placing the legislative
elections first on November 16, and
the municipal elections In that order.
For the first time Aristide Briand,
the former premier, came out openly
in leading the opposition forces, but
M. Clemencean's majority was the
largest he had ever received when the
question of confidence was presented.
Preparations had been going on for
months for this test of strength, the
opposition awaiting the ratification of
the peace treaty to make a definite
onslaught on the ministry.
Premier Clemenceau had a bitter
oratorical duel with M. Briand. The
result of the vote makes it positive
that Clemencean's platform will be
before the people, his opponents'
avowed intention of forcing a post
ponement of the mandate of the cham
ber having failed.

STEEL STRIKE
Conference Defers Action on
Intervention Plan Pending
Outcdme of the Collective
Bargaining by Committees
T 4
Definite Disposal
Is Urged by Gary
Employers Object to Consid
eration Under Pressure and
Intimate Desirfe 'to Remain
Clear Out of j Controversy
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. Despite
repeated declaration by employers'
aeiegates mat iney never would ap
prove intervention in the steel strike
and insistent demand from the same
group that the labor arbitration pro
posal be disposed of definitely, the
national industrial conference, voting
as an assembly, today deferred action
on the labor plan pending an effort
bty the central committee of 15 to
agree on the question of collective
bargaining.
The motion to defer, made by Ber
nard M. Baruch, chairman of the pub
lic group, was put aside under the
group voting plan, the employers'
group voting against it, and the pub
lic and labor group and supporting
postponement. Consent of all three
groups i3 required under the rules to
validate action. On a point of order,
however. Secretary Lane, presiding
officer, ruled that the motion in
volved a question ;of procedure and
not of policy, and therefor should be
settled by a simple majority vote of
individual delegates.
Judge Elbert H.. Gary, chairman of
the United States Steel corporation
board, and Ward M. Bargess of Om
aha, were the . only members of the
public group opposing postponement,
and C. S. Barrett and T. C. Atkeson,
farmers' representatives, alone of the
employers' group, favored the motion
The labor group was solid for post
ponement.
The central committee was directed
to have a report ready when the con
ference reconvened at 2:30 o clock
tomorrow afternoon, but it struck a
snag late today in attempting to de
fine "collective bargaining" and made
but little headway during its three
hour session. The right of employes
to organize was generally recognized,
it was said, tut no agreement could
be reached on the question of deal
ing with non-employes of a company
acting as spokesman for the workers.
The committee will, meet again to
morrow morning, bu it appeared prac
tically certain tonight that no agree
ment would be reached and that the
labor and public delegates in the com
mittee would ask for more time. Such
action -would mean a further delay in
obtaining a vote on the steel strike
arbitration resolution.
Labor delegates said today they
would be willing: to drop the steel
strike resolution in case they can ob
tain a clean cut acceptance to
the,
principle of "collective bargaining"
with the right of employes to select
representatives "just as the compan
ies hire counsel." Failure of the con
ference to arbitrate the strike or to
accept their view of collective bar
gaining would mean disruption of
the conference, some labor represent
atives went so far as to say.
On the "right" of the hall, employ
ers objected to consideration "under
pressure" of a fundamental principle
as collective bargaining. Herbert F.
Perkins of Chicago said: "We cannot
be forced or hurried into arriving at
any decision in such an important
matter as collective Dargainms,
while J. W. O'Leary of Chicago ae
Hred that "clear thinking" on the
issue was impossible with "other dis
turbing influences."
After the meeting," employers' dele
gates said that the labor steel strike
arbitration was never intended for
other purposes than to force recog
nition of the unions and their spokes
men, inasmuch as agreement to arbi
tration of the strike by a committee
containing union officials and com
pany officers would have amounted
to absolute acceptance of the things
fnr which labor is fighting.
Charles Edward Russell of New
York, spokesman for the central com
mittee, told press representatives
after the committee meeting that
both capital and labor were disposed
to make conclusions and that nothing
had transpired to shake his convic
tion that the conference would ac
complish "great and constructive
results. He admitted, however, that
there were serious differences of
opinion which must be harmonized
before the committee could report.

C0I1L STRIKE
INDIANAPOLIS, lad., Oct. 15. Aft
er approving and sending on its way
to the four thousand local unions in
the country the official order calling
on all union bituminous coal miners
in the United States to cease coal pro
duction at midnight October 31, John
L. Lewis, acting president of the
United Mine Workers of America, left
here late today for Washington to at
tend a conference, called by Secretary
Wilson, with Thomas T. Brewster,
president ot the Coal Operators' asso
ciation. Mr. Lewis will arrive in
Washington late tomorrow.
Before .leaving the city, Mr. Lewis
declared that the only thing that could
prevent a strike of the . miners on
November 1 would be the reaching of
an agreement between the miners and
operators representatives before that
date. Even if that should result from
the Washington conference, he said,
the agreement would not be binding
until it had been acted upon by the
miners at a re-convened convention.
The signing of an agreement by-the
representatives of the operators and
miners before November 1, It 'was
said, however, would mean the coun
termanding of the strike order Issued
today, at least until the convention
acted upon the contract.
The miners head would make no
predictions as to the result of the .con
ference In Washington,
In the mean-
time, he said, preparations for the
strike would be continued.
The strike order warns the mine
workers that there must be no suspen
sion or stoppage of coal production
before the time fixed in the order and
declared that orderly procedure must
be followed throughout.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. Absence
of any new complication in President
Wilson's illness brought from his bed
side late today the assurance that he
Is "getting better." Elimination of.
the recent annoyance caused by a
slightly enlarged gland has removed
the only outstanding obstacle to his
convalescence and about tbe White
House there was manifested a decided
atmosphere of optimism.
With the exception of the news fur
nished him by Mrs. Wilson, the presi
dent has learned very little of nation
al and international developments al
though he Is given dally a general
summary of events. He has at times
expressed a desire for more compre
hensive reports and has asked Rear
Admiral Grayson, his personal physi
cian, for news but always Dr. Grayson
has succeeded in keeping away from
his patient Information that might
prove trying to his nerves. '
The president s appetite Is reported
to be as good as expected and a re
currence of the glandular trouble is
not anticipated. Only a moderate rate
of recovery ia looked for and indica
tions official and otherwise are-that
the improvement announced today
may be continued. - - -
Only the following brief statement
was issued by Rear Admiral Grayson
at 10:30 o'clock tonight:

HOPES FOR VOTE ON SHANTUNG
AMENDMENTS SHATTERED WHEN
SAGES DEVOTE TIME TO DEBATE
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15.-Entirely
filling another seven-hour session
with talk, the senate upset complete
ly the hopes of leaders on bqth sides
of the treaty fight that a vote might
be reached on the Shantung amend
ment or that at least some progress
might be made in the reading of the
treaty text.
The formal reading of the text had
been the original purpose of the long
session arranged for today but the
Shantung question got the floor at
the outset and it soon was evident
that the treaty ratifying body was off
for another field day of debate.
Hoping then that the way might be
cleared for the reading at tomorrow's
session by ending debate on the
Shantung provision today, the lead
ers agreed informally that the amend
ment should be voted on if possible
before adjournment. Both sides lined
up their forces for the test, but when
late in the afternoon Senator Reed,
Democrat, Missouri, began another
long attack on the treaty, the senr.te
managers threw up their hands and
announcd there would be no roll call
today. There has been no formal
agreement, but the leaders hope for
final action on the amendment some
time tomorrow afternoon.
During most of today's session the
debate stuck close to its text, which
was the foreign relations committee's
amendment to transfer the Shantung
rights to China in place of Japan.

and other matter necessary and he
will dispense them upon request. Ap

CHAPTER X We
Graduate into
"llig Time."
Every vaudeville patron, as well
as those who take part in that form
or entertainment, know what "big
time" means. To all It U the ulti
mate of, such success. It means
stopping only at the cities no towns
In "big time" where ihere are sat
isfactory hotels, larger and more
comfortable dressing-quarter.-, for
the artists, and audiences which
stimulate one to do one's best. In
cidentally, more money for the per
former. My slater and I had been informed
that our promotion was likely. After
our first year, in the less important
circuit, the preiiction materialized.
Almost before we knew it we were
starting out; eager arid hoping we
should find a favor corresponding to
what we had already known.
Such a school as I had ht-vi was
not without its effects, some of which
I have related. But more than ever
before I realized I must work still
harder, and be constantly on my
guard to take advantage of what
ever would advance pie in my
career. I sensed that the taste of
the new audiences I was to face
would be more exacting than I had
known, and that meant I must quali
fy to this taste.
Fortune favored me. I was ac
cepted at my first appearance in a
, "blgr time"- vaudeville theatre. That
must iave confirmed what self-confidence
I had. for I continued in ie
same course long enough to carry me
over the danger spot. Thereafter it
was principally a matter of keeping
well, and of using my intelligence.
It was after I had gotten well in
to the work on this larger vaudeville
circuit that I began seriously to con
template a career. Carmella and I
-bad always given ourselves wholly
to our work. No parties after n per
formance. Many were the refusals
we had to make, and our friends
to . say nothing of acquaintances
often thought we were over anxious.
They shid we should relax, occasion-
ally. That, however, we did in our
hotel rooms. We rested, worked on
our songs and planne-.l for our "next
season act." For one always has

BIG STREET PARADE TODAY ILL

When" the Carl Hagenbeck and;
Great Wallace Shows combined visit
Bisbee Show Grounds, Don . Luis, to
day there will be' Seen on the down
town streets a street- parade fhat
represents an expenditure of more
than $1,000,000. It is entirely the

It Is the policy of the Hagenbeck

Not in any way does ihe street
parade resemble the pageants of the
past. It fairly glistens with newness.
There are floats of burnished gold
made by Oriental workmen, costumes
and tapestries from France and Per

Such a condition is conducive to
mental ea-je, which Is helpful to am
bition. In fact, its effect was to make
me want to do more than I was
doing.
No performance I did sver satis
fled me. The oftener I appeared
the more clearly Jid I see defects in
my singing; little lapses which dis
pleased me. Carmella had already
begun to take lessons In singing ias
I briefly mentioned in an earlier
chapter), occasional lessons, made
possible only when she was in New
York. I took a certain satisfaction In
my vaudevilles singing, but . . '. my
desire bean to seek a higher level.
Newspaper reviewers, who wrote
about performances In which I ap
peared, spoke significantly about my
voice. A few discerned what they
called unusual talent, and one writ
er said it was too striking a talent
to be confined to vaudeville. I be
gan to entertain ideas of my own,
and grand opera at last entered my
mind. Before long I, too, had tasted
ray first bit of singing instruction
which did not please me over much.
The autumn had gone into win
ter, and when spring came I was
restless and dissatisfied. It was not
that I did not appreciate my oppor
tunities in vaudeville; merely that I
wanted to get Into an exclusively
musical atmosphere . ... where
only the best things counted.
After the summer of 1917 Car
mella and I began our vaudeville
touring again. I had stopped study
ing with the teacher Carmella- bad .
tried. Day after day I was uneasy,'
almost irritable, under some inex
plicable feeling. I knew . I wanted
something to do that was different
from my vaudeville singing. In No
vember we were appearing In a New
York theatre In upper Broad'way.
I was in good voice that night
Carmella to also. Our treatment
by the audience was noticeably kind.
The next day I met a friend 1n
the street, and by his mariner I
discerned ho had something of Im
portance to say. He was-'studying:
singing (he has a fine tenor 'Voice).'
and it seemed that his teacher' had
heard Carmella and me the previous
evening and was interested in our
voices.
"Come on and talk with him,"
urged our friend, at which I
laughed. ' ;'
"You go, Carmella," I suggested,,

PLAN TUNNEL
FOR VEHICLES
UNDER HUDSON
NEW YORK, Oct. 15. The contract
between the state of New York and
iew jeisey proviaing tor tne con
struction of a vehicular tunnel under
the Hudson River was signed on Sat
urday in the joint office of the New
York State Bridge and Tunnel Com
mission and the New Jersey Inter
state Bridge and' Tunnel Commission
Actual work on the tunnel, it was
said, will be begun in a short time.
The contract provides for the joint
construction, operation, repair, and
maintenance of the tunnel, subject to
appropriations made by the legisla
tures of the two states. The tunnel
is to be exclusively for vehicles and
pedestrians. No franchise or right
can be given to a public service cor
poration except with the approval of
the governors and legislatures of both
states. ' - ' v- . '
The title to the tunnel is to rest in
the states jointly, and if either state
attempts to tax the income arising
from its operation or the property ac
quired in its construction, that tax is
to be :paid ,out. of.the shares of the
tolls .which may be due or owing to
the state levying the tax. -
One provision - is a clause which
would protect either state in the event
of a default by the other. . This was
deemed necessary, since either state
obligates itself at this time, to the full
cost of the tunnel," but only to such
aipropriations as may be made from
time to time by the legislatures. The
legislatures, at their last sessions, ap
propriated 1 1,000(000 each.! It is esti

CELMARS ILL
FIGHT IN UN
Bid
EVENT OCT. 24
With the receipt of a telegram of
acceptance yesterday from Johnny
Celmars, the Pacific coast welter
weight who fought Steve Dalton at
Vernon on Tuesday evening, and who
is known as one of the best welter
weights in the west, the main event
for the boxing card to be staged un
der the direction of Manager O. S.
French at the Grand theatre, on Oct.
24 was definitely settled. Celmars'
opponent will be Frank Loughery, the
Philadelphia Bearcat whose bouts with
Russell Chambers here gave the fans
an appetite for more of this kind of
slugging.
Loughery has been working out
since the beginning of the week, and
with the general good condition in
which he always keeps himself, will
be in the best of shape for the bout.
Celmars has heen fighting steadily,
and will leave Los AngeleB next Sun
day, taking the time between that
date and the day of the fight to ac
custom himself here to the altitude.
He has already fought In Arizona, and
this feature win not take much work
to overcome.
In the meantime. Ad. Wolgast, for
mer ngntweignt champion, who has
staged a strong- comeback on the
coast and who la considered one of the
coasfs biggest drawing cards, has
signified his. willingness to tie-fit in
Bisbee, and It is considered likely
mat ne wm oe one or the performers
in the main event for the Beeond card.
If WolgaBt fights here according to
the schedule, which will make his
date Nov. 7, It Is probable that his op
ponent will be Eddie Shannon, who
should put such a battle
ex-champion as would be worth
nil.. e"e
iiiiica iu Bee.
The preliminsjries for the Oct 24
d re b,n arranged also, and
definite announcement nxi..
these will come within a few days, ac
cording to Manager French.

WHAT'S THE MATTER?
ARIZONA has two senators and a congressman in Washington.
The people o Arizona border district have felt for a consider
able period, in view of the tensity of the international situa
tion existing between the United States and the Carranza-government
of Mexico, more troops should be stationed in the Arizona
military district. There is not a single piece of artillery between El
Paso, Texas, and the California border.
Arizona's Washington delegation has been appealed to to alter
this situation. The condition is a real one, not a figment of imagi
nation. The two senators and the congressman are Democrats. The
administration is Democratic. Certainly if the congressional delega
tion have any power with the administration, they should have been
able so to present the case that action could have been obtained. But
though several appeals have been made, no action has been forth
coming. Correspondence upon the subject between border cities and
the senators and representatives has assumed voluminous propor
tions, but nothing has happened, except the waste of considerable
time and energy, on this end of the line, at least.
At the present time the policy of the war department seems to
be to assemble its surplus forces In the border district in the vicinity
of El Paso and along the Texas-Mexican boundary. El Pa;50 is the
logical place, it is argued, and troops could be sent from there directly
to any point they might be needed. This is fine theory, but unfortu
nately theory and fact do not coincide always. A stick or two of
djnamite will destroy a concrete bridge and delay troop movement
from ten days to a week. A can of kerosene and a match will ob

warfare, Mexican revolutionists have hecome experts in the applica

been delayed not only tor Gays, but weeks. As the crow flies. El
Paso is but a step from Douglas or from Naco, Bisbee, or Nogales,
but as trains do not run on damaged trackage, any of these places
would be days, possibly weeks, away from the concentration point at
El Paso.
Below the Arizona border lie greater American interests in mone
in the border district proper, with many more American lives to be
safeguarded in the Mexican hid of the line, than in all the Texas
border district from' El Paso to Brownsville.

Lightning in the form of Villa struck once at Columbus. Sin;q
that time Senator Fell and Senator Jones of New Mexico have suc
ceeded in having approximately five thousand troopes stationed at
that place on the chance that lightning will strike the same spot a
second time. On the other hand, the Arizona border district has less
troops in it now than for a long time.
We have explained the reasons -why the Arizona border district
feels that more troops should be stationed in it. Can the senators
from New Mexico advance a more cpgent reason for having more
troops stationed in Columbus than in Douglas?
Or la It possible that the New Mexico senators and El Paso's paid
agent in Washington have more influence with the war department
than the Arizona senators and congressman? Douglas Dispatch.
JONES' WEAK CHARACTER
OHN JONES fears lu is a Very Weak Character, if not, in-
Jdeed, feeble minded. He is on good terms with the milkman
and doesn't even think his grocer is trying to gouge him.
He believes the ice man is delivering full weight.. The shoe
dealer has actually convinced him that he isn't .profiteering when
he sells a moderate priced pair of shoes. Son Tom had some bad
teeth filled the other day and the dentist's bill Impressed him as
reasonable. Daughter Mary had to have her tonsils out and he
figures that the surgeon's bill hadn't kept pace with the lower
purchasing power of the dollar. The family took " a little trip
around the country in the car last summer and the hotel keepers
seemed to be real human beings in their charges. They stopped
at a small town garage to have a little work done on the car and
the man said he guessed a quarter would be- about right.
Jones has come to the conclusion there is something wrong
lnside..his head. He knows he ought to denounce all the people
he deals with as pirates and robbers. But they Beem to him to
be about tho same sort of people he is, and he doesn't think of
himself as a pirate. Yes, Jones must be an exceedingly feeble soul.

DOPE RING SCATTERED
IN GLOBE BY OFFICERS
GLOBE, Oct. 15. Agents of the de- i
partment of justice made six arrests
this evening in the first drive of the
federal government to stamp out tire
"dope ring" which the federal officials
claim exists from Nogales to Miami,
representatives of the narcotic division
of the treasury department, in an of
ficial report, state that Miami is the
worst infested district in the country,
and secret service men have been
working here for some time gathering
evidence to back up the arrests. The
officers state that several other ar
rests will be made within the next few
days. It is alleged that traffickers in
dope have been working openly in this
district for a long time and the vic
tims of the dope habit include many
prominent residents of the Globe-Miami
district.
The six arrested this evening were
Mr. and Mrs. Ray Pope, Mr. and Mrs.
Charlie Stein, John Bealls and Louis
Nicklan. Warrants have been issued
for several others and the officers de
parted for Miami to make are arrests.
CANANEA CHINESE MERCHANTS
ALLOWED TO REOPEN STORES.
DOUGLAS, Oct. 15. A number of
Chinese merchants whose stores were
closed a few weeks ago by order of
the municipal government of Cananea,
have been allowed to reopen for busi
ness by the city council, according to
arrivals here, but with the distinct un
derstanding that the stores shall be
losed December 31. During the Inter
im the merchants have promised to
dispose of their stocks of goods they
hold. Several former Chinese have
become Mexican citizens and will be
allowed to continue in business after
their unnaturalized brethren have
been forced out, it was stated. In ad
vocating this plan at a meeting of the
city council recently, the mayor.
Julian S. Gonzales, said he was act
ing at the suggestion of Governor
Adolfo de la Huerta of Sonora, wJio
in conversation a short time previous

merchandising enjoyed by the Chinese.
Similar campaigns soon are expected
to be started in other parts of Sonora,
it was reported today, if the Cananea
campaign against the Chinese proves
successful.

Before the Court
Of all the people that I know
Preachers, diggers, clerks and writers,
The ones I count my firmest friends,
The quickest thinkers, hardest fighters,
Are just the lawyers I sit amongst,
And chatter with when work has lightened
Who know the world, its ups and downs
Who have my 3ad hours often brightened.
They've searched the heart of sinful man,
They've probed it deeply, scanned it well
They wear the cloak of charity,-
And carefully their stories tell. ..
I love them for. their gift of gab,
The keen, sharp brain that's to them given
And sometimes think that they alone
May be the best we have from Heaven!

a number of men from my own home town, which cheered me mightily. To
Lowellwhere Judge Winters talked about a wedding he had had, and while
I liked the pleasing way in which he outlined the ceremony which had been
performed, I was much put out that the groom might find that married life
is often a delusion and a snare, with an empiy pocketbook at the end of the
road. But hear also that the bride is a sweet woman, and well worth her
husband, which Heartened me mightily. To Lawyer Flannigan, with whom
I discoursed heavily, while Midkiff, the deputy sheriff, helped me out in the
hard points. To the police station, finding only a drunk Mexican, which did
not interest me much, although I did try to discover where he had got his
liquor. But no mention of this to the boss or my wife, who have formed a
conspiracy against me, I think. ToSmith & Buxton's, both of whom were
excellent gentlemen, but too fond of Douglas, which I like not, although I
have no sober reason for this. To the office, where I made the telegraph
man do all the work, which, after all, he owes me, having written some very
bad poetry about me. So to bed, hoping we have a good paper in the morning.

BONDS OF 3RD
HIGHWAY BOARD
ARE APPROVED
Announcement was made yesterday
at Tombstone that the board of coun
ty supervisors had approved the bonds
of the third highway commission, and
that the "oard had notified the coun
ty treasurer of its action and of its
belief that this board. ' selected last
week, was the legal highway body of
the county.
County Treasurer Welch stated this
morning that his office would honor
no warrants from any of the commis
sions, other than those dated on or
prior to yesterday. October 14th. It
was agreed several days ago tnat war
rants signed by the old and the sec
ond commission would be honored by
the county treasurer, provided they
were signed by both commissions, but
with the appointment and qualifica
tion of the third commission. Treasur
er Welch stated that he would honor
no warrants from any of the commis
sions, until such a time as one of the
three was legally proclaimed the high
way commission of Cochise county.
' County Attorney's Statement
. -County Attorney flobert N. French
made the - following Htatement ta a
Prospector reported yesterday after
noon regarding the situation: v
- "There is no doubt in my mind that
bo last named highway commission
U the lf gal commission. The men
who were appointed at the September
moetine of the board to constitute thft
hjehwfly. commission were never, to
fct. lcallv a highway commission.
Their bonds were not approved by the
ixiarr of supervisors, and I helievft the
hoard ju-tM wholly within their rights
?n sppninHng : a now commission in
thjr etead. The law states specific
llv that each commissioner snail give
bond io the oountv for faithful per
formance of his duties, in such sum
an the board of supervisors may re
ouire. nrt which bmrf shall b n
trovtd by the board of supervisors.
Inasmuch as the bonds of the commis
sion appointed at the September meet-ins-
were never approved by the board.
It is veT clear that they never were
a commission.
"I do not believe that the highway
commission Is a bodv entirely Inde
pendent of the board of supervisors,
as Rpction 13, Chapter 31 as amended
at the regular session of the legisla
ture of 1917. savs: 'Said highway com
mission shall at least once In every
six months, make and file with the
board of supervisors a detailed state
ment of their proceedings, showing
the amount of money in the Hichwaf
Improvement Fund at the time of their
last statement, the amount of all dona
tions since received, and the purposes
for which said donations were made,
the amount since expended, the con
tracts entered into or other obliga
tions Incurred bv them and still out
standing, the highways in court of Im
provement or completed since their
last statement, and the condition of
the work on each, together with any
other information that they may con
sider ot interest to the public
. "Therefore. I believe, inasmuch as
the county highway commission is ap
pointed by the board of supervisors,
and gives bond to the board to be
approved by the board, and may be
years expending for them $1,000,000
.in build'ng a highway system be
tween Benson and the county line
east of Douglas. He has ben build
ing the paved road from Bisbee to
Douglas.
Before his appointment as highway
engineer he was county engineer and
division engineer for the state. He
built the highway from Pisbee to
Tombstone.
In making the . selection,- R. E.
Fishburn, chairman, made the state
ment that the board was guided sole
ly by the question of efficiency and
picked Mr. Ryan because of his abil
ity and experience.
Mr. Ryan was paid a salary " of
$5000 by the Cochise commission. : ,
Mr. Ryan will report here on Dec.
1, as he is under Contract with the
Cochise county highway commission
to finish the work there. He will
however, devote some of his time -toward
getting the dirt flying in this
county. He will be here frequently
and will Immediately re-run . the sur
vey of the road from AJo to Gun
sight with a view of letting the con
tract for constructing this road as
soon as possible and he will aid the
highway commission here in getting
their organization together.

A pimply face will not embarrass you
much longer if you get a package of
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets. The skin
should begin to clear after you have
taken the tablets a few nights.
Cleanse the blood, bowels and liver
with Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets, the
successful substitute for calomel; there's :
no sickness or pain after taking them-
Dr. Edwards Olive Tablets do that
which calomel does, and just as effec-,
tively, but their action is gentle and
safe instead of severe, and irritating;
No one who takes Olive Tablets is
ever cursed with a ""dark brown tabte,"
a bad breath, a dull, listless, "no good"
feeling, constipation, torpid liver, bad
disposition or pimply face.
Olive Tablets are a purely vegetable
compound mixed with olive oil; you will
know them by their olive color.
Dr. Edwards spent years among pa
tients afflicted with fiver and bowel
complaints, and Olive Tablets are the
immensely effective result. Take one or
two nightly for a week. See how much
