Upon reaching the local Justice

started telephoning throughout the

25 years being included in the charge.

The first man on whom the warrant
was served was "Mike" Cunningham,
vice-president of the Bank of -Bisbee
and for 25 years a resident of the War
ren District. During the disturbances
that preceded the deportations in
1917 Cunningham was frequently the
object of verbal outbursts from the
transient soapbox Demosthenes who
invaded the district in the attempt to
make it a link in the chain which
they were endeavoring to fetter the
nation's copper industry. : -
Others named on' the warrant are:
John C. Greenway, who was general
manager of the Cahimet & Arizona
Mining Company until he resigned to

Many Miners Named
The majority 6f names on the war
rant, however, were those of men
who have for years past been em
ployed in the big and little mines in
the district. They include practical
ly every shift boss, foreman and time
keeper who refused to quit work- at
the time of the attempted I. W. W.
strike. Next to the miners, city and
county officials figured most promi-.
neatly "among those present" in the
list of defendants on the warrant.

exception, the entire police force of

Defendants Aid Sheriff
Although being arrested was a
new experience to thera, the defend
ants appeared to enjoy it thoroughly
and did everything In their power to
help Sheriff McDonald and the other
authorities get all the warrants
served as quickly as possible. By
bringing the blanket warrant to this
city to serve. Sheriff McDonald
avoided considerable delay and ex
pense to the county, as well as to
the men named on the charge. Hav
ing been previously informed that
their names would appear on the .war
rant, the majority of the defendants
secured their bonds before appearing
before Justice Jacks, thus doing

BISBEE AFTER
CAR LOAD LOT
OF U.S.
Mayor Erickson Taking Steps
To Arrange Purchase From
War Department of Surplus
Stock for Distribution Here
""Mayor Erickson stated last night that
he had taken up the matter of securing
some of the government food supplies for
the city of Bisbee and expected to put
the proposition up to the city council at
its next meeting.
The war department having practically
decided to throw the sales of surplus food J
supplies open to the public, the question i
the people now face is how to 'go about '
1.t.- .1.. M . 1 ... 1 4 ft.- l
Mayor Erickson Is taking the proposition
to the local mining companies and in
conjunction with the city expects to se
cure several car loads of the supplies.
The war department sells In car load
only and refuses to sell mixed cars.
Mayor Erickson states that the goods
bought must be paid for within ten days
and that they can be secured from the
zone supply officer at El Paso.
Pressure Is now being brought to bear
on the war department to bring about a
modification of these rules, so that pur
chases can be made In less than car load
lots, but at present the rules call for
car load lots only. r
Other cities have purchased supplies in
this manner and some Arizona cities
have already received the supplies so that
Mayor Erickson feels confident that the
saving in prices will be sufficient to
warrant the city of Blshec attempting
something of this kind.

NEW YORK. July 21. With no

both sides reiterated their determl-'

The possibility of an extension ot
the strike to involve the railroads
appeared today when the firemen,
oilers and tenders on two tugs of the
New York Ontario and Western rail
road walked out. '
The American Steamship associa

CHICAGO, July 21. Ten persons
were killed and twenty-ifve injured
when a large dirigible on its test
flight caught fire and fell five hun
dred feet, crashing through the glass
roof of the Illinois Trust & Savings
bank, Jackson boulevard and Lasalle
street, at five o'clock this afternoon.
Most of the dead were employes of
the bank trapped and burned to death
in a fire caused by the explosion of
the balloon's gasoline tanks as they
hit the floor ot the bank rotunda,
where more thtvn 200 bookkeepers
and clerk, nearly all girls, were work
ing.
The balloon, owned by the Good
year Tire and Rubber company of
Akron, Ohio, had been flying above
the city for several hours when the
accident occurred. When approxi
mately 500 feet above the bank a
spurt of flame was seen to shoot
from the top of the gas bag near the
center ot the aircraft. The crowds
gathered in the streets to watch the
flight saw the machine buckle and
quiver as it started on its fatal
plunge.
Balloon's Occupants Leap to Safety
Four of its occupants jumped and
two landed safely in the streets.
There was nothing to warn the hun

of the coming tragedy; a Bhadow

where 200 were busy and a crash fol

patrons had passed but the clerks
were still at work.

RUN TRAITORS
,S.
WASHINGTON. July 21. A story
of the betrayal of the German high
command through the efforts of the
American military secret service and
of organization among German offi
cers of a venditte aimed at the list of
traitors, was brought to light with the
arrival at New York today of two
Germans, prisoners of war, consigned
to the military intelligence prison at
Washington, D. C.
According to information the myste
rious prisoners, who landed from the
steamship Agammemnon under heavy
guard, were formerly German officers
of high rank, occupying positions of
great responsibility under General
von Hlndenburg. Before the inaug
uration of the American offensive in
1918, operatives ot the American, mil
itary intelligence corps, ' prVvailed
upon them through . inducements
which have not been divulged, to de
liver plans of the . German general
staff covering the proposed move
ments on the western front, probable
lines of retreat, points at which, stands
westward were made and other de
tailed information of inestimable
value.
These German officers , later sur
rendered themselves to the American
forces. Certain of their former asso
ciates had become suspicious, how
ever .and are believed to have banded
to mete out stern justice. Utmost
precaution were taken even within the
allied lines to protect the informers,
but as officials believed that as long
as they : were kept . in Prance their
lives would be in danger, orders were
given for their transfer to this coun
try. Preparations for the moving of the
prisoners were kept a close secret and
it was only through the carelessness
of some clerk that It became known
they were included in the roster of
the Agammemnon when she left
France. The plan was to send the
prisoners to some isolated army post,
where they might be given military
protection for a time. Eventually, it
is supposed they would have been per
mitted to "escape" to some other
country, there to begin their lives
anew. Officials will not say. whether
this plan can be wifely followed now.

Western Trip
WASHINGTON, July 21,
President Wilson was in a
weakened but unwise serious
condition tonight after hav
ing; spent the day in bed with
acute disentery. Rear Ad
miral Cary Grayson, his
physician, said the president
had been in pain during the
day and had been very "un
comfortable." The president's appoint
ments for tomorrow with Re
publican, senators had not
been postponed tonight but
at the White House it was
considered to be doubtful
whether Mr. Wilson would be
able to keep them-
While those close to the
president said his illness
would not result in postpone
ment of his trip through the
west, many seemed of the
opinion that should his ill
ness be prolonged Ihe trip
would be delayed.
Admiral Grayson was un
certain when the president
might be able to resume his
duties.
HOUSE UPHOLDS
USE OF LIQUOR
Only Three Votes Mustered
In Favor of Amendment to
Make It Illegal to Keep a
Wet Cellar In Dry U. S.
WASHINGTON. July 21. The prohibi
tion enforcement bill, drastic provisions
and all. was adopted today section by
section by the house, but a man's right
to store liquor In his home stood up
against all attacks. On the final count,
only three votes were recorded in favor
of an amendment to make home posses
sion of intoxicants unlawful.
Demand for a formal reading- of the
engrossed bill which was not In shape for
this purpose, forced adjournment of the
house tonight and delayed its passage
until tomorrow. The first fight of the
day was over the section giving courts
the right to put under bond a person con
victed of violating the prohibition law.
TITis was stricken out.
When" the house reached Section 35,
dealing with enforcement of constitution
al prohibition and which contained the
provision that It was unlawful to store
liquor at home for personal use. the scene
was not unlike that on a stock market oh
a high sales day.
Chairman Volstead of the judiciary
committee. In charge of the bill, had two
amendments. These fixed the time for
reporting possession of intoxicants. In
one Mr. Volstead offered, and which the
house accepted, the time specified as to
the effective date of constitutional pro
hibition January 16. 1920 was accepted
without discussion. Representative
Ttubey. Democrat, Missouri, announced
an amendment providing that a person
should not possess more than 150 worth
of liquor. ; The house did not take kindly
to this proposal and defeated it.
With this out of the way. Representa
tive Baker. Democrat. California, offer
ed an amendment to make it unlawful to
have liquor In one's own dwelling. When
the vote was called only three members,
and all - of them Democrats supported
the amendment Mr. Paker and Rep
resentative Blanton. Texas, and I'pshaw,
Georgia, the latter an evangelist. '
This section was amended, however, so
as to provide -that puch, liquors must he
for personal conmimptton by the owner
of the dwelling-or his family or 'bona
fide guests. -This restriction, put In by
Representative Steel. Democrat. Pennsyl
vania, was aimed at the man who might
turn his dwelling into a saloon.

Revolvers Supplement Bricks and Other Missies When
Fighting Becomes General in Washington Streets; With
Hundreds of Riot Calls Turned In, Battles Still Are
In Progress at Midnight; Attacks on White Women Cause
WASHINGTON, July 22. The
known casualty toll of the race riots
which broke out in various sections
ot the national capital last night had
' at 2 o'clock this morning reached
four killed and 12 seriously wound
ed, besides numerous minor casual
ties inflicted by bricks and other
missiles.. T& addition to the. killing
of one city detective and the fatal
wounding of another negro by two
negro women, three patrolmen had
been wounded by negro rioters. Two
negros were dead, and four others
were reported to be dying. The rl
ots were the outcome of recent at
tacks by blacks oji white Vomen.
The rioting, which earlier in the
night had been confined to the
downtown section, later spread to
Lthe outljing districts and the police
were unable to estimates the numbei
of casualties. Riot calls came in
rapid succession. One precinct
alone answering thirty-five in about
two hours, time with the calls still
continuing. The number of arrests
were more than 200. Several per
sons. were Btruck by bullets fired
from speeding automobiles by ne
groes driving through white resi
dence sections. Three of these au
tomobiles were overhauled and their
occupants . arrested.
The heaviest casualties occurred
about one o'clock at Seventh and M
streets, where a pitched battle with
revolvers took place. One negro was
known to have been killed there and
dozens-of white and blacks wounded-
The death list in the night's fight
ing later ' was . increased to four by
the death of a City detective, who
succumbed to wounds received ear
lier in the evening, in the fight which
resulted in the instant death of his
fellow detective.
Harry Wilson, the first detective
killed, was shot by a 17 year old ne
gress, who had openedd fire from the
floor of a house across the alley
when the police and guardsmen rush
ed the house which the first was
holding.
Thompson, the second detective
to die, was wounded during the
clash. Only one arrest was made
here, that of the younar negress, who
was shot through the hips.
Many serious clashes occurred
! between whites and blacks on street
cars. One negro attacked on the
back end of a car fired into the
crowd following the car and wound
ed four persons, but was finally
stopped by a city 'detective who was
reported to have sent seven bullets
into the negro's body.
The fighting at midnight had re
solved largely into fighting between
small groups and In one of these en
counters a marine was reported to
have been killed. Although service
men had taken part in the early
clashes,, the most serious were those
COPPER ICE SCALE DISCUSSED ,
AT INFORMAL SESSION OF STATE
CHAPTER OF INI CONGRESS
Members of the Arizona chapter of
the American Mining Congress con
vened at Tucson yesterday afternoon
for the purpose of discussing the wage
scale in the Arizona copper camps. The
copper producers went into session at
1 p. m.. at the Santa Rita hotel.
The conference was an informal
one, it was stated following the meet
ing. While wages have been governed by
a sliding scale, governed by the price
of copper, an arbitrary advance of 75
cents was made during the war.
This was taken off when copper
dropped. This action was taken to
enable the low grade properties to
continue operations.
Now that copper has advanced
again over 20 cents and the cost of
living has not been reduced as an
ticipated, copper producers in Ari
zona, are said to be debating an in
crease in the slldding scale and this
was ths subject of discussion before
the meeting.
Practically all of the large produc
ers of the state were In Tucson for
the conference, among them being
Norman Oannichael, head of the Ari
zona Copper company, and governor
of the conference: L. S, Cates of Ray
Consolidated, vice governor; James s.

sons were shot during a clash between
whites and blacks in the negro sec
tions of th ecity tonight. Four of the
wounded are negroes, of whom two
are expected to die. The other two

The trouble started when the po
licemen attempted to arrest negroe3
fighting among themselves. They re

Brakeless, Axleless
Ford Defies High
Cost of Gasoline
1
Don't hang on to the bull's tail
when he is running away from
you. It's generally a losing race.
Also don't ride in a Ford down the
Tombstone grade if you have no
brakes or rear axle.
Many a Ford owner has been
trying during, the period of the
high cost of living to discover
some meth6d of power other than
35c gasoline and while some have
claimed that they have discover
ed various and sundry, means of
power it was not" till yesterday
that a Ford owner made a trip (
over a mile without the use of
gasoline. Few people, however
have had the good fortune of this
Ford.
Fords have the reputation of
performing" all kinds of stunts,
but It remained for one of local
residenc to top them all with a .
mad rush down the mountain
road,, performing .a sped stunt .
that called forth the mightiest
efforts of the speed officer to
equal. . .
A Ford was ' stalled on the
grade in upper Tombstone Can
yon yesterday with a broken axle
and some - one . kindly suggested
the possibility of coasting down
the grade to the nearest friendly
garage. So the Ford owner jump
ed in his' speed demon and start
ed down the hill. All was lovely
till the car gathered a little more
speed than it was accustomed to,
andthe driver sa wa sign marked
"15 miles," and put on the brakes,
but there was no response. He
started the engine and put . the
gears in to use the engine for a
brake, but with the axle broken,
the engine was useless.
Finally, the driver became
alarmed and began to wave to
pedestrians and shout for help,
but all they saw was a streak of
dust. The epeed officer noticed
the streak of dust coming his way
and tuned up his engine for a lit
tle fun and a visit to the police
judge, but when he caught up
with the Ford and discovered the
difficulty, he began giving the
excited and loudly yelling driver
suggestions as to where the
nearest telephone pole was as a
sure means of stopping the car.
On reaching the. bottom of the
grade the speed slackened up a
little and the driver, -with the
speed officer trying to follow be
hind, succeded in steering up a
side street which ran up hill and
the fliver decided to stop.
There were no casualties.
You .Can't Cure Rheumatism
With Liniments and Lotions
If you are afflicted with Rheu-
matism, why waste time with lini
ments, lotions and other local ap
plications that never did cure
Rheumatism, and never will?
Do not try to rub the pain away,
for you will never succeed. Try
the sensible plan of finding the
cause of the pain. Remove the
cause, and there can be no pain.
You will never be rid of Rheuma
tism until you cleanse your blood
of the germs that cause the dis
ease, b. b. b. nas no equal as
kinsi imrifipf. Rcores of sufferers
say that it has cleansed their blood
of Rheumatism, and removed all
trace of the disease irom tr.eir
system.

rotary eTiRincs and several gasoline
tanks, smashed to the floor.
' Scatter Flames Over Workers
Instantly the tanks exploded, scat !
tering a wave of flaming gasoline j
over the workers for a radius of fifty j
feet. A panic ensued. There werej
only two. exits through which theyj
could leave the wire cage which sur-j
rounded the. rotunda. Men and girls,
with clothing flaming fought their;
way throuRh the exits, uiris on me
second floor ran screaming to the
window aad. several jumped to the
street.
The bodies of the dead were bu
ripii undtT the mass and the dying
crawled away from the scorching I
fire, their clothes burning.
The intense heat made rescue work
difficult until after the fire depart
ment arrived. It was thirty minutes
before the bodies under the craft's
fusilage could be dragged out. They
were burned beyond recognition.
Meanwhile ambulances from every
hospital and undertaking establish
ment near the center of the city
came, and the polite threw a cordon
about the place. Dozens were found

Cause of Fire Unknown
The cause of the fire which
brought the flaming gas bag down is
not definitely known. Non of the
crew could ascribe a definite reason.
Two theories were offered. One
was that a spark from the rotary mo
tors set the gas afire. The other
was that the balloon was overcharg
ed and the sun's rays caused it to
expand and burst, the Tire following
the contact of . thy gas with the
motor.
It was intended to charge the bag
with a pure mixture of hydrogen gas
which i.i not inflammable. It was
conjectured, however, 'that a quantity
of cxy?;e'i became mixed in the
charging 'p'''s. rendering a highly
explosive combination.

AEAD REVIEW WANT ADS.
WASHINGTON, July 21. While the
senate was listening to more debate
on the peace treaty today the foreign
relations committee turned its atten
tion to the program of provisional
American representation pending sen
ate action on the treaty, on the in
ternational commission on . repara
tions. President Wilson raised tne
point in a letter to Chairman Iodge,
asking the committee's approval for
appointment of a representative on
the reparations committee, which is
to have wide powers in finding the
amount and method of collection of
Germany's reparation bill. Such rep
resentation, the president wrote, was
highly important to American busi
ness interests. After an hour's discus
sion during which Chairman Lodge
and others objected that the commit
tee had no power to give such assent
prior to the treaty's ratification', It
was decided to postpone a decision
until tomorrow. Senator - Knox, Re
publican, Pennsylvanna, proposed that
the committee, that neither it nor the
president could carry out any treaty
provisions while the treaty was pend
ing. The League of Nations occupied
most of the time during senate debate.
Senators Pomerene, Ohio, and Harri
son, Mississippi, both Democrats, urg
ing its acceptance. Senator Pomerene

HERE THIS EVE
Tonight the, Warre'n District Ath
letic club will entertaim the ifight
fans with a program of boxing which
those in charge expect will be the
best ever seen in Bisbee.
Kid George, matchmaker, has ar
ranged for 30 rounds of first class
boxing with a ten round bout be
tween Nick Gundy and Ralph Lincoln
as the niafn attraction. Nick Gundy
is the featherweight champion of the
border and Lincoln is the man who
defeated BobBy Burns here on the
nisht of July 4th. Gundy and Lin
coln boh stated yesterday that they
were confident of getting the decis
ion and Referee George says they are
evenly matched and both being young
he believes it will be one of the best
fights ever staged in the southwest.
The semi-final will be a six-round
bout between Johnny Hughes and
Ralph Cameron. Hughes is a Bisbee
boy and is well known here. Camer
on has just returned from everseas
and has a record of fighting there
that should give Hughes a run for his
money.
The third bout will "be 6 rounds be
tween heavyweights; Frank Ford and
Bob Collins. Both are Jocal boys and
have been in training (hard during the
past two weeks, so that this affair
promises to be well worth seeing.
The curtain raiser of 4 rounds by
the Zumsteg brothers, agefc 9 and 11,
will be most interesting, judging by
the performance of the midgets here
on July 4. The doors will be open
and seats can be reserved today at
the Wallace pool hall, the Commer
cial Club and Twomey's for $1, $2,
and $3.

IN OIL FIELDS
Extensive Purchases By the
Guqgenheims Are Typical of
Influx of Outside Capital
Into the Texas Oil Belt
At-STIX. Texas. July 21. It Is known
hy rworded transactions that many men
of staid and conservative Judgment, par
ticularly alontr investment lines, have
entered the oil industry in competition
with the older and larger well-established
operating companies. What the outcome
of th preat influx of new and inde
pendent capital into the various branches
of the industry will he no one ventures
to predict. It is evident that the excess
profits of many large manufacturing en
terprises are beine Invested in oil Jensen
and producing- wells In Texas.
The recent purchase of the extensive
holdings of the Gates Oil company by the
Giifigenheim8 is an illustration of the
general drift of outside capital to the
oil fields of this state. Already sev
eral companies have developed into big
operating concerns through the develop
ment of their respective properties or the
purchase and merging of other holdings.
These growing corporations are following

WO YEARS AGO several hundred of the best citizens of the
i onrfiMindinff thp mining citV of
1 warren uisirni, auu D. - -
Bisbee. Cochise county, Arizona, decided that if they were
to continue to live and prosper in that rough edge of the
"Country God Forgot" they would have to do a little wholesale
scavenger work, and muck out the district of a certain rotten ele
ment of human derelicts accumulated from the ends of the earth.
Of course these old residents, most of whom had resided in the
ditsrict from five to twenty years, might have turned the whole
works over to the clamoring "wops" and allow them to Russiauize
that section of Arizona; but real men don't do that kind of thins
with hands in pockets. They figured that the thing they did was
the oDly thins to be done and those kind of men don't go off half
cocked. Successful ineu are always conservative.
In fact there isn't a man in Arizona with education enough to
read the daily press, and with brains enough to walk straight, but
who knows that the deportation of this sewerage element from the
Warren district, was one of the bet things that ever occurred to
better the welfare of Arizona citizenry. Yet after two years of ob
servation of the e'ean. wholesome effect upon the community of this
job there are still some people we won't say men of that section
who seem to figure we won't say think they would properly serve
the welfare of Cochise county, and Arirona by jailing the men who
mucked out the rotten hole at Bisbeu and made it a fairly decent
place to live for their families.
This issue of the Journal carries a story of criminal warrants
being issuod for these men on the charge of "kidnaping". Might as
well indict the United States government for deporting undesirable
aliens.
Naturally the whole procedure is bom of politics. The old
radical element that Is so dead the buzzards are on a protracted
strike, seem to have it figured out mat me woDmy ouucu nave
day coming yet, and it's up to them to "carry on" till Gabriel blows.
It isn't as though these good citizens of the Warren ..district
might perchance go to Jail there is r.o fear of that. But it is the
spirit of non-appreciation that is shown, and the spirit of strife that
is engendered, that causes one to consider the preposition with sad-
II CSS. f
Not only are the men for whom warrants were issued pioneers
of the district, but many of them representative of the money in
terests that has actually made the district and made it possible for
the present-day wobbly politician to thrive ;as well as affording the
opportunity -for thousands of good citizens to maintain happy homes.
Every observer that has traveled outside the confines of Co
chise county knows that the Phelps Dodge Corporation, the oldest
and largest company there, is the leader there in all things that
make for the betterment of workmen and their families amongst all
the metal mines of the world. There Is no mining camp where more
consideration is shown workmen than at IMsbee. There is probably
no instance in the annals of mining where so great an investment
was made on the chance of a small profit as at Sacramento hill.
The Denn mine belonging to the Shattuck-Arizona company has
been developed for fourteen years without reaching a paying basis.
The Calumet & Arizona Mining company has overcome moun
tainous difficulties, and its policy under so great and good a man as i
Colonel Greenway, has always been well-nigh ideal.
Yet, these are the companies without whose endeavor "Poor
Old Cochise" would yet probably be piles of desolated rock whose
good names are sought to be besmirched by the conviction of their
officials and friends.
The Journal is not an advocator of overstepping the law, and it
is claimed was technically done la this case. But every man knows
there comes times in the history of any people when nothing else
seems likely to prove effective. Last year there were 87,lynchings
in the United States, and many of ths best citizens of the land took
part in the same. In the Bisbee case the sheriff of the county had
charge of the whole affair and would assume responsibility. Cer
tain it is if the sheriff of any county asked or demanded that one
assist him in most any undertaking, the average good citizen would
do so.
The Journal has always maintained that the I. W. W. were the
cause of the Bisbee deportations, and that the action of the sheriff,
the companies' officials and the citizens of Bisbee, was amply justi
fiedand to our mind any attorney or other person who attempts
to defend the wobblies and prosecute the county's best citizens, has
no place in decent society. (Arizona Mining Journal).

WHO WON THE WAR?

"It is right to speak of our allies,"
says Marshal Haig, "but it was the
British army that won the war." Ot
course it was the British army that
won the war. It was also the French
army that won the war. The Italian

Russian army, and if it hadn t been
for the American army, all of the

Springfield Republican:
The president, let us remember,
has now performed, if he has not ex
hausted, his constitution function in
negotiating this peace settlement em
bedded in a great conception of world
nical course in mining designed particu
larly to fit miners to be shift tosses and
foreman.
The rolrse is so arranged that a man
may start any time, and the steadily in
creasing attendance shows that advant
age is being taken ot this factor, and
that the course advertises Itself.
One of the most important parts of the
course is that part devoted to instruction
in handling men. for It is realized that
the shift boss, to his men. is the inter
preter of the company policies, and it is
esesnti that he be a correct interpreter.

When Monday morning came and
he had not come back, Mrs. Cravens
became anxious and started out early
with Al Jagerson to look for him in
the direction she thought he had gone.
Later, Monday morning, the Arizona
Central Bank in Kingman was noti
fied that the lights were still on in
the bank and that the doors had not
yet been opened.
H. H. Watkins and J. H. Rosenberg

When it was learned, however, that
he "had passed through Searchlight on

Liberty bonds were .missing, and that
it seemed that he was short in some
of his accounts.
Monday afternoon a warrant was
sworn out and a reward of a thou

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 21 An under
current of caution pervaded the stock
market today, prices manifesting
considerable irregularity and becom
ing weak in the early active operation
for the final hour.
The Mexican situation, another
sharp break in sterling exchange, ex
pansion of labor trouble and further
reported crop damage were among de
velopments over the double holiday,
which entered into the calculations for
the trading element
Call loans held within their recent
lower and more restricted range, but
time money was in greater demand,
borrowers paying as much as 7 per
cent for virtually all forms of accom
modation. Dealings were only mod
erately under recent high averages,
but the scope of the trading was less,
concentrating more than ordinarily in
motors and affiliated specialties, oils,
steels, equipments and metals, where
extreme recessions extended from 3
to 15 points.
Features of pronounced weakness
included Chandler, Stutz, Maxwell and
General Motors, United States Rub
ber, Texas company, Bethlehem, Cru
cible and United States Steel, Baldwin
Locomotive, Utah Copper, American
Smelting, American Woolen and
American International. ,
Sales, 1,450,000 shares. Bonds in
cluding Liberty and International is
sues fell back variably on smaller
dealings. Total sales ,par value, $13,
150,000. Old U. S. bonds were un
changed on Call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, June 21. Corn develop
ed new strength today, chiefly aa a
result of sharp upturns, in the value of
hogs. Final quotations on corn were
unsettled, cents to 2 . cents net
higher, with September $1.93 to
$1.93 and December $1.62 to
$1.62. Oats finished to cents
down and provisions unchanged to 60c
up.
Bullish sentiment ruled the corn
market throughout the day, for not
only were hog values soaring again,
but labor difficulties both in the pack
ing house industry and in other im
portant lines, seemed to promise bet
ter chance of adjustment than was the
case on Saturday. With movement of
wheat necessarily having preference,
the arrivals of corn were expected to
be small for some time. Profit taking
sales by holders failed, therefore, to
bring about any financial down turns
and a freak break in sterling ex
change was virtually ignored.

COPPER MARKET
T
Since the beginning of the current year
a very radical chantre has taken place
in the copper outlook, says the Boston
Financial News. At that time with the
price for the red metal below the 15-cent
mark, and a hupe copper surplus, not
alone In this country but in most of the
leading nntlons of Europe, the mining: in
dustry was indeed pessimistic. As a re
sult of this situation practically all the
leading mines were compelled to cut pro
duction one-half in order to meet the
changed ordur of conditions.
At the present time, however, a short
age in some quarters is anticipated be
fore long. In New York, most of the
leading selilng agencies have marked up
the price of copper for September deliv
ery to 20 cents a pound while "one of
the local producers has refused an offer
of 21 cents a pound for a September con
tract. "While it was an easy matter to
curtail output, concensus is that a far
different proWem faces the Industry
when steps are taken to increase pro
duction. As a result of the curtailment
a number of miners have drifted away
from the mining section, while a large
prt of the foreign element have, or in
tend to, return to their native lands.
"With the establishment of trade rela
tions with the central powers, while it Is
not expected that demand from these
countries will be enormous for some time,
owing to the ' economic conditions, a
heavy demand in the future is expected.
What this means is obvious.
Reflecting this new condition the min
ing issues have been in keen demand, a
number of them selling at new highs for
the current year. Present indications,
however, are that the coppers will be
much higher before long.
