t
(By Review Leased 'Wire)
CHICAGO, Aug. 17. One hundred
leaders of the Industrial Workers Oi
the World were found "guilty as
charged in the indictment" by the jury
after one hour's deliberation at their
trial for conspiracy to disrupt the na
tion's war program late today. Argu
ments for a new trial will be heard
next week.
The defendants, incluc'-'.ng Wm. D.
(Big Bill) Haywood, general secretary
treasurer of the I. W. W., the highes
position in the organization face
maximum penalty of twenty-seven
years in prison and a $10,003 fine
each.
Federal Judge K. M. Landis in his
charge to the jury, withdrew the fifth
and last count of the indictment which
charged conspiracy to violate the pos
tal laws and particularly that section
excluding from the mails enterprises
in the nature of schemes to -defraud.
The remaining four counts of the
indictment specifically charge viola
tion of the espionage act, the section
of the criminal code prohibiting inter
ference with the civil rights of cit
izens, the selective service act anc the
conspiracy statute.
The close of the case, which has
been before the court for 138 days
was gudden. Two minor witnesses tes
tified at the morning session and fol
lowing them Frank K. Nebeker, of
Salt Lake City, chief counsel for the
government, began his closing argu
ment for which he was allowed two
hours but consumed scarcely half or
that time. Then George F. Vanderveer,
head of the defense legal staff, to the
surprise of all in the court room, de
clared that he would submit the case
to the jury without making a closing
statement.
In his closing argument, Attorney
Nebeker said:
"You have been engaged in one of
the most epoch-making trials in the
history of the country.
"The wisdom of the laws of this
country is not at issue. We obey the
decisions of the highest court and
that is the only way that a republic
can live. Anything that strikes at
that is a dangerous thing.
"Tbe wisdom of the decisions of the
courts of this country is not the is
sue. The industrial system is not on
trial. This case is not against any
interests of honest working men, nor
against any patriotic labor organiza
tion. And no effort is being made by
the government to justify mob vio
lence, or other lawless acts.
"At its very start, the I. W. W.,
struck at the foundations of our gov
ernment. Is it not peculiar that in ev
ery state of the union these fellows
got in to trouble? In a little town an
ordinance is passed. They come and
violate it and say they are going 10
Violate it.
'The documents issued by the de
fendants themselves are enough to
convict them. When you consider the
definitions made by the witnesses on
the stand and compare them with what
they have written and the books they
authorized, the case of the govern
ment is complete "
After the instructions of Judge
Landis, the jury retired at 4:10 p. m.
and Just one hour later announced
that Us verdict was ready. The court
was hastily assembled and the verdict

From Russia Excellent '
UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. The Amer
icans in Lorraine have enlivened an
ordinarily quiescent sector by takingj
from the" Germans" ' the village of
Frapelle, five miles east of St. Die.
The action, which started with the
proportions of a raid in the early
hours Saturday morning, developed
into an erganized attack under the
dash of the American troops immedi
ately after they left their trenches.
The Cerman losses evidently were
heavy in killed End wounded and pris
oners also were taken by the Amer
icans. Marshal Foch has connected up the
battles of the Aiane and the Somme.
Announcement is made that, by a local
attack, the plateau nerth of Au
trenches. about ten miles northwest
of Soissons, has been carried by .the
French and that their success gives
them a position dominating the region
extending northward toward the Oise
river.
The attack while local in character,
must have had plenty of power to car
ry as far ahead as is indicated in dis
patches. The French line from the
Aisne to the Oise has been inactive
since early in July. It ran through
Autrenches to Moulin-Sous-Touvent
and thence northwes:eny through the
Carlepont and Ourscamp forests to the.
Oise. If the whole plateau north or
Autrenches has been taken from the
Germans, the French have advanced
upwards of a mile in that Region.
When the Germans halted their re
treat from the Manie salient and made
a stand on the Aisne, it was assumed
a blow northwest of Soissons would
be struck as a success would outflank
the Germans and compel their retreat
to their old lines north of the Chemin
Des Dames.
Then the Ficardy offensive began
and the eyes of the world were fLxed
on the allied progress east of the Avre
and Ancre.
This drive has recently been almost
at a standstill. Only local actions
have been fought for the past four
days along the line established by the
Germans west of the Somme. Some of
the progress, especially along the
southern sector of the line has been
important, though hardly noticeable on
a map. but the Germans are desper
ately defending every inch of the high
ground southwest of Noyon and south
of Lassigny, as well as the area around
Roye. i The allied pressure is contin-

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY

Associated Press.) The Americans
early this morning captured the
village of Frapelle and eradicat
ed a considerable Cerman salient
in the allied lines. Prisoners were
taken by the Americans an.1 the
Germans evidently suffered heavy
casualties in killed and wounded.
This sector has been regarded as a
quiet one, and today's action began
merely as - a raid into the enemy's
positions. The raid was preceded by
a straight bombardment for a few
minutes, followed by a box barrage
that penned the Germans off from
escape.
When the Americans went over the
top to attack at 4:30 o'clock they suc
ceeded in sweeping all enemy resist
ance before them and the raid be
came an organized attack. The Ger
mans replied heavily to the American
artillery fire and they also shelled the
entire neighborhood throughout the
day.
The enemy fire, which included a
barrage, was ineffective. The Amer
icans have occupied the former Ger
man trenches and consolidated against
counter attacks.

(By Review Leased Wire)
VIENNA, Aug. 17 ivia London).
Dritisli recognition of the Czecho-SIo-
vaks as a nation was denounced in
n official statement issued here to
day. The statement declares that the
numbers of the Czeclio-Slovuk army
will be regarded and ;reated as traitr
ors by Austria-Hungary.
The statement says:
'"Tlie form and contents of this latest
declaration of the Uritish governm 'iit
must be emphatically repudiated. The
Czet'.io-Slovaks- national council is a
committee of private persons who have
no mandate from the Czecho-Slovak
people and still less from the Czecho
slovaks' nation, which exists only in
the imagination of the entente.
"Equally absurd is it to represent
this committee as a future govern
ment which as yet does not exist.
'In reference U) the Czecho-Slovaks"
army it may constitute' a part of the
entente army, but it certainly can
not b0 an ally of the entente in the
sense of international law. It is well
known to us that only a sliKht frao
tion cf the sslf-styled Czecho-Slovak
army are. Austrians or even Hungarian
citizens of Slovak tongue.
These dis'oal elements, guilty of
perjury, will not withstand the en
tente's recognition and will be regard
ed and treated as traitors. It cannot
be permitted that the peoples wk.o
have always fulfilled their duT ac
Austrian and Hungarian citizens, and
whoso sons as members of the Aui
tro-Hungarian army fought bravely
against the entente, shall be subject
ed to the suspicion cast upon them
by such methods as employed by the
Hritish official declaration. The Aus-
trc-Hunyarian government reserves Its
steps in this regard."

REVENUE BILL
NOW IS READY
Chairman Kitchin Asserts the,
Measure as Framed Will
Raise Necessary Eight Bil
lion Dollars
(Tlv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 17. The new
revenue bill will raise a total of $S.
000.000,000 for the expenses of the
government in the present fiscal year,
Chairman Kitchin of the house ways
and means committee announced when
the committee adjourned. It is prob
able. Chairman Kitchin said that the
bill will be introduced next week and
be taken up by the house a week from
Monday.
Changes in the schedules not as yet
definitely fixed may lower the total,
it was said. In that event the commit
tee may resort to a customs tax and
a flour tax on tea, coffee and similar
products.
The changing conditions also may
affect the amount of revenue to be
obtained. The committee is watching
the outcome of the effort to pass a na
tional war time prohibition measure,
which the senate is to take up August
24. If a prohibition measure is fen
acted, revenues to be obtained under
the bill will be decreased consider
ably. The next tax on liquors Is under
stood to provide a substantial increase
on whiskey and other liquors and soft
drinks a total revenue of $l,000,ou0,0
or more. Tbe liquor tax rates are be
ing withheld from publication to
guard against withdrawals of whiskey
from bond. The committee finally ap
proved the tobacco schedule un
changed from rates heretofore an
nounced. In the 10 per cent tax of articles
deemed luxuries above a certain price
it made the tax apply to women's
waitsts in excess of 1, ir stea l of
110, as previously agreed to and t
women's hats at J 15 ins'eud of $25.
Motor boats and canoes were add
ed to the 10 per cent tax or. yachts
and pleasure boats, but it exempted
motor boats and canoes costing J'.'O
or less, the exemption being to pro
tect home-built craft.
Considerable interest has been mani
fested In tha normal tax on personal
incomes and the committee announced
the text of the .schedule as follows:
"Normal taxes: Section 210 That
there shall be levied, collected and
paid for each taxable year upon 'he

Less Obnoxious .Than Or
iginal, Opens Way for Fur

(By Review I.axJ Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. The
threatened crisis in the relations of
Mexico with the entente allies and the
United States apparently has been
averted by a modification of tffe lew
! Mexican oil tax by President Carranza.
On August 12 Carranza in ertect can
celled provisions of the decrees of July
31 under which undeveloped oil lands
might be seized by the Mexican gov
ernment upon failure of their owners
! to make declarations and submit to
j what they regarded as excessive tax
lation. The decree of July 31 was an amend-
r"ert of one issued last February

which had given serious concern to j mean the entire American expeditton
the officers of the British and Amen-, ary rort.e jn au parts ef tne wori,j.
can navies because of its interference
j with the supplies of crude oils upon
which their battleships and destroyers
were dependent.
In addition to representations
through diplomatic channels fron
Washington and London, the American
oil producers in Mexico appointed a
committee to confer with the Mex
ican government to seek an equitable
adjustment of the points at issue. They
were willing to pa- any reasonable in
crease in the rate o t tx but feared
that the new decree would put them
out of business and amount to virtu
ally confiscation of their properties.
Th modification now made hardly
will be wholly satisfactory but it was
said today that it appears to make
concessions paving the way for clear
ing up the situation.

would not be surprising to set the
fighting spread between the Aisne and
the Oise, for an allied victory In that
region would break the hinges of both
the Aisne and Somme lines and com

The fighting in Russia has begun to

river and then swinging more to the
northwest until it reaches Onega bay

LOXDOX, Aug. 17 The air ministry
tonight issued the following communi
cation: "On the night of August 16-17 our

airdromes and two railway junctions.
The observation of the results were
difficult.
"In addition to the two British ma
machines reported missing on August

Conviction of the 100 members oi
the Industrial Workers of the World
In the United States court 'at Chi-
! eago, is considered full justification of
the attitude which Senator Fred Sut
ter has taken toward this organize-on
in the conduct of his campaign 'or
the democratic nomination tor gover
nor. This was the tone of comment
on the streets of Bisbee la-e last ev
ening when the word was ftr.;t noised
about the city that convictions had
been found in the famous trial.
In his platform upon which he suo
mitted himself for the election Senator
Sutter frankly and openly denounced
the I. W. V. as enemies t) organized
labor. His is the only political platform
which has been issued by candidates
in the race which has taken a frank
and firm stand on this issue. Frien m
of the senator last night were point
ing to the manner in which his con
tentions were upheld in the United
States court, and declared that his
fearless stand against the I. W. W.
will mean many votes for him in the
primary election.
Senator Sutter scored the I. W. V.
when, in an address before the state
senate last Jti?, he replied to chatges
of Governor Hunt, and defended the
residents of the Warren district from
the acrimony of the governor. Soon
after he delivered this address, he
was persuaded to enter the race fr
govrnor, and in issuing his campaign
platform he repeated his charge
against the wobblies. and declared
himself as opposed to their organiza
tion and methods of conduct.

N RANCH
DEMONSTRATIONS WILL BE MADE THROUGHOUT EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK SO
THAT EVERY INTERESTED PERSON MAY INSPECT THIS
WONDERFUL TRACTOR WHICH IS THE SEN
SATION OF THE AGRICULTURAL WORLD
The "Fordson" Tractor Has Taken England and
Canada by Storm, and Six Thousand Have
Already Been Sold and Shipped to England
ECONOMICAL TO BUY. ECONOMICAL TO RUN, THE FORDSON WILL DO
EVERYTHING ON A FARM FROM PLOWING EIGHT ACRES OF GROUND IN TEN
HOURS TO FURNISHING THE POWER FOR ALL KINDS OF FARM IMPLEMENTS AND
MACHINERY. - :
The "FORDSON" TRACTOR is the result of extensive trials and experiments conducted
by Mr. Henry Ford, covering a period of many years. Before placing the tractor on the market,
every detail has been thoroughly tried out under actual farming conditions in various parts of
this country and abroad.
Experience has pointed to the small, light tractor as being the one machine which will fill
all varying conditions satisfactorily.
In developing the "FORDSON" Tractor, the aim has been to produce a small tractor which
will be low in first cost, reliable, and above all efficient.
Being small, light and economical, the "FORDSON" Tractor is adapted for use on small
farms, as well as on the largest. It will pull all farm implements and do the work generally
done by horses on the farm. In addition, by its belt pulley the tractor will drive farm machin
ery such as a thresher, ensilage cutter, sawmill, etc., making the "FORDSON" a truly universal
tractor.
In design and construction the "FORDSON" takes a long step in approaching the ideal
tractor. The simplicity of its operation and construction will at once appeal to the farmer.
Special device.? were perfected to keep out dust and dirt. All moving parts are enclosed and
thoroughly lubricated. The number of lubricating points requiring attention are ftfvv and easily
gotten at.
The motor, transmission and rear axle are assembled together, forming Qne rigid unit,
which, combined with ihe three-point suspension, relieves these parts of all strain.
The absence of any frame gives accessibility to all parts for making adjustments or re
pairs, and allows the tractor to be taken apart in a few minutes.
The motor is of substantial design and is capable of delivering its full power continuous
ly. It embodies features which have been used with success in other fields for many years.
PERFORMANCE The tractor is designed as a two-plow machine and will
pull two 14-inch plows in the stiffest soil. It will maintain a drawbar pull of
1 .800 pounds at plowing speed. In low gear a drawbar pull of 2,500 pounds is
obtained. t
The fuel consumption varies with conditions; two and one-half gallons
of kerosene per acre being a fair average. The amount of ground plowed also
depends on conditions; eight acres in ten hours would strike an average.
When used at. stationary work and running at full power, at 1000 R. P. M.,
the fuel consumption does not exceed two and three fourths gallons per hour.
The total weight of tractor is 2,700 pounds, with water and fuel tanks filled.
Over-all length is 102 inches, height 55 inches and width 62 inches.
THE "FORDSON" TRACTOR WHICH WILL BE DEMONSTRATED ALL THIS
WEEK AT THE WARREN RANCH IS THE FIRST OF A LIMITED NUMBER
ALLOTTED TO HOOD & BLEDSOE, LOCAL DISTRIBUTORS, SO BE SURE AND SEE
IT WHILE IT IS ON DISPLAY. EVERY STATE WILL RECEIVE A CERTAIN NUMBER
OF TRACTORS SO ACT NOW IF YOU ARE INTERESTED.

An Important Company
Decision
The decision of the Phelps Dodge corpo"
ration to no longer deduct Phelps Dodge
store acocunts from the wages of its em
ployes after October I is a good move and
in the right direction." It has many things
to commend it to the majority of the peo
ple in the Warren district and in Douglas
where its effects will be felt the most. In
the first place it will have a decided tend
ency to promote thrift and saving in the
families of the miners and employes gen
erally. A charge account is a curse as well
as a blessing, for it encourages extrava
gance. Then it places the company store
upon an exactly even footing with the
other stores of the communities. Phelps
Dcdge employes,' buying for cash, can and
will go where they can get the best bar
gains. This will make more than a little
difference in their monthly bills. In other
words the store that advertises and presents
the best bargains has better thanin even
chance to get the business, while in the past
the bulk of the buyers simply went to the
company store regardless of prices else
where. The mining company collected
bills for the mercantile company. That was
all there was to it. .
Plenty of advance notice has been given
so the employes may be enabled to save
some money between now and October 1
and thus face the change from credit to
cash for necessities. The war has been a
great teacher of thrift. People must econ
omize and look ahead. War prices upon
necessities imposes the habit of thrift in all
things. And the conditions of the war have
had much to do with the decision to abolish
as far as possible the old company store
plan in existence in Arizona for many
years. It has served its turn, and it has
been a useful turn. It has kept prices down
in the past and insured against abnormal
charges for necessities and guaranteed com
plete stocks of goods in every camp. But
with the growth of a camp to a city the im
perative need for the company store be
comes much less. It is an important move
and affects the district directly and in no
small way, but it should entail no hardship,
even at first, upon those who prepare for
it, and in the end will result in much good
to both the individual buytjr and the busi
ness interests of the district in general.
Henceforth the company store stands upon
its own feet as a business institution in the
cemmunity without undue aid from the
mining company. Every company employe
is free to buy where he pleases and estab
lish his own credit by means of his thrift
and steady habits and good reputation for
pay, the same as any other citizen. This
move will also add another of the many
recent blows against the old charge of com"
pany control of business and affairs in the
district. Hereafter the mines will be used
simply to mine copper and offer employ
ment to those who wish to work, and that
is all. The company store will go after
business the same as any other store and
have no advantages in the way of securing
that business that any other store does not
have.
General Crowder, when asked by the
military committee of the senate as to the
heavy artillery situation in America replied
that it was uncertain. Asked about the air'
plane situation he hook his head and re
plied that it locked bed. After more than
a year of delay and confusion and mistakes
thrse two vital war problems remain un
solved. All others seem in a fair way to
s'j'c.is. Recent dispatches narrated how
the German planes were flying in flocks
across the American front and bombing
positions, and yet the English and French
have the mastery of the air on their fronts.
Wc have shipped a few planes to France, as
to exactly how many the public does not
know. If we have shipped any heavy guns
the fact has not been given out. The time
for cr.'.cuses for our failure to deliver air
planes, and heavy artillery to France in tell
ing quantities and qualities has about
Sugar Thieves
We are prone to condemn and denounce
the profiteers during war times, but how
about the food hoarders? One is just as
bad as the other, although he works on a
smaller scale. T he average working man
and householder and clerk and office man
will raise Ins voice to the big blue skies to
damn the profiteer, and yet he and his wife
will conspire together and commit perjury
to secure sugar for their household. It is
being done by many people right here in
the Warren district day after day. The ac
tual intent and damage may not be so bad,
but the spirit of the thing, the habit, the
trend of these methods, all are against, the
conduct of the war. They dull the bright,
sharp American edge. They are on the
wrong side of the great question. Are you
doing your best to win the war? Sugar is
scarce in the land. The government has
proclaimed strict regulations in its use.
Stores, hotels and households all over the
land are living up to these regulations to
the letter. Unselfish men and women are
taking their allowance of sugar and no
more and are making the best of it.. And
in their midst are thoughtless or selfish or
careless or vicious men and women who are
securing sugar by deceit and strategy and
bluff and hoarding it. They are getting more
than their share. In a way they are slack
ers. They are dodgers. They are tories.
They are shirkers. They are too cheap and
contemptible and selfish to bear the least
hardship or make the least sacrifice for the
war. Bah! It is disgusting, this petty sub
terfuge to dodge a government regulation.
Instance after instance has come to the
knowledge of the Phelps Dodge store here
in Bisbee where people have secured a cer
tificate from the county food inspector for
twenty pounds of sugar upon the represen
tation that they desire to use for canning
fruit. The idea! Who is going to can fruit
iii any quantities in this district at the pres
ent prices for all kinds of fruit and for
sugar, and then do without sugar for reg
ular household necessities in the bargain.
And while they get twenty pounds of sugar
upon this subterfuge, other families get
their regular two pounds per person a
month and make the best of it uncomplain
ingly and steadfastly, because it is all in the
day's work of winning this war. The Phelps
Dodge store people declare that hundreds
and hundreds of pounds of sugar have been
secured in this way. People who are doing
this kind of thing surely do not stop and
think how reprehensible is their conduct.
It must be carelessness as well as selfish
ness and cheap chicanery. Most folks want
to do what is decent and right i and fair.
Think it over, you sugar hoarder and
dodger, and come through clean on all the
rules of this great and terrible game of a
national war for existence. And then you
can look the world in the face without
shame and without inward self reproach!
Some one asked this column yesterday
as to its opinion on the status of the War
on the western front at this time, and this
column replied to the effect that its opinion
cn said war conditions was about as valu
able and reliable as the views of the office
boy on the same subject. Never since the
war began have the purposes of the com
manders been shrouded in such mystery as
at present. Will Foch strike again ? Who
can tell ? He has been stopped on the Vesle
and on the Chaulnes line and ha3 since
made no determined effort to advance.
Will the Germans counter attack? They
have not made a determined counter stroke
on a large scale since the crown prince was
checked July 1 5. The condition of Luden
dorff's armies is not known. They may be
weakened and shattered from the pound
ing to which they have been subjected, and
again they may be ready for a big drive.
That the past week marks the calm before
the storm no one doubts. But one guess
is as good a? another as to who will strike
first and when. Well informed Critics ex
pect Foch to strike first and they firmly be
lieve he can break the Vesle and Chaulnes
fronts whenever he makes a real effort.
The full fruits of the Marne and Somme
victories will not be realized until these
fronts are broken.

NORTHCLIF FE SAYSj
AMERICANS GREATl
LONDON. Aug. 1G (via Montreal).
Lcrd Northcliffe today entertained at
luncheon a number of Canadian, Aus
tralian and American editors and a
number of statesmen and prominent
citizens of the dominions.
Liord Northcliffe said the way the
colonials had been coming over to help
the old country was one of the most
touching things In history. He spoke
cf Gallipoli arid Vimy Ridge and also
dwelt on what the Americans had done
t CJiauteau Thierry. The Americans,
he said, had proved to be "the goods."
What the Germans had called a mob
In uniform had proved to be an entire
ly new and most efficient kind of an
army.
Lord Northcliffe also touched on the
output of air engines in the -United
States and decalred that this was far
greater than the combined output of
Austria and Germany or the whole
L'ritlsh empire. The new American
Liberty motor, he said, was a wonder
ful prcduction. He estimated that the
I'nited States could produce 10,000 mo
tors each month.
One of the miracles of the world.
Lord Northcliffe said, was the way the
Americans have been transported, and
the efforts cf the Americans in ship
building and food production had been
beyond imagination.
Lord Northcliffe criticised the secre
cy of t'le Dritish censorship by reason
cf -which, he said, the world had never
realized the -magnitude of Great Bri
tain's silent efforts. The best proof of
what had been done, he said, existed
in the casualty lists, which the censor
did not permit to be come known to
the people of Great Britain cr her
allies but was known by the Germans
to a man.
"We" have had 900.000 men killed
during the war,' Lord Northcliffe said.
"Last year our total casualties were
more than SOO.000. These figures are
a sufficient answer to the German
propaganda storie that Ensland was
ready to fight to the last Frenchman,
Italian, American or Man from me

HISTORY OF CASE
CHICAGO, Aug. 17 The fate of the
syndicalist movement in America, the
government contended, rested on the
outcome of the trial of 101 leaders
of the Industrial Workers of the
World for conspiracy to disrupt the
nation's war program, which began in
federal court here on April 1 before
Judge Kenesnaw Mountain Landis.
Tbe indictment against 165 men ann
cne woman. Elizabeth Gurley Flynn,

grand jury,, charged the practice of
sabotage, including the slowing down
cf production and the wanton spoilage
of material, propaganda for strikes to
delay the output of war munitions, ana
covert intrigue against military ser
vice. ,
Forty cf the indicted leaders, sens
ing the government' lntentfcns after
the sensational nation-wide raid and
coniiscaliun of records cn September
5, preceding the indictment, fled from
the country or went into hiding and
escaped capture Miss Flynn and two
other defendants were granted sep
arate trials, and the charges against
a number of others were dismissed for
lack of evidence.
The five counts in the indictment
specifically charged violation of the
espionage act, the section of the crim
inal code prohibiting interference with
the civil lights of citizens, the selec
tive service act, the conspiracy statute
and the postal laws. The maximum
penalty for conviction all five counts
is thirty-one years in prison and
J10.000 fine.
From the first day, .when the group
of defendants, some wearing long
beards, the flowing tie of the poet, oi
sporting fancy waistcoats, filed into
court under heavy guard, until final
summing up to the jury, the defense
laid special stress on the contention
that the I. W. W. had no ir.tercs:
whatever in the war.

To this and other testimony the de

vidual members, that violence was
never advocated by Haywood, Vincent
St. John, his predecessor office, and
the member of the executive hoard.
"If you were buying some silk from
a drygoods clerk who happenej to be

speaking to the jury on sabotage,
"would that clerk be doing you and

THE SERPENT IN THE
MALLEY GARDEN
In The Review office works a print
er of the old school, a master crafts-
man. steady, industrious, modest, un
assuming, polite, inclined even to tim
I idity in talking about or taking part
I In stirring affairs. In fact, most print
1 1 :s of the old school are inclined to
J be cynics upon matters that the street

I These printers, they weigh the
I ponderous and florid generalities of
the writers and statesmen, letter for
letter in its process ot formation Into
the whola. So they are given to
glimpse deeper In to the construction
of the fabric than those who swiftly
scan its finished sentences.
Well, this printer man of the retir
ing disposition, met a friend the other
day and absorbed a drink or two of
a forbidden beverage and fared forth
upon the streets a changed man. In
stead of dodging public issues, he
sought them. Instead of avoiding ex
citement, peril and contentiousness, he
hunted for them in the highways and
byways. -And. as Is usually the case.
Jie found them. In a side street he
chanced upon two Mexicans dressed
in the regulation Mexican peon soldier
uniform of bright blue overalls with
bid and tucker attached. They seemed
to be strangers ln the community. Only
a few days before a dozen or so Mex
ican soldiers had been rounded up
near Bisbee on this side of the line
and taken to Douglas for return to old
Mexico. So to this ordinarily peaceful
printer's disordered mind and under
standing these strangers appeared to
be the remnants of that invading army
who had escaped the roundup and now
threatened the peace and safety of t-ie
town. Strong water3 and intense
patriotism often walk hand in hand.
This small and rotund printer ap
proached these large aAl ferocious
looking foreigners and. taking them
each by an arm, marched, without pre
fix or preamble, straight to The Re

The foreman called a chail meet
ing and international questions were
discussed pro and con. Finally, when

shoulders the movement of the great
bulk of food supplies required and it
will therefore be possible to curtail
the total length of voyage necessary
to bring these supplies to the Euro

able saving in tonnage.
"The great transportation problem
within the next year is to move su:
ficient American trcops into Europe
to give an overpowering strength

"On the other hand, the danger of

TO THE LADIES
Fall and Winter
Announcement
J We have our new Fall and Winter samples ready and
invite you to pay us a visit and look over our wonderful
line.
CJ You have heard of, and possibly experienced, the
shortage of woolens in this country. The tremendous
demand for woolens to meet the requirements of the
government has practically eliminated the majority of
the materials for civilian use. Few manufacturers will
be able to show their usual variety of cloth and styles.
Fortunately our line of woolens is made up of a variety
that cannot possibly be duplicated. We have fortified
ourselves against prevailing conditions and offer you a
line cf woolens that will contain any material that you
may desire.
(J Individuality and st Ie are the important factors in
women's dress. In tailoring our garments, we feature
these principles. Each garment is strictly hand tailored
to individual measurements, and only high grade mate
rials are used, which give lasting wear and absolute
satisfaction.

to hi3 friend Harry F. Welch of Bis

by llu courtesy of Mr. Welch:
Dear Old Harry:
Well, as promised, I will endeavor
to drop you a line or so. Of course
as ti e heading of this letter shows
you can understand that I am now
safely overseas, but don't expect me
to write any details, old scout, as you
can readily understand that for the
good of the service and also the great
cause in which our country is engaged,
all details appertaining to military
cperatkns, locations, etc., are not to
be written. I will state that we had
a nice vbyase with good weather and
Emcoth seas for aimos the entire
journey
Was very much impressed with the
apptarance of the people over here as
one has only to see them to readily
understand the supreme sacrifices ttiey
are making to further the interests of
democracy an the uplifting of all lib
erty loving people. Another thing, I
have no words that are adequate to ex
press my admiration for the Red
Cross, Y. M. C. A., and other orga
nizations that are doing so much over
tere for the comfort and convenience
of the men who must bear the brunt
of this conflict, so alwrfys remember,.
Harry, old boy, that any thing you and
all others at home do for such orga
nizations will add much to the com
fort of some Am?rican soldiers or sold
diers deserving of such and that miht
not have been able to have enjoyed
themselves otherwise, as this game ot
war is such a gigantic affair and the
government needs all the assistance
it can possibly get. Wei!, Harry, there
is not much of anything to write about
in regard to myself excepting to add
that the more I see of the service the
more glad 1 am that I am in it and
am positive of the fact that it Is the
most worthy 1 ever took when I en-
tced it and will do my best to be a
credit to it.

Probably no star value to equal the
name of Mary Garden has even been
presented to the motion picture fol
lowers of the world by any photo
play producing or distributing organ-;
ization. And that this most famous j
woman in the world today should
have waited to make her screen debut
until motion pictures bad reached '
high state of technical perfection and i
had enlisted the services of the great
est living authors, is a circumstance
that gives to picture fans the addeo
value of a story taken from the most
sensational novel of the nineteenth
century, "Thais," by Anatole France,
and a now celebrated trade mark of
quality.
Maryi Garden appears today at the
Central in "Thais."

AIR
CJ I have recently sold two 35x4 GATES HALF
SpLE TIRES that ran from Bisbee to Denver and re
turn on Bisbee air. Think of the satisfaction of making
a trip to Denver and return without a puncture; no tire
trouble of any kind; 2200 miles with part of the roads
a fright. And the GATES HALF-SOLES do not show
much wear. v
Another local man, E. O. Boughter, says: "I have
ran my GATES HALF-SOLE TIRES over five months
without a single puncture. Have ran this pair at least
8000 mile3 over the roughest kind of roads and I tell
all that they are the best I have seen."
CJ The Lowell Motor Company guarantees satisfaction
on GATES HALF-SOLE TIRES and GATES QUAL
ITY TUBES. No better tube at any price and the price
is no more than other first class tubes.
Cjf My business has increased on HALF -SOLES for two
years, showing a steady increase from month to month.
This show3 they must be the right thing.

See to it, then, when parts of your Ford

o'clock in the Orpheum theater. Be
fore his address the Calumet & Ari
zona band will play a popular concert

Senator Sutter's first public oppear
ance in Cochise county during the
campaign, and will be the last appear
ance in the Warren district until the
iiight betore the Primar electioa,

Senator Sutter will deal with all j
phases and issues of the democratic 1
campaign in liis address of Mondavi
night. He is advocating actively fuil I
justice to labor, maximum production !
of all industries through assuring capi-,
tal of a stable condition; inducing j
labor to come to the state; promotion '
of friendly relations between employer
and employe; building of good roads;
promotion on irrigation projects; eli
mination from the state of the I. W. '
W. and other foes of organized labor; '
discouragement of indiscriminate par-1
doniDg and paroling of state prlsoiv j
ers; strict enforcement of prohibition
laws; protection of civil rights of sol-!
diers; merit system in making appoint
ments to puulic offices; careful scrut

Senator Sutter will deal brieily with
most of these principles. He will.

business administration of the state,
which, Jie declares, shoiod be estab

ever, on economy in the state, ana on
the inequality of taxation as it has
been Inaugurated in the state. In
this connection he will call attention
to the facf. that while the mining com
panies riehtlv have had their ta'es
boosted more than 400 percent in the DEMONSTRATION OF REMARK
I ast wve years, tne taxes or tne smau
property owner and tax payer have j
been increased wrongfully in the same

VITAL NECESSITY BROUGHT TO
FORE BY EFFORTS OF AMER
ICAN MINING CONGRESS TO
GAIN RELIEF IN VIEW OF STOP
PAGE OF WORK MANY PLACES
AFTER WAR NECESSITY
DURING RECONSTRUCTION PER
IOD CIVILIZATION WILL FIND IT
SELF MUCH HAMFERED UNLESS
MORE PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF
YELLOW METAL ATTAINABLE
The vital need confronted by the na
tion for more gold, a need that is
world wide and will accentuate in
creasingly as the war draws to a close,
and during the initial period of the
reconstruction era. Is compelling the
attention of the leading banking and
business minds of the country. At
no previous time in the history of the
mining industry in the country has
there been such an array of financial
eyes upon its gold mining districts or
any such conception of the value of
the industry entirely aside from Its
earning power as now exists. There
is also general realization that the in
dustry must be aided to fullest effic
iency at the quickest possible time,
both from necessity as a war measure
and from utmost urgency as a business
preparedness movement for the period
after the war. Indicating the pressure
that exists and that is beiug brought
to bear is' the following statement
issued to the mines committee of the
senate and house by the American
Mining congress:
"The United States occupies a most
enviable financial position among the
nations of the world. The gold re
serves of the world are approximately
J 10,000,000,000, while the total indebt
edness is being increased to approxi
mately J 125,000,000,000.. This indebt
edness is being increased at the rate
of more than '140.000.000,000 annually.
Before the war the United States pos
sessed approximately one and three
quarters billions of dollars in gold. At
the present time our reserves have
grown to approximately three and one
half billions as against an indebted
ness at the beginning of the year of
JS.000.000,000. In other words the
world's, obligations are more than
twelve times its gold reserves while !
our own obligations are less than four I
times our gold reserves. We must not I
permit the I0S3 of this relative ad- j
vantage. ' I
"Approximately 90 "per cent of the
world's gold production comes from
the allied countries; 60 per cent from j
Great Britain and her colonies, 19 pr j
cent from the United States and 6 per I
cent from Russia. The United States j
occupies relatively a most enviable i
position in the world finance, but our
war expenses are so rapidly increasing
the burden of indebtedness based upon
our gold supply, as to command the
attention of thoughtful men concern
ing our financial stability in the fu
ture, and to call for extraordinary ef
fort in maintaining our gold reserves
at a proper ratio.
"During the pre-war period with
gradually increasing costs of labor,
gold mining grew less profitable as is
shown by the falling off of production
from $101,035,700 in 1915 to JS4.456.C0tf
in 1917. It has been estimated by
the best authorities that the produc
tion for the year 1918 will lie 35 per
cent less than during the year 1917.
This estimate was based upon the be
lief that the large low grade produc
ing mines would continue operation.
Much doubt is felt as to the accuracy
of such expectation.
"At a conference of gold operators
at Denver it was virtually agreed that
with the exception of one mine, every
mine in the Cripple Creek district
should have stopped two months ago,
if directed by good business Judgment,
and it was further admitted that with
one exception, that unless continued
for patriotic reasons every mine in
the Cripple Creek district would be
compelled to stop within three months.
This reason applies to all of the strict
ly gold producing districts of the
country, except the very high grade
mines which are very few in num
ber. "Secretary McAdno In a letter to
Delegate Sulzer of Alaska, stated that
"at no time has this country so much
required the largest possible produc
tion of gold as at the present. Next
to food and ammunition, gold is one
of the most needed war essentials.
"We are properly and necessarily
spending a vast amount of amoney.
There is no practiral way of increas
ing the lawful amount of money In the
country, except by digging gold out
of the ground or importing it from
abroad. Already we have depleted for
eign gold reserves to a dangerous

Reaches Sum of $88,413,730
Which Is Increase of $25,
000,000 Over Last Year's
Assessment Roll
By P. U. MILNES.
PRESCOTT, Ariz., Aug. 17. The as
sessed valuation of the producing
mines of Yavapai county, for the year
ending June 30. 1918, reached the as
tonishing sum of $88,413,730, an in
crease over 1917 of $25,390,069. These
figures have recently been compiled
by the assessor or Yavapai county, nd
have been given publicity ior the first
time. They rev..l an indusUvil situa
tion which will be learned ith sur
prise. The above sum means that the
revenue to be derived from niv.ing
will reach in taxes va;d, over $SO.f.0o,
and dees not include patented itiii.es,
operating plants, tnKltors, ii:aehipery
kindred to mining d jvclopiooni and
improvements made on different
classes of properties.
The total assessed valuation of a'l
property in Yavapai county, for iha
current year is computed approximate-
ly at $130,000,000 from which it is'
evident that minesland milling, bear
the heavy burden of raisin; over
three-fourths of the revenue derived
from taxation in Yavapai county. The
above production also showS thai the
output of mines in Yavapai have ad
vanced more than 30 per cent in (he
past year and without taking ino con
sideration what the yield has been of
the small properties, which under the
law are not classed as being taxable,
but in the aggregate would reach to
many hundreds of thousands addi
tional. The copper mines which ni-kc
up the above, are as follows:
United Verde $42,931,670
United Verde Extension ... 41,619,124
Consolidated Arizona Smelt
ing 3,118,423
Commercial Mining Co 362.296
Arizona Binghampton 31G.992
Hayden Development Co. . . 65.525
$8S.413,70
With eight more properties install
ing reduction plants, among ther.i the
United Verde Extension and the Pr:iu
shaw Development company's custom
works getting ready to treat. ;iul a
score of new properties ready' to be
gin shipping on a steady basis, the in
coming year should see Y'avapai min
eral output swelled to a productive
basis of easily over $150,000,000. Only
two of the above producing mines, ths
United Verde and the Consolidated
Arizona, treated their outputs at their
own plants during the year, the rest
shipping to market.
The Arizona state tax commission ,
recently completed its work in assess-1
ing the producing mines. This report
shows a consiaeraoie increase in val
uation for the year 1918 over th.-.t of
1917, the total increase being more
than $90,000,000. This figure does not
include personal property cr real
estate other than mining claims ow ned
by the companies. In Yavapai county,

The deliberations of the American

some legislation on the part of the national government that will afford relief
; from the existing conditions which threaten still further to curtail the output
!of the precious yellow metal.
j The conference adopted a resolution which in effect declared that many
, mines had been forced to suspend oprations on account of the increased cost
or operation tn t.ie last six months; that many other properties are running
at a loss at the present time and are about to be closed down and abandoned
and that a large part of the gold mining Industry of the country is threatened
with extinction. It asked relief of the national goverment for the gold pro
ducers to correspond with the increased cost of production, the extent of
such relief to be fixed from time to time to meet changing conditions.
However, the resolution specified that nothing embodied in it was to be
construed as meaning an intention to alter the amount of gold in a dollar or
to place a premium on gold.
The conference voted to make Uie organization permanent with head
quarters in Reno.
Though this district be a copper producer, with lead, silver and gold

to render most low grade gold mines
unprofitable.
And all the' foregoing hi.sh costs to

j preT,,nt the exploitation and develop-

Even those who have high grade
gold mines are now naturally slack

are not receiving a just or fair price

- Relief Must Be Permanent
Mining Is a vastly costly business,
and the miner whose ledger balance
strikes the wrong side many months
in succession goes over the hills to
the poorhouse.
The world's deficiency in gold coin
is now gigantically enormous and
every moment growing more stupen
dous. Plainly the relief sought must be of
a broad -gaged, radical and general
character, to be effective in this great
emergency.
Rebating to the gold miner the re
cent advance in freight rates, while
praiseworthy, plainly would not be ef
fective. Remission of "excess proft taxes" on
gold mines, while praiseworthy, would
not be effective as relief In our pres

aging, would be futile in attaining

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 17. Trading in
stocks for the greater part of the short
week end session was overshadowed
by steady buying of Liberty 3's,
which sold at the highest quotation in
history, closing at 100.50.
Dealings in this issue were relatively
more extensve than In the 4's and
4hi's, which were barely steady. After
the market's close 100.60 was bid for
the 34's with 101 asked.
Steel and Investment Issues showed
variable recessions at the close. Spe
cialties and other volatile stocks were
less active, but General Motors re
tained much of its 2Va point advance.
Shippings were represented by Ala
ring common and preferred, both clos
ing at gains. Coppers, tobaccos, oils
and war accessories were hesitant.
Canadian Pacific declined 114 points.
Other rails were inclined to yield frac
tions. Sales amounted to 100,000
shares.
Last week's heavy expension of ac
tual loans was offest by a decrease ot
$31,333,000, member banks losing al
most $11,000,00(1 in cash held by the
local federal reserve bank. Another
decrease in excess reserves reduced
the total of that item to little 'more
than $30,000,000.
Bonds as a whole were irregular.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $2,
875.000. Old United States bonds were un
altered on call, during the week.
WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK. Aug. 17. Stringent
money conditions accounted to a con
siderable degree for the week's caut
ious trading in stocks.
War news received the most favor
able construction and seculatlve
cliques doubtless would have extend
ed their bullish commitments, but lor
the lack of time funds.
Investors faced the future with
greater confidence but the only out
ward manifestation of demand from
that querter was seen in the steady
advance of Liberty 3's which made
the highest record since the time of
their issue, attaining a premium of
half of one per cent
Some of the more vital proWoms
inciden tot the war are in process of
solution. Damage to the crops, es
pecially in the south has prompted
greater caution by business interests.
International bankers reported very
light demand for remittance to Lon
don and Paris, but rates on several of
the neutral countries were more favor
able to this market.
WEEKLY BANK STATEMENT
NEW YORK. Aug. 17. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shows
that they hold $30,074,080 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. TQl-s is
a decrease of $10,765,300 from last
week.
FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. Discount
operations of federal reserve banks in
the last week were somewhat less than
the previous week, bills on Hand at the
close of business last night amounted
to $1,497,000,000 as compared with $1,
541,000j000 a week before. Members
reserves increased $44,000,000.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, Aug. 17. Enlarged esti
mates of crop damage in the chief pro
ducing area had a bullish effect to
day on corn. The market closed firm,
to "c net higher, with September
$1.6214 to $1.62 and October $1.63
to $1.64. Oas gained c to lc. Pro
visions finished 2 to 30c down.
Although beneficial rains tenfied to
case the corn market in the earlier
trading, prices soon began to swing
upward.
Most of the buying resulted from a
report by a leading expert that the
yield of the seven s'irplus states would
,be 410,000 J90 bushels less than last
year.
Oats rose with corn. Gossip was
current that the oats shippers had
large contracts to fill by September 15.
Provisions sagged, owing to lack of
support. Weakness was emphasized
by the fact that shipments of lard and
meats for the weok were much small
er than a year ago.

we do to insure its continuation: .Mr.
George E. Collins, an emnent mining
engineer of Colorado, and manager of

mate, showing the cot of production
at this time is 67 per cent greater than
during the pre-war period, while the

would not only be Justified but would
find It necessary to operate its gold

costs might be.
"Is it not more feasible to provide
temporary aid which will offset the in

"How else can the United States

question submitted is most vital as it

task is one requiring most careful con
sideration and the exercise of the best
possible judgment. Should not this
same body give equal consideration to
the task of insuring the stability of the
securities which are and must be sold
to provide for the other two-thirds of
this enormous war expense?
"The American Mining congress
urges its belief that unless the replen
ishing stream of gold production shall
be kept open so that gold reserves
may continue to grow that sooner or
later an excessive premium must be
paid for that gold which will enable us
to keep the promise of our Liberty
bonds. A premium on gold is another
term for a depreciated currency. We
ask your careful consideration."
MINING ACTIVITY IN
MOHAVE COUNTY
DUETOVAR
OLD PROPERTIES ABANDONED ON
ACCOUNT OF LOW PRICE OF SIL
VER AND LEAD ARE REOPENED
AND PROSPERITY NOW REIGNS
AMONG PEOPLE, 13-REPORT
PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 17. Consid
erable activity is manifest in Mohave
county ia several well known mining
sections and a number of old proper
ties abandoned during tho days of low
prices of silver and lead are being
financed and worked with the view ot
these properties coming back to their
own aad once more going on a per
manent sniping basis. Of course, the
high prices of materials of all kinds
and labor is a drawback in many in
stances, but with silver bringing $1
per ounce and the better freight and
smelting facilities of today is overcom
ing the present costs, and gives a
much larger margin of profit than dur
ing the crude mining days of the early
nineties.
Kingman is the center of the mining
industry of Mohave county and is en
joying more activity in all lines than
for several years past. In the old Ce
dar district about twenty-five miles
east of Yuca, the Cedar and Berkley
silver -mines are being put in shape to
resume shipments of ore at an early
date, and Yuca, on- the Santa Fe. is
where this ore will be loaded. The
road east from Yucca is. in tine shape
and is the most direct route from
Phoenix to the coast via Congress
Junction, and as soon as the crossings
on the "till Williams" and a couple
of smaller streams are repaired, will
be a popular route for the coast trav
eler. In the Chloride section, where some
of the largest and richest properties
are located, mining men are confident
that within the next twelve months
will see more properties producing and
on a shipping basis than any section
of the state. Here is located the
world's famous Tennessee mine lying
one-half mile east of the center of
Chloride or practically considered a
part of this little mining camp. This
property has a record of shipping eigh
teen to twenty million dollars in rich
silver-lead-zinc ores, with a depth of
1600 feet; and is said to have more
ore left than has been taken out.
The Scuvlkill and Bullion adjoin t;:e
Tennessee on the north and have been
big producers of rich ores. These two
properties with the Tennessee, it is
reported!!, have joined forces, and. re p
resentativs ar east making arrurge
ments for the machinery for a 500 ti!
mill daily, to be located on their prop
erties and at a point at the end of the
railroad. What great advantages of a
mill of this magnitude will mean to
this district are hard to realize as the
forces of men which will be employed
in the mines and the mill are esti
mated by the hundreds. The entire
mine and mill equipment will be elec
trified and machinery will he of t!ie
most modern that money can buy.
Adjoining these properties on the
north Is the Elkhart mine and mill.
This property shipped over one million
dollars worth of ore and th! deepest
workings are 500 feet. It is si ven out
authentically that large eastern capi
talists are making arrangements to be
gin work in tho near future on this
property and install electrical equip
ment and modernize tiie mill, and it
is expected work will besin within six
ty days. I
Just north of the Elkhart lies the
Chloride Queen, which property ship
ped something like JlMO.OUfl of lugii

It would tend to give greatest con

"cooperation on thp part of every one
that goes v ith a true understanding of
li-.l Cross aims and purpose.?. W
liu"e therefore, set down below at
some length a summarized account cf
the work ip to the present time and
of the problems now before us.
Our Entry Into the War
When this country made its entry
info the war, the Red Cross saw the
necessity of providing: great quantities
of articles which could be made by
the chapter workers, such as surgi
cal dressings, hospital garments, knit
ted comforts and the like. Informa
tion as to types of these articles was
circulated throughout the chipters and
tentative estimates of the quantities
which were to be produced were re
lied upon in arranging- for the pur
chase of the necessary raw materials,
such as gauze, cotton, yarn, etc.
Plans for instructing workers In the
production of the various articles were
rapidly made effective. In a surpris
ingly short time, the chapters were
turning out enormous quantities of all
these articles. In the meantime, the
Red Cross organization for inspecting,
transporting and distributing these
products to the pomts of need was be
ing developed.
Surgical Dressings
The rate at which surgical dressings
have been produced has ben constant-
lv increasing and is now at a point of
higher than our estimates indicate as
neeessarv for some months to come.
This ranidly increasing production has
strained the capacity of the manufac
turers of raw materials to such an ex
tent that there has been serious dif
ficulty in securing sufficient gauzP and
other materials used in making dr?ss
ings. i
Our department of supplies Is work
ing in close coi operation with the gov
ernment to see that regular quantities
of these materials are secured for
Red Cross work. All necessary orders
have been placed with the manufac
turers with every help that can te
eiven the situation by government
prlorties.
Hosoital Garments, Refugee Garments,
Comfort Kits, Knitted Goods
For months past, careful studies
have been In progress, not only by
our commissions abroad but by our de
partments in this countrv, working In
close co-operation with the army and
navy to determine the need for these
articles. As a result, definite esti
mates of their requirements between
now and the autumn are in hand and
have Rerved as the basis for the al
lotments for the work to be done by
the chapters. To make the things
called for by this estimate will mean
that more women than ever before will
be required to devote their time to
this work. Some of these articles are
for our own soldiers and for thofe
who will soon be called to the col
ors, others are for the hospitals or
our allies abroad, both civil and mili
tary, while still oi
fortunate population In the actual "ir
zone of our allies, where tney win
serve to alleviate so far as possible
the suffering of old men, of women
and of children and at the same time
serve as a reminder of this country's
interest and sympathy at a time when
such evidence of sympathy mean to
much to the morale of these sorely
stricken countries.
You are particularly requested not
to purchase through outside sources
any of the materials we carry in stoc k,
even thotieh you may be able to get
more expeditious deliveries thereby.
The reason for this request Is that the
government has agreed to allow us to
participate in purchase of gauze, cot
ton, outing flannel and such staple ma
terials at the price paid by the gov
ernment and on practically the same
terms of delivery, only with the spe
cific understanding that capters
would refrain from outside purchases
of these materials. This condition is
imposed because S'rch purchases tend
to demoralize market conditions and
make more difficult, the government
taslt of regulating the'manufaeture and
marketing of these staple materials.
It Is hoped thatt his long letter may
convey a very clear understanding or
the difficult problem wnich conironts
us and the spirit in which we are try
ing to meet it.
We are confident that every loval
member of the Red Cross will do ths
utmost to promote the efficiency of the
organization so that we may continue
to be th greatest relief agency oper
ating In the war.
Very truly yours.

GIRLPOWER IN THE WAR
By LEE BROWN
There are times in these st'.rirng
days of battles and hopes of battle
that it seems to be rather sad that
one had to be born a girl, and from
every side we hear the phrase from
Kirlish lips. "Oh, if I were just a man,
I would enlist."
A man may enlist, may fipht, a mere
boy may join the boy scouts, a wom
an grown may drive an ambulance
throuKh the battle scarred land of
France or do any amount of different
kinds of hazardous war work, but what
can a school girl do. where does she
come in? She is Just beginning to
realize what she Is missing, with the
busy rushing people that decide the
questions of the day either Ignoring
her or placing her In a pigeon-hole "as
too young and Inexperienced." It is
very hard to wait to grow up to be a
patriot, and it Is very trying to be
given deferred classification, namely
"youth." Only a martyr could remain
aniiahle under the constant reminder.
The American younger generation
Is clamoring for war work. In differ
ent parts of the country a solution is
being found for an outlet of this pent
up energy. In the private Bchools.
and young girls' clubs, classes
are being organized which soon
develop into a vital help to the ;
men at the front and in the front line
trenches. Gone are the days when
just chatting over trilles and sipping
tea made life worth while and one
came forih a tull fledged butterfly.
Now hours are spent in knitting socks
and stitching on warm comforting hos
pital garments. j
These young minds will expand and ;
a great fund of practical knowledge j
will be stored away1 to be used when
the need comes. Lectures and reading j
lessons may be held while knitting '
needles click and busy fingers wind j
bandages, in strict accord with the
warning "that one loose thread may
mean a loss of life." The strictest at-
curacy must be observed, and every j
sort of instruction and assistance may
be rendered by the competent nurses :
or teachers in charge. No attempt j
should be made to bind these little I
workers to their tasks. A feeling of
patriotism is stimulated and most of !
the girls will continue to do steady, ;
systematic work without any persua-1
sion other than interest shown in j
their efforts.
In time the Red Cross rooms will .
become so inviting that Saturday that j
day free from early rising (when at-1
tendance at breakfast is not demand-
ed) figures each in Red Cross cap and j
apron will be found eagerly bending j
over a worktable, handling unweildy i
garments. A task these dainty fingers
never before attempted. There should ;
be a community gathering while the
instructors read to them the lessons
of the following day. This plan has
been tried and found to be splendid.
So there isn't any reason in the world j
why it shouldn't be worked out right j
In August one needs the most sheer
frocks possible, tut the thoughts of
fall will thrust themselves into ones
mind. And everywhere groups of wo
men may be heard discussing this vital
question. Today's frocks cannot be
so plentiful, therefore much thought
and time must be spent upon them,
regarding suitability and distinctive
ness. Little details especially should
be noticed for a variety of novelties
may be used.
In trimming fringe has come to the
front, in every width It may be made
with its threads of cotton, wool, silk
or chenille, according to the costume
it trims. Then, too, the fabric of the
gown may be frayed out. Serge Is
lovely fringed. It is not necessary to
fringe all the edges of the suit ravel
a collar edge, a sash, or the bottom of
the skirt and in this simple way make
the most fascinating of trimmings.
Soutache braid is stitched in intri
cate design, with ends that are sort
of tasseled ribbons. Chenille and
wool embroidery are becoming more
popular each day.
Women seem to be wearing gloves

is certainly dignified for formal en

Tricot
This fabric has become the vogue
in the world of dress. When it first
appeared it was considered to be one
of those materials that are too odd to
last for more than one season, but
next year tricots was as all essential
to a fashionable wardrobe and seems
determined to stay. It seems to be as
i substantial as serge. And such beau
tiful tricots may be obtained.
The silhouette w-ill remain straight
and jackets will be somewhat longer,
slashed in front, and slit lengthwise
for several inches over some bright
colored fabric. Coral red shows pret
tily through the slits of a dark blue
chfviot jacket, and rich warm yellow
Is pretty under plain black or brown
cheviot. Thin transparent Jersey and
thick soft Jersey trimmed with a
furry sort of tricot, are made into
coats and one piece frocks, which are
very desirable costumes for the sea
side. One model of beige wool tricot,
very narrow as to skirt, is lapped over
in front the lapped section rounded
off and girdled at the waistline with
the very narrow girdle that fashion
has decreed shall be the proper belt.
Not only Is tricot worn at the sea
side and in the country, but in town as
well, then women are arrayed in tail
ored frocks of tricot straight short
skirts and simple straight jackets with
a narrow belt. The girdle is often
made of tricot tied tightly about the
waist, the tasseled ends falling short
of the knee.

Boudoir Luxuries
Owing to tin ever Increasing war
work very little time for relaxation
may be found. But after an exhaust

more refreshing than to slip into a bou

esesntial, and of course filmy chiffons
and laces are ever in demand. Flow
ers bloom in fcilken clusters, golden
threads are embroidered in lustrous
charm, and many are the styles and
fabrics from which to choose.
For the active hours of the day, lin
gerie is becoming more exquisite and
more feminine than ever, and needle
work plays an all-important part. And
handwork is not a luxury, for by en
couraging it the women of France and
Italy are given much needed occupa

a lot of good and to encourage indus

WELFARE WORK 1 WA
(Written for the Arizona Mining Jour
Written for the Arizona Mining Jour
nal by Arthur Notman, Assistant Sup
erintendent, Mine Department, Copper
Queen Branch, Phelps Dodge Corpora
tion.) The Warren Mining District has
been favorably situated by reason of
its high grade ore bodies. This has
encouraged the companies to pay high
wages and undertake many plans for
the betterment of their employes and
the community, which they would oth
erwise not have attempted. The
Phelps Dodge Corporation, the oldest
3
... .' t I I
f'" i ."'' U -V -i-' '
and largest operator in the district,
has naturally taken the lead in a good
many of these matters and has been
ably seconded in all essentials by the
other companies.
Even before statehood was granted
to Arizona the district had taken the
lead in organized safety work and a
great many provisions of the state
mining laws were anticipated; such as
gates on all cages, large isolated pow
der magazines on surfece and small
underground magazines carrying 24
hours' supply, safety manways, etc.,
Prior to the adoption of gates on cages
and safety man-ways the records
showed a constant percentage of acci
dents from these causes, which have
now been eliminated.
In the latter part of 1913 the Safety
Department of the Phelps Dodge ( or
pcration was organized and t-ie figures
for the last five years past are as fol
lows: Fatal accidents per 1000 men employed
1914 3.16
1915 105

Accidents are classified as serious ;
which incapacitate a man for more j
than fourteen shifts. The figures for j
the other companies in the district ;
compare very favorably with these, j
The average for all metal mines j
throughout the I'nited States for the
years 1911, 1912. and 1913. which are!
the latest I .have at hand, was 3.S6 ;
fatal accidents per 1000 men employed. I
For the same period in Great Britain J
the rate was 1.39. in South Africa 3.90 j
and in Germany the latest figures j
available are for 1912, when the rate I
was 1.S5. For the state of Arizona, In I
1916, the rate was 3.18.
Safety Department of the Phelps i
Dodge Corporation
At the present time the safety work j
is organized as follows: There is a I
safety inspector in charge of the Safe-1
ty Department; a Central Safety Com- j
wittee composed of representatives of
the employes of each division under
ground together wi'h representatives
of tiie surface departments and the I
management. Beside tr.ee there are I
Division Safety Committees selected
.- t i i
m
D0VS dl
from the employes of each division, the
chairmen acting as members of the
Central Safety Committee.
The duties of the safety inspector
are to direct the work of these com
mittees; make reports on all fatal and
serious accidents to the Central Com
mittee and the management, with rec
ommendations; to organize first aid
and mine rescue classes, and generally
encourage the spirit of Safety First
throughout the organization.
A book of general rulfs for the pre
vention of accidents has been adopted

made; by the Safety committees, re
ports of ?ame being supplied to the
management and the division foremen.
The danger ot typnoid epUeiuica
irom exposure in the mines has been
oiaciicaliy eliminated by the introduc
tion of underground sanitary latrines
itnd the piping of the city drinking
supply to all parts of the miiu: with
sanitary fountains. These measures
of protection together with the mod
ern change houses, in which each man
has a locker where Ins under ground
clothes are thoroughly dried b".weeu
sl.i.is and where he is supplied with
hot and cold water for shower baths,
have helped materially to reduce t.te
dangers of epidemic pneumonia, which
has always been prevalent in mining
citmps at high altitudes. Another fac
tor which has aided materially in
maintaining the comfort and health cf
the employes underground has oeen
the introduction of artificial ventila
tion wherever natural ventilation has
been insufficient to mainlian peeper
working conditions. As with all th- so
other measures there has been a ma
teria! advantage to the company in
that the employes have been atj to
work moie effectively under the im
proved conditions.
Several years awo the Copper Queen
P.ramh cf the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion introduced a physical examina
tion of all applicants lor employment
The purpose of this examination was
the mutual protection of the company
and the men. The provisions of in state
compensation law require the
company to insure its employes against
accident on dity and naturally the
company reserves the right to set a
physical standard for its employes be
fore assuming responsibility. On the
other hand the men are protected from
the danger of exposure to tubeii Miosis,
veneial and other contagious disease
while nt wont. In addition it enublas
the men to secure a thorough n.ejicul
examination without cost which may
disdose some physical weakness of
which he was unaware and lead to its
'.melioration or correction. In order
to insure informity of standard the
work of the examination is conducted
by one physician who is distinct lrom
the hospital department.

trict maintain modern hospitals with

At a cost of over $116,000, tb.3
Phelps Dodge corporation has built a
large recreational building which it
turned over to the V. M. C. A. a num
ber o years ago for operation, rent
free. Together with the other compan
ies, it is assisted materially in the
maintenance of this Y. M. C. A. At
the present time there are about 1S00
members of the association, of whom
over luO't are miners. The building is
equipped with j,ymnaslura, bowling al
leys, pool and billiard taoies, lockers,
baths and swimming pool, together
with other educational and recreation
al facilities. During the past year the
edueutionaI program has been st.-ength
ened and expanded, and its future de
veicpmtnt seems assured. 1-as,, jear
membership iees, at the rate of $10
per annum for alult lumbers, contriii
uted the sum of $13,750.90 to the sup
port of the association while the min
ing companies contributed $10,000.
The Warren company, which is
jointly controlled by the Caiutnet &
Arizona and the Phelps Dodge corpor
ation, at considerable expense, has
constructed a large park in the center
o; Warren Townsite. eciiripned -jvith a
! band stand and concrete dancing floor,
where during the summer months on
Wednesday and Saturday evenings me
band gives concerts and dances, charg
ing a smll fee for the latter.
With strong financial backing from
the companies, the Cochise Building
Loan association is assisting the
m.'nerg to obtain their own homes at
a much lower cost than would be
possiblp otherwise.
Owing to the topography within the
city limits of Bisbee, it is extremely
i difficult to find space for public im
provements. Some years ago a acht iac.
was proposed by the city administra
tion to improve a small area by the
construction of a park. The Copper
Queen company contributed $2, Sou to
wards the expenses of the undertak
ing.
Recently Cochise county bonded it
self for $1,000,000 dollars for good
roads. The Phelps Doelge corporation
is assisting In this devlopnient to the
extent of subscribing to one-half of
this bend issue, although the county
roads are of no direct value to their
operations.
All the companies fully appreciate
that the community's interests are

BILLION SHORT OF DESIRED
AMOUNT TO BE RAISED BY TAX
ATION, MEMBERS WAYS AND
MEANS COMMITTEE FIGURING
WASHINGTON. A'i. 17. With th
estimated receipts possible under the
revenue bill as thus far tentatively
greed upon by th house ways and
means committee from $500,000,000 to
$1,000,000,000 less than the $8,000,000.
000 sought. Representatives Kitchin of
North Carolina, chairman of the com
mittee, annonced Thursday that ihe
bill will not be eady for presentation in
tiie house before the latter part of next
week.
Should the bill be placed before the
house the last of next week, it was
considered improbable tonight that it
could be considered on the floor before
August 26 or 27. Secretary McAdoo
before the committee yesterday urged
that the bill be expedited so that it
might be enactd into law before the
fourth Liberty loan campaign Septem
ber 28.
There were indications tonight that
the committee will insist on Increases
in the lower brackets of the present
excess profits schedule and will mak
little or no Increase in the higher
brackets. The present excess profits
schedule Is graduated from 2 to 60
per cent.
Treasury officials today submitted a
plan to divide business iifto eight
classes on which the treasury wll have
discretionary powers to fix the per
centage of deduction for pre-war earn
ings and where between 8 and 12 per
cent. , '
This plan as submitted follows:
Tax computed by the war profits
methods shall be 80 per cent ot the
amount of the net Income in excess of
the pre-war profits deductions.
For the purposes of this section, the
general pre-war percentage for any
general class of trade or business is
the average percentage of net income
to invested capital for the pre-war
period of corporations embraced in
such general class, determined as
nearly as may be by the commissioner
of internal revenue, with the approval
of the secretary of the treasury, from
the returns made for the first taxable
year under the revenue act of 1917.
for each of the following classes of
trade or business:
Aianufaciuring, mining, mercantile,
financial, transportation by land, tran
sportation by water, public utilities
other than transportation, miscellane
ous. ,
The general prewar percentage
shall in no case be less than S per cent
ncr more than 12 per cent and within
these limits the determination of 'be
commissioner of internal revenue shall
be final.
The general pre-war percentage for
any corporation shall be the pei- cent
ase determine for the general class cf
trade or business to which such cor
poration belongs. If the corporation
is engaged in more than one general
class of trade or business, the percent
ages shall be applied to its principal
trade or business. The war profits de
duction shall consist of a special ex
emption of $3.0tK) plus, at the option
of the corporation, either an amount
equal to the general pre-war per ceut
age of its invested capital for the tax
able year, or an amount equal to Its
average net income for the pre-war
period, increased or diminished, as the
case may be. by an allowance for
changes in invested capital since th
pre-war period.
FORM NEW COMPANY
CHICAGO, Aug. 16. Sift &. Co. to
night announced a plan whereby its
South American and Australian prop
erties are to be segregated and the
title to them is to be given to the in
dividual stockholders of the domestic
company, in return for the surrender
ot domestic stock.
A new company called the Cam
pania Swift Internacional S. A. C
(Sociedad Anonima Commercial),
which probably will be called Swift
International on the street, has been,
formed with a capitalization of $22.
500,000 Argentina gold divided into
1.500,000 shares ot $15 par value.
The exchange plan provides that the
stockholders shall deposit 15 per cent
ot their present holdings and receive
in return as many ot the new $15
shares as they had originally $100
bJiares.
The properties owned by the new
company are in lirazil. Argentina, Vru
g.iy, Paraguay and Australia.
VERY LIGHT ACTIONS
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THE VESLE, Aug. 17, (By the Associ
ated Press.") There was .some bomb
ing and some observation work last
night but nothing to compare to the
previous night when enemy planes
were over the greater part of the allie-t
line, and tar into the bark areas.
French and American airplanes con
tinue their observation work and are
doing some bombing. Additional ar
tillery has ben brought up.
The German position still is of
mobile character, consisting almost
wholly of machine guns at short inter
vals. The line offers on excellent de
fense and at the same time can be
quickly evacuated. Thire were com
paratively unimportant ratrol actions
today but no attacks.
ATTENTION

Is the hope of the members ot th
Red Cross board, that the subsoritv

Born in England
Captain Burgess was born May 2,

being Irish and his mother English.
His parents brought him to America
in his infancy and his early life was
spent near Terre Haute, Ind. He ran
away and enlisted in the Union army
at the age of fifteen and he found his
element. From that time his life was
full of adventure. He arrived in the
territory of Arizona In 18C9, according
to a biographical sketch of him in Col.
J. H. McClintock's "History of Arizo
