WASHINGTON, May . The

regarding the missing NC-4, and
officers were confident that the

after the machine left Rockaway.
As the NC-4's rad'o apparatus has

miles when the boat is on the

unable to pick up any passing ves

ST. LOUIS, May 8. Determined ef
forts by the delegates to the national
caucus of the American Legion, which
opened here today, to force the chair
manship of the organization on Lieut.
Col. Theodore Roosevelt failed and
Col. Henry D. Lindsley of Dallas, Tex.,
was elected chairman.
For nearly three hours the delegates
urged the nomination of Colonel
Roosevelt, who steadfastly declined,
saying "he had no desire to hold of
fice in the organization," but wanted
to be simply a booster. After sev
eral speeches in which he urged the
caucus to "take him at his word," and
nominate someone else he shouted : -
"IH tell you Just why I cant ae.
cept this nomination. They say I am
a politician and that I formed this or
ganization to make a grandstand, play

Shouts of "No', no," drowned him out
and after trying for 30 minutes to es
tablish order Colonel Roosevelt final
ly sank exhausted Into his chair.
Yell "We Want Teddy"
The pandemonium continued for
! nearly an hour, shout3 of "We want
Teddy" and "Make him take it" pre
dominating. The session took on the
appearance of a wild college mass
meeting, various college yells filling
the air and always with "We, want
Teddy" at the end.
Col. Bennett Clark, son of Speaker
Champ Clark, then temporarily took
the chair and told the convention
that it much force Colonel Roosevelt
to accept the nomination and request
ed that some one make a motion to
that effect. The motion was made
but Colonel Roosevelt again insisted
that he could not hold office and the
delegates finally yielded to his wishes
though the men running against him
offered to withdraw and make hi3
nomination unanimous.
Running against Colonel Lindsley,
who was supported by Colonel Roose
velt, was Sergt. Jack' Sullivan of Se
attle, Wash., the 'candidate of the
"Buck private." Sullivan's name was
withdrawn when the state of Wash
ington was reached in the voting and
at his request Major Lindsley's elec
tion was made unanimous. The vote
at the time was Lindsley 630, Sullivan

' Colonel Lindsley, who was decorated
with the distinguished : service medal

He will hold office only until the next
convention which probably will be in

elected first vice-chairman and Sea
man Fred B. Humphreys of Roswell,

over Chief Petty Officer J. G.
Goerke, of New York. A third vice
chairman, ' some member ot the ma
rines, will be elected tomorrow.
Lieut. Col. Erlck Wood of Wash

To Fight Bolshevism
Formal announcement was made
day by delegates from the far west
that they will endeavor to have the
convention take some definite action
concerning the I. W. W. and bolshev

morrow requesting that a petition be
sent to congress urging drastic laws to

FREE OE TREASON
Humbert Cleared in Echo of
Bolo Pasha Case; Death
Penalty for Lenoir
PARIS, May &. (By the Associated
Press.) Senator Humber,- who has
been on trial by courts martial on a
charge of having had dealings .with
the enemy, was acquitted today.
Captain Georges Jile Ladoux, former
chief of the intelligence bureau of the
ministry of war, a co-defendant with
Humbert, was acquitted. Pierre Le
noir, still another 1 of the co-defendants,
was sentenced to death, while
William Desouches was convicted and
sentenced to five years In prison.
Charles Humbert, former senator
and editor of Le Journal, .was arrested
in' February of last year, during the
trial of Bolo Pasha, who was put to
death for treason, and the directors of
the Germanophile newspaper, Bonnet
Rouge. Bolo, it was brought out, had
bought an interest in Le Journal, with
money that come from the German
foreign office throughbankin g houses
in New York.
Proceedings were begun last March
against Captain Ladoux in connection
with the Bolo Pasha and Bonnet
Rouge cases.
Lenoir was accused of trading with
the enemy. When arrested is case
was placed in importance to the gov
ernment higher than that against Bolo
Pasha. He was a Parisian capitalist
and with Desouches bought Le Journal
in 1915 for 10,000 francs and later sold
it to Humbert. The money was de
clared to have come from a German
source. ,
Desouches, although nearly 60 years
old, fought with' the; French before
Verdun. The prosecutor in present
ing the case against him said De
souches knew that the money with
which Lenoir bought Le Journal was
German, but that the defendant's r rec
ord at the front as a volunteer liaison
officer might permit the court to
lighten his sentence on conviction.
CAMPBELL-HARRIS ROW
AIRED 111 PHOEttlX COURT
PHOENIX, May 8. The question of
whether; .or not Governor Campbell
will be permanently restrained from
interfering with Col. C. W. Harris,
state adjutant general and his depart
ment still was unsettled tonight when
Judge Lynn adjourned court after
hearing argumetns on the point all
afternoon.
The argument on the temporary re
straining order which followed the
governor's attempt Tuesday to relieve
Colonel Harris of office and take pos
session of his records was made for
the adjutant general by Spencer W.
Pugh and for the governor by W. H.
Ryan.
Pugh contended that the executive
had no right to relieve Colonel Harris
of office and that the post of adju
tant general and that of governor were
co-ordinated.
Judge Lyman asked if the governor
had the power to vacante an office
without naming a successor, to which
Ryan replied that, under certain cir
cumstances, he believed that authority
did rest with the executive.
The matter will be further aired in
ccart tomorrow.

PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press)
While the German peace plenipoten
tiaries are digesting the text of the
lengthy peace treaty handed them
Wednesday and communicating with
the Weimar government as to the de
mands made upon Germany by the al
lied and associated powers, the coun
cil of four is engaging itself with the
formulation of peace terms for Au
stria and Hungary.
The German-Austrian delegation is
reported already to hpve started for
St. Germain, France, there to await
the summons to Versailles to learn
what is to befall the one-time dual
monarchy in the way of the payment
of indemnities, the making of repara
tions and the relinquishment of terri
tory. Estimates have been made In Paris
that 5,000,000,000 crowns will be de
manded as indemnity from Austria
Hungary in addition to the delimita
tion of frontiers. The pre-war debt
of the former empire and kingdom, it
is said, is to be divided among the
II. S. SENATORS SPLIT ON PEACE PACT;
NOUS SAYS IN ARMY IS TOO BIG
WASHINGTON, May 8. As they
completed their Btudy of the official
summary of the treaty of Versailles
today. Senators began to give expres
sion to their views dn the moment
ous document which is in the hancta
of the German plenipotentiaries. A
few senators, however, still withheld
comment, preferring to examine the
complete text before reaching a defin
ite conclusion. These included Sen
ators Lodge of Massachusetts, Smoot
of Utah, and other republican " lead
ers. ..''
Sharp opposition to the proposal
that the United States in consort with
Great Britain commit itself to go to
France's assistance in the event that
country were attacked was voiced by
Senators Borah of Idaho and Curtis
of Kansas, while Senators Sherman of
Illinois, and Moses of New Hampshire,
criticized the league ot nations cove
nant in the treaty.
Nation League "Crowning Glory"
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska, re-!
tiring chairman of the senate ofreign j
relations committee, approved the
treaty as a whole and said that in his
judgment the "crowning glory of this
great document Is the fact that there
embodied in it the great constitution
o fthe league of nations.' The sen
ator declared the treaty was a "monu
mental work" and measured up "to
the highest moral standards of the
world" with justice as the basis of re
organization. General approval ot the military
and naval terms imposed on Germany
was given not only by both republi
can and democratic senators, but by
officials and diplomats generally. They
concurred in the view of army and
D
newly-formed states which have arisen
or are to arise in their old territories.
U. S. to Be Armenia Mandatory
It is reported that when the terms
of peace with Turkey are concluded
the United States is to be requested
to become the mandatory of Armenia,
and that President Wilson will place
the matter before congress in order
that a decision may be arrived at.
The communist government in Hun
gary is declared to have declined to
accept the terms laid down by Ru
mania for an armistice and has decid
ed to continue lighting. The terms of
the Rumanians include disarmament
and the surrender of war materials
and also the return of war prisoners
without reciprocity.
Trouble seems to be brewing for the
Afghan tribesmen, who, aided by Afgh
an regular troops, have violated the
British-Indian border by crossing it
and occupying certain positions on
the Indian side. The British are tak
ing military precautions and also have
addressed a strong note of protest to
the Amir of Afghanistan.
navy officers that with the carrying
out of the terms Germany . would be
stripped of every vestige of power
necessary for it to disturb again thd
peace of the world, k . n .
Borah Against War Alliance
Senator Borah made no comment
on the treaty itself, confining Jiis,
statement solely to the proposal for a
triple alliance between the three lead
ing associated powers. He declared
that whether the United States should
take part, in any future European war
was "a matter which should be de
termined upon the facts when and as
they arise and by the particular gene
ration which must bear the brunt of
the war and by the intelligence and
the conscience and judgment of the
American people as they see the situa
tion when face to face with it."
"Gag Rule," Says Sherman
Senator Sherman said the "manner
in which the treaty has been present
ed is a resort to gag rule." He de
clared it was "a confession of weak
ness that the league of nations has to
be dragged through as an annex to the
treaty of peace," and said he would
vote to separate the league covenant
from the trety and take a separate
vote on each.
Senator Moses did not regard the
separation of the league covenant
from the treaty as Impossible and said
he preferred the triple alliance be
tween the United States, Great Britain
and France to the league plan as
drawn.
Senator Moses said he was unable to
understand the part of the treaty pro
viding that "except as between the
United States and Germany pre-war

fashion as to convince officers here
that prospects for reaching Plymouth,
navy station, were exceedingly bright.
Each of the three planes had a triple
radio installation when it left Rocka
way. One set was the telephone by
which they communicated with each
other while in flight at a distance of
a score or more miles. Stations ami
guard ships 'listened in" on many of j
these conversations and reported
them. The second set yas the regu
lar long distance radio installation,

As the planes approached', one of
the patrol, vessels, long before it was-!
sighted, -the long distance radio wasj
buzzing. ,v' Questions - and answers j
flashed back and forth, dealing-in-di-

communications wer relayed to and
from the speeding . seaplanes, some
from Washington. One carried greet-
, ings . to Commander Towers . and his
cfews from Acting Secretary Roose
ye'.t, who watched the trip with keen
interest all day' as the department's
messages came in. Another relayed
cabled assurance from' London that
every facility, of. the British admiralty
would be at the disposal of the Amer
ican airmen when they reached Brit
.sh waters.
The communication arrangements of
the navy department worked out per
fectly. Repeatedly niessages from
Commander Towers, : sent from his
speeding flagship of the air squadron,
the N"C-3, reached the' desks of offi
cers here in a few minutes of the time
they were sent. Intercepted by any
of the raido stations -ashore, or afloat
on the chain reaching clear to Halifax,
hey were rushed to Washington on
the na:vy's leased wire. . ' .
The entire operation of the system
was grouped under direction of Lieu
tenant Tunis A. M. Craven.
"Picture Log" Kept
Throughout the day Lieutenant
Craven kept a continuous log cn the
flight, made up from the messages
that came. The log pictures graphi
cally the swift rush northward of tho
big flying "boalts vth Sheir crews.
Even the 50 minutes that'elapsed after
the KC-1 and NC-3 were safely moored

licenses and rights to use for infringe
ments committed during the war are

Why U. S. Left Out Puzzles
"I don't understand," he said, "why
that exception was made as to the
United States or why we are to be left
open to litigation growing out of this
use of German formulas and patents."
Senator Norris of Nebraska,
made this statement: "One thing
that I like particularly about the
peace treaty is the disarmament
proposition. However, my own .
idea is that the treaty should have
gone still further in reducing
Germany's armament. Germany
should net be allowed an army of
1 CO, COO men' and her navy is too
big." '
Senator Harding of Ohio, republican,
said that "in a general way there can
be little fault, found with the pro
visions imposed upon Germany," but
added that "the big issue raised is
that raised by our involvment in the
league of nations which is to carry out
many of the treaty provisions."
"I doubt if the senate will consent
to this country entering upon " re
sponsibilities, limitations of which we
do not know," he said. 1
The new Proprietary Stamps
which are placed on all the luxu

fiers are now on sale at the local

The nev stamps are part of the

each bottle of patent medicine

committee of the Iron and Steel insti
tute failed at a conference today to
reach an agreement for a reduction, of
the schedule of steel prices approved
by the industrial board of the depart
ment cf commerce.
According to a statement issued at
the end of a long discussion, the rail
road administration contended the
prices were not low enough, while the
manufacturers asserted a further re
duction could not be made without a
decrease in the cost of production,
which would necessitate a lowering of
wages.
Mr. Hines' announcement, was made
after he had been informed by his rep
resentatives that they had been un
able to induce representatives of the
Ipre manufacturers at a conference
here today to agree on a reduction of
the schedule of steel prices- approved
by the industrial board of the depart
ment of commerce. Mr. Hines declared
it was his settled purpose to buy steel
materials on the competitive bidding
basis as rapidl as they are needed.

CONFERENCE CALLED
OF ARIZONA SHERIFFS
ON NEW MOTOR LAWS
PHOENIX, May 8. The corporation
commission has invited all the county
attorneys and sheriffs in Arizona and
representatives from each incorporat
ed city to a conference at the capital
May 22 to work- out ways and means
of enforcing the new law regarding
motor vehicles plying for hire.
The-new law places under the con
trol of the commission every vehicle
operated for hire to carry either pas
sengers or freight. The measure will
go into effect June 18.
It was stated at the commission's
office today that operators of such
vehicles will be regarded in the light
of public service corporations and
must obtain from the commission a
certificate of convenience and neces
sity and operate under tariffs set by
the commission.
A point in the new law which may
prove temporarily embarrassing was
indicated today in the amendment to
the measure made in th ehouse, mak
ing the law go into effect June 18, and
requiring that all vehicles plying for
hire must have certificates on that
date. It was stated that applications
for such certificates could not very
well be granted until that date.

Keans,; manager of Dempsey, stateo

There has been some discussion here
as to 'whether the local commission
would approve of Matt Hinkle of

that Mayor Schrefber, who is the dic
tating member of the commission, told
Rickard when here last week his plans
would not be interfered with by the
commission.

PHOENIX, May 8. (Fy the Asso

'boot legging'- man Is peculiar;" would
be an apt paraphrase of a well known
poem on the history of the Illicit li-i
quor trade of Arizona since the state
went dry December 14, 1914.
The original "bootlegger," say those
who profess to know, carried the whis
ky with which he did unlawful trad
ing concealed in flat flasks in the
legs of his boots, hence the name. One
of those gentlemen, the first to come
under the eyes of the officers for
many months, was captured in Phoe
nix recently, but the up-to-date pur
veyor of liquor In Arizona resorted to
much more elaborate tricks to import,
or manufacture and sell his wares.

NOTED ATTORNEY
OUT WITH FACTS
HON. R. fa. DAMON FEELS IT DUTY
TO TELL PUBLIC HIS ,
EXPERIENCE
Business men, professional men,
farmers, artisans, in fact people in all
walks of life, including innumerable
women," are now taking, Tanlac, and
are testifying daily to the prepara
tions remarkable merits. This incon
trovertible evidence Is further
strengthened by the statement of R.
W. Damon, a well-known attorney at
law,- who resides at 2712 Yakima
streeti South, Tacoma, Wash. Mr. Da
mon practiced his profession in the
when federal officers arrested oneimany staunch friends throughout the
m i r, in Con Tada 1 Taw, ; n . A I . . .....
man in San Jose, California, and an
other in Phoenix, who were making a
business or shipping these trunks
back and forth. , ;
In Jerome, recently, a large and sus
picious barrel arrived by express, ac
cording to the story told by the fed
eral officials. It was heavy and the
deduction was that it , was full of
something. It was deposited on' the
station platform, but nobody came to
claim it. Officers . investigated and
found it filled with whisky, so a close
watch was set on the barrel, day and
night. There it stood for several days
till the arms -of the law became weary
of the vigil and decided to remove it
to headquarters for safe keeping.
Then came the surprise. The bar
rel that arrived full was empty and
when it was moved the mystery was
explained by a large augur hole in
the station platform immediately un
der It. Its owner knew it had been
watched, 50 without attracting any un
due attention . he.'Jiad crawled under
neath the platform, bored a ' hole
through the planks and the end of the
barrel and, drawn off the much desired
liquor. At $10 a pint, the prevailing
price, he made a good haul.
An automobile tire traveling by ex
press has been known to bring whis
ky Into the state, and recently a large
consignment of "condensed milk" was
found to have nothing acteal about it
but the label, while the interior of
the cans were decorated with "old
rye."
Suit cases earned along as personal
baggage also have furnished means to
introduce the forbidden drink into
Arizona, but alert officers have devel
oped the habit unpleasant for the
guilty of carelessly bumping into or
gently kicking suitcases and any tell
tale "tinkle" almost always is fatil.
While the ingenuity of the importer
of whisky into dry Aiizona has devis
ed many elaborate and some exceed
ingly 'clever methods of trying to out
wit the law, his brother, the "moon
shiner," has been just as original.
Illicit stills, grading ell the way
from a small gas stove, with a can
and a copper pipe, to the modern and
fully equipped article have been raid
ed and confiscated, but the most elab
orate discovered for years was un
earthed in a raid In the Verde district.
The still room was excavated at a
distance of 20 feet from a well, it's
room being about four feet below the
surface of the ground. The room was
10 feet square with walls six feet high
nd could be reached only by a tunnel
west. In relating his experience with
Tanlac recently, Mr. Damon said:
"I feel it my duty to do whatever
I can to help suffering humanity, and
J am more than glad for the sake of
others, to give this statement about
my wonderful improvement since I be
gan the use of Tanlac. 1 have suf
fered a great deal during the past two
years - from indigestion and stomach
trouble in a very severe form. My
food would not digest properly, but
would lay in my stomach and ferment,
causing gas, bloating and much pain
about my heart. At times I was so
affected by this gas that I could hard
ly breathe, and had intense pains all
through my chest. Twice, I was in
such a bad way that I fell to the floor
in an unconscious condition, and the
second attack put me in such bad
shape that I had to be carried to the
hospital, where I lay for 30 days. I
would go for two or three nights In
succession with only two or three
hour sleep, and the following day I
would feel entirely worn out. I seem
ed to receive no benefit from my food,
was inclined to be constipated and
felt unfit fo ranything. I, of course,
doctored, and took medicines of dif
ferent kinds, but got very little, if
any results.
'"While reading the Tacoma paper
one day I came across a Tanlac testi
monia, given by a Denver lady, and
her case was exactly like mine. So
since that time' I have been taking
Tanlac, and the results have far ex
ceeded my expectations. I have only
been taking it for about ten days and
have already been almost entirely re
lieved o fthe gas and bloating. My
appetite Is so enormous, and every
thing tastes so good that I have to
guard myself to keep from eatlnj
more than I should. I have gained 11
pounds in weight already, and am still
picking up. I sleep soundly every
night and get up in the mornings
rested and refreshed. So it is, Tanlac
has proven to be just the right thing
in my case and I gladly give others
the benefit of my experience with it."

IG STORE IMPORTED
OF CANADIAN WHEAT
NEW YORK. .May 8. Julius Barnes,
United State wheat director, an
: nounced tonight on his return from
Chicago that he had completed nego
tiations to bring 4,000.000 bushels or
Canadian wheat . into the United
States for distribution to the mills.
These negotiations have been in
progress for several days with the
Canadian authorities, it was said.
Director Barnes announced further
that this quantity of imported wheat
will be sufficient for those mills
which hae not provided their stocks
up to the new crop. .
Reports reaching the grain corpora
tion today indicated that, the nervous
ness and excitement heretofore ruling
in the flour market in the United
States are being gradually allayed and
that flour prices have shown a distinct
decline in the last week.
Mr. Barnes tonight reiterated that
the grain corporation will sell from
its current stocks and its current
movement through the ports, particu
larly Boston, New York, Philadelphia
and Baltimore its standard grades of
flour at 111.50 per barrel in carload
lots to bona fide users, and that the
grain corporation offices at all these
ports have been instructed to continue
to sell on this basis until the domes
tic situation is entirely relieved.

Less Daylight, Bigger Dividends
After year3 of agitation, the people of this country have-won the
fight for an "extra hour" of daylight an hour in which city people who
work in stuffy places can play outdoors, work their gardens, visit the
parks, go swimming, take picnics in their flivvers, or visit with their
neighbors before the night shades fall.
This was accomplished by the national, "daylight saving" bill, by
which the -clocks were advanced an hour in summer and put back an
hour in winter. In some sections further daylight-saving was accomp
lished by -moving the limits of the national time zones a hundred miles
or so westward, setting some cities that formerly used Central time
in the Eastern time zone, some that used Mountain time in the Central
time zone, and so on.
Now, suddenly, there has arisen throughout the nation an agitation
to set the clocks back again to abolish the hour or more of daylight
that we now have in the evening and go back to the old discarded "sun
time" that was unsatisfactory even to our grandfathers.
Why? Whence comes this cry for a return to "sun-time?". Who
is putting up the money for all this agitation? In whose interest is
the campaign being undertaken?
We have gone to some pains to find out. And we have found out.
The agitation springs from motion-picture and theatrical interests.
Particularly from the monarchs of the movie's.
They don't wont people to spend these extra daylight hcurs in the
country or in the parks on the teaches or in their gardens in God's
great out-of-doors, gathering health for the future and strength for the
morr&w, breathing fresh air and basking in the evening sunshine.
Being gocd business men and having large, commodious audi
toriums, they want the folks to come along with their money and fill the
picture houses.
Of course we all wish the moving picture theaters success, because
they are not only a fine amusement, but also an educational force. Nev
ertheless, we miss our question if the people, having tasted daylight tilt
9 o'clock, or so, will stand for earlier darkness just to keep the moving,
picture theaters rolling up bigger ' dividends in the good old summer
time.
But We
Most of us miss about all the pleasure of life because we go with
cur noses to the grindstone, and our eyes glued to the mud on our
shoes.
There is hardly a one of us who cannot in an hour's journey get
away to a park, a country road, a river bank, or a bit of wood.
And geting there to nature's laboratory where all the mystery of
creation, ail the mating and giving birth, and maternal care is mani
fest, surely there is enough to give our minds something to chew on
mere nourishing than the husks of the daily trough.
A pocket bird book will cost you one dollar and a half.
Take it and go out in the country, the country that lies at the .
end pf any car line. . . ,
In the spring afternoons or evenings pick a. quiet, shaded spot and
get acquainted with the dozens of birds about you.
Meet the thrush and the bobolink and the wren, and the fly catcher
and the meadowlark, and a score more that just now are marrying and
giving in marriage.
Or take a flower book and learn the habits and faces of the wild
gardens of the fields and woods.
Or a bug boo' and scrape acquaintance with the insect armies that
are marching in orderly array about their nations' business.
An ant city will afford edicifaction and instruction and ethical ad
vice to a philosopher for a year.
A bee hive, aye the tiny entrance to it, will give one more food
for thought than the average statesman's address.
To lay prone on the warm sod and watch the ships cf the sky sail
their wonderful voyages is a worth while thing .
Most of us know nothing at all of the worlds all about us. Our
wisdom is of the counter, the ready chewed slang wisdom of the thought
less cities, and a movie or a burlesque show gives us relaxation.
Your immortal soul deserves better fodder than that. ,
Making Your Savings Work for You
"To save is to have."
There never was a truer phrase written than this one. It tells
in five words, just exactly what thrift means.
The organizations promoting the sales of Victory Ponds are using
this phrase extensively in their advertising. They are pounding its truth
home to hundreds of thousands of people who have never heretofore
given much thought to the matter. As a result of this advertising campaign-it
is safe to say that enormous numbers of Americans are now
lying something aside from week to week who never before did any
thing of the kind.
To save is to have. To have is to be able to do things when you
want to do them, or when it becomes necessary to do them. To have
is to be safeguarded against money worries; to have is to know that
you can face the future, witli all its possibilities of lost jobs, sickness
and everything else, with the utmost confidence. '
That's where the Victory Bonds are such a great thing for hte small
inverter. These bends enable a man to put his fifty or a hundred dollars
in an absolutely secure investment and to get a good rate of interest
on his savings. There's no easier, better method on earth of, saving,
having and making what you have earn money for you than to buy
Victory Bonds.
Save and have! .
Do Doughboys Make Gocd Wives
livery suldier is a housekeeper. If he isn't handy at helping him
self all ways, he doesn't get by.
A Nebraska man called on an Ohio man in. an eastern railroad yard
filled with troop trains:
"First thing when 1 get home, I'm going to get married. I've learnt
how to wash dishes, make beds, peel potatoes, sweep floors, sew buttons,
and keep house. I'll make some girl a darned fine wife."
The war changed many a sisy into a big, strapping he-man. Speak
i lg judicially and judiciously, we shall say that doughboys make either
good wives or husbands.
When people say that a gay young man lias finally settled down,
tl:fy mean that he is finally making an effort to settle up.
Daughter is willing to lovo her lieutenant while he is connected with
the army, bu she isn't willing to marry him until he connects with a
permanent job.
Hun delegates to the peace congress at Versailles will have full
power to sign a treaty and the league will have full power to make the
signatures worth something.
A Chicago woman shot her husband, who was testifying in a divorce
case. Why don't the Chicago courts provide witnesses with knives?
guns are so noisy.

late this afternoon by Clarence A.
Earl, vice president of the company,
following a clash between strikers

The trouble resulted when several
hundred strikers attempted to talk
with employes who had refused to
join their ranks.
Nearly 100 policemen were rushed
to the plant when a citizen reported
a disturbance. Headquarters was no
tified that crowds were gathering in
the streets and menacing the police
already there and non-strikers.
It was announced later by Henry F.
,Hobart, chief of police, that none or
his men were injured. All traffic po
licemen were taken from the- streets
and ordered to report at the plant.
.I'nion officials declare ten thousand
men are on strike.

A SURE WAY TO CUT

"It has been quite an expense to
keep my boy in shoes because he is
very hard on them. But since wearine
rhoes with NeOlin Soles his shoe bill
Iras been reduced 66," says J.
Allison Allen of Amity, Arkansas. '
On the importance of Neolin Soles
ns a money saving factor there are
thoiwands of parents who agree with
Mr. Allen. Decaue Neolin boles give
extra wear where most shoes war out
quickest, they1 cut your shoe bills down.
Ask for Neoliii-soled shoes when
next new shoes are needed, either for
yourself or for your children. You can
get them at any good shoe store. And
; take your worn ttioes to the repair shop
(and have them re-bottomed with
Neolin Soles.

by Science to be waterproof and com

LONDON", May 8. According to
speakers at a recent meeting of the j

scientific term" for which "shell shy"
might better be used.
Sir J. Purves Stewart, senior physi
ian of Westminster hospital, said it
really , was "molecular abnormality ot
the nervous system characterized by ,
abnormal reactions to ordinary
stimuli." ,
Lr. V. W. Mott said the war had
produced no new nervous disease, and
that tho varied hysterical manifesta

were emotional disorders and were

Judging from the countless prepara
tion and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed in modern foods. Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic nhos-
phate known among druggists as bitro-.
phosphate, which is inexpensive an ft
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
most all druggists under a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and , by
supplying the body cells with the
necessary phosphoric food elements,
bltro-phosphate quickly produces a
welcome transformation in the appear
ance; the increase in weight frequent
ly being astonishing.
This increase In weight also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness
and lack of energy, which nearly al
ways accompany excessive thinness,
soon disappear, dull eyes become
bright, and pale cheeks glow with the
bloom of perfect health.
CAUTION: Although bltro-phos-
phate is unsurpassed for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen
eral weakness, it should not, owing
to its remarkable flesh-growing prop
erties, be used by anyone who doe
not desire to put on flesh, Adv.

concerning itself with Lord Wood
stock's winning of the Derby with his

the ring to take the place of an "un
known" pugilist whom he had backed
heavily and who had been drugged
through the agency of Olive de Car
teret, the vamp, at the Inspiration of
her husband, who is Lord Woodstocks ;
deadly enemy. The story has to do '
with the attempt of de Carteret to ruin !
Lord Woodstock.
The romantic element is provided
by. the Earl, who is in love with the !
daughter of his chief trainer. Her
sister loves Joe Lee, a prize fighter,
not wisely but too well, and when she
attempts suicide, her father oh learn
ing the truth, becomes the willing
tool of Mrs. de Carteret in doping Lee
just as he i sto step into the ring.
Lord Woodstock takes his place anu
not only wins the fight but thousands
of pounds as well.
The production is a notable one
from every angle, while the support la
exceptionally good. The principals in
the cast are Ralph Graves, Warner

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 8. Petroleum
shares dominated today's trading to a
greater extent than at any time in the
history of the stock exchange, their
movements assuming extravagant pro
portions and causing consequent mis
givings in conservative circles.
Almost as a whole, however, the
market was strong. The further rise
lifted average prie'e of leading indus-
trials to maximums for almost three
years, while rails a3 a group were at
the year's best.

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 8. Sharp bulges
took place at the outset and finished
in the corn markets today, but during
the rest of the time prices were weak.
Wet weather and scantiness of re
ceipts were the chief strengthening
principally in the secbacks in the
value or nogs. The close was strong
at the same as yesterday's finish to
2c higher, with July $1.65 to $1.66
and September $1.58 to $1.59. Oats
gained c to lc. In provisions the
outcome was unchanged to 60c down.
Although planting delay due to con
tinued rains and to low temperatures
gave the corn market an upward slant
to start with, heavy selling quickly de
veloped and there was general focus
sing of attention on the fact that ar
rivals of hogs here today were more
than twice as numerous as had been
looked for. Liquidation on a large
scale together with speculative bear
ish pressure kept the corn market
weak thereafter until midday, when
rallies set in.
Improved cash demand did a good
deal to lift oats.
Provisions were governed mainlv
by the declines in the hog market.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY, MAY 9, 1919
BEWARE FRAUDULENT
'PANHANDLERS' USING
UNIFORM, IS WARNING
In a letter from Arthur Woods, form
or police commissioner of New Tor
city, but now assistant to the secre
tary of war. Chief Kempton of the lo
cal police force is warned of the pan
handling being performed by supposed
discharged service men in uniform,
most of whom, he declares, are frauds.
Mr. Wood's letter says in part:
"Although the demobilization of our
army and navy has not progressed
far, the supposedly discharged soldier,
sailor and marine in uniform peddling
In our streets i3 a problem to engage
our most serious attention.
"You know as well as I how grateful
the country is to those who have
served it . in the military and naval
forces, and how certain it is that no
discharged man has to resort to pan
handling for a living. You know as
well as I that the 'cooties' who send
them out to do this scrt of thing are
doing it simply to play upon the pub
lic sympathy which the uniform
arouses and will continue to arouse
for a long time to come. The men
sleeping in Flanders fields and in me
Argonne, and on the hills around Cha
teau Thierry, who can never come
back, and the great majority of their
pals who are returning to civil life,
have made that uniform as sacred as
the flag itself; and the police forces of
the United States could do no finer
thing than to protect it.
"It will be interesting and gratify
ing to you to know that 80 per cent
of the men coming out of the army
and the navy go straight from the de
mobilization camps to their homes.
This leaves only 20 per cent to linger
around centers of demobilization and
in the larger cities. A few of these
may be panhandling, but I am inclined
to think that iiiany, if not most, of the
men in uniform that are peddling in
the streets never entered the service,
and are pure frauds."
The assistant to the secretary of
war then goes on to call the attention
to the importance of the police forces,
especially in larger centers, to famil
iarize themselves with the location of
the U. 3. employment service bureaus
for returning soldiers and sailors, so
that If a discharged man comes to
their attention they can put him in
direct touch with those agencies.
In the large eastern cities the num
ber of men that are panhandling and
dabbing in fake schemes has grown
to large proportions and it has had a
tendency to arouse the wrath of the
soldiers, who do not approve of their
tactics in. making money by working
on the sympathies of the public
through the uniform and the service
stripe. In Kansas City, Chicago, St.
Louis and New York city, in fact all
the large cities and in some instances
in the farming sections men in uni
form have been dragged into a huge
net thrown out by faking get-rich-quick
schemers and witl: the unwit
ting aid of a patriotic public their
schemes have been huge successes un
til the government took steps to pro
tect the sacredness of the uniform
and voice the disapproval of the Yan
kee doughboy. I
According to', C.hief of Police Kemp-,
ton no panhandling has" been dope in I
the streets of Bisbee and none will -be
permitted if the department gets any
knowledge of it going on.

BISBEE HAS BUT TWO
DAYS LEFT IN WHICH
TO RAISELOAN QUOTA
Although the country in general
yesterday took a brace in the Vic
tory Loan campaign and regard
less of the fact that many bonds
were sold in Bisbee during the
last two days, Eisbee continues
to lag behind with its quota. The
number of bonds sold during the
last two days in the Warren Dis
trict have been in a way reassur
ing, but the amounts subscribed
have been small as a general rule
and the tcta! subscribed does not
meet with .the expectation of
County Chairman Gaines.
With only three more days to
go over the top the loan is still
trailing below the $400,000 mark
in this section. With Bisbee's
quota set at $800,000 it is pointed
out, something like a miracle
must happen if the quota is sub-
scribed when the guns cease fir
ing at midnight next Saturday.
From eastern cities, especially
the financial center, New York
City, everybody seems to have put
their shoulders to the task and
patriotic men and women are com
ing to the rescue in the last hours
of the big drive. That the loan
will not be a faiure is practically
assured. That Bisbee will not
reach her quota unless the present
pace is quickened in the last two
days is also assured, according to
the llocal loan organization.
If B.sbee fails in this loan it
will be the first war loan in which
she has not oversubscribed her
. quota, and a splendid record in all
other branches of war activity as
well will be sullied, it wa s point
ed out yesterday in calling atten
tion to the seriousness of the
situation.

TWO SPEAKERS TELL
OF WAR EXPERIENCES
AT LUNCHEON CLUB
The Warren District Luncheon club,
which held its regular weekly lunch
ecn in the dining room o fthe Copper
Queen hotel yesterday afternoon, had
the opportunity of hearing two veter
ans of the great war relate their ex
periences on fche field of buttle. Dr.
Robert Ferguson of this city and Capt.
A. C. Taylor of the 15Sth infantrr
were the club's guests. About fifty
members were present.
Dr. Ferguson, the first speaker,
told cf his experience in France while
serving with a medical detachment.
The doctor paid a tribute to England
and the British Tommy and he tola
his audience that the treatment the
Yankee received at the hands qf the
Englishman ,was of the highest cali
ber. In the' opinion of Dr. Fergu-J
son the criticism heard in some parts
of the country against the financial
activities of Borne of the Y. W..C .A.
hute at the front was unjust.
The doctor pointed out that the Y.
W. C. A. had accomplished a great
work, but that they had launched
into the war with plans that were too
gigantic for the emergency and con
sequently in some instances it did
not work out correctly and thereby
had won the disapproval of some peo-j
pie who did not stop to look into the
good work the organization has done.
Captain Taylor related the charac
teristics of the Yankee doughboy, his
