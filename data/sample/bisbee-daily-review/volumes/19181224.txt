LONDON, Dec. 23. "The Belgian
suite," reserved exclusively for royal
guests until now, will be occupied by
President and Mrs. Wilson during
their stay in Lcndon. In the years of
its interesting history it has had
within Its walls many crowned heads,
one of the latest, but at least men
tioned at Buckingham palace, being
the former German emperor. It was
'given its name during Queen Vic
toria's reign and was always known
as the House of the king of the Bel
gians, when royalty was entertained
here.
At the request of President Wilson,
who evidently found Uiat too much
is being crowded into his. short stay
in England, the proposed dinner at
Lancaster house on Saturday night
has been eliminated. This was to have
been' a function only second to the
banquet at Buckingham palace Fri
day night. Instead of the Lancaster
house banquet. Premier Lloyd George
will entertain the president at dinner
Saturday, to meet the war cabinet.
Those in charge of the details of
the arrangements, particularly the of
ficials at Buckingham palace, are at
times puzzled over the niceties ol
etiquette, the result of the unique sit
uation that there will be no royal
guests at the palace. Thes' puzzles,
however, have been only of momen
tary 'duration, except among some of
the aged attendants, who have been
casting about for guidance. It is un derstood
that they have been in-J
formed that it will be plain ' Mr. Wil-j
son" and "Mrs. Wilson," much to their ;
relief.

NEW YORK, Dec. 23. Asserting
that President Wilson had sailed for
Europe "in eager pursuit" of Uie en
tangling alliances against which
Washington warned the nation. Col
onel George Harvey denounced the
league of nations plan, in an address
tonight at the 113th annual dinner of
the New England society of the City
of New York.
"Would we not better still the fer
ment in Mexico and Peru and Chile
and San Domingo and Costa Rica?"
Colonel Harvey demanded, "before at
tempting to foist everlasting peace
upon the Balkans? Have we no vital
problems within our own borders cry
ing for solution?"
Recalling "a precisely similar alli
ance that came into existance in 1S43,"
Colonel Harvey quoted Daniel Web
ster's speech in which he opposed the
preservation of peace, "by bringing
the power of all governments to bear
upon all subjects."
"Have times so changed," he asked,
"that we owe lt to humanity to toss
our cherished republic into a melting
pot to be mashed into a pulp of in
ternational socialism?"
Colonel Harvey also opposed the
program of "no indemnities" for the
United Slates, asserting that for the
1'i.ited States to rfrain collecting
the nearly Jt.IO.OOO.oooooo the war cost,
would be tantamount to a "voluntary
contribution to the war fund of Germany."

editor of the American Socialist, who
with four ethers .is on tria before
Judge Lnndis chargw't with violating

never printed a line in the paper
which might have aided the govern

He did not deny having printed
pages of editorials, statements,
speeches and interviews against the
war and the selective draft.
Assistant District Attorney Fleming
read extracts from numerous alleged
anti-war articles from the files of the
paper. One was signed by Victor L.
Berger, another defendant, and en
titled: "If This Be Treason, Make
the Most Of It." .
Another article offered in evidence
was entitled: "The Navy Gives. Re

window service flag3 for homes of
men in the military service of the
United States had been issued. It con
cluded with jthe inquiry: "How much
longer will women continue to swap
their husbands and sons for a gaudy
piece of cardboard?"
Assistant District Attorney Fleming
referred to sections of the St. Louis
socialist convention anti-war platform,
cartoons on the horrors of war and
certain pamphlets wh;ch had been
printed in the American Socialist and
asked: "Do you think that the pub
lication of these things in your paper
after this country had entered the war
was calculated to help the government
in successfully prosecuting the war?"
The government attorney asked the
witness to answer the question y-s or
no, but was unable to get a direct
response.

of today's action is to place Germans
and Austrians on the same footing.
Approximately 250,000 Germans
would be relieved from the necessity
of carrying permits for entry into re
stricted areas, while the prohibited
areas from which they were excluded
absolutely would again be open to

Assistant Secretary of War

Council Did Much to Win

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 23. Edward R.
Stettinius, second assistant secretary
of war, an American member of the
inter-allied munitions council formed
for unifying allied shipments or war
supplies and artillery to save ship
tonnage, returned today on the steam
ship Cedric. Mr. Stettinius, who was
fnrmorlv a nnrtnpr in the firm of J. P.
Moran & Co has been abroad since
July and will return to Europe about
January 15, after making a report to
the war department.
The unification plan, Mr. Stettinius
said, was very efficient and success
ful, adding that if it had been devised
sooner much time and money would
have been saved the allied govern
ments. Much of the material, he said,
was shipped "knocked down" to Ens
land and France and assembled when
' it arrived on the other side.
Regarding reconstruction work in
France, he expressed the belief that
the French would do a great deal more
for themselves than most outsiders
supposed possible. While the devosta-

Would Take Profit
"I would take every dollar of war
profit." the Wisconsin senator said,
"'leaving business its enormous pre
war profits and its capital untouched.
"I would take all of the income over
enough to enable the owner of the in
come to support his family in com
fort." Even under his bill. Senator LaFol
lette said, war profits earned by cor
porations in prosperous past 'years
would go untouched.
Increased Income Tax
Regarding his plan to increase in
come taxes on the wealthy. Senator
LaFollette said:
"Whatever may have been the
forces which caused the world war,
one result of it must be apparent to
every man of intelligence and that is
what the plain citizen has come to
realize his power as never before anu
consequently will assert his rights as
never before. In order to raise the
money to pay the expenses we have
incurred, and are bound to incur, the
government must reach out and put a
heavy hand through its power of taxa
tion upon every citizen in the land,
and if it be presently discovered that
the hand of the government bears
heavily and unjustly upon the masses
and touches only lightly the rich in
proportion to their ability to pay it
will produce conditions of discontent
and resentment not pleasant to con
template." Declaring that the country's expen-'
ditures would be ten or twelve billion
dollars for the next five years. Sen
ator LaFollette said with the present
bill in operation with would necessi
tate 25 or 30 billions additional in
bonds. This, he said, would be "truly
an appalling situation."
Senator LaKoUette insisted that the
American armies would not be demo
bilized for many months and that
their maintenance would require huge
sums.
Senator Smith of Georgia suggested
that under the draft law, the service
of men called to the color's must end
fcur months after, peace is declared.
Senator LaFollette replied that con-;
gress "is so subservient" that if thej
administration should use American I
forces abroad against nations with !
war has not been declared congress
would vote money for such military
operations.
" No Board Medals
The senate rejected an amendment
by Senator Pollock of South Carolina,
extending the thanks of congress to
the members of the district and local
draft boards and authorizing the sec-
retary of war to present them with
bronze medals.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY OP
OCCUPATION. Sunday. Dec. 22. (By
the Associated Press.) The feeling
anions the merchants of Coblenz is
that it is unsafe to risk investments
until Germany's future is assured. The
merchants say they have much to lose
and little to gain by venturing upon
new enterprises while Germany is iso
lated from the remainder of the world
and still is unsettled as to the labor
supply and industrial legislation.
While the Americans have done con
siderable Christmas shopping in Cob
lenz, among the Coblenz bankers busi
ness is considered dull and money
easy. Dealers in most lines have sold
virtually all their stocks and the mon
ey is now idle. The chief of the Cob
lenz bankers' association estimates
that prior to the signing of the anna
tire business activity was about 60
per cent of its peace time volume but
since has dropped until it is now
about 45 per cent. No improvement
in business is expected until after the
national constitutional assembly.
The dullness in business has its
natural counterpart in wages, and
complaints are heard that hours are
long and wages low. The merchants
of Mayen estimate that eight marks
per day is a fair living wage which
will permit of the support of a family.
But in the vicinity of Mayen stone
quarry laborers receive five marks
daily and men factory workers the
same amount. The pay for women em
ployes in factories is less.
In Coblenz the wage is higher but

Readjustment for
Reconstruction
DURING .the great war now closed except as to diplomatic de
tails, the telephone was privileged to play a conspicuous
part. That it served so capably and well is due in large
measure to the patriotic co-operation of the public.
Now post-war conditions are beginning- to influence thoc
and action. The reconstruction period is at hand. Industries re
tarded by the necessities of war will begin to expand. The energies
and capital directed toward the winning of the war will be diverted
to the channels of peaceful pursuits.
Reconstruction will involve the readjustment of plans and pol
icies. It will require no less aggressive thought and energy and
action in the business of building for peace than it did in the prepa
ration for and the waging of war.
In the readjustment of business and the reconstruction of in
dustry the telephone v.ill again be an important factor. It will
serve as the line of communication between the general headquar
ters of thought and the front lines of action.
The demands upon the telephone will be tremendous; but the
intelligent, considerate use of the telephone will multiply achieve
ment. May we hope for a continuance of the helpful co-operatioa
which the public has shown us in the past, that the very best results
may be obtained from our efforts to serve you satisfactorily.

The Silent Seven
Not for many years will the final posi
tions in the hall of fame be agreed upon for
the men who fought in the great war. But
even now many of these men stand out
above the forest of bayonets and the pall of
smoke and the gleam of fire as makers of
history. Of course, we all know more or
less about the parts played by the French
generals, for the French armies, bore the
brunt the first two years of the conflict.
And then, too, the French are not backward
about setting forth the exploits of their
heroes. But of the English leaders little
has been said. The English custom is to
say nothing and saw wood. The other day
this column saw a picture of a group of
seven British generals who carried Britain's
hopes and fears through the dark and on to
the dawn. And, somehow, the picture sug
gests a little story of the part these seven
silent men played in the breaking of the
Hun.
Of Haig, the commander in chief of Brit
ish armies in France, every one knows. He
succeeded General French, right after the
disastrous offensive at Loos, early in the
second year of the war. And he never
faltered under the tremendous strain. Of
the cold, resolute, thorough Wellington
type, he never lost the confidence of his
country-men or their allies in all the dark
days of the war. And he was a better and
more skillful commander in the last cam
paign than at any time. He wore well. He
had to make his armies out of raw material,
too, as he went along. Haig will rank with
Britain's greatest generals of all time. This
picture shows him with his strong, set
Scotch face as the familiar type of British
military leader from time immemorial.
The next face in the group to catch and
hold attention is that of General Plumer,
hero cf the Flanders forces. He is a type
of the Englishman of old days, heavy
features, massive jaw, bulldog through and
through. He held the Ypres line against
all comers and never blenched when his
men fell by the thousand under the fumes
of the first terrible gas attacks of the Hun.
It was Plumer who took Messines Ridge
in one of the most brilliant offensives of
the war. After the Italian disaster he was
sent to Italy in command of allied reserves
that stemmed the Austrian tide on the
Piave. He was recalled and placed in
charge of the Passchendale offensive after
General Gough had mussed it all up. Then
when the tide finally turned this year, it
was Plumer who led the British and Bel
gian forces in that drive that broke the
Hunnish defensive in the north and re
covered the Belgian seacoast and Lille.
General Home is of exactly the same
ancient, heavy British type as Plumer. He
commanded an army in the first Somme of
fensive and later was driven back clear to
Givenchy vhen the Prusisans started for
Paris early in this year. But he held at
this vital point and it was Home who com
manded that greatest of all British drives
which broke the Queant switchline and
made possible the taking of Cambrai and
the taking of the Hindenburg line.
General Allenby, the hero of Jerusalem,
looks more like a British polo player than a
British general. His conquest of Samaria
and destruction of the Turkish forces in
that region will rank with the most brilliant
achievement of all time. His victories
came at a time when they helped his coun
trymen the most and hurt his enemies the
most in the great struggle on the western
front. He put Turkey out of the war and
restored the Holy City to Christendom.
Allenby 's fame will be deathless.
General Maude, the man who retrieved
the disaster of Kut-el-Amara, and died just
before his victorious troops took Bagdad, is
Scotch of the Scotch, according to his pic
ture. England will always hold him very
high, because of his success in colonial war
fare. I Ic organized and led the tribesmen
under the British flag and performed his
miracles with but a small part of British
leaven in his forces.
General Rawlinson, is also Scotch in
name and Scotch in face, and Robert Bruce
himself was not a greater fighter than this
hero of the great war. He had his ups and
down, did Rawlinson, his immortal Seventh
division losing ten thousand of its total
force of twelve thousand men, in the first
Ypres campaign. And he was beaten at
Loos and he gained but little credit at Pas
schendale, but he fought on, brave and tire
less and never lost Haig's confidence. In
the end he justified this high faith for it
was he who led the allied forces at. the de
cisive battle of Cambrai, at which the Hin
denburg line was broken beyond repair.
Last, but not least, on this list comes
General Byng, who had such dazzling
good fortune in the first Cambrai drive,
and then had to give up his gains for lack
of support. Byng is the typical British
soldier of these latter days. His face is dis
tinctive of the popular type. Rather large
nose, mild, wide open eyes, little bristly
moustache, slightly jutting jaw, clean cut
in contour, youthful expression. Yes,
Byng could pose for the British officer, as
the modern world conceives him to be and
as Kipling drew him in his great short
stories. ' It was Byng who first smashed
trench lines with tanks and thus revolution
ized warfare on the western front. Byng
held Arras and Vimy Ridge last spring,
when the German wave threatened to en
gulf everything in France. Byng took Ba
paume in August and paved the way for
a second Cambrai. In comparison with
the old bulldogs of the British army, this
bullterrier of the younger set, does not suf
fer. The man of Waterloo, the man of the
Crimea and of Spion Kopje, is the man of
Cambrai. Always the same fighting, stay
ing, winning Britisher.
And so endeth the tale of these silent
seven British generals, servants of a silent
British government of a silent British peo
ple. Brief, concise, cold reports of actual
transactions in hand to hand battle were
all that came from British sources to tell of
the exploits and achievements of the Brit
ish soldier and officer throughout the war.
l"he British navy did so much all alone that
silence regarding its giant part could not
avail to hide it from the world. But the
British army in the last two years of the
war played as great a part as any in .the
breakage of the Prussian power. Be sure of
it, that the ultimate historical record will
show the parts of these seven generals and
their men in the great war, to rank even
with that of the great and gallant French
men, whose records all men know this day.
OF INTEREST TO TURKEY
(Kansas City Star.)
As Turkey understands the situation, ac
cording to Ward Price, a newspaper corre
spondent at Constantinople, that country
did not sign the armistice a3 a beaten na
tion, but as a sort of gentlemen's agreement
between the nations of the world.
Indeed, according to Mr. Price, the party
in power in Turkey, is very greatly in
censed over the administration of the terms
of the armistice by the allies, and it has
just voted, very grudgingly, to maintain
the present relations, in order to "tide over
the critical situation."
That being the case, Turkey has a sur
prise coming to her in the way of interest
ing and authentic information. Turkey is
about to hear some news. The terrible
Turk will get the word direct, within a few
weeks, which i3 certain to shock his soul.
He is to hear that he must get to work and
pay the world an honest debt.
Turkey will be kept so busy during the
next few years at the useful occupation
paying the fine which the police court of
civilization will assess against it, that it will
have little time to follow its old pastime
and national sport of murdering defense
less men and women and children.
The "sick man of Europe" is about to
be given a dose of medicine intended to
cure it of the chronic cussedness which has
kept the diplomatic doctors and nurses of
the Old World in attendance during the
the past quarter of a century. It Will be so
tired of its job paying for its last big drunk
that it will go home on Saturday night here
after and go to bed, instead of the usual
weekly performance of going on a tear and
shooting up the peace of Europe.
Here's to the strength of the arm that
administers the dose, and here's to the
strength of the dose to' be administered.
And here's a tip to the corner druggist who
fills the prescription: Never mind the fine
measurements to go into the bottle. A
few ounces more or less of the wrong stuff
will not be resented Ly a wc-rld that is
weary of the Turk.

raised at the little town of Shubuta,
where the affair took place, and says
he has many times jumped from the
same bridge from which the men
were hanged, only he was "in swim
ming" and did uot have a rope around
his neck. Dr. E. L. Johnston, the
man whom the lynched ones were
alleged to have slain, was a boyhood
friend of Mr. Wimberly and the ar

information he hadi received about
the death of the doctor, who was a

bullet striking Duffy In the right lung.
Duffy plunged through the glass door

Somerton: Cotton at 30 cents
caused quite a flurry in Somerton and
a number of governors who had been
waiting for a 30-cent market were
anxious to turn their bales into mon
ey. So intense was the excitement
that men with cotton samples could be
seen negotiating with buyers and
showing staple samples on the streets.
One buyer bought and sampled 400
bales on Friday. The gins are all do

from the council at Washington urg
ing that every measure be taken to
protect the soldier home for the
Christmas holidays, on furlough or
discharge, from vice of every descrip

of the council of national defense,
since the soldier just released from
the routine of drii',3 and camp work
would naturally feel a reaction. The
selling and giving of liquor to the man
in uniform, whether discharged or not,
was especially warned against in the
message, and police officers and otn

more than usually vigilant at this
time.

Ered H. Eerry, who, since last July,

yesterday owing to a derailment of

east of Bowie. Two employes of the

passengers were. Those injured were
a baggageman and a valuation agent.
whose names have not yet been re
ceived at the division offices. The
derailment was probably due to a
turned rail, but the cause has not been
definitely ascertained. The baggage
car overturned. The train was going
at a speed from 30 to 3G miles an
hour when the accident occurred,
which was about 5 o'clock Sunday aft
ernoon. Owing to the non-arrival of
No. 1, a stub was run out of Tucson
Sunday evening. A shoofly is being

effort is being made to clear the
track.

selling it to defendant's clients. Com
plainant asserts that defendant's ad
mitted course of conduct in this re
gard both violates complainant's prop
erty right in the news and constitutes
unfair competition in business, and
notwithstanding the case has proceed
ed only to the stage of a preliminary
injunction, we have deemed It proper
to consder the underlying questions,
since they go to the very merits of
the action and are presented upon
facts that are not in dispute, as pre
sented in argument, these questions
are: 1 Whether theie is any prop

property in news collected for the pur
pose of being published, it survives
the instant of its publication in the
first newspaper to which It is com
municated by the news gatherer; and,
3 Whether defendant's admitted
can require. I think that within the
limits recognized by the decision of
the court, the defendant should be
enjoined from publishing news ob
tained from the Associated Press for
hours after publication by the plaintiff
unless it gives express credit to the
Associated PresB; the number of hours

fair competition in trade.
"The federal jurisdiction was in
voked because of diversity of citizen
ship, not upon the ground that the
suit arose under the ' copyright or
other laws of the United States
The associate opinion of Justice
Holmes in which Justice McKenna
concurred, follows in part:
"Fresh news is got only by enter
prise and expense. To produce such
news, as it is produced by defendant,
represents by implication that it has
been acquired by the defendant's en
terprise and at its expense. When it
comes from one of the great news col
lecting agencies like the Associated
Press, the source generally is indi
cated, plainly importing that credit;
and that such a representation is Im
plied may be inferred with some con
ference with the unwillingness of the
defendant to give the credit and tell
the truth. If the plaintiff produces
the news at the same time that the
defendant does, the defendant's pre
sentation impliedly denies to the plain
tiff the credit of collecting the facts
and assumes that credit to the de
fendant. If the plaintiff is later in
weStern cities, it naturally will be
supposed to have obtained its infor-
ant's by-laws each member agrees
upon assuming membership that news
received through complainant's serv
ice is received exclusively for publica
tion in a particular newspaper, ihat
no other use of it shall be permitted,
and that no member shall furnish or
permit any one in his employ or con
nected with his newspaper to turnish
any of complainant's news in advance
of publication to any person not a
member. And each member is re
quired to gather the local news of his
district and supply it to the Associat
ed Press and to no one else.
"Defendant is a corporation organ
ized under the laws of the state of
New Jersey, whose business is the
gathering and selling of news to its
customers and clients, consisting of
newspapers published throughout the
United States, under contracts by
which they pay certain amounts at
.uated times for defendant s service. i
It has widespread news-gathering i
agencies; the cost of its operation
amounts, it is said, to more than
12.000,000 per annum, and it serves
about 400 newspapers located in the I
various cities of the United States
and abroad, a few of which are repre
sented, also, in the membership of
the Associated Press.
"The bill was filed to restrain the
pirating of complainant's news by de-
enaaui in tnree ways: tirst. Dy . mation from the defendant. The false
bribing employes of newspapers pub- hood is a Uttie niore subtle, the in
hshed by complainant's inenfuers toilirv a u,, more indirect, than in
furnish Associated Pi ess news to de
fendant before publication, for trans
mission by telegraph and telephone
to defendant's clients for publication
by them; second, by inducing Asso
ciated Press members to violate its
by-laws and permit defendant to ob
tain news before publication; and,
third, hy copying news from bulletin
boards and from early editions of
complainant's newspapers and selli-jm
this either bodily or after rewriting
it, to defendant's customers.
"The only matter that has been
ordinary cases of unfair trade, but I
think thut the principle that con
demns the one condemns the other.
It ia a question of how strong an in
fusion of fraud is necessary to turn
a flavor into a position. The dose
seems to me strong enough here to
need a remedy from the law. But as,
in my view, the only ground of com
plaint that con be recognized without
legislation is the implied misstate
ment, it can be corrected by stating
the truth; and a suitable acknowledge

Chairman of Lloyds' Bank
Says There Will Be In
creased Demand for Credit
by Business
(P.y Review I-e.-isort Wire)
LOXDON". Dec. 23. There will be
an increased demand for credit facili
ties during the reconstruction period
and the ability of trade and industry
generally to provide for its financial
needs will depend largely ou the
amount of reserves it -has been able
to accumulate, says the report of the
committee on the provision of finan
cial facilities for trade after the vtr,
issued today by the chairman. Sir
Robert Yasser-Smith, chairman of
Lloyds bank.
To achieve the reconstruction of
trade and industry on a sound finan
cial and economic lines the report con
tinues, it will be necessary to re
establish a sound financial basis by
means of an effective gold standard to
check any undue expansion of credit
and to take steps to reduce the infla
tion of credit to more normal propor
tions. The banks will be in a posi
tion to meet demauds for ordinary
banking facilities.
Commenting on the expansion of
credit and paper currency the commit
tee says that, whereas the total depos
its at the banks of the United King
dom, exclusive of the Bank of Eng
land, at the end of 1913 amounted to
1.070.000.000 pounds sterling, the
amount of deposits now is nearly
2,000,000.000 pounds sterling.
The committee is of the opinion that
it would be of great assistance to
manufacturers if a proportion of the
excess profits tax should be retained
fcr a period as a loan upon terms like
ly to secure an early repayment.
With reference to the above state
ment a special committee of the Lon
don chamber of commerce dealing
with trade during and after the war
considers the necessity for imperial
.preference stronger today than ever.
It recommends that the government
be urged to guarantee for a series. of I
years continuance, by subsidy or oth-1
erwise of the new or "key" industries.
It recommends also that the peace
terms should compel Germany to
make the fullest restitution for
allied tonnage and cargfoes sunk
enemy action, such reparation to
made in ships, Westphalian coal
money. The committee would compel
Germany to furnish France with coal
until the deliberately wrecked French
mines are re-established, and to com
pensate the relatives of all seamen
and passengers murdered at sea.

LONDON, Dec. 23. (British wireless
seivice.) Leon Trotzky, Russian bol
hhevist minister of war, and marine,
has made a statement regarding the
recent efforts of Count Czernin, form
er Austro-Hur.garian minister of for
eign atf:iirs, to excuse himself for the
part he played in the negotiation of
the Brest-Litovsk treaty.
"Count Czernin," says Trotzky, "in
sists now very strongly upon a differ
ence between the policy of Dr. Rich
dar von Kuiilmann, former German
foreign secretary, and his own. We
have actually noticed between them
some difference, but this difference
was due simply to the fact that von
Kuehlmann commanded and Czernin
obeyed. It would be more correct
to say that General Hoffman (one of
the German delegates to Brest
Litovsk) gave orders to von Kuehl
mann and that von Kuehlmann con
veyed them to Czernin.
"Czernin now discloses that it was
his conviction that it was necessary
for Poland, Lithuania and Courland
should themselves determine their fu
ture government. In the Brest-Litovsk
negotiations, Czernin did not in any
way display this conviction.
"When General Hoffman wanted to
express in especially cynical form con
tempt of the advocates of the right of
the self determination of peoples, von
Kuehlmann charged Czernin with this
task and Czernin carried it out."

GAS
AD
COINS
FAIL TO MINGLE
(Correspondence Associated Press)
PARIS. Nov. 20. Gassed money
has made its way to Paris to be spent
since the small townspeople refused
to take it in trade. A Young Men's
Christian association secretary in a
Tillage protested when an aged wom
an storekeeper refused the jet black
coins he offered, briefly explaining,
"No good."
"But," insisted the Red Triangle
man. "Those coins are perfectly goefJ.
They were new and shiny when I
put them in my pocket, I have been
through a gas attack and the fumes
have turned them black. See "
And he took his knife and scraped
until the bright metal was revealed.
"Non," replied madame, still un
convinced. "Ce n' est pas bon." And
she went on to explain that after a
coin had been gassed, she did not
want to have anything to do with it.
Finally the man who had made the
purchase was obliged to borrow
enough from a fellow-worker to pay
for what he had bought.
"It is bad enough to go through the
danger and discomfort of a gas at
tack without having perfectly good
money ruined," mused the Y. M. C. A.
man. "This matter ought to be held
against the Bodies when the final
settlement comes. It is the worst of
all their crimes."

SPANISH INFLUENZA--WHAT IT IS
AND HOW IT SHOULD BE TREATED

NO OCCASION FOR PANIC
Spanish influenza, which appeared
in Spain in May, has all the appear
ance of grip or la grippe, which has
swept over the world in numerous
epidemics as far back as history runs.
Hippocrates refers to an epidemic in
412 B. C, which is regarded by many
to have been influenza. Every century
has had its attacks. Beginning with
1S31, this country has had five epi
demics, the last in 1S8990.
There is no leason for panic in
fluenza itself has a very low percent
age of fatalities not 'over one death
out of every four hundred cases, ae
cowling to the X. C. Board of Health.
The chief danger lies in complications
arising, attacking principally patients
in a run down condition those who
don't go to bed soon enough, or those
who get up too early.
THE SYMPTOMS
Grip, or influenza, as it is now call
ed, usually begins with a chill, fol
lowed by aching, feverishness and
sometimes nausea ond dizziness, and a
general feeling of weakness and de
pression. The temperature is from
100 to 104. and the fever usually lasts
from three to five days. The germs at
tack the mucous membrane, or lining
of the air passages nose, throat and
bronchial tubes there is usually a
hard cough, especially bad at night,
often times a sore throat or tonsilitis.
and frequently all the appearances of
a severe head cold.
THE TREATMENT
Go to bed at the first symptoms, not
heart affections.
s very important
that the patient remain in bed until
his strength returns stay in bed at
least two days or more after the fever
has left you, or if you are over 50 or
not strong, stay in bed four days or
more, according to the severity of the
attack.
EXTERNAL APPLICATIONS
In order to stimulate the lining of
the air passages to throw off the
grip germs, to aid in loosening the
phlegm and keeping the air passages
open, thus making the breathing eas
ier. Vick's VapoRub will be found ef
fective. Hot, wet towels should be
applied over the throat, chest and
back between the shoulder blades to
open the pores. Then VapoRub should
be rubbed in over the parts until the
skin is red, spread on thickly and
covered with two thicknesses of hot
flannel cloths. Leave the elothtn
loose around the neck as the heat ot
the body liberates the ingredients in
the form of vapors. These vapors,
inhaled with each breath, carry the
medication directly to the parts affect
ed. At the same time, VapoRub is ab
sorbed through and stimulates the
skin, attracting the blood to the sur
face, and thus aids in relieving the
congestion within.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.
Above all, keep fre from colds, as
colds irritate the lining of the air pas
sages and render them much better
breeding places for the. germs Use
Vicks VapoRub at the very first tiro
of a cold. For a head cold, melt a lit
tle VapoRub In a spoon and Inhale the
vapors, or better still, use VapoRub In
a benzoin steam kettle. If this is not
available, use an ordinary tea-kettle.
Fill half full of boiling water, put in
half a teaspoon of VapoRub from time
to time keep the kettle just slowly
boiling and inhale the steam arising.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, ltc. 23 Left quite
entirely to its own devices, today's
stock market settled down to the dull
routine of the past fortnight, after
a moderately active and strong open
ing in which shippings were tho main
features at extreme advances of 1 to
4 points.
The strength of this particular
group was directly traceable to re
ports from Washington indicating the
early transfer of the BrilUn tonnage
of the Mercantile Marine to npany to
the United States government a
satisfactory financial basis.
A few other stocks derived s ime
benefit from the rise In shippings, bjt
this proved to be only temporary, tha
whole list falling back before mid
day. For the balance of the session the
movement was one of idlo drift, main
ly downward, in which standard rails
were relatively heavier than specula
tive issues.
Other pofnts of weakness emored
the coppers, secondary equipments.
Studehaker and utilities. United
States Steel was less prominent than
usual, but resisted pressure better
than other issues of the same divi
sion, at no time losing more than a
fraction. Total eales amounted to
360.000 shares.
Bonus were heavy as a result of
the weakness shown by minor rails
and utilities, in which losses rauirom
1 to 2 per cent. Marked improveinoiit
was evinced by the Liberty (Hvioion,
the 3s advancing over 1 per cent,
and the fourth 44s rallying substan-
tially from last week s- low quotations,
Total sales, par value, were $14,250,-
000. Old United State3 bonds were
unaltered on call.

to 1. Iu provisions, the outcome
ranged from 30c decline to 25c ad
vance. For a while, corn showed all around
strength chiefly as a result of con
tinued unsettled weather, which im
plied further dejay to the crop move
ment. In addition, bullish sentiment
was emphasied by the general notice
taken of the fact that the principal
shortage of yield this season was iu
the seven states which' usually supply
the greatest surplus. Demand, how -
