PATRIOTISM ACID
TEST IN CHOOSING
BISBEE OFFICIALS;
Citizens' Non-Partisan Ticket !
Proves Loyalty to Nation I
While Opposition Fails;
Citizens Know Right. j
Monday the citizens of Bisboe will I
be called upon to select a mayor and !
six aldermen to govern their commun
ity. They ara offered two selections.
The campaign has been brief, little j
publicity has been given either ticket !
in the Bistee papers. But, the issues
which, are at stake are well uefinci, I
and scarce a citizen lias not been ad-
vised of ihe importance ot selecting '
the best men and the men who s'.?.nd i
for really constructive, important, pa-i
triotic measures in uamrm itraticn. i
There is just one great issue at '
stake in the election. Patriotism, the
winning of tiie war. and what vaca :
-has done to assist toward the ultimate
victory assured this country, are the
measures in which the voters of the
district must weigh and balance each
candidate. No other groat Issues aro
placed in the balance. Party lines
liave been practically discarded in ac
cordance with the request of the pres
ident and the National League for
Unity. Canstrucl've administration,
economy, civic improvements and own
ership will depend largely on the cal
ibre of the elected mayor and alder
men, and those who have done their
utmost to assist the nation to victory
may be depended upon to give equally
patriotic and efficient effort to home
administration. All minor issues), all
minor planks in platforms on which
candidates are running, all factional
questions are included in one great
frreat issue of patriotism what each
candidate is doing for his country.
Miners Pr"ve Loyalty
Patriotism has become in this dis
trict a part of each resident. The
records of the employes of mining
companies sre sufficient evidence of!
the truth of this statement. Pay be
lore yesterday a Red Cross slacker
was ridden from the Junction mine on
a rail. Yesterday two more of tha
wanifi type received the same treat
ment. Al the Holbrook, a man wa3

ilar refusal. Witness the record of
the miners in the war stamp cam

pay each month more than $8,000 for!
stamps. In the Copper Queen, the
Shattuck and the Penn,mners have
signed up for large sums of baby
war bond. In the Shattuck recently
the men pledged 95 per cent to the
Liberty bonds.
And within the past week the great
est display of patriotism ever wit
nessed in this Plate has been evident
through this district. Miners in the
four large properties have pledged I
thjeir support to these war oreaniza-'
Hons more than 98 per cent strong. I
Men are known by their deeds !
not by their words and in voting fori
a mayor and six aldermen Monday, I
citizens should judge by the records,;
not by printed handbills of camcii-l
fiaged patriotism.

"To begin with, the indications we

"We can put the American army on

by "burning grain fields, destroying
food production plants and wrecking

"If the Germans strike in the oast,
we shall be ready to strike in the

overthrow of the government, Bourg
was quoted as saying. He said that
Germans and rebel leaders knew that
the greit rumber of Germans in Amer

an organizer in the harvest fields last
year resulted in his being branded
with the letters "I. W. W." on his
body by c mob, was the most ardent
of the Milwaukee speakers in his revo
lutionary pronouncements.
"We wil; be doing a good thing for

Fnbela Caused Trouble
This incident is believed here to
! be the real cause of the break, ami
those who entertain this belief are
i firm in the conviction that Mexico was
convinced thrt the United States was
responsible for the incident.
When Penor Fabela's luggage Was
searched it was maintained by so:ii5
that the person who did it was not
a Cuban official at all, but some other
agent in the disguise of a Cuban
inspector or gendarme. Later, how
ever, it seemed to have been , satis
factorily established that the man
really was a Cuban inspector.
A break between Cuba and Mexico,
it is felt, disrupts practically nothing
bui. a long standing friendly relation.
In the opinion of those in close touch
with the sirtjoct it may actually pivo
Cuba a free hand, as the Mexican for
eign minister says in his announce
ment, but perhaps not in the manner
suggested.
Report Huns Active
American agents for some time have
been reporting German agents oper
ating in Cuba, some of them crossing
frequently to the United States as
Cuban citizens or Mexican citizens.
A severance of diplomatic relations
probably would leave the Cuban gov
ernment feeeling more at liberty to
investigate their- activities.
When first class powers are con
cerned, a break in diplomatic rela
tions inevitably has been followed by
war. Between lesser powers this rule
often fails to hold gi od.
HAVAN'A, May 2",. The exact situ
ation with reference to the diplomatic
relations between the Cuban and Mex
ican republics is difficult to define in
view of the wide divergence of inter
pretations placed upon the departure
or Ve Mexican charge d' affaires from
Havana who, before sailing, paid a
courteous and friendly visit to Pres
ident Menocal.
Apparently his departure had no
more significance than that of any
ether diplomat returning home to
make a repprt to his government. That
the Cuban charge in Mexico has been
recalled recently is merely a coinci
dence and not connected with any
question pending with Mexico.
Sub-secretary of State Patterson
! stated to the press that the reports
j that the diplomatic relations hav5
i been broken off weer groundless and
i showed a dispatch from the Cuban
I charge in Mexico, Senor Santamaria,
I stating that the latter had been in
j formed by the Mexican prime minister
'of foreign relations that the recall of
I the Mexican cl.arge does not consti
tute a rupture of diplomatic relations.

Every one of them is working day an 1

any one of a cozen patriotic commit

Patriotism Is Issue
Here are the facts to be we!g'"J
in the balance which citizens of P,is

women who are purchasing bonds and
stamns and giving of their monev it

are asked to vote for one or another
of two tickets. The one flvs a false
fiag of patriotism and duty atiu cit

actions establishes its unbounding an 1
absolute patriotism.
Men and women who are giving un

the audacitv and presumntion to op

to lay claim to eood citizenship, to
boast of patriotism, and to "fly tho

be relied on to see the camouflage in

And still the Warren district Red Cross
war fund grows. Over the top, then the
quota was doubled and now the sixty thou
sand mark means nothing at all in our
young life's dream of patriotism.
Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany and Em
peror Charles of Austria, at their recent
conference in Berlin, selected kings for the
newly conquered Russian provinces of
Lithunia, Courland, Poland and Esthonia.
Four kings! Pretty hard to beat. But
they have been beaten ; four aces will make
them look sick. Maybe it will be given to
four American aces to turn the trick. Let
us devoutly hope that this honor will be
ours.
The kaiser has undertaken to supply
three million suits of clothes for war work
ers by stripping the civilians of Germany.
Orders have been sent throughout the
length and breadth of the empire for every
one havjng more than one suit to come
through at once under pain of imprison
ment. To all German sympathizers in
these United States this news item is dedi
cated in the hope (vain though it may be)
that it will start a new train of thought re
garding that dear kaiser and his rule of the
beloved fatherland.
A vote tomorrow for the non partisan
candidates is a vote for the winning of the
war and for a better Bisbee. Loyal men
and progressive citizens comprise the can
didates on this ticket and no man or woman
who has the best interests of home, city and
country at heart can afford to either stay
at home Monday or vote for any but the
non partisan candidates. Placing patri
otism above politics is the order of the day
in America The election of the right kind
of men for city, state and legislative office
now is as important as buying Liberty
Bonds and giving to the Red Cross.
The intense patriotism of the miners in
the Warren copper district during the Red
Cross drive has been most marked. They
have not only given liberally to tjSe cause,
but they have helped it in spirit and in act.
In fact, they have taken an intense pride
in the district's fine showing in this drive,
and they have vied with each other by
shift and by shaft and by company in mak
ing the best showing in this great war work.
In proportion to their salaries and their sav
ings the Bisbee miners have probably given
as freely to the Red Cross as any class of
citizens in any community in this nation.
Famine stalks abroad in Petrograd. It is
declared upon reliable authority that hams
sell for three hundred dollars apiece in the
Russian capital and eggs for seventy-five
cents each. That Bolshevik dream of
equality was a spavined nightmare, after
all. And the Germans seized all the stock
and grain in the Ukraine. Yet these Rus--sian
agitators that put the Kerensky gov
ernment out of business by means of the
soldiers' and workmen's council, promised
a Utopia right away. Hard work, skill, or
ganization, duty, sacrifice, economy, cour
age, common sense, these and these only
will come near to bringing security, happi
ness and prosperity to any nation. Russia
has paid the dearest price known to all the
ages for listening to the wild dreams and
false promises of the Bolshevik plotters.
Hunt has asked the people of Arizona
to pay twice for the same service, which is
to say the salary of the governor the past
year. Campbell served the term; Hunt got
the money. But Tom Campbell is not of
that brand. He has written the appropri
ation committee of the legislature urging
them not to pass such a measure. He does
not want the state to pay twice for the
same scrvcic. In his letter Mr. Campbell
snid: "New, while I appreciate the gener
osity of Gov. Hunt, which moves him to
ask the legislature to pay this money out of
the public treasury, and while I agree with
him that I am entitled to it, 1 cannot accept
it if the taxpayers of the state are to be
called up to pay two governors' salaries for
the services of one. I give you my views
on this subject at this time, that the legis
lature may be saved the trouble of giving
it consideration. As to whether Gov.
Hunt's expenses in the contest, which I was
forced to pay in addition to my own, in de
fending an office for which I had received
a certificate of election, are a proper public
charge, I leave to the good judgment of the
legislature."
WHERE DO YOU STAND, GOV. HUNT?
(From the Phoenix Gazette!
So much has been said about Gov. Hunt
being more or Ies3 in sympathy with the I.
W. W. that the Gazette, in justice to
him, gladly allows him space in these col
umns to answer the following questions:
Gov. Hunt, are you now or have you in
the past been in sympathy with the I. W.
W.?
Are you in favor of vigorous prosecution
and-punishment of I. W. W. charged with
and found guilty of crime?
Do you advocate the punishment of I.
W. W. who have written seditious letters?
Do you advocate the vigorous prosecu
tion and punishment of the I. W. W. now
on trial before Federal Judge Landis at
Chicago ?
Was it with your consent that your ap
pointee, W. B. Cleary, went to Chicago to
defend the accused I. W. W. on trial before
Federal Judge Landis?
Do you favor the anti-I. W. W. resolu
tion as introduced by Mrs. Pauline O'Neill,
May 22, 1918?
Your prompt and positive reply is await
ed. The people of Arizona have a right to
know just where you stand.
A traveling salesman in Bisbee the other
day, fresh from a trip throughout the north
west, made most startling statements in a
most convincing manner. He declared
that there are more wobblies in the north
west than in Arizona, and they were trying
to hamper and harass the lumber and paper
industry of that section, just as their red
card brothers are trying to cripple the cop
per industry here. He told of paper mill
workers who received two dollars and a half
a day before the war who receive seven dol
lars now and who will only work a week a
month. The labor problem, more than any
other, he said, harassed and threatened the
print paper industry of the northwest.
There is a doubtful future for every indus
try in the nation except those engaged in
actual war work or work calculated to help
win the war. One large and old paper in
dustry, in closing its plant recently, had de
clared that after going through unheard-of
trouble and expense in getting their stock
made, they had to wait thirty and fifty days
to get cars to send it to the trade. They had
"profiteered," they said, until they had dug
down to the bottom of their pockets, and
now they were glad and willing to turn
over all their men and material and cars to
Uncle Sam for the period of the war. An
idea of the condition of the print paper in
dustry at present can be gained from the
fact that an Arizona publisher last week
tried in vain to buy 1 00 tons of print paper
extra and besides his regular contract for
daily supply.
'A Bisbee subscriber writes as follows:
"Having seen your editorial in the morn
ing paper concerning the Irish question, I
am glad to say that you are man enough
to put it in a manly way. I can also credit
you with having some knowledge and idea
of Irish affairs, which is more than many
editors who write of them have." Thanks.
This from such a strong and loyal Irishman
as the author of this letter, is praise indeed.
The writer then goes on to narrate some
thing of Ireland's wrongs and Ireland's feel
ings in the matter of the war. He points
out England's many harsh measures against
Ireland in the old times and her many mis
takes in the war. True. Sadly true. But
England is fighting today as bravely and as
well as any nation ever fought for the
final" and overwhelming defeat of Ger
many, and I reland has only one course to
pursue right now, and that is to stand
shoulder to shoulder with all true friends
of liberty and beat the Prussian. Not until
this is accomplished has any individual or
nation wrongs or interests important
enough to intervene between the
thrust of allied bayonets and the foe. Ire
land has her Sinn Fein and America has
her wobblies and her pacifists and German
sympathizers, too. But they are fast going
to trial and to jail in both countries, praise
lie to the saints who watch over all linemen.

ent than it was last year. Arrange
ments an; made to narbeeue four
beeves; beans, sandwiches, salads and
coffee will be served for lunch, all pro
ceeds goiLg to the Red Cross. Every
body come and have a good time.
Mrs. G. H. Hirst, Juvenile probation
ofticer of Douglas, says that she is
receivl.14 many complaints from par
ents or 1-oys 'that their youngsters are
permitted to frequent pool rooms. The
parents say that proprietors should,
for their own protection, as well as
for the welfare of the boys, discourage
such visits. Hamilton Seburn, 16
years old, now in the hands of the
juvenile court, having. been arrested
several days ago, told Mrs. Hart, she
says, that many boys younger than
he, and wearing knee breeches, fre
quent pool rooms daily.
The following boys of WPIeox and
vicinity left yesterday for the. hrpiy:

Dr. .T. A. Stevens, who claims to be
a veteiinary residing at Douglas, ar

ed he was inspecting milk cows and
making tests for tuberculosis. He
claimed that under the laws milch
cows would have to be tested for tu
berculosis whose milk was sold custo
mers end also those wdose milk was
deliversd to dairies. He was making a
charge fo.- testing. This led to sus
picion and as he could not produce

What does it mean to you to know that your
American Red Cross :
Is supporting 50,000 French children. '
, Sends supplies to 3,423 French military hospitals. WviiJIE1'
Provides 2,00 French hospitals with surgical dressings.
Is operating thirty canteens at the front line.
Is operating six other canteens at French railway junctions, serving 30,000
French soldiers a day.
Operates a movable hospital in four units, accommodating 1,000 men.
Is operating a children's refuge in one part of the war zone; and in another
a medical center, and traveling dispensary, both capable of accommodating mora
than 2,000 children.
Has opened a long chain of warehouses stocked with hospital supplies, food,
soldiers' comforts, tobacco, blankets, etc., all the way from the seaboard to t&
Swiss frontier.
Has warehouse capacity for 100,000 tons. m
Has 400 motor cars and operates 7 garages, making all repairs.
Had shipped 46 freight car loads of assorted supplies to Italy from France
within two weeks after it began operating iu the former country.
Had a battery of motor ambulances at the Piave front four days after the
United States declared war on Austria.
Startt-d a thousand different activities in Italy at the time that nation was in
its most critical condition.
Has established 5 hospitals in England and operates a workshop for hospital
supplies employing 2,000 women.
And that 120,000 cases of supplies have been received at the Paris headquar
ters of the American Red Cross from your various chapters scattered throughout the
United States.
What does all this mean to you? And that is
but a fraction of the work your Red Cross has done
and is doing. It means that without this ceaseless,
heroic work of the American Red Cross we could
never win this war. ,
Without your Red Cross quick, vital help to keep
Italy, in the fight for Liberty would not have been
possible. ' ?
. Without your Red Cross thousands of French' .
soldiers now gallantly fighting for you at the front .
would have died of wounds, exposure and lack of food.
And great and wonderful as has been the work
of the American Red Cross in the past, still greater
and more wonderful must it be in the future for
now your boy is in the fight.
Your Red Cross cannot neglect France, England,
Italy, Serbia,. Roumania and little Belgium. It must
give them all constantly increasing help, for the men
of these countries have been fighting our battles.
But now wTe must all redouble our efforts and
sacrifices for our Red Cross because a million mothers'
sons are going to carry the stars and stripes to the
greatest victory God has ever given to men fighting
for honor and liberty.
With the help of your Red Cross your boy will
win.

VERDE X SMELTER
HAY BE BLOWN
JULY 1, IS RE!
PRESCOTT. May 25. Although
rork is being rushed on the United
Verde Extension's new smelter it is
not expected" that the big plant will
be blown in before the first of July.
In the meantime the company is going
ahead with its other building plans in
order to provide homes for its employ
ees and help relieve the . congested
conditions prevailing in the district.
The long extraction tunnel, it is ex
pected, will net be completed before
the expiration of nine months. Until
that time it will be necessary to trans
port the ore over the tramway to the
Verde Tunnel and Smelter Railway,
thence via Clarkdale to the smelter
site. A large amount of ore has al
ready been shipped anil now on the
the ground awaiting the completion of
the smelter.
Again to Extract Ore
After a space of nearly six months
it is planned to resume extraction of
ore from the Jerome Verde, nothing
having been done along this line since
December at which time the agree
ment of the Jerome Verde with the
U. V. Extension to hoist its ores, ex
pired. It seems that a new agreement
has been made in pursuance of which
production from the Maintop claim
will be resumed in June. A raise has
been started to connect the new drift
run north from the 140 level of the
X'nited Verde Extension into Maintop
territory with tJie Maintop stope. That
stope was started on the 900 levtrT of
the Jerome Verde, which corresponds
to the 1200 level of the Extension so
it will be necessary to raise onlv 200
fwt iW,
Green Monster
Conditions lately at the Green
Monster have been so encouraging
that it has been decided to sink the
Dorothy May shaft 500 feet deeper, or
in any event to go 300 feet before
starting a cross-cut. Headings driven
on the white intrusive in the main
tunnel from the Dorothy May shaft
have shown a strong quartz-porphyry
carrying pyrites, ehalcopyrites ana
(rhalcocite -in varying amount. As
the white intrusive and the mineraliza
tion has a dip towards the shaft It
may be possible that it will be .inter
sected before the 1,000 level is reach
ed. It is expected that the white in
trusive will lead, sooner or later, to
a rich ore body, such as always has
been the case in the United Verde
Extension.
Verde Combination
Between April 8 and May S the
Verde Combination shaft was sunk
152 feet, this rate of procress it main
tained, taking the shaft down -.000
feet by the first of next month. The
formation In the shaft is still schist,
showing a great mineralization in the
form of chalcopyrite.
Pittsburg-Jerome
Strong hopes are entertained that
the streak of chalcocite which was re
cently followed 15 feet or more in the
"So. 9 drift, west on the 500 level, at
the Pittsburg-Jerome, will again be
picked un on the footwall side and
that it will widen out into a real ore
bodj.
Jerome Superior !
It is claimed at the Jerome Superior
that a new sinking record was estab
lished last week when the shaft was
put down thirteen and a half feet In
nineteen hours. The material is any
thing but soft. It Is chiefly jasper
and some rock that looks like chert
but may be quartz porphyrv. At pres
ent the shaft is down 370 feet and
steady progress is- being made. All
foundations are in for the new hoist
but it has not arrived. The new com
pressor has been In for some time.
Verde Squaw
It Is apparent that the Bartor tunnel
at the Verde Squaw is not far from
real ore. The tunnel is now passing
throueh monzonite and quartz heavily
Impregnated with, white iron and chal
copyrite. It is easy to pick speci
mens of pay ore from the muck. The
last shot fored showed not only more
pyrlte and chalcopyrite than had pre
viously been encountered but a great
deal of, moisture. It is possible that
& watercourse is not far distant, and
mining men declare that when a real
watercourse is intersected a big ore
body will be found.
Reviving Old Bonanza
H. C. Wilmot of New York, after
buying all the stock to be had locally
of the famous old Tip Top silver-tungsten
mine, located on the southern
end of the Bradshaw range, but which
has not been operated for many years,
has returned to Xew York and mining
men here are waiting with expectancy
an announcement of the revival of the
property which in days agone made
many in this section rich. It is said
that a strong well-financed syndicate
is back of Wilmot and that prelimina
ry operations are billed to begin early
next month. In addition to its rich
silver content the ore runs high in
tungsten.

RAY CONSOLIDATED
IN REPORTS DECREASE
PORT! FIRST QUARTER
The Ray Consolidated fopper Com
pany reports for the quarter ended
March 31 net proCits or 11,025.236,
against $2,547,541 in the preceding
quarter and a deficit after disburse
ments of $471,316 against a surplus of
$993,633 in the fourth quarter of 1917.
The net profits are equivalent to 70
cents a share on the outstanding
1.577.179 shares or at the annual rate
of $2.80. This compares with $1.63 J
earned in the December quarter of I
last year, and with share profits of
$6.15 tor 1917, and $7.43 ror iib.
The gross production of copper con
tained in conrentrates for the quarter
was 20.522,558 lbs., an average month
ly production of 6.840.853 lbs., against
2l.071.S74 lbs. in the previous quarter,
or an average monthly production of
7.023.S5S lbs.
In addition to the copper derived
from concentrating ores, there was a
total of 1.4S8.967 pounds ,of copper
contained in ores sent direct to the
smelter. This, combined with the
copper . contained in concentrates.
brings the total gross production from
both sources for the quarter, to 22.-
011.525 pounds, as compared with 22,
730,677 pounds for the previous quar
ter. During the quarter, there was
milled 878.200 dry tons, averaging
1.5Sf!. This tonnage corresponds to
a daily average of 9758 tons, as com
pared with 9,715 tons for the previous
quarter.
The mill extraction for the quarter
was 14.799 feet. The milling cost for
the quarter was 97.904c. per ton, as
compared with 91.042c. for the previ
ous quarter. The average mining cost
of ore milled for the quarter was
$1.52 per ten, of which 5.639c. was the
cost of coarse crushing leaving the
net mining cost, $1.46361 per ton, as
compared with a net cost of $1.24 for
the previous quarter. The total
amount set aside as a reserve for
county, state and federal taxes during
the quarter was $542,844.96.
The average cost per pound of all
net copper produced for the quartet
was 15.307c. This compares with a
cost of 13.S36c. for the previous quar
ter, and includes a charge of 12Vie.
per ton of ore milled for' the retire
ment of mine development expenses
and credit to operating costs of divi
dends from the Ray & Gila Valley
Railroad, gold Jind silver produced
and all other miscellaneous income.
All sales of copper reported for the
quarter were made at the government
price of 23 Vie. per pound. That price
however, has only been fixed to ap
ply until the first-of June and, there
fore, no sales can be recorded at any
definite price beyond that date. This
situation made it impossible to de
termine definitely the value of con
sderable quantities of copper which
at the end of the quarter had been
specified on government orders foi
delivery after June 1, and such cop
per so specified was included in the
unsold inventory. For this reason the
reported sales for the quarter were
not equal to the production (whereas
the reverse was true in the preceding
quarter), and accordingly there was
a substantial increase in the amount
of copper inventoried as unsold and
carried at 13Vic. per pound. This is
reflected in the stated earnings, which
are correspondingly less than the
amount that would have been arrived
at by applying to the quarter's pro
duction the difference between the
stated cost of 15.307c. per pound and
the present government price.
The regular quarterly distribution,
amounting to $1 per share, was paid
March 31, 1918, and amounted to
$1,577,179.
The total dividends paid from the
beginning of the company's operations
to the end of this quarter amounted
to $17,132,430.

THE ARIZONA DREAM MINE
THE ARIZONA DREAM MINE SUN
The soul of Abner Ellet wandered
away from his body, explored regions
of which he had never heard, found a
long lost brother and a mine in Ari
zona. This remarkable incident of a
quarter of a century a?o involved the
writer in a correspondence with the
London Society for Psychical Re
search, of which, the late Rt. Hon. W.
E. Gladstone was an earnest member
and investigator. The society asked
for more complete narration than was
contained in a press dispatch from
Phoenix. Abner Ellett was after
ward well known here. His brother.
Lew Ellett, was an early resident of
the territory and in the late seventies
went into the Mule Mountains with
George Warren, after whom that dis
trict was named.
The' telling of this story should be
begun at the beginning.
The Ellett brothers, natives of
Kentucky, enlisted on the side of the
Union in the Civil war and fought
through that struggle. Abner Ellett
was regularly mustered out of the
service, but Lew Ellett. after the sur
render of Lee, when it was apparent
that there was no more fighting to be
done, summarily left and became tech
nically a deserter.
Soon after the close of the war, Ab
ner Ellett married and moved to a
farm near Goffs, in the northeastern
part ,of Kansas. In 1SC8 the first
word was received from his brother,
who was then in Montana territory.
He was, after that, heard from irreg
ularly during the next ten years. H
was moving about in Montana, north
ern California and Nevada. After
1S7S no letter was received from him
and he was then given up as dead.
It will be noticed that the figure
"8" enters into this relation with fre
quency. In 1888 Abner Ellett, then
In robust health, one day drove from
Goffs to Wetniore, the county seat.
Soon after his arrival he was sudden
ly stricken down and was carried into
a hotel, where he lay for the next
three days, a part of the time in a
coma and a part of the time in a de
lirium. He recovered as suddenly as he had
been stricken and insisted, until he
had been convinced by a preponder
ance of evidence that he had not been
out of the room where he lay, that he
had been on a visit to a place called
Prescott. Arizona, where he had met
his brother Lew. Abner Ellett had
probably never heard of Prescott. He
was an ignorant man and in those
days there were many intelligent per
sons in the X'nited States who were
not aware of the existence of Arizona
towns.
In a few. days he received a letter
from his brother, who was actually at
Prescott. and that fact seemed so re
markable that the Kansas City Star
devote.J much space to the chronicling
of the incident. The correspondence
thus reopened, Abner Ellett wrote his
brother about .what he called his
"dream." He said that he had dream-

ed that his brother owned a silver
mine about sixty miles south of Pres
cott; that he himself had visited the
mine and that he had found a gold
mine in the vicinity. His gold mine
consisted, he said, of a very rich de
posit of gold in a bluff, capped by a
flat rock, on the edge of a gulch. This
rock was exactly 400 yards south and
600 yards east of the "mouth" of the
silver mine.
In due time he received a letter
from his brother, saying that he and
a man named George Sine owned a
silver mine sixty miles south of Pres
cott. He said that lie had followed
the measurements given him by Ab
ner Ellett, but they had led him to no
flat rock on the etfse of a gulch. He
added that, he did not much believe in
dreams, anyway.
In 1S92 Abner Ellett, accompan
ied by his wife, went to Prescott. He
told the writer, not long afterward,
that the town when he first saw it,
was almost as familiar to him as Goffs
He remembered all the more promi
nent buildings, the Burke hotel and
the courthouse. He thought he also
recalled some of the people his er
rant soul had seen.
He accompanied his brother to his
silver mine and recognized many of
the landmarks he had seen through
the eyes of his soul. The mine was
quite familiar to him, though he had
never in the flesh seen any kind of a
mine. He had provided himself with
a measured rope. He learned that
his brother had made a mistake. H-?
had gone 600 yards south and 400
yards east. Correcting this measure
ment according to his dream, he
found the rock on the edge of the
gulch. It was not a promising site
for a gold mine, and moreover, it was
not in a gold region. A thin trans
verse ledge of decomposed granite
was found in the bottom of the gulch
and, though it had no appearance ot
being gold-bearing rock, it was as
sayed and was found to run high in
gold.
The Ellett brothers and Sine locat
ed the property and called it the
"Dream Mine." It was then late in
the fall or early in the winter and
Ellett and his wife were ordered to a
lower altitude. They came to Phoe
nix, Abner having provided 'his
brother with 'money for development
of the claim.
A month later, I;w Ellett appeared
In Phoenix, saying that the heavy
snows in the I'radshaws had stopped
work. He brought with him samples
of ore which he said had been ev
countered at the bottom of a ten-foot
shaft; there were indications, he said,
of an almost inexhaustible deposit or
such ore. One sample was taken to
J. A. i'orterie, the assayer. and an
other to the agents of the McArthur
Forrest process, which then had an
office in Phoenix. The assays varied
only slightly, showing values between
$450 and $500 a ton.
This was the climax of the story in
vestigated by tlie London Society for
77J7mvJ
Psychological Research. It is regret
table that there was an anti-climax.
Lew Ellett, it transpired, was a
drunken, worthless character. He
spent the winter in Phoenix, hanging
about the saloons, sleeping at the
Dublin corral. When decent weather
came again in the mountains, Abner
urged his brother to resume opera
tions on the mine. He told him that
they were both old and would have
but little time to enjoy the great
wealth that was in store for them un
der the flat rock. Lew lingered until
at last, driven by the insistence of his
brother, he consented to return to the
mine. Abner purchased a team and
wagon, loaded it with supplies, and
Lew was expected to leave the fol
lowing morning.
Late in the afternoon of that day.
I as he passed the corral. he was
amazed to see Lew come reeling out
of it. "I thought you started to the
mine." said Abner.
"There ain't no mine," replied Lew
with the frankness of intoxication.
"But there is," persisted Abner;
"didn't we have $500 ore?"
"Oil," jeered Lew, "that ore didn't
come from within ten miles of that
mine."
I have never seen a more downcast
discouraged man than Abner Ellett
that night. The earth had been cut
from beneath his feet. But he slept
over it and though he had lost con
fidence in his brother, his confidence
in the dream had returned with its
full force. So much had been con
firmed that there could be no failure
in the family.
A few weeks later Abner Ellett re
turned to Kansas, stopping ' at the
Dream Mine. No work had been
done, on it. He employed a couple of
Mexicans and they sank an eight-root
shaft through the flat rock. They
took out a quantity of ore which. Ab
ner wrote me. had shown good val
ues; there was not very much of it.
but there were indications that the
volume would increase with depth.
But all indications, however bright,
were dull and were valueless In com
parison with the dream.
The next fall Abner Ellett returned
and a little more work was done on
the mine. Whether his faith was fail
ing or not, I do not know, but on his
third visit he did not visit the prop
erty at all. On a fourth, I think he
Informally organized a company of
Phoenix men, for the development of
tho property, but. so far as I know,
operations were never resumed.

June Copper Price and
City Election Divide
Interest, in This City
Patriotism of Mining Men and Residents of Bisbee Is on
Trial, Feeling Pervading Entire District; Recommenda
tion of Twenty three and One Half Cent Metal Has Wide
Bearing.
The copper metal price and the city election on Monday are dividing
public interest in the Warren district. In each instance the public is united
In hope that the course will be followed which will accord best with the
Epirit of win the war which has had such splendid demonstration in Liberty
Loan subscriptions. War Savings Stamps purr-liases, and Red Cross .sub
scriptions, each of which has run above 97',; iu the district.
The'. spirit of no pacifism and of no tolerane of slackers had great stim
ulus during the last Liberty I-oan campaign in the district, and has been
still further advanced in the Red Cross campaign. The burning sentiment
of the hour, in fact, is comprised in this issue. It looms larger, locally.
indeed, at the moment, than even the advance in wages which would attend
a higher price for copper and which would bring aliout greater output of the
metal from both large and small producers, who, under higher metal prices,
would be able to mine their lower grade ores as well as their hish yrade.
Pacifism, slacking and a tinge of out and out Wobblyisra are all present
in the opposition in the city election to the selection of the Citizen's non
partisan ticket, the latter chosen regardless of politics and with no other
purpose than that of the highest possible help In winning the war in the
quickest possible time . On the Citizens' non-partisan tisket there is no can
didate who does not and has not constantly stood foremost in the ranks of
those backing the government in the fullest, keeping away from pro-German
pacifism, from sympathy with slackers and slacking in every way, and from
any association or sympathy whatever with Wobblyism, the latter inclusive
of pro-Germanism, root and branch.
PACIFISTS SEEK SUPPORT
On the ticket opposing the Citizens' non-partisan candidates there are
pacifists and iu the published platform on which they are running there is
recurrence of attacks on "the interests," the latter unnamed and mysterious,
which have the same sound as the I. W. W. talk that was. in vogue in the
district a year ago and to which Some of the opposition candidates were
listening submissively if not raptly. but certainly without protest and with
out exercising the police power they had to stop the greater part of the
public propaganda of pro-German speech making. The revival in the op
position platform of such i. W. W. tainted talk as comprised, even if mildly,
in the attacks on "the interests," does not sit w-ell on anv loval stomach in
Bisbee and is alone sufficient to give to the opposition to the Citizens' non
partisan ticket a tremendous jolt in the election on Monday. Bisbee citizens
do not care to take any chances on letting back in any degree the conditions
of a year ago which through Pacifism resulted in crippling the nation and its
allies through crippling the output of copper from the mines of the Warren
district,
i
Relative to the price of copper, the matter is in the hands of President
Wilson. The War Industries Board passed it up. it Is reported, with recom
mendations that the present price be continued. W hat the president wi'.l
do. is unknown. It is considered, however, that it is a foregone conclusion
that he will sustain the Board. On the other hand, it is felt to be entirely
likely that he will assume the responsibility of overruling the Board, apply
ing his broader knowledge of the general situation and raising the price cf
the metal.
Whatever the War Industries Board may do with regard to copper price,
it Is not now indicated that much increased Incentive will be given for larger
production of the metal. Such increase as does come will have to be from
the smaller producers, because the large producers are going at the top of
their ability and have been doing so continuously, and with Cie increased
freight charges and other rising prices on necessary supplies which must
attend, together with hisher wages and higher charges at the eleotrolvtio
refineries iu the east, the case of the small producer is no better t'lan it was."
SOME ENCOURAGEMENT
Price discussion has brought out the fact that there has been no copper
for consumers making non-essential products for more than a year and that
the consumers engaged upon production of war materials have kept t!ie
supply cleaned up from week to week. There is encouragement in th?l fact
for the small producer because it gives him the highest assurance that i
possible of extending that after the war there will be greater demand for
copper for ordinary, non-essential manufacture than ever before knnwn.
Stocks and shelves will be bare. The small producer who is able to carry
on his development work, even though he is limited to small production
from his highest grade ores at this time, will come on an open market in
which copper will likely go to the highest prices ever known. It will be the
small producer who lias been able to finance continued development in the
interim who will reap the harvest.
v
LARGE PRODUCERS GOING LIMIT
The large producers of copper In the meantime must continue the pro
duction of their metal at the highest rate they can make, regardless of price,
for they are fixed in that course and the country must have the metaL To
follow out this policy there will have to be continuance of the neglect ot
in normal proportion to ore extraction, for both cannot be carried on at
normal under the high cost figures and the low metal price, comparatively.
Whenever it has been attempted in the last year, production has fallen be
hind and it has been necessary to immediately curtail development and to
back to the maximum employment of forces on mining. The only possible
outcome is a dearth of metal from the large mines the minute they are let
out from under the strain imposed upon them in keeping the metal supply of
the nation up to its war needs. When relieved from that strain they ar

I. W. W. Propaganda Fall Flat
A : year ago such utterances in sym
pathy with I. W. W. and other radical
pro-German disturbers as have recent
ly been .Jieard in a governor's message
and in radical comment: upon Federal
grand jury . actions, ; would have pre
cipitated strikes in every industrial
district in the state. It is the strong
est kind of evidence that .. great
change has-'come' about and that the
i worker, is awake to the needs of the
government 'for 'his undisturbed labor,
that scarcely a ripple of attention has
been paid the recent outbursts. This
is the more significant in view of the
fact that these outbursts have been
accompanied by the issuance of new
I. W. W. literature urging the abolish
ment of wages and the seizure by the
1. W. W. of all properties. At the
same time I. V. V. leaders have in
timated that the policy being pursued
is based upon decision to bring nation-wide
strikes during the summer
and their members and friends onry
await the word.
Strength is Gone
ima may uts uuc( uui mcic is ev
erything to indicate that these wiio
are awaiting the word are the very
large minority and that any start they
may make will meet with harsh re
ception. There is no disposition to
permit an open resumption of the
strike or disaffection programs any
where in the mining industry. Tbe
average mine, mill and smelter work
er is emphatic in his attitude in this
respect and the professional disturber
has less standing than ever before.
He is not in position to get to first
base anywhere in the state. Wtfrk
men will not listen to him any more
than will the employers. Operator
and operative have reached common
ground in this matter and will not be
budged from it.
' The Labor Supply
The labor problem continues to be
one of shortage of men for particular
lines of work rather than one of any
general shortage of men. Nearly all
of the mining districts have an abun
dance of men to fill every post oi
duty, provided 'the men were fitted to
take over the duties. Technical men
are short of the needs and their lack
is beginning to delay new work. In
some districts there is a shortage of
machine men and in others of timber
men and other classes. The shortage
among mechanics has been reduced
somewhat but is still in evidence. The
reduction has come about through the
return of numerous men from ship
yards, where they failed to find the
demand for labor or the working
conditions they had expected.
Activity in Construction

tension smelter, carrying out of Unit
ed Verde smelter Improvements and

with improvements in Uie operating!
division of the latter which will en-!
tail the expenditure of several million I
dollars, goes on as actively as it can
be crowded. At Humboldt the smelter
betterments of the Consolidated Ari
zona Smelting Co. and the work on
the lower levels of its mines which
has so greatly increased the ore re
serves in the last year, continue una
bated. Reports from other parts of
the state indicate that there is like
maintenance of the policy which has
prevailed in Arizona copper mining
to crowd ahead with all possible vigor
both in the conduct of immediate
work and in preparation so far as
possible to carry production of metal
on in the future with unabated re
sults, regardless of expedients in new
methods and equipment which may
have to be resorted to.
To Utilize New Ore
In the Warren district there is not
able endeavor in this direction in the
mill erection which Shattuck-Arizona
has made to liandle its low grade lead-silver-copper
ores. The mill ii at a
standstill at present awaiting the ar
rival of equipment delayed in manu
facture and transportation. The
Phelps-Dodge Corporation's great low
srade enterprise, in taking down Sac
ramento Hill to recover the low grade
copper content, is coming along more
rapidly. The top of the hill is nowj

ly as can be managed.

Tucson District
Is the mineralized area about Tuc
son about to bring in another great
copper producing district for Arizona?
Signs, as embodied in new discoveries
of ore of commercial quality and iian
tity. and of favorable attendant con-j
ditions of formation, point strongly
that way so strongly that recent
weeks have witnessed the income of
a very sizable amount of new capital I
and new energy to pursue the (level-j
opnient work ahd prospecting which :
is under way. '
Of World Concern
A enr a'o this uouid have, been
matter o local imiortance and ol
importance to the interests here and(
elsewhere in the country directly con
cerned because of their investment ot
time and money, and to the copper
mining world in a general way and
there it would have ended. Today,
under war conditions, it is a matter
of national interest, and going beyond
that of even greater interest to the
countries of Europe in alliance witn
the United States in war.
Better Realized- Abroad
The countries of Europe in all like
lihood realize' the' importance of the
prospector's' pick and of the energies
of capital in delving in new copper
country far more than it is realized at
home. They have no copper to dig;
but their need ot copper to shooT is
vital. They must look to this country
for the metal, and that being the case
their vision goes deeper than can be
expected Jroni the people who have
been accustomed to having more cop
per than they needed, which until the
last few years has been the position
of the people of the United States.
The man with money in his pockets
in excess of his needs is never so
much concerned about how to keep up
the supply as the fellow alongside of
him who has nothing in his pockets
but must get something there imme
diately. Vital to War Conduct
Recently there has been a consider
able awakening in America aboutcop
per, and there is a great deal more to
come. The understanding of the ne
cessity of the metal as a material has
broadened, and so also has the under
standing that the tremendously in
creased demands made by war have
depleted reserves of ore, while by
reason of low price and unceasing
speed-up demands from those making
use of the metal on war contracts,
there has not been the opportunity to
make up for the depletion througu
new development in established
mines or, more correctly, to attempt
tal make up for it through research
for new ore bodies.
Mining Country Understands
The mining country understands
this. Operators and operatives in the
copper camps know it. They have
been speeding up for months because
of it, as individuals. Every day their
patriotism asserts itself a little
stronger in this respect. It is the
cause behind increased endeavor, too,
on the part of the prospector and Uie
operator engaged upon development
and the man who gets the money for
both of these and the man who puts
up the money. With some this may
be on the sub-conscious side, but it is
underlying in one shape or another
with all of them They know there
must be more metal found; they are
hard put to find it. Added to the de
sire to win returns, to give new
wealth to the world, to do big indus
trial things, the factors which have
always sustained and driven the min
er and the mining interest on, there is
now the far higher stimulus coutained
in the country's need.
Results Are Coming
In the Tucson area, in the new' Kay
distrfct, in the Wenden district these
elements are finding pronounced ex
pression aud are being attended by
the finding of important things in ore.
This is also true of operations in the
Verde district prospecting area, in
those of the Globe and Miami dis
tricts, in the Warren, the Ray and tne
Superior districts. The same genu
ment, the flag at the top of the mast
now and forever, no bet overlooked to
increase the metal supply necessary
to keep it there, predominates with all
of these miners, consciously or sua
consciously, but predominant just tne
same. Backed by such spirit, it is not
at all to be wondered at that mining
men in Arizona look for the achieve
ment of more in the discovery and
mining ot new ore between now and
the end of the war than during anyj
previous period of several times the:
same length in the history of the in
dustry in the state, and to make a rec
ord Jhe mining men will admittedly!
have to trot fast. j
This does not mean that he has not
been doing so, but only that he is go
ing a little faster all the time. Re
member, too, that he has been doing
so with less encouragement than giv
en any other of our industries copper
alone has had a falling price and
rising wage, minimum price and max
imum costs in every respect. But no
copper producer has had a word of
protest to give out. Neither has any
man engaged in the development of
copper country. They have all accept
ed the situation as it has come about,!
even though some have been com pell-1
ed to close down. Not a one who has
closed down, however, but has turned
immediately to endeavor to find soine-i
thing new that would enable him to
produce until such time as the price
of copper should be fixed by the gov
ernment at a figure that will permit
him to resume the. operation or his
developed property.
New Perception Awakened
TJie spirit of determination to do
all that can possibly be done by those
remaining over here in aid of those
over there, has developed widened
perception as to values of all kinds
and has brought the utmost ingenuity
into action to work out new combina
tions which will produce returns in
available inctal ironi materials which
may have previously, been considered
hi "non-commercial, either by reason
of their combination of contents or
because of isolation, or both, or be
cause it was felt that there was some
thing bigger in the next range. Very
rapidly, it is becoming distinctly out
of fashion to pass anything by. Ev
erything that bears the stamp of niin
en'lizatioii is getting the acid test.
with astonishing results, as is demon
strated by the increase made in the
output of copper notwithstanding re
tarding factors of price, deplcl tech
nical help, shortage in certain lines
of lalmr. nisli costs cf materials .and
slowed down transportation facilities.
Increase in the iic elopmcnt and pro
dm Hon ol other ascntial war rii' tui-.
manganese. molybdenum. tungsten.
etc., as deuioublialtd iu the decreased
importation requirements, is equally
astonishing. And in Arizona a grea:
part of tbe increase in availability of
these latter metals has come abou;
throusu the activities of" the copper
miners, who have found them in as
sociation with copper formation they
were following. i
Much Developing here '
Tucson's mineralized area is large'
of as great resourcefulness in its di-j
versity of minerals as any on the con-'
tinent. It is not a generally realized
fact, even at home, that one of the j
comparatively few important plan:s
for the reduction of the rarer metals J
has been established in Tucson and
is successfully operated on ores from '
properties in the Tucson area. Nor is I
it generally realized that the Sasco j
smelter in the Tucson area is output
ting in the neighborhood of a million
and a half pounds of copper each
month from ores drawn from produs-
ing mines in this area, none of -them ;
as yet big properties but all produc
ing the needed red metal. It is well
to mention these things occasionally
by way of preventing the notion from
getting root that the district is alto
gether an experiment. On the other
hand, it is, in fact, a pretty much es
tablished proven pay zone. From all
sources it is mining probably close
to two million pounds of copper the
month, or 24 million pounds the year,
an output that not so long ago would
have been looked upon as entitled to
important rank in the producing col
umns in Arizona. It was only a few
years ago that Jerome raised its out
put from the Verde district above
3.(100.000 pounds tha month, that
Globe-Miami district jumped from
around 2,500,000 pounds the month to
a normal of around 20,000,000 pounds
Uie month at this time, that Clifton
raised above 3.000.000 pounds the
month. At this time there is the Su
perior district widely famed as the
possessor in Magma of one of tne
richest copper mines in the country,
with production of around a million
pounds the month as compared with
the near two million pounds whlcn
the Tucson district is producing In
the aggregate.
Gradual But Sure
The Ajo district, with production at
this time of 4.000,000 pounds the
month, commenced making copper a
year ago, after sixty years of inter
mittent prospecting, development and
small production. Tucson's area has
been under prospecting and develop
ment for nearly as long. United Ver
de Extension made good at Jerome
8 Iter 17 years of development work.
These things are worth thinking
about because they demonstrate that
it takes time and a great deal of en
deavor to make a big producing dis
trict. It is very far from all digging
at that. But for the chemists and lao
oratories and the new thines they
have worked out there would not be
a copper camp able to operate in Uie
state today on 23-1-2 cent copptT.
Chemistry has done a great deal ror
the Tucson district, and will do vastly
more. Ores are in this district in
abundance which will yield not only
profitably of the predominant copper
value but also of other highly import
ant war values before the chemists
get through with them. And the
chemists are busy not only here but
everywhere.
Attention Attracted i
Upwards of fifty mining properties
are under development in the Tucson
district. Of these nearly half are min
ing and shipping ore. Several are
mining exceptionally high grade and
getting it from bodies which give
promise of making into large extent.
Depth and plenty of cutting up of the
country are the essentials. Discour
agement because of ore pinching or
playing out here and there belongs to
a past era. Mining men with under
standing that results are obtained on-1
ly by perserverance and the expendit
ure of large sums in intelligent, ex-
hauutivA pvnlnmtinn nf nrnnrf Inc '
have established this in the district.
They have come in during the las:
four years and their numbers are be
ing increased now with every passing
month. Tucson has more interest for
them at the present time than ever 1
before, and it is interest that is gain-j
ing and carrying important results.
It is quiet but mighty effective. Thalj
it is in operation is established by thej
hotel registers. One day of the last
week w itnessed the presence .here of
five executives of large mining organ
izations in the state, each represent
ing a different interest. On another
day there were two who made visits
to outlying properties. For a week i
there has been in the city one of thp '
most prominent engineers in tl:''
country, renresenting a great mining!
organization which has twice submit-:
ted handsome offers for the control of
a local property, and a third and high-'.
er offer from which has been refused, i
During the week there were three ,
millionaire mining investors in tne j
rity who have heavy interests in the
district and are hacking these with
the highest confidence and all the
funds asked.
Another Big District Due 1
Arizona is duo lor aim! her big cop
per producing district. Ajo. picked
up in earnest bv the Calumet &. Arizo-;
na interests in 1311, was the last.
Tucson, also in the south, should be
the next, because it is further along
with development aud production than
any of the other of the districts in
the state which are reaching out to
get in the class of the really big ones.
Atop of thin is ti:e fact that another
big producing di.stri.t is needed by
tiie nation and by all of fie world en
gaged in fighting the brutality of the
Hun. It is a matter of history as well
as legend that such needs have al
ways been taken care of provided
fcr abundantly by the all controlling
hand, which, too, never falls of re
wardiin earnest endeavor.

MANY WEE PATRIOTS
rR2SCOTT. May 25. Superinten
dent Claude Ferguson of the Copper
Queen' Gold Mining Company reports
tiiat his company is expecting to es
tablish a body of cepper ore at the
900 level. They recently sank "from
the 700 level. At the 900 level a cross
cut of 50 feet has been driven. At 35
feet a vein of good commercial ore
was encountered. They have started
to drift on this vein. The indications
are very promising for its opening up
into a large lense.
The cross cut is . being continued.
They expect to-have 'to go another 50
feet before they encounter a body 61
commercial ore that has been demon
strated on the 700 level. . '
Mr. Ferguson expresses great' prtoe
in the fact' that the Copper Queen
company is 100 percent patriotic.
"Every man. woman and child at
the Copper Queen camp has one or
more bonds of the Third Loan," he
said. "The force at present only in
cludes 12 men. They subscribed ror
$2,000 worth of bonds. President
Goldman then duplicated the amount
subscribed by the rest of the camp,
making the total subscribed for the
camp $4,000.
"There are 8 children in the canfp.
All of them not only have at least a
$50 bond, but each youngster has one
or more I'aby Bonds. This includes
one child that was delivered to Its
happy parents only a few weeks ago."
The Socorro smelter will be moved
to Tucson and operated there.

An opportunity you can't afford to overlook
Did you know that right at your very door, the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFIN
ING COMPANY is every day bringing in oil and ga3 in a formation which oil men who
visit the well predict will result in one of the greatest oil fields in the world?
This is NOT a conjecture IT IS AN ABSOLUTE FACT and at our office at 1 5
North Second Avenue, Phoenix, we have sworn affidavits from men who are on the
ground every day men who KNOW that t hese conditions exist because they have
seen them with their own eyes.
Did you know that in JUST ONE COUNTY in the State of Kansas, during one
" year the oil wells produced MORE WEALTH than all the copper mines in the United
States combined?
And yet the average American thinks of Kansas ONLY as an agricultural state
just as the average American thinks of ARIZONA as a mineral, cotton and cattle state.
Right today, right here in this state, the UNITED CHINO OIL & REFINING
COMPANY has oil indications which should develop into as great an oil field as Kansas
ever dreamed of. Are YOU going to be one of those who get the profits, or not?
Our proposition to the skeptic
WE KNOW what wc have in the field and we have financially interested some
of the most conservative business men in this state merchants, bankers, railroad offi
cials and professional men s imply by SHOWING THEM WHAT WE HAVE and be
cause of their knowledge cf the conservative manner in which the affairs of thir com
pany are being handled. ' ,
The men behind this company are absolutely reliable, local people, and the state
ments we have made have at all times been based on positive facts, which we KNEW to
be true. However, if there is the least doubt in your mind as to the conditions existing
in our well, ve will make you the following proposition:
ANY PERSON WHO WILL INVEST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS in stock of
this company, will be taken to the field by our general manager for a personal investiga
tion, and if we do not show you every indica tion that we claim we have if we do not
show you the actual gas and oil that is bein g brought in every day, we will not only re
turn your investment, but we will pay the entire expense of your trip and $25.00 per
day for your time while on the trip.-
We know we have the Oil and Gas and cerlainly nothing
could be fairer than this proposition
At the present time, with our well down approximately 650 feet, the ga3 coming
out of the hole is so strong that it has a misty4blue appearance, and the gas bubbles in the
bailings, when they break, contain large black drops of oil We have every indication
AND THE MOST CONSERVATIVE MEN WHO VISIT THE FIELD DO NOT HES
ITATE TO EMPHATICALLY ENDORSE OUR PROSPECTS.
We are offering a limited amount of stock at 5 cents per share now and 2 cents
more when oil is being produced in commercial quantities. NOW is the time to buy
we are now making twenty feet of hole every twenty-four hours, and expect to bring in
oil any time. You should get some of this stock NOW if only 1000 shares, because
when we strike oil in commercial quantities: it will be too late to make the big money.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW. SUNDAY MORNING, MAY 26, 1918.
iRl
in time of warmth prepare for cold don t wait, don't delay
you'll upset the entire war-time industrial organization if you do
The "heatless days" of last winter weren't the result of an actual coal shortage they were due, rather
to procrastination the logical consequence of "pulling it off"
Buy your coal today have it delivered at once
let the railroads and the mines nd the yards make the
coal business a regular annual business rather than a mere
cold rush.
It's patriotic to do so. Right now, industrial
plants and power plants are the only coal users not a
pound is being used for heating purposes get your bin
filled while the supply is greater than the demand.
The fuel administrator at Washington and the fuel administrators of every State urge you to
"shop early" for coal if you do, you'll help keep war-time industries going at full "tilt" in winter
. Buying coal now isn't "hoarding" It is "helping" helping to
to spread the load of coal distribution evenly and properly over the year
The undersigned advertisers can take care
of you-place your order with them now with their
GUARANTEE of early delivery fair price, thorough satisfaction.
Do your share to banish the possibilities of
"heatless days." Don't run your coal bin on a "hand to
mouth" basis. Don't wait for a "cold snap" when there's
a rush that may leave you in the lurch.
PATRIOTS COOPERATE. Patriots do what is most helpful, The most patioticaily cooperative and helpful thing you can do is to buy your coal NOW

Total funds obtained lor the Amer
ican Red Cross n the drive in this
district amounted jesterday noon to
$511,617.62. Yet there remain to report
the committees irom the Copper
Queen, from the Shattuck and lit
Denn mines, and many minor accounts
which are still in the hands of com
mittee men and women. Constantly
mounting, the workers are confident
that at the least another $10,000 will
be added, and it is hoped that in the
final count on Monday evening at the
Y. M. C. A. dinner, the quota tor this
district, originally set at $25,000. now
more than doubled, will be nearly it'
not quiet trebbled.
Employes of the Shattuck and Denn
mines, when evening comes today,
will have registered 100 per cent m
their subscriptions to the Red Cross
drive. Through arrangements with tiie
companies the men themselves uae
pledged their entire earnings for this
one day to the campaign.

One of the most liberal givers to
the Red Cross" yesterday was en
countered at the Orpheum Cis;ar stand
when Arthur Block, a recent arrival

Friday. Not satisfied with this, he
offered a flat 10 per cent of the gross
recefpts of his business for Saturday
and Sunday, the two largest days of
his week.

an ocean of unspeakable pain"
VOUR Red Cross is an ail-American, largely volunteer
organization, authorized by Congress, headed by
President Wilson, audited by the War Department, en
thusiastically approved by your Army, your Navy, and
your Allies. - r C . 4
The work covers both military and civilian relief in
every war-torn Allied country and full reports of all
expenditures are continually being published, or are
available through the Chapters.
It stands beside our boys in training here or "over there."
It watches beside the pillows of battle-broken men, and
offers rest and sympathy to war-torn fighters on brief
respite from the front
It carries food and clothing to hungered mothers and
little ones in ruined villages.
It helps rebuild the scattered pile of brick and stone they
4 once called "Home."
It brings back to the hopeless mother's arms her long-
lost child.
It hejps care for the orphans of the men who died hat ,
civilization might live.
It helps care for the thousands that have fallen prey to
dread tuberculosis. ' (
It nobly represents in deeds of mercy, relief, and restora
tion. the more than twenty million members that have
made its great work possible.
Will You Do Your Share to Keep This "Hand of Mercy" at Its Work?
Every cent of every dollar received for the Red Cross War Fund is spent for war relief. All ad
ministration costs, relief w ork for other than w ar purposes (such as the Halifax and Guatemala
disasters) are takenjcare of out of membership dues, and the interest accruing from the bank
in of the Vv'ar Fund has made available for war relief at least J 1 .02 for every $ 1 contribu' xL

Germans m?m
FRENCH CIVILIANS
FRENCH FRONT, April 14 (Oor
respoii(l"noe of Ths Associated Prss)
Lite anions 1h Prrnriirivilians )
hind the Orman linos in thn occupied
departments of France has berome al
most slavery. The oppressed people
have to submit to restrictions depriv
ing them of all the usual amenities of
human existence. Details of the ter
rorizing process introduced hy the
Germans, which is daily becoming
more severe, have reached the corres
pondent of The Associated Press from
a number of renters where the Her
man army holds possession.
According to some of iho.e commu
nications everybody that is to say,
men, women and children i? forced
to work for tho G-rni:in conquerors,
especially In the country districts and
towns near the front. One younjr
woman and she is only cue amonp
many tells how she was made to fell
trees in the forest of Saint Coham.
w-hkh was under constant gunfire,
while in the same vicinity u the sup
ply columns for the troops in the most
dangerous parts of the line were
formed of French civilians.
In the neighborhood of Camhrai all
agricultural work is carried out hy
the peasants under the surveillance ot
German soldiers and when the produce
is ripe it is all requisitioned bv the
military authorities. The factories in
the city itself have been robbed of
their machinery with the result that
large numbers of workers have been
reduced to semi-starvation and conse
quent.sk kness. At the end of 1917
there were still 7.000 inhabitants in
the city, all of whom were compelled
to take refuge in the cellars.
In most parts of the country the ,
' Spanish-Dutch relief, which has taken
the place or the American Relief Com-;
mission, goes on normally, but it is
asserted that the German authorities
manase to obtain possession of a por
tioa of the provisions. In Lille the .
prices of food are extremely high, and j
the population, already impoverished, j
has great trouble to obtain food? Eggs i
cost them 36 cents apiece, meat is :
from $2.C0 to $3 a pound when it is
available, shoes are $25 a pair, cloth j
costs $16 a yard, and there is no beer,
milk or soap to be had, while coal is ,
distributed at the rate of 56 pounds j
per head of the population per month !
at the price of 26 cents a pound or!
$720 per ton of 2.000 pounds. j
In Charleville matters are even j
worse. The people have not had any !
fresh meat for two and a half years .
and for other provisions they have to ,
rely on the relief committee, which ;
makes a distribution twice a week. ;
Each person is given in the course ol ;
every fortnight the following articles ;
half a pound of bacon, half a pound '
of lard, half a pound of salt meat, half '
a pound of haricots, four-fifthf? of a :
pound of snlt, sometimes a fifth of a '
pound of coffee, two-fifths of a pound
of biscuit flour, a quarter of a pound !
of sugar, and small quantities of corn
residue. Eesidqs these things each
person receives once a month a can i
of condensed milk. In the stores cof
fee costs about $7 a pound, sugar
nearly f 2. chocolate nearly $4. The
pale of potatoes is forbidden. i
Nearly all the men work for the
Germans, wlfo forbid them to leave ,
their houses before seven in the ,
morning and thev must return' hy j
eight in the evening. j
At Denain French prisoners have j
been employed in the destruction of J
the factories, from which all the ma- j
chinery has been taken and sent to
Germany, while at Saint Quentin all ,
the statues have been taken down ;
and specialists from Germany have j
removed everything ot value from the,
basilica. !
Even children of school age, most ;
of whom have not had the opportunity j
to go to school three years, are made
to work along the roads and in the :
forests. i
KING GEORGE VISITS .
AMERICAN AIRMEN
LINCOLN, Eneland, April 20 (Cor
respondence of The Associated Press)
King George's first inspection of
American airmen in training was
made this week at a British aero
drome near here, where a squadron
of American aviators is working with
British pilots. One of the young Brit
ish officers at this camp Ms Prince Al
bert, and the King and Queen Mary
had run down from London to see how
their airman son was getting on.
During the inspection on the parade
ground, the King speke with several
of the American officers. The aero
drome is a finishing 'school for pilots
of both airplanes and balloons. Pilots
go there after passing through their
preliminary course, and are taught to
loop, roll and dive, and to become ex
pert in the many other varieties of
aerobatics which are the mark of the
expert flying man.
Later they complete their education
with courses on meteorology and the
theory or flight, and finally pass on
to a gunnery school and qualify for
'the rank of lieutenant. In summer,
if the weather is favorable, the re
cruit can go through the full program
in about ten weeks.
The King and Queen, in the course
of about an hour, saw machines and
buildings and apparatus none of
which was dreamed of three years
ago. Special attention was given to a
giant H3ndley-Page machine which
rested on a tarmac at the edge of the
aerodrome.
The Kinr. after denning a linen dus
ter, climbed into the pilot's seat and
the mechanism was explained to him
bv British and American officers.
