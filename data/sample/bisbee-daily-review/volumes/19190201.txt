rBy Review Leased Wire) j
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. The ad-j
ministration policy of vast naval ex-;
pansion unless world disarmament
becomes a certainty through interna
tional agreement at Paris was ap
proved today by the house naval com
mittee in unanimously recommending
. a new three-year building program of
10 great battleships nd 10 scout
cruisers.
Four democrats and two republicans
were understood to have opposed the
program as originally outlined, but
their approval was given after an
amendment was accepted providing
that work on the new ships should
pot begin until after February 1. 1920.
Administration leaders said the vote
was an endorsement of the program
announced by Secretary Daniels for
an American navy second to none, un
less limitations are ' imposed on all
nations by the peace conference.
Should an agreement for such limita
tion be reached, the bill provides that
the president may stop construction
at his discretion.
Pos-.pone Some Vessels
While tha program, a3 recommenc
ed, does n it authorize the six battle
cruisers aid 13d other small craft
asked for by the department, it was
explained tiat it had been decided to i
postpone construction of these ves
sels until itaval experts could reach
agreement as to their designs basea
on experience gained in the war.
The agreement of the committee
was reached at a long executive ses
sion, after which Chairman Padgett
smilingly announced that the decision
had been unanimous.
Mr. Padgett said the completed
naval bill would carry a total of $750,
000,000 of which sum $169,000,000
would be for ship construction.

Absence of the two students from

through a window and found the body
of Wong on the first floor. Police
were summoned and the bodies of the
two students were found in the base

physicians who examined the bodies
said they probably bad been killed
Wednesday.
Traces of Struggle
The pistol with which the men had
been shot was found on a chair near
Dr. Wong's body. Traces of a death
struggle were in evidence. A heavy
brass table lamp lay on the floor
among the shattered remnants of the
shade and bulbs. A chair in the din
ing room adjoining was overturned
and a brown-colored elastic from a
garter was on the floor.
The bodies of Hsie, who was sec
retary of the Chinese mission, and
Wu, confidential secretary to Dr.
Wong, were found lying head to head
in the furnace room and evidently
had been dragged there. A gas water
heater still was burning when officers
entered the kitchen, which also Is in

MINERS CONSIDER
LABOR CONDITION
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 31. Working
conditions in the copper industry dur
ing the period of transition from a
war to a peace basis were discussed
today by Secretary Wilson and other
officials of the department of labor
with 32 representatives of workers in
the mines, mills and smelters of Ari
zona, Utah and Montana. It was said
that the conference developed only a
preliminary representation of views,
which will be continued: tomorrow.
Grave conditions were said to have
arisen in the copper industry since
the abnormal war demand for copper
subsided. This has been reflected in
the decline of the price of the metal
and in the laying off of between 25
and 30 per cent of the workers, most
of whom, however, have obtained
other employment. Officials were
told that agitators had used the re
duction in working forces to spread
their doctrines, but apparently had
small success.
All information in the government's
hands bearing on the industry such
as the probable demand for copper,
will be furnished to the delegates dur
ing the conference, it was said there
i was no question of a dispute as to
wages and that the conference was
merely to work out some plan, if pos
sible, to stabilize working conditions.
An official statement on the con
ference said the delegates gave the
secretary first hand Information of
the conditions prevailing in the sev
eral districts and expressed them
selves as desirous of finding some so-
,ution of the unemployment problem
denressin ef-
that would not have a depressing ef
fect on the industry. Secretary Wil
son assured them he would co-operate
with them to this end.
Later, the labor men held a private
session for the exchange of ideas and

mitted. The theory of the officers is
that the two students were killed
ftrst by some one who lurked in the
house and that Dr. Wong was mur
dered when he returned home.
Strange Chineman Seen
This theory Is based upon several
facts. The first is that Li went to the
house Wednesday, and upon ringing
the bell, was told by a strange Chi
nese that Dr. Wong was not at home.
Another is that there were only two
discharged cartridges in the pistol,
whereas, at least five shots were fired
into the bodies. The officers think
hat sufficient time elapsed between
the death of the students and of Dr.
Wong for the murdered to hide the
bodies of the first two and re-load
the gun before Dr. Wong reached the
house.
Officials at the Chinese embassy
could throw no lieht on the mystery.
Tsu-Li Sun. attache of the legation,
who is a student at Georee Washing
ton university, missed Wu and Hsie
from the university, and it was at his
suergpstion that Li called at the house
on Wednesday to inquire for Dr.
Wong.
The police have been furnished with
a description of the strange man who
answered the door and they now are
searching for hfm.
Dr. Wong had been in Washington
four years, coining here as the head
of the educational mission which is
charred with placing Chinese students

In making the announcement, the

ally brings to end the activities of the
focd administration except for the con

because of a determination to main

SENATORS OPPOSE
PRESIDENTS PLAN
(Fy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan.. 31. Vigorous
opposition was voiced in the senate
today, by republican leaders to the
plan for dealing with captured Ger

in Asiatic Turkey, which press dis
patches from France yesterday said
had been presented to the peace con
ference by President Wilson.
Democratic spokesmen said they
could not believe the reports that the
president had proposed permanent in

and urged support of the American
peace delegates. Some republican sen

communique issued bythe conference
said a plan for disposition had been
provisionally agreed upon. j

This designation of the correspond

that the one letter had "T" inside a )

in ink and enclosed in a rough square

"Who wrote the name 'Hurley' on

"It looks a little like my handwrit

"When you got something of that !

"No, I might have written 'Armour

said the witness.

Mr. Swift denied this. "

NEW YORK. Jan. 31. Orders di

of objections of employers, were is
sued today by the union's executive
committee, according to announce
ment Lere tonight. .
-John Golden, general president of
the union, said the order had been
telegraphed to 3S0 local unions
throughout the country and that re
sponsibility for the next step was up
to the manufacturers.
tomorrow and submission of the con
ference re-draft probably until Tues
day. I
After spirited, discussion the house ;
with modifications the senate plan j
with mondifications the senate plan 1
for taxing political campaign contri-j
butions.
Demands for separate rotes in the j
house on two "other senate amend-j
ments, levying a prohibitory tax on
products of child labor and applying ;
the Reed "bone dry" prohibition law,
to the District of Columbia were with
drawn today. Retention cf the sen
ate bill now is regarded as assured.
Bonus for Soldiers
While the discussion was proceed
ing in the house it was learned that j
the conferees bad agreed to a com-
promise amendment for payment of a J
bonus of $30 each to enlisted men i
and nurses and $200 to officers of ;
the army, navy and marine corps upon :
discharge or resignation. The bonus j
also would be paid to those already
discharged.
Because of the house discussion no
session of the conferees was held to
day. They will meet tomorrow and ex
pect to finish work on the bill. It
was said, however, that the delay
would prevent distribution of the final
re-draft until next Monday or Tues-.
day and that the conference report
would not be submitted to the house
until Tuesday.
Despite today's action by the house,
the campaign contribution tax .still
remains in dispute for settlement to
morrow by the conferees, with a live
ly contest in prospect. . By a vote of
244 to 61. the house today instructed
its conferees not to accept the senate
amendment which would levy a tax of
100 per cent on campaign contribu
tions in excess of $500. ;
Accept Principle
Immediately afterward, however,
the bouse voted, 191 to 116, to accept
the principle of taxing campaign con
tributions, but to limit such taxes to
future campaigns.
Representative Kitchin, in announc-
ing in the house that he would vote
for a tax on future contributions, de
clared he "doubted exceedingly wheth
er it becomes a Jaw."
Criticism cf the senate proposal was j
general during the house debate. Mem-i
bers referred to it as a "bluff", and
"buncombe" and a "fine for doing in
131 S what was permissible by law."
"I never took any contributions from
the packers, despite the contrary re
ports," declared Republican Leader
Mann, who argued that the senate pro-'
vision was indefinite, and that "it goes !
back to 1916, 1914 and 1942 and that '
shows how ridiculous it is." j
"We have th senate now in a por'
sition where tbey will have to vote
favorably on the proposition or admit
that tbey were bluffing," declared
Representative. Garner of Texas, urg
ing, concurrence in the senate provis
ion. "We can take advantage of this
situation to stop the one thing which
does more to create bolshevism in
this country than any one other thing.
. Large contributions to campaigns are
rightly looked upon with suspicion.
When you find a rich man making a
large contribution, you will find he
has either more money than he knows
what to do with, or he wants to buy
something."

SEATTLE. Wash., Jan. 31- More

this week by a close margin to go out

amendment by Representative Olivei
of Alabama, directing that men who
enlisted in the navy during the war
for the regular term of four years
shall be regarded as having enlisted

ply for such change of stat.us before
next July 1.
After the committee's decision, it
was learned that the navy general
board, headed by Rear Admiral Fletch
er, is studying the question of mili
tary characteristics of new ships close
iy, but has not as yet reached definite
conclusions.
The one point on which thert ap
pears to be substantial agreement is
that no very radical departures in
battleship or battle cruiser design has
grown out of the great struggle. The
engagements of heavy craft were too
few to afford any clear-cut lessons, it
was said, and the developments of
these vessels continues to be largely
on theoretical lines.
The last American battleships au
thorized were designed for a displace
ment of 43,000 tons, carrying 12 16
inch guns in their main batteries and
having a speed of 23 knots.
Changes in Cruisers
The six battle cruisers for the navy
authorized in 1916 constitute the most
radical departure in naval design
made 'by any nation, it was held, be
cause of their great speed and heavy
batteries. They were designed for
a speed of 35 knots and to carry eight
16-inch guns.
Some American officers favor devel
opments of a composite battle craft,
combining the speed of a battle
cruiser with the guns and protection
of a battleship. Others, however,
point out that to give a ship both the
speed and the guns and armor would
require a great increase in size, prob
ably to nearly the 60,000 ton displace
ment, the limit once set as the maxi
mum craft that could pass the Panama
canal locks.

Stamping out the bolshevik! menace
at home, he added, was far more im
portant to the country, than that the
government should offer the "affront"
to England of attempting to dictate
to her a policy for Ireland, or should
attempt to dictate to France a policy

THREE
P. D. OLD TIMERS
HE GIFT OF COP
TO V. H. BliOPHY
A complete and delightful surprise
was given William ' H. Brophy. late
major in the Red Cross serrice in
France, but previous to taking up the
nation's serrice in that capacity, iden
tified for more than 30 years with the
Phelps Dodge Mercantile company,
when the "old-timers' among the
store cmnlOTM nrnrl him with a
taring cup as a signification of their
iove ana respect ior mm on me occa
sion of his retirement from the man
agement. Mr. Brophy, to whom the
presentation came entirely unexpect
edly, was deeply touched as he
showed by his demeanor, but even
more by his Toice, when he replied
to the presentation speech made by
Fred W. Freeman, warehouse super
intendent of the company.
Ever since it became known that
Mr. Brophy, who resigned his position
as general manager of the Phelps
Dodge Mercantile company on the
first of the year, would return here
this week, plans have been afoot
among the old-time employes of the
store to make him a present which
would attest their regard for him. A
loving cup was decideJ upon and a
committee, headed by L. G. Jackson,
put in charge of arrangements.
Mrs. Trophy .was let in on the
secret, but no one said a word to the
major, who was induced to go to the
store last night by his wife on the
pioa that F. E. Coles had some im-'
port ant papers in his desk for him.
In the meantime, approximately 50 of!
the employes of the stoie, all of them
old-timers in the organization and
personal friends of Mr Brophy, had!
gathered in the shoe department ofj
the darkened store building. As Mr.'
Brophy entered the building, the lights 1
were flashed on and he was inTiteJ
to step into the shoe department. !
Mr. Freeman, mounting the stair-)
way leading to the second floor of!
the store, made a brief but witty pre
sentation speech, in which he pointed
to tne good fclin? existing between!
the employes and Mr. Brophy through
out the long period when he was at!
the head of the organization. j
Alter receiving the handsome silver!
lovisg cup. lined with gold, upon!
which was engraved "Presented to W.
H. Brophy by the 0!d-Timers of the;
iwsDee District Stores, ISIS." Mr. Bro
phy replied briefly to the speech, ex
pressing his gratitude and saying the
token of regard meant more to him
than any other he ever had received
in his life as it was an, emblem of
affection. -
Later. Mr. BnJJrtiy was prevailed
upon to tell his former associates and
employes the inside details of the
struggle experienced by the American
Red Cross in establishing warehouses
and securing an adequate supply of
labor in France. This he did simplv,
but with a graphic simplicity which
left little to the imagination of his
audience.
The speech was thoroughly enjoyed
by all of those hearing it.
In particular did Major Brophy
dwell upon the affection felt bv the
People of France for the people of
America.
The store employes who participat
ed in the purchase of the cup and
were present at the presentation, to
gether with f.he year of their entrance
into the employment " of the Phelps
Dodge company, follow;

BMED CABLE MADE
SERVICE IMPOSSIBLE
That the reason for the failure of
the central office of the Mountain
States Telephone & Telegraph com
pany to give an alarm of fire prompt
ly when the Central theater burned
Thursday night was that the com
pany's cable, two feet above the roof
of the theater building, was burned
in two by the flames before any one
called central, was the statement of
F. S. Cundiff, manager of the local
exchange.
Mr. Cundiff said:
"The reason for our not handling
the alarm promptly was due to the
delay in reporting it to us until after
our cables had been burned down,
which rendered it impossible for call
ing parties to get the operator. Had
the fire been reported to our operators
Immediately on its inception we could
have given alarm to the various parties
we are supposed to notify. The first
Information that reached our office
regarding this fire was from Mrs. J.
J. Jones at Telephone No. 418, in
Johnson addition, who advised us that
there was a fire in Lowell and she
thought it was in the yards of the
Bisbee Lumber company. The opera
tor immediately called the Marks res
idence in Bisbee and reported this in
formation when she was advised that
the fire was in the Central theater.
She then tried to call the various
numbers in Lowell who represent the
lire department there, but the burned
cable had put these telephones out of
service and rendered it impossible for
her to get the information to the
proper parties. The headquarters of
the Lowell fire department is directly
in front of and within 50 feet of the

Bisbee department has no authoritv
to go outside of the city limits with

without authority, of our own initia

It occurs to me that the time is
ripe for the installation of a fire

entire Warren district, with paid de
partments stationed at Lowell and
Warren and centralized under one
head at Bisbee Only by such co
ordination of forces and fixing of re

recent heavy fire losses would justify
the expense of surh a corapaet and
centralized organization. The tele

INVESTIGATORS TO
PROBE CONDITIONS
I
Headed by Mrs. Alta T. Edgar, a
party of nine investigators of the bu
reau of labor statistics, with head-
auariers in Washington D C arrivori
I in the Warren district last evening
to begin a three weeks' intensive cam
paign in the district to discover exist
ing conditions of labor relative to pay,
the result of which will be transmit
ted to Washington. Similar informa
tion now is being gathered in the prin
cipal industrial centers of the nation
with the idea of being used in future
activities of federal mediation and
war labor boards for regulating and re
adjusting of men's wages.
With Mrs. Edgar are the Misses
Helen List. Frieda Martens, Natalie
Wright, Harriett Monfort. Mariam Fox.
Hazal Liggett, Edith Kingman and
Dorothy Pratt.
The visit of the investigators, each
of whom bears proper credentials to
be displayed if desired, will visit the
homes of the district, ascertaining the
wages received by the head of the
household, the expenditures made
during the past year and similar mat
ters. All items of income or expense
are to be sought for so that a true
conclusion as to conditions can be
arrived at.
Mrs. Edgar said, when interviewed.
I that she and her assistants earnestly
urge me women ot tne anen district
to co-operate with therJ in all possible
ways.
Prior to coming here the invest iga
tors stayed two weeks ia the Bakers
field oil district, seven weeks in Los
Angeles, making similar surveys. Th
entire nation is being toured and sys
tematically catalogued ty other simi
lar parties at the present ' time. Tlie
work of investigating conditions ir
Detroit, Chicago. New York. Cleveland
and Seattle, Wash., already has beeii
completed and the results placed 01

Mrs. Edgar has not yet det-rr.iiuei
where her office will be. Ordinarily
it is either in the pestoffice, or with
the federal employment agent. If ar
rangemetns can be made at neither
place in Bisbee to this end. the War

promised to arrange this detail.
WILLCOX MUDDLE NOW
CENTERS ABOUND HEAD
OF GRAMMAR SCHOOLS
With the return of li. I. McKelligon.
assistant county attorney, and Miss
Elsie Toles, superintendent of coun
ty schools, from Willcox early yester
day, additional light was thrown upon
the school fight which has developed
as a result of L. E. Goodding. former
ly of Bisbee, but now principal of
the grammar school, thrashing three
Boy Scouts for refusal to take off
their hats when the American flag
was raised at the school.
The assistant county attorney and
Miss Toles arrived to find Willoox
much excited as a result of the per
sonal encounter between Lyman Hays,
an attorney, and Mr. Goodding. in
which the latter received a severe
thrashing. However, it was learned
that before their arrival, a warrant
for the arrest of Hays, charged with
assault, had been sworn out by the
mayor of Willcox and the case would
be tried fully in all its phases in
court.
Miss Toles called a public meeting
at which she did what she could to set
tle the trouble in the schools. How
ever, there is said to be strong senti
ment against Goodding which may re
sult in his removal by the school
board.
The crux of the controversy seemed
to lie in whether the principal was
right in insisting that the boys re
move their hats when the flag was
raised instead of giving a military sa
lute as they desired. Whether the
boys were in scout uniforms at the
time was not learned.
The county officers returned here
satisfied that Mr. Goodding had been
misrepresented when the boys said
he had dragged and trampled the flag
as he was described by other' members
of the faculty of the Willcox schools
as being "somewhat of a crank on
patriotism."

Urge Construction of Gila Dam
Senator Devine. of Pinal county, struck a popular chord of appeal in
the state senate Thursday, when he introduced before that body a
resolution addressed to the United States congress urging immediate
construction of the San Carlos dam on the Gila river. The Review
called attention to the importance of this project several days ago.
Feasibility of the San Carlos project was demonstrated in 1909,
when the United States geological survey reports, following careful
investigation and soundings, reported to the secretary of the interior
recommending the dam. In turn the survey report waa referred to con
gress, asking for an immediate appropriation for construction. Congress
took no action. J?J2 Sf
Among the findings of the geological survey were:
That a dam 150 feet high, cculd be constructed for a cost of $1,028,000.
That such a dam would impound 250,000 acre feet of water, reclaim
ing 150,000 acres of land at a cost of $4.40 per acre.
That the annual discharge of the GDa river will supply ample water.
That ample land for reclamation is available under the project.
That lands reclaimed with support S00O families.
That rentals from possible electric power will more than pay the
cost of maintaining the dam.
And, finally, that a dam 100 feet higher is feasible, such reservoir
to cost $2,000,000 and have a storage capacity of 560.000 acre feet.
The entire state of Arizona is interested in the building of the San
Carlos dam. It will mean the addition to the state's resources of another
Talley as rich and as prosperous as the Salt River valley. It will mean
the building of a new city, as large and prosperous and flourishing and
peautiful as Phoenix. It will mean the addition of large sums to the
valuation of the state and lessening of the tax burden by wider distri
bution. " a y-m
But at the present time, it will mean more than all this. It will
mean an ample supply of labor for many men who might otherwise be
out of work, and an ultimate acreage of valuable land easily cultivable
on which soldiers and sailors of the United States may find future
homes, happiness and prosperity.
Every community in the state can assist in the movement to secure
epeedy construction of the dam. Every commercial club and chamber
of commerce, every Rotary, Kiwanis. Luncheon and similar club, every
city council and town assemblage, should add to the memorial intro
duced in the state senate by Senator Devine, one more memorial ad
dressed to the United States congress.
The project is the largest and most feasible in the southwest. It
will mean more to the state as a whole than any similar project now
under consideration. These alone are reasons enough to prompt action.
More Trouble at
Release of 109 conscientious objectors from Leavenworth penitenti
ary, after these men had been reinstated to rank in the army and paid off
In full, has had its reaction, not only on the outside of the prison walls.
Others of the same stamp as those released, remaining within the
prison, have revolted in resentment over the treatment of their former .
cell mates. '
More than 1500 of S570 prisoners in the disciplinary barracks re
fused to leave their ceils oh Thursday, or to perform any labor. Two
thousand signified their willingness to continue the daily routine.
Colonel Sedgwick Rice commandant at the disciplinary barracks
conducted an investigation, and among the grievances of the prisoners,
discovered that "the recent release cf 109 conscientious objectors under
orders from the war department was resented.
When prisoners resent the release and pardoning of other prisoners.
It 13 easy to explain a similar resentment of the civilian and soldier.
Even those convicted of crime and serving sentences in the federal peni
tentiary, hold that those who refused to fight for their country should
not be elevated to the same plane as the men who risked their lives and
endured the hardships of army life in Europe and at home.
Tradition among prisoners tells of how the yegg looks with disgust
on the less daring and accomplished burglar. But tradition and prison
records do not disclose an incident of a yeggman resenting the release
of a common burglar. A new record has been written into prison tra
dition, and even the petty convict has come to realize there are some
prisoners who are not deserving of release and reinstatement with
full pay. i
The Costly Mr. Burleson
Mr. Eurleson's coddling with the telephone rates bids fair to cost
the country some millions of dollars in the course of the next year. It
has disorganized the relations between the telephone companies and
the public utility commissioners, establishing a condition of warfare.
And by reason of its awful example, it is taking the question of public
ownership of industries out of the list of possible political issues.
We do not know what more Mr. Furleson could do in the way of
mussing things up.
But we know it is high time that something were done about the
meddling. Probably no other business in the country could be reduced to
a chaos faster than the telephone business if on all sides it were beset
by hostility. For all of its experience with carping and complaining,
with uncomfortable laws and disturbing legislation, with orders of com
missioners and courts, the industry is not prepared to take on a country
wide quarrel whose intensity grows hourly and whose nature shows
increased vindictivenes3. XIr. Burleson is not competent to serve both
as a financial helper and spiritual protector. If lie acts true to political
form, he will quit the game when matters become too warm for him and
leave it for the telephone companies to get out of the hole into which he
put them the best way they can. .
If the telephone corporations would announce that they would leave
the adjustment of rates to the duly qualified public utilities commissions,
public resentment would be modified at once Burleson would doubtless
be grateful and the postmaster general, before promulgating another
order, would take the time to learn just what it was he was about to do.
Another way out does not appear. Toledo Blade.
Aesthetic Legislators
We can readily picture the horror and grief on the faces of the
highbrow, cultured, educated member of the legislature when one of
their colleagues referred to Arizona pioneers as "devil-may-care.
We can see hands raised in horror. We can hear voices raised
in protest. We can call np a picture of one of these cultured members
rising to his feet to reply that the words were "cactus bars set in a
plate of diamonds."
On the other side, we see the faces of the low-brows wreathed in
smiles as they hear their high-brow friends rise to an occasion which de
mands a defense of the men and women who made Arizona a flowering
state. 1 -
And in the meanwhile we can picture the business of the state
and of the legislature waiting on this flow of oratory.
Surely "devil-may-care" comes home to roost when legislators bandy
4 words and phrases over ornate resolutions, while real business for real
workers to accomplish waits on the calendar.
Some Blood Relationship
We always knew there was some close relationship between the
early American Apache and the Paris Apache they both enjoy scalping
Yankees, reports from France disclose.

SENATE BILL AIMSfATTORNEY GENERAL
TO RILL ATTEMPTS SAYS COMMISSION
OF SYNDACALISTSlHAY demand probe
(By Keviw leased Wire
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 21. Syndical
ism is classed as a felony and punish
ment is provided for it even more
drastic than that outlined in the sabo
tage bill of the special war session
in a measure introduced in the house
today by Representative Galbraith of
Maricopa. Penalties for conviction un
der the bill are fixed at a term of im
prisonment not to exceed ten years,
or a fine, of not more than $5000. or
both. It is provided further that a
fine of not to exceed $500, imprison
ment for not longer than one year, or
both would be visited on any person
or persons convicted of renting a
meeting place for the spread of crim
inal syndicalism's propaganda.
The bill defines the evil which, it
proposes to check as follows:
' Criminal syndicalism is the teach
ing, advocating or committing, or at
tempting to commit criminal acts,
sabotage, violence, or acts or meth
ods of terrorism or intimidation for
the purpose or as a means of accomp
lishing industrial or political reforms."
Regulate Cotton Gins
Discussion in the senate today on
the bill regulating the office of the
sealer of weights and measures took a
turn which was assumed by spectators
to indicate that a number of senators
favored placing this office under the
state corporation commission. It was
freely stated in the lobbies that an
effort would be made to bring cotton
gins within the state under the juris
diction of the corporation commission.
On motion of Senator Windsor the
bill was sent back to tbe committee.
Speaking to the bill, Senator Winsor
of Yuma, said that the question of
weights and measures was one that af
fected his county seriously and par
ticularly in the matter of cotton gins.
He favored sending the bill back to
committee with instructions to redraft
it, placing the office of sealer of
weights and measures within the cor
poration commission, giving that body
full charge of it.
Senator Winsor declared that the
corporation commission had informed
that committee that it was in a posi
tion to handle the work of the office
by adding one clerk to the commis
sion's staff.
Senator Wilkinson of Maricopa, also
favored placing the cotton gins under
the corporation commission.
County Classification ,
President Jones of the senate, In
troduced senate bill 45 to amend the
county classification bill in the mat
ter of salaries of members of the
boards oftsupervisors and deputy coun
ty officials in counties of the first
class, those having an assessed valua
tion of $50,000,000 or more.
Under the provisions of this mea
sure the salary of the chairman- of the
board of supervisors would be in
creased from $1500 to $3000 and the
salaries cf other members of the board
from $1200 to $2400. with the stipula
tion that the supervisors should main
tain office hours similar to those of
other county officials.
The salary of assistant county at
torney in counties of the first class
would be increased from $2000 to
$2400 and the salaries of all the as
sistant county officials from $1S00 to
$2100.
Slander Measure
Mrs. Hayward of Cochise county,
introduced a bill prescribing a penalty
for and describing slander. A feature
of the bill is that only in certain
specified cases may the truth of a
slanderous statement be set up as a
defense. At present there is no statute
in Arizona covering slander.
House bill 5S provides an emergency
appropriation of $6000 for clerical
work for the present fiscal year in
the office of the superintendent of
public health.
House bill 60 would amend the state
land laws enacted at the second spe
cial session of the second legislature.
House bill 62 makes provision for
an appropriation of $2550.50 to pay
drug bills contracted by the Northern
Arizona Normal school during the in
fluenza epidemic last fall.
HOUSE WOULD GIVE
BOOKS TO SCHOOLS
Rv Rfvirw T.asl Wire
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 31. The pro
posal to furnish copies of the eight
volumes of Farish's history of Arizona
to all the public schools and libraries
in the state, known as house concur
rent resolution 3, was today adopted
and sent to the senate, where it was
read and laid over for one day.
The resolution, drawn in ornate
language, met with some opposition
and demanded considerable explain
ing. The pioneers of Arizona were de
scribed in the resolution as "devil-may-care"
which phrase drew stren
uous objection from Representative
Coleman of Pinal, who described the
words a3 "cactus burs set in a plate of
diamonds. Other members, however,
thought the phrase highly appropriate
and they were retained.
Representative Delbridge of Cochise
was inclined to think that some prin
ter might have an interest in the reso
lution beyond its educational features.
He called attention to the fact that
the proposal specified eight volumes
is to be sent to 500 schools, which
meant 4000 volumes.
In answer to this objection, the ex
planation came from Speaker Lines
that the books already had been print
ed and paid for and that the resolu
tion provided only for their distribu
tion. PHOENIX WEATHER.

secretary of state $200 and the filing
of a bond for $5000 any person may
obtain a broker's license.
"It is provided that the state bank
examiner may prescribe the manner
in which records of brokers may be
kept and. may make examination of
the financial conditions of brokers
operating in the state. The result of
this law "is that brokers assume that
they have authority to sell the securi
ties of any company in any amount,
under any terms and conditions with
out obtaining a permit under the in
vestment company laws.
"An investment company may ob
tain a permit to sell its securities for,
say 10 cents per share with a commis
sion limited to 20 per cent and may
thereafter sell all of its stock author
ized to be sold in the permit to a
broker, who, in turn, may sell it to the
public at any price he can obtain for
it. Many transactions have so been
handled.
"We have had instances in which
foreign companies appeared Vfore the
commission with an application to sell
stock and it has been denied or con
demned, upon which they immediately
have gone to brokers offering stock
of ' companies of very questionable
value.
"We urge a careful review of our in
vestment company law with a view to
making it possible for the commission
to more thoroughly safeguard the in-1
terests of the investing public without. !
however, hampering legitimate devel
opment."

i erable buying took place owing to an-
i nouncement that the entente block-
ade had been lifted completely except
in the case of Germany and that
6.000.000 bushels of breadstuffs a
month would be allowed to go to that
country hereafter. Soon, however, de
cided weakness set in as a result of
advices that the end of the. port
strike at Buenos Aires was at hand.
Inasmuch as the strike had been cur
tailing shipments from Argentina,
prices here broke sharply. Covering
by shorts led to subsequent rallies,
but at the last the market was bare
of support. Meanwhile, shelters were
said to be again at work and a more
liberal crop movement in prospect.
Oats sympathized with the weak
ness of corn. Most of the trade was
local. -
Excessive offerings of hogs carried
down provisions, and so likewise did
the lower trend of grain. Covering
by shorts was only in part an off
