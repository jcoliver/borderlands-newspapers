Kegs Sent Out Without Rev

tor Refuses to Sell Them
Beverage Containing 24 per
Cent Alcohol Made in Ef
fort to Test Regulations
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, April 18. Brewers of
the New York district took action to
day to speed court decisions of their
claim that beer of 2 3-4 per cenO alco
holic content may be produced with
out violating the food conservation
regulations, when two or their number
began distribution of a brew of the
strength specified in barrels bearing
labels describing it as a non-intoxicat-ine
beveraee.
The kegs, sent out without revenue
atamps, which the collector had re
fused, carried tags announcing that
sums equivalent to the cost of the
stamps had been deposited in banks to
await the claim of the government
Attorneys for the brewers, who ad
vised their action, declared that other
manufacturers in New York and else
where throughout the country, also
would begin distributing.
Made Since December 1
Th beer shipped here from the
Hoffman & Gambrinus breweries, had
been manufactured since December 1,
when by presidential proclamation,
use of grains for .brewing" was pro
hibited, to be modified early this year
by permission to make non-intoxicating,
or "near beer," which the revenue
department classified as containing
less than one-half of 1 pen cent alco
holic content.
The Hoffman breweries notified the
internal revenue collector early this
week of their intention to resume dis
tribution of the 2 3-4 per cent product.
This was the standard during the
greater part of America's participa
tion in the war, under the food regula
tions. - . 4 ,
When application .for; revenue
stamps was denied, ' the brewers an
nounced their intention of tendering
payment to the authorities." When this
was refused it was decided' by the
Hoffman and also the Gambrinus con
cerns to deliver goods without stamps,
and epecial labels prepared on order
of Elihu Root and William D. Guthrie,
counsel for the brewers of the coun
try, were attached to the barrels. The
labels contained the following legend:
" Labels on Kegs
"Non-intoxicating beer, containing
not to exceed 2 3-4 per cent of alcohol
by weight.
"The internal revenue tax imposed
by section 608 of the act of congress
of February 24, 1919, of $6 for every
barrel containing not more than 32
gallons has leen duly tendered to the
collector of internal revenue for the
district of and upon
his refusal to receive the tax and Is
sue the customary stamps, the full
amount of the tax was deposited to
his credit with bank
thus keeping the tender good. If any
attempt be made to seize the beer,
telephone or telegraph at once to un
dersized," and the name of the brew,
er follows.
: The text of labels was contained in
an opinion given to Christian W. Eei
gnnspan, president of the United
States Brewers' association by Messrs.
Root and Guthrie. This opinion, writ
ten when the brewers declared the
collector had "threatened" to refuse is
suance of stamps, advised the proce
dure begun by the Hoffman and Gam
brinus companies. '
WASHINGTON, April 18. In ab
sence of Internal Revenue Commis
sioner Roper, officials of the revenue
bureau tonight would not predict what
action might be taken in the case of
the New York brewers, who today
started distribution of beer containing
2 3-4 per cent alcohol, claiming it to
be non-Intoxicating under existing
laws and regulations. The only action
of the bureau so far has been to re
fuse to authorize the sale of revenue
'stamps to brewers desiring to make
beer with this alcoholic content, since
regulations place at one-half of 1 per
cent the maximum alcoholic content
for non-intoxicating beverages of any
kind.

(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, April 18 Fire which
started today in the plant of the Union
Oil company of .Arizona here caused a
loss estimated tonight at $110,000,
completely destroying the oil com
pany's plant and that of the Finnag
& Brown Hide firm nearby, damagou
the Santa Fe stockyards and partly
burned two rajlroad tank cars. The
explosion of a 20,000.' gallon tank of
basoline blew .one' end of the tank
north and the other south, the former
wrecking a house 200 yards away and
the latter smashing an automobile 300
yards distant."
Excepting two firemen overcome by
the heat no one was injured. The fire
department has not yet definitely es
tablished the cause of the blaze. One
report was to the effect that it origin
ated when a tank truck loading gaso
line at the plant backfired, while em
ployes of the plant lay it to a spark of
static electricity.
In addition to losing its entire Phoe
nix plant, the Union Oil company also
lost most of Its local records, as well
as thousands of gallons of oil and
gasoline.
C. V. Beach, district sales manager
fe rthe company, said it was impos
sible to estimate how much oil and
gasoline went up in flames, as the
stock varied from day to day. The
plant's capacity, he stated, was in the
neighborhood of 90,000 gallons and
was largely filled. The oil company
loss was placed by Beach at $100,000.

Allied Recognition of Omsk
Government Expected, to
Follow Signing- of Peace
Reds Rapidly Losing Ground
as Food Supplies Arrive
for the Peasant Population
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 18. Great in
terest has been aroused in diplomatic
and government circles, it was learned
today, by private advices from London
stating that Great Britain, France and
Italy and the United State propose to
recognize the Omsk government as
the de facto government of non
bolsheviki Russia as soon as the peace
treaty is signed and the details inci
dent to it have been concluded.
This proposed solution of the Rus
sian problem is? said in these private
advices ,to t have been, intimated Py
Premier Lloyd George in discussion
of the situation with British and Rus
sian leaders in London. Some of
ficials here, after reading the advices,
suggested that portions of the address,
of the British premier in the house-of
commons this week could be taken as
indicating that the associated powers
had agreed to recognize the Omsk gov
ernment. President Wilson, it was learned
authoritatively today, has information
that an appearance of bolshevik!
strength is now being made through
the concentration of the armed forces
at single points at the sacrifice of the
rest of Russia. The president also
has been informed, it was said, that
bolshevism rapidly is losing ground
among the peasant class and with the
receipt of the food supplies which the
associated governments have decided
to furnish the movement will quickly
collapse.
The Paris conferees have been kept
advised of the situation in Siberia
where the Om3k government generally
has been successful despite local trou
bles in the eastern portion, officials
said. The London advices are said to
point out that the stability of all sec
tions of non-European Russia under
the control of non-bolshevists had led
to the decision to recognize the Omsk
government as de facto.
Distinct Improvement in the finan
cial situation in Siberia is indicated in
a cablegram received by the Russian
embassy from the ministry of foreign
affairs in Omsk. The cablegram, made
public today, asserts that while the
ready money in state credit institu
tions last July 1 amounted to only
212,000,000 rubles, at present the ready
money in these institutions amounts
to a billion and a half rubles. Pay
ments of taxes and customs are said
to have been increased more than 12
times since the Omsk government
came into existence.

would be able to sail homeward May
20, and possibly a little earlier May

The belief was expressed that the
president would call an extra session

Present indications are that the

reaching the delegates tend to show
that the Germans are not planning
to take up time and delay the signing
of the treaty, as they desire a settle

PARIS, April IS. (By. the Associat
ed Press.) The allied and associated
powers ar eprepared to aid in the re
lief of Russia with foodstuffs, medi
cal supplies and other necessities,
provided there is a cessation of hos
tilities "within defnite lines in the
territory of Russia." This fact be
came known today in correspondence
which has passed between Dr. Frldt
jof Nansen, head of the commission
appointed to feed Russia, and Presi
dent Wilson and Premiers Clemen
ceau, Lloyd George and Orlando.
Dr. Nansen in his appeal to the
council of four for aid in bringing
relief to Russia, where he said thou
sands of. persons were dying monthly
from sheer starvation and diswas j.
suggested a neutral and "purely hu
manitarian committee" for the pur
pose. The council of four in reply
recognized with sympathy the situa
tion in Russia, and gave assurance of
its readiness to 4 succor the strcken
people of Russia along the lines that
Belgium was fed and ministered to,
but with the fundamental proposition
that a cessation of hostilities be
brought about.
Premier Clemenceau withheld his
approval of the proposition temporal
ly, but added his signature today to
those of Premiers Orlando and Lloyd
George pnd President Wilson, thus
virtually assuring the Immediate
economic relief 'of sovet Russia, as
Lenine is known to be willing to ac
cept food on the conditions outlined
by Dr. Nansen, and discussed with
the bolsheviki by various neutral lep
resentatives at Mo3ow.
While the plan is divorced from
politics, it is generally believed bv
the entente powers that it eventually
will restore order and enable Russia
to banish chaoe.

But the old-fashioned mustard-plaster

without the blister.
Musterole does it. It is a clean, white
ointment, made with oil of mustard. It is
scientifically prepared, so that it works
wonders, and yet does not blister the
tenderest skin.
Just massage Musterole in with the finger-tips
gently. See how quickly it brings
relief how ipeedily the pain disappears.
Use Musterole for sore throat, bron

neuralgia, headache, congestion, pleurisy,
rheumatism, lumbago, pains and aches of

Mr. Barnes will direct the handling
ot the entire 1919 wheat crop and will

propriated by congress to take care
of the crop under the government
guarantee price. He was selected ror

recommendation of Herbert Hoover.
; In addition to the administration of
:?1.000,000,000 lurid, Mr. Barnes will
remain president of the 5130,000.000
goveniment grain corporation, which.
'will continue to function as the com

President Wilson said in his cable
, to Mr. Barnes, requesting him to be
come wheat director:
( "Your responsibility will be directly
to myself after Mr. Hoover's retire
ment as chairman of the grain cor
poration on July 1. The experience
which you have gained and the suc
cess which woa have attained in hand
ling the wheat and cereal crops un
der the food administration has been
so generally recognized by expressions
from the different sections of the
country that I feel it would be a na
tional loss if we could not have your
tion of this most imyportantoinnninn
service continued until the comple
tion of this most important national
: undertaking.
"I should like to take this occasion
jto express the high appreciation and
gratitude which I have for the services
performed not only by yourself but
"by the directors, vice-presidents and
other members of the grain corpora
tion. The services which these gen
tlemen have given in a time of nation
al emergency, the skill and integrity
with which they have carried out so
difficult an economic undertaking, is
one which I am sure the whole of our
people must appreciate. I am in hopes
that these gentlemen will remain with
you in this service and I would be
glad If you would convey to each of
them my personal gratitude for the ex
hibition of sacrifice and willingness to
.national service which is so promising
'to the future welfare of our people."
The executives of the grain corpora
tion in the 14 zones into which the
United States has been divided for ad
ministrative purposes will hold a
meeting in New York Wednesday, at
which the personnel of the grain cor
poration for the coming year will be
determined upon.

NEW YORK. April . IS. The Jap

two American missionaries of a con

considerate method of dealing' whh
the matter and has not . arrester!
them," according to an official cable
message from Tokio, made public to
day by Chonosuke Yada, Japanese
consul general in New York. '
The cablegram denied reports that
at Pinkyang "a Japanese soldier
struck an American lady missionary
with the butt end of his gun' 'or that
at Nobum-Kawa "our soldiers search
ed the home of an American mission
ary and forced their way into the

vestigation of the Pingyang incident,
the message showed "the report orig
inated from the action of a Japanese
soldier trying to force back the pas
sage of a crowd -with Tiis gun held
horibontally."
Asserting that the riots have been
sponsored by "one Son, Heiki, who is
at the head of a cult called Tendo
Kyo (heavenly 'way )and harbors a
mutinous ambition of bringing about
a coup d'etat, the message continued:
"It is a matter of exceeding re

ANTI-GERMAN TRIPLE
ALLIANCE IS PLANNED
PARIS, April 18. An anti-German
triple alliance giving France, Belgium
and the grand duchy of Luxemburg
mastery in the coal and iron trade will
probably be the outcome of a study
of economical questions rising from
the war. The study has been con
ducted by a, committee appointed in
Luxemburg. An- economical alliance
pt this kind would control 55,000,000
tons of coal and 512.500,000 tons of
steel annually, and place Germany at
the mercy of the allies.

The Root of
Now that the war is over, and as we count another milestone on the
highway of our national life towared truer democracy, we can see that
all our progress is the result of quiet, orderly-though and discussion of
our public affairs.
That each time that our democracy has been threatened, within
or without, it has been the ill advised action that comes from feeling,
emotions, predominating thought within ourselves or our enemies.
That the only threatening cloud now on the horizon of our national
life, small as it may be, is from a source that precludes all factors of
reason. . .
The foundation of all our democracy is order and system.
Our colonial forefathers learned order and system from the discussion
of their social, business and political affairs, long before the American
Revolution they practiced it in town meetings.
They learned to make compromises.
They learned that progress, reform, doea not come as a will or ideal
of one that the might of one or of a few does not make the right
of ail.
Our Colonial forefathers carried the spirit of quiet, orderly discus
sion to the framing of the Declaartion of Independence, later to that
very orderly and systematic document, the Constitution of the United
States; and after the Revolution this habit of quiet, orderly discussion
proved the training for self-government, one generation unto another in
the national life which has followed.'
The lesson frcm this for all of us of this generation, and particularly
young men and women, is that we should pursue the practice of quiet,
orderly discussion as individuals the practice that has been found work
able in the) upbuilding of this nation, that we may become strong as
individuals and stronger as a cation.
That every young man and woman should make the joining and
participation in an organization a part of his or her education to citi
zenship. '
Begin with the school organization, follow it with the business
or social organization the church, the lodge, the club any. that have
a purpose beyond themselves.
Learn from the discussion of their affairs; learn from a participa
tion in the discussions always quietly, with thought rather than feeling.
Learn to compromise. . ,
Learn that those who will not compromise are the real obstruc
tionists. v
Learn that the strongest men and women in these organizations
the leaders of them are those who present truth with order and system,
quietly with the most thought and the least feeling.
Observe that feeling, emotion, loudness of speech, and, above all,
exhibition of temper, are never proof of the soundness of belief.
Learn that those ho argue with the most feeling and temper have
their own vanity at heart, rather than the good of the cause.
That while people are often carried away on a wave of emotional
oratory, yet it is never of permanent conviction.
That while an individual may be right as against an ' organization,
that even a whole people may be wrong at times, yet it is only the pro-
cess by which they finally get right.
Learn that permanent reforms come by slow and orderly courses,
that they are disturbed and retarded by feeling and force; that they come,
one process on another, quietly, unnoticed, naturally, like the changing
seasons of the year winter into spring, spring into summer; summer
into fall "
Tom Thumbs
An 8-yeai-old girl 6 feet tall! Myrtle Margold of Maybank, Texas.
She has that rarest of diseases giantism.
Her growth can be checked only by a delicate operation removing
the pituitary gland, attached to the brain. It is this tiny gland that de
termines your height and weight. Should it become diseased, the body
may grow a foot a month.
Will future scientists discover how to manipulate the pituitary gland
at will, so that our descendants can be tall or short as they please?
Not a wild theory, say the doctors, in view of recent sensational dis
coveries concerning the effect on man's stature of hormones, chemical
extractions from the pituitary gland3 of animals.
M. Ilenrion estimated that Eve was 118 feet 9 inches tall. If Adam
was like us, he had to climb 10 flights of stairs to kiss her.
Other scientists disagree claim that man haa always been his pres
ent size. Thank man's pituitary gland for that. Century after century
it remains normal. Diseases of it are rare.
A dwarf or giant is the lone exception in millions.
Old European cities have statues of legendary giant inhabitants of
'the past. In Douai, one of Gayant, reputed to stand22 feet in his
socks. Antwerp had Mr. Antigonus, 40 feet tall. London has effigies
in the Guildhall, of Gog and Magog, 14-foot giants who once terrorized
the southwestern coast.
All these are mythical.
The tallest man in ''history about whom we have reliable "figures
was Machnow, a nine-foot-three Russian from Charkow, who exhibited
In London in 1905. Machnow had other things wrong with his archi
tecture. His hands measured two feet from wrist to tip of index finger.
An operation on his brain in childhood would have kept him normal.
The smallest man in authentic history was Philetas, intellectual valet
of Ptolmy Philadelphus, Egyptian king. So tiny was Philetas, according
to historians of his day, that he had to wear great leaden shoes to keep
the wind from blowing him away. Maybe the historians had a sense of
humot.
Only 18 inches tall was Jeffery Hudson, son of a huge butcher at
Oakham, Rutlandshire, England. At a dinner given to Charles I this
midget was served in a pie. Adopted by the king, he lived down his
size became known as "Strenuous Jeffery," was a captain of cavalry and
fought two duels. Little men,' walk proudly.
All these were men suffering from disease of the pituitary gland
in the brain.
Climates appear to affect the gland. Scotland averages taller than
any other race. Above all the Japanese are most sensitive about their
short stature. Medical science may correct this in time turn them
into a race of six-footers.
Wondefrul Is the body you realize it when you ponder that a gland
small as a cherry determines your height and weight.
How Parents Feel
Maybe you noticed that all the trouble with bad boys in your neigh
borhood comes from the children of other people.
We have. ,
Everybdy has noticed that time and again.
Now you and we know that our teoy never hung a tat in the wood
shed until that horrid Jones boy contaminated him. 4
And our boy never, threw a rock at a window' in his life; that is
we don't believe he did, although some crabbed grouches have complained
about him but they must have been mistaken.
Our boy and our girl were raised right; they had the advantage
of stern parential discipline, and no matter in what company they
are they will be found in no mischief.
' Or If they are, it will be because some tou of evil corrupted them.
But other folks'- kids: honest to goodness thy. wife says that she
doesn't know what she u going to do, what with all the strange faini-

LOWER COURT REVERSED
PHOENIX, April 18. A half dozen
opinions were handed down by the su
preme court yesterday afternoon,
among tnem one in the case of the
Arizona Eastern Railroad company,
appellant, against J. A. Matthews, an
pellee, Maricopa county, reversing the
opinion of the lower court awarding
the appellee 53000 for personal injury
The appellee was an employe of the
appellant. His injury was sustained
in falling' into a pit that had been dug
for a pair of scales, the work not be
ing finished on a certain night. The
pit was left uncovered, and the plain
tiff appellee, though using care and
diligence, fell into it.
There were 28 assignments of error,
but the supreme court found it neces
sary to consider only one, the failure
of the court to instruct a verdict in
favor of the defendanj on the ground
that the plaintiff had elected to stand
on the employers' liability act. As he
was a bill clerk and his duties were
purely clerical, it was the contention
of the defendant that he could not re
cover under an act that .was intended
only for the protection of those en
gaged in hazardous occupations. That
view was sustained by the appellate
court.
GRAND JURY PROBES I. W. W.
PHOENIX, April 18. Final dis
charge of the federal grand jury was
ordered yesterday afternoon by Judge
Sawtelle, immediately following the
last report of that body. The report
reads as follows:
"We, the grand jury of the United
States for the April, 1919, term of the
United States district court for the
district of Arizona, beg leave to submit
this, our final report, tor your deliber
ation. "We have examined into 30 cases
and found 23 true bills, ignored three
and recommended the reference of
four cases to the next grand jury.
"In addition thereto, we have con
ducted a thorough investigation into
the I. W. W. activities in the county
of Maricopa and find that all of the
officers of the United States in the
district of Arizona have been diligent
in their efforts to discover violations
of the laws of the United States by
the I. W. W.
100 APPLY FOR LAND
PHOENIX, April 18. More than 100
applications for lease of to exceed one
section of state land to one person, or
firm, under the provisions of the land
lease law, No. 60, have been receiver
by the land department.
No action has been taken on them,
and the matter will be brought to the
attention of ihe state land board at
their meeting today. This law is one
of several emergency measures passed
by the recent legislature and not
signed by the governor, and which the
attorney general has declared invalid
on that account.
That a test of some sort on the land
law is coming is regarded as certain
among those informed on what is go
ing on at the capitaol. Whether the
land board will deny the applications,
and be mandamused by the applicants,
or whether they will grant them anu
be enjoined by the opponents of the
bill remains to be seen. But it is re
garded as certain that a test is soon to
be made to finally determine in the
courts whether the bill is now a law.
Meanwhile, the opponent of the
measure are busy, and it is rumored
that they will have referendum peti
tions on the .street today or tomor-
how, thus heading off the possibility
o fthe measure becoming a law at the
end of 90 days.
KILLED IN MINE ACCIDENT
MIAMI, April 18.D. C. Hoover, a
well known Miami miner, was killed
n a mine accident at the Inspiration
mine late Wednesday afternoon. The
deceased was caught beneath a mass
of rock and was probably smothered
to death. The body of the deceased is
being held at the Miami undertaking
parlors pending the receipt Of woru
from his brother, J. W. Hoover of
North Carolina.
Hoover was about 35 years old
and had been a resident of the Mi
ami district for the past five years.
He was the proprietor of the Hoover
rooming house in Red Springs can
yon and is said to have owned con
siderable property in and around Mi
ami. OATMAN BROKER DISAPPEARS
OATMAN, April 18. Ernest Long,
Oatman broker, who disappeared last
Saturday, has as yet not been heard
from. It was reported that he passed
through Yucca and Needles. Friends
of the missing broker believe that his
mind had become deranged over busi
ness worries and personal affairs. It
is understood that he took practically
no money with him. having made a de
posit the same day of his disappear
ance and having left money in his
desk. The condition of his business
affairs will be determined when the
receiver lists his assets.
COLORADO BRIDGE PLAN FAILS
PHOENIX, April 18. The prospects
for a new bridge across the Colorado
river at Parker seem to have gone
glimmerin:;, for the present at least,
California, which was to have borne
one-third of the expense of ?90,000,
having failed to become very enthus
iastic over the matter. A telegram
received by Governor Campbell this
morning from Governor Stephens of
the coast ttate cov.lained the informa
tion that the powers that be had deem-
lies moving into the neighborhood, and all sorts of new boys yelling
over the back fence for Willie.
Auotheq thing we don't understand is why our children don't get
better marks at school.
We know they are bright and well mannered; but somehow they
only get F and G on deportment, and an occasional E on scholarship.
Probably the teacher .doesn't know her business. 4
if we didn't have other folks' children to contend with, aud had
really able teachers, that understood our children, it would be a much
easier task to
"Willie! Willie, you hear me? You quit slapping little sister lieht
this minute; you come right into the house, young man, or I'll attend
to you."
As we vere baying, the 111 bred, yes even, tough, children of your
neighbors is what makes city life so unfortunate tor pareuts.
ed it inadvisable to press the demand
for such an appropriation at the pres
ent moment, and suggested that, as a
make-shift, the Santa Fe railroad
bridge at Parker be planked at the ex
pense of the local communities and
that vehicles use this method of get
ting across the river until such timeisioh, therefore, is inevitable that the'
1 11 : f J .... .V. 1 . 1 . i nnlfnir .1 r ..n .4 ' - . I f .t
o im. v.ai,iui ii la auiuui lues dis
posed to chip in for their share of the
new crossing. Governor Campbell
will make an effort to have the local
authorities act on the planking sugges
tion, as the need for a crossing there
is most acute.
The original plan for the, bridge at
Parker called for appropriations of
?30,000 each from the states of Ari
zona and California and the depart
ment of the interior. Arizona and the
federal department have already signi
fied their willingness to make the
necessary appropriation, and the mat
ter had hung fire pending a decision
of the California authorities on the
matter. The wire of this morning,
therefore, would seem to cast a wet
blanket over the whole project, and it
is quite likely that highway traffic
will have to he routed over the rail
road structure for the next year or so
at least.
ROADS IN GOOD SHAPE
PHOENIX, April 18. Harry Locke,
publisher of the Locke series of auto
mobile route books, and one of the
foremost highway experts in the
southwest; is in Phoenix and is confer
ring with Chamber of commerce of
ficials in regard to certain automo
bile activities in which that organiza
tion is interested.
Cocke, who made the trip overlanc
from Los Angeles, is authority for the
statement that the roads between
Phoenix and the coast are in fairly
good condition. He states, however,
that at the present time, and in fact
up until about May 10, the most satis
factory route to Los Angeles from this
city will be that which passes through
Wickenburg, Salome, Vicksburg,
Quartzsite, Ebrenberg, Blythe. Mecca
and Riverside. This is the route trav
ersed by Locke and he can presonally
assure travelers that little or no dif
ficulty will be encountered at any
point at this season if this route is
used.
The distance over this road is about
430 miles, this being 102 miles shorter
than the Parker route and 80 miles
shorter than the Yuma-San Diego
route!
This route, accerding to Locke, will
not be available after May 10, as that
is the date on which the summer over
flow of the Colorado river usually sets
in, and the California side of the
stream is many miles in width until
about September 1.
DOLLAR MILE FOR SPEEDERS
GLOBE. April 18. One dollar pet
mile is the new rate Judge Moore has
set for speeding motorists, at least
L. R. Wilson, charged with soeedine
down Broad street, drew the sum of
$25 after expert autoists testified he
was traveling at the rate of 25 per.
SOLONS CLAIM REFUSED
PHOENIX, April 18. The supreme
court today handed down its deci
sion in the case of the County of
Freenlee, appellant, vs. Frank B.
Laine, appellee, an appeal from the
Superior court of Greenlee county,
Hon. A. G. McAlister, judge. The
judgment of the lower court was re
versed.
This is a suit for back: salary filed
by the judge of the Superior court or
Greenlee county for increased sal
ary which he claimed was due him
under the provisions of chapter 61,
session laws of 1917, which law in-
cerased the amounts of the salaries
of the governor from $4,000 to $6,500
and the attorney general from $2,500
to $4000 per annum. The salaries of
some of the judges of the Superior
courts were slightly increased, that
of Judge Laine, the plaintiff and ap
pellee in this case, being increased
from $3,500 to $4,000 per annum.
Claim for the increased salary hav
ing been presented by the plaintiff
and disallowed by the board of su
pervisors, suit was filed against the
county for the increased amount of
the judge's salary for the months of
March to December, 1917, and Jan
uary , 1918, inclusive.
The supreme court, in its decision,
declares that the only point raised in
the case is a sto the power of the
legislature to increase the salary of
appellee during his term of office, and
involves an examination of section 17,
article 4, of the constitution, read
ing: "The legislature shall never grant
any extra compensation to any pub
lic officer, agent, servant or contrac
tor after the services shall have been
rendered or the contract entered into,
nor shall the compensation of any
public officer be increased or dimin
ished during his term of office."
And section 24 article 6, reading:
"No change made by the legisla
ture in the number of judges shall
wor kthe demoval of any judge from
office; and no judge's salary shall be
reduced during the term of office for!
which he was elected." i
It was the contention of the plain-
tiff-appellant that taking these twol
sections together they could be con-1
strued to mean that the legislature)
had the power to increase the sal-j
aries of Superior court judges during!
their terms of office. I
The Supreme court in its decision!
today finds nothing conflicting or an-
ISSjS3
general provision applying to all pub -
lie offices, and that section 24 is mere-j PARIS, April 18. A cry of protest
ly a safeguard to protect judge's j has arisen in the chamber of deputies
against decrease of salary. In view ofi because military authorities have
the provisions of section 17, the su-jbeen taking photographs and fingar
preme court savg that to assume an print of all soldiers as they are de

feet that a judge's salary might be; d.emobiiized soldier must not be treat

cision says in part: "The conclu -

constitution applies to all public offi -

ing is not and never was intended to
be changed by the expressions con
tained in section 24. but on the con
trary the two sections were inserted
for a different object. They not only
harmonize, but support each other.

officers elected theerafter. The leg
islature may increase or diminish sal
aries of public officers. There is no
prohibition in the constitution against
their doing so. The limitation is
against the increasing or deceasing; fined plct has been woven a perplex.
of a public officers salary during his ing web of baffling clues and entic
term of office, or the term for which ing problems that keep the spectator
he was elected. The injunction
against the changing of the compen
sation would, however, postpone the
operation of chapter 61, laws of 1917,
until after the expiration of appel
lee's terra."
The decision in this case is of more
than passing interest in view of its
probable effect on other ba.ck salary
cases now pending, including the suit
of former Governor Hunt to recover
back salary alleged to be due him.
Munt Djougnt suit against the state
auditor in the superior court of Mar
icopa for back salary alleged to be
due him under the provisions of chap
ter 61, laws of 1917, above referred
to, and in the lower court he re
ceived judgment in the amount of
$4,529.51. The state auditor appealer
the case and it will probably be ar-l
gued in the Supreme court some time
next month.
FRENCH MINERS TO
SEEK SHORTER DAY
PARIS, April 18. French miners
are now determined to gain an eight-
hour day and a 50 per cent increase in
wages. They propose a 'union with'
transport workers and British miners
and transport workers to gain their
demands.

('.:- Kc-vlf-w i.ensi'd AVire)
WASHINGTON, April IS. The I
Sunday observance issue raised by
protest of churches and ministers' in
a number of cities against, flying cir
cuses and exhibiton of moving pic-
Jtures-in connection with the Victory
lean, was met today by the . treasury
in a decision 10 leave the question' to
each community affected. Frank R.
Wilson, di;ector of loan publicity,
telegraphed the loan charman of each
community where the flying circuses
of aviators are scheduled to appear
011 Sunday, saying it was Secretary
Glass' belief that the dates should be
abandoned, but that the trains bearing
the airplanes and crews wiuld be run
on schedule and the exhibitions
would be held if ail interests of a
community agreed.
Cities Protest
In thif connection, Butte, Mont.,
and Walla Walla, Washn., were two
' cities which deluged the treasury to
j day with telegrams protesting against
jany abandonment of air performances
in inose places, hreaciiers of Walla
Walla gave up their-objections when
it was learned the demonstrations
were to be held in the afternoon and
not during church service hours.
From scores of cities today came
word that local loan committees have
made 511 preparations for opening the
three weeks' campaign with . a rush
de- j Monday, in efforts to raise their
quotas early in the period and leave
the remainder of the time for pushing
subscriptions. Self-interest consti
tuted the principal reason why the
public should subscribe generously to
the Victory loan, said the federal re
serve board, in its monthly bulletin
today.
Bulletin Issued
"If the obligations already taken by
the banks are to "be liquidated," said
the bulletin, commenting on the bil
lions of treasury certficates of in
debtedness already absorbed by the
banks," the community at larie will
suffer from a continued inflation of
prices that are consequent upon this
condition of affairs. Only one remedy
for the condtion now existing 'cau be
applied, that, namely, of subscribing
freely for the government obligations
when offered and of paying for them
out of the proceeds of saving, either
already accumulated or to be accum
ulated from timeto time.
"Indeed, the urgency for adherence
to this policy is greater now than it
war durng the war, inasmuch as at
that time there-was a strict oversight
and control on the part of the gov
ernment over production, distribution
LIFE STORY OF THE
GREAT AMERICAN
COMMANDER COMING
TO EAGLE THEATER
The important announcement has
been made that the William Fox
photoplay, "The Land of the Free."
will be shown at the Eagle theater
soon. This is the film that tells for
the first time the life story of Gen.
John J. Pershing, and certainly no
more interesting subject could be pre
sented on the film today. It is notable
that this is the first time the screen
has hastened to give the life of a
great man before we learn much of
him from books.
General Pershing's life has been su
premely exciting and interesting. It
has been lull of adventure that led
him to every part of the globe. There
is in it romance and tragedy and
achievement such as has seldom Sej;
recounted in telling the story of a sfh
gle human life.
The film that tells all this could
not help being interesting, but it is
far more than this. It gives us a new
view of the war and its causes, iris a
picture we will all see, and as mani
as possible will see it promptly, for
we shall all hear it discussed and will
wish to talk about it ourselves. Adv.
and in a measure consumption, while
at present that oversight has natur
ally and propeily been greatly relax
ed or, in many branches of business,
entirely abolshed.
"The responsibility of saving and
conserving resources tlius remains
with those who are the recipients of
current incomes, either frcm invest
ments or from salaries and wages, in
perhaps a higher degree thnn was
previously true."

19 claims, or 380 acres, situated in the Warren Mining District, in
the same district and locality as the Wolverine, White Tail Deer, Night
Hawk and Boras mines, all of which are in ore and their stock selling at
or above par.
At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the above Company,
held here on Monday, April 14, 1919, they agreed to put 50,000 shares
of this stock on the market at 50 cents per share, par value $1.00, and
non-assessable. -
. Heretofore this Company has been a close corporation, all equip
ment and sinking up to datehas been financed by the Company person
ally. There are equipments on the ground at the present time to sink
to the depth of one thousand feet, all paid for, and in excellent condi
tion and leaving a substantial cash balance on hand.
The money derived from the sale of this new issue of stock will be
used for additional work that has be;n mapped out at this meeting.
The public of late has gone mad over oil stocks and a great many of the companies
that have sold stock have proven to be failures or wild cat schemes of the worst kind.
Men that work or have worked in the copper mines know copper and its value; also
the future of it and its prospects.
Why should you fend your money out or the state to let some one else invest it for
you in something you know nothing about or where it is going to, when tliere is opportunity
here to make money? 1
You may be promised fabulous returns on your investment, but how many realize
those promises? Ask the men that have been there. . v
Don't "you think it good conservative business judgment to put your money into some
thing here ct home, something you know and understand?" This property is here you can
go and look it over and come to your own conclusions as to its future. If location or surface
showing amount to anything, this is the making of a big mine.
Ycu all know' what 50 cents has done for its investors in the making of the big pro
ducers here todaj.
There never has been any wild catting in this district, nor haf there ever been a failure
m making a mine in this district when a shaft has been sunk. Now, why don't you take all
this into consideration and take advantage of this 'offer? You all know the men that ar
connected with this Company; if you don't, see me and I will tell you. These men are sound,
conservative business men, that made their maney in the mines and large property holders
of this district and have lived here for years.
There is a two compartment standard shaft and to date are down 245 feet and making
from 4 to 5 feet a shift. On May 1 there will be an additional shift put on so as to rush the
work. The Company's intention is to cut a station at 300 feet and start to drift and cross-cut
but at the same time continue io sink.
Now, remember this, there are only 50,000 shares that I have to put
on the market, and no more, and 1 assure you that , when this is gone
there will be no more at that price. Now, it is up Jto you to take advant
age of this offer, as 50,000 shares will not last long in this district. Yours,

BY ZAPATISTA BAND
AT MEXICAN MINES
Assistant Manager of Copper
Property Dead and Swiss
Seriously Wounded
i . . .
(I?y Review Leicsed Wire)
NEW YORK. April 18 Edward L.
Dufourcq, an American, assistant gen
eral manager of the Teziutlan Cou
per Mine company, has been killed,
and Orme Gaisman. a Swiss subject
and business manager of the com
pany, eriously wounded ly Zapatistas,
who waylaid them, according to an
. announcement here dpuUght by the
National Association for the Protec
tion of American Rights in Mexico.
According to word received from
Dufourcq9 widow, now in this city,
and substantiated by Mter advices
received here by D. C. kBown, presi
dent of the copper comua oy, the two;
mea were attacked at a telephone sta
tion, four miles from Teziutlan, late
Wednesday afternoon, after they had
left the mines on a railway; gasoline
motor car. 1
Mrs. Dufourcq, who left Teziutlan
to atttnd to some of her husband's
business affairs here, and who mend
ed returning to the mines, expressed
the opinion that the bandits intended
to capture the pair and hold them for
ransom. It was the second time they
had been held up by Zapatistas, she
said, and when they were captured
last fall, they were released after the
bandii found no ransom was forth
coming;. ,
During four and a half months she
was with -her husband at the mines,
she said, tAey were constantly harass
ed by bandits.
Dufourcq, a prominent consulting
mining engineer, had been a member
of the American Institute of mining
land metallurgy since 1897.

this is the strong German element in

UPSET?
RED VICTIMS BURIED '
FIFTY IN ONE GRAVE
REVAL, Esthonia, April 18. Stor
ies of 50 bodies buried in one grave,
five of them women, skulls crushed
by the bolsheviki, the victims bayo
net-pierced and mutilated, the remains
stamped down by the heavy boots of
the Red Guard, are being told to Es
thonian authorities
The Esthonians have cleared a por
tion of their -territory of the Red
terror. They have begun to gainer
official reports of the ruthlessness of
the invaders. And the stories they
are told rival any before related in
four years of warfare. J
The grave of 50 bodies was the larg
est of a number around Wesenberg
which were opened in the search for
evidence. The story of the murders
was told by A. Munstrum, .who es
caped from his bolsheviki guards. -
'Fifty-six of us were led to the place
of execution," he testifies. "The
grave was already dug, a long trencn.
Half of the victims including six wo
men were lined up at the side of the
trench . The women were to be shot
first. One tried to escape. Red
Guards shot her and she sank to the
round wounded. They dragged her
by the feet to the grave shot her
again and shoved her in. Then they
stamped on her body until she was
silent. The others ware shot and
tumbled into the graves. Then with
the butts of their rifles and their
bayonets the bolsheviki finished them
off and they 'trampled their bodies
down. When they lined up the next
lot I managed to slip away." .
Investigators identified 41 oft the 50
bodies taken from this grave. One
was the Baroness Wrangel of Wesen
berg. Another was a sister of mercy.
The skulls of 33 had been shattered.
The clothing had been taken, even
to the boots.
In Dorpat similar stories were told.
Bodies of 16 victims, dropped through
holes in thf V' were recovered.
. Ariu liiu legs iiau ueeu ui Ub.cn,
skulls fractured, eyes put out.
Twenty were killed in Dorpat with
hatchet blows and bombs in the cellar
of a tank. Among them was Archi
bald Platon, a University professor
and a gray-haired clergyman, says the
Esthonian report. The cellar resemb
led a shambles.
A report from Ellister says before
three peasants were killed their eyes
were put opt, their noses smashed
their bones . broken and their skulls
flayed

Final Plans for Drive in Dis
trict Made at Two Work
ers' Meetings
v
A meeting of committee workers
for the purpose of perfecting the
final plans for the forthcoming Vic
tory Loan Drive was held at the War
ren District Commercial club last
night. The meeting was presided over
by Chairman J N. Gaines who gave a
short but earnest talk on the import
ance of the loan.
"It will mean hard work for every
team If Cochise county is to go over
the top for there are many who sub
scribed while the war was on wno
feel that it is not necessary to sub
scribe again", said Chairman Ganes.
"Our duty is just as plain now as it
"was when our boys were in the front
line trenches and we aer under obli
gations to our soldiers and sailors
now to see that they are brought safe
ly back to this country. The fact that
our government has been spending
money instead of "lives and because
we went in and won the war in a
hurry " simply because Americans
backed up the country with their
cash should be a great' incentive for
us all to again respond to the appeal
of the government."
No Duplication.
Several suggestions were made dur
ing the meeting along workable lines
and it was decided that the men and
women will canvas their own districts
together in order that no home will
be canvassed a second time. The
team workers who have been selected
and who feel that they cannot work
every day are requested to commu
nicate with the chairman in order that
he can appoint a temporary worker in
his place.
Plans for canvassing the mines will
be completed today and by Monday
the bank blanks upon which pledges
and names will be in reaifiness in or
der that actual work can start then.
In order to spur on the work in this
county a tank that was nsed in actual
warfare in France has been secured
for this district and will arrive oa
April 27. It will be used for four days
in Bisbee one day in Tombstone and
two daya in Douglas.
Women Ready for Drive. 1
The women are ready. All the cogs
in the great big wheel r-pr their or
ganization have been oiled and put in
tip top shape. Not to be outdone by
the masculine folk they, too, held a
meeting last night, at the Y. W. C. A.
The meeting was called to order
promptly at 8": 15 by Mrs. Sam Kyle,
county chairman of the Fifth Liberty
"War Loan Women's committee. After
explaining the system by which the
banks would handle the bonds in ac
cordance with' the "pledge plan"
questions were in order and the meth
od thorguohly explained.
Mrs. Sam Frankenburg, city chair
man, said that 49 per cent of the
bonds sold In the fourth drive were
sold by women. In Bisbee the wo
men -practically handled the entire af
fair during the fourth loan and they
put it over in grand, shape. Mrs.
Frankenburg pointed, out the neces
(essity of obtaining the names of all
those solicited, whether they subscrib
ed or not. The purpose of this, she
said, -was to turn over all those who
failed to subscribe to the "men's
strong arm committee," who would
investigate and "go over the top"
after them. -
The meeting was of short duration,
lasting only .half an Hour. Repre

Fire of unknown origin, which for
a. time threatened to consume the
four-story concrete warehouse of the
Phelps Dodge Mercantile company,
broke out shortly after daybreak Fri
day morning and resulted in a loss
resulting from flames and water of ap
proximately $75,000.
Smoke was first discovered issuing
from the wndows of the fourth floor,
but soon the entire floor was wrapped
up in a dense column of smoke with
flames belching forth from the win
dows. , An alarm was sounded and the en
tire fighting equipment1 of the local
department responded. Six streams
of water were played on the flames ( LABOR CONDITIONS IN

TO VISIT GOLD MINES. -
Mr. and Mrs. W. L. Crowley left last
night for the Lowell gold mines in the
Quijotoa mountains where the couple
will remain for several days.
According to Chief Norton the fire
was the most difficult to combat in
his experience. On the floor where
the fire originated were stored great
quantities of paints, enamelware and
other combustbles, and the fumes
were at times almost impossible to
combat, several of the firemen being
overcome by the gasses.
Insurance was carried by the Phelps
Dodge company which wil lcover the
loss and damage and repairs will be
made on the building without delay.
Prompt and heroic work of the fire
men under the leadership of Chief
Norton probably saved the building
from total destruction. The city's
water mains were lygh pressured all
during the fire.
