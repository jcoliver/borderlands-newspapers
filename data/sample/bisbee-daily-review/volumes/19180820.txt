(Ry Review I-en.se1 Wire)
WASHINGTON'. Aug 19. Congress
prepared today to enat quickly tho
new man power legislation, extending
the draft age limits to IS end 45 years
General March told the bouse mili
tary committee the program should
win the war in 1919.
While the house committee besin
work on the bill by hearing General
JIarch. Secretary iiaker and General
Crowder, the senate, set aside its sum
mer vacation and will take up the
measure Thursday. It appeared prob
able the bill would be debated simul
taneously In the s-enate and house the
last of this week and passed quick
ly. Senate prohibition advocates have
ajrreed to temporarily lay aside their
bill and give the man power program
right of way.
Before the hotfse committee. Secre
tary Baker and his aides again ursad
action on the bill, discussing various
phases of the enlarged program which
tal's for an army of ncariy 4.)00.MK
Americans in France by June 30. 131S.

American commander, victory

next year. Reiterating his belief
that such a force could go through
the Gerijian lines at will. General
March went further and electri
fied the committee bv declaring
that such a force "should bring
the war to a successful conclusion
in 1919."
To exert this American man
power in securing victory. Gen
eral March said, "every single
man" between 1 and 45 years in
class 1 would be needed by next
spring. Shipping facilities are as
sured and maintenance problems
have been considered on the pro
gram. Suggestions that the 5.000,000 army
program would exhaust America's man
power were laughingly denied by Gen
eral March, but he joined Secretary
Bakrr in explaining that it represents
America's maximum effort for the
present.
Plans for calling new registrants
under the proposal explained by Sec
retary Baker, prolde for lhree class
es probably to be called In order,
those between 19 and 37 years of age,
those between 37 and 45 and those be
tween 18 and 19. Mr. Haker did not
object to separate classification of IS
year old youths, but he and General
March said ail eligibles would be call
ed out not later th:in next spring.
The secretary told too committee
that his previovn statement of the
department's intention to liberalize the
draft regulations In dealing with the
older nun to be made subject to caii
had been misconstrued. He said there
was no Intention to exempt married
men as a class and that married men
who do not support their wives or are
not engaged In useful occupations will
be called as they now are.
Discussing the "work or fight"
amendment cf Senator Thomns of Col
orado, to thp senate bill. Secretary
Haker said it '"seems entiri ly consist
ent" with the present regulations and
is unobjectionable. He said it does
not provide for conscription of labor,
as contended by representatives of or
gan ized labor, but merely would be a
declaration by congress of the "work
or fight" principle already put into
effect by the draft regulations.
Secretary Morrison of thP American
federation of labor appeared In oppo
sition to the amendment and it was
arranged to hear him and other labor
representatives tomorrow. Chairman
Dent said tonight he hoped to report
the measure Wednesday or Thursdiy,
probab'y with amendments. If sent!

The gains t're most important for
the allies, for, aside from wide areas

wrenching in the German defense is
becoming dally more noticeable. With
in a short time they probably will be
forced to commence a retrograde move

entire blotting out of old lines and the

FRENCH MAKE ADVANCE
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE. Aug. 19. (By the Associated
Pres3.) In brilliant local operations
carried out by General Mangin's
troops frcm the Oise river near Kibe
court Saturday and Sunday, import
ant positions were wrested from the
Germans, who left 2200 prisoners in
the hands of the French.
General Mangin now holds the line
running from Morsain along the south
ern edge of the ravine of Audignicourt 1
to Rosette heights, dominating the
plain of Carlepont and thence on to
Pimprez, across the Oise. This suc
cess gives the French command of
the valley of the Oise as far as Mont
Renaud.
With these routes commanded by
General Mangin's artillery, the only
free route for exit from the region
of Noyon and Lassiguy is the narrow
guage line running north to Ham by
way of Guiscard, and the high road,
running in the same direction. Un
less the German general. Von Hutier,
is able to stop Mangin's advance he
will have only this narrow outlet for
his troops and material, as the tri
angle between the Noyon-Chauny road
and the road from Noyon to Guiscard.
while a good position for defense is
not favorable for an intense move
ment of troops and transports.
The Germans consequently are fight
ing desperately to hold their present
lines, while seeking a chance to shake
off the grip of the allies, break con
tact with them and also slip away.
The results of yesterday's operations
while not spectacular, were entirely
satisfactory, the French overcoming
the resistance of the Germans in the
region of Lassigny and pressing on
toward Plessier.
The French army continues to close
in on both Roye and Lassigny. The ;
stubbord resistance of the enemy has
slowed up but thus far has been un
able1 to stop the progress of General
Deheney's men.
By sticking to Lassigny the Ger
mans are taking a big chance against

of the federal government, which has requested that all tax-fixing bodies
shall set the rate as low as possible in order to leave as large an amount

HIS SHIP FEW DAYS BEFORE
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Aug. 19 Informa
tion furnished by officers of vessels
attacked by German submarines along
the American coast has strengthened
the belief held by many officials that
the enemy raiJers have had communi
cation with persons on snore and may
even have landed members of their
crews to secure information. The navy
department, officially refused tonight
to Indorse this belief though admit
ting the possibility.
Positive claim that he met an of
ficer from the submarine that sank
the oil tank steamer O. B. Jennings
In a New York saloon is made "by
the first officer of that vessel, accord
ing to, a story reaching the depart
ment. The recognition between the
American and German Is said to have
been instantaneous, the latter making
Ins escape when the American appeal
ed to a brother officer accompanying
him for confirmation of bis belief.
Other instances have been heard,
not so well substantiated, of the dis
covery of evidence that German sub
marines have been la close touch with
the shore. One story along this line
waa that the captain of a coast n lse
vessel, being ordered to the submarine
with his papers, saw cn the command
er's desk New York papers of the
same date.
Communication between the raiders
and the mainland is pofsible at scores
of places along the Atlantic shore,
naval officers believe, because of the
irregularity of the American coasts
Recently the precautions taken by
the authorities to prevent such com
munication have been greatly aug
mented, both by shore patrol and oth
er methods which cannot be discussed.
No official report has been made giv
ing any definite evidence of an enemy
boat having landed.
From authoritative sources it was
learned there Is reason to believe
three German submarines have been
operating on American coasts at three
separate points. Two of these have
recently "ceased operating." either be
cause their stores have become ex
hausted or as a result of damage re
ceived In contact with the patrol
fleets. It Is known that the activities
of one boat ceased immediately after
a destroyer reported having dis
charged depth bombs near the spot
where the U-boat submerged.
One of the three submarines.. It Is
thought, was equipped as a cable cut
ter. This Is held to explain the part
ing recently of two Atlantic cables.
A naval repair ship, escorted by fight
ing craft, spliced both.
Descriptions of the submarines give
their length as 300 feet and their
armament as two guns of either 5.7 or
5 9 inch caliber. Naval experts adduce
the craft have a cruising radius of
not less than 17.000 miles.
The German admiralty now has in
commission between 160 and ISO sub
marines while the total number
st roved by the allies has passed the
200 mark, according to the most re
liable information available here. If
correct, these figures would indicate
that new German construction has
barely held Its own over the period of
four years, as at the beginning of the
war the Germans are known to have
had about 150 submarines. The toll
in the last six months has been many
times that attained in any previous
period and the constantly increasing
allied anti-submarine forces, according
to naval officials, will put the ratio
continually higher as time passes.

cerity of the man and the sincerity of
his words.
Senator Sutter's address was with
out acrimony r.nd without attack oa
his opponents. He con'ined himself
to the issues at stake in the state and
as he enumerated them he defined
them and Rave his views on them. He
did not mince words nor phrases. He
did not use the. flowered prhases of
the orator. He spoke as one man to
another and as an honest, fearless,
frank man can address an audience
which is half women and half men.
In opening bis address the senator
spoke of the pleasure he finds in re
turing to his home to meet and talk
to his friends. He spoke of his con
fidence in the campaign's outcome, af
ter his long tour of the state, and de
clared that he now believes that "the
next governor of Arizona will come
from Cochise county." He prefaced his
words with the warning that he would
speak from the shoulder, that he is
not seeking votes because this is his
borne, or for other sentimental reas
ons, but that he wants every man or
woman who votes, for him to do so
because they believe he is the proper
man for the high office of governor
of this great state.
"I. V. Wism is one of the great
Issues in this state and in the pri
mary election," declared the senator
then launching into his address. "Ev
erywhere that I go I find that I. W.
Wism is one of the paramount issues.
In the farming communities especial
ly is this true. In Graham county and
Marteopa county, and yesterday in
Yuma county and the day before in
Santa Crui, I discovered that every
one is interested in the issue. Any
number of men asked me the first
thing how I stood on the Issue, and
when I would say that I believed In
the elimination of the I. W. W. not
only from the state but from the Unit
ed States I nearly always, got the
pledge of a vote." .
Senator Sutter then explained that
by I. W. W., he does not mean the
union man., that he does not confuse
the two, and that he- believes in the
labor imion while he is unalterably
opposed to the I. V. W. He explain
ed that I. W. Wism cannot live In a
democracy.
"The time has come in this state,"
he declared amid applause, "when the
democratic party should divorce itsell'
lrom the I. V. V and socialism. The
time has come when these agents
shou'.d not be found about the capi
loi of this great state, when they
thould not be employed as guards at
the state prison and when they should
not be permitted to associate with the
chief executive of this great and sov
ereign state."
The senator then compared the
ideals of 1. V. Wism and Bolnhevik
ism wiih tie idtals of democracy,
showing bow the former two cannot
iive in a democracy.
"I stand for a clean campaign, the
same as I stand for a 'clean govern
ment if I am elected," the senator con
cluded. "In this connection I wish to

Does that sound like I'm a corporation

that, I put up every dollar of the costs

thnn that. One of these poor work
ing men had no money, I bought coal
and sent it to his home, and I paid for

as regards the working man in the
past several years. During the terri

and cited the Journal for proot, he sup

other which provided a similar day for

the dealers in hides, and matters ui
boots and shoes and trunks and va
lises, made profits in 1916 and 1917

those of the Appalachian operators,
averaging 50 per cent. One middle
western mine, however, made 408 per
cent In 1916 and 934 per cent in excess
profits in 1917. The report further
shows that profits of the western coal
operators were normal during both
years.
Copper mining companies' earn
ings ranged from 103.36 per cent,
the lowest, to 972 per cent In 191b.
None showed an exceas profit in

That Chicago Ver di
As was generally expected, that Chicago
jury, when confronted by an overwhelm
ing mass of evidence, brought in a verdict
against one hundred I. V. W. leaders and
high privates on four counts of an indict
ment that alleged many kinds of treason,
sabotage and outlawry against all accepted
and practical and decent forms of society.
And Judge Landis did not quibble or hesi
tate in the matter of a sentence. He in
flicted a prison sentence of twenty-seven
years and a fine of $ 1 0,000 up each of these
men. Their offenses were grave and the
evidence against them clear and convinc
ing. Ordinarily the governing powers of
thi3 great republic are most patient and le
nient to the point of indifference regarding
the activities of every species of sociological
fanatic and propagandist and agitator and
radical and reformer and objector and pub
lic and private nuisance in general. This
is a free country and every man and organi
zation is accorded the right to raise all the
rumpus his purse and his lungs can muster,
so long as he does not violate federal or
state laws and city ordinances.
This nation was founded by men in
search of freedom of speech, thought, ac"
tibn and religion. It is next to impossible
for a citizen of this republic to be brought
into court for any extreme views he may
have or express regarding the government,
religion or society in general. It is his
blessed privilege in the land of the free to
have as many wheels in his head as there
is floor space and motive' pwer for them.
BUT, this nation is at war, and after
long months of patience that had ceased to
be a virtue, the government at last began
to take action against the crime of treason.
It went after foreign traitors with a terrible
hand. Then it turned to that species who
would hamper and harass and delay and
oppose the successful conduct of the war.
It turned to the objector, the pacifist, the
propagandist, 'the slacker, the dangerous
agent, the undesirable and the sowers of
discord, distrust and discouragement. In the
last two series of classes it found the I. W.
W. the most brazen if not the most danger
ous in the land. Long a community nuis
ance and even menace in many sections of
the country, the I. V. W., emboldened by
governmental lenienc' and made reckless
by their petty triurrps in harassing industry
in sparcely settled regions of the west,
stepped far over the line and began to defy
and bother the government itself. It had
destroj'ed private property with immunity
and had harassed private industry .without
an accounting, why, it argued, not show the
government where to head in? it opposed
the war. In fact, it opposed everything;
that was the key to its creed, opposition. It
opposed capita!, society, government, all
things that represented success and practi
cal attainment.
Its Readers, carried away by their own
loud and large words, preached and wrote
and practiced open opposition to the draft
and the prosecticn of the war. Sabotage
was openly defended. It consorted with
doubtful and dangerous agents of foreign
powers. Its methods were copied by Ger
man spies and agents. In fact, this organi
zation of tramps, bums and derelicts and
men who wanted to live without work took
one step too far in their career of petty
crime and demagogery and intimidation
and destruction, and the result was that the
government, long tired, stepped in and
took a hand. Wholesale arrests and the
gathering of evidence followed and then
came the Chicago trial, at which the entire
serine and motive of the I. V. V. were
laid bare. It was not as dangerous or as
powerful or as strong or as influential as
had been feared, but its petty knaveries and
disruptions and harassmcnts were worse.
Probably not one-tenth of its crimes against
society were brought out in the evidence
and not one-twenticlh of its treasons and
ir.ir plots -3rd association with enemy agent3
were disclosed. Bue enough was shown
and proved to bring a verdict and a stern
sentence against the leaders caught in the
federal net.
To all industrial communities of Arizona
and the mining and farming and forest
states of the west the verdict of Chicago
ccmes as a relief from a pest, a nuisance and
a constant evil. Many discip!c3 of this
miserable creed remain in this state and in
this community, and, many of their friends,
sympathizers and well wishers remain also.
But they can no longer preach their doctrine
in public places and flaunt their red cardj
and practice of intimidation with impunity.
They have gone beyond the pale. And Bs
bee, interest is not lessened when it is
considered that Big Bill Haywood's wild
and insane threats against the government
following the Bisbee deporation were al
most immediately followed by the long ex"
pected and long deferred governmental
action against him and . his wobbly band.
Bisbee has suffered as much annoyance
and trouble and expense and actual peril at
the hands of the I. W. W. as probably any
other community in the nation. Many of
her leading citizens even now face trial in
the courts for having taken action against
the Haywood crey ahead of the govern
ment's move. But some one has to move
first. The Bisbee deportation was the for
lorn hops led against the wobbly in the
west, and the Chicago verdict was the final
victory in the long struggle to place him
in the ranks of criminals and traitors and
outlaws, where he belongs. To the nation
at large it is not so very important, but in
the mining camps and wheat fields and can
neries and lumber mills of the great west,
it will result in incalculable good and be far
reaching in its effects. For the I. W. W.,
be it known, was not only an active menace
against industry but, through friends and
sympathizers and office seekers, it had
gained an influence in the new and thinly
settled states that will quickly diiappear,
now that the government s brand of out
lawry has been firmly fixed upon the organ
ization and all who cling to its customs and
aid its propaganda and embrace its faith.
That jury verdict in Chicago against the
I. V. W. marks something more significant
than merely a just decree against an outlaw
organization, it marks the firmness, the
good sense and the solidity of the entire
fabric of American national life. In Rus
sia the wild-eyed radicals and bolsheviks
may be able to plunge a nation into an
archy, dismay and ruin, but not over here.
Brought face to face with the law and senti
ment of the land, the I. W. W. is shorn at
a stroke of any national prominence or in
fluence cr importance. It is merely ar
rested by the policeman as a common bum,
thrown in jail and given thirty days by the
judge next morning. And nothing could
be more typical of the I. W. V. than to be
disposed of in just such a simple and pro
saic fashion by the United States govern
menty for it lacked all the things that could
make it dangerous and none of the things
that made it a pest and a sore and a nuis
ance. And it is also sad but true that to
many paople in Arizona the verdict of that
Chicago jury will come as a blow.
Nothing could mark with stronger sig
nificance the change in events on the west
ern front than the recent appeal of Ger
many to Austria for twenty divisions for
that front. Four months ago the German
armies were rushing on to what they had
been told was a "victorious peace drive."
Today they are barely holding their lines
in two places after giving up two great
salients that had cost them a quarter cf a
million apiece in German cannon fodder.
And they are calling on poor old despised
and beaten and demoralized and starving
and duped Austria for men. It is Austria
cr nothing. There are no more German
soldiers upon which to call. As for the
Austrians, they have been proved ten times
ever in this war as being the poorest sol
diers engaged on any front.
No more striking summar' of the' third
battle of the Somme and the full extent of
the British victory there can be found than
in the facts presented by a military critic
who declares that more ground was gained
and more prisoners taken by the allies from
daylight to noon on August 8 last than
were gained and taken by the British in the
first battle of the Somme from July to No
vember of 1916. And it cost the British
just ten thousand men on August 8, while
it cost them nearly a half million in 1916.
Thus is shown, cither the wonderful in
crease in the efficiency and power of the
British armies in France or the correspond
ing decrease in that of the Germans.

COME AND CO
JOHNSON STAYS
WHILE WAITING FOR THE MAIL AND NEWS FROM THE FRONT
Chairman of Board of Super
visors Comes Right Back
at Them Every Once in a
While
Politicians can come and go; can
didates can run for office and be de
feated and vanish in the shades that
envelop Salt Creek and return no
more, and the Don Luis people will
refuse worry or to fret, they have their
own woik to do and their own worries,
joys and sadness, but Vance Johnson,
chairman of the Cochise county board
of supervisors, goes on forever. They
make Johnson's troubles, fights and
political worries their own. Why not?
It is a fifty-fifty play at that. John
son made their troubles his troubles
in their time of need.
The newspaper man found out about
it all by accident. He went out with
James Malley, miner and "mayor" of
Don Luis, the other day to see his
garden, and the talk turned to politics. I
Malley, being Irish himself, was born
with the gift of either playing or undo
ing politicians, and he had some de
cided ideas. He was particularly
strong for Vance Johnson for re-election
to his place on the county board
of supervisors. The newspaper man
asked the miner, "Why?" And the
miner had his reasons, and they were
practical as well as personal.
"I'll show you," he said. And he
did.
He took the newspaper man out the
side gate of his garden plot and across
the mesquite flat back of Don Luis
on towards the foot of the hills, head
ing in the general direction of the
White Tail Deer shaft
"This is one reason why I am for
Johnson," he said, waving his paw to
embrace a considerable area of mes
quite bushes and sand. "See that ditch
thut has been ploughed out, and that
lateral there, and that revetment?
Kind of a rough ' and 6imple little
drainage system, eh, and it looks out
of place here in this scrub, don't it?
But look straight down there towards
the town. See those five little houses
there in a row just to the right? Well,
every one of those houses wtls built
and is owned by a miner or mucker.
They have their all tied up in those
little pieces of property, and they
worked hard for it. It means as much
to each one of them as another man's
castle might mean. I know. I lived
here and watched them accumulate
those places by hard work and sav
ing ami sacrifice. And do you see that
mountain yonder and that sweep of
the land down to here. Regular rain
shed. Every time we had a bad storm
a regular river formed here and rush
ed down on those five houses and
caused much damage and worry and
often threatened to carry them away.
They were helpless in the matter.
They could not sell and they could
not turn the water away. I talked it
over with them many times and we
figured what to do. Finally I went to
Vance Johnson about it. He came out
and looked it over. Then he had men
and teams fix this drainage, and he
had a flume or culvert put in down in
the main read down yonder, and now
there is no more trouble for those
five fellows when a storm comes.
Their property they worked so hard
for is safe and valuable now. It did
not cost much. If some big bug or
rich fellow with influence had. asked
for special road work or improvements
of that sort any politician might well
have done it for him. but these fellows
were just poor miners and had no
"pull." They didn't need it with
Vance Johnson. He wanted to see and
note the practical side of it and the
good that it would do for worthy peo
ple, and that wis all. He had It done
and went oil his way, and those fel
lows would never have known who did
it for 'em if I hadn't told "em."
Malley led the way back to his house
and he talked further about Vance
Johnson on the way and he pointed
out other improvements and benefits
that Johnson had personally secured
for Don Luis, the little town where a
few hundred miners have settled and
hnilded and improved and call home.
These men are proud of their town and
the work they have done there. Vance
Johnson gave them roads that placed
Don Luis on the map. The main
highway to Nac.o runs through there
and it is a good road. Time was
when a resident of the town could
scarcely find his way in and out by
night over tho trail. But they found
that a simple miner's appeal carried
just as much weight with Johnson
as the appeal of any one else if it
was in a worthy and practical and
just cause, and so it came about that
Don Luis prints with pride to her
highways and she undertakes to keep
them up to standard.
Yes. Vance Johnson is pretty toler
able strong in Don Luis, and there is
a reason for it; many reasons; and
Jim Malley can tell them to you in a
such a manner that you cannot help
but believe them and store up gome
admiration of your own for this man
Johnson, whether you live in Don
Luis or not. A man in a thousand

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY, AUGUST 20, 1918.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 19 Apart from
a ne premium for Liberty 3V. which
rose to lOl.Oti. and the isolate-d
strength of shipping and rails, today's
stock market was one of the most In
significant of the dull summer sea-ion.
United States Steel varied only the
smallest fraction until the final hour,
when it manifested a firmer tune with
associated industries.
Marine preferred scored an acvance
of 1V4 points, the common gaining a
substantial fraction and American in
ternational corporation, one point.
Rails were featured by Canadian Pa
cific, which was unusually active at a
2 point advance.
Utilities made additional recoveries
from the. depression which accompan
ied the recent acquisition of the tele
graph and telephone companies by the
government and a few specialties btif
v fened on pub'.ication of favorable fi
nancial reports. Salts amounted to
172.000 shares

GRAIN
CHICAGO, Aug. 19. Activity and
strength of piovisions was the feature
of board of trade business today. Pork
futures registered net gains of 10fi3034
lard, 1517c and ribs, 37"c
Te trade was impressed by an advance
In live hogs at the stock yards, where
a $20.00 top was registered. Another
factor was the exDOrt figures on lard
and meats which, while smaller thanj
last weens, were mrper man u yrar;
ago at th's peiioJ Shorts were freei
buyers, and the demanl from packers
moderately active. October lard closed
at $26,826 and October ribs at $24.85.
There was nothing in corn crop re
ports today to excite trade and al
though the range of prices embraced
114 cents the transactions were local
In character and unimpressive In vol
ume. September closed c lower at
$1.61.
Oats were fairly active but failed to
maintain an early advance. At the
opening the trade was disposed to re
gard oats as cheap compared with,
corn, but on the advance cash houses
sold September. There was consider
able changing, too. to the deferred de
livery at about lc difference. Ship
pers were buyers in the sample mark-
et, but there was scarcely a nibble
from the seaboard. September closed,

LAS LEADS COUNTY
Registration in Bisbee, Lowell War
ren, Naco as well as In most of the
small, outlying precincts or Cochise
county, has been neglected by many
voters who are entitled to cast their
ballots in the September primary. As
but twelve days remain in which they
may correct this condition, everyone
who has not registered is urged to do
so at once.
Every Justice of the peace In this
district is a registration officer, while
there are several special ones. The lat
ter are making an effort to reach as
many of the people as possible, but
their success has not been marked,
Judging from results so far.
Douglas, Paradise, . Hilltop and
Apache lead the remainder of the
county In percentage of voters regis
tered. In most precincts the regis
tration has been exceptionally light,
either arguing a lack of interest in
politics or preoccupation with other
duties. As the primaries really settle
the question of who shall hold office,
in most cases, such negligence is not
felt to be consonant with, good citizen
ship. Persons who are qualified elec
tors otherwise, by calling at the of
fice of Justice of the Peace High in
Bisbee, or Justice of the Peace Win
ters in Lowell, may register.

ALLEGED HOARDING
OF SUGAR BRINGS
PENALTY ON RITTER
LOWELL CONCERN CUT OFF!
FROM SUPPLY OF SUGAR FOR
PERIOD OF WAR AND FINED $135
BISBEE CONFECTIONCR FINED
MORE LIGHTLY
PHOENIX, Ariz., Aug. 19. A promi
nent drug concern has been cut off
from all supplies of sugar for the per
iod of the war, and the American Red
Cross wili be enriched to the extent ot
$135 as the result of action taken by
the enforcement division of the federal
food administration for Arizona. An
announcement to this effect was made
today from the state headquarters fol
lowing the issuance of orders based on
the recommendations of food adminis
trators of two counties.
In a hearing held before Robert Rae,
county food administrator for Cochise
county evidence was produced to show
that F. W. Ritter. proprietor of the
Lowell Drug company of Lowell, Ariz.,
reported on June 23 that he had no
sugar on hand, whereas as a matter
of tact, he had 2700 pounds. This was
regarded as a flagrant case of hoard
ing; hence he was fined $100 to be
paid to the Red Cross, and refused the
issuance of further sugar certificates
for the period of the war.
On July 10 H. B. McDaniel, accord
ing to evidence submitted to R. K.
Minson, food administrator for Green
lee county, sold 100 pounds of whole
wheat flour without the proper amount
of substitutes. He was fined $25 and
his food license will be withheld un
til the fine is paid.
Tom Colakas of the Lyric Confec
tionery company of Bisbee, was fined
$10 on the showing that he bad used
certain sugar in his possession but
which had been requisitioned by the
government.
Upon receipt of reports from Jerome
that restaurant and boarding house
rates had been advanced following the
recent advance in pay to miners, the
enforcement division issued orders to
day to all public eating houses in the
Jerome district to reduce their prices
in accordance with those In effect last
month. Representatives of the food
administration were also instructed to
see that these orders are carried out.

BRITISH APPLY PRESSURE
WITH THE BRITISH ARM V IN
FRANCE. Aug. 19. (I"y the Associat
ed Press) In response to pressure
applied first at one and then another
part of the line, the Germans opposite
the British on several portions of the
front continue to give ground.
The German troops which have been
encountered in the past days, es
pecially during the operations of last
night, in which Outtersteen ridge was
captured and consolidated, seem to
have lost greatly in fighting effic
iency. Of nearly seven hundred Ger
mans captured during the Outtersteen
operation, many surrendered tamely,
after securing their rations and per
sonal belongings.
The operations of last night astride
the Scrape river may serve as an
indication of the Germans' intentions.
The Old Hindenburg line crossed the
river here cn an angle so that com
pared with the present line which here,,
runs nearly north and south, the di

Scrape is deeper than that north of

who was taken aboard a German sub
marine as a prisoner of war after the
undersea boat sank his vessel off
Nantucket last week, was landed here
late today. With Captain Evans were
eight members of the crew of the Nor

stroyed the Penistone.
The San Jose was sunk some time
today. Captain Evans, who had been
kept prisoner on the submarine eight
days, was put into one of the San
Jose's small boats which was picked
up later by a government vessel.
Twenty-five other members of the San
Jose's crew had not been accounted
for tonight. Naval authorities refused
to give out anything concerning the
experiences of Captain Evans or the
sinking of the San Jose.
Captain Evans appeared little the
worse for his adventures. He was
seized by the German commander
when he tried to return to his sinking
vessel for the ship's papers.

of the river have met with stiff oppo

isicnr, of the new revenue bill. The
treasury has submitted a letter pro
testing awainst increases in the ex

The committee ami the treasury
have reached an agreement as to an

The treasury asked that the pres

WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
ENGLAND. July 30 (Correspondence
Of the Associated Press.) America's
increased flow cf troops into France
has brought to the British public a
realization of the magnitude of the
movement The comings and going of
force after force have impressed the
residents of EnglanC with the might
of their new ally as nothing else
has.
Since the first days of May the
growing volume has been apparent.
Wave after wave of American troopa
has. moved forward from the ports of
arrival through the country to rest
camps and from them on to the ports
of embarkation with only enough
pause to get the sea wobble out of the
men's legs.
The number of rest camps the
name that has come to be applied to
what really are concentration camps
has been increased, and British traffic
men are finding themselves heavily
taxed to maintain uninterrupted the
shuttle of shipping between England
and France. The British are doing
that part of the work and American
officers have been high in their praise
of the efficiency displayed.
Americans are in command of the
men when they land and are responsi
ble for them in the temporary camps
and up to the point of going to the
piers where ships are waiting to carry
them to France, but the transportation
both across the country and overseas
is in the hands of men who have been
moving the British millions since
1914.
It is at the rest camps that the
American soldier gets his first real
stop in the voyage he began at an
American port. At the port of debarka
