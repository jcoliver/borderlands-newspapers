GREAT BATTLE
TO DECIDE WAR
ALLIES BELIEVE
German Offensive Is Failure
to Date as Objectives of
Drive Have Not Been At
tained (I'y Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE. April 17. While the cannon
tontim'p to roar along the battle line,
there has for some days been a virtual
cessation of infantry combats, especial
iy on the French part of the front. No
one jn the allied camp, however, ro
ftanlE the German push as being ter
minated. It is bellowed that the lull will prove
tem)iorary and despite their terrific
Joses and the exhaustion of many of
their divisions, it is considered proba
ble that the German staff is merely
iatitin to gather forces for another
effort and will try to go yet farther
in the hope of eventually breaking
through.
Allies Confident
Any such effort is awaited confident
ly by the allies, whose commanders
ftel certain that it will meet a similar
lack cf success.
The correspondent has been ablet to
fjean the prevalent views of the allied
side as to the situation. Almost with
out exception it is thought the present
battle will have a decisive Influence
on the result of the war, but it would
be .n error to regard it as the last
battle, 'i here has been a campaign on
the German side to proclaim that this
immense effort would result in the al
lies demanding peace, but they had not
counted on the tenacity -of either the
allied armies or nations.
As far as it has gone, the German
rf tensive may be looked on as a failure
since r.one of its objectives have been
ettained and the allied armies are still
intact whie thle Germans now, owing
to the diminution of their forces
through casualties are In an inferior
position to that which tbey occupied I
before the battle began. The only re-1
suit they can show is the recapture ol
a larpe tract of country they them
selves devastated, where they may be
compelled to dig themselves in. They
Jre engaged in doing this in some
-trts of their new front, but under

HONOR FLAG WILL
FALL TO DISTRICT
III BOND CAMPAIGN
Au honor flag for the Warren dis
trict tvas almost secured yesterday
whenctar&nbscriptions for the Third
Liberty Loan reached approximately
6!C,&00. $IWO'-short of the allotment
to the district. It Is anticipated that
the district's $750,000 will have been
raisei by this evening or early tomor
row, when the drive will become an
effort to assure the district represen
tation in oversubscription equal ir
no: uc re than the original allotment.
Yhe youngest bond purchaser of the
distilct of record yesterday paid down
his hard coin. James H. Hart, Jr is
the proud owner of this bond, and he
paia down $100 to secure it. He is
seven years old.
The campaign in the Warren dis
trict yesterday assumed larger propor
tions than on any day since the inteu
sivt work was begun, and last night
more committees had been working
than on any previous day. The results
were that the total for the day was in
creased something like $200,000 over
the last report made by the chairman
for the district. Each committee re
ports the same success and the same
willing spirit of the district as was
at first met with, and few reports of
disloyalties or refusals to purchase
have been made by committees.
Detailed reports of Douglas and
6on-e other districts in the county will
probably be in the hands of Chairman
J. X. Gaines before this evening. It is
already known that Douglas has 'gone
over the top and that Tombstone,
Pearce and other northern county cit
ies are conducting active campaigns
which indicate now an oversubscription.
years ago he went to Tucumarl, IST. M.,
to ciccpt a position with the Phelps

the company ever since. He went to
Douglas a little more than three years
ago.
On April 18, 1903. he married Miss
Adel Lowber ,who survives him. Two
children, Adele, aged 7. and Lowber,
aged 12. also survive. The doctor be

Liked Public Work
Dr. Nichols was a man of high ideals
and was always animated with a sin
cere desire to help his fellow man and
thra city in which he made his home.
Unobtrusively he has done hundreds
of kindly acts which have escaped the
attention even of his closest friends.
H? was a great student, which fact
was abundantly proven during a num
ber of public addresses which he made
here. Before the Enlisted Men's club
at Camp Harry J. Jones, he recently
made- an address on the double stand
ard of morals as applied to men which
was probably the most complete and
conclusive discourse ever delivered by
anybody in this country on the subject.
Mrs. N'ichols has always taken a
deep interest in his work and also a
Iarre number of friends here. Dr.
NicLolb owned a well improved ranch
near Tucumari.

SOLDIERS CAUSE
MUCH EXCITEMENT
Two soldiers from Douglas who had
in)l:ibed too freely of bootleg whiskey
caused considerable excitement in the
vicinity of Castle Hock last night
about 9:30. They stationed themselves
in the road and began stopping every
car that came along, stating that they
weie government secret service men
and had orders to stop every car and
search it for whiskey. They stopped
scerai cars and not finding anything
they m ere looking for allowed the cars
to go on. One of them stoppped a car
driven by a woman and she, thinking
that she- was being held up, began to
scream. About this time R. J. Kally
of the Crophy Company drove up ami
he slopped by one of them and m
told that he would have to let his car
te t-earched. He asked the soldier to
shew Lie authority and he reached in
hit: pocket and pulled out a long clu )
and Kelly drew back. His argument
with the soldier that had stopped him
WLEid the other to allow the woman
to e'rive on and she reported the mat
ter to James Allison the city marshal,
at hU residence. He came down tne
street to find them but they had left
tha: vicinity and came down to the
plaza it front of the postoffice whire
he met them. One of them was in
clined to be gay and made a war uik
telling what he was going to do and
what he cquld do but did not make
any attempt to carry out his threats.
Had bt, he might have found himself
fl-KTCd with a rap on the head from a
six-s.iooter. After Allison had tn'kcd
to item a little while they were in a
moii! pleasant mood and he loaded
theiu or. the street car and sent th-un
down to Warren.
The names of the soldiers of to
what company they were members
was not obtained. They had driven up
with some others from Douglas in a
car from Douglas.

MISS DENNIS STAR
OF FROHMAN PLAYS
When A. H. Woods presents "Mary's
Ankle" at the Orpheum Theater on
April 24. with the original New York
cast and praduction direction from
the Bijou Theater, he will offor the
public not only the cleverest farce
of a decade, but Amy Leah Dennis in
a new role, which is equally import
ant. Miss Dennis i always as im
portant as the plot, "which nobody
will deny who saw her play Lily Kar
dos in "The Song of Songs."
This same Miss Dennis is petite and
demure and all that, but isn't it
strange the tremendous energy these
petite demure people possess when
they have genius? Here is an illus
tration of Miss Dennis' case.
She was playing in musical comedy,
but the bit; ambitions in the little
lady were not satisfied with that at
all. She had higher ideals, so she
wrote about herself and her ideals to
Charles Frohnian, who was then in
England, and Mr. Frohman replied
that when he returned to New S'ork
he would see her. Miss Dennis
couldn't wait. She took the first
steamer for England, hunted up the
manager, and calmly announced that
she had just come over to talk it
over. Mr. Frohman was then select
ing a cast for F. Anstey's "The Brass
Bottle." and he promptly gave Miss
Dennis the role of Sylvia Futvuye tot
study on the return voyage.

REAL ARIZONA SCENES
IN THE HONOR SYSTEM
There are scenea depicting the fron
tier life of Arizona which are with
out parallel on the screen In the H-nor
RvRtem. nt the Fanle theater today.
Mr. Walsh, director of the plav. was
born and raised In Arizona and ehow.
It first In his selection of types. Hn
positively uses no Herman (X. J.)
cowboys, and, after all, that's a good
start. His men of the west breathe,
snort and fisht wentern fashion. And
they love that way, too.
The most moving scene Is when the
cowpunchprs and rangers of one town
dash madly on their mustangs and
cayuses to the rescue of their pals )n
another border town. It has been
raided by Mexican bandits, and Mr.
Walsh's scene makes Villa's Columbus
raid look like a game of croquet. Tho
word has been brought to the boys of
Lariat by Joe Stanton, the hero. In a
whirlwind of passion they ride across
the desert, the American flag at the
hes:l, snd save the town.
uppers are selected from the heart of
specially chosen, plump calf skins.
Sturdy oak leather goes into the soles.
The BUCKHECHT Army Shoe has
been manufactured ever since the
Munson Last was perfected. It is not
an experiment, nor a hasty war-time
creation, but the standard time-tested
Army Shoe. And its price is very
reasonable so why take a chance wiih

LIBERTY'S FIGHTING BROOD WATCH 'EM GROW
Hunt and His Allies j
i
A man is known by the company he
keeps; a politician by his allies; his ap
pointees; his familiars; his henchmen; his
shouters; his myrmidions. Gov. Hunts
name has been bandied from mouth to
mouth and from page to page and letter to
letter, always in connection with wobblies
and radicals and pacifists and undesirable
citizens generally. His pictures adorn I.
W. W. Headquarters. Pacific coast news
papers print personal letters he has written
to his wobbly friends. His appointee, Wil
liam Cleary, is defending the I. W. W. out
fit on trial in Chicago for treason against
the government of the United States while
at war.
The governor himself has been sum
moned as a witness for the defense in this
trial. Recently he was mixed up in close
connection with a wobbly and a suspected
traitor at Globe. Now comes the Clifton
Copper Era with a grave chargs about hi3
wobbly agents and. appointees conniving
with convicts to hamper state work. Co
chise county people will be especially in
terested in this latest disclosure for the rea
son that Hunt's appointee, State Engineer'
Atwocd, plays an unenviable part therein.
Our own roed work was tied up for awhile
because of Atwood and the penchant of
the Hunt political machine to butt into
county road affairs. The Era says:
''The situation at the road camp this
morning does not seem to be improved.
Notwithstanding the assurance from State
Engineer Atwood that 'the atmosphere has
been cleared, and the sunshine of satisfac
tion' is throwing its genial rays over the
hostile convict camp, and the charm of the
new captain of guards who has been placed
in charge of the force, the convicts are still
idle in the stockade and refuse to go to
work. Several were brought in this morn
ing in charge of a couple of guards for med
ical treatment. When questioned the
guards stated 'all was lovely at the camps,
and no trouble had ever existed.' But they
admitted that the convicts were not at
work.
"Information reached this office from a
reliable source this morning that very little
work had been done on the roads this week,
while the convicts were laying around liv
ing on the best food that this market af
fords. In the meantime Greenlee county
is defra-ing its proportion of the expense
to maintain these idle convicts. The same
source of information gives evidence of the
lack of discipline out there. Last night the
men passed the major portion of the night
playing poker, nor would (they extinguish
the lights when commanded to do so. It is
also said that the convicts refused to go to
work this week, saying that they would 'go
out Monday if they felt like it.'
"Matters have reached a pretty pass in
Arizona when convicts can thus defy the
authority of the state with impunity and
get away with it. Such insubordination
must be due to comfort given by men who
have been placed in authority. It evidently
results from havng an I. W. W. organizer
as one of the guards. It is barely possible
that convicted men would issue their defy
to these above them unless they had re
ceived f ncouragemcnt.
"With this state of things no one can
be surprised at an outbreak at any time,
and unless better discipline is maintained
the taxpayers should demand that the
Board of Supervisors insist on the state
tailing its 'pets' back to the walls of the
penitentiary.
"But Mi. Atwood who has been on the
grcur.d, and had the whole situation in
hard, assures the public that "everything
is lowly," ti at Engineer Barlow was still
with the road, and that while the gentleman
is po! t,lkip ff-r publication, he refused
to deny or tonfiim the rumor that he had
iesintu, yet the rumor is prevalent that
he if no longrr with the outfit. To say the
least, the situation is one that needs the
j'rc-:iy ha ud of authority to re&tore dibci-
General Lee's army never fought hard
er or better than in the days just before his
surrender at Appamattox. Napoleon start
ed his Waterloo campaign with a brilliant
victory at Ligny over Blucher and the
Prussians. Hannibal beat the Romans for
eight years before he was finally destroyed
by the Roman arms. And so it is with the
Germans who now storm along the Somme
and the Lys rivers taking towns, winning
battles and advancing; ever advancing.
They have the weight of numbers and of
guns upon the immediate battle fronts. But
they have not taken a foot of Flanders or
Picardy soil without paying a full price for
it and interest compounded and with usury.
Whatever the allied plan of strategy in this
campaign, and no one has the slightest ink
ling of this plan, it is sure to develop and
be tried to the uttermost before it is too
late. Be sure that Gen. Foch is consider
ing carefully every inch of ground yielded
to the invaders while his reserves are still
held behind the fighting lines. The man
who advanced at the Marne when his left
was beaten and his centre falling back be
fore Germany's first and greatest armies
is not the man to be frightened at these sub
stitutes for first line troops, no matter how
numerous they may be or how bravely they
advance.
While news irom the front continues
to grow worse and worse so far as loss of
positions is concerned, yet nowhere is there
a line in the dispatches to indicate that the
British have used their reserves. If the reg
ular British lines can hold the onrush of
Germany's immense troop concentrations
for days and then fall back foot by foot in
orderly fashion before odds of three and
five to one, what will these same British
do to these same Germans when the entire
British reserve forces are concentrated for
the final battle at evens instead of odds ?
When the great battle started Hinderi
burg had a million men in reserve.- So did
the allied staff. Hindenburg has used the
greater part of his million. The allied re
serve is still intact, fresh and eager as
bloodhounds in leash. So, in considering
the German successes and the dark trend of
the battle, it is well also to always keep this
vital and concrete fact in mind. This bat- t
tie may be won by troops thrown lavishly
into the volcano of fire, BUT THE WAR
WILL BE WON BY RESERVES!
Hindenburg's reserves lie cold and still
inhe French fields and villages; in an un
ending stream they flow back to Germany
in ambulances and upon the floors of hos
pital trains. Foch's reserves have not yet
begun to fight. And so it is, the question
of who will win in the end and has not been
answered yet, even though the kaiser's
"victorious troops" have taken Bailliul and
Messines Ridge and the hearts of all loyal
men are gloomy and sad as the bad news
comes day after day in a sombre monotone
from the battle front.
Ap,y in the Ked Cross of the Warren
District has appealed to the women
I of th district to devote more of their
i time to Ked Cross work. In a state
ment issued by officers of the society
yesterday afternoon, attention is call
ed tc the fact that women of the dis
trict, except for a faithful few, have
fallc-i down in the past few weeks in
their work. It is stated that this dis
trict Is behind many other districts in
the county in proportionate work, and
that it is urgent that more women turn
out at the various Red Cross work
room? each day.
Anions other announcements of the
society is the establishment of a new
branch of the Red Cross headquarters
I at Lie Elks club rooms where mors
spacious quarters are provided. Addi
tional machines have been placed in
tha sewing department, to accomm
date mere workers in this division and
more room is provided for other work
ers vho may be turning out any one
of il.o hundred and one articles which
are light now much in demand.
Vo: the past several weeks women
at the head of the Red Cross in the
district have been appealing for more
workers. They state the district is
falling behind in the quotas alloted
them by the Pacific division, and that
it ts imperative that renewed interest
in the work be shown. Every woman
in the district is invited and urged to
attend at least one day each week one
of tl'p Red Cross work rooms and as
sist in some way in the preparation of
much needed materials for the troops
abroad.
The few faithful workers who are
attending the headquarters of the dis
trict dai'y, an doing aruly wonder
ful work. Each evening reports of
accomplishments which are almost un
reliable are received in the district
'leadrmarters of the amount of work
doni t)" day by less than a liaudfull
of workers.
Yesterday one such report was sent
in by the Warren Red Cros auxili
ary, which meets in the church build
ing opposite the C. & A. offices, when
five women made during the afternoon
703 surgical dressings, an average of
fore than 14 dressings for each wom-
jan attending. This represents simply
I the afterncon work.
"I will support by every means France's
just claims regarding Alsace and Lorraine,"
wrote Emperor Charles of Austria to Pope
Sixtu3. What does he mean, "support."'"
Austria's perfidy to every one and upon
every hand has become a byword in the
World War. She has fought might and
main for German interests for over three
years and is now sending guns and gunners
and shells to the west front to help conquer
France. Yet France's claim to Alsace and
Lorraine is a just one. Austria sought to
divide and hamper the allies by publishing
the lie that France sought peace. France
thrust Austria through and through by
publishing the Emperor Charles' letter. All
the world except Germany knows that
France's claim to her lost provinces is just.
French land and French blood ravished
from Mother France by the Prussian's iron
hand. These people wept when German
was introduced into their French schools.
The saddest story ever told was that of this
first school day under the Prussian. Jean
of Arc s land and old home under Hunnish
rule! The angels wept at this desecration.
Thank heaven that great and fiee America
is committed to the restoration of Alsace
and Lorraine to France. The Austrian em
peror's poison gas fumes choked only himself.

MIES RESIGNATION
ACCEPTED BY GOV.
The resignation of Allan 15. Jaynes
from the state council of delen.se, sub
mitted on December VI, 1S17, Immedi
alely alter the seating of Governor
Hunt, was formally accepted Tuesday
by Governor Hunt in a letter to Mr.
Jaynes. Mr. jaynes has served at the
request of the governor up to the
(.resent time.
In notilying Mr. Jajues of aecv-pt-ant
e of the resignation, the governor
referred to Mr. Jaynes' editorial atti
tude toward the findings of the medi
cal advisory bourd in the MtCl'.iskey
exemption matter and to tht! won: ot
the state board of health In coii'iec
tin with the order to vaccinate chil
dren issued by the iL'nitod States
public health service. He also took
exception to editorial couwnent rHn
ii;g the leaders of organized labor
and the governor with the I. W. W.
organization.
In reply to the notification pub-
j lisl.ed yesterday. Mr. Jaynes renewed
I his protests against the work or th
state board of health and said he
based his assumption of alignment by
the-governor with the I. W. W. ele
ment on the governor's alleged ap
pointment of their leaders to public
Liiico and to alleged onlerences and
correspondence between the governor
and the radical element. He a:!ked
the governor to explain his subscrip
tion to the stock of a pacifist ma-zinc.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April 17. In the face
of further early disheartening news
today's stuck, market yielded com
paratively little ground, again prov
ing Its Holdout condition. A few
leaders (ell back 1 to 2 points, but
this was partly neutralized by gains
of 1 to points among the inactive
specialties.
The war bulletins were, of course.
the most direct market Influence but
me imusn political suuauuu ana a.
slackening in the liberty loan drive
were among the other adverse factors.
United States Steel made an ex
treme decline of 1 at the outset,
recorded full recovery at the inter
mediate period and closed unchanged
at 91V Reading also rallied tth,
other investment shares, a moderate
upward movement accompanying the
active final dealings. Sales amounted
to 340,000 shares.
Lower quotations for short time
funds and a reaction In Spanish ex
changes were the only features of
the domestic and foreign money mark
ets. Bonds were heavy. Liberty issues
yielding slightly with industrials and
Toreipn war flotations. Total sales
(par value) aggregated 3i2,000,
V. S. Bonds, old issues, were un-
altered on call.
GGRAIN
CHICAGO, April 17. Ideal crop con
citions made the corn market today
average much lower. Prices closed Winona 14
unsettled at the same as yesterday J chile 15V4
finish to 1 cents down, with AlayiChino 1
II .27 and July $1 46 to 1.46. Oats
gained Si to 1 cents. In provisions
the outcome was a decline of 17 to
40fr 42c. Throughout most of the ses
sion, bears in corn had things theii
own way. forcing July dow n to 12
under last w eek's initial figures,
Fiirtner widespread rains had lailen,
beneficial to newly seeded corn and to
soil In preparation for planting. Be
sides, tte downpours provided greatly
needed reserve moisture in many sec-
lions.
Notable declines were reported In
the value of potatoes, hay and ohe
laim commodities. During the late
trading however, corn prices showed
something of a rally owing In the main
to sympathy with strength manifested
by oats.
Activity on the part of exporterv
furnished' the chief stimulus for an
upturn In the oats market. Trading
In the July deliveries took place for
the first time this season but did not
assume large proportions.
Provisions reflected the weakness
of corn.

COPPER QUEEN OUTFIT
WINS 10-4 AND SHOWS
FANS REAL BASEBALL
A large crowd of ball fans is ex
pected to be present Sunday after
noon at Warren park when the Junc
tion Briggs and Copper Queen teams
tangle. These two clubs have each
won a game in the league play giving
them a tie for the lead with the C.
& A. boys defeated both times out.
Yesterday say the C. Q. club mak
ing its debut and .Manager Fred
Carnes' aggregation made a very aus
picious baw to the public. Slam
ming out a home run, two triples, a
double and seven common or garden
variety baise htt. playifr gair-tight
abll and stealing three bases, to say
nothing of combing two C. & A. lin
gers off of the slab by bombardments,
the C. Q. nine won 10 to 4 and showed
the fans some real baseball.
- Hansen Goes Good
Ferd Hansen worked for the win
ners and did a neat job of the slab
duties. Two scratch hits were made
off his delivery in the first six frames,
both balls which hopped badly on
the rough infield. In the seventh he
yielded four hits and a pass which
cost four tallies. One of these swats
was a drive to center which should
have been handled with east that net
ted two runs.
Hansen whiffed nine, had excellent
control and worked the , corners to
perfection. He should win many more
games this summer.
Sunday will find Leverett flinging
and this pitcher is counted on by
Carnes to stop the J-B sluggers. Lev
erett has everything as regards stufl
and added to this knows how to pitch
and has plenty of heart, truly a win
ning combination. Lefty Harris, star
slabber for the C. Q. boys last sea
son, will oppose him and some nitty
boxwork is predicted.
Stadelli Features
Stadelli's bat work featured the
game as he made a home run, beat
out a bun down the third base line,
dragged another between first and
second for a safety and in addition
whanged out two more solid smashes.
Hesse made a triple and two singles.
Haney, Carnes and Wilson are all
good clubbers and when the start
driving out base hits the C. Q. boys
will give opposing mound agists more
than a little worry.
Stadelli's circuit drive over the
right garden wall netted the first run
in the opening canto. Haney's triple,
a lusty clout to center which Gait
mis-judged, and. Jensen's boot of the
thrown-in added another in the third.
Carnes walkjed, tin the fourth, 'as
safe at second when Hesse bunted
took third when Hansen walked and
scored o na wild pitch.
In the fifth Carnes forced Tonne
son with onp away ( and counted
HeMsse's three play bang to deep left.
Schellenberg then assumed the white
man's burden and proceeded to pass
three men in a row, forcing in Hesse.
Stadelli's single, Campoell's error,
Snyder's mlsplay, a walk, Hesse's sin
gle, Lebrandt's hit and Snyder's wild
heave too late to catch the backstop
per at first and a hit batter netted
four tallies in the sixth inning. Jan
sen's error on Haney's bounder and
Stadelli's double netted the final C.
Q. score in the seventh.
C. 4 A. Make Four
The C. & A. ran In four tallies in
the seventh. Kincaid singl eand took
second on a passed ball. Gait walked.
Snyder fanned, Campbell singled, tal
lying Kincaid and Curley hit safely
putting Gait over. Jansen then drove
the apple to deep center and drove
in Campbell and Curley when Dallas
misjudged the drive, letting it go lor
three sacks. On but one other occa
sion did a C. & A. runner get as far
as third base and once only did an
other see hassock number two.
Wilson made a nice play of a hard
chance on Morris In the seventh while
Ballas and Haney made a neat relay
to Lebrandt to catch Curley at the
platter.
Meachem caught a nice game for
the C. & A. and hit the ball hard
each time up but In hard luck. He
looks like a sweet hitter and is a
clever big glove handler. Morris of
the same club also looks like a nice
batter.

world can prevent him from winning the
Victory.
The long fighting ages of the world

KEEP. LOOKING YOUNG
It's Easy If You Know Dr.
Edwards Olive Tablets
The secret of keeping young b to feel
young to do this you must watch your
liver and bowels there's no need of
having a sallow complexion dark rings '
under your eyes pimples a bilious
look in your face dull eyes with no
sparkle. Your doctor will tell you ninety
per cent of all sickness comes from in-
active bowels and liver.'
- Dr. Edwards, a well-known ' physician
in Ohio, perfected a vegetable com
pound mixed with olive oil to act on
the liver and bowels, which he gave to
his patients for years.
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets, the substi
tute for calomel, are gentle in their action
yet always effective. They bring about
that exuberance of spirit, that natural
buoyancy which should be enjoyed by
everyone, by toning up the liver and clear
ing the system of impurities.
You will know Dr. Edwards' Olive Tab
lets by their olive color. 10c and 25c per
box. All druggists.
DR. EDWARDS GOES
TO WYOMING FIELD
Word has just been received from
Denver, Colorado, where the main of
fice of the E. A. Edwards Oil & Re
fining company is located, that Dr. E.
A. Edwards is now in Wyoming, where
he has gone to superintend the di til
ing on the company's lease in the
Muddy Creek district. This lease is
equipped with first-class standard
drilling rig. The well is already down
three hundred feet. It is stated by
such wellknown authorities as Charles
C. Coulter and Dr. El A. Edwards tliat
the Great Red desert, the section in
which the lease is located is onj of
the greatest oil reservoirs in Wyom
ing. Oil in this district is reached at be
tween 1200 and 1500 feet depth. The)
E. A. Edwards Oil & Refining- com
pany will drill continuously 'and great
headway can be expected. In addition
to this valuable lease, the company
owns by location - more than 1000
acres in the Muddy Creek field and
nearly 2000 acres in the Chino Valley
field in Arizona. Several companies
are already drilling in the Chino Val
ley, and others are reciving equipment
and preparing to drill.
A special bulletin giving full data
of the operations ot the E. A. Ed
wards Oil & Refining company in the
Muddy Creek field in Wyoming is be
ing prepared and will be sent to all
stockholders.
HAVE DARK HAIR
ANDLOOK YOUNG
Nobody Can Tell When You
Darken Gray, Faded Hair ..
With Sage Tea.
Why suffer the handicap of looking
old. Gray hair, however handsome.
! denotes advancing age. We all know
the advantages of a youthfut appear
ance. When the hair fades, turns gray
and looks dry. wispy and scragRly
just a few applications of Sage Tea
and Sulphur enhances its appearance
a hundred-fold.
Either prepare the tonic at home
or get from any drug store a large
bottle of "Wyeth's Sa?e and Sulphur
Comnound," ready to we; but listen.
j avoid preparations put up by drug
gists as they usually use too . mucti
sulphur, which makes the hair
sticky. Get "Wyeth's," which can al
ways be depended upon to darken
beautifully and is the best thing
known.
By using Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur
no one can possibly tell that you
darkened your hair. It does it so
naturally and evenly you moisten a
sponge or soft brush, drawing this
through the hair, taking one small
strand at a time, which requires but
a few moments. Do this at night
and by morning the gray hair dis
appears; after another application or
two its natural color is restored and
it becomes glossy and lustrous and
you appear years younger. This
ready-to-use preparation is a delight
ful toilet requisite and not a medi
cine. It is not intended for the cure,
mitigation or prevention of disease.

A Massive Production in Ten! Big Acts
Startling scenes taken in actual prisons are shown. Yuma and Florence prisons, Arizona, were filmed in this p reduc

the picture. Enacted by artists and types famous in the moving picture world.' MILLIONS WILL MARVEL AT
THE PERFECTION OF THIS WONDROUS PRISON PROBLEM PLAY.
GOVERNOR HUNT, IN A LETTER TO WILLIAM FOX, SAYS
"Every one in the United States should see your productio n, THE HONOR SYSTEM,' and take to heart its lesson of
prison reform. This photoplay presents a vivid picture of prison conditions. It contrasts the old prison system, with
its inhuman terrorism its beatings, starvings, murders, suicides with the modern method which recognizes that
every convict has a human soul worth of redemption. " ' : . .
