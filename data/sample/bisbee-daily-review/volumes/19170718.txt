Case.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 17. Sixteen
women suffragists, arrested
while participating in the Wo
man's Party Bastile Day dem
onstration in front of the White House,
were sentenced In police court today
to serve 60 days in the District "of Co
lumbia workhouse for obstructing the
sidewalks.
The women were given the alterna
tive of paying $25 fines but' they
promptly refused the offer and were
taken 10 the workhouse at Occoquan,
Va., and turned over to a matron who
saw that each got a shower bath and
exchanged her clothes for a heavy one
piece prison dress.
In Sewing Room
Tomorrow they wilj be assigned to
the sewing room of tne prison, where
they will work several hours daily.
Tonight the party's headquarters
here was in a flurry Of uncertainty
over the question whether the women
had been permitted to serve their sen
tences without protest or whether their
cases should be appealed. Early In
the evening there was a positive an
nouncement that there would be no
appeal, but later tnat wa3 recalled
and it was said there probably would
be no decision until tomorrow.
Malone as Counsel
Although no one at headquarters
would confirm it there were indica
tions that the course of the women's
friends might be determined finally by
the attitude of Dudley Field Malone.
collector of customs at New York, who
came here to testify for the women
and later asked the court to be per
mitted to act as their counsel. The
request was granted. Police Judge
Mullowney giving him temporary auth
ority to act as member of the Wash
ington bar, but Instead of taking -any
legal steps on behalf 'of the women Mr.
Malone went to the White House for a
long conference with President Wil
son. Lawyer Perturbed
What happened at the conference
was not revealed, but Mr. Malone was
considerably perturbed and there
were many rumors that he had resign
ed his collectorship and would take up
actively the fight of the suffragists.
These run.Ors Mr. Malone would
neither deny or affirm.
First of Sentences
Today's sentences were the first of
more than three days duration impos
ed on any of the suffragists since the
police began interfering with their
White House picketing. Addressing
the defendants. Judge Mullowney de
clared his duty was exceptionally dif
ficult as there were women of posi
tion, refinement and intelligence. He
said their acquittal, On the other hand,
would be a dangerous precedent of Ju
dicial sanction to infractions of the
law. During the trial the court re
peatedly had promised suspension of
judgment o fthe women woul dprom
ise to discontinue the White H'Juse
picketing.
Trial Turbulent
The progress of the trial was tur
bulent and the judge finally was com
pelled to threaten spectators with
ejection for applauding. The women
recently reiterated, however, that they
were arrested at the Instance of "some
one in the administration," and the
judge finally gave voice to his impa
tience and said any further declama
tions of that kind would be considered
contempt of court.
The women, on their conviction,
were taken to the jail and then put

AMERICAN TRAINING CAMP IN
FRANCE, July 17. The American
trnnnit have been here for less than
a week they are not al lhere by auy
means and they have already made
themselves thoroughly at home, so
much so that this section of France
looks liek a little bit of America.
. Praise Frencn People
The correspondent made an extend
ed visit to the encampment this morn
ing and found the men fit and in good
spirits and ull of praise for the
friendly co-operation Of the French
people, who have willingly and gladly i
given up many of their own comforts ,
to accommodate the army. The avail- i
able houses, however, are not suffi
cient to' accommodate all the Ameri
cans who have arrived, and so the
countryside Is. dotted with newly
erected barracks that have sprung up
over night and made even more pic
turesque this beautiful section.
Water is abundant here, but uncer
tain as to purity, so that the troops are
adoping filtering methods by means of
bags suspended from tripods which
astonish the local habitants almost as
much as th eAmericans' inexplicable
thirst for water, which is unknown to
wine drinkers, many of whom seldom
touch water.
Clearing Countryside
A task which the army has taken
upon itself Is the clearing up of tne
entire countryside, and at the present
pace the whose district will feOon look
like a well ordered garden. Such pris
oners as are under arrest for minor
infractions of the regulations are em
ployed each morning in making head
quarters spotless and are' bring such
a degree of orderliness into the place
that the original residents are amazed.
Likewise, they find it difficult to un
derstand why the soldiers take so
many baths, for teh men make for the
nearest stream and dive in as soon as
they are at liberty.

WASHINGTON. July 17. Plans of the leaders of both parties
in congress for quick action on the administration's aviation bill, pro
viding a great program for striking at Germany through the air,
promised tonight to be blocked by a 'small group of senators, in
cluding La Follette and Gronna, who are planning to re-open the
question of conscription.
An agreement to name 2 o'clock tomorrow as the time to take
up the bill was made in the senate with the hope of a final vote before
'the food bill debate is resumed under the rules at noon. Senator
Chamberlain, manager for the bill, said he did not believe it could be
passed tomorrow, "or without considerable discussion later."
Passed House.
The bill was passed by the house last Saturday without a roll call
today was reported favorably by the senate military committee with
out amendment and by unanimous vote. Democratic and Republican
leaders Joined in the plan for hastening final congressional action and
until Senator La Follette and his associates indicated their Intentions
there was every hope that the measure would be In the hands of the
presideut before tomorrow night.
Senator Seek Delay. y
It Is understood that those who will object to passage tomorrow
will direct their attack against the provision which empowers the
president to draft men Into the aviation service. The leaders expect
that as a result the whole question of conscription will be re-opened,
greatly delaying the bill. '
Senator Chamberlain said tonight an overwhelming majority of .
the senate is favorable to the bill and anxious for immediate action.

by the French this morning on the left
bank of the Meuse resulted in the cap
ture of German positions on a front

War Summary
There; has been no relaxation in the
tensity in the fighting between the
French and Germans on various sec-1

Germans Successful
The success of the Germans north
of Mont Teton was obtained through
persistent counter attacks on posi
tions they had lost last Saturday, in
which their losses had been extreme
heavy. While the German war Office
asserts that all the old German posi
tions were recaptured, the Paris offi
cial communication says the troops or
the crown prince only regameo a root

Artillery duels and small operations
carried out by raiding parties continue
to feature the situation on the British
line. Intensive air fighting is still in
progress In this region, in the latest
of which six German machines were
driven down and three others forced
down out of control by British airmen,
whose machines all returned from

American. Soldiers Ready
Soon Says Belgian Head
SALT LAKE, Utah, July 17. After reviewing an infantry regi
ment which had little more than one month's drill. General le Clercq.
military chief of the Belgian mission, which Is now touring the west,
declared today that four months' Intensive drilling would make the
American soldier the equal of any who are now ready to go in the
trenches.
Inspect Camp Douglas.
The entertainment for the Belgian mission in Salt Lake in
cluded an inspection of the United States army regiment at Camp
Douglas, composed ot recruits who have been drilled little more
than a month. The regiment is commanded by Colonel A. N. Has
brouck. "1 have been particularly impressed by the way the men have
responded to discipline," he said. "The silence and repose of the
lines Is the hardest thing to achieve and was most noticeable among
the men I saw today. These things are important because they show
that the men are under perfect discipline."
General le Clercq was unwilling to estimate how many American
soldiers it would be necessary to move to France in order to Insure
a prompt victory over the German forces. "Other things are neces
sary as well as men." he said. "It is Important to know how many
big guns can be sent over and how well these men can be armed.
Nearly Ready.
''With the progress these men have made In a month, however. I
should think two months more would be sufficient to prepare them
to be sent to France for the first training in trench wrafare and two .
months more than that would make finished soldiers of them, the
equals of any."

ment made at Globe that a plot has
been discovered there which if car
ried out would result in an attempt to
destroy the crops in the Salt River
valley. The Mesa, Gilbert, Chandler,
Alma and Lehi sections comprise the
principal agricultural area in which
great quantities of cotton, corn, mil'J
maize and alfalfa are grown. In View
of this fact, careful preparation
should be made to insure the safety
of these products. The cotton crop
alone will bring to the people returns
reaching hundreds 'of thousands ' of
dollars, if the crop is harvested with
out mishap and marketed. There is
no immediate danger as to the cotton
until such time as it matures and is
ready for the pickers. Then the fields
could easily be destroyed if unpro
tected. Hay is safe until cured, and
the various summer grains are im
mune until ripened.
The guards needed at the present
time are for the business houses, the
gins, the mills and other plants which
are necessary to the proper handling I
and conservation of the crops and
general food supply of the valley.
Mesa has a large membership in its
rifle club. Every community has an
auxiliary body of men supplied with
arms and ammunition, and can be de
pended upon to act promptly when
ever needed.
What would seem to be necessary at
this time is the appointment of a suf
ficient number of deputy . sheriffs
whose principal duty would be t'o keep
a close watch of all incoming "tour
ists" and inquire into their anteced
ents. If there is suspicion that the
arrivals are in any way affiliated with
the I. W. W. or other disloyal organi
zations they should be compiled to
move 'on or placed in confinement.
This is no time for any hesitation.

Plot Discovered
Ofl.W.W.'sWest
LOS ANGELES, July 17. What is
believed to have been an I. W. W. plot
to destroy the entire town of Mojave
resulted yesterday morning in a dis
astrous fire that swept away a large
portion of the business section. J. O.
Day, now held in the Mojave jail, is
alleged to have confessed complicity
in the plot
S7tt?
LLQIHLi
Day admits he started the fire, but
says it was an accident. He tells con
flicting stories and can give n'o coher
ent account of his recent movements.
A detachment of troops is guarding
the oil tanks and pumping plants near
Mojave: On request of the authori
ties the soldiers established a tem
porary guard over the postoffice safe.
Apprehension was felt at Hemet yes
terday following the reported discov
ery that a considerable number of I.
W. W.'s have arrived in the neighbor
hood in the last few days, bent on
stirring up trouble among fruit can
ners, pickers and dryers.
It was reported that I. W. W. agi
tators would attempt to hold a meet
ing last Saturday night Marshal H.
A. Walker swore in 15 deputies and
gave orders that the gathering should
not be permitted. Kb attempt to hold
the meeting was mae, however.
Marshal Walker stated he is plan
ning to drive the I. W. W.'s out at
once. He estimates the unwelcome
arrivals number about 100, and of the
number about 25 are active agitators.
About 2000 persons are employed in
fruit picking, canning and drying at
and near Hemet

anxiety was expressed today by some
of the exiles over their failure to re

one of the federal mediators seeking
to settle the copper strikes in Arizona.
A telegram was. received from Mrs.

BAKER EXONERATED
HAS RET6RNED
Harry A. Clark, superintendent of
ihe Calumet and Arizona smelter at
Douglas, has returned alter having
spent five weeks on a vacation trip
which took him to many points of
interest His trip was slightly short-
. ened by the news of labor troubles
! now in evidence in the Warren Dis
'trict. He spent considerable time in
j New York and made a side trip to
North Carolina, where he visited his
i son, Jerome, a sailor aboard one of
Unc!e Sam's fighting ships. Going
north, he vis:ted Sudbury, Canada,
; looking over the mines in that vicin-
ity. Enroute home he stopped for a
! time in Wisconsin, where Mrs. Clark
I remained for a time. He returned
jhouie via Butte, Salt Lake City and
other western centers, where be made
short visits.
His Remarkable Medicine Ac
complishing Rema r k a b I e
Results in Leading Cities.
Referring to the visit to Arizona of
Mr. L. T. Cooper, the millionaire phil
anthropist and lecturer, who has com
manded such widespread interest in
the South and East with his health
theories and celebrated medicine,
Tanlac. G. F .Willis, his representa
tive, said:
"Thousands' of the most prominent
people in Cincinnati, Cleveland, Denver
Detroit. Louisville, Dallas, Atlanta,
Memphis, and other cities, where his
celebrated medicine has been accom
plishing such remarkable results, are
even more enthusiastic over Tanlac
than Mr. Cooper himself.
"As previously stated, Mr. Cooper
contends that nine-tenths of the dis
eases and ill-health of the average
person is due to a catarrhal condi
tion, which produces faulty digestion
and improper assimilation of the food.
'Tn a recent Interview, Mr. Cooper
was asked if Tanlac would relieve
Kidney trouble, liver complaint, rheu
matism and a dozen other ailments,
and in this connection said:
"As I have repeatedly said, my
medicine acts directly on the mucous
membrane, stomach and blood, expell
ing from them the impurities and toxic
poisons, and rendering to them a
strong, .healthy condition. I am con
vinced that the stomach regulates the
condition of the blood, and is the
fountain head of health or disease, as
'he case may be. My medicine is In
tended primarily for the regulation of
the stomach and catarrhal inflamation.
hut it is no uncommon thing for per
sons w.ho have used it to come to me
and explain that it has relieved them
of rheumatism and many other ail
ments, not generally recognized as
having their origin in stomach trou
ble." "The ingredients or medicinal ele
ments which make Tanlac come from
many remote sections of the earth
the Alps, the Pyrenees, Russian Asia,
West Indies, mountain states near the
Rocky Mountains, Mexico and Peru
are among the points from which the
principal parts of the preparation are
obtained. In the principal laboratory
of the Cooper . Medicine Co., Inc., nn-,
der the efficient direction of Herr Jos.
von Trimbach. a chemist of note,
those medicinal herbs, roots and
bar'js are assembled in the rough and
painstakingly developed so as to attain
then .'lifh standard of efficiency shown
by the uniform preparation Tanlac."
In referring to the unprecedented
'ir.a-v! for Tanlac in Atlanta. Gi.,
!r. !: . A. Smith, manager of, the
tiooHs Pharmacy Co., said:
"I have been in the drug business
!n Atlanta twenty-five years, and not
'r. my experience have we handled
-r.ythlng that even approached Tanlac
-? a seller. In less than five weeks'
i'.ctc we sold and distributed through
'r.r eleven stores over 9,000 bottles.
nd on one Saturday alone over 709
"irle called at our stores to obtain
the medicine." Judging from the re
peat sales and the many expressions
of satisfaction from those who have
actually tested Tanlac, the preparation
must be something of extraordinary
merit."
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker and in
Bowie by Bowie Drug Store. Adv.

JN PLEASANT CONTRAST WITH I. W. W. TREASON.
While the west is fighting to stamp out disloyalty
and treason within the borders of these United Steles,
the dark-skinned Hawaiian Islanders, two thousand miles
from our shores, are holding monster meetings at which
they pledge loyalty to Uncle Sam. B
At one of these meetings, held at Honolulu under
the shade of the sheltering palm and within sound, of
the Pacific swells breaking on the beach, a speaker said:
"My hope is that on the morning of August
1 we can share in the pride that Hawaii has not a
6ingle slacker. I want to go on record here as
backing the president in this new conscription
law. Why should your son or mine shed his
blood as a volunteer when some cowardly slacker
stays behind?"
Contrast these stirring and patriotic words from our
new peoples, two thousand miles from our shores and
five thousand miles from the seat of government at
Washington, with the sullen silence of our slackers at
home and the treasonable ravings of the I. W. W. speak
ers who were recently in our very midst.
Three hundred years ago these Sandwich Islanders
killed and ate any white-skinned explorers who landed
upon their inhospitable shores. Today, with the stars
and stripes floating above them like a halo, the de
scendants of those fierce islanders assemble two thou
sand strong and cheer American speakers and pledge
tbeir all to aid America in. her war to a finish against
Prussia. It is an inspiring theme, the patriotism of the
people of our new possessions. It is a splendid offset
for the treason this swarm of agitators in the western
states.
The Honolulu paper, in its description of the big
meeting, narrates that when the band struck up the stir
ring tune, "When Johnny Comes Marching Home," that
two old G. A. R. men in the bandstand jumped to their
feet and clapped and cheered. The old fires of '61 have
cot abated.
Our honorable and generous treatment of the native
people of our new possessions has been the seed sown
from which has sprung this fine loyalty at this critical
time.
NO, THEY ARE NOT COMING BACK.
"Are the 'wobblies' coming back?" asked a woman
in anxious tones over the Review telephone .yesterday
morning. "No, madame, they are not coming back; any
way, not soon."
Their record is against them in any hypocritical ap
peal they make to the government. In fact, they have
caused United States officials more worry and uneasiness
and trouble since the war begun than -any other one
tiling or banded body of persons except the Prussian
alone.
Their record is against them in any martyred pose
they may strike to gain the sympathy of public opinion
In fact, they have arrayed public opinion almost solidly
against them from New York to the Golden Gate.
For this hard-bitten horde at Columbus to appeal to
the public to take up their cause is as though a wolf
should appeal to the farmer to help him make way against
the shepherd dog that guards the flock.
No, the wobblies are not coming back to despoil this
pleasant valley. The mountains and the men of the
. mountains guard the district against their return. Public
opinion is on our side to a degree that makes us proud.
And the government has grown weary of the propagandas
of these perilous and idle men. Praise be, they are not
coming back.
THE RESPONSE HAS BEEN AN INSPIRATION.
Washington dispatches since the news of the Bisbee
drive of the wobblies was flashed to the nation, hav
been most encouraging to the citizens here who were
driven to the step by the plague that was set upon them.
It is declared that Attorney General Gregory will request
congress to assemble at once United States grand juries,
with U. S. judges in charge, and indict and try all active
members of the I. W. W. on the spot without the loss
of a minute. This will help, if not end the plague.
United States senators claim to have evidence, show
ing not only I. W. wl responsibility for strikes and mur
der, but the connection of these agitators with a power
ful group of German propagandists.
The United States department of justice, it is de
clared in special Washington dispatches,, has sufficient
evidence right now to proceed against the I. W. W. lead
ers under the espionage act, but has held back until
more definite and damaging evidence could be secured.
The bold stroke of the Bisbee citizens last week
has set off the powder mine that has long smouldered
under the I. W. W. throughout the nation. The response
to our patriotism and courage of last Thursday morning
has been one of the splendid things that keeps the lamp
of inspiration burning so brightly in the home of liberty.
It now develops, from an old diary, written two cen
turies ago. that Captain Kidd, the pirate, and a descend
ant of the Hohenzollerhns of Prussia were allies. This
sounds perfectly natural. It seems that Kidd, in a leaky
ship, sick and in desperate straits, appealed to the
Danish colonists of the West Indies for aid. This wa
indignantly refused. As a last resort the harassed pirate
chieftain appealed to a Brandenburg (Germany) trading
company that had Ix-en established on these same island
by the Hohenzollerhns, then rulers of Prussia, and wa
taken In, his goods bought, his vessel repaired and him
self restored so that he could again put to sea in strength
Wilhelm of Fnissia came by it honestly. Blood will tell
SUPPRESSING THE I. W. W.
(From the Chicago Tribune.)
It is difficult to speak with any moderation of the
outrageous eruption of the I. W. W. in the far west. It
is nothing less than rebellion, and the most effective
means of suppressing rebellion is to apply a little of that
"direct action" which is the favorite diversion of the I.
W. W.'s.
There is no question of free speech involved. The I.
W. W. does not intend to accomplish its treacherous aims
by anything so feeble as speech; they scorn the ballot
box. They are against the war, and their method of
making known their protest is by burning our grain, de
stroying our lumber, and blowing up freight trains. They
seek to make converts not by arguments, but by threats
and intimidation.
We read that western towns are seeking to deport
these rebels. In the old days we can imagine more
drastic measures would have been taken. The westerners
were handy with the rope and the gun in those days
We are not counseling lynch law, but we think deporta
tion is too mild a punishment.
We are too "civilized" to apply the old Roman law
spare the conquered and extirpate the rebels" but at
least we could intern them. The British have found it
practicable to put German prisoners to work at useful em
ployment Why couldn't we do the same thing with our
rebel I. W. W.'s?
It is annonnced the war department stands ready
t
to take "any action" in suppressing the western disturb
ances. We believe the action should be swift And' severe
Any weakness would invite more riot and anarchy.
GHOULISH CLEE.
The Mininsr and Scientific Press, published in San
Francisco, and a magazine of weight and influence in
its field; independent, owned -and edited by engineers, in
a long editorial devoted to the copper strikes, dwells
most nartieularlv unon a Butte bulletin which refers
with ghoulish glee to the alleged fact that "the com
nanies cannot furnish metal to fulfill their contracts." On
this subject the Mining Tress says:
"The mining profession as a whole is more than
willing to be fair to the toilers underground, and its keen
interest in the welfare movement is aa indication of that
fact, so that the use of the high cost of living as an argu
ment for higher pay would be received sympathetically
if it did not come on top of a period of extravagance in
the mining communities and if it were not made at such
a time and in such a manner as to suggest a "hold-up."
The strike bulletin at Butte exclaims joyously that the
companies cannot furnish metal to fulfill their contracts
now that so many men are idle. Who will suffer? The
companies? No! the Nation; the Great Cause to which
we are committed: these are the ones to suffer, and when
the public awakens to this fact we expect to see a popular
demand for a speedy settlement of this sinister attempt
to clog the wheels of industry at a period of great crisis.

VON FALKENHAYN
SENT TO RETAKE BAGDAD
Persons in a position to speak with
authority, who have returned recently
from Constantinople, say General von
Falkenhayn, with a German army, re
cently passed through the, Turkish
capi'a1 on his way to the Mtsopo
tamian front, above Bagdad, to reor
ganize the TurkUh forces in thi't
region a.id lauu. h a new offensive
whose design is to recapture the ci'.y
uf Harcur-a!-I!U-chld ffjin the Brit
ish, who took it March 11.
Falkenhayn is one of the greatest
strategists in the German army. He
succeeded von Moltke as chief 'of staff
early in the war the position later
assumed by Hindenburg. Many crit
ics attribute the success of the Rou
manian offensive to his leadership, al
though Mackensen got most of the
credit, Constantinople circles expect
his arrival on the Mesopotaiulan fi'ont
to change the whole situation there
It was reported Monday that the
Turks had driven the Russians above
Bagdad back across the Persian border.
GEN. SCOTT'S CONFIDENCE
IN THE RUSSIAN ARMY
After observing it at close range.
Major General Hugh L. Scott speaks
in the highest praise of the Russian
army. He has seen it in action in
Galicia, and made an extended . tour
of the front, including Bukowina and
Roumania. Wherever he went he
found the spirit and discipline of the
troops contrary to reports current at
Petrograd; of insubordination or re
luctance to Obey orders he saw no
trace.
As an eye-witness of the Russian
advance near Brzezany on June 30
General Scott was amazed by the dash
and precision with which the officers
and men carried out tne attack. In the
use of their artillery the Russians out
classed the Austrians. When the sig
nal came to charge they moved for
ward like clockwork and swept
through the enemy's lines, capturing
thousands of prisoners. It was a spec
tacle to arouse the American general's
admiration for the Russian soldier and
confirm his confidence in the new
democratic army.
The testimony of General Scott is
the first definite military opinion that
has Come from a high officer in a posi
tion to judge of the condition and
qualities of the Russian forces in the
field as they actually exist today. He
summed up the situation in the words,
"The Russian army is going to fight."
By way of proving it in eight days in
Galicia it has taken 26,000 prisoners
and scores of guns.
FRENCH GENERAL'S TRIBUTE
TO THE AMERICAN SOLDIER
Paul G. Osborn of Montclair, N. J",
who died of wounds on June 22 while
in the service of the American am
bulance, was buried with military hon
ors. The funeral was attended by
General Baratier of Fashoda fame,
who said:
"In the name Of the 134th Division
I salute Soldier Osborn, who came at
the outbreak of the war to aid us to
triumph for right, liberty and justice.
"In his person I salute the Army of
the United States, which is fighting
with us. The same ideal inspires and
leads us onward. We are fighting to
save the libetry of the world. Sjldier
Osborne, my thoughts go out to your
parents, who on the other side of tne
ocean will learn of the grief that has
stricken them.
"Soldier Osborn, sleep on amid your
French comrades fallen gloriously like
you. Sleep on, wrapped in the folds
of the United States flag in the shade
of the banners of France."
General Baratier then placed the
War Cross on the coffin.
It now develops that an I. W. W. man by the name
of How, before congressional investigators of his organ
ization, told them natly last February, that if they voted
war on the country his outfit would make war on them.
He predicted at that time that there would be big mining
strikes called if the country went to war. Therefore,
congress has plain evidence of the plot to close the
mines by avowed enemies of the government and self
named traitors. And now the government has twelve
hundred of these traitors in its net at Columbus. Will
it let them go? We think noL
1-MfpKt reDorts from Columbus indicate that "Bill"
Cleary has' left the camp of his friends for a hotel room
and bath. The role of martyr, however fine it be for a
few hours while the spotlight shines, did not appeal to
"Bill" as a steady dieL When it is all over, and the
history of this strike is written, it will be found, as it has
always been found, that the leaders wound up at a hotel
with "one room and bath," while the poor dupes that
followed them. Jobless, homeless, moneyless, are left
running at large to start all over again or go to the dogs.

On a day for them quite dreary
A man named William Cleary
Addressed a crowd of Wobblies from
a soap box near the store,
Ke raved, and swore, and spouted,
He cussed, and damned, and shouted
As he had in patient Bisoee several
nights before.
He spoke 'of things high handed
To the Wobblies there disbanded,
And the deeds of Bisbee's people
who had done them awrui wrong.
While the Wobblies cheered and shout
ed And the whole darn country ilouted
As they sang the cursed rhythm ot
their rabid Wobblie song.
There was cussing and much fussing
And an awful, awful mussing
Of thoughts when King' Bill and his
bunch Of Wobblies learned.
And their . freedom thoughts were
shaken
When the whole darn bunch was tak
en To Columbus. New Mexico, and In
the pen interned.
They were brought without a rict.
And they're mighty, mighty quiet,
In the stockade 'neath the eye ot
Uncle Sam.
And in the place they should be kept,
'Till the country's cleanly swept
Of these Wobblie agitators who rave
and curse and damn.
"I Won't Work," the daily creed
Of this shiftless, useless breed,
They're a menace to the country
now at war.
When the truth is told and learned.
The whole bunch'll be interned
And the country will have peace

OMAHA, Neb.. July 17. Twenty
seven pastors and heads of the nine

America officially purged the church
of the Nebraska defense council's
charges of disloyalty at a meeting held

adopted affirming the loyalty of the

The resolution called attention to
the Augsburg confession, to which the
ministry is obligated and which com
mands loyalt yto the government, and
to the small catechism in which the
laity is enjoined to obedience to the
government. It further declares that
the Nebraska council of defense, "be
cause of cases of indiscreet conduct on
the part of individuals, such as par
ticularized our church for the mark of
odium, when, undoubtedly, among all
creeds there have been those likewise
guilty, and yet these creeds have
passed unnoticed."
It also assures the honor and roy
alty of the ministry and laity in an
swering devotion to this country.
But one discordant note marked the
session. Rev. H. V. Saegar of the
Missouri German synoc, voted against
the resolution. Mr.' Saeger. said that
the meeting should not have been held
at all because the defense council's at
tacks were against individuals and
not against the body of the church.

Mooney Case Is
About Ready to
Submit to Jury
(By Review Leased Wire)
SAN .FRANCISCO, July 17 Under
guard of deputy sheriffs the jury try
ing Mrs. Rena Mooney for murder
growing out of the bomb explosion
here last July made a tri pof in
spection today to the scenes involv
ed in the trial. Accompanying the
jury were Mrs. Mooney, Superior
Judge Emmett Seawall and attorneys
representing the state and defense.
After a lapse of nearly a year Mrs.
Mooney again saw the apartment in
which she and her husband, Thomas J.
Mooney resided at the time of the ex
plosion. Moone yis under sentence of
death for one of the bomb murders.
Mrs. Mooney sobbed when the jur
ors were inspecting her library and
other parts' of the apartment.
The scene of the explosion also wa3
visited.
At the conclusion of the cross exam
ination of Mrs. Mooney early in the
afternoon the defense rested its case.
The state called a number of witness
es in rebuttal and Assistant-District
Attorney Louis Ferrari announced
that the state's rebuttal would be con
cluded tomorrow morning when it was
expected arguments woul dbe started.
The demand of Juror Charles L.
Beal that Captain of Detectives Dunan
Metheson explain what he called the
"third degree method." used by the
police in obtaining a statement from
Israel Weinberg, one of the defend-"
ants in the bomb case, created a sen
sation. After the state had recalled Wein
berg to the stand and he testified that
"he had bee nrudely awakened from
a sound sleep, not allowed to put on
his clothes and compelled to make a
statement with a searchlight trained
on his face," Matheson was called to
give his version of the affair.
Matheson exhibited a small desk
lamp which he said was the "search
light,' t'hat played on Weinberg's
face. Weinberg said he could not
identify the Tamp 'as the one used
by the officers.
"I would like to hav ethe whole
story," said Juror Beal. T would like
to know why a man is awakened at 9
o'clock - at night, as it seems to me
there is enough time in daylight for
the police to get statements. Some
consideration should be given a per
son. If the court will permit, I want
an explanation." '
The state declared it had no objec
tion to permitting Matheson to tell the
story.
"At the time we had Weinberg in
jail we were working twenty-four
hours a day," said Matheson. "We
had to take interviews when he had
the time. There was nothing to show
that he was asleep when I ordered
him brought before me. I told him
he did not have to make a statement
unless he wanted to and he said he
had nothing to conceal."
"If you wanted to be fair why did
the police keep Mrs. Mooney in a
batheroom for two -days and nights
after her arrest?" asked Attorney
Thomas O'Connor.
Matheson said he was not present
when Mrs. Mooney was put in the
bathroom but he said conditions in
the city prison made It necessary to
confine her there. He said she was in
the bathroom only 24 hours andl that
he saw she was removed to more com
modious quorters.
"Mrs. Mooney complained to me of
the treatment accorded her by Assist
ant District Attorneys Cunha and
Brennan. She sal dshe was ill and I
told her she could have a doctor."
Undwr grilling cross examination
Mjs. Mooney reiterated statements
made on the stand yesterday by which
she hopes to prove an alibi on the,
day of the explosion.
John Lawler, one 'of the witnesses
called by the state in rebuttal, said he
had first see nMrs. Mooney on the
roof of the building in which she liv
ed at 2 p. m. on the day of the ex
plosion. The explosion occurred at
2:06 p. m.
Lawler admitted that be had tesil
fied at the Warren K. Billings trial
that he first saw Mrs. Mooney at 1:45
or 1:50 p. m.
The state contended that Mrs. Moon
ey arrived on the roof at 2 p. m. after
' she bad accompanied the other de-
; fondants in the bomb cases to the
' scene o fthe explosion, where Billings
J was alleged to have deposited the
i suitcase containing the bomb. Billings
1 was convirted and sentenced to life
imprisonment.

CHICAGO GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO. July 17. Suggestions or
porolonged hostilities instead of fresh
indications of peace, turned the com
market upward today. Prices closed
firm A to 4 ' net higher with Sep
tember at 1:60 and December at 1.13
to 1.13. Wheat finished off to
up. 205 for July and 193 Septem
ber. Oats varied from net loss to
Jl advance and provisions closed un
changed to 17 cents lower.
Disappointment over future of
peace tain to take dennite ronn. was
evident throughout the day in the
corn market" Bullish sentiment be
came more emphatic still when the
fact developed that corn for immediate
use was scarcer than ever and had
risen to 202 a bushel for No. 2 white.
Irregularity of fluctuations was the
most noticeable feature of the wheat
market
Despite rains that interfered with
harvesting in parts of Ohio Valley
oats parted company with the corn
market and underwent a setback in
price. Lower quotations on hogs
weakened provisions. The market!
was also depressed by talk of import
ant increases of the domestic stock of
lard.
NEW YORK. July 17. Liquidation
eased somewhat and it was rather ap
parent that the severe decline had In
great part remedied' an otherwise
weak technical position. As a conse
quence the short interest which had
reached rather large proportions, was
more disposed to realize profits with
the result that the market especially
in the late dealings displayed greater
firmness and in some shares especially
in the late bearish efforts have been
directed most the resiliency was more
conspicious. The tobacco stock and
the sugar shares were the outstanding
features of strength in the late deal
ings. Peace talk which has been
somewhat of a market factor recently
was less considered today and seems
to have dissipated its, at least tempor
arily. The feeling prevails that the
government's attitude in respect to
price fixing and taxation levy will cur
tail to a considerable extent corporate
net earning power and until these
fears are dispelled by a turn of events
in Washington, presaging no dractic
policies, upturns in the market of con
sequence are not expected. We do net
think it an opportune to take the long
side.

My husband got me a bottle and I
took it according to directions. It
helped me so much that he went back
and got me another bottle. I got a
whole lot better and just quit taking
it I got over the dizzy spells...! took
no other medicine at that time nor

I felt just fine when I finished the
