'JOHNSON'S TOUR
Of
THREE SPEECHES
AT
Climax of Strenuous Day of
Speech-Making Reached at
' Packed Mass Meeting and
Many Unable to Find Room
SAYS ROOSEVELT WAS
ANTITHESIS OF WILSON
Regrets Necessity for Giving
Up Pacific Coast Tour, But
Imoortance of Situation in
Senate Makes it His Duty;
MINNEAPOLIS. Minn., Sept 20
With three addresses in the twin cities
Senator Hiram W. Johnson concluded
his speaking trip through the middle
west opposing the ratification of the
league of nations covenant in its pres
ent form. At noon he addressed a
large gathering at the Metropolitan
opera house in St. Paul and at 4 p. m.
he spoke to the Lincoln club in Min
neapolis. Tonight the climax of a Btrenuous
day of spechmaking was reached
when he addressed a mass meeting
which packed the armory In Minne
apolis. Many were turned away, un
able to find standing room. Mayor J.
E. Meyers introduced Senator John
eon at the armory meeting, where the
Californian was cheered for several
minutes when he entered the hall.
Answering President Wilson's state
ment that Theodore Roosevelt would
favor the league of nations were he
alive today, Senator Johnson said:
Says Wilson Hard Pressed
"Mr. Wilson, hard pressed, Quoted
yesterday Theodore Roosevelt. Oh, if
Roosevelt were only here! The na
tion never needed him more. His
commanding personality, his lofty pa
triotism, his love for and pride in our
nation, his very personality typical of
our republic, his loyalty to the great
cause of democracy, his fearlessness
In attacking any divided allegiance tq
out country, his red blooded Ameri
canism, would have made short work
of the un-American thing which Mr.
Wilson seeks to foist upon us. How
strange and weird and unnatural It
seems for Mr. Wilson to quote Theo
dore Roosevelt. They have ever been
the antithesis of each other. One with
clear vision and unerring wisdom saw
the possibilities of the great world
war and our interest in it The other
with feeble and flabby phrases preach
ed the doctrine of neutrality In deed
and thought. Roosevelt, when it was
unpopular to do so, denounced wrong
and aggression, broken national faith
and ruthless militarism. Wilson,' for
three years before we got intcf the war
was unable to tell for what the nations
of the earth were fighting, and told
us each side was battling for the same
hidden cause. For two years and a
half he neither saw nor understood
the underlying forces in civilization's
titanic struggle.
I Wilson Reversed Self
i "Unmoved and untouched he wit
nessed the crime against Belgium and
the assault upon humanity. He now
speaks learnedly on the initial phases
of the, conflict, the actuating reasons,
the roots of cataclysm. Until the be
ginning of 1917 he told a different tale
and spoke another story. It is only
now when the exigencies of his league
demand another presentation, with a
wholly different background, that he
reverses his utterances from 1914 to
1917 and assumes now to tell us the
causes of the war, the underlying
forces of the ruthless militarism which
pounced upon an unsuspecting world,
and paints a picture utterly the re
verse of that which, he painted to the
American people for nearly three
years. And during all this time
Roosevelt clearly saw and he sound
ed his trumpet call to the American
people of preparation for the inevit
able, while Mr. Wilson in utter indif
ference or with unseeing eyes, again
and again publicly stated that both
sides were fighting for the same un
known reasons and that Justice sub
stantially rested with neither.

But Democrats, in Asserting
They Have the Votes, Send
Out S. 0. S. for the Hasty
Return of V. Pres. Marshall
WASHINGTON, Sept 20. Demo
cratic leaders in the senate challeng
ed today the claim of Republican op
ponents of the league of nations cove
nant that enough pledges had been
obtained to secure adoption of Sena
tor Johnson's amendment designed to
equalize British and American voting
power in the league assembly. While
they expressed supreme confidence
and predicted at least 50 votes against
the amendment enough to defeat it
these senators finally got in touch
with Vice President Marshall, insist
ing that he return in hime for the first
real test vote on the treaty, expected
next week.
The senate was not in session and
Chairman Lodge of the foreign rela
tions committee, was not at his office,
during the day, and Republicans say
they had rested on their oars, waiting
for the contest to begin Monday.
"Mild" reservationists, some of
whom claimed to hold the balance of
power .were active conferring and
counting noses to see how many of
their number would vote against the
Johnson amendment Some of their
claims run as high as eight.
Both sides were expecting help from
this group, but there was no certain
ty as to how the majority might dine
up. Democratic leaders, in predicting
50 votes against the Johnson amend
ment out of a total of 96, counted on I
the support of many of this group, in
view of the general belief that five
Democrats would be found with the
Republicans in the lineup on the
amendment fight.
Senator Hitchcock said today that
every effort would be made to hasten
consideration of the treaty because of
the "insistent demand" from hnsinoco
people for final settlement. There was
no Indication, however, as to how soon
a vote might be called for on the
Johnson amendment.

'That Martyred President,-on
Eve of His Assassination
Had Glimpse Behind Vei
LOS ANGELES. Sept. 20. Presi
dent Wilson completed his week o
speechmaking on ; the Pacific coast
tonight with a mpnster mass meeting
here at which thousands shrieked ap
proval of his plea for early ratifica
tion of the peace treaty.
Welcome to the city by a crowu
which densely packed the downtowu
section, the president was cheereu
tumultuously everywhere he appeareu
during the day. Along the line of a
ten mile parade he rode in a din of
applause, and later . at a public din
ner cheers greeted his declaration
that the treaty should and would be
accepted.
6000 Hear President.
When he entered the auditorium
for his night speech he was cheerea
for more than two minutes by a crowd
estimated by the police at 6000.
The hall was jammed and outside
were thousands who could not get In
Some had -been waiting since early
morning for the doors to open.
At the auditorium meeting Mr.
Wilson was introduced by Mrs. Jo-
siah Evans Cowles, national pres
dent of the General Federation O;
vvomens ciuds, wno tola the crowu
that the league of nations "must anu
will become the bulwark of a war-
weary world for all time. The po
litical" partisan, she asserted, had no
place in a discussion of the peace-
treaty.
The meeting had .been advertlseu
as one 4f strictly ' non-partisan char
acter, and many of the state's promt
nent Republicans sat on the plat
form. Among them were Henry W,
Wright, speaker of the. California as
sembly, and Marshall Stimsou, who
was campaign manager in southern
California for Senator Hiram John
son in 1910.
Says McKinley Prophesied.
Mr. ' Wilson alluded to an address
made by President McKinley on tn
day before his assassination, and as
serted that the martyred president's
words about concord and arbitration
rseemed to show he had a prophetic
vision on the eve of his death.
Referring to objections that t
league would involve the Uniteu
States in "entangling alliances," Mr.
Wilson said the league was in faci
a proposal for disentanglement.
"What Washington had in mlnu
was exactly what these gentlemen
want to lead us back to," he sain.
"The day of alliances is behind us.
Cheers for the Weak.
When Mr. Wilson declared it was
a matter of amazement that' some
men were now opposing the league,
some one in the crowd shoute
"shame on them," and many others
took up the cry. There were cheers
a moment later when he declareu
the treaty was founded on the rights
of the weak rather than the powermi
strong. It was a people's treaty, he
said, not a statesman's treaty. The
peoples of the world, said the presi
dent, were tired of the old Bystem o
autocratic domination and they wourt
overthrow it "one way or another."
Under the league, he added, auto
cratic governments would be exclud
ed from decent society because ony
self-governing peoples could hold
membership.
Describing a friend who he saw
"never let the facts get him if he
saw them coming first," the president
asserted that some men could not
now see the facts In the treaty dis
cussion marching upon them.
1. Defends Shantung Pact.
"My prediction is that the facts
are going to see them," he addeiv
while the crowd cheered again, "ana
make a very comfortable nieal oi
them."
Mr. Wilson reviewed at length tft
history of the German rights in Shan
tung province, declaring when thoso
rights were acquired, the state of in
ternational law was such that Pres
dent McKinley and Secretary Hay dtu
not even protest, but only asked thai
American trade rights should hot bo
affected. The Hay open door policy,
he said, meant "not the open door
to the rights of China, but an opeu
door for the goods of America."

Eve of Nation-wide Strike Strike Finds Both Sides Prepared

Whistles Tomorrow Morning and Try to Operate Plants
Pittsburgh Officials Strengthen Most of City's Safeguards
PITTSBURG, Sept. 20. The eve of
the nation-wide strike in the steel In
dustry finds both sides in the contest
apparently prepared for the . battle.
Final arrangements were rushed to
day, the corporations paying much at
tention to plans for guarding their
property and the union leaders contin
uing their intensive campaign to
unionize unorganized men and urging
otherB to stand by the workers. To
night there seemed to be nothing to do
but wait for the test of strength on
Monday when the strike will officially
begin. 1
Expressing confidence that the
unions have not the power to compel
a general shutdown, officials of th
United States Steel corporation, the
main object of the attack of labor, and
of other steel companies, said they
will blow their whistles as usual Mon
day morning and try to operate their
plants.
They frankly admit they will do
their best and if sufficient men do not
report, which they do not concede.
they will shut down until such time as
they can command enough men to
make it worth while to start up again.
There is no talk of bringing strike
breakers into this district in the event
the unions cripple or close down the
plants, v It is said the larger corpora
tions prefer to remain closed than
cause unnecessary turmoil that some
times fellows the bringing of strike
breakers into a community.
City Officials Ready
The strike order affects approxi
mately 200,000 iron and steel workers
in the inner and outer Pittsburg dis
trict between Johnstown, Pa., on the
east, and Youngstown, Ohio, on the
west. Union leaders claim a majority
of these men will follow the request
of the steel workers' national commit
tee and refuse to go to work Monday.
They assert that not only union men
will be in the walkout, but that they
will be joined by thousands who are
not affiliated with any labor organiza
tion.
Municipal and borough officials in
many parts of the Pittsburg district
today also prepared to meet the sit
uation and have taken precautions to
maintain law and order in their com
munities.
Mayor George H. Lysle of McKees
port, who union leaders complain,

" ' "The . tremendous, and overwhelming
response everywhere to the doctrine
of Americanism has made me most
anxious to continue my itinerary to

-invitations extended to me from every
icity between lere and California and
particularly of course, "I should like
to go into the state wnere I was born
and whlcJi has my first allegiance.
My amendment, however, for giving
America equal representation with
Great Britain in the league may come
before the senate any day now, and
moreover, the importance of the situa
tion there convinces me that my duty
for the present lies at Washington,
and this, notwithstanding the sugges
tion of my colleagues and the numer
ous and earnest requests which have
come to me from all the communities
of the west, I shall, therefore, return
to Washington at once with the hope
that, if conditions permit it, I may
again go to the people."

Despite the fact that the members
of the board of county supervisors and
the members of their newly appointed
highway commission met together yes
terday ina session which lasted for
more tha ntwo hours, no change in the
policy of either faction of the highway
battle ensued. The session-is declar
ed to have been exceedingly warm,
with every member of both sides more
than anxious to make his position
clear.
Supervisors Adams and Roberts de
clared after the meeting that they are j
still opposed to the retention of Ryan
as engineer of the commission. The
"gentleman's agreement," which hey
are skid to have had with the members
of te highway commission was ad

why Ryan should be ousted and they

find it impossible to accept their bonds
and install them in office.

IMPRESSARIO COMING.
Bemhyer, the impressario, who has
arranged the season's series of con
certs to be presented by the Musical
Events club of the Warren district,
Is expected to arrive here this week.
Mr. Behymer occupies an enviable
place among the managers of the
country, and at the present time is
honorary president of the national
association. The final arrangements
for the series will be made during
his stay here.
Any who have not secured tickets
for the series and are planning to
avail themselves 6 the wonderlui
opportunity to listen to programs ot
unusual merit are urged to attend to
the matter at once. This is positively
the last call. Tickets are at the Rey
nolds Music shop. Only a few to be
sure, but a sufficient number to as
sure the late comers of Beats. Thes
will be withdrawn this week ana
placed on sale at Douglas, whero
there is a demand for, them. The
committee feels, however, that" the
people of the district should have
the first chance and this is the rea
son for prolonging the sale until this
date. More than 425 tickets have
been sold up to the present time.-
Mrs. Andrew Sinclair and son, who
have been spending several months
in Nova Scotia, returned to their
home last week.
RED CROSS NEEDS CLOTHING.
The Red Cross shop is in need otl
clothing and other articles which" it
can turn into money for the treas
ury. This work has lost none of its
importance through the signing ot
the armistice, the work of the organi
zation .'having in no wayi been les
sened by the' ceasing: hostilities. It
has merely been a readjusting of the
effort,, the same amount being direct
ed Into other channels. More of the
money is being spent here in this
country for relief work than was pos
sible to expend during the war. Look
up your possible contributions help
the people here at home by giving
them a money value
CORPULENCY WILL BE COSTLY.
Woe to the person with the gener
ous waist measurement if he attends
the social at the Methodist church
Friday evening. A penney is to be
exicted for every inch recorded on
the tape which encircles the waist
line and the Ladies' Aid treasuo
hopes to wax fat thereby. It is &u
Apron social to be held at the church
at 7:30 o'clock, and the program
planned is most interesting. It will
be well worth while.
When the weather man says,
"Probably showers" he .makes a good
guess "moist" times;', as the New
Yorker would say. -

YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
BISBEE BOWLERS MEET.
A meeting of Bisbee Bowlers was
held on Wednesday night at which
there was a large, enthusiastic at
tendance. The following committee
was appointed for the season 1919
and 1920: Miss Florence Studley,
Miss Opal Core, Messrs. Wm. Brown,
George Meyer, T. S. WIckham, Frank
Brunning, Jim Atkinson, A. O. John
son. This committee will meet in
ten pins, five pins and three pins,
all of which are very exciting
games, and they invite anyone
whether a man or woman who wish
es to engage in this attractive r.port
to leave their names at the Y. M. C.
A. office. The bowling season is
now in full swing, and all old bowl
ers will gladly instruct anyone who
wishes to learn to . bowl if the.y
will indicate their desire to the
"man at the desk." The trophy cup
for individual contests between
Bisbee and Douglas, recently donat
ed by Mr. W. H. Brophy, togethei
with the trophy cup for the team
contests between Bisbee and Doug
las will prove the most exciting of
any contest ever held under the
auspices of the Y. M. C. A.
ART PICTURES RECEIVED.
The Association is in receipt and
has had framed six art pictures from
Mr.' Henry Perkins, a former much
esteemed member of the "Y" who
is now in overseas service. These
pictures are being installed in th
Woodlawn Singers, March 3rd.
Brooks Fletcher,. March 17th,
Laurant & Company, April 7th.
The special committee on this
list of. entertainers has spent con
siderable time in making a careful
study of the preferences in enter
tainment of the membership of the
association and believe they have
scheduled the best attractions pos
sible and that the presentation of
same will meet the enthusiastic ap
proval of the members and their
families. Ordinarily the cost for
admission into one of these enter
talnments alone would be $2.50, but
the committee, with the approval of
the board, have decided to admit
members with '; their, i families and
sweethearts free of, charge.
One will have but 'to glance over
the names of these attractions' to
know that this course alone will be
by far greater in value than the
lobby of' the building.
TO NEW ORLEANS
Mr. Chas. S. Hearn left for New
Orleans, La. during the first part
of this week. He will be greatly
missed by his friends in the lobby
of the "Y." , , .
SEC. THOMPSON RETURNS.
Mr. E. V. Thompson, director of
the Boys' department, returned
Wednesday after an absence of two
weeks, visiting with relatives in
Los Angeles.
LYCEUM SCENES ARRANGED.
The Y. M. C. A., through a spe
cial', committee, the members of
which are W. W. Gidley, C. F. Phil-
brook, ' F. E. Bennett, have been
very successful in arranging with
the Redpath Lyceum Bureau for a
series of "six entertainments to be
given during the season 1919-20 An

their families may reserve the re
spective dates as stated herewith:

Miss Gay Zenola MacLaren, Feb
ruary 24th.
ENJOYING VACATION
Messrs. H. E.; Ross and H. J.
Paul, teachers in the local schools
and active members o fth eassocia
tion, are together enjoying a two
weeks' vacation on the coast.
RETURNS TO ANNAPOLIS
Mr. Harry Harshman, who for the
past two weks has been visiting
with his parents. Rev. and Mrs. C.
W. Harshman, leaves today for Ar
napolis, where he returns to the
academy. Hisi many friends of the
"Y" wish him success in his naval
career.
ON VACATION N NORTH
Mr. J. T. Bowles, educational di
rector for the Hi-Y night school,
accompanied by his wife, left for
a two weeks' vacation in northern
Arizona. They expect to visit the
Roosevelt dam and other scenes of
interest in that part of Arizona.
BOYS DEPARTMENT
Teddy Wiskham, one of our mos
popular boys who paid a visit to
Los Angeles some time ago, has de
cided to make his home at that
coast city. Teddy says that he likes
Bisbee, but that "Jos" takes his
eye and he expects to stay a while.
We are losing some of our good
active members. William, Kurrle
and John Musso, who some weeks
ago left for the xoast. are going to
make their home' at San Francisco.
Kurrle and John, it will be. remem
bered, are the two- youthful boxers
who afforded the "Y" members more
than one good round of boxing and
laughter because , of their clever
ness. We hope t)iese boys like San
Francisco.
At a swimming contest held for
the older intermediates, Jerry Jong,
our most popular swimmer, broke
the Y. M. C. A. boys underwater
record by swimming 26 yards. This
beats Joe Cain, who heretofore held
the record by exactly 20 yards.
Jerry is some fish.
Our boys' secretary, Karl V.
Thompson, is back, after a vacation
of some few weeks at the coast.
He reports having had a gocd time.
Willie Benbow, one of our live
ly juniors, is back from Globe, where
he has been for the summer. Wel
come back, Willie, and we hope you
like that plunge after you have been
out of it so long.
William Matthes, our physical di
rector, has been conducting a se
ries of swimming contests among
the juniors and intermediates. He
thinks that there is some good ma
terial for . some real "fish" among
the Bisbee boys. There is only one
thing we need and that is a larger
and deeper plunge. Swimming and
diving are getting tame in this one.
But then it is better than no plunge
at all.
Percy Page, former assistant boys
secretary, visited Bisbee last week.
riClITES
BOWLING FOR GIRLS.
All teachers and girls who are inter
ested in' bowling have an opportunity,
through the courtesy' of the Y. M. C.
A., to use the alleys on Saturday
mornings, beginning next week. It
Is hoped that ' we may have some
good teams this winter and those who
wish to enter should register through
Miss Greeley as soon as possible.
LOSS TO BUSINESS GIRLS.
The Business Girls' club has losti
one of the most influential members,
Miss Irene Weimer, who has returned
east to live. Miss Weimer was the
club's representative during the re
cent Business Women's conference at
Asilomar, and she has also been a
great help in organizing the work
here. Her place as treasurer is be
ing filled by Miss Vergie Salmon.
The dance which was given by this
cliib at Warren park last week netted
J130, which will be used in further
ing the work during the winter.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW.
SILNDAY, SEPTEMBER 21, 1919.
. 1. 1. GUILTY
OF BRUTALITY
1
Fortified with a pad of paper and
a stub pencil, Dominic Cotero, pos
sessor of a notorious notebook ana
one of the, witnesses for the prosecu
tion in the deportation cases, made a
feeble attempt to defend himself yes
terday before Judge Hogan on ; a
charge of unmercifully beating and
abusing Carlota Bent, a quiet appear
ing little woman who is a tenant of
his, and who appeared in court with
four small children. The evidence
against him, however, was so over
whelming that he was found guilty
and fined $100. He immediately
gave notice of appeal.
, According to the police, Cotero en
tered the woman's home and cursed
and swore at her, using the most
abusive language, and then" threw
her across a bed and beat her. This
fact was corroborated by the woman
on the witness stand yesterday, as
also by her little son. Cotero was
arrested and released on bail. He
returned at once to the woman's
house and repeated the assault. The
little wife, who apparently must have
been as an infant in the hands of her
I. W. W. assailant, reported the af
fair to Chief J. A. Kempton with the
tears running down her cheeks.
Kempton arrested Cotero without
hesitancy. Yesterday, the woman
said that Cotero had made three tit
tacks upon her.
Cotero pleaded his own case with
a great amount of volubility, being
frequently warned by Judge Hogan
for the language he was using and
the tactics he was attempting to em
ploy. He is the fourth I. W. W. with
in a few days to be arrested for
child-snatching, woman-beating and
vagrancy.

My Dear Mrs. Hunt:
Recently it was my good fortune
to live . in the Y. W CV A. at Bis
bee for a limited time. I am so
pleased with the management of the
institution and -with Uie wholesome
spirit which prevails that 'I wish to
express-: my appreciation to the
board.
You are certainly to be "congratu
lated : upon having Mrs. Cummings
at the head of affairs. Her entire
interest, her . heart and soul are
with the girls with whom she comes
in contact and all feel that she ip
real genuine. I had little to occupy
my time, so observed, listened and :
it is very gratifying to tell you that i
not once did , I hear an utterance
that was not complimentary and ap-;
preciative. The wholesome, home-
like atmosphere sustains and en-'
courages the woman who is depriv-1
ed of the joy of her own home. !
Miss Greeley fulfills her part well. j
She is alive, alert and well-fitted,
for the part that is hers. Surely j
you are very fortunate in . securing
the services of such excellent wom
en; they are fortunate in having a
board that co-operates and encour
ages, for without co-operation there
is no harmony and without, har
mony there is no success.
It is a pleasure to know that such
a place as the Y. W. C. A. in Bis
bee exists and I am more than glad
to tell you that the efforts made
are appreciated and fruitful.
Most sincerely, ,

Original promoters received 525,(K)() shares for hold
ings and promotion, which was held in escrow by the
State Corporation Commission. There were sold 150,585
shares, the proceeds of which were about $12,000,000,
which was expended for the purchase of standard rig,
tools, casing and equipment, and sinking a water well,
and the erection of camp buildings.
After sinking, a 10-inch hole about 300 feet, the or
iginal promoters found themselves unable to continue
work. The' then asked for financial aid from the pres
ent board of directors, who agreed to re-finance the com
pany providing 425,000 shares 'of promotion stock were
. - ;, . returned to the treasury of the Company, for sale at 10c
per share, to put down the test well.
' , ,. . ' ;. ,
This was done, and this is the stuck now being sold.
The present directorate and stockholders are busi
ness men of Douglas and the Warren District; and they
-. . have, run-chased their stock at 10c per share, the same as
people now pureliasiiig.
The new management has purchased and have on
the ground, 500 feet of 14-inch casing and 1,000 feet of .
12-inch casing, and are pushing the work to completion.
The well is now down to a depth of 540 feet and the
12-inch casing is now set.
Three oil-bearing stratas have already been passed
tlirougli, which showed high gravity oil of parafine base.
S. E. Beck, our driller, who has had years of expe
rience, says the showings are ideal for striking oil in
commercial quantities.

We Have 4,500 Acres of Land Located in

Your Investment
The striking of oil in commercial quantities within
the next sixty or ninety days will make the stock now
purchased for 10c worth several dollars per share.

between the two cities, and from all
indications. It will bo '.R,e biscest
event of the series. More entries,
time, and bigger purses will combine
to make the desert race a real
desert classic, and to establish, it on
the calendar of sporting events of
the southwest, as an annual event.

event, the first race, in his Sim

in a little over 15 hours, averaging
30 and a fraction miles per hour.
and setting a record for cross

Phoenix. A year later in 1914, Hugh
Miller of Phoenix took first place,
doing the distance in 14 hours and
30 minutes, and setting a record of
37 1-2 miles an hour. In the first
race there were 21 entrtes, compe

second race there were 29 entries
and a purse of $7,100.
It is seldom that a sporting event
has the undivided support of busi
ness men. sport lovers, and good
roads boosters, such as has been
accorded the coming race in the
southwest. El Paso automobile men
dug up $2,000 to pay the expenses
of the race in a few hours. The
Automotive Trades and Highways
Department of the Chamber of
Commerce, subscribed $2,000 as El
Paso's end of the purse. The Bis
bee Automobile club through its
president J. R- Henderson.- guaran
teed $1,000 toward the purse. The
State Fair association of Phoenix
guaranteed $2,500 toward the purse.
Only Phoenix, Tucson and Douglas
have failed to come up to the
scratch, and there is no question
but what these cities will hold up
their end eventually.
COPPER OUTPUT
GIVES INCREASE
IN LAST MONTH
That the large copper mining com
panies are slowly but surely getting
their production back to normal, is
evidenced from a comparison of Au
gust production results with those
of several of the preceding months.
Thus far this month eight of the
more important companies have made
known their August production fig
ures. Every company except Calu
met & Arizona, showed an Increase.
Cerro de Pasco, East Butte and
Phelps Dodge outputted more cop
per last month than sine January,
New Carnelia and Arizona Copper
since February, while Anaconda, the
premier t producer of the country,
turned out more red metal in Au
gust than in any month since May.
The eight companies listed below
produced 42,780,491 pounds of cop
per last month, compared with 37.
882,495 pounds in July, an increase
of 4,S98,000 pounds, or about 13 per
cent. As compared with June the
combined output last month in
creased 6,262,000 pounds, or 17 per

WILL IT CAPTURE THE REPUBLIC N NOMINATION IN 1920?
"The political center or gravity in
the nation has shifted to the
states that U between the Missis
'slppi River Cnd the Pacific Coast."
New York Times editorial.
This opinion is typical of an Idea
which Is rapidly spreading through
out the country. There Is a feeling
that "the West Is In the saddle for
tbe presidential nomination In 1920.'
The fact that the West decided the
last presidential election has made
it a potent factor In future calcula
tions. Moreover, the politicians know
that In case the woman suffrage con
stitutional amendment does not be
come operative In time for the next
national election there are, neverthe
less, sixteen states west of tbe Mis
sissippi which have already given
their women the franchise, adding an
Increment of some six million votes,
which might easily turn the election
. one way or the other. Hence, the
Republican leaders of the East as
well as of the West are seriously
considering whether it would not be
good politics to take a western can
didate. It Is significant that three of the
most generally talked abont presi
dential possibilities for 1920 come
from the far West They are United
States Senators Polndexter, Borah
and Johnson. '
Tbe first mentioned, abont whom
considerable discussion Is now cen
tering, is from the state of Wash
ington. Though a native of Ten-!
nessee and graduate of a Virginia j
university, Polndexter chose the Pa
cific Northwest as his field for life
work, opening a law practice In
Walla Walla, Wash, in 1891. Later
be was judge of the superior court,
una attracted much tavuruoiu mu
tton by his judicial ability. In 1903,
Polndexter was elected as a repre
sentative from the state of Washing
ton to the Sixty-flrst- Congress. He
soon became known as an able, pro
gressive Itepubllcan. In the senate,
to which he was elevated In 1910,
he was a staunch advocate of meas
ures favoring the control and restric
tion of big corporations, especially of
the railroads. He sought tbe con
servation of all natural resources of
the country, including water power,
coal and oil lands. Before the war
he stood strongly for preparedness,
and later he vigorously supported all
measures of the administration for
the - protection of American rights.
He advocated throwing the whole
power of the nation Into the suc
cessful prosecution of the war.
Mr. Polndexter believes that Bol
shevism and all other movements de
structive of representative govern
ment and national spirit should be
strongly taken in hand and that
leaders In attempts to overthrow our
institutions should be severely pun
ished. He Is opposed to any scheme
for creating hybrid government of
the world whereby Europe and Asia,
In his opinion, would inevitably dom
inate this country and1 control its
policies..
Hiram Johnson, a native of Cali
fornia, was governor of the state be
fore he was chosen senator. . He Is
extremely popular In that common
wealth and will be strongly backed In
his fight for the Presidential. nomina
tion. 1 ,
Johnson was successful, after a
long struggle, In ridding California
of the domination of the Southern
Pacific. For years the political ma
chine of the railway held the state
viuun iia IiuIju, a'l.'l withnnt the
oanction and support f 'li'.s great
power candidates for -t:i i or Judi
cial offices could not !- elected.
Johnson, first as counsel for Interests
opposing the rnitrond rorporxtion
BDd later as governor. wnj;d bitter
and unremitting warfnre ngnlust rail
road domination. His tinnl victory
was a potent factor In his election to
tbe senate In 1916. Johnson Is a Re
publican, but generally regarded as
one of the radical type. He has. like
Polndexter, strongly opposed the
League of Nations.
Senator William E. Borah of Idaho
does not dlfTer greatly In the degree
of his achievements from the two
ether westerners. ' Born In Wayne
county, HL. Borah was educated In
the cenuson schools of that state and
at Kansas State University. He was
admitted to the bar. In 1890 and de
voted his time to legal practice until
his election to: the Senate In 1907.
Borah is one of the most active fig
ures in the United States senate. His
efforts largely have been directed to
ward the proper development of th
great natural resources of tbe coun
try, especially of the West. He Is,
known as a progressive Republican,
fearless In fighting for what he be-;
lieves to be right and, like the others
Included in this presidential group,
has : opposed from the start the"
League of Nations covenant. ;
From the Atlantic to the Pacific,
Coast Is a long jump for national pol
itics to take. However, all nreee.
dents, both .In business and politics,1
seem to be vanishing In these days
of remarkable readjustments, and thei
old theory that a Presidential candi-)
aate must necessarily come from east
of the Mississippi is no longer ten
able. . I

AUSTRIA FSCES
FUEL SHORTAGE
DURING WINTER
VIENNA, Sept. 20. Cool nights
and chill autumnal rains are begin-
nmg to bring Vienna ana all Austria,
face to face with the fuel famine
that looms along with the food short
age. Today this great city has a re
serve of only 9,000 tons. Not a hos
pital has been able to arrange Us
winter supply.
1 The government experts estimate
that with all available wood added to
the estimated coal supply the Vien
nese householder this winter may
have about seventy-five per cent of
enough fuel to keep one cooking fire.
No one talks -of heating. Warm
houses and hot water are among the
other luxuries unknown.
Czechoslovakia has coal for export
and contracts have been made by
the Austrians for all they can get,
but the delivery is slow and the
whole matter seems clouded with dif
ficulties . .And complications. It Is
believed means will be found to
maintain the j Inter-Allied Express
trains that now run three times a
week, but other railway and river
transport doubtless will ' be very
limited. .
The facultv of the University of
Arizona has recently added some val

ola, L. I., as a specialist in psychology
examinations.
,' Social Science
Graham A. Laing, who' conies to the
department, of 'Social-science.- is a
graduate and double prize man of the
University of Liverpool, Eng. Mr.
Laing was formerly connected with
the extension division of the Univer
sity of California and took a post

AMERICANIZATION SUNDAY OCT. 5
PROCLAIMED BY GOV. CAMPBELL
Designating Sunday, Oct. 5, as
"Americanization Sunday" and bring
ing attention to the great importance
of having every citizen of the state
assist in the task of helping foreign
ers to see and appreciate the value
of American citizenship and the
worth of American ideals, Gov. Thos.
E. Campbell has issued the following
proclamation:
To the People of Arizona:
No more important opportunity for
public service offers itself than the
Americanization of those foreign born
residents who may now be citizens
or have declared their intention to
become citizens. For" the welfare of
the republic it is necessary that they
shall be made to understand why the
English language must be made their
language. To insure that they shall
become civic assets of value, they
must be taught how our constitution
insures to each of them the same
chances for progress and for develop
ment, socially, morally and physi
cally, as are open to every other citi
zen, and assures them permanency In
the possession of any property they
may lawfully acquire. They must
be made to realize why Americana
Insist upon general education. They
must be shown the difference be
tween liberty and license.
Every good citizen will see ithe
necessity for his assisting in this
work in every way that is open to
of the University of Wisconsin and
of the Harvard Law School,, has
been secured as a professor of law.
Mr. Anderson practiced law for
many years in Wisconsin, was coun
ty attorney of Madison county for
seven years and a member of the
editorial staff of the West Publish
ing company of Minneapolis for 15
years.
School of Home Economics.
Mrs. Lulu R. Lancaster comes to
the School of Home Economics as
Professor . of Textiles and Clothing,
taking the place of Miss DeRosette
Thomas, who is on sabbatical leave.
Mrs. Lancaster is a graduate of In
dianapolis Manual Training School
and holds a diploma from the Teach
ers' College of New York City. She
is a teacher" of wide experience.
Miss Ada Van Steenberg, who has
been appointed assistant in thej
School of Home Economics, is a j
graduate of Wisconsin University
and the Louis Institute of Techno!-1
ogy of Chicago. She has had teach-
ing experience in the Chicago pub
lic schools and in Panama.
.OUTSIDE INTERFERENCE.
New York Times.
The employes of the steel corpora
tion or any other corporation should
have the right to determine for them
selves whether they want to belong
to the union or not. The liberty to
work without belonging to a union,
if one chooses not to belong to a
union, is a liberty that ought not to
be Interfered ,with or taken away.
According to tbe officials of the
United States Steel corporation and
the general public' belief, the major
ity of its workmen are satisfied with
the open shop, satisfied with the con
ditions of their employment. If that
is the case, what business have out
siders to interfere.
Boston finds that its street traffic
gets along quite well without traffic
policemen. That confirms the belief
of many persons that the traffic cop
takes himself much too seriously as a
rule. v '
OVER GROUND
him. Some can help with money,
some can help with service. Em
ployers can help with the men on
their payroll. Unions can help by
devoting thought to the better edu
cation of their foreign born members.
The churches can help through the
teaching of their pastors. In fact,
every social organization, secret so
ciety club and business association
can do something towards this move
ment, which will ultimately prove
America's best insurance against se
rious social disturbances.
Now, therefore, I, Thomas E. Camp
bell governor of the state of Arizona,
by virtue of the authority vested in
me by law and for the better and
more thorough discussion of this vi
tal problem, do designate and set
aside Sunday, October 5, 1919, as
"Americanization Sunday." I would
urge that on that day all the churches
of the state devote at least one ser
vice to an amplification of the great
need we have for the work at our
hand. I would further urge that they
unite in calling attention to meetings
to be held in that community later
in the week and that all unions or
ganizations and other association,
social and business, be urged to unite
at such meetings in perfecting plans
to better citizenship.
In witness whereof, I have hereun
to set my hand and caused the great
seal of the state of Arizona to be af
fixed. GOOD AND BAD MINORITIES
Springfield Republican.
Since Mr. Wilson is a student of
history, he presumably does not de
sire to have a literal interpretation
put upon his dictum at Kansas City:
"It does not make any difference
what kind of a minority governs you
if it is a minority." For the mi
nority to govern has been the rule
rather than the exception, but some
times it has governed well and
sometimes badly.

YOUR chances of winning are like
the , fellow who plays the field
against the favorite horse at the
irace track. Some of the Com
pany's acreage ought to be in the
$25,0C0 an acre class one of these
days and think of over 2500
acres scattered in all the fiplds.
The fellow who plays all the field
buys a little, if possible of all
the stocks is the fellow who wins
in the oil game. If you have put
$25 or $50 in five to tei of the
Texas oil stocks, you are the one
today who is realizing some hand
some nrofits.
Here are some astonishing facts
which you cannot get away from:
YOUR CHANCES OF WINNING
IN THE OIL GAME ARE 78 PER
CENT. "From 1912. to July 1,
1919, there was a total of oil wells
drilled of 6,177. Or i'u.s numDer
4,667 wells produced oil or gas.
The percentage was 76 per cent.
This covers a period of seven
years. In the last year and a half
1918, to July 1, 1919, the total
wells drilled was 2,989. The wells
which produced, 2355, making 78
per cent. This shows that there
are close to four producing wells
out of every five wells drilled.
It's the man who doesn't know
the facts who warns you against
oil companies as being entirely
speculative. It is only natural
that the big interests of the oil
game spend thousands of dollars
in publicity warning the public
not to buy they want it alL Texas
has made millions for the little in
xestor the little operator. Fifty
or a hundred dollars has made
many a fortune in Texas.
Tne ALL-FIELDS OIL & LEAS
ING COMPANY, which plays all
the fields, is capitalized for only
$300,000. Any one of its 40-acre
tracts may be worth the entire
capitalization, for no one can place
a valuation on their leases. Mil
lions may be derived from the de
velopment of these leases no
one knows. The chances you
take in this company are the same
that . you take in any company,
-and we believe that we have dem
onstrated that four companies out
of five are producers.

TUCSON, Sept. 20. Charles M.
Schwab, steel magnate of New York
and Pittsburgh, has bought the min
eral rights to the whoie of the Baca
Float, according to a rumor current
in Nogales yesterday, which is gen
erally accepted as having a basis of
truth. '
Should the rumor. be verified, the
development of the rich mineral re
sources of the Float' is assured and
all the old mines in the Float will
be again in active operation. '
Mr. Schwab is not a newcomer in
the southwest, for he has made 4 a
number of profitable investments
here and has a wider knowledge of
mining than is popularly known. He
has been operating a property across
the line from Hachita, N. M., for a
'number of years, making good prof
its all during the border trouble.
Should Mr. Schwab, take up the
development of the hardly scratched
resources of the Baca Float the

NEW DISTRICT
IN OKLAHOMA
HAS PRODUCER
A RDM ORE, Okla., Sept. 20. The
first well to be completed in the Gra
ham district is that of the Healdton
Petroleum company and C. R. Smith
in section 31-2s-2v. The well is es
timated as good, for 250 barrels of oil
from a 72 foot broken oil sand.
In the Fox district the Humble Oil
and Refining company's well in the
northeast corner of section 34-2s-3w,
is making 20,000,000 cubic feet of gas
from a depth of 900 feet.
The No. 2 Denney farm well, in sec
tion 27-4o-2v, at a depth of 1,505 feet,
is showing for a good producer. The
Jo. 1 Laura Nolen farm well,' in sec
tion 2S-4s-2w, west of the Hewitt dis
covery well, is producing at a depth
of l,o2 feet. Both wells are owned
by the Texas company.
The Carter Oil company's No. 2,
on the Tucker farm' district, section
29-2s-3w, is drilling in the blue shale
formation at a depth of 2,600 feet.
which is below the depth at which
wells on adjoining property encoun
tered the pay sand.
On the Williams farm, in the south
west quarter of the northeast quarter
of section 34-2s-w, the Empire Gas and
Fuel company well is drilling at a
depth of 1,725 feet.
Near the southeast corner of the
Foutiiwest quarter of section 31-2s:2w,
half a mile south of the discovery
well in the Graham district, George
Chaffee is drilling at a depth of 700
feet. A prolific gas sand was en
countered in this test at a depth of
400 feet. It is the purpose of the
operators of this welf to drill to the
depth of the Johnson well, 2,285 feet,
unless a paying quantity of oil should
be encountered at a lesser depth.

WINSLOW, Ariz., Sept. 20. Al
though there are now six rigs up and
four in actual, operation, the big in
terest is the fact Special Geologist
gist Fred Craise .representing the Al
len Oil company interests, has high
ly recommended this structure of Na
vajo county,' just south of the Santa
Fe main line. "
The Windriver Production and Re
fining company has again begun drill
ing, after a delay of nearly a month,
prepared to go' to 4,000 feet. It is
also stated-the4 company is amply
financed to drill four more welljs even
should the first prove a duster.
The Hollbrobk Gil company ft mak
ing better progress than any other
company did at this stage. .Not yet
through the (joconino sandstone, this
well is not yet 400 feet.
' The Black Canyon Oil company, the
only rig operating on the western sec
tor, just south of.Winslow, is mak
ing good progress, even . better than
expected by Superintendent McClps:
key.
.The Alamana well is now flrilling
in bluish shale, with., considerable oil
signs, at a depth of 1.8C0 feet. This
well has recently had some gas show
ings.
: There are two more rigs being
erected, and .several smaller compa
nies organized, but the real big inter-
et is in the big companies that prom
ise to drill this field.. . .
The Hurst and Koeughan. Drilling
company, of Denver, is .the latest to
show interest on the fields- Geologist
W. - Carlton Packard has made a
thorough examination of the field,
particularly the holding of the Wins
low Oil company, and some private
holdings -as submitted to him by E.
Juilan Harbin. Mr. Packard talks
very encouragingly.

GREAT BRITAIN
LONDON, Sept. 20. British in
dustrial interests view with alarm
the gaining of a foothold by Ameri
can exporters in the coal market of
France and Denmark. Industrial dis
putes in Great Britain have given
American dealers an opportunity to
obtain huge orders in quarters for
merly supplied-exclusively by South
Wales mines. '
American dealers are said to have
contracted for the delivery of over
100,000 tons of coal in France ana
negotiations are now under way for
an additional half million tons. One
or two cargoes of American coal al
ready have been laid down in Den
marie' a3' sample shipments, orders
for Vhich were placed last Mar-ch
during the strike in England, it is
stated. The price was said to be
$2.50 per ton lower than the English
price at that time. '
Th iron and steel industries of
England also are said to feel that
their outlook is not very hopeful be
cause of opportunities . afforded
American competitors through the cur

) "I believe I'm the happiest woin
jan in California today, and it's all
; because of what Tanlac has done
for me," said Mrs. EuKt-uc Smith,
residing at 680 West 52nd street.
Los Angeles, in conversation with
the Tanlac representative, who had
; heard of her remarkable recovery
J and had called at her home to ob
jtain the facts.- Mrs. Smith is 'an
I officer in the Eastern Star and ojh
' or lodges and is very prominent so-
cially. Her husband holds a re
sponsible position with the Soutli
' ei n Pacific railroad.
When asked If she objected hav
ing her statement' published Mrs.
Smith said: ' "No. indeed, go right
iihyail and put it in the papers
i it would be ungrateful "not - to tell
other suffering people about this
' wondo'f.ul medicine." Continuing
.the taid:
i "For six i ears I tuflered iroin a
complication of troubles, which fi
nally developed into a. general break
down. I had awful pains around
my heart' which I was told was
caused -by pleurisy. ' ' My kidneys
seemed to be affected, too, and I
had constant pains fn my back. My
neck and shoulders would gel stiff
at times and my limbs would swell
and ache so I could hardly walk.
I was told once that my trouble was
caused by the condition of my
teeth, so I went to a dentist and
had them all treated, but I got ab
solutely no relief. I took all kinds
of medicine and treatments, but just
continued to get worse all the time
and I hardly ever had a minute's
peace. I was so nervous that evn
the ringing of ttie door bell would
completely upset me, and it seemed
impossible to get a good night's
sleep. I was losing strength rapidly
and fell off until I only weighed
onek hundred pounds. Finally my
condition got so bad . they took me
to, the hospital and I stayed there
bix weeks, but 1 didn't seem to im
prove in the least. I was brought
back home, and had just about lost
all hope, when a friend of mine sug
gested that J take Tanlac. I didn't
see how it or any other medicine
could help me after everything else
had failed, but I consented to try
it, and it is simply wonderful what
this medicine did for me. I began
to feel better after the first few
dotes. My nerves became calm and
I could sleep better. As I contin
ued taking the medicine all the
pains in my back, sides, shoulders
and. . limbs " disappeared, and my
strength was returning rapidly. By
the time : I had taken four bottles
of Tanlac I felt as well and strong
as I ever did in my life, and when
I got on the scales I was surprised
to see that I had actually gained
eighteen pounds. My kidneys seem
to be in perfect condition, and I'm
like a different woman. All ray
friends and neighbors are talking
about my wonderful improvement,
because they knew of the dreadful
condition I was in before taking
Tanlac. My husband is just as
happy over my improvement as I
am, and says Tanlac is the most
wonderful thing he ever heard of.
The results from Tanlac must be
permanent, for it has been four
months since I took my last dose,
and I feel as well now as I did
then. If everybody knew what a
fine medicine Tanlac is (here would
be less suffering in this world."

D'ANNUNZIO'S BEST SELLER j
THE fall of Fiume promises to take rank as one of the greatest
literary triumphs in history. Troy was nothing to it, while
Horatius at the bridge will now be seen to have entire ovei
looked the dramatic possibilities of the situation. Marsbai
Ney, of lamented memory, had his chance when he met Napoleon
in the road, but Ney was slow and Napoleon got his breast bare,
first. No wonder the French shot Ney. The Latins can counten
ance a military but not a literary debacle.
But in contemplating the surpassing merits of D'Annunzio's best
seller we must not forget that both he and General Pittaluga, the
defender of Fiume, are Italians. If the latter had been an Austrian
D'Annunzio probably would have used a different model. But Pit
taluga knew D'Annunzio's poetry by heart, perhaps even understood
what it meant. He knew when he marched out of the city what a
hard thing it would be to shoot a poet.
Campbell, the English poet, once drank a toast to Napoleon at
a London dinner and was nearly mobbed until he explained tna.
Napoleon had shot a bookseller. But D'Annunzio Is not a booksellei.
The general ought not to have gone out. Being an Indian he knew
he could not shoot a poet, an artist or an opera .singer. Knowing
himself to be at a disadvantage he nevertheless tries to do his duty.
That is to say, he makes a speech. Ah, yes, he was an Italian..
General Thus you will ruin Italy.
Poet Rather will you ruin Italy if you oppose Fiume's destiny.
General I must obey orders.
Poet Fire first ftpon me.
With a gesture we may imagine D'Annunzio performs that mo
tion poetically known as baring the breast. Actually it does not
involve, with the best artists, the removal or even the disarrange
ment of any portion of the raiment. Rather it is the swift and ex
pressive touching of the breast with the tips of the fingers of both
hands and the throwing open of the arms. After that no poet would
insult his art by saying "Shoot!"
General Brave soldier! Grand poet! With you I cry "Viva
Fiume!"
D'Annunzio and the general fall into each other's arms and the
League of Nations has another job on its hands.
JUNKING THE CHEMISTS
THE chemists of America have just held a convention at Philadel
phia. They have returned to their homes firm in the beliet
that if the war department does not change its attitude toward
the chemists this nation will be in a serious position if it hap
pens to become involved in war again.
Secretary Baker attended the convention and made a remarkably
good address, but he could not .be changed from his purpose of-pui-ting
the chemical division of the army under control of the engineer
ing staff.
The chemists say this is fatal. Engineering is distinctive. So
is chemistry. It would be as foolish, they assert, to put the en
gineers under direction of .the chemists as the chemists under the,
engineers, g The engineers have no understanding of or sympathy for
the chemical end of warfare and to try to join the two must bring
poor results.
It is the belief of the chemists that chemistry will play a far
greater part in warfare hereafter than it did before and much more
than it did in the world war. For America not to be abreast if not
In advance of any other nation in this branch would be to risk ap
palling costs, they say, and America will not keep abreast of other
nations unless the government appreciates the importance of chem
ical research and gives .every opportunity to the chemist instead
of making him subordinate to departmental bureaucrats.
I THE SPREAD OF BOSTON STRIKE
WE SEE that the brewery workers, the bottlers, the drivers ot
brewery wagons and the bartenders of Boston have all voted
for a sympathetic strike with the Boston policemen. Wei:
what can they do about it? How will Boston suffer for lacs
of beer which the whole country has been forbidden to drink? And
what difference will it make to Boston if the bartenders abstain
from a service which the law has declared to be unlawful? This is
the one bright feature in the Boston affair. In a fit of spite these
various unions have voted to observe the law.
Let 'em strike. They ought to be compelled to strike all ovei'
the country or go to jail. We should like to see the Boston s1ViUe
become so general as to include the pickpockets, the housebreakers,
the gamblers, ' the bootleggers and all other industries which have
been discountenanced by law.
"The strike was always an argument ad terrorem," says the
Boston Christian Science Monitor, in a learned editorial labeled,
"Salus Populi." It is at least as bad as that when the police force
strikes in classic Boston.
Why didn't the embattled fo;es of Harvard university get after
these cops with an "argumentum ad honiinem," and tell them "vox
populi, vox Dei,' and thus gently give them to understand that such
rouglit stuff is abhorrent alike to Heaven and the Hub?
The wheat crop has shrunk considerably from last summer's
estimates. Still there will be enough to feed the American people,
with 300.000.000 bushels or so left over for export. And so we're
safe enough if the grain gamblers don't hide or export more than
300,000,000 bushels.
Will there bo self-determination for the American Indians under
the League of Nations, too? Oh, no! They are taken care of in tne
reservations.

AND ONCE or twice.
IT SEEMED to me. ,
THAT HE was.
RIGHT CLOSE to me;
AND I let out
A GENTLE snore.
AND HE seemed satisfied.
AND MOVED over.
TOWARD THE dressing table.
AND FINALLY.
MY WIFE could stand it.
1
NO LONGER.
AND SHE said:
"IF YOU don't hurry up. " ,
-
"AND PUT out that pup.
"I'M GOING.
"TO PUT him out myself."
AND I couldn't pretend.
THAT I was asleep.
ANY LONGER.
SO I got up.
-
AND FOUND him.
AND GRABBED him.
-
BY THE back of the neck.
AND PUT him.
OUT OF doors.
AND WENT back. r
-
TO BED again.
AND WENT to sleep.
I THANK you.
Turning Back the Calendar
Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(Trom the Bisbee Daily Review of September 21, 1903.)
Rathbone Lodge No. 10 will lay
the cornerstone of the new Pythian
castle today that is being built on
O. K. street. Many visiting Knights
throughout the territory are here to
participate in the ceremonies. This
is the first lodge building to be er
ected in the city. When completed
it will be one of the most impos
ing structures in the city.
Judge Webster Street of Phoenix
is in the city as the guest of Rath
bone lodqe No. 10. He will deliver
the oration at the laying of the cor
nerstone of the temple. Webster
Street, ex-chief justice of this ter
ritory, is an old citizen of Cochise
county, and was a resident of Tomb
stone as far back as 1879, when
Bisbee was inhabited by a few pros
pectorss among whom was George
Warren, the father of the camp, and
who gave the rich mining district
around Bisbee its name.
Major Burton has returned from
the Huachuca mountains after an
absence of four months. The major
returns Trom his outing much re
freshed and has again taken up his
residence in Bisbee.
The private car, Nacozari, with
Professor James Douglas., daughter
and party on board, reached Bisbee
today.
From an editorial The Albuquer
que Journal Democrat is a red-hot
advocate of the joining of Arizona
and New Mexico and their admis
sion as one state into the Union.
It says: "We may as well face the
fact that we can be admitted to
statehood jointly by the next con
gress but cannot get in singly for
many years to come.
Although Senator Clark's United
Verde mine at Jerome is the most
talked of and written-about copper
mine in the Territory of Arizona,
the Copper Queen mine at Bisbee is
the largest producer and will soon
be making more copper than ever
before, as the new smelter wiH en
able, the mine to produce to some
thing like Us capacity. For sev
eral years the Queen has held fourth
place in the United States and sixth
place among the mines of the world
as a producer and last year made
nearly 400,000 pounds of refined copper.
WHAT. OTHER PAPERS SAY
"UP TO THAT TIME"
New York Sun.
In his speech at St. Paul Presi
dent Wilson, speaking of tho vete
rans of the Civil war, said: "Now,
mind you. I was born and bred in
the South, but I can pay that tri
bute with all my heart to the men
who saved the Union. It ought to
have been saved. It was the great
est thing that men had conceived
up to that time." "Up to that
time!" The cautious phrase un
doubtedly was added lest some ig
norant fellow in the audience go
away with the impression that the
establishment of the United 1 Slates
was an event as momentous as the
creation on paper of Mr. Wilson's
league of nations.
criminals this iolice strike has boon,
it is a stern and salutary admoni
tion. It is an experiment station
of the exotic revolutionary ideas
that have been imported into the
United States. It must end, as all
such experiments must end here,
not only with vindication of the
law, but in a profounder general
sense of the necessity of giving no
truce or compromise to those who
put. the union, the consensus of a
few, or by a few million individual
wills, desires and interests, above
the desire, interest nnd will of the
public expressed in law executed un
flinchingly ( by public officers faith
ful to their functions.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept. 20. Declaration
of the steel strike, effective Monday,
was the paramount influence of a very
unsettled week in the stock market.
There wer occasional wide fluctua
tions in equipments, tobaccos, motors
and other speculative Issues 01 less
definite description, but those move
ments attracted little attention.
Respecting the disturbed labor sit
uation there was. a feeling that the
walkout of the steel workers might yet
be averted, although surface indica
tions at the week-end offered little
hope for it.
In the trade the impending strike
caused widespread regret, the more so
that larger contracts for fabricated
steel and iron products were in pro
gress, and the mills were operating
almost at capacity production.
The domestic and international
money markets presented striking
contrast, time funds for home use
showing an easier tone, while ex
change continued to move more un
favorably against France, Italy, Ger
many and Austria. .
The investment situation indicated
marked Improvement, this being espe
cially noticeable in the great strength
and activity of Liberty and Victory
bonds.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. 20. Apparent cer
tainty; that the steel workers' strike
would not be averted put corn today
under bearish control. Prices closed
unsettled, c to lc net lower with
December $1.22 to $1.22 and May
$1.20 to $1.20. Oats lost c to
lc. Provisions finished unchanged
to $1.10 down.
Free selling of corn by speculators
and commission houses quickly devel
oped and values broke about 2c be
fore the market encountered any ade
quate support. The majority of trad
ers took but little notice of other fac
tors than the impending giant distur
bance of the steel industry. It was
in vain that bull leaders pointed out
the upward adjustment of wages in
the Chicago building trades and strove
to emphasize the strength of the hog
market,
Oats were depressed in sympathy
with corn.
Provisions tended sharply down
ward for the same reason.

ENTERING El OF PROSPERITY
MIAMI, Sept. 20. Among the pro
ducing companies in the district pro
duction remains the same as in re
cent weeks, running about two-thirds
of capacity. Probably more copper
is being produced now than at any
tme during the past few months ow
ing to the starting up of the Old Do
minion smelter and the blowing in
of the third reverberatory at the In
ternational smelter. The conditions
in this district are similar to those
throughout the United States In the
copper industry.
Production bangs around two
thirds capacity with a slight in
crease from month to month.
Consumption about equals produc
tion as near as can be determined,
the price ranging from 22 cents to
24 cents per pound, F. O. B. New
York City, depending on the amount
purchased and date of delivery. The
lower price is that at which some
small sales have been made by inde
pendent dealers for immediate de
livery, while the larger agencies are
asking up to 24 cents for October de
livery. Most of the inquiries are for
domestic use. Foreign demands are
light probably due to unsettled con
, ditions in exchange.
Of special interest to people in
this district is that while production
fej below normal, everything points
to all of the producing companies
getting their plants in shape to pro
duce maximum tonnage when the
time is propitious for so doing.
Inspiration Consolidated is prepar
ing to overhaul their tipples on the
six hundred level. Thi3 will be t
big Job and will consume about two
weeks time. These tipples are used
for the unloading of the ore from under-ground
haulage trains into the
shaft pockets, and are subject to
severe and continuous usage. Ins
piration is running ten sections of
their concentrator and producing at
the rate of approximately six ana
one-half million pounds of copper per
month.
Miami Copper company is running
at about two-thirds capacity. Old
Dominion production will show an in
crease this month owing to the start
ing up of the smelter. ,
Iron Cap will also show an in
crease due to the completion of the
installation of the new hoisting
equipment allowing the handling of
a greater tonnage.
Irpn Cap expects to start shipping
concentrating ore to the Inspiration
concentrator next week, where one
section will be devoted to the mill
ing of the Iron Cap ore.
Besides getting their mines and re
duction works in shape, all the pro
ducing companies are making or plan
ning extensive improvements which
points to increased activity in the
district in the future- -i
Miami has completed the sinking of
their No. 5 .re inforced concrete shaft
and are now at work installing the
necessary . buildings and machinery
Tor the operation of same. This will
include an , electric hoist driven by
an induction motor for the operation
of the cage. Also the ore hoist which
will also be electrically operated.
This hoist will probably- be of the
Ilgner type.
A modern change room will be
erected near this shoft.
Old Dominion has been engaged In
the deepening of their main shaft
for the prospecting and working of
their lower levels, and while hamper
ed by the enormous inflow of water,
this work has progressed very satis
factorily. Developments at the low
er horizons of the mine are very
favorable.
While to - date, - the prosperity or
the district has been dependent on
our wonderful producers, neverthe
less, it is the mines In the develop
ment stage, that will give it a great
er degree of wealth and add years to
its life. '
The Castle Dome situated to the
northwest are prospecting their
ground on Porphyry mountain. They
are churn-drilling and are now on
their sixth hole.. While no figures
are available as to assay values and
tonnages, nevertheless, it is under
stood that the results obtained are
favorable. " '
Porphyry Consolida'ted are develop
ing their property in the western, ene
of the district and have achieved
some very favorable results to date.
It is understood that they have good
tonnage of ore blocked out. though
actual figures are not available at
this time. . ,
Van Dyke Copper company, which
discontinued drilling during the war
owing to the Inability to get neces
sary steel products are now develop
ing their property and whl add an
other producer to the district as sooai
as their shaft reaches the ore-body
for which they are sinking.
This ore-body which was found
near the boundary of the Miami Cop-,
per company by drilling operations In
1917 was penetrated to a depth of
40 feet before the drill-hole was
abandoned due to the losing of tfte
drilling string in the hole. .
Core' samples taken from this hole
shows 40 feet of ore averaging 1 per
cent copper.
The putting of the Van Dyke cop
per in the producing class will mean
a great deal to the district as a whole
and to the town of Miami in particu
lar, as the mine is partially in the
town proper and the shaft Just out
side the city limits.
Good progress is being made in the
sinking of the shaft which is now
355 feet deep.
It is not the intention of the com
pany to resume drilling operation lu
the near future as it ia the intention
of the management to confine Its
energies to underground operations,
working 'from the new shaft.
Taking everything into considera
tion, the Miami-Globe district is Just.

which will rival that succeeding the
original discovery of the disseminat
ed ore bodies at Miami.

August we received more than 700
letters from firms who Intimated In
tentions of establishing branches

"The end of the war has brought
sharp competition for Mexican busi
ness. It is interesting to note in
this connection that sentiment is
giving way to sound business in deal
ing. with the Germans. It will be re
membered that during the war a re
ferendum vote of chamber of com
merce members favored a commer
cial boycott of Germany after the!
war. This has been forgotten here
and German firms, who are. conceded
to have the firmest hold on the hard
ware business in the republic, are
buying practically all of their supply
from American dealers. Japanese
competition Is negligible."
A strenuous effort is being made
I to stabilize transportation conditions

TRADE BETWEEN 0. S.
-INCREASES DESPITE MDITIONS
MEXICO CITY, Sept. 20. Despite
conditions , popularly regarded in the
United States as uninviting to Ameri
can trade expansion here, business
between that country and Mexico
shows a decided upward trend. Dur
ing the fiscal year Just closed im
ports and exports between the two
republics amounted to more than
531,000,000 pesos, according to fig
ures given the Associated Press by
W. F. Saunders, secretary . of the
American Chamber of Commerce In
Mexico City.
Of this amount 376,000,000 pesos
represents exports from Mexico and
164,000,000 pesos represents imports.
Previous to the current fiscal year,
the banner period of Mexico-United
States business was in 1911 when
102,000,000 pesos worth of goods
were exported from Mexico and 146,-
000,000 pesos worth were imported.
"Deducting amounts representing
petroleum exportatlons which are not
considered in the ordinary run of
commercial business, and for increased-
values of goods, these figures-indicate
clearly that trade Is in
creasing," said Mr. Saunders. "Mex
ico will spend "more than $150,000,000
