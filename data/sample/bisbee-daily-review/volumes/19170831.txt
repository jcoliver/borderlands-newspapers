ay SHIPS OF
American Warships Are Con
voying Shipping Across the
Atlantic Airplanes Aid in
Fighting Submarine Menace
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 30. Ameri
can naval forces are convoy
ing merchant craft across the
Atlantic it was disclosed offi
cially today at the navy department
and examination of the records show
that the loss of convoyed ships by
submarines averaged less than one
half of one per cent. Details of the
convoy system are withheld. It was
stated, however, that American war
vessels are regularly escorting fleets
of Britsh, French or other allied mer
chantmen, the protection being sup
plemented when the danger zone Is
reached.
Checking Sub Menace
American naval officials believe that
an effective system for checking the
submarine menace is being built up
gradually but certainly.
Many devices and many methods
enter into the task. Among other
things, depth bombs are proving ef
fective. Official reports indicate that Ameri
can destroyers have accounted for!
several U-boats with these weapons. I
No announcement of such incidents
will be ' made, however, unless abso
lute proof of the fact is available.
No Boa,j Captured
No U-boat has been captured by the
Americans. It is the best judgment
of high officials, however, that several
have been sunk by Admiral Sim's de
stroyers and they are confident that
me suDmanne menace win oe sud-i
stan dally abated as the number of
destroyers and other craft available
for the work is increased.
Work Far at Sea
Reports from London that submar
ines are working farther at sea than
formerly were confirmed by the navy
department. It may be that .new
boats of greater size and best sea
keeping qualities lend to this exten
sion of the zone of activities, but it
is regarded as more probable that the
increased vigilance of the anti-sub-mariae
forces is mainly responsible.
Airplanes Aid Patrols
The effect of the increasing patrol
of the employment of airplanes and
of the addition of new devices to the
anti-submarine weapons has been to
force the U-boats under water to a
greater degree. Their effectiveness
is limited in proportion. They con
not run down a merchant chip of av
erage speed if kept under water. They
can operate only against ships that
almost stumble upon them. All the
time they are under water they are
consuming the stored power of their
storage batteries, decreasing their
range of water action and compelling
them to come up at night and lie idle
on the surface while their oil engines
are used to recharge their batteries.
Swift Ships Needed
The decision of the navy depart
ment to spend 1350,000,000 on new
destroyers and destroyer-building fa
cilities, approved yesterday by Presi
dent Wilson, is based on the effective
ness of the swift boats as proved by
Admiral Sims' forces.
Every effort to speed the new pro
gram as well as the old will be made
and during the next year the Ameri
can destroyer force in European wat
probably can be more than doub-'
led.
Ships Rushed
Destroyers now under construction j
are being rushed to completion and
reports on progress are satisfactory.
American experts have developed a
depth bomb for use against submar
ines that is deadly at considerable
range. The bomb containing high ex
plosive is dropped from a destroyer
over a spot where the presence oi -submarine
is indicated. It is timed
to explode at a certain depth. If the
explosion occurs below the U-boat and
within a reasonable distance, the pull
of the underwater craft cannot with-
stand the pressure but is crushed like;
an eggshell-.

Message From Japan
(By Review Leased Wire)
WAHINGTON, Aug. 30. A message of fellowship and good will
from Japan was delivered to the senate today by Viscount Ishil, am
bassador on a special mission, with an assurance that Japan is in the
war to stay and to fight shoulder to shoulder with America to a cer
tain victory.
In a tribute to Thomas Jefferosn and the American ideal of life.
Viscount Ishii told the senators that the Japanese ideal of notional
life in its final analysis was not so very far removed from theirs.
"We conceive of our nation as a vast family." he said, "held to
gether not by the arbitrary force of armed men, but by the force of
a national development."
The ambassador and other members of the mission were received
on the floor of the senate with formal ceremony by Senator Saulsbury,
president pro tern in the absence of Vice President Marshall. His
address, read in English, frequently was interrupted by hearty ap
plause from senators and spectators.
PAUSE HAD UPON
WESTERN FRONT
OF ALLIES WORK
British General Tells of Neces
sary Pause in Fighting in
the West Points Out Suc
cesses and All Failures Had
(Bv Review Leased Wlrei
LONDON, Aug. 30 The last week
has been marked by a pause on all
the western front a pause which was
inevitable after the great successes
of the previous week, a pause accen
tuated by the bad weather that af
fected the operations all the way from
the North sea to the Italian sea coast,
said Major General F. B. .Maurice,
chief director of British military op
erations at the war office in his week
ly talk to the Associated Press today.
Italian Front Active
"At the moment it is the Italian
front where the situation is the most
interesting. Here also, after a really
important advance, there now comes
a pause pending the readjustment of
the artillery positions. There is much
more to be done during these pauses.
The problem is whether General Ca
dorna will be able to get his guns
posted for renewal of the operations
before the Austrians get up adequate
reserves, some of which are being
brought from the Russo-ilumanian
front. This is the problem in the
pauses in all these battles the race
between the reparations of offense
and defense.
In Flanders
"In Flanders the process of wear
ing down the Germans by continuous
bombardment, continuous air fighting
and continuous infantry raids, is be
ing kept up and is having a far great
er effect than is generally realized.
This effect is shown in the constant
necessity imposed on the Germans of
wondering and replacing units.
First Phase
"We now are in the first phase of
the Flanders battle. We are meeting
with good success the German re
serves and later will come the sec
ond phase to which we are all look
ing forward confidently. '
Russia the Weak Spot
"On the Russian front there has
been another regrettable incident.
namely the voluntary withdrawal of
certain Russian units near Czerno
witz. This was negligible but it serves
to show, in conjunction with Goicral
Komiloffs speech, the state to which
the Russian army has come and makes
it even more remarkable that the
Germans have been unable to achieve
more.
Attack Fail
"On the Rumanian front Field Mar
shal von Mackensen's attack failed
owing to the gallant Rumanian r.tand
arrd the necessity of Austrian with
drawals to the threatened Italian
front.
German Propaganda
"In the last month I have received
a remarkable number or letters from
the United States showing hrw wide-
spread is the belief that the British
have let the allied and colonial troops
do the most of their fighting. This is
pJH of the German propaganda in the
'Urited States. I have prepared for
you a few statistics to show how far
this is untrue.
Br'tish Troops Predominate
"At the present moment the Brit
ish troops In France are six. to one as
compared with tall overseas troops
and the total casualties in France
throughout the war have been In the
proportion of 6.5 British to one over
seas. In Ypres-Lens fighting since

British to one colonial."

AGREEMENT IS
REACHED UPON
WAR TAX Bill
Threat to Impose Cloture Rule
Enables Senate Leaders to
Secure 4 Agreement to Vote
on Entire Measure Sept
ember 10
'By Review Leased Wire).
w
ASHINGTON, August 30. An
agreement was reached by the
senate late today to take a
final vote on the war tax bill
not later than Monday, September 10,
and the cloture petition filed yester
day was withdrawn.
Agreement Made.
The agreement also provides for dis
position of the war profits section not
later than Wednesday of next week
and of the income tax provisions not
later than Friday, September 7. It
provides further for earlier action if
the debate ends sooner than expected.
The agreement was reached after the
day of spirited debate between Sena
tors Simmons and Underwood on war
profiits, after much negotiation over
details and after one senator had
blocked an effort to set next Monday
ns the day for a vote. If the debate
runs through until September 10, the
bill will have beenj under senate dis
cussion just one mouth. It passed
the house May 23.
Cloture Petition Dropped.
Once before at this session, on the
food control bill, cloture was initiated
and dropped by mutual agreement for
final disposition. The cloture petition
cn the war tax measure was to have
been voted on tomorrow. Its propon
ents were confident today of their
strength, but overtures for the voting
agreement came from those leading
the fight for higher tax rates, with all
concerned anxious To avoid imposition
of cloture.
Anticipating possible adoption of
cloture, many amendment were intro
duced late in the day.
Senators Hollis, Gore and Brady
sponsored provisions to increase the
war profits levy to rates ranging from
50 to 66 2-3 per cent.
Simmons Takes Lead.
Today's debate was occupied large
ly . by Senator Simmons, chairman.
of the finance committee, and Sena
tor Underwood, former bouse leader
and revenue expert. In a three-hour
speech the latter vigorously criticised
the committee's war profits plan and
Senator Simmons, with show of much
feeling, defended the plan and attack
ed Senator Bankhead's substitute,
supported by Mr. Underwood.
"Money Slackers."
Denouncing "money slackers" Sen
ator Underwood said the committee's
war profits scheme would work many
Injustices, exempt many large corpora
tions earnings. He opposed principal
ly the graduated rates and the bases
of calculating profits.
While the Bankhead substitute bas
ed on actual value of invested cap
ital, is estimated to raise $589,000,000
as compared with $1,060,000,000 from
the committee plans as increased by
the so-called compromise amendments
presented yesterday Senator Under
wood and also Senator Borah declar
ed they believed the latter estimatd
was much larger than actual results
would show.
Bankhead Substitute Denounced.
Senator Simmons attacked the Bank
bead substitute as an alleged exemp
tion of much wealth from taxation. He
said it was an excess rather than a
war profits tax plan, while the com
mittee proposal combined both. Ad
mitting that the committee in offering
the compromise amendments bad ac
ceded to sentiment in the senate and
of the public for higher taxation of
war profits he insisted that the Hank
head plan is basically wrong and
would yield little revenue. Senators
Smoot and Townsend also criticized
the Bankhead proposal, the latter de
claring it would levy on inflated cap
italization values and yield "practical
ly no revenue at all."
Would Exempt Banks.
Exemption from taxation of divi
dends declared by banks and trust
companies out of surplus and undivid
ed profits accumulated or earned prior
to March 1. 1913, was proposed in an
amendment by Senator Poraerene.
Another by Senator Ronsdell would
put a tax on cigarettes ranging from
two cents on those retailed for not
more than live cents to fifty per cent
on those sold at 25 cents or more.
Senator Hollis proposed to eliminate
the provision lowering the minimum
Incomes to be taxed from $4,000 on in
comes of married and $3,000 o' un
married persons to $2,000 and $1,000
respectively.
Claim Rates Are Confiscatory
(By Review Leased Wire)
DENVER. Aug. 30. After an all-day conference here today of
representatives of 210 Colorado mines, a committee of mine owner
left tonight for Washington instructed to inform Dr. H. A. Garfield,
coal administrator, that the new government prices are confiscatory
and if there is to be any price reduction in coal the government will
have to take over the mines of the state.
The committee has an appointment to meet Dr. Garfield Monday.
It was the contention of the operators at the conference today
that it would be impossible to operate the mines at the scale fixed by
the government because of the high cost of production and transpor
tation. '
David W. Brown, president of the Rocky Mountain Fuel company
one of tfie members of the committee, said the committee proposed to
bring a modification of the new coal prices.

IS FIXED FOR
THIS YEAR'S
President Wilson Announces
Price for Northern Spring
Wheat Compromise Is
Reached After Three Days'
Deliberations
(By Review Leased Wire).
WXSHINGTON. August 30. The
price of No. 1 Northern spring
wheat was fixed at $2.20 a
bushel at Chicago for the; 1917
crop today by the wheat fair price
committee headed by Dr. H. A. Gar
field, whese findings reached after
three days deliberation were submit
ted to and approved by President Wil
son. Number One Wheat
The basis will be for number one
wheat delivered at Chicago. The ra
mittee finally agreed late this after
noon after several days of voting. At
times today it looked as if it would be
unable to come to a conclusion but
just before 6 o'clock agreement was
reached and the vote was unanimous.
Producers Want $2.50
Representatives of the producers
began voting for a price of $2.50 and
labor's representatives for $1.S4. The
two extremes eventually narrowed
down until the votes were only a f w
cents apart and today's voting show
ed only a slight difference. Both fac
tions appeared uncompromising to the
start ,
191S Prifc Considered
On the basis of $2.20 at Chicago the
food administration worked out to
night differentials for the various
grades and classes and for the several
terminals. 'The price fixed tonight is
20 cents higher than that fixed tor
the 1918 crop by congrvs. The price
set by congress was taken into con
sideration by the committee.
Hopes for Stabilization
In a statement accompanying the
announcement of the price Pr?id-nt
Wilson declares it is the hope of 'he
food administration and his own as
well that the fixing of a price will
stabilize the market and keep prices
within moderate bounds for all tran
sactions during the current year.
Bread Price Up
The price of flour and bread, too.
the president declares, will be kept
down. All members agreed In their
discussions that the price fixing will
permit of a 1 bounce loaf of bread for
five cents, allowing a fair profit for
the flour manufacturer and the baker.
The price differentiation worked out
by the committee fololws:
Various Classes
Number one dark hard winter,
$2.24; hard winter basic, $2.20; red
winter basic. $2.20; yellow hard win

The basic grades are numbers one

Will Control Market
AHhough the prices are fixed no
government purchases only, the food
administration, through Its wheat cor

allied purchases and has under con
sideration plans to buy for millers.
If it serves as broken between the
terminal and the flour mills the cor

Bells of Moscow's 1600 Churches Ring Continuously An
nouncing the Resumption of the Celebration of the Feast
of the Assumption by the Russian People at the Seat of
Old Russian Orthodoxy in Ancient Kremlin of Moscow
(By Review Leased Wire)
MOSCOW, Tuesday, Auugust 28.
The bells of Moscow's 1,600 churches
l.ave been ringing continually ' since
cawn ou this, the festival of the As
sumption, in honor of the opening Jay
cf the Ecumenical congress of the
orthodox church the first congress
held for more than two centuries of ec
clesiastical officialism. Ever since
the revolution of 1905 all ardeat be
lievers of the churci have been desir
ing a revival of the medieaval prac
tice of holding these congresses,
which they consider the only sure
means of rescuing the church from its
erstwhile servility to the state.
All last night there streamed into
the city from neighboring villages
shagged-beard peasants in many cases
accompanied by their 'Vives, bearing
- Kempen packs on their1 backs and
carrying rude images in their bands.
These figures, mixing with the city
population, moved in dence masses to
wards the historic Red Square where
the ceremonial order provided that
the "procession of the cross" should
take place and "national service for
salvation of Holy Russia" should be
held. At ten o'clock in the morning,
in the cathedral of the Assumption,
in the Kremlin, in which still stands
the eagled bronze at which hundreds
of the emperors received the crown,
was held the dedicatory services.
The body of the cathedral was
thronged with mitred bishops carry
ing staves and gemmed crozieres, arch
priests in the purple burliet, and of
ten eclastic monks and mingled' with
them, laymen of note, the most promi
nent of the last being Premier Ke
rensky, who remained but a -few mo
ments, and former Premier Lvoft.
Before the end of the service there
began to arrive at the Kremlin en
closure and in the square, outside,
processions of the cross from the
thirty cathedral and monastery
churches, the participants in which
carried more than a thousand brazen
banners, painted with effigies of the
saints.
Between these processions tramped
groups of laymen, some bearing his
toric ikons and some holding up rude
home-made images, in the hope that
these by touch with, or proximity to,
the famous ikons would gain some
thing of the occasion's sacred spirit.
The correspondent witnessed many
striking evidences that the religious
spirit still was strong and deep. Be
side every ikon of note there trudged
working women who begged to be al
lowed to share in carrying the heavy,
iron-bound frames.

Confidence Is
Felt in Russia
Over Conference
(By Review Leased Wire).
MOSCOW, Aug. 30. A spirit of
confidence in the ultimate benefit to
accrue from the national conference
hel dhere Is expressed by representa
tives of the various groups which par
ticipated. Their hopes are based on
no definite policies enunciated or
measures adopted but upon the spirit
of conciliation observed among the
the factions and a clearer understand
ing growing out of the discussion of
the governmental problems.
Professor Paul Milukoff, spokesman
of the constitutional democrats, ex
pressed skepticism as to the perma
nent benefit to be derived, saying:
"The routes of the several groups
seem to have approached one anoth
er but I am afraid it is only temporary.
A certain unity seems possible. The
declarations of the Socialists as well
as the non-Socialists promise some
concessions but will these material
ize?" M. Teseretelli, former minister of
the interior, expressed a desire to fol
low a course leading to union and
collaboration. How far this desire
will be shown in facts can be learned
only in the future. M. Teseretelli,
who is a prominent member of the
council of deputies, said:
"There is a bridge between the
bourgeoisie and the Socialists. How
strong it will be depends on how far
the wealthy classes help the govern
ment to realize the reforms contem
plated. The conference gave positive
results which have united so far as is
possible the vital forces of the coun
try." General Alexieff, former commander-in-chief,
said:
"Postponement of the reorganiza
tion of the army threatens the most
serious consequences in the near fu
ture. Serious attention must be paid
to the report and recommendations of
General Korniloff."
M. Youreneff, the constitutionalist
Democratic minister of public works.
said:
"If further concessions are made it
wil lbe possible to reach an agree
ment between the organized forces of
the country."
M. Pieschehonoff, minister of sup
plies and national Socialist, said:
"The union of the political groups
seems to have taken a favorable turn."

WHEAT PRICE FIXED
AT $2.20 FOR FIRST
GRADE OF PRODUCT
(Continued From Page One)
in the interests of the common good.
Great pressure was brought to bear
on the committee from many quarters
to set the price at a higher figure
than that named, but the final confer
ence, members declared, represented
a malority opinion of what is fairest
to all the interests of the country.
Cost of Porduction
The cost of production came in. for
considerable discussion. Exports of
the department of agriculture wre
asked for cost production figures and
data supplied by growers' organiza
tions. It was realized that some grow
ers will be forced to sell their wheat
at a loss while many others will make
a high profit
Committee's Work End
The committee's work ended with
the fixing of a price. Besides Dr.
Garfield, the chairman, the other mem
bers present were:
Charles J. Barrett of Georgia, pres
ident of the Farmers' Union; Eugene
E. Funk of Illinois, president of the
Corn Growers' association; Edward F.
Ladd, president of the North Dakota
Agricultural college; J. W. Shorthill
of Nebraska, secretary of the national
council of farmers' co-operative asso
ciations; L. J. Nabor, president of
the Ohio state granges; Henry K.
Waters, president of the Kansas Agri
cultural college; W. N. Doak of Roa
noke, Va, president of the Brother
hood of Railroad Trainmen; James
W. Sullivan of New York of thi Am
erican Federation of Labor; F. W.
Taussig of the livestock commission,
ard Theodore N. Vail, president cf the
American Telephone & Telegraph
company.
Labor Vote Low.
Labor representatives on the com
mittee vo'.ed first for 1.84 and the
farmers for $2.50. After long discus
sion the compromise at $2.20 was ap
proved unanimously.
The announcement was made at the
white house in the following state
ment by the president:
Price Will Stick.
"Section 11 of the food act provides
among other things for the purchase
and sale of wheat and flour by the gov
ernment and appropriates money for
the purpose. The purchase of wheat
and flour for our allies and to a con
siderable degree for neutral countries
also, has been placed under the con
trol of the food administration. I have
appointed a committee to determine a
fair price to be paidjn government
purchases. The price now recom
mended by that committee $2.20 per
bushel at Chicago, for the basic grade
will be rigidly adhered to by the
food administration.
Hope For Stable Price.
"It is the hope and expectation of
the food administration, and my own
also, that this step will at once stabil
ize and keep within moderate bounds
the price of wheat for all transactions
thremghout the present crop year, and
in consequence the prices of flour and
bread also. The food act has given
larger powers for the control of stor
age and exchange operations and these
powers will be fully exercised. An
inevitable consequence will be that
financial dealings cannot follow their
usual course. Whatever maybe the
advantages and disadvantages of or
dinary trading, it cannot (unction well
under such disturbed and abnormal
conditions as now exist. In its place
the food administration now fixes for
its purchases a fair price, as recom
mended unanimously by a committee
representative of all interests in all
sections and thereby it will eliminate
speculation, make possible the conduct
of every operation in the full light ot
day, maintain the publicly stated
price for all and through economies
made possible by stablization ana
control, better the position of consum
ers also.
Hoover Takes No Part.
"Mr. Hoover at his expressed wish,
has taken no part in the deliberations
ot the committee on whose recommen
dation I determine the government's
fsir price nor has he in any way in
timated an opinion regarding that
price."
Report of Committee.
"The undersigned committee has
been asked by you to recommend the
price which the government should
pay for the 1917 crop of wheat..
' In its deliberations the committee
has kept constantly in m;nd the three
following factors:
"First The fact that the United
States is at war.
"Second The need of encouraging
the producer.
"Third The necessity of reducing
the cost of living to flie consumer.
Normal Laws No Avail.
"The normal laws ot supply and de
mand have been violently Interfered
with and congress has undertaken to
oflset this disturbance by conferring
extraordinary powers upon the presi
dent to stabilize prices. Each of the
foregoing factors grows out of con
ditions which have received the care
ful attention or the committer.
Chieflly among them are: that the
wheal yield in a great and important
section of the country has this year
been below normal; that over attains
it unt ion is the crying need among the
whole body of the population, especi
ally the wage earners that the rising;
tide of costs shall be stayed ami re-j
Uuced as rapidly as possible consist-'
ent with the welfare of the producer;
hat the government is at the present
time engaged in the great task of re
ducing and stabilizing costs of other
staple commodities; that the wheat
oi the world is abundant for its needs
even diregarding the stores in Russia
out because of lack of shipping and
war conditions, the burden of supply
ing wheat to the allies and to neu
tral nations rests for the time being
upon the United States and Canada.
Action A Guaranty.
"Your committee also has consider
ed the fact that the government price
for the 1917 wheat crop is in effect a
continuing guaranty until the mini
mum price guaranteed by congress
for the crop of 1918 goes into effect.
July 1, 1917). It has considered
the relation of the 1918 minimum price
to the price here recommended. It
has clso considered the effect which
an early termination of the war would
bave upon the wheat markets of the
world.
Guided By Wilson.
"In reporting its recommendation
ihe committee has been guided by the
principles you have announced that a
fair price should be based upon the
cost of production for the entire
country plus a reasonable profit. We
have relied upon the cost estimates
for the crop of 1917, furnished by the
United States department of agricul
ture checked by the results of our In
dependents Investigations and the "re
sults submitted to the committee.
Considered Regulations.
"This committee has considered the
regulations recently established by the
United States food administration
rain corporation for the different
grades of the wheat through which all
ransactions in. wheat are to be stand
ardized and speculation to be entire
'y eliminated. All that profits to the
jrain dealers, miller and flour dealer
iave been regulated and reduced by
the grain corporation, effecting a ma
'erial reduction in the cost of flour.
"In consideration of the foregoing
'acts and circumstances, this commit
ee respectfully recommends that tbo
rice of number one northern spring
vheat or its equivalent at Chicago be
2.20 per bushel."

Drivers of Goodrich Test Cars Explore
Arizona and Marvel at It's Scenic
Wonders.
"Arizona can well be proud of her scenic attrac
tions," said George Cochran, chief of the Pacific
Fleet of the Goodrich Tire Testing cars on their re
cent run to this state. "Take the Apache Trail for
instance. In all my extensive traveling' throughout
the country I have seen few places that can stand
comparison with its wild picturesque magnificence.
I The Pacilic Tire Testing- Fleet is
many different sections of the coun
try, pounding the roads sixteen hours
every day so that the tires may b
tested under actual road conditions
such as are experienced by the aver
age motorist.
Arizonans. absorbed in their com-
! mercial pursuits or bent upon wrest
ing the mother lode irom tne tasi
ness of the hills are prone to forget
that the state possesses other at
tractions besides copper, cattle, and
gold. Few places are as fascinating
to the tourist as that 120 mile region
1 of mighty canyons, grotesque moun
tain peaks and sheer precipices be
tween uioDe ana rnoenix.
The Apache Trail is especially rich
in historic interest. A few miles out
one comes in sight of Apache Kid
Mountain where once lurked the fa
mous desperado of that name. Far
ther on in the dark rkhes of the
mountainside one sees the Tonto
Cliff Dwellings discovered by the
Spanish explorer Francisco Vasquez
da Coronado in 1540.
For miles the road skirts Roose
velt Lake, the largest artificial lake
in the world. Leaving this body of
water one soon finds himself in the
midst of a scenic paradise bearing
the most fantastic of names. In th.s
region is Mormon Flat where a party
of Mormon immigrants was massa
cred in the early days. From Mor
mon Flat passes in rapid succession
Whirlpool Rock, Black Canyon, and
then Apache Gap. It was on this
vuw .a...,, . k . I '. IVII v till
enth U. S. Cavalry defeated the
Apaches in 1886.
, The next point of interest is Su
perstition Mountain. Mysterious in
' aspect and weirdly carved against
the sky, it was feared by the Indians.
, who held ceremonies - and sacred
dances at its base every year.
It is indeed a wonderful trie one
never forewtten brineine- forth a
t gasp of delight at every turn. The
! B. F. Goodrich Rubber Company is
: planning to mark the trail with its
: guide posts, such as are used on most
every road in the country. This will
prove a great help to tourists, and
should result in a noticeable increase
in traffic upon the Apache TraiL
The Grand Canyon, that scenic
wonderland that defies description,
was also visited by the Goodrich Tire
Testing cars.
Through every typ of road, both
pood and bad, was traveled for 16
hours every day. the tires held up
very satisfactorily, coming through
with hardly a mark.

ORGANIZED LABOR SPEAKS RIGHT OUT
The Seattle Central Labor Council condemned the I.
. W. W. In a set of stirring revolutions passed recently by
that body. The following two sections are straight to the
point:
"Resolved, That hereafter this council refuse to issue
credentials to representatives of the Industrial Workers
of the World to visit unions affiliated with the American
Federation of Labor for the purpose of soliciting moral
or financial assistance or carrying on their propaganda;
and further, be it
"Resolved, That this council recommend that local
unions having no such, provision in their constitutions
take such steps as are' necessary to bar their members
from holding membership in any dual organization to their
local union affiliated with the American Federation of
Labor, through which agency they can fully protect their
Interests and bring about improved conditions in a sane,
orderly and effective manner."
Commenting upon these resolutions, which it printed
in full, the International Typographical Journal, the offi
cial organ of the union printers, says:
"The Journal is glad to see the Seattle union take
a firm stand for the legitimate labor movement of the
country as opposed to the iconoclastic gang that has in
the last few years been able to attract a large amount of
attention to itself in the public print."
"AMERICA AT WAR"
Rev. Dr. E. E. VIolette, pastor of a church in Kansas
City, Mo., delivered a powerful sermon last Sunday morn
ing on the subject, "America at War," in which he paid
his attention to slackers generally as enemies of the
country, and to the I. W. W. in particular. In part, the
Missouri preacher said:
"TJie theological slacker is as bad as the L W. W.
slacker. Every man, woman and child in every church in
the United States ought to stand behind the preisdent.
The church that refuses to support the government now
ought to close its doors and send its members as mission
aries to Germany.
"About SO young men are going from this congre-'
gation into active service," continued Dr. Violette. "You
go with the blessings of this pulpit. You are going the
way your fathers went with. Washington, Sherman and
Lee and what they did for you, you will do for posterity.
It is far better to die trying to do your duty than to
live trying to shirk it
"But our quarrel with Germany is not the greatest of
our troubles. The man who favors the mob spirit of the
I. W. W. and similar organizations must" remember that
the people who love honest to goodness citizenship are
in the majority. The man not willing to work on the
merits of his own ability doesn't deserve the protection
of the American government, no matter whether he is
worth four cents or four millions. I have personally vis
ited more than 40 countries and studied labor conditions
in most of them. My observation is that the American lab
oring man Is better paid, better clothed, better fed and
has better opportunities than the laboring man of any
other land. I do not say that labor conditions are ideal
here, but I do say that the I. W. W. spirit will not make
them Ideal."
The Warren district will don its gala attire next
Monday and make that holiday occasion Uie greatest in
the history of the mountains. Are you getting ready for
it, Mr. Citizeu?
THE WAR
There is little in the war dispatches the past few
days to comfort the true friend of the allied cause. The
Italian offensive stopped just when it seemed ko have at
tained the most momentum. The Russians are still in
flight. The French are holding their new positions at
Verdun. The Canadians are still trying to crack that
nut at "Lens. The British are hampered by the rain in
Flanders.
And yet, if there is nothing to comfort, neither is
there anything to discourage. A little over a year ago
the Italians were being driven back by an Austrian of
fensive. While the Russian armies are still falling back
yet they are not yet destroyed, and the Russian states
men are still determined to continue the war. The
French have just recaptured at a loss of 10,000 men
ground that the Prussians spent 600,000 last year to win
The Canadians dominate Lens from points that the allies
spent a hundred thousand men in vain two years ago to
capture. The British hold all and much more of the ter
rible Ypres salient that they were driven from with ap
palling losses in the second year of the war. Germany
has lost 100,000 of her best fighting men this month. So,
if we have not gained much ground or broken the Teuton
lines, yet things could be and have been worse.
Indications now point plainly to a winter campaign
and a new and still greater offensive next spring with
half a million Americans taking part in it Maybe we
will break through them. The allied military experts
look for the Prussian line to crumble and bend back in
August of next year. They figure that Germany must
lose another million men by attrition and short, sharp
offensives and terrible artillery fire and continuous trench
warfare, before her . lines, made almost impregnable by
machine guns and artillery, can be broken.
Consider for a moment how bard it is to break a
modern battle line. A few days ago the Canadians took
Hill Seventy. It had been shattered and its defensive de
stroyed by artillery fire. Yet the Canadians held this
crumbling ruin of a hill against seven terrible counter at
tacks of the flower of the Prussian army. One entire
division of the' famous Prussian guards was destroyed
in front of this line and another division partly destroyed.
Not a foot could the Germans gain from seven attacks
in one day and a score of attacks since then against
this line.
Consider that the crown prince, using picked troops,
made 30 attacks against the Chemin des Dames, held
by the French, and lost 50,000 men and never regained
a yard of this line that had been taken from him.
And yet the allies have not failed In a single great
offensive this year against the German lines. They have
gained their objectives every time. But they have failed
to break through. They have failed to break down the
German1 morale.' They have failed to make a deep
enough salient to force a considerable withdrawal. The
French failed to take Laon, their real objective. The
British have failed to take Doual and Lens and Lille and
Zebrugge, their real objectives this year. They may yet
gain these goals. It is possible. - But right now it does
not look probable as it did a week ago.
As for the Italians, only the old gods of ancient
Rome know how many mountain barriers they have yet
to batter down before they can strike the Austrians a
real blow. These Austrians, poor fighters against their
cousins, the Rubs, are demons when they come to oppose
the descendants of the Caesars.

The Russian revolution presents the terrible exampl.?
of the results of too much liberty. The follies of the
soldier's and workmen's council resulted in the demorali
sation of the army. Privates killed their officers, and bolt
ed before the enemy. Sweet revenge, this, and all very
fine. But these privates, if they continue to kill their
officers and fall back before the foe will one day come
to the wall, and some Prussian drill sergeant will make
them sigh with intense longing for the worst the old
regime under their officers had to offer as a May day
of rejoicing and pleasure. The most pitiful spectacle of
the war is that of the brave Russian officers trying to
make headway against the onrushing Prussians and betas
shot in the back by their own men. Officers have been
killed by the hundred in this manner. They are the
martyrs of the world war, these Russian officers who are
trying to save for Russia her newly won liberty.
In the ranks of the American Federation in Arizona
the I. W. W. has a few supporters and sympathizers and
a great many who condemn the Wobblles as strongly and
as unqualifiedly as the Seattle body has done. Unfor
tunately the president of the state federation is one of
the few who are supporting the Wobblieg and officially
he has committed the entire organization to that course
in spite of individual opinions.'. '. ''.'"
If the Arizona state president of the federation were
of the same mind and public word as the national presi
dent. Mr. Gompers, toward Woblilics and traitors and
the government, the industrial crisis in Arizona would
ouickly pass away, at least for the term of the war.

Ther seems to be a decided mix-up
on the place of mobilization of Ari

"Owing to a conflict in the general

BE FIRST QUOTA TO
LEAVETHIS COUNTY
First Five Per Cent Must Be
Men Who Have Had Mili
tary Experience They Will
Leave Bisbee September 5
at 5:30 o'Clock
Thirty-four men who have had mili
tary experience, in the army navy and
other military organizations or insti
tutions, will be the first part of. Co
chise county's quota to leave their re
gion of the state of Arizona. These
men will be sent from Bisbee on Sep
tember 5 at 5:30 p. m. to Fort Riley,
Kansas, according to information re
ceived yesterday by the local exemp
tion board from Col. Fred S. Breen.
the state provost marshal.
There has been some question, for
several days, as to the number of men
to leave Bisbee and the method of se
lecting them.- Another question has
been the destination of those selected.
Yesterday's wire from Col. Breen
cleared up several points.
In the first place the county will
send five per cent of its quota on
September 5. This amounts to thirty-four
men. The board has been in
structed to see that every one of the
first thirty-four has had some kind
of previous military experience, ln
a8 much us the registration did not dis
close a registrant's experience it will
be necessary for drafted men to writo
to the board and explain their quali
fications. Men who have" had such
experience and who desire to get to 1
the camps at an early date are asked
to write to the board at Tombstone,
at once, and they may be selected.
It is, apparently, the purpose of the
provost marshal general, that each
camp should be started with as many
experienced men as possible. Exper
ience, In the present sense, undoubt
edly means acquaintance with the old
time methods of drilling and other
forms of maneuvers. In this man
ner the various big national army
camps, throughout the country, will
have a nucleus to work upon after the
first complement arrives.
Every man is requested by the
board, when he reports to Bisbee for
the purpose of mobilization, to bring
along a spare pair of shoes with which
to alternate with the regulation
shoes furnished by the government.
Transportation has already been ar
ranged for from ISIsbee to Fort Riley,
according to word received by the
board.
Co. Breen, yesterday, asked what
disposition had been made of the' cas
es o" those men at Columbts -who
should have been examined. It had
been represented to Breen and to oth
er officials that no allowance had been
made for them. The local board ans
wered that application had been made
to the Luna county, New Mexico,
board to make the examinations at
Peming. Many of the men who were
deported from Bisbee on July 12 and
who were registered in Cochise coun
ty, have returned to Bisbee for exami
nation and are now awaiting orders
to join the national army.

Lionel Barrymore Is Booked
at Eagle While Jack Pick
ford Appears at Orpheum
There are two excellent moving pic
tures in Bisbee today: Jack Pick fori
in 'The Dummy" and Lionel Barry
more in "The Millionaire's Double,' at
the Eagle. Botn are well worth see
ing, "The Dummy' being one of the
most successful pictures ever adapt
ed from a production of the legitimate
stage. Jack Pickford handles the titie
role more capably than he has ever
handled any part in which be has ap
peared, and a fine strain of comedy is
interwoven with one of the most grip
ping stories ever portrayed on tee
screen. It is certainly one of the best
pictures of the season, and it's well
worth seeing.
'"The Millionaire's Double' features
a well known actor and the advance
story reveals a fast-moving and multi
sided plot where an odd love story
mingles with a strong dash of twen
tieth century intrigue. This picture
will be shown at the Eagle and "The

LAST CALL FOR MEN
TO FILL 1ST ARIZONA
Just now, but only for a short time,
a fine chance is open for the man who
wants action in the war and wants it
quick. All he has to do is to go down
to Naco and offer himself at the camp
of the First Arizona Infantry. Prob
ably the opportunity will not be open
much longer, for the regiment has re
ceived information that it will leave
Arizona soon for the Linda Vista camp
near San Diego, there to be trained
to follow in the footsteps of the reg
ulars already in France, under Persh
ing. The recruit today will step into a
well trained organization of his own
iind of men, Arizona men, filled with
a local patriotism that will carry them
and their regiment far when they get
on the fighting line. With such an
organization the new man will have
exceptional opportunities and it will
be his own fault if he fails to advance
rapidly in military knowledge much
faster than would be the case in com
panies of the new army made up whol
ly of recruits.
The man wiio enlists now will get
in belore the re-organization of the
regiment on the basis of 300 men to
the company and will have the better
chance for advancement, contingent,
if course, o;i his own capabilities and
devotion to duty.
General instructions to receive men
tor the service within the ages of IS
r.nd ". if physically qtmlil'ied have
been issued. This opens a way for
many who now are exempt from the
draft. Men on the draft lists will bo
accepted if their names have not been
reached and by their enlistment will
strike themselves from the conscrip
tion roll..

Premier Kerensky in a speech at
the closing session of the Moscow
conference announced that order' was
to be brought of the chaos by putting
to death the cowards who threw down
their arms in the face of the enemy.

The possibility that the "rule of
blood and iron" has begun with the
deserters before Fokshani is indicat
ed in the latest Russian communica
tion which says that one of the cow
ardly regiments was "dispersed."
Germans Press Gains
As is usual when the Germans see
a faltering among their foes they have
thrown into the battle line in Mol
davia some of their tried attacking
troops, 'who doubtless will press to
the fullest the advantage they have
gained through the cowardice of the
Russians.

A meeting of the men of the draft

decided that inasmuch as the entire
citizenship of the county is turning out 1

their duty, in appreciation, to turn I
out in full force for the parade. This
they are going to do by having every

wreckage and the like. It is difficult
to be certain of a hit as the Germans
on more than one occasion have re
leased oil purposefully and loose
wreckage prepared in advance in or
der to create the impression that a
boat had been sunk.
Aeroplanes are being used in con
junction with the destroyer work of
the allies along the French coast and
in the channel. This means of de
tecting the presence of submarines
will be used by the Americans when
ever practicable as the planes become
available.
Aircraft the Eyes
The underwater radius of the aver
age U-boat is less than 150 miles un
der most favorable conditions. To get
that distance it would have to travel
at a rate of very few miles an hour.
It is argued, therefore, that if by
means of aircraft, destroyers and all
other agencies for the detecting sub
marines a radius of 150 miles or less
in width would be drawn along the
German bases or the entrance of the
North sea in which a submarine would
come to the surface only at rare inter
vals, the Germans would not be able
to operate on a scale to threaten sup
ply lines except inside that zone.
U-Boat Devices
Whatever the plans of the allied
government are as to future policy
against the U-boats, rapid develop
ment of devices for checking the un
derwater campaign, accelerated by the
entrance of the United States into
the war, are taking such shape as to
indicate that a way may be found in
the end to dispose of the menace.
Results of U-boat activities this win
ter will be closely watched as having
a bearing on the subject.
Rough weather may work equally

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by- others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire.)
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, August 30. Corn prices
moved sharply upward toward the
close of the session finishing near the
top. Throughout the session the un
dertone was firm and a mid day de
cline induced by weakness of stocks
was quickly overcome. The close
was strong, to one cent higher
with December at 1.09 and May
1.06 to 1.06. Oats finished strong,
4 to IVi cents higher, September
leading. Provisions showed gains of
from 5 to 18 cents and 'cash wheat
prices advanced 5 to 10 cents.
A fair demand developed for cash
wheat prices advanced on light re
ceipts. Traders awaiting announce
ment of the government wheat prices
were inclined to believe that the fig
ure would be higher than was looked
for several days ago. when $2.10 was
regarded by some as a possible out
side price.
Liberal realizing sales of provisions
did not disturb the upward trend of
prices influenced by the advances in
the live hog market. Buying was
credited to packers. The close was
well toward the top for the day.
NEW YORK EXCHANGE.
NEW YORK, August 30 Stocks fell
with extreme violence in the course of
today's short session professional
traders taking advantage of the half
holiday In honor of the city troops to
renew their selling operations with in
creased vigor.
The setback ranged from two to five
points in numerous shares of Import
ance and as much as seven to thirteen
points in the more speculative class,
notably Industrial Alcohol and Texas
company.
While the decline was at Its height
the financial district was agog with
reports to the effect that the war
bonds at Washington had fixed upon
very drastic cuts in prices of such
products as steels, coppers, and oils.
Rails was the first to break, Dela
ware ft Hudson's 3 ',4 point decline to
S9 being a new minimum for that
stock and bringing out many stop or
ders in other transportation issues.
United States Steel was offered in
lots of 1.000 to over 20,000 shares
down to 1164, a gross decline of ZM
with virtually no decovery.
Sales 400,000 shares.
Call money developed stronger ten
dencies, opening at 34 per cent but
advancing to four per cent before
the end of the session. Time rates
were quotably unchanged but offer
ings were less liberal. - r .
The bond market was heavy.
Liberty 3's moved in the narrow
range of 99.92 to 99.96.
Total sales of bonds, (par value),
aggregating $2,240,000.
United States bonds, (old issues),
were unchanged on call.
NEW YORK, August 30. The short
session provided much activity with
prices in all issues, the industrials es
pecially in the last hour exhibiting
considerable weakness. There was no
influence disclosed but the impression
is gaining ground daily that the tax
ation and price fixing program will
militate strongly against large profits,
that is when compared with those of
the many new floatations distributed
to the public in the past two year,
are seemingly becoming more burden
some and in anticipation of the new
order of things growing through the
readjustment process. Conrequently
a public buying power of average vol
ume is not expected to assert itself
until the conditions as above men
tioned are Testified to a more marked
degree, and it is our opinion and of
which we have insisted upon for so
long prices in the industrial issues
will be further impaired.

Extracting "Maude's" aching tooth.
There is peace and quiet again in the Grant park zoo at Atlanta, Ga.
Until a few aays ago and for two weeks previous the menagerie was a
bedlam of trumpeting and howling, but tnat is all over now. It all started
when Maude, the prize pachyderm of the institution became troubled with
a defective tooth. She bellowed and?rampcted and kicked until hef.icep
ers began t fear for the safety of themstlvea and visitors, and the other
animals though fear or sympathy made such a din with their howling that
sleep was out of the question. After two weeks of the racket a dentist
Was called in and with a Dair of iron ton en he nulled the trnnhlpnme mnlar
Wilson's Note to
Pope Approved in
London Papers
(By Review Leised Wire.)
LONDON, Aug. 30. In its comment
on the president's" reply to the pope's
peace note the Evening Standard
says:
"Mr. Wilson brings us back to the
bed-rVck fact that Germany is a leper
state and that until she has cleansed
herself, communion with her means
corruption. Mr. Wilson puts into
plain language what, our statesmen
clothe in roundabut and unimpressive
language. He is not afraid to connect
a liar, even If the liar happens to be
extremely well connected."
The Globe says:
We perhaps are not quite ready, as
the president, to assume, that the
strangely pio-German spirit which per
meates the suggestions of His Holi
ness is entirely free from all Austrian
influence, nor are we prepared to ad
mit that the German people do not
share the culpability of their rules for
this desolating war, but these things:
are matters of opinion and do not af- i
feet the sincere Concurrence of this na-'
tion in the main principles which Mr.
Wilson laid down." j
In going beyond the ruling caste to ,
the German people themselvs, says
the Pall Mall Gazette, President Wil
son may appear to some to be over
sanguine. !
"But we believe he is right, because
we see no alternative but complete
military victory. When the enemy
masses learn, as they must sooner tor
later, that it is the abominable doc
trine of blood and iron which stands
between them and their deliverance,
we believe clouds will have gathered
tor the house of Hohenzollern." ;
The Westminster Gazette says thej
reply strikes the right note for the!
allies and continues:
"Firm, defiant against the German
system, but n'ot threatening ostracism j
and ruin if that system be dis-estab-,
lished it may not succeed. The Ger-j
man people and their system may be;
too much at one or any disintegration;
from within, but there is no reason
hv w should nenetuallv stoke up:"" ' a
the fire eaters wh'o are trying to per -
suade the German people that the al -
lies fire bent on conquest and destruc -
tion. and do nothing to help the
growth of moderate opinion."

Crescent Baking Powder has two
leavening actions. Most baking
powders have but one. Crescent
Baking Powder has nearly 15 per
cent leavening power. This is from
one-fifth td one-fourth more than
most baking powders have. Purity
hasn't been sacrificed to obtain this
remarkable efficiency. No baking
powder is purer or

than Crescent. In
recognition of its
marked superiority,
it was awarded the
