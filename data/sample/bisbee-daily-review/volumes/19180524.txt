two jurors ami many speevtators in

matic conclusion the tale of her own
story of l er life almost up to the slay
ing of .Mrs Mary Newman Roberts for
which she is now on trial.
Swayhig in tho witness chair at

for her help in the preparation of a
book, finally won her sympathy by tell
ing of i-ie unhappy home lif?. After
describing many meetings in Chicago
and other places during two years.
.Miss Lusl' told of arranging a confer
ence wPii Dr. Roberts in a Milwaukee
hotel in May. 1917. about a month be
fore the tragedy. It was to this meet
ing whic'i she carried the pistol with
which sh-i later shot Mrs. Roberts.
Reputation Gone
"I had decided that the situation had
to be straightened out," she Ustified,
"and thit if Dr. Roberts did not care
tor mi, ! would take my own life. I
told him how sincere I had been in
my affeclcion. How I would never
have alloved it to start if he had not
assur-?:l n.e that Mrs. Roberts did not
care for him. Things now were be
yond my control. My reputation was
gone and my life ruined. Mrs. Rob
erts also was hopelessly wronged. If
this hid been a game on his part and
if I had i een so simple as not to have
undprs:ood it. I would take the conse
quences. "Then he said he cared ten thou
sand times more for me. I asked him
to tell her He said it was impossible.
I again asked him fi he cared for me.
He assured me that he did. Then I
took th-; pistol, made him put his right
hand on a bible and asked him to
swear tnru he would go home and tell
the tni'li. He said that it was im
possible at that ime. I said that I
would give him until the fifteenth of
June an.l he swore that he would tell
Mrs. Roberts that we cared for each
other. I told him to ask for his free
dom and he said 'do you! think that
will be n-cessary if I tell the truth?'
Then I put down the gun and told him
that he i-eed not tell her if he did not
want to. He said that he would tell
her. that it was better to be honest."

WASHINGTON. May 2i. Two im
portant steps were taken today to
ward perfecting the task of putting
the nation on a war basis.
Soon arter Provost Marshal General
Crcwder had promulgated a drastic
amendment to the selective service
regulation requiring every man of
draft age to work or fight. Secretary
Kaker appeared before the house mili
tary committee and asked that Pres
ident Wilson authorized the call to
the colors all men of draft age who
can be equipped and trained. The
committee promptly and unanimous!
voted the authority into the army ap
propriation bill about to lie reported
to the bouse.
Under existing law power is given
to draft one million fighting men in
addition to special units. This limit
soon will be reached with men con
stantly going Into camp to replace
these sailing for France as fast a
ships can be provided to take them.
With the law changed as the president
desires, the man power of the country
will be drawn upon for whatever force
may be necessary to win the war.
Order Far Reaching
General Crowder's new regulation is
far reaching in scope and toui hes not
enly habitual idlers but also requires
that rraft registrants now in occupa
tions held to be non-useful seek new
Jobs or take their places in the army.
Clerks in stores, waiters, bartenrers.

senger elevator men ano other em
ployes arounr hotels, club ann busi
ness builnings. as well as gamblers,
fortune tellers anr race track and
bucket shop attendants all fall among
these classed as non-usefully engaged.
Enforcement of the rule is expected to
add some men to the a?my and to do
a more important service in improv
ing the labor situation tin essential in
dustries. The house military committee's ac
tion after heaving Secretary Baker
completed the army bill, with provi
sion for the pay of 3.i'O0.0CO men and
with ordnance appropriations on the
basis of an army of 4.000.000. The
measure will be laid before the house
carrying a total of $9.569.129.0i0 of
actual appropriations and authoriza
tion for contracts amounting to
4 U4.4 16.000 more.
Mt. taker told the committee in ex
ecutive session the president's rea
sons for asking that no limit be placed
upon the number of draft men to be
called.
Amendment Adopted
Members said later it was estimat
ed that an army of S.OOO.OOO rouid ho
raised without changing the draft
ages.
This amendment to the existing law
was adopted bf the committee:
"Provided, that the authority con

when the Germans will renew iceir

fall, but whenever the interrupted bat
tie is reopened the enemy will find
various disadvantages changes in the
situation as compared with the first
stage -of the struggle that ha began

For one thing, the German soldier., I

Many or their test troops have been
destroyed without the armies attain
ing their objectives. This has de
pressed the spirits of the remainder.
A repetition of ?. powerful surprise
attack, has been rendered almost im
possible, since the complete unity of
the French, British and American
troops enables the allied generalissimo
to control the whole front.
The allies are certainly better pre

Miners Average High in Pleges
To Red Cross War Fund Campaign
With the working men of this dis
trict contributing to the American Red

centage fclmost perfect, and with com
mittees reporting yesterday noon that
subscriptions to date had passed the
forty-sever' thousand mark and were
ncaring the double quota originally
set. comj.letion yesterday Ft in be
tween rhifts in several of the mines
in the strict. Last night the com
petition had come to a head at the
Briggs shaft, where the day and nigh,
shifts w?re vieing with each other for
the high honors in Red Cross contri
butions. The average for all miners of the
Calumet & Arizona mining companv.
according to the announcement of
Thomas Cowperthwaite, in charge of
the camrwign for this company, as in
dicated by figures at hand last nieht.
amounted to a little more than $3.00
ver ciniti. More thfn 97. per cent of
tHo Tn pmnlnved bv the C. & A.
had contributed to the fund, and in
dications were that this percentage
of lovalty would be Increased before
the close of the drive Saturday. The
respons-3 was loval and willing.
At the Briggs
When the competition at the Briggs
came to a head, the night shift w-ith
contributions totaling more thani$1200
was leading the day shift in total and
in nor crita pledees. The dav shift
had pledged a total of aPDroximat-?lv
JtOCiO. The average for esch man on
the dav shift was about f9. while the
average tor the night workers mounted
to about flO per man.
No renort of results In all depart
ments of the Copper Queen had been
made unto noon of yesterday, and last
nieht W: E. McKeehan. in chnrtre of
the: drive in the C Q. anno'isced that
his first, and total renort would be
made Monday. Later the lists of snb-1
scrihers throueh the mines will be
published, stated Mr. McKeehan.
Cueen Man Liberal
Employes of the Queen in every de
partment are as liberal as other work
ing men of the district. Approximate
ly 98 per cent of the employes of the
company are responding to the call,
and competition between day and night
shifts at various mines, and between
the team captains, is vigorous. Re
ports of the work accomnlished can
not be made before Mondav because
of the amount of Kroid which must
be covered.
Yesterdav committers discarded the
card svstf m with which they had been
working rr.d everv person entered on
a campaien to secure all pledees pos
sible. The result was that by even
ing reports of .committees indicated
that a large per cent of the residents
of the city had been visited and their
pledges received.
At th. noon luncheon today at the
T. M. C. A. it is anticipated that the
reports of committees will, show the
.district will be ovex the J30.000 mark
set as i minimum double the origi
nal quota alloted the district. Lunch

TO BE REGRETTED
(From the Arizona Republican)
It is most regrettable that the Governor
included in his message, in the manner in
which it was done, the subject oc the Bis
bee deportations with a violence of lan
guage which cannot fail to stir antagonism
which otherwise might have bee-n avoided,
and which will almost certainly retard, if it
does not defeat, a part of the program of
legislation.
If there was ever a time in the history of
this state when a determined ard an intel
ligent effort should be made to biing about
a better understanding between laborer and
employer, based on increased confidence
and mutual respect ar.d lair dealing, it is
today. And we feel that tha manifestly
biased review ot the deplorable Bisbee in
cident by the governor serves no good pur
pose, but will do much to stir up class hat
red and postpone the day of industrial
peace so greatly needed in this state.
We make no defense of the men who
engaged in the Bisbee deportations. 1 hey
probably trampled on the conatitutiontl
rights of the men whom they expelled.
Yet, the men who participated in this dras
tic movement acted under great provoca
tion. They believed that the tranquility cf
the mining camp was threatened, and that
it could be preserved only by prompt and
summary action. And the sequel shows
that it was preserved, while in nearly every
other great mining camp in the stale there
was prolonged riot, disorder and idleness.
We offer this as an explanation of the
point of view of the men engaged in the
deportations, among whom there were un
doubtedly hundreds of good cilkens of un
questioned loyalty, stirred to action by
threats of destruction to great mining
properties.
There is a serious question here, too, of
propriety. This is not now a matter for
the state authorities, if it could ever have
been brought -under state jurisdiction. It
has reached a phase in which the newspap
ers cannot discuss the matter with propri
ety; and we believe that there cannot be
anywhere in Arizona a proper public dis
cussion of this question.
Indictments have been found against a
large number of men alleged to have been
concerned in that movement. They must
go before juries which, if they are to re
turn true verdicts, must be composed of
men of unbiased opinions. Any public
discussion of the matter which now rests
solely with the people from among whom
the juries are to be drawn, cannot fail to
produce a popular inflamaticn, which will
make an unbiased verdict impossible. A
verdict either for or against the defendants
would represent only the prejudices of the
jurors.
The entire question of the Bisbee depor
tations has been fully covered by the Pres
ident's mediation commission; the whole
unfortunate matter is now before the fed
eral court, and it seems particularly deplor
able that the smouldering fires of class
hatred should thus be revived.
Three weeks have intervened since the
Germans suffered that terrible repulse be
fore the hills southwest of Mt. Kemmel
and they have attempted no general attack
on a large scale in that period except one
costly and fruitless attack by two fresh
divisions brought up for this especial pur-
pose. vjn me otner nana, trie auies,
strengthened, freshened and heartened, '
have conducted daily attacks cf lora! nat-
ure and maintained a most deadly artillery !
fire upon the arecj recently conquered by
their enemies. It is generally believed
among allied experts and leaders that the
German losses have staggered the German
staff, otherwise thej' would net have re
mained inactive during tlif-uc precious
weeks which enabled the allies to preprr.c
full)' for the next drive. All leaders arc
unanimous in the belief that there will be
another drive, and it may well have as
much or greater force than the first one.
But confidence grows every day in the
fixed conviction that it will fail. That
something has gone wrong with the Ger
man war machine goes without saying.
Time is the allies' greatest friend right now,
end they have been given three weeks by
the Germans who hold dangerous and cost
ly salients they must enlarge or evacuate.
Every day that passes emphasizes the ex
tent of he German losses and the difficul
ty in fitting shattered divisions for a fresh
onslaught. And it may well be that Ger
man morale has suffered even more than
German flesh and blood in that most cost
ly of all human advances across the blood
iest ground in the world Picardy a"nd
Flanders.
There are no flies on the Yuma brand of
patriotism. During the Red Cross drive
in this town one of its richest citizens, a
man by the name of Munn, worth three
hundred thousand dollars, refused to give
one cent to the Red Cross. The women
tried him first; then a committee of men
waited upon him. He was obdurate, and
even arrogant in his stand. Then they
took him in an automobile and sent for a
bucket of tar and a tick of feathers. He
signed a check for fifty dollars. It was
torn up and a fire lighted under the tar.
He wrote a new check, this one for two
hundred dollars. It was accepted and this
certain rich man released amid the hoot
ing, the jeers and the contumely of all hi3
townsmen. Arizona doffs its wide
brimmed white Stetson to the brave, game
burg of-Yuma.
"But they are such solemn beggars,"
said London after viewing and cheering
and admiring our troops as they swung
down the streets of the famous old metrop
olis of the world. Yes, the American coi
diers may have more serious and solemn
faces than those of the gallant, laughing
Tommies and the firery Pcilu, but then
maybe they inherited this solemn face
from their Puritan ancestors, who, in Crom
well's day, were regarded as the best fight
ers in Europe, and who, in fact, performed
prodigies of valor at that time that stand
until this day as the acme of English accom
plishment against odds on the field of battle.
Forty thousand for the Red Cross war
fund from the Warren District and the
week is young yet. At no time since Am
erica has been in the war has the spirit of
patriotism and unselfishness and earnest
ness flamed so high as now. The German
drive kindled it and the great flow of Amer
ican troops to France added fuel to the
flame. It is declared that we will send two
hundred thousand soldiers to France in the '
month of May. This is America's answer
to the allied call for help. And the third
Liberty Bond drive and the second Red
Cross drive is the country's answer to the
government's call for support from behind
the lines.
Grimmer and yet more grim grows this
game of war. The administration has
asked for, and practically received, legisla
tion that provides authority to make every
man of draft age work or fight for his coun
try. Cnly in the past two months has it
come home to this nation at large the pro
portions of the job ahead. Men, munitions
and material in a constantly increasing and
never ending stream must flow to France
for months and months before this west
ward movensent and trend of the battle line
can be turned back eastward again towards
Berlin.
It is said that they speak thirty-four dif
ferent languages in Austria-Hungary; and
if the Emperor Charles told his majter,
Kaiser Bill, the truth at Berlin in their con
ference the other day, he told him that his
subjects were cursing both of them in all of
these thirty-four tongues, more different
kinds than have been raised in impreca
tions at one time since the work on the
tower of Babel was abandoned.
After his elaborate defense of the I. W.
W. strikers and bitter attack upon Bisbee
for deporting them. Gov. Hunt wa3
slapped directly in the face the first day's
session of his special legislature by the
unanimous passage of a resolution declar
ing unrelenting war on the I. W. W. within
the state.
Gov. Hunt in his message to the special
session of the legislature this week, "spared
the U. S. court' the trouble of trying the
I. W. W. cases against Bisbee," declares
the Tucson Citizen.

TUCSON JUNK DEALER
FGBGEQ TO CLOSE UP
TUCSON, May 23. Fred Richmond,
junk dealer at 128 Convent street, was
put out or business eaterday by
iwayor Parker and Chief of Police
Bailey as the beginning of a cam
paign to eliminate junk dealers who
persist in violating the ordinance
against the purchase of junk from
small boys.
Richmond was recently convicted
and fined $50 for buying city telegraph
cable from small boys. He promised
through his attorney, Billie Bush, not
to repeat the offense. Small boys who
stole brass plumbing fittings from G.
K, Smith were traced to his shop yes
terday and Richmond refused to per
mit a search of the place, forcing the
police to secure a search warrant.
Meanwhile he removed several sacks
of junk. When the police returned
with the warrant the goods could not
be found. He therefore escaped ar
rest. A conference between Chief Bailey
and Mayor Parker followed. The re
sult was that Richmond's license was
cancelled.
"Through the encouragement of
such men. gangs of boys have organ
ized themselves throughout the city
for the purpose of petty larceny," ex
plained Chief Bailey yesterday. "It is
impossible to catch all these boys, but
it is possible to stop their market by
suppressing the dishonest junk dealer.
"We intend to close up every dealer
who buys from these boys. The boys
will go free on their confession and
information.
"Nearly every backyard in the city
has suffered trom tho visits of these
boys who prowl about with gunny
sacks and little carts, ready to pick
up any article, of metal or rubber par
ticularly, that they can lay their hands
on. Every alley is the particular run
of a little bunch of boys and every
householder along the alley has suf
fered. It has got to stop and it w ill
stop if we close up the dishonest junk
man." Incidentally, the chief announced
closing of a series of small disorderly
houses masquerading as soft drink
stands.

All drug stores sell the ready-to-use

Crowder announced, however, that
there would be no dcci?ion until a
case arose throuph offi'Mi'l channels
and later the war department issued
this ofrmal slate ment:
"No rulinsr as to whether baseball

the regulations regarding idlers os

until a specific case his been appealed
to the provost marshal general's of

Secretary Baker explained that the
status of baseball players had been
discussed before the regulation was
approved and it was agreed that the
question could not be disposed of un
til all the facts relating to the effect
upon the baseball business has Ton
brought out through the hearing of a
case appealed from a local board.
The secretary did not profess to
know how seriously application of the
rule to professional ball players would
affect the leagues. He did not know
that a laree majority of the major
league players were of draft age and
were exempted only because of depen
dents, but cn the other hand -was un
der the impression that most of Uiem
were outside the draft limits.
The paragraph of the new regulation
which may touch the ball players is a
sub-division of the enumeration of the
classes affected, and says:
"Persons, including ushers and oth
er attendants, engaged in and occu
pied in, and in connection w-ith game,
sports and amusements, excepting act
ual performers in legitimate concerts,

If You Were There Instead of Here
IF you should see a French child a tiny girl sitting
by the roadside, sobbing quietly because she is too
weak trom hunger to cry very loud, you would sell
your watch to buy her breakfast
If you should hear somewhere in the restless
wards the low moan of an American soldier, you
would' gladly sit by him all night,. if that would save his
life.
You are not there, but here, where these sights and
sounds are not brought home to you! But the Red
Cross is there and you can make it your representa
tive! Over there the Prussians are crucifying the incar
nate Liberty of Man, and they are making the world
black for little children!
The money you give to the Red Cross now will
give you the right, when the Beast is beaten down, to
think. "There are happy children, clear eyed women
and strong men alive today, because my money went
across!"

Months and Only Weighed
96 Pounds Now Well
and Happy Again.
Still another comes forward and
adds her voice to the hundreds who
hav-3 already endorsed the wonderful
medicine, Tanlac. Mrs. Mamie Hali,
who lives at SOS Fourth avenue, south,
Nashville, Tenn., says she suffered for
years in l had fallen off until she only
weighed ninety-six pounds but that
she now weighs one hundred and fif

"I had a bad form of stomach
trouble," said Mrs. Hall, "and had suf
fered from it for years. I lost so much
flesh and was so weak that I was con
fined to my room and ted for eleven
months end my head ached so bad I
could Hardly stand it at times.
"Yes. they actually had to prop me
up in bed to take a drink of water as
I just couldn't help myself at all. I
lived on malted milk and graham
crackers. The pains in my chest made
me afraid I had lung trouble and mr
head acted so bad it seemed like it
would burst.
"Abo it a year ago I was taken to the
hospital, the doctors saying I had can
cer of the stomach. I was so nerv
ous all this time that the slightest
noise would almost drive mo mad and
the pains in my back hurt me so I
hardly got a night's rest.
"My husband was terribly out of
heart about me as the doctor said
nothing, v.ould save me but an opera
tion. We had spent a lot of money for
medicines and it seemed like nothing
would do any good.
"Well, sir, I happened to see a piece
irt the r:;per about Tanlac and it toM
about a woman in Louisville that was
suffering just exactly the same way I
was. I ueggnd my husband to let me
try it and he said he had no faith
in it, but he would Ret it if I wanted
it, so he got a bottle and we kept a
secret ficn: the doctor.
"That was the best thing I ever did
in my life, for I began to feel better
and gain weight with the very first
dose. I had gone down so I didn't
weigh but ninety-six pounds, but now.
after taking four bottles I weigh om
hundred uud fifteen five pounds more
than I ever weighed in my life.
"I now feel strong and well and can
do all my housework. I can eat any
thing wh, I acvtually ate a tomato
after I had been taking Tanlac a week
end that' something that never would
agree with me before. I have no more
of those terrible pains and I am doing
fine in tvery way.
"I got a letter yesterday from my
husband at Chattanooga and he said
he had taken two bottles of Tanlac and
was doing fine. I am going to Chat
tanooga Sunday and will sure take a
bottle of Tanlac in my grip. This med
icine just about saved my life and kept
me from having an operation."

little vessels will be passed alon? by
powerful machinery from one group
of workmen to another and, as it pass
es, each group will add something to
the boat.
When the last rivet has been driven
in the steel hull, the boat will be
picked up bodily by a powerful hy
draulic lift and deposited further
down the ways where skilled work
men will install the motor equipment.
Three ways have been constructed
each to hold seven of the submarine
chasers. It is generally understood
that the plant will be able to put into
the water one completed "Eagle" a
day and some estimates have placed
the number as high as three for each
twenty-four hours.
There will be no champagne chris
tenings nor elaborate launching cere
monies. No efforts are being made
to give the boats any touch cf artifi
cial beauty, the sole effort being to
turn out with as great speed as pos
sible an efficient weapon against Ger

MINE SWEEPERS WILL
SHARE HONORS FOR
U-BOAT CAMPAIGNS
LONDON, April 15. (Correspond
ence of The Associated Press) When i
the story of the humble mine-sweeper'
is fully told, many stirring pages will
' be added to the history oi anti-submarine
warfare, lor tins little craft
is sharing the work of the dashing
destroyer and "chaser" in running
down L'-bcais. A minesweeper in
variably drops its accdstouied busi
mss tor the bigger same and m;iny
an enemy submersible has been ac
counted tor by them.
Accoraing to official reports, there
are fcrty times more mine-swt epcrs
in commission today in the service of
t!ie allies, than in July, 1914.
1 Recently a fleet of six, all trawler, i
sighted a mine adrift. The rough sea :
prevented the boats from sinking the ;
mine by gunfire, darkness was com
ing on, and there was a possibility of
losing It. So the commander ap
proached the mine In a small boat, :
and when within some distance of the
drifting menace he tcok to the water
and swam the rest of the way. At
taching a line to the mine, he return
ed to his boat and towed it a.-diore,
where it was exploded by rifle fire.
Often days elapse before a mine
which has been discovered can be
destroyed. In a terrific gale, with
mountainous seas running, a party of
mine-sweepers tound a nest of eight
mines. The boats were unable to U3e
their guns on them and as night came
on the little vessels lay-to in immi
nent danger of being washed onto the
engines of death. Next day two of
the mines were sunk by gunfire, but
one of the sweepers was lost how,
the report does not state. It was not
until the evening of the fourth day
tnat the last of the mines was explod
ed. The trawler Manx King hauled up a
i;rne in such a dangerous position
that one horn of the mine came with
in a few inches of the boat's rail and
another was almost touching the gear.
The slightest roll of the vessel would
have caused its distruction. The dif
ficulty was met by lashing the mine
to the sweeper, so that it would not
be bumped against the side, and ex
perts were summoned to remove the
detonators from the dangerous pri::e.
Con:,;deral:'.e Investment is i6ln
made in development and nu!i)m?:it
at the Old Peck mines in the Brad
shaws. A strike of p-acock copper has hern
reported nt Jerome in the shaft of th

of a little over 1U0 feet.
