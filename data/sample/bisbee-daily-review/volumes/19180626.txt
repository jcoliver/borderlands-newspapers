Approximately One Million
Men Reach France in Year
With 650,000 Fighting Sol
diers Included
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON'. June 2.". The first
division of the American army landed
in France one year ago tomorrow.
eighteen days after General Pershing j
reached French soil. In the twelve
months that have since elapsed, this '
division has grown to on army in size ;
and by July a IniUisn men. all to?d: i
will have been sent forward. 1
Behind this million . another million j
men are in camps and cantonments. !
behind these a third million w ill rapid- !
ly fill the gaj)3 left as the divisions i
sail. 1
Secretary Baker estimated todav !
that between 65 and 75 per cent of
the men already shipped are com- !
batant troops. The first division has 1
teen expanded to a fighting force of ;
050,000 men, hacked by an organiza- I
tion of the supply and transport lines !
that it takes 250,00(1 men to make ef- .
fcctive. !
On this basis, it is clear General Per-
shlng now has the substance of the
first field army comprised of eighteen
infantry divisions with all auxiliary
troops. So far as known there has
been no opportunity yet for the actual
formation of this military unit.
American troops are holding sec
tors of varying lengths in at least six
places on the battle line. To meet the
emergency presented by the German
drive, however, they have been drawn
away from the region formally as-,
signed to the United States and are
face to face with the enemy on the
Marne, In Picardy and Flanders.
The real American sectors, however,
lie on the right flank of the great bat
tle front. From within sight of the
Swiss border where they stand on Ger- '
man soil, almost to the shadows of the 1
battered fortress of Verdun. American j
troops are in the trenches. i

vantage of the war to press the issue.

liquors from the working man does not
Interfere with his labor but instead
increases his efficiency. As a result
of his famous "dry" order in the navy.
Secretary Daniels said, "the morale of
the men had been greatly improved."
IRISH QUESTION
AGAIN TO FORE
IN COMMONS
(Continued from iMge One)
Intended to injura Ireland, but he re
gretted to say that there was no nee.l
for iurther invention, for the plot wa"s
a fact. When he rnd Viscount French
went to Ireland Mr. Shortt continue:!,
they fo ina the reappearance o? sedi
tious nronagandn in the form of poems,
pamphlets and notices-, posted on the
alls. Ini i iig 'the peonle to aid any
German force that might land in the
country.
"Any, rtrnw ami fciloer iakim hv the
German army," Mr. Shortt said one
of the posters read, ''will he paid for
by Gernnny."
"Mr. Shortt tioteil extracts from
tnsny hpeeches that had been delivered
urging ille?. d-M!incs for the pur
pose o' ntsi::t!ii5 Germany and -Rid
the. scurres of information upon which
the government relied to show Cieraiau
intrieue existed both in Ireland and
outside l';d always proved tru-c when
tested by subsequent events.
He stid he had traced the activity
of German ag"nts in Ireland from 1911
and asserted that at the beginning of
the war a pamphlet entitled "Ireland,
Germany, and the Freedom of the
Seas" had been in circulation in Ire
land. It bore evidence of being Ger
n an printed and for the last three
months had begun to reappe ir in Ire
land. it was here, the speaker said, the
government had found Germany was
in touch with Ireland and made refer
ence to the collapsible boat in which
the prisoner in the tower had landed.
It was r peculiar co-incidence Mr.
Shortt continued that upon Prof. Ed
ward De Y"Jera- member of parlia
ment for Fast ("hire, and a prominent
Sinn Feiner. was found the text of a

fn.sive bcan and that De Valera was
reminded mat the two months would
net be up until the enci of May.
Donald McNeill, unionist, interrupt
ing the speaker, asked: "Has the
writer been shot?"
"No." replied Mr. Shortt. "and un
less we are forced by those who call
themselves interned persons, we have
no desire for any more executions. If
we can protech the country and in
sure the realm without any more exe
cutions we want to do so. If it is other
wise the responsibility will be upon
those who force it, and not upon us."
Ex-Premier Asqiiith again appealed
to the government to refer the Irish
question to the dominions conference.
"The government," Mr. Shortt con
tinued, "is determined to put down dis
order. There is no democrat who would
allow peaceful citizens to be perse
cuted and ruined for their political
opinions, and the government does not
intend to allow it."
Mr. Shortt saia tnat men of all politi
cal parties and religions were assist
ing in recruiting, instancing one man
who had signed the anti-conscription
declaration and Col. Arthur Lynch,
who fought against the British in the
South African war.
Sir Edward Carson, the I'lster lead
er, said that if the premier believed he
was justified in order to carry on the
war in trying to bribe Ireland into
conscription, thereby incurring a grav
political risk, breaking a party truce
and shattering the foundations of the
I'nionlst party, he ought, in taking
this desperate course, at least to have
determined to go right through with
it.
"The Roman Catholic hierarchy," he
said, "has gnoe to lengths in opposing
conscription which no civilized mod
ern community ought to tolerate for
a moment. If you have to endure all
tills indignity and humiliation.- you
are crawling upon your knees to a
particular church."

MEASURE IS DISCUSSED
WASHINGTON, June 25. Extension
of the draft ages above and belov.- the
existing lii-nits 21 to 31 years was
discussed at length in the senate to
lay. During the discussion Senator Fall
revisei his r.mendment which changed
t'r.e ages 13 and 45, making tho agei
20 and 40 and eliminating a provis
ion that youths under 21 should uv
:e eal cd into active military service.
Disposal of the amendment and a
s i stitute by Senator Hitchcock of
Nebraska "vent over until tomorrow,
with sentiment apparently evenly di
vided. In the meantime some senators
legarded it as probable that some ex
pression might come from the admin
istration in view of a report that Pres
ident Wilson opposes any change lor
the present.
The Fall amendment was vigorously
utprorted by Senator Chamberlain jt
Organ, chairman of the military com
mittee and Senators Cummins a Iowa,
Itrcd of Missouri and others. Opposi
tion was voiced by Senators Thomas
of Colorado, McKellar of Tennessee
pud Klrby of Arkansas, all democrat
ic members of the military committee
while several other senators derlared
ihry favored raising the minimum
draft age, but opposed lowering the
minimum.
Senator Hitchcock's substitute
a:;icti'l:i:c:it lixes tho age limits at 20
and 4 ) respectively and provides that j
'itlzens of the allied countries re;i-j
dent in the I'nifed States shall be su'i- j

shall be disbarred from American citi-1

because all of the registrants in class

ITALIAN NEWS i.'.DfcrlNITE
WASHINGTON, June- 25. New
from Italy today whiie confirming the
great victory won by the ltaliai.s in
hurling the Austrian across the Piave
in disorganized retreat, threw little
additional light upon the extent of the
disaster. On the face cf the latest
news, it appeared to many observers
that the ustrian army, as an oti'ensiv:
weapon, is not to be seriously consid

by itself is believed here to be out ct

What Germany plans or will be able
to do is another matter. As yet there
is no sign of a great movement ot
German troops to the Italian front. Un
less such a movement is undertaken
immediately many officers here are
convinced it wiil mean that Germany
intends' to seek to save the situation

James Douglas
i ?
The death of Dr. James Douglas in New
York City yesterday morning marks the
passing of both a great and good man. He
made a mark in the world of science, not
alone because of his knowledge and ability,
but because of his progress and develop
ment along pioneer lines. He led in those
dark places along the wa' where one must
grope and struggle and toil and doubt and
often meet despair face to face before meet
ing success. He was also a recognized
authority upon many technical subjects
and his historical and scientific writings are
known and respected among men of learn
ing. He was a philanthropist upon no
small scale, but in this respect he kept his
light under a bushel to a degree that only
a few intimate friends probably know any
thing of the extent of his gifts and char
ities. As for the part he played in the de
velopment and building of this section of
the southwest, it can scarcely be estimated.
Few, if any, of the great mining fields of
this state but that have had his aid and
council when these were needed the most
in the old pioneer days.
He left his indelible mark upon the cop
per mining industry of Arizona. His genius
in. the science of the treatment of metals
led the way to the place this state now occu
pies at the head of copper producing states.
His faith in the Mule mountain ore bodie3
made Bisbee the greatest copper camp in
the world. Douglas, the smelter city, was
most appropriately named after the man
who did so much towards perfecting the
smelting of copper ore.
And the great southwest not only ad
mired Dr. Douglas for his talents and his
success and was grateful to him for all that
he had done for her, but she loves him for
the fine and noble qualities of his heart.
He was never too busy in his great works
to remember and to help a friend or com
rade of the old pioneer days. He made men
happy. Seldom indeed, searching among a
million men, can be found such great qual
ities of heart and mind in one tenement of
clay.
Dr. Douglas' imprint is upon the south
west, graven as deep as the deepest shaft in
any mountain side, and marked by wonder
ful cities and camps in the pleasant, sun
kissed, wind-swept Arizona .valleys. Yes!
But it is deeper still, and more lasting still,
in the hearts of hundreds of men who were
here in the old days and who knew Dr.
Douglas face to face and as man tc man.
When these men speak of him it is not of
the scientist, the writer, the organizer, that
thev speak; it is the MAN. And, please
God, whatever its faults or failings or
shortcomings or roughness or newness that
the southwest may have, it has always
been a hard, true iudere of MEN! And
this, its verdict of Dr. James Douglas, will
stand forever and for aye.
j Morale
It is too soon yet to estimate the im
portance and effects of the Austrian check
and final retreat behind the Piave after
winning a hold on the western bank. De
tails are lacking and the Italian counter
stroke ha3 not yet had time to develop.
It may be only a withdrawal for Austria,
and again it may be a disaster. In either
case its moral effect for the worse will be
tremendous in Austria and felt not a little
in Germany. In the allied nations this
moral effect will be for the better. It has
been a long time since we have had any
news of a victory. Not since General
Byng threw the Germans back at Cambrai
late last fall. And new3 of this success
comes from a line that we feared might be
bent back at the worst, if not broken. Aus
tria mustered 100,000,000 men and nearly
8000 cannon for this offensive. Its result
shows that either Italy is very strong or
Austria is very weak in offensive power in
-spite of her numbers and her guns. After
all, it is the heart and not the arm or the
weapon that wins battles in the long run,
when numbers and resources are anywhere
near equal. The late news from the Italian
front is not as good as it might be; the
Austrian are resisting desperately and
seem to be making their withdrawal in
some order; but still it is mighty good
news. And better news may yet come,
when the entire Italian line sweeps forward.
A very small incident may well change this
retreat into a rout. Anyway, Germany and
Austria, striking their hardest blows with
their full strength, have found the allies all
there and ready for more. The bluster of
the March winds looked brighter to Kaiser
Wilhelm than does the red sheen of the
June roses.
It's a Long Way to Venice
It's a long way to Venice by the moun
tain route, and it is longer still by the Piave.
Looks like there might be some pretty foot
sore Austrians before they embark in a
gondola bound for the step3 of the doege's
palace. They will probably stop awhile on
the way at the bridge of sighs.
TheMarines
"Who told the kaiser that those Amer
icans could not fight?" This is the wail
of the picked shock troops of the most
famous regiments of the Prussian empire at
Bailleu Wood. When the Germans lashed
forward across the Chemin des Dames and
clear on to the Marne, the 28th and 5th
Prussian guards' divisions led the way.
They were pretty badly cut up by the end
of May and were sent to the rear to rest,
with the promise that they would not be
used again soon. Then the Americans be
gan to get gay at Chateau Thierry, and on
June 6th these two German divisions were
called again to the front, this time to chas
tise the insolent and untrained American
levies. But German prisoners taken from
both these regiments recently declare that
they were worse punished by the Amer
ican marines in this last mess of fighting
than in all the long and bloody way from
Chemin des Dames to the Marne.
Wax Stamps
In war the dollar wisely used fights for
this country like a man well armed, says
the Washington Times. Every citizen
should keep every dollar at work' even the
loose change harnessing it up in the shape
of war stamps for the quarters and dollars,
Liberty binds for larger amounts.
The government lets you become a patri
otic hoarder on a basis that produces the
following three remarkable results:
First You cannot lose your money. It
cannot be stolen;
Second While it is hoarded beyond all
possible reach of danger, it is earning liberal
interest for you, every hour, working or
sleeping, you are gradually getting richer;
Third In addition to being safe and
earning interest for ycu, the monsy wisely
hoarded in government bonds or war
stamps ij actually at work fighting for your
country. ,
Do not think it unnecessary to say it and
repeat the simple fact.
To your children, to the many who look
upon finance as a mystery, it is your duty,
because you knew more, to explain the
facts, every day. Such explanation is use
ful, necessary war work.
No cne person may own rriore than
$ 1 ,000 worth of these stamps.
Carnegie, Rockefeller, dozens of others
would buy them by the millions if allowed
to. As far away as the Argentine Repub
lic, intelligent people are investing their
money in these war stamps, seizing the op
portunity never known before and never to
be known again, to invest money at com
pound interest, which means interest on the
interest.
Take a one-dollar bill, or a thousand
dollar bill, and you will read "The United
States of America will pay to the bearer
on demand."
That is all your money is A PROMISE
TO PAY.
Your war stamp or government bond i3
a promise to pay PLUS INTEREST.
And war stamps and Liberty bonds rep
resent the government's promise lo pay
BEFORE IT PAYS ANYTHING ELSE.
If necessary this government would take
every dollar owned by every rich man in
the country to pay those bonds and those
war stamps.
The child with one dollar in stamps has
an investment safer than any that John D.
Rockefeller owns, except the government
stamps or bonds that he has bought.
Everything else may go down, but gov
ernment securities will be 100 cents on the
dollar plus interest as long as the govern
ment stands.
KUCHLER HOLDS OVER
ON STATE TAX
COMMISSION
Judge Lyman in Superior
Court at Phoenix Grants
Injunction to Prevent Elec
tion of Member
PHOENIX, Oriz., June 25. Arter a
hearing in the superior court here
.Monday, Judge Frank Lyman granted
an injunction against Sidney 1. Os
toru, secretary of state, to restrain
hint from placing in the call for the
general election the office ot state tux
commissioner.
Attorney General Wiley 'Jones had
ruled that Rudolph Kucnler, appoint
ed by Gov. Tom Campbell to suc
ceed himself would have to run
nguin this year. It was Mr. Kuchler's
contention that his term would not
expire until December 31, 1920.
The case was brought by Andrew
Uaumcrt, jr., secretary of the repub
lican stato committee, to restrain the
sccretaiy of state from permitting
the nomination and election of a
state tax coinmisisoner this fall. 1".
C. Struckmeyer was uttorney in the
case lepreseriting Sidney P. Osborn,
secretary of state. D. H. Claridgs,
who is a candidate for state tax com
missioner, and the attorney general's
office. He was assisted by George
Harbin. Kibbey, Bennett & Curtis
and W. E. Ryan, attorney represent
ing the plaintiff.
Contest Struckmeyer Remedy.
Attorney Struckmeyer's main con
tentions tvere that he court should
not grant the injuctior. for the rea
son that a contest could be brought
after the election and at that time
the matter of who was entitled to the
office could be decided upon by the
courts, and that the people should
have a chance to vote. Struckmeyer
was attorney for Governor Hunt tn
the Hunt-Campbell contest and this
may be the real cause of bis interest
in a contest. He further contends that
the attorney general should render
and settle all such questions and that
it is the proper business of his of
fice. The attorney general, on April S,
1918, did render a written opinion to
the effect that there should be an
election for tax commissioner this
fall. A part of this opinion is as
follows:
"The law as originally passed as
Chapter 23 in 1912 with an emer
gency clause thereto, was approved
May 9, 1912, and became effective
on that date. On May 12, 1912.
Governor Hunt appointed C. M. Zen
der first term to expire January 1,
1913; Charles R, Home, term to ex
pire January 1. 1915; George Michel
son, term to expire January 1 1917.
These appointments were re-arranged
by the subsequent resignations of all
three of the above named, and on
June 1, 1913, Governor Hunt made ap
pointments as tax commissioners as
follows: P. J. Miller to succeed Zan
der, resigned, for the term ending
January 1, 1913; C. M. Zander, to suc
ceed Howe, resigned, for term ending
January 1, 1915; Charles R. Howe,!
to succeed Michelson , resigned, for
term ending January 1, 1917."
Campbell Elected; Question How
Long
Struckmeyer did not question that
Thomas E. Campbell was elected as
tax commissioner in 1914, but does
contend that he was only elected for
a term of four years and that C. M.
Zander who ran for the same office
was elected for six years. That Zan
der succeeded himself and that Camp
bell succeeded P. J. Miller, who was
supposed to be a hold-over, and that
his term from 1912 to 1914 shouH
apply on the term of Thomas E.
Campbell who was elected in 1914,
the first state election held for tax
commissioner.

CHICAGO. June 25 Indications
that the com market had become
greatly over-sold brought about a mod
erate upturn in prices today, empha
sized a little by intense heat over parts
of the southwest. The close was i'irm,
1 to 19 cents net higher, with July
$1.44 to $1.44 and August ?1.47'i.
Oats linished at olf to 4 cents ad
vance and provisions up to 17 to 5
cents.
Notwithstanding that beneficial
rains had fallen in Ohio, Indiana, Illi
nois, Missouri and Kansas, the corn
market averaged higher throuchou:
the day. Numerous transient setbacks
took place, but none of the radical
6ort besides smallenss of receipts
here attracted some notice from the
bulls, despite the fact that the IMne op
tion appeared relatively weak.
Hedging sales, together with id'-pl
weather, tended to keep down values
in the oats market. Country offer
ings were free.
Sharply higher quotations on hogs
lifted provisions.- Stock yard interests
did most of the buying.

AERIAL DEFENSE
FROM PIM HEWSjM
AN AVIATION CAMP IN KUAN( K.
May L'O. (t'ori' siiimils'ticj of th," As
sociated Press) Criticism in one Am
erican newspaper of the American Atr
Service on the ground that there has
been an unnecessarily large number
of accidents has ftvoked a retort from
Plane News, published by the Ameri
can aviators in traiiMnj; here.
Records show, says the aviators' or-
g;m, that about sixty men "made the
supreme sacrifice" last year while in!
training. One Aineriiun newspaper, it'
asserts, has endeavored to account tor
these fatalities as having been caused
by "cramped spare" wJiich the men
have to fly in and has asked whether
"the supervision of our aviation camps
is in the hands of officers who know
their business."
"Only a small percentage of the fa
talities have be-"n caused by collision
and other causes were of various nat
ure which were beyond any govern
ment control," says Plane News. "The
majority of instruction centers have
outlying tields where men in the va
rious stages in training are coiifiend.
"The officers in charge are as com
petent as can be had. Many are West
Point men of long military
training
and nearly all have become expert
aviators themselves. They know if any
body ever will, the dangers of flying
and the necessary precautions to take
"Tight places are bound to confront
every pilot in the course, of his train
ing and are the finest 'examples' in
the world if the aviator is able to nav
igate the danger with success, for it
gives him the needed confidence for
similar experiences in the future. Safe
flying is largely a matter of intuition,
which sense can only be acquired
thrcugh constant practice of long dur
ation. "The training of an aviator, from
the beginning, assumes practically the
same dangers as actual service in the
air at the front, wlii h is not the case
in the training of any oth'T branch in
the service. Therefore it is little won-1
der that the loss of a few men in train-1
ing should stir the pu'ilic to believing
that carelessness has h;:d its part in
causing the losses. '
"The machine a pilot begins on is i
safer than each succeeding machine I
he is taught to handle and it is signi
ficant to ncte just what training will
do for the flyer. For instance, the
casualties for the most part conic
w.hcn the pi ot is operating the largest
and safest planes. Few casualties are
recorded of the lighter and faster
types which are exceedingly hard to
handle and susceptible to the least
wrong move on the part of the pilot.
"Considering that in practice there
is practically the same danger clement
as there is iiv flying at the front, the
percentage of casualties is very low in
comparison to the great number of fly
ers in training. Were the actual fig
ures made knov. v tf jm t v hat is br
ing r.ccompli.-died in daily flights, land
ings, mileage and acrobatics, surpris
ing facts would be revealed as to just
how wonderful a progress is being
made in American aviation witli such
little loss."

Father Notified From France
and Washington That No
Effort to Locate Him is
Being Neglected
In spite of the concentrated efforts
of all the forces brought to bear upon
the search for Ralph Klin wood of
this city, the missing youth has not
been found. The only information re
ceived by his father, Hon. E. E. Ellin
wood of Bisbee, since the original tele
gram telling of his disappearance,
came yesterday from V. H. Brophy,
in France, and from Senator Henry F.
Ashurst, at Washington, d. C
Mr. Ashurst's message, which Is
more specific then ?.Ir. Hrophy's cable
gram, says:
On May 21, Ralj.h was in a certain
town which Uic Germans were furious
ly shelling. Ralph and comrades were
ordered to occupy crtain cellar or
basement This was the last definite
knowledge of his whereabouts and in
asmuch as this cellar and every other
cellar in the town was thoroughly
searched without funding any trace of
him the conclusion is that he was
taken prisoner, investigations contin
uing. " ASHURST.
Mr. Brophy's message says:
Several weeks, before you will re
ceive definite information. Doing ev
erything possible here.
BROPHY
Mr. Ellinwood daily has been ex
pecting a message from the Red Cross
or other agency working in conjunc
tion with the neutral powers, ,telling
him where his son can be found. He
now believes that his son is Jn a Ger
man prison camp.

Colodny has returned from Bisbee.
where he made ah inspection of the
work being done in the high school
there under the Smith-Hughes act
which provides federal aid for schools
doing vocational work in compliance
with the .act. He found the work
being done, he stated, in a highly effi

In speaking of the Bisbee schools the
director declared them to be of a high
order. "Whatever is needed for the
Bisbee schools is supplied without
question," declared Colodny. "The
Copper Queen and the other big cor

tinued, "but the spirit of libraiity
shown towards the public schols of Bis

are second to none."
While in Bisbee, Director Colodny
inaugurated a radio and buzzer school
for the teaching of wireless telegraphy

ANOTHER PEACE DRIVE
WASHINGTON. June 25. Ger
many's latest declaration of war aims,
as enunciated yesterday in the Ber
lin reichstag by Dr. Von Kuehlman.
minister of foreign affairs, was regard
ed today by officials here as merely
another phase in Germuny's old cycle
of military drives and pe-ace often
sives.
In the official view. Dr. Von Kuehl
j matin's only new contribution was the
attempt to fasten principal responsi
bility for planning the war upon Kus
I sia, the only great nation whose pow
j er ha3 been broken by the Teutonic
i military and propaganda machines,
j Since Germany previously had con
i tended that Kngland and. to a lesser
! degree. France, were responsible for
the hostilities this move by the min
ister ouly served to strengthen the
1 belief that a main purpose of the.
' speech was to invite peace proposals
irom the west, although no nientioii
i was made of peace negotiations.
BASIS OF PEACE

In the reichstag today Imperial Chan
cellor Count Von Hertliiig said:
"1 said that these four points of
President Wilson mig'U possibly form
the basis of a general world peace. No
utterance ;f President Wilson wha-c-ver
followed this. So that there is no
object in rpinning any further the
threads there started.
"There is still less objective for aft

reached us. especially from America.
These statements, indeed, made i'
really clear what is to be understood
a peace league of peoples or a
league of people for the maintenance
of freedom and jus;ice." THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JUNE 26, 1918.

H
NOTED LECTURER
ON TEMPERANGE
ENDORSES TANLAC
Mrs. Martha Stone Was for
Years Associated With
Founder of W. C T. U.
One of the features that distinguish
es Tanlac from all other proprietary
medicines is the large number of
prominent people who everywhere art
giving it their unqualified endorse
ment. Among the statements recently
received at tne Tanlac office is one
in particular that is sure to arouse
widespread interest throughout the
country, having been made by Mrs.
Martha R. Stone, of 7225 Third avenue.
North West, Seattle, Wash., noted tem
perance lecturer who for many years
was associated with the late Frances
E. Willard. founder of the W. C. T. I'.
In relating her experience with Tanlac
Mrs. Stone said:
"I think it is tho duty of everyone
who has been relieved as I have to Co
what they can to help others; there
fore it gives mc much pleasure o tell
of the benelits I have derived from -lie
use of Tanlac.
'T was a great sufferer for maiiv,
years with nervous trouble, which be
came so bad that-1 had to take to my
bed, where I lay for six weeks entirely
and unable to move. The least Mtlie
noise would upset me and I wa not
allowed to see anyone for fear it wouki
excite me, and I was told that my en
tire nervous system had suffered a to
tal collapse. You see, I had passed
through the great San Francisco lire
in which I lost everything I possessed,
and the experience was a severe shock
to my already overwrought nerves.
When at last I wa3 able to get out of
bdd I would have such awful dizzy
spells that everything in my rJom
seemed to spin around as thougn I was
in the center of a whirlpool. My stom
ach was so weak and my appetitie so
poor that I hardly, ate a thing, and
what little I forced down soured and
formed gas that pressed up into my
throat and in my chest and made
me so hoarse that it was an effort for
me to speak. I also sulfered much
pain in the lower part of my body from
this same gas pressure. My liver, too,
was all out of order and my kidneys
gave me no end of trouble.
"When my son-in-law saw that the
medicines I was taking were doinjj me
no good, he induced me to try Tanlac,
as he said it hs.d done him so much
good he believed it would help me too.
To oblige him I got me a bottle and
the firct few doses-eoon convinced me
that it was juot what I needed, and
my first bottle put me right on my
feet. I am now on my second bottle
and am in splendid shape, for my
nerves are practically in a normal
state ior the first, time in all tnese
years, which I consider a remarkaMe
thing. I have a fine appetite and can
eat most anything J want without suf
fering any unpleasantness afterwards.
Tanlac is fast helping me to overcome
my troubles, and I feel that I-am get
ting on just fiue eer since I began
taking it."
Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Bowie
by Bowie Drug Store, in San Simon by
J. B. Cooke, in Willcox by A. A. Nichol

MRS. B. HATTICH DIES
SATURDAY IN
LOS ANGELES
Was One of Pioneer Women
of Tombstone and Was
Mother of Former Editor of
Tombstone Prospector
The sad news came to Tombstone
yesterday of the death Saturday night
of Mrs. Kate Hattich, wife of the
late Col. B. Hattich, and mother of
William Hattich, former publisher of
the Prospector and Epitaph. The
news came in a wire from J. D. Ala
chomich, son-in-law of Mrs. Hattich,
at whose home she passel away, at
the age of seventy-two years.
Mrs. Hattich left Tombstone in poor
health with her son and husband
I about four years ago when her son
' disposed of the Prospector to the
present owners, going from here to
j Tucson, where it was hoped the low

They remained in Tucson for over a
year removing to Los Angeles follow
ing the death of Colonel Hattich.
where the coast climate proved of con
siderable benefit to her, and she was
able to be about during her stay there
until of late, when 3he underwent a
minor operation from which nhe had
practically recovered according to
word received here last week. While
the news received yesterday did not
state the cause of death, it is be
lieved she suffered a relapse from
the operation and passed away sud:
denly. The news will come as a
shock to her many pioneer friends in
Tombstone and Cochise county, since
it was expected that she had recover
ed for although seventy-two years of
age, had gone through the operation
successfully.
Mrs. Hattich came to Tombstone In
the early eighties with her husband,
both remaining here until they remov
ed to Tucson in 1913. She leaves be
sides her son, a daughter. Airs. J. D
Machomich, who has resided at Los
Angeles since her marriage. Through
out all hej illness she was attended
by her son and daughter, who devot
ed practically all their time to her,
Mr. Hattich giving up all his business
interests to remain constantly with
his mother during her last years, and
a son was never more devoted to his
mother in seeing to her every want.
In the passing of Mrs. Hattich
Tombstone will lose another pioneer
woman who braved the early day
hardships, paving the way for the
better things which those who have
come after now enjoy. . She was -a
kind mother and a good neighbor,
and many will be the regret, especial
ly among the old-timers, to learn of
her sudden passing away, and many
telegrams of condolence were sent
today to Mr. Hattich and his sister in
their hour of sorrow.
The funeral was held yesterday aft
ernoon from the residence of her
daughter at Los Angeles.

PASSES TO UNKOWN

company, then copper brokers, sug
gested that this Canadian engineer
should go out into the southwest an'l
I look at the country with a view to
development of copper mines. He was
glad to go. He came first to Clifton,
where they were hauling copper ore
1300 miles to a railroad. Then he
went to Globe where he took more
than a passing interest in the copper
! prospects and possibilities of that
I day.
It may be remarked here that most
of the first metal discoveries in the
mountains of Arizona were first made
by soldiers hunting Apache Indian? on
the war trail.
Dr. Douglas then went down to h
Warren district where he found men
at work mining copper. His trained
eye and gifted understanding at once
told him that here was the most
promising field in- Arizona for copper.
He had often since told friends th.'t
he FELT that the Warren district was
the best, and that this instinctive feel
ing, as much as his knowledge and
experience as a mining engineer had
influenced him when he recommended
tc the Phelps Dodge company to make
their Investments and stake their all
bn this field. '
It id well known how the company
Kent men here and took claims and
risked everything, down to their last
$50,000 dollars on the word and faith
of Dr. Douglas.
But Dr. Douglas did not stop with
his recommendations as an engineer.
He was a scientist as well as an engi
neer. His advisory work on treatment
of low grade ores 'revolutionized this
phase of the copper Industry. He was
instrumental in placing Arizona low
grade ore first in the crusher. He j
introduced the water jacket furnace.
He was a pioneer in the field of treat
ing' ores, before shipment, even in a
crude manner. And most of the im- j
provements in this process, step by j
step, were due largely to the discover- j
ies of Dr. Douglas. j
Again, he did not confine his ac-!
tivities to the Warren district or ,
where his own Interests lay. He ad
vised and aided many camps with
their many problems of the early days
of the industry in this new country.
It was Dr. Douglas who first discover
ed the merit of the Nacozari ores and
he had much to do with their develop
ment. He also helped in the develop
ment of the Cananea field, and at
Jerome and Morenci and Globe. His
advice was asked ' f6r and given as
late as the development of the Ajo
field.
And in all that wonderful progress
of the development of converters up
to the final triumph of 99 per cent
pure copper he had a hand. His gre.tf
knowledge and wide experience; his
marvelous sight in the darkness of
new channels of scientific discovery,
he used to the uttermost in the in
tricate problems that blocked the way
of the mine owner, the smelter man
and the broker in placing pure copper
on the market in its most useful
form in the greatest quantity at the
lowest price. i '
The city of Douglas was named aft
er Dr. James Douglas. And it was Dr.
Douglas who planned the building of
the El Paso & Southwestern railway
and was the road's first president
Nearly all of the more distinguished
and successful of the copper operators
and managers of Arizona were trained
and helped in their earlier days by Dr.
Douglas, and notable among these are
two sons, James S- and Walter, the
latter now himself president of the
great mining company of which his
father was at one time the head.
Dr. Douglas was a philanthropist,
and upon no small scale, although be
was inclined to conceal rather than to
advertise this fact. His benefactions
to colleges, hospitals and charities to
taled very large sums, the most no
table of these doubtless being for the
General Memorial hospital in New
York City. He was especially interest
ed in this hospital's treatment of can
cer by radium and extended aid more
than once to advance this most ex
pensive of all treatments of disease.
Among the institutions of learning
that he has endowed 1b the University
of Arizona.
But after all, it was not of these
great successes and achievements and
benefits that men who knew him talk
ed of yesterday In the district when
the news of his death came, but rathr
of the man himself and his qualities
of heart and net of his qualities of
mind.
These things Rave mostly to do
with Dr. James Douglas, the great en
gineer and scientist: the successful or
ganizer: the pioneer in new fields:
the builder of railroads and director
of large enterprises. There is anoth
er side, and one which many people
will call the finer and the greater side.
He had, at one time. It Is declared
by old residents here, a speaking ac
quaintance all over Arizona. He was,
in the days of his residence here., in
close touch with the business and so
cial life of the community. He loved
the southwest where he had wrestled
mightily with great problems and done
great thjngs. He saw a mining camp
become a large and prosperous indus
trial center, largely as a result of his
discoveries and appliances. And so it
was that his voice, his influence and
his purse were at the service of ev
ery cause that was worthy an i ivcry
work and plan that had the build hi g
and improvement of the district at
heart. And he solved a higher end
more noble problem tjian any labora
tory or mine or smelter ever knew
when he made men happy. It is said
of him that he helned many men of th
old days with whom he had worked
and played here, and 'that he did fn
that fine and happy solrlt that a com
rade helps snot her. He left a memory
behind of Dr. Douel.n. the man, that
will outlive even that of Dr. Douglas,
the scientist and enrlneer and devel
oper of great industries.
