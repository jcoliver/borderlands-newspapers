GERMAN SITUATION DELICATE
UNDATED WAR LEAD, BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. Without pause
the British forces battling against
the Germans are moving forward in
the direction of Bapaume. The fight
ing has been extremely heavy, but
there has been no stopping Field Mar
shal Haig's men, and the iatest report
from British headquarters says that
they are making progress along the
entire front of the British attack.
The important towns of Bray,
Thiepval and Grant-court, together
with several smaller places have been
captured and more than 2000 prisoners
have been taken.
Around Miraumont, which lies a lit
tle north of Grandcourt, thefighting
has been of great intensity, and the
place apparently has fallen, as Haig's
report says that "the enemy held out
until outflanked by advancing col
umns." British detachments have reached
Avesnes-Lez-Bapaume, which lies. very
cose to Bapaume, whose capture is
expected at an early date, but not
without severe fighting.
American troops holding the ground
around Fismes have moved up to the
SoissomvRheims road- along a front of
about half a mile, while the French,
though not extensively engaged, have
made some progress south of Crecy-Au-Mont.
Fighting a battle which In Its intens
ity rivals any combat of the war, along
the westemfront, the British forces
from the Oojeul river, near Arras, to a
point far south of the Somme are ap
parently slowly gaining ground at
some points.
The storm center of the battle dur
ing the past day has seemed to be in
the nelghborhool of Baupaume. Early
dispatches on Saturday told of British
troops within a couple of miles of the
town, but later reports showed that
the Germans, determined to save Ba
paume from the allies, had rushed
new forces into the struggle.
It seems that the enemy has suc
ceeded in slowing up the British, if
they have not stopped them north and
west of Bapaume. The importance of
the town from a tactical standpoint

his attitude in the political campaign
for the democratic nomination for gov

Incumbent in the office and the chief
promotor of the political fortunes or
Fred Colter, was aroused to the point
where he made a public speech in de

Lake, ten miles north of here.
Governor Hunt reached Ash Fork
last night and waited there for his
automobile which wag sent from Pres
cott to meet him. He did not arrive
at the picnic grounds until after Fred
Sutter, candidate for the nomination
for governor and the chief critic of
the present administration and the
Colter ring had finished speaking.
Sutter, therefore, had no opportunity
to reply to him.
In his speech Sutter briefly but
clearly outlined his policies and plat
form. He promised his hearers that.
If nominated and elected, he would
clean out of the state capitol the pres

WASHINGTON, Aug. 24. Announc
ing that to date more than 1,500,000
American soldiers have embarked for
Foreign shores. General March reiter
ated today his belief the presence of
4,000,000 troops of the United States
in France by next summer would en
able the allies to carry out any canv
paign they may adopt for the defsat
of Germany and the end of the war.
Such declarations. General March said,
were founded upon cold blooded study
of the respective man power of all the
allies and of the enemy in June, 1919,
and "are not issued as spreadeagle
statements."
General March Impressed the news
papermen who met him In conference
today with the absolute confidence
American officers have In their men as
a result of the initial tests on the bat
tle fields of France. He intimated
that the somewhat sensational predic
tion which he had made was based
as much upon these soldierly quall
ities as in the numerical superiority
which the war department plan3 t
give the allied command by mid- sum
mer of next year.
"The American soldiers deserve the
confidence of the American people"
said General March, "on every occas
ion so far where he has been tested
he has absolutely delivered the goods.
"My confidence in them Is Inspired
and developed by serving with them
and beside them In battle. I have
ordered back from France certain men
who have won distinction over there
to give them increased rank In the di
visions organizing at home. These men
talk the same language I do. You c'o
not find any lack of confidence on the
front in France among the American
forces.
"These officers are telling me inter
esting things which have not yet come
over in official reports. One of-icer le
Dorted specifically that in one engage
ment of the t"lr8t American division.
they captured 68 German guns ana
brought them In at the rear of our
trucks. On the same occasion they
took 3500 prisoners."
"Another officer reported that the
second division, which he was with,
captured ten complete German batter
ies which they brought in and present
ed to General Pershing."
No recent reports have been made
to the department on the progress of
the organization of the first United
States Field army, and the chief of
staff-was unable to say whether the
concentration of the thirty divisions
definitely assigned to this forcu was
nearlng completion.
This organization' Is being left en
tirely in the hands of General Persh
ing who is governed by instructions
from General Foch.
Discussing the changes on the west
ern front since last Wednesday. Gen
eral March said the French operating
in the Noyon sector have now ad
vanced across the plateau overlooking
that important base until they have
reached the Oise and have progressed
northeast to the Ailette. The enemy
has been pushed out of Carlepont for
est, south of Noyon, and behind the

emphasized that "the fine work of the

The nation's war industries are fighting a serious situation through
shortage ri:ht now of millions of unskilled workers. With coming ex

Are Held
The second roundup of men of draft
age in the history 01 mis district, to
enforce upon the public mind the ne
cessity of all men carrying their
classification cards took place, last
night at Warren park during the "pul
lie dance. As a result 132. men with
out cards were taken from the park to
the C. & A. general office for examina
tion and twenty-three of them were
held for examination. There was noth
ing to show that this number of men
ever had registered or otherwise com
piled with the law. In addition, eigh
teen 20 year old men were held to fur
nish proof of their statement as to
age, in order to do which they must
produce birth certificates.
The dance was at it8 height when
Dr. N. C. Bledsoe mounted on theband
stand, stopped the musk and an
nounced that the men and women
were to separate. The men when they
learned the reason for stopping the
dance, cheerd the doctor and Mr.
Krebs.
Acting under orders of Dr. Bledsoe
and held in line by officers and cit
izen volunteers, the men filed past Mr.
Krebs who asked each one for hU
card. The 132 who had no cards then
were taken to the C. & A. general of
fice. As rapidly as the statement that
they had registered was verified, they
were dismissed from the office and re
turned to the dance.
In but one or two instances was
there any disposition on the part of
the men to accept their temporary
discomforture in anything except a
proper spirit One man showing more
temper than sense declined that he
never had carried a card and never
would However, he was made to see
the error of his way In short order.
"We are doing to keepkat thiswork
from time to time in Cochise county
until we have all the slackers and

District Organizer Here This
Week to Confer With
.County Labor Board Re
garding Work
Cochise county has been called upon
to furnish 525 unskilled laborers to
the national government, to be taken
anywhere they may be needed. Fol
lowing a visit from Jack Angus, dis
trict organizer for the eastern tier of
counties, during the week, U was an
nounced that the Bisbee-Douglas com
munity labor board had been named
and would get' to work in the Imme
diate future, registering and classify
ing labor or every kind, ready for the
government's call. '
The composition of the committee is
James H. East, of Douglas, county re-'
serve director and cnairman, repre
senting the government; R. J. Wilbert,
P. O. Box 238, Bisbee. representing
labor; Harry A. Clark. Douglas, repre
senting the management.
"The Cochise county board has been
somewhat slow in acting on account
of the absence of Mr. East, who Is J
in California, and on account of mv
own absence attending the union con
vention in Denver," said Mr. Wilbert
yesterday. "Mr. East will return here
in a day or two. In the meantime
I am doing what I can on this on 1
to get things in shape for action
by the committee and while I havo
heard nothing from Mr. Clark, who Is
superintendent of the C. & A. smelter
in Douglas, I feel sure he is doing
likewise. Whenever Mr. East returns
the board will get together and outline
a plan, following which Mr. East
doubtless will issue a call to all mea
in the county, telling them what to do.
"1 want to place myself on rec
ord as saying that labor, though my
sell as Its representative, desires
nothing so much as to co-operate
whole heartedly for the success of the
war.
"A step which I considered neces
sary in the advancement of the pro
gram of ascertaining the capabilities
of every man in this district, I took
yesterday when I appointed enrolling
agents In Bisbee. The ones I have
designated so far are O. S. French, of
the Annex soft drink stand. Main
street; Mr. Poppy, whose paint shop
ia on O. K. street, and there will be
others at the union hall on O. K. street
at almost all hours of the day. Other
agents to enroll in Lowell and Warren
will be named as soon as the board
organizes.
"It Is my Idea that every man
should register, telling not only what
he has bo'en doing recently, but what
other - things he knows how to do.
These men will be card Indexed and
when a call comes for unskilled or
I skilled labor we would be in a position
to furnish it immediately.
"A number of businesses now oper
ating, have been declared non-essential
by the government. Many of the
men engaged In them are skilled min
ers. 1 believe we can draw from this

WASHINGTON. Aug. 24 The rew
manpower bill, extending the selective
draft to all men between the ages of i
IS and 45 years, was passed by the
h-ji.re tonighi with only slight
changes in the original draft of tun
war department
The final vote was 336 to 2.
The final vote was preceded by
three day's debate during which the
chief contention was an amendment
to defer the calling of youths from 1j
to 20 years until older men had hen
summoned. A final effort was made
by Chairman Dent today to place the
18 year old boys in a deferred class,
but a motion to recommit the bill to
the military committee with instruc
tions to incorporate that amendment
was lost. 191 to 146.
The bill new goes to the senate,
where leaders tonight predicted its
passage early next week. The senate
plans to substitute the house bill foi
the measure favorably reported by
the military committee of that body
and thus expedite its final enactment.
Congressional leaders hope to send
the measure to the president by the
latter part of next week.
The senate soon after convening un

today and adjourned until Monday, j

was characterized by officials of the

By a rising vote. S3 to 143. it de
feated an amendment by Representa
tive Gregg of Texas, which would
make members of congress, state leg

tive officers liable to draft.
An amendment by Representative
Smith of New York, to exempt police
officers In cities of more than 500,000
population ,and designed to relieve
the situation In New York, where a
shortage of policemen is said to be
threatened, was defeated.
An amendment by Representative
Treadway of Massachusetts which
was adopted, provides for the ap
pointment of speclap examiners in
local districts for the re-examination
of men placed in deferred classifica
tion as a means of further combing
the deferred classes for additional
men, for active service.
Chairman Dent, of the house mili
tary committee read a letter today
from Secretary Baker. In which the
latter set forth his objectiens to the
McKenzie amendment, which was de-
feated yesterday and which provides
for deferring the call of youths from

jnswer made by the people on the

That is not a fill measure of the Red
Van'n generosity, however, for the re

the general population. j
Resorting to methods of the white j
man to raise money, the Omaha triboj
recently held an auction for the Red
Cross which netted $2,000,. including
$i0 for a prize goat.
The boys of a school in the north

some 4'iu ( nnsimns unit's were re

service flags with stars ranging in
number from a few to 200, and the
pupils of these schools are very mind
ful of their soldier representatives.
One of tho larger schools reported a
student's friendship war fund,, with (
$750 on hand and twelve war savings j
societies. .This school in four weeks;
bought 1000 thrift stamps and four
teen baby bonds.
On a small reservation fa,r north,
where the winters are long and Fe-j

QUOTA OF LABOR
' PUT AT 525 MEN
(Continued from Page One)
present local need for skilled work
ers. "Whatever we do, the mines must
not suffer. It is my idea and I feel
confident it will be that of my associ
ates on the committee, that the mines,
as necessary war work, must come
first Labor must be withdrawn from
the county carefully and skilled men
be secured for mine work whenever
possible.
I do not know how great the labor
turnover in this district is. but it is
enormous at present, I feel certain. I
know that in my own experience as a
miner I sometimes change shifts or am
off i work for a few days. When I
return there are few men in the gang
whom I recognize. -
"1 want to urge every man in the
district to hold on to the job he has
at present. He should register with
the labor agents, but keep .working
! for all he is worth until he is called
j upon to do something else. It is the
I labor turnover that is making every
j sort of war work difficult and decreas
I ing production to a dangerous degree."
j Mayor Jacob Erickson has received
I telegrams and letters requesting that
he, as the executive head of Bisbee,
see that the city council acts upon lo
cal legislation, calculated to aid the
Bisbee Douglas community board in
its work fff registering the men. A
similar message has been received by
the Warren district commercial club,
calling upon its directors and mem
bers to co-operate with, the board.
The quota for Arizona is 2640 un
skilled laborers, some of whom are to
be keDt in Arizona for war work and
ithp reat tn he sent to other states
where there is a shortage of labor.
Agents for the employment service
and the United States public service
reserve in Arizona will have charge of
the recruiting.
The quota by counties is distributed
as follows:
Apache . ... 98
Cochise 525
Coconino 98
Gila 234
Graham 125
Greenlee - 1S4
Maricopa 455
Mohave 33
Navajo 136
Pima
Pinal 9S
Santa Cruz . . . .' S4
Yavapai . . .. 162
Yuma HO
The following district organizers
have charge of the recruiting in their
respective districts:
Jack Angus, Tucson, for Graham,
Cochise, Greenlee, Pima and Santa
Cruz counties.
John H. Croaff, Phoenix, for Gila,
Pinal, Maricopa and Yuma counties.
W. R. Ashurst in charge of Douglas
office at 444 Elevenlh street.
A. W. Sefton, Prescott. for Yavapai,
Mohave, Coconino, Navajo and Apache
counties.
It must be clearly understood that
there is nothing compulsory about reg
istering with the ' United Staes em
ployment service for war work. The
appeal to the men is made on patriot
ism. Even if they register they are
not compelled to accept the Job of
fered them or to leave the state if
they do not wish to.
The United States employment ser
vice is merely the common medium
through which the employer and the
worker, can get in touch with one an
other. It is an act of patriotism to
use the service and Uncle Sam. knows
that he need only put it on that basis
and the campaign will meet with the
hearty response of both the workers
and the employers.
PAVING FINISHED B!
TUESDAY. LOGKV
The paving which has been done on
the BHbee Lowell road from Lowell
to the Bisbee city limits is expected
to be finished by Tuesday, The work
wouid have been completed sooner had
it not been delayed by work which was
also being done by the county on the
n a.1s at the same time. Before the
paving could be commenced the car
tiacks had to be moved in order 10
widen the street about five feet. Side
walks also have been placed from, the
Custom House car stop, which marks
the city limits of ISisbte, down to Lo-
v. e'l. bv the countv.
The paving of the roads to warren
&nd Lowell has been going on for the
past six months. The work is under
,DP supervision "f F. S. Lockwood. On
the completion of this wor: Mr. Lock
wood will leave for Tucson with J. C.
McKIroy, promoter for th eWarren
Brothers company on the paving work.
When the work was first com-nHni-ed.
and sTter some days of full
oprratlon, rtipld progress was checked

County Board Will Not De
pend Upon Volunteer As
sistance for Clerical Work
on Great Day
"The registration Saturday did not!
produce many names and we did not
expect it to," said Ray B. Krebs. seer-?- j
tary of the county board just prior to
his departure for Tombstone after i
having completed the task of register- i
ing a dozen or so young men who had I
reached the age of 21 years since June '
5. "When we will have our big re?-1
istration, bigger than any election day
ever seen fn Cochise county, will be
on the day next month set by the fed-!
eral government for registration of I
men of from 18 to 4o years.
"Every detail of arrangement has
been completed for this registration
and we are ready to go to work anv
day the government may set.
"On account of the size of the jab.
as we recognize it before we begin it
the county board will not depend
upon volunteer assistance as we have
done heretofore. We shall draft a doz
en or so men for the purpose and in
stead of sending them into training
at once shall set them to work wih
pen and ink . and typewriter, to as
sist in taking the registration. In
this way we Bhall be able to complete
it in good form and and absolutely
on time, which would be an impos
sible task otherwise."
Based on life insurance statistics,
Mr. Krebs ejepects the registration in
this county to runbetween lO.O(K) and
11.000, probably around 10.500 men be
tween the ages of 18 and 4a years.
WITHOUT PAUSE
TOMMIES BATTLE ON
(Continued from Pace One)
makes it the chief point of attack in
this sector.
Further south the Germans are still
clinging to Miraumont. on the Ancre
in spite of the fact that the British
on both flanks of the place have swept
far to the eastward. Just belw Mirau
mont the situation is somewhat ob
scure, but it would seem probable that
the Germans have thrown enough men
into th battle to retard the British.
' Nearer the Somme, however, the
Germans have not been so successful.
It is reported that Bray has been cap
tured by the British, who are said to

There are few details of the pro
gress of the fighting south of the Som
nie. The capture of cannon is re
ported from this region, but there has
been no news of further progress
there by the British.
Along the Chaulnes-Roye sector of
the line, there is comparative quiet.
This region has not been mentioned
in recent advices. Although the French
are known to be close to Noyon, that
city is still held by the Germans. The
French hold ground along the south
ern bank of the Oise, and have been
reported to be across it at two points,
but they appear to have ceased their
attacks for the moment, seeming to be.
waiting for the outcome of the fight
ing in Picardy and Artois.
The left bank of the Ailette is also
held by the French. There have been
reports that they have crossed this
stream, but these have not been of
ficially confirmed. South of the Ail
ette, the French appear to be definite
ly held up on the hills north of.Sois-
sona. Their position there, however,!
would seem to rencer the German po
sitions near Soissons untenable.
Local fighting of some severity has
taken place along the Vesle river,
where Americans are holding the line.
Trench raids by the French in the
Lorraine sector are reported from the
French war office. This activity in
what has been for some time a quiet
sector may be the prelude to an at
tack against the Germans thert, but
there is nothing yet to substantiate
this suggestion.
Light sea forces have had a rather
slight encounter off Dunkirk, France.
Both the British and German official
reports state that losses were inflict

deny suffering any losses.

With Noyon in a deep- pocket and ex
posed to a terrible fire from three angles,
still the Germans hold the city. Their or
ders are to hold out at all costs. Well,
they are obeying orders all right, and the
cost is plenty high. It would seem, even
to the ordinary layman, that the longer
the Germans hold the, Noyon pocket, the
belter Foch would be pleased. His plan
is to kill German and not take ground.
Hence he would surely prefer that they
elect to stay and fight on this precarious
and dangerous and half shattered line than
to fall back to strongly prepared and nat
( urally impregnable positions on a shorter
front. t
German pride and superciliousness and
pig-headedness have cost them more than
all other misfortunes put together in thi3
war. The Prussian will seldom give up a
town or a redoubt or a farm or a hill until
every man in it is ground to powder. It is
true that occasionally the allies get them on
the run and they rush out of a village like
rabbits, but generally they stay and make a
stubborn fight and pay the extreme penally.
The war news today is most disappoint
ing to all of us who hoped to read this
morning of a broken German line and the
taking of Baupaume and Nojon and a gen
eral German withdrawal. This column free
ly admits that Friday night's news of the
great British push had led it to hope for the
rush, rout and ruin of the German lines
most of the way between Baupaume and
Soissons. But a littlci.thdwght and contem
plation of the battle area and the forces on
both sides should have made such fond
hope impossible. Only an accident of war
or a sudden break in German morale could
make that possible. The Germans still have
many fresh reserve divisions, and these have
been thrown into the furnace and have
doubtless stepped the allied drive for the
time.
Consider that just a little more than ji
month ago the Germans had the big bulge
on all this front and were preparing im
mense reserves to break the allied line and
rush through to Paris and. Calais. And
now we are steadily driving them back and
forcing them to use up all these reserve di
visions to hold their lines. And they are
playing right into Foch's hands, too. Only
a Prussian would elect to hold Noyon at
the present cost. Only a Prussian would
sacrifice thousands upon thousands of his
best men to hold Chaulnes and Bau
paume for another week or two from the
inevitable end that must result from the
overwhelming British pressure. The Ger
mans could have saved a quarter of a mil
lion men if they had swallowed their pride
and fallen back everywhere as soon as
Foch developed his great strength and re
sources July 1 8 on the Marne. And in the
end they must fall back, just the 3ame.
Outnumbered, outfought and outgeneraled,
they must give or break. The ceaseless
pressure and the unending, lightning at
tacks all the way along a hundred mile
front can have but one final end.
Just as we are beginning to feel disap
pointment at the failure to make a big for
ward push and rout the enemy; just as we
feel that we have been stopped a hairline
short of the fruits of victory, Foch strikes
again und a .fresh and greater peril arises
at once for the harassed German line and
the badly punished German armies. A
little more patience, brethren, and they will
crack.
in building improvements in this section
of Warren alone. These proposed houses
are to cost from $2500 to $3000 apiece.
Nearly a half million in ' new houses,,
all at one time, means a lot to a large city,
and what it will mean to Warren can hard
ly be estimated. It will bring an era of
prosperity and improvement to this district
unprecedented in all the west, when the
' size of the community and the brief space
of time are considered. It is now certain
that well over two hundred houses will be
built right away, even allowing for those
whose applications are rejected or who
fail to carry their' plans through. They
will be calling it "Wonder Warren" in an
other year. And it will justify the name.
As the district grows larger by leaps and
bounds it will naturally become richer and
a more attractive place in which to live.
There will be more amusements and beauty
spots and conveniences. Every class of
society will be enlarged and benefited.
And best of all, this company plan will en
able a larger propertion of the town's res
idents to own their own homes than in any
other city in the entire country, and it goes
without saying that the man who owns his
home is more interested in the community
welfare than one who does not, and he is
more apt to stay here and help build this
district into a metropolis of the southwest.
German claims of airplane losses in
flicted upon the allies have always been .
wild and ridiculous, but at no time more
so than their reports of the last two weeks.
Every day they claim to have brought
down from twenty to sixty allied planes at
practically no loss to themselves. In fact
they claim that their total losses for July
were only 1 29 planes. The facts are, they
lost 293 planes to the French alone that
month, and at least as many more to the
English by actual official tabulation.
French official figures show that since ;
January I the Germans have lest 1 504
planes, against the French and the latter
lost 352 machines in" that period. The ut
most strength of the German air forces on
the western front a week ago was about
2500 planes, of which 1 100 were fighting
machines and the others used for bombing,
observation, etc. From losses in battle, ac
cident, wear and tear the Germans must
replace about sixty machines a day to keep
up to the above number in operation.
This is a tremondous task, and that the
strain is beginning to tell is shown by pa
pers found on regimental commanders, in
which the German high command declares
that its air forces are sadly depleted - and
observation machines cannot be furnished
as wanted. Consider fora moment what
just one thousand American battle planes
would mean on the western front right
now. It would mean disaster for the Ger
mans this year. But alas, we have none at
at. Just a few observation and bombing
planes. But we will have that thousand
in the air above France before the year is
done.
The Warren district is most grateful to
Vance Johnson and John Rock of the board
of supervisors for the badly needed im
provement in the canyon in the Johnson
Addition and Lcwell. The widening of
the macadam paving here and the putting
in of a good cement sidewalk will" be of in
calculable benefit to all who pass up and
down this busy avenue of traffic. It is a
sad commentary upon Bisbee in particular
to say that the county has furnished more
and better streets between the city limits
and Warren than can be found in Bisbee.
The only stretch of paving in this city that
is fit for traffic is that, little bit lying be
tween the depot and slag dump hill, and
that .was only laid this summer, while the
county has furnished a nicely paved high
way all the way from Johnson Addition to
the carbarns in south Warren. The en
ergy and progress and practical business
sense of the honorable supervisors, the
Messrs. Johnson and Rock, cannot be too
highly commended by both charioteer and
footman who pass daily up and down the
canyon and witness the benefits and con
venience of the widened street and the new
sidewalk leading into that busy burg of Lowell.

One ran ud to Mrs. Lowe to shake her

about in this fashion:
When Red came into possession of
this big white bull pup. the kaiser was
not then attempting, to run kultur
down America s throat, so Ked named
his dog "Heinle." And Heinies was
pretty near the whole thing in the
Red Ganuon domicile. His dogship's
sway there was undisputed utitil one
day Red s wife came into possession of
the cutest, roundest blackest little
eld ciiry pup that ever won an entire
housi hold's heart. And they named the
pup "Black Jack" Pershing and made
much over him from morning to night.
And Heinie. when he saw that pup

his name called constantly and loving

the first day and return no more. It
was the second retreat from the third
battle of the Marne. Pershing hoi is

from the dog with the Hunnish name.

fully, "and it's kind-a sad. too." for

ment. AMERICAN PORT. WESTERN
FRANCE. July 30 (Correspondence of
the Associated Press). Long lines of
khaki claJ men just debarked from
American transports and now on the
way to their first camp, parked the
streets from curb to curb and stretch
ed away for miles. It was four miles
and up hill most of the way through
city, Buburbs and country lanes, from
the sea-front to the great reception
camp located outside the town, one
of the largest camps in the world and
capable of caring for the population of
a metropolitan city. Hour after hour
from 6 this mornfng until late this
afternoon the steady tramp of march
ing thousands had been going on, for
this steady stream is the army of
36.000 just arrived on thirteen Amer
ican transports, making the record de
barkment from ship to camp within
twelve hours.
With Major X, the engineer officer
of the camp, we skirted along this
moving stream, from the landing ot the
camp, and had an opportunity of see
ing each stage in the huge movement
tip to the time the tired marchers
pitched their shelter tents on the
soaked grounds and crawled Inside to
sleep. Stirring as It was to see these
men come to swell the million men
In the American ranks, yet there was
a grimness and grayness to the scene
suggesting the stern reality of war.
A steady downpour swept across the
ranks and the men were dripping a
they trudged through the ra!nsoaked
mud. They were at route step, without
the regularity of parading troops, and
each man carried, besides his rifle all
his belongings on his back, 70 pounds
of tent, blanket, clothing, shoes, and
all the miscellaneous equipments in
the United States, where they slept on
cots and had a semblance of modern
comfort Now they were on the war
swept soil of France and had seen the
last of cots and comforts. It was
their first glimpse of real war con

states army a short time ago." And
with such an influx we have to provide
a very elastic camp, capable of Im
mediate expansion from a thousand up
to a hundred thousand men."
The major -was well qualified to ex
plain the magnitude of the work, for
he had been chief constructing engi
ieed of the New York subway system,
had planned and built a good part of
the system, and had made the popula
tion figures on which subway con
struction was based.
'To get an idea of the camp," he
said, "compare it with Central Park.
We have 2500 acres here. Central Park
has SOO acres. Why. the entire area
of New York City on Manhattan Is
land is only 41,000 acres."
On both sides of the road, for milss
we sped along in an army car, a city
of tents was rising and there was tho
hum and bustle of camp activity on
a vast scale. This morning all the
eround had been stubble-field from
the newly cut wheat and barley. But
now every available foots was being
: laid olf Dy army engineers, woming
with tripods and instruments like a
party of surveyors. Tented streets and
I avenues, headquarters tents, mess,
j kitchen and hospital tents, and vast
parks for supplies and artillery and
I horses, were rising in the fields and
j spreading for forty square miles over
this huge enclosure.
! "We never take a field of growing
! trrain " nalil lha mnior "hut nil fast as
the grain is cut we take over the
fields, and with harvest time well ad
vanced this entire farming section will
soon be turned into an American
, camp."
In nna of the fehla where we StOD-
! ped to see the men. two battalions of
800 men each, just marched in and
were preparing to pitch their tents.
The great stretch of ploughed ground,
just cleared the grain, was rain soak
ed, and the storm had set In for the
night. The men stood ready, each with
a half of a shelter tent, to drive the
stakes and lash It against elements,
and then crawled In. It seemed an
endless wait for all the formalities
of laying out the camp with engineer
ing exactness, yet all of this was es
sential to the smooth running of such
a large concern.
At last the stakes were driven and
soon the great field was dotted with
thousands of little khaki mounds,
about as high as a man's waist, called
"puo tents" by the soldiers, probably
because they look like dog houses.
Under the tent there is just room for
two lying down, and If the ground is
soaked as it is tonight, the rubber
pannrho keeps out some of the water
and kindly nature and Iron youth must
do the rest.
This was only one typical camp of
hundreds lining the roads for miles in

kitchens and water carts were wheel
ing up to all the camps as the tents
went up. Filtered water is brought in
hogsheads and each (0111111.111 has its
appointed lot of hogsheads. Later on
there will be a splendid system of wa
ter mains for the whole camp. Hut
here are the men, and a water system
is not installed in a day. So instead
of waiting fcr 12-inc!i mains, the
primitive hogshead is filling the gap.
Each man carries his emergency ra
tion for three days. Some of ihem
were nibbling it before climbing into
their pup. tents, but most of them
waited for the smoking field kitchen
to get into action witfi its cocks, serv
ing out hot coffee and hot soup and
meat. The item of feeding an army
with precision is in Lself a gigantic
task.
"We served 1,800,000 mea!3 last
month," said Major X, "or 600.000
army rations of t'aree meals to the ra
tion." And besides all the feeding and
watering and sanitation, there is the
immense "paper work" of such an or
ganization. There are 123 separate
organizations in the 3C.0OO men just
rived. Each of them 128 must be
sorted out and brought together, and
every individual soldier of the ' 36,
must be identified and accounted for,
so as to guard against losses, and
then each organization and man must
have his detail to one of the escorts
of the fighting front. This "paper
work," as it is called, is prodigious,
and like everything military it .must
be done with absolute precision. And
the paper work calls for paper, which
is very hard to get.
"When headquarters called for a
map of the camp the other day," said
the major, "they got it all right, on the
the only paper which could be found,
which was brown wrapping paper,
but it was a good map, and the wrap
ping paper map of the big American
camp will go into the archives."
When taps sounded tonight every
man of this 36,000 was under canvas,
although this morning every man had
been afloat. It was the record ac
complishment In landing, for while
one body of arrivals had been large.
42.000. the landing had taken the
best part of two days, whereas this
tugs transfer was in the daylight

AMERICAN TROOPS IN
TOUL SECTOR IN
ONEHGHT
THOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN SEV
ERAL OTHER ENGAGEMENTS
YANKS HOLD THAT XIVRAY
BATTLE WAS ONLY REAL ONE
THEY HAVE BEEN IN AS YET
(V.v Review I.ens'il Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN TROOPS
IX FRANCE, June 2a. (Correspond
ence of The Associated Press.)
Though the American troops have had
three engagements in the Toul sector
during the past three months men in
the division say "there bus been just
one fight." I '
The big raid on Apromont in April
they call "the Apremont affair;" they
refer to the attiick on Seicheprey, ten
days later as "the Seicheprey thing;"
hut, the morning of June 16 at Xiv
ray," they say, "there was a fight."
This distinction doe.? no wrong to
the defenders of Apremout and Sei
cheprey. The men did their best there,
and that best was as good as could
be expected under the circumstances,
but their best then was not so good as
their best at Xivray. That is the sig
nificance given to the distinction by
French officers. They say that it was
at Xivray the men holding the sector
showed they had learned how to do
what must be done in the front line.
Xivray has a similar meaning to the
Germans in that sector if the evidence
of prisoners may be trusted. The men
captured there show Increased respen.
for the fighting qualities of the Amer
icans and betray a deeper awe of the
American machine gun.
It is now disparagement of the work
the ordinary rifle did there to say
that the quick-firers decided the issue.
Two companies of infantry, without
dugouts to shelter them held their
grounds on the right of the position
through a heavy artillery preparation
and kept the enemy from bringing up
reinforcements throughout the fight.
Meanwhile, in the center at Xivray
and on the left, the machine gun
ners did the rest.
The enemy's plan according' to pris
oners, was to force the village, destroy
the defence works, make the place un
tenable and take prisoners. The effort
was well organized and might have
succeeded but for the work of the
quick-firers.
Six hundred men advanced to the
attack In no less than a dozen dif
ferent columns, led by 200 picked Ba
varian storming troops. They came
up on the right flank, on the left and
on the center under cover of smoke,
making a dark night still darker. They
crept up the ravines and slipped
through the hollows. The sharp ears
of sentries alone prevented a total
surprise.
Their guns laid down a lfeavy box
barrage that prevented the reinforc
ing of the front line. One platoon, led
by Lieutenant Doan. from Maine, got
through the first curtain of fire. Doan
even went through the second with
some volunteers, but that was all the
help that could be sent to the 223
men that were holding the line attack
ed. They were only one to three but
they fought in a way to surprise and
dismay the 600 Germans, i
One machine gun section in the vil
lage was reduced to two men. Monfort
Wyckoff and John Flynn. Their gun
Jammed and Flynn kept the Germans
off with his revolver while Wyckoff
got the quick-firer going again. They
held, their ground to the end. Two
other men, unable to get a sight at
the Germans from their trench climb
ed the parapet and stood there erect
firing their automatics from the
shoulder. Two Infantrymen crawled
out of a shell hole to get a better aim.
The Germans had lost a third of
their 600 men when growing daylight
impaired the effectiveness of their
smoke screen and they began to re
tire. The fifty odd unwounded Amer
icans left out of 225 went over the
top after them.
Two hundred Is a conservative esti
mate of the German losses for our
men buried forty-seven of them on the
field and there were more corpses in
the tall grass facing the position, out
of reach. Thus the Germans lost
nearly as many me as they had fac
ing them during the fight.
One of the .heroes of the dav was
a cook who had been dismissed from
the service on account of loose habit
with respect to drink. When sober
he was possessed of an astonishing
amount of perseverance. He had foiled
all efforts of the officers to put him
out of the division. He left one egi
ment to appear in another. He passed
from one company to another until he
had reached the last one. If he was
thrown out of that It was all over with
his soldiering. He was one of the
volunteers that went through both bar
rages and he stayed through the fleht
giving first aid to the wounded under
the sharpest fire from the assailants.

AT THE EAGLE TOQAY
Miss Theda Bara shows her re
markable versatility and portrayal
of character in the newest William
Fox Theda Bara Super Production
"The Forbidden Path," in which the
famous screen star runs the gamut of
all human experiences. From a guile
less, innocent girl she is dragged
down to the depths, becoming an
habitue of a low drinking dive and
then again the revengeful woman.
In her impersonation of the woman
who has fallen by the wayside Msf
Bara dressed and acted the portrayal
so naturally that many of her friends
who had come over to the vVilliain
Fox studios to see her at work were
unable to pick her from the various
other" types that were scattered in
the scene. .

At Ft. Huachuca
Captain Harry C. Wheeler of the
United States army passed throi'sh
Osborn yesterday morning on his wa
to Fort Huachuca where he was or
dered by General Cabell in Douglaa.
He will be attached to the 10th cav
alry, until a little later when he ex
pects to return to the front line n
France. Captain Wheeler had started
en his way to Washington and was
stopped by orders to report to the
commanding officer at Douglas. He
was in hopes that he could return to
Washington as ho wished to show to
the ordnance bureau; of the govern
ment there the rifle that he had made
for his personal use. He has been
woiking on the rL'lc for the past five
years and he now has brought it to
a slate of perfection where It can be
u.sfd. It might be termed a cross be
tween a Winchester and Springfield,
having the barrel of the former and
part of the stock of the latter. The
lever Is that of the Springfield. It
has a telescopic sight, about a foot
in length, anj the captain says it Is
Ideal for sharpshooting. He tried it
out at Tombstone the other day, he

(yards, he said, fqnal accuracy was ob

said, hut ne naims nutning in me
way of i'uention in regard to it, as
most of the parts embodied In its
make-up came from other gun!".
Today from 9 a. ni. to 5 p. m. is '-he
fast opportunity to see Mr. Yoakum
and iniiKe arrangements to secure the
necessary loans for building in the
new addition to Warren and be assur
ed that your name will be on the first
list lor a home for immediate erec
tion. Cp to Friday night about ISO appli
cations had been received and it is an
.icipated that the end of the week
rush will bring the number up to
about 250. Mr. Yoakum stated that
a great number had given their names
to him as desiring to get Into this
plan but that very few had left their
addressis and that it was impossible
for him to communicate with them.
Mr. Yoakum wanted to have it clear
iy understood by the people of rh')
community that merely giving their
nanios to him is not HUfficient, but
lha they must make a signed appli
cation for the loan.
People have generally expressed
themselves as being very much pleased
with the house designs which Mr
Hclden, the architect, is showing at
Mr. Yoakum's office and there will be
no trouble getting a house nlready de
signed to suit almost any needs both
as to Inside layout and exterior 1m
ish.
Relative to the plan one miner ex
press himself a few days ago:
"The companies have given out this
loan plan so that they can get good
homes for good miners and keep them
so contented that they will want to
stick. Well, I am a good miner and
I want to stick, so here goes my ap
plication." Another man stated that
no matter where the wage level might
In and what the after the war con
ditions were, he was convinced that
Bisbee would always be at least one
jump ahead of any olhn- camp and
that he had decided to cast his lot
with Itisbee.
It is anticipated that the new C. and
C. shaft above Warren will develop
sufficient water for the concentrator
and also enough to provide Warren
with cheap irrigating water and with
this addition and the large yard spaces
provided'. Warren should within a few
years be a vrritable garden spot.

UNION GOES UPON
RECORD AGAINST ANY
Farnum Thrills
In Big Picture
The William Fox 191S version of
"The Plunderer." which will be shown
at the Central theater today is crown
ed with thrills. In the very beginning
cf the screen story William Far
num, who is the star of the pic
ture, is made prisoner in a mine
when his enemies roll a giant stone
down the mountainside and into the
mouth of the mine. His struggle to
get out and to save his companion
keeps the viewer pit edge all the time.
Then there Is the strike of the miners
working for Farnum, which is follow
ed by the blowing up of the reservoir
that gives power (or the working oi
the mine. Other thrills are worked in
and finally the big one the bare
handed fight between Farnum and
about twenty husky miners. If Shakes
peare were alive today, he, too, would
call it "Some Scrap."
Two love affairs run through the
picture and come but to happy endings.

WILBERT TELLS OF ONE OF THE
FIRST PHASES OF ACTIVITY OF
MINE, MILL AND SMELTER
WORKERS IN THEIR RECENT
DENVER CONVENTION
'.llMl
wimi
The" International Union of Mine,
Mill &. Smelter workers, in its con
tention iu Denver, Colo., took one of
its first actions to eliminate any traces
of I. W. W. among its membership and
tp prevent anyone of "wobbly" ten
dencies getting in its ranks hereafter,
accotding to R. J. Wilbert of this city,
who was one of the delegates.
A resolution was adopted by unani
mous vote 'orever debarring from the
union any. known I. W. W." said Mr.
Wilbert. "It went further, providing
for the expulsion of any member who
hereafter should be proven to be af
filiated with the I. W. W."
Mr. Wilbert said that the general
tone of the convention had been en
thiisiastically in support of the govern
ment and aid of every sort had been
i'Udgtd toward winning the war. As
an example of the attitude of the union
he cited a meeting during the conven
tion o' the representatives of mine
owners and the union, who because of
past differences were personally mi
mical to one another, but for once
worked hand in hand to boist mine
production and beat the Hun.
FLORAL PIECE FOR

NOTHING LIKE CONFIDENCE IN
POLITICS OR A HORSE RACE
AND BOTH TOM HUGHES AND
DAVE O'NEIL HAVE PLENTY OF
IT IN STATE SENATE CAMPAIGN
Thcmas A. Hughes of P.isbee, who
a candidate for another term as
state senator, has confidence, worlds
f it, in his campaigning ability, and
from what we know of him ,it is justi-
fier.
Tne other day Mr. Hughes was stand
ng in ffcint of the Bank of Bisbee
building in which is the suite of of
fices used by hl.s insurance business.
The conversation turned to politics.
A man passed down the street car
rying a floral emblem evidently pro
pared for a funeral.
"Whose political grave is that for.
ri,:u?" asked one of the myi, deter
mined to have a little fun at the ex
pense of the candidate.
"My opponent," answered Hughes'
never cracking a smile, as he turned
and entered the building.
I). C. O'Neil of Douglas, also was a
visitor In Bisbee during the week . He
spent u few hours here minding po
litical fences and said when inter
viewed that h0 considered the outlook
fur his success particularly good.

MLS FOR PURPOSE
HANDICAPS ARE NOT LACKING, CHIEF AMONG THEM BEING LACK
OF SKILLED LABOR WHICH RETARDS DEVELOPMENT WORK;
THIS IS NOT BEING ENTIRELY OVERLOOKED, HOWEVER, AND
THERE ARE MANY INSTANCES WHERE SMALL FORCES HAVE
BROUGHT BIG ORE BODIES TO LIGHT AND EXERCISED MUCH
INGENUITY TO FURTHER THEIR EFFORTS
Although handicaps are not lacking, Arizona mines are maintaining
their vigorous prosecution of metal production and development work. The
latter is necessarily receiving less than normal endeavor, because the larg
er forces are required on production. The latter must be kept coming. But
development is in no instance being overlooked and there are notable instan
ces wherein the smaller forces'have exercised under ingenuity which has in"
material part made up for some of the shortage in forces. This is not pos
sible in all cases but it is being achieved where it is possible, just as in the
ore reduction divisions of mill and smelter, less ore is being made to pro
duce more metal than ingenuity had figured cut to be possible a year or tv.u
ago. The war need of copper is the stimulant and is proving effective.
The Warren district leads in point of new development, with the I)im
close upon the probably entry into ore oil its 1B0O which will make it one of
the great copper mines of the country. Calumet & Arizona is continuing its
exploration of the Junction area lying next the Denn with attendance of
outlook that is very encouraging indeed. Copper Q;:een with its ;:g Sacra
mento hill operations is making steadily improving headway with that gigan
tic piece of work, which is destined to much lift the copper production of the
district.
In the Globe district the Iron Cap, Arizona Commercial. Old Dominion
and others are continuing the splendid gain in rich ores at depth which
they started in upon it earnest last year. They are working a great change
in the ore resources situation and possibilities of that district.
In the Verde district the Gadsden Is now down to its 1200 level and get
ting below with the necessary sump preliminary to cutting station and start
ing in on the cutting up of the country at depth program which is to mean
so much to the district one way or. the other. Verde Combination, adjoin
ing is also in the game and at depth is finding things in its driving around
that are very encouraging both for its ground and as pointing the way for
results in Gadsden. Jerome Verde is further along with permanent work
In the right direction than at any previous time and is considered to be
looking exceedingly well. These thre properties have the center of the
Jerome stage at this time and from either of them important news may com
before the end of the year.
Among the large producers in the various district? or the state, there is
no let up from the fine stride that was maintained during last month and
the outlook Is that they will equal Its splendid record of production.

Greene Cananea reports copper out

the company has produced 24.050.0O0

GROWING HEAVIER
JUNE QUARTERLY EARNINGS
MORE THAN DOUBLE THOSE
REPORTED LAST MARCH AND
DIRECTORS f POSSIBLY WILL
INCREASE DIVIDEND RATE
Ray's report for the second quarter
showed earnings available for divi
dends of $2,253,217, or more than
double those of the previous quarter.
By reducing the dividend from J4.00 to
a $3.00 rate the surplus after dividends
amounted to fl.072.333 as compared
with a deficit of $471,316 in the first
quarter.
these earnings would seem to indi
cate that the great bulk of coppr car
ried over from the first quarter at
i"V,c a pound had been sold at 23 Vic.
With a stated cost of 16.47c a pound
and production of 21,963,414 pounds, it
I is estimated that profits from copper
produced during the quarter amount
ed to $1,537,439. Thus the company
apparently realized profits of $717,778
from sales of copper produced in the
previous quarter. This, if added to
(the earnings of that quarter, would
I have been more than sufficient for
the payment of tha regular $1.00 di". i
dend. Kr.y's earnings for the'first half of
191S are very encouraging. Net prof
its amounted to $3,361.0SO or $2.10 a
share. Dividends of $2,760,603. or $1.75
a share were paid, leaving a balance of
$601,017. Assuming production of only
21.000.0u0 pounds of copper in the next
quarter at a cost of ISc a pound with
the present government price of 2?c a
; pound maintained earnings would
i amount to Sl.fiNO.OOO. or $1.06 a share.
These are considered conservative fig
ures and will probably be exceeded. It
therefore seems not improbable that
the directors will next month author
ize payment of the old dividend at
the rate of $4 a year.

Help
to Small
of Gold
The following letter has been written on the go'.d mining' situation by
J. A. Hurgess, general superintendent of the United Easteiw, Arizona's
largest individual producer of gold:
Vow that t&e War Industries board has announced it 3 decision to place
geld mining on the essential list, aa; important stop has ben taken to
ward the relief of the industry, and it remains to secure the financial 'as
sistance that will be necessary to taase-the resumption o work xfft low
grade mines that have been forced to s Jspend operations on account of hi.jh
operating costs, and to simulate production from all mines.
Mr. McAdoo has slated that at notime has this country so much re
quired the "largest production of yo d as at present , and thp.t the rmson for
this requirement is to sustain the credit of the government. In other words
he stated that the demand for gold is greater than ever btfore, and that it
is meded in the financial operations of the country. Its value to the gov
ernment with respect to credit has increased, hut its price lias remained
stationary. Its value to the government is greater than its price of $20. C7
ptr otin-e, in that it has the additional value, greater now than ever be
fore, tiiat an o'mce o' gold in the l, S. treasury will smtain the govern
ment's credit for more than $20.67. It is this additional value that will justi
!y the government in paying a bounty for the productian of gold.
There are two conceivable ways in
which the government an stimulate
the production of geld: It can go into
the business of prospecting and min
ing and produce the gold itself. The
success of this method would be very
doubtful, and it can be predicted with
certainty that gold produced in tiiis
way would cost the government more
thhn $20.67 per ounce. The alternat
ive is to pay miners $20.67 per ounce
for gold produced, and in addition to
this allow a specified amount toward
the expense o producing it. This
wou'd be a bounty for the finding and
winning of gold, and not an increase
in its price, and such a bounty should
be restricted to gold produced current
ly from mines in the United States. In
my rninion, the payment of a bounty
would be far more effective than the
mining of gold directly by the govern
ment. 71i'. suggestion that certain privi
leges, suvli as exc nption lrom tuxes,
be granted gold mints in place of a
bounty, has the defect that it would
not help the small producer or thj
one that produces gold at a small mar
gin c" profit, in the same proportion
that it would help the larger, mere
successful, producer; whereas, as far
as the government is concerned, gold
won at 110 profit to the producer is
fully as useful to the treasury as gold
produced at a big prolit. If a bounty
is placed on gold, m'lvh of the incre'is,
in production would probably be made
by small producers and prospectors
from snwll or low-grade veins, and
placers, that cannot be profitably
worked under present conditions. The
exemption from taxes would be of very
little help in stimulr.iing production
from this class c c.eposits. l!y plac
ing a bounty on the production of gold,
the additional cost to the government
wou'd be in proportion to the results
obtained, and would be divided anions
producers in a like ratio.
There are precedents for the pay
ment of n bo-ruty or bonus of this na
ture. The bounty on eovote scalps
conies most readily to mind. The kill
ing of predatory animals is beneficUil
to the state, and the skins sell at a
good price, but In addition to this,
several states pay bounties In order
to accelciate tl cir extermination. The
subsidizing of shipping, and of the ex
pcrtn'ion of manufactured articles, as
applied in some countries, are tn
Oar.'cs of somewhat similar practice.
Kven the payment of interest is !n
come degree of this iiatur". for. where
.h"re wo pay money for the use of
borrowed money In order to facilitate
cur financial transactions, the gov-rn-m:nt
would be paying money to -;ot
the use of gold to fac ilitate its finan
cial transactions. In paying a boun'y
for the production of gold, the govern
ment would simnlv be subsidizing tne
geld industry in order to keen it alive,
and to maintain the production of an
fs.-epitial contmodit v.
Whatever "dp is tlven to gold min
ing at this time must he in the natui"

Inspiration production in July of 9,
OoO.Ol'O pounds of copper was the low
est shown since last March, the first
month that output got back close to
normal since the disastrous strike
which started approximately a year
ago among the mining companies. This
total was a less of 1..HM noo pounds
from that of the preceding month, a
somewhat sharp decrease. Whether
Inspiration will be able to maintain 'ts
present rate depends largely upon Its
ability to get sufficient miners which
at present is none too bright.
Vp to the end of July Inspiration
had produced 5::. 750. 000 pound:;, a drop
of y.S.'O.odo from that of the corres
ponding peiiod last year when no out
put was recorded for July. Should the
present rate be maintained for the rest
of the calendar year. Inspiration
should show a total slightly above
loo OoO.OOO po'.mds. This compares
with approximately S,600,0c0 in 1917,
and 102. Soil. 000 in tmrt.
last year Inspiration's costs were
10.44 cents per pound against S.i"7
cents in the pre ions year. With 20,
000.000 pounds more than last year
forecasted. It Is obvious that costs
should be materially reduced. It. wo ihl
not be surprising if final results show
ed copper costs close to that of ll'lti.
Last year Inspiration showed share
profits of "S with the result that
rumors were current that the dividend
rate of $S was in danger of being re
duced. Fased on the present showing
there is litt'e fear of any such action.
As a mi'tter of tact, earnings for the
outstanding stock should be far in ex

not wholly by the miners themselves
as the result of differences In dim ne,

siar.ces. It Is not that the Ctah oper

In the bending to work in the min

tention that Is being paid to politics
than has prevailed in previous cam
paign years. Candidates, policies and
measures are receiving comparatively
little attention, a fact that has been
the cause of considerable speculation
among politicians. The men in the
mines evidently have their minds
made up as to the primary contests
and are concerning themselves no
further. With reference to the meas
ures appearing on the ballot, the over
whelming expressions for place for the
amendment providing compensation
for injured workmen and for the re
storation of capital punishment appear
to indicate cleacly the decisions
which have been reached in regard to
these. The compensation measure,
because of Its close relation to the
every day work life of the men in the
mines, has come in for larger discus
sion than any other feature in the cam
paign, even to the gubernatorial candi
dates. It has a great hotly of sup
port behind it among the workers and
few opponents except those outside

decisive factor among workers.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, AUGUST 25, 1918.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Auk. 24 Buying lor
both access, including extensive cover
ing or short contracts, was witnessed
in today's broad and active stock mark
et, some leaders registering maximum
quotations of the year.
The remarkable change of sentiment
was caused by overnight developments,
such as the further sweep of the al
lied forces in the western war arena
and signs of easier money.
Foremost features of the two hour
session, in which the turnover was
325.000 shares, were Canadian Taci
fic, which made an extreme gain of
8 pcinis. rtUining all by the small
est fraction, and United States Steel's
gain of 2i points to its top
price of the year.
Numerous other rails, industrials,
equipments and sundry specialties
were iifted 1 to 2 point8. the raise be
ing gradual and sustained throughout.
Few isolated losses were trivial. Fi
nal prices showed no impairment.
liouds moved upward, though mod
erately, foreign issues participating,
tspecially the French group and Unit
ed Kingdom 5's which again touched
par. Total sales of bonds, par value,
aggregated $5,575,000.
A gain of almost $30,000,000 in ac
tual excess reserves was the most
noticeable feature of the weekly bank
statement, loans showing another
marked contraction.
WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 24. Conflicting
momentary conditions without prece
dent in the histroy of American fi
nance, caused a further halt in the
activities of the stock market this
week, although the undertone was
strong in tfe? main, becoming almost
buoyant at Jihe final session. Credit
restrictions -were ' counterbalanced to
a decree, however, by the steady ac
cumulation of Liberty bonds, especially
the tax exempt 3's at the new rec
ord of $102.50. .
There was a noteworthy increase of
dealings in the foreign war flotations,
the inquiry extending to Russian tiv
ternal bonds. Absorption of these is
sues were accompanied by a greater
strength in exchange of London and
Paris, francs making their highest
quotation of the year.
An important step toward the re
storation of more normal money rates
was taken by J. P. Morgan & Co., who
announced their intention to make
daily advances on eligible acceptances
at rates based on the discount quota
tion of the federal reserve bank.
Market leaders were at their best
prices of the year at the week end,
Canadian Pacific's further substantial
gain causing another precipitate driv
ing in of the short interest, while
United States Steel s rise to 1144 also
effected some disorder among the
bears.
CLEARING HOUSE REPORT
NEW YORK. Aug. 24. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week shows
that they hold $59,355,230 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
an increase of $29,2SL450 from last
week.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, At'g. 24. Just how thor
oughiy, not to say excessively, traders
had discounted crop damages was
made fully apparent today. With the
damage fully understood liquidation
continued and the market closed with
October options showing a net loss
of 3c. Increasing receipts were also
a factor, although they came as no
surprise. October closed at Jl.61',4.
The oats market, opening firm, was
unable to resist the influence of the
corn weakness and declined N"?4c
with the- tone easy at the close, de
spite buying by cash houses.
The slump in hogs having been
checked today, provisions also firmed
up and closed slightly higher for the
most part. October pork alone dor
clincd, closing 10c off.
NEW YORK COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, Aug. 24 Cotton closed
at the lowest level of the day, with thr,
tone e?ey at a net decline of $1.50 ti
$1.75 pcint .

GOLD EXPORTED TO MEXICO
WASHINGTON. Aug. 24. The fed
eral reserve board, according to a
statement issued during the month
ended July 20. issued licenses permit
ting the export of $3,696,389 of gold,
the bulk of which was sent to Mex
ico. Imports amounted to $14,631,000,
mainly coming from Canada and Mex
ico. These imports represent with
drawals of gold held by the Federal
reserve banks with their foreign
agencies and such holdings show a ie
jucticn since the beginning of June
frcm $52,500,000 to about $15,500,000
on Ju'y 12. The gain in the stock of
gcJd in the United States since Aug.
1. 1914. has hern $1,078,383,000.
From J'Jly 10 to July 15, It is report
od, the net inward movement of gold
was J12.2S1.000. compared to $18,410,
000 for the preceding four weeks.
The board reports that a financial
commission has been sent abroad to
study exchanges and as a direct re
sult of wcrk in developing a system of
control of Italian exchange lire quo
tations are decidedly improved.
The board again urges, all banks to
surrender gold coin and gold certifi
cates and to abstain from hoarding.
It is the desire o" the board to have

A Sombre
Anniversary
Four Yeas Ago the Germans
Inaugurated the Practice of
Bombing Defenseless Cities
From the Air Antwerp the
First Victim.
LONDON, Aug. 24. Four years ago
tomorrow, August 25, 1914, the Ger
mans began their campaign of fright
fulness in the air, the killing of
non-combatants by dropping bombs
from airships.
The first German air murder of
civilians took place at Antwerp. It
sent a shudder of horror through the
whole world, but since then the world
lias traveled far on the path of hor
ror. The battle of Mons had opened and
the French and Pritish forces were
falling back rapidly under the over
helming pressure of the German
armies. There was only one cause
for dissatisfaction at German head
quarters the delay which the little
Belgian army had Imposed during the
passage through Belgium, and the
stubborn refusal of the Belgian king
to surrender, although bis capital had
fallen and bis army had been driven
back into Antwerp.
It was under these circumstances
that the order was given to make the
first trial of Germany's great air
weapon. A Zeppelin was sent to
make a midnight raid cn the city of
Antwerp. The commander had spec
ial instructions to try for the royal
palace, for King Albert was felt to be
the soul of his people's resistance.
Antwerp was a fortified city in the
technical sense of the term, but the
ring of forts was located far from the
parts Inhabited by the civilian popu
lation, and the main forts were at an
average distance of ten miles from
the center.
But the Zeppelin did not attack the
forts. With its engines stopped, it
drifted over the city and discharged
six bombs, all of which fell near the
palace.
An American army officer who was
in Antwerp at the time wrote the fol
lowing account of the incident:
"No bomb actually struck the pal
ace, but one narrowly missed the ca
thedral. Three found human victims.
One killed four women and two po
licemen. A second killed one man
and wounded two others. Another
fell in the courtyard of the hospital
of St. Elizabeth, smashed all the win
dows, but wounded no one, althougn
the crucifix hanging over the bed of
a sick child was smashed to pieces
by a fragment of shrapnel. In all, ten
people were killed and eight wound

ARCHANGEL, WHITE
ARCTIC, A
Archangel, the "White City" of
northern Russia, is once more a cen
ter of Interest. Just what has happen
ed there, or what is going to happen.
perhaps no one outside of Archangel
knows with any measure of definite-
ness. But there are rumors. Arch
angel is a breeding place of myster
ious rumors. It was to Archangel that
Lord Kitchener was going on an em
bassy of mystery when he went down
to his death off the Orkney Heads. It
was from Archangel that that ghostly
army of "100,000 Russians" was sup
posed to have embarked upon that
mythical expedition through Kngland
and across the channel to the front
in France in the early days of the war.
And now the three or four line dis
patches that are allowed to filtor
through the censorial news em.'iaiKu
which has been on at Archangel for
some time past announce a widespread
insurrection against the lolsheviki
government in northern Russia, with
its headquarters in Archangel, the
withdrawal of the soviet troops
and a conference between American
Ambassador Francis and allied repre
sentatives to be held at Archangel,
at which it is said the "ambassadors
will decide upon their future plans."
Perhaps, after all. Archangel may
evolve from a center of mystry into a
enter of action and the long promised
great movement of Russian regenera
tion may find its genesis there.
The Largest Arctic City
Archangel was the seat of govern
ment of northern Russia of the old
regime. It is on the right bank of the
Dvina river, twenty-six miles above its
entrance into the White sea and is. 740
miles northeast of Pct-ograd It is the
largest and most Important city in the
world situated so close to the Arctic
Circle. It is a very ancient se:prt.
and for a long time was the only sea
port that Russia had. The nmilcru
town, however, dates from the v'sit of
an Knglish voyager, Richard Chancel
lor, in l.rr3. An Knglish factory was
erected on the lower Dvina soon after
that date, and in 15S4 a fort was built,
around which the modern town grew
up. Peter the Great once lived at
Archangel, while he was learning ship
carpentry, and he laid the foundation
for ore of its greatest industries, the
building of ships The little log house
that he liveJ in is, still one of the shov
places of the towa

any expenditure in a search for stron
tianite in Arizona. The supply of this
ore appears to be adequate Tor our
needs, and the necessity for simulation
of production is not apparent."
Talc "The deposits of ordinary talc
in the eastern states are sufficiently
large to meet all requirements. Thore,
is, however, a shortage of the hili
grade talc used for' talcum powder
and toliet preparations. The supply
comes largely from Italy, and inas
much as we have not been able to find
deposits of equal quality, it lias beesi
necessary to continue the importation
of Italian talc."
Barite "It is my opinion that, in
view of the present barite situation,
with reasonable supplies of good grade
material available in the eastern
states, including Missouri, material
found in Arizona, especially if removed
from lines of transporattion, woulo lie
of little or no value. The plants using
barite are located, almost without ex
ception in the east. There is. I fce
lleve, one in operation in Denver. Colo.
At the present time barite is sold only
on the basis of 95 per cent BaSa4 by
analysis, and should preferably run
higher. For certain purposes, the 5
per cent or less of impurities should be
made up of some material other than
quartz. A soft barite similar to that
mined In Missouri is more desirable
that the hard crystaline form of the
mineral. The first grade white bar
lte is selling at present at around $6.50
per ton.
Chromile "The value of any chro
mite deposits lies In its richness. In
other words, a high grade chromite de
posit in Arizona, if large enough, could
compete favorably with any of the de
posits in the eastern states, the two
great factors to be considered being
transportation and grade of the niin
eral."
The Arizona Bureau of Mine, in
Tucson, will gladly examine specimens
of chromite which may be submitted
to them, and will advise possible pro
ducers whether their material is prob
ably of commercial grade.
JAPAN REVISING HER
LAWS UPON RELIGION
(By Review Leased Wire)
TOKIO. June 23. The government
Is undertaking the work of revising
the Japanese law for religious admin
istration. According to R. Okada. minister of
education, the codes now actually in
force were . promulgated by the Jap
anese government over thirty years
ago. He said:
"I think tue time has at least come
for revising the law, as the religious
situation of tho country is becoming
more and more deplorable on account'
of the influence of many dangeroin
thoughts which have recently been
imported from foreign countries."
Mr. Okada declared that the new
bill probably will be presented by tne
government to the next imperial diet,
which will "bo convened at the end of
the year.
CITY OF THE
PORT OF MYSTERY
I Archangel, and in fact all of northern
Russia, was beginning to experience
I an awakening of commercial develop
j ment. More than 80O vessels put in
I yearly at this Russian port. It is
I connected with Moscow by rail, and
j has another railway into the Siberian
grain fields, through the I ral range,
via Perm and Viatka, and before the
blight of war came to paralyze its in
dustries it was engaged in a lively
trade with the interior cities of Russia
as well as in seaborne exports to Kng
land. Holland and Germany. It had
about 20.000 inhabitants in 1914.
j The city derives its name from the
monastery of St. Michael which is
I there. It also boasts a fine cathedral,
built In the early part of the Nine-
teenth century, said to be the hand
i somest and best lighted cathedral in
I Russia. The other buildings i f inter
est are the ecclesiastical seminary, a
! school of navigation and a naval hos
I pital.
Extremes of Season There
Archangel is a place of seasonal ex
, tremes. .For three months in the win-
ter the Archangclite seldom sees the
j sun and for three months in the sum
! mer he seldom loses sight of it. The
shortest day is three hours, the long
. est twenty-one hours, and for the
' greater part of the vear the tity lies
: under a mantle of snow.
From this environment of snowy
white, as well as from the c: lor
i scheme of its houses, it has acquired
the name of the "White City." White
is the prevailing color, not only of its
landscape, but of its architecture. All
the chief buildings glare with w:.: e
paint and even the window blinds, in
stead of relieving the eye ry the usual
green contrast, are painted while.

An S. O. S. call has been out broad
cast throughout the nation for student
nurses, 25,000 of them are needed vit
ally to fill the vacancies left by the
full fledged nurses that will leave for
service overseas, to bring relief from
pain to our warriors.
All unattached women from 19 to 35
years of age. in pood health and with
a hih school education or its equiva
lent will have an opportunity to enroll
at the Y. M. C. A. on Monday and
Tuesday from 10 a. m. to 7 p. m.
Ask your self this question, "What
am I doing to help win the war?" It
isn't a light task this training, but the
country is facing a shortage at the
present moment of women that will be
prepared for home nursing and upon
the health of our people here in Amer
ica depends the fighting strength of
the soldier. This lack of professional
trained women will become more acute
as the war goes on, that if skilled
service is to he available for the care
of the wounded abroad as weil as the
sick at home the necessary supply of
trained nurses must be increased. This
can only be done by the patriotic wom
en of the country rallying, coming
forth and offering themselves for the
most strenuous training.
To be strong and able to go will be
a great privilege and the greatest pos
sible opportunity that will ever come
to womanhood of America. Over one
third of the men that vo'unteer for
service in the army and nary were
rejected on account of physical dis
ability, so the proportion will natur
ally be greater among women. A good
constitution is absolutely imperative
for there will bp much hard, serious

Now is the time girls begin to gos
sip about school clothes and Indeed
it deserves much thought. Many
schools have a uniform, which is very
fortunate. But if school clothes must
be selected it is imperative that they
be simple. For nothing shows so much
a lack of good taste as an over-dressed
giri. A smart looking sport skirt with
different blouses is always correct;
and suspenders may be added if de
sired. Then the dark one-piece dress is in
dispensable for any age, and should
have detachable collars and cuffs of
lingerie, have several sets for each
dress and put snaps on them so they
may be removed easily and freshened
up. Velveteen and corduroy are well
liked for school clothes. They are both
the most practical material and they
insure warmth and at the same time
save wool.
In any school a girl must have sev
eral simple frocks and also a demi-
deeolete model for the week-end part
ies. Youthful is a pretty frock made
of dull blue voile, with a tunic skirt
and kimono "btfdice. A fluted frill
edges the organdie collar and black
velvet ribbon makes the girdle. A
dress of blue serge with vet or white
pique that peeps out at the neck and
again beneath the eton jacket is very
attractive and a girl would not be quite
norma! that did not wish to wear it
after she sets her eyes upon it. Quite
sophisticated is a frock of navy blue
silk crepe, embroidered in old
threads. The fckirt falls in a plait at
each side that becomes a pocket under
the narrow crepe belt. Other frocks
are made of taffeta or Gorgette, while
point de sprit makes party dresses
that are delightfiflly youthful. Sunday
requires a suit or a dress and a coat,
and these costumes will carry a girl
through the winter of teas and con
certs and matinees. The blouse to ac
company a girl's suit should be of the
same color, for the one color effect Is
the smart thing for young or old, no
matter how good looking a light col
ored blouse may be it still remains a
blouse.
A girl needs a whole trousseau of
lingerie, and of course it must be verv
simple and easily laundered; for this
reason nearly every thinking mother
selects ct has copied the French-made
underthines. Have little colored bands
of colored bias strips of handkerchief
linen binding all edees and a Jlr'en
ribbon which is nothing more or less
than a fold drawn through eyelets or
under shirring of the fabric. But if
real ribbon is preferred, use one of
the double faced satins that has a dif
ferent nastel st'nle on each side. They
look like new a:'ter being washed and
pressed. '
Evening Gowns
Chiffony frocks will be discarded for
brocades and velvets with the fal'ing
of the leaves. A black lace evening
frock cut high in the back and low
in the front and with long sleeves
Lace dresses are very fashionable and
may be of any color, while many cling
to black and taupe, navy blue or gray
are all popular. But it is brown in
the new tete de negre shade that
seems to outrival them all in the
things that are being made up for
winter. A dress of heliotrope taffeta,
made with plaitings of the taffeta give
a quaint old timely look that Is very
fascinating, and ustml is the rib
bon of French blire velvet that makes a
bandeau for one's hair. High straight
neck lines are becoming very fashion
able and sleeveless gowns as well as
a long sleeve for the dinner gown will
be equally popular. A frock of gray
tricolette, hung over a foundation of
black satin and loosely belted. This
material is the very newest thing, rath
er open in mesh, heavy and soft
some might cal! it coarse Jersey, but
it really isn't, it is quite different.
0no finds suits as well as dresses
made from it. Its luster is becom
ing, and the softness of the waves
lends itself to graceful drapery.
Trains lend dignity to gowns for
evening wear. A lovely gown fash
ioned of saphlre ' blue velvet. The
bodice is made of blue net, cut in a
V deco'.letage, and sapphire crystals
are worked upon it in a delicate de
sign. But quite the most striking feat
ure Is the unusual draping of the skirt,
the wrinkled folds of which foretell
the mode of winter. The paneled
train, falling from the waist, bespeaks
formality in the long becoming lines.
Of exquisite harmony are the colors
that are blended in this evening gown
of transparent chiffon. The founda
tion is flesh colored crepe, over which
is hung raspberry and flesh chiffons,
while the bodice is embroidered in
similar shades combined with silver.
Necessary Accessories
Sometimes women reach the stae
where they just can't knit another
stitch. It is an awful feeling and
when you read a novel your consci
ence pricks. So change the occupa
tion of knitting and sew upon your own
personal things, in so doing you1 will
pile up quarters for thrift stamps.
There are many necessary accessories
of dress that are trifling in expense of
material but the handiwork makes
them expensive.
No longer are the collars of the day
doubled but one thickness is used and t
bound on the edges with a bias fold.
A boudoir jacket Is always simple
of construction. The lower part of the
jacket and lower part of the sleeves
are nothing but a straight length of
crepe, shirred a bit at the waist line
and allowed to drape over the arms.
A silver thread run in the picot will
be very a la Lucile. Pierrete is the
new chiffony fabric outrival'.ing Georg
ette and is quite the mode for blouses.
Clusters of wool flowers bloom on
almost every type of costume. These
motifs are worked in gay colors, and
the leaves may he worked in a queer
blue Just as well as green. A per
fectly pjain kimono bodice becomes
exceedingly smart when so embroidered.
With many new- men coming into
the district. Secretary Putnam, urges
all members of the Warren district as
sociation to bring th- ir friends and
acquaintances to the Y and introduce
tlicm, where the man at tha desk will
do the rest. The association cprtainly
offers a v orld of inducements to a
stranger in th,. city and no better
place to spi nd his evenings and spare
time can be found. Many of these
newecmers wi.l become Y members
and Y boosters in this method and the
mere members t ie greater 'the, privi
leges extendd for mmhers.
A bigger and better program for
members who enjoy acquatic reerea-j
tion will be provided just as scon as i
the plunge I.-: finished and thi.( w:ll
more than niake up for the loss o!
the daily swim in the plunge by many
who took advantage of this line fea- ;
ture of the lo'-al .
Jf. F. Roane, supply clerk for the
C. & A., who will Uave in the next
draft quota, has received notice of his
appointment to an officers' training
camp, where he will undergo training
for a commission.
Sergeant Wharam, army recruiting
officer, with .headquarters at the Y,
is now bending his entire efforts to
ward securing men for the engineers'
branch of the service. This is the
only branch in which enlistments ir?
being made, as no men are being
taken for other work in the army,
whije the navy and marines will not
take a man until the new draft law is
passed by congress and goes into ef
fect. Local men who will bo called
under the terms of the new draft law
are keeping Sergeant Wharam busy
with their inquiries about enlisting In
the 472 engineers.
Included in the qualifications ad
mitting men for this service arc those
who can do surveying, mapping, com
puting, photographing, topographical
and drafting work. Men with slight
physical defects are being taken,
while men of draft age classed for
special or limited military service may
be taken, as may those who have de
ferred classification.

Some few of thf. tiling that have
been accomplished by the Young Wo

great wa' have been, hostess houses,
at the training earnps, hospitality cen

men and girls In Industrial centers, all
these have grown out of stubborn per
severance and application to duty, and
are recognized by the public as time
lv and necessary enterprises and in
stitutions. The war work of the Institution Is
just as wide In scope and quite as ac
ceptable to both military authorities
and clvl'inn population. In response
to requests of French women who rea
lized the sad neel in their country,
the Y. W. C A has sent workers to
France. There are at present about
50 workers in that country. Kach of
them have given a good account of her
self anil her organization.
One room of each of the Red Cross
"huts" on or near the hospital grounds
for the use of the nurses when tilt
duty is maintained by the Young Wo

comes to the nurses on the battle line,
where she finds surcease from the
grinding anxiety which Is hers when
on duty.

T'S life or death in the trench there must be no deiay in sup
plying every man in France vith EVERYTHING that he may
ned or want in his iob of lickine the Hun. Many a man's
life will hang on there being another rifle ready to his hands, a
new, keen-edged bayonet, a plentiful supply of grenades. Back
of every man who goes over the top and into the Hun's trenches
there must be a steady, unending flow of supplies.
M
Our job over here is to MAKE SURE the
supplies arc there and at hand. That means
working every minute of every working day.
It 'means, too, STICKING to the job. And
there is one of our gravest dangers. America
is losing more through thoughtless changing
of jobs, thoughtless hiring of men than
through almost any other one thing. It costs
on the average $20 to $200 every time a man
changes his job. The man loses time. A
machine stands idle that ought to be working
top speed on those war supplies.
Changes, of course, must be made, for the
"War industries need more and more men. But
don't let's make changes from one essential
war work to another unless there's a mighty
good reason.
For this purpose the Government has es
tablished the United States Employment Serv
ice with 500 branch offices and 20,000
U. S. Public Service Reserve agent3 to help
men find war work and to help manufac
turers find more men without interfering with
other war work. Use this Service it is free
prompt. It covers the country. It is one
sure way of knowing that you arc HELPING
to win the war.
Address the nearest U. S. Employment
Office or the Director General at Washings

Mrs. La Plant Now
"All my friends know ami can tell
you that for a long time I was almost
a nervous wreck, and this Tanlac has
made such a wonderful change in my
condition that they are simply amazed
at my improvement," said Mrs. Ella
La Plant, who conducts a large room
ing house at 412 Puyallup avenue, 'i'a
coma, Washington, the other day.
"For the last twelve years," she con
tinued, "I had been in a terribly run
down condition and during that whole
time, hardly aday passed that I didn't
suiter from awiul headaches. 1 had
no appetite at all and what little 1
lorceu down would ferment in my
stomach and distress me for hours. My
kidneys were out of order and worried
me nignt and day and my nerves were
so unstrung that, atter going to bed.
any little sound, even the rustling of
a newspaper, would wake me with a
start and it would be some time before
I could drop off to sleep again. 1 had
a very large house to look after, and I
was so weak and miserable that a
couple of hours' work would exhaust
me so that I'd just have to quit for the
rest of the day. The fact is, loss of
sleep and lack of nourishment had
undermined my nervous system and 1
was just wearing myself out.
"I spent all the money I had on medi
cines and treatments that did me no
good, and 1 had about given up hope
of ever getting well, when I began to
read about the good Tanlac was doing
others and I thought I might as wen
try it. Well, sir, the way 1 began to
pick up right after starting on it, sur
prised me, for after experience with
other medicines i uid not expect such
quick resuits. My appetite is just fine
too fine, the way prices are now
for I feel hungry most all tne time.
My kidneys don't worry me at all now,
and 1 am rid of thai terrible backache
at last. Those awful headaches are
all gone, too, which is a grand relief,
besides, I sleep all night like a chili
and feel so strong and rested when I
; get up in the mornings, that I don't
I mind it at all, the work I have to do

FRANK SPENCE, WHO WORKED
IN MINES IN THIS DISTRICT,
IS BEATEN TO DEATH BY MEX
ICAN WITH BASEBALL BAT
REFUSED PAROLE
MISS MINNIE ADAMS, WHO
TAUGHT SCHOOL AT STARK,
THIS COUNTY LAST YEAR, COM
PELLED TO RESIGN IN CALIFOR
NIA SCHOOL
Frank Spence, Mho was a resident
of Cochise county in early days and
ho worked as a miner in Tombstone
and later in Bisbee, was killed in the
penitentiary at Florence a few days
ago by a fellow convict. Spence left
Cochise county a number of years ago
and went to Yavapai county, where he
worked in a number of different mines
up to the time that he was convicted
of the crime of murder and was sen
tenced to be hung. The Phoenix Ga
zette of last Tuesday contains the fol
lowing story of the killing of Spence:
"While guards patrolling the walls
of the Arizona state prison looked ou,
Miguel Giyalva brutally murdered
Frank Spence as he was peacefully
sleeping within the walls of the state
penitentiary Sunday afternoon. Both
men were prisoners at the institution.
"L'Mng a baseball bat as a weapon.
Ciyalva literally battered the head of
the deceased into bits. Death was in
stantaneous, it is believed. The trag
edy was enacted shortly after the
noon hour, it is stated.
Guard Saw Crime
"One of the guards saw Ciyalva
strike the first blow, it is stated, and
shouted a warning. Other guards made
efforts to reach the enraged man. but
in his fury he bad. crushed Spenee'3
skull before the guards could inter
fere. An investigation is being made
by Warden Sims.
"No cause for the crime could be
learned other than the assailant was
temporarily deranged and seeing o
easy victim sleeping, pounced upon
him as a wild beast hunting down its
Drev.
"Giyalva, sentenced from Pinal
rountv for criminal assault, was re
garded by Supt. E. B. Sims as a dan
gerous character and consequently the
warden had ordered the man placed in
solitary confinement.
Warden Was Away
"Warden Sims was called away
from the institution last week and dur
ing his absence someone saw fit to
turn Giyalva into the prison yard,
Warden Sims stated over the tele
phone today. J. J. Sanders, chief
guard at the prison, was the man in
charge during the absence of Sims,
but blame for releasing Giyalva has
not yet been fixed,
v "According to Warden Sims .the
Mexican is mentally unbalanced and
under no circumstances, he said,
should he have been permitted to min
gle with the other prisoners.
Spence Was Well Known
"Spence, the murdered man, was
one of the best known prisoners at
Florence. He was convicted of first
degree murder in Yavapai county and
sentenced to be hanged, the sentenc
being commutted to life imprisonmut
by Governor Sloan in 1910.
"Since his confinement at the state
penitentiary Spence has been a model
prisoner, it was stated this afternoon.
He was offered a parole some time
ago .but refused the same because of
his age and Infirm condition. He suf
fered a stroke of paralysis a few years
ago and was partially crippled."
A telegram which is printed bciow
was recently sent out from Santa
Cruz. Calif., stating that a young lady
school teacher by the name of Miss
Minnie Adams had been dismissed
from the schools at that place on ac
count of her activities in behalf of
the I. W. W:'s and that she came there
from a Bisbee school. Such is not the
case, the Bisbee schools have no such
class of teachers. The young lady In
question as far as can be ascertained,
taught at Stark on the E. P. & S. W.
railroad about twelve miles from this
city last year and came to the county
from California on the recommenda
tion of the San Jose Normal school.
Miss Elsie Toles, county superin-'
tendent, wrote to that institution ak-,
ing for the names of teachers that;
they could recommend to fill places in
this county in which there were va-!
cancies and the name of Miss Adams
was sent. She was hired to teach, the
Stark school and accordinz to the
trustees there she was very earnest in
her support of the wobbly cause and !
would have been released by them '
only that they felt sorry for her and
realized the fact that she was desti
tute and needed the salary that she re
ceived. She told residents of the Stark
district that she was engaged to Mc
Evoy and had known him for some
time. While she was at Stark she re
ceived letters from him continually.
She was radical in her talk at Stark !
and had it not been that the majority
of the pupils at Stark were Mexicans
and the trustees thought that she
could do but little harm, she was re
tained. She resided at Stark with a
family there and had her mail ad
dressed to Bisbee on account of there
being no postoffice at Stark. No one I
could be located here who knew her
The telegram as sent from Santa Cruz !
is as follows:
"Confronted by Sheriff Howard I
Trafton with evidence tending to show i
that she was a member of the Indus-!
trial Workers of the World, Miss Mln-I
nie Adams, a teacher in the Eureka I
schools, resigned her position today, j
day. i
According to the sheriffs office, I
she came here from a school in Bis-1
bee, Ariz., and was believed to have ,
been in correspondence with Peter j
McEvov. one of the Industrial Work-
ers of the World members convicted j
In Chicago on charges of attempting :
to obstruct the government s war j
program. She had taugnt nere uiree
weeks."
