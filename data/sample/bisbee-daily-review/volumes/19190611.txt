WALKOUT OF
TO
START TODAY
Strike Call Is Effective At 8
O'clock This Morning; Say
60.000 To Quit Their Jobs
In Meanwhile Senate Hastens
To Repeal All Control Of
Wire Lines Held By U. S.
CHICAGO, June 10 The Com
mercial Telegraphers' Union of
America was ready tonight to
strike at 8 o'clock tomorrow
morning throughout the country,
S. J. Konenkamp, international
president said tonight. It was
estimated 60,00Q or more tele
graph and telephone workers
would be affected and he express
ed himself satisfied with the out
look. Action by the senate or lower
house would have no effect on
the strike, he said, referring to
passage of the Kellogg wire bill
in the senate today.
WASHINGTON, June 10. On the
eve of the nation-wide telegraphers'
strike, both bodies of congress today
acted quickly to end government con
trol of the country's wire systems.
The senate passed unanimously the
bill for repeal "forthwith" of the law
authorizing federal juri'-Mction over
telegraph, telephone, cable and radio
lines, while the house interstate com
merce committee agreed to report
legislation ending government wire
control June 30 next.
No move was made today by the
postoffice department touching the
situation and officials said that none
would be made, the return of wire
operations having left the situation
to the handling of private manage
ments. At the same time, officials
lately responsible for the conduct of
the telegraph systems were inclined
to discount the possibility that com
munication would be seriously ham
pered by the strike of telegraph op
erators. The threatened walkout of
electrical workers was said to have
more serious possibilities.
Rates Continue 90 Days
The senate in adopting the repeal
bill approved an amendment to con
firms nrpspnt telenhone rates 90 days
or until traffic can be adjusted by
state commissions.
Democrat and Republican senators'
joined in support of the repeal bill
of which Senator Kellogg. Republi-

PHILADELPHIA. June 11. Major
Anthony J. Drexel Bkldle asked by
Tex Rickird, promoter of tbe Wit-
Wets In Frantic Plea to Wilson As
Congress Stands Pat for Dry U. S.
WASHINGTON, June 10. Appeal was made by "Representative
Dyer, Republican of Missouri, in a cablegram to President Wilson today,
to issue a proclamation declaring war time prohibition void, in view of
the apparent determination of congress to let the law stand.
The Missouri representative in his message stated that public hear
ings had gone far enough to satisfy him that repeal measures had no
chance with the house judiciary committee. Hope was expressed that
the president would take action, on his own authority at once.
"I cabled President WilBon," said Mr. Dyer, "that we had given con
sideration in the Judiciary committee to some bills for repeal of war time
prohibition, to the extent of permitting the sale of beer and light wines.
We have gone far enough, I told him, in consideration of these matters
for me to know there was no chance of the committee recommending
any bill of that kind. I told the president I felt the only hope was that
he should take action under authority 1 felt he had."
Mr. Dyer and other members of the judiciary committee who have
felt that a repeal measure would not be reported out, have, contended that
the president would have full power after July 1 to declare by proclama
tion that demobilization was complete, which automatically would per
mit saloons closing on that date, to resume operations.
SOLDIER LAND ACT
110
So Says Campbell On Return
From Capital; Means
Much To Arizona
PHOENIX, June 10. The soldiers'
settlement act which he considered of
the greatest importance to Arizona, is
practically certain to pass congress,
according to leaders of the Republican
party, said Governor Campbell tonight
on his return from the east.
"The only matter to be discussed,"
said the governor "Is the sum the
measure will carry. The Lane bill, as
re-introduced, carries an appropriation
of 1500,000,000, but this may be cut
down before its passage. 'What this
will mean to Arizona, with her unde
veloped irrlgatable land, only can be
conjectured. -.-
"Another matter of importance to
this state is senate bill No. 291, pro
viding for the allotment and improve
ment of the lands in the Colorado In
dian reservation, which has been Intro
duced by Senator Ashurst.
"This bill provides that the land
shallbe surveyed and allotted to the
Indians as they are entitled to it, and
to rese'rve land needed for agency,
schools and religious purposes.
"Land not alloted or otherwise dis
posed of," continued the governor, "is
to be divided into 40-acre tracts and
classified as Irrlgatable, non-irrigat-able,
and mineral land. Sections 16,
19, 32 and 36 In each township are to
be granted to the schools of Arizona
and California.
"The sum of $500,000 is set aside to
build an irrigation system and land
not alloted to the Indians or other-
wise disposed of will be subject to
-
"I consider that the enactment of
this law would be of great benefit to
Arizona and California," said Gover
nor Campbell in conclusion.

WINNIPEG, June 11. Corp. Fred
erick George Coppins, winner of the
Victoria Cross in the war, one of the
special mounted constables on duty
here during the general strike, during
the demonstrations by strikers and
sympathizers this afternoon was pull
ed from his horse and so maltreated
that he Is not expected to recover. Be
sides two ribs being broken from se
vere kicks and serious Injuries to his
head, he is believed to be suffering
from internal injuries.
WINNIPEG, June 10. Serious
clashes resulted from demonstrations
by strike sympathizers against re
turned soldiers-constables this even
ing. A large crowd gathered between
the city hall and Portage avenue, with
the main disturbance occurring at the
corner of Portage avenue and Main,
where strikers and sympathizers dis
armed and assaulted individual special
police
A squad of special police and .
mounted police then paraded the af-:
fected area.
Missiles were thrown by the crowd,
tbe police retaliating by a free use of
their batons on the heads of demon
strants. At 6:30 the special police had the
situation well in hand and calm was
restored. A number of returned soldier-constables
and demonstrants were
severely battered and one war veteran
was seriously Injured.
Mayor Charles F. Gray announced
he would not call out the troops to
quell the rioting. He said the special
constables would be able to handle the
situation.
The trouble started when a few dem
onstrants booed and jeered at the re
turned soldier special mounted con
stables, .replacing the policemen, who
yesterday were dismissed by the po
lice commission. A laree crowd quickly
gathered. Suddenly it surged into the
street and attacked the half dozen
special constables, who plied their
batons vigorously. A large sauad of
special policemen were made the tar
gets for stones, bottles, sticks and oth
er missiles. The disturbances con
tinued for nearly two hours and ended
after about 20 constables and an equal
number of demonstrants were painful
ly but not seriously bruised anrl cut.

Sen. Knox. Offers Resolution
Notifying Peace Envoys In
Paris Of Treaty Opposition
Bitter War Looms As Foes
Of League Mobilize; Leak
Probe Will Call Morgan
WASHINGTON, June 10. The sen
ate fight over the League of Nations
was brought to a more direct issue
today with- the introduction of a reso
lution by Senator Knox, Republican, of
Pennsylvania, proposing that the sen
ate give formal notice to the peace
conference of opposition to be expect-
i ed should the peace treaty be subniit
' ted for ratification in its present form.
I Senator Knox, a member of the for-
eign rela!ions committee, and a former
secretary of state, drafted the resolu-
! tion after the conference with other
league opponents and presented it
with the apparent support of those
who have led in criticism of the
league covenant. He expected to crys
talize opposition sentiment as did
! Senator Lodge with the circulation of
the round robin In the closing hours
of the last senate.
Offers Substitute Policy
While declaring for immediate con
clusion of a treaty dealing with di
rect issues of the war only, the resolu
tion contains a far reaching proposal
which would lay it down as a policy
of the American government that
whenever the freedom and peace of
Europe is threatened, the United
States will consider it obligatory to
again co-operate on the removal of
that menace.
Decision as to acceptance of member
ship in the League of Nations should
be left without prejudice to each na
tion, the resolution declares, for fu
ture separate consideration. It also
asserts the lack of authority by the
treaty making power of the govern
ment to make a treaty which in effect
amends the American constitution.

tion was referred without debate to

E SUM TO PAV
FOR RAIL CONTROL
WASHINGTON, June 10. By a vote
of 305 to 4- the house today passed
the bill authorizing an appropriation
of $750,000,000 for the railroad admin
istration's revolving fund. Democratic
members urged a larger amount, but
did not press any amendment for an
increase, while Republicans declared
the fund would be sufficient until
later in the year when future needs
would be known. The measure now!
goes to the senate, where leaders plan
early action.
Votes against the appropriation
were cast by Representatives An
thony, Kansas; Ramseyer, ' Iowa;
Woodyard, West Virginia, Republi
cans, and Thomas, Kentucky, Demo
crat. None of them urged his objec
tions to the bill during the debate,
which was marked by the injection of
considerable political discussion.
Chairman Good of the appropria
tions committee, in charge of the rai
bill, explained that ' reduction from
the - $1,200,000,000 requested by Di
rector General Hines.was decided on
by the committee because it was ad
mitted that exact needs of the future
were problematical. The new fund, he
said, would make a total of $1,250,000,

the rail lines were taken over by the
government.

Juarez, Deserted By All But Troops,
Waits Attack; Rebels Pew Miles off
EL PASO, June 10. Juarez, cut off from communication with the
balance of Mexico, had all the appearance of a deserted village today.
A large portion of the civilian population had already sought refuge in
El Paso and the 2500 troops were either confined to barracks or on duty
in the trenches and outer defenses cf the city.
From the roofs of tall buildings in El Paso men could be seen at
work where the Mexican Northwestern crosses the Mexicon Central
railroad three or four miles out of the city, but whether these were fed
erals or rebels could not be ascertained. Observers with field glasses
could plainly see the Boldiers in the trenches and around the block
houses apparently engaged in battle practice in anticipation of attack.
So far as is definitely known the nearest rebels, are at Guadalupe,
30 miles east of Juarez, where General Felipe Angeles, Ramon Vega and
Martin Lopez have a large force of cavalry. The country where the
rebels are located is well watered with plenty of grazing for the horses,
and it is believed the rebels are resting in preparation for the attack
which even federal officials in Juarez admit is inevitable. It is also
admitted that the rebels outnumber the available federals and that the
latter are cut off from retreat in any direction save across the Rio Grande
into the United States.

ON LEAGUE DOOR
Carranza's Son-In-Law Upon
Mission To Paris To
Conciliate Allies
WASHINGTON, June 10. Gen. Can
dido Aguilar, son-in-law of President
Carranza, came to the United States to
enlist the aid of the American govern
ment in obtaining admission for Mex
ico to the league of nations, according ,
to advices today from Mexico City.
General Aguilar called on Acting!
Secretary Polk today and later confer-1
red with Henry P. Fletcher, American
ambassador to Mexico.
From Washington General Aguilar
wlil go to Paris to see President Poin
care in an effort to Influence France
in Mexico's behalf and later he will
visit London hoping to fully restore
diplomatic relations between 'Great
Britain and Mexico.
Great Britain has not had a minis
ter in Mexico City for many months
and does not wish to send one until
Mexico shows a disposition to pay the
interest on its foreign debt, restore
confiscated property and protect the
lives, rights and properties of British
subjects.
According to the advices from Mex
ico City, President Carranza sees
growing resentment among the Mex
ican people who blame him for the
exclusion of Mexico from the league of
nations.
General Obregon and Pablo Gon
zales, announced candidates for the
presidency in the elections have de
clared they will endeavor to obtain ad
mission of Mexico to the league.
BORDER IS PEACEFUL,
BUT GIVE ME TROOPS,
DECLARES GOV. HOBBY
AUSTIN, Texas, June 10. Condi
tions along the Mexican border are not
alarming and his refusal to permit
Mexican troops to be transported
through Texas and his suggestion to
the war department that Texas caT
alry be mobilized should not be taken
as an indication that imminent danger
exists, according to Got. W. P. Hobby
In a statement here today. The situa
tion on the lower border Is peaceful,
the governor said, but conditions In
the El Paso district are different, re
ports confirming that headway is be
ing gained by Francisco Villa and Gen.
eral Felipe Angeles.
In event of Angeles and Villa captur
ing any important points in Chihua
hua, Governor Hobby said It was like
ly "outbreaks will occur at several
points."
The statement continues:
"I am firmly convinced that pre
venting the passage of the troops
through Texas and mobilizing the Tex
as cavalry under the direction of the
secretary of war would have great
force and effect to the end of protect
ing American citizens and the Amer
ican border at the inclpiency of a
movement which foreshadows trou
ble." DENY POSTAL AGREEMENT
NEW YORK. June 10 Reports that
Clarence II. Mackay, president of the
Postal Telegraph-Cable company, had

NO AID OF JUAREZ
Forces Are All Kept Within
State; Dare Not Risk
Mountain Passes
DOUGLAS, June 10. Neither Gen
eral Carlos Plank, commander of the
Sonora rural guard, nor any force of
troops whatsoever has gone from So
nora within the last few weeks, it was
said today by Mexicans in Agua
Prieta, in a position to know troop
movements in the interior of Sonora.
General Plank when last heard of,
two days ago, was in the vicinity of
, Cananea.
The report that Plank had led 2000
men through Pulpito Ojitos pass from
Sonora to Chihuahua is said to have
originated in Mexico City, growing out
of a tentative plan to send a force via
Agua Prieta and Colonia Morelos and
i Pulpito pass 'to Chihuahua, which
! never was brought about,
j Several prominent Sonorans inter
viewed today scouted the idea of any
troops being sent to Chihuahua under
existing conditions. No . more than
1000 soldiers by actual count could be
spared and 'with the rail route
through the United States closed to
them, it would be madness, they said,
to send so small a force through tbe
rugged mountain pass where a few
hundred Villistas not only could stop
them, ' but practically annihilate a
much larger force.
The actual number of troops now
in Sonora was said by these Mexicans
to be between 3000 and 3500, although
claims ot larger forces have been
made recently by federal army offi
cers. This force is to be augmented within
the next few weeks by the arrival
from Guadalajara of a regiment of
lancers, under command of Colonel
Fortunato Moell, which with its
mounts, left Guadalajara for Manzan
illo the latter part of last week, ac
cording to reports reaching Agua
Prieta today. The regiment was to be
brought either to Mazatlan or Guay
mas by transport and from there by
train to the Yaqui river section of So
nora to engage in the campaign
against the' Indians. The regiment of
lancers is reported to bo one of the
crack organizations of the Mexican
federal army.

Short, General Reply To Be
Handed 7f Germans At
End Of The Present Week
PARIS, June 10. (By the Asso
ciated Press.) Apparently there
is little hope that the ajied reply
to the German counter proposals
will be ready before the end of
the present week.
When completed it will consist
of a short reply1 in general terms
covering all the German proposals.
Then will follow answers prepared
by various commissions showing
the reasons why the allies cannot
grant specific requests.
PEACE MEET SUMMARY
Again reports come from Paris that
all is not going smoothly in the coun
cil of four as regards the definite set
tlement of points under argument re
lating to the German peace treaty.
While it has been asserted the
final answer to the counter proposals
of the Germans probably would be
ready for delivery to the Germans not
later than Friday,' late dispatches de
clare some of the larger questions at
issue have not been solved and that
considerable pessimism prevails as a
result of this situation. Notable
among the points upon which no agree
ment has been reached, according to
reports is the Silesian question and
the matter of the Polish frontier. Add
ed to this is the implacable stand of
Premier Clemenceau against any modi
ifications in the peace terms, con
trary to the attitude of President Wil
son and Premier Lloyd George, who
are declared to have recognized the
necessity for lessening somewhat the
demands in certain clauses of the
treaty.
Forms! Senate Opposition Offered
In accordance with a resolution in
troduced in the United States senate
; the peace conference at Paris would
! be notified of opposition to be ofiered
i rati.ication of the treaty if it should
! be submitted to the senate in its pres
ent form. Senator Philander C. Knox,
a former secretary of state, introduc
ed the resolution which was submitted
to the foreign relations committee.
Although cable dispatches have in
timivjed the French were leaning fav
orably toward the new Rhenish repub
lic, a high French authority is cred
ited with the statement that the at
titude of France is a passive one;
that the French forces have been in
structed simply to maintain order.
The ultimatum of Premier Clemen
ceau to the Hungarians that allied
troops would be used against them un
less they ceased operations against
the Czecho-Slovaks has borne fruit.
Bela Kun, the Hungarian foreign min
ister, has agreed to a cessation of hos
tilities. All American troops on the Arch
angel fighting front have been with
drawn to the coast and will start
homeward next Sunday.
The constitutional Democrat party
at a congress at Omsk, Russia, has
passed a resolution declaring solidar
ity with the entente nations and de
nouncing Bolshevism as the enemy of
humanity.

STRIKERS ARE SUED
FOR TWO MILLIONS
Citizens of Pittsburgh Ask
Relief For Losses In
Street Car Strike
PITTSBURG, June 10. The people
of Pittsburg, through A. E. Anderson,
an attorney, filed a suit in equity in,
court here late today against the
Amalgamated Association of Street
and Electric employes, in which the
union is asked to pay damages of
$2,035,000.78, which sum it is claimed
was lost by the people as a result of
the recent street car strike.
The suit raises the question of the
right of persons engaged in " public
service enforce demands for better
pay and improved working conditions.
Receivers of the Pittsburg Railways
company are named as party defend
ants. The actions of the strikers were and
are unlawful, it is alleged, and in
fringed and invaded the rights of
trade, business and travel, which was
in violation of the constitution of the
United States and the state of Penn
sylvania and a conspiracy and a com
bination in restraint of trade.
Mr. Anderson places the loss he suf
fered as a result of the strike at 78
cents, computing the . amount as the
difference between the railroad train
fare be paid and what it would have
cost him to ride on street cars.

the foreign relations committee. He
will attempt to get committee action
tomorrow or Thursday and hopes to
bring it up in the senate for consid
eration by the end of the week. The
resolution is sure to open a new chap
ter in the League of Nations fight and
to develop a debate which may be
even more bitter than that over pub
lication of the treaty text.
There were many conferences among
senators over provisions of the treaty,
published in full in today's Congres
sional Record, and the foreign rela
tions committee made plans to re
sume tomorrow Its investisatiyn wf
how treaty copies reached private
hands in New York. Of th2 six finan
ciers the committee had summoned
three, J. P. Morgan Henry P. Davi
son, anu Frank A. vanaerlip, sent.
word they would be ready to appear
tomorrow.
The committee is expected to agree
tomorrow on other witnesses to be
called later in the week.
Thomas W.' Lamont,. one of the
financiers summoned, is said to be in
France and it is considered unlikely
that the committee will make a fur
ther effort at this time to have him
come to Washington. Another, Jacob
Schiff, asked to be excused because
of ill health, and Paul Warburg had
left New York for Detroit when the
summons arrived and had not replied
tonight.
Senators Champion China
In comment on the treaty text, put
into the record after a long fight yes
terday by Senator Borah, Republican,
of Idaho, there were three topics
about which interest centered. They
were the provisions affecting Shan
lung and the Saar valley and the sec
tion providing for an international la
bor control. Several senators oppos
ing the treaty said the text revealed
that the right of self-determination in
Shantung and the Saar had been nioro
closely curtailed that had been ap
parent heretofore and that the inter
national labor section went much fur
ther than they had expected.
All of these sections are expected to
be discussed in the senate in the near
future. Senator Walsh, Democrat, of
Montana, a League of Nations suppor
ter, gave notice during the day of his
intention to speak tomorrow on that
subject, and his address may bring on
another debate involving other treaty
provisions.

to limit the restoration of supervision
of interstate rates. The amendment,
he said, would leave intrastate tariffs
"at the mercy of the railroad adminis

states as to intrastate. rates would be
indefensible.

Two Big New Savings for
Car Owners and Truck Owners
Never before have Firestone Tires been so decidedly better
than others as they now are. So, for months back dealers,
car owners and truck operators have been saying: "It's the
Firestone Year."
And on top of this quality advantage offered in the improved
Gray Sidewall Fabric and Cord Tires, on top of the enlarged
size and extra heavy tread, come these two other Firestone
savings
Much lower prices and adjustments made on a bigger
mileage basis.
NOTE THIS NEW SCHEDULE
Fabric Tires 6,000 Miles
Cord Tires 8,000 Miles
Solid Tires 10,000 Miles
You can thank the rubber market for a part of the price
saving. You can thank Firestone men 90 of whom are
stockholders in the company for a tire of such quality.
6,000 miles, 8,000 miles, 10,000 miles these are only beginning
points from which you can figure the extra miles that have
made this the "Firestone Year" and given greater meaning
than ever to the Firestone pledge of

to Paradise from Xacozari, where he
has 'been looking over some proper

Nacozari as very bad. Roving band3
of Mexican outlaws keep the natives
in terror, and it is unsafe for Amer

mining property, running high in sil

Americans, who feel that it is ' too
good to let drop, and yet owing to the

BUILDING BOOM STARTS
PHOENIX, Ariz.. June 10. As if
loosened from a leash, builders are
going forward with construction work
by leaps and bounds. Evidences of a
great building boom are everywhere
visible.
Restrained from activities for many
months, through a ruling of the war
industries board, contractors are just
now awakening to a new era of pro
gression a period of activity never
Our Mechanical Life
After taking an exhaustive survey of life one is led to the conclus
ion that the machinery business would be a pretty good line to be in!
Figure It out for yourself.
You get up in the morning, array yourself iu garments built from
machine-made cloth, eat some machine-made breakfast food, drink ma.
chine-cut coffee, read a newspaper that remarkable machinery has made
possible, take a machine known as a street car to your office building
where an elevating mechanism hoists you to the floor on which you me
chanically go through the day's tasks. You write your letters by dictat
ing them out on another machine. A little contraption standing on your
desk carries your voice to various parts of the city and brings the con
versation of friends and business acquaintances to your ear. On dark
days you illuminate the gloom by electric light generated in a vast machinery-driven
power plant.
At night some friend takes you home in a four-wheeled machine
which is a mechanical marvel It gets such startlingly enormous mile
age from a gallon of gas, at least it does to hear said friend tell about it.
You read another newspaper also printed on machinery of course. For
the evening meal you have a soup skillfully canned by some mechanical
process, some other canned goods, and ice cream made by a lot of ma
chinery in a big plant. Then you go to a movie where mechanism repro
duces a drama on a silver screen for your benefit. You finally hop into
a bed assembled from a lot of parts made by machinery.
No wonder the machinery business looks like a good line to get into.
No wonder a man often gets into the habit of thinking he's a good deal of
a machine himself!
Smil
es
How much they mean in life! How vi-
Smiles!
How important they are!
tally they affect us!
Smiles!
There's wifey's smile for hubby in the springtime after she has
stopped and looked and hearkened to the song of the price tags in the
spring shop windows and has decided that hubby will stand for a new
outfit if properly approached. There's hubby's smile for wifey after a
big poker game when luck was "agin" him and he is contemplating re
questing a further reduction in the houshold expenses. There's the smile
with which the tailor presents a long overdue bill. And there's the smile
with which you approach the boss in quest of a raise and a smile with
;whlch your secretary asks for the afternoon off to visit a sick friend.
Ob Boy, the things that smiles do to us!
How a pretty girl's smile makes a man straighten up and wish he'd
put on a Tresh collar! How a business rival's smile makes a man grit his
teeth and endeavor to get even. . And ooooohhh, man. what things are
done to us by the smife of the sweet young thing who has taken a job
Jn the office to have something to occupy her time until she lands a beau,
and who pays about as much attention to her job as she does to the Neb
ular Hypothesis. Oh, that everlasting, irritating, exasperating smile
the smile that won't come off when, she is reprimanded for mistakes, or
urged to get busy or asked to stop having so many personal phone calls
during business hours. Ooooooohhh, the things that smile has done to
UB made us the probable murderer some blue Monday of the sweet
' young thing and her smile!
Talk about smiles brightening the world! Ye Gods, how the whole
office would leap for joy if this dame would only weep. '
And Why Not?
Advertising for friends!
Why not? Why shouldn't a person who comes to a strange town
insert some such announcement in the daily papera as this? "My name
is Sam Wallace, from Akron, O. I am 28 years old, single, college grad- .
uate, member of church and interested in athletes. I want to meet
some congenial folks."
No doubt there would be other people in the new town from Akron (
who would be glad to meet Sam because of their mutual acquaintances.
There are also raaiy good men and women in each town who would
be glad o welcome strangers if they knew who and what they are.
Of course, the advertisement could only attract acquaintances. If
that meeting is congenial the relationship would soon grow inio one or
friendship.
Yes, we know there are drawbacks to such a scheme, but where Is
there a good Idea without its occasional "back fire?"
We must take Schleswig-Holsteln from Germany because it belongs
to Denmark, and Denmark doesn't want it because it is full of Gentians.
Here, waiter; a small order of self-determination.
We have eight Bhips of pork and flour in the Baltic, ready to be

If Sergeant York keeps his head from swelling in spite of all this
hero worship, it will be an even more remarkable achievement than cap

Mrs. Pcunypacker of Texas says that a human moral issue Is neces
sary to interest women in politics. Offhand, we can't tbink of any
thing that ia fuller of human moral Issues than politics.
When asked for interviews, the kaiser tells newspaper men that hia
attitude ia unchanged. That unchanged attitude stuff is what is afflict
ing the whole of Germany.
Paderewskl says he is afraid Germany is preparing to attack Poland.
We have no doubt but that he is right. The preparation will extend
over a period of years, however.
Some decades will pass before another ordinary, two-legged man has
the gall to say that he won't stand any foolishness from a great nation.
In this glad day of self-determination, almost everybody has a sphere

of our flag have we had Buch an oc
casion for celebration of the event a3
we have this year, says the Flag day
bulletin. "During the last 12 monthB
we have come to respect and rever
ence our American flag Old Glory
in a way in which we have never done
before. We have come to realize as
never before, the significance and far
reaching influence of the things for
which America stands as symbolized
by our flag. Since last Flag day the
proud imperial Germany autocracy
has had to acknowledge the power and
significance of the American flag as
an ally of right aid justice."
'The Flag in France" "The Flag in
Peace and in War," "The Making and
Adoption of Our Flag' "are some of the
topics suggested for addresses or short

EX-MONTENEGRIN KING
MAY BE ITALIAN ALLY
ROME, June 10. The stay of King
Nicholas of Montenegro and his court
in Italy is causing a lot of comment
and conjecture. The king and hie party
arrived incognito at Rapallo two
weeks ago. Nicholas has never been
reconciled to the union of Montenegro
with the new Jugo-Slav republic. The
queen of Italy is one of his daughters.
Should the Italy-Jugo-Slav controversy
fail of peaceful settlement the follow
ers of Nicholas in Montenegro might
be expected to give material aid to the
Italian cause.

TELEGRAPHERS NOT TO STRIKE
PHOENIX. June 10. Telegraph ser

He based this announcement, he
stated on the receipt of a petition
yesterday morning, In which they
declared their their loyalty to the

The saxophone has come into its
own in this month's Columbia Rec
ords. At one time all the French mili
tary bands discarded horns, oboes and
bassoons in favor of saxophones. The
Columbia Saxophone Sestette has
achieved artistic successes in render
ing Chong," last month's song hit,
and "Waiting" as medley fox-trots.
The saxophone is becoming more and
more popular in musical circles, and
this double record gives the genuine
saxophone tone.
"Longing" is a love song sung by
the Sterling Trio for Columbia this
month with equally beautiful words
and music. A muted cornet, with or
chestral accompaniment, plays the
chorus as an instrumental interlude
with charming effect. The American
Quartette, a new Columbia organiza
tion, introduces itself with "Lullaby
Blues" on the other side of the record.
The title is a tongue-twister if you say
it fast, but the harmony of the song
is excellent.
From now on Jack . Kaufman will
join his popular brother Irving singing
for Columbia. This month they tell all
about eyes in a duet entitle: "Eyes
That Say I Love You" the only kind
that appeal to the Kaufman brothers.
This song is coupled with "When the
Bees Make Honey Down in Sunny
Alabama." another duest by the two
Kaufmans. Adv.

Praise Rocky Mountain Club
The trip back to the states and the I
district was one of the most pleasant
experiences of the entire enlistment
period, according to the returning he
roes. In New York the Rocky Moun
tain club exerted every effort to make
the visit of the Arizonans pleasant.
Banquets and dances were features of
this program of entertainment, but one
of tho most enjoyable of the features
and one which each of the returned
men will remember longest, was an in
timate tour of the city under the aus
pices of members of the club.

The Company
of the Future
Mr. J. C. Barkwell, who has been employ
ed by the Phelps Dodge Corporation as
Supt. of the drilling operations on Sacra
mento Hill at Bisbee passed through El
Pa30 yesterday enroute to Bisbee to spend
a day Htraightening up his busines affairs
before returning to Ranger to take charge
of all drilling operations for the Southwest
ern Oif Development Company. Prior to
Mr. Barkwell's going to Bisbee he was con-
" nected'with the oil industries of the East.
He has had unlimited experience in the
Pennsylvania and Virginia oil fields and
knows the drilling game thoroughly.
Mit Larkwell has spent the past three
months in the Ranger district, and his
knowledge of drilling has been gained from
his intimate association and acquaintance
which he has had with drilling contractors.
The Southwestern is therefore very fortun
ate in securing the services of a man who
is so well qualified to take charge of their
work. They are fortunate in being able to
commence drilling on their Woods tract
next Ueek as they have secured, a string of
tools and Mr. Barkwell has associated with
him efficient and capable drillers and as
sures the company that he will have the
well on this tract drilled in. in fitty days.
With his force of drillers Re anticipates
completing this Job in even less time.
This company has made strenuous ef
forts for the past three weeks to get a con-
. tractor who would undertake the work but
on account of the great scarcity of efficient
. labor we would have been unable to get
these men started as the jobs which the,
already had under way have required more
time due to their inefficiency. Mr. Bark
well reports fifty strings of idle tools in
that district with contractors clamoring for
drillers. On account of the great rush they
refuso to take on any more work.
Our representative is in California pur
chasing another string of tools and as
quickly as they are received Mr. Barkwell
will put them into commission. We have

(officers watched closely his actions.
Then they set a trap for him. In an
easily accessible place they put false
plans and outlines of an attack by the
Americans on the fortress of Metz,
scheduled to occur later in the month.
The spy fell into the trap, took the
papers and escaped to the German
lines.
German Army Foiled by Trap
This marked the opening of the
great American offensive on the Ar
gonne front, declares the narrator. At
the scheduled time the Americans of
the 340th artillery, laid down their
barrage before Metz. All along the
American line similar barrages were
laid down. Strong raiding parties
went over the top in front of Metz.
and it was discovered that the Ger
man had concentrated his reserves to
deliver a sweeping defeat on the
Americans when they stormed the
city.
But the Americans did not storm the
city. Instead their offensive was
launched on the Argonne, and one of
the most historic and bloodiest bat
tles of the entire war was fought, with
the Teuton on the losing end.
On November -11,. report the return
ed Eoldiers, the 340th had been sched
uled to go over the top in an attack
on Metz. At 9 o'clock the Germans
threw down one of the fiercest bar
rages of the entire war. Inside a few
moments the Americans .unlimbered.
"The German barrage sounded like a
Chinese New Year celebration after
that," declared the soldier.
Says Armistice Premature
Members of the 89th division were
relieved with the signing of the armis
tice. They were glad the whole thing
was over, they say. But since, they
declare, they have come to the conclu
sion that it would have been better,
that peace would have been more last- j
ing and the Germans would have been
better subjugated, if they had con
tinued the fight until Berlin fell. The
cost of life, say many of the return
ing soldiers, would have been justi
fied. Every one of the boys is glad to be
back in this district. Arizona looks
good to them, they declare, and they
will remain. Most of them will resume
their former positions in the district
after a few days visiting and resting
and entertainment.

O automobile owners and

the B. F. Goodrich Rubber
Company herewith declares a
more - mileage adjustment on
Goodrich Tires 6,000 miles for
SAFETY TREADS, and 8,000
miles for SILVERTOWN CORDS.
Fix these new Goodrich Adjustment figures
firmly in your mind 6,000 miles for SAFETY
TREADS 8.000 miles for SILVERTOWNS
instead of the 3,500 and 5Q00 miles
respectively heretofore in force.
This new adjustment stands back of all Good
rich Tires, including Tires already purchased
in the hands of user or dealer.
Goodrich Tires in actual usage are today un
' folding such matchless mileage, regularly in
excess of Adjustment basis, that Goodrich
knows it has the strongest, most durable
tires the rubber industry has produced.
The Goodrich adjustment mileage is increased
because Goodrich knows the mileage in its
tires, and it wants to give every motorist a
share in their economy. '
Go to a Goodrich Dealer, and buy a Goodrich
Tire, sure that with fair and square usage
a Safety Tread will render you at least 6,000
miles; and a Silvertown Cord at least 8,000.

VILLARD - DEMPSEY
BOUT PUT ENTIRELY
IN HANDS OF ARMY
TOLEDO, June 10. Tex Rlekard.
promoter of the heavyweight cham
pionship contest between Jess Willard
and Jack Dempsey here July 4 .tonight
requested Maj. Anthony J. Drexel,
president of the army, navy and civil
ian board of boxing control, to select
the referee for the contest. Rickard
said Willard and Dempsey had agreed
to accept the selection of the board.
Rickard in his letter to Major Bid
die, suggested the board name all of
the officials to be connected with the
contest, which Includes the referee
and two judges, if the board so de
cides; to appoint the official timekeep
er and to alter any conditions of the
match, which the board believes will
be helpful to the glove sport.
Tlickard's startling announcement
came as a distant surprise to the score
or mora candidates who have sought
to be appointed referee.
Major Biddle, a millionaire sports
man of Philadelphia, always has been
supporter of boxing and won some
amateur glove championships himself.
It was said tonight the board would
respond favorably to Promoter Rick
ard's appeal.
Willard covered four miles on the
road this morning and boxed seven
rounds this afternoon. The cut over
Dempsey's eye did not permit the chal
lenger to do any glove work.
Rickard'a letter to Major Biddle fol
lows: "I am writing to you in your ca
pacity as president of the Army, Navy
and Civilian Board of Boxing. For
many years I have been convinced
that boxing in this country is handi
capped because of the absence of a
proper organization ta look after its
Interests.
"Boxing was in an even worse con
dition iu England when Lord Lons
dale had the moral courage to come
forward and establish the National
Sporting club of boxing control.
. "All honor to you, for having done
the same thing In accepting the presi
dency of the Army, Navy and Civilian
Board of Boxing Control, whicli I un
derstand, Colonel Roosevelt would
have done, had he lived.

ELKS WILL OBSERVE
. FLAG DAY IN BISBEE
Elks of the district will march from
the Elks club rooms to the Grand
theatre, to attend in a body the Flag
Day exercises, to be held in the the
atre at 2 o'clock next Sunday atter
noon. The exercises will be under
the auspices of the local Elks lodge,
but the public is urged to attend.
R. E. . Shepnerd, of Phoenix, well
known orator of this state, has been
secured to deliver the address of the
occasion. He will arrive in the dis
trict Saturday evening.
A committee of the lodge is ar
ranging for the program which will in
clude several musical numbers and
other features to be announced later.
Elks of this district have made it a
custom in the past several years to
recognize Flag Day with especial ser
vices, and last year held one of the J
most successful services in the his
tory of the, local organization.
Crime Wave In
Warren Looked
For? Want Cop
for the exhibition between Willard and
Dempsey, it is in my power to do
something td strengthen the authority
of your board ,and after discussing
the matter with the Toledo Boxing
commission ,two of the members of
which the mayor, Cornelius Schrei
ber, and its chairman, Christopher
Wall are on your board, we have de
cided to invite you to assume control
in regard to the appointment of all
the officials, the referee, two judges
(if you think that advisable) and the
timekeeper. I also ask you to alter
my conditions under which the exhi
bition will be conducted, if in the opin
ion of your board, any such changes
are inconsistent with ihe laws of hu
manity and . the rules of clean and
wholesome sport.
"Before sending this invitation to
your board, I, of course, consulted
Willard and Dempsey and when I
pointed out the greater amount of
good It was In their power to do to
boxing by supporting your board, to
their credit, be it said, they readily
assented.
"I will be obliged if you could in
form me at your earliest convenience
of the decision of your board in the
matter."
Sone one must be plotting
crimes in Warren.
At least, some one must iiave a
"hunch" that crimes may be com
mitted in that quiet residence sec
tion of the district. And, having
the "hunch" that some one is pre
paring. Yesterday petitions begging,
praying, and asking of the board
of supervisors of Cochise county
that they appoint a deputy sheriff
for the Warren residential section,
were in circulation on the streets
of Warren and in the business
houses of that little city.
According to residents of War
ren the necessity for a deputy has
existed in that part of the district
for the past two or three years.
Its distance from the nearest dep
uty's office, and .the fact that oc
casionally there are times when
an officer is seriously needed, are
offered as reasons. It is on these
grounds that the petitions are be-'
ing circulated.
Many residents of the city
signed the petitions yesterday, ac
cording to those who have been
circulating them. They will be
presented to the board at their
next regular meeting.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. June 10 Renewed
expression of concern on the part of
the federal reserve bank officials in
Washington regarding excessive spec
ulation was considered the dominat
ing factor in a depression of from 1
to 18 points in prices in the stock! ex
change today. The turn oyer inj shares
approximated the two million mark.
The rate on call ; money for mixed
loans did not advance beyond its cus
tomary 6 per cent and this conformed
to the understanding that the federal
reserve officials regarded as imprac
ticable and such method of favoring
speculation, owing to the fact that
there is so much government financ
ing in progress which must not be sub
jected to Interference. The rate on
industrial loans ruled at 9 per cent
late in the afternoon.
- In some quarters the opinion was
expressed that an analysis of the fed
eral reserve bank's letter to its mem
ber banks asking for information as
to extent of borrowing for specu
lative purposes showed that the com
munication was not intended to deal
with investments in seasoned securi -
ties, but rather only with certain oil
properties and other enterprises be -
lieved to be worthless. After publl -
cation of this interepretation, late inj
the . session, prices improved some -
what, but the market closed heavv and
its tone was decidedly uncertain.
Short covering also was a factor in
the late moderate recoveries.
Southern Pacific's loss of 3 points
wa3 accounted for by its poor April
earnings. Losses generally ranged
from 2 to 18 points in motors, 1 to 8
in shippings, 1 to 7 in oils, 1 to 3 in
rails and 1 to 5 in equipments. United
States Steel suffered under the effect
of the general weakness and declined

failure of the Chicago, Rock Island
and Pacific to take action on preferred
dividends and the political develop
ments in Washington were not over
looked by the bears.
After the market's close there was
an immense borrowing demand for
stocks in the loan market, confirming
other evidences of a largely expanded
short account. Sales 1,900,000 shares.
Bonds reflected in a moderate way
the weakness of stocks, with the Lib

par -alue, $13,300,000. It was reported
that the Japanese government hcd in
vested $130,000,000 in the certificates
jof indebtedness of the United States
treasury. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.

from 25c decline to a rise of 10c.
Weakness in the corn market be
came pronounced in. the last hour. It
was at this juncture reports were cir

reserve board to the various reserve
banks had been sent expressing per

speculation. Simultaneous downtruns
In stocks and cotton had a further
bearish effect on corn. Previously the
corn market during the greater part

of more. Bearish sentiment due to
