FINAL VOTE ON
FOOD BILL MAY
BE SATURDAY
!
Mass of Amendments Offered;
in Senate One Is Accepted;
Provisions Are Stringent1
in the Extreme for Viola-'
tions. i
(By Review Leaseu Wire)
, WASHINGTON. July 18. Sen
w
ate consideration of the ad
ministration food control bill,
began a month ago today, is ap
proaching an end. Voting upon am
endments began today and tomorrow
discussion will proceed under a ten
minute limit toward the final Vote to
be taken Saturday.
One Amendment Made
Only one amendment was disposed
of today but that, relating to sales by
government agents of their own prod
ucts to the government, has been be
fore the senate almost exclusively for
a week. A re-draft of the provision of
fered by Senator Pomerene was adopt-
ed tentatively but probably finally, by ;
a vote of 54 to 17. It is designed to
meet, especially, the supply purchas
ing situation of the defense council
and its advisory bodies.
The actual effect of the amendment
was disputed by senators tonight
Those who had advocated it declared .
it was entirely satisfactory to the ad-1
ministration and council members, i
Equal satisfaction was expressed by j
those advocating more drastic action. ,
No Criticism Meant I
" During the discussion Senator Pjm-;
erene declared no serious criticism
could be lodged against the council's j
oHvUnrv rnmmission and that its use-
f.,mpSR 'should not be crippled by pas-'
sage of the original committee amend
ment which its opponents predicted
might prevent the prominent men on
the board from serving as commission
ers without pay from continuing their
positions. Senator Reed and others
insisted that all was sought was tt
prevent contracts for their supplies
from being controlled by the commis
sioners. The accepted amendment pro
vides: The Amendment
"That no person acting either as a
...i,,.!. n. ..u ,nt . sn.ninv. hf ,
the United States in any capacity, in
cluding an advisory capacity, shall so
licit, induct or attempt to induce any
person or Officer authorized to execute
or to direct the" execution of contracts
on behalf of the United States, to
make any contract or give any order j Ior ne oi tne uomo muraers, to pro
for the furnishing to the United States ceed to the scene of the explosion and
work, labor, services of materials, sup

tract or order Or if he or any firm of
which he is a member, or corporation,
joint stock company or association of
which he is an officer Or stockholder,
or in the pecuniary profits of which
he is directly or Indirectly interested,
shall be a party thereto.
Is Very Stringent
"Nor shall any agent or employe
make or permit any committee or oth
er body of which he is a member to
make or participate In making any
recommendations concerning such con
tract or order to any council, board of
commission of the United States, or j
any member Or subordinate thereof

House

Conference Is
Held Between
Ship Leaders
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 18. Members
of the shipping boafd and Maj. Gen.
Goethals, manager of the board's fleet
corporation, who are at odds over the
government's shipbuilding program, at
a lengthy conference today went over
the general's proposals for construct
ing government shipyards and for
speeding up tonnage now building.
Another Conference will be held to
morrow. The shipping board. Chair
man Den man said, wants more infor
mation before it approves the general
manager's plan, but General Goethals
said he thought he had submitted
most of the Information asked.
Look for Settlement
Neither side would say what are the
points of difference over the program.
Chairman Denman intimated that all !
disagreements would, be settled satis-1
factorily. !
The only question. It is understood,
on which the board and General Goe
thals are now far apart Is that 'of
wooden construction. Although Gen
eral Goethals has let contracts for!
many more wooden ships than he has
steel, the shipping board. It Is said,
will Insist that the type he intends to
build is too sio of 'construction.
Reports that General Goethals will
resign unless given the fullest author
ity to carry out the program he has
announced were discredited tonight.
The general said:
Virtually Under Order
"I am a soldier and a man 1 ntny
position appointed -to a place virtually
la under orders."
At the shipping board it was made
cleaf that there Is no intention to ask
General Goethals to quit.
SHOPMEN'S STRIKE AVERTED
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, July 18. Strike of 6000
shopmen employed by the Chicago,
kock lsiana racinc rauroau us
averted tonight by a conference at
which government representatives ap
pealed to the patriotism' of the union
men and officials of the road with the
result that virtually all the demands
on which the strike order was based
were granted. The shopmen asked
an eight-QOur day and an increase of
10 cents an hour in pay, which will
amount to approximately $1,500,000
annually. The demand for an eight
hour day was granted. A compromise
was affected on the wage question,
eight and a half cents going to the
machinists, seven cents to helpers and
seven cents to all the carmen.
German Reichstag
(By Review Leased Wire.)
With intense interest diverted for
the moment from the fighting fronts
where there have been a noticeable
slackening in hostilities, attention is
focused on the opening on Thursday
of the German reichstag.. At the op
ening session will be heard the first
utterances of the new imperial chan
cellor. Dr. George Michaelis, regarding
his war policies, which will be nat
urally momentous inasmuch as they
will indicate whether, with the recent
changes in the German government,
Germany is going to continue her war
fare without abatement or whether
the desires that have been heard so
often in Germany, especially in the
reichstag, are anything but empty ex
pressions. Unknown Quantity. r
The probable attitude of the chan
cellor alread yhas run the gamut of
diverse speculation, but as yet nothing
has been evolved fro mthe many ua
official discussions o fthe man and
his ideas and Intentions on which any
thing like certainty can be based.

indicated that the national lottery
to determine the order of liability
of ten million men registered for
military service could be held next
Friday.
Present plans are to hold the
lottery in the capitol, with the
members of the senate and house.,
military committees as witnesses.
The entire proceeding is not ex
pected to take much more than one
hour.
NEWSPAPERS HELP.
General Crowder conferred to
day with newspaper correspond
ents over arrangements for tlye
drawing. .The press is relied upon
to carry to individuals throughout
the country the information as to
when they will be required to ap
pear before the exemption boards
and for that reason every effort
Is being made to suit the conven
ience cf the papers as to details.
LISTS WILL BE LONG.
The task of transmitting the
long lists of numbers by telegraph
is a tremendous problem, but the
press association and telegraph
companies are making efforts to
insure both speed and absolute ac
curacy in transmission. . There is
more concern over the task of the
individual newspapers. ' In larger
communities, the problem of print
ing the serial numbers with the
names of the men they represent
is one of staggering proportions.
EANS ENORMOUS WORK.
In New York City, where there
are 189 of the 4,557 local exemp
tion districts, a list of the names
and numbers would fill several
hundred newspaper pages. Even
to give sufficient names and num
bers to cover those likely to be
called to the colors immediately
means enormous work.
MAY DRAFT ALIENS.
The problem ..of alien regis
trants other than enemy aliens,
came before the senate today in a
resolution introduced by Senator
Chamberlain, chairman of the mil
itary committee. It provides for
the drafting for military service of
citizens of countries at war with
Germany who now are residing in
the United States upon the same
terms as American citizens.
SOME EXCEPTIONS.
The resolution seeks to take
the views of the state department,
however, by excepting from its
action citizens of those countries
which have treaties with the Unit
ed States Prohibiting the enforced
military employment of the nation,
als of each party In the territory
of the other. There has been no
Indication whether It will have

dered 10 men and women and maimed
50 people because they were bent on
destroying the very government which
Lincoln preserved and defended and
for which he gave his life.
Against Sentimentalism
Fickert asked the jury to "cast away
all maudlin sentimentalities that have
been indulged in because the defend
ant is a woman."
"It is important that the death pen
alty for anarchy be issued out of this
court," he said. "The defendant is not
only condemned by the testimony of
disinterested witnessed but she is
damned by the perfidy of her anar
chistic co-conspirators."
Fickert said Mrs. Mooney's hand
bag contained "no innocent powder
puff but contained bullets." Books on
dynamite instead of books of child
hood and prayer were found in ber
apartment, said Fickert.
Was "Mrs. Surratt"
He declared Mrs. Mooney was the
"Mrs Surratt" of the-bomb conspiracy
and that she should pay the penalty
"for the blood that has been shed, as
Mrs. Surratt was made to pay the
penalty for the death of Lincoln."
Berkman at Head
"Alexander Eerkman was at the
head of this anarchistic conspiracy,"
said Fickert. He called Berkman the
arch-anarchist of the United States. In
the course of his argument Fickert
attacked the alibi testimony offered
by Mrs. Mooney, who as a witness in
her own defense recently described
her movements on the day of the bomb
explosion. The prosecutor said that
Mrs. Mooney and her husband, Thom
as J. Mooney, under sentence of death
for one of the bomb murders, could
have left their apartment at 1:25 j,.
m. or 1:30 p. m., deposited the suit
case at the scene of the explosion and
have returned to the roof of the build
ing in which they lived by 1:50 p. in.
The explosion occurred more than a
mile from the Mooney's apartments at
2.06 p. lu. An automobile traveling ut
the rate of 15 miles ac hour would
have taken the Mooncys from the
scene of the explosion to their resi
dence in four minutes, Fickert said.
Evidence Contradicted
"Reputable witnesses saw the Moon
eys and Billings at a point on Market
street about a mile from the scene of
the explosion," said Fickert. "Bil
lings was carrying a suitcase contain
ing the bomb at this point half an hour
before the explosion occurred.
"Other reputable witnesses saw a
suitcase on the sidewalk at the scene
of the explosion. It is folly for the
defense to claim the bomb was hurled
through the air. One witness saw
Billings place the suitcase."
"Blast" in Evidence
Robert Minor,, treasurer of the In
ternational Workers Defense league,
which has been active in Mrs, Moon
ey's defense, . testified as a rebuttal
state witness today that he had drawn
several cartoons for the Blast, the
publication of which Alexander Berk
man was the editor. Through the Blast
the state contended, the conspirators
spread their anarchistic propaganda.
Fickert declared in his argument
that Mirror was the paymaster of "The
Anarchistic Crew." Fickert will con
tinue his argument tomorrow and
Maxwell McXutt will open for the de
fense. It was expected tue case wili
reach the jury Saturday.

FIRST AID COURSES
, AT THE UNIVERSITY
Special Courses Offered Any
one by U. of A. During the
Succeeding Months All
Welcome.
Much interest bas' been excited in
all parts of the state by the announce-'
ment that the State Bureau of Mines!
is to conduct an intensive course in
First Aid Tra'ning on August 6. 7, and
S. vt te University of Arizona Cam-
i its, Tucson, j
T"it"re seems however, to be a mis
taken ii'ea that this course is onlyi
j.cn to those intending enlistment ,
-r those who have been drafted. The
rourse is open to everybody, although
't is given especially at this time to
-ccommodate the desire for such train
of those enlisting, and it is antici
pated that there will be a considerable,
"timber of miners taking the course
s well as many drafted men and nienl
"tanning to enroll in the Second Of-j

S. C. Dickinson .who is in charge of ;
the safety work of the Arizona State
Bureau of Mines, states that the j
course will be precisely the course I
which is given by the United States j
Bureau of Mines Rescue Cars and
which entitles those receiving train
ing to the government certificate for
proficiency in First Aid. It is possible
that arrangements will be made to
have the government certificate issued

if this is not possible a state certifi
cate will be issued.

GLAD TIDINGS FROM BOSTON.
Vnder the heading, "The Bisbee Teaparty," the Bos
ton Transcript prints an editorial on the Bisbee drive ol
the wobblies that rings, fine and true, from Plymouth
Rock clear to the Mule Mountains. This word from Bos
ton, printed elsewhere in this issue, warms the cockles
of our heart. It makes our eyes shine and our cheeks
glow. There is no mincing of words, no mere platitudes,
it is the western language spoken in a manly voice.
When Boston applies the title of her beloved and
cherished and immortal tea party to the efforts of the
youngest state to rid herself of foreign tyranny, then is
our effort given standing before the world. Our blow i
perpetuated. It is not an event, it is history.
Massachusetts, one of the original thirteen states,
grown old in glorious deeds, whose hand has always been
the first raised to strike in a righteous cause, calls in a
loud voice across the mountains and the plains and the
far-flung distances, to iier sister in the west and bids
her kneel to be crowned for a courage that did not count
the cost. Massachusetts longs to honor that breed of
men who do and dare.
Always will we remember the word from the de
scendants of the men of Lexington. The Review, the
morning after the drive, compared our brave citizens witi
Gen. Warren's heroes who arose over night with gun in
hand to strike for the right, for our men were minute
men, too. '
It is a long. long ways from Boston Bay to this sun
kissed valley, but the American spirit of patriotism came
to us from there fresh and strong. Bisbee knows, and
Bisbee understands, and she will always remember.
Bisbee has a right to be proud of the many things she
has accomplished as a progressive, modern, public-spirited
city, but there is one blemish still on her shield. Her
reputation for gallantry is at stake. The chivalry of the
south wesf i3 open to attack all because of her laxness in
a most important matter. Our fair school mistresses are
the plaintiffs in this case. Consider, gentlemen of the
chamber of commerce and the school board, these young
women reside in Bisbee wherever they can get a room
and rooms are scarce in this fast-growing place, yon
know. Then they must take the street cars to go to their
school rooms in Don Luis and Lowell and Tintown and
Jiggerville. The cars help, but they do not carry these
school ma'ams to their destination. They must still walk
quite a distance. "They should be taken to and from
thoir fu-hnnla in & car" declares one gallant citizen of
Bisbee. "The school board lias a car that could be rigged
up for this worthy purpose," he argues, "and it should
be done, or we should hide our heads in shame. I met
three of these teachers last evening coming from their
summer school "work and they were fagged out from
their long tramp."
Sheriff Harry Wheeler is becoming famous the coun
try over as a result of the part he played in leading the
famous drive on the I. W. W, industry wreckers July 12
And the fine part of it is, the brave but modest little
sheriff is worthy of all the praise and all the nice things
that are being said about him. He just positively won't
swell up over this "hero" business. Every day since the
big drive has found him busily engaged in cleaning up
the little sharks that escaped the neL To reap the best
and full results from the clean-up it is necessary to main
tain vigilance, and the sheriff knows this, and he is work
ing just as hard and as thoroughly on the prosaic task
as he did when in the spotlight of the nation's eye. Many
men win the name of heroes but few of them bear their
blushing honors fcp modestly and so worthily as our
sheriff.
The sixteen suffragettes who were sent to jail for
sixty days might well have employed their energies and
talrnts to much better advantage than patrolling the
white house grounds these days of war. Red Cross work
would have reflected more credit upon them. Their acts
smack strongly of the grandstand and seeking of no
toriety. This picket lino injures, not helps their caus
in the eyes of most people. They will pose as martyr
now, but they will excite more ridicule than either pit
or admiration.
THE COMMON LAW THE PEOPLE'S WILL.
Writing to the Douglas International, W. P. Miller
presents the following masterly review and endorsement
of the deportation of the I. W. W. agitators by Bisbee
citizens. July 12: B.
In addition to nonsensical articles emanating from
so-called labor leaders, concerning the alleged "outrage"
perpetrated by and in the deportation of lawless men
from Arizona, there now appears in the El Paso Morn
ing Times, issue of the 16th inst., the farcical and idle
announcement of the intention of the exiles to bring suit
against divers persons to recover damages. Any truthful
complaint that it is possible to frame in behalf of these
men could not possibly state any cause of action. If, how
ever, by concealing the true fact, a cause of action could
be stated, the answer Of the defendants, susceptible of
undeniable and overwhelming proof, would undoubtedly
defeat any such action.
Inasmuch as there are people, otherwise generally
well informed, who seem to doubt the legality of the
deportation of these lawless exiles, I deem it advisable
and timely to make this statement of the law governing
the matter involved in such deportation.
Facts.
In order to understand and judge of this matter, it is
necessary to have a clear conception of the facts involved.
The indisputable facts, which led up to and caused
the people of the county to deport these men was that
they were, each and all, members of a widespread con
spiracy to bring about a shutdown of mines of Bisbee,
and incidentally of the bmelters of Douglas, in order to
try to enforce their demands upon the mine owners of
Bisbee.
That as overt acts in pursuit of said conspiracy, they
bad assaulted, abused, and in many ways intimidated,
law abiding workmen and employes of the mining com
panies.
Threats had also been made to immediately wreck
and destroy mining property.
The Law.
Each member of such an unlawful conspiracy is fully
liable under the law for any and all acts of his co-conspirators,
done in pursuance of the common intent.
The common intent here was to prevent the working
of these mines.
There was no plain, speedy, adequate remedy for
this condition of affairs, open to the aggrieved public,
through or by the process of our statutory courts.
What law then authorized the action?
It was fully authorized by the common law.
The lex non scripts, or the unwritting law, called
also the common law, is a heritage and legacy from our
colonial ancestors, who brought with them and incorpo
rated into our law, the common law of England.
In this state this common law is expressly adopted,
so far as it is consistent with our conditions, and not in
consistent with our statute law.
The common law is founded on general customs,
among other things.
A general custom is one which has existed so long
that the memory of man runneth not to the contrary, says
that law writer, Blackstone.
So any custom that is immemorial is law.
It is the immemorial custom of all nations and peo
ples to meet any threatened public peril, internal or ex
ternal, with such measures as the matter seemingly demands.
The people of the United States, and those of any
state, have a perfect legal right, under the common law.
to abort, prevent and frustrate any and all such unlaw
ful conspiracies as was involved in the activities of the
so-called strikers, and their co-conspirators.
Such activities constituted such an unlawful menace.
and danger, not only to the people of Cochise county,
but to the national welfare, that it was the duty of all
law-abiding tnen to put these lawless men out of action
by whatever means was necessary.
It is the same law under which the militia is fre
quently called upon to put down lawless bodies of so-
called strikers, who engage in lawless methods to accom
plish what may be some proper and just demand.
It would be idle and ineffective to try' the ordinary
process of the courts to remedy such a situation as con
fronted the people of the county from the actions of these
men who were deported.
To deny to any sovereignty the right to protect itself,
except through its established courts, would be to deny
it the benefit of the law.
There are and always have been remedies for wrongs
by operation of law. and by act of the party wronged.
Of course these violators of law. and their sympa
thisers, cry out against what they call an outrage.
The only outrage that is truly involved in the matter
is the treason and outrage against the nation and state.
The Highest Court In the State.
The highest court in this state is the will of the
nonni in this nr thpKp acitators were tried, and
t'wp.v.. - -
convicted.
The penalty inflicted upon these men will be a good
lesson for all men who are disposed to enforce their de
mands upon others, regardless of the rights and interests
of others, including the public.
all mn do not recocnize the enormity of
the offense against the nation, which these lawless men
were engaged in.
"Every person owing allegiance to the United States
who levies war against them, or adheres to their enemies,
giving them aid and comfort wtlhin the United States or
elsewhere, is guilty of treason." Sec. 5331 Rev. Stat.
U. S. ' '
Nothing within the power of these lawless men could
give greater aid and comfort to the war mad enemies
of the United States than the crippling of industrial
power of the touutry.

Carson Leaves as
Head of Admiralty
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, July IS. Sir Edward
Carson has relinquished his post as
first lord of the admiralty and joined
the war cabinet without portfolio, ac
cording to an official announcement ajf
new ministerial appointments issued
this evening. Sir Edward will be suc
ceeded by Sir Eric Campbell Geddes,
who has been director general of muni
tions supply.
Winston Spencer Churchill succeeds
Dr. Christopher Addison as minister of
munitions. Dr. Addison bediming a
minister without portfolio in charge
of industrial production.
Baron Montague of Beaulieu Is made
secretary for India.
The new cabinet appointments aris
ing out 'of the resignation of Lord
Chamberlain as secretary for India
and Andrew Bonar Law's desire to be
relieved of bis duties as a member of
the war cabinet contained two com
plete surprises the appointment
Sir Eric Geddes.as head of the ad
miralty and Winston Spencer Church
ill as minister of munitions.
Much controvers yhas revolved for
a Ion gtime past over the name of Mr.
Churchill. His appointment as min
ister of munitions undoubtedly will
lead to a revival of that agitation.
The appointment of Sir Eric Geddes
as first lord of the admiralty is an
other break with the tradition that the
ministers should be members of one
of the legislative houses. The new
first lord is a railwa yman, not a poli
tician. Until recently ' he was in
charge of army transportation, then he
became controller of admiralty with
charge of all naval construction. The
appointment of Sir Edward Carson to
replace Mr. Bonar Law as the fifth
member of the war cabinet Is likely to
create more uneasiness and stronger
criticism among the older Liberals
than any other appointment.

Artist Tries to
Suicide 3 Times
(By Review Leased Wire.)
AMSTERDAM, July IS. A Prague
newspaper relates the sad story of an
artist there who found it impossible
to kill himself with poison or a rope,
and was only able to shuffle off thi?
mortal coil finally by eating a restau
rant stew. The newspaper's account
of the tragedy is as follows:
"Tired of life at 42, the artist pro
cured a portion of a violent poison
and tried to poison himself with it.
In vain he awaited a fatal effect, and
on the following day had the remains
of the vial analyzed. It was a 'war
substitute' poison. He then procured
a rope ana nangea nimseu, dui uie
rope was made of paper pulp, and it
broke. The two-fold failure of his at
tempt at suicide the man regarded as
a sign of fate, and a fresh joy in life
inspired him. Proceeding to a certain
well known restaurant, he ordered and
consumed an alleged meat stew, it
was a 'war substitute' stew, and two
hours later he was dead."

Eugene Brady O'Neil, old time Ari-:

otherwise serv ed the people of the
state faithfully and well, died from a ;
wound, self inflicted, in We.stlake
park, Los Angeles, last Sunday. Mr.
O'Neil had been ill for some time and
feared that he was becoming insane.
The tragedy occurred in one of the
most fashionable residence sections of
Los Angeles. He was sitUns in the
park and was noticed fo be writing by
several people who passed. Shortly
afterward some people heard a report
of a gun. O'Neil was dead before they
reached him, having turned the pistol :
against his head.
He left the following letter to his
wife, Mrs. Pauline O'Neil. one of the
leading women in the state of Arizona:
"Dear Polly: Forgive me for I am
afraid I am going crazy, and I would
rather be dead- than crazy. Good-bye
and forgive me. Pray for me. Bury (

They were engaged in a conspiracy

crime.
Continue to summarily put down all
acts tending or calculated to give aid
ami comfort to the enemies of the
country. If you wait for the courts o
act, the mischief will probably be
done before the courts could possibly
act. Don't feel doubtful about your

The courts of this state, and of the

IN LEAGUE WITH
ENEMIES OF U. S.
(Skilling's Mining Review)
Dispatch from Lkmver quotes Chas.
II. Moyer, head of the International
Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter
Workers, as charging the I. W. W.
with participation in a nation-wide
conspiracy to close tfle copper mines
ot the United States. The I. W. W.
he says, njw have plenty of money,
whereas but a short time ago they
were not plentifully supplied. Mr,
Moyer leaves the natural inference !
that this money has been supplied by
enemies of tbe United States and
that the I. W. W. are the pliant tools
of traitors. "
The I. W. W. never have even pre
tended to be friends of the Stars and
Stripes. Always they have been op- j realize the danger or even the signifi

OFTHELW. W.
(Arizona Republican, Phoenix.)
It may be predicted that the present
week will witness a change for the
better in industrial conditions in Ari
zona mining camps. The drastic action
taken at Bisbee, preceded by similar
but less comprehensive action at
Jerome and Mohave mining camps has ;
broken, we believe, the power of the
L W. W. in this state. The uprising
in tnese places-nas orougm iorciDiy.j
ana mayDe unpleasantly, to me ieaerai
authorises the fact that the federal
government is responsible for the
preservation of order. The reported
movements of troops to various points,
we think, will be followed by an ad-
justment of such differences as exist
between the mining companies and
those w ho really want to work.
There would perhaps have been
strikes in some of the mines if there
had been no I. W. W., but they could
have been easily settled. The fact is,
the I. W. W. have never wanted a
settlement, even a temporary one, on
any basis to which the mining com
panies could have been brought. And
:ny settlement with them could have
been at best only temporary. Though
the L W. W. leaders talked of higher
wages and improved working condi
tions as terms for ending the strike,
clainped an embargo upon exports, has
summoned all industry to the work of
war and set herself either to crush and
overwhelm Germany, or, with the rest
of democracies, to be Prussianized like
Belgium and northern France by the
godless hosts of the War Lord. '
But on our own soil is an enemy,
swearing by oft-repeated oaths to per
petuate all the destruction that vio
lence can wreck, preaching revolution
and invoking anarchy; yet our govern
ment has taken no official recognition
of these villians. the I. W. W.'s. Our
soldiers are in France, our engineers
in Russia, our sailors in hourly peril
stand guard tm the North Sea, and hun
dreds of thousands are training and
millions are waiting to go, and fight
win die. But from Butte to Bisbee.
from Seattle to Leadville, that inter
national organization filled with for-
signers, officered by convicts, and at-
tempting vaguely to guise its sabotage
behind lhe upecious title of "Industrial
Workers of the World," is in open
warfare against our government; and
as yet no stern measures have be
tokened that our American leaders
The I. W. W.'s have a long and vi
cious record. They are committed by
the only oath that ever kept to indus
trial violence. Their agitators are for
Lhe most part foreigners; and the hat
red towards our government may be
traced In many of them to jail sen
tences following such indiscretions as
theft and burglary. Within the past
they have stirred up strikes in the
mining UiMriets of Arizona and Mon
tana; and thty are now busily pre
paring trouble in Colorado and in the

VIPERS
THAT
WE NOURISH
(New York World)
The organization known as the In
dustrial Workers of the World is avow
edly lawless. It openly advocates vio
lence against individuals and rebellion
against government. Some of its lead
ers have preached murder and arson
as legitimate methods of agitation.
Three years ago last April its found
er, one Hayward, notified the presi-
aeni oi toe united states tnat if our
Mexican complications resulted in
war he would order a strike which
would paralyze the national authority.
Nearly all municipalities and states
have proved themselves powerless to
to promote rebellion and crime in the
United States, and evidence of that
purpose is to be seen on every hand.
what reason is there to doubt that the
terrorism established by the I. W. W.
at the copper mines is flagrantly rea-
sonable.
Free government does not mean no
government. We have nourished in
this case a nest of vipers and the en
emy has taken advantage of our folly
as any enemy was bound IV do.

It is a fact tbe president is doing
everything in his. power for Arizona
in this crisis; as soVn as asked be sent
troops to Globe. Now the president is
taking care of the deported I. W. W.'s
so they cannot eo back and bother

Bill Cleary. It is safe to say the presi
dent is doing just as much as any 'oth
er man could do under the circum
stances. Most people know the presi
dent has considerable outside of
Arizona to look after and direct these
days. The matter of preparing & few
million men tvr the battlef ront
in
trance is no sniau matter.
Not hav-
ing any particular law with which to
handle all of the strikes, made pos
sible by such people as Haywood,
Mother Jones, Emma Goldman, Hunt
and Moyer, he is simply , doing the
very best which can possibly be done.
In 'our opinion the president will find
a way to take care of tne undesirables
as fast as they are run out of tbe differ
ent mining camps and other places
where trouble is started. The people
of Arizona owe the president a great
debt of gratitude for his prompt action
in these matters.

The deportation of I. W. W. follow

shown their hand.
And in our own copper country
citizens are no less determined in op

COCHISE SHERIFF
ON RIGHT TRACK
(New York Times)
The secretary-treasurer of the I. W.
W. vehemently denies that "German
influence and German money were be
hind the copper mine strikes" in Ari
zona, Montana and elsewhere in the
west. The "movement" of these gentle
souls is "simply an efl'ort to get liv

that they condescend IV) work at all.
Further west, in half a dozen states,
they are truer to the I. W. W gospel.
They are roaming about in bands mak

THE BISBEE SYSTEM
(Duluth, Minn., Herald)
There is Vine thing, at least, that
commends the Bisbee plan of dealing
with tbe I. W. W. menace it works,
at least so far as the town that uses
it is concerned.
Bisbee, apparently, was a prosper
ous mining town full of busy mines and
smelters and well paid and contented
workers. Entered then the I. W. ,
engaged in a peculiar business of shut
ting down mines ail over the country.
wherever it can reach them, that are
putting out products vitally needed by
a nation at war.
These agents of disorder and idle
ness and violence and deprivation did
not wear spiked helmets and iron
crosses, but perhaps that is because
it was considered indiscreet to do so.
Bisbee Contemplated the spectacle
thoughtfully for a day or two. Then,
one, morning, 1500 of :;s turners, mer
chants and professional men turned
out, armed and officially deputized
herded together tbe carriers of the red
ticket and the firebrand, marched
them into cattle cars and sent them
on their way.
There is another p'jint in this inter
esting incident; it teaches the alien
disturbers who constitute tue I. W. W.
and who are doing some of the work
of the kaiser in America, a valuable
lesson in geography. It teaches them
that the west, one-time home of the
Vigilantes, is not to be trifled with.
I. W. W. ANARCHISTS.
(Albuquerque Journal)
Outraged citizens of Bisbee, Ariz.,
deported about 1200 members of that
professedly lawless organization
known as the Industrial Workers ot
the World. The unfortunate part of
it all is that the deported people were
dumped into New Mexico.
The I. W. W. organization has long
made a specialty of trying to Insult
the American flag. The members pro
fess Imposition to all law. They
seize other people's property as though
it were their own. They board trains
in numbers large enough to overawe
the trainmen and go where they please.
Not infrequently 40 or T.O of them en
ter a restaurant, cat all the food Vn
hand and refuse payment. When
strong enough they resist officers or
the law, and on several occasions they
have killed policemen and deputy
sheriffs.
But when citizens, as in San Dieeo
some years ano and in Bisbee a few
days ago, take the law into their jn
hands, then the Industrial Workers in
stead of being game, whine and
cringe and appeal to the president of I
the United States for protection under!

with horse and cattle thieves, bandits

greatly for moisture, seemed to be a
source of much uneasiness on the part
of scattered shorts.
Oats were governed by the action
of corn.
Provisions lacked support The
main reason was a decline in hog
quotations.
factor was the unsatisfactory events
in Russia where dissention in the cab
inet exists. This naturally fostered
apprehension over conditions in that
country and helped somewhat the late
selling movement. Another report in
circulation was to the effect that .the
new German chancellor would make
a new peace proposal In the reichstag
along the lines of no annexation, or in
demnity. The heavy short covering
of the past two days has removed a
sustaining buying power and In as

NEW YORK MARKETS.
NEW YORK? July 18. The super
ficial character of prevailing stock
market conditions was strikingly illus
trated today when the shorts resum
ed their attacks upon the more sus
ceptible stocks in a fairly successful
effort to depress the entire list;
St. Paul was the main objective, de
clining 5 points to 67. Other divi
dend paying rails yielded 1 to 2 points
with no appreciable recoveries.
Motors also claimed the attention of
prpfessional traders, the Maxwell
group, falling one to five points. Re
versals otherwise were confined to
some of the oils, minor .equipments
and specialties, with gross recessions
of one to three points. The few fea
tures of strength were limited to
stocks of little potential value as
market leaders, these including the
various issues which derive their ch'ef
support from pools. United States
steel's course was typical of that fol
lowed by other stocks. Steel sold up
to 122 and closed at 120, a net
loss of 1 points. ' '
Total sales amounted to 640.000
shares.
Rubles dropped to the new mini
mum of 21. Renewal of call loans
at 6 per cent, although the rat sub
sequently dropped to 3, offered little
hope of immediate relaxation in local
monetary conditions.
The strength of Denver and Rio
Grand refunding 5's was the feature '
of the irregular bond market. The
Liberty Issue ranged from 99.41 to
99 :45H Total sales of bonds, par value,
aggregated $2,680,000.
United States coupon and registered
3's declined per cent on call.
COTTON.
NEW YORK, July 18. The cotton
market today closed Irregular with
prices 9 to 12 points net higher.
NEW YORK. July 18. The tone of
the day was one of firmness due in
great part to a desire on the part of
Eborts to further reduce outstanding
commitments and buying in reaction
theory. Outside buying however,
could not be stimulated and this de
spite the highly favorable showing of
the Republic Steel company in the sec
end quarter of the current year. An
unsettling influence in the late trad
ing wjbs the conspicuous weakness in
St Paul liquidation in this particular
issue being induced by the fears that
that company's annual dividend meet
ing scheduled for next week on' the
disbursement of the common stock
way be reduced. Another disturbing

Baron Moncheur Speaks
They were welcomed Into Denver by
a special trainload of citizens, who
greeted tiiui 20 miles out on the road.
Tonight Baron Moncheur addressed a
large audience here, telling them of
the distress that war had brought in
Belgium and relief that had been giv
en by the people of the United States.
"Our people have faced ffcirvatlon."
: he said, "but life is not so dear nor
1 peace so sweet as to be purchased at
! the price of chains and slavery.
Germany Treacherous
! "Germany first attacked us treaoh
j erously, then she massacred thousands
j of our peaceful civilian population;
1 tnen she turned, pillaged and robbed
.' our country and finally she has sought
to enslave our entire population. .
! "The , German authorities, with
their usual cold cruelty, have attempt
ed to carry out their plan by force.
In cities, towns and villages men
were dragged from their homes by the
German soldiery, thrown Into cattle
cars and shipped like animals info Ger
many or sometimes to points imme
diately behind the German trenches
where they were exposed to the shell
fire of the Belgian army. .
Old Glory Uplifting
"You are sending your brave boys
to fight shoulder to shoulder with the
troops tf the allies. You will deliver
those of our workmen who still remain
in bondage; you will restore Belgium
to her own; you will put an end to
military autocracy. The sight of Old
Glory upton the battlefields of Europe
has uplifted the hearts of our troops
and has stricken the kaiser with ter
ror. "Your men are in for a fight to a
finish but you will never stop until
you finish it right."

REFERENDUM, FAILS.
.According to advices received from
Phoenix a permanent injunction has
been granted by Judge Stanford of
Maricopa against putting the woman's
' wate law on the ballot at the next
general election and as a consequence
the law will become operative as sc'on
as the papers have been signed. It
makes the minimum wage for women
in the state of Arizona $10 per week-
JURORS EXCUSED.
The local officers yesterday receiv
ed word from Tombstore to the efTect
that all trial jurors who had been ex
cused until Judy 30 and those who
had reecntly been summoned to be
there, have been excused for the term.
On account of tae smallp'jx scare in
Tombstone there is no telling at just
what time the court will reconvene
and an order was made excusing the
jurors from further service.
TO STUDY CHILD LABOR LAW.
G. H. Bolin, state mine inspector,
formerly of Bisbee, was Tuesday ap
pointed by Governor Campbell to at
tend a meeting with W. B. Wilson,
secretary of labor, and other mine in
spectors and factory agents for the
purpose of studying the best means to
enforce the child labor law which be
comes effective throughout the nation
September 1.' The meeting will be
held at Washington, July 27.
DEFENDS ATTORNEY'S ACTION.
Concerning the detention and sub
sequent release of James Corveves, a
Greek, recently, who made defama
tory remarks about the government,
about which the Review printed an
article at the time alleging neglect up
on the part of the U. S. attorney's of
fice, Gerald Jones, assistant U. S. at
torney, makes a statement. Mr. Jones
declares that his office did not neg
lect this particular case and states
that there is absolutely no federal
statute under which aliens can be pros
ecuted for defamatory statements un
less -they be aliens of a country with
which the Vnited States is at war, as
ia the Ase of Germany. Mr. Jones
further states that upon investigation
of this particular case it developed
that there was no witness who would
swear directly to having heard the re
marks alleged to have been made by
the Kreek. He urged prosecution un
' der the act of opposition to the draft,
1 hut there was no evidence in this mat
ter, so the man had to be released. It
' seems that, under the circumstances,
: the U. S. attorney's office was not neg
ligent in this matter. Then, too, Mr.
Flynn has been tied up at Globe with
I the strike situation for the past sev-
cral days and has about all one at-
torney can attend to there.

A further step In testing the consti
tutionality of the employers' liability
law now in effect in Arizona was made
Tuesday afternoon when the Inspira
tion mine and the Superior & Pitts
burg filed in the supreme court at
Phoenix a motion for rehearing. The
cases in question Involve damages
awarded employes under the employ
ers 'liability law, which places all re
sponsibility on the owner when a man
Is killed in a mine. On appeal the su
preme court affirmed the judgment of
the Power court. The supreme court
as a rule doesnot grant reliearings,
the exception proving the rule. In
view of this fact it is believed that the
mines are preparing to take the case
to the United States supreme court iu
a last effort to test the constitution
ality of the employes' liability law.
DRAFT VIOLATIONS.
Seven men. charged with violating
the selective draft act were arrang- j
ed today before V. S. Commissioner ;
E. F. Jones at Tucson. Four were 1
charged with registering as aliens
when they were In reality citizens. 1
two were charged with failure to reg- j
ister, and one with inciting others to
violate the act by refusing to register.
MUST SHOW CARD.
All persons wh'o registered for the
selective draft on June 5 are request
ed to have their registration cards
in their possession at all times so toey
may be able to snow them toi the pro
per officials if asked to do so. By car
rying your registration card ou will
save yourself and the officers a great
deal oft inconvenience. Inability to
show a card will be sufficient reason
for arrest, so you are advised to gov-
j ern yourself accordingly.
