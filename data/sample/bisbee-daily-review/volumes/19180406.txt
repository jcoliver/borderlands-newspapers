FRANCE, April 5. (By the Associat-1
ed Press.) Hard fighting was pro-j
ceeding north and south of Albert as
the result of a heavy attack by the J
Germans on the British lines along a !
front of 9000 yards between Aveluy j
and Dernancourt.
According to the latest reports, the
Germans had succeeded in getting a
foothold on a small triangular bit of
territory southwest of Albert which '
brought the attacking, troops close to
the Albert-Amiens railway. ,
About the time of the assault de-;
livered against the British on the AI-:
bert sector the Germans also sent,
strong forces against the defenses 1
north of Ablainzeville. This offensive
move was short lived, however, for the j
British threw the enemy back with i
heavy losses.
It is believed that the German op-!
erations about Albert was undertaken j
mainly for the purpose of getting hold
or the railway running southwest to ,
Amiens, but that it had the additional .
object of straightening 'the enemy's j
lines in this zone. )
The attack was launched at & j
o'clock after an intense bombardment
of the defending position. Six enemy 9
divisions were employed In the early,
hours of the fighting, which was ex-
ceedingly bitter. North of Albert the!
British clung tenaeiously to their line, I
but just to the south the Germans i
pivoted out from Albert and swung
their front westward from Dernan
court until it reached the railway on
which the defenders were making a
gallant stand. '
Both these attacks today, and those
delivered below the Somme yesterday, j
appear to have been merely forerun-j

that a conversation concerning
peace had been held between Austria-Hungary

whether and on what basis a dis

about of a general peace would be
possible between the foreign min

Thereupon Count Revertata, af

Count Czernin was prepared for a

to hold a conversation with the
prospect of success as soon as
France renounced its plan fOf the

Revertata received a reply in the
name of M. Clemenceau to the
effect that the latter was not in
a position to accept the proposed
renunciation by France of this dis

A conscientious clairvoyant, th
bright star of hla profession! H
possesses the Secret Power of recot
structing unhappy domestic affair
and making the home happy; of gain
ing the one you wish in marriage; ol

PROFESSOR JERRELL
The acknowledged adept and recog
nized authority on Hindoo Philosophy
and Occult Mysteries makes a re-'
marliahln statement: "Your weatest
wish can be realized you would not desire a imug u you were not capable of
obtaining it" .
He knows how to control and use that power for your success and his. ir
you wish to succeed in any business undertaking, consult him. He can put you
on the right road. . I '
If you desire to win love, or be reunited with one from whom some
trouble or estrangement separates you, he can and will help you to gain the
desire of your heart
Are you tired of being poor and living "froni'hand-to-niouth existence?
If so, go to him and he will show you a better way.
Life is not half as much of a mystery as some people would have you
believe. If you had studied more in Nature's laws and learned the lessons
thwre revealed, you would know better why some people succeed and others
fail. There is a good reason just the same as there is a reason why water
will run down hill more easily than it will run up hill. He can explain that
reason to you. He is successful himself. He does not make this claim in the
spirit of a braggart or egotist, but to enable you to appreciate what he can
do for you.
His extensive patronage and great success are the envy of all competi
tors. He is never idle; his motto is "Work and Win." He helps bis patrons
to succeed in attaining their various ambitions. That is why he has so many
of them and 'by each, one recommends him to their friends.
The all-wise Creator did not endow you with high ideals, noble inspira
tions, desire for happiness and return for that great love craving within your
heart without at the same time placing within your reach the means of at
taining these desires. If you are in' trouble of any kind, or not satisfied with
yc.ur condition in life, go to him and he will make this clear to you. He has
helped others; he can help you, positively.
LOVE.
Do you want to marry soon? Then go and see hira. He will gain for you
anyone whom you choose, even if there are thousands of miles between you.
CLAIRVOYANT POWERS.
Do you wish to possess the key to the spirit friends or to be a clairvoy
ant? Then go to him; he will prepare you for business or develop your gift
and in a short time. You owe it to yourself to Investigate the powers of this
miraculous man. You have everything to gain and nothing to lose. Will you
not allow him to help you?
Are you unhappy? Are you unfortunate? Are your adverse fates pursu
ing you?
Would you speculate? Would you enter business? Would you mine?
Would you know if friends are true? Would you know if enemies pursue?
Would you know what they would do? ;
His readings are guides to Health, Wealth and Happiness. He will toll
you whet the future has in store for you.
He will tell you whether you should engage in any line of business.
He will tell you whether your personality or another's will control your
fate.
Has your wife or husband grown cold?
He will reveal to you the cause of that coldness.
He can help you. Won't you receive his assistance? No matter what
grief Is being harbored in the recesses of your heart, he can assuage it and
calm your turbulent fears by the exercise of his divinely-inspired gifts.
Consult him and let the fires of ambition blaze once, again in your heart
kindled by his words which he will speak out of knowledge. You cannot
afford to be without the assistance which this wonderful man of marvelous
powers can give.
If you are in trouble or your future is uncertain, consult him today.
Perhaps It would be too late TOMORROW.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. April 5. The stock :
market was at virtually a standstill :
during the greater part of today's Res-'
tkra, exceeding all previous days of an 1
abnormally bull week in its unparal
leled apathy. Total pales amounted to .
145.0i0 shares, the low record since
August 1916. Resumption of the C.er-,
man drive ia France accounted for the j
further cessation of operations.
Declines of a point anions invest-
mcnts shares and as much as two :
points in a few specialties re-mlted j
livim sheer indifference or inertia. '1
The decision of the Interstate Com
merce commission to inquire into pe
troleum freight rates and institute' a
physical valuation of various tele
prapli and cable companies caused
scarcely a ripple among the shares of
the properties most concerned.
More time funds were available at
the long- prevailing six per cent rate,
but the immediate future of the money
market hinges largely upon require
ments incidental to the third liberty
loan.
Liberty issues again furnished an
(overwhelming quota to the day's deal
ings in bonds at slight fractional re
cessions. International Issues were
variable, French municipals hardening.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
J.V-'ufl.O'iO.
United States bonds, old issues, were
unchanged on call.

My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... I gained, and was well
and strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
athers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
ailments so common to women, why not
jive Cardui a trial? Recommended by
many physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

Its Lesson
One thing the recent German offensive
has taught the allies, and which they will
surely use against Germany some day, is,
that the deadlock of trench warfare can be
broken, if only one side can muster enough
men and guns for the blow. Fortunately
Germany did not have enough men and
guns to get clear through, but with what
she had she forced the line back over
twenty miles and fought in the open for
days at a time.
The lesson of this offensive should come
to America stronger than any other allied
nation. For upon America the allies de
pend for just that preponderance of men
and guns necessary to break this deadlock
once and for all. When America's full
strength is placed in the field no German
power can withstand it if launched and di
rected' by General Foch.
Consider, if you can, an allied offensive
upon twice the scale of the German ad
vance in Picardy, with three times the re
serves. Well, that 13 just what the allies
should be able to launch by this time next
year if America carries out her present pro
gram of shipbuilding and munition making
and airplaine construction and draft and
training camp activities.
And Germany knows it. Hence the big
gamble in Picardy.
The German lines will not stand the
strain the - allies have successfully with
stood west of La Fere. A twenty-five-mile
bend in the German line3 will mean a
break or a big retirement.
Let us, then, take this lesson of the last
offensive, and consequent fighting in the
open, home and profit by it. We must
work harder and faster, and with more de
votion and self-sacrifice, seek by every
means to aid in the great task of making
this country ready to do her full part in the
war. The Prussian is fighting against time
against the day when America shall be
ready. Aare you doing your all to hasten
that day?
THE SAME, THEN, NOW, AND
FOREVER!
Over two thousand years ago Julius
Caesar, in his Commentaries, wrote of the
Hun:
"From a national point of view they
deem it a credit to devastate the widest pos
sible area of territory outside their borders;
they consider that by this is signified the
great number of states which are unable to
resist their power. Thus about six hundred
miles of country adjoining the Suebi are
said to lie waste."
A few weeks ago, a special correspon
dent wrote as follows in the Berlin An
zeiger, concerning the alleged exploits of
his countrymen, the Huns:
"During these last weeks great stretches
of French territory have been transformed
by us into a dead country. No village or
farm was left standing on this glacis, no
road was left passable, no railway track or
embankment was left in existence. In front
of our new position runs, like a gigantic rib
bon, a realm of death.
Austria, always a perfidious country,
never in all her long and shameful career,
stood in a worse light than that in which
she now stands. She preaches peace with
bloody hands. She prates of her ideals and
unselfishness and yet slyly and silently
moves in to reap in Russia where Germany
ha3 sown. Germany is a beast; Austria
is contemptible. Germany is a tiger;
Austria is the jackal that that lurks at the
Hun's heels. Austrian statesmen mislead
their people with protestations of honesty
and single purpose while Austrian gener
als lead their troops into a despoiled land.
Austrian artillery is taking part in the
great drive in the west. Austrian troops
are massing on the Balkan front and
against Italy. Austria's hands curve like
claws even while Czemin's words flow
forth in the form of a smoke screen. Ger
many inspires our hatred; Austria we de
spise. Her course during the past three
months brands her as the willing and com
placent tool of Berlin in all things. As
soon -is hi3 peace speech at Vienna had
been made Czernin hurried to Berlin for
the kaiser's commendations and congratu
lations. But he deceived no one but his
own poor and misguided people. The al
lies are not even talking peace now. They
are in the field for a finish fight, and Czer
nin's words fell only upon Teutonic ears.
THE DAY OF DAYS.
With the allies at bay in what may well
be the cruical battle of the Great War, to
day also usher3 in with a glorious rush of
patriotism the drive in America for the
third Liberty loan of three billion dollars.
Not since the da3's of the first Continental
congress has there been such a call in this
country for sacrifice in the interest of a
great national stress and peril. Today also
marks the end of our first year of thewar.
April 6 is a momentous date in American
history. Late dispatches last night indi
cated also that the date of April 6 of this
year would be a glorious date. It also wit
nesses the German power at its zenith.
What will April 6 of next year witness of
German power? Its rise or fall depends as
much upon the efforts behind the allied
lines as upon the willing sacrifice of our
soldiers in the field.
While the world is waiting, tense with
eager expectancy, for the allies to strike
back at the advancing Hun, it might be
well to consider something of the character
and thought of Gen. Ferdinand Foch, who
holds in his hand this thunderbolt. For
tunately, General Foch has set down his
thoughts and ideas up on paper. In his
book, "The Conduct of War," which i3 a
textbook on war the world over, Foch says :
"There are not two theories or two schools.
There is only one. There can be only one
the theory and the school of good sense.
In certain cases good sense requires attack
at all costs; in others, good sense demands
defense to the last minute." These words
were written years ago, and today finds
the author, with five million soldiers under
Us command, facing the alternative cf
whether to attack or continue the defense.
When will he strike, asks the world ? And
Foch wrote the answer long ago. "When
good sense requires it." Good sense! The
finest guide for man or general, the world
over. Be sure Foch will strike when the
time is ripe. This column pins its faith to
Foch, the greatest general and fighter of
them all.
In the city election held this week in
Phoenix much the same state of affairs
prevailed we face here in the Warren dis
trict with our city election only a few
weeks distant. The more radical of the
labor element, the Hunt following and the
wobblies, all fought the re-election of Peter
Corpstein, the present capable and fearless
mayor of the capital city. "Corpstein must
go!" was the cry of the radicals and the agi
tators. But he did not go. The Hunt
brand of politics and wild-eyed agitation
got its first body blow of the year in the
first test at the polls. Huntism in the state
capital "went down for the count," to
quote the classic language of Major Kelly
Douglas in describing the event. Jacob
Ericson, fearless and fair and capable as
a mayor, is up for re-election on a non
partisan ticket in Bisbee. Huntism and
wobblyism are arrayed against him. That
shining example set by Phoenix looks pret
ty fine. Let's follow it.
The German military offensive has been
met with dogged and unyielding bravery
by the allied bat,tle line. How will the Aus
trian peace offensive be met by the allied
civilian line? We know our soldiers are
brave. Are we brave, too ? The Picardy
line is unbroken still. How of the London
line", the Paris line; the Washington line?
How of the workshop and shipyard and
farmyard line? How of the newspaper
line; the politician's line; the fireside line?
Will they hold? The man on the .street
corner, in the office and the factory and
the field and the store, is his heart a3 brave
as the heart of his brother in Picardy? Will
he talk and work as well as his brother
fights? If he will, the Picardy line will
hold firm until the power of the offensive
is broken, and then it will advance again
to the eastward, never stopping until the
war is won.
"There is a river in France so narrow
that you can talk across it. Birds can fly
over with one sweep of their wings. Great
armies are on either bank, but they are as
far apart as the stars in the sky, as far as
right and wrong. There is a great ocean.
It is so wide that seagulls cannot fly across
it without rest. Upon cither shore there
are great nations. They are so close lh.it
their hearts touch.' Wiitten by u French

and that he is temporarily laid up.
Sandberg is well known in thi3 dis

FROM TUCSON.
Sliad loyer, tVc Tifon aasomo

o-i short business trip. lie otoj
over riotu Tucson. He was loud In
his praise of the good roads that had
k.. Ki,i it hv ihA hootleirerj ol Co
chise county and stated that he hoped i
the opposition of the Daunlas purity .
squad of which he had heard would
not bT of sufficient force to cause the
camp to be broken up. He said ' i ,
the good work go on. '
motnii.g of the opening ot the drive i
and the first anniversary of this na-,
tion's entry into the war. the Warren ;
district is awaiting the arrival of ma
terials from the headquarters of this
division. It is Drobable that workers
will begin their canvas of the several '
districts into which isisoee, ioweu.
and Warren have been divided by
Monday.
A series of trenches on tne ueriuan
loted to the county on the occasion j
of this drive. These trenches will be j
nia. Pfi iii Kiimn nnlilic place, and as j
each ten thousand dollars is subscrib-l
ed. one section of trench will De mica j
in with allied forces. The plan has)
been worked out by Thomas E. Egan,i
secretary of the district commercial
club, who has secured the sign and
made arrangements for placing it in )
some public position near the business
center of Uisbee.
"Over the Top to Berlin." says the
sign in large letters. "Third Liberty
Loan. How Many Trenches Will Bis-'
bee Take?" I
Beneath this legend are a scries of I
trenches each representing one nun-:
dred thousand dollars. Gradually as j
the subscriptions pour in the trenches;
will be marked occupied Dy panning
them over.
Occupation of the trenches will be
made a regular daily celebration. A
time will be set when committees will
announce their total sales for the day,
and when the grand total will, be an
nounced to the public and the trenches
taken. It is possible that c band will
be secured occasionally to assist when
a day's total has been unusually large,
and plans for the boosting of the sale
of war stamps while the trenching ex
ercises are in operation, are being
considered. What form these plans
will take has not yet been disclosed.
Completion of the Warren district
quota in a whirlwind campaign is
planned by those who have charge o."
the assault on the trenches. Through
concerted potion and hard work It is
hoped that this drive will be ended
in even mere record time than was the
jampu'gn of last fall.
