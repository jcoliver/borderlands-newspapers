The complete divisions which will
return at an early date, General
March said, are the 39th, 66th, 87th,

a total of 262,693, exclusive Of pris-!
oners. The total, which exceeds that!
made public a week ago by 28,000,
covers all losses to November 26. The j
principal change in the revised list is
th. aririftinn nf 13.100 men missing in
action. General Pershing, it was said.
has thus far forwarded no expiana
tion of the increase under this head
ing and it was assumed that an erroi
occurred in the transmission of the
previous figures. General March ex
plained that the revised figures on
prisoners could not be deciphered in
General Pershing's message.
The special units to embark soon,
consist largely of coast artillery bri
gades and separate regiments, many
battalions and batteries of anti-aircraft
artillery, engineers, trench mor
tar batteries and a number of other
organizations, including aero squad
rons. Orders have been issued, the chief
of staff also said, for the demobiliza
tion of 649,000 men in the camps and
cantonments in the United States. Ap
proximately 46.000 officers and men
In the home camps have already been
discharged.
By the' end of December, General
March indicated, probably 150.000 to
175.000 members of the expedition
ary forces will have returned to this
country. By utilizing a large num
ber of naval vessels, and cargo car
riers in addition to transports, he said
the war department hoped in time to
provide transportation for 300,000 fnen
a month.
General March gave out amended
casualty reports from General Persh
ing giving the official total to No
vember 26, as 262,723. exclusive of

EERLIN, Nov. 30 (By the Associ

fairs, replying to the charge of Kurt
Eisner, the Bavarian premier, that the
government at Berlin was responsible
for the war, declares in the Daut
scbes Zeitung:
"We did, in fact, consider that with
the crime of Sarajevo, Austria-Hungary's
hour of destiny had struck. We
did not prompt Austria-Hungary In

against it. The Vienna ultimatum
which we considered too severe, was
communicated to us too late for an
endeavor to mitigate it."

LONDON, Nov. 30. Kurt Eisner,
the Bavarion premier, explained to ft
meeting in Munich that the breaking
off of relations between Bavaria and
the Berlin government was due to the
fact, that the German foreign office
was the base of a counter revolution

patch to the Exchange Telegraph com
pany. Announcement of the severance of
relations between Bavaria and the
government at Eerlin was made on
November 28, in a diap ch from

WILHELM SHIFT8 BLAME.
COPENHAGEN, Nov. 30. (By the
Associated Press.) Former Emperor
William of Germany attempted fo
shaft the blame for the war to the
shoulders of Dr. Theobald von Beth
mann-Hollweg, former imperial chan
cellor, and Gottleib von Jagow, former
minister of foreign affairs, in a private
conversation he had with Dr. George
Wegener five days before he fled from
Germany, according to a report of the
interview written for the Cologne Zei
tung by Dr. Wegener.
The emperor told Dr. Wegener that
the government's policy of the last
weeks before the outbreak of the war
had been carried on by Dr. von Beth
mann-Hollweg and Herr von Jagow
alone.
"I know no more about it than that,'
he declared. "Against my will they
sent me to Norway."

had been unable to obtain during their
imprisonment Though the men were
supposed to remain on board the
train, the rules were relaxed suffici
ently to allow them to descend to

notorious phrase. The statement
says in part:
"The German government, in reply
to the protest addressed to them by
the British government through the
Spanish ambassador, denied that a
German submarine attacked the Rewa
and, in the absence of proof, refused
to discuss the protest made by the
British government against the at
tacks made on the Glenart Castle and
Guilford Castle. The foreign secre
tary thereupon transmitted state
ments supported by a sworn state
ment of facts in regard to the attacks
on these vessels and pointed out that
there could be no doubt that the sub
marine belonged to the Germans.
This action, as has been stated, was
contrary, not only to international law
and the law of humanity but also to a
definite pledge given by the German
government to the Spanish govern
ment that the German naval forces
would not attack hospital ships except
in certain waters which do not attack
hospital ships except in certain wa
ters, in which these three vessels
were assailed.
The facts, which have already been
published concerning the sinking of
these three hospital ships, as well as
the Llandovery Castle, are set forth
in the statement.
IAFI IS ANXIOUS FOR
LEAGUE OF NATIONS
OXFORD. Ohio, Nov. 30. Former
President William H. Taft speaking
before an audience tonight at Miami
University on "The League of Na
tions," said the German people were
as much responsible for the war as
the Hohenzollerns, in that, by reason
of their faulty education and the false
philosophy they had been taught for
years, they were willingly led. Mr.
Taft said President Wilson had once
announced himself as favorable to the
establishment of the league of nations
but had since grown lukewarm
However, it was hoped, he said, that
when the president got on the other
side he would change his attitude.
He said the United States, on ac
count of its dominance as a world
power, was the logical nation to push
the matter of the international league
and that this country cannot draw
back into its shell and say "we will
live unto ourselves and let the other
nations go as they please."
Commenting on the objection offer
ed by some people that a league of
nations would be unconstitutional. Mr.
Taft said sucu objections were not
only illogical but ridiculous. They re
minded him, he said, of many lawyers.

good statutes, would then, as a last re-
sort, attack the constitutionality of
the statute, and lose again.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 30. An offi

of Chile, charging Peruvian Consul
General Llose with responsibility for
the recent trouble between the two
countries at Iquiiue. and specifically
denying that Llosa was forced to re
turn to Peru, was received today at
the Chilean embassy.
The consul general, the report
said, left Valparaiso on instructions
from bis home office and had been
shown every consideration by the
Chilean authorities. In an interview
at Valparaiso, the consul general was
quoted as saying that he bad in no
way influenced bis government in the
issuance of the order for his recall
and denying that his fellow country
men had complained to him regard
ing the treatment accorded them by
the people of Chile.

Llosa, has addressed a communication

embassy, stating that he had given
to the members of the diplomatic

saying he was "compelled to go aboard

French vlce-connul added:
' "Being positive that the face re

Says Government Enterprise
Tends to Inefficiency; De
livers Diatribe Against Fur

(By Review Leased TV ire)
NEW YORK. Nov. 30. Charles E.
Hughes, speaking tonight before the
j Institute of Arts and Sciences at Co-
iumbia university, asserted that "gov
' ernment enterprise tends constantly
; to inefficiency." He characterized as
j "enemies of liberty" all "those whose
i interest lie simply ia extending the
activities of government so as to em
brace industry."
Discussing conditions following the
war, he declared that readjustment
should be brought about as soon as
practicable and that war powers
slunild not be used to control peace
conditions. Such a control, he said
wculd constitute a most serious of
fense against American institutions.
"The question of government own
ership and operation, is. after all. a
esveiely practical one," said Mr.
Hughes. "Of course, there are those
whose interests lie simply in extend
ing the activities of government as
to embrace all Industries and who are
endeavoring to proceed along what
they conceive to be the line of least
resistance in trying to keep in gov
ernment hands in time of peace what
has been taken temporarily by rea
son of the exigencies of war.
"The instinct of the American peo

short of a tyranny which whatever
name it might bear, would leave lit
tle room for preference, as compared
to Prussianism.
"1 is regrettable, but it is true, that
government enterprise tends constant
ly to inefficiency. it cannot
fail to be observed that vene In con
nection with the war. despite the
endeavor and patriotic impulses of
countless workers, inefficiency in im
portant fields of activity has been
notorious.
"Along with this is the grave ques
tion of putting the direct operation
of these great activities, unnecessar
ily under political control. That is
the most serious question. The dove
talllngs of government with business
is apt to injure both."
"It 'is probably true." he continued,
"that whenever, during the war. ex
traordinary, powers were fittingly ex
ercised and government control wa
assumed for war purposes, the read
justment to conditions of peace must
be affected gradually and with the
clrmumspection essential to the pro
tection of all the public and private
interests involved. But the immedi
ate purpose should be to readjust as
soon as may be. not use war powers
to control peace conditions. A pro
ceeding essentially vicious and con
stituting the most serious offense
against our Institutions."
Mr. Hughes added, however, that
undue centralization would be as dan
gerous to national prosperity as over
centralization. Congress, he said,
should provide a sensible plan for
railroad regulation, permitting sound
credit and growth", establishing se
curities and insuring adequate serv

dom has any utterance of Presi
dent Wilson been awaited with
greater interest than the address
he is to deliver Monday at the
opening of the winter session cf
congress, and on the eve of nis
departure for Europe to attend the
peace conference. Members of the
senate and house expect to hear
something of American plans for
the conference, as well as an out
line of the executive's views of
legislation needed to aid in the
task of readjusting the war-organized
country to a peace basis.
Arrangements were made today
for a joint session in the hall of th
house Monday afternoon at 1 o'clock
after congress and Benate leaders had
been notified that the president de
sired to be heard on the first day of
the new session instead of on the
second, as usual, in order to hasten
his departure. The address will con

of the peace delegation announced
last night at the White House. No

formally, it was indicated at the state
department that these points con hi
not be cleared up because of uncer
tainty as to the course to be followed
by the heads of the associated govern

gations. Exact information was Bald
still to be lacking.
The state department made public
the names of the chief officers and
attaches of the delegation, including
the secretaries and Dr. James Brown
Scott and David Hunter Miller, expert
advisers in international law. The
war department announced the per
sonnel of the group of assistant to
General Bliss, among whom will be
a number of officers detailed from
the American expeditionary forces.
All of the party, which with its

over the president's failure to take
one of their number on the delega

statements on the subject were issued
for publication. Several of the re
publicans discussed plans for intro

to send a special senate committee
to France to remain during the con

UNIVERSITY ELEVEN
THRIFT STAMP STAR
FOR ARIZONA STATE
STATE DIRECTOR HARRY R.
TRITLE ANN OUNCES FIRST
HONOR STAR FOLLOWING RE
CEIPT OF' LETTER FROM T. L.
HOUSTON, SOCIETY SECRETARY
First in the state to report "over the
top" for its war savings stamp society
is the Phelps Dodge Mercantile com
pany. The announcement was made
in Phoenix by State Director H. R.
Tritle of the Arizona war savings
stamp committee a few days ago that
as each war savings stamp society in
the state made good its pledge for
the sale of thrift stamps and baby
bonds the name of that society with
an honor star after each name would
be published. In response to this no
tice T. L. Houston, secretary of the
Phelps . Dodge Mercantile company
war savings stamp society, incidental
ly one, of the very largest societies in
the state, has just written State Direc
tor Tirtle as follows:
"I ain pleased to report that our so
ciety has gone 'over the top' more
than 100 per cent. The amount pledged
by our society was $20,000 and to dale
our sales have been more than $45,
000. "We note in your letter that you say
a list of the societies will be publish
ed and a star will be inserted after
all societies that have fulfilled their
pledges. The amount of our sales
will of course entitle us to have a
star.
"We will also push the sales of the
stamps as vigorously as ever until the
end of the year."
This letter proved one of the most
encouraging things received at the
state headquarters for the war savings
stamps in a long time. In all prob
ability the Phelps Dodge Mercantile
company war savings stamp society
will be deemed entitled to have at
least two stars after its name when
the list is printed one star for quota
and another for its 100 per cent over
subscription. This list will be published some
time next month and will show just
bow the many war savings stamp so
cieties in the state are doing and how
many of them have lived up to their
definite pledges to invest in the best
little bonds the government is offer
ing to careful and patriotic Investors.

CAMPAIGN BEING MADE TO IN
CREASE THE LIST OF ADOPTED
FRENCH ORPHANS IN THE
WARREN DISTRICT; MANY RE
NEWING FORMER PLEDGES
Quite a number of the residents of
the Warren district have Tenewed
their adoption of the fatherless chil
dren in France, but there are still
some who have not as yet done so.
It was the hope of those interested
in the work that the same number
be adopted this year in the district
at last. Mrs. W. H. Brophy, who has
cl'.arge of the work, still has hopes
of reKrting that the Warren district
citizens are going to see the little
ones looked after again this year, or
t'.ie number increased. There have
been 350,000 homes in France wreck
ed and no longer exist. Besides the
loss of men, there are 5.000,000 civil
ians belonging to the invaded dis
tricts. 2.000,000 of whom remained
under German domination. Of thii
number there is perhaps but few of
the adults whose health is not
wrecked.
If we had lost, proportionate to our
population, as many men as France
has lost, instead of the 60.000 for
wJioin we weep so bitterly, we would
have 6.000.00O.
For those of us who will have our
boys back, could there be a more
touching thank offering to Ood than
that we should take one little French
orphafl under our care?
The French race cau only be saved
if the little ones are taken rare of
today and taken care of by . the
friends of France, for stricken France
for a time, at any rate, must trust
to her friends. How could America
ever rejoice fully in our great tri
umph if it appeared that our friend,
France, whoiu we had always pro
claimed, to be our friend, was found
to have gone down entirely, and Amer
ican friendship had seemed to have
bet ii so little as this would mean?
A great Frenchman once said.
"Power means protection." In that
di-gree in which we are powerful, praj
God tliHt we may be a protection tc
our friends.

DRASTIC STEPS TO
PREVENT DESERTION
More drastle steps than ever are
to be taken to prevent desertion from
the army and navy during the period
of demobilization, according to word
received recently by the state council
of defense. State and county councils
are urged to co-operate in this im
portant service, looking out for and
apprehending any deserters who may
come to Arizona for refuge.
Cases of draft evasion and deser
tion are to be followed up and prose
cuted just the same now as during
the war. The extreme penally for de
sertion is death.
Families of soldiers and sailors are
particularly urged not to do anything
which would suggest to their members
in sen-ice that, now war being over,
there is no need for further service.
All soldiers and sailors not needed are
to be returned as rapidly as circum
stances will permit, but this return to
civil life must be conducted in an
orderly fashion with the same highly
sustained morale' which has charac
terized American fighting men from
the start of hostilities.
Civilians who' have suspicion that
men whom they know to have been
in service have deserted are request
ed to notify the Arizona state council
of defense so that a suitable investi
gation may be made. Such informa
tion will be regarded as strictly con
fidential and will be promptly acted
upon.
"FLU" DEPLETES BOOZE
PLAN NO ACTION.
NEWARK, N. J., Nov. 30. The
brewers of the country will make no
effort at this time to have the ban
against brewing lifted, according to
Phoenix: The Spanish influenza
epidemjc has played havoc with the
stock of contraband whisky in the
care of Sheriff W. H. Wilky, or rath
er whisky that was formerly under his
care. Already the epidemic has result-
i ed in the consumption of approximate
ly $80,000 worth of bootleg whisky in
' this county, it is estimated. The ever
increasing demand for the liquor has
j resulted in practically depleting the
! large store formerly held at the coun
' ty jail. Before the epidemic made its
appearance in Phoenix Sheriff Wilky !
: had under his care approximately 10,-
' 000 pints of contraband liqucrs. A
! large majority of this has already
I been consumed.
GRIP PREVALENT
BRINGING DEATH
TO VIENNESE
For First Time Austrian Cap
ital Assumes Atmosphere
of War, With Dimmed
Lights, Amusements Closed
(Fly Review Leased Wire)
VIENNA, Friday, Nov. 29, (By the
Associated Press.) The grippe has
become prevalent again in this city
and at Budapest, with more fatal re
sults than in the former epidemic, al
though the cases as yet are not so nu
merous. Vienna tonight for the first time
took on the appearance of a war zone
city, all the lights being turned low
in order to save coal. All houses were
shut up at 8 o'clock, the stores and
restaurants at 9 and the cafes at 10.
The political situation here is pa
thetic. There is talk of a revolution
on all sides, though those proposing
to overthrow the government admit
the uselessness of such an action.
The correspondent, whose presence
is known throughout the city, has bad
many visitors, one of whom said he
represented a political group which
wished to know if it were possible to
annex Austria to the United States.
He said Austria was in a hopeless
situation, surrounded by enemies, both
men and women, who were ruthlessly
robbing.
The correspondents, who reached
such numbers as to almost prevent
him and the other correspondents
from preparing dispatches, wish either
to write to friends or relatives in the
United States, or else to go there to
wori.
Food conditions in Vienna are
gradually becoming werse, with the
poor eating black bread in small
quantities and a soup made of water
and baked flour or vegetables. The
lack of fats is undermining strength,
even in the case of the rich, who are
able to eat large, but unsatisfactory
food portions. It is certain there are
some provisions in the country dis
tricts, but the farmers part with their
food supplies only to speculators in
exchange for the shoes, clothes, or
money they need.
In the poor quarters of Vienna the
women say they have no undercloth
ing, all the pre-war stocks having been
used up. It is a family calamity when
It is necessary to buy shoes for any
member, because the purchase means
half a month's salary. It is a familiar
sight in the restaurants, where -meals
cost $3 and upward to see natrons
carrying off scraps of food.

Germany was unable to continue the
fighting.
The food of the prisoners was rea

wounded had high praise for the Ger

ARRIVE IN GENEVA
GENEVA, Nov. 30. Coming back
from Constance, 644 allied officers, in
cluding 249 Americans, arrived here
last night from German prisons. Lewis
W. Haskell .the American consul, and
many Americans gave them a warm
welcome.
The Americans looked much more
healthy than the British officers,
many of whom had been four years in
captivity. - Several of the Americans
had been confined at camps in Rhine
towns which suffered from the allied
aerial bombardments of reprisal.

TION, Thursday. Nov. 28 (By the As

along the Moselle river, had a great
thrill Wednesday, when they reached
the German side of the river, along
the railroad from Treves to Metz,
which parallels the Moselle. Passen
ger trains had been operated as usual
since the Americans reached the
western bank and when an apparent

Wednesday, the Americans paid no at
tention to it
Suddenly a yell came from the first
coach. Then a little French 'flag
was waved frantically from the win
dow by a blue uniformed arm. A
second later a British flag fluttered
from a window and the cheers in
creased in volume. Eefore the patrols
realized what had happened, more
cheers were heard from one of the
two rear coaches and an American
flag suddenly appeared, waving vig
orously. The train consisted of eleven coach
es, every one of which was filled with
French.1 British and American re
leased soldiers being taken by the
Germans to Metz. The patrols were
the first of the allied troops to be
seen by the prisoners since the sign

THE TEMPER OF LOYALISTS
(Chicago Tribune.)
That there may be no mistake about
who won the war, soldiers and sailors in
New York, soldiers and sailors who, a few
months ago, were and shortly will again
be civilians in all walks of life, rained some
hardened knuckles on the skulls of the bol
shevik crew. This was their manner of re
plying to the lying, poisonous propaganda
of so-called proletarian socialism.
The voice of the proletariat is someth'ng
. to consider in Russia, where some 90 per
cent of the population lives in ignorance
and has always lived under oppression. The
meager and filthy exotics of this country
propose to arouse a like sentiment. But
they have failed to take note of a free
thinking, intelligent populace which in an
age of progress and education and broad
suffrage is as far removed from the un
thinkable stamp of oppression as is liberty
from slavery.
Prattling of the proletariat in America is
as wide of the point as referring to Gover
nor Lowden as a peasant because he
chooses to live on a farm in civil life. Peas
antry in America, indeed! Our exotics
should try to talk their bolshevism among
the farmers of this neighborhood who set
their plows so grimly that a billion bushels
increase was their response to the govern
ment's request.
But this is incidental. The shameful
fraud of the "internationalists" bolshev
ists and un-American is their throaty
croak, "We won the war." In effect this
means: "The American proletariat won the
war; the proletariat of Europe won the
war." It is unspeakable, and the Ameri
cans who did win the war, the soldiers and
. sailors who left their shops and plows and
offices to don the American uniform,
showed the croakers that the temper of the
country will be aroused.
The American proletariat did not win
the war because there is no American prole-:
tariat. There is a nation of intelligent, re
sourceful, and patriotic men and women
who will rise to anger when the Lenines
and Trotzkys attempt to brand them with
the hateful mark of downtrodden ignor
ance. The proletariat did not win the war
for England, France and Belgium, or Italy
or Slovakia or Serbia or any other of the
peoples that engaged. There are no such
classes in those countries patriotic enough
and loyal enough .to bear arms for a decent
cause.
This has been a war of people of all
the people. And only the bolshevists re
mained away as wolves skulking in the
offing, their jawls drooling in prospect of
a feast as they circled about two mighty
deer locked in a death struggle. Russia
and Germany have fallen, wounded in the
conflict; and the wolves that took no honorable-part,
but only lurked in the shadows
and spread the contagion 'of discontent
now rush forth to seize upon the sick body
politic. Such as the bolshevist.
Is the bolshevist a democratic person,
and does he cry out for government by the
people? Not so. In Russia we saw the
temperate tCerensky government thrown
aside and terrorism set up in its place.
Russian streets have run with blood, and
just lately we read of 500 officers slain to
emphasize the bolshevik authority. We
thought this could not happen in Germany
because we have been told that Germans
are complacent, obedient to the state, in
dustrious and orderly. In the transition
from autocracy to alleged democracy there
was quiet and order. But those who placed
their trust in sanity failed to take note of
the thirst of the wolves that circled in the
shadow's. And now the Soviets are in wide
control.
There can be no mistaking the clause
from the "agreement" between the soldiers
and sailors' council and the government:
"Second Their aim is to defend and
develop what has been accomplished by
the revolution and to suppress all counter
revolutionary activity."
Thus orders Dr. Liebknecht, the leader
of the so-called Spartacus group, well
named from the predatory bandits who
made life miserable for the Romans. He
proposes to "suppress all counter revolu
tionary activity." What he proposes is
that he will suppress any attempt to bring
about representative government; that he
will prevent any legislation save that di
rected by his own group ; and that the peo
ple at large, particularly the vast middle
class of merchants, artisans, and profes
sional people, will be denied a voice.
And so, bolshevism proposes the bloodi
est tyrannies. But there is conceivably a
lenient form of tyranny; for an aristcracy
implies intelligence and possible cruelty;
but bolshevism implyes a tyranny of ignor
ance and certain cruelty. Wherefore there
is not a defense for it.
Broadly speaking, the soldiers and sailors
in New York provided the remedy. There
is no more hope of converting a bolshevist
to sanity than to converting a Turk to
sanitation. But there is a hope of warning
the sober, thinking, the patriotic Ameri
cans to be on their guard and to take meas
ures against the wolves. America must not
foster sedition that is as dangerous in peace
as in war. Who harangues against the
government rails against the people. It is
the people's affair.
THE DIRECT PRIMARY
That the direct primary has been a fail
ure, from any standpoint of observation,
appears to be the opinion of a majority of
the people of Arizona. The latest angle
of attack is upon the expense of the sys
tem to the individual aspirants for office.
On the question the Mohave County
Miner, published in Kingman, says:
"One of the laws that years of trial has
proven to be a farce, is the direct primary.
What it sought to rectify it magnified a
hundred fold that of purchasing nomina
tions. It is said that the race for the gov
ernorship in the democratic . party cost
some of the candidates more than $50,000,
and we are inclined to believe it to be true.'
Even if a man is careful and frugal in ex
penditures, if he visits all parts of the state
and uses placards and newspaper space, it
will cost him well up in the thousands, and
if he is successful he will have to make the
round again for the general election and do
the business all over. Arizona has in no
way benefited by the direct primary in the
securing of good men to office and we do
not believe any other state has been bene
fited. Many things can be lodged against
the old party convention system, but we
must say that a better class of men were
brought out for office. You did not find
so many of the other party padding the
convention as in the present condition of
our primary law. Few of the men who
carried through on both republican and
democratic party tickets at the last election
would be considered in a convention of
those parties because of the fact that re-,
publicans, socialists and democrats regis
tered with the dominant party in every
state and vote with it in the primaries for
the poorest timber on the ticket in the
hope that they will be able to beat them
out at election. This is not true of the con
vention system, where men will have to
show honest conviction, at least. If the
law was so amended that the man receiving
the majority of all the votes cast at the pri-
maries would be declared elected, it is pos
sible that it might mitigate the evils of this
system. But it is more than probable that
many of the states will return to the old
convention system, the delegates to be
elected by some form of primary.
Some of these folks who swelled around
with pride when they bought a liberty bond
to support the government are now quiet
ly tipping the broker to sell them off at
2 per cent discount.

Wuz Liberty. Who wouldn't cheer?
I s'pose she's still there with the

An' her lamp givin' light to the

That may all be so, but there's lots
of us know
How we still feel the touch of her

Sometimes in the night when there
ain't any fight.
An' we're standin' on guard all

Like an angel o' grace she comes near
an' her face
Cheers our hearts which wuz cold
er'n a stone.
In the thick of a scrap, with sweat
oozin' like sap.
She puts her cool band into ours;
An' like that everywhere, we c'n feel

With her help, and her smile like
the flowers.

SUBJECT OF MEET
NEW YORK. Nov. 30. Social
workers from all parts of the United
States gathered here to consider
problems arising from demobilization
of the nation's armed forces, today
adopted a resolution calling on the
government "for avoidance of the evils
of tha pension system for our victori
ous troops and of preventable poverty
among wage earners."
Further extension "of the social In
surance and in workmen's compensa
tion laws" was suggested as a remedy.
The conference also resolved to re
quest the United States public health
service and the American Public
Health association "to take immediate
steps to safeguard the returning army
and the civilian population against
possible recurrence of the influenza
epidemic." .
Establishment of a permanent labor
board, to be appointed by the presi
dent and backed by labor of all
classes as the best method of meet
ing the problems that will arise
through demobilization and during
the conversion of industrial plants
from a war to a peace basis, was ad
vocated at a dinner tonight followinj
the conference. The plan was olfered
by Alexander M. Bing of the industrial
service of the ordnance department
who declared the government had
maintained industrial peace during
the war by insisting on collective
bargaining.
"Labor has taken its place in the
government and will hold it," said
Prof. Ear! Dean Howard of the United
States Chamber of Commerce, an
other speaker, "but it should be re
osnized that a form of collective bar
gaining must be established between
employers and employes, not through
labor unions. The chief object of
labor organizations has been to fight
to keep their strength. This will not
be -neceisary under the proper sys
tem of collective bargaining."
"Every workingman has a property
right in his job," declared Frank F
Walsh, joint chairman of the national
war labor board. "This is the basis
of all iusthe." he added, "and should
be protected by the. governmenL"
Asserting that the war labor board
has found upon investigation that a
lamily of five could not be supported
on a wage of less than $34.80 weekly,
he declared that "whenever an Indus
try refuses to pay its workers a living
wage, it has no right to exist, and
furthermore, no state can live which
permits such an industry to exist with
in its borders."
Workingmen have the right to or
ganize, and he characterized the no
madic worker, as "sniffing and bo
neath industry."

PARIS, Friday, Nov. 29. The Amer

has informed the provincial food com
mittee at Lille that it has at its dis
posal, important stocks of fats and
other foodstuffs at Rotterdam and
various stores in Belgium. Part of
these stocks are from shipments in
the last days of the war. The arm
istice prevented their reaching their
destination, owing to military events,
for most of the canals In Belgium
were impassable, owing to the Ger
mans blowing up dams and bridge--and
sinking barges and boats previous
to their retreat.
The Associated Press is informed
by Robinson Smith, representative of
the commission that the Temeuzen
canal from the Dutch frontier to
Ghent probably will be freed from ob
structions by December 1.
Navigation of the Meuse is prac
tically at a standstill, owing to the
blocking of the river between Huy
and Namur with mere than 300 barges
and boats loaded with loot and pro

the most vigorous support for the Home Oil Co. because of the fact that it is the only company
operative in the Chino Valley at present; its equipment is thorough; moneys received from past sal s
of stock have been accounted for' In full and have gone toward actual development and thr-i
Home Co. have lived up to all promises which they have made, altogether securing the ab
solute confidence of the sixiple of this section, without which the present state of development
could not have been secured. . ' ' '
As you know, we have endinavored to shop up illigitimate operations with some success, and
we are naturally inclined, as a matter of consistency, to heartily endorse such legitimate efforts
as are bring and have been made by the Home Oil Co.
Wishing you success in securing the support you deserve, I am.
Very truly yours
FRED O. CRAIN,
Secretary. .
CHAMBER OF OIL & MINES OF ARIZONA.
The Home Oil Company is drilling for OIL in Chino Valley, Yavapai County, Arizona.
Tne Home Oil Company has the most MODERN, COMPLETE, BRAND NEW STANDARD Drilling Ekuipment
that money could buy.
The Home Oil Company has now reached depths of approximately 900 feet, and making average depth of 20
feet daily.
The Home Oil Company drilled first 600 feet with 1 6-inch bit (standard size) and at that depth cased off water
with l2J2-inch Special California Casing, weighing 40 lbs. to the food. Size of hole from 600 feet to present depth
is 1 2J2 inches, being standard size, and making it possible to go any depth necessary.
The Home Oil Company is only company ever drilling in Chino Valley that has kept hole to standard size, and
that is drilling a real oil well.
The Home Oil Company does not have to go much deeper to penetrate the sand that is known to exist in Chino
Valley, and that contains high-grade paraffin base oil.
The Home Oil Company honestly and earnestly believes that inside of 60 days, and very likely much sooner, they
will drill into the oil sand and will have the first producing oil well in Arizona.
SAGER'S REPORT
In conclusion to report;, made by E. Ronald Sager, the great oil geologist, on the Chino Valley, he
states as follows:
"The indications in the Chino Valley can be likened to the fields of the Colorado, Wyoming and
Mid-Continent fields. Thes fields producing oil of paraffin base. This is a very favorable point for
the Chino Valley fields, as there is a wide margin between the price of asphalt and paraffin base oils.
High grade paraffin crud? is today quoted at around $3.00 per barrel, while asphalt is about $1.00, and
it is a certainty that paraffin base oils will go higher, as the demand for the by-products of paraffin base
are being more and more used in the manufacture of analine dy:s and other chemicals. Hence,
paraffin base oils will always command prices far Inexcess of the asphalt base crude.
The fact that no proven oil area has yet been discovered in Arizona, is no indication that there
i should not b oil in this state. As I have heretofore stated, the various attempts made to drill have
no bearing from a standpoint of a thorough test.
I am satisfied from statements made, and data available, that the discovery well (as it is called)
i in Chino Valley was drilled through about 100 f:t of oil sand and that the showing for paraffin oil
of high grade was remarkably good.
I wish to say that in my experience, covering nearly every oil field in the country, I have never sen
any other untested locality that presented so many favorable features as tho Chino Valley. The geologi
cal conditions are correct, the gathering ground is of large area. The existence of oil in the discovery
well, and the oil saturated rocks ap? conclusive evidence that there is oil. The formations are of the
approximate age and character of the great Mid-Continent fields, and finally water is .rily obtain
able and transportation at hand.
So much for Home Oil Company's honesty of purpose, chances for oil in Chino Valley and unceasing endeavors
to develop resources of Arizona. But the chance to make big profit by buying Home Oil Company stock does
not entirely depend on the success of Chino Valley development.
The Home Oil Company owns 320 in the Holbrook field, Navajo County, Arizona. The indications for oil in
this field are very similar to Chino Valley. Expert oil geologists say the oil is there.
Three wells are new being drilled in the Holbrook field, and Home Oil Company land lies adjoining, and very
close to this development which will prove Home Oil Company's land.
Last, but not least. Home Oil Company has lease on 160 acres lying in the heart of the Great Ranger Oil belt in
Texas. This territory is proving to be the greatest oil producing era ever opened up in this orany other country.
Wells with daily capacity of from 1 000 to 5000 barrels have been brought in by the hundreds in the past few
months. Companies that were organized only a few months ago have declared dividends aggregating from 100rt
to 800 cc on par value of their stock. Fortunes have been made over night. The Home Oil Company's lease lies
right in line with greatest development of the field.
Home Oil Company will drill on their land in Texas. Preparations to that end are now being made. Only a few
miles from Home Oil Company lease, the great Haskill well was brought in the past 30 days. This well is a real
gusher.- Estimated as producing several thousand barrels daily.
If the Home Oil Company was not offering any more than wonderful opportunity Texas land presents, stock
would be best speculative chance being offered by any company, but Home Oil Company is giving its stock hold
ers a THREE WAY CHANCE. Chino Valley, Holbrook and Texas, and you can buy the stock at 5c per share.
The Home Oil Company solicits and courts the most rigid investigation. Let us explain to you the vital points
that go to make a success of an enterprise of this kind. Namenly, HOW MUCH STOCK was set ASIDE FOR DE
VELOPMENT? How much of maney raised goes for actual development of properties, etc.
REMEMBER. THAT OIL OFFERS THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY FOR MAKING BIG MONEY of ANY
LINE OF HUMAN ENDEAVOR. AND HOME OIL IS OFFERING YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE MORE
MONEY ON THE AMOUNT YOU INVEST THAN EVER OFFERED IN THE HISTORY OF OIL DEVELOP
MENT. The Home Oil Ccmpany is offering a limited amount of treasury stock at 5c per share.
Allotment at this price will only last a few days. In less than one week's time the people of Prescott and vicin
ity have bought over 50,000 shares of Home Oil Stock.
These people know with what unceasing endeavor Home Oil has carried on development, and they also know
that the cards are not marked, and they would get a real run for their money. You are overlooking' a real oppor
tunity if you do not get Home Oil Stock and get it quick.
W. R. McConnell, secretary and general manager of Home Oil Company, is in Bisbee for a few days and will be
pleased to meet and give first hand and authentic information to any one interested in development of Chino Valley.
CALL AND SEE HIM. If you can't call. Mail in your order.
Remember, this Heme Oil Company is going to drill into oil sand in Chino Valley and prove that oil exists there in
paying quantities. If you are interested in development of Chino Valley, either by holding stock in any other
company or having land there, it is to your interest to support Home Oil, a3 their development will enhance value
of your holding very materially.

TO MUSTER OUT
CAMP CODY MEN
According to the El Paso Herald
that was received here yesterday the
men now in training at Camp Cody,
New Mexico, are to be mustered out
within the next few days. There are
a number of Arizona men at that camp
who will be released thereby. The
article a3 published is as follows:
Immediate mustering out of the
troops at Camp Cody is planned, ac
cording to Carnett King, general pas
senger agent of the E. P. & S. W. rail
road. Three carloads of men, 125 all told,
passed through El Paso Wednesday
morning en route to Cody to look aft
er the military end of the demobiliza
tion. Mr. King has been ordered to
look after the transportation arrange
ments. The men are to be mustered out as
fast as the party which reached there
Thursday can go over the papers.
Each man will be paid transportation
to his place of enlistment or the place
front which he was drafted. He can
then buy a ticket to any point in the
United States at two-thirds the reg
ular fare, without stopover privileges,
however.
Mr. King says he thinks many of
the men will wish to visit El Paso and
that they will probably pay regular
fare to come in here for a visit and
then will buy their two-thirds fare
tickets to their home cities from here.
However, he will be prepared to seli
tickets to all of them to any point di
rect from Camp Cody.
. Mr. King believes the mustering out
of the Cody men has been delayed be
cause on December 1 the charge for
Pullman fare is to be eliminated. Sol
diers, as well as others, have to pay
this extra fare to ride in a Pullman
under the present rule. 'When the
charge is abolished, a soldier may still
ride on a two-thirds fare ticket and
then occupy a Pullman merely by the
purchase of a Pullman ticket.

Rescue Boat Sighted
The Ellington carried a "blinker"
an electric signal and as she
blinked her way through the night
and the heavy seas she was sighted
by the weary crew of the Trojan, who
again sent up rockets.
The boats neareil eacu other about
11 o'clock and a battle of more than
an hour ensued before a line waa
made fast to the Trojan. During this
battle Gerald Rhodes was swept over

Finally, after midnight, a cable was

STABALIZED MARKET FOR
COPPER ANTICIPATED AFTER
FIRST OF THE COMING YEAR
AH Aid Possible Will Be Given by War Industrie Board to
Bring This Desired End About, While Some of Strongest
Men in Industry Are Working Toward That End; Approxi
mately Present Level Must Be Maintained or Some Small
Producers Would Find Themselves Unable to Bear Heavy
Burden of Increased Costs and Wages
BRUGES GOES WILD WITH JOY AS BELGIAN KING AND QUEEN
RE-ENTER LIBERATED CITY; ROYAL COUPLE SALUTE THE FLAG
A plan to stabilize prices and output of copper has been outlined by tbe
leaders In the industry and it is now practically certain that all the aid pos
sible will be given by tfe "War industries board. This view is based on the
agreement reached in Washington at the meeting between the members of
the board and tbe copper men, which provides that output and wages be
continued at the maximum, and fixed prices remain unchanged until January!
. 1, at least a (
It Is known that the leaders in the trade-have been conferring for sev-,'
eral weeks with the view of formulatinar their Dlans. should tho war end I
suddenly, so .that when the armistice appeared confident of the outlook. J
That these men will continue their efforts after the first of the year in
stabilizing the situation Is believed certain. - '
As a result it is not expected that there will be any great disturbance
in the industry during the readjustment period from a war basis to peace
conditions, although eventually the market will be governed entirely by the
old rule of supply and demand. When this time comes, however, it is be
lleved the situation will be In hand to such an extent that everything' will
work out satisfactorily.
There is believed to be a possibility also that the leaders will have plans
to take care of the future of the market through some general agreement
and it is the opinion that whatever is decided upon will have some support
from the government authorities, as it is realized that the readjustment must
necessarily proceed slowly.
So long as wages are kept at the present high rate, and the cost of ma
terials continues as it is, copper men say there can be no material change
in the price for the red metal, as any sharp reduction would eliminate many
producers who could not afford to operate with any considerable reduction in
the price for the refined metal.
jn the selling branch of the trade the belief is general that there will be
an unusually good demand for peace purposes from domestic consumers.
Many users of copper have been forced to find substitutes in turning out
finished products during the tast year or so, because the red metal was not
obtainable except through priority orders and requisitions for war purposes.
This demand has been piling up and when it comes to the market the
production of the mines is expected to be absorbed without difficulty. In ad
dition there will be a large foreign demand, it is maintained, and In this
connection the fact that already one foreign government has inquired for
SOO.000 tons is taken as indicative of what might be looked for in the fu
ture. '
Some of the best authorities In the industry state that the copper situa
tion is better than that prevailing in any other commodity which was domin
ated during the past few years by the war. There is said to be a healthy con
dition, in that no surplus of the metal is on hand, and in addition it is believed
that the reconstruction period abroad, and the resumption or regular domestic
lines in this country will do much to keep the market in a position where
there will be little or no disturbance, at least for many months, if not fo
years.

Following the resignation of M. H.

eral manager of the Detroit Copper
company mines at Morenci, Capt.
James P. Hodgson, consulting mining
engineer for the Phelps Dodge corpo
ration has been promoted to the posi
tion thus made vacant and has left
Bisbee for his new post.
Captain Hodgson's fine record for
efficiency, made in the Michigan dis
tricts, has been enhanced greatly
since he came to Bisbee to make his
headquarters. As a mining expert
be has won additional laurels in his
profession, while as a citizen he has
gained a warm place in the hearts of
Bisbee folk. He has been particularly
prominent in Y. M. C. A. work since
coming here. The good wishes of his
local friends will follow him to Mo
renci. Captain Hodgson's promotion made
room for another mining man of rec
ognized merit in the person of Ger
ald Sherman, who succeeds him as
consulting engineer for the Phelps
Dodge corporation. Mr. Sherman,
during the several years of his con
nection with the Copper Queen branch
and more particularly since he has
been its mining superintendent, has
gained a well-deserved reputation for
efficiency. This is amply borne out

Advice has just come from tbe

pany has completed negotiations, un
der way for several months past,
which gives them control of the Thar

was owned by a New York and Bos

adjoins both tbex Moctezuma Copper

portant asset to the latter. Further
more it is claimed by the Nacozari
Consolidated that the newly acquired
property embraces a very large area
of the great copper prophyry zone,
extending through the Moctezuma
Copper company and their own hold
ings. The Nacozari Consolidated has in
stalled and paid for new ore cars,
track, compressed air drills, air pipe
lines, etc. Their main adit has been
driven over 2500 feet under the moun
tain, and work will ' now be carried
forward vigorously, with the intention
of opening up the big copper reserve
as quickly as possible. It is under
stood that the Tharsls-York com
pany has prevented the further ex
tension of the big tunnel, but with
this obstacle removed, the work " will
progress rapidly; a solid six foot vein
of copper, silver and gold has already

For the ten months of 1918. production totals 1,533.640.649 pounds a gain
of more than 96,000,000 pounds over the corresponding period of last year.
This comparison, however, does not disclose the true story, for in several
months of last year production was seriously retarded by the strike of em
ployes at a number of the mines, output being generally curtailed -until the
beginning of the present year. Another reason for the gain this year is due
to the production of New Cornelia which, for the ten months, amounted to
almost 40.000,000 pounds, as compared with slightly more than 10.600.000
pounds last year, the company not starting operations until June 1917.

WEEKLY REVIEW.
NEW YORK. Nov. 30 The securi
ties market continued to wait on
peace developments this week, the
course of prices showing no very
pronounced trend. Abrupt transition
from war to peace and impending do
mestic political developments added
to the caution manifested by leading
financial interests.
It is expected that labor -will be
speedily absorbed under the approach
ing era of industrial readjustment,
but the heads of many important en
terpriser are hopeful that Washing
ton shay soon announce a definite pro
gram in this connection.
Already there are signs that the
removal of restrictions has effected a
downward revision in prices of nu
merous commodities.. The schedules
of steel and iron mills show no change
as yet, but copper and allied metals
have been cut, according to recent
trade reports.
Quotations for such staples as
sugars, leathers and oils are believed
to be in process of change, the move
ment also extending to bituminous
coal, but ike more essential foodstuffs
hold firm.
Aside from the important phases
presented by the signing of the armi-!

Rock and Finds Float From
Rich Mother Lode
PHOENIX. Aria., Nov. 30. A trio of
disgusted placer miners, about to de
part non-paying diggings in a gulch
of the Plumas mountains of north
ern Yuma county, have made a phe
nomenal gold Btrike. Tbe men, by
name, Joe Johnson, Georgs Hudson
and J. E. Brinley, were dejectedly
viewing about an eighth cf an ounce
of gold dust, their day's clean-dp from
dry washing, when Johnson sought
to relieve his feelings by hitting a
borldeo with his pick.
The rock broke and showed itself
quarts, fairly speckled with gold. The
float was traced a short distance to
a ledge declared the richest ever
known on the desert, visible for a
mile. There has been hurried de
velopment to the depth of 30 feet,
where the samples are said to be as
rich as on the surface. The find Is
about 11 miles from Quartzsite and
its noted cement gold placer field.
Remarkable Specimens
Remarkable gold specimens have
been brought to Phoenix from the
Lavelle mines, eight miles south of
Hayden, where specimen rock is not
to be relied upon for most of the re
turn. Over 1000 feet of tunneling has
been done and plenty of ore blocked
out for several years' operation of a
50 ton concentrating mill, for which
the machinery has been ordered, with
expectatlop that milling will start

ore a month to a smelter, with very
satisfactory returns. This ore is from
comparatively shallow depth, though
deeper -exploration has been started
from the floor of No. 3 tunnel.
Financial Trouble
. Financial trouble within the prom
ising Sunflower Cinnabar Mining
company is indicated by a sheriff's

property has very rich quicksilver

Arthur Notman, who has been Mr.
Sherman's assistant, has been desig

TUCSON, Ariz., Nov. 30. That the
American Smelting & Refining com
pany's plant at Sasco will soon be
closed on account of the difficulty in
obtaining a sufficient quantity of ore
to operate it full time is reported to
have been tentatively determined
upon at a meeting of the executive
committee of the company at Sasco
Friday afternoon.
It has been current among mining
men for some time that tbe plant
might be closed; and report also had
it that the mining operations at Sil
verbell would also be closed, but it is
known that tha latter is not contem
plated. Operations will be continued,!
in connection with further develop-;
ment work, it is understood.
According to report, the plant at'
Sasco will not be closed immediately, I
but will be operated for several
months longer, the ultimate date de- i
pending, presumably, upon smelting j
conditions in the immediate future. !
The officials who met at Sasco I
Wednesday were H. E. Prosser or j
New York, "H. R. Wagner, represen- j
tative of the Guggenheim interests on j
the Pacific coast; Kuno Uoerr, gen-!
era! manager of A. S. & R. smelting '

pany at El Paso, and J. Kruttschnitt,

That the Sasco smelter is having j
difficulty in securing sufficient ore to
warrant full-time operations will be :
surprising news to laymen, inasmuch ,
as there has been considerable talk j
and agitation for the erection of ad
ditional smelting plants. i
None of the members of the party
of officials would discuss the matter ;
of the closing of the smelter for pub-!
lication, as no definite plans for
closing the plant were concluded at
the meeting Wednesday.
Whether or not, in the event of .
the closing of the plant, the Tucson
offices of the American Smelting &
Refining company would be closed al
together or moved to Silverbell, is not
known. 1

THREE
Germans Made Vast Effort
To Hold Mexico9 s Trade and
Get Hold of Mineral Wealth
EL PASO, Tex., Nov. 22. American
trade relation with Mexico, now that
the war has ended, is interesting busi
ness men and students of economy
on the border.
German agents, operating through
officials cf tho German empire, con
ducted a systematic campaign through
out Mexico to discredit American
made goods. This was done with a
definite view toward trade conditions
after the war. This was carried to
the point of organizing a boycott fn a
number of places in Mexico, while in
others, the must unfair methods of
damaging American poods before they
were offered for sale, was resorted to
by German agents.
All of these activities had for their
purpose the replacing of American
made goods with German-made goods
after the war. Knowing that open
markets far goods made tn Germany
would be restricted by prejudice and
economic Carriers, the Germans
shrewdly calculated to retain Mexico
and also South, American countries
where possible, as their trade zone.
Since Europe has been practically
eliminated from the Mexican trade
during the war Mexico has learned
to depend upon the United States for
many things previously purchased
abroad . This has tended to overcome
certain prejudices against American
made goods and merchandise in this
country than in Europe. This condi
tion did not extend to all lines of
trrje, for the United States has lone
controlled the machinery and grocery
supply business of Mexico. But dress
es, perfumes, art goods and clothing
to some extent have been bought
abroad and the "Made in France" or
"Made in Germany" products were
preferred before the war.
An effort was also made by Ger
man mining men to obtain control of
the vast storehouses of metals in Mex
ico. A company was organized, hav
ing its headquarters in Germany, to
buy up all possible mining properties,
smelter and smelter 'railroads. One
company did gain control, but the
necessity for having a ready market.
prevented the combination from gain
ing control, as It was found that com
peting companies could sell to allied
countries at a large profit becauso
of the war-time demands for metals
and could pay larger salaries and more
wages. This company has since been
sold to persons of non-German blood
At one time the German imperial
government was reported to be direct
ly Interested in a chain of stores
which were established In northern
Mexico, with smaller branches in pros
perous settlements. These stores
were located where Americans were
the most active and the employes al
ways boasted that they were expect
ed to control more trade than than
the Americans. These stores are in
operation now. but have been much
restricted in their commercial activity
during the war, due to the black list
against them and their inability to
get German goods.
A phase of the German trade propa
ganda was shown in Mexico during
the recent influenza epidemic. Drugs
were restricted foi importation to
Mexico until the epidemic swept over
the republic. Then it was modified.
In the meantime Germans arranged,
throufA Spanish or other neutrals, to
buy quantities of drugs, which they of
fered for sale during the epidemic.

were showing their friendship in this
way. while the Americans were keep

Reprinted from Journal of Co
The necessity of a nation-wide
thrift, economy and efficiency cam
paign is urged by William Guggen
heim, a trustee of the American de
fense society, in a statement warning
of the dangers of unwarranted exten
sion of credit. Mr. Guggenheim says:
"In a very recent pamphlet issued
by a prominent banking institution.
the nation is warned of the danger of
inflation. As not only the United
States but the entire world has under
gone tremendous currency inflation
through the use of paper since the
world war began some four years ago,
it seems that it is rather late to warn
the nation of such danger. Warning
should have been given some time
ago. In 'Our Republic Triumphant.'
an American defense society book
which 1 prepared, this warning has
already been sounded. What the na
tion should be warned against is not
inflation but further inflation.
"We now propose to further under
take a campaign of thrift, economy
and efficiency. Our purpose is to warn
the nation of the peril of continued
extravagance which unfortunately
can be land is being) encouraged by
an unwarranted extension of credit.
Credit should be restricted wherever
possible and should be used exclu
sively for war purposes. Taxation
should be adjusted so that profiteer
ing is prevented. Large profits
through continued high prices should
not be allowed by it; they should be
largely absorbed by the government.
In that way only can the government
assist in the campaign about to be un
dertaken by us.
"Inflation is unfortunately little un
derstood by the public and I am sor
ry to say that comparatively few
bankers seem able to grasp this sim
ple problem. Inflation is nothing
more than an unwarranted extension
of credit and good banking judgment
is necessary to determine what un
warranted extension means. There
are three ways in which inflation is
brought about:
"First, by legislation whiqh per
mits extension of credit through the
banks; second, by the banks taking
advantage of such legislation and ex
tending the credit; and third, by the
public making use of the credit if fav
ored by legislation and the banks. It
Is needless to say that given an op
portunity, the public generally takes
advantage of all credit extended.
The world is now confronted by
an abnormal condition in regard to
gold production. The price of labor
and commodities has risen to such
an extent that the cost cf producing
gold is now so high that its produc
tion is being seriously interfered
with. Of course deflation may be
brought about by:
"First, arbitrarily reducing the price
of labor and commodities; second,
making an ounce of gold worth, say
$25 or $30 instead of $20.67 its pres
ent value, Neither of these methods
is wise, nor would either be accept
able to the public, but some means
must be devised to correct the pres
ent unfortunate situation.
"Many gold mines cannot continue

to produce gold under present condi
tions. Of course, the government
can. take over many of t the mining
properties and in that 'way absorb
their losses; such a procedure encour
ages paternalism to too great an ex
tent ', in fact, paternalism has already
gone beyond safe limits. If the gov
ernment took over mining properties
and met with losses it would be
obliged to cautiously and gradually
readjust conditions, as it would be
Possibly it would be wise for the
government to encourage gold pro
duction either by granting a tempor
ary royalty or through exemption of
the payment of taxes.
"It may be pertinent to state here
that in theory gold is absolutely ines
sential in carrying on our banking
system, but the disuse of it requires a
degree of intelligence in the banking
community that is almost impossible
to secure. In other words, the bank
er would be thrown entirely on his
judgment of character in dealing with
individuals demanding credit; further
the situation . would entail a knowl
edge of political and economical con
ditions which it would be almost im
possible for him to possess.
"Gold is used, therefore, as it
serves as a barometer and this proves
a splendid guide for bankers in car-1
rvinz out their financial fenerations
Therefore, the discontinuance of gold !
as the basis of our credit system can
not be thought of. The present ser- j
ious financial and economic condition j
can be corrected. No matter what is I
done, however, it is impossible for us j
to ecape the readjustment which is
necessary on account of the frightful

'James Robinson, 821 Rowley street,

unwise to permit continued losses,
cy. We should bear in mind that
aside from sending men to the front,
the nation has made absolutely no
sacrifices worth mentioning, up to the
present time. We might still be con
sidered justly as an extravagant and
improvident people. Why, then,
should such a campaign - not bo
launched immediately and with all
the vigor and intelligence that we can
apply to it?
"We must recall that in the period
of reconstruction after the Civil war
the nation went ahead from 1S66 to
1S70 by leaps and bounds. The resuk
was the panic of 1870 which was pos
sibly as severe a panic as we ever ex
perienced. 1 hope that it is net the
; intention of the democratic party to
continue an unwise financial policy
during its further tenancy; if it does,
the nation will ere long enter into
a frightful industrial depression and
the party will be forced to "vacate at
the end of its present term in dis
grace. Furthermore, the paternalism
resulting from war conditions, having
already reached unsafe limits, will, if
not checked .automatically precipi
tate socialism in its most dangerous
form.
"Another problem that of inter
nationalism will shortly confront j
this country as a result of the war.
Internationalism will no doubt be ad- i
vocated by some banking interests,
whose scle patriotism consists in
bond flotations, that is to say, those
who decide to sell bonds simply for
the profit and commission made by
the N transaction. The campaign,
'America for Americans,' must event- J
ually be made. Such a slogan repre- j
sents an honest, and wholesome na-,
tionalism that any other government
should respect; the ouly slogan for
internationalists to support should
read, 'For Liberty, Righteousness and
Justice; for International Morality
and Decency.' j
"Let me restate that in thrift, econ-1
omy. and efficiency lies the 'Road to
Peace,' and that there can be no !
peace save through unmistakable vic-j
tory."

CRUMBLING POLES
LAST REMNANT OF
COMPANY'S FOLLY
These Relics Tell Story of
Western Union's Attempt
to Girdle World With Its
Wire Lines
WHITE HORSE. Y. T.. Nov. 1.
(By Mail). Here and there along the
basin to the Yukon river are a few
crumbling poles, believed to be about
the only remaining visible remnants
of a great futile project launched by
the Western Union Telegraph com
pany, over half a century ago to con
nect New York and London with a
telegraph line across Alaska. - the
Bhering straits and Siberia.
When the project was launched, in
1SG3, the first of the Atlantic cables
had been laid, but had not proven
much of a surcess. Before the tele
graph enterprise got well under way,
however, another cable had been
laid across the ocean and had worked
satisfactorily. So the telegraph line
plan was dropped after, it has been
said, it cost about $3,000,000 and sev
eral lives and much time had been
wasted upon it.
Thousands of miles of the route se
lected for the telegraph' line lay
through country which, at that time,
was wholly unexplored. It was plan
ned to build the line north from San
Francisco, across J ritis!i Columbia
and down the Yukon river basin of
Alaska to a point on the Bhering
straits. Here it was to cross on
buoys or anchored boats and connect
with a line to be built eastward from
Petrograd. then St. Petersburg, by the
Russian government.
The task got but a little way be
yond the surveying and experimental
stage. Climatic conditions were stud
led, experimental lines were built In
Alaska and Siberia and surveys were
made on both continents. It has been
said tha the trans-Siberian railroad,
when it was built later, followed many
of the survey lines set out by the
American telegraph corps.
Members of the surveying parties
sent north suffered many hardships.
One of the leaders, Robert Kennicott,
head of the scientific corps, died at
Uulato, Alaska, from exposure. An
other member, George Kennan, wJio
made many surveys for the lino in
Siberia, later became well known as
a traveler and lecturer. William D.
Hall, who succeeded Kennecott. as
head of the corps, wrote a book of
his finding lake Le Barge, a widen
ing of the Yukon river, between here
and Dawson, was named after Mich
ael Le Barge, a member of the expe
dition. Although the telegraph survey part
ies did not accomplish what they set
out to do, they did, by their findings,
add much to the knowledge the out
side world then had of Alaska. One
point they definitely settled was that

troppers of the Hudson Bay company,

spoke of as the Kwipak.

of wheat stored along the wharves to
be sold some of these days, probably
back to Argentina, at prices much
above cost.
When the allied wheat convention
was signed, there was a scarcity of
grain sacks in Argentina. They could
not be bought at any price within
reason. Most of them had been care
fully packed away in German ware
bouses. As soon as the wheat con
vention was signed and people began
to turn their attention to buying
wheat, the Germans kept out of whaat
pits and devoted all their energies to
buying sacks. They bought the en
tire outputs of the few Argentine fac
tories and then they began cornering
the sack market in Uruguay.
This enabled the German agents to
control the sale to the allies of a part
of Argentina's wheat crop.

ing company promoter, who was con
nected with several Arizona ventures,
in which local people were Interested,
is related in the following from the
Los Angeles Times:
"Harry Lefco. sometimes known as
Harry Lefkovits, who was arrested
here for alleged misuses of the mails
in New York in connection with the
sale of stock in the Magma Mines
company, which had property of sup
positions value at Superior, Arts.,

Ariz., after some experience In the

his brother, Lewis, operated two small
clothing stores in Phoenix and in Mi
ami, Ariz. These establishments had

"His tirst venture was to secure an
option on a large block of the stock
of the Inspiration-Needles " Mining
company of Miami, from Georgo J.
gtcntman'tof Phoenix, Da Williamson
of Globe, and others, it is said. The
property itself appears to have been

near a natural formation known as the
Needles. Most of the loose stock ap
pears to have been floated in Phoenix,
at prices that ranged from 25 cents to
$1.60. Eventually, when the market
failed, the option was forfeited. The
stock is not even Quoted today.
"A letter and parallel scheme, on
much the same plan, was the Miami
Consolidated, which had a number of
claims close to the Miami property in
the same camp.
"Lefco is understood to have clean

SAFEGUARDING OF
MINERALS PROVIDED
FOR IN NEW ORDER
PRESIDENT SIGNS EXECUTIVE
ORDER WHICH HAS IMPORTANT
BEARING ON MINERAL LIFE OF
ARIZONA, PARTICULARLY
AROUND TOMBSTONE
Probably nothing of so great im
portance to southern Arizona and
more particularly the district around
Tombstone has come over the wires
from Washington in many months as
the following dispatch:
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19. Presi
dent Wilson has signed an executive
order placing all the details of the
new mine development bill n the.
hands of Secretary of the Interior
Lane. To himself he reserved the
fixing of the terms and degrees of the
tariff protection against the impor
tation of metals in competition with
those produced in the United Slates.
This procedure means that potash,
magnesite, pyrites, chrome and .other
metals which Arizona can produce in
larg j quantities will not be driven out
of the market after peace comes by
low priced German and European ores
and metals. ,
r
Before the war Germany and other
European countries absolutely domi
nated this trade and fixed the price
of these metals and chemicals so that
western states could not afford to
compete, and when 4he war came
there were no domestic supplies until
the stifled industry could be gotten
under way by government help under
the spur of war.
The new mine stimulation bill
which will thus protect and develop
a permanent industry, will make an
American market safe for the min
eral products which have heretofore
been blighted by low priced foreign
competition, and it is the plan of the
government to arrange the details
of its enforcement to make the pro
tection permanent by means of a
tariff that will bar out all foreign
competition.
After the signing of the executive
order by the president, a conference
was held in the bureau of mines of
the interior department, where the
various interests were represented,
including many men representing the
practical side of the mining industry.
The American mining congress and
the geological survey were also repre
sented as well as the department of
agriculture, and the various details
were presented and discussed with
a view to drawing workable regula
tions that will stimulate the produc
tion of all the minerals enumerated
in the measure.
Ai soon as a shortage of any of
these minerals is officially reported
to the president through the secre
tary of the interior, the government
will buy the available supplies, and
then, in order to protect the govern
ment ownership of that product, the
president will promulgate a tariff to
protect the supply against the inroads
of foreign competition.
Those who attended the meeting
were confident that the new law and
regulations will put the production
of all these minerals and chemicals
on a permanent and profitable basis.

SAN PAULO, Brazil, Oct. 29. The
j British Chamber of Commerce in San
Paulo has undertaken to encourage
the largest possible number-of Brit
ish concerns to come to Brazil to
compote against its own members.
Thl policy was announced after the
last annual meeting, following a dis
cussion as to whether U British
Chamber of Commerce exists for the
benefit of its own members or for
the benefit of the British empire.
Tnani van Hlttnr anlaDnnlam at
first to this policy, members of the
chamber arguing that it wou'.J spoil
their chances to have other British
firms established in Brazil. Those in
favor of the new policy argued that
they would have to face strenuous
competition in Brazil after the war
no matter what they do now and said
they preferred to compete with fellow
Britishers in the common cause of
out-competing other nations rather
than to fight alone the German, Amer
ican and Japanese competition re
garded as certain to follow the cessa
tion of hostilities.
It was then decided to devote pref
erential energy to helping other Brit
ish concerns establish in Brazil in
advance of other nationalities.

SO-GALLED SHOCK IS
CAUSED BY BAD BLOOD
FLOW FROM WOUND
INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN
LABORATORIES IN REAR OF

LACY OF SOME THEORIES FOR
MERLY HELD
AMERICAN ARMY LABORATORY,
Franre, Nov. 10. (Correspondence
of the Associated Tress.) Tte mys
terious collapse like that of approach
ing death which is suffered by sol
diers suffering extreme shock trotn
shell wounds is being investigated
here. . A noted research scientist from
Harvard is conducting the Inquiry.
The first and natural conclusion was
that the collapse was due to the shock
to the nerves. Put the experiments
now going on here do not appear to
bear out that conclusion. On the
contrary, animals badly wounded In
the foreleg or thigh showed the full
effect of shock until the wounded
member bad a turniquet bound
tightly around the limb just above
the wound. This cut off the flow of
blood from the wounded part to the
rest of the body. Following this the
shock effect immediately subsided, as.
shown fcy the delicate instruments
which recorded each second's pulsa
tions. And the shock effrt rose
again immediately when the band
was loosened.
From this the research was grad
ually making clear that the mysteri
ous shock effect had a direct physical
connection with the flow of blood
from the- wounded part, and was not
an effect of the nerves.
The two animals on which this ex
perimental research was being con
ducted were tinder the effect of
c-ther, so there was no pain.
In the operation room here autop
sies and examinations are being made
of skin tissues and organs affected
by gas attacks. Some of these at
tacks had occurred only eight daysi
before so that the parts showed the
full effect of this destructive agency.!
In the lecture room a demonstra-l
tlon was being given on spinal men-,
lnglth. I
"At one time there were more ,
deaths in the British army from that ,
cause than from the fighting," s.id ;
the escort, "and as th disease can do '
mora damage at times than the boche
It is quite essential to trace Its '
causes and deal with it before It gets
under way." j

LONDON. Oct. 29. The after-war
business problem receiving the most
Important attention at present in Eng
land Is that of the control of raw ma
terials and shipping, says a statement
issued by the American Chamber of
Commerce In London. It adds: "De
tailed studies of sources and methods
of control and distribution are being
made, but there does not yfet appear
to be agreement on the general prin
ciples of control. On the one hanJ.
powerful interests are urging immedi
ate co-operation between Great Brit
ain, France and the l'nite-1 States, for
the formation of a world-control whicb
will, at the appropriate time, be able
to disribute raw materials as seems
best. On the other hand, some are
pointing out that such action would
in principle be contrary to President
Wilson's policy of no economic com
bination within the League of Na
tions.' "World arrangements are already
being made with the sanction and
even the assistance of the British
government in regaid to oil and
metals, while shipplu r puns change
or develop dally. The American
Chamber of Commerce in London has
urged commercial bodies in America
to consider the entire subject."
BUENOS AIRES, Oct. 29. (Corre
spondence of the Associated Press.)
Argentina has taken the lead in an
effort to persuade the South Ameri
can republics to tear down their tariff
walls' and open themselves to free
trade among themselves, arguing that
such action would make them com
mercially independent of other coun
tries in Europe and North America.
This step has been taken in spits of
the fact that until now the Argentine's
principal source has been its customs
houses.
To show the sincerity, the Argentine
government has introduced a bill in
congress providing for the opening of
diplomatic negotiations with all the
aeighborlng countries for the adop
tion of treaties providing for the free
exchange of the products of each
country concerned.
If the desire of Argentina is to
remove the fiscal barriers which in
the past have estranged the nations
of South America and restricted com
merce between them, making them
dependent on overseas nations. ,
A year's trial of free trade with
Peru has led Argentina to seek sim
ilar arrangements with the other re
publics. The Peruvian legation in
Buenos Aires and the Argentine con
sulate in Lima have acted as com
mercial agents for their respective
countries with the result that, today
there is a regular trade of wheat,
flour and cereals to Peru in ex
change tor cotton, rice and sugar
from Peru.
It Is expected that Chile will be the
next republic to ratify a free trade
treaty.
The operations of the Consolidated
Arizona Smelting company for the
month of October, , resulted in mairr
taining approximately the same out
put as for several months past, 1.200.
000 pounds of copper.

An invention involving the applica
tion of the gyroscope in determining
the position of a ship independently
of observations on the sun or stars,
and another designed to perfect the
accuracy of machine gun fire from
moving airplanes were reported by
Prof. O. L. Leuschner, chairman of the
committee. Public mention of the re
sults of the committee's work in chem
istry was withheld.
Prof. H. M. Hall in his report on
the tubbed discovery, said:
"For two months the writer carried
on field surveys in eight western
states in order to make estimates o
the tonnage and distribution of rub
ber carrying shrubs and to gather
samples for chemical analysis. The
results indicate that the total amount
of rubber present is much greater
than we formerly supposed, although
the percentage content of the shrubs
is perhaps less over much of the area
covered.
"Four of our experimental plots in
eastern California have been studied
and evidence obtained which indicates
that it will be necessary to destroy
the plants in order to harvest the rub
ber. On the other hand, a method is
being developed which gives promise
of increasing the weight of the rub
ber carrying portions. This method
will be particularly applicable if the
plants are brought under cultivation.
"In order to get an expert opinion
on the quality of the product 25
pounds of shrub were sent to Dr. D.
Spence. chairman of the sub-committee
on rubber and allied substances
of the national research council. Aft
er some months, during which time
deterioration probably took place, the
rubber was separated by the ordinary
mechanical means and 3 per cent of
pure rubber obtained. This was tested
and reported upon as of 'high grade
and average quality not as good as
the fine Par , but a great deal bet
ter than most African low grade rub
bers.' Dr. Spence also reported that
'the rubber vulcanizes ' readily, and
gives a produce of very fine quality.'
"It is proposed to continue the work
during the winter months and to sub
mit a detailed report for publication
in the spring of 1919."
KING GEORGE TAKES
JAUNT IN WHIPPET
LONDON, Oct. 31. Riding in a jolt
ing "whippet" tank. King George on a
visit to a British training camp, took
part in a sham battle in which 15
tanks made an attack, aided by air
planes dropping bombs, smoke
screens and machine gunning. The
route was over broken ground and in
cluded a fairly steep slope, ditches
and several sharp turnings. Finally
the tanks cleared a trench with their
machine guns. Then they wheeled into
line, halted at the edge of a ditch,
and by their final dip provided what
looked like a salute to the king.
