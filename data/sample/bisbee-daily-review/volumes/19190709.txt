Twenty-five Warrants Are Expected to
Be Served Today in Deportation Cases
Several hundred Cochise county
citizens who have been expecting from
hour to hour to be served with a war
rant from the sheriff's office are still
on the axious seat awaiting further
developments on the charge of con
spiracy growing out of their alleged
participation in the deportations of
July 12. 1917.
County Attorney French stated yes
terday that It was his intention to file
the complaints in Justice Winters
court at Lowell, but as Judge Winters
is disqualified from sitting on the
cases and Judge Allison of Bisbee is
also disqualified, due to the fact that
lie is a witness before the federal in
vestigating committee, so that the
complaints will have to be filed either
at Tombstone or Douglas. As a mat
ter of convenience to those concerned
they will probably be filed in Douglas
before Judge W. C. Jacks of the justice
court.
It is not known the exact number
of complaints that have been prepared,
nor when they will be filed, but from
every Indication of activiiy in the
county attorney's office they may be
sent to Douglas today.
It is understood that about twenty
five of the complaints will be filed
first and then bunches of from fifty to
seventy-five will probably be filed ajt
OF SEN. NEI
PLEADS INSANITY
LOS ANGELES, July 8.1 An autop
sy held today on the body of Frieda
Lesser, who was shot and killed here
by Harry S. New last Saturday, dis
closed that the gin was i.ot expect
ant of motherhood as New said in
his first statement to the police.
A charge of murder in the first de
gree was filed against New. New
shot and killed Miss Lesser to whom
he had secured a license to wed the
day .before the shooting, and then
drove her body to the police station
in his mother's automobile. Rela
tives have caused him to be examined
by alienists with the intention of in
terposing an insanity defense, it was
said.
His mother, Mrs. Lulu Burger, is on
the way from Indianapolis to direct
his defense and before leaving said
she would call on United States Sen
ator New, who she and the defendant
claim, is the latter's father, to aid
in the defense.
Following an autopsy and inquest
over the body of Frieda Lesser, his
fiancee, who he admits he slew at a
lonely spot in Topango canyon, near
here, last Friday night, Harry S. New,
who claims to be the son of United
States Senator Harry S. New of Indi
ana, was arraigned before Justice ot
the Peace Howard Hinshaw late to
day on a charge of first degree mur
der He will plead next Monday morn
ing.
Although county autopsy surgeon
A. F. Wagner failed to include in his
report whether the young woman was
expectant of motherhood, Dr. A. O
Sawyer, a physician retained by New's
attorney, John Richardson, after ex
amining the body in Dr. Wagner's
presence, declared such was the case,
Dr. Wagner refused to confirm or de
ny the truth of Dr. Sawyer's findings.
New said Miss Lesser told him she
was about to become the mother ot
his child, and that instead of marry
ing him as he said she had promised
she was going to have a surgical op
eration performed. When she told
him this, he says. It angered him
so he shot her.

of a republican government in Ire
land," Edward F. Dunn, former gov

American delegates sent abroad by
the Irish societies of America to. in

arrival here today on the steamer La
Savoie.
With Mr. Dunn came Frank P.
Walsh, another of the delegates, who
also issued a statement predicting
early success of the "Irish republic
cause.
Given Enthusiastic Reception
The two delegates,- who were pre
ceded to the United States by sev
eral weeks by Michael F. Ryan, the
third member of the mission, were
given an enthusiastic reception by a
crowd of several hundred persons.
The reception was attended by the
waving of American and "Irish repub

"We are satisfied that our mission

said.
Irish Case Before Peace Conference
"The case of Ireland before tb

England Flayed in Irish Attitude
"We went to Ireland and thus were
able to give to President Wilson, the
American commission and to the
wrorld, a' true unvarnished story of
English atrocities and military mis
rule in Ireland. Wte compelled the

"We compelled them to admit that

"We have plainly shown to the

"We are confident of the outcome.

other things from the captain's bridge,
the majestic naval spectacle in his honor
and waving' and bowing acknowledge
ments at the great 'guns of the dread

Ships Wig-Wag Message of Welcome
Wig-wagged from the battleship Penn
sylvania, the flagship of the commander
of the Atlantic fleet, upon which were
cabinet officials and members of con
gress to welcome him home, was this
message from Ice-President Marshall:
Vice-President's Speech of Welcome
"Mr. President: We, who are saluting
you. are only the advance guard of that
vast army of your fellow countrymen
who joyfully welcome you to the home
land. . not to the , hours of rest which
your arduous efforts so Justly entitle
you. but in health of body and strength
of mind to assist in the solution of those
vexing and intricate internal problems
arising out of the world war so happily
now concluded; to congratulate you upon
the auspices ending of your epoch-mak
ing mission and your possession while
at the peace table of that rare blending
of vision and common sense which en
abled you to get all you could and not
to see anything you could not get; and
to renew our pledge of loyalty and serv
ice so long as you shall continue to
stand for the glory, the perpetuity and
the manifest destiny of the republic."
Naval Pageant Impressive
At 8 o'clock this morning, the presi
dential fleet passed lightship NY-2. 28
miles east of Ambrose channel. The
weather was clear and bracing, with the
sea lightly rippled, the sky clear, and a
cool southeasterly breeze blowing the
same ideal weather that has followed the
president across the ocean.
At 9 o'clock six black spots high In
the air came in sight off Ahead. Soon
they gave in size and gave a hoarse roar
a? the outlines of six big naval hydro-
airplanes came into view bringing first
greeting from land. They wheeled and
circled over the ship, their pilots wav
ing welcomes.
Toward 10 o'clock the fleet of dread
naughts and destroyers to meet the
president was sighted. It was a stirring
scene as they came on perfectly aligned
with the dreadnuughts in double column
and the destroyers stretching away as
far as the eye could see.

salute while long lines of white clad sail
ors manned the rails and decks.
President's Reception on Landing
President Wilson returned to the I'nl
ted States and in his first speech de
livered on American soil since the peace
treaty was signed, declared that the
peace concluded at Tarls- "was a just
peace, which, if It can le preserved, will
safeguard the world from unnecessary
bloodshed."
The only reference the president made
to his political opponents was when In
referring to the negotiations at Faris, he
iald:
Raps Political Opponents
"I am afraid some people, some per
sons, do not understand that vision. They
do not see it. They looked too much
upon the ground. They have thought too
much of the Interests that were near
them, and they have not listened to the
voices of their neighbors. I have never
had a moment's doubt as to where the
heart and purpose of this people lay."
10,000 School Children Welcome Him
The president arrived at the Hoboken
army pier shortly before 3 o'clock. The
army transport George Washington, on
which he sailed from Brest was escorted
up the bay by the battleship Pennsyl
vania and more than a score of destroy
ers and smaller naval craft. On the New
Jersey shore, the state which first honor
ed Mr. Wilson with a political office,
were massed 10.000 school children who
welcomed the chief executive of the na
tiou to the strains of the national an
them. Greeted by City Officials
Through the lines of the children all
dressed in white, the president passed
to the ferry which carried him to the

to Carnegie hall, a distance of about
three miles, the presidential party pass
ed through streets lined with cheering
thousands of men, women lfhd children
who thronged the sidewalks and filled
ever' available window and roof top.
Rained With Confetti
From the upper windows of the busi
ness skyscrapers great showers of con
fetti rained upon the president and Mrs.
Wilson, literally millions of scraps of
paper floating through the air carrying
this motto. "Everybody's business. To
stand by our government: to help the
soldier get a job. To help crush Bol
shevism." Marines Head Procession
The head of the precession was formed
by several companies of soldiers and ma
rines, followed by some hundreds of sail
ors. Immediately preceding the presi
dential car was aa automobile filled with
secret service men. and the car Itself was
guarded by the president's personal liody
guard of four picked men.
Greets Factory Workers
In the car with President Wilson were
Mrs. Wilson, Governor Smith' and Mayor
Hylan. The president remained standing,
raising his hat so constantly tn response
to the wave of cheering which rolled
along the route of march. At one point
on Twenty-third street, opposite a
large factory building, the windows of
which were filled with girl workers, the
president seized an American Tag and
waved it vigorously In acknowledgment
of the girl' cheering.
A couple of hundred automobiles, car
rying cabinet members, a congressional
delegation and representatives of the
state and civil government besides dip
lomatic representatives of the allied na
tions, completed the procession.
Police Keep Crowd Back
Several hours before the president's ar
rival at Carnegie hall every seot In the
building was occupied and the police
had difficulty in keeping back the thou
sands who tried to force a way into the
hall.
Cabinet Members on Platform
As the president stepped from his auto
mobile a massed naval and military band
played "The Star Spangled Banner,"
while the military escort presented arms.
Mr. Wilson was preceded to the" stage by
Vice-President and Mrs Marshall, form
er Speaker Champ Clark, and Samuel
Gompers, president of the American
Federation of Labor, all of whom were
recognized and cheered by the crowd.
Ten Minute Ovation Given
The president's appearance on . the
platform was the signal for an ovation
which lasted some minutes, ending when
the band broke into the strains of "Over
There." There was a sudden pause when
an officer in British uniform unexpect
edly appeared on the platform. Mr. Wil
son jumped to his feet and crossed the
stage to meet him and the cheering broke
out in redoubled volume as the word
flashed through the hall that the stranger
was MaJ. G. H. Scott, commander of
the , British trans-Atlantic dirigible
R-34.
Welcoming Speeches Given
Brief welcoming speeches were made
by Rodman Wananaaker, Mayor Hylan
and Governor Smith. The latter ' Intro
duced the president as the bearer of a
peace treaty "worthy of the honor, dig
nity and majesty of this great coun
try." When Mr. Wilson stepped to the front
of the stape the bond again began play
ing the national anthem, but was drown
ed in the cheers of the several thousand
men and women In the audience.
Mr. Wilson waa obviously under the
strain of deep emotion when he began to
speak and his voice was noticeably
hoarse. He said:
Fellow Countrymen:

McManis, for whose death the Villa
Zapata convention government paid to
the widow $27,000 at the request or
Secretary of State Bryan.
The attention of the state depart
ment has been attracted to an adver
tisement appearing in American news
papers urging Americans with claims
to present them to the commission es
tablished 21 months ago in Mexico
City.
Officials of the state department
6aid that Americans should present
their claims only through the state
department.
Baker Calls an
Officious Colonel
NEW YORK. July 8. Secretary of
War Baker introduced himself to one
of his colonels while assisting Presi
dent Wilson's debarkation from the
transport George Washington today in
a manner that probably will help the
ofMcer remember his chief for many
a day.
Mr. Baker wan chatting with a group
of reporters at the gang plank when
the colonel hurried forward and giving
the secretary a brusque push, said:
"You can't stand here. You must
get behind, the barrier with the rest.
This passage way must be kept clear."
"I happen to be the secretary of
war," Mr. Baker answered in icy
tones, "and these gentlemen are my
fnonds, who have been all day with
the official party. I think we will re
main." They did. The colonel, who grew
very red in the face , saluted and
DID NOT.
El Paso Chamber
Adopts Resolutions
EL PASO, July 8. "We urge upon
our government some dt-finite correc
tive action," says a resolution adopted
tonight by the directors of the El Paso
chamber of commerce regarding con
ditions in Mexico.
This is urged, the resolution declares
"without bitterness toward the Mexi
can people, but with an unselfish de
sire to assist them to end the reign
of terror that in undermining her na
tional life." The text or Mexico's
latest coHHtitution. the resolution de
dares, is "significant of the Mexican
federal sovernnlent's anti-American
policy," which hns ben given expres
sion through Its president on many oc
casion." The preamble ' of the resolution
paints a gloomy condition of affairs in
Mexico, describes the acts of outlaws
against foreigners, especially Ameri
cans, ami declares the Mexican people
themselves are the chief sufferers un
der the "chaotic conditions which have
seriously raenared the moral and
economic fabric of the entire republic
and caused untold loss of life and
property."

RAISE PUT THRU
PHOENIX, July 8. The corporation
commission will hold a hearing July 15
on the application of the Arizona
Southern railroad for permission to
raise its rates approximately 25 per
cent, or up to the point to which rates
were raised on all roads under federal
control.
The company sets forth in its com
plaint that its business is 95 per cent
with the Silver Bell Mines and the
Sasco smelter; that the road's rates
were raised along with others, but
that when the road was turned back
by the government the rates fell.
The railroad complaint states the
company's loss during 1918 was f7,

LEVY BIG TAX
BERLIN, July 8. (B ythe Associat
ed Press.) Addressing the German
national assembly at Weimar today,
Matthais Erzberger, vice chancellor
and minister of finance, said:
"One of the first requirements rela
tive to the restoration of the life of
labor is the establishment of orderly
finances. I will have nothing to do
with suggestions for the annulment
of war loans or a declaration of gen
eral bankruptcy. My highest aim is
to establish justice in the entire taxa
tion system. The income from capital
must be taxed more heavily than the
income from work. An inheritance
tax and a heavy tax levy on property
will be the initial step that will be
taken. The empire's income mast be
increased 900 per cent and that of in
dividual states and communes perhaps
100 per cent. Such enormous changes
require fresh measures."

rule for immediate consideration of
prohibition enforcement legislation, in
dicated sufficient votes to enact the
measure without the" twelve huors of

But despite this big majority and
the promises by Chairman oVlstead of
the promises by Chairman Volstead of
time set might not be used indications
tonight were that a vote on the bin
itself will not be reached this week.
Every effort was made today by anti-
prohibition members to delay consid
eration by claims of no quorum, de
mands for roll calls and by forcing the
reading, word by word, of the printed
text of the bill.
Less than two of the twelve hours
for debate had -been 'used when the
house adjourned to resume considera

dar day.
No attempt was made today to split
the bill so as to take out the first
part relating .solely to enforcement of
war time prohibition' with a view to
its early passage. This, however, will
be done later, and while members
ngnting for modification of repeal of
the war time act are hopelessly in the
minority, they announced their deter
mination to keep on fighting until the

"I have really, though I have tried on

with feelings that it would be vain for
me to try to express that I ffhd myself

generous welcome that they extended to
me a3 your representative on the other

"It was still further softened by the
pride that I had in discovering that
America had at last convinced the world
of her true character.
America the Generous

with their own eyes what America had
done for the world. They had deemed her
selfish. They had deemed her devoted to

which yiey '"nrHved when they had en

Flower of America Was Sent Over
"And then I had the added pride of
j finding- out by personal observation the
kind of men we had sent over. I had
crossed the acas with the kind of men
who had taken them over, without whom
they could not have got to Europe, and
then when I got there I saw that army
of men. that army of clean men, that
army I was glad to point out and say
these are my fellow countrymen.'
American Spirit Impressive
"It softens the homesickness- a good
deal to have so much of home along with
you, and these boys were constantly re
minding me of home. They did not walk
the streets like anybody else. I do not
mean that they walked the streets self
assertively. They did not. They walked
the streets as if they knew that they be
longed wherever free men lived, that
they were welcome in the great republic
of France and- were comrades with the
other armies-that had helped to win the
great battle and to make the great sac
rifice. Because it ia a wonderful thing
for this nation, hitherto isolated from the
large affairs of the world to win not
' only the universal confidence of the peo
ple of. the world, but their universal af
fections. -
American Troops a Guarantee of Right
"And that, and nothing else than that,
is what has happened Wherever It was
suggested that troops should be s-nt and
it was desired .that troops of occupation
should excite no prejudice, no uneasiness
on the part of those to whom they were
sent,, the men who represented the oth
er nations came to me and asked me to
send American soldiers. They not only
implied, but they said, that the presence
of American soldiers would be known
not to mean anything except friendly
protection and -assistance. Do you won
der that it made our hearts swell with
pride to realize these things?
Glad to be Home at Last .
"But while these things in some degree
softened my homesickness, they made me
all the more eager to get home, where
the rest of the folk live; to get homo
where the great dynamo of national en
ergy was situated; to get home where
the great purpose of national action were
formed and to be allowed to take part in
the council and . in the actions which
were formed, and to be taken by this

great capacity or a small capacity, to
take part in the counsels and in the reso
lutions of a people like this. I am

BUTTE, Mont.. July 8. The "one
big union" convention, holding its final
session here today, chose Great Falls,
Mont., as the place for the next con-
vention, which will be held before
October. At that time it Is planned
to effect a permanent national organi
zation, it was announced.
A resolution demanding that the
"United States government immediate
ly withdraw troops from. Russia and
recognize the soviet government of
Kusssia was carried. C. V. Ilustin,
an official of the United Mine Work
era of America, addressed the conven
tion and predicted failure for the "one
big union" movement, stating that the
idea was not new and that its failure
was already a matter of history in the
archives of organized labor. He was
interrupted several times by open ex
pressions of disapproval and ridicule.
The convention was called. by the
Metal Mine Workers Union No. 1 of
America of Butte, an Independent or
ganization of which Tom Campbell is
the head. The sessions began Sunday.

World was represented by a commit
tee and members of the organization
took a prominent part in the session.
Industrial Workers of the World or
ganizers from outside of this state
also were present.
The "one big union, as outlined in
the meeting here, provides a plan for
collective bargaining, the demands of
cne labor group to be supported by
every other ,and the general strike to
constitute a weapon to force compli
ance on the part of the employers.
Throughout all of the sessions of
the convention antagonism was ex
pressed toward the American Federa
tion of Labor, some of the speakers de
nouncing that organization In the most
spirited terms.
The delegates represented unions in
Butte, Great Falls, Livingstown. Miles
City and Lewistown. Points in Oregon,
Idaho, Washington and Arizona were
also represented by a few delegates.
Most of the men seated In the conven
tion were metal or coal miners.
Among the leaders in the movement
here are Canadians more or less prom
inently Identified with the I. W. W.
movement in Canada.
The leaders of the convention said
they believe that it i9 the beginning
of a movement that is destined to
spread through the United States.

Public Health Service,
It is usually not difficult to keep
comfortable, even in hot weather, pro
vided one observes a few simple pre
cautions. And that the observance of
such precautions is important to keep
in good health is well indicated by
the high death rate among infants
in hot weather. Many of these deaths
are distinctly preventable.
In . summer many mothers still
make the mistake of dressing their
infants too warm. On hot days a thin
muslin slip and a diaper are really
all that is needed. The thick flan
nel bands, the woolen skirt, stockings
and cap can all be omitted. Naturally
the mother should use judgment and
see that baby is Kept sufficiently
warm when the air becomes cooler.
Several tepid baths a day during the
hot spell will do much to keep , the
baby in good health.
But adults, too, should learn how
to keep cool ,in Jimmer. Suitable
light clothing is important. The de
grees of fashion should give way to
tne degrees or good sense. Men would
do well to copy the women and not
hesitate to appear in shirt waists.

cooler tnan dark-colored, and cotton
or linen cooler than woolen.
The question of diet is very im
portant. Just when an engineer keeps
his fire low when there . is no call
for heat, so a sensible person will
reduce the amount of food in his
daily diet. This is a simple "thine to
do in summer, for an abundance or
fresh fruits and vegetables are avail
able from ' which to make ' excellent
tasty meals. Moreover the use of
such food is decidedly beneficial, for
they supply important elements such
as mineral salts and vitamines re
quired by the body. So far as protein
is concerned, crackers an dmilk are
excellent sources of this important
element of food.
A word of caution regarding drink
ing. The drinking of large amounts
of fluid throws extra work on the
body, specially o nthe kidneys and the
skin. It is fust as easy to quench
the thirst with smaller amounts ol
fluid, provided one does not take
large gulps.- Alcoholis beverages
should be avoided as they only in

striking employes of the Denver
Tramway refusing to return to their
posts, under the reduced wage scale,
tne city is endeavoring to cope with
the situation with the issuance ol
more than 300 jitney buss licenses.
uunng tne rusn work hour, twenty
lines were established today and each
passenger hauled for the usual five
cents.
Mayor Dewey C. Bailey declared to
night that the city would take no
side in the controversy. No attempt
will be made to aid the tramway in
the operation of its lines, but the po
lice department has been instructed
to guard against violence.
The strikers stoutly maintain they
will continue the Btrike until their
demands of i0 cents an hour are ad
hered to. Nothing has been suggest
ed so far as a compromise is con
cerned.

across the fact of things.
Nowhere does the bright sunshine of Opportunity glow
with such welcome warmth as in America.
Half the nations of Europe would have to declare a state of bank
ruptcy If they had to -cash in today. They couldn't survive the
shock. They haven't got the goods.
America is about the only nation of importance in the world to
day that rates as a going concern.
So, entirely apart from the matter of love of homeland, America
is the place to be.
Nor only is America the place to be for the big men of financial
power. It is the place for the average man the mechanic, the ship
ping clerk, the farmer.
Take a look at the map of Europe.
ITALY Short of coal, short of raw materials, short of food, short
of employment.
FRANCE one-sixth in ruins, the balance short of raw materials,
short of coal, short of employment, short of food.
ENGLAND Depending on imports for food, short of raw ma
terials, everything unsettled, readjustment of machinery proceeding
slowly, much unemployment.
BELGIUM Brussels, a "show window" where food may be had
at exhorbitant prices; most of the balance of . the country painfully
desolate.
HOLLAND Short of coal, short of food, death and disease rates
higher thaa ever, unemployment general, raw material supply almost
zero.
RUSSIA A massive interrogation point where a bale of money
will buy a loaf of bread if there is any bread to be bought.
GERMANY Defeated, beset by all manner of wolves within and
about to be loaded with an indemnity charge that will keep every
German humping for the next three decades.
AUSTRIA Gone where the woodbine twineth.
POLAND, CZECHO SLOVAKIA, JUNGO-SLAVIA New nations
that must be built from the ground up with supplies largely furnished
from without. -
BULGARIA Submerged and torn by revolution following defeat.
GREECE In fair condition, compared to the rest of Europe, but
in great need of imports.
, There you are. Europe is a blue and gloomy picture. This is no
reflection on any of our allies. They can't help it. They got that
way because they did the right and brave thing. It is the after-suffering
from the great pain of the war. But it is there.
America is the solidest, brightest, homiest., happiest place on
earth.
America owes Europe a duty. It must provide the thiugs they
need in the vast desolation "over there."
But in plain words, that means the busiest kind of an America
and the American people love a busy place.
There is no opportunity of any kind, material, spiritual, concrete
tor abstract, that offers in Europe that cannot be doubled upon the
trebled in America.
Of all places to be, America is THE place. Opportunity to do the
kindly, helpful human healing of the world that is America's. Op
portunity to do what the Yankee calls "get up and get" it is writ
large on the fertile soil of the United States of Uncle Sam.
It Isn't a goose that lays the golden eggs between the Atlantic and
Pacific. It's a wise bird and it is just now facing it's busy season.
EDUCATION'S LIMPING PROGRESS
I.w II. GEORGE D. STAYER, president of the National Educa-
tion Association, says that reports received in advance of the
J Milwaukee convention show that the first results of the cam
paign for increased wages are beginning to make an ade
quate appearance.
New York leads a list of states in increased salary provisions
by establishing a minimum of $1005 and a maximum of $3650 an
nually for city schools and a minimum of $800 for rural districts.
Illinois makes the minimum $700 for 36 weeks, adds a million to her
annual educational appropriation and authorizes local districts to
double the educational tax. Iowa puts the minimum for college grad
uates at $100 a month and $S0 for normal course graduates. Indiana
gives a graded increase of from 25 .to 30 per cent. '
Virginia raised its appropriation for teachers' salaries $800,000
in 1918 and promises more next year. Texas add $2,000,000 annually
for 1918-19 teachers' salaries. South Carolina raises its minimum
wage from $55 to $75 ,the figure also fixed by Oregon. North Dakota.
Oklahoma, Missouri, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, California and
Connecticut also report increased educational appropriations, a part
of which may be used to increase salaries. There is also a list of 191
cities that have in creased salaries during the past year.
For the whole "United States the commissioner of education re
ports that the increase is from an average of $543.31 ia 1915 to
$630.64 in 1918. Even these figures, which are far below what war
time investigation showed to be a living wage, and far less than the
minimum legal wages fixed by several states for factory girls, come
largely fro unities and do not include the much worse conditions in
rural schools.
Educators gathered at the national convention are unanimously
agreed that until this disgraceful condition is changed and teachers
are paid an adequate wage, there can be but a limping progress in
educational matters and but miserable approximation to the needs
of reconstruction and the industrial education which is now so pross
ingly needed.

PHOENIX, July 8. There need be
no fear that the cost of settling her
returned soldiers on farms is going to
take $50,000,000, or any such sum from
Arizona's coffers, said Governor
Compbell tonight, commenting on esti
mates reported made yesterday by of
ficials of the capitol.
"No amount of money that this
proposition might cost would be more
than commensurate with the benefits
and the justice to our fighting men,"
-said the governor, "but the estimates
made by some officials In the capitol
are certainly too high.
"Matching the federal money, dol
lar for dollar, our share of the expense
would be $4,000,000, if the bill now
before congress passes, as expected,
carrying a $200,000,000 appropriation.
Even if- passed as introduced with a
$500,000,000 appropriation, Arizona's
share would be $10,000,000.
"However .there will be no levy for
this purpose this year," Governor
Campbell continued, "although the ul
timate settlement of the question will
be up to the state land board, and un
doubtedly will be discussed at its next
meeting.
"Considering the probable lateness
of the passage of the soldiers' settle
ment bill by congress and the length
of time it will take the government to
make the necessary appropriation to
begin spending these large sums of
money, I do not believe there will be
any necessity for a tax levy in Ari
zona for this purpose during the cur
rent year."
SOLDIERS GUARD BUSINESS

DOUGLAS, July 8. Considerable
speculation and some excitement was
caused this morning when people
came downtown and found partols of
soldiers, carrying guns and full field

and qther important places in the bus

trouble began to fly thick and fast
As a matter of fact, the presence
of the soldiers had no significance
whatever. It was merely a problem in
strategy being worked out under
command of Col. W. H. Hawkins,
camp commander. Plans of defense
are constantly being worked out the

thousands sacks .of sand and crushed
rock were piled along the north side
of the vest approach to the bridge
to lessen the pressure and divert the
water, and this saved the situation.
Yesterday morning the vicinity of
the bridge was a solid lake of water
for a distance of more than a quarter
of a mile, or from hill to hill. It
looked like the Mississippi river at St.
Louis when the banks are full. And
in some places it was fifteen feet

AERO LINE AT TUCSON
TUCSON, July 8 Establishment of
a commercial aerial transportation
line with. Tucson as one of the points
en route in all probability will be dis
cussed with citizens here within the
next few days when Captain W. H.
Smith, air service, United States re
serve, arrives in Tucson.
The secretary of the chamber of
commerce received a letter this
morning from Captain Smith In
which it was stated that he would
be in Tucson within a few days and
discuss the matter with citizens.
Captain Smith is general manager of
the Southwestern Aero Transporta
tion line with headquarters at El
Paso. It is presumed that the line
eventually will endeavor to get mail
contracts and deliver packages en
rcute.
On July 4 the Herald and Examiner
of Los Angeles established the first
aerial paper delivery serivce in the
world between Los Angeles and Cat
alina Island, a distance of about 30
miles. Sid Chaplin, a brother of
Charlie, made the initial flight. The
Los Angeles line in addition to carry
ing papers daily between these two
places also carries two passengers. So i
far the passengers have consisted for
the most part of persons interested
in movie work.
NEW REGULATION FOR DAIRIES
PHOENIX, July 7. Now in effect
are new and drastic regulations, pre
scribed by the last legislature, on sug
gestion of the State Dairy Commis
sioner, Farmers who sell to the
creameries no longer will be permit
ted to handle their cows or milk in
haphazard or unsanitary manner and
there is to be- emphasis in the in
spection of cleanliness and cooling.
Barns and corrals must be kept rel
atively clean and there must be evi
dence of a daily scalding of milking
utensils, separators and aerators.
Heretofore the inspection has been
confined to retail dairymen's premi
ses. The Tempe plant of the Pacify:
Creamery company, an Armour annex,
has been closed down for rebuilding
and refitting with the most modern
apparatus. AH. milk has been divert
ed to the new Glendale plant of the
company. The Tempe plant was
istarted for manufacture of the Lily
brand of evaporated milk, moved
thence from a site near Los Angeles
by J. B. Cook, now a Long Beach
banker. Sale to the Armours was
made a couple of years ago. After
the remodeling is completed, the
plants will have a capacity for hand
ling about 350,000 pounds of milk
daily.
The Salt River valley annex oi
Buckeye, now has its own creamery,
saving shipment to Phoenix of about
80 per cent of the Buckeye milk product.
No doubt you have noticed that nearly all of the league oppo
nents are too old for military service.

of copper continues to advance on the
New York stock exchange. 19 cnts
is being asked for copper with August j
delivery and 20 cents for September
delivery. Sales are reported good and
the demand shows a healthy increase.'
i nose wno are laminar wnn tne lo
cal copper situation say that thi3 con
dition has been expected and while
the priee is increasing slightly it is
not sufficient to change the local pro
duction activities as yet.
Leading sellers ask 19'4 tents a
pound for July; 19 cents for August !
and 20 cents for September. Sterling
exchange at $4.40 4 is a new low rec
ord. This may necessitate an early
extension of credit and loans to Eu

MINEOLA. N Y., July 8. Major O.
II. Scott, commander of the giant Erit
ish dirigible R-34 tonight informed
the crew that the start for the return
voyage to Great Britian, scheduled
for dawn tomorrow, would be delayed
at least 12 and possibly 24 hours.
ThM action was taken after receipt
from the weather bureau at Washing
tori of reports showing that whereas
the head winds over a considerable
part of the distance tomorrow, a fav
orable southwest current probably
would set in, along the Atlantic coast
Thursday or Friday.
The dirigible again narrowly es
caped serious injury this evening
when a sudden gust caught her tail,
swinging it around in a semi-circle
within thirty seconds and dragririK
several score of soldiers with it. The
rear gondola scraped along the grounrt
but the men succeeded in keeping it
high enough to prevent It being dam
aged. .
Naval officials in charge of the
ship while she is here, have been
requested to obtain the following ra
tions for the return voyage: 200
pounds of bread; 125 pounds of cooled
meat; 45 pounds of cooked potatoes;
36 pounds of sweet chocolate; six
pounds of tea; pound cake, sugar,
butter and a few sundries.
One "sundry" which the depart
ment as yet has been unable to sup
ply is J250 worth of rum. which is
part of the crew's official rations.
Lieutenant Colonel Lloyd W. Lucas,
commanding the dirigible's advance
party, said that he requested the rum
about ten days before the war time
prcbition became effective and that he
understood an attempt was made to
purchase late on the night of June
30, hut that it was unsuccessful.

force and energy into' the
whole system. Three

MAKE THIS TEST
See how long you can work or how far you can"
walk without becoming tired; next take two five
grain tablets of Nuxated Jron three times per
day after meals for two weeks. Then test your
strength again and see how much you have
gained. Numbers of nervous, run-down people
who were ailing all the while have most aston
i?hinar1y increased their strength and endurance
simply by taking iron in the proper form.
