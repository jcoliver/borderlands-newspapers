BOSTON, Mar. 8. Resolutions in-!
dorsing the attitude of United States '
Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, toward j
the league o" nations and opposing j
the acceptance of the constitution of j

adopted at a meeting at Tremont Tern- j

Attacks on the league by United j

applause and repeatedly the audience j

Overflow Meetings
The three speakers later addressed
an overflow meeting of several thou
sand persons in the street.
As in earlier speeches, Senator
William E. Borah, republican of Idaho,
denounced the proposed league as a
league of diplomats rather than of
nations, with an executive council in
which Asiatic and European members
could outvote America on purely
American issues.
Senator Charles S. Thomas, demo
crat of Colorado, reiterated his con
viction that the United States ought
not be committed to a new and far
reaching national policy in advance of
a thorough knowledge of every detail
involved in so momentous an under
taking. Former Senator Albert J. Beveridge
of Indiana, who was chairman of the
progressive national convention in
1912, presided. In introducing the
other sneakers Mr. Beveridge attack
ed the proposed international consti-
tutlon as a partnership in which Eu- j
rope and Asia would furnish the lia
bilities and the United States supply
the assets.
"We are told that we shall disap
poinUthe world if we refuse," (to join
lpasrae of nations), he said. "If any
fciminps house made contracts on
that principle, how long would It keep
out of bankruptcy? It Is said we are
now a world powerfand must take up
new burdens. We aS-e. indeed, a world
power, and we do not intend to sur
render that position and become the
tail of the international kite. We wel
come new burdens if they are legiti
mate; but we decline those which
others are eaeer to unload.
It is said we went to war to create
this league of nations. That I"! not
the truth. The truth is we went to
war to whip Germany. That job is

New Call' for Funds Necessary j
to Carry Out Program ofj
Reconstruction and Njercy
(By Review Leasee "Wire)
NEW YORK. March 8. Plans for
organization of an international Red
Cross to be led by the American Red
Cross in a great peace time campaign j
to prevent disease, relieve suffering,
and "make the world what the war i
was fought for a better place to j
live in," was outlined by Dr. Living-
sion i-arranu, newiy appuiuieu t;uaji-
man of the central committee of the j
American Red Cross at a conference
of Atlantic division chapters! delegates
here "today. Abfcut ,1500 deJeates
were present.
Immediately after his address,
which was his first public discussion
of peace time aijs of the organiza
t!on since his "reoint appointment as
its head by President Wilson, Dr. Far
rand sailed for France to prepare an
international conference of Red CrbsB
societies which will meet in Geneva
30 days after the signing of peace.
The international organization will be
proposed at this conference.
.Will Ask for Funds
Dr. Farrand warned Red Cross work
ers that they would be called on for
continued service for a long time after
peace had been declared and an
nounced that a nation-wide appeal for
funds to carry on the organization's
work would be made soon.
"We shall postpone the call as long
as possible," he added, "but I don't
mind telling you that the bottom of
the Red Cross treasury is In sight,
and it would be quite impossible for
the American people not to act in
this particular field."
Discussing the proposal of the or
ganization of the international Red
Cross, Dr. Farrand declared the war
had shown "that the war basis of the
Red Cross has become outgrown."
n "This, war," he said, "has shown

of the central powers,- shall all unite
in an international movement for the
prevention of disease, for the relief
of suffering, for the possibility of
making the world what the war was
fought for a better place to live in."
Defines Peace Aims
Of the peace aims of the' Ameri
can Red Cross, Dr. Farrand Baid:
"I happened to "be one of those
who for some 10 or 15 years has been
looking for the day when there might
be some organization strong enough,
fit enough, representative enough, to
co-ordinate all of those random efforts
in the prevention of disease and the
protection of the public health, upon
which the welfare of any nation de
pends, - -
"It seems to ma that now for the
first time in the history of the world,
in the history of this country, certain
ly, we have an organization that is
able to bring about those ends."
The Red CrosB "home service" orig
inally begun in the interests of fami
lies of soldiers, he said, would be ex
tended to all homes in every section
where such service Is needed, especi
ally the south and west.
Similarly, he continued, problems of
mortality, child health and tubercu
losis would be taken up, the Red Cross
acting "not as a great absorber" of
existing agencies, but as an organiza
tion for the support and co-ordination
of existing agencies and for supplying
I agencies where none exists.
war work to continue
This program, however, he made
plain, will not interfere with the Red
Cross war work which, contrary to
public belief, he declared, was "just
at its height."

President of Northern Pacific'
Cites How Pennsylvania i
Has Lost Under Gov't Rule ;
Urges Old Competition Sys
tem to Insure Adequate
Service, Efficient Control
(By Review LeaseG Wire)
CHICAGO, March 8. The early re
turn of the railroads tooperation by
the companies which own them and
the passage of constructive legisla
tion to enable private operation to be
made successful, were advocated by
Howard Elliott, chairman and presi
dent of the Northern Pacific railway.
in an address before the commercial
club of Chicago at a dinner here to
night.
Mr. Elliott ,"pre?nted some data
which brought cut contracts between
the situation c the railways under
private and under government opera
tion. ."The Pennsylvania system." he said
"furnished 12.2 per cent of the total
ton mileage and 12 Per cent of the
total passenger mileage of the steam
roads of this country. On December
31, 1917, that system had 233,600 em
ployes, and on December 31, 1918, it
had 273,101 employes. Although the
ton mileage handled in 1918 was less
than in 1917 (the railways being in
the year 1917 under private control)
nearly 40,000 more employes were re
quired to handle the smaller volume
of business.
No Criticism Intended
"These statements are not made in
criticism of the railroad administra
tion or of members of it, but simply
to emphasize the point that the sys
tem of government operation is not
productive of the best results. With
the same railroads a little better
equipped in 1918 than in 1917, and
the same officers and men but with
different organization and direction,
and with the head men working as
hard as human beings could work,
and with vast war power and freedom
from restrictive laws, . government
ment control had the effect of reduc
ing that tireless energy and individ
uality so important to the success of
any enterprise, and the total earning
of the railroads was less than in 1917
and was very much more cosily to the
country.
"The railroad executives do not be
lieve in the : so-called regional plan
under which all of the railroads in a
given territory are to be merged into
one system. They believe that our
geographical, economic and social con
ditions are so different from those ex
isting in foreign countries that we
must solve our problem in our own
way and not adopt a plan because
some other nation may have experi
mented with it.
"Small, unsuccessful, and so-called
"weak lines' that are depending upon
their connections with the great trunk
lines, must gradually be absorbed and
become a part of the larger system ;
just' as has been done in the past.
Continue Regulated Competition .
"Regulated competition, especially
as to service, should be continued be
tween the great systems.
"What is called the labor question..
Is of course, one of the most serious
and difficult confronting the whole
world, the railroads in particular! and
there must be a broad view of It and
a spirit of give and take by all classes
of. people. All good citizens desire
to see wages and living conditions Im
prove but there is a limit to what
commerce and industry can pay and
survive. 16 is surely better to have
reasonable wages and continuous em
ployment rather than to force wages
so high that industry languishes, for
then the wage earners themselves will
suffer most of all.

chine is vital to the interests of the
nation in war and peace. Its import
ance justifies having a man in the
cabinet to confer on an equality with
other cabinet officers dealing with

GEORGE WASHINGTON
March 8 (By Wireless to

The impression gathered by
contact with President Wil

which has developed to the
league of nations covenant
has not caused him to de
cide that any radical
changes are necessary. It
is recognized that changes in
phraseology and minor par

any fundamental alteration.
Thus far the president has

these questions. He con

ASK HIGHER VW
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Mar. 8. Several
hundred thousand railroad shop em
ployes have asked the railroad admin
istration to increase their wages about
25 per cent. The board of railroad
wages and working conditions has
agreed to htar their case Wednes
day. The shop employes who were given
one wage advance last year in addi
tion to the general increase in pay,
now ask that the basic rate per hou
be changed from 6S cents to S5 cents
for trained employes with proportion
al raises for assistants and helpers.
This would make the rate for second
class workmen about 60 cents per
hour.
The application also urges that any
increase be made retroactive to Jan-
uary 1. Shop employes participating
in this wage demand include machin
ists, blacksmiths, boilermakers, sheet
metal workers, electricians and cat
men. The principal wage question now
pending before the railroad adminis
tration is application of the four lead
ing trainmen's brotherhoods- for re
adjustments of wage scales to restore
differentials existing before the gen- j
eral wage advance and for time and
a halt pay for overtime. The re
adjustments have practically been de-
termlned upon, resulting in some ee
creases and some advances in wages I
with the general trend upward. No de- j
cision has been reached, however, on i
whether time and a half or pro rata I
wages will be given for overtime.

Ambassador Francis told the com
mittee that a complete and thorough
understanding of th Rnsdin man a na
! convinced him that with the bolshe
vists in power in Russia, peace not
only in Europe, but throughout the
entire world was an utter impossibil
ity. He said that even now there was
good reason for believing that Ger
man and Austrian officers were wita
Russia and he added that the Germans
steadily were getting a grip upon the
vitals of Russia and her industries.
Bolshevists Seek Treaty
Mr. Francis further testified that
information had reached him that Ray
mond Robins, former American Red
? cross commissioner to Russia had up-
on his return to the Lnited States car
ried a proposal from the bolsheviki
government to President Wilson. Th:s
proposal, he said, he understood was
an offer of certain concessions to the
American government similar to those
granted Germany in the treaty of
Brest-Litovsk.
The ambassador said so far as he
( knew Mr. Robins was never given an
j opportunity to present the proposal to
! the president.
In reply to questions from members
of the committee, Mr. Francis said
it was his understanding that the
soviet government did not desire to
make a similar proposal to Great Bri
tain, France and the other allies. On
the contrary, his information, he said,
was to the effect that the bolshevists
wished to conceal the proposal from
the governments associated with the
United States
Warns Against Withdrawal

would happen it American and allied
troops were withdrawn from northern
Russia, and in reply he asserted that
he was positive the bolshevists would

murder and destruction on a serle
such as the orld has never seen.
Reports that the bolshevists were
sending their agents into Germany,
France and England were upheld by
the witness, who said he believed the
efforts in this country thus far had
taken the form of money for use in
spreading of their propaganda. He
told of the delivery of boshevist
propaganda to the armies of the al
lies and the United States in France.
The ambassador said the soviet gov
ernment had recently been petitioned
not to carry out the denationaliza
tion of certain banks, the objects of
the petitioners being, he said, to al
low German agents to obtain control
of the stock of these institutions.
Mr. Francji said it was not true
that the mass of the Russians labor
ed the rule of the bolshevists. As a
matter of fact, according to Ambas
sador 'Francis, less than a constantly
dwindling 10 per cent of all the people
in Russia belongs to the bolshevists.
He painted a vivid picture of the ter
ror that reigns in the old country of
the czar and told of one instance
where the gutters from a courtyard
in Petrograd actually ran with blood
from the victims of the bolshevists.
Wholesale Slaughter
Many were killed without even
charges bein? made against them and
on several occasions, the ambassador
asserted, wholesale killings were in
dulged in. He said more than 500 in
nocent hostages were killed at one
time and that the observation of con
ditions and affairs in Russia led him
to believe that the bolshevists in their
every day practices commited ex
cesses far beyond even the. wildest
dreams of anarchists.
"Anarchists, as I understand them,"
he declared, "believe only in the de
struction of property. The bolshe
vists believe in the destruction of
property and life as well for they rea
lize that their only means of continu
ing in, power is by killing all those
who dare to oppose them."
Speaking of the Czecho-Slovak
forces in Russia, Mr. Francis said
there was not the slightest doubt but
that they were betrayed by Trotzky,
at the instigation of the Germans.
-Trotzky. said the ambassador, agreed
to assist the Czecho-Slovaks to leave
Russia if they would lay down their
arms and at the same time issued a
secret order promising to punish any
Russian trainman who in any way
assisted them to get out of the coun
try. Later these Czecho-Slovaks were
treacherously attacked.
Flat contradiction was given by Am
bassador Francis to statements .of
previous witnesses before the com
mittee to the effect that a free press
existed in Russia.
Bolshevikt Favor Robins
The ambassador discussed Colonel
Robins at some length. He said he
had beard the Red Cross representa
tive referred to as the "mouthpiece
of America," and the reference became
so frequent that -he was obliged o
issue a public notice saying that he
represented the American government
and statements coming from any other
source were unauthorized. Mr. Fraii'
cis aeciarea inai oionei iioums
ed him to "follow the bolshevist gov
ernment to Moscow" when it moved
there from Petrograd. The Red Cross j
representative was said by the min
ister to have had every facility placed
at iiis disposal by the bolshevist3,
with whom be was persona grata. He
said when Colonel Robins traveled,
the bolshevists telegraphed ahead to
help him in every way and that he hd
authorization to have what telegrams
lie sent put ahead of all other mess
ages, such privileges being denied to
the ambassador.
The ambassador said that on tl e
night of the suppression of the con
stituent assembly, the belshevists ex
nerted trouble and three of thp many
hundred Americans who came to Rus-J
sia were on guard at the soviet mi:i-j
istry of foreign affairs. He declared
these to -have been John Reed, a I
writer who has appeared before tl: e j
committee, a man named Humphreys I
and another named Reinstein. whose j
home was said to be in Buffalo. The I
Ambassador asserted that in a single
week 800 Americans arrived in Rus
sia and that many of them associated
with the bolshevists soon thereafter.
The ambassador said he warned the
state department and recommended
that passports be not issued to Amer
icans to come to Russia. I

executives believe that a guarantee
wculd tend to reduce initiative and re
tard efficient management, and they
do not ask for it. They believe that
with adequate rates, reasonable lib
erty to act, and good management,
roads that have been wisely planned,
honestly financed and well managed
can sustain themselves. Poorly lo
cated or unwisely promoted or badly
financed roads may have to reorganize
or merge with other roads.
Some of the great labor organiza
tions have suggested that the govern
ment purchase all the stocks of the
companies and own the roads sub
ject to the bonds all the roads to be
then managed as a national system
by a board to. consist of an equal 1
number of directors, appointed by the
president, by the officers of the roads
and by the employes. This, would;
eliminate competition and put vast
power in this proposed board. j
"While I am an optimist in the fu-l
ture of the United States, neverthe-1
less I do not minimize the serious
ness of the situation confronting the
railroads and the country owing to j
conditions, produced by the war. Dur-J
ing the reconstruction period it is
very essential that the present rate
structure should stand, and until thej
new laws therein suggested are ef
fective that the 'just compensation
provided by the present control law
be continued.
Hines' Statement Reasuring
"Otherwise there is grave danger
of a financial collapse of some roads
and an inability of others to pay divi
dends which will affect the bonds now
held by savings banks. The recent
statement by Mr. Hines in which he
sad the president had no intention of
returning the roads to the owners has
tily and before a reasonable oppor
tunity had been given for the congress
to legislate is erassuring; although it
is what many believe the president
in the exercise of good judgment
would do when he assessed the whole
situation.
"One administrative step that might
be taken in the not distant future
and would pave the way to return to
private ownership and operatiori is
this suggestion, and I believe it would
help the situation:
"Let the president continue the con
trol organization in Washington under
a director general, who with his staff
wiil supervise the whole situation,
direct policies, and make those ad
justments with the railroads that will
be required ofter governmental con
trol ceases. This central organization
should direct the operation of the rail
roads through the companies them
selves, rather than through a system
of regional directors. In other words,
say to the boards of directors and exe
cutive officers of each company that
from and after a given date they are
the take charge of their properties
and manage, maintain, and operate
them for the account of the United
States and as may be ordered by the
president through the central organi
zation in Washington. At once there
will be a better feeling among offi
cers and men, and unless uncertainty
about the future; the intricate and
delicately adjusted organization of the
great system of railroads will begin
to function better and work more
smoothly and effectively; there will
be less lost motion and less crossing
of wires than under the very highly
centralized system now in existence
with regional directors."

Disabled in War
To Return Home
WASHINGTON, March
Present estimates of military an
the Hies put the number of
Americans disabled in the war at
100,000. Of this number, it Is
estimated that 0.000 will be able
tions, leaving 20,000 who need
retraining for work 'suited . to
their maimed condition.
The federal board of vocation
al education, appealing to the
country today for aid in the cam
paign to make disabled soldiers
Independent by making them self
supporting, announced that so
far 13.000 men injured in fighting
the battles of democracy have
registered for retraining. The
applications of 1:J00 have been
approved and 500 actually have
started courses in re-education.
The experience -of France and
England, that oniy 25 per cent of
the men needing retraining take
advantage of the facilities offer
ed, seems certain to be surpassed
to return to their old occupar
in this country. Hie federal board
believes, in view of the greater
?fc:i'Tosity of this covernment.
At least 15,'ft0 disabled men afv
expx ted to enroll for .vocational
courses.
Tuition, books and living "x

WOOD APPEALS FOR
RATIO!
L
IN UNITED STATES
Warns American Public Not
to Let Anything Replace
Sound Policy of Prepared
ness if Peace Is Maintained
NEW YORK, March S. Major Gen.
Leonard Wood In an address today
warned the American public not to
"let anything, whether a League of
Nations, a Hague tribunal or an inter
national arbitration system replace a
policy of sound rational preparedness
if the country is to remain In a state
of peace.
The general, who spoke at the
opening of the Methodist centenary
movement, declared that "verbal mes
sage, however skilfully applied, will
not maintain a permanent peace."
He reiterated his well-known stand
for. universal military training, as
sertaing that whatever may be said
by its opponents there was "nothing
bad against it."
Must Encourage Soldiers
With "radicalism- and wrptrhd
misearble bolshevism stalking through
tne country," said the army officer
some soldiers would offer a fertaile
held for its seeds of discontent if
they were allowed to go home feeling
that the country ha3 nnt hoon nc
thoughtful of them as was their due.
"We sent them to our home camps
ana overseas, he continued, "with
every form of encouragement, making
them feel they wer crusaders in a
holy cause. Now they are coming
home, having fought in the war which
was as much our war as it was the
war of any country from the day it
began.
"Some of these mei, wearing the
uniform of our country, lack funds, a
place to sleep, even' food. Some cf
them have wasted their money; thou
sands have been drugged and robbed.
Many of them are unreasonable, irri
table, as a result of shell-shock or
the constant mental, photograph be
fore them of slaughtered human
beings. But they are our soldiers and
we must return them honorably to
private life."
The general declared that men dis
charged from the training camps were
entitled to as much consideration as
those returning from Europe. He
called upon his audience, composed
of wealthy business men of the Meth
odist faith, to lend their aid to the
task of providing work for every sol
dier in- need of it.
Declaring that "the red flag" was
trying to break up American insti
tutions and the American home. Gen
eral Wood urged for the country "one
flag and one language," advocating
that no tonigue but English be taught
in the -elementary schools. He
pleaded for sound teaching of Amer
ican history, "with no loose boasts of
what we are supposed to have dons,"
and favored nation-wide recognition
of the need of higher salaries for
teachers, asserting that "the present
niggardly pay policy" endangered the
future of American citizens . "whose
thought is moulded, by the men and
women presiding in our classrooms."
In support of a statement that
America 'will always welcome the
foreigner who will assimilate our
ideals." the general said it was "xreil
to remember the devotion of thou
sands - of our soldiers born in other
lands," adding that "one cannot but
.be impressed by the large number of
names of German origin on the lists
of American soldiers dead."
The central department commander
described the national army as "a
true cross section of the American
people, with the bad and weak ele
ments dropped out." -What had been
accomplished with it, for the soldiers
themselves, as well as for the coun
try, poved, he declaed' the efficacy of
a system of universal military train

River Regulation for Arizona
Action was taken in the closing hours of congress that -will be of
most Tltal and far-reaching benefit to Arizona, and make it the first
state where a great national demonstration will be made of the stupen
dous benefits that will result from the adoption of the Kewiands river
regulation plan for flood control -and the regulation of the flow of
rivers by standardizing that flow throughout the year, preventing flood
devastation and removing the silt which is now a menace to reser
voir construction.
The now celebrated Olmstead , report on the Gila river"as bee
printed as a public document, with all its wonderful maps 'and diagrams
and. illustrations, and will now become the baslB for ' a campaign to se
cure the appropriations recommended therein, amounting to about six
million dollars, for doing the necessary construction work on the water
sheds to completely control the floods and so regulate the flw f the
X3ila river that it will come out of the canyon at Florence' In all ordinary
years with a standard flow throughout the year, and clear of silt. All
damage by floods will be prevented. i . . . ; . ...
This splendid result has been accomplished through the most vigorous
team work by the governor and both Arizona senators and citizens
interested, and George ,H. Maxwell, acting for the National Reclamation
association. Some weeks ago the necessity for prompt action, growing
out of the probability that there might be no special session of congress,
became apparent. Governor Campbell took the matter up by wire with
Secretary Lane, asking the secretary to send the original Olmstead re
port to him, the report being then on file in the department. The secre
tary promptly complied with the governor's request. . Then. the governor
secured the cooperation of Engineer Olmtsead, who came to Phoenix
from Los Angeles for a conference as to strengthening the report with
with reference to the San Carlos dam project. This benig done, the
governor sent the reports to Washington by his special messenger, Judge
Lewis, who arrived in Washington recently.
Arrangements were made by wire for Judge Lewis to meet Senator
Ashurst as soon as he reached Washington, and the senator. and Judge
Lewis delivered the report personally to Secretary Lane last Sunday
evening, and were assured of his desire tc do everything possible to
expedite the printing of the report. The report was transmitted to the
senate by the secretary at 11 o'clock Monday morning.. The moment it
was received, Senator Smith, the chairman of the printing committee,
was ready with a resolution ordering the report printed as a public
document with all its illustrations, and the resolution was adopted. Ia
his telegram to Andrew Kimball advising him of this. Senator Ashurst
said: "Secretary Lane laid Olmstead report before the senate at 11 o'clock
today, whereupon Senator Mark Smith had resolution ready and presented
same and it passed, the senate ordering the printing of the report with
illustrations. 1 - congratulate tlose interested upon thai remarkable
promptness with which this was- printed and all credit should go to
"Senator Mark Smith for this accomplishment."
Andrew Kimball, of Thatcher, has been" untiring in his efforts to
secure relief for his people in the SafforJ valley, and for every com
munity on the Gila river irom its source to Its mouth. The Imperial
valley will be safeguarded against the floods of the Gila river by this
plan, and hundreds of thousands of acres will be" irrigable from the
regulated flow of the river. This is the first thing inaugurated under the
resolutions of the Arizona Cattle Growers' convention and the slogan
proposed there by George IL Maxwell:
"Everybody all together for Arizona.1 Arizona Itecord.
RELIEVING THE WATCH
Sculptors of Life
There are men who model remarkable things out of clay and marble.
They have made images of man wonderful to behold and well near im
possible to duplicate. They have been decorated with honors, titles,
laurel wreaths and showered with words of praise. .
They produced out of senseless marble a thing which resembles
human beings.
For doing so much, and doing it well, they deserve considerable
credit and that the world gives them.
But there are other sculptors and we do not call them sculptors, who
'turn out even more wonderful work. They take or a thing and make it
a man. They put the soul into mortal clay. They put real lire into
lifeless years. There are many such.
For instance, there i3 one such human sculptor of human clay living
in Chicago. This sculptor well call him such, although he never handled
a sculptor's mallet and chisel Jock Robbins, carves fine men out of
"bad" boys. He takes the boy without home, without friends, without
hope, without ambition, without any of the things which naturally would
lead a boy into honest manhood, and spends , weeks and years carving
out of that flesh and hone a boy with hope, ambition and a soul!
Taking them from the gutter of sin. form penal institutions and the
streets, Jack Robins moulds them into boys who will be men. husbands,
fathers, citizens, an honor to their country and a living monument to their
sculptor.
. Yet, the world pins no medal on Jack Robins, and places no laurel
wreathe upon his brow. Nor does he receive golden reward for his effort.
The world will go on paying much in gold and praise to the Borglums,
Trobetskis, MacMonieses. Lorado Tafia for what they can do in clay
and marble, and the world will go on admiring the -remarkable genius of
Pericles and Michael Angelo. sculptors who made lifeless Images out
of clay, and the world will go on overlooking and unrewarding the
greater geniuses who make good men out o fbad boys.
It is our opinion that the saving or one wayward boy is of greater
Talue to the world than the carving of all the marble statues In niches
and upon pedestals the world over.
The Bumps You Get
We were watching a little two-year-old boy climb up a chair
as children are wont to do. The first two times he tried it, be fell
-back kerbang. and hit his head a resounding whack. But he never
uttered a cry just got up and went at it again.
That boy will succeed in life unless some friend persists in
"making a big fuss" over the little fellow every time he gets a bump.
From the time we are laid in our crib by the nurse to the time the
undertaker reverently puts us in our last resting place, we are bumped
about in the world.
Sometimes the bumps are spiritual; sometimes they are physical.
Eut. whichever they are, the important thing is keep going. The
man or woman who stops to shed tears will get shoved to the side of the
the road by those coming up who push on even when their eyes are
blinded with tears.
And. our reaction to bumps will depend a great deal upon the way
we are taught to receive them as children.
The Call of the People
There is on file with the board of supervisors a large petition signed
by taxpayers and voters from the big end or the ta.pa ying part or
the county asking the state engineer and tbe board or supervisors not

Since congress failed to approve
the treasury's recommendation that it
be permitted to use the unexpected

be limited to the war finance corpor

Belgrade is practically cut off fronij
the interior of Serbia because of de
struction of the railways and the
shocking condition of the roads. There
are practically no young men in Jthe
city. Those who were within two or
three years of the military age left
with the army in the winter.of 1915-16.
They set out to make the retreat down
through Serbia and as it proved, over
the mountains into Albania, and
thence to Corfu. Something like one
in seven survived the trip.
There are practically no children
under three in Belgrade or elsewhere
in Serbia, for that matter. Midwives
have been in the unemployment class
for the last three years and will be
tor a year to come, for the Serbian
army; what remains of it, is now in
the occupied part of what was Austria-Hungary.
For no obvions reason tuberculosis
is the king of terror in Belgrade. A
tuberculosis death rate of 250 per
hundred thousand is very exceptional
ly bigh in America. Before the war
the tuberculosis death rate in Bel
grade reached 712 and during the Aus
trian occupation it reached the un
heard of figure of 1453.
Population Cut Nearly in Half
Before the war Belgrade approached
a hundred thousand in population.
When the Austrian s took - it, there
were 20,000. Another 30,000 soon came
back. At the present time perhaps
its population may be 60.000 r 65,000.

If the United States undertakes th.
policing of Armenia, as President
Wilson has declared will be probable,
a force of 5000 or 6000 American ma
rines can do the job.
That's the opinion of Congressman
E. C. Little of Kansas, formerly U. S.
minister to Egynt. and the cnnrrpg.
sional expert on the Near East.
A small force to protect the
boundary between Armenia and Turk
ish Anatolia, to police the cities and
to organize the Armenian army is all
that we should send to Armenia," said
Congressman Little.
'Armenia has a mighty fine army
of her own numbering about 150,0ft0
men, so she won't need much policing.
The Armenians are the most demo
cratic people Irthe world, and perfect
ly capable of governing themselves.

Latest Proposal
BY EDWARD M. THIERRY
N. E. A. Staff Correspondent. '
PARIS, France.
American soldiers over here have
their own idea of the sort of emblem
which they should have to wear when
they leave the uniform for "cits " re-,
gardless of what the War Department
in Washington may decide o give
them.
Plane News, the snappy weekly of
the airmen at Issoudun, has sounded
sentiment and "makes this suggestion:
Gold service chevrons, symbo
lizing service over here one, two
or omre gold chevrons indicating ,
length of overseas service' on a .
neat blacft enameled background
with a. gold border; a pi f to be
worn in the coat lapel.
The chevrons would correspond to
those now worn on the uniform sleeve.
Each gold V-shaped chevron indicates
six months' service in France.
"As a means of identifying an ex-A.
E. F. man it would be ideal," says the
Plane News. "We all appreciate the
companionship of comrades in arms.
One never hesitates to SDeak to a fel
low soldier in O. D. and many a lone
some journey has been brightened by
the acquaintanceship of another cas
ual traveler in. uniform, which is in
such striking contrast to one's experi
ence in civil life, where a day's jour
ney sometimes is never broken by the
good fellowship of another traveler.
"The military pin would have a still
broader scope. It would demand rec
ognition immediately for' an ex-soldier
as soon as applying for a nositirm it
would be assurance to the employer
aiau lu ne wouia be making no mis
take in selecting the applicant. Neigh
bors would be made more neighborlv
which is a rarity in the big towns." "
Its Victory

Lewis B. Branklin, director of war
loans for treasury department, is per
fecting - plans for the fifty Victory
Liberty loan, the campaign for which
will begin in April.
The treasury department did not
wait for congress to pass the bill au
thorizing, the loan, but went right
ahead on its preparations.
It faces a bigger task this year than
in any of the other. Liberty loan cam
paigns, not only because the war is
over, but because the new form of
the fifth loan will make a whole lot
of explaining Lecessary.
The loan is to be put out in the
form of a short-term notes instead of
icng-time coupon bonds, as Jn the
past. In order to simplify their sale,
the treasury department will have the
notes printed as nearly like the fourtn
Liberty loan bonds as possible. But
they will bear no interest coupons.
Director Franklin is making a study
of the four classes ot notes author
ized under the new ait. the rate of
interest they will bear, and the ma
turity period, which will be not more
than five years.
The four classes differ only in their
exemption ficm taxes, it is likely
that all foiw clashes will be issueti,
but for the purpose of a popular cam
paign one ot tHeni will b; selected on
which the treasury department's im
mense sales lon e all over the country :
will concentrate. This will avoid toil-'
fusion in the minds of the public. j
This nolo can Iht-n be converted into
any of tho other clashes at the option
of the owner.

occupied Corinto for 'several months
during one of the periodical Nicara
guan revolutions. Again in 1910 a
smaller force as sent to Bluefields.
The most important of the Nica
raguan expeditions was that of 1912,
when some 1200 men supported the
government forces against the fnsur
rectos for six months, and saw some
real fighting in which four of them
were killed.

But they had hardly quieted Nica
ragua when the black populations of
Santo Domingo and Haiti broke into
war. American . customs collectors
were involved, so in 1914 a small de
tachment of "soldiers of the sea" was
sent to arbitrate the fight with Amer
ican bullets. .
Gradually all the principal ports of
the island were taken nndtr Amer
ican control, and in two years a force
ot 2500 marines was concentrated in
Haiti and Santo Domingo. Stable gov
ernments were set up in each ot the
republics, and the marines turned
their attention- to sanitary regulations.

tion, i
The marines are still in Haiti, uncei
a treaty with the country.
Then there were the expeditions, of
the marines to China, during the
Boxer rebellion, to the Philippines dur
ing Aguinaldo's uprising, and to Sa
moa, but they were purely fighting
jobs, not police nor administrative.

words be shunned as far as possible
and the words "Victory Loan"
be em-

-THE TRAIL THAT IS ALWAYS

For fgourteen years and a half from
the day I met him, there was never
one small moment of misunderstand
ing, one day that was not happiness
except when we were parted. Per
haps there are people who would con
sider it stupid, boresome, to live in
such peace as that.' All I can answer
is that it was nat stupid, it was not
boresome oh, how far form it! In
fact, in those early days we took pur
vow that the one "thing we would
never do was to let the world get
commonplace for us; that the time
should never icome when we would
not be eager for the start of each new
day. The Kipling poem we loved the
most, for it was the spirit of both of
us, was "The Long Trail." You know
the last of it:
Tne Lord knows what we may find,
dear lass.
Aud ' the . deuce knows what we may
.do
But we're back once more on the old
trail, our own trail, the out-trail.
We're down, hull down, on the Long

TOASTED THE EX-KAISER
Amsterdam For a report of the
Cassel Allgemein Zeitung. it appears
that, despite all denials, the ex-kaiser's
birthday was celebrated at the Ger
man army headquarters. The journal
says mat Marshal von Hindenburg
referred to the ex-kaiser as follows:
r.en people ot - different views
would consider it cowardice and dis
loyalty if we should hesitate to admit
fronkly that we are thinging today
with love, gratitude, reverence and
great sorrow of the kaiser, to whom
we have hitherto devoted our lives
and our actions, and for whom we
were ever ready to stake our blood
and oar treasure for the welfare of
the fatherland. May God bless him
and give him strength to bear the
heavy burden which God's inscrut
able will has palced upon him. Let
us drink, a silent toast to his health
with this sincere wish from our loval
hearts."

COUNSEL WRITES
LETTER TO BAKER
His civilian counsel Attorney Big
ger, in his letter to Secretary Baker,
says:
"We believe that the manner and
method of courts aartial at the Co
lumbus "barracks (which we believe
to be typical of courts martial
throughout the entire country) will
bear immediate investigation and in
spection. We believe, with consider
able reason, that the interests of an
accused enlisted man are not generally
protected.
"There are provisions in. thej ar
ticles of war intended to protect an
accused man, but most of these pro
visions are notoriously ignored, or de
liberately disregarded.
"If enlisted men generally -could
speak without fear of reprisals, thou
sands of them would come forward to
complain of the manner in which they
have been tried, convicted and sen
tenced by army courts martial.
"Instead of Captain Doyle now fac
ing trial for openly complaining
against the injustices that are heaped
on enlisted men by courts martial, the
whole court martial system should bo
placed on trial.
"When the public comes to realize
the real facts, there is no doubt in my
mind that an indignant nubile onlnion

"It is a sad travesty dn American

assumed to be guilty before a syllable

Costello had sold after Cunningham's
death to the Calumet and Arizona and
Shattuck companies for about $1,000,

yean 1899 to 1904.
'-. ome of the claims involved In the
dispute were the original claims of
the Calumet & Arizona company in
this district, the properties on which
they entered the mining activity which
has made them one of the big pro
ducers of the Southwest. Included In
this number was the Irish Mag, a
property which the company is still
working and which forms an import
ant part of their holdings.
The defense was based on a general
denial of Cunninghams' ownership in
the claims, except as to six claims in
which Costello had made settlement
with Mrs. Julia Cunningham the plain
tiffs' mother and guardian, during the
year 1901. The defense also set np

Physicians explain the case, saying

. " (Special to The Review)
JEROME, Ariz., Mar. 8. In view of
determinations made by Surveyor A.
B. ColwelL It appears unlikely that the
main ledge at the Grand Island will
be cut on the 500 toot level before
April. As nearly as can be determined
the ledge lies about 300 feet ahead of
the present face of the crosscut. -
Before a survey was made It was
thought that the ledge lay directly
north of the shaft, and would be hit
within 100 feet of the 500 foot sta
tion. Colwell discovered, however,
that the ledge "trends northeast ana
southwest instead of due east and
west and that the proper way to cross
cut was to the northwest. Therefore
the course of the crosscut wit
changed.
More than 400 feet of underground
work was done at the Grand Island
last month, so. if operations are con-
tinued at tne present rate, tne ieage
ought to be hit by the first of April

from the shaft a drift was started

says of samples from this drift all

a feeder to the main ledge and the
gold values give promise that a hjgh-

ed when the ledge is intersected.

Manning.
Mr. Manning blames the present
high death and injury rate in the
mines to the presence of these for-
elgners from the non-English-speak-
mg races, a majority of whom are not
even able to read or write their own
languages. He finds that the death
and injury rates among these men are
twice as high as among the English
speaking miners and that their pres
ence in the mines is responsible for a
higher accident rate than would or
dinarily exist among the English
speaking miners, making these men
a menace to all of the miners. The
statistics show that there are now

ONE OF HISTORY'S
TREMENDOUS EVENTS
The president's face glowed with
hope and confidence as his voice car

remotest corners' of the hall.
For the delegates, for the spectators,
it was a dramatic, inspiring scene
one of the' most tremendous events in
history.
For the president it was mere
It was the climax ot his years of
world leadership; the tangible begin,
ning of the era ot good faith toward
which he had patiently guided the
nations through the months of war;
the first concrete result ot his untir

closest to his heart
All day the president had been in
high spirits. I' was one of a dozen
American correspondents with whom
the president talked for an hour be
fore he started for the conference. He
was frankly elated over the agree
mentover the covenant contents.
Close friends said they had never
reea the president happier.
Arriving at the Quai d'Orsay, he
shook hands, smiled and chatted with
a score of delegates as he made his
way to the head ot the room.
"lhere he stood for a few moments
joking with Premier Clemenceau. Oc
casionally he would lean over and
shake a long finger at the old "Tiger."

MASK DANCE AT COUNTRY
CLUB ST. PATRICK'S DAY.
The quiet of the Lenten season has
settled down. Social affairs hare given
way to tie sbuggestion of the forty
days of meditation and the social cat
endars heretofore well filled with en
gagements show many a bare spot.
But while milady may figuratively, ar

that many a n7." "UI hve it

from the possibility of further, consid

facinating materials already shown in
the shops will furnish the necessary
Inspiration, if indeed any. be needed.
Good old Saint Patrick whose , men
ory is forever green and provokes not
a few decorative schemes for lunch
eon table, dinner and dance will come
in for a share of attention at this
lean season. ' The most conspicuous
cf the affairs given up tOjthe recog
nition of the patron saint will be the
mask dance at the Country club, and
doubtless will be the mecca toward
which a large number of gayly arrayed
couples will make their way. It prom
ise much in the way of delightful en
tertainment. . "
Another affair which will smack of
the observance of the'memory of Saint
Patrick will be the luncheon which
the members of the Woman's club
will give on Friday as a compliment
to Mrs P. EL Coles a Jong time mem
ber of the club who is leaving the
district in the near future.
The war changed the current of
thought and provided work for nimble
fingers, solving the problem,, of the oc
cupation of the time of the Lenten
season, last year. Even before that
many " women Tre ; devoting anuch
time to the answering of the calls
which came from across and so were
not unprepared for the near at hand
work. Then came the signing of the
armistice and a letting down but, by
no means abandonment; of the work.
This year-the fc'omen who are anx
ious to make the Lenten season fulfill
its idea of self sacrifice need look nc
further than the Red Cross work
rooms. . . ;
Two hundred refugee garments,
children's dresses reached the head
quarters of the I.isbee chapter a few
days ago. They are needed as soon
a3 they can be finished, but must be
completed within a month. And by
the way, the workrooms have been
moved from the Elks building to the
Copper Queen library. A limited
number of machines are available at
the workrooms, but the women of the
district who wish to take garments
into their homes to finish will find
no dififculty in securing them.
"We are anxious to finish the gar
ment within. the month," said a mem
ber of the committee, "It should ap

Salvage Drive to Aid -Relief
Work
Remember, that bit of discarded
clothing you put-away a while ago?
Didn't know just why you saved it, al
though it was still in good condition.
Here is the opportunity to put it to
work. The Red Cross wants it.
A salvage- drive for the purpose of
collecting discarded clothing, old rub
ber, jewelry, tinfoil, metal or anything
which can be turned into money is to
be conducted by the Red Cross. In
fact salvage in thi3 case means any
thing which you cannot use which
could be used by someone else.
: .Spring housecleaning EhoulU offer
just the finest opportunity to bring
1 money into the Red Cross treasury.
Give up those things that you are not
using and which are doing no oneany
good. Put them towork. Just because
-the war is over there is no reason way
you should consider the work of the
Red Cross at an end. There is really
a stronger urge than before for there
is much to be done for the returning
soldiers as well as the refugees over
there. Do your bit, don't stop, don't
ever go slow.
Clothing" which is contributed may
be left at the Red Cross shop opposite
the Y. M. C. A. Other things junk
if you please to call it that, can be
left at Mr. Wood's shop on the Naco

For the past 16 years, since their

new room for the greater library, and

Mr. Vali has been connected with
the library for nearly as many years
as has his wife. Both have resigned,

Local Organization Which Has
Promoted Building Will
Discuss Business
The annual stockholders' meeting of
the Cochise Building & Loan associa
tion, will be held tomorrow night at
7:30 o'clock at the Calumet & Arizona
company's office at Warren. Business
and other important subjects will be
discussed.
The association which is entirely lo
cal, nd which was organized in 1907,
has been principally financed by the
Calumet & 'Arizona and Phelps Dodge
corporations, and its loans are con
fined to residents of the Warren dis
trict only.
Some idea of the volume of business
the association has done since its or
ganization can be obtained from the
following figures: . More than $300,000
has been loaned out since 1907, and of
that amount $225,000 is still out. A ma
jority ot the loans were made to those
who desired to purchase--their own
homes, and approximately 500 persons
were able to build their. own homes
because of the aid rendered them by
the association.
Following are the officers of the as
sociation: Gerald Sherman, president;
J. E. Curry, vice-president; M. J.
Cunningham, secretary-treasurer, and

HOUSE HIGHWAY BILL
TEMPORARILY HALTED
Delbridge Held Up Federal
Aid Measure Pending Ac
tion on Road Measures
PHOENIX. March 8. Dc-lbriJge ob
tained the postponment In the house
of his bill to provide $200,000 to
match federal post road requirements.
He laid he would prerer that the bill
be not considered on its third reading
till road legislation became more sta
bilized, and till he had had time to
.further inquire into the availability
of federal appropriations.
"When Gelbraith objected to defer
ring action on the bill Peterson asked
him if he remembered voting against
a bill carrying a like provision.
The reference was said to be to
the senate highways bill, against
which Galbraith Toted and which had
been amended to include a $200,000
provision to take advantage of federal
aid.
A mild argument developed on the
corporation commission's bill to alter
the statues so that when a corpora
tion appealed from an order of the
commission each day's lapse of time
till the appeal was decided would not
be listed as a separate offence. It
was argued for the bill that the
amendment was in line with rulings
of the United States supreme court,
but Phillips feared that it would give
corporation lawyers an opportunity to
hold up the state commission's rul
ings. Action on the measure was de
ferred. The senate bill providing for a

IRUGGISTS! VICK'S VAPORUB
SHORTAGE OVERCOME AT LAST
The Deal Scheduled for Last Novem
ber, Which Was PostDoned cm Ac
count of the Influenza Epidemic, Is !
now Ke-lnetated Good During the
Month of March
OVER ONE MILLION JARS OF
VAPORUB PRODUCED I
EACH WEEK
It is with rride that we announce
to the drug trade that the shortage of
Tick's VapoRub, which has lasted
since last October, is now overcome.
Since January 1st, we have been run
ning our laboratory twenty-three and
a half hours out of every twenty-four.
Last week we shipped the last of our
back orders, and retail druggists,
therefore, are no longer requested to
order in small quantities only.
NOVEMBER DEAL RE-INSTATED
This deal, which we had expected to
put on last November and which had
to be postponed on account of the
shortage of VapoRub, is re-instated for
the month of March. This allows a
discount of 10 per cent on shinments
from jobbers' stock of quantities of
from 1 to 4 gross, 5 per cent of this
discount fs allowed by the Jobber and
5 per cent by us.
We advise the retail druggists to
place their orders Immediately, so that
the jobbers will be able to get prompt
shipments to them.
THANKS OF THE PUBLIC DUE THE
DRUG TRADE DURING THE
INFLUENZA EPIDEMIC
The thanks of the American public
are certainly due the entire drug trace
retail, wholesale and manufacturing
for what they accomplished during
the recent influenza epidemic. The
war caused a shortage of physicians
nurses were almost impossible to ob
tain the demand on the drug trade
was unexpected and overwhelming,
and to this demand they responded
nobly. Retail druggists kept open
day and night and slept where they
dropped behind the prescription coun
ter. Wholesale drueeiats called their
salesmen off the road to help fill or
ders hundreds wired us to ship
Vick's VapoRub by the quickest route,
regardless of expense.

STATE LIBRARY IS
PLACED UNDER FIRE
PHOENIX. March 8 A bill intro
duced in the house today by Sealey
proposes to repeal the act establish
ing the state library, naming the cu
rators and librarian and fixing the ap
propriation. The present librarian. Con T. Cron-
in, is named to that position in the ex
isting act and it is recalled by older
members of the legislature that a
warm fight occurred in its passa?
against including his name in the bilf.
Sealey8 move to repeal the old act is
expected to renew the battle which
waged about the librarian at his ap
pointment four years ago.
Another measure,, fathered by How
ard, would class as an embezzler any
person entrusted with property as a
bailee, tenant or lodger or with any
power of attorney, who fraudulently
converts the property or proceeds to'
his own use.

consumption. Germany, to use a figure
of speech, is between the devil and
the deep blue sea. the devil in this in
stance being a debt which appals the
German statesmen and financiers. It
is to their interest to make it appear
as if they cannot pay anything like
what the allies will demand in the way
of indemnities, and every ruse and
artifice will be utilized in that direc
tion. In the end, however, Germany
must pay what the allies tell them is
the penalty for the crimes they have
committed. And Germany will pay, but t
without protest, threats, lamentations
such as we never heard before.
It would be easy to prove Germany
is bankrupt today.
It would be just as easy to prove she
is not.
It depends wholly upon how you
wish to view the situation.
As the wealth of nations is esti
mated Germany's wealth is put at ?S0,
000,000,000, and her national debt at
? 40,000,000,000. When you add to this
debt the indemnities which she must
pay the situation seems hopeless. That
is what the Germans would like the
world to think but the physicians of
finance among the allies have diag
nosed Germany's case and they will
prescribe a long course of treatment
lor the patient that may not be pleas
ant for the sufferer but will be satis
fying to tho others.
What the allies will exact from Ger
many is to be determined. . The esti
mates run from 40 billions to 100 bil
lions. Manifestly this could not be
added to Germany's domestic debt
without utterly crushing her.
There is legerdemain in the field of
finance as in other lines and we are
likely to see it in the way Germany's
debt problem is handled.' " -
Without any pretense to prescience
it may be said that something after
this form will be the plan:
The allies, after arriving at a fair
calculation of the cost of the war to
them, will estimate what it is possible
for Germany to pay. They, will figure
that, as Germany will not have to
maintain or must cot maintain a large
navy or standing army, the billion a
year saved will be equivalent to in
terest at 5 per eent on 20 billions.
They will insist that the internal
debt of 40 billions be scaled down or
deferred or both for the allies, neces
sarily, become preferred creditors.-
They will dismiss or give scant con
sideration to this 40 billions of domes
tic obligation. It may be funded to
be paid or, rather, to have interest
paid after the indemities are dis
charged, but not one mark until then.
If the allies believe Germany can
pay interest and principal on 50 bil
lions of indemnity that will be the
bill. The amount will be according
to their findings and it will be full.
Before Germany finishes paying she
may pay In interest and principal dou
ble or trebU the sum named as the
total of the damage claim.
As security . for the debt the ma
terial .resources of. Germany coal
mines, potash beds and other proper
ties of value greater than her esti
mated national wealth may be
pledged.
The -estimated national wealth of a
nation is no index to the material un
developed wealth. For example: The
British national wealth Is put at 100
billion dollars, yet the value of her
coal that has yet to be mined is esti
mated at 700 billions. That last esti
mate is speculative purely, but it
serves to illustrate the point..
In figuring on Germany's ability to
pay, the allies will not overlook the
fact that the Teutonic empire, while,
stripped of Alsace-Lorraine and per
haps of some eastern provinces, will
absorb German Austria and be as
large, if cot larger than before. Also
that Germany's industrial and agricul
tural establishment has not been im
paired seriously. Likewise that in the
governmental overturn there has been j
a speedy return to order. j
To safeguard themselves in the per-1
iod of reconstruction and after and to !
lighten the burden of their taxation j
as well as to make it impossible for I
Germany to outstrip them commercial-1
ly. they must draw from Germany all
that Germany can bear without having
her vitally impaired. j
No rei"on now on earth probably
will live to see the day when Germany
has paid the last dollar of her war
debt. To children and children of
children now unborn the burden will
be passed.
It la because the Germans know this i
that we have such emanations as that
from Weimar by way of Zurich. ,

NEW YORK. March S. The "no-

hit with New York magnates of the
squared circle.
Without exception they back tne
stand taken by Frank Mills, superin
tendent of the Cincinnati gymnasium
and athletic club, who has forbidden
any boxer to climb into the ring if he
has his hair hanging down over his

'Tv always been opposed to the

He is Fred Dyer, the singing welter

"It's craza fora fighter who wants

that most of the time he is in tne

who is now in Xew Y'ork. said:
"Twenty-five years ago we never
thought of cultivating a thatch like
Paderewski. Most of us kept our hair
close cropped to improve our vision.
All the training 1 used to do when I
was in my prime was to get a haircut
and shave before climbing through
the ropes."
But in spite of the foregoing opin

Terrible Terry McGovern scared many
an opponent with his ruffled fur. A

be attributed to his ferocious appear

NEW YORK. March S. The brief;
session of the stock market today;
was characterized by extraordinary!
activity and further bullish enthu
siasm which lifted many issues to
top levels of the year
Among the influences which rave
fresh stimulus to the advance was'
the report that the 1 administration
had ordered another postponement in
the pending anti-trust litigation. In
dications that the railroads would
soon be provided with funds was an
other hopeful factor.
There was a noticeable increase of
outside interest in the market which
concentrated largely in steels', equip
ments and shipping, rails failing to
fulfill their early promise of
strength.
United States Steel contributed al
most one-fifth to the day's business
at an extreme advance of 1 points
to 97, but affiliated stocks gained 2
to 5 points.
Marine preferred yielded ,part of
its 3 points rise, but other shippings
were less susceptible to realizing.
Sugars, fertilizers, coppers and util
ities helped to swell the advance, but
motors, oils and tobaccos were irreg
ular. Sales amounted to 70,000
shares.
Last week's large actual loan ex
pansion of clearing . house banks was
materially reduced today, excess re
servies showing a further moderate
gain.
Liberty Bonds held steady other
domestic issues were firm and for
eign flotations made slight gains. To
tal sales, ' par value, aggregated $6,
350,000. Old United States were un
changed on call during the week.
NEW . YORK, March 8. Pro
nounced expansion of activity on the
stock exchange this week heightened
the impression prevalent in specula
tive quarters that the country has
discovered many of the grave prob
lems which clouded the financial hori
zon in the first monhts of the post
war period.
Defeat of the general deficency bill
caused moderate reversals among
rails, which were fully retrieved la
ter. Interest in the industrial situa
tion converged around the confer
ences between steel and iron pro
ducers and representatives of the de
partment of commerce for the stab!
lization of that industry. Despite the
anguine views of industrial execu
tives there is a fast growing convic
tion in trade ' circles that further
gardless of wage schedules.
price reductions are imminent, regard
less of wage schedules.
.That the country, is doing a very
large and profitable general business
and that money is reasonably free for
constructive purposes is evidenced by
the enormous bank clearings and the
comparatively easy rates for time and
call funds.

. PHOtNIX, March 8. Late this af-
leraoon the senate attempted to pass
senate bill 17, the highway commis

By special resolution yesterday 2:30

Fire in the S'nattuek mine on tte
700-fobt level, which two weeks ago
forced the closing of the mine, has
been placed under control. Within the
next three weeks It will have been
entirely extinguished, when work of
reopening the mine will be started.
The fire originated in sulphide ores
of the lower levels, and was caused
by friction of the sliding grown and
overheated rock. For several days it
gained headway in spite of the most
strenuous efforts to bulkhead it off
and smother the flames. Meantime
water vras obtained from the city

Yesterday it was announced that the

, "Bat the governor's objections will
not bear the light of analysis. He
says he is adamant in his determina
tion that there shall be no roads,

he has full control.
"On the other hand," continued Win
or, "the people of Arizona want good

Further, there is no constitutional au

Appointor of the servants of the peo

People Want Roads
; "With regard to the governor's ob
jection to the naming of the presi
dent of the senate and the speaker of
the house on the board to appoint
'te highway commission, how does he
dare to play with the people's de
mands by raising these technical
quibbles?
'-But," concluded, the senator, "all
this is begging the question. The
people are willing to, take . their
chances in the supreme court on the
legal objections raised by the chief
- executive to senate bill 17. if they
only-get their roads.- All they ask -is
that the governor get out of the way
of the wheels of progress and I urge
this, senate to pass this bill over the
veto of the executive, and if it can
not be, to place in his hands another
highway bill which will " give him
.again the opportunity, to let the peo
ple of Arizona have what they want,
good roads."
, Clarldge followed Winsor with an
appeal to the Republicans to disre-
gard the governor and pass the high
way bilL He said that Republican ob
jections to taking authority from the
executive were ill-founded, since they
had voted In other days to do that
very thing to a Democrat governor.
' Wilkinson, leader of the minority,
after .waiting for any further. Demo
cratic speeches, then took the floor.
Arizona Watches Legislature
.There is no question," said he, "but
that the eyes of the people ot Ari
zone are focussed on this legislature
and particularly on this session ot the
senate, and for this reason I wish to
say that all the facts In connection
with senate bill 17 have not been
brought out. .
"When this measure was introduced
the president of the senate and the
speaker of the house were not in
cluded on the board to name- trie
highway commission, and In that form
It passed this senate. Bur an amend
ment to include those two officers'
was Inserted In -the- house and the
senate concurred.
The natural and regular method of
appointing a commission Is .by - the
chief executive of the state and when
that method Is not followed a good
reason must be 'advanced for acting
otherwise. I have yet to hear that
good reason. . r
"This bill was submitted without
any real discussion In the senate to
the 'predestination - committee' and
after that anything said here fell on
deaf ears. It Wis not threshed out in
the senate and each member left to
consider ft for himself, but the amend
ment to name the president of this
body and the speaker of the house on
the board was made, and thereafter it
became a political measure.

was made a political measure.
"An amendment was added in the
hcuse to Include Jn bill : 17 the pro
vision of another bill to raise an an
nual road levy of $1.500,(J)0. Can
you conceive of any other reason for
this than to make it difficult for the
governor to avoid exercising his veto
and thus throw the failure of good
reads legislation on his shoulders.
"Today I have introduced a new
highway bill, following the style of
the Colorado law and providing for
the appointing of a highway commis
sion by the governor. The people
want the commission appointed by
tbefr chief executive so that they may
be able to fix the responsibility tor
road construction. .
"In conclusion I want to say that
the governor could not have retained
hij own self respect and the respect
cf the people of this state if he had
done otherwise than veto senate bill
17." : "
When the veto was taken Herndon
was absent, having been excused. The
tally was 13 to pass and five against.
As an emergency, measure requires a
three-fourths vote to pass over the ex
ecutive veto, the motion, was lost. The
following voted no: Buehman, Good
ell, Green, Whiting, Wilkinson. '
Road Sections Provided
Wilkinson's bill, which is modeled
after the Colorado law in its general
clauses, has one exception in that it
provides for the division of the state
into four sections for road building
purposes: Section 1, Mohave, Cocon
ino, Navajo and Apache counties.
Section 2. Yavapai. Maricopa and
Yuma. Section 3, Gila, Graham and
Freenlee. Section 4, Cochise, Santa
Cruz, Pima and Pinal,
There would be a commission of
five members, four appointed by tne
governor, one from each of the four
state divisions and the fifth a profes
sor of engineering from the University
of ATlzona. The terms, of tne mem
bers would be from one to five years
to be determined by lot. The hill
wuJd raise an annual levy for roads
of $1,500,000 to be expended under the
authority of the commission.
DOUGLAS. March S. Those who
have been watching the progress of
the Kacozari Consolidated Copper
company, whose property lies adjac
ent to the Phelps-Dodge mines at
Nacozari. will be interested to learn
that the company's main development
tunnel is reported to have entered a
large brecciated zone, showing heavy
sulphides, of Bllver-lead and copper
pyrites. ' The mineralization, states
President Alexander, appears to be
very extensive, and tiie company con
fidently expects to open up an im
portant deposit of commercial ore
within the next thirty to sixty days.
3ir. Alexander further states ' The
big tunnel - was advanced over one
hundred feet in February, with the
hand-drills, and more than two hun
dred feet of progress should be made
during March, as the new , machine
drills, were placed in operation on
March 3. . The mineral encountered
in the main breast is ilosely identified
with the Pilares ore, and. is convincing
evidence of our proximity to the main
copper property, which we should top
within from three to six months of i
steady . development.
"Our company is taking every ad- j
vantage of the prevailing copper de-1
pression to complete all necessary de-1
velopment and dead-work, and we feel
very confident that our. preperty will
be prepared to commence very active
production, when the copper situation
returns to a more normal basis. . In
the meantime we shall profit through
the high price of silver, by extracting
and marketing a few carloads, of gold-silver-lead
ore, while crowding pro
gress in the main workings. Annual
statement and report of the company
will be mailed to our stockholders
within a few days."

(ContlnuPd from Pape Onel
away from places where they en
danger the lives of men who are good
intelligent citizens.
"With the mining industry in ex
tent about ten per cent per year, the
leaders believe that we need all the
men we can get. If that is true, let us
give these men a decent chance for
their lives, and let U3 give the miners
from the english peaking races, who
do understand the dififculties and
dangers, a litla more than a- 50-50
chance for their lives.
"There are two points in this that
appeal to me. . First, it is our duty
as citizens to make better citizens out
of these non-English-speaking foreign
ers and save them from the dangers I
we know so well, and second, it is
our greatest duty to furnish our own I
English-speaking miners with the pro
tection they are entitled to against
the irresponsible and ignorant type of
miner who ' does not understand the
dangers and apparently cares so lit
tle about them. The mad dog that is
running amuck in the mining industry
today is the .foreign-born from the
non-English-speaking races who does
not kpow the English language and
who in a majority of instances is so
ignorant that he doesn't know how to
read or write even his own language."
