(Undated War Lead by the Associated

French pressure along the line from
the Marne to the Aisne, which began
two weeks ago as a series of local at
tacks, has begun to yield results which
are appreciable when viewed on the
map. The town of Corey and strong
positions in that vicinity have been
captured by the slow, methodical ad
vance that has been the source or
much annoyance to the enemy for sev
eral days.
As a result of the assaults made by
the French from Amblemy south of
the Aisne, to the hills south of Carey,
their line has been advanced to higii
ground which lends itself to defensive
operations and gives the French ob
servation points from which they can
see what is going on behind the Ger
man lines.
There has been some reason for be
lieving that when the Germans resume
their offensive on the western front
they will attempt to break through be
tween the Marne and Aisne in a dash
straight for Paris. For this reason,
the operations which the French have
carried out assume importance. South
of Corey the German line extends
slightly to the westward, but it curves
sharply eastward just before it reaches
the Clignon river, northwest of V.b-i-teau
Ttierry. From the C'lignon south
ward to the Marne, American forces
have been improving their positions in
recent days and now have a strong
line of positions running northward
from hill 204, west of Chateau Thierry,
to the village of Torcy.
On the British front the Australians
have been in action once more, pene
trating German positions and captur
ing prisoners. On the rest of the line
held by the British there have been
the usual artillery duels.
French and Italian detachments are
steadily pushing Austrian forces back
along the western slopes of the moun
tains that parallel the coast of Al
bania. They are reported north of the im
portant town of Berat and have moved
ahead in the hilly country to the east.
Vienna admits the allied success m
this quarter.
In the mountain sectors of the north
ern Italian front Austrian units which
approached the Italian positions have
been driven back.
Bolsheviki forces have engaged in
battles with the Czecho slovaks in
European Russia, and an official state
ment issued at Moscow claims that
victories have been won at various
points. The fighting appears to -ave
been hardest in the region of the east
and southeast of Petrograd. whicli
may indicate that the Czecho slovaks
have advanced from the Urals, where
they have been reported active for
some weeks.
A Peking dispatch statea that the
Czecho-SIovaks are in virtual control
of ail of western Siberia. Over vast
stretches of this country they have
triumphed over the bolsheviki. Tha
overthrow of the bolsheviki at Irkutsk
has been confirmed.
An official statement from Berlin
says that five of a squadron of six
American airplanes which started out
with the intention of bombing the city
of Coblenz fell into the hands of the
Germans.
Sir George Cave. British home secre

Mr. Becker emnfcisizad the point
that, while the United States was

American gold, exchanged for mere

Many Americans ho raid, invested In i
the German bends before this country

LONDON, July 11 The menace of
enemy aliens living freely in England
has been the text of newspaper agita
tion in the last two weeks more keen
ly than any of the numerous anti-German
waves of feeling which the coun
try experiences at frequent intervals
since the war began.
The subject was discussed in the
house of common today,, the house
having before it the report of the com
mittee of six which Premier Lloyd
George appointed July 8 to consider
the question and make recommenda
tions. The home secretary. Sir George j
cave, wnose department has cuarge
of aliens, said the principal recom -
mendations of the committees w-jll be
carried into effect. The foremost Is
the winding up of German hanks,
which have been in the hands of re
ceivers for more than three years, and
the closing of which has been demand
ed by the newspapers for more than
a year
The secretary said it would be made
impossible for the banks to reopen for
some years after the war. The fact
is, however, that any future cabinet
may unmake any such policy framed
by the present cabinet if it wish-js.
Many Germans and persons of Ger
man descent have been changing their
names during the war. The committee
proposes that tlr changes he cancelled
or that they be not permitted to take
effect until six months after the war.
There are only a few thousand
aliens left uninterned in England. A
considerable proportion of them are
old people. Another fairly large con
tingent has some one serving in the
British army and there is a sharp dif
ference of opinion on the question of
interning tnese.
"Intern them all," is the watchword
of the extremists, led by the North
cliffe papers. Other papers, like the
Westminster Gazette and Daily New",
the Daily Chronicle and the Manches
ter Guardian, liken the present move
ment to "witching baiting" and the
historic "no popery" agitation.
Parliament todav deoated the ques
tion of the treatment of enemy aliens
and persons of the alien origin which
has been the subject of much discus
sion recently in the press and on
which a committee of the house of
commons on July 8 issued a report.
, , The committee recommended the
immediate interning of every male en
emy alien over 18 years, except those
who. for medical or other reasans
should be exempted and the repatriat
ing of all female enemy aliens except
those whose husbands had been grant
ed exemntion from internment. The
committee also recommended the im
mediate discharge of all such persons
employed in any government depart
nient, and that all enemy businesses
should, be wound up within threi'
months.
Sir George Cave, secretary for home
affairs, who owned the debate, re
ferring to the public anxiety on the
question, said he believed this anxiety
was due to insufficient knowledge ot
the steps taken to protect the coun
try from anything like alien danger.
Such outrages as the sinking of hos
pital ships. Sir George said, must af
feet the point of view from which the
question was approached. If the enemy
permitted acts of that kind, enemy
subjects must suffer in the estimate
which all decent people formed of
them.
The government proposed, he said,
to ask the committees in each coun'y
to undertake the revision of all exemp
tions from internments in the case of
i men and exemptions from repatriation
I tn the case of women.

! FUNERAL UNIQUE
IN HISTORY OF
THIS COUNTRY
(Contlnued from Page On)
Soldiers, sailors, policemen, firemen,
RpH PniKa nurses distinguished civil
ians, notable men- representing the al
lied and other nations, 10,000 iu all
composed the cortege.
Major Mitchel"s horse, shrouded In
black, with boots reversed in the stir
rups and bearing aiso his reversed
sword, followed the gun carriage
which bore the coffin draped with the
Stars and Stripes. Bands played fu
neral marches. While silent crowds
watched reverently, much of the city's
business was suspended. All the ex
changes and many commercial houses
were closed for an hour and when the
body was being lowered into the grave
street and subway cars stopped for an
interval of one minute.
At the cathedral the beautiful "die
obitir" mass of requiem stirred tne
emotion of the great throng of mourn
ers Tears stood in the eyes of many
as the great organ pealed "The Star
Spangled Banner" at the close of the
services. The 'eighteen birdmen from Mineola,
in charge of Flight Commander Lieut.
Frank C. Davidson, desiring to honor
the deceased, even as Guynenier, the
great French "Ace" had been honored
in France, flew at the lowest altitude
ever dared by flying men over Ne
York City. Some went lower than 800
feet, it was said, notwithstanding the
riBk of deadly air pockets. The avia
tors had been instructed to land in
the river if forced to descend by en
gine or other trouble. They carried
aloft more than two wagon loads of
roses, gladiola, carnations and other
flowers.
For half an hour after the last rites
they continued to circle above the
grave like enormous American eagles
guarding the soldier dead.

Boureschos. The activity of the Ger-
i man artillery was not abnormal and
consisted mainly cf harrassing fire on
our front line. Gas was, as usual,
employed In the shelling of the Mar
rette, Uie Belleau and other woods.
The number of German airplanes in
operation again decreased. In the Ger
man rear areas the movement ob
served were mainly those of men in
groups of small cr moderate sizes.
j Our own troops were active in patrol
ling and in artillery' fire. In the Marne
sector from July 7 to S the day passed
I almost without incident. The enemy's
j artillery fire was lighter than on the
preceding day and only a few plane
i were seen. His trench mortars were
! active for a time during the evening.
I There was little activity on our side
Our batteries exploded one of the
enemy's dumps.
"In the Woevcre there were no no
table events between July 3 and July
6 except the attempts of parties of
the enemy to penetrate our lines, espe
cially in the region of Xivray. On the
night of July 3 a German patrol was
driven tack by one of our patrols af
ter an exchange of fire.
On the night of July 4 one of orr
cut posts in this region was fired on by
a German patrol but sustained no cas-
I ualtics. On the night or July 4 '
; strong trman patrol Pttccked a weak
j outpost at Xivray with the intention
of taking prisoners. Our outpost ex
changed hand grenades Ire with the
assaulters. The Germans having failed
in their purpose, withdrew fniu the
outpost, which was then reoccupied.
On the same night there was an ex
change of grenade fire between an
other of our outposts and a German
patrol and at another point a patrol
I encounter. During all three days the
enemy's artillery maintained a rate of
f re which is abnormal for a ijuiet sec
tor distributing his shells over our
front and rear areas and our lines of
communication. Only a small amount
. cf gas was used. His airplanes and
! balloons did little work between July
(3 and 4, but were materially active
between July 4 a:id C. Our own forces
I were active mainly in artillery work.
! The German lines w ere heavily shelled
with gas on the morning of July o.
In the Lorarine sector the outstand
ing incidents of July 6 and 7 were
the activities of the enemy patrolling
parties and of cur own. During the
night three German patrols approach
ing our lines, two coming under our
fire. One of them used lurht machine
guns but was thrown back by our rifle
and grenade fire after a light lasting
twenty minutes.

MURAVIEFF SUICIDES
LONDON, July 11 General Mura
vieff, commander of the bolshevini
forces operating against the Czecho
slovaks, has committed suicide accord
ing to an official Russian wireless dis
patch received here. The dispatch
which denounces General Muravieff as
a traitor, reads:
"He issued a false and treacherous
order to his troops and sought to ai
red an offensive against the soviet
government of Russia. He ordered hi3
men to advance against Moscow and
at the same time attacked the town
of Simbirsk, in the V olga region, inc
soviet troops, however, declined to
obey his orders and remained faithful
to the Soviet s authority. Finding the
troops would not follow him in betray
ing the revolution, traitor Muraviert
shot himself.
"On the Czecho-Siovak front all is
quiet and the situation is secure.
Troops are preparing for a further
offensive against Czecho-Slovaks and
White Guards."
General Muravieff, under the imper
ial regime was police inspector of
Petrograd with the rank of colonel.
Upon the outbreak of the revolution
he joined the bolshevik! and comman l
ed the forces which defeated General
Korniloff when the latter was within
fifteen miles of Petrograd. He con
tinued in the service of the bolshevik!,
whom he now is accused of betraying.

troubles, but I have gotten both and
of course I'm strong far Tanlac now,"
said C. A. Truman, a well known car
penter who lives at 947 '4 Tacoma Ave.,
Tacoma, Wash.
For five or six years," he continued,
"I have suffered with catarrh of the
stomach. I got to where I had no
relish for food of any kind, r.s ?v
everything was tasteless to me. I lost
my appetite entirely and really
couldn't eat enough to keep my
strength, and sometimes I thought I
would just have to give up altogether.
My head ached a great deal of the tiaie
and I was so nervous I could liardiy
sleep. My kidneys were badly out of
order, my bark pained me terribly and
I lost weight and strength right along.
My whole system seemed to be in bad
shape and I had reached the point
where I hardly felt fit for anything.
"But Tanlac has made a great
change in me. I have not only got
ten rid of my troubles, but I have
already gained about fifteen pounds
and have just finithed mv second bot
tle of Tanlac. My appetite is o big
that I can hardly get enough to eat
and nothing hurts me any more. My
headaches have been broken up, the
pain is gone out o my back and my
kidneys never bother me at all. I go
to sleep almost as soon as I get i:i
bed and I don't know a thins until
getting up time in the mornings. I
found out about Taa'acty reading the
endorsements in the pape-s and to say

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. July 11. Storks were
heavily liquidated in the Initial period
of today's session, the movement be
ing provoked by overnight reports that
some of the more important equip
ment and munitions companies had
applied to the federal government for
linancial aid. These reports had their
cri:;in in the fact that the -bankers
comprising the Bethlehem Steel $30,
000,0"0 note syndicate have requested
the war finance corporation to furn
ish $20,000,000 of that issue in .event
of their inability to market the en
tire amount.
Selling naturally concentrated in is
sues of that divisions, United States
Steel being offered in large quanti-
ties at an extreme reversal of 2'i
points. Bethlehem "A" stock reacted
5 points and the "B" or non-voting
stock broke two points.
Rails withstood the pressure better
than any other group losses among
such representative shares as Read
ing, Union Pacific and grangers be
ing limited to 1 or 1 t, points. Sales
amounted to 615,000 shares.
Foreign news, including the bank of
England's weekly statement, was mail
ly favorable but played no part in to
day's events.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 11. Highest prices
yet for grain this season resulted to
day to a considerable degree from good
milling and shipping demand. Corn
closed strong. 2 to 4 net higher,
with September $1.59 to $1.59'.;.
Oats gained cent to cent and pro
visions 30 cents.
Corn trades seemed to be much im
pressed with indications there would
be free use of substitutes of wh"at
and especially with the fact that mill
ing interests were competing sharply
for good corn.
Dry weather reports from western
Canada had a bullish effect on oats.
Receipts, however, were liberal and
seaboard sales only moderate.
Provisions rose with grain
and!"""-"
nogs. Realizing sales tended some
what to check the bulge.

BASEBALL CHAMPS
WILL EE DECIDED
The Junction Briggs and C. & A.
teams are practicing daily In prepara
tion for the Sunday game, when the
championship of the first half of the
season will he decided. It is now up
to Oswalt and Schatzleln and the big
sticks of the other eight men on each
team. On paper the Junctions seem to
be the best hitting club, but even the
best of them look weak before such
pitching as Schatzlein showed In the
game he pitched here on the Fourth
of July. The wrecking crew of the
Qupen t-jani did not batter down any
fences off his hooks and he will prob
ably nake many of the Junction hit
smiths lay down their clubs and walk
back to the bench. If he is right, he
will make Jake Wilson. Bob Whaling,
Andy Bijohn and Goose Plttman look
bad and there will be nothing to it.
The big game is only a part of the
big field day program. The soldiers
of company L infantry will go through
a number of drills and will also give
some of their training stunts and the
'ast part of the program will be the
raseball game between company L and
the negro team of troop M, 10th cav
alry. Those who saw the last game
the black men played here will not'
want to miss the one Sunday. The
program starts promptly at 2 o'clock
with the beginning of the program of
drills, 3tc, by the doutrbboys, then
tne league game pnd finally -.he game
between the horse sodiers and the
doughboys.

J The Fourteenth of July
Since Mayor Erickson is urging Bisbee to
observe in some manner the French na
tional holiday of the Fourteenth of July,
a brief andsimple discussion of the origin
and the purpose of the day might not be
amiss at this time, even to those of our
readers who have read and studied more
about this event than has the writer, for a
different viewpoint might be gained, if not
more knowledge. After all, the Fourteenth
of July marked an epoch and not a mere
date. It marked the first change in human
affairs in France for seventeen centuries.
The day. itself, like most immortal days,
was sordid and shabby enough, and to those
who saw it by the light of that sun its
bloodstains shene through its rags. Fcr,
be it known, upon that day, in the year
1789, a mob of wild, bloodthirsty, dirty,
implacable revolutionists, men and women,
stormed the Bastile, also known as the
Castle of Paris, and put to death the gov
ernor and seven of his small company of
soldiers, and liberated something like a
dozen state prisoners and carried them on
their shoulders in triumph. They also
burned the great prison and tore down its
massive walls.
This was a mere incident in the red haze
of the great French revolution, and yet it
was perfectly natural that France should
date her real liberty from this day. For the
Castle of Paris, the Bastile, had stood
astride te San Antonio gate for 400 years
as the symbol of kingly power, and its
mighty bastions and walls had thrown their
shadow over the city as a menace to all
men, and no man within that shadow knew
whether or not he was free. At the king's
whim or fancy or humor, any one might
be taken from the bright sunlight and the
winds of heaven and placed within these
dark walls and held there forever. No man,
be he bourgeois, gamin, nobleman, soldier,
merchant or priest, ever looked at those
terrible frowning, mysterious impregnable
walls without a shudder. He did not know
at what hour the king's man might place
his hand upon his shoulder and lead him
away to the Bastile.
For four centuries the Bastile was a v
name to conjure with in France. Grim and
fearful and many were the legends that
clung to every stone of its ancient towers.
How many millions of Frenchmen in each
of the scores and scores of generations that
had lived under its shadow had felt and
known and whispered the awe they( felt
for this prison. It was the king's own
castle and there men were fed and lodged
at the king's expense. It was easy to enter
the Bastile and hard to get out again. It
stood in one of the most prominent places
in Paris and its towers were a landmark
and its bastions dominated the entire city.
Knowing full well the multiplied power of
mystery, the kings and ministers and card
inals and princes who had the power of the
high justice, the middle and the low of the
old days in France, took care that the peo
ple should know as little as possible of the
Bastile and its dark secrets and of the com
ing and going of its prisoners and of the
administration of its affairs in general. So .
it was that the Bastile came to be an insti
tution as well as a prison. Its name served
for the name of all prisons; its crown of
power and symbol of oppression became
lesion and all France shrunk instinctively
from its subtle and pervading menace. Thus
through the ages the psychology of the
king's prison and its mission grew until it
was an actual part of the kingship in
France. As D'Arhnan. the king's musk
eteer, onre said, after taking a prisoner
there, "I seemed to feel the cold breath of
this ptace and I did not breathe freely until
outside of its walls. The governor asked
me to stay and sup with him. but curse me
if I could eat a morsel of food in there."
And this mob of wild, fierce, bloody
men ard women who stormed that prison
that civ; this sad. sadden, terrible mob,
was nothing more or less than the new born
spirit of liberty tearing down old walls of
oppression forever. As individuals these
men were monsters, and viewed from the
staring, frightened eyes of their day, their
acts were crimes. But as a whole, these
men were nothing more or less than the
culmination of 1700 years of oppression;
cruelty and woe, and their acts, viewed by
the ages that came after them, were as
glorious and fine as that of the angel that
led Peter from the walls of his Roman
prison.
The mob of Paris, led by wild and wolf
ish leaders, had destroyed the Swiss guards
and seized and sacked the palaces and
killed the king and flushed the gutters with
blood, but still the revolution was not an
accomplished fact until the shadow cast by
the walls of Bastile was no more. The
king's prison was as mighty as the king.
And so it was that on the Fourteenth of
July, over 100 years ago, one set of
Parisians stormed the Bastile, and then
later, another set erected upon the site of
this famous monument to kingly power,
a beautiful column, known as the Column
of July, and this column means as much
to France as ever the Bunker Hill monu
ment meant to America, or ever will mean.
For those wild Frenchmen who razed a
prison for a glory shaft had suffered almost
as many centuries of oppression as the
American colonies had years. It was not
the spirit of independence that made the
taking of the Bastile possible, it was the
spirit of despair. Hence the natural vio
lence and terror and cruelty and crimes of
the French revolution.
But make no mistake about those
Frenchmen of that day. They are not to
be named with or compared with the Rus
sians of today. France of the revolution
deserted no ally, for she had none. Every
country of Europe had a king then, and
every king moved against France. And
these Frenchmen, born again of the miracle
breath of their revolution, went forth to
battle on their own borders and beat the
might of Prussia at Valmy, immortal as
one of the decisive battles of the world.
They settled their own affairs, these
French. They killed their king and his
nobles, it is true, but they were willing to
die before any foreign power should defile
their own land. They kept their borders
inviolate until they had worked out their
own destiny of freedom. They even made
Napoleon an emperor and followed him to
the greatest glory any nation of the world
ever knew. They voluntarily gave up
their freedom once under the spell of the
great Little Corporal, and they lost it agdn
to others who came after him, and who
were very small, but not for long; not for
long. The Bastile was no more, hence no
ruler could long keep the Parisian in bond
age.
And cn the Fourteenth of July, soon to
come this year, this column of July, radiant
ly adorning the dismal ground where the
blighting shadow of the Bastile fell, will
illumine the entire world with the splendor
of its glory, born of liberty, burning bright
er evtfry year, and tested now as no up
reared column of human liberty has ever
been tested since Pharoah set the children
of Israel free.
AT LAST!
Production of Liberty motors in Amer
ican workshops in May and June equaled
the production of aeronautical engines of
all types in Great Britain for the entire year
of 1915, according to John D. Ryan, 'chair
man of the aircraft production board, in a
recent speech.
A famous French general has declared
that in the next general order that Ballieau
Wood shall henceforth be called "The
Wood of the Americans." Ah, that little
patch of trees and rough ground, soaked
with blood, shall go down in the history of
France with a golden glow that will never
fade. Another glorious tradition added to
American annals. "A Yorktown in France!
This general was in command of American
troops in this sector, and his tribute to their
daring, courage and skill, will thrill this na
tion from sea to sea. Right in the heart
of France, on the skirts of her most terrible
and decisive battle line, lies a wood "The
Wood of the Americans!"
Now that it has been asceitained that
the New York Mail and Express has long
been owned and controlled by the German
government, its bitter attacks upon the Bis
bee deportation are easily explained and
understood.

EAGLE TODAY.
Douglas Fairbanks' breezy and en
gaging personality has never shown to
better advantage than in "American
Aristocracy." As all patrons of Fair
banks' films know, Douglas never
walks when he can run, never enters
a gate when he can vault a fence,
never uses-a pair of stairs when ho
can scale a balcony, or utilizes a pro
saic fire-escape while there is a rope
that will take him to the top of a build
ing, hand-over-hand. AH of these amus
ing mannerisms are allowed full play
in "American Aristocracy." to the evi
dent delight of "Doug" himself and the
entire satisfaction of his spectators.
MET WITH DELEGATE.
A number of Warren district road
boosters met at the Commercial club
headquarters yesterday morning to
confer with L. Henderson, about the
routing or the Dixie highway through
Arizona. There were no direct prom
ises made by the Warren district
members as the Dixie route through
Texas does not follow the Bankhead
route and the Warren district support
has already been given to a number
of Texas towns for that route so that
they could not do anything on the
Texas part of the route but will dc(
some boosting if it comes via Doug
las and Bisbee.

WILLIAM LUTLEY HAS
BEEN LOOKING
AFTER MINES
Spent Several Days Fixing Up
Monuments and Buildings
on His Property in Sonora,
Below Douglas
William Lutley the Tombstone min
ing and cattleman was in the city yes
terday on his way home to that city
from a visit to-his mines in Sonora
and his cattle ranges in the Swiss
hlems and Sulphur Springs valley. He
spent some time at his San Marcus
mine, in the Santa Rita district, south
cf Douglas, rebuilding monuments on
that property and - painting them in
compliance with a new rule of the
Mexican government.
several enrs ago Mr. Lutley mined
atid f-hipped 100,000 tons of ore from
t!-- San Marcus property. At that
time he installed modern machinery,
boilers, compressors, etc. Work was
discontinued about the time of the
Madero revolution in that country.
Since that time the machinery plant
has been pretty badly wrecked; brats
jourrals have been removed and car
ried away and buildings torn down
for the lumber to be had. Mr. Lutley
said that even with the present price
on cepper, it would hardly pay him
to mine and ship ore from the mines
because of the fact that the great pre
dominate ores are too low grade and
for every ton shipped many tons
would have to be left on the dump.
However, this ore could all be concen
trated easily and the quantity of low
grade ores available would require a
large mill. Some day a mill will prob
ably be erected and then the San
Marcus will become a fine property.
Speaking of Jiis trip to Mexico this
morning Lutley said that when he was
working on his mine monuments yes
terday he suffered greatly from the
heat and things it was the hottest day
he ever experienced in the southwest.
Regarding the condition of the range
in the Sulphur Springs valley, Mr.
Lutley said that as a result of the
recent rains, grass is now growing fast
and cattle are all in good condition
again. He said that the early rains
this season did not come too soon as
the range cattle were in bad shape.
Many cattle had been kept alive by
feeding them soap weed ground up.
He explained that feeding range cattle
was a difficult problem, as It requires
time to teach the range cow to eat
cotton seed meal and when she learns
there is danger of eating too mtjch,
which is daneercus.

CHAPLIN JINGLE AT
LYRIC THEATER TODAY
Essanay has released a five-part
Chaplin comedy, which is said to be
the greatest laughter frolic of the
year.
It is a Chaplin jingle, carrying the
tit V o: "Chase Me Charlie." and is a
British version of Chaplin's funniest
films, taken from the famous Essanay
Chaplin comedies.
Scenes have been taken from twelve
films and combined to form a new
story. It is said by those who have
seen the film that the various parts
harmonize perfectly to form a com
plete whole. The continuity is added
by new subtitles which have been writ
ten in jingle form.
Kspanay announces that in making I
this film the greatest care was taken
to select only the funniest scenes, with
the swiftest action and the most droll
situations.
It is comedy that will appeal to
every class of spectator, from the one
who loves the slap stick and the rapid
fire action and the comic situations,
to more exacting, who can see the sub
tlety of the various points which Char
lie Chaplin brings out of the compli
cated situations.
See it at Lyric theater today.

The poem follows:
Salfy Sailors Salvage Sweets
From -the Acean far away.
Where the waves and U-boats play.
Comes a whisper sad and gay.
Hearken to the salty lay.
"Half a score of Jackies we.
Helping Vtep Fritz off the sea.
Jolly sailors bold and free.
Yet more happy can we be.
We whose feet once earned renown.
Now as candy-hounds are known,
But these days we only groan.
'Cause no candy are we shown.
So we tars who sail the blue.
Make this offer, girls, to you.
The nicest present Jackie knows.
For the nicest candy goes.
And any girl whose candy conies.
Can rest assured we'll eat the
crumbs.
And she will get a picture, too.
From the sailors of the blue.
To take no chance of getting sick,
