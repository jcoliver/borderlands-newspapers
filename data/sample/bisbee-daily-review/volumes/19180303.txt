Moving up the guns in France is
an interesting but difficult maneuver
owing to the soft character of the
ground and the great weight of the
guns. Despite the labor involved
the men are always cheerful because
the guns are moving toward the
enemy. When the big British guns
are shelling the German trenches,
the noise of the cannonading is often
heard on the south coast of Kent,
England, and even as far as the out

evening. ;
White and Freeman entered the
ring on tip toes and started slugging
tactics from the sounding of th first
gong. White opened op the affair,
when he landed a stiff right to the
local man's jaw. following this with '
a left to the face. Then Freeman j
opened up. He had the advantage of
reach and cf weight, and inside a few!
moments had pounded White about j

soldier was game, though, and came
lark in the second round plugging
and swinging. Several times he fell
to thefloor when is groggy. wild(
punches went into the air. and finally t

A FLASH OF AMERICAN SPIRIT.
The El Paso Herald tells the following
story of Major John Greenway and the
Bisbee spirit of patriotism as exemplified
by "Bill" Davidson:
An outcropping cf the old Rough Rider
spirit occurred about the time John C.
Greenway, general manager of the Calu
met and Arizona company, took a major's
commission and went to France as an en
gineer for Pershing. It was recalled to mind
by the announcement that Major Green
way has been appointed chief of construc
tion for the American expeditionary force.
On the night Major Greenway was
leaving Bisbee, a banquet was given hirr.
and during the banquet there drifted in one
William Davidson, coming from some
where out of town. He had served with
the Rough Riders in the Spanish-American
war, as had also Major Greenway. Green
way asked him what he was doing in Bis
bee and Davidson had hi3 reply ail ready:
"I'm going over there with you. major."
"But you can't go with me, Bill," said
Major Greenway and proceeded to argue
the matter at length.
"Well, I'm going, anyway," Davidson
countered, "and I'll stow myself away if
necessary. One soldier, wont turn another
one down." So Davidson, who had money
enough to pay his railroad fare east, did
stow himself away on a transport and
sometime afterwards made his appearance
in France. In some way he managed to
break into the service abroad and is doing
his best to play a man's part in the war. It
was an informal way of breaking into the
big conflict and luck was with him, else he
would have been arrested at the pert of
debarkation and shipped back home cn the
next boat. But one cannot but admire the
fine patriotism and zeal and the pluck of
the Rough Rider who was going anyhow,
and went.
It seems to be pretty generally agreed that
of all our war work and obligation and
necessities, if victory is to be won, that the
ship-building campaign is in the wcrst
shape. The blame can be placed wherever
one may prefer; upon the petty jealousies
and bickerings of the heads of this work;
upon governmental red tape; upon union .
labor or lack of labor; upon shortsighted
ness, lack of grasp, disorganization, or
what. But the fact remains that this most
important of all war work has been ill
fated and ill omened from the start. Even
Goethal3, the wizard of the Panama canal,
failed to bring about the desired results.
Many changes at the head of the work
have caused much confusion at the bottom
of the work. Hurley, the present head of
the shipbuilding program, 'seems to be the
man for the place. He has to contend with
the mistakes and delays of his .predeces
sors; with graft in high and low quarters;
with selfishness and greed upon the part of
those who furnish material and those who
assemble these materials into ships. The
ship situation, tak it all in all, is discourag
ing, disgusting and even appalling; but.
thank Heaven! it is not past mending. The
incompetents will be ousted, the greedy
ones disciplined, the grafters sent to jail,
and the ships will be built. But there is
nothing to gain in concealing the fact that
the work is behind and still in far from
satisfactory condition of progress.
According to the Washington Times the
Prussian gentlemen are enjoying a rabbit
drive in Russia the Bolsheviki being the
rabbits, of course. And at that, the Times
tells the entire, story of the present state of
affairs in Russia in that one sentence.
Voltaire: "Providence has given us
hope and sleep as a compensation for the
many carss of life "
j Sunday Morning Sermon
"And the Lord God formed man
of the dust of the ground, and
breathed into his nostrils the breath
. of. life; and man became a living
soul." Genesis 2-7.
Upon this brief paragraph alone rests
the entire fabric of our belief in the creation
of man, and all our hope3 and fears of the
fate of man after death. The books that
have been written upon the subject o5 the
creation would rill a library, and each
book 3 a ponderous "tome. But God,
through his scribe, Moses, author of the
book of Genesis, which is The Beginning,
disposes of this most momentous matter
in a sentence. He did it; that is all. And
t He told of it in a dozen or so -.vords, and
let it go at that. That is God's way. The
way of the immortal,, and therefore not so
plain and so clear and so simple as it might
be to us mere mortals.
With a mortal body made of the dust of
the earth and God's breath upon his Uds,
which is his soul, man was 3et upon his
way down the long track of the years. A
step or a league, and then cometh darkness
and the mystery behind the veil.
How strange it all is. Moses simply savs
that the Lord God formed mar. from the
dust and breathed into his nostrils the
breath of life which is his soul. We do not
comprehend. Of course we do not. God
would not be God if mere man could under
stand all His ways and all His Works. And
to those wise ones, to whose practical minds
and scientific learning this brief and simple
story of the creation comes as a fairy ta!e
for children only, it is only necessary to
say, "Give us something in its place !"
Where did we ccme from? Wh'ther are
we bound? "Life is the shadow of death,"
said Swinburne. "Life is nothing; life is
all," said the psalmist.
Between the darkness and the mystery
of creation and the darkness and mystery
of death is only a narrow beam of light
that we call this mortal life. We pass
through this lighted space like a storm
driven bird. Life is a fitful fever. Baby
cries and laughter; toddling feet; youth's
dreams and follies and love and noble ideals
and sad mistakes; manhood's strength; age
with its wisdo mand ailments, and then
Rest!
"Dust thou art, to dust returneth." But
wait I This was not spoken of the soul.
Out of the ancient mysteries of flame and
shifting sands and wild winds and humble
dust was man made. All frail, fleeting,
phantasmal. Weeping and laughter. Light
and shadow. Ah, but consider further.
Man was also made in the image of his
Maker, and God "breathed into his nostrils
the breath of life, and man became a living
soul."
Only a sentence, as terse and as tense
as though proclaimed through a trumpet in
one compellirg peal." That is all we have
from our Maker of our making. Made
from dust. He said, and 'then to be re
solved to dust again," as Bryant's genius
wove in the golden gleam andciivery sad
ness of Thanatopsis. But in that sentence
Moses had direct from on high it is declared
that God's breath became man's living soul.
The soul was not made from dust; it was
made from the breath of the Infinite, there
fore it is immortal. If it is not, then we had
better never have been born, for, as Ingalls
said, "Then he who fears to die should fear
to live, for life is a tragedy more sad and
inexplicable than death."
Made from the dust of earth and the
breath of heaven in the twinkling of an
eye, man struggles on, sometimes weak
and sometimes strong. His flesi often fails
him, for 'tis of the earth, but his spirit, that
he had direct from heaven, it is his own
fault if that fails him. "It shall mount on
the wings of eagles," if man, who is the
only captain of his own soul, has enough of
faith in his destiny and enough of courage
in the world's darkness and enough of un
selfish kindness in dealing with his fellows.
made from the same mortal dust and the
same divine breath of which he himself was
made when the world was young.
The Bolsheviki, whether they be mere
dreamers or scheming dupes of the kaiser,
whether theirs has been a path of im
potency or knavery, have exposed again to
the world through their downfall the brutal
hand of Germany.

that is the "short cut" to Dragoon.
This s oulJ have a real road gang
rut cn it and no doubt will before
icne. County Engineer Ryan has a
scene as striking and as strange as
any he tas ver witnessed.
Cn the canyon the crest of the
divide was shrouded ln a white cur
tain of snow, and down the canyon
inly a white mist of snow-flakes show
ed where the Sacramento Hill ousht
to be. Far below him the canyon
road lay as spotless and beautiful
a bridal veil. It was a magnificent
scene. And it was a strong scene.
Hucky O'Neil's point was as massive
and awe-Inspiring as a gladiator in
its white mantle, and it loomed cln?d
to the eye across the chasm. The
plain and homely spruce and moun
tain oak trees were so dolled up in
their new white ciothes that they pre
sented the illusion of Japanese peach
trees in full bloom. But. alas, like
all vanity of vanities, these garments
were fleeting as t. breath upon a
window pane.
After all. It is simply impossible to
describe that snowstorm view from
the McLellon house on the hill. The
depth and vastness of the scene weru
smc hered in white, but a break here
and there in the pressing hosts of
the snowflakes showed the -powerful
sweep of cliff and valley visible from
this point ot vantage.
Th? newspaper man went in to rest
and warm a minute before braving
the storm for the trip back to his of
fice den, and his host, with a pride
that was surely justified showed him
through the handsome and comfort
able cottage he bad built up among
the crags. Looking upward from the
roadway In the canyon the average
man might well pity thoe-s poor folks
in the bouses that look so frail and
small and incessible up there against
the great shoulder of the mountain.
Rut when one get up there and see
how ntcs these houses really are and
how far removed from the dust and
noise of the traffic below, one's pity
changes to envy. No nian worthy of
being called a man. could be little
and narrow and mean and live in a
prare like this. One look out of his
window at the depths below or the
distant mountains would make him
ashamed. Yes, he would be afratJ
to be mean.
And imasine Mr. McLellon sitting,
on a summer evening on his porch
up there in the cool and quiet of the
mountains looking at the stars in the
sky just above the peaks and thci
lights of Bisbee just below the peaks,
and trying to figure out which was

navy two months ago, and seems to be ecjoyim; it. as wil! be seen from
the pictures which his father, W. H. Swyers. received from him a
couple of days ago. Many of his friends will remember that he rode a

just seems to be natural talent with "Bill" to "bust" broncho?, as he
wasn't raised r.n a "ranch" or anything like that; he just Aaturally
"took to "em." "Si." as he was commonly known among 'tis "bosom

The prisoners and A'istriau so'dWj
alike lived fh barracks which wer
about 120 by 50 fet, but the officers
had. muoh better quarters. I.uckil
Mr. nrnsldsan secured a room with
the Austrian officers. Th only dif
ference between the barracks of the
prisoners and the Austrian soldiers
was that the latter' quarters wre
built more substantially and did not
have so many cracks in the wnlis
and holes through which the wind
and snow would drive in during the
winter months.
The Austrian officers did not treat
the soldiers much better than the
prlsorers although they were beUer
fed and had better clothing. The war
prisoners in the camps comprised oaly
those who refused to worS. those he; i
as suspicious and those phjsically un
able to work In the mine factories
and fields under armed guards. TLoso
who worked in the fie;ts regarded
their lot as lucky as they could r'esl
enough to eat when not properly fed.
although the farmers a wbo.e
treated the men fairly wsl! fnd m.iuy
of them became popular with women
in the country and announced their
intentien of returning thre to mairy
when the war end-?d.
It took two months fo' the con:
mandant to approve plans for 'Ue
school buildings demanded by Mr.
Donsldscn and It was not until Oc
tober before these were ertirely ctia
pletd. However, he started his clas
ses long before and secured the use
of a building for a gyninasivra. Wbi.-.i

weeds and while not rrrv palatable

attractive. Studies Russian Language.
While aboard ship Mr. Donaldson
had studied Russian and with the aid
of a Russian who spoke go-d German
soon picked up enough of the lan
guage to be able to converse with the
men under his charge.
Hs was forced to render a weekly
report to the commandant of the num

THEY deliver most tire mileage, dcjlar for dollar, because Firestone

They carry the car farther, gallon for gallon cf gasoline,, because of

MINING HISTORY MADE DURING
PAST WEEK
RICH STRIKES
Tom Reed Opens Rich Deposit, Which Promises to Rival
Ben Harrison Ore Body; United Eastern Cross-Cut En
ters Gold Vein; Gold Ore Reveals Finest Quartz Ever
Seen in District
(Special to the Review)
OATMAN, Ariz., March J. History
-was made hi the Oatman district dur
ing the past week upon a scale never
Kofro nnalu1 in th annuls f t1l(
camp. It is doubtful if any mining
V district ever witnessed three such vi
tal and significant developments as
were consummated in Oatman within
a space of three days during the past
week.
On Monday the Tom Reed crosscut
from the 623-foot level of the Aztec
workings reached the footwall of a
new parallel vein 500 feet south
which promises to rival the original
Ben Harrison ore body mat rias yield
ed over 46.000,000 in gold.
On Tuesday the . United Eastern
crosscut entered the vein on the 965
loot level, practically proving the
great ore body to extend 300 feet
downward and doubling the company's
ore reserves, making it one of the
world's greatest gold mines.
Fine Quartz Ore
On Wednesday the Gold Ore cross
cut on the 650-foot level penetrated
the ore. revealing a 15-foot vein of
some of the, finest quartz ever dis
closed in the district, and assuring
the addition of another producing mine
for the camp.
The accumulated effect of these
three strikes has been to create a
stir of iirrert -and activity such as
has not been experienced since the
- davs following the Vnlted Eastern anu
a Big Jim strikes cf over two years
VI ago. Mining men from all over the
west are arriving In Oatman daily and
alreadv several o'ber properties ate
starting or preparing to start develop
ment work.
The one outstanding effect of the
week's development that touches the
future of the district most vitally Is
thi aasnrance that the Gold Ore will
tt
reserve of at least 30.000 ions above
the present level. While it Is impos
sible to give reliable figure as the
value of the ore opened up by the
cros.wut. all mining men whj have
examined it pronounce it much hetter
in appearance and chancier than
anything disclosed on the uppet
levels.
Tom fleei Active
The strike on the Tom Reed is re-
pnrded by many good autnoirties as
practically proving the existence of a
new mine on that property. The vein
opened runs parallel to the Aztec,
"about 450 feet-South, and it is now
believed ttatat this is an extension of
the original Tom Reed vein. Some
geologifts expected to find the faulted
apex of the Aztec-Big Jim vein in that
portion of the ground, but the simi
larity of the walls and the .vein for
mation to the main Tom Reed vein
now leads to the theory that this is
a narf f the rreat lode system of
the district. Surface indications show
It to traverse the company's property
for a distance of more than a mile east
from where located on the Aztec
claim, passing tbej.ee Into Telluride
ground.
The vein shows a total width of 65
feet, but a large portion of this Is
broken and interspersed by andesite
bands or "horses." The vein has the
same dip as the old Tom Reed, and the
crosscut entered it from the hanging
wall. When the footwall was reached
on Monday a streak of high grade,
consisting of dark-colored sugary
quartz was found which returned a
value of over 1400 per ton when as-
sayed twice by Superintendent- W. B.
V. Phelps.
Repeated samplings confirmed this
valuation, and while It is Impossible
to determine the probable value of the
ait-cent ere body it is believed thnt
letween 12 and 15 feet will average
between J15 and $25 per ton. not in
cluding the high grade. Driftine is
now in, progress in both directions
and the results fully confirm the first
in:presslcn3 'gained in the crosscut.
Good Outlook
The I'nlted Fastern vein was en
rountered about 135 feet from the
shaft on the eighth or 965-foot level.
At the present time the crosscut Is
tftil in ore. the footwall not having
been reached. While no statement of
values was given out by the manage
men, it is evident that the showing
h. nroven highly gratifying in every
,r.ri fuiir ud to expectations. The
crosscut connects with the vein well
twpr-is the northwest portion of th
ore body, where It narrows down con-
siderably from Its maximum width
1 No adequate conception of the ore
body can be gained until it has been
fully cros.vut. explored by drifts for
some distance and thoroughly sam
pled. In line witb, the conservative

intendent J. A. Eurgess prefers to
wait until definite iata is at hand
before making public any detailea
U"neni.
Though third in order of occurence,
place in the interest of( the mining
world. The significant feature of the
development is that tie vein has im
proved in character, rnreased in
width and assumed a much more uni
form structure with depth. This de
velopment is held to prove President
A. C. Werden's theory that the Gold
Ore being much higher geologically
than the told Road vein, will not I
reach its minimum s:reng:n and val
ues until still greater depth is at
tained. Certain it is that the cross
cut on .the 650-foot level disclosed
more than 10 feet of solid quartz that
has all the typical characteristics of
the best grade of ore of the district.
A heavy flow of water will delay
t operations for a few days until the
pumping plant can be connected up.
A complete sampling of the vein will
then be made .and drifting started to
wards the east. The vein was inter
cepted at a point about 30 feet west
from the winze sunk from the 500
foot level.
Ore will be mined and transported
to the mill within a few days and" it
is confidently expected that production
will start on March 15, at the rate
of 50 ton, per day, which will be grad
ually increased to 100 or more. This
will mean a monthly production of
bullion amounting to $45,000 if the
ore holds up to the grade of that
shipped to the Gold Road mill two
years ago. So far Consulting Engineer
A. G. Keating has kept safely ahead
of the schedule laid out by him last
October.

UNCOVERS RICH ORE
(Special to the Review)
JEROME. March, 2. The-existence
of a quartz ledge, of unknown width
but at least 95 feet long and heavilv
mineralized with copper and iron sul
phides, has been absolutely" demon
strated on the 900-foot level at the
Pittsburg-Jerome mine.
Only one sample has been assayed
and it ran 10 per cent in copper. No
claim is made that the ledge averages
anything like 10 per cent, but there
is no doubt that the Pittsburg-Jerome
has a showing whlcn can easily lead
to a big high-grade ore bod v. As a;
prospect the prooerty looks rar better

Rumors of Important determinations,
at the Pittsburg-Jerome have been
current in Jerome for some days. Su-
perintedent C. C. Arata admitted that'
an encouraging snowing was oeing
disclosed, but It was only this week
the superintendent and H. M. Cronin,
he resident enefneer. to give out the
details.
About 350 feet from the 900-foot
station the south crosscut entered a
sheared zone of porphyry, schist and
other formations. A number of quartz
sfrineers had intruded the mixed
mass and most of them showed a lit-
tie copper.

February Production
of Copper Proof That
Price Must Be Raised
Records in Arizona for Past Month Illustrate Three Im
portant Facts. Production Declining From Normal. Time
to Call on Government for Correction of Price. Co
operation -Increasing
February production of copper in Arizona promises to Illustrate three
important points: First, that despite the best efforts of the producers, pro
duction Is declining from the normal; second, that while producers hnv
withheld from burdening the government with their troubles and tried to
straighten out their own affairs, a point has been reached where there re-
(mains nothing else possible except to
tions in metal price, transportation of supplies, competition in the labor
market and other deterrent factors; third, that the co-operation between,
mine operators and operatives, which has been steadily increasing since
last summer, must be still further increased and no hindrances permitted,
to come in.
Answer in Price Advance
A suffioiently higher price for copper to enable all the producers, large
and small, to put forth maximum "efforts, the- latter including higher pay
to operatives, provides part of the answer to all three, of the outstanding
features of the situation. Correction of the price of copper, and therewith,
of the wage feature. Is strictly in the hands of the war industries board of
the government The copper producers are powerless to themselves change
the price of the metal, except that they lower it, and that being so are like
wise powerless to change wages. The latter are higher than the govern
ment asked that they be put when metal price was fixed last year, but the
operator held at that time that a lower wa?e could not give the worker a
fair profit, just as they now hold that the worker Is entitled to a higher
wage in order that he may have a fair profit. But the price of copper as
now fjxeq" does not allow the operator the margin necessary to make an
Increase In4 wages. Some few might be able to do so, but if they did it
would be at the expense of the larger number who cannot and who would
have to close -down, further involving the present undesirable situation. A
number of the smaller operators, indeed, have already been obliged to follow
the closing down course in the state.
Sacrifice High Grade Ores
The decline in metal production in Arizona is due directly to the fact
that the mines are confined to extraction of their high grade ores, beini;
prevented by the comparatively low price of the metal from mining the
lower grades. Assistant factors In lowering production are prominent in
etc shortage for custom ores to some of the smelters, a factor whith will
probably account for as much as a million pounds of the February shortage
in production; in Ike delay in transportation of supplies, causing slowing
down of operattions in spite of their best efforts; in the loss ot men from the
technical and mechanical divisions, in the first Instance to artive ur-'iy and
navy duties,' and in the instance of mechanics to the shipyard and other
government contract work offering higher pay for the srrvi. es of ihii class
of workmen than the mines can possibly afford. The diversion of these
force from the mines and the attendant lowering of efficiency is on an
increasing plane. While normal technical and' mechanical staffs can be
got along without fairly well for a few months, the time soon monies when
occumulatioDs of necessary work in these departments becomes almost over
whelming, and every division is slowed down until the technical and
mechanical departments catch up, which is a much slower process than
that by which they fell behind.
Mechanics May Return
Some correction is coming about In the mechanical division, and will
probably grow as time passes, through return to the mines of mechanics
who have found that the higher pay fields to which they went were over
crowded and that they had been deceived as to conditions cf reported urgent
need of bej by tbelr Informants in Arizona. The pro-German sympathies
of many who have scattered such information in the state readily explains
their activities. In most of the mining districts the men have now been
advised to secure direct information from employers In field of higher ray
to which they are cited before leaving their mine Jobs.
, German Agents Busy
The activities of German sympathizers and paid aeents brings the third
phase of the situation faced by the copper producers squarely so the front
under the heading of the need of continually broadening co-operation be
tween employer and employee. Both have first at heart the wish to do their
utmost In aid of the government during the war period, and thus are on a
common footing. Efforts to make dissension between them are handicapped
by this reason in greater degree than In any previous period, but for pre
cisely that reason the paid distributors of German propaganda and their
dupe are working harder than ever. Far less direct efforts than attempted
a year ago are being made use of, but they may prove none the less effective
unless the employer and employee unite in exercisingh utmost vigilance.
It la no secret that the German propagandists are putting forth every possi
ble effort for discord and that they have made headway in this respect
through the circulation everywhere among the mines, mills and smelters,
of reporta of higher wages prevalent In other fields. Whether direct atten
tion is paid to this sort of talk or not. it admlttey breeds unrest and dis
content Combatting it at the present time is the admitted truth that
throughout the state mine operators and operatives are one in the belief
that there should be higher price for copper and higher wages for those
who get out the copper. If the war Industries board meets this view and
concedes It. a knockout will be delivered German propaganda in Arizona,
and the state's metal production at the same time be given a lift that the
government and its allies need.
Public argument la opposition to increase in metal price thus far has
been almost wholly based upon the figures of dividends paid by the copper

assistance of an accomplice in the
deed of "buttoning up." Now the
i fashion magazines are showing new
frocks buttoned up the back and it re
mains to be seen how they will be
greeted by women in this country.
The slip-on is really the most popu
lar form which has yet appeared as a
waist novelty. It is seen in new
goergette crepe creations and in
frocks of silk or cloth. Usually the
fastening is at one side, cleverly hid
den under a pleat or a tuck, and a
fancy collar edges the round neck
acrefs front and back and meets oti
each shoulder. That this novelty is
capable of many charming original
touches will be readily seen, and the
advance summer styles will doubtless
show many pretty adaptations of it.

Embroidery
Paris decrees that the chic costume
must be embroidered, beaded or braid
ed, and then proceeds to show many
beautiful and bizarre designs, usuallv
borrowed from the orient, for a pat
tern. The vest, which goes as a mat
ter cf course with the spring suit, is
smartlembroldered or braided. Pan

are not neglected. Wl-en all else fails

Why Prodium Place Rabbet

Heat, the great destroyer of rubber, is caused principally
by frictior
Prodium Process Rubber (the wonderful new compound
used exclusively on Republic tires) possesses anti-skid and
traction qualities which reduce friction to a minimum. -
In addition to this, Prodium Process Rubber will withstand
a higher temperature than any material ever used on a tire.
The result is that Republic Prodium Process tires are
almost proof against the damaging' results of over-heating.

"The thrift movement that is sweep
ing the country at .the present time,"
said a local Firestone dealer yester
day, "is having a fine influence on
the motor car and tire business, in
my opinion.
"While it is an admitted fact that
at first many car operators ana
prospective car buyers were a little
afraid that car expenditures were not
in harmony with Uie movement for
thrift and economy, they are now com
ing around to the point where they
realize that the car Is a necessity
and that they have, in many instances,
been operating their cars at a higher
expense than is necessary-
"For example, many people ' have
felt that tire buying was a matter of
luck, and, as they bought tires, it was
just exactly that. People did not use
their judgment. Most of them kept
trying a new brand every time they'
bought a tire. The result was that
they got very little satisfaction either
on the work done Ly the tire or the
service given by the people of whom
they purchased.
"The people -uo want the .most for
their money an no coming in and
investigating Firestone tires, which
more than ever are udng sold on the
solid basis of construction.. The move
ment towards thrift has resulted in
more converts tc Firestone cord and
Firestone labric tires than during any
similar period in my experience.
"H. S. Firestone, president of the
Firestone Tire and Rubber company,
has long believed ttiat every, one can
save money on tiree if he observes
more precautions in driving his car.
He feels that the careless driving,
which injures tires and leads to their
being punctured or blown jout early in
their history, can be stopped in
large measure If people belter under
stood tires.
"This propaganda by Air. Firestone
has resulted in nioviug pictures being
shown in thousands of cities in the
country in co-operation with the chiefs

It is seldom that any line of goods is bought up in'its entirety; there are bound to be som? left over;
the more lines there are the greater the amount of these remnants. As a consequence, our store, carry

So we have gathered together and are offering them for prices less than we could buy them
from the manufacturers.
The small number we have listed here will give you a good idea of what these odds and ends are
like and the saving they extend to you.

Men From, Seven Districts
Are Arriving. Arizona's1
Quota 490. Accommoda
tions Better
(Bv Revlrw Leased Wire)
CAMP rrxSTOX, Kas, March 2.
Again Camp Funston' is opening its
doors to incoming national army men.
this time to those of the last incre
ment of the first draft. Men from
seven middle states Arizona. Colo
rado. Kansas. Missouri, Nebraska.
New Mexico and South Dakota wi!!
make up tie new-comers.
When the movement of this incre
ment of troops is complete.!, the
seven states named above will have
their complete quotas, called on the
first draft, in camp. The movement
of men will continue until March 5.
Following are the quotas to be sent
from each state at this time: Arizona,
490; Colorado, 656; Kansas, approxi
mately, 700; Missouri. 1331; Ne
braska, 1130; New Mexico, 330; South
Dakota. 399; total. 5036.
Extensive preparations have been
made at Camp Funston for the new
men, who will find accommodations
vastly better than did those men who
rime to the cantonment with the fir?,
increments last fall. A special re
ceiving ramp has been prepared for
the new men. and here they will re
ceive clothing and equipment and be
Instructed in the rudiments of military
training. The men will be kept in
the 'detention camp for two week's.
This is a precaution which was not
taken with earlier movements or
troops and is expected to result In
better health conditions at the canton
ment. Men found to be carriers of
contagious disease will be sent to iso
lation camps.
The incoming recruit will find bim
relf beine "assembled." He will leave
the train at Artillery boulevard, on
the west line of Camp Funston proper.
From this point he will be conducted
to building No. 430. where the curtain
will be lifted on a new life and the
first act will be staged. After bathing
at building building No. 430, the re
cruit will check In his civilian cloth-j
ing, then proceed through a boarded j
gangway to building No. 427, where
he will undergo his physical examina-'
tion. If he is rejected he will be dis
patched to a nearby office, where a .
discharge will be filled out for him,1
after which he may take the train
home. The man passing the examina-'
tion successfully, however, goes to a
lower floor to the outfitting rooms,
where he receives his complete outfit.
t'lothed as a soldier ie then pro
ceeds to buildini No. 430. Arriving
there, his sen-ice record Is made out
at one table, at another his enlist
ment and .assignment cards are filled
out. while at a third he will be given
an or port unity to allot a portion of
his pay to home folks. The recruit
then proceeds to a floor above, where
his qualifications along certain 'line
are ascertaned and a card filled out
Miordinely. Downstairs he goes
again, this time to an express office.
where he may -take a parcel of his
civilian colthes and send them home.
After making the foregoing rounds
the recruit is ready for the detention
camp. Here, perhaps, will come the
first unpleasantness of his new TTfe,
for here it is that the vaccinations
and innoculations are administered.
Examination also is made for conta
gious disease, and if the man is found
to be a carrier he is sent to an isola-
tion camp. When the man is finally
assigned to an organization he is
ready for duty, and then it is that his
military training begms in earnest.
Only one thing .emains to be done
take advantage of the government war'
risk insurance. The national army,
man subscribes for this through his
company commander.
In conducting tests recently of this '
system of receiving new men it was
found that 400 men could be handled
a day. A soldier a minute, fully
equipped and with records filled out,
is the goal.
