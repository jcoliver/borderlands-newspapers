New York Faces Hunger in
Forty-Eight Hours, Report
Marine Workers Refuse to
Grant Short Armistice Un

to Consider Future Actions
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Jan. 9. Unless rail
roads can bring food into New York
by roundabout routes, the hunger
point may be reached within 4S hours
and (he lives of thousands imperiled
as the result of the Marine Workers'
strike which tied up virtually all traf
fic in the harbor today, according to
a statement tonight from the office
of A. H. Smith, regional railroad di
rector. The situation was described as
more""eritical than even the most pes
simistic can imagine," and could lie
saved only by "intense action by those
in command of the transportation
facilities." It was declared that '"the
very lives of thousands of people de
pend at this critical hour on the men
who are rearranging the schedules of
the railroads with terminals at this
port."
Asks for Armistice
Mr. Smith tonight asked for a "48
hour armistice" and stated if this was
granted, the strike could be settled
"cross the table." At a conference
with Mr. Smith, however, the men told
him the proposal could not be consid
ered until the general strike commit
tee held a meeting scheduled for 10
o'clock tomorrow morning.
It was stated at Mr. Smith's office
that to avert possible famine, live
stock, foodstuffs and milk were being
given preference over all other freight
coming into this city. The miik situa
tion was described as "even worse
than that of solid food" as there were
thousands of babies and invalids who
must be supplied.
Sympathy Strike Possible
The 45,000 members of the Interna
tional Longshoresmen's association at
this port are ready to strike in sym
pathy with the marine workers, ac
cording to a report made tonight at
a meeting of the strike committee by
Paul A. Vaccarelli, representing the
association. "We have pledged you
our support," he said.
President Delahunty of the marine
workers' affiliation, who declared that
offers to strike had been received
from workers in other ports, asserted
that the New York marine workers
had agreed they did not wish to im-

CONATION TAX
HiM NEXT YEAR
(Br Review 1-eaeed Wirei
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9. Corpora
tions will pay income taxes of 12 per
cent on their 1918 earning and 10 in
stead of 8 per cent thereafter, under
agreements reached" late today by
senate and house conferees on the war
revenue bill.
The conferees adopted the 12 per
tii.t rate for 1919 collection, as pro
posed in trie bill as It passed the sen
ate, the house managers agreeing to
elimination of the house provision
levying an additional 6 per cent on
undistributed dividends of corpora
tions. In revising the corporation in
come lax affecting earnings of 1919
and subsequent years, which the
sen.ue had fixed at 8 per cent, theJ
senate anj iiuuse managers retKiieu
a compromise, making the rate 10 in
stead of 8 per cent
It is estimated that under the new
rates the corporation tax will yield
about 1750,000,000 this year and
J600.u00(000 annually thereafter, as
against about $894,000,000 estimated
from the original bouse rates.
The conferees also adopted, sub
stantially, the senate provisions allow
ing deductions, in calculating corpo
rations' Income taxetj, of dividends
received from other corporations.
They also approved the senate provi
sions exempting so-called personal
service corporations from the corpo
ration tax rates, but added an amend
ment to deny such exceptions to these,
corporations where 50 per cent orj
more of income is derived from profits
or commissions on government con-:
tracts.
The senate plan of providing for
payment of income taxes In four in
stallments, instead of three, as pro
posed by the house bill, also was ap
proved, j
In revising the Individual Income
tax section, the conferees adopted the
house provision requiring individuals
j with net income of J 1000 or more to

income is $10,000 or more.

PROPERTY CLAIMS
(Bv Review Leased tVire) j
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9. Three well- j
defined proposals for legislation deal-)
ing with railroads are before con-
gross. ' I
Railroad executives today present-
ed to the senate interstate commerce ;
commission their plan, calling fori
private ownershipand operation under
regulation of a secretary of trail spor-
taiion a new cabinet officer with
statutory guarantee of adequate earn- j
ings, rates to be proposed by the reads j
and subject to review by the secre-1
tary of transportation and interstate!
commerce commission and with the ,
cabinet officer authorized to super-!
vise pooling of equipment, common j
use of terminals, re-routing of traffic. '
mergers, construction of new lines (
and issuance of securities. j
Commission Favors Plan. j
Previously the interstate commerce!
commission had suggested a policy j
of private ownership and operation
under government regulation. !
Director General McAdoo had aJ-l
vocated continuation of government
control for five years and as an :
alternative early relinquishment of
the roads from federal management. !
Shippers and representatives of i
state railroad commissions are the I
two principal groups which have not :
yet presented their views to the sen
ate committee. j
Among the objections expressed by
senators today to the railroads' plan, 1
outlined by T. De Witt Cuyler, chair-j
man of the Association of Railway1
Executives, was that if government
supervision were vested principally in
a secretary of transportation, politics
might play a large part in railway ;
policies and there might be no con-;
stant policy continuing through the ,
changes of administration. !
Another objection was that if the
railroads are guaranteed by law an ,
adequate return, they should net alsoi
have power to determine rates, even ;'
though these rates were subject toi
veto by the secretary of transporta
tion and modification by the inter
state, commerce commission. Senator
Underwood of Alabama suggested that
the government should have the au
thority to dictate details of the rate
structure. j
Explains Railroads' Plan.
The railroads' attitude, as explained
by Mr. Cuyler, who is a director of,
the Pennsylvania railroad, is that the ,
regulatory powers given the secretary
of transportation and the interstate
commerce commission would be suffi
cient to protect the public against un
just rates or inadequate service and .
that railroad men. by long experience, i
are best qualified to propose rates
originally. Several senators expressed i
belief that this issue would be among j
the foremost in drafting of legisla-j
tion. i
Mr. Cuyler argued that the ad-
vantage of having one man as the
principal governmental supervising
agency is that he would act more
quickly than a commission in approv-l
ing or disapproving rates proposed by I
railroads, and would expedite general 1
matters of railway administration. j
Members of the interstate commerce ,
commission will testify further toraor-i
row. Later the committee plans to ;
hear Alfred P. Thom. general counsel ',

EFFICIENCY was not meant for man alone. But. as man's business and profes

REESE DISAGREES
ON QUARANTINE M
DANCING IN CITY
The action ot the city council in
placing a ban upon dancing in the in
corporated city of Bisbee, was one of
the chief topics of conversation yes
terday, the stand beius taken by a
majority of people on the street that
the order was not justified under the
conditions.
Cochise county has not placed a spe
cial quarantine against dancing, nor
will it do so unless there is marked
increase In the number ot cases of in
fluenza, according to Dr. Harry A.
Reese, superintendent county health.
"I know nothing about any quaran
tine other than that in the city itself,"
he said. "I have nothing to do with
anything except the outlying districts,
my jurisdiction not extending to the
incorporated cities.
"I see nothing in the present situa
tion to warrant quarantining the out
lying portions of the 'Warren district.
Were I to quarantine Lowell and War
ren against dancing, I would have to
make the same ruling for all parts of
the county. I can see no reason for
doing this and think It would work a
hardship upon the people and ba un
just. "As far as my personal view goes.
I can see no more reason why dances
should be quarantined than for the
quarantining of moving picture shows,
the pool halls and other places of pub
lic assemblage. The man who has in
fluenza doesn't feel like dancing;
that's the pastime of the healthy man
or woman. Influenza strikes tie pa
tient and prostrates them in a hurry.
They do not feel like doing anything 1
except lolling around, if they are not j
in bed. They would be far more liable '
in my views, to go to a picture show !
or info ai pool hall than to a dance. !
I venture to say that if you mentioned I
dancing td anyone in the throes of in-
fluenza and offer him $10 to attend a
dance, you would find him refusing ;
your money."
BROPHY BRINGS HELMET
OF HUN OFFICER HERE
A souvenir of die Ameyin occupa
tion of Metz hishly prrzY-d by its pos
sessor, M. J. Cunningham, vice-president
of the Hank of Douglas, is the
helmet of a German officer of in
fantry. It was brought to this coun
try by W. If. nrophy of this city, who
served as a major in the Red Cross
in France. Mr. Cunninpham went to
Osborn to meet Major Ilrophy when
he passed through on his way to Los
Angeles recently and there was pre
sented with the trophy which now is
iu his office at the bank.
The helmet is made of light armor
steel, on top of which is a spike of
polished copper through the base of
which are pierced four ventilation
holes. Around the edge of the helmet,
familiarized to the American public
by means of photographic reproduc
tions of Hun officers, runs a narrow
band of polished copper. Across the
front of it spreads the German eagle,
in copper, and on a scroll under his
claws is the inscription, "Mit Gott fur
Kocnix und Vaterland" (with God for
kind and fatherland). The chin strap
is on leather, plated outside with
scales of copper. The contrast be
tween the bright copper and the dull
gray of the polished steel is beauti
ful. Major Brophy also brought the
cloth covering of field gray, worn by
the officers of the German army when
in the front lines, or where there was
danger of their gaudy headgear at
tracting attention. It is waterproofed
to protect the steel from moisture.
"Major Brophy told me he had seen
a number of American prisoners who
had just returned from Germany and
that they all were in good physical
condition," said Mr. Cunningham. "He
ascribed this largely to the packages
sent them from time to time by the
lied Cross organization."
lajor Brophy probably will return
to I'i.sbee within a month, Mr. Cun
ningham said.

RESIDENCE FIRE
Static electricity, developed by
friction in a garment being cleaned in
gasoline by Miss Sarah Randolph,
daughter of Dr. and Mrs. W. M. Ran
dolph, yesterday afternoon about 2:30
o'clock, set fire to the volatile liquid,
which in turn communicated with the
walls of the room in which she was
working. Before the fire department
could extinguish the fire damage esti
mated to have been in the neighbor
hood of $4000 had been done to the
house and contents. Insurance was
carried. Miss Randolph escaped with
out injury, although the narrowness of
her escape wa3 testified to by the
fact that her hair was singed by the
flames from the blazing pans.
The residence on Quality hill, which
is owned by the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion and normally occupied by Dr.
Robert Ferguson, contained a consider
able quantity of handsome furniture,
books and other valuables, many of
which were damaged badly by fire,
smoke and water. In addition to dam
age done by these elements to the
huse and Dr. Ferguson's possessions,
clothing and other valuables of Mr.
Kanuoipn ana nis iamuy were lost or ,
damaged so greatly that they were
ruined. There was no insurance on
this' portion of the loss.
Miss Randolph had three small pans
of gasoline in the rear of the resi
dence and had cleaned a number of
garments when the fire broke out.
She had been careful to find a placa
distant from any light or fire. This
was the second time within a year
that she had a narrow escape from
fire. In Tombstone last year she and
her sister escappd in their night
clothes from their burning home, just
in time to save their lives.
The smoke and flames from the fire
yesterday afternoon attracted a large
crowd which wafhed the firemen at
work. Much commendation was heard

These newspaper quotations represent
live cattle prices in Chicago on December
30th, 1918. .
" The list chows price ranges on nine
general classified groups with a spread of
$13.85 per cwt. the lowest at $6.50, and
the highest at $20.35.
Why this variation in price?
Because the meat from different animals
varies greatly in quality and weight
Although the quotations shown are in
nine divisions, Swift &. Company grades
cat tie into 34 general classesand each class
into a variety of weights and qualities.
As a result of these differences in cattle
prices, (due to differences in weights and
meat qualities), there is a range of 15 cents
in Swift & Company's selling prices of beef
carcasses.
These facts explain :
1 Why retail prices vary in different stores.
2 Why it would be difficult to regulate
prices of cattle or beel
3 Why it requires experts to judge cattle
and to sell meat, so as to yield the pro
fit of only a fraction of a cent a pound
a profit too small to affect prices.

delegation is a bond issue to 'cover
state road improvements. The state
good roads convention in Phoenix,
January 27, is expected to make
recommendations to the legislature
with the suggestion that a bill cover
ing the various points decided upon
shall be adopted.

How a Father Has Learned to
Save Shoe Bills.
"My son is very hard on shoes, so
keeping him properly shod has been
quite an expense to me," writes Mr. J.
Allison Allen, of Amity, Arkansas.
"But since I started to buy Neolin
soled shoes for him I have found that
it costs only about a third as much to
keep him in shoes."
This is because NcOlin Soles are so
toufjh and durable that they wear a
very long time. Shoe bills are kept
down because you don't need so many
pairs.
You can cct N'.'Olin-soled shoes at
almost any pond shoe store. They
come in all rtylc-s ::nd for all members
of the family. Ncolin Soles are also
available everywhere for re-soling.
They are produced by a scientific pro
cess to be what soles oulit to be: com
fortable, waterproof and loiiK-weariri:.
They are mri Jc by The Gwxivrrr The

The Quarantine
A quarantine is "any forced storage
of travel, communication, or inter
course, on account of contageous or
infectious disease."
There is always a wide variance of
opinion, as to the advisability and ad
vantages of the quarantine. Honesty
in every instance prompts the varied
opinion, although business aud help
fulness of proper quararine regula
tions where conditions demand their
enforcement.
The Warren district today is faced
with a peculiar quarantine condition,
growing out of the prevalence of in
fluenza, and resulting in the stopping
of dances in Bisbee.
Briefly, the facts are as follows: the
city health officer believes in closing
dances as a precautionary measure
against the epidemic; he explained
his stand to the city council, and as
a result, the city marshal has ordered
dances in Bisbee discontinued indefi
nitely. On the other hand, the county
health authorities take the stand that
the dance does not contribute great
ly an element of danger, that those
enjoying the dance are happy and In
a frame of mind and exercise which
is deterrent to influenza. Conse
quently, dances in other parts of the
district continue.
Two examples of how this works
out came up last night and the night
preceding. On the first occasion a
dance had been advertised for Bis
bee. When the dancers arrived at
the hall they told the band had been
renewed. They boarded a street car
aud attended a dance in Lowell the
same night Last night a large dance
was held in Warren.
Surely some remedy for this , situ
ation is possible. Either the dance is
all right, or all wrong, and should be
permitted in the entire district or
forbidden. To the casuai observer and
the medical novice it seems that the
health officers could get together on
this minor question and come to some
common decision which will remedy
the present condition.
A Soldier's Return
Colonel John C. Greenway. who ar
rived in New York last week from a
field hospital in France, will be re
turning to Arizona shortly, he assured
friends in telegrams from the east.
Colonel Greenway, more than any
other individual, set the pace in Ari
zona for preparedness for war. More
than any ofher individual lie looked
forward to the certainty of America
ultimately entering the great conflict
and in every avenue within his reach
compelled the crowding ahead of ev
ery single step that had bearing and
that he could lay hands upon. When
the time came, when war was de
clared, he set the pace in Arizona
for the action he felt to be incum
bent upon all good Americans the
grasping of as full a part in aid of
the allies as each individual could
carry.
From the platform, Colonel Green
way told the public that such of it as
could shoulder a gun to best advant
age should do so, and that such of it
as could remain at home and accomp
lish more is getting out munitions
and supplies, should do so. His part
ing word to hundreds of miners who
gathered to say good luck to "Jack"
upon his going to the front, was: "Get
out the copper, boys; we are going
to need it over there."
For his part, Colonel Greenway bad
for two years been rushing his work
ahead so that lie could go when the
time came. He was ready, with New
Cornelia Copper entered upon produc
tion that epeedily advanced a million
pounds above its set mark, in so
small part because "Jack" was over
there and needed the copper, and with
a sulphuric plant added to tho out-1
putting equipment of Calumet & Ari-!
zona, a long visioned piece of enter-1
prise contemplating needs of the' his pvhb on a world war without los
chemic al division ot the country. ; ing hight of his constituency.
These and many other things Colonel j
Greenway drove home and accomp- j
lislicd in advance or tJio moment Mien
lie could go, some of them iu the
(ace of questioning as to their need,
that would have discouraged and bait
ed a less far-seeing and purposeful
and determined heart.
Colonel Greenway, by example, ac
complished more than any other indi
vidual in bringing aDout the splendid
record Arizona set in enlistments and
responses to the draft, in subscrip
tions to Liberty loans, Red Cross and
war savings stamps. He is back in
the country, with thousands of hearts
beating gladly with the news, many
of them having held but little hope
of the return of so commanding and
urgent a figure in peace, and he has
coming to him when he sets food upon
Arizona soil all of the ovation that
will rise to greet him.
Welcome, Colonel Greenway, to the
reins of enterprise which await you
and which you will be in baste to
pick up, wno me ort ot uguung
done and the tasks of reconstruction,
in which you can accomplish equally
much or more, lying before you.

An Industry Threatened
The "bootlegging" industry in Ari
zona threatens to follow the legalized
liquor traffic into the limbo of for
gotten things. The "bootleggers" are
quarreling among themselves and
threatening each other to what is tech
nically known as the "double-cross."
Just as dissentions in the ranks ol
saloon men helped the good people to
drive the saloon . from the state,
"double-crossing" among the bootleg
gers is helping the sheriffs and other
peace officers to get the upper hand
of lawless traffickers in fire-water
From Phoenix comes the story of the
business man who financed the suc
cessful running of a cargo of thirty
three cases of whisky from "wet"
California into the "dr.-" precincts ol
Maricopa county. The job was com
pleted without untoward Incident am'
the liquor rarely stored in a oellar in
Phoenix. Profit to the amount of sev
eral hundreds ot dollars was to bo
divided among those ho had suc
cessfully defied the laws, but the di
vision was never made. The meuter
of tbt "bootleggers' union" who nego
tiated the transfer of Uie count raband,
like the saloon keeper of other days,
was not content to abide by the rules
of the game: Ke wanted to hog it
all and he came mighty near doing
it. After storing the stuff at the
place designated, this worthy succes
sor of the dive keeper of old used his
employer's automobile to cart the 30
cases of the stuff to his own estrb
Hshment, where he retailed it to his
personal enrichment. Not content
with this outrage, he tapped the busi
ness man's till of 200 and taking the
automobile, he fled in the direction
of the sun-flecked Pacific. From Cali
fornia the greedy one wrote a letter
narrating his exploits aud incidentally
telling where the car might be found.
The bilked business man was advised
that if he wished to prosecute, there
would be evidence introduced that
would interest him as well as the au
thorities. There was no prosecution.
Adding insult to injury the self-exiled
"bootlegger" dictated another
note to the sheriff of Maricopa telling
him where the remainder of the
whisky might be found. The sheriff's
men found the three cases, welcome
because physicians' drafts, for the in
fluenza treatment, had materially im
paired tho usual jail stock. When the
"bootleggers' union" learned the
whisky had been taken there were
loud murmurings and later open
charges that the sheriff had seques
tered thirty cases for his own use.
But the letter from California cleared
the officer and bis deputies, though it
brought bitterness into the ranks of
the "bootleggers" and threatens to
wreck and ruin the industry, for now
no one knows who to trust. Business
men with coin to risk in lawless ven
ture are no longer willing to finance
the daring and hardy souls who once
performed the actual work of intro
ducing the spirits, and Phoenix is
threatened w ith a "dry" spell that will
be real instead of constructive.
It Las been said one cannot handle
pitch without becoming smirched. It
likewise seems one cannot handle
whisky without becoming possessed
with an overwhelming desire to vio
late the rules, whether the rule be
the law of the land or merely the
loose code which is said to bind
criminals and make honor among
thieves. El Paso Times.

i LEGISLA TORS

Candidates Seek Support in Senate and House
JOHNS PROBABLEPRESIDENT
(Review Phoenix Bureau)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 9. Never be
fore in the history of Arizona politico
has there been so little surface inter
est apparent in the organization of the
two houses of the state legislature.
With but four days more in which to
perfect the final arrangements, the
clans are just now beginning to gather
for the purpose of selecting the men
who will guide the progress of the two
branches of the legislative assembly.
The uncertainty which prevails
among the faithful is more pro
nounced in the house than in the sen
ate. In tue upper body there are three
outstanding candidates wno are con
ceded to nave tne Held practically to
themseives, namely, A. A. Julius of
Yavapai, V. H. Ciaridge of uranam,
and Muiford Windsor of Yuma. ,
Johns Leads In Race '
Of the three, Johns appears to have
the better chance. His ability as a
presidiug officer was markedly demon
strated during his tenure of office as
speaker ot the house during the ses
sions of the third state legislature.
He is now in the city conducting the
campaign calculated to insure his se
lection as presiding officer.
His nearest rival, Ciaridge, i3 also
on the ground studying the situation.
vvniie he has ventured no expression,
it is assumed that he would nut ue
averse to his re-election as president,
and his supporters are booming him
loyally lor the office. His candidacy
is jeopardized to a certain extent by
the fact that both J. H. Lines and
A. C. Peterson of Graham county, are
nominees tor the speakership oi the
house.
Politicians predict that either Lines
or Peterson will swing the,ir support
to Johns in the senate in return for
the votes ot the Yavapai delegation
in the house. The Ciaridge element
scoffs at this possibility and asserts
that this procedure may be reversed '
to the detriment of the Prescott sen-!
ator.
Winsor Handicapped
Winsor is handicapped by the sua-.
picion with which he is regarded by 1
both the conservative and radical ele
ments. By the conservatives he is
recognized as the leader of the Hunt
faction. On the Other hand it is said
the southern man will receive but lit
tle support from the Hunt wing due
to his activities in behalf of Osborn j
in the recent campaign.
These considerations are appraised
at their face value by the Yuma sen
ator. Wiring for reservations to a Io- .
cal hotel he stipulated that the rooms ,
must have fire places as he was ex- ,
pecting several frosts. Mr. Winsor has

In the inteiest of public Health all
theaters, moving picture houses and
dance balls have been closed and will
remain so until the health authorities
are convinced the influenza has been
eliminated. Lodge meetings, together
with all other public and private path-
erings, are also prohibited during this
nprinH A i tendance at funerals in
limited strictly to the immediate rela-
tives of the deceased. The slightest
infraction of any portion of the new
law is punishable by a fine of $:100.
Arrangements have been made for
the complete isolation of the victims
of the disease. No one is permitted
to visit them under any pretext with
the exception of the attendant nurse
or pbyMcian, or to even enter a house
in which a case is being treated. A
corp of special deputies is' patrolling
the city to insure the observance of
this order.
Recurrence of Disease.
The procedure was made necessary
in the opiuion of the commissioners
by the recurrence of the influenza
epidemic which first broke out in the
city last October. After the disease
had practically died out in th" com
munity, a second wave struck the city,
first making its appearance about a
week ago. In tile course of the past
few days more than :'oo new cases
have developed and the total is grow
ing hourly, accompanied by a high
mortality rate.
All schools, both city and county,
are closed, with tho exception of the
Phoenix Union High school. The ad-
visabilily of terminating the semester
was left to the discretion of the vari-;
ous boards of education witliin tne
city, but was made mandatory iu the
county. The trustees of the high
school arc inclined to beliee (hat the

Two Dark Horses
Two other possible aspirants are
causing some political uneasiness,
either Hugh Campbell of Coconino or
Cuaries W. Hernuon of Mohave could
maKe a strong race for the coveted
honor, and it is said that their names
are to oe mentioned at the caucus
scheduled lo take place Sunday.
There are more serious complica
tions in the house. In addition to Lines
and Petersou there are about seven
other candidates for the speakers

women, Mrs. Pauline M. O'Neill, Mari
copa? Airs. Minnie Heywara, Cochise,
and Mrs. Hosa Mct.ay, Uila, better
kiiortii us the "Wild Kose ot Cochise."
itirs. O'Neill, in spite of political dif
ferences, will prooabiy receive the
support of the Maricopa delegation,
'the action of the republican delega
tion will, it is believed, alienate tne
sympatny of the democratic represen
tatives, however. Mrs. Ileyward's
chances can not be estimated with the
meagre iutormation that is forthcom
ing on the subject while the reduction
oi the power ot the extremists will se
riousty attect the prospects of Mrs.
.McKay.
Several Other Candidates
Others mentioned prominently for
the speakership are W irt E. Bowman,
Santa Cruz; Charles T. Francis, Co
chise; T. P. Howard, Gila, and Harry
jennings. Cochise.
Bowman has a number of supporters
who are industriously advocating the
candidacy ot tne iormer mayor o No
gales. The following T. P. Howard
has secured is devoting itself just as
assiduously to the furtherance of the
Gila representative's claim upon the
chair. The arrival of the Cochise
delegation, however, is expected to ma
terially change the complexion of the'
present situation and it is ireely pre
dicted that they will supply the well
known monkey wrench that will be
cast into the wheels of the machinery.
Senators and representatives are
arriving on every train and are being
promptly absorbed in one or another
of the factions. They are encounter

of accommodations, particularly those

PHOENIX. Ariz., -an. 9 With no
material changes made in minimum
valuation for the ensuing year, the
conference of assessors which has
been in session here for t'le past
three days, closed this afternoon.
The Stale Assessors' association is to
meet later for the purpose of electing
officers for 1319. and to outline the
legislative changes to be recommend
ed to the legislature.
The final sessions were devoted in
the main to hearing arguments in
favor of lower valuations advancei
by representatives of the Arizona
Wool Growers' association Arizona
Cattle Growers' association and the j
Merchants & Manufacturers' associa
tion. In justification of their atti-j
turiei all stated that they were facing
a declining market whose resultant
loss to them would be proportionately
greater if they were not accorded
lower valuations. Although there was
no eNprcjsion of opinion in the con
vention it is said that this matter will
b3 the subject of a measuVe which
will be preseuted to the legislature.
In turn, the tax rate on land. Im
proved and unimproved, mining prop

discussed. After canvaFsing the sit

allow the minimum valuations fixed

The f'rst matter that will come up
for consideration will be a proposal in

tributing automobile license plates.
An fffort is being made to have tiiese
bandied by the various county asses
sors instead of by the secretary of
state, as at present. The motive for
this innovation is primarily the fact
that it would facilitate thj collection
of the personal property tax. As it
is done at present, a great many car
owners obtain their licenses from tho
secretary of state and escape the
assessor particularly where the ma

NEW YORK, Jan. 9 Specialties
whose intrinsic values for the most
part are yet to be determined, were
the conspicuous features of today's
stock market, standard shares lapsing
In lethargy or yielding to pressure.
The session as a whole offered
cumulative evidence of the dominance
of pools and of cliques on the one
hand and the indifference of public
interest and outside support on the
other.
The only striking incident in rails
was a further advance of 9 points for
Texas Pacific Land & Trust company
to 200, a gain of 170 points thus far
this year. Texas Land is an ofisnoot
of the Texas & Pacific railway, whose
shares have been strongest and most
active of the low" priced rails.
Former leaders among industrials
and equipments were almost eclipsed
by the erratic movements of oils, to
baccos, sugars, leathers and other
shares of no definite description.
Sales, 5S5.000 shares.
Liberty bonds were steady, but
other domestic issues and interna
tionals eased from fractions to 16
points.. Total sales, par value, ag
gregated $9,875,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 9. Sensational
breaks in the value of corn resulted
today from statements that the food
administration had recommended to
the war trade board the cancelling
of bans which forbade imports of
corn from Argentina. Notwithstand
ing that the statements were denied
at Washington, heavy selling took
place and the market closed excited
at the lowest point of the day with
net losses of 3V4 to 7 January
fl.44 to $1.44 and May $1.35 to
11.35V
Although a general rush to throw
holdings of corn overboard began
right at the opening of business, it
was iot until the last hour that the
weakness bordered on demoralization.
The reason for the acute consequent
depression in prices was the possi
bility that large amounts of Argentine
corn would be imported in view of
its great relative cheapness.
Oats and provisions tumbled with
corn.

At the end of the first day of the
marine workers' strike, whiih virtu

bor, the New York Boat Owners' as
sociation announced tonight that the
men had signed an agreement for ihe
appointment of a conciliation board to
arbitrate all differences. This an
nouncement brought prompt denial
from the strike committee, which
termed it "un owners' welfare propo

In this connection. William A. Muh

serting that all settlement proposi
tions submitted to representatives of
the men will be considered by the
general strike committee at a meeiing
called for 10 o'clock tomorrow morn
ing. For that reason, he said, the
strike could not possibly be called
off until that hour.
The announcement that the sink

president of the Boat Owneis' associa
tion. Asserting that "we have no quarrel
with our men" but that "this strike
has been precipitated by just six labor
leaders and it is high time to check
bolshevism," Glatzmayer described as
"a new declaration of independence"
the agreement which he said author
ized organization of the board.
Powers of Board x
"The board will be governed by 20
men, ten to be selected by the employ
ers and ten by the employes,'' con
tinued Mr. Glatzmayer. "It has full
power to fix wages and working con
ditions and to enforce its orders by
meetings to be held monthly or often
er, which will be open to everybody.
It will offer a forum where anyone
with a grievance can be heard and in
this way we shall know and under
stand each other better. We believe
it will be a big step in the direction
of industrial peace.
"Membership is open to every ma
rina worker and to every boat owner
or operator, and before we get through
they will all be on the rolls. The
dues for the employes are 1 a year.
"Each employer will pay annual
dues equal to $1 for each employe on
his pay roll.
"Through this. board we plan, among
other things, to foster sick benefit and
old age pensions; provide medals or
other testimonials for acts of hero
ism; restore captains of our boats to
their ancient positions of authority
and -dignity; and generally to make
this port of New York a model for
eery other port iu the country."
Other Agencies Assist
Meanwhile, many other agencies are
at work to restore to normal condi
tions in New York harbor, which' are
almost utiprecedented today. Union
leaders declared that 16.000 men were
idle. Scarcely a ferry boat, tug, or
lighter moved after 6 o'clock this
morning. There were no tugs to dock
ocean liners and no boats to cany
freizht.
Itepioiuil Director A. 11. Smith is
sued a statement in which h" indicat
ed that the railroad administration
was seeking to effect a separate set
tli'ment with crews in its employ who
had gone on strike. Later Thomas L.
Iteiahunty. president of the Marine
Woikers' aiiiiiation, announced that
he learned "from reliable sources"
that Mr. Smith and George H. Sines,
chairmiai of the railroad board ol
wages and conditions, "are preparing
a proposition to submit to the Marine
Workers 'affiliation."
The Hudson tubes hae never been
called upon to handle such crouds as
those which appeared today between
4:M p. m. and o::!'J p. in., wheu Jersey
commuters sought iht; only means of
egress from Manhattan. Bridges lead
ing to Brooklyn were equally congest
ed. On the Brooklyn bridae. trolley
service was discontinued to make
room for thousands of trucks. To ac
commodate passengers, a shutf! serv
ice was introduced on the elevated
lines running over the budge.
Several vessels, returning from
France with explosives, are tonight
anchored in Gravesend bay. To pre
vent too great an accumulation of ex
plosives near the city. Collector of the
Port Nelson notified Godfrey L. Car
den, captain of the port. that, if more
tugs are needed to tow lighters used
in unloading the vessels, they must be
commandeered at once and manned
with coast guardsmen.

formed a solid line along each side
of the dock in the midst of moun
tains of supplies from the U. 8 .
Nothing pay like persistency as
was proven by Ni--ht Sergeant Hill
Kuff of the city police force, when,
alter more than a week of effort he
"located uuJ, .etuieil Cio return of two
fine female fox hounds. The dops,
which last wore seen almost two
weeks ago us I hey chased a coyote or
some other small aniiiK'.l over the
hills near Warren, turned up lat Wed

Itulf now claims tuat his dogs had
chased the same animal persistently
for mow than a w-'k, taking occa
sional rests and then starling out
npin. That is the only way he could
cxp.ain their not having come home
us he had trained them to do.
In order to obtain the return of the
Jogs Mr. Kuff inserted an advertise
ment in Te Ueview and has ridden
and walked ni::ny miles in his hours
oft duty. It ha3 not et been learned
whether tho doc.s read the advertise
ment and determined to come back,
but it is presumed that Mr. Kinney
was informed of their ownership
throuth that source.
.Mr. Ruff and his dogs hunt through
the hills around Bisbee quite fre
quently, there being many foxes in
this vicinity. It is not a matter of
infrequent occurrence for the dogs
to be gone for from one to three days
on a chase before returning home.

CEDAR RAl'IDS. Ia., Jan. 9
Frank Vliock. a fanner near Oxford
Junction, his wife and three children,
all sick with inlluena, were burned
to death in a fire whivh started from
an unknown cause and destroyed their
farm home this afternoon. Neighbors
attracud by the flames arrived too
late to save their lives.
Chauffers of the service cars op
erating in this district must comply
with the state law and display their
license badges in a conspicuous place,
or be punished for their neglect, ac
cording to Deputy Sheriff J. K. Joy.
It is his Ir.tent'on to enforce the state
law in this regard.
"The men driving for hire cars have
to obtain a state chauffeur's license
before they can operate," he said. "In
addition, it is the rule of the city of
liisbee that all men operating in pub
lic service in and out of the city, must
obtain a city license. Before this is
issusd they must show their state
license and stand examination as to
experience and other qualifications.
"As they have the license badges
t!:ere is no reason except negligence
for their not displaying them promi
nently for every one to see. Not to
do so is a misdemeanor punishable
by a maximum fine of $100 and earn
ing a jail sentence, at the option of
the trial court."
At least 2500 men have been dis
charged during the last week by the
Cananea Consolidated Copper com
pany, the Democrata Mining company
and other properties operating in the
vicinity of Cananea. according to ar
rivals here yesterday from the Mex
ican mining camp.
The cut in forces is ascribed to the ,
uncertainty of the present situation (
in tne copper maiKet anu me almost
certain further decrease in the price
of copper.
As far as possible men with families
dependent upon them are being retain
ed by the companies, it it understood.

announce-.! that all card playing for
money, chips, markers, or anything
of monetary value, must cease. It is
his intention to enforce the law

According to Mr. Joy's interpreta
tion, card playing in clubs for "money,
chips or chalk." as he expressed it.,
is not to be tolerated and he will ar

Similar fitps were taken several
days ago by the peace officers at

Mr. Joy's personal Interpretation of

the new enactment upon which he re
quested enlightenment of Mr. French.
