to Clothe and Otherwise Provide for Four Million Men by

WASHINGTON, July 2 American troops sent overseas
numbered 1,019,155 on July 1.
This was made known tonight by President Wilson, who
gave to the public a letter from Secretary Baker disclosing a
record of achievement which the president said "must cause
universal satisfaction" and which "will give additional zest
to our national celebration of the Fourth of July."
The first units non-combatant left American shores on
May 8, 1917. General Pershing followed twelve days later
and at the end of the month 1718 men had started for the
battle fields of France. June saw this number increase by
12,261 and thereafter khaki clad "crusaders" from the. west
ern republic flowed overseas. in a steady stream until upwards
pf 300,000 had departed when the great German thrust began
last March.
President Wilson's determination to
meet Germany's supreme effort with
the utmost of America's available man
power to assist the desperately resist
ing French and British armies is sharp
ly reflected in the movement of troops
during the last t'mee months. The
March sailings of 83.811 were in
reased in April to 117,212. May saw
another 244. 245 men embark and last
month 276,372 were sent away, making
a total for the three months of 637,529.

CBy Itoview lyiwd Wire)
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
FRANCE, July 2, (By the Associated
Tress). An American ir squadron
composed of nine machines had a
thrilling half hour fight this morning
north of Chateau Thierry with a Ger
man flight squadron of the same num
ber. At least three of the German
planes were driven down plunging to
the earth and up to 6 o'clock tonight
two of the Americans had not re
turned. The American airmen, according as
a patrolling party came upon the en
emy shortly after 7 o'clock In the
morning, and immediately attacked.
With the advantage of the offensive
the Americans succeeded in getting
above their adversaries and after fur
ious exchanges at an altitude of more
than two miles, drove the Germans
down a mile.
Two of the American aviators saw
one of the Nieuports, driven by an
American pilot, got Into a dive and
disappear, but three American pilots
have reported that they observed
tracers go through the fusillage of
three enemv machines within a few
minutes of each other, the planes
crashing earthward.
The fighting was fast and all kinds
of maneuvers were brought into play.
Finally the Germans made off hur
riedly. When the Americans returned to
their field they found two of the patrol
missing and they have not been heard
from so far.
One machine had been struck Ihir-

that the supplies and equipment in

(By Review Leased Wire)
SYRACUSE, N. Y., July 2. At least
sixteen persons were killed and 200
injured nd the huge .plant, of .the
Semet-Sloway company, at Split Rock,
near here, virtually wrecked by two
explosions of trinitrotuluol at 9:30
o'clock tonight. - ' -' '
Terrific concussions from -the explo
sions rocked large business buildings
in the center of this city, smashed
plate glass windows and caused a
panic in the residential districts. The
explosions followed a fire that haj
raced beyond control and spread to
the "TNT" vats.
Two let go, burying workers under
an avalanche of debris and scattering
the flames to adjoining buildings.
At a late hour tonight the flames
were burning fiercely and there was
constant danger of more explosions.
Volunteers firemen were powerless,
Aid was sent from Syracuse but at
midnight the water system broke
down.
Five hundred workers were in the
plant when the fire broke out. Its or
igin has not been ascertained. The
workers fought the flames and when
they ran to safety were caught in the
first explosion.
Men were hurled in all directions.
Two, caught between burning build
ings, were blown through a wall. Still
alive when picked up, there was not
a shred of clothing on their bodies.
The second explosion followed the
first after fifteen minutes. The explo
sions crumpled buildings in the vicin
ity. Homes of workmen across the
road from the plant collapsed. Burnin;
timbers were blown to the roofs of
buildings across the railroad tracks,
which divide the plant.
Families fled across fields in con
fusion. A woman, hysterical, carried
a tiny kitten clutched to her breast.
James Russo and Arthur C. Good
fellow were analyzing samples in the
plant when the cry of "fire" called
them to building No. 1. Goodfellow
tells this story:
"Russo grabbed a hose and I tried
to help. Smoke was thick and we
could not see. Little explosions kept
letting go inside the building. There
was not enough water to be of any
use.
"We knew that a big explosion was
coming, and we ran. Just as we reach
ed the foot of a hill the blast let
go. It knocked us both flat on our
faces."
A telephone message from Split
Rock brought the first word of the ac
cident to the city. It reached police
headquarters in the form of a request
for all the ambulances. The shock or ,
the explosion, a minute earlier, had i
tied up all the telephone lines, caus
ing a delay before the ambulances
were on the way. I
Both fire and explosions, according j
to workmen who escaped, were con-,
fined to the east side of the plant
which is made up of about fifteen ;
buildings.
There are three of the TNT plants,
in the first of which the flames orig-1
inated. Next to them are six plants
in which nitric acid is handled. Bn
yond them, only a hundred yards '
away, are four plants in which picric !
acid is bandied. All of these were on :
the south side of the railroad tracks, j
At midnight the flames had eaten i
ipto the picric acid plants and were j
making slow headway toward the,

WASHINGTON, July 2. Ship
production in the United States in
June amounted to 2S0.400 dead
weight tons, making the total 1918
production to date 1.0S4.670 tons.
The June production, which is at
the rate of 3.364.800 tons a year, is
the greatest output of occan-goins
tonnage ever completed in ore
month by any nation. It coaioa
within 15.000 tons of the world's
record for ship, building macic by
the British shipyards in ."lav. but
which included all cl:i.;ses of ves
sels. Of the month's output, sleel
ships totalled 2t2.900 tons and
wooden ships 17,500 tons. The
number of vessels was not an
nounced, as it was discovered that
several had been put into service
so quickly after delivery that in
spectors had not made reports of
Ihem to the shipping board's sta
tistical department. Tonnage fig
ures were available from the di
vision of operations.
An amazing growth In ou'put
was disclosed by detailed figures
for the four weeks of June. In
the first week six ships of 24.430
deadweight tons were delivered,
the second week ten more of 64.
732 tons were added and in the
third week the average for the
month was made one a day by
the completion of five ships to
talling 61.260 tons. It was in the
last week of the month, liowever.
that the ship builders really hit
.their stride and gave evidence of
the tremendous output which may
be expected from now on. Deliver
ies in the last week totalled 129.
97S tons, which is at the rate of
nearly 7.000.01)0 tons a year.
The same growtp also has been
shown from month to month. The

"Please be governed accordingly, as
there is a heavy penalty attached if
the rules of the fuel administration
are violated.

In this connection, it was recalled
that not a single American transport
carrying troops to Europe, had been
sunk by Germany's sea wolves, the
only two destroyed having been at
tacked when returning home without
the protection of American destroyers
and other naval craft. Two British
vessels carrying American soldiers

Telegraph, Radio and Cable
Concerns Introduced
fBv Review Leased 'Wire)
WASHINGTON. July 2 Plans for
exacting legislation before the sum
mer recess authorizing President Wil
son to take over the telephone, tele
graph, cable and radio went forward
in congress today while three mem
bers of the cabinet emphasized thpir
approval before the interstate and
foreign commerce committee.
Leaders in both houses expressed
the opinion that the legislation could
be passed without delay, though some
opposition was to be expected.
The house committee after hearing
Secretaries Baker and Daniels and
Postmaster General Burleson arranged
to meet tomorrow to prepare a report
on the resolution of Representative As
well of Louisiana, which has been en
dorsed by President Wilson. The only
fight expected is over the question ct
a time limit. A limit was suggested
in the committee today and was op
posed by all three of the witnesses.
Secretary Daniels and Postmaster
General Burleson advocated per
manent government ownership. Mr.
Baker was not prepared to go that Fir,
but he joined his colleagues in urging
government control during the war as
a military necessity.
The heads of the two war making
branches declared their attitude- was
not influenced by the strike of West
ern Union operators called for July 8
and was based entirely upon military
needs.
Mr Burleson, long an advocate of
government operation of communica
tions, said the threatened strike v.as
one reason for action at this time.
What promised to be a hitch in the
program for expfdiling the legislation
developed in the house during the day
but later was cleared up. Hepresenta
tive Gordon of Ohio, moved that the
Aswcll resolution lie takc;i from the
commerce commission and referred to
to the military committee since it was
proposed as a military necessity. The
motion was carried without opposition
but upon Rearing a statement by
Cnairman Sims of the commerce com;
mittee, the house reversed itself.
The military committee considered
a resolution by Representative Lupu
of New York, similar to that of Rep
resentative Aswell but providing spe
cifically for the operation of the com
munication system as f-tr as possible
under the plan applied to the railroads.

problem of the proper use of substi

ered by the judges among the Hun
dreds submitted and the time reqjired
to thoroughly test them is responsible
for a delay in the making of the award.
Are Juc'ged and Graded
The recipes were first judged and
graded by a committee composed of
Mrs. Jessamine C. Williams, Miss
Edith Coffman and Mrs. Mary Pritner
Lcckwood, the latter being the Arizona
home economics director of the food
administration. AH are members of
the faculty of the University of Ari
zona at Tucscn. This committee elim
inated all recipes not strictly comply
ing with the rules of the contest. Most
cf these required the use of too large
quantities of wheat flour.
Then came the baking test. Follow
ing the directions given in the remain
ing recipes, dough was prepared and
loaves baked by Miss Hazel Zimmer
man, home demonstration agent of the
agricultural extension service of the
University of Arizona These tests
were carried out in the home econ
omics labcratcries of the university.
The baked products were then
judged and graded by a committee
composed of Mrs. H. A. Hubbard, Tuc
son; E. P. Taylor, director of the
agricultural extension service and Mr3.

The six highest scores were as given '
above.
Most of the recipes which were tried
cut made gcod palatable bread. There
were a few laughable exceptions, how-

the judges, "and two mere presented

THE MORNING NEWSPAPER
All night the sky was draped in dark
ness thick; .
From rumbling clouds imprisoned light
nings swept;
Into the printer's stick,
With energetic click,
The ranks of type into battalions crept.
Which formed brigades while dreaming
labor slept;
And ere dawn's crimson pennons were
unfurled,
The night formed columns charged the
waking world.
Ironquill (Eugene Ware).
Editor Jaynes is nearly alway3 right on
all public questions that have to do with the
best interest of his state and community,
but he either slipped a cog or turned the
form sheet upside down when he printed
an article in his paper, the Tucson Citizen,
the other day, under a Bisbee date line
which was full of slighting remarks and
sarcastic little thrusts about the guberna
torial candidacy of the Hon. Fred Sutter of
this city. Too bad that Editor Jaynes should
get off on the wrong foot in this manner.
Of course the Citizen is a republican news
paper and Sutter seeks office as a demo
crat, but in these times and under the con
ditions that prevail in this state there are
no party lines any more. At heart Jaynes
and his Citizen stand for the same high
ideals of state government and industrial
progress and prosperity for which Sutter
stands. That Jaynes should support his
friend Tom Campbell is perfectly natural
and right. But that he should use his paper
as a vehicle for conveying unfair and un
founded remarks about the Cochise candi
date for governor is hardly in keeping with
his record in the past for fairness. Demo
cratic dailies throughout the state have been
more than fair and kind to Campbell in his
campaigns and will continue to be so.
Campbell, Jaynes, Sutter and all citizens
who have the best interest of their state at
heart are fighting Huntism and wobblyism.
May the best and most deserving man win
for the governorship, is the Review's sin
cere desire. Certainly Sutter is guberna
torial size, and as such should have the
respect and fair treatment, at least, cf all
citizens who are devoted to their state and
take a pride in her achievements.
That the American government should
be surprised at the news that Holland is
sending 50,000 tons of potatoes to Ger
many is passing strange. Ever since the
war started Holland hats been buying every
thing she could in America and sending it
to Germany. Food, copper, cotton, rubber,
steel; everything that might be of most
value to the blockaded Hun. And then poor
starving Holland appealed only a few
weeks ago to America for food. And our
government sent grain by the shipload.
Sure. All the Hollanders needed to do was
to ask. And now these sordid and fear
stricken Netherlanders have violated their
agreement with both London and Washing
ton and sent 50,000 instead of the agreed
5,000 tons of potatoes to Germany. When,'
oh, when, will America stop feeding Ger
many via Holland, Switzerland and the
Scandinavian countries, neutral in name
only? The German bugaboo has them
frightened silly and their hypocritical whine
to America for food and raw products
needed for war is only the outburst follow
ing the German prod.
Germany announces her ninth war loan,
and it will be subscribed. Why not? The
more paper afloat in the empire the easier
to exchange one bit of this paper for an
other. Germany's taxes are not enough to
even pay the 2 per cent interest on her
war loans; the other 3 per cent interest
promised, and the principal, just pyramid
the original debt. But then Germany ex
pects to pay her war loans by indemnities
exacted from the nations she conquers in
this war. Fine security this. In the three
great essentials of winning a long hard
war, finance, industrial resources and man
power, Germany is fast going from bad to
worse. Outwardly all three of these ap-'
pear to be in splendid shape, but this is all
a sham. She is drawing from these three
banks like a spendthrift, and, like a spend
thrift, she is making no deposits to cover
her drafts. 1 It is the old, old way of the
autocrat. "After me the deluge," said
Louis xvi of France. A writer on inter
national affairs thus sums up the present
situation of Germany: "How is it possible
to doubt that German finance is a sham,
like its democracy? The reality of, our de
mocracy is shown by the fact that our rich
are growing poorer so far as our taxes can
manage it, and our poor are growing richer
by high wages. In the birthplace of social
ism, in the depth of war distress, the Ger
man rich are growing richer and th poor
are growing poorer. It can only be a aues
tion how long the poor will stand it, or how
soon the inflated riches of the war wealthy
will collapse."
The situation of public service securities
is at last receiving serious attention, says
Henry Clews of New York. Some form of
relief must be found for ga3. electric and
street railway concerns, which are not al
lowed to meet increased cost of operation
by higher charges for service. Three alter
natives are open as a solution, viz.: higher
rates, government support, or bankruptcy.
The first is the easiest and sanest solution ;
the second is a doubtful expedient that
would -robablv result in increased taxa
tion; while the last is really unthinkable and
not what the public either expects or de
sires. The federal government has shown
an indisposition' to give financial aid to
street railway comoanies, which is not sur
prising; since such action opens the door
to demands which it could not well pretend
to meet. Public service corporations should
obtain their financial aid as far as possible
v from customary banking circles ; and, if this
is impracticable, the local municipal bodies
responsible for driving these concerns to
the edge of bankruptcy, should be obliged
to furnish the necessarv relief. Not a few
public utilities are selling at exceedingly
low prices compared with past records, a
condition which is of course explained bv
the practically exhausted margins after
dividends.
If our Fourth of July celebration this year
consisted of nothing more than a gathering
of the people together in each community
to hear the simple statement read that upon
this day one hundred ships were launched
and 1,000,000 American soldiers were in
France, it would be the grandest celebration
of the national birthday ever held since
John Hancock scrawled his name in such
large characters upon that immortal paper
in Philadelphia. No boom of cannon or
firecracker or flash of rocket or swing of
parade or bustle of picnic or gilded display
could equal the thrill of the heart and the
glow of the soul over this brief announce
ment of our giant achievement in the world
field of freedom.
"Have we entered Paris yet ?" That was
the leading question in Berlin a week or so
ago and it shows more plainly than any
thing else could do the extent and fraud of
the propaganda of the German government
among its own people. German prisoners
taken in Belle'au Wood boasted to their
American captors that the Germans had
shelled New York City and actually landed
troops on American soil and taken rich
cities and booty. And German troops and
civilians have been swallowing these tales
and promises for four years and still call for
more with open mouths and eager gullets.
What is believed to have been the first
I. W. W. attempt at wheat destruction in
Kansas occurred the other day when a
straw stack in the center of a large field of
standing wheat, owned by Melvin Griggs,
near Falun, broke into flames. The stand
ing wheat is ripe, ready to cut. A general
alarm brought many neighbors. The wheat
was cut around the stack and the fire
extinguished. The damage was light but
the farmers are incensed and have given
notice all strangers will be watched closely
If Germany's claim of having taken
191,000 allied soldiers' prisoners on the
western front since the offensive began last
March is true, then regiments and even en
tire divisions must have thrown down their
arms with but little resistance, showing a
low morale. But this column does not be
lieve for a minute that the German figures
are true. At the least calculation they have
been doubled.
SENATOR SMITH
SAYS I, W. W. IS A
MENAGE TO LABOR
United States Senator Mark A.
Smith lias written the following letter
of congratulation to -Mrs. Pauline
O'Neill, the Maricopa county represen
tative w ho introduced the anti I. W.
W. resolution during the early days of
the late Fpecial session of the Arizona
legislature:
Mrs. O'Neill.
.My Dear Friend:
I am proud of you ami ot your reso
lution touching the I. W. W. which
passed with such unanimity through
the branch of our state legislature,
which is honored by your presence
and which so signally honored itself
in the vote recorded on your patriotic
resolution. So far as I have been able
to acquaint myself with the purposes
and practices" and propaganda of the
I. W. W. it is a menace to all orgauujd
and unorganized honest labor, an open
assault against law and order, and
treasonable in the great battle we are
waging for the perpetual establish
ment at home of justice and peace and
the preservation of religion, hutiniiity
and civilization in the world for all
time to come. In this veritable battle
of Armcgeddon those not for us are
against us. Those who would Russian
ize our country now, by efforts to cre
ate heme dissention, or weaken our
aid to a simple American soldier fac
ing the inhuman Hun ought to be
treated as traitors.
I hand you my hearty congratula
tions. Who can now deny woman's
right to suffrage? '
Sincerely your friend.
MARK A. SMITH.
YOUNG MOTHER
PASSES AWAY
Mrs. Charles Randolph, aged 19
years, passed away last night at 11:30
o'clock at the home of her parents,
Mr. and Mrs. Harry M. Jacobs, on
Mason hill, trom complications follow;
ing child birth. The baby daughter,
who survives, is doing excellently and
probably will live. Funeral arrange
ments have not been completed, pend
ing the arrival of Robert Bartlett of
Chicago, an uncle of the deceased, who
left for Bisbee last night.
Mrs. Randolph, who had spent prac
tically all her life here and in Daug
las ,was an only child. She was a
beautitul woman with a character as
lovely as her face and form, and was
generally beloved.
Besides her parents, her husband,
no.v a member of the national army at
Camp Cody, X. M-, but formerly a
shilt boss at the Junction mine, sur
vives her. He arrived here yesterday,
a furlough having been given him on
account cf the extraordinary nature of
the demand for his presence at home.
Coming with the anticipation of re
joicing with his wife over the arrival
of their child, he was grief stricken
to discover her condition. All yester
day it was apparent that only a mir
acle could save Mrs. Randolph and her
family and friends were prepared to
some extent for the shock of her
death.
The body was prepared for burial oy
the Palace Undertaking company.

Editor Itisbee Daily Review,
Dear Sir:
Hy the accident which caused the
death o." a boy in Don Luis last even
ing, I am reminded to write a letter
to the public, which I'd like you to
publish.
1'arents are mostly to blame fo
children playing on streets. I've had
children dare me to run over them,
saying: "My papa will have you put
in jail if you hurt me." This is evi
dence that parents teach children such
things. One month ago, I was forced
to turn off the paved road in John
son addition and smash my own ma
chine and that of another man just
to avoid striking a boy playing ball
nt noon in n. id-street, right by where
the old Lewis house burned. I .vas
returning to Bisbee and could not turn
olf to the right because of the embank
m'-nt, so I turned to the lelt. trying to
cress car track, b:it couldn't do so in
time. The two repair bills cnit me
nearly $10ii. The boy ran into th
street about ten leet ahead o." me. to
catch a ball. giing me no time to
stop or to blow horn.
II children are to ke' p plaving in
the streets, parents should at lat
teach them to get out or fie way of
approaching chiclcs. Auto fcid wagon
I drivers shou'd have some considera
tion.
Once in Upper Lowell I ran over a
boy, just as the Don Luis boy was
run over, la t night, but fortunately
we were in deep dust and did not
hurt tiie boy.
Let us at least tcah our childre-!

Major Lyon today. He then related to
the Associated Press his experiences
w ith the Germans.
"The Get mans," he said, "seemed
obessed with the Idea that American
aviators were aboard, and it took us
some time to convince them otherwise
Almost the lirst words they used
when approaching our life boat were:
' -Where is the flying officer?"
"This was when the German com
mander ordered us to come along side
naickly and we explained that the
slight delay in the darkness was dua
to an endeavor to rescue a man in the
water. Then it was that the German
commander threatened us again ask
ing -where are those Americans?" and

I was taken to the conning tower and
kept sunning about three minutes
wniie 1 was interrogated by the Ger
man commander regarding my being

''.Major Lyon was propped up in bed.
Apparently his foot pained niiu ana
tlie Interview seemeu to annoy him
slightly. A wounded British ot'fice.
just from the front was much amused
at Lyons' calmness in telling of the
disaster and his eagernesj to get the
interview over with.
"Major Lyon related how the Ger
maiis pursued them soon after tne lue
boat put away from the "submarine
and called for the ship's second of
ficer, who was takeu to the conning
tower and questioned at length regard
ing the explosion as the vessel sank.
The Germans apparently had before
hand information as the commander
of the submarine asked Major Lyon
about eight flying otilcers. Fight
medical officers had intended to make
the trip but one did not sail at the
last minute because of illness.
"Finally the second oificr returned
to the lite boat and the submarine be
gan running down the wreckage aui
any floating object.
"The submarine," continued Major
Lyon, "a little later made for us,
missing our stern by two feet. I be
lieve tne Germans tried to ram us,
but why they did not shell us or run
us down we could not understand.
After our experience we all agreed
their first intentions were to sum us
without trace, but wny they spared us
is inexplicable unless it was because
most ot the survivors iu our boat are
men ot the sea. and they tell there is
is a sort of tree masonry among them.
"As the submarine disappeared we
heard ten or twelve shots, one over
our heads. I shall never lorgti tne
cries cf the helpless men in the water
clinging to the wreckage that night.
If the Germans had not delayed us
we would have been able to assist
many.
"1 was in the smoking room when
we were torpedoed. 1 lirst weut to
the state rooms of several nurses, but
all were empty. I saw one nurse as
cending the companion way but never
got another glance of the women, al
though one Bunivor said he saw a
boat with twelve ot them capsize.
"Despite the darkness there was no
panic and no cries for help until an
individual reached the water. My boat
was tne last one to leave.
"The Llandovery Castle began sev
tling rapidly, first listing, and then
straightening herself as the bow began
pointing skyward. We were witiiin
forty teet as she settled, going down
so gradually that we did not notice
any suction. My last glimpse of the
ship showed the bow sticking straight
up out of the water like a giant wound
ed shark and going to her death with
out a struggle. This was before our
experience aboard the submarine. -
"The Germans sent us afloat luto
the darkness without a word of fare
well, suggestion or direction. But we
were all thankful to get away. 1 could
not help wonder what had become of
the ethers. After ahe submarine dis
appeared all was still. There wero
no more cries for help heard.
"Then a loag night. After thirty
six hours we were rescued by a British
destroy t. and here 1 am with every
comfort and attention. But i can not
help but feel that if the Germans had
not interfered .we could possibly have
saved many of thoi-e poor souls in the
water clinging to wreckage and crying
fur help that never came."
Major Lyon formerly lived In Van

"Gets-It" Makes Corns Coma Off The
"Banana-Peel" Way
Why hare to flop on the floor,
squeeze yourself tip like the letter "Z"
and with bulging eyes draw your face
up into a wrinkly knot while you gouge
and pull at the "quick" ot a tender
corn? That's the old. savage way.
"Gets-It" is the modern, painless, sim
ple way. Lean over and put two drops
of "Gets-It" on the corn, put your
stocking and shoe right on again, and
forget the corn. Pain is eased.
"Gets-It" has revolutionized the
treatment of corns. It never irritates
the true flesh. You'll stop limping on
the side of your shoe, and do away
with greasy salves, bundling bandages,
thick plasters, and painful methods.
Use "Gets-It." It's common sense.
"Gets-It" is sold by all druggists

The Americans penetrated the on

from Chateau Thierry. This was car

Americans, who also occupied two

counter attack say they marched for
three hours as fast as they could when
word reached the commander of an
enemy battalion in the rear of Vaux,
which town is on the right of the
American attack. Observers reported
this morning the Germans were appar
ently hurrying to bring up reinforce
ments behind their line.
All the nrisoners questioned today
'expressed their relief at being cap

The attack by the Americans on the
Vaux positions was so terrific that
they swept right through the enemy
lines and had their object Deen
At least three German planes were de
stroyed, while two American machines
have failed to return from the encoun
ter. June 7 the French reported that
they had recaptured hill 204. a height
dominating the city of Chateau Thier
ry. It appears, however, that the Ger
mans have been holding at least part
of the height, or that they have by
an attack which has not been reported,
succeeded in occupying the hill once
more. The allied attack on the north
side will tend to make the enemy's
position on the hill less secure and
may force the Germans to re-locate
their lines from the Marne northward
to Torcy, where the Americans have
been successful in several fights an l
have won important ground.
British forces northwest of Albert
! have been forced to fight hard to bold
positions they took from the Germans
Sunday night. A determined attack
by the enemy at that point threatened
to wrest the captured ground from the
British, but heavy counter attacks
flung the foe out of all but one of the
trenches he had occupied.
The French front wes of the Oise
and east of Rheims has been the scene
of considerable local fighting in which
prisoners were taken by the allied
forces. The French have reoccupied
the village of St. Pierre Aigle, south
west of Soissons which they lost three
weeks ago.
The German official statement of
operations along the front says that
allied attacks at various points were
repulsed. It specifically mentions the
cf their shirts not on the le't si'le
while others pulled Cieir trophies
from their pockets, explaining that
they considered them the best souve
nirs because they are easily mailed
home while machine guns, rifles and
trench mcrtars are likely to become
elephants on one's hands. The men
sd'd some of the crosses had been
given vol'.mtaily by the Hermans when
t.liey were asked fcr them, but t.iat
other's were cnt off prisoners' shirt3.
One small doughboy who looked less
than' twenty stepped up to a German
officer, taken prisoner and drew his
bayonet to cut eff the cross. The of
ficer thought the American intended
to kill him and fled.
The American chased him with the
hare bayonet in hi3 hand. The olfi er
finally wa3 headed eff by other Amer
icans. The small soldier patted the
German on the shoulder with one
hand and removed the desired trophy
with the otlier, much to the aston
ishment of the officer. The American
gave the German a dear and a match
and the bargain was closed.

A. Wentworth, former county record
er cf Cochise county, and one of its
pioneer residents, was in the city yes
terday shaking hands with his many
old-time friends. He was one of the
first agents of the railroad company at
Fairbank and used to have charge of
the billing out of freight and express
fcr the freight teams and stages on
there way from that place to Bisbee
when the trip was made over the
divide.

Fourth of July. Douglas International.
His fellow employes of the same com
pany here want to know about the
chickens.
NO PLANS SUBMITTED.
There were no plans submitted to
the board of supervisors at their meet
ing on Monday for the new jail and of
fice building to be erected in this city
on the property adjoining the city hall.
As a consequence the board will read
vertise for bids to be opened on the
15th, when the board will again be in
session. The plans call for the expen
diture of 110,000 and a premium Is of
fered to the architect who's plans are
accepted.

On the same page of this Issue of
The Review will be Tmnd an an
nouncement by A. C. Karger, clerk of
the board of bupervisors, calling their
attention to the necessary prompt fil
ing of nomination papers and petition.
The new law makes it necessary for
them to be filed on or before July 15th,
so that the names can be placed on
the official ballots that are to be
mailed to the soldiers. If you are a
candidate get busy with your petitions.
If you are to become one get busy.
The time is short.
FILLS LOCAL WANT.
A long-felt local want has been filled
by the opening by William Truax of an
annex to the English Kitchen grill on
Main street. The room is that form
erly occupied by the Merchants Lunch
room. It has been fitted up with tables
at which family parties can be ac
commodated, while several tmi-priv-ate
booths invite those who wish to
have more privacy at their meals than
is afforded by a public dining room.
The interior has been nicely finished,
adding attractively to the surround
ings. Mr. Truax proposes to give
Reserved Seats 20c
fir.t class service and the hi?h qual
ity of food which l:ne madn his res
taurant famous throughout the south
west. KICK ON RAISES.
The hoard of supervisors, which
was in session Monday in regular
monthly . meeting, met for a short
while as a board of equalization ami
received several protests to the raises
on a number of assessments made at
their June meeting from the 1st to the
10th. Among those who protested to
the raises made on their assessments
were Mrs. Xeel of the Xeel estat?,
Ceo. Storms, Wm. Cowan and Frank
Meson. The board took the matter
under advisement after receiving pro
tests and it render a decision at a
later date.
RED CROSS SHOP.
As everyene realizes by this time
what a great help tiii Red Cross shop
!s to the local Red Cross, it will ouly
be necessary to mention the fact tliat
the stock is decreasing day by day.
Without reinforcements it . will
soon be depleted. Business is inclined
o be verv good, but without the neces
sary articles, it can not be. Children's
clothing must be had, clean if possible,
and there has been a great drain upon
the shoe department, which now needs
replenishing. Leave things at the
Red Cross Shop, across 'rom the
V. M. C. A.
INSPECTION TRIP.
G. N. Mosher," who is the represen
tative cf the La France Fire Engine
company, with 'headquarters In San
Francisco, was In the city yesterday
conferring with Chief Norton. They
made an inspection of the two engines
now owned by the city. Both machines
have been overhauled by the firemen
during the past two weeks and are now
in first class shape. This is the first
overhauling they have had since they
were purchased and some of the first
oil that was placed in tbem was still
in the machines. This has all been re
moved and new oil and grease put In.
SON-IN-LAW WINS.
By a new ruling just made public
from Provost, Marshal General
Crowder at Washington, the parents
of the wife of a registrant are not
permitted to put the son-in-law into
the army by stating that they will
care for the wife, the registrant hav
ing received deferred classification
on account oj the dependency of the
wife. It is the opinion of draft officials
that this ruling was made to apply
in cases where there is bad feeling
between the husband and his wife's
parents, so that the latter cannot
"get even" with the registrant by
hustling him into the army.
REPUBLICANS SCARCE.
With the political situation relative
to candidates for county offices gain
ing impetus with, each succeeding day,
candidates for democratic nominations j
are beginning to wonder who their
opponents will be on the republican
ticket. Although many democratic
campaigns have already been well ad
vanced, one single republican has ap
peared on the horizon and publicly
announced himself a candidate. Va
rious names have been mentioned. in
connection with the respective offices,
but there is seemingly a desire to
await the eleventh hour before "com
ing out." In many circles it is whis
pered that there is a dearth of mater
ial among the republicans, or rather a
dearth of candidates who are willing
to sacrifice their personal business to
make the race. War conditions are
believed to be largely responsible for
this apparent lack of interest
EXAMINING REGISTRANTS.
The Ttishee examining board was in
session yesterday at the Y. M. C. A.
and examined some nrteen young mea,
from other places, who had been noti
fied to reDort to the Cochise county
board for examination. Their cards
will be filled out and sent to their
respective boards. There was but one
Cochise county man examined. James
Giacoma of Tombstone, who wishes to
enter the service but was rejected be-
fnra nn neennnt Of a slight tthvsical
disability. He is anxious to get to
France or in the service as ne Bpeass
a number of foreign languages. It is
expected that the examination of the
young men who registered last Ji'ie
will now be examined about the first
of August.

Mrs. Wheeler In Tombstone
Receives Cablegram Stating
That He Was Ordered Back
on June 30th
According to advices received in
Tombstone by Mrs. Harry C. Wheeler,
former sherii; Wheeler is now on his
way back to the United States. She
received a cablegram from his, merelv
stating that he had been ordered back
to the I'nited States on June 30th.
The cablegram did not state any rea
son and the supposition is that when
.ie received his orders and sent her
the cablegram he bad not been advised
cf the reason.
It is possible-that he has been or
dered back here and will be attached
to some post in thel'nited States to
act as instructor or that he had asked
to be sent back here on account of
the wound that he had received and
wishing to be peresnt when the indict
ments have been called in Tucson as
he wishes to be present as he cabled
recently to tho'.Revlew, that he alone
was responsible for the deportation. .
Further information in regard to the
order wil! be watched for with inter
est a3 he has hundreds of friends in
the county who are interested in his
future movements.
RECORDER KREBS ASKS
RELATIVES FOR
ADDRESSES
New Law Makes It Impossible
for Ballots to be Mailed
Unless Addresses Are Furn
ished by Relatives
Relatives of soldierslor sailors In na
tional service are asked by County
Recorder Jvrebs to supply him with the
present addresses of their kinsmen in
service,! in order that he may mail to
them a ballot on which they may vote
in the primary, September 10 and .'n
the subsequnt general election for
state and county officers.
These relatives are the recorder's
sole dependence in getting these ad
dresses and they are asked to upply
them at once, today or tomorrow, a
he mubt supply them, to the board of
supervisors iifty days before the date
cf the primary election.
The supervisors and the recorder are
trying to carry out the aw passed by
the recently adjourned I legislature,
which enacted a law permitting sol
diers and sailors, whether in the Unit
ed States or over seas, to vote at
the primary and general election.
Under the general election law, can
didates re required toiflle their nom
inating petitions not more than sixty
davs and not less than twenty days
before the date of election.! The sol
diers suffrage law requires that boardj
of supervisors In each county shall
mail to soldier voters, fortydays be
fore the date of the election, primary
or general, a ballot on which to vote
for state, and county o.'flcers.
Attorneys anticipate that there may
arise , considerable difficulty because
of the conflict or th? two laws ana
they suggest the possibility of a candl-.
date who has qualified in all respects
losing election by virtue of 'the coldier
vote if his nomination petition is filed
after the ballots are forwarded to the
soldiers. It is a situation pregnant
with possibilities of contests, they'say.
So it behooves the candidates tcf
urryi and file their petitions if they
wish to share in the soldier vote, and
it behooves the relatives of soldiers
to promptly send their addresses to
the county recorder If they wish tlielr
kinsmen In the service to share In the
unus' l privileges of double" service,
as a citizen and voter and asta soldier.
