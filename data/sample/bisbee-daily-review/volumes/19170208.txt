(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7. Presi
dent Wilson's severance of diplo
matic relations with Germany
was formally approved today by
the Senate. By a vote of 78 to 5
the Senate adopted a resolution
submitted by Chairman Stone of
the foreign relations committee
endorsing the withdrawal of
American Ambassador Gerard
from Berlin and giving to German
Ambassador Bernstorff his poss
ports. ONLY FIVE DISSENTERS.
Senators who voted against the
resolution were:
Democrats: Kirbey, of Arkansas,
and Vardaman, of Mississippi.
Republicans: Gronna, of North
Dakota; Works, of California, and
Lafolette, of Wisconsin.

Whether Sinking of British Ship California With American
On It Will Be Cause for War Is Up to the President But
Fateful Hour Is Believed Coming Soon "Protect Your
Ships From German Aggression," Advises Lansing.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7. The steady stream of reports telling of the
destruction of merchant ships by German submarines was brought to a
Climax tonight by a cablegram to the State Department from Consul Frost
at Queenctown announcing that the British passenger liner California had
been torpedoed without warning, and that an American citizen was among
the survivors.
MAY DECIDE UNITED STATES.
Whether this will prove to be the overt act to drive the United States
into war no one would attempt to say tonight President Wilson, who
must make the decision, had retired when the news came, and officials did
not wake him up. Late in the afternoon he had been informed of a mes
sage from Consul Frost telling of the sinking of the California, but giving
no details as to warning or the presence of Americans.
The President undoubtedly will wait for complete reports on the dis
aster before determining whether the time has come for him to go to
congress to ask authority "to use any "means that may be necessary for
the protection of our seamen and our people."
WOMEN AND CHILDREN MISSING.
The consul's first report said there was "one death and thirty hos
pital cases," among the more than 300 people on the steamer. The second
added no information concerning casualties except that the survivors
were landed at Queenstown tonight, and that some were still missing,
including two women and several children.
The fact that the American escaped lessened in a degree the excite
ment created by the news, but only in a degree.
Sing 50 in Week
More than a score of merchant
craft have been sent to the bot
tom in the war zone within the
past 24 hours and fifty or more
since the German proclamation of
ruthless warfare on the seas went
into effect last Thursday. It is
realized that if no citizens of the
United States was among the vic
tims, it merely was a fortunate
accident and that it nuy be onty
a matter of hours before Ameri
cans are caught in such whole
Bale destruction.
The message from Consul Frost

. competition.
"I am afraid that I am too late,"
said a candidate to the contest editor
the day before yesterday. Yet two
other candidates who had made no ef
fort whatever, -walked into contest
headquarters yesterday morning, sot
a few pointers from the contest editor,!
and before the close of the day, they :
had secured a club of five six months'
subscriptions each. Like many others,
these candidates have their circle of
friends, but ;.uch an asset would have
availed them lothing, if they had k pt
on fretting ati savins: "It is no use;
I am too late."
There are at least 20.000 people in
the Warren District, and if 200 candi-'
dates were active, they could not see
all these pAple during the few days
that this contest has been on. True
enough, candidates have an incentive
to canvas the business district of a
city first in any contest, but the busi-.
ness district, dear candidates, is but
a drop in the bucket, otherwise, the
Review would not attempt to inaugur
ate this contest and keep it under way
lor seven weeks; even at the end of
that time, it is expected that then
will be hundreds who have never been
visited by a candidate.
Because a few candidates started to
gather subscriptions two or three days
afe'j, it is no criterion that they will
preserve to the end, and as a matter
of fact tie contest editor himself has
not the remotest idea as to which
among them might be the final win
ner. In reality, jusj as likely as not,
and as is frequently tue case, the can
didate who enters now or in two or
three days from now, stands juot as

It is an established fact in all walks

Therefore, if you go out tjjay, de

by Margaret Turiihull from the story
by Alexandra de yannelli. Mr. Telle

and an all-star Lasky cast.
This T'araniount picture is the first
photodraTiatie production in which
Lou-Tcllccen has appeared since his
marriage to the famous Geraldlnc
Farrer.
As the young Count who has passed
from sinner to saint, Mr. Tellegen
will be. seen at his best- and he and
Elliott Dexter present one of the most
thrillin? duel scenes ever witnessed
on tt-e screen. Mr. Tellenen h:.s the
distinction of being the champion
swordsman of Europe, and Mr. Dex
ter is well known for his prowess with
the foils. Many scenes, taken in a
military hospital faring the present
war, are realistic in the extreme, and
were supervised by a wounded French
major now convalescing in the Unit

is anxious to meet Bisbee's heavy

Weber worked out on the V. M. C.

wrestlers and appears perfectly fit
for the coming struggle. In a long
iratoh it appears Weber should have
much the better of it. He is young

Rockier has twenty years experience
to bac k him up against Weber's four

It was learned yesterday that an

Weber whert told of it last night de

they hoped the Lowell club members
would feel no affront. It is hoped the
two will come to (ome arrangement

GERMAN-AMERICANS.
Nothing has so served to eliminate the distasteful
hyphen than the action of those citizens of this country,
of German origin who have unqualifiedly pledged their
fealty to the United States in case of war with Germany
The response to President Wilson's plea for entire loy-
alty from every citizen has met with no. more hearty ar.d
convincing response than that from these people with,
Teutonic blood in their veins. Their pledges are inspir
ing, especially in view of the fact that their decision
doubtless necessitates a sentimental sacrifice.
Another interesting sidelight flashed forth from the re
cent war developments Is that of William Jennings
Bryan who thereby cuts one of the sorriest figures of
the day.
The new German proclamation of ruthless submarine
warfare in which all ships within a prescribed zone am
to be sunk is not an isolated wrong against the United
States. It is the culmination of a long series of calcu
lated wrongs and insults. It is not, something that we
are bound to consider as the result of a temporary fit of
aberration from which we may expect an equally sudden
restoration of reason and sanity. It is the ripe product
of a deliberate policy which 'has extended through tl.e
whole period of the war, and in which Germany by deerls
and acts has proclaimed time after time that the United
States had no rights that a desperate autocracy was
bound to respect. It is unique only in the infamy of hav
ing been treacherously promulgated at a time when an
honorable peace was possible, and the President wrs
exerting all his influence to that end.
Mr. Bryan declared t.'iat regardless of all other con
siderations "our first duty is now and has been to keep
out of war." Let Mr. Bryan first persuade the Kaiser
to refrain from dragging us into war. If the German
government will step making war upon the United States,
all of us will be more than glad to keep out of war, but
no human power can keep us out of war when Germany
wages war against us. We may refuse to fight. We may
refuse to resist. We may refuse to act in self-defense.
We may passively submit to all the crimes against per
son and property that Germany chooses to commit. We
may surrender all our sovereign rights and prostrate
ourselves before the triumphant chariot of Prussian
militarism, but we shall not have been kept out of war.
We shall merely have been kept from defending our
selves against wanton acts of war.
Kor the United States there is no peaceful or honor
able way out or this situation except through uncondi
tional Vithdrawal by Germany of the submarine decree
and unqualified adherence to the rules of cruiser war
fare. Unless Germany does that, the only question for
the American people to consider relates to the means
and extent of the measures that they will adopt to pro
tect themselves against barbaric warfare. The first step
that must be taken to assert the dignity, the honor and
the rights of the United States is for the President to
fulfil the warning of the Sussex ultimatum and "sever
diplomatic relations with the government of the German
Empire altogether."

Cochise county is in a fair way to gain widespread
reputation through lier legislative representatives and
their brainstorms. Francis is the sponsor of this sing
song bill No. S9. The words will cost $250 and the pub
lication rights $250. Very cheap iudeedj! Senator
Roberts, also a Cochise product, almost immortalized
himself by propounding an anti-gambling bill which was
the last word in senseless, impracticable legislation, but
Senator Sutter saved him by pruning the measure into
workable shape. Mrs. McKay, another Cochiseite, is ei:
thusiastic for the old-age pension bill, a rehashed edition
I of senate bill No. 16 introduced in the last legislature
and later thrown out because of its unconstitutionality.
Cochise county, in spite of severe trials imposed by
light-weight representatives is assured of a considerable
measure of respect through the capability and scund
sense of such men as Senator Sutter and Representative
Tom Hughes.
PLANTING TREES.
The reforestation of areas that should never have been
deforested proceeds aparc. Iast year the state of
J'cnnsylvania planted L'l.dOO.OOO trees on state lauds.
The work is to lie continued this year on nearly as big a
scale. New York and several other eastern states, whose
original forests have been pretty thoroughly stripped, arc
engaged in the same praiseworthy program. The newer
stateb, where citizeus have not yet got over the pioneer's
dislike for the forest as a natural enemy of man, are
cuaogiug their viewpoint and conserving their timber
more carefully. There is hope that they will escape tUe
fate of our older commonwealths.
Along with, tliis public activity, people everywhere have.
ccbo to attach new importance to trees, whethtr as pro
tectors of the soil and conservers of rait fa 11. or as lim
ber cf increasing value, or simply as things of bauty aud
comfort for themselves and pobtcrify. "Arbor day", oii-
largely sentimental, is now practical. And we. don't on
line uur trec'-plaiiliiig to one day in the year. We plant
trees nearly' all the year 'round, on our farms, in our
yards, iu our parks and along our streets, just as our
public authorities plant them in the mountains. Noth

HARNESSING! VOLCANOES.
Now another great source of power is applied to hu
man use. To the familiar "white coal" is added what
might be called "red coal". Surely volcanic power L.
red, if it's any colcr.
The Electrical W rid describes a remarkable experi
ment carried to success in northern Italy. At Larderello
a volcano has been utilized hs a steam engine. Three
powerful jets of super-heated steam escaping through
fissures in the side of a mountain have been connected
with an electric power house. One of the volcanic
"units" has been working since las. January, another
since last April, ai d the third has just begun.
Tiiere Is said to be plenty more of the same sort of
enerfey available in that locality, and in various other
rarta of Italy. Already the industries of Tuscany have
felt the relief afforded by this cheap power, handicapped
as they are by the high price of coal.
Thus one more dream of imaginative engineers is be
ing realized. And the experiment may soon be copied- in
our own country. If they can harness jets of.volcauic
steam in Italy, why can't we do it in the Yellowstone
Park region, where many thousand horsepower are go
ing to waste. '
There must be other ways, too, of tapping the heat
enery which manifests itself in many regions where the
earth's crust is thin. We may even arrive some day at
the realization of Camille Flammarion's dream, digging
great holes in the earth where' the crust is of normal
thickness, and getting into direct contact with the incal
culable reservoirs of heat that underlie every spot of the
earth's surface.

LAND PROFITS TO PAY WAR DEBTS.
A group of Englishmen, constituting an "empire re
sources committee", is credited with a spectacular pla
for paying off the British war debt. It is proposed that
the British government shall go into the real estate
business on a huge scale, and discharge that stupendous
obligation by means of the profits made in developi'.g
land areas in the outlying parts of the empire.
Several millions of arable land, for instance, are to be
purchased in Canada, from the Dominion government, to
be paid for in yearly installments of cash. The Domin
ion would use that cash in developing the land imme
diately. It would be opened to settlement and sold a? i
big advance, the proceeds going to the imperial govern
ment. It is estimated that $2,000,000,000 might be made
in this way in Canada alone.
At first blush the project looks Utopian. But in view
of what the various belligerent powers have accomplish
ed iu the way of state enterprise since the war began, it's
rash to pronounce any scheme Impossible.
Certainly billions have been made iu real estate de
velopment in Canada, Australia, South Africa and other
Britith possessions, as they have in this country. Bil
lions more will be made within a decade. The only ques
tion is, who shall do the work aud who shall reap the re
ward? Heretofore the protit has gone to the private in
vestor and speculator. There's no reason why the gov
ernment shouldn't do the developing, and do it. better than
private companies have done. And what's to prevent the
government taking the profit if it does Ihc work?
But the mere prospect of such a radical step 'next door
is euounh to frighten our own real estate operators, al
ready harassed by fear of the single tax. The companies
engaged ill developing new (rai f.s in our own West would
probably coudeniu , the Canadian venture as downright
"confibcation."

'To, After putting in between twelve
an, eighteen hours a day for eignt
yeB. Smouse recently decided to
git up criminal investigation ana
fid employment where he wouldn't
ntinually be on somebody's trai!.
The former detective is a close frien'l
of Captain Tob Rynning, now under
sheriff of San Diego county, and was
kept busy yesterday looking up old
friends of the captain's at the Iatter's
request and giving them his "best re
gards." " 'Cap' Rynning asked me before I
left San Diego to fook up all his old
friends here," said Smouse last night,
"but I've already ran into about twc
hundred of them and, from present
ndications I'll have to stop about
every man in Arizona if I want to
nake good my promise. Captain Ryn
ning was the popular ch'Jice for chief
of police in San Diego recently, but,
I understand, turned the job down on
account of the many petty prejudices
existing between members of the de
partment, the mayor's office and the
city hall. However, he is one of the
best officials the San Diego sheriffs
office ever had and I can readily see
h'ow he made so many friends here
in Arizona while serving with the
rangers."

METRO MASTERPIECE
FOR CENTRAL TONIGHT
"Life's Shadows" Is Story of
Lawyer-Philosopher in
' Eastern Village. .
I "Life's Shadows," a strong and pow
erful five-part Metro wonderplay, in
i which William Nigh, the versatile
! director-author-star, and Irene Howley,
I noted for her delineation of difficult
! dramatic rules, are starred, will be
'the big feature production at the Cen
tral theatre, Lowell, today. In addi
tion to these two popular stars there
is an exceptionally strong supporting
cast which includes Robert Elliot, Roy
Clair, Will S. Stephen, Kathleen Al
laire, William Yearance, Frank Mont
gomery, David Thompson, Harry Lin
son, Harry D. Blakem'Jre, Ruth Thorp
and Grace E. Stevens.
In "Life's Shadows" Mr. Xigh plays
the role of an impecunious lawyer in
the small town of Purity. He is sadly
misunderstood by the natives, al
though he is gentle and kind-hearted,
and ever a quaint philosopher. The
other residents do. not realize it, but
the lawyer's invisible guiding hand is
the one that controls the destiny of
the little "old town, and he is respon
sible for lifting the community up
from the commonplace. He rights
many of the great wrongs in the town
and brings to the surface the best in
all who come in contact with him. Il
is a decidedly novel story of unusual
interest, and has scores of bis dra
matic moments. Miss Howley has an
excellent ijle, that of a girl who has
come to the town to "go straight."
Supreme comedy is blended with
pathos with rare artistry-
The exterior scenes for "Life's
Shadows" were staged and photo
graphed in the town of Allaire, N. J.,
which is known as "The Deserted
Village." At one time it was the fore
most thriving center in New Jersey,
but more than seventy-five years agj
was deserted. All the quaint old houses
and stores were used to good advant
age by Director Nigh. He also em
ployed many of the real natives there

respects, it is one of the most inter

1CARRIZAL SURVIVOR
, TELLS OF HIS ESCAPE
Member of Tenth Cavalry De
scribes Battle; Says He Lay
in Ditch Nine Hours While
Companions Are Captured.
Fred C. Thompson, a member l
Company C, Tenth V. S. Cavalry, at
the time of the Carrizal fight, is now
a resident of Bisbee. Thompson re
cently received his honorable dis
charg from the army at Fort Hua
chuca after having served the stars
and stripes for 13 consecutive years.
He told the following story of his ad
ventures in the Carrizal mix-up yes
terday :
"Companies C and K were march
ing toward El Valle under command
of Captain Boyd with orders to march
through Carrizal. When we were
within about three-quarters of a mile
of the town General Gomez met us.
Captain Boyd asked him if we might
pass through Carrizal and Gomez said
'no.'
" 'All right, general, that's all,' re
plied Captain Boyd. Then Gomes rode
back toward Carrizal and Captain
Boyd said to us: 'All right, boys, de
ploy. We have orders from General
Pershing to march through there.
"While we were deploying General
Gomez' men opened fire with machine
guns. The fight lasted 45 minutes,
during which time Captain Boyd and
Lieutenant Adair and 12 of our men
were killed. 'Most W our men were
taken prisoners. When the ammuni
tion was exhausted I hid in a ditch
for nine hours and then walked about
25 miles. Then I caught a Mexican
pony and rode about 90 miles until
1 reached camp. I was the second man
to reach camp, a fellow named flams
having already arrived there. I think
I've had all of Mexico that I care for.
During the battle and my flight I did
not have a thing to eat or drink and
I sure was all in when I reached that
camp."

POPULAR OLD PIONEER:
DIES IN TOMBSTONE
Many Bisbee Friends Will At
tend Funeral Services To
day of Frank Payla.
Frank Payla, one of the most popu
lar pioneers in the southwest, died in

county ror 40 years, living in Tomb
stone the greater part of that time.
He was in the saloon business at the
county seat for many years, but dur
ing the latter part of his life devoted
his efforts to mining interests. In
this work he is said to have loEt a
large amount of money which he had
saved. Funeral services will be held

CLIFTON MALLORY TO
PLAY.DAVID GARRICK
AT ORPHEUM TONIGHT
Quaint Old English Comedy.
to He Presented by Capable
People Who Appeared Last
Evening in "The Test".
Clifton Mallory and his talented
company will appear at the Orpheum
tneatre tonight in that bright English
comedy, "David Garrick."
The comedy, "David Garrick." is
written around an actual experience
of this once famous actor, which hap
pened in London, during his famous
run in Hamlet, with a boarding school
girl who had fallen in love with him.
The play places the actor in such a
position that he must act both comedy
and tragedy, a task which has tried
the abilities of some of our most fam
ous actors. Mr. Clifton Mallory seems
one of the few who has made a suc
cess of this very trying character.
Everybody should be interested in a
great play, written by a great author,
one which has been played by such
artists as the elder Sothern, t'jodwin.
Willard and Charles Wyndhani, before
the crowned heads of Europe and the
elite of America. Such a play must
possess genuine merit, elevating the
stage, the actor and humanity, as only
the work of the true artist can be
used both in the rendering of the play
and in the construction of the stage

Mining and Financial News
BY SCVIEW
XKW YORK. Feb. 7.-Tlie conflict
ing :inl shifting movements attendant
upon today's operations were in them
sehvs evidence of the increasing un
certainties arising from the interna
tional situation.
Shares of the numerous companies
which are likely to derive additional
revenues from the sale of war pro
ducts were again brought forward,
while rails evinced greater heaviness
on the recurrence of liquidation com
monly accented as emanating from
Teutonic sources. This view was re
flected by the weakness of Canadian
Pacific, a former favprite of the Ber
lin bourse, which made a gross de
cline of GV,. to 14S'i. its lowest price
in almost two years. Minor rails were
in light demand.
Specialties were at their best dur
ing the early part of the session, los
ing virtually all their advantage in
the later reversal in rails. IT. S.
Steel closed at a net loss of
points after having shown an actual
gain of a point.
Changes in other industrials, cop
pers and various unclassified issues
were greater, in the forenoon gains
of from .3 to 6 points being substitut -
ed by net losses of 1 to 3 points, all
the activity of the last hour being on
the down scale. Total sales 935.000
shares.
The extraordinary strength of ex

CHICAGO. Feb. 7. Activities of
German submarines caused sharp
breaks in wheat values today. The
market closed unsettled at the same
as yesterday's finish to four cents
lower, with May at 1.69 to 1.70 and
July 1.46 to 1.46. Corn and oats
showed virtually no change as coin
pared with 24 hours before. The out
come in provisions was a setback of
7'-i at 10 to 52 cents.
Cownward swings in the price of
wheat began as soon as trading open
ed; and they attained their greatest
force shortly before the end of toe
day. Trade authorities seemed unan
imously of the opinion that the whole
sale destruction of vessels had check
ed export business and was turning
speculators to the selling side of the
market. Some bearish leaders even
suggested that after all this country
might still have a liberal carry-over
of old wheat and when the first re
ceipts of the 1917 crop were availa

tral countries appeared to be almost
complete, and there was no evidence
of any fresh business with the enten-

Eat leu meat and take a glass
of Salts to flush out kidneys.
Drink plenty water.
Uric acid in meat excites the kid

bladder is irritated, and you may be
obliged to seek relief two or three
times during the night. When the
kidneys clou you must help them
flush off the body's urinous waste or
you'll be a real sick person shortly.
At first you feel a dull misery in the
kidney region, you suffer from back
ache, sick headache, dizziness, stom
ach gets sour, tongue coated and you
feel rheumatic twinges when the
weather is bad.
Eat less meat, drink lots of water;
nlso get from any pharmacist four
ounces of Jad Salts; take a table
spoonful in a glass of water before
breakfast for a few days and your
kidneys will then act fine. This Tam
ous salts Is made from the acid of
grapes and lemon juice, combined
with lithia, and has been used for gen
erations to clean clogged kidneys and
stimulate them to normal activity, al
so to neutralize the acids in urine, so
it no longer is a source of irritation,
thus ending bladder weakness.
Jad Salts is Inexpensive, cannot in

should take n"w and then to keep the
kidneys clean and active. Druggists

Edwards' C j Tablets are
a Harmless Substitute
Dr. Edwards' Olive Tablets the sub
stitute for calomel are a mild but sure
laxative, and their effect on the liver is
almost instantaneous. They arc the re

M treat liver and bowel complaints with
calomel His efforts to Icni.-h it bro.ht
out these little olive-colored luMets.
These pleasant little tablets do the
giiod that calomel does, but have no kid
after effects. They don't injure the
teeth like strong liquids or calomel.
They take hold of the trouble and
quickly correct it. Why cure the liver
at the expense of the teeth? I alomel
sometimes plays havoc with the gums.
So do strong liquids. It U bet nr.t to
take calomel, but to let Dr. Edwards'
Olive Tablets take its place.
Most headaches, "dullness and tliat
lazy feeling come from consttpation and
a disordered liver. Take Dr. EdxvarcV

Reports to the Company's Directors on progress of mine development
as follows:
"Within the past sixty days ISO feet of development work has
been done in driving tunnels. Out cf this ISO feet.
ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FEET HAS BEEN
IN ORE,
occurring as chalcopyrite associated with ryrite in a light colored
schist. This ore is persistent in all the workings.
Over a mile of substantial road has been constructed, connecting
the property with the county roads to allow of drilling rigs being
placed on the ground.
Two houses have been constructed en the Company s townsite.
An adequate supply of pure water for domestic purposes has been
developed, which will lie piped for gravity flow to the townsite.
The result of development work has been eminently satisfactory,
in thut it bears out predictions made for the future of the property by
its engineers.
Drilling to determine quantity and qualify of ore at depth will he
commenced just as soon as machinery can be placed on the ground.
T'te Management and Stockholders of the Great Kay have good reason
for elation over the outlook for the property".
The Company's stock is selling for 50 cents per f-hare.

clared that there was no doubt but
what the city would have to cover the
subway in order to get a parking
nlace for automobiles in the near fut
ure, and said also that he believed j
that even now the city would do well
to cover the big ditch in order to
widen Main Street at the turn.
Delbridge also declared that, if the
building were built over the subway
and even with the street, it would
n:nke the corner a dangerous one to
travel around as people and automo
biles would collect in large numbers
jn the street whenever services were
held at the church.
"The street is already too narrow,"
s:iid Delbridge, "and with even a
s "all crowd coming out of the church
f effic conditions would be grently
disturbed. The principal reason why
I objected to the building of the
church over the subway, however, is
ou account of the fact that it is prac-ti-.-aliy
the only place left where the
t Sty can ever hope to establish a
rarking place for automobiles. If we
ltt the church put its new building
Ok-er the subway, we will have estab
lisher a precedent that will be taken
advantage of by other people, until
there will be no more surface space
