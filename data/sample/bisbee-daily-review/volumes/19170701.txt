BAKER REPUDIATES
AGREEMENT FIXING
PRICES FOR GOAL
Neither Defense Council Norj
Its Committees Has Power
To Set Prices, Secretary of
War Advises Member.
, (By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 30. Secre
tary Baker, as president of the Coun
cil of National Defense, repudiated to
night an agreement fixing a tentative
price of $3 a ton for bituminous coal, ;
reached at a conference here Thurs-
day between coal producers. Secretary
Lane, a member of the Defense coun
cil, members of the council's coal pro
duction committee and' the Federal
Trade commission.
Neither the council nor its commit
tees. Secretary Baker said in a letter
to W. S. Gifford, of the council, has
power to fix prices. He added that j
the price of $3 a ton at the mines,!
suggested for bituminous coal, is "ex
orbitant, unjust and oppressive."
Daniel. Also Objects.
Secretary Daniels, another member
of the council, earlier in, the day, said
the agreement would in no way affect
coal purchases for the navy. The
navy, he said, will continue to buy
from the mines at $2.33 a ton, leaving
a price to be determined after the Fed
eral Trade commission has ascertained
production costs.
In his letter to Mr. Gifford, Mr. Ba
ker asserted that he believed all mem
ber of the Defense council agree as
to the limtiations on the powers of
the council and its committees and as
to the effect of the action taken. The

I Notice to Public
I Because our streets are narrow
and congested at best. It is my
wish that the public refrain from
collecting on the sidewalks, thereby
forcing pedestrians into the streets
and in the way of automobile traf
fic. The hundreds of sightseers
who have tnroned to the postof
flce corner the last few afternoons
during the time . of changing of
shifts have occasioned danger to
life and limb of those compelled to
gj through the treets. Curiosity
only is gratified.
The order against congregation
of strikers and Interference with
men going to and from work has
been well obeyed. Citizens should
now 6t their part in helping witn
keeping down street congestion
which might result in accidents. .
Compliance with this suggestion
will relieve the police department
of necessity f enforcement of the
ordinance requiring all persqns to
keep moving on the streets.

ties today turned over to
. the American military police the
necessary military authority for
maintaining discipline in this
town which is now overwhelm

in public life.
In order to assist the Americans
to keep order however, the author
' have issued new and stringent
regulations which forbid the sale
of spiritious liquors to any men in
uniform, which regulate the hours
the men may be admitted to or
served in cafes and restaurants
and which specify that disputes
and disorders shall be referred to
and decided by the Americans.
Cafe Proprietors Warned
Not to Overcharge Americana.
In addition, an unofficial warn
ing has gone out to cafe and res
taurant proprietors specifying
what prices they may charge for
the most common commodities,
and especially food and drink.
The new order permits those at
tached to the military expedition
to -visit cafes only between the
hours of five o'clock In the even
ing and nine o'clock in the even
ing on week days, and from 10
o'clock in the morning to 9 o'clock
in the evening Sundays, and res
taurants between 10 o'clock in the
mornin anil (tc'clock in the af
ternoon week days and from five
p. m. to nine p. m. on Sundays.
Officers and men on leave are
permitted a little more liberty.
Men in uniform may utilize the
popular French "terraces" side
walk seats until after five o'clock
in the evening.'
The ban on spiritous liquors
means that the ' troops here will
henceforth be able to order only
beers and light wines.

HELENA, Mont., June 30. Gover

the receipt of a letter from Missoula,
asking state aid to suppress the In
dustrial Workers of the World element
there. The writer declared that local
authorities had encouraged the con-
centration of its members there. The

investigation on his own part, before
taking any action. The letter states

and General Pershing said to the
guests:
"This is the happiest or the
busy days which I have spent in
France preparing for the arrival
of the first contingent. Today I
have American troops safe on
French soil.
"Now our tasks as soldiers lies
before us. We hope with the aid
of the French leaders and experts
who have placed all the. results of
their experience at our disposal, to
make our force worthy In skill
and in the determination to fight
side by side in arms with the
' French army."
Gleaves Expresses Joy
On Arrival In France.
Rear Admiral Gleaves also
spoke briefly to the visitors.
"Only a few days ago," he said,
"I stood in the shade of the York
town monument where our inde
pendence was won with the assist
ance of the great French Admiral
de Grasse. This is the happiest
day of my life when our navy is
welcomed in a French harbor and
where our soldiers have been dis
embarked. I should feel that it
was neglecting a wonderful op
portunity, if I did not recognize
the earnest and serious co-operation
I have received in my under
taking from General Sibert, his of
ficers and men, in this extraordi
nary overseas expedition. Never
have co-operation and co-ordination
been so imperative nnd s'j
complete between two rtetensive
arms of the nation as at this
moment."
Major General Pershing, true to
his demorcatic principles, refused
to haggle or delay over the nice
ties of etiquette when the question
was raised whether Admiral
Gleaves should call on him or he
on the admiral.
Debarkation of .Troops v
Becomes Old Story.
"The point is that I want to see
him," the general declared. It was
accordingly arranged and more
convenient, that General Persh
ing should go to the flagship as
soon as he was free from the task
of inspection.
Toward the middle of the after
noon General Pershing returned
ashore and he probably will go to
Paris tomorrow (Friday).

CULLEN A. GAIN IS
GENERAL MANAGER OF
THE BISBEE REVIEW
Newspaper Man of Long Ex
perience Named General
Manager of State Consol
idated Publishing Company.
Cullen A. Cain, newspaper and mag
azine editor of much experience in the
middle west and late of St. Louis, has
arrived in Bisbee and has been made
the general manger of the State Con
solidated Publishing Company, of
which the Review is one of the publi
cations. Mr. Cain was in the Warren Dis
trict about six weeks ago and looked
over the local situation and decided
to accept Tie management of the local
newspaper enterprise. He brings to
the Review a wealth of experience in
the newspaper business, having been,
at one time, managing editor of the1
Topeka State Journal and. more lately,
editor of the magazine of the South
western Bell Telephone Company.
Mr. Cain's family will arrive in Bisbee
in a few days to make their home
here.
The Topeka State Journal, several
days ago. printed the following, re
garding Mr. Cain:
"Cullen A. Cain, former managing
editor of the State Journal, is in To
peka today on his way to Bisbee.
Ariz., where he becomes editor and
manager of the Bisbee Daily Review.
He retired from the publicity depart
ment of the Southwestern Bell Tele
phone company In St. Louis last week
and will return to active daily news
paper work July 1.
"Few "formerly of Kansas' news
paper men have made a greater record
during the last few years than C. A.
Cain. In five years in Topeka Cain
went from staft reporter's place to
the state house and political run and
to the manaeine editor's desk. In
those same five years Cain broke into
the magazines and attracted attention
in other publicity fields. Rather sud
denly stories by Cullen A. Cain be
gan to appear in the American, 6ut
ing and other leading periodicals.
"Then Cain went to St. Louis to as
sist in the publication of the South
western Bell Telephone company mag
azine. TI.at was three years ago. In
the magazine field Cain has made the
same rapid progress that character
ized his work on the State Journal.
When Cain announced recently that
he expected to leave the telephone
company, there was a general and sin
cere protest from big salaried officials
of the .giant corporation. The sincer

do the pulling. Weeds grow for no

most of them may b9 pulled several

The Lap.
One often feels that as to laps, .
While we could do without them per
haps. Yet we would miss them quite a lot
For laps are handy, are they not?
One merely sits on cots or "cheers"
or chairs when lo! a Lap appears!
So many things a lap will hold,
A pan of peas, a pot of g'jld.
A shoe to sole, an auto tire.
Or else a lady you adVuire.
Though quite a luxury, we'd call
A lap within the reach of all.
Of all, at least we've heard about
Save those who are extremely stout;
They have no laps and yet, though
sad,
They couldn't reach them if they had.
A blessing on that ancient cuss
Who first discovered laps ir us.
His wife, the neighbors and his kin.
And others be invited in.
That wise, beneficent old chap, .
And showed them how to work a lap.
Its us'.ilness H nany stints.
We certainly have used them since!
And those who scowled soon smiled
instead,
Till soon her lovely smile had spread
Not merely o'er her own fair face.
But near and far and every place!
And if more pretty girls but kenw
What one of their best smiles will do.
How it will spread a many mile,
They'd smile and smile and smile and
smile! ,
Saving Different Things.
A pleasant way to spend a day off is
to look through an old trunk or some
thing to see what you want to throw
away. Here you will find many things
you have always saved, feeling that
some day they might be useful.
Objects of this description seldom
fail to cause laughter. You are con
vulsed to see how carefully you kept
things simply because it would be
ufsteful to throw them out. ' More
over it is amusing to find that you
can't yet make up your mind on the
point.
You can't get away from it. things
o fthis sort are certainly comical.
After you have laughed over them a
while and are willing to consider them
soberly you decide really to get rid of
a lot of them. . Largely a bunch of
junk after all. Never have found any
use for any of It yet'
Pick out a few and out goes all the
rest. Business of picking them over.

IN THE TRENCHES.
Every one knows about the men In the trenches
in France and their heroic deeds with the eyes of the
world upon them and the voices of tie world's praise
in their ears. But what about the men in the
trenches in Bisbee?
What about the men who brave the ridicule and
taunts and gibes and jeers and threats of malicious
strike leaders and mislead strikers and go, daily and
nightly, to the places in the mines and dig and delve
to deliver copper to their brothers in France on the
firing line?
What about the men who pass the picket lines on
the streets and at the mouth of the mines1 with
squared shoulders and the light of a steady resolve
shining unquenchable in their eyes?
It takes as much, if not more courage to face ridi
cule than it does to face shot and shell.
The picket line' in a strike is as pitiless and as
hostile as a picket line in No Man's Land in Flanders.
These Bisbee miners who ignored the strike call
of enemies of their country and their town are play
!sg their part In the great world war just the ssme
as the soldiers under General Pershing who have Just
landed in France and who will soon take their places
in the trenches alongside the dauntless English Tom
mies and the brave Scots and the indomitable Irish-
menand the grim French Poilu. For the soldier in
he trenches must have copper for his guns and shells
and the soldier in the mines must furnish them.
These men in the trenches at Bisbee are fighting
for the happiness and prosperity of their homes and
for the honor of their state against a foe of their
country just the same as the soldiers in the French
trenches are fighting against the Prussian foes. For
the I. W. W. and their tools and agents and dupes
are striking against the success and safety of our
government's soldiers when they strike in the great
copper mines that must be depended upon to furnish
guns and shells for our armies and the armies of
our allies.
And these miners these soldiers in the trenches
at Bisbee have none of the pomp and glory of war
to urge them on. They ire not fighting In the spot
light glare on the world's brilliant stage. No stirring
bugle strains quicken their tread. No Victoria cross
or Legion of Honor await them.
But they know in their hearts they are doing the
right thing. They know they are- doing their duty
by their families, their employers and their town.
They know they are doing the patriotic thing in the
time of their country's crisis. They know they are
standing' for the best interests of their country.
Good soldiers, those Bisbee miners who are sticking
to their posts in the face of all that the enemies of
their town and country can do to drive them away.
And what about the men of Bisbee who have de
serted the trenches?
What about the miners who at heart oppose this
vicious, wicked, senseless, unpatriotic strike?
What about the men who are afraid to take their
stand in the trenches because of the gibes and jeers
of a few out of town trouble-makers and a number of
their own misguided brethren? Is there anything
more cowardly and reprehensible than deseration in
the fact of the enemy? The man who carries water
on both Bhoulders spills his buckets. The fair
weather man who shirks his duty when he knows
his duty Is not worthy of his town.
There is a trench line across our Arizona mount
ains and it girts our wonderful city even as its terri
ble shadow falls upon the towns in France. A MAN'S
PART IN THESE MOMENTOUS TIMES IS TO EN
TER THESE TRENCHES AND STAND GUARD
THERE AND TO DO HIS DUTY.
Good men and true are In those trenches today.
The coward shirks as he has always shirked every
time the call has come for real men. And when the
storm has passed the coward crouches low, strip
ped by his own hands of his manhood. And the
men who stand shoulder to Bhoulder for what they
knew Is the right, these men. when the totals for and
- against their country are summed up. shall stand,
proud and unafraid, and answer the honor roll call of
Public Opinion.
It is a great principle that has called the millions
to the French trenches to fight German autocracy.
A great principle is always worth fighting for. And
In the trenches in Bisbee today men are standing for
a principle. They are standing for their homes, their
town and their country. And those men who allow
themselves to be bulldozed out of these trenches or
who are afraid to enter them are like soldiers who
desert their comrades and their flag in the face of
the enemy and are shamed forever by their own act.
DOBGLAS TAKES PRECAUTIONS.
"Wobbly" activity in the Warren District has inter
ested the people of Douglas to the extent that they have
taken measures to prevent the spread of an infectious.
industrial disease to that community. A set of deter
mined, sensible workingmen, business men and profess
ional men, met on Friday night and banded themsleves
Into a league which will protect the Smelter City's resi
dents and industries.
Douglas doesn't care to harbor the "Wobbly." Douglas
is determined that the I. W. W. shall not find a resting
place In its midst That organization's Intimidating tac
tics, subersive of good government and good morals, has
been warned by the people of the border city that they
will permit none of its predatory tactics and will take
every honorable means to prevent their becoming a pas-
t'lence In the community.
Douglas is right. Experience is a better teacher but
an education gained through its channels is lasting. The
Wobbly" Is an Infection which is curable and prevent
able by the anti-tocsin of organization, determination and
rlear thought action.
The Smelter City has taken a step in the right direc
tion. And the "Wobbly" will be a disappointed aereiici
when he attempts to raise his flag of sedition from the
bshes of Douglas' industries.
Think It Over
Mr. Mud-Diggerl
Mister Mud-Digger, Who pays
for YOUR LOSS? You have only
off four days, but even in that
short a time, YOU have lost for
YOURSELF just exactly four time
$5.35 to $6.00 say an average of
J 5. 50 for each man for each day
they have "rested." Then let's fig
ure the aggregate. If, as some of
the I. W. W. outside promoters say,
there are in the neighborhood of
2,000 men striking in the Warren
District, this would mean 2.00 1
times $5.50 each day, or the tidy
sum of $11,000, for each day, or,
for Wednesday, Thursday. Friday
and Saturday, added together, the
total of YOUR LOSS would amount
to the handsome sum of FORTY
FOUR THUSAND DOLLARS And
all of this time, your daily expense
remains the same. It is now about
time for you Mr. Level Headed
Metal Miner to do a little thinking
of YOUR OWN. Self Preservation
is the FIRST law of Nature, and if
you fail to do a little INDEPEND;
ENT thinking all of your own,
somebody is liable to be a big loser
in the end. Who will it be? Guess
the answer?

THE KAISER'S ALLIES.
The Kaiser missed out on Mexico while racking the
new world for an ally against Uncle Sam. And he fouled
out on Japan when he turned to the Orient for an agent
to strike at the Republic that fiies the Stars and Stripes
for an Emblem. But the Hohenzollerns are persevering.
They never give up. They always try again. .
So Kaiser Bill turns to the L W. W., and here the
leed of Prussian frightfulness and wantonness and sedi
tion and destruction fell upon fruitful soil.
Men of Bisbee, U. S. A., let us introduce to you the
Prussian War Lord's new Allies, the I. W. W. German
gold for the leaders; German jeers for the men who are
luped Into quitting good jobs and striking at their own
rcmes and institutions.
The Mexicans and Japs gave Kaiser Bill the clammy
ye and the foot ball shoulder as they passed him by.
But the I. W. W. took his money and lighted we lorca
rf sedition and placed it in the hands of thoughtless and
ibe heedless under their control and the misguided ones
ones whom they have seduced by impractlabfe and fan
tastic promises, and thus the central powers and the
Turks and Bulgars found an ally in the Land of the Free.
Ye Gods! How can this thing be true?
NO FURTHER EXCUSES.
With the appointment of many deputies by Sheriff
Wheeler and the attitude and aid given the miners by
the several organizations in the Warren District, who are
orking for the elimination of the cancerous growth on
our industrial life, there Is no further excuse for the men
ho, during the first day or two of the present trouble
declared they were in danger should they brave the mob
nd en to their duties.
The several organizations have closely co-ordinated
their work until every man, who goes on or comes on
ift. is practically guaranteed freedom from molestation
. i i j h.nJa nf the "Vohhlv" DicketS. Th'J
Ol any smu i iuc - - -
daneer of personal violence is past. Pickets have been
eliminated from the roads and trails of the several prop
erties and men, who are working, come and go as before
i tli nut fear of interference.
It is extremely difficult to persuade many men that this
c.,,.tinn has been brought about. It is. nevertheless, a
fact Protection is assured. The sheriff has guaranteed
tafptv to men who desire to work.
rv. not let a time-worn excuse further retard the woric-
ingmen of the Warren District from their avowed duty
and rights.

(Arizona Republican.)
The strikes of the metal miners are
so w'.desrpead and synchronized as to
lead to the belief that there is back
of the movement a purpose to embar
rass the government. It may be a uer
mon nlnt nr It mav be onlv an expres
sion of sin anachistic sentiment against
war and the government.
The new organization directing
these strikes Is of admitted alliance
with the I. W. WM which Is opposed
to the war. to any war, and whose
head, W. D. Haywood, more than a
year ago declared that the country
would not be permitted to enter a war.
that the Industrial workers of the
countrv would prevent it; that they
would be brought together to paralyze
transportation, produC'on and every
arm of the government.
As to this state, we do not believe
that the strikes will be of long con
tinuance. In most strikes of largo

ticularly aggravating grievance, a ma
jority of those who take part in them
do so reluctantly, and unless deterred

assistance in opening or keeping their
property open. No man wno wants; 10
work will be kept out of a mine or

threatened disturbances are otherwise

that the local authorities will be able

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
GRAY, BROWN AND RED
TUBES IS EXPLAINED
Demands of Racing Drivers
r or 1 ubes of txlra strength
Gave Rise To Manufacture
of Goodrich Brown Tube. .
The difference that exists between
-rrev auto-tire tubes and the brown
and red varieties is well explained by
J. J. Bowen, of the Bisbee Auto Co.
He says. "Most motorists know there
is a difference between grey, brown
and red tubes, but do not exactly com
prehend the true distinctions.
"The Goodrich grey tube can be con
veniently taken as a good compara
tive standard. Analysis has shown
!hla tube to contain a higher percent-
ta of nure rubber than any other.
The only ingredient used outside of
the finest rubber is the small amount
of sulphur used for vulcanizing, but
while this tube has established an en
viable renutation another condition
lias entered jnto tube construction.
With the attaining of tremendous !
and unheard-or speeds on the racing j
track the demands came for a tubq i
as well as tire that would give extra
security, and be capable-of withstanding-
the utmost punishment. This
brought out the Goodrich Brown Tube
made in laminated piles of inspected
rubber, similar in strength, resiliency
rnd quality to the grey, but possessing
the added virtue of being almost leath
er-like in its toushness. This tube
minimizes the chances of pinching, be
sides which it was so husky mat u
actually reinforces the tire. As to the
color, the formula used is responsible
for this, as the same method of con
struction and grade of nibher is used
n all Goodrich tubes the formula
alone differing.
"The motorist who wi.shes to secure
the strongest, toughest, most service
chle tube, and one tliat will out-wear
his casing, had better follow the lead
and choice of the raring drivers.

COMPROMISE CLAUSE
FOR FOOD MEASURE
WASHINGTON, June 30. Much
progress toward a compromise on pro
hibition and litlle on other features in .
the food control bill was made today!
by the senate. j
Sentiment crystallized in favor of a
substitute prohibition section follow
ing the line of President Wilson's sug
gestion to prohibition leaders to drop
the fight against the manufacture of
beer and wines. i
After conferences with other leaders.
Senator Chamberlain drafted a tenta-.
tive section which would stop manu
facture of distilled beverages only,
without giving the president any au
thority over malt and vinuous bev-'
erages. This draft will be considered
tomorrow at a -special meeting of the
senate agriculture committee. It is
said by the leaders to have the general
support of senators although several
plan an earnest effort to give the pres
ident power to discontinue brewing
and wine-making. j ,
The administration loaders also
plan to eleiminate the provision giv- '
ing the president authority to com- .-
mandeer existing stocks of distilled
spirits.
General debate with speeches by
Senators Lewis and Reed occupied the ed the airplane. Mr. Wright is en
aenate all.of todav. Senator Chamber, thusiastic over thewar department's
lain tonight said it was not probable
that he bill would be passed before the

Success of Cornelia
Stimulates Activity
In the A jo District
First Cathode From Big Leaching Plant Is Sent To State
House; Initial Shipment of Refined Copper Marks Open
ing of New Chapter In Metal Mining History of Arizona;
Smaller Properties Around Ajo Are Being Rapidly De
veloped; District Faces Great Future.
While mining operations in the Warren District are being temporarily
interferred with by the Industrial Workers of the World who appear to be
attempting to cripple the government, under the mask of helping labor, by
trying to tie up all of the metal producers of the country, activities In other
parts of the state are going ahead as usual.
The Ajo district, already famous among the copper regions of the world.
is steadily increasing in prominence as a metal producing area that is but
in the first stage of development. A new chapter was started in the history
of copper mining June 18, when the first shipment of refined electrolytic cop
per was made from the New Cornelia's big leaching plant to Perth Amboy,
N. J. The product was 99.9 fine. The shipment consisted of 61,000 pounds,
worUi at 25 cents per pound, 15,250.00 The first complete plate, or cathode,
from the plant was sent to the state house at Phoenix, where It will repose
as a memento or the only plant of its kind in the world, and to mark the
beginning of an industry that will help to bring wealth to the state and that
will last for many ears until the time shall have come for the treatment of
other ores, different and richer.
NEW CORNELIA AND INSPIRATION COMPOUND.
Since the first shipment was made from New Cornelia, other shipments
have followed at the rate of about 80.000 pounds daily, and it will not be Ions
before capacity (100.000 pounds.) is reached, although the approach will be
gradual while the plant is being thoroughly limbered up.
Two cars of calcines are being shipped daily to the C. & A. smelter at
Douglas. This is the product remaining from Bisbee pyrite ore that has been
roasted at the New Cornelia plant and the 6ulphur content removed and made
use of. When the ore or calcine reaches Douglas it is smelter and values in
copper, silver and gold recovered. .
Prominent mining men of the southwest are frequently calling attention
to the fact that the cases of New Cornelia and Inspiration are in some re
spects paralleled. Inspiration ore runs 1.68, as against 1.50 for New Cornelia.
Inspiration has around 100,000,000 tons of ore blocked out, while New Cor
nelia has but a little less than 50,000,000. On the other hand. New Cornelia
has considerable high grade ore, of which Inspiration cannot boast.
OTHER PROPERTIES ARE STIMULATED.
The Inspiration was bought by the Gunn-Thompson interests for $3,000,
000, while New Cornelia costs about one-third as much. Inspiration is quoted
at $65.50 and is earning about 17.45 a share. The ore from Inspiration must
be hoisted C40 feet. No hoisting expense is necessary at New Cornelia, the
ore being shoveled from the surface; furthermore there is no overburden
to be removed first.
It seems apparent, therefore, that New Cornelia stock is slated for a
pood rise and that it bids fair to crowd Inspiration as to market values and
dividends.
The success of New Cornelia has stimulated activities on many other
properties. The Ajo Consolidated in diamond drilling its property, three
drills' now being operated. Mining operations, meanwhile, continue and
shipments are being made to the Copper Queen smelter at Dougles. Some
fine speciments of native copper have been taken out recently and the out
look for the property is optimistic.
TWO PROPERTIES TO BE DEVELOPED.
Development of the Ajo-Cornelia, formerly the Cornelia Extension, will
begin in a few days, according to a recent announcement of officials of the
company. Since changing hands Uie property has been idle but the new
owners state that they will launch a plan of active development.
The drift from the 26 foot shaft on the Ajo Peaks groups is reported to
be looking better than ever. Drifting from the bottom of this shaft towards
the northwest is being continued and the vein is said to be widening con-
t
slderably.
Work has been done in several other places farther east, in shallow
openings where there are excellent showings of ore. The formations and in
dications and ore cropping on the east group are among the best in the camp.
The dike, or series of dikes is at least 100 feet in width, and. In the openion of
the operators, here is a good place to sink a shaft at least 100 feet and then
crosscut both north and south.
LACK OF SUPPLIES
MAY FORCE COPPER
MINES TO SUSPEND
GLOBE, Ariz., June 30. The situa-'
tion of Arizona mines in respect to
supplies, particularly of fuel, timbers !
and steel, is rapidly growing serious, j
It may readily be that because of lack j
of sufficient stocks of these necessary ;
materials, the copper producers may
find it necessary at any time to either
greatly curtail or possibly wholly bus- 1
pend their operations Indefinitely.
Cause of the shortage is not so much
the scarcity of the materials as the .
inability to secure cars for their deliv- j
ery. All efforts to secure a change in :
this situation have up to the present;
time been of little or no avail. The '
cars are simply not available, due to
the great increase in demand which (
taa coiuoTLSout through war time re-1
quirements of the government in han
dling troops .equipment and supplies,
mainly ro the eastern seaboard.
Some idea of the heavy requirements
of the cooper mines will be gathered
from exact figures given for one of
the comparatively small producers, the
Old Dominion, at Globe, which requires
800,000 board feet of timber a month
and 29,687 pounds of powder. The
quantity rf oil used daily in the con
duct of copper mining, milling and
smelting in Arizona is not known, but
runs into train loads.
Should the mines go to half-time, as
is more than a possibility, thousands
of unmarried men, the first to be re
leased from employment by the com
panies In the event Vf curtailment of
their forces, would immediately be
made available for the army or for
labor in the agricultural districts.
Committees of Boston milk dealers
and New England Milk Producers' As
sociation expected to meet soon to de
cide on new scale of prices.

AGITATION OF LABOR TROUBLES I i
THREATENS TO EXISTJOODUCEOS' PATIENCE
The fifteen lar?c producers of cop
per in Arizona contributed upwards of
twenty million dollars to the Liberty
loan. Only about two million of this
was credited directly to Arizona. The
balance was credited to various states
in which the head offices of these com
panies are located and from which the
boards of directors ordered the sub
scriptions made for the companies. As
an instance, the Phelps-Dodge Co., is
reported to have subscribed some sev
en million dollars to the bond Issue,
but of this sum only $350,000 was
credited directly to Arizona. Senator
W. A. Clark contributed several mil
lion dollars, but it is credited mostly
to New York.
In one day the employes of one min
ing company in Arizona, the Miami
Copper Co.. subscribed $16,500 to the
loan. The miners, smelter and mill
workers of the Globe-Miami district
subscribed more than $250,000, which
would mean a $50 bond for every one
of their number. In the Warren Dis
trict the miners subscribed more than
$300,000, or something over a $50 bond
for each one of their number. In the

trict and the Clifton-Morenci district dividends, for they have become stock

that is not drawn upon in some way to
keep the copper mines going at etlicj
ency. The ten million in wages com
pares with disbursement in that chan
nel in the first months of 1916 of
about five million dollars. The wage
paid at that time was $3.25 to $3.50
the day, with labor exceedingly glad
to secure the employment at that
price. The advance since has been
voluntary on the part of the copper
producers. The total has been doubl
ed, and wages are two-thirds higher.
This two-thirds' amounts to dividends
at the rate of about $3,000,000 the !
months or $36,000,000 the year volun
tarily paid the copper industry work
ers in Arizona, a total that compares
very well with the dividends which
have been paid the investors whose
money made the copper mines. In
this connection there Is the note
worthy feature that a great many
Arizona miners are at this time draw

SALOME, Ariz., June SO. With
speed that is truly unusual, the Black

less than three months jld, is proceed

JEROME, June 30. For the purpose
of making an Investigation of various

Arkansas, arrived in Jerome last week.
He went to the 1640-foot level of tbe

drill bite into the schist.
"People here in Jerome do not re
alize the tremendous interest in Ar

in my country, or the eagerness with
which we await the arrival of the

the other evening. "A majority of the

I was out here in January and
after I returned I did not look at a

see me and ask me what I had seen.
I had to take them into my private

MUCH TO SCIENTIFIC
ANSWERS LAST CALL IN CANADA
Friends of Mrs. Walter Douglas will
be sorry to learn of her father, Dr.
Robert Bell, D. Sc. (Cam.). F. R. S.
at Rathwell, Manitoba on June 18Ui
following a paralytic stroke. Mrs.
Douglas who was in California left
immediately for Winnipeg where the
funeral took place on the 33rd.
One of the Winnipeg papers, in com
menting on the death of Dr. Bell,
prints the following:
In the passing of Dr. Robert Bell
Canada loses one of the most noted
men of science. Formerly director of
the Canadian geological survey, his
labors in this field of research, have
won for him the highest honors, in
cluding a fellowship in the Royal so
ciety, the patron's gold medal of the
Royal Geological society and the Cul
lom gold medal of the American Geo
logiacl society, which was conferred
upon Dr. Bell in 1907, the first time
that it had ever been received by any
other than an American citizen. The
Bell river, a west branch of the Not
taway, is officially named after him.
He was medical officer, naturalist
and geologist of the Neptune expedi
tion in 1884 and of the Alert expedi
tion in 1885 to Hudson Strait and
Bay, was also geologist of the Diana
expedition in 1897, when he surveyed
the south coast of Baffin Land, and
penetrated to the great lakes of its
interior.
He acted as royal commissioner on
the mineral resources of Ontario in
1888. For his geological work in the
north the university of Cambridge
conferred upon Dr. Bell the de'gree of
doctor of science (honoris cause). As
most of his explorations were through
country quite unknown, Dr. Bell was
obliged to name a vast number of
rivers, islands, capes, bays and lakes,
and he has indeed, been called "the
li !'! ill,1,
Further evidence of Studebaker de
pendability is shown by the popularity of
Studebaker cars in California, where
people test and prove their cars by con
tinuous service every day in the year and
where there are more Studebakers regis
tered than any car selling at over $500.
In Detroit where 80 of all cars
are made, where thousands of people are
directly connected with the industry,
where they know the materials and work
manship that go into cars and the organ
izations behind them there are more
Studebakers registered than any other
car selling at over $500.
The foregoing is proof that people
who know cars from service rendered and
people best equipped to judge automobile
values prefer Studebakers.
There could be no better guide than
this for you in purchasing your car.
More than 300,000 Studebaker cars
in every part of the world have made
good in the hands of their owners as
yours will make good for you.
TV,
principal place-name father of Can
ada." Most of his work was done
by canoe with Indian guides or
French Canadian voyageurs and by
this means Dr. Bell explored the
coasts of Hudson bay. Lakes Superior,
Winnipeg and Manitoba. It is said
that Dr. Bell saw more game, fish,
wild Indians and Eskimos than any
other man. He worked out much
valuable data concerning the distri
bution of Canadian forest trees. He
collected a great amount of informa
tion on the folklore of then almost
unknown Indian tribes and also made
valuable 'collections of wild animals,
birds and plants in territories that
were then an unknown country. One
of the most remarkable incidents in
the history of Canadian ornithology
was Dr. Bell's discovery of the scls-sor-tailed
fly-catcher, a bird of the
southern United States at York Fac
tory, on the Hudson bay.
"Among the rivers upon which Dr.
Bell's work of geography had won
for him such distinction are the Ath
abasca, the Slave, Churchill, Nelson,
Hayes, Winnipeg and the Albany.
"Dr. Bell's winter home was in Ot
tawa." Business agent of International As
sociation of Machinists predicts that
the government will commandeer ship

Crown King mine aboue $2.0(i0.0io!

$300,000 worth anil the Lane mine
about $200,000 worth. The Mud Hole
and Homestead mines in the Walker
Basin district were also prolific pro
ducers of silver ores an was likewise
the Leghorn mine in the Cherry Creek
dictrict. A similar record attaches to
the Tip Top mine at Tip Top. former
ly worked by Haggin & Hearst, and
to numerous other silver, or silver
gold properties throughout Yavapai
county. The properties specifically
mentioned herein were selected
from the roster by reason of the fact
that they are again operative or aro
about to become operative. The ores
in a number of these mines show a
tendency to make into copper at deph,
the condition being one which tends
to increase rather than to lessen their
popularity and worth.
Two Cases In Point.
This transmutation disposition is
particularly noticeable in the gold-silver
ores opened in the Homestead
mine at Walker Basin, and in the Leg
horn mine in the Cherry Creek dis
trict. Some months ago Mr. J. H.
Shockley, of New York City, a wed
known mining engineer, examined the
Homestead property for Irving K.'Far-i
rington, also of New York City. Fol
lowing the examination Mr. Ferringtoi
took over the property for a number
of his clients. An ore shoot is exposed
for a length of 200 feet on both side
of the shaft at a depth of 200 feet
The deposit carries an average of $30
gold-silver per ton and shows consid
erable chalcopyrite and a little cop
per glance.
The gold-silver ores being mined in
the Leghorn mine, formerly worked
by the Leghorn Mines Kstate. and
now being operated by the Copper
Lode Mines company, are breaking an
average of $20 per ton. The ore bodies
exposed on the fourth level and in the
workings giving off from the bottom
of the shaft a depth of 640 feet aic
well impregnated with copper. There
is a marked increase in the per cent
of copper at the deeper point of oper
ations over that prevailing on the 4i0
foot level. This increase is so pro
nounced, in fact, the management will
at once deepen the shaft to t.he 10i0
foot point, where if is probable thii
zone of primary copper enrichment
will be entered. A considerable por
tion of the expense attaching to de
velopment of the property at a depth
og 1000 feet will be met by the t?duc
tion of a generous tonnage of the
gold-silver ori s in the company's mill.
Crown King Comes Back.
About 100 tons of iron concentrates
and a like tonnage of zinc concen
trates go out each month from the
plant of the Randolp.'i-Gemmill De
velopment company at Crown King.
The iron is shipped to the smelter at
Humboldt and the zinc to Oklahoma
and Kansas smelting points. These
concentrates are reclaimed from
Crown King mine ores and are
"sweetened" with a little high grade
gold ore from the Wildflower mine.
Both of the properties- mentioned are
being operated by the Randolph-Gemmill
company. " Frank S. Veile. of
New York City and Prescott, is a dom
inant factor in the company's afi'airs.
Mr. Veile is also interested in the
Arizona Binghamton Copper company.
The company's Binghamton mine near
Mayer is being developed into o.ie of
the big copper propositions of Yavapai!
county.
The production of copper matte i
from the Binghamton for the month
of May totaled 280,000 pounds. It wasl
reclaimed from ores mined during the I
ordinary course of development workj
and reduced in the company's 100-ton!
mill. This ore sampled an average of
6 per cent copper at the "heads." I)ur-
ing the month of June Mine Superin
tendent (Vhaney started seven stopes
in the three ore bodies being developed
on the several levels to a depth of 500
feet. Some of this ore is breaking an
average of 22 per cent copper per
ton. The production of mine and mi'.l
will be considerably higher for Juii"
than for May. The mine is rapidly
approaching a stae of development,
which will place it in the dividend-1
paying division headed by the famous!
I'nited Verde and L'ie equally famous'
United Verde Kx'ension mine. Gen
eral ManagLT G. W. Johnson expects
to have the property on a profit basis
within sixty days.

XEW YORK. June 30. Mrs. Helen'
Kelly Gould Thomas, formerly wife '
of Frank Gould, whom she divorced,'
and then the wife and widow of Ralph
M. Thomas, has become the bride of
an Albanian prince. His name is
Piince Ylora, she met him in Switzer
land last December and they were mar
ried quite recently In Tarls.
Mrs. Helen Kelly Gould Thomas is
in her early thirties. There was fin

and it is perfectly natural that every
one will want a new dress. A very
charming nfodel is shown in a one-
piece dress. A plain and figured voile
makes a good combination in the long
waisted effect, the skirt made from
the figured material and the waist of
the plain wtih bias trimmings of Hie
figured material. The large collar and
long soft full sleeves would add much
to the dress.
Every one planning on her vacation
looks forward to the fine dips she
is going to enjoy through the hot sum
nior days is wondering just what Is
the best and newest bathing suit. The
one that is showing the most popular-
ty this season is of almost Quakerish
simplicity. The skirt is much longer,
and the bodice higher, than in many
years. The most charming feature is
the belt of bright-t'olored ribbon with
a large beau. Xot alone do we need
the bathing suit but some kind of a
wrap and the long-hooded cape is used,
reminding one of Little Red Riding
Hood.
Dame Fashion points us to the line
of shoes our local st'jres are display
ing. One of the newest models is a
p&leut leather boot with the late filet
late tops. Xothing can look more
summery with our wool and silk Jer
sey suits. The pearl white boot Is
holding its place as the summer ad
vances .as is the two-t'jlor combina
tion.
These warm days why not take the
second thought of baby's feet? In
stead of the hot slippers and shoes,
make him some embroidered on fine
linen. They are cool and the baby
will not know he has anything on his
feet.

made accordingly is very good.
Every boy likes balloons and likes to
run with them. When sonny starts
out to take his place in the first bal
loon race a dress of red and white ging
ham, checked, is enough to satisfy all
his desires. The dress coat trimmed
in plain white and piped with the
checked material makes a neat boyish
trimniin-;. The knickerbockers shViuld
be made separate.
The hot weather surely makes us
scoot out our Panamas and large leg
horns; and if e haven't one, why not
take a look at them at our local stores,
which have an extra lari;e assortment?

Kelly and the Gould interests and
there was also a religious difference
between the families. So the an
nouncement of the engagement of
Frank Jay Gould and Miss Helen
Kelly was not received enthusiastical
ly. She was only seventeen and he
was many years her senior when they
were married in 190t. There are two
children of the marriage, Helen and
Dorothy Gould. Whether they a
companied their mother to Europe, or
are with Mrs. Helen Gould Shepard,
their aunt, can not be learned.
For a time after the Gould-Kelly
marriage the families appeared to be
friendly. But there came quarrels
and Mrs. Edward Kelly found herself
barred from the Gould home. It was
said young Gould had found her an un
duly severe mother-in-law. But a few
months after that young Mrs. Gould
and her mother were seen often to
gether. Gould and his wife separated
several times for brief periods. She
sued in 1908 for legal separation.
He retaliated by having her watch
ed by detectives. That so angered
her she withdrew the separation nad
sued for absolute divorce, naming an
actress. Rose Einter. The divorce
was granted in 1909. She received
$10S,000 in lieu of dower rights and
$40,000 a year alimony.
A year later she became the wife
of Ralph Hill Thomas, nephew of
Washington B. Thomas wealthy sugar
refiner. Young Thomas was In the
sugar trade and was wealthy. The
wedding took place in Mrs. Gould's
apartments, Xo. 540 Park avenue, July
11. 1910. Her mother and sister and
Mr. Thomas' brother. John attended,

couple took a honeymoon trip around

thing to protect your hair while
sweeping.
There is not a prettier suit, and
none that would satisfy the small boy
as much, as a suit made of white and
dark blue linen, because it is like
daddy wears. The waist, made of
white linen with small blue cellar and
smocking to match, and the straight
trousers of blue fastening on to the
waist with large white buttons makes
it handy In that you can laundry the
waist separately.

Xegligees are receiving special at

are the most important part of a

choice negligee this summer the trend
of taste is strictly toward harem ap

crepe de chine and ruffles of georgette
crepe in light shades make a very
pretty combination. The camisole
can be made very pretty by bindings
of rich satin ribbon.

"That was one swell affair," is the
usual expression of every fellow who
attended the membership Get-together
and Banquet last Wednesday evening,
and the most surprising thin tf all
was that every chair waa occupied, and
this, too, when local conditions were
at fever heat and the weather, too.
Which goes to augment the fact that
men are real humans after all, and in
the long run differences of opinion are
not so great a factor. The hundreds
of principles that men "agree on are
far more essential.

Infantry Bears Brunt In Trench Fighting;
No Place for Cavalry; How Division Is Aligned
If after American troops take their
places in the battle-line in France and
Belgium trench fighting is to be their
lot at first, they will soon learn how
essential all arms of the military ser
vice are Tor the proper protection of a
ector of territory. A study of the;
accompanying diagram will give an
idea of this.
Everything is subordinate to the In
fantryman, who leaps forward and ad
vances on the enemy when he hears
the whistle of his company command
er. He makes it possible for artil
lery to be moved up for he digs in, at
bis new position, which is advanced
as far as he ran go. and thus the fight
goes on. Military men are agreed that
these tactics must be followed until
the enemy's armies are broken.
What A Division Is.
The infantry of a division is made
up of three brigades each of three
regiments. American regiments now
have 2,015 officers and men when re
cruited up to war strength. The
supporting troops in the division bring
up the total number of men in the
fighting force to 2S.324. A complete
division comprises the following sup
porting units to the infantry brigades:
Two regiments of field artillery,
each made up of six batteries; . one
regiment of heavy field artillery, and
under the most recent orders, an addi
tional regiment of siege artillery of
the heaviest calibre for certain pick
ed divisions; one regiment of engi
neers road and bridge builders and
trench makers a signal corps with its
telegraph, telephone and aviation
sections; the santitary corps, quarter
master's corps and the staff depart
ments necessary to assist the major
general commanding in his adminis
trative work. Two additional machine
gun companies are attached, by recent
orders to the division headquarters
and one each to the three brigade
headquarters. The division has its
field bakery, supply train of wagons,
its hospitals and ambulance compan
ies. The signal corps must maintain
communication between bridage and
division headquarters and run wires j
to the first line trenches. Command
ers of the field armies or army corps, )
see that communications are kept up j
with division headquarters. Aviators j
of the division report how shells are ;
falling within the enemy lines and j
give puick news of any movements to
show a contemplated advance or re- j
treat. They must be prepared to fight j
enemy aviators too. but the work of 1
gaining air superiority will fall main-

How Infantry Move Up.
The regiment of engineers is kept
busy repairing trenches and lines of
communication from division head
quarters to the fighting units and as
sisting the infantry in digging new
trenches. The cavalry, in trench
fighting, is useless unless sent forward
to- the trenches, where it acts as in
fantry. The actual fighting men the in
fantrymen must not be kept in the
front line trench until texterminated.
Twenty-four hours is as much as com
manders expect a man in the fire and
first-line cover trenches. They must
be constantly alert when on that shift
and at the same time be careful of
their own artillery, which is stationed
in their rear and shoots over their
heads. Premature explosions are al
ways expected.
The nearest supporting artillery
excepting the machine gun nests and
trench mortars, which are in the first
line trenches consists of light field
pieces in the second line. These have
effective ranges of from three to five
miles, but cannot be trained upon first
line trenches of the enemy, for the lat
ter are too near their own fire trench
es. It Is generally used for objects
one or two miles distant.
Next, in the third line trench, is the
heavy ordinance. This can shoot
seven or eight miles, but is more ef
fective at four. Both classes of bat
teries are used to make "curtains" to
prevent supporting forces reaching the
first line trenches of the enemy. Far
in rear are the monster siege guns,
which can shoot ten, fifteen, or nine
teen miles. Artillerymen take turns
with their batteries resting in can
tonments and then working.
Let us "move up" with a regiment
of infantry.
First To the Fourth Line.
The first move, after the regiment is
detailed to go forward, is to the fourth

CENTRAL THEATRE BLDC.
LOWELL, ARIZONA
We have a rental battery for your ute when your need repair or recharging
line. It was in cantonments beyond
range of the enemy's greatest guns,
and as it proceeds toward the front it
needs no shelter.
It goes first to the brigade reserve of
three regiments, which are kept in
well protected positions. The biggest
guns of the enemy frequently "feel
out" the locations of reserve regi
ments. They are safe, however, from
artillery and from refle fire, and the
anti-aircraft guns keep the aeroplanes
away from the batteries and camps.
For three days the regiment Is held
in brigade reserve. The night follow
ing it advances via the "bad roads,"
that are frequently shelled, to the third
line trenches. For 24 hours the regi
ment remains in dugouts upon this
line, ready to repulse any sweep of
the enemy that might, by chance, over
power the more advanced trenches.
The next move is to the second line
positions. While dting the 24-hour
tour in these, details are .sent forward
to repair wire entanglements and act
as patrols in No Man's Land the lat
ter mark the most dangerous for the
soldier in trench warfare.
Then comes the forward move to the
cover trenches of the first line. Com
munication trenches are hugged while
this advance is made. Ftr the next
24 hours the soldiers spend two hours
in the fire trench and four In reserve,
under cover. If an attack is made, the
two battalions held ever ready in the
ocver trenches rush forward to the fire
trench to halt the drive.
When advances are to be made, the
brigade reserve is pushed forward in
the night, and after the artillery com
manders believe they have battered po
sitions in the rear f the enemy's first
line sufficiently, and that a curtain of
shells prevents reinforcements from
coming up, the whistle blows and the
men leap out of their trenches. Wave
on wave they rush forward. If the in
fantrymen in the fourth and fifth
waves sees that the others "went into
the blue," as they express it. they must
go forward anyway, or suffer the pun
ishment for disobedience of orders.

carried a number of men to and from
the mines and it was made evident
thatall who wished transportation and
its attendant assurance of complete
protection from any annoyance, could
have it.
The mass meeting to have been held
at tfle city park by the I. W. W. last
night failed of materialization. The
rain came up and no one went to the
park. Crowds in the streets aDd in
the stores and theatres were typical
of the normal Saturday night.
The abundant steps taken for pro
tection have been demonstrated to
"have been wise, through the fact that
tendency to disorder has disappeared.
It is undoubtedly true that those 'of
the agitators who had considered that
Bisbee and the Warren district might
be terrorized, have changed their
minds and are in no mood to take
any chances with the constituted authorities.
Issue la Important. -
The other phase which has had a
large part in the change that has come
about is found in the stronger realiza
tion which is expressed of the fact
that patriotism, loyalty to the govern
ment in its hour of need of the highest
efficiency of the people, is really a big
issue at this time all over the coun
try. Men who think the situation over
from this viewpoint do not delay long
in reaching the decision that tpey are
in the wrong boat unless lined up with
the men who are at work.
Bread Lines Forming.
Several hundred Mexicans yesterday
mornin gappeared on the streets and
demanded sustenance frfom the I. W.
W. organization. The Los Angeles
Grocery, an establishment on Brewery
Gulch, supplied their wants during the
afternoon. Flour, beans and other
bare essentials were given to the
Mexicans.
Improved Feeling.
As a result of the rair attitude of
the business men of the Warren Dis
trict, a large number jf men is expect
ed to report at one shaft today. A
committee representing the Citizens'
Protective league called on the pro
prietor of a boarding house in the
district She was complimented for
her determination to continue to serve
meals and prepare lunches for the men
who were willing to work. The wom
an was assured that she could expect
the moral and financial support of the
C. P. L. She was also assured that
should any one or eny organization at
tempt to harm her, in any Way, she
could expect protection from the
league.
Action Is Approved.
After the committee called, seven
men, who are not working, appeared
at the house of the bon:-ding house
keeper and asked v;M the previous
callers were. They were told that it
was a committee of business men.
"I suppose they demanded that you
throw us out?" was the question of
one.
No, they merely told me that they
were behind my eftorts to supply my
customers who work in the mines and
would protect me at all costs," an
swered the woman.
Yesterday afternoon the same men
and ten others came to the boarding
house and announced they would want
lunches for this moinring. They are
going to work.
"If the business men are as fair as
that and as determined to see that jus
tice is done, we will go back to work. I

The debarkation of the Ameri

old story to this French town, and
interest of th einhabitants has
centered all day around the com

moderate sized crowds have been

Minimum Of Disorder
At Americans' Camp.
Their activities occupied all of
yesterday and last night. Many
of the inhabitants watched in
wondering fashion the marching
and countermarching as if to ques
tion whether the French or 'the
Americans owned the town.
The preparations for the com
pletion of the camp are proceeding
rapidly and were so far advanced
this morning that the troops were
comfortable notwithstanding the
rain. General Pershing expressed
his satisfaction with the condi
tions and the soldiers say they are
delighted with the camp which
stands on high ground. Although
drinking water must be brought
from a considerable distance it is
of excellent quality.
The sudden influx of the Ameri
can forces has almost exhausted
the town's stock of supplies, such
as tobacco, matches and other
articles not in the army ration and
prices are gradually rising. The
all necessities, however, are
abundently present
Notwithstanding the concentra
tion here of thousands of soldiers,
sailors and marines, there has
been a minimum of disorder and
the strangers from overseas are
proving more welcome to the
townsfolks every hour.

All Choked Up With Catarrh?
Why Continue Makeshift Treatment?
Sprays and douches will never
core you.
" Catarrh is annoying enough when
it chokes up your nostrils and air
passages, causing1 painful and diffi
cult breathing and other discomforts.
But the real danger comes when it
reaches down into your lungs.
This is why yon should at once
realize the importance of the proper
treatment, and lose no time ex
perimenting with worthless remedies
which touch only the surface. To be
rid of Catarrh, you must drive the '
disease germs out of your blood.
Splendid results have been re
ported from the use of S. S. S., which
completely routs from your blood the
Catarrh grms, for which it is a per
fect antidote.
S. S. S. is sold by all druggists.
If you wish medical advice as to the
treatment of your own individual
case, write to-day to Chief Medical
Adviser, Swift Specific Co., Dept. B

BY REVIEW
- (By Review Leased Wire.)
NE WORK. June 30. Considering
widespread interest ;n the freight rate
situation it was the general opinion
that today's short session demonstrat
ed the stock market's sound condition.
Refusal yesterday of the fifteen per
cent increase asked .by the railroads
resulted in extreme losses of 2 to 5
points in most of the more Important
railway shares St. Paul being the chief
sufferer. Coalers, transcontinentals,
trunk lines and low priced issues
which had most to gain by favorable
action, reached on to Z1 points.
' Industrials, equipments and many
unclassified stocks were carried down
1-to 2 points in the early movement,
but recovered with surprising ease,
carrying the entire list, with them.
Features of especial strength were
Crucible, Lackawanna, Bethlehem and
Midvale Steels, and. Colorade Fuel,
Great Northern Ore and Republic
Iron at advances of more than 3 points
United States Steel made a net gain
of half a point. Total sales, 400,000
shares.
The bond market was Irregular on
small offerings. Total sales, par val
ue, $1,360,000. Liberty bonds ranged
from par to a slight premtmum on act
ual sales during the week, but other
United States Issues were lower by
fractions to almost three per cent on
call.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. June 30 Urgent demand
for com for immediate delivery
brought about the highest prices ever
reached in the corn market here, num
ber two yellow, a regular contract
grade commanding $1.76 a bushel. Thqf
market closed unsettled at gains of
to l4. Wheat showed an advance of
half to one cent net, with July at 2.02
and Sentember at 1.82. Oats finished
iz. in 54 higher In nrnvisiona the
nutrnmo ranged from 25 decline to a
rise of five cents.
Influential traders in corn appeared
to be much impressed by scarcity of
corn available for ready shipment.
High temperatures in Kansas and Ne
braska together with fears of scroch
ing winds, there tended further to in
crease bullish sentiment. Wheat and
oats hardened in sympathy with corn.
Wheat bears had an advantage in the
early trading though on account of
announcements that the first new
wheat this season had arrived at the
Atlantic seaboard ready for shipment
to Europe.
Considerable apprehension for the
safety of oats resulted from word of
high temperatures In prospect.
Provisions declined owing to con
tinued slowness of cash demand and
to further weakness In the hog mar

A New York dispatch reports that
Republic Steel has received an order
for 80,000 tons of steel to be used In
making shrapnel shells at a price of
$75 per ton, creating the belief that
the government price fixing on its
steel needs, will not be as low as an
ticipated. This wu responsible for the
the broadening demand for steel
shares during the last hour.

REVISION OF TAX
BILL COMPLETED BY
SENATECOMMITTEE
(Continued FTom Page One)
cent according to the proportion of
excess.
The committee also changed the
plan of collecting income taxes from
that of "collection at the source" to
"Information at the source" to ac
complish direct payment. A compari
son of the estimated revenue to be
gained from other sources under the
revised bill and the house bill, re
spectively, follows:
Liquors $155,000,000 asfoinst $151,
000,000; tobacco, $56,600,000 against
$68,200,000; freight transportation.
$77,500,000 unchanged; passenger
transportation $37,500,000 against $75.
000,000; automobiles $40,000,000
against $68,000,000 (payable under the
revised bill by pleasure ear owners
and not manufactures); and first mails
$5,000,000 against $7,000,000 (by re
taining the one cent increase for first
class mail and striking out the in
crease upon postcards.)
Import Tariff Cut Out.
House levies of five per cent upon
gross sales of many manufacturers
were stricken out entirely and taxes
on patent medicines, perfumery, cos
metics, Pullman accommodations, and
soft drinks greatly reduced.
Believing a compromise on prohi
bition legislation will not stop con
sumption and revenue yielded from
distilled spirits, teer or wines, the
committee made little change in the
house liquor taxes.
The committee struck out entirely
the bouse 10 per cent general tariff
tax upon virtually all imports, esti
mated to raise $200,000,000. It substi
tuted consumption taxes totalling $86,
000, 000 and bearing more directly up
on consumers, of half a cent a pound
on sugar, 2 cents on coffee, 5 cents
on tea and three cents on cocoa and
substitutes. .
All Spanish war stamp taxes would
be virtually re-imposed under the bill
the committee adding a new tax of
one cent each on bank checks over $5.
Other Tax Changes.
Other changes In the revised bill
include a prohibitive tax to stop man
ufacture of distilled beverages, while
taxes on other intoxicants are virtual
ly doubled; elimination of house taxes
of $6,000,000 on inheritances and $108.
000,000 retroactive taxes upon 1916 in
comes; repeal of the "drawback" re
export allowance given sugar refiners:
extension to parcel past packages of
a tax of one cent for each 25 cents
paid for express transportation; elim
ination of house taxes on consumers
electric light, power and gas bills, all
insurance, jewelry, club dues, tires and
tfibes, musical instruments, motion

ANTI-AMERICAN TALK
. BY DANISH MINISTER
RESULTS IN PROTEST
United States Representative
At Copenhagen Demands
Explanation o f Attitude
Taken By Cabinet Member.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, June 30. The American
minister at Copenhagen, Dr. Maurice
Egan, has presented a protest to the
Danish foreign office against the anti
American utterances of M. Stauning,
socialist member of the Danish cabi
net, at the peace deliberations re
cently held at Stockholm, according
to reliable information reaching Lon
don. Early In June the conservatives de
manded that M. Stauning withdraw
from the cabinet, but Premier Zeahler
refused to accede to the demand at
that time. It was then asserted that
M. Stauning's participation in the
Stockholm conference was Inconsist
ent with the determination of Scan
dinavian government to observe strict
neutrality.
The socialist members of the parli
amentary caucuses Immediately ap
proved M. Stauning's activity but the
conservatives still continue their
strong opposition.
Minister Egan, In his protest, main
tained that the United States govern
ment was the last In the world to de
sire to interfere with the freedom of
speech but that M. Stauning's position
as a responsible government minister
necessitates protest.
The non-socialist parties and news
papers criticize M. Stauning's activi
ties as inconsistent with Danish neu
trality. The matter was brought to
head by an interview with M. Staun
ing published by the Berlin Tageblatt,
in which he was quoted as condemning
America's participation in the war as
a capitalist venture which made peace
more remote instead of advancing it.

notice of same and see that work

Union Calls Strike.
GLOBE, June 30. That nearly 7.000
miners employed by the three big op
erating companies in the Globe-Miami
district would be called out on strike
Monday morning at 7 o'clock appears
certain, according to the statement of
Secretary P. W. Barnes of the Miami
local of the International Union of
Mill, Mine and Smelter Workers, this
evening.
Thirty minutes after the polls closed
for the strike vote Barnes Issued the
statement that very few 'no' votes were
recorded which, in his opinion fore
casted a strike of "an almost unani
mous vote." Secretary George D.
Smith announced that no votes had
been counted for the Globe local up to
10 o'clock but reports from miners'
union hall asserted that victory for the
striking element seemed certain.
More than 1100 votes were cast In
Globe while 861 ballots were dropped
in the voting boxes In Miami.
General Manager P. G. Beckett, of
the Old Dominion Company, in Globe,
refused to make a statement this even
ing asserting that he would await the
action of the miners before announc
ing the attitude of the company in re
gard to the strike which, early to
night, appears inevitable.
BRIGGS MINERS TO MEET
It was announced on the streets last
evening that the miners of the Brlggs

The meeting is called for 7 o'clock, it
