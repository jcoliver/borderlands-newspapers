ARREST AT EASTLAND; ROBBERY
AND
ASSAULT TO
Now in Custody, With Ola Mathews Is
6 Apprhended After Vicious Attack on
W. H. Carter $1,200 Stolen From Man
Who is Then Left and Thought Dead
Crouch Well Known In Bisbee Police Circles; Was in
Bisbee Two Months Ago; Arrested by El Paso Police at
Wrestling Match Being Put on in That City Recently
Charles Irwin Crouch, who was
born and raised In. Bisbee, is under
arrest in Eastland, Texas, on a
charge of robbery and assault to mur
der. He was arrested in El Paso
with a woman who gave her name as
Ola Mathews, alias Helen Dean, and
was taken back to Eastland on Mon
day. They are charged with attack
ing and robbing a man named W. H.
Carter, of tje sum of $1200 on the 16th
of June this year.
Crouch is well known in the War
ren district, he has been in the police
court a number of times for fight
ing and other charges and several
years ago to save himself from going
to the penitentiary on a charge of
pandring he was allowed to marry a
young girl of the Warren District.
He lived with her only a short time
nad wffliiredia divorce and wa then
married to a young lady by the name
of Maud Krump of Nace, Mrs.
Crouch Is at present living at Low
ell.' Crouch has not been In the Warren
District much for. the past two years,
he was in the navy, came back here
and stayed a feiv months, and left
for the Texas oil fields about two
months ago.
The local police were notified by
wire several days ago to hold Crouch
and his female ;accomplice if they ap
peared in Bisbee and to notify Sher
iff II. E.. Lawrence of Eastland, Texas.
The ' police also were asked to
hold all money found on Crouch in
the event he was picked up. .
The Ranger Times of Saturday, July
5th,- has the following to say about
the case:
"Six hours of gruelling cross-questioning,
wearing down the patience of
officers and prisoner six hours of
denial and refutation and conflicting
statements then John R. Rayburn,
youthful oil field worker, broke down
at police headquarters last night and
told the officers what they wanted
to know. The signed confession to
the ' part the police believe he took
in-the vicious attack on W. H. Carter,
who was cruelly beaten up and robbed
or $1,200 on June 16, is in the hands
of the police.
"Irwin Crouch, 22 years old, and
Helen Dean, other member of the trio
who are charged with the robbery are
under arrest in El Paso and local
officers are on their way from . the
border city with the pair.
"Facing a blank wall in the way of
evidence pointing toward the identity
of the alleged highway trio. Chief ot
Police O. G. Flournoy's officers fol
lowed what meager clues were left
and constructed a chain of. evidence
the story of which reads like a: page
torn from the Tip Top "Weekly.
"Carter, the -victim of the robbery,
from the day that he staggered into
police headquarters, aided by Bob Dal
ton, to whose hotel he came, bruised
and bleeding from the attack, up to
the moment of Rayburn's arrest Fri
day evening, gave the officers little
help. They mutt be given credit for
persistent work in the face of the
big difficulties.
"Carter boasts of Sioux Indian
blood in his veins. The woman In the
affair formerly was his sweetheart,
the police say. He chose the In
dian's idea of Justice and would have
kept to himself what he knew of the
robbery, after he had recovered con
sciousness and was able to talk
"Two hours and more of question
ing at the Ranger hospital, were nec
essary to elicit from Carter what little
he would tell. He had met Crouch
on the day of his arrival. He had
been invited to the shack with Crouch
and the Dean woman for supper, and
there met a lad they called "Slim."
He knew no other name for this man.
It was Rayburn, officer Haynle states.
Carter had never seen Crouch before
that day and knew him only as a
drinking companion, the officers say.
"Horribly beaten up, he recovered
consciousness early next morning on
the floor of an abandoned oil derrick
near Ranger and grouped his way to
the Dalton hotel.
"Carter at the Ranger hospital
1
MURDER CRARGED
stubbornly maintained silence. Indian
fashion he wanted to take his own
vengeance; He wanted his money
back which he had intended to invest
in a small refreshment stand in Ran
ger, but he was unwilling to give the
police fi.ny help.
"You're the only man who ever
made me talk," he confessed to offi
cer Haynie, when he at last gave
way before the officer's questions.
"With what little they learned from
him, the officers learned that Crouch,
alleged to be the leader in the robbery
was a wrestler, and had been active in
Bisbee, Ariz., and in California and in
El Paso. By telegraph, they threw
the dragnet out.
"Not a night passed but that some
progress was made on the case, little
enough to. be discouraged many times,
and real steps toward a solution of
the problem, at. others. Their efforts
some days seemed only a destruction
of what had been built up the day
before.
"They were constantly on the watch j
for Rayburn. They were confident
that he would return to Ranger. He
was only a tool in the hands of the
older man, is the police theory, and
would return to the oil field for work.
And he did.
"I got a new suit of clothes, a pair
of shoes and my fare to El Paso and
$30. That's all Crouch would give
me," Rayburn told a repprter for the
Daily Times this morning.
"A newspaper dispatch led to
Crouch's arrest. Just a little item on
the sport page, saying that a wrestler
without a title challenged the winner
of a match in El Paso. Telegraph
wires hummed with Instructions to El
Paso police. The unknown wrestlei
was arrested and the woman with
whom he had been living was taken
also. It was the pair that the Ranger
officers sought.
"Rayburn returned to Ranger the
afternoon of July 4, arriving at two
o'clock. He was arrested three hours
later, by officers Haynle, Peavy, Par-
rish and Moore.
"Rayburn took no part in the rob.
bery Itself, he told ' a reporter this
morning .
"I was outside the shack, when I
heard Crouch and Carter fighting. I
looked in the window and Crouch had
thrown Carter on the bed. He ,told
him to "shut up."
" "Carter was washing a roll of
bills. They had fallen in a pool of
oil on the floor. He washed and dried
them. Carter laid on the bed until an
early hour next morning. Then . he
got up and ran Helen Dean out of
the ; room. '
I heard her scream," the confes
sion continued.' "And ran around to
the other door. I caught up with Car
ter Just as be ran 'into a wire fence.
He hit at me and. I hit him. Crouch
struck him at the same time. I used
my fists. Crouch had no weapon that
I know of.
" "Afterwards we loaded him into a
car and carried him to an oil derrick
north of town .and left him there. We
drove to Eastland that afternoon and
from there went to El Paso.
"There was not a place as-big as
man's finger on Carter's body , that
was not bruised, cut or skinned, ac
cording to the police. Officer Haynie
said he had never seen a man more
cruelly beaten up.
"Of the loot, the Dean woman got
$300, according to Rayburn.
"His share was only the cheap suit
and shoes he -wore when arrested,
fare to El Paso, and $30; he says he
didn't ask for any more.
Rayburn is barely of age. His home
is in Pallinger. His widowed mother
lives there he said."

N SON
WILL
E
CONGRESS TO
WASHINGTON, July 9 President Wil
son will present the peace treaty and the
League of Nations covenant to the sen
ate tomorrow .
The president will deliver a lengthy ad
dress in which he Is expected to outline
the details of the negotiations recently
concluded In Paris and tell why he feels
that the United States should endorse
the League of Nations covenant. His ad
dress promises to mark the opening -of
one of the bitterest fights ever waged in
the senate over ratification of a treaty.
It was announced at the White House
today that the president would place
himself unreservedly at the disposal of
the senate in its consideration of the
treaty. He wag represented a? being
"anxious" to appear before any commit
tee of the senate or of the house, or
both. In open or executive session to
answer any questions that members
might desire to ask with regard to the
treaty and the league covenant.
There is little likelihood that the com
mittee will begin work on the treaty be
fore Monday, although it will receive the
document as soon as It is submitted by
the president. There are many maps at
tached, and it is not expected that copies
for the committee members can be made
at the government printing office before
the end of the week.
The senate plans to adjourn until Mon
day as soon as it has heard the presi
dent's address and has referred the
treaty to committee and ordered it print
ed. Several senators will be ready to
speak on the subject the first of the
week, however, and the debate Is expect
ed to be virtually continuous until the
ratification vote is taken, perhaps many
weeks hence.
Although there has been little discus
sion regarding the new treaty with
France, by which the nation would be
promised American aid in case of an un
provoked attack by Germany, the general
expectation is that it also will be pre
sented by the president tomorrow and
will take the same course as the treaty
with Germany.
The president will not leave for the
capltol before noon. He is to speak 15
minutes later.
The house will not be in session while
the president is speaking, having agreed
today to meet at 2 p. m., so members
can be in the senate to hear the chief
executive.
While members of the senate foreign
relations committee declined to predict
whether the president would be invited
before the committee, there was a gen
eral feeling that should he make known
directly a desire to appear, he would be
given the opportunity. The usual pro
cedure would be for the committee to ask
for the diplomatic correspondence leading
up to the treaty, and since most of the
Versailles negotiations were conducted
orally, some senators believe the alter
nate course would be to question the
principal delegates.
Opposing this view, however, if the
feeling of some committee members that
it would be too wide a departure from
precedent to Invite a president before any
committee of congress. It has been point
ed put that the chief executive consti
tutes in himself a co-ordinate branch of
the government, and as such never has
dealt directly with Buch a subordinate
body as a senate committee.
Should the president go before the com
mittee, there are Indications, the session
will be open. " Some members are known
to ; be determinedly opposed to any secrecy-
in senate consideration of the
treaty, and in this stand they expect the
co-operation of the president and his
supporters on Jhe committee. The effect
may be to throw into the open the entire
committee consideration of the treaty aa
well as the debate in the senate chamber.
It is considered more than likely, how
ever, that at least some of the committee
discussions . will be in executive, ses
sions. .."..
A vigorous questioning undoubtedly
will await the president should he ap
pear before the committee. Among the
members 'are some of the moBt bitter
critics of the League of Nations, includ
ing ChRlrman Lodge and Senators Borah
of Idaho, Johnson of California, and Fall
of New Mexico, all Republicans.
The president's first day at the White
House since he returned from France
was a long and busy one. After sleep
ing late he went to his desk soon after 9
o'clock and remained almost uninterrupt
edly at work. Bills carrying with them
appropriations of more than two billion
dollars were, before him. but he appar
ently was unable to find time to consider
them. .
The president still was working in his
study late tonight and .was said to be
literally elbow deep in: papers.
So busy was the president that nut a
single caller was recerved. A number of
senators visited the White House and
talked with Secretary Tumulty So far
as could be ascertained the president did
not communicate in any way with mem
bers of the foreign relations committee.

Here's What it Cost
Us to Beat the Huns
WASHINGTON. July 9. The war cost
to the United States was $30,177,000,000
up to June 30, 1919.
Secretary Glass made this estimate to
day in submitting to the congressional
appropriations committees the prelimin
ary statements of the treasury on the
condition of the nation's finances. He
arrived, at the estimate by subtracting
that average peace time expenses for
the same length of time, at the rate of
$1,000,000,000 annually, from the total ex
penditures; $32,427,000,000 during the
war. ' : '
Taxes and other revenues than liorrow
ed money took care of $9,384,000,000 or
about 29 per cent of the war cost; The
remainder came from Liberty bonds and
Victory note issues and saving stamps.
Further issues of bonds, Mr. Glass
said. :will not be necessary, "before
the maturity or redemption of the
Victory notes," which, have four years
to run. While it. is impossible to esti
mate the expenses to be incurred dur
ing the present fiscal year, the secre
tary is confident that treasury certifi
cates supplemented by short term
notes will provide the necessary funds
to pay the government's debts.
"I need scarcely to Bay," the secre
tary added, "that the realization of
these sanguine expectations is contin
gent upon the practice of the most
rigid economy by the government and
the continuance of ample revenues
from taxation. Such, a course will be
accompanied by the practice of sober
ecenomy and wise investment by our
people and strict avoidance of waste
and speculation, will make it possible
for the American people to respond to
the demands to be made upon them
privately for capital and credit by the
nations of Europe demands which
are reinforced by the strongest and
most vital ties of sympathy for the
allies, who fought and won the war
with us as well as by the most ob
vious dictates of self-interest."

ish dirigible R-34 will leave Roosevelt
Field on her return flight -to Scotland
between 1 land 12 o'clock tonight, ac
cording to an announcement by Major
H. C. Fuller, representative of the
British air ministry.
favoraDie weatner conmtions were
reported over the entire route save for
one bad spot in mid-Atlantic.
The big gasbag has been repaired
and filled with hydrogen and the en
gines are in excellent condition and
ready for instant business. Forty
pounds of official mail .is stowed
aboard, including two gold medals of
the Aero Club of America, awarded to
Captain Alcock and Lieutenant Brown

Press tonight, Major G. H. Scott, com
mander of the dirrigible, declared he
would fly over New York, and if fav-
crable winds on the other side offered,
over London on his homeward journey
to East Fortune, Scotland.
"I am going to follow the line of the
southern steamships course," he said,
"passing over New York before start
ing overseas. If the present weather
conditions continue I expect to make
the homeward trip in seventy hours';
"The only thing I am sorry about is
that I have to leave here so soon. Un
fortunately I had only one night in
New York, and would have liked to
have many more. I hope to come
again. I'd like to take this opportunity
to say that if any American comes to
our country I .hope I can repay the hos
pitality thejr have so lavishly bestowed
upon me.
"The climatic conditions over the
Atlantic are very bad for flying in
ships like the . R-34. Although the
R-34 has more than justified our
hopes, transAtlantic flying in the fu
ture must be done in larger and faster
ships."
M1NEOLA, N. Y., July 9. The Brit
ish dirigible R-34 left Roosevelt Field
shortly before midnight on her return
cruise to Scotland.
The great ship held in leash by
1000 American balloon men, was re

leisurely up to a height of 200 feet
with her motors silent. The motors
then began to whirr and the craft.
nosing upward, headed for New York.
Three great searchlights playing on
the ship made her clearly discernible
to the thousands who had gathered
to bid her bon voyage. With three
engines port, starboard and forward
running, and two others in reserve
the R-34 glided off toward the south,
then swinging in a westerly course
bringing her nose in the direction of
New York.
' It took the R-34 about three minutes
to rise to the height at which she be
gan cruising. At 11:59 fche was about

only the three engines on which she
started unless unexpected conditions
arose.
With favorable conditions Major H.
S. Scott, her commander, hopes to
make the voyage in seventy hours,
sailing over London before proceed
ing to East Fortune, Scotland, if
weather conditions permit. The great
ship presented a beautiful picture as
she drifted up into the sky bathed
in the white light of three powerful
searchlights. Just as she nosed out
of Roosevelt Field the moon appeared
from behind black clouds, partially
lighting up the dark field.
At 12:01 lights along the deck of
the dirigible were switched on and the
great ship herself appeared a long
streak' of light syimming in the rad
lance of the searchlights.
Up to 12:01 the R-34 had drifted
sideways in the current of a south
west wind. At this hour she nosed
into the wind, now sailing at about
9C0 feet, and one minute later disap
peared from the view of the crowds
at Roosevelt Field.
It was just 11:50 o'clock when a bell
rang aboard the R-34, signalling that
the hour of departure was at hand.
An officer on the ground with a mega
phone yelled: "All clear."
Major Scott, leaning out of the port
window forward cried, "Cast off."

The Vigor of
Swift & Company Continues
Only Because of Service
The only "control" over the packing
industry is the "control" that gathers
about the ability to do a necessary job in
the best way.
Swift & Company has reached a lead
ing place in the industry because the
size and character of the job of providing
a nation's meat require the wide and
thorough organization, the experience
and devotion to duty, found in an institu
tion like Swift & Company.
The moment Swift & Company ceases
to perform its functions of usefulness with
the greatest efficiency and satisfaction to
the people, its position in the industry
will vanish.
Swift & Company service is performed
at a profit of a fraction of a cent per pound.

'JUVENILE COURT
liSESSIO
- Yesterday was juvenile day in the jui
jxrior court at Tombstone, when Judne
Lockwood disposed of a number of cases
pending: in that branch of tiie court.
Patrlvlo Merentrs, the Mexican hoy
who shot and killed Johnny Gould at
Bowie,' some time ako, following a hear
ing was committed to the industrial
school at Kt. Grant. Judge Lockwood
InvestlKatcd the case thorounhly, a larpe
number of witnesses having Ix-en called
her. Following the hearing, the judjre
was of the opinion ihut Merentej, while
a sort of bully, did not intend to kill the
Gould boy, hut believed he could scare
him by pointing the pun at him. Sentence
to the reform school was the only way
his cose could Iks disposed of.
The next case was that of another
Mexican loy, Uugc-nlo Martinez, who
Nas charged with a similar offense, al
though In this case the boy who was
shot did not die, but was here to tell the
story. The gist of the ' testimony was
that the two boys had been out hunting
and the Martinet boy had pointed his .22
at the other boy saying. "If you was a
rabbit I would hit you behind the ear."
ami pulled the trinKer. The bullet struck
the' other lad behind the ear. but deflect
ed and lodKed in the neck. He was placed
under probation care of Officer Miss
Esther CumminKS.
Another case, that of three Mexican
boys, Jose Martinez, Fedro Murguiio and
Miguel Mejales, changed with stealing
from- pool hall in Johnson, were placed
under the probation officer, following a
fieveri lecture by Jud;e Lockwood as to
the straight and narrow path, which they
promised faithfully to follow hereafter.
The cas of Mansol "Whitaker. a
white boy, who lives near "Webb with
his mother, was continued for farther
evidence. The Whitaker boy was
charged" with beinfr' a general bad boy,
as several witnesses testified, and his
mother not beinjc able to control him.
It will be disposed of next week.
The last case, against Kert Black, or
Bert Davis, who was chained with
robbing the Central hotel; was dis
missed upon appearance of W H. Hol
land, uncle of the boy and owner of
the Central. He did not wish to prose
cute the boy providing .he would .eo
back to his lAolher at Tyrone, N. M.,
niiOi the boy had made good what lie
had; taken. Following a severe lecture
by Judge Lockwood the youth was re
leased, and he promised both the court
and his uncle, that he would never again
lay ; hands on what did rot Itelong to
him.
The disposition' of juvenile casea is
one . of the most Important branches of
the superior court, and Is one which
Is being made a study by -Judge Lock
wood, since he feels that the more a
child's case can be settled out of
court, the. Iwtter man or women tbe
child will make. The juvenile busi
ness has grown to ' large proportion
during -the past five years, and with
the installation recently by Judge
Lockwood of a complete system by
whi;h these cases are being handled
It a. expected that a letter check will lie
kept on delinquents about the county and
the cases promptly disposed of.

j. WHERE THE WRONG THINGS CAN BE FIXED j
WHERE is the person who Bays America is a horrible place,
beset with evils and a mockery of justice?
Lead him around the world and he'll 'come home in
sack cloth and ashes and hungry under his belt.
Abuses in America? Yes. Many of them. Profiteers, liars, four
flushers and some bad laws and some paleozoic emyloyer and some
crazy people. We've probably got the biggest trusts in the world,
just as we've got the tallest buildings and the most acres and the
queerest legislators.
But there isn't a wrong thing in America that Americans can't
fix whenever they want to badly enough. There isn't a wrong thing
that isn't subject to the control of machinery that Americans either
have ready to use or have the power to make. 'No honest person
can have a grouch about a land that contains wrong things as long
as that land offers the machinery for making things right.
In Europe they are just fighting their way up to speaking acuain j
ance with what we've had for a I0113 time. They are just getting
their wages up to our levels, they are trying to get their standard of
living up to somewhere near ours, they are trying to devise labor and
capital machinery that will keep things right side up so they can live
as well a swe do. But wo are still a lap and a half ahead of them on
every count and we're due to stay that way.
British workmen went through the war on wages far below the
American average. In France, still lower.
And profiteers? Arthur Giles, secretary of the' Grocers' Federa
tion of England, told that association that British grocers made nine
millions sterling, largely by dumping obsolete goods on the poor people
under food control.
High prices? England and France have them, with a population
less able than ours to pay the bills. Paris will charge ycu $150 for
a half-dollar breakfast.
The workman who says, "they've better conditions over there,"
has been listening to fairy stories. It will be some time before war
torn Europe can build conditions for her population that will even
approximate our own. Good things cannot be made out of thin air.
Nor can their foundations rest upon ashes and shell holes.
America is like a big man a 2G0-pounder strong, healthy, fear
less, capable. And plenty of food in sight. "Whoever saw a big man
go crazy, or get despondent, or foolish?
England Is like a slim, hungry man. That man of Europe has get
to build up and get meat around the waist and across the chest. And
in those places where food isn't likely to be got for a long time the
thin man may do some foolish things just because there's nothing else

BREAD BELT MOVES NORTHWARD
WHAT DO YOU THINK of the brain power of a man who
can extend the wheat belt 100 miles northward toward the
everlasting snows?
That is the accomplishment of Professor W. F. Thomp.
son of Saskatchewan University.
Not long since farmers jeered at the idea of science invading
agriculture. Thompson is the scientist. And his discovery will revo
lutionize wheat growing in western Canada.
As you travel north toward tho Yukon, the summer season grows
shorter. Beyond a certain point, wheat cannot be grown, for it
does net have time to ripen before the first frost.
Red Fife for years was the standard wheat grown in Canada.
Then a government scientist developed Marquis wheat, which ripens
a week sooner than Red Fife. The wheat belt moved 100 miles
further north.
A year ago a wheat wizard brought out Red Bobs, a wheat that
ripens a week earlier than Marquis. The wheat belt advanced an
other hundred miles toward the North Pole.
Now comes Professor Thompson with still another tmproved
wheat. it ripens a week sooner than Red Bobs. Again the wheat
bolt knocks down the fences of climate arid pushes northward.
Professor Thompson's discoveries will bring under cultivation mi!
lions of ayres of land west of Hudson Bay that until now havo been
supposedly too far north for wheat growing.
Amazing is man's conquest of climate and weather.
Consider the debt we o.ve to the inventor of the hothouse. It
enables us to grow fresh vegetables under giass while blizzards rage
a few feet overhead. .
Ycu city dwellers would rarely eat fresh meat, were it not for
Tcllier. His invention gave us refrigerator cars and cold storage
plants. He died of starvation.
Whon winter !s at its worst, the furnace invention enables you
to live in summer temperature. You eanchange the atmosphere cf
your house to spring or autumn by merely touching a little magic
box called therjnostat.
One scientist even proposes building a riprap jetty 200 miles long,
extending out into the ocean from Newfoundland. It would change
the course of the Gulf Stream and revolutionize the clinnti of Europe.
The Witch of Endor and the bku k art sorcerers of the Middle
Ages would gape amazedly, could they but see the twentieth century
magicians who by inventio nand laboratory research defy the elements.
GOD'S ALL SEEING EYE
, rfK IIOU UOH SKEIST ME," is a Scripture text often used by
9 piotcIx rs to touch men that our'sins cannot be hidden
1 fiom Him.
He is pictured as the God with the "single eye" that
searches penetratingly into tile innermost recesses of our minds and
hearts. ,
And it's true God sees all and knows all.
But there's another thought that must'nt be overlooked while
God sees our sins He also hoes our sorrews and particularly tho
sorrows that come to us bucause of our sins.
But more th:tn this "Thou God aecst me" was uttered by one In
greit mental and spiritual distresp.
There's never a struggle, never a sorrow, never a heartache, but
what it may comfort you to know that God sees and knows and
understands and sympathizes.
"Thou Cod scost nie," is the comfort of the beaten soul in the
conflict with evil. .
"Thou Cod -scrst me," is Hie inspiration of every burdened man
and woman wlu nced.i the strength to finish the task that's God
imposed.
That t.'.r.'M)O.0i'O appropriation will be enough to finance a hih old
time for the air service.
The Senate is making a frantic and final effort to keep from doing
the sensible thing.

HOPE OF ELECTRICITY FOR
RANCHES MAY BE REALIZED
PHOENIX, July 9. Distribution of
electricity for light and power to ev
ery ranch of the Salt River valley
was discussed at the meeting of the
board of governors, this morning.
Plans have already been worked out
by General Superintendent W. R. El
liott, by which the putting up of
transportation lines can be easily car
ried out, to connect with those power
lines already in existence.
That the complete electrification of
the project is a thing of the near fu
ture was the opinion expressed by sev
eral of the board of governors. This
ia considered one of the greatest im
provements to be carried out by tho
association as it will be of inestima
ble benefit to the stockholders and
ranchers. It will mean that farms can
be lighted with power produced by
the owners of the prc-Jext, the water
users, that iarm machinery such as
pumps, engines, milk separators, milk

run by this power and .w ill mean the
saving of thousands of dollars per an

delegates to the convention.
Joe Roberts was elected president,
Al Montgomery, first vice president,
Hugh Ballinger, second. vice president,
acting secretary Heineman was made
permanent secretary and Dick Neil
son was made treasurer.
An executive committee of five was
selected, one for each branch of the
service, and is composed of Frank

M. L. Starkweather and Louis Ynune.
The duty of filing 'the application for
a charter was left to the executive
committee. Fifteen names will be

week on promoting the big battle be
tween tattling Chico, Jlhampion
featherweight of the A. E. F., and
Ralph Lincoln, featherweight cham
pionship claimant of the Pacific
coast, at Elysian Grove on July 11.
Receipts rom the fight will go
toward funding the debt of the newly
organized post, which took over the
affairs of the Great War Veterans,
that organization passing out of of

I work is embodied in a bill which is!
now awaiting the president's signa
ture and which has passed both
houses' of Congress.
The demand for the bridge is large.
Residents of this part of the valley
have long realized that a bridge at J
Lehi will enable them to reach a rich'
district of the valley which now is
practically unaccessible because ot
distance. Residents of the newly,
tapped district will be able to trade
in Mea and Mesa merchants will
benefit throvygh this intercourse.
Two neighboring communities, now
some thirty-five miles separated by
highway transportation, will be
brought together by the building of
the bridge.

History of Deportation Cases
Every since the morning of July 12,
1917, when 1186 mine workers and
their alleged sympathizers were forci
bly driven from Bisbee, the deporta
tions have been a source of discussion
in this state and throughout the west.
The United States grand Jury in
dicted 25 of the most prominent, men
in Arizona, copper company officials,
county officers and private citizens,
following the deportations on charges
ot conspiracy to deprive private citi
zens of their constitutional rights. On
December 3, last, Judge William W.
Morrow of San Francisco, sitting In
the United States district court at
Tucson, quashed the indictments when
the trial was called. The United
States government immediately ap
pealed from Judge Morrow's decision
and today the case is pending in the
supreme court of the nation.
The men involved in the charges
brought by the federal government in
clude Walter Douglas of New York
City, president and general manager
of the Phelps-Dodge corporation, own
ing and operating the Copper Queen
Consolidated mines in Bisbee and the
Copper Queen smelter at Douglas;
Grant H. Dowell, general manager of
the Copper Queen Consolidated Min
ing company; H. H. Stout, superinten
dent of the Copper Queen smelter at
Douglas; Robert Rae, auditor for the
Fhilps-Dodge interests in the south
west; William II. Brophy, formerly
general manager of the Phelps-Dodge
Mercantile company; IJeut. Colonel
John C- Greenway, a mining engineer,
and Harry C. Wheeler, former sheriff
of Cochise county, Aribona.
Wheeler Accepts Responsibility
Harry Wheeler was sheriff of Co
chise county at the time the deporta
tion took place. In June, 1918, when
he was in France as a captain in the
United States army, be sent a cable
gram to Bisbee acceptingsole respon
sibility for. the deportations, which he
declared were made to rid the com
munity of members of the Industrial
Workers of the World, who, he al
leged, were interfering with the gor
ernment's war program by hampering
the copper output.
The . deportations grew out or the
strike of copper miners called in the
Warren copper mining district on
June 26, 1917. The strike was called
by the Industrial Workers of the
World and was not sanctioned by the,
International Union of Mine, Mill and
Smeltermen. The demands of the
strikers included increased pay, $6 a
d&y for underground work and $5.50
for1 surface worjeers ,a six-hour day
and improved working conditions.
The strike continued in force until
July 12, when the deportations took
place. , Unknown to any of the
strikers, preparations had been made
by Sheriff Wheeler and. his associ
ates. The first streaks of daylight had
scarcely begun . to . show in Bisbee
when the blast of a whistle was heard.
Running through the streets in the
semi-darkne&3, armed with revolvers.,
the deputies Sheriff Wheeler had
sworn in as officers of the law, as
sembled and began their tasks. All
persons who could not give a satisfac
tory account of themselves, and who
would not promise to return to work j
in the mines were seized and marched
to the Bisbee baseball park, where
they were confined in a stockade until
the round-up was completed at noon.
Taken From Statt t
During the deportation two persons
were killed, a member of the commit
tee of citizens being shot in attempt
ing to compel the deportation or one
workman and the workman In turn
being killed by the committee. When
the round-up had been completed the
prisoners were loaded into cattle cars
and freight cars and taken first to
Columbus, New Mexico, and later the
train was hauled back to the desert
station of Hermana8, a dozen miles
west of Columbus. During the trip the
deported men alleged they were given
no food. Armed guards rode on top
of the cars, their rifles across their
laps.
At Hermanas, the United States
army took, charge of tne deported
men and removed them In a body to
the military camp at Columbus, where
they were cared for until in the fall,
when the refugee camp was closed
and the men dispersed. Many of the
men, their leaders assert, were not
members of the Industrial Workers of
the World, and a government investi
gation committee held this assertion
to be true. .
Following the deportation special
guards were placed on all roads lead
ing into the Warren district and
trains were serached to prevent the
possible return of persons whose pres
ence was not desired. As a result,
civil suits aggregating $6,150,000 were
filed in state courts by persons who
had been so treated.

WHY CALLES
PROHIBITION
DOUGLAS, July 9. The reason
General P. Elia3 Calles, governor of
Sonora, put a strict ban upon the man
ufacture or sale of liquor in that state
early last month, was explained re-,
cently by the General in Hermosillo,
according to arrivals from Nogales,
General Calles said he had positive in
formation that moonshiners furnished
a band of Yaqui Indians with mescal
and after they had become drunk ac
companied them to El Progreso mine
and helped the Indians loot it. He
also had positive- information that
bootleggers were furnishing liquor to
soldiers in Sonora and undermining
their morale.
Explanation also was given of the
recent attacks made by the Mexico
City newspaper El Universal upon
General Galles. When the general
was summoned to Mexico City and
made minister of commerce in the
Caranza Cabinet, he received all of
the reporters of Mexico City papers
except those at El Universal, the pol
cy of which he did not approve. As
a result, it is said, the newspaper
has declared war upon General Calles
The reported arrest of Ramon Zuni
ga, Leopoldo Palafox, Luis Encinas,
Epigmenio Ybarra, prominent resi
dents of Hermosillo, and Alberto Rico,
a wealthy merchant of Guaymas, also
was denied by the arrivals. Although
there have been numerous (arrests
in connection with General Calles de
cree against liquor sales, there has
not been a single execution and the
belief is growing in Hermosillo that
death waa intended only a "paper"
penalty, in order to overawe the illicit
liquor traffickers.
RETURNED U
Delegates Leave Tonight For
State Convention at Tucson
The delegates to the state convention
of the American Legion leave tonight
In a special car for Tucson from Bisbee
and Cochise county.
In talking with some of the men yes
terday who are returned service men
they stated that they would like to at
tend the convention but offered some
objections to the whole proposition which
showed that they did not understand
the true purpose of the American Legion.
The American Legion is made up of
demobilized soldiers, sailors and ma
rines men who know what It means to
surrender Individual impulse and desire
in a common effort, and who will not
soon forget, in their returned freedom
of choice and action, the days when it
was ''theirs not to reason why'.' What
ever of good there is in the American
army system is known to the returned
men: whatever of bad is also known to
them.
So It is reasonable to expect that the
legion, aside from being an association
of those who contributed to America's
effort in the great war. will maintain a
genuine interest in those who remain in
the army in years to come.
The legion will have a decided Interest
In the affairs of the new standing army
of America, which should be something
better than the one in which, good as
It had always shown itself to be, but
in which the American public showed so
little interest before the war.
These men know the working of the
regulations which were an inheritance
from the old regular army Under the
stress of actual warfare the old poppy
cock of addressing an officer in the
third degree soon disappeared in the
A. E. F., but there were a lot of other
fetiches, more Irksome, that persisted
to the end. The defects of the summary
court, the system that made it possible
for some of the officers to force the men
to buy Liberty bonds against their will
and many conditions which the Amer
ican Legion will be interested in and
make its influence felt in the correction
of these things so that the old saying
that "the next war will be for officers
only" , will not become a reality.
The American Legion is going to work
to the end, H addition to many national
issues, of making a new American army
for the defense of the nation which will
be so constituted that the youth of this
country will, in the future, be eager and
willing to serve in it and feel no shame
in their status, nor curtailment of their
literty in the serving. That kind Of an
army would be an American army and
one of the things the American IegIon
la going to do is to use its influence to
put the new American army on the map
in the greatest of all ways, for they are
the ones who know wherein the old order
can be bettered, to make a military sys
tem that would be entirely American In
spirit and method alike.
War Medals to
Left, Other
'Trinkets' Right
LONDON, July 9. Medals are get
ting so numerous In Britain that an of
ficial order has been' thought neces
sary reserving the left breast for war
decorations. All foreign decorations
and other orders, such as coronation
and Jubilee medals will be worn on
the right side. Which is rather sad
for staff officers who have collected
enough "trinkets' 'to make a triple row
but whose actual war decorations are
few or nil.

THEYSDUGHT
WASHINGTON, July 9. At no time
since the beginning of the world war
has the Jananese government sought
to enter into any treaty relations
with Germany and neither has any
of its agents entertained any proposi
tions of that character.
Existence of a secret treaty between
Germany and Japan under which Jap-j
an was to share with Germany her
special concession and privileges in
China in combination with Russia was
reported in a "press .dispatch from
Budapest quoting a wireless report
from Moscow. This report was made
the subject of a resolution introduced
yesterday by Senator Lodge, Republi
can of Massachusetts, asking the pres
ident to transmit to the Senate a copy
of the alleged treaty and information
as to whether it had been abrogated.
The leport as to such treaty was
characterized today by the enfbessy as
undoubtedly of German or Bolshevik
origin. -
State department officials also pro
fessed ignorance today of the exis
tence of any such secret pact as des
cribed in the Moscow dispatch.

Quiet Reigns at
Corn Products Plant
StrikersStill Out
CHICAGO, July 9. One hundred i
special deputy sheriffs tonight were
patrolling the vicinity of the Corn Pro
ducts refining company's plant at
Argo, a suburb, where last night two
men were killed and about 50 others
wounded or injured in fights between
armed guards and strike sympathizers.
One of the wounded men was reported
in a dying condition tonight. Today
passed with comparative quiet, but
was marked by contradictory state
ments from officials and union men.
The only incident approaching vio
lence reported today occurred when a
number of strikers chased Edward
Reekes, mayor of Argo, and superin
tendent of machine shops. They ac
cused him of attempting to stop their
credit with local merchants. This he
denied.
Union officials assert the company
officials had broken an agreement to
allow the men to decide by vote
Y'heth.er they wanted the "closed
stop." No such, agreement was ever
made, representatives of tne company
I said, but both union and non-union
men were unemployed at union wages
with an eight hour day. ?

New Oil Finds

LONDON, July 9. Britain is hoping

BY REVIEW
STOQKS AND BONDS
MEW YORK, July 9 Under influ
ence of easier money today's stock
market resumed the upward move -ment
which market renewal of large
operations after last week' triple holi
day. Operations during the morning and
intermediate periods were on a par
with Monday's two million share turn
over, but activity abated later when
the market seemed to be undergoing
a process of assimilation.
Call money opened at 9 to 10 per
cent, but at midday a leading banking
institution offered small amounts at 6
per cent. This" evidently exerted a
sentimental effect, rates immediately
decling to 6 and 6 per cent and
closing at 5. The tone was only mod
erately firm at the opening, but
strengthened almost immediately on
Canadian Pacific's 9 point rise, this
Jump .being attributed to something
more tangible than a drive against the
shorts.
Oils, motors and their subsidiaries
and minor fails were next taken up, a
buoyant tone prevailing at noon, de
spite considerable realizing and cut
reactions.
At the last half hour, after publica
tion cf the government crop report
and announcemetn of the ratification
of the peace treaty by the German as
sembly, the market was stirred into
furious activity, numerous leaders re
cording best prices of the session.
Among the stocks then in favor
were shippins, electric equipments,
Ohio Gas, American Paper and Inter
national Paper, Canadian Pacific also
breaking.
NO. 2 WHITE CORN, $2.02
CHICAGO, July 9. Two dollars a
bushel for corn, a price once regarded
as fabulous, was surpassed today here
in the market. Scarely any available
supplies, together with new top record
quotations on hogs had much to do
with the advance. The market closed
nervous at c decline to 3ic gain,
with September $1.95 to $1.95, and
December $1.61 to $1.61. Oats !
finished lc to 2c up. In provisions
the outcome was unchanged to 35c
down.
Ordinary No. 2 yellow corn of the
usual contract grade commanded $2.00
for immediate delivery, and No. 2
white $2.02. July options reached as
high as 1,99, an upturn of 6c within
24 hours. At first a majority of deal
ers seemed to believev excellent cron
conditions prevailing warranted a set
back in values. This view was quickly
dispelled by an unusual lack of offer
ings and by the "soaring of hog values.
Oats displayed 'independent strength
owing to crop damage advices and ex-;
port demands. '
Provisions sympathized with grain
and hogs, but the effect was later
more than counterbalanced by selling
on the part of commission houses.

tor's Advice, Took Cardoj
And h Now Well
Hlxson, Tenn. "About 10 years ago
I was..." says Mrs. J. B. Gadd, of
this place. "I Buffered with a rain In j
my left side, could not sleep at night j
with this pain, always In the left
side...
Jly doctor told me to use CarduL I
took one bottle, -which helped me and
after my baby came, I was stronger
and better, but the pain was still
there.
I at first let It go but began to get
weak and In a run-down condition,
so I decided to try some more CarduL
which I did.
This last Cardul which I took mida
me much better, in fact, cured me. It
has been a number or years, still I
hare no return of this trouble.
I feel It was Cardul that cured me,
and I recommend It as a splendid fe
male tonic"
Don't allow yourself to become
weak and run-down from womanly
troubles. Take CarduL It should sure

BRIGHT SIDE
OF LIVING
One of the many peculiar incidents
which is daily happening in the oil
fields of Texas is one that is told of
Andy Tong which happened a few
days ago on one of the properties
of the Southwestern Oil & Develop
ment Co. at Ranger.
While working on the rig in some
manner a number of the tools used in
placing the pipes were lost down the
casing at a depth of 300 feet and Mr.
Tong was lowered down through a 20
inch hole to the depth of 300 feet
and with the aid of a rope ncose he'
recaptured the tools. I
The average man does not object j
to going into a hole in the ground i
w here he can stand up and walk j
around but it is a most unusual thing,
for a man to be lowered down 300 j
feet at the end of a rope and with thej
aid of a search light and a rope noose
to recover some valuable property.
Mr. Tone is a well known Bisbee
man having lived here for several!
years rnd was employed up to the I
time of his departure for the oil
fields by the Phelps Dodge Corporation.
STACK FINED $50
In Judse Winter's court yesterday
evening the case QtWillram Stack was
brought into court, .in which he "was
charged by one Charles Laughlin with
assault and fined $50 by the court. It
seems from the stories of witnesses
that Laughlin made some remark to
Mr. Stack to the effect that his son
and other companions were being
watched by certain parties, to which
Stack took exception and promptly
knocked Charles Laughlin into the :
street; with the result that a warrant j
was issued tor tue arrest or Mr. stack
The unfailing, good nature of the Amer
ican people in fleeing" the -bright side un
der the niosf trying' conditions in 'war
as in peart- is the way of all America
is the statement made by Mr. Holoway
of the J. C. Penny company.
In getting down to the brass tacks of
daily existence he Rays further:
"Living is no joke And yet almost
all of us make a Joke of it. The grocers
and the meat shops, for Instance, are full
of good-natured banter among customers
and proprietors ad to a dime's worth for
2."i cents and kindred simple pleasantries.
The husband, father and provider and
the housekeeper have their moments of
depression over the ' question of how
much longer .they can keep out of th-i
poor house' at this rate, and yet most
of us do contrive to keep out and laugh
aliout our alleged proximity to it. And
somehow or other we manage to scrape
up enough to give a little something to
every worthy cause that comes along;
and how they do come!"
That's the way of It the human help
ful way; and it wins but every time
beca ise we know' it will.
; The real, progressive road doesn't take
in the grouch' towns unless the program
i to start "a" cheerful revival there, with
Joy to "load the meeting!" '
. And the ' grouchtown settlements will
never' be numerous on the business map
of this country.
The face that the bright side is always
so close at hand is what keeps up the
good-humored American spirit; that, and
the way the people have of overcoming
all difficulties making the best of every
thing, on the . principle of the farmer
philosopher: "The rain's bad for cotton,
but it helps corn wonderfully!":;. , :
Austria Gloats Over
Worries of Czechs
VIENNA, July 9. Austria is gloat
ing over the political troubles that be
set the government of the new Czecho
slovak republic. Pressure of Agrar
ians and Socialists on the government
is increasing. They would hasten the
bationalizatlon of the land, mines and
industries generally, removing the big
owners. Viennese who' draw large in
comes from industrial concerns in Bo
hemia are especially angry over the
plans for liquidation of German-Austrian
concerns within the new country,
under authority of the peace congress,
a provision for which the Czecho-Slo-vak
government Is responsible.
