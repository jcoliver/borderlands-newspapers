FRENCH MAKE ADVANCES
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS, Nov. 21. The French
troops today attacked in the re
gion to the north of Craonne and
Berry-au-Bac, cn a front of about
two thirds of a mile, and pene
trated the German positions to an
average depth of about 400 yards,
captur'ng strong defenses and tak
ing 175 Germans prisoner, accord,
ing to the French official com
munication issued this evening.
(By Review Leased Wire)
The great Hindenburg defense line,
upon which the German commander-in-chief
bad builded his hopes of hold
ing the British from inroads into the
open territory beyond, has been smash
ed. And the task apparently was an
easy one.
Attacking over a front of 32 miles,
extending from the Scarpe river east
of Arras to St. Quentin, Field Mar
shal Haig, with his English, Scotch,
Irish and Welsh troops, has made one
of the most rapid, and epedtacular
drives of Uie war, catching the Ger
mans completely by surprise, captur
ing numerous positions which were
regarded as impregnable and taking I
thousands' of "prisoners and numerous j
guns.
Troops Nearing Cambrai
The apex of the offensive appar
ently is centered on the important
railway junction of Cambrai, midway j
between Arras and St Quentin. He.

servos to build up the machine which This morning before daybreak
rolled back the Italian line.
Th? German hieh command, it was
sai(1 in tnis connection, had counted
absolutely upon winter and French
and Britlsh forces transferred to sup
port the shaken Italian lines as mak
ing impossible any major moves on
the French front at this time. j
The daring displayed by the British
in launching their assault without
tillery preparation was commented on
by the officers. It is the first time
an assault upon thoroughly organized
trench lines has ever been made ex
cept after the guns have blasted a
way through for the infantry. . The
use of the tanks to clear away barbed
wire entanglements and other strong
points also was a novel procedure.
The success of the movement prob
ably depends wholly upon the corn-
plete surprise which was possibly only
by moving forward without the usual
artillery fire.
Officers here have discussed fre-
quenlly the possibility of restoring
the element of surprise attack in
trench operations. Some have held
that w ithout destruction of the bar- i
Dea wire entanglement vim niRU e.T-
plosive shells the infantry would have
halted on its first rush. The use of
the tanks solved this problem for the
British.
Relieve Italian Pressure
There was much speculation tonight
as to the immediate motive for the
attack. Officers were in agreement'
that it was designed to relieve pres-
sure on the Italian front and probably
also to prevent the carrying out ot
any plans the Germans might have
had for an attack on the Saloniki
front Thev vera Inclined to believe
that these results had been accom
plished. Further details as to the number of
prisoners and the amount of war ma
terial captured were eagerly awaited.
These figures will furnish a means of
guaging accurately the damage in
flicted on the enemy and also will
make it clear whether a complete sur
prise was accomplished. , The number
of prisoners and the amount of war
material captured are certain to be
very large, unless the Germans had
already withdrawn a greater part oi
their equipment and men and there
is no hint up to this time in German
war office statements that a retire
ment had been planned.
Some officers here were hopeful
that the drive would have the imme
diate effect of compelling the German
high command to abandon the Italian
campaign or so reduce its force there
that the combined Italian, British and
French armies could drive the Teu
tons tack into the mountains.

things were moving along at much
the same Dace. The Germans had
evinced some nervousness during the
night and for a few minutes, about
5::
0 o'clock in the morning, dropped'
a barrage along a sector where it
probably appeared as though the Brit
ish might he planning a raid. Ths
enemy presumably had been looking
ar-jfor something in this nature but that
they did not expect a battle was clear
ly evident.
Started Early
The correspondent reached a point
near the British line a little after 6
O'clock. At that hocr there was very
little artillery work on either side, j
Machine guns' occasionally broke out
with their staccato bark as sentries
on one side or the other thought they
saw a head over a trench top.
Then came a period of absolute
stillness. Suddenly the long line of
British tanks moved forward and in
a moment the variegated signal lights
j of the Germans shot high in the air.
j The British troops came out of their
shelters and with fixed bayonets and
Rrenades followed the tanks swiftly
toward the enemy barriers.
Ground Firm
The ground was firm and covered
with long grass. There were few big
shell holes, such as are to be seen in
Flanders, for comparatively little ar
tillery work had been done against
this sector. It was ideal going for
the big land monitors and they made
the most of it. As they started for
ward the British put a heavy screen
of smoke all about them so it was
impossible for the enemy to see them
many yards away.
The tanks readied the German out
post lines in front of the main line
and without stopping surged through
it toward the barbed wire entangle-
nients. their guns working steadily alii
I the while. Here was a point where it
had been feared they might encounter tions in the questionnaire, already:
difficulties, but they did not. They;made nublic. would not be altered in
crashed through the barbed wire and
by 7:29 the British infantry were go

Evacuate Havrincourt
At 7:47 the infantry, operating just!
west of Havrincourt had swarmed up
the elevation known as Mount Vesu
vius. A few minutes later this knoll j
was blown up, having been mined by
the Germans. At 8:34 seven tanks
and infantry were seen in the Havrin
court station. In evacuating Havrin
court the Germans did comparatively
littln flamnpp and the nlnre had not i
suffered greatly from shell fire. It is
in much better condition than many
of the towns which saw the bitter
fighting of the Somme last year.
Few, if any, German airplanes ven
tured over the British lines this morn
ing. There was considerable fog and
this, added to the smoke barrage,
made observation practically impos
sible for them. British airplanes, how
ever were operating in large numbers,

yards of the ground.

cording to latest reports has lost 10

stated positively that the league

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor; inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

FRANK L. STANTON.
The last British drive into the heart of the Hindon
burg line must have been a terrible blow, for the Berliu
dispatches do not claim a victory. In fact, the German
statement regarding the fighting in the Camhrai sector is
the most meek and the most mild that has come from
Potsdam since the beginning of the war. The British
war machine seems to have the same terrors for the
Teutons that the Teutonic machine has for the Russians
and the Italians. Not an inch can the Germans gain
against the English or the French, and not an irtrencli
ment or redoubt or town or farm can they hold against
the men of Haig and Pelain when once the Tommies and
the Poilus set out to carve a slice of stolen ground from
the paw of the Hun.
Only a word here and a broken story there have
come to us of the treatment of prisoners in Germany.
But these are enough and too much. The theme is too
terrible upon which to dwell. Especially are the English
butchered and starved and broken. Probably not sinca
the tortures of prisoners by the Indians in the early
days of this country has anything approached the bru
talities practiced by the Prussian against his helpless
prisoners. It would seem infinitely better to be killed
upon the field than to be taken by the Teuton. In con
trast is the treatment by the French and English of
their captured enemies.
Fritz Kreisler, the Austrian violinist, has been barred
from many American cities as an enemy alien. And the
mayors of these cities are right. This Kreisler is
an officer in the Austrian army, and his earnings in
America are sent to Austria to aid in war work. America
is tolerant with her alien enemies to the point of folly,
but there ought to be a line somewhere. That Ameri
cans, in the midst of a most costly war, should pay
money to hear their enemies sing and perform, is a
paradox on patriotism that chokes in the widest throat
of tolerance. Why Kreisler is allowed to run at large
in this country at all is a hard enough problem for an
ordinary patriot to solve.
Dispatches from Italy declare that Turks are using a
Roman Catholic church near Undine, the town captured
by the Germans in their first great rush, for a barracks.
This is desecration with a vengeance. Christian Europe
has never been threatened by a Mohammedan invasion
since Charles Martel threw back the Turks at Tours In
that famous seven-day battle. But trained and equipped
by the Germans, the Turk, after more than a thousand
years, enters Europe with weapons in bis hand.
Those cadets and womn who died in Petrograd for
the Kerensky cause seem to have been the only follow
ers the ex premier had who showed any stability and
strength in time of storm. Kerensky's rise was a
spectacular and sudden as his fall. Events show that
he was greatly overestimated. During his months of
control he . failed utterly to organize a government of
any strength or even to create a military corps that
would strike a real blow for him. Of course, it must
always be borne in mini that he had the poorest ma
terial in the world with which to work.
WHERE POLITENESS IS FATAL
Kansas City Star: It is a great thing for a country
to have a man like Lord Northcliffe who has the intelli
gence to discern things that are wrong and the courage
to speak out and tell about them. Doubtless, as the
Westminster Gazette says, other distinguished English
men have felt as Northcliffe did, but none of them has
bad the nerve to express his feelings.
A country engaged in a life and death struggle can't
afford to let politeness stand in the way of efficiency.
Failure to criticize where criticism is due, as has often
been said, may be disastrous. For it puts a country's
vital interests at the mercy of incompetent men who
may chance through favoritism to be in office.
Lloyd -George stands like a rock and the storm against
him has passed. This little Welchman with the silver
voice and the gentle emile and wonderful brain and
brave heart, is the one great statesman produced by
Britain during the war. Lord 'Northcliffe, the newspaper
man, is a great civilian and of inestimable value to the
allied cause. When Europe was fighting Napoleon only
the bull dog tenacity and genius of Pitt kept the coalition
intact against the FrrncD emperor through fifteen year
of disaster. If the spirit of Pitt still lives in Britain
Germany is doomed as sure as the sun Ehines and tho
tides break on the sandy Bbroe. '
Gen. von Riesling, tho late infamous governor of Be!
giuni, issued 'a testament or last word before he died
and went to bis own place in which be set forth Germni
ideals. A study of this paper gives the reader a glimpse
oftlie German character at close band when speaking
from the confessional. If the Germans bad s sense of
humor one would be inclined to think that this von
Bissling jested. He ar&ues that Belgium was necessary
to German success ' in the initial drive, and therefore
Belgium was violated. God wills it. Why argue or ex
plain further than that? lie argued further that Belgium
must be held. Under the sham and pretense aud deceit
of Germany's peace talk must always be borne In miu.1
the fixed belief of ber leaders that Belgium is necessary
to her northwest frontiers. This little nation must n-it
be domiuatod by either England or France, says von P..
with his last breath, rnd the only way to guarantee
this state of affairs is for Germany herself to hold thin
unhappy country in bondage. Von B.'s last will and
tctitanient bequeathes Belgium to the Teuton forever
more and makes any talk of peace by tbc allies tho
speech of traitors and cowards bereft of all houor before
God, aud tuan.
A London paper has the following: There has just
returned home to Bath a drummer in the Welch regi
ment named Frank Cutting, who was captured at La
Bassee and has been in a German prison' camp. Cutting
was wounded, and for fight days he lay on the field o(
battle without receiving any attention, the weather being
wretched. In this condition he was found by the Ger
mans, who, he declared, stuck bayonets into his legs,
and subsequently procured a large sack, in which he
was carried from the battlefield. , He was then taken
to a pit several miles away, and there left further to
endure terrible sufferings without medical aid. With
five other men of the Welsh regiment also brought in,
the drummer was at last sent to a German hospital,
there undergoing five operations. He describes the
feeding as abominable, the bread being like sawdubt
and the coffee a fluid of bluish tinge. If this sustenance
were not consumed It was flung in the sufferers' faces,
an indignity to which was added that of the officer j
spitting at them. Hardly recovered, these men were
forced to work in coal pits, and, says Cutting, one man
who refused to go down had his head smashed by a
rifle butt, the body being thrown down the pit, where
the rest ot the prisoners were taken by laughing Ger
mans to view their dead comrade.
A. F. 0. L. CONDEMNS
AUTOCRATIC POLICY
OF FOSTOFFICE HEAD
BUFFALO, N. Y., Nov. 21. The con
vention of the American Federation 'of
Labor today adopted a resolution con
demning Postmaster General Burleson
for his "autocratic policy toward pos
tal employees" and instructed the ex
ecutive council of the federation to
obtain an audience with President Wil
son aud place before him facts "con
cerniug the oppressive labor policy ot
the postmaster general."
The resolution was introduced by
Thomas E. Flaherty, of the National
Federation of I'jstal Employees and
Edward J. Gainor, of the National As
sociation of Letter Carriers. Approx
imately a quarter of a million workers
In the postal service, the resolution
said, are forced to accept without pro
test the "unsa:isfacl'jry working con
ditions imposed by an autocrat."
The whole tencency of the day, Flah
erty said, was toward government con
trol in many branches of industry and
public utilities and "we should begin
now to democratize government ser
vice."
"Some delegates seem to think that
government control solves all their
problems," Fl3herty added. "As a mat
ter of fart, the government can be as
harsh and unreasonable as any employ
er. Postmaster General Burleson has
invaded every right we have fought for
in the last quarter of a century."
Vice President Duncan protested
against the adoption of the resolution
without hearing the other side.
"We are asked to condemn the post
mascer general and then proceed to
try him," he said.' "The committee
proposes to proceed in the way that
will bring the best results."
Gainor was against further delay.
Government ownership, he said, may
bring the most tyrannical system yet
devised s far as labor is concerned
Men had been dismissed from the pos
tal service for organization activities,
he declared, and ha was compelled to
resign from the federal service to at
tend the convention.
It was the second defeat of the day
of reports from the resolution's com
mittee's fax'orable action on a resolu
tion recommending to all affiliated or
ganizations that citizenship or a dec
laration of intention to become a citi
zen, be made requisite to union mem
bership. The opposition came prin
cipally from organizations which dele
gates said need tv embrace aliens to
keep up tbeir fighting strength.
At the next session there was an
other long and at times acrimonious
debate on a resolution favoring ire
conscription of citizens. of allied na
tions now living In the United States.
Thomas Black, a Canadian delegate,
brought a st'orni upon his head by re
ferring to all conscription laws as "das
tardly," a remark which resulted in a
demand for retrac'.ion from several del
egates. President Gonipers temporarily re
linquished the chair to reply to Black,
and Delegate Carr, of Toronto, declar
ed that Black's remark did n'ot reflect
the sentiment of unioilabor in Cana-j
da. The demand for a retraction from
Black was not put in the form of a
resolution and nothing further was
said about it after the adoption of the
conscription resolution.
SHERIFF WHEELER
OFFERS SERVICES TO
THE CANADIAN ARMY
According to advices received here
yesterday from Tombstone, Sheriff
Harry Wheeler has again been disap.
pointed in his endeavors to enter the
army of the United States. He made
an effort to enlist as a private in the
regiment in which his brother is serv
ing, but received word from the com
manding officer that the age limit of
40 years would not allow him to enlist
as a private. Sheriff Wheeler was
deprived of going to the last training
camp by the trouble in this district.
and thereby lost his last chance to
get into an officers' training camp.
He thought that he would be able to
get in as a private, but because he
had passed the age limit of 40 years
his hopes were again dismayed.
He is still persistent to get into the
active warfare and has now made an
application to the Canadian govern
ment to enter the service of that
country If he Is not compelled to give
up his citizenship. If he is successful
In this offer he will be joined by a
number of other prominent citizens
of the Warren district who are also
above the age limit and who are de
sirous of getting into the trenches in
France. They hope to hear within the
next few weeks in regard to the en
listment in the Canadian army.
Haig's smash through the Hindenburg line came just
at the right time. Germany's offensive against the Ital
ians and the collapse of Russia were discouraging factors
to the allies and their friends. While Britain hail been
hammering the Germans all summer long and had won
notable victories at Arras and Messines, yH there had
been no offensive on a large and intensive scale durins
the. year. The French had made a brilliant dash or tw.j
and won victories and held their ground against many
counter attacks. But the allies had made n determined
drive against tbc Teutons in full force as though they
meant to break through. Now is the time, if ever, to
bit the line hard. The Italians are admittedly in a ha .
way. They will have to give up Venice if the Germans
can continue their offensive as they have begun. It
Haig and Petain cannot cause the Germans grief on thfl
west front right now they cannot do it at any time be
fore the Americans come. The drive against Canibrai
was a master stroke. No artillery preparation. Just the
tanks and a uick rush by bayonet fighters and grenade
throwers. Another and another drive right now on this
front and the German line may break. A drum fire to
the right or the left of the present advance may well
shatter the GeruuTl morale, sadly affected by British
successes all through the year. Haig outgeneraled van I
Hindenburg yesterdar. A bold stroke at this timq mny'J
break the German hold ou Franco and most of Belgium.
It eanuot come too soon.
SUBMARINE LOSS
SHRINKING FAST
BRITISH REPORT
Did you notice bow everybody is conserving the sup
ply of gasoline? no? What?
LONDON, Nov. 21. Seventeen Brit
ish merchantmen were suk by mines
or submarines last week, according to
the weekly statement issued by the
British admiralty. Of these ten were
vessels of 1600 tons and over, and
seven of less than 1600 tons.
Last week's record of J'.ritish mer
chantmen sunk greatly exceeds that
ot the previous week, when only one
vessel of 1600 Urns or over and five
craft of lc:;s tonnage were sent to the
bottom. It represents in the aggregate
tho greatest number of vessels de
stroyed biuce the week of October -8,
when eighteen were lost. Siuce then
there has been a gradual falling off in
shipping losses until the minimum
since Germany's intensified campaign
began was reached .November 11. w ith
a total of six.
The report apparently bears out the
optimistic statement made recently by
Premier Lloyd-George that he had no
further fear of submarines, and of the
first lord of the admiralty that enemy
submarines were being sunk to an in
creasing extent, for the sinkings In
tho lt'.OO aud over raiogory last week
were the lowest siuce March, except
for the weeks of September 1. No
vember 4 and November 11. when in
tho two lonner weeks the total in
each instance was uight and in the
latter one.
Premier Lluvd-Geurge, in his ad
dress to the house of commons' eBrly
in the present week, said that five
submarines had been destroyed last
Saturday, but be gave no further in-j
formation on the subject. Sir Eric
