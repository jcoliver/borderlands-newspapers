WASHINGTON". Jan. 21. All doubt
as to President Wilson's view of pro-j

statement in which the president said
the war department had accomplished
a task of unparalleled magnitude and
difficulty with extraordinary prompt-j
ness and efficiency; denounced the
congressional war investigations and
declared that reorganization by legis
lation was proposed after effective
measures of re-organization had teen
perfected.
The president's statement was !

Tuesday Moaning, January 22, 1918.
Win the press of the state and the democratic party
leaders aad business men and taxpayers generally stand
evpinely by and see the state university made into a
charnel house? The Tucson Citizen was one of the
first papers to rush to he defense of our great educa
tional institution and brand the new appointments as
being most detrimental to both that school and to the
state at large. New state appointees are trying to con
trol the university and repudiate its contracts like the
Bolsheviki or Russia is doing by that nation's obliga
tions. So far the holdovers of the old board have valiant
ly stemmed the tide and stopped the infection. But by
August enough of these members must automatically
leave the board to place the new appointees In control.
Can the democratic party, with a state election coming
next fall, afford to Jiave the old turmoil that split the
party begin all over again? There were those who hoped
that the lessons of the past would not be entirely In vain,
but it seems not so. Appointments so far. and official
action so far, indicate, alas, the same old disregard for
everything that stand for a great and enlightened stalt
Surely there are democrats able enough and brave
enough to denounce this vicious, little. Injurious policy
of the worst kind of political demagoguery, that has Ken
condemned leng ago by the public of most states anr.
thrown into the discard along with graft and the political
.boss and other enemies of free government.
Reading between the lines, the coal shortage in the
east seems to have been caused mainly by congestion at
terminals. Neither production nor transportation facili
ties seem to be as much to blame as lack of organization
to care for the freight and fuel after it has been trans
ported to its point of destination. And this applies in
the smaller towns of tne west as well as the cities of
the east. City Attorney Sam Kyle, talking yesterday
about the suffering from cold and lack of fu?' in his
old home town of Durrant. Okla declared that the en
tire town had only twelve tons of coal at one time dur
ing the cold spell. And then when several cars were
shipped in from the coal fields, only one nunured railei
distant, it could not be conveyed to the cold hearths cf
the householders for the reason that the streets were
as slippery as glass from frozen ice and snow and not
a horse could stand upon them. Lack of foresight in
providing horses with sharp caulks for their shoes was
responsible. And in a larger way. lack of foresight and
dearth of plans and absence of ability to provide for
emergencies, are responsible for the sad plight of otr
industrial centers and the congestion of our d cijs ano
terminals and freight yards and depot platforms al
over the land. And, as Sam Kyle said yesterday: "Lit
tie old Bisbee, up here In a gorge, protected by tit
.mountains from the storm, surrounded by the desert
and smiling in the sunligat, with her industries going full
blast and her people comfortable and happy, is doing
better than most places, after all."
The near failure o four ship building program, the
delay in providing equiptK nt for our army, the slow prog
ress made in training oar men. the congestion of our
transportation service, these are things we should look
squarely in the face an 1 discuss frankly with a view to
correction. There is no charge of graft or disloyalty
against men in high places. It is pretty well agreed that
all are doing their best. It is simply a matter of getting
the right mea for the hi? work. We seem to have weak
men and not dishonest men in the high places. Our
organization, not our ability or willingness, is the main
cause of our poor showiag to date. For instance, Canar
ian railroads are delivering the goods every day and
Canadian soliiers go to the front in Europe within three
months after enlistment. They have the organization
in the Dominion. Strong swift, stalwart men are in
charge up there. We have plenty of such men. and soon
they will be in charge I ere. The war will force them
there. Any purtisavi politics or carping charges or
spleenic attack upon the head of our government at this
time is weak, mutinous and diflcyal. Our president has
conducted himself greatly In great things, and his only
weakness seems to be for week subordinate. But that
is a weakness common tc a'l of us. We cannot see our
freuds a:?d iwins'e? a? t':e wcrld sees theni. A little
more patience and publicity and the real strength of this
nation will have entered the contest with the submarine
on the sea and the Prussian bayonet on the land and the
Teuton agent everywhere.
Thoughtful men who have followed every diplomatic
and military step of this war are now inclined to bo! 'eve
that the real peril from Germany lies in the east, not
the west The decision will come in the west, but upon
the settlement of eastern questions will depend the fu
ture peace of the world and power of the Prussian em
pire. The world, used to worry over the Balkans as the
powder house of Europe. But what were these little
states with their ten or fifteen millions of people to the
great Slav provinces, shattered and broken and dumb,
with hundreds of thousands of square miles of fertile
land and over a hundred million of people? The Prus
sian is plotting to dominate all these lands and these
peoples. He can well afford to make all concessions
asked for in the west to gain what he desires in the
east He may give Alsace-Lorraine and Belgium and
northern France and evec make reparation for the rape
of these lands and still menace the world if allowed to
keep his grip upon the Russian seaports and the road
to Bagdad. Every German movement and word are di
rected to the end of demination of the Balkans and
Russia as Turkey and Bulgaria and Austria are dominateo
now and ruled and directed as one force from the Pots
dam palace In Berlin. The world has cause to know well
what German arms and powder and drill masters ac
complished in making the sick Turk a sofdier to be
reckoned with. What will these same Prussian agents
and organization do for the countless millions of docile
and dismayed and demoralized Slavs now staggering
about drunkenly upon the- edge of the Teutonic abyss?
A beaten and broken Germany is the only Germany to
discuss peace with for a minute upon any terms.
At a banquet given in Tucson last week the Leagao
of the Southwest discuss d many vital matters concern
ing our people. Old abuses and new reforms were gone
over and corrections and new methods stimulated by
live, long-headed business men It would seem to The
Review that an annual or semi-annual gathering of the
Warren District business men, either by the vehicle o!
the Commercial Club or the Business Men's association
would result in much good to the district. That a ban
quet board swells the attendance at such a meeting is
an established fact, but the speakers an J subjects should
be chosen with care and judgment and a view to gab
practical results and do some real good. Much good fool
has been eaten and hot air wasted at banquets. But
that Is not an Infallible sign that business men as
sembled at the board cannot discuss and start real re
forms in their community. The Warren District Is in
pressing need of a number of imperative public inprove
ments and change of methods and reforms in many old
methods that could be "pointed out at such a citizens
banquet and means discussed to bring about results thai
will make property more valuable here and condition?
more pleasant and the district a more attractive and
economical place in which to lire.
A friend in Kansas writes the editor that the "cursed
blizzard" that was freezing him to death and blowing him
away had originated, so the dispatches said. In Arizona.
And he chided this newspaper man for allowing such
terrible storms to form in his state and go forth to de
stroy the pilgrims of another state. This editor's reply
was to the effect that the blizzard that almost devastated
Kansas was only a mild zephyr down here at its starting
point. Witness, the Mississippi river, father of waters.
It begins as a gentle rill up in Minnesota. A child could
dam it; a dog coufd lean across it; a thirsty man could
drink it dry- But It grows in volume as it goes until,
during the last thousand miles of Its course Its racing
flood passes over the dykes and corn lands and cities of
many states. There are no blizzards in Arizona. Our
windFtorms and mild its are transformed from a lamb
to a wolf after leaving the borders of this sunshine land.
Let the Kansan who is freezing in the grip of these
tempests come down here and thaw the chillblains from
his feet and the icicles from his hair and the blue cold
from his bones. We have sent no storms to him; his
own fierce land transformed our bright and gentle greet
ings into dark lashings of wrath.
PROVERBS BROUGHT UP TO DATE.
George Ade, the clever and brilliant satirist, has re
written some old and well known sayings, proverbs and
fables to fit the conditions the kaiser is attempting to
impose on the entire world today. Solomon himself could
net have struck closer to the mark than Ade does in
these:
Dishonesty is the best policy.
Blessed are the child-murderers, for they shall inherit
the earth.
Be sure that you arc right handy with firearms, then
go ahead.
An evil reputation is better than riches
Truth crushed to earth will not rise again if the
crushing is done in a superior and efficient manner.
Thrice armed is he. who goes around pie king quarrels.
Might makes right.
Hell on earth and hatred for all men.
Do unto others as you suspect thry might do unio
you if they ever get to be as disreputable as you are.
God help? the man that helps himself to ri ne-tabor's
house and bis fields anl his unprotected women.

Chamberlain's Answer
Senator Chamberlain said:
"In my New York speech I had not
prepare! the address and spoke twen
ty minutes extemporaneously without
notes. I pointed out that from Bunker
Hill to the present time we had no
military organization or policy. The j
press report or my aaaress was cor -
rect. But my argument was directed
to the military establishment and not
to other departments of the govern
ment, although it was broad enough to
be subject to that interpretation. But
those hearing it knew I referred mere
ly to the military establishment and
that the senate military committee
had undertaken, through the bills for
a war cabinet and a director of muni
tions to work out changes in the es
tablishment. "I explained that these bills were
not administration measures. I did
not misrepresent them.

Mack Fife, youthful resident of
Sweetwater, Texas, and lately a visit
or in Bisbee daring which time he
worked several shifts for the Copper
Queen at the Sacramento shaft, has
been placed in the Ananias club by
several local men who are acquainted
with nim. The cause of the election
of Fife to membership in the time-old
organization is the receipt in Bisbee
of a paper, the Sweetwater Reporter,
in which a wonderful escape and res
cue were staged by the youthful ro
mancer from the Lone Star State.
According to Fifes' acquaintances in
Bisbee. he never missed a meal at his
boarding house and the worst injury
he received in the mine was a scratch
on his leg. due to a muck stick slip
ping from his hand v hen he was load
ing a car of ore.
The article is ijue rion. follows:
"Hack Fife is ha:;- home from Bis
bee. Ariz where t went to work In
the copper mines, and brings with him
a thrilling story of a recent narrow
escape which he had when the mine
caved in and he came near losing his
life. His parents, Mr. and Mrs. T. W.
Fife, knew nothing of the accident
until their son reached home and they
heard it from his cwn lips. He did
not send a message home at all but
came himself as soon as he was able
to travel.
15 Hours Underground.
"Mack and a companion were labor
ing in the mine when the beams of the
overhead work gave way and the earth
closed in around them so that their
escape was rendered impossible. His
companion was less fortunate than
himself One of the heavy beams fell
on the poor fellow, covering his en
tire body but leaving his head on
touched. He was therefore not killed
outright and lay theje nncorscious of
his condition. Mack says that his
cries for help were pitiful. Finally
Mack lost consciousness but says the
last he remembered was that the man
was pleading with him to strike him
in the head with a pick so that his
suffering might be ended. Fourteen
hoars elapsed before the rescue party
reached them, and when Mack regain
ed consciousness he was told that his
companion died immediately after the

Add 12 cents to that amount in Jan
nary, 191S. or 1 cent more each month
thereafter, and any postoffice. hank
or other selling agency will deliver

The war savings stamps may !
secured by the exchange of thrift

Wants Us to Play
In Their Yard
Mr. and Mrs. T. J- Lof son of McNeal
were in Pouslas Saturday fro.ii thd
Sulrhur Springs vaKey town and Mr.
Lees.in was boosting the growing com
munity r.orth or Po;;g'.as with a teal
characteristic of the residents or ttr.t
section. He is manager cf the McNeal
Mercantile company and is thoroughly
familiar with the valley and its pro
gressive people.
Mr. Ieeson Is anxious for the people
of Douglas and Bisbee to establish in
the vicinity of McNeal recreation
grounds for their use. He said that it
would be an ideal p ace for golf l:nks.
tennis courts and for other rerejtioii
purposes where level ground Is re
quired. A large country club, support !
ed by Douglas and the Warren District
he believes, wou'd do much toward cv
menting the two communities and!
would be a source of pleasure to ali;
concerned. The cost of procuring tte:
ground would be trivial, he said. J
McNeal is approximately twent; ;
miles from Douglas and is about twen-i
ty-five miles from Bisbee. There are,
good roads leading to it from bot a.
places, and they soon will be put in,
better condition, the bend money vot
ed making it so that the regular coun-j
ty road fund could be diverted to thei
bettern-ent of the various highways o: j
the county.
It is the aim of the people of the
valley. Mr. Leeson said, to have Mc :
Neal the meeting place of tte people
of the two largest communities, and
efforts already are under way to have:
Bisbee and Douglas take steps to make
the proposal a reality.
