Most Loyal Adherents, Pens
Indictment of First Chief
SCATHING DENUNCIATION
IS SENT TO CARRANZA
Generals Obregon, Gonzales,
, Also Sent Letter of Warning
That U. S. Will Act Swiftly
Unless Conditions Bettered
WASHINGTON, Spt. 5. Warning
Mexicans that intervention by the
United States is imminent, General
Salvador Alvarado, one of the leaders
in the Carranza movement throughout
its course, has addressed an open let
ter to Carranza himself and Generals
Obregon and Gonzales In which - he
arraigns conditions in Mexico in
scathing fashion.
Alvarado, who attracted attention
of all the Pan-Americans for his ad
ministration in .Yucatan, estimates
that the present death list in the scat
tered fighting between federal troops
and rebels Is one hundred a day. In
Mexico City alone, he said, 8,000 chil
dren die each year for want of proper
food, clothing and shelter, : ; -
Calls Carranz Despot.
' Alvarado, after trying to make the
radical theories of Ue new Mexican
constitution work in actual practice,
declares the system must be changed.
He declares Mexico as passed from
one extreme of an irresponsible ob
structionist congress, to the other
a despotic, corrupting and ultra-per-,
sonal presidential regime without re
sponsibility or legal restraint.
He excoriates the administration of
justice, charging thai, justice Is sold
to the highest bidder.
The full text of Alvarado's remark
able communication has just reached
the state department, where officials
regard it as a sign that members of
Carranza's Inner circle realize dan
ger. Alvarado urges Carranza, Obregon
and Gonzales to drop personal politics
and unite with the revolutionary ele
ment in one great party to solve na
tional problems, which he enumerates
as follows:
Enumerates National Problems.
Pacification of the country; organ
ization of the army; settlement of in
ternational and foreign debts; settle
ment of fcreign claims for damages
caused by the revolution; the petro
leum problem; organization of the na
tional railways, and settlement of the
banking question. He caa upon car
ranza, as the first chief of tne reTora
tion, to lead the movement, and upon
Obregon and Gonzales to resign their
candidacies for the presidency, and
support it. Abuses of the civil and
military authorities In some regions
are so outrageous he says, he won
ders the inhabitants do not rise in
arms. ,
So' many are the causes impelling
the United States to Intervene in
Mexico, Alvarado declares, that the
conflict surely will come sooner or
later, untess the Mexicans know how
to prevent it with ability and patriot
ism. He pi ed)cts President Wilson
will change his policy of "watchful
waiting" if every protest from the
United States is answered by news of
m 'new assault, a new assassination, or
a new blowing up of m train.
; "Thor states are few," says Alvar
ado, "in which life ana property in
the country are not at the mercy of
bandits."
Toward the conclusion of bis letter
General Alvarado say
"There Is no time to lose In the ar
rangement of our affairs. The Euro
pean war is ended; the three most
powerful nations of the globe are our
creditors and demand an early settle
ment of their accounts, and in like
manner they ask for sufficient guar
antees for the lives and interests of
their nationals. If we show ourselves
Incapablu of complying with our
duties, they will take over the task of
guarding and protecting these lives
and interests and we know what that
means:"

Have Impeached Offfciais For
Less Than Wilson Has Done,
Raves Sherman, While Borah
Also Joins In the Assault
WASHINGTON. SeDt. 5. President
Wilson's addresses to the country in
support of the peace treaty and league
of nations evoked prompt and spirited
replies today from the senate floor.
Senators Borah. Idaho, and Sher
man, Illinois, Republicans, assailed
statements by the president at In
dianapolis and Columbus. On . the
other hand Senator McCumber, Re
publican, North Dakota, attacked the
treaty reservations adopted yesterday
by the foreign relations committee
and presented six substitute reserva
tions regarded as expressing views ol
Republican senators favoring reser
vations of "mild" type.
Referring to the . president's state
ment at Indianapolis that under the
league "we can mind other people's
business," Senator Borah criticized
American military operations in Rus

BULLETIN! ! !
(By The Associated Press)
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 5. President
Wilson left here at 11 o'clock to
night for Kansas City, where he
will speak tomorrow.' As the
train pulled out, the president was
seen operating a typewriter.
ST. LOUIS, Sept. 5. The United
States will be the senior partner, the
financial, economical and commercial
leader if she joins the family of na
tions. President Wilson asserted in
the fourth address of his 10,000 mile
tour here tonight.
"I have seen some men of amazing
ignorance saying that the covenant ot
of the league of nations was an ar
rangement for war," said the presi
dent. "I wonder if these gentlemen
commenting on the treaty have ever
read it?". Here the president said he
would give the persons who had not
read the treaty a copy of it and the
audience shouted "Give Senator Reed
one."
U. S. Can't Stand Against World
"If we reject the treaty, we will
stand alone in the world." continued
the executive. He asserted that only
the ignorant believed the United
States could stand alone against the
world.
The executive explained the pro
posed workings of the reparation
commission, saying it would strive to
revive world Industry and see that
Germany paid herdebts to civiliza
tion.
Must Be. Militaristic If No League
The presklent asserted the burden
of reconstruction must be carried or
the United States would be ruined.
In the event that the United States
would become a virtual nenetity in
would become a virtual nonenity in
the financial world, declared the
speaker. Remaining out of the league
means a large standing army, muni
tion factories, fortifications which al
together means higher taxes, the
president explained. He warned that
if this country remains out of the
league and stands alone it must
stand alone as a nation in arms, and
if the United States intends to prey
upon the world she deserves to be
frozen out -of world intercourse.
Sees Treachery to U, S. Heroes
Declaring the covenant one of ar
bitration and discussion the presi
dent said the United States would be
turning traitor to the men who won
the war if she refused to enter the
league. The president reminded the
audience that men in the service were
told that they were fighting to end
future wars, and if this country fail
ed to join the pact, she would not
be fulfilling her pledge.
Without the United States, the
league would merely be an alliance
between the great European powers
and Japan. Mr. Wilson explained, and
the disassociated party would be the
United States. There could be no
true league without the United States
he added.
Mrs. Wilson On Platform
Mrs. Wilson sat near the president
at the luncheon and was on the plat
form at the Coliseum.
Durine the day many bouquets were
sent to her and tonight she presented
them all to a local hospital.
After the evening speech the presi
dent's party motored to the railway
station and went directly aboard tneir
train. It did not leave for some time
however. Held back a little distance
by police lines was a crowd which
repeatedly Bhouted to the president
for a speech, but he smilingly de
clined. '

In presenting his proposed substf

tor McCumber spoke only briefly. In
lieu of the committee reservation to
article 10 of the league covenant, he
proposed a reservation merely de
claring that specific action be re
quired from congress to make terri
torial from congress effective and that
failure of congress to act as proposed
by' article 10 should not be consider
ed a violation of the covenant. The
committee reservation. Senator Mc
Cumber asserted "would be far worse"
than an amendment striking out ar
ticle 10 and "invites and encourages
war." . .- .
Other substitute reservations pro
posed by Mr. McCumber would jn the
main change only the phrasing of the
committee reservations regarding the
Monroe doctrine, withdrawal from the
league and action on domestic ques
tions. Two additional reservations
presented by Senator. McCuniber pro
vide for return- of Shantung province
by Japan . to China upon adoption ot
the treaty and for limitation of voting
power of British colonies . in the
league as to disputes with the mother
country.' The latter two provisions
were covered by the committee as
amendments instead of reservations.

IN REQUESTED
. WITH THE PACIFIC FLEET. SAN
FRANCISCO, Sept. 5. "Passing out
the Dope" is the title of an editorial
in the last edition of the "Gunnery
Dulletla,'1 issued aboard the- New,
Mexico, flagship of the Pacific fleet.
It gives suggestions for 4be treatment
of civilian . visitors aboard ship.
It follows in part:
"Ever since we have been on the
west coast we have been . Uironged
almost daily with visitors curious to
get a glimpse of . life in the navy
Most of them have never been oa
board a man-of-war as big and mod
ern as the New. Mexico and, of course,
they are going . to ask questions to
which, to' us, the answers' seem ap
parent. Think , a minute, though!
There has been a day when to all
of us a ship was Just as strange and
just as new ' and we asked - exactly
similar questions.
"Of course, the temptation to give
a fool reply is strong, buti fortu
nately, few of us have succumbed to
that temptation. However, such state
ments have bee heard, aa the fol
lowing: ..'Now these shells (referring
to the anti-submarine . shells in the
five-Inch gun casements) are for tar
get practice,' because the. blunt nope,
makes a bigger hole in the target an
it is easier to count the score,' -and
other Just as asinine. ; . 1
"That may be funny, but it . is sot
true. As we said, incidents like that
are rare, but they should not occur
at all. I ' . ,- ' y
"The sole 'reason this navy of ourt
has for its existence is to protect the
United States and . its people and, a
the expense of our existence falls on
the people ,they have a right to know
ihe truth. about us: We are a form
of national insurance and the nation
should know as much about us aa it
does of its fire or life insurance. So
lake a little care. In answering our
visitors' questions and send them

ciently insured.',' s - :

NEW YORK, Aug. 30 Is the hu
man race losing its legs? Will fu
ture Americans, using the auto, street
car and airplane, be legless?
Icience has advanced the theory
that legs are going into the discard
through disuse. Women particularly
have neglected their legs and feet so
long they are suffering malforma
tions, and no longer have the classic
beauty of past ages. -
"Nossing of ze kind V'i ieX claims
Mme. Mistinguette, Parisiond actress,
just arrived in New York, who may
be considered an authority on the
subject because she is said to have
the moat perfect legs on the stage,
which are insured for S100.000.
'-'Mothers might deform children's
feet for centuries, as Chinese have;
but each new Chinese girl baby has
perfect feet.
"You could cut off ze feet for hun
dreds of years, but ze new genera
tions would have feet just ze same.
"If you break a man's arm his son
will not be affected. And if a wo
man rides in an auto all ze time, she
may weaken her own legs, but not
her daugh ter's. No, no'.
"Science? Pooh! ' ' .
"So long as men seek beautee In
zeir mates, ze human form will not
degenerate."

Leake was. bound over, to. the super
ior1 court -on -the charge of murdering
Elmo E: Wilson,' near'.Double Adobes
two weeks agQ. . .Bonds were set at
53,000.
The most pertinent testimony
adduced by the state was the
ante-mortem statement made by
Wilson to . the effect that
Leake shot him following an argu
ment t'over the loss of some road
camp material. The statement said
that Leake, shot before Wilson struck
him with an axe ; that the first shot
missed him;- that he tripped and fell
and,, that . a second shot hit him in
the spine as he was lying ' on the
ground, v h .. i -
Leake told his own version of the
affair to. the court, claiming, that, he
did 'not draw a gun or start shoot
ing until Wilson , had threatened him
with an axe, striking him on the head.
He said he then-shot in self defense.
No other witnesses for the defense
were heard.
Sheriff James McDonald, who ar
rested Leake, attended the trial and
placed the ante-mortem statement to
him by Wilson in evidence.

was :made Thursday by the state
board of education at it's meeting In
Phoenix. Regular teachers, however,
the board held, must wait the regular
time' of examinations for certificates.
Superintendent C. F. Philbrook,
who attended the session said the
new ruling. would prove very accept
able to the Warren district, due to the
many changes being made here in the
teaching personnel recently. The
superintendent declared that the spec
ial teacher would now have an op
portunity to be examined at once and
his services utilized that much sooner
. The teaehing situation, the 'super
intendent added, was at the present
time very satisfactory in the higher
schools, although there were several
vacancies yet to be filled in the grade
schools. . r

Justice Is Tempered
By Mercy as Young
Bandits Face Court
OveK 20 bold bad bandits the eld
est of whom owned up to 14 years
appeared at Central school yesterday
to answer to their "crimes" at the
ujvenile session presided over by
Judge A. C. Lockwood. Of this num
ber, one lad, Mario Fernandez, was
ordered deported across the border
and one, Fred Hendrickson. aged 9, is
to be sent w to . a private . institution.
Everybody else was "given another
chance."
It was a court session at whit
mercy and kindliness wora the pre
dominating features. Miss Esthei
Cummings, probation officer, pleaded
the good rather than the bad in al
most every one of the youngsters
placed in her charge. Parents prom
ised to look after them better here
after, the kiddies themselves declared
they would be good, and the result
was another chance.
The boy ordered deported was In
volyed in a. robbery at the Arizona
grocery, on Main street the first of the
week.? He had already been in trou
ble of a similar nature before, had
proved incorrigible, and had no regu
lar "folks." It was deemed better
that he should go back with his rela
tives across the border. j
Young Hendrickson was one of the
youths who stole the belongings of
C. W. Cromwell at the country club
and was found by Constable Bohm
folk in an improvised robber ' cave
near Gold Knob.

There' has been for the past week or more
some talk amongst the employees of our estab
lishment regarding a new schedule for opening
and closing hours.
In order to meet our employees on an
equitable basis, we have left the decision entirely
to them. A ballot was taken and a majority
decided after careful consideration, after an
investigation by count, to see when the public
could best be served.
. It was shown that more people did their
shopping between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and
5:30 p. m., than any other time during the day,
very few trading after that hour- We have
therefore decided, beginning Monday, Septem
ber 9th, to open our store at 8:30 a. m. and
close -at 5:30 p. m., Saturday excepted, when
we will keep open until 6 p. m.
We hope our , friends and the public will
help us and our employees to make these hours
their shopping time and ask their kind indul
gence. Very Respectfully,

A JUVENILE HOME FOR LOWELL
WHEN the smoke of battle from the road controversy in
Cochise county has cleared away, it would be a construc
tive piece of work on the part of thre county supervisors
if they would take up the project of a juvenile home. A
number of persons interested in welfare work among the little ones
have been working quietly on the project and it Is hoped the matter
can be presented in such a way that the supervisors will see the ne
cessity for establishing an institution of this kind. . '
Certainly, with Cochise county's population, a juvenile home is a
pressing need. - Lowell has been suggested as the location for. the
institution and we canAhlnk of no better place for it. There are any
number- of. suitable sites available for the building where adequate
grounds, could be had, and so far as population1 is concerned, Lowell
is the logical point.
At present there Is no way of handling the cases of juvenile de
linquency, which occur with just as much frequency in Cochise county
as in other communities. Boys and girls whose feet are straying
from the straignt and narrow path, get a warning at their first of
fense and then, too often, are left to Continue on the downward way
until nothing but the doors of a prison await them. '
When the average youth is once sent to jail his ruin is complete.
He there meets the hardest type of law-breakers who soon give him
a post-graduate course in crime. The boy's chief eagerness for free
dom then is to. put into practice what, he has learned in jail. The
girl who' has once known life behind prison walls is well-night past
redemption.
There should be some place where boys and girls, too often the
victims of environment, may be led out of crime, not into it. A Juve
nile home, properly managed, is the answer to the problem. The
entire Warren district should unite to help Lowell secure such an
institution.' ... ;
JOY RIDING OVER MEXICO
ET might be a good idea for the war department at this rather
touchy period to put a stop to .our aviators' sight-seeing jaunts
over Mexico. Patrolling the border is perfectly legitimate air
plane Bervice, but circling far into the interior, swooping over
the state capital of Chihuahua and other similar "Joy rides" which
recently have come to light are not' only unnecessary but dangerous.
The other day one of our aviators patrolling the border near
Laredo was fired upon by Mexican soldiers and wounded in the ear.
It looked as if punitive expedition No. 3 was about to start, when the
international law "sharks" at Washington solemnly opined that the
Mexicans were perfectly within their rights. It had been the custom
for a long time in Europe, they said,' to fire at aviators from another
country who crossed the boundary Una and the action of the Mex-
icans was lawful, though awful. -
The Mexicans apparently weren't so well informed on interna
tional law for they promptly sent their "regrets," said the soldiers'
commander was absent at the time, and those guilty would be
promptly punished. Then to add to the tangle, General Dickman
forwarded a report to Washington denying the aviator was in Mexi
can atmosphere and declaring he was well on this side of the line
' when fired upon.
However, these complications are beside the main point. The
border situation is at all times a ticklish one. The recent kidnaping
of -two of our aviators by Mexican . bandits and the punitive expedi
tion that followed made the situation more acute. Two aviators are
: at present missing in: Mexico. . , i
Under these conditions the flying of our airmen over Mexican
territory is uncalled for, foolhardy and impudent. The airman takes
enough risks at home without going where he is not wanted.
The Mexican people, particularly the ignorant classes, are quick
to resent any fancied slight as an overt act. It is the part of common
sense for the border air patrols to remain strictly in fheir own back
yard.
I ; A REPORTER'S FATAL ERROR j
IN compliance with a courteous request by the Arizona State Miner
of Wlckenburg, wo have had killed a member of The Republican's
reportorial staff, and his properly mangled remains have been dis
solved in quicklime. There is nothing we would not do for our
brethren of the press when we are asked in a gentlemanly manner
to do it, says the Arizona Republican. "
The offense of the reporter, perhaps, did . not merit quite such
punishment as we have caused to be inflicted upon .him, but it was
. none the less serious. . It was in relation to a description by him of
: a late strike in the Abe Lincoln mine near Wickenburg in which he
stated that there had been encountered a "vein 60 feet wide."
In the, hour and article of death the reporter said that he did
- not know much about mines; he did not know how wide or thick
vein ought to be; he' had forgotten, he confessed, just what his in
formant had told him about this veiu: it was "60 something" and in
his note book the entry looked like "inches."
That seemed to him to be too narow, especially for a mine named
the Abe Lincoln. The reporter said that he had been reared by
godly parents of the Republican faith, in the fear and worship of tho
great war president, so he resolved the doubt in his favor and ma
f it "feet" instead of "inches." He confessed that at one time he was
on the poiit of declaring that the vein was 60 miles wide, but on
second thought he feared that such a vein would not fit into the
topography, conformation and general geological conditions of the
country. He then decided to keep the side walls of the vein within
the limits of the Wlckenburg miniug district. Those were his . last
words.
j; FUTURE OF THEINTERU j
P ROBABLY, next to rural free delivery, the interurban electric
systems have done more than anything else to modernize
American farm life.
Within less than two decades, a 60-mile trip to town has
been mailt- easier than a five-mile Jog behind old Dubbin used to be.

BUNCH CONFESSES
HE SHOT HIMSELF
PHOENIX, Sept. 5: Breaking down
under the questions of deputies of the
sheriff's office, L. C. Bunch, alias
Burch, who told the authorities that
he had been waylaid by a highway
man near Fish Creeic, who shot him.
confessed yesterday that the wound
in his side was self-inflicted. He stat
ed that he had accidentally shot him
self and his condition was such yes
terday that it was not. deemed advis
able to proceed in the criminal case
against him.
He was to have been arraigned In
Justice DeSouza's court, but the mat
ter was continued until Bunch is in
better physical condition.
It is believed that after a 24 hour
rest in the county jan he will be fit
and in a'l probability will be brought
before Judge De Sousa today. Bunch
is alleged to have not only told the
deputies that his story of the shoot
ing was a frame-up, but to have also
stated that he stole the horses from
E. A. Starr and that he had turned
them loose and hidden the saddles. HJ
later led the officers to tne animals
in a canyon at Mormon Flats, where
he had placed them.
GLOBE FOOD SHIPMENT

YUMA, BOYS SHOT -
BY ENRAGED MAN
YUMA, Sept. 5. A dispute over
the ownership of a pump and its use
resulted yesterday la a shooting
scrape which sent young 'Merwell Es
trada to the Yuma hospital and Jose
Sierra to the county jail.
Young Estrada went to the pump
to get some water. He was ordered
away by Sierra and when he did
not go Sierra took a shotgun and
shot the boy. The boy's arm was
shattered so badly at the elbow that
it is possible that it will have to b
amputated. A brother about 10 years
old was standing close to Estrada
and was shot in the toe.
As soon as it was knowa that
Sierra had used a shotgun on two
young boys he was placed in the
county jail for safe keeping.

BURGLARS MAKE BIG

around the lock which they cut out
of the front door of a clothing store
in Chandler, burglars early yesterday

.shop which they looted to the ex
tent of $3,000 worth of merchandise.
That the men carried away the
loot in cctton sacks which were used
by shop proprietors to cover suit
cases in their stock is known by the
'officers Investigating the robbery. It
is also known that the burglars made
their getaway in a high powered au
tomobile. According to Deputies Smith and
Blanco who were detailed on the
case, the burglary occurred shortly
,'fter two o'clock yesterday morning,
persons in the vicinity of the shop
having heard the machine pass at that
time. The officers obtained a full

tentiary at Florence for the murder
of Kenneth C. Falston.
Mrs. McCann stated even before her
husband was charged with the mur
der of the Oregon health seeker, their
married life was unnappy and that
she would have instituted proceedings
asaint the man whose bride she be
came in January, 1916. 1
It was iii November. of 1917 that
McCann was " charged with the mur
der of Falston, who mysteriously dis
appeared shortly after drawing funds
from, a local bank. The case was dis
missed because of the failure of the
authorities to discover tne body of the
man believed to have been murdered
by McCann, with whom he was last
seen. With the recovery of the body
the. following April, afcCann was re
arrested and convicted. During the
long trial Mrs. McCann was an inter
ested spectator, although she refused
to testify against her husband.
Yesterday she again appeared in
court und this time asked for a legal
separation from McCann, the decree
being granted by Judge Stanford.
HALF MILLION DA MAGE TO
COTTON CROP IN STORM
PHOENIX, Sept 5. me Salt river
valley cotton crop was damaged to
the extent of nearly half a million
dollars by the storm of August 23, ac
cording to an estimate made by the
weather bureau office. The heavy
rain ol August 30, it is feared, may
ilso materially increase the loss on
plants already beaten down, but just
how great, this loss win oe cannot ba
estimate! probably until picking time.
Rain at the present stage of cotton
in both the Yuma auj ;-.aoenjx sec
tions is likely to cause some dropping
of the lower bolls, but if followed by
Pair, warm weather, this loss would
not be great.
In general the week ending Septem
ber 1, was a favorable one for agri
cultural interests. The fair weather,
which prevailed in most sections un
til the oOth, enabled good progress to
be made with the harvesting of corn,
hay, alfalfa and fruit crops. Reports
indicate that the yields are to be av
erage to large and of good quality.
On the Apache Indian reservation in
sect pests destroyed the bean crop,
but corn and hay are yielding well.

"Scout" Kelly reported at Phoe

EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES
A Los Angeles woman has just been
refused a divorce by a Phoenix judge
because she refused to live in our
state capital. If her husband tried to
make her live there in the summer
time she should have been given her
freedom and liberal alimony.
SOME FOLKS NEVER ARE
SATISFIED.
The senate committee investi
gating the Mexican situation is be
ing criticised in some quarters
"back east" because Senator Fall
who has interests la Mexico and
who has lived close to the border
for a score of years, is one of the
investigators. This is the sort of
constructive criticism that would
appoint a college professor as
coal administrator and put a book
keeper in charge of airplane con
struction. But maybe they dread
the truth about our relations with
Mexico.
THE USUAL FALL "RUSH"
Tax payments started this week,
but so far there has been no
necessity" of forming a line to the
right to property owners eager to
sette up may wait their tgrn.
It's about time again to prac

IT NEVER STRIKES TWICE IN

only injury she sustained was the

. THAT BORDER FENCE
Now they art talking about
building a strong wire fence along
the Mexican border to prevent
retaliatory cattle "rustling". This
would deprive too many people of
''their means ot livelihood, we fear.
We doubt if the old-fashioned
"rustler" could turn his hand to
automobile, stealing with much
success.

DON'T COME THIS WAY.
The prohibitionists are going to
invade Europe next in the hope of
making the world "dry". We can
only live in hope that they'll
leave Mexico till the last.
A QUESTION OF NATIONALITY
There was something vividly il
luminating about our relations
with Mexico in the way the Mexi
cans hasten to make it plain that
the Adam Schaefer tc was killed
by bandits Jhe other day was an
American and not an Englishman.
DEPORTATION SPECIALS.
They have formed a new revolu
tionary party t Chicago, patterned on
Russian lines and bearing the name
of thp Commune.; Quite fitting that
the scene of the Haymarket tragedy
should be the birthplace of the Reds'
new organization. We would suggest
that a line of deportation steamers be
organized at once.
JUST A THEORY.
Perhaps the recent slump in our
birth rate Js due txJ the fact that our
young married people have found that
even with gasoline at Its present price
it's cheaper to run an automobile
than a perambulator. . . ,
HIS BEST JOKE YET.' ,
John Kendriok Bangs, the hu
morist, is about to be elected to
congress, his friends assert. We
have always considered that as a
humorist, Mr. Bangs would make
a good dcongressman.
IT MAY WORK BOTH WAYS.
They say that a raisin In the
bottle will produce the "kick".
And yet we remember an old su
perstition that eating raisins
would fortify the knees and clear
the head "when they began to
"come too fast".

A Sketch of the Province In China Which May Cause
Trouble for the League of Nations.
Copyright, lull). Tbf
NE of the smaller and yet quite
significant points In the Treaty
ot Peace was the disposition Of
the German Interests' or rishts
lb China. . On more than one occasion
the German Empire had used a trivial
matter as a pretext to extort from
Citina fcome territorial or commercial
concession. When the Great War
broke out Japan sided with the Kn
tente. and proceeded to capture what
the Germans possessed on the main
land' of the Chinese Empire. In the
settlement of many conflicting inter
ests and demands. Japan wss jrlven
the German holdings in the Province
of Shantung, with all the rights and
privileges which that nation had ceded
to Germany.
Birthplace Of Confucius
At the foot of the Imposing Tal. in
Western Shantung, the thrice blessed
bones of Confucius have rested these
four thousand years. '.Vest ward from
Its mountain retreat the spirit of the
age never to the mind of the de
vout Chinese far distant from the hal
lowed spot has viewed the wide
spread land which after many years
the Chinese were compelled to give
up. But not many miles from the
eternal hills, wild but peaceful In
their solitude, comes the echo and the
Babel of lnternafional strife. Thi?
has been ever since Germany exacted
fhls "a discipline of consequences" for
the lives of the two German mis'
lionaries who were killed Jby a Boxer
piob in lS97y; fjo fjuartyrs, were ever
riore tltteriy avenged, for there clo?e

and In summer many battleships.
The Chinese are the oldest living
nation in the world, and of all the.
human family her people have the
longest story. They have probably In
vented aid originated more than any
other people whose history we have
read. The people called Chinese are
a composite race formed of a hundred
tribes and nobody" knows whence or
how the first settlor came to China.
They are at present a frugal. ..tem

said, "there are some things in the
Christian religion that one cannot ex
plain, and It must be taken "on faith.
Here li where tha difficulty with the
Chinaman comes 'In. He wants to
know."
Besides the Christian religion ln
troduced by the Jesuits In the Sixth
Century, and. by missionaries many
years later, they have Confucianism.
Buddhism. ' Taoism ' and Mohamme
danism. v.
Confucianism has enjoyed state pa
tronage and protection for more than
2.J00 years, and Is perhaps the most
popular. Enormous .numbers of the
adult population cannot read or write.
The reform In education Is Joist now
occupying the minds of the educated
people of the. nation. Hundreds of
men. and women have been sent to
different parts of the world to receive
finishing courses, and '. Peking has a
fine university. Shantung has a few
schools, mainly those taught by mis
sionaries, so life goes on there much
in the old-fa.shloned Chinese way. al
though all parts of China are waking
up, and those who saw China twenty
years ago and see it today find a differ

Ancestor Worship
Ancestor worship still exists and as
this Is one of the teachings of Con
fucius, Shantung so near his grave is
perhaas one of the pfaces to see it at

G. J. Kelly, the baseball ecout for
the Detroit American League baseball
team and well known as a boxing pro
moter, has been running into nothing
but hard luck since he left Bisbee a
couple of weeks ago, according to a
letter received yesterday by O. S.
French. Kelly is now in El Paso try
ing to- start something in the boxing
game and has suggested Frankie
Fouser for a fight in Bisbee against
Russell Chambers, the fast First cav
alry boxer from Douglas.
Kelly recently had it all fixed up
for a fight for Benny Leonard at Phoe
nix during the state fair in November.
Kelly had the backing and the promis ,
of Leonard's manager to make the
date, but according to the letter re
ceived by "Frenchie" yesterday, the
state fair commission has queered
the deal by asking 30 per cent of the
receipts. "Kelly fears the match can't
be put on under this impose.
Kelly also had it all fixed to stage
some finish fights at Nogales in So
nora, but after putting his O. K. on
the project, the presidente has with
drawn his approval, so that the deal
is off. While Kelly was in Bisbee he
matched Jimmy Fox and Ralph Lin
coln and that fight, too, was called
off, owing to there being no Labor
day celebration here.
Altogether, it looks as if Kelly was
due for a break in the luck. He
speaks vell of Fousier and believes
he and Chambers or he and Palmer
would prove a good attraction for
the Bisbee "fans."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS.
NEW YORK, Sept. 5. Labor con
ditions overshadowed the stock mar
ket again today, latest developments
affecting the steel and iron workers
causing a sharp reaction after an
early period of comparative firmness.
The Gompers telegram to President
Wilson directed renewed attention to
the tense situation in that important
industry.
Speculative interests, which re
cently resumed their bullish commit
ments in various specialties; liqui
dated freely on this phase of the labor
situation and the shorts quickly real
ized the importance of the news as a
lever with which to depress prices.
Further weakness in exenange with
francs and lires at new minimum also
helped to brin gabout the reaction,
lowest quotations ruling In the last
hour,, with rallies of 1 to 4 points at
the close. Sales, 1,425,000 shares.
Stocks which suffered greatest Im-;
pairment included crucible steel at an
extreme decline of 12 points; Bald
win locomotive, General ' motors,
Studebaker, Stutz, American woolen,
Central leather, Atlantic gulf, Barrett
company and Utah copper.
United States steel registered a
gross reversal of 3 points, but display
ed some support in the final dealings,
other standard shares, Including the
better known rails, also making mod
erate improvement. )
Oils almost alone ended with vari
able gains, marked ' strength having
been shown by Mexican and California
petroleums and transcontinental ship
ping also reflecting firmness.
Bondd were Irregular on reduced
dealings. Total Bales, par value,
aggregated $9,650,000. Old United
State bonds were unchanged on call.
LABOR SITUATION IMPROVED.
NEW YORK, Sept. V twin's tomor
row will say: -
Business sentiment in the present
uncertain period Is ' susceptible to
quick fluctuation and this week
brought a sudden reversal of feeling.
The turn has been for the better and
a less threatening labor outlook
chiefly explains it. Fresh strikes of
magnitude that had seemed to be im
pending have fortunately failed to de
velop. The whole question of wage
adjustment is obviously bound up with
the high price problem, which Is ev
erywhere causing agitation an which
has left an unmistakable imprint on
conditions. While renewed impetus is
given to manufacturing and distribu
tion, yet the fact remains that new
business in some important lines is
now distinctly hesitant, and that
there is greater conservation respect
ing the future. . -

THE GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 5. Material up
turns in the value of corn resulted to
day from evidence that liquidation
had run its course for the time being.
Prices cio&ed strong, 1 to 2 net
higher with September $1.62 and De
cember $1.31 to $1.31. Oats gain
ed to 1 and provisions 75c to
$2.10.
Notwithstanding, that corn showed
considerable weakness at the opening,
indications soon developed that a ma
jority of traders had taken a bullish
position. The general contention of
the bulls was that the recent break
of 45 cents a bushel from the high
point on December! had discounted to

"A SPLENDID TONIC"
Sits Hiuon Lady Who, On Doc
tor's Adrice, Took Cardoi
AndhNowWelL
- Hlxson, Teno. "Aboat 10 years act
t was..." says Mrs. J. B. ,Gadd, of
this place. "I suffered with a pain In
my left aide, could sot sleep at night
with this piln, always In the left
aide...
My doctor told me to use Cardui. I
took one bottle, which helped me and
after my baby came, I was stronger
and better, but the pain was still
there.
I at first let it go, bat began to get
weak and in a run-down condition,
so I decided to try some more Cardui,
which I did.
This last Cardui which I took mxde
me much better, in fact, cared me. It
has been a number of years, still X
have no return of this trouble.
I feel It was Cardui that cured me,
and I recommend It as a splendid fe
male tonic"
Don't allow yourself to become
weak and run-down from womanly
troubles. Take Cardui. It should sore
ly help yon, as It has so many thou
sands of other women In the past 40
years. Headache, backache, sldeache,
nervousness, sleeplessness, tired-oat
feeling, are all signs of womanly trou
ble. Other women get relief by taking
Cardoi. Why lot you? Ail druggist

About Alcohol in Hair Remedies
Every physician and chemist knows
the antiseptic value of alcohol and also
that practically every substance capable of bene
fitting the hair or scalp requires a suitable amount
of alcohol as a solvent.
The doubling of the U. S. tax on alcohol
($4.18 per gaL) has caused a flood of watery
hair preparations, the repeated use of which may
cause harm unless followed by hot towels to stim
ulate the scalp,
Herpicide cannot be taken internally.
