SAYS BAKER
Expansion of American Mili
tary Forces Will Depend
Largely Upon Foreign and
Shipping Situation.
' (By Rnin Leased Wire) ;
WASHINGTON. Jan. 25 Expan-f
aion of America's fighting forces be
yond their present strength depends
upon such factors as events abroad
and the shipping situation, Eecretary
Baker said tonight in disclosing that
the war department has not fixed a
date for another draft nor even de
termined bow many men shall be cal
led. When Mr. Baker told The senate
committee yesterday the United States
would have a half million men in
France eariy this year and that in all
a million and a half Nrould go across
if ships could be found to carry them,
he referred to the divisions now xn
training camps and these already m
Europe. Future developments will j
decide what additional forces will be
sent. I
The secretary made clear today his j
opinion that if eTents made it netvs-;
sary to call out more than another in- j
crement of half a million men, the,
executive's authority to draft men for
fit ht tag units other than reserves'
would be exhausted and further legis-'
latioa by. congress would be neees- f
sary. He said, however, that under:
the authority to' call two increments :
of line soldiers of 500.000 each an 2
such 'additional rum hern,, re", -meruit
kat la liens and special units "as the ,
president may deem necessary." Xif .
second draft might bring out in nil'
as many as a million men.
Tentative Approval. f
The senate committee today tenta-i
tively approved legislation proposed
by the war department to provide for
the registration of youths attaining
tbe age of 21 years since June 5,1
authorizing the fixing of quotas on ;
the basis of class ote of the new das-j
sificalion and empowering the presi
dent to call men nee Jed for special '
industrial or other work. Provost j
Marshal General Crowder. appearing
to explain the bills, told the committee -it
was proposed to hold a new draw-!
ing to establish the order of liability ',
' of the new registrants. When the
new men have been given their ser
ial numbers, their names will be in
serted in the classes to which they
may be assigned, according to a plan
sow being worked out.
It is assumed. General Crowder
said, that most o fthe new registrants
will fall into class one. giving that
class this year a total of some two
million men. From class one it is
proposed to take the next and any fu
ture drafts.
Crowder Disproves Plan.
In a formal memorandum present
ing h ivsiews. the general also dis
approved suggestions that the regis- j
tration be extended to men beyond j
the age of 31. saying the effort of I
classification is so great and so ex !
pensive, and the number of persons
past 1 years who would fall in class
one so small, that the task would not
be worth while.
. Although Secretary Baker today
reiterated his desire to have exempt-,
ed registered men who reach 'the age.
of 31 years without being called into!
the military service, the committee!
refused to include such a provision in !
the legislation. General rowder dis
approved the suggestion. The bills j
probably mill be introduced in Thej
senate tomorrow and Senator Cham-:
beriain said tonight they would be
pressed for early passage j

Talk
Next Monday morning the Bisbee chapter. American Red Cross,
wiil start a campaign to secure a permanent fund with which to pro
viJe the raw materials for local workers.
Needs of local women, who are more than anxious to make some
thing which will aid and comfort the American sold.er. are the object
of the proposed fund. The Bisbee chapter expects to secure the pledge
of a certain amount every month and gruge the wcrk for the enUre
year on that basis, assuring the production of a gre'i amount of need
ed sarments and regularity in ie process. The chapter seeks to re
place the present system with real efficiency.
One of the principal reasons behind the movement is the desire to
eliminate benefits, entertainments, tag days and other efforts of like
kind to raise temporary aid. The sponsors of the movement realize the
leas of motion and effort in the old system and wish to substitute one
which will assure tie future work of local Red Cross workers.
To this end the people of the Warren d'strlct are asked to meet
the ctmpaign with the best pledge they can afford. The campaigners
will see everyone in the entire community.
Talk it over!

II. S. FAR AHEAD
German Undersea Craft Have ,
Sunk Sixty-Nine Vessels J
While America Has Added!
. 107 Vessels to Its Tonnage.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Jan. 29 In the twelve
months of unrestricted warfare
launched against American and allied
shipping by Germany one year ago
Friday, there have been sunk by sub
marines, mines and raiders itixtv-nine
American vessels totaling 171.661
gross tons, according to a careful com
pilation of records of sinkings which
have been made public during the peri
od. ' Offsetting this loss American ves
sels, most of which were sailing Fiiips,
the United States since Februrry 1st,
has added to her merchant marine by
tbe seizure of former German and Aus
trian owned ships, a total of 147 ves
sels having a gross tonnage of 656.41.
leaving on the credit side of he Am
erican ledger in the account with the
central powers, a net gain of 51i.f3
gross tons. The loss of life caused by
the sinking of the sixty-nine American
ships was more than 300 persons, how
ever. Percentage Small
Tbe percentage ot sinkings of Amer
ican ships compared with the nuuiber
of vessels which have sailed through
the war zone successfully is small.
Records of the department of com
merce show that for the period begin
ning with February. 1917. and cr-diaq
with December 1. there were cleared
from American ports in the foreign
trade ships aggregating 17.7CS.i" net.
or approximately 24.S34.460 gross ton.
Tbe number of ships making up the
total of tons was not made public
Further offsetting the loss of ton
nage occassioned by the submarine
warfare, the United States, through
the shipping board, requisitioned in
American shipyards 42S vessels total
ing more than 2.000.000 gross tons and
contracts have been awarded tor S4
ships, a large number ot which arc
under way and are being rushed to
completion. In addition, the shipping
board on October 15th. last, placed un
der government requisition 393 Ameri
can vessels of over 2500 tons dead
weight capacity which were already
afloat and immediately assigned them
to the task of carrying supplies for the
allies and the American forces abroad.
Included in these requisitioned ves
sels were twenty-one ships in Great
Lakes trade and in addition thei
were commandeered twenty-four steam
ers building on the lakes for foreign
account and ready for launching, vir
tually all of these were brought to At
lan tic coast ports and immediately put
into service.
Interned Vessels
Another difficulty which faced the
United States in the task of putting to
sea vessels to offset the ravages ot the
U-boats was the repairing of the "wil
ful damage" done to the former Ger
man ships by their officers and crews
before the ships were seized. Tnts
cost millions of dollars and in many
instances called for the highest engi
neering skill to make and replace
parts of foreign built engines and boil
ers removed or broken.
Indicating that the task has been
attended by success, the statement
was made today by a prominent offi
cial connected with the shipping
board., that every seized vessel was
now completely repaired and in ser
vice. Many of them have road's as
many as three and four rouud trips
through the war zone.
Three of the former German vessels
have been the objects ot successful at
tack by the submarines. The Act aeon,
formerly the Adamsturn. and the Ow
asco. formerly the AUemannia. were
sunk, and the Armenia was bit by a
torpedo but was saved after being
beached. Several other former Ger
man ships hare been attacked but es
caped. The announced sinkings of British
ships for the year up to and including
the week ending January 23rd. have
been 1.03J vessels of which 763 were
over 1.600 tons and 270 were under
that figure. The Joint losses of France
and Italy have been averaged three to
tour Urge vessels weekly.

pian to establish a war labor admin -

task confronting him. that of bringing
labor and capital together in an ar

ed tonight. Secretary Wilson will call
on both sides immediately to form a
joint board to meet in Washington to
agree on general principles to govern
their relations during the war. Each i
side will be asked to name five rep.)
resentatives. who in turn will select i
one person each, representing the gen-j
eral public, making a board of tweUe'
members. j
The war labor administration will
be centered in the reorganized and en-j
Urged labor department. Secretary;
Wilson will be supreme labor admin-!

Seven new labor department serv

will be designated: Conditions of la

and transportation and personnel.
Hope for Best
Officials who have studied the war
labor situation express the opinion
that, the labor problem at last is in a
fair way of solution. By having em
ployers and employes agree on the
general principles of their relations
it is hoped to settle all differences
that may arise before they develop
into strikes. Heretofore the policy has
been to take up the situation and at
tempt a settlement after the strikes
are imminent or actually have oc
curred.
The labor problem has given th, t". "c "UT""S 8nou'Q

BIG CORN CROP

Big Surplus.
America Beginning Greatest Corn Con-
sumption in History, Using Cereal
In Many Delicious Dishes,
Corn, America's treat est cereal crop,
is now moving rapidly to market
More than 8,000 million bushels
30 bushels for every man, woman and I
cnIi,i i America were rala4 in 1917. !
It was a mighty crop. The actual In
crease is about 500 million bushels. :
And this extra store of train Is com-
ins on to the market In the nick of .
(tjiunie. Since tne American wneat war-
plus has been sent to neip xeea zamine
tnreatenetl bui-ope.
.49! Just as It bapiened In the Colonial
.OS ! days, tlie War cf the Revolution, and
03 j the Civil War, corn has actually be-
.13 ; come the nation's mainstay.
.. . i In the entire list of America's food
' commodities there is no Item that Is
-10 j better than corn. In puddings, bread,
I corn pone, and as hominy combined
3-95j with meat or eg;s, corn Is without a
.03 ! peer. Housewives are fast learning
-;!the large number of delicious dishes
i that mav IhA hi-tHa irlth corn and :helr
famUles are benefiting by an increas
ed use of the cereal. Corn, more than
anv other cereal, contains all of the
elements essential to maintaining life
and health.
In order that the fighting men
abroad and In the army camps at home

associated with America in the war,
the citizens of America are finding
corn products delicious and palatable
on "wheatless days" and glory In the
fact that "wheatless days" here mean
more wheat for the war worn allied
nations la Europe. I
England, France and Italy must be j
fed frcm America's great storehouse. 1
They will get some corn especially !
Italv but most of their grain ship- j
to use corn Is small compared to the
facilities they have for using wheat
And It Is the opinion of officials In ;
Washington that the present Is no time
to try and change the eating habits of
Europe. '
America's greatest use of corn will
be in the form of corn bread and corn
meal, mixed with wheat la the making
of leavened bread.
Mixed with SO per cent wheat flour,
corn meal can be used In bread mak
Ir.s, producing a loaf more nutritions (
than bread baked with wheat alone.
It Is a fact corn .ml'.lcrs will verify
that dozens of the large American bak
ers have been successfully using a corn
flour In bread maklcs for several
yesrs.

with a poached egg. or eaten at any

other use of corn that will become nn- j
usually popular during the war.
Corn syrup to sweeten corn cake. :
and corn oil for use In all kinds of ;
cooking, are two more products that I
are already welcomed la thousands of ;
American homes. t

RED CROSS NEEDS, IN BISBEE.
Bisbee chapter of the American Red Cross has con
tributed its proportion of fine work to the whole, which
has gone to make confort and care for the American
soldier. The men and women of the Warren District,
officers, committees and members of the organization
hare worked untiringly in the cause. They hare ac
complished much and are now about to start a campaign
which will accomplish more.
The underlying argument for the work womaVa
work of the local Red Cross is the great need for certain
. garments, hospital dressings, clothes and appurtenances
These articles can be manufactured in the greatest and
most widespread workshop In the world the home.Therc
fore it is incumbent that the raw materials should be
provided the worker. It is with this idea in view that
Bisbee will on next Monday, be asked to corribute to
a permanent fund for the support of tne local chapter
of the Red Cross.
Local officials and workers in the Red Cross realize,
more than the mas or woman who attends to his own
business or job and nothing else, that the public does
rot care to be continually asked and urged to give.
Benefits, tag days, entertainments are very well in
their way but the Red Cross is a business organization
and wants its income assured over a period of months.
Efficiency in Red Cross work is the object of the drive.
By that method the giver's contribution can he made
to go so much further in the direction cf providing aid
to the men OTer There.
It is useless to comment on the work of the American
Red Cross. Its fame is as broadcast as the communica
tive mediums of the nation have been able to make it.
It is useless to state that a man 'should give. I! is a
foregone conclusion that everyone win give. The Re.
Cross the local chapter wants the people of the War
ren District to give so much every month.
Thick it over; decide how much your proportion cf
the whole is due the Red Cross every month and wher
a solicitor in the work approaches you, make known
your decision and maintain your name and duty to your
self, your country and to humanity.
BEWARE THE UNIVERSITY.
It is good news that the university regents, in their
last meeting at which Governor Hunt attended, took a
decided stand against the state commission of public
institutions. Governor Hunt is parent to a majority ct
the board of regents and also of the commission. He
must have sensed the direction of the wind and decide 1
it was time that the greatest institution of learning in
the state cf Arizona should be permitted to grow aoi
prosper, unhindered.
The board, without a dissenting -vote, approved he
proposal made by J. B. Lyman to the commission. An
investigating committee, named by the chancellor and
consisting of two old and two new members, reported
that the contractor's agreement was that upon wiich
the beard had agreed upon orally. The regents adopted
the report and decided to stand 'pat.
It is up to the commission to make the next more
Governor Hunt is responsible for the commission an-l
In view of that peace may be in sight between the
regents and the organization. It Is a boon 'devoutly to
be wished.'
In any event Governor Hunt, the regents and the state
commission of public institutions may well look over
the history of Governor Ferguson of Texas. Ferguson
interfered with the university. Hobby is now til gov
ernor of Texas.
COCHISE COUNTY'S DRAFT.
Another proof of Cochise county's attitude toward the
one great Instrument which wiii 'make the world safe
for democracy' selected draft trrice is Lad in the
report of an army examiner to the effect that but two
men of six hundred and more sent to Camp Funstoi
were returned as physically unfit at the time of their
arrival. Since first examination several men from this
county have been discharged from the service. This
has been due. in the whole, not to previous disability
but to diseases contracted after they went Into camp
at Funsion.
In the application of the draft Cochise county proved
itself disinterested and thoroughly patriotic. Bisbee and
Tombstone, particularly, of all of the towns and cities
of the stBte, provided for the care and entertainment
of the drafted men free of charge. The county exemp
tion board served, free of charge. Their expenses cost
the government not one cent. The physicians of the
county contributed their- work and clerical aid was forth
coming on the same basis. As a result the smallest
percaplta cost In the southwest was the record establish
ed.
That the work of the examining physicians was ex
cellent is proven by the last report from the medical
authorities at Camp Funston. Over six hundred men
."iave been sent to the big Kansas cantonment. Twc
men were sent who should have been rejected at home.
This is a record of which the medical fraternity and the
entire county can well feel proud.
Cochise county is again in the midst of draft examina
tions. The same spirit, it is to be hoped, will manifest
itself in the county as during the time of the organiza
tion of the first contingent.
THE NEW DYE INDUSTRY.
, - (New Ycrk Times.)
After the manufacturers, merchants, and chemist?
who represent our new dyestuffs industry had decided
at their recent convention, to form a national association
for co-operation, the adoption of standards and defense
against foreign competition after the war, they took up
the subject of tariff duties The debate was introduced
by Dr. Jones, dyestuffs expert of the Tariff Commission,
who said the commission realized that the new indus
try "presented one of the most important problems
which it would have to consider. It intends to lay be
fore congress a special report, for which it has been
collecting information by thorough inquiry. Duties upon
a majority of the products are now SO per cent, with
small additions In the form of specific rates which may
be discontinued in 1921 if the president finds then that
our domestic output is less than 60 per cent of the
quantity consumed.
The prevailing opinion expressed in the debate was
that the duty should be increased from 30 to SO per cent,
to enable the manufacturers to defend themselves
against sales at very low prices by German producers
after the war. Time is needed for complete develor
ment of the industry. The United States, one delegate
said, "could not be expected to do in three years what
Germany has accomplished In sixty. There were predic
tions that German products, made by cheap labor, would
be offered here at cost or less, to break down our man
ufacturers and regain Germany's old market. In the last
year before the war our imports of coal-tar colors alone
from that country were about $6,000,000.
Those who asked for higher duties did not take into
account our law designed to prevent the dumping here
of foreign products at prices below the cost of manufac
ture and transportation. The present duties, together
with this statute, may be sufficient to defend the new
industry. It is clearly shown by the attitude and in
terest of the Tariff Commission that its recommenda
tions for legislation will be satisfactory to the manufac
turers. The question is one that stands by itself and
it should not be considered strictly in its relation to the
economic requirements of protection Or low tariff as a
national policy. A large sum has been invested in the
making of these dyestuffs, because they were greatly
needed. It is reasonable fcr the investors and manufac
turers to expect that the cation will not permit the in
dustry to be wrecked by attack from Germany. Ameri
can enterprise cannot be encouraged and American in
genuity stimulated in that way. We think the makers
of dyes may be confident that the Tariff Commission
and congress will support them, and that such legislation
as may be required for their safety and welfare will
be approved by the American people.
An academic sociologist. Professor Ross, declares that
the Bolsheviki is a sincere movement That is not hard
to imagine. Perhaps the I. W. W. movement is sincere.
We also remember that a New York newspaper sent a
sociologist to the Warren District to investigate. He
was academic and the whitewash was wonderful.
i
It has been figured out that the pegrs cf tMs coun
try own 20,000,000 acres of land. These figure indicate
how they have advanced in material wealth since the
days of slavery. A share in the soil is an assurance of
patriotism.
Big Bill Haywood, one of the I. W. W. cbiefs say?
there Is nothing in common between the Bolsheviki and
the L W. W. There really ought to be; they are both
working to the same end.
On account of the press of other business we donT
hear much about New Year's resolutions. We don't seem
to have time to spend on theoretic reforms. It is just
as well.
There is a strong movement on in Honolulu for pro
hibition. What they need more there is the prohibition
of the ukelele.
American delay is the kaiser's ally, but we are speed
ing things up. A man's worst enemy is his own shortcoming.
If peace should come suddenly, what would becor.e
of all our colonels and majors mostly of the reserve
eorps.
The latest auto polisn looks and smells very much
like embalming fluid. What is the difference?
The marked-dowli-sale era is about to begin In the
peace parleys. Don't be surprised at anything. -

Dr. L, D. Ricketts, who Is directing
the operation of the Calumet & Ari

Rapid Growth of Warren.
At the town of Warren those inter
ested in the progress and welfar of
that city are more than optimistic
over its future, they are wonderfully,
r
at
enthusiastic and proudly point to the
advancement during the past year as a
reason for their faith in the future.
In the Warren company office James
Cowan, superintendent of the Warren
Street railway, Jesse Yoakum, in
charge of the real estate department
of the company and O. P. Engelder.
cashier, were all of the same op'nion
about Warren and its "future. Each
was courteous in giving out such infor
mation as was desired for this item.
During 1917 one hundred end four
new homes were built in Warren,
ranging in cost from two to twelve
thousand dollars, the total building
account amounting to something more
than a quarter of a million dollars.
These homes were all modern and
none were the result of speculation,
but for the use of those who are
either in business in the Warren dis
trict or are employed by one of the
mining companies.
During the past year three new
school buildings were built to accom
modate the constantly increasing num
ber of school children: the total Cost
of ther buildings amounted to $22,000.
Still another new school building is
Dlanned fcr erection this year. In the
Warren schools are now employed
twelve teachers and the results of
their labor and co-operation with the
parents of the district are said to be
excel Vnt.
The new building of the Calumet &
Arizona hospital, located on the crown
of a hill, just outside the limits of
Warren is now nearing ccmplet'oa at
a con of one hundred thousand dol
lars. It will be one oi the most ircl
ernly eouipped hospitals to be .found
in the southwest and I's pominent Jo
cation will attract th attention of
everyone coming into or passes
through the Warren district.
Street improvement in Warren dur
ing the past year amounted to $21,000
and more than two thousand dollars
were spent in park improvement. The
main city park has now been extend
ed from the ball park to tie Walter
Douglas residence.
From Mr. Engelder it was learned
that there are now four hundred water
connections in Warren, indicating a
population of 1S00 to 2000.

CAMPBELL DEFINITE
IN ANNOUNCING HIS
DECISION TO FIGHT
Tom Shies His Sombrero Into
the Ring for the Governor
ship. Other Bees Busily
Buzzing in State Politics.
The Tucson Citizen, nnder a Phoe
nix date line, says:
Tom Campbell, who has been in
Berkeley where he went to accompany
the remains of Mrs. Campbell's moth
er, is quoted by a San Francisco paper
as saying that be will be a candidate
for governor again this fall "if George
W. P. Hunt or any of his satellites are
candidates on the Democratic ticket."
When Campbell relinquished the office
to court. be invited the Democratic
boss of the state to submit the decis
ion of the court to the people but Hunt
said. "Not me." There are now signs
that Hunt will enter the race. The
fight started by the Commission of
State Instit-Jtions against the Univer
sity has given rise to considerable fear
among the faithful that it would stir
up the old anti-Hunt sentiment. There
was a report here yesterday that Hunt
was going down to Tucson and patch
it up.
Helping Private Outfit
Hunt has taken a great interest In
the completion of the St. John's res
ervoir in Apache county and has made
considerable adoo about it. He has
agreed that the state will loan the
money to complete the project. The
authority of the state to go into part
nership with the Denver outfit which
owns the works is being questioned.
Since Andrew Kimball deserted Hunt
he has been much concerned about
the Mormon support and has taken
this means of offsetting the influence
of Andrew .Kimball. O. S. Stapley and
other Mormon leaders as well as the
ill-advised utterances of John Dunbar,
editor of bis personal organ, with re
spect to the Mormon people.
Harrfc Turned Down
It is an open secret that Adjutant
General Harris went to Washington
with the avowed purpose of enlisting
the assistance of the government in
securing arms and equipment for the
projected National Guard Reserve but
that be was politely and firmly told
that the government could not supply
the same. He was also informed that
whatever local bodies of militia are
created during the war must be under
federal control.
Dicsension in Ranks
To Governor Hunt is given the cred
it of stopping the row between Dave
Johnson and W. M. Moeur, which went
so far as Johnson's asking for Moeur' s
resignation as land commissioner.
Johnson wants to run for member of
the corporation commission to suc
ceed A. W. Cole and is bidding for the
Hunt support. Sam Proctor, who with
Door
drew last year in favor of Betis.
claims to be entitled to the Hunt sup
port also for this office. He is about
to open a vigorous campaign. Cole
will be a candidate to succeed him
self. Another Bee Buzzing
There is some talk that F. A. Jones
may enter the race for governor if it
becomes a free for all with Roberts
and Cobb in the game. Jones, who is
chairman of the corporation commiss
ion, is "considering the views of hi
friends who are urging him to run."
Sid Osborn has not posi'iver commit
ted himself as a candidate for gover
nor but is waiting to sc tow the wind
blows. One thing is certain. He will
not mlthdraw in favor of Oi!ter.
Mitt Sims wants to rcn for secreta
ry of state, but the pi in is to side
track him with the nomination for
treasurer.
Jack Bolin. mine inspector, wants to
run for the tax commission against
Rudolph Kuchler, appointed by Tom
Campbell. There is an interesting
question as to whether there will be
an election for this office. Knrhler
was appointed to fill out Campbell's
unexpired term. This term does not
expire until 1920. Both Campbell and
Zander were elected for six years. The
failure to hold an election in 1912
broke the sequence and there is there
fore no commissioner whose term ex
pires this year. Additional legislation
would probably throw out Kucble in
case of a special session.
The Gubernatorial Muddle
Wiley Jones is not a serious candi
date for governor. He will have his
hands full getting the nomination tor
attorney general with Strucfcmever,
backed by Hunt, in the race. The Hunt
support is going more and more to
Colter and it is said that Osborn has
made overtures to E. E. Ellinwood and
other conservative Democratic leaders
for their support, hoping thereby y
keep Sutter of Cochise out of the run
ning. Hunt is not impressed with bol
ter's strength and would have preferr
ed Homer Wood but with the assist
ance of his army of appointees, he has
been gradually drifting to Colter,
whose sack is very attractive to the
faithful.
The State Highway Department has
declared its independence and purpos
es to run Cobb. This is a serious dis
affection because this department
spends hundreds of thousands of dol
lars and employs several thousand
men. Its support is needed by Colter.

worked by Mr. Smith, yielding a hand
some profit. Mr. Smith said that toe
