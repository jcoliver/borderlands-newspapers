WASHINGTON, Jan. 17. The en
tente allies, in a note addressed by
Arthur Balfour, British foreign min
ister, to Ambassador Spring-Rice, and
delivered to the state department to
day, amplifies their reply to President
Wilson's peace note, by explaining Hi
detail why they believe it impossible
at present to attain a peace which
will assure them such, guarantees as
they consider essential. The note ex
plains why the allies demand the ex
pulsion of Turkey from Europe; re
storation of Alsace-Lorraine to France,
of Italia-lrredenta to Italy, and the
other territorial changes set forth.
Though the future peace of the
world may be insured by international
treaties and international laws, the
note says, they have ill learned the
lessons taught by recent history. After
charging that German influence in
Turkey had resulted in conditions as
barbarous and more aggressive than
were known under Sultan Abdul
Hamid and that it had been slfbwn
Germany cannot be expected to pay
obligations, Mr. Balfour says:
Needs More than Treaty.
"So long as Germany remains the
Germany which w ithout a shadow of
justification overran and barbarously
ill-treated a country it was pledged to
defend, no state can regard its rights
as secure if they have no better pro
tection than a solemn treaty."
Asserting that Belgium was not !
Germany's only victim, the note re
cites the "reign of terror" attendant
upon Germany's method of warfare

"The war staffs of the central pow
ers are well content to horrify the
world if at the same time they can
terrorize it." The people of Great
Britain. Mr. Belfour says, share Presi
dent Wilson's desire fur peace but do
not believe it can be durable unless
based on the success of the allied
cause. Such a peace, it is argued, can
not be expected unless these three
conditions are fulfilled:
Essentials of Peace.
Existing causes of international un
rest shall be so far as possible re
moved or weakened; the aggressive
aims and the unscrupulous methods
of the central powers should fall inPj
disrepute among their own peoples:
and finally that behind nietrnational

WASHIXGTOX, Jan. 17. Retention
of all existing navy yards, establish

lantic, Gulf and Pacific coasts, and
a thorough aeronautical survey of the
coasts of the United States and its
possessions were recommended to
congress today in a preliminary re
port by a special commission of naval
officials appointed by President Wil
son. " .
The commission consisted of Rear
Admiral J. M. Helm, Chief Construc
tor W. L. Capps, Civil Engineer H.
H. Rousseau, Captain O. W. McElroy
and Commander C L. Hussey.
It spent several months making in
spections along the coasts and an
nounced today that further investigat
ing would be necessary before com
plete reports can be made on many
questions.
Abolish None, They Ask
On the abolishment of navy yards
the report recommended:
"That it is unnecessary, undesirable
and inadvisable to abolish at this
time any existing navy yard or naval
station within the continental limits
of the United States." In arriving at
this conclusion the commission says
that "full consideration of the pres
ent and prospective size of our na.vy,
its requirements not only in peace
but during the far more exacting con
ditions of war should bring convinc
ing evidence that abolishment at this
time of existing naval yards of naval
stations would be without justifica
tion." The reports explain that this should
not be taken to mean that there might
not be transfer of work from one yard
to another or changes in methods of
handling work at certain plants. It
declares that the present equipment
of many yards is inadequule in dry
docking facilities, berthing space,
storage facilities, machinery and oth
er details.
Yards Far Inadequate
"It Is not only unequal for the re
quirements of the fleet," says the re
port, "but will be seriously inadequate
for its proper maintenance when the
fleet is completed to its present au
thorized strength."
Xot all the yards "are ideally lo
cated." to meet strategic and other
requirements, but the commission
concludes that such consideration
must "have little force" in view of
actual conditions and the actual re
quirements of the present and pros
pective fleet.

statement that a greater concentra
tion of yards would be economical,

ered to employ counsel and expert
stock exchange accountants, and give
I 30 days longer to report, the House
rules committee today temporarily
halted its peace note leak hearings
to consider what lawyer shall be
sought to direct the broadening in
quiry. It was announced that there
would be no public session tomorrow
and probably no other testimony will
be heard until the new plans have
been perfected and counsel familiar
ized with the situation.
Action by the house in granting
counsel followed statements on the
floor by Democratic members of com
mittee that they already were embar
rassed as investigators in view of the
dragging in of names of high govern
ment officials. Representative Gar
rett, speaking for the committee, an
nounced that for this reason the com

judicial attitude with special counsel
to direct the investigation and to in

During the debate in the house both

Highest Honors Ever Paid.
Naval officers said tonight that prob

that provided for Admiral Dewey in

to American vessels and shore stations
everywhere.
Secretary's Note to Navy.
"It is with feeling of genuine grief,"
the order said, "that the secretary of
the navy announces the death at 5:56
p. ni. yesterday at his residence in
Washington of the admiral of the
navy..
"The career of George Dewey "ran
in full current to the end.' Vermont
was his mother state and there was
always in his character something l
the granite of his native hills. Dewey
was under fire with Farragut in the
Missfssippi river and bore nimself gal
antly throughout the war between the
states.
Hero of Manila.
"The battle in Manila Bay on May
1, 1898, made him the foremost naval
officer since Farragut and victor of
the first American sea fight with a
foreign foe since the war of If 12.
" 'Gentleman of a higher power than
we has won this battel Coday,' the
commodore said to his captains at the
conclusion of the battle when it had
been learned that the victory, one ol
the most decisive in our history, had
been won without the loss of a single
American seaman. In peace, in war,
in sickness, in health, in victory, and
in conflict and in every relation of
life Admiral Dewey invariably exhibit
ed the virtues of the patriot and the
Christian.
Long Life of Service,
i "His whole life, 62 years of which
were spent in the navy, was full of
honorable achievement, and his serv
ice in peace has been hardly less dis

a leading part in making the nation

sanction should be devised which
would give pause to the hardest ag
gressor. It is ret'Jgnized that these condi
tions may be difficult of fulfillment,
but the belief is expressed that they
are in general with President Wilson's
ideas. The note declares in confidence
that so far as Europe is concerned
none of the conditions can be satis
fied, even imperfectly, unless peace is
secured on the general lines indicated
by the allies' joint note.
Pleases Washington.
Great Britain's bote wasT entirely
unexpected by officials here but was
gratifying because they interpreted it
as a step toward the wVirld federation
to preserve peace which President
Wilson, both in his speeches and in
his peace note, has pledged the United
States.
Just What Wilson Wants.
Great Britain justifies her continu
ance of hostilities, it was pointed out,
not only for the immediate, object of
the war but also of the necessity that
"behind international law and behind
all treaty arrangements Tor preventing
or limiting hostilities some form of
international sanction should be de
vised which would give pause to the
hardest aggressor."
It is just some such arrangements.

it was pointed out, which President J
Wilson has been urging and which Is
expected to cause wider disagreement
in American foreign policy than any j
other question raised in the country's
history. Great Britain's answer was
interpreted as her official acceptance
and endorsement of the President's
proposal. '
Text of Note
The text of Mr. Balfour's note,
dated January 13 and addressed to
Sir Cecil says in part:
"In sending you a translation of the
allied note I desire to make the fol
lowing observations which you should
bring to the notice of the United
States government.
"I gather from the general tenor
of the president's note that while he
is animated by an intense desire that
peace should come soon and that when
it comes it should be lasting, be does
not for the moment at least, concern
himself with the terms on which it
should be arranged. His majesty's
government entirely shares the pres
ident's ideas; but they feel strongly
that the durablity of peace must
largely depend on its character and
no staple system of international re
lations can be built on foundations
which are essentially and hopelessly
defective.
Consider War's Cause
"This becomes clearly apparent if
we consider the main conditions
which rendered possible the calami
ties from which the world is now suf
fering. These were the existence of
great powers consumed with the lust
of domination in the midst of a com
munity of nations ill-prepared for de
fense, plentifully supplied indeed, with
International laws, but with no mach
inery for enforcing them and weak
ened by the fact that neither the
boundaries of the various states nor
their internal construction harmon
ized with the aspirations of their con
tinent races or secured to them just
and equal treatment
"Tha tthis last evil would be greatly
mitigated if the allies secured the
changes in the map of Europe out
lined in their joint note is manifest,
and I need not labor the point.
To Expel Turkey
"It has been argued indeed that the
expulsion of the Turks from Europe
forms no proper or logical part of
this general scheme.. The mainte
nance of the Turkish empire was dur
ing many generations regarded as es
sential to the maintenance of Euro
pean peace. Why, It is asked, should
the cause of peace be now associat
ed with a complete reversal of this
traditional policy?
"The answer is that circumstances
have completely changed. It is un
necessary to consider, now whether
the creation of a reformed Turkey
mediating between hostile races in
the near east was a (scheme which,
bad the sultan been sincere and the
powers united, could ever have been
realized, it certainly fannot be real
ized now.
Germanized Turkey Bad
The Turkey of 'Union and Prog
ress' is at least as barbarous and is
far more aggressive than the Turkey
of Sultan Abdul Hamid. In the hand
of Germany it has ceased even in ap
pearance to be a bulwark of peace
and is openly used as an instrument
of conquest. Under German officers
Turkish soldiers are now fighting in
lands from which tbey had long been
expelled and a Turkish government
controlled, subsidized Vnd supported
by Germany has beeu'guilty of. mas
sacres in Armenia ami Syria 'more
horrible than any recorded in the his
tory even of those unhappy countries.
Evidently the interests or peace and
the claims of nationality alike re
quire that Turkish rule over alien
j races, shall, if possible, be brought
1 to an end; and we may hope that the
, expulsion of Turkey from Europe will
' contribute as much to' the cause of
peace as the restoration of Alsace
Lorraine to France or Irredenta to
Italy or any of the other territorial
changes indicated in the allied note.
Want Security in Peace
"Evidently, however such territor
ial re-arrangements, though they may
diminish the reasons, at war, provide
no sufficient security against its re
currence. If Germany or rather those
in Germany who mould its opinions
and control its destinies, again set
out to domineer the world, they may
find that by the new order of things
the adventure is made more diffi
cult but hardly that it is made im
possible. They may still have ready
to their hands a perfect system or
ganized through and through on a
military basis: thoy may Btill arru
mul.ito vast stores of hiilitary equip
ment; they may Mill persist in their
methods of attack, so their more
pacific, neighbors will be struck down
before they can prepare themselves
for defense. If so. Europe, when the
war is over, will be far poorer in
men, in money and in mutual good
will than it was when the war be
gan, but it will not be pafer; and thq
hope for the future of the world en
tertained by the president will be as
fp.r as ever from fulfillment.
Must Purge Germany
"So long as Germany remains the
Germany which without thadow of
justification overran and barbarously
ill-treated a country it was pledged
to defrud, no ijt;iU can regarij jta
rights as secure if they have no bet
ter protection than a solemn treaty.
Why Allies "Should Win"
"Though the people of this coun
try share to the full the desire of
the president for peace they do not

NKW YOnK. Jan. 17. In retalia
tion lor the anion of the Players' Fra
ternity in refusing to grain its play
ers permission to sign. Presidents
John Tenor of the National League
and Han I'. Johnson of the American
League has decided that hereafter
their leagues will refuse to recognize
the players' fraternity or to have any
dealings with it, it was announced
here today. President Johnson left
this afternoon for Chicago. "We
cctlld take no other action," said
President Tenor. "We can no longer
have dealings with an organization
which is ktiihy of the rank injustice
or the present action of the frater
nity in attempting to interfere with,
hurt and ruin our business.
"Hereaftef the clubs will have to
dial with their players individually
and we can no longer deal with any
outside body.
"Ity its strike threat the fraternity
has of itself broken the agreement we
drew up with it in 1913 when numer
ous concessions were granted to the
players. The fact that the fraternity
admits the big leagues have treated
it fairly and squarely have kept all
'. their pledges.and that it has absolute
ly no grievance aeainst them, made
rucli action on our- pari inevitable."
Whtn he learned that the major
j leagues considered their agreement
j with the fraternity broken and would
no longer recognize it. President
Fultz of the fraternity said:
"Thy will be only too glad to rec
ognize us after this case conies to
a head. Perhaps organized baseball
would rather deal direct with organ
ized labor which can know nothing
of the fundamentals of baseball, as
the reserve clause, the release, clause
and other basebll factors. I also can
see how long organized baseball will
attempt to fight the American Feder
ation of Iibor and attempt to play
semi-professional players as strike
breakers. They had better give in
now as the situation is growing more
tense all the time."
The National league announced it
had promulgated the contracts of
John Murray and C. A. Causey, both
I of whom signed with the New York
j club. Murray was formerly a frater
I nity member. Causey is a young pit
cher drafted from Waco. He Is not

"THE ARGONAUTS OF
CALIFORNIA" OPEN IN
THE DISTRICT TODAY
Exciting Story of the Early
Days of the Golden States
Told in Film, to Be Shown
at Lowell Theatre Today.
The recent death of Colonel 7.ak
Webster at San Antonio, Texas, at the
age of 91, removes one of the last of
the old time gamblers of California's
golden days of M!. Colonel Webster
was a well known figure in San Fran
ciscAj sixty odd years ago and stories
of his nerve at the gambling tables,
his physical courage and his rigid
honesty are still extant. He was ex
actly the type who figured in Bret
Harte's stories of bonanza days, hand
some, daring, almost foppish in his
dress, polished in his manners and well
educated.
Very few of Colonel Webster's con
temporaries are still living and the
generation t which he belongs seetus
as far removed from the present day
as the gay heads of White's and AI
mack's name made' the life of London
picturesque in the days of Charles
Fox and Horace Walpole. Among the
most interesting characters who ap
pear in Edward L. Grafton's stirring
ten-reel drama, "The Argonauts of
California", are the gambling princes
of early San Francisco. . They lived
intensely, played high, kept strictly to
a certain code of honor and left their
impress on the life of the period in
many ways. Some of the tales of
their feats at the gambling table are
almost unbelievable. Hittel, the his
torian, tells of single bets of five to
ten thousand dollars on a single num
ber at roulette and gives one instance
where a newly rich gambler wagered
sixteen thousand dollars on the turn
of a card at faro.
"The Argonauts of California,, which
will be shown at the Lowell theatre
today and which appears at the Or
pheum Friday and Saturday, pictures
this life perfectly.

AJO STRIKE LESSON.
Self-respecting, self-helping and fair-minded LABOR
has asserted itself at Ajo, the seat of the New Cornelia
Mining Company's operations, and because of its ex
emplary conduct has suppressed an incident which might
have cast a stain on industry in Arizona. The relief
afforded to the New Cornelia Company is incomparable
to the relief which Arizona must feel in the knowledge
that other than local forces can be depended upon to en
force justice in labor disputes.
It was known from the beginning of the trouble at Ajo
that " malevolent agitators were responsible. These
troublemakers, looking solely to the fattening of their
pocketbooks or obsessed by vagaries which work much
iharm to honest breadwinners, succeeded in creating dis
sention and lor a few days crippled progress in construc
tion plans.
The matter was brought to the attention of national
organizations and heads of labor made as prompt investi
gations as possible. The last of these inquiries has been
completed with the result that all union structural steel
men have returned to work. National President McGlory
made a personal visit to Ajo and at the conclusion of hii
inspection declared that no cause or authority ever ex
isted for a walkout and that the Western Federation had
no legal jurisdiction.
It must be bourne in mind that the men repeatedly
Toted to go back to their occupations after November 20,
but they were restrained by Arizona organizers of the
Western Federation. Political satraps who have lent
encouragement to these organizers will undoubtedly soon
learn that Arizona is not a fertile ground for such scenes
of lawlessness, such iniquities against honest breadwin
ners as have brought other localities into disrepute.
Previous to the Ajo trouble, leeches of honest labor
sought to renew strife in the Meronci District Federal
Investigator Myers made an investigation, anathemized
the agitators and gave warning that he did not propose
to visit the District again to patch up the harm they had
wrought.
The return to work of the steel workers at Ajo com
pletes the establishment of harmony among the members
of all national organizations and a full complement is r.ow
busy with operations which, when completed, will furnish
remunerative and steady employment to the heads of
hundreds of families. The cause of lalxjr is vastly ad
vanced by such honorable actions as were taken at Ajo
by the heads of national organizations.
DEWEY'S DEATH.
While the death of Admiral Dewey carries its own sor
row and sense of loss to the Nation, it brings forcibly to
mind the fact that another has been added to the fast
increasingg list of really big contemporary Americans,
men of the present day who have done worth while things
in OUR day and now have completed their labors.
No man in the present generation has added more
lustre to the fame of our navy, to the prowess of the
Yankee's fighting spirit than Admiral Dewey. His achieve
ment at Manila will take a high place in history. The
occasion called for indomitable bravery, for a prompt de
cision fraught with the gravest consequences. His cour
age met the test nobly and his decision not only preserved
the material interests of his country but also conserved
its honor.
While the fight in Manila Day supplied the crowiiiii?
achievement of his career as measured by popular stand
ards, his subsequent labors contributed no less materially
to the lasting services which he performed for our coun
try. His one thought as he lay on his deathtied had to do
with a prolongation of life in order that he wight add

himself consecrated. It mattered not to liini that he had

JOBS FOR CONVICTS.
The hounding of criminals by the police is an old
story. From the time when a special group of citizens
was set apart for the purpose of suppressing crime there
has been an incessant feud between the police and the
criminals. The resulting evils were immortalize"d half
a century ago in Hugo's great story of Jean Valjean, the
convict who, having once broken human law, was re
lentlessly pursued by an avenging representative of the
law at every stage of his career. The system has per
severed even to the present day, with all our boasted
penal reforms. In almost every city in America a man
once convicted of a crime is ever afterward regarded
with suspicion. From the day when he leaves the prison
the police stand ready, even eager, to catch him and
drag him back.
That relentless disapproval, which so often becomes
persecution, is, however, slowly passing away. And the
most striking evidence of the new attitude comes from
New York 'City, where it might have been least ex
pected. Police Commissioner Wood announces that in the past
year 700 ex-convicts have been put in places of respect
able employment in the metropolis, not only with the
sanction of the police, but through their active efforts.
The police department actually got jobs for those con
victs and helped them to make good.
"There has been no sentimentality about it," says the
commissioner. "There is no time for sentiment in the
police department. We have done it because we believe
this is one of the very best ways of preventing crime."
Preventing crime by getting jobs for the criminals!
Isn't it a perfectly sensible and logical thing to do? And
how long it has taken society to find it out!
WATERPOWER AND PETROLEUM.
Gifford Pinchot has sounded another alarm in defense
of our natural resources. He insists that the Shields
and Myers bill now pending in congress will, if enacted,
surrender to private interests vast wealth belonging to
the nation.
The people, he says, still hold control of some 73,000,
000 horsepower, enough to supply all the nt'ds of a
population twice a large as ours today. He fears lest
this great property, so vital to our future welfare, be
given away to "waterpower interests who already,
through a series of groups of related power interests,
constitute what might be called a federated trust, divid
ing the territory of the United States among its mem
bers." He says that the men concerned threaten,
through their control of power, to "get their hands upon
all users of power upon transportation, industry and
light"
He also condemns the Phelan amendment which, he
says, would turn into private hands the petroleum re
serves set aside by presidential proclamation for the use
of the navy. The oil is needed as fuel for our warships.
Most citizens know little of the merits of these meas
ures. There is, however, in the mind of every "man sin
cerely interested in the preservation of our public re
sources for public benefit a natural suspicion whenever
it is proposed to give away another slice of our patri
mony. Just now the public, like the private interests, is
especially concerned with waterpower. There ought to
be the fullest publicity regarding all these bills. And
needless to say, neither waterpower nor petroleum ought
to be turned over for private development without pre
serving essential public rights and guaranteeing a proper
public share of the profits.
OUR ZEAL FOR PEACE.
One good effect at least has come from the recent
peace flurry. It has been brought forcibly to the knowl
edge of all nations that the American people ardently
desire the end of the present struggle. And while Hum
desire may be criticised by angry belligerents, aud tho
efforts made by the president and by various other of
ficial and unofficial representatives may be denounced
as untimely meddling, the net effect is a moral justifica
tion of our war attitude throughout
For two years Europe has flaunted our war profits in
our faces. Both- sides have bitterly scored us for making
money out of their misfortune. Our huge war orders,
necessary as they were to the purchasers, were regarded
as a moral reproach to America. It has been intimated
countless times by European critics that our peace pro
fessions were insincere that we really wanted the war
to continue indefinitely for the sake of perpetuating our
war profits, and even wanted the belligerents to crush
each other and exhaust themselves so that we should
inert less rivalry hereafter in our quest for worl.l
markets. In the face of this belief, it lias been made apparent
that we welcome peace even if the wars end should end
our prosperity.
Our material interests hardly enter into the sentiments
of the nation. That fact is dawning on the belligerents.
And perhaps we can afford to have tliem criticise us for
excessive zeal in promoting peace, as long as they stop
accusing us of deliberately capitalizing the war for our
own advantage.
No doubt Russia has too many mad monks, but t
ought not to be necessary to kill them.

The first official statement given
out cere regarding the raider are
Vj the effect that seven vessels
had been sunk and nine captured.
In the communication to the min
ister of marine, the captain of the
Pernambuco declared that he had
learned the raider had also sunk
eight French vessels, which were
also reported merely captured.
The fate of the crews of these is
not known.
It is reported that the raider
placed these crews on board the
British steamer Yarrowdale, which
then piVceeded for port. It Is
therefore believed that they would
be safely landed within a day or
two. Another report has been re
ceived that the steamer St. Theo
dore has been transtornied into a
raider.
The consulates at Pernambuco
are devoting much attention to the
care of the shipwrecked crews.
There is no confirmation of the
alleged loss of four hundred lives.

after news was received of the Ger-j

' the sailing of the Chicago would be '
postponed until tomorrow morning, i
Officials of the French line, however, j
assured them that the delay was not j
due to fears of the raider, whose ac- j
Uvilies they said seemed to be con- j
fined to the South Atlantic, but to
difficulty in obtaining coal.

SO INHUMAN AS
BRITISH INFER
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BERLIN, Jan. 17. An official de
nial of some of the allegations made
by the 'British admiralty concerning
the sinking by a German submarine
of the British steamer Westminister
on December 18, was issued today. It
Quotes portions of the British state
ment in which charges were made
that the Westminster was attacked
without warning, was struck by two
torpedoes and that a "deliberate at
tempt was made to murder the sur-
ivors" by shelling the boats in which
they took refuge, and that the mas
ter and some of the crew were killed
while two other foreigners were be
lieved to have been drowned. The
German note says:
'"Contrary to this the report of the
commander of the submarine being
now at hand, it is stated that only one
torpedo was discharged; that the sub
marine did not fire a single cannon
shot and that when the submarine
emerged after firing the torpedo, the
Westminster had sunk.
"The report that the Westminster's
crew was shelled when they tried to
save themselves from the sinking ship
therefore is an invention.
"After the Westminster sank the.
submarine attempted to approach the
small boats, but sighted a patrol
steamer, the approach of which made
the work of rescue impossible. The
consideration of its own safety, was
compelled to leave.
"The report of the British admiralty
therefore is untrue in all its details
and the intention to influence public
opinion is clearly written on its
face."

T. R. PAYS GLOWING
TRIBUTE TO DEWEY
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Jan. 17. Tribute to
Admiral Dewey, as "an officer, a gen
tleman, and a patriotic American,"
was paid by Theodore Roosevelt in
a statement here tonight..
"Admiral Dewey was one or the fin
est figures in American life," said
Mr. Roosevelt, "and no other single
service by any American living ranks
with the service he rendered this
country on that May morning in Man
ila bay. He was as typical an Amer
ican fighting sailor man; as typical
a deepwater and shoalwater admiral
as Farragut himself.
"In as much as he was a typical
American naval officer it is hardly
necessary to say that together with
undauutless courage and single mind
ed devotion to the flag he combined
chivalric gentleness to the weak and
the oppressed. He was equally in
capable of submitting to wrong treat
ment by the strong and inflicting
wrong treatment on the weak.
"In the highest meaning of the
terms he was an officer, a gentleman
and a patriotic American."

which caused marked restraint In to

Taking four parallel themes, all
built upon the same superstructure
of thought, from four different peri
ods of the world's history, Griffith
brings home to a modern pudience,
is nothing else has been able to do,
the great curse of Intolerance. What
misery it has brought to the world
in the past, what civilizations it has
destroyed, what evil it has done and
vhat it is doing today, is part and par
cel of this great picture.
"Intolerance" is not a picture. Tt
is an epic of the greatest moderfi
industry of entertainment. The gen
eral public can not conceive of a play,
a preachment, the greatest sermon
any preacher has given to his coun
try, on mere film, being , worth the
price that is charged. Wtvat a reva- 1
lation is it to partake of the beau
ties of this production, to see its
net of ! wonderful spectacles, woven into its i
very fabric, and to sink in a conscious
unconsciousness of utter and complete
interest, from which the awakening
brings a realization of Intolerance. It i

the outbreak of the war the church
had been attempting practically the
impossible effort to administer all

present conditions and the demand
the work had now been divided be

In support of -.Miss Frederick there
appear several very well-known play
ers, among them Alan Hale, Mari
Chambers, Paul Gordon, and Clarence
Handysides.
Famous Players Film Compa
ny Presents Wonderful Act
ress in Adaptation of Play.
"The Woman in the Case."
, Reautiful Pauline Frederick has w'jn.
her greatest reputation as an actress,
both on the stage and on the motion
picture screen, in the roles of women
of the world, as in "Rella Donna." "The
Spider," "Joseph and his Rrethern,"
and other great plays in which she
has starred. It is, therefore particu
larly interesting to nte that, in the
Famous Players adaptation of Clyde
Fitch's great drama. "The Woman in
the Case," which is the Paramount
Picture at the Royal today. Miss
Frederick, though starred In the pro
duction, does not nlay the role of the
Woman, in which Blanche Walsh
scared such a success on the stage, but
appears as Margaret, the self-sacrificing
wife who pits herself against
the Woman in the struggle to save
her husband from the charge of mur
der.
Though the role of Clarie Foster has
always been the stellar one on the
stage, the struggle between the two
women is so fierce they are so evenly
matched that they are equally inter
esting. It was Miss Frederick's own
suggestion that she play Margaret, de
snite theatrical tradition, and the
change was rapidly adopted by the
producers. Since a little more time
is devoted to the development of Mar
garet's character in the motion picture
than on the stage, the very happv re
sult is a lightening t the tone of the
entire production, fbr she is one of
the sweetest and noblest characters
of contemporary literature.
"I have played so many women of
the world." declared Miss Frederick
in voicing her wish to play Margaret,
"that I am afraid peonle will begin
to think I can do nothinc else and
that I r?ally must be .ne of that var
iety in private life. So I am particu
larly anxious to play an entirely dif
ferent character not to satisfy my
own vanity, but to go permanently on
record as having the ability to play
roles other than those of the vampire
type. I want to sh.w people that I
have other emotions in my system
than those of the worldly sort."
The dominant note in "The Woman
in the Case" Is that of wifely self
sacrifice. Margaret Hughes, before
marrying a very wealthy rhan nam"-!
Julian Rolfe. learns that he has had
an affair with Claire Foster but broke
with her upon learning that he wsi
by no means the only man in her life.
Margaret has been big enouRh to for
give Julian for his folly and when
