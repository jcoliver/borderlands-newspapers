the sectors then held by American j
troops. This statement rests on the
highest authority and was 'made to- j
night with fulF recognition of all fail-.
nres and disappointments that have j
hampered the development of tne all !
program. v
Facts and figures on the aviation sit
uation as well as every other branch j
of the government's wai preparation, j
were laid toda before virtually the
house military committee as yesterday i
they were disclosed to the senate com-1
mittee. Acting Secretary Crowell !
again presided at the rooms of the war
council at the ar department where
the new policy of taking congress di
rectly into the confidence of the exec
utive branch of the government was j
launched. i
The comment of Representative
Kahn of California, ranking republican !
member of the house committee, ex- j
pressed the sentiment of the house
members on the new policy. He said
it means team work by the whole gov
ernment on the enormous prcblems
that face it. The figures revealed to
the committee the immediate, currert
demands of the war program, and the
progress made in meeting the'.i. hi
added, made it clear 'that the country
was unaware of the enormity of 'Aa un
dertaking.
Mr. Kahn predicted that great rc
suits could be looked for from now on
if the weekly conferences with the leg
islative committees are continued. I.
was disclosed to the committee mer
bers that the aviation program i fnr
short of what had been hoped for. F'g
ures estimating lhe deficiency in per-1

such method of calculations has been

Mr. 'iountree is on his way to the
Pacific coast and is looking over the
route through iKiuglas and Bisbee as
well as the projesed route through
Globe which the business men of th"
northern city ara boosting as the logl
cal route for the highway. With Mr
Rountree on the trip is C. H. Lester,
founder of the borderland route.
The Cnited States good roads assf
ciatio.1 and the American automobile
association will hold a joint meeting
at Little Rock. Ark., on April 13 to 19
when a final decision will be reache
on the best rou3 for the military high
way. In .ij effort to further the interests
of this city and Douglas and to try anc"
insure the road coming over the south
ern or borderland route it is pro ball?
that the Bisbee and Douglas chambers
of commerce will have a personal rep
resentative present at the meeting in
Little Kock as i-ecuring the highway
throua this city will mean hundreds
of thousands of dollars of added buH
ness tc this section since it will bring
hundreds and thousands of automobile
tourists making the coast to coast
trip bie.
It believed that the plans now un
der way to build a highway between
Douglas and Bisoee at a cost of a half
million dollars -ind the fact that tt?
county will spend another half million
on otntr roads will have considerable
bearing on the cc: nces of securing the
military highway for the borderland
route.

KERRIGAN TO APPEAR
IN "A MAN'S MAN" AT
ORPHEUM PLAYHOUSE
.One of the most vitally interesting,
heart-gripping and stirring photo plays
which has ever oeen placed before the
American theatre public will be shown
at the Orpheum theatre today and Sun
day. when J. Warren Kerrigan will ap
pear in the dramatization of Peter B.
Kyne's "A Man's Man." The feature
is one of the most recent Triangle re
leases, and is hailed as one of the best
motion pictures ever screened.
The story of "A Man's Man" is fa
miliar to most readers of fiction. It is
the story of tha man who fights the
merciless louts of hellish breed, who
stakes his life on the aim of his gun.
who f.ghts for friendship and for love,
but who always and ever fights fair.
It is the story of a real man. and in its
dramatization there is more action
than In the Niagara Falls, more stuff
than in an encyclopedia, and a song of
love aa tender ap a sprig of thistle
down blown by the gentle gust of an
autu-nn breeze.
The Christy Minstrels continue to
draw a good crowd at the Orpheum
where they have been showing for th
past several days.

How Germany Feels
About the War j
Why did Germany turn back, at the
Marne instead .of pressing on and taking
Paris ? ' The question has been asked often
and there are many answefs. The answer
of Baron von Freytag-Loringhoven, assist
ant to the German staff, is not without in
terest. According to the Hon. Baro'n, "it
would have taken very little to turn the.
scale so that victory might have fallen to us
and a retreat avoided; but the really de
cisive factor was that the German offensive
was no longer strong enough to break
through in the face of an enemy country
bristling with armament."
This is a naive and remarkable admis
sion; one of the few authentic statements
that have come frcm within the iron ring.
It reveals the true German military and of
ficial view after three years of war. Of
course, to the average reader of the de
cisive events of the Great War, the reasons
for the retreat of the German armies at the
Marne, are found in the fierce and resolute
fighting powers of the French poilus; the
terrible onslaught cf the Black Watch regi
ment, which there gained the sinister sob
riquet from the Germans themselves of
"the ladies of hell;" the generalship of Jof
fre in picking his battleground; the deter
mination of General Foch to advance after
he was beaten; the debouching of a fresh
army from Paris itself. These were the
factors that decided the Marne and saved
France. These incidents, woven into a
whole, cost Germany the only chance she
had to win the war.
Again, turning to the pages of this Ger
man baron's book, which was suppressed
by the. German government, but too late,
it fs found that the German military view
of the war at this time is simply one of vain
regrets and bitter disappointment over com
ing so close and yet not quite achieving the
victory. The lesson of this wr to Germany
is not a true awakening to the horror and
wrong of the war, but rather an experience
by which she may profit to win the next
time. Disappointment, but not discourage
ment. Rage eating ward, but no remorse.
Wrath . that is balked, but no repentance. ,
A longer, stronger spring next time. Listen
to this German baron's pleasant prattle. It
sounds like the beating of spears upon brass
shields. He says :
"Will not the general exhaustion of
Europe after the world conflagration of a
certainty put the danger of a new war, to
begin with, in the background, and does not
this terrible slaughter of nations point in
evitably to the necessity of disarmament to
pave the way to permanent peace ?" In his
reply we have the whole German viewpoint
summed up: "A lasting peace is guaran
teed only by strong, armaments .
Moreover world power is inconceivable
without striving for expression of power in
the world. A long peace, such as
that which preceded the world war, had
frequently caused us to overlook the fact
that it was not the fine phrases about inter
national bliss and brotherhood uttered on
every occasion at public meetings which
preserved us from war, but the might of our
sword." And he adds this significant state
ment which the sentimentalists will do well
to remember: "And it will only be by this
might that we shall be able to safeguard
our peace in the future
"If at the Marne no decisive victory fell
to our share and our strength proved insuf
ficient to vanquish France, we mut none
the less consider that up to the Marne we
had achieved enormous things.
Certainly it would have taken very little to
, turn the scale so that the victory might
have fallen to us and a retreat been avoid
ed. But the really decisive factor ws that
German offensive was no longer strong
enough to break through on the fact of an
enemy country bristling with armaments.
The withdrawal of the German armies after
the dazzling successes which had been
achieved at the beginning could not but in
the nature of things cause fitter disappoint
ment at home.'
What is the favorite song or the Ameri
can soldiers in France? Some of the cor
respondents declare that George Cohan's
"Over There" is sung the most. Others
say that Carrie Jacobs Bond's ,'End of a
Perfect Day" is the song of songs with the
doughboys. But now come3 word from
Aix-les Bains, the historic old town where
the United States troops are quartered after
going off trench duty, to the effect that the
Joan of Arc song has come to be the Amer
ican national anthem in France. We might
"well have a worse one. It is a noble song.
The music swells out like a thant and the
words thrill like a battle call. "It is a favor
ite with all the men and it is heard every
where," declares this special writer. The
chorus is as sweet and as brave as the war
rior maid herself. You have doubtless read
it, but read it again:
Jean of Arc, Joan of Arc,
Po your eyes, from the skies.
See the foe?
Don't you see the drooping fleu-de-lis?
Don't you see the tears of Normandy?
Joan of Arc, Joan of Arc,
Let your spirit guide U3 through. '
Come, lead your France to victory
Joan of Arc, we are calling you.
It is understood that the real reason for
the attitude of the United States toward
Japan and the decision not to indorse mili-'
tary action is Siberia is the stand taken by
Ambassador David R. Francis. He is und
erstood to believe that it will be impossible
for Germany to impose a made-in-Germany
peace on the Russian people. Mr. Francis
is understood in Washington to have re
ported that the rank and file of the Rus
sians themselves were so strongly anti-German
that if the Bolsheviki indorsed, the
peace terms imposed by Germany it would
soon be ousted from control. It is to be
hoped that .Francis is right, but every Bol
sheviki move up to this time arouses the
well grounded fear that he is wrong. Only
by ousting the Bolsheviki of control of her
affairs can Russia convince thoughtful
persons that she has either the courage cr
the desire to oppose German aims for dom
ination of Europe.
It is now planned for America to hold's
one hundred mile front in the west before
the end of the present year. England holds
over a hundred miles and little Belgium
holds fifteen. France holds 350 miles.
Consider the direct aid to France that the
taking over of nearly one-third of her tense
ly held front will be.- After all is said and
done, this will be a splendid achievement
for the United States for the first year of
the war. And we owe this to Germany for
her supreme contempt of what we possi
bly could do to aid the allied cause.
"U. S. troops kill twelve in Mexico."
You read that in the current news.
On this occasion, the Mexicans opened
fire on an American cavalry patrol, which
was minding its own business on Ameri
can soil. Thereupon American troops
crossed into Mexico and disposed of twelve
Mexican bandits with neatness and dis
patch. This will help cure the Mexicans
of that "contempt for the United States"
which. German agents have industriously
spread in Mexico.
When the time comes the president of
the United States will, as always, prove
himself an excellent educator teaching
the Mexicans that this country is a good
friend and an undesirable enemy.
A hundred armored fighting automo-'
biles, with a few flying machines above for
scouts, would easily do for the Mexican
government what it is unable to do for it
self clean up the bandits, dispose of the
gentle Villa, make it unnecessary for us to
send food and mcney into Mexi o, by mak
ing Mexico self supporting. Mr. Wilson
in his own time and way will persuade the
Mexicans to raise more corn and less hell.
Washington Times.
The recent advance in the wholesale
prices on meat quoted to retail dealers has
aroused a storm in Phoenix. Retailers
there declare there is no just or reasonable
cause for the last advance. The advance
does not go to the cattlemerf. The retailer
is prevented by food control of prices from
securing undue profits. There remains,
then, only the packers to consider as profi
teers. They are under fire now. And yet
they are bold enough to announce a further
advance.

FRIENDS ASK PARDON
FOR MEXICAN NOW IN
STATE PENITENTIARY
Would Secure Freedom for
Thcmas P. Cordova, Sent
yp From Cochise County
for Grave Assault.
Petitions addressed to the state par
don board and the governor have been
in circulation in the Warren District
for the past three days, asking that
Thomas P. Cordova, Mexican, sen
tenced from Coci'-ise county for as
sault with Intent to kill, be granted a
pardon. Friends of the Mexican are
handling the petitions, and they are
i being circulated chiefly among the
Mexican and Spanish-American voters
of the district.
Coidcva is now in the state peniten
tiary or in one of the state road camps.
He was arrested, tried and convictetu
for istault with a knife on Private A.
C. Gallego, a member of ' Arizona's
"fighting first, and now with the
state national guard at Camp Kearney,
California.- The btablnng followed at
tempts on the part of Cordova to in
timidate Mexican m'embSTs of the Ari
zona regiment. '
According to tne testimony at tie
trial of Cordova, the defendant had
been cursing Mexicans who joined the
tuitea states army, teiung mem tnar
their place was n Mexico, and that
they y.ere not patriotic. Finally he up
braided the United States army and
the flag of this nation. Gallego heard
him. and made a move to strike him.
Cordova drew a knife and stabbed the
joldier
nun uic V .1 - U1 L 1(1 1 C idl
Cordova Is not a desirable citizen and
hat attempts to secure his release
from prison should not be countenanc
ed. They attribute the circulation ct
petitions to friends and relatives. At
tempts yesterday to find how many sig
natures liad been secured were unsuc
cessful, and it is not thoughtnhat the
petitions are supported by more than
a few.
