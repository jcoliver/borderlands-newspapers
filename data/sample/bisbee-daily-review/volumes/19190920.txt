PRESIDENT APPLAUDED Bf 50,000
SANDIEGANS IN VAST STADIUM;
' AUDIENCE HEARS BY ELECTRICITY
Says League Framed on Advise-of Those Who Now (boose
It; Objection That British Might Have Preponderance of
Voting Power a Delusion; If the Public Knew the Truth
No One Would Have the Audacity to Preach Opposition
SAN DIEGO, Calif., Sept. 19.
President Wilson left San Diego
at 11 o'clock tonight by train for
Los Angeles, which, it was an.
nounced, he would reach at 9 a.
m. tomorrow. It was originally
planned for the president to re-
...main at Coronado tonight.
i
the crowd cheered again, that if the
American public did know the truth,
no man would have the auuacitv to
take the risk of trying to impaii
sucn an crrort toward liberty ana
justice.
"Final" Decision Up to U. S
Fraising the labor and sclMeter-
j ruination features of the treaty, the
19. An' president declared that, without the
SAN DIEGO, Calif., Sept
extract from a magazine article writ- league of nations, the other peace
ten in 1914 by Theodore Roosevelt! terms would not be worth the paper
"J- x.c '" u they were written on. It was a "final
u.j ou oiguuieui. decision." which thA TTnltoH
in favor of the league of nations.
Speaking to, a cheering crowd
which filled the great San Diego sta
dium, the president also quoted from
Senator Lodge, one of the most bit
ter opponents of the treaty in its
present form, and declared that in
framing the league covenant, the
Versailles conference had followed
the advice of these and other Repub
lican statesmen.
"I am glad to align myself with
such utterances," said Mr. Wilson,
while the crowd cheered. "Here in
concrete form is the fulfillment ot
the plan they advocated."
The address was Interrupted many
times by applause from the crowd,
which local officials estimated at
more than 50,000. The great amphi
theatre, with its seating capacity oi
40,000, was packed, thousands stand
ing in the aisles and on the terraces
above.
Speaks From Glass Enclosed
Platform.
Speaking from a glass enclosed
platform, the president's words were
carried out to the distant rim of the
stadium by means of an electrical
device. Only part of those present
could hear him, however, and before
he finished there were many empty
seats.
San Diego gave the president a
noisy welcome, factory whistles
shrieked while the party passed up
the street through cheering throngs.
He went first to a hotel where he
was welcomed formally by the city's
officials; later he was driven through
the San Diego exposition grounds.
when he entered the stadium, the
great crowd Btood up and cheered,
each person waving a small Ameri
can flag. In the center of the big
horseshoe of color, several hundred
girls dressed in white were so seated
as to spell "welcome."
Britain Not to Dominate.
The president also discussed at
length the objection that the British
empire might have a preponderance
f voting power in the league assem
bly. It was a "delusion" to be
frightened by any such prospect, he
said, because there could 'be no Im
portant actio? taken' by the 'assem
bly without the concurrence of Amer
ican representatives.
The assembly, asserted Mr. Wil
States
must now make, he added.
Someof the changes proposed in
the treaty, the president said, seemed
to' have it as their object to upset
the theory of equality among nar
j nons ana put me united States in
a special position of privilege. He
declared that to go into the league
without assuming an equal responsi
bility would be a "mockery."
"I will not join," he said, "in claim
ing In the name of justice an unjuav
position for the country I love and
cherish. Neither am I afraid of re.
sponsibility. Neither will I scuttle.
I will not be a party to belittling
America."
Emphasizing the arbitration fea
tures of the covenant, the president
said an example of the efficiency o.
discussion was shown in labor con
troversies. He asserted that when
ever either side to such a contro
versy refused to discuss Its case, the
presumption was that it was on the
wrong side.
It would be the death warrant of
the children of the country, declared
the president, should the league, fail.

G. 0. P. Would Give
U. S. Equal Vote
With Britain
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19.
After the covenant of the
f league of nations,' a part of
the German peace treaty,
had been read late today
in the senate, Republican
leaders claimed they had
votes enough to pass, prob
ably next week, an amend
ment which would give the
United States equal voting
power with Great Britain.
While confident that amend
ment will be adopted, the
Republicans hold that it
would not reopen the whole
question of peace! and force
the return of the pact to the
peace conference at Paris,
as President . Wilson and
Democratic leaders have
predicted.

GERMANY, 'DYNAMO OF STRENGTH'
SOON "TO REGAIN LOST LANDS BY
ARMED FORCE, SAYS MORGENTHAU
PARIS, Sept. 19. "Germany
came through this war a perfect
dynamo of strength. Her human
military power Is practically as
great at ever and her 65,000,000
people have been schooled and
hardened by trials. They have
learned economy and self denial.
"Tne nation has been com
pressed into a concentrated
mass, which . Is surcharged with
energy and moving with centri
fugal force, while Germany's
neighbors are spreading them
selves out thin and quarreling
and moving with centrifugal
force."
Thus spoke Henry Morgen
thu, who headed the United
States investigation commission
which has been at work In Ber
Hn, today In flioinf his b.
servations in central Europe.
'"And what will be the result?"
asked Mr. Morgenthau. Replying
to his own question, he contin
ued: "If disintegration keeps up
among Germany's neighbors
there can be but one result. I
doubt whether Germany fully ap
preciates her own strength. As
she sits, calmly watching the
dickering , going on between the
new states, which are losing
sight of great principles and
fighting over little strips of terri
tory, she must take grim satis
faction In the battle her enemies
are waging in her behalf. And
Germany, encouraged by such
discord among weak and strug
gling states, undoubtedly will re
sort to arms within a few years
and regain her lost territory."
ORGANIZATION
JJUUULAS, Ariz., Sept 19. The
Cochise county food conservation as
sociation resolved itself into the Co
chise county merchants' association
at a meeting held here today, attend
ed by Robert Rae, food administrator
for Cochise county. The association
commended Governor Thomas B.
Campbell for the stand he has taken
in the matter of food conservation.
There are to be seven fair price
boards in Cochise, county and it was
arranged that the association should
have a representative on each, to co
operate with the other elements try
ing to decrease living costs and In
crease production. The resolution
adopted by the meeting says in part':
"The Cochise county merchants' as
sociation, by its officers and direc
tors, extend to Governor Campbell Its
services and endorses in full Gover
nor Campbell's program for the regu
lation of prices, increasing of produc
tion, and the education of the con
sumer as to present existing condi
tions and with a view to all conser
vation possible. That we will use our
efforts toward reduction of prices as
far as it is possible to do so and to
render every assistance possible to
the local price boards or committees,
and state and local food administrators."

BOTH FACTIONS
ARE CONFIDENT
IN STEEL WAR
PITTSBURGH, Sept. 19. Prepara
tions for the test of strength between
organized labor and capital in the
steel industry throughout the Unlteu
States to begin Monday went for
ward today with both sides aDnar-
ently confident of the outcome. Then
were no official statements forthcom
ing from either side, but informal
talks indicated that they were ready
for the contest.
Representatives of steel companies
in the Pittsburgh district let it b
known that they intend to operate
their plants Monday and also let the
impression go out that they do not
look for so large a walkout as the
union leaders assert will take place.
Organized labor expects a big turn
out of men and predicts that the em
ployers will receive the surprise ot
their lives. Neither side will venture
figures. Eoth frankly confessed they
do not know how many men will re
main to work or fail to answer the
whistle. Monday only can tell, they
said.

Editor.
So many questions have been asked
about jelly making, that the follow
ing would not be amiss.
Fruits, to make good jelly, should
not tKover ripe and should have a
fair percentage of acid. The follow
ing table gives about the proportions
of juice and sugar for some Of -the
fruit juices: t
Juice Sugar
Grapes 1 cup ya- cup
Raspberries i......l cup cup
Currants .'... Ll cup cup
Tart Apple 1 cup cup
Cranberries 1 cup cup
How to Extract Juice
1. Cook juicy fruits in small
amount of water.
2. Cook slowly, mashing fruit with,
spoon or potato masher.
3. Pour into riannel bag or double
thickness of cheesecloth and '. let
drain. Do not squeeze, , as : that will
make . jelly . cloudy. 4. Measure
juice. Better to cook only 2 to 4
cups at one time.: s-
5. Heat sugar in oven, being care
ful not let brown.
6. When Juice is boiling, stir in
sugar until dissolved.
7. Boil rapidly until product will
foim 2 separate drops from spoon
or sheets from side of spoon.
S. Tour into hot sterilized glasses
and skim if necessary.
Too prolonged cooking destroys
the pectin.
Juices rich in pectin require only
about 10 minutes boiling, while those
less rich in pectin require 20 to 30
minutes. . If there is any doubt about
the jelly making properties of the
fruit try the following test:
1 teaspoon fruit juice.
teaspoon epson salts.
li teaspoon sugar.
Mix together In a cup and If it
forms a galatinous mass in 5 minutes
the fruit contains enough pectin, If
it does not form, then other fruit
juices containing pectin can be added
or the following can be made:
Orange Pectin'
Cut or scrape yellow rind from peel
or orange. Grind remaining white
peel. Mix 1 pound of white peel, 1
quart of water and 4 tablespoons
lemon juice. Let stand 15 minutes
then add 1 quart of water. Boil 10
minutes. Let stand over night. Next
morning boil ten minutes, cool . and
strain. Add to fruit juice until a
good pectin- test is obtained.
When jelly is syrupy, too much
sugar has been added.

POLITICAL TRICKERY IN COCHISE
(Tucson Citizen)
THE ACTION' of Charles Roberts in calling for the resignation
of the members of his highway commission shortly after their
selection because they reappointed J. . C. Ryan, is only a bit of
political camouflage which will not deceive Roberts' erstwhile
supporters in Lowell and Brewery Gulck. It is only a neat little
political play designed to cover Roberts' tracks. All of those who
know Ihe mentor of the Cochise board are perfectly familiar with
the fact that he is a foxy political manipulator, who takes no chances.
Of course he knew what the highway commissioners were going to.
do before he appointed them. He must have known that they would
reappoint Ryan. He apparently thought he could square himself
in Bisbee and Lowell by calling for their resignations and pretending
that he was not a party to the deal. Really, with all of his political
pcuiien, Roberts is at times very crude and he certainly pulled some
rough stuff in this case.
Roberts will, take refuge in the fact that the commission, once
appointed, cauiiot be removed, except for cause, and will take secret
satisfaction in the knowledge that he has put one 'over in the re
appointment of Ryan. In the mean time, what must be the feelings
cf his constituency in Lowell and Brewery Gulch? Can it ba pos
sibles that Roberts has fooled them and that they believe that he
did net know all along just what was going to happen under the new
commission?
Unfortunately the recall is full of technicalities and Roberts
is just the one who would take advantage of any loophole. Ap
parcly bis radical followers In the last election, have no remedy
until 1920. With it &UK Roberts has the audacity to cast his bat
into the gubernatorial ring and bid for the support of the very peo
ple w he put him in office as a supervisor of Cochise county.
We would like to know the man who is responsible for the Ryan
deal and at whose suggestion Roberts acted. We think we see a
finer lipnd than that of Roberts and that the man who really put
it over is none other than "Boss" Bowen himself. The erstwhile
boss of the party in "clear old Cochise" seems to have some mysteri
ous held on the lanky and persistently active supervisor from the
ncrth. Roberts was elected for the purpose of putting Eowen on
the political shelf, but judging from events of the past nine months,
instead of doing the job, he surrendered the right in the start.
If the appointment of Ryan is "Boss" Bowen's work, as we
firmly believe, we cannot help from admiring him for putting over
this clever coup. He has shown that he is still to be reckoned with
and although not in nominal control, is still the power behind the
tin cue in Cochise county.
Our sympathies naifirally go out, however, to Roberts' old fol
lowing in Lowell and Brewery Gulch. Although we do not sub
scribe to their doctrines, we like to see a man in politics stick with
his friends and when a fellow has won a victory after a hard fight.
It goes hard to be deprived of the fruits of that victory and see the
other fellow, accomplish by intrigue, what he has failed to win on
the field of battle.
Roberts has a good deal to answer for. but the appointment of
Ryan, overshadows them all. As satisfactory as the selection is to
all conservative Democrats and Republicans,' we must admit that
it was accomplished by political trickery and while Cochise county
will undoubtedly profit by having a man of the ability and experience
of Mr. Ryan in charge of road work, on the theory that to the victor
belongs the spoils, Brewery Gulch and Lowell, who supported Roberts
in the primary and at the election, were entitled to Ryan's scalp.
"THAT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION"
UT, says the advocate of the League of Nations, it is "a step
In thn Hsrlit direction for universal nsacfi."
j.. , -
D
I I Here is the step we are taking:
We bind ourselves to fight for every European boundary
line established by the treaty of peace, including, if necessary, the
Shantung steal.
We bind ourselves to maintain the biggest army we have ever
known in times of peace, in readiness to fight when called upon.
We bind ourselves to maintain an army in Europe to compel the
Central Powers to fulfill the provisions of the treaty, or fight.
We bind ourselves morally to undertake the mandatory of Ar
menia, which undertaking obligates us to fight to maintain it, if
necessary.
All these provisions bristling with fight ai,e the only guarantees
the league pact gives us for universal peace, except, of course, the
guarantee thai thousands of American soldiers are already fighting
on foreign son, giving up their lives in contests in which this coun
try has no concern whatever, and in a war which thi3 country has
not even declared.
On the other hand the rejection of the league separates the
United States from every quarrel of Europe, binds us to no foreign
policy which we do not ourselves make, brings our army home from
Europe, withdraws any responsibility for maintaining European
boundary lines, and leaves us free to reduce our army to a peace
basis and follow the path of independence which kept us out of
European conflicts for more than a century, except for our Hu
manitarian intervention in behalf of Cuba and to protect the lives
of our own citizens in China.
The only guarantee that the League of Nations will preserve
peace for the United States is a theory based on hope.
The guarantee that the old fashioned American policy of pad
dling its own canoe will go father toward preserving peace for us,
is based upon the results of a century of -actual experience.

AVERY large number of people and an unusually high pro

has outgrown force. Moral suasion is their cry; there is
no need for police or armies.
But When the Boston police went on strike a mob of toughs took

SEEKS LOWER INTEREST RATE.
PHOENIX, Sept. 20 J. C. Adams,
well known hotel man of this city,
has started an initiative movement
to reduce the legal rate of interest
from ten per cent to seven and a
half per cent. Ono of the reasons
for the high cost of living in the
Salt River valley, declares Adams,
is the high rate of interest charged
by the local banks. Adams has sent
out a circular letter asking the
views of a large number of busi
and professional men and office
holders and that they endorse tho
movement., The letter charges that
the Phoenix banks alone are collect
ing an interest which aggregates
$800,000 per annum. The interest
rate is excessive, it adds, and a law
should be enacted by the , citizens
of the state that would save $200,
000 a year to citizens of Phoenix
and vicinity alone. The prosperity
of Phoenix should not be held back
by unusual and excessive interest
rates and banking laws should be
drawn by the citizens and not by
the bankers' association of Arizona,
he says.

ARIZONA EXHIBIT ON
ITS WAY TO KANSAS
TUCSON, Sept. 19. Malcolm A.
Fraser, state immigration commis
sioner and in charge of the exhi
bit of the state of Arizona at the
soil products exposition which is to
open in Kansas City September 21,
left yesterday, in charge of a largo
part of the exhibit for the Kaw
river town where he will spend the j
week in advance getting the prod
ucts of the baby state in shape for
display.
Thoilgh the response has not been
general ovpr the state to the re
quest senti out from here for coun
ty participation, seven counties have
gotten together, their grains and fruit
in such ext&jit and of such character as
insures attention being attracted to
to Arizona very notably at Uhe ex
position. Seven counties, Coeoninnj.
Yavapai, Maricopa, Tima, Pinal, Gra
ham and Yuma are participating.
Maricopa county,, as was to be
anticipated, has the largest offer
ing and they have' gene into the af
fair on such a large scale as to
justify their competition, now an
nounced, for the county display priz;
as against the best any of the oth
er sixteen states will have to offer.
Yuma county has a good display
in spite of the fact that this is an
unfavorable season of Hie year in
which to ship and show perisha
ble products.
Mr. Fraser, bcrore leaving said
lie was entirely confident that the
show wi'.l bring back some prizes,
which will be of value, not so mu'h
intrinsically as for the advertising
and prestige which they will give
to Arizona.
Ho reports tnut more of the coun
ties of the state did not take part
but concludes that many county
agents were too busy at this par
t inula r time to get up displays for
their ebunlies.
The -soil 'products exposition will
last for ten days and in addition
to Mr. Fraser there will be a; rep
resentative of the Ymua and 'Mari
copa county folk nd also a local
representative of the Tucson Farms
eompany in Kansas City throughout

The work of sinking the Spray
shaft of the Copper Queen com

intention of the company to go
down another 100 feet, making the
depth of the shaft a little more

when another station has been cut
and the ground blocked out that
another large body or ore will be

are cast aside as worthless for aero

and other purposes; but it shows some
thing of the extra drain which Is
going to be made on the forests of
the country. The American Forestry
Association which is urging a national
forest policy points out some of the
various kinds of wood which are call
ed for in the building of aeroplane
parts and why this or that variety is
preferred for propellers, po!s or ribs.

incipal Woods Used
Walnut, mahogany,, spruce, ash,
white oak, maple, birch, cherry and
Douglas fir are among- the principal
woods which have been' most ex
tensively used ,.in tiie manufacture of
aeroplanes.' Walnut is the best wood
that grows for propellers, as also for
gunstocks. This is because of its
strength and lightness combined, and
the fact that it does not warp nor does
it splinter like most woods when struck
by a projectile. Spruce for many
parts of aeroplane construction, how
ever, will continue to be in great de
mand for the wood has many qual
ities which make it' most desirable for
this' use. , ,
'Practically all of the framework Is
of spruce and it bids fair to hold its
place, with h possible supplementing
by bamboo Y Metal tubing has been
tried, but has been found unsatisfac
tory. Straightne.-s of grain, strength,
lightness and freedom from defects,
these are the requisites. The "struts"

or upright posts in biplanes, the sup
porting ribs in the planes thmserves
and the beams running lengthwise de
mand wood with, st'raight grain which
must continue the whole length of the
piece without going across from one
side to the other or "running out."
. . Parts Arc "Built Up"
Most of the parts of an aeroplane
are of built-up or laminated wood lri
which thin layers are glued together
to form the part needed. This has
many advantages. In the first place,
the smaller the pieces of wood ' that
k re, employed the more likely they are
to be free from defects. Further, the
lamination divides the stresses and' pre
vents thenr from coming In full fdfee
on any one grain. It is, on the whole,
another . exemplification of the old
adage that m union there Is strength.
Another -advantage Is that laminated
stock can be built ta form curves', or
can be bent to a curve without split
ting or weakening the piece.
The main reason for such large use
of spruce in aeroplane building is its
uniformity .of structure and freedom
from defects. It has the quality of be
ing' what It appears to be on the sur
face. If one pickfc ' out a piece of
spruce that looks good and is clear
and straight, he may be sure that it
is good. Other wood3 which may look
as straight and clear will occasionally
deceive. - Propellers,. , like . the other
parts, are made of built-up pieces.
Some propellers are made entirely of
black walnut, t laminated, of course.
just as if different kinds of wood were
used. Others are made of mahogany,
of mahogany and spruce In alternate
layers, or mahogany and asfe.

In making '1,700 or- more revolu

a terrific pressure is placed upon an
aeroplane-propeller. This amounts to
thousands' of pounds to the' square
inch: and in the sharp turns and
maneuvers, sudden drops and quick
ascents, plL-nge.s -down and pulls up
along the highways of the air which
the modift-n airship is compelled to
make, there, is greatly added strain
on all the parts. ' This means that any
piece of wood which' could nof "give"
properly would' break. The best of
spruce for airplane manufacture is the
Western variety, or Sitka- spruce.
There is a large supply of it, but dif
ficulty in getting the highest grades.

The trick is simple enough: Simplj

stead of trying to wrest the stamp
from the envelope. Cu;t the envelop
away from the stamp. leaving Just
margin of paper for thumb and finger
to grasp; then with the stamp turned
away from' you and the paper toward
you, begin to peel away-the paper at

STOCKS AND BOND8
NEW YORK, Sept. 19. Apart
from its frequent pauses and the
heavy selling movement at the close
today's stock market received with
apparent indifference, news that la
bor leaders had ordered a general
strike of steel workers.
Reports and gossip current in the
financial district hinted that joint
action -might yet be taken by rep
resentatives of capital and labor
to postpone or defer indefinitely
the proposed walkout, but these
were not credited in foremost in
dustrial quarters.
Prices were irregular at the out
set, soon developing moderate heav
iness, but reversals were almost
immediately overcome when shorls
found stocks wer not pressed ; for
sale.
For the, rest of. the session until
the final half hour the market mov
ed sluggishly, but with a confident
undertone, the so-called "strike"
stocks holding firm when not corn-
supply which exists in many quarters.

Although at first the corn market

mostly in favor of bears.
It was a popular view early that the
recent big smash in grain quotations
had over discounted all bearish factors
in corn as compared with other com
modities and that tiie market should
now be governed by any current in-
luence which ordinarily would work
toward higher prices. But the temp

GLAD TO TESTIFY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To What
Cardui Has Done For Me, So '
As To Help Others"
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. ,W. Glad
well of this town, says: "When about
15 years of age I suffered greatly.
. . Sometimes would go a month
or two, and I had terrible headache,
backache, , and bearing-down pains,
and would Just drag and had no appe
tite. Then ... it would last . . .
two weeks, and was so weakening and
my health was awful. s
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so I kept it up
till I took three ... I gained, and
was well and strong, and I owe it all
to Cardui.
"I am married now and have three
children . .. . Have never had to
have a doctor for female trouble, and
just resorf to Cardui if I need a tonic.
I am glad to testify to what it has done
for me, so as to help others."
If you are nervous or weak, have
headaches, backaches, or any of the
other ailments so common to women,
why not give Cardui a trial? Recom
mended by many physicians. In use
over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you ned. adv

Pertinent Speeches Delivered
By Leading Educators to
Future Citizens Who Have
Finished Cochise Co. Course
ti
Faced by the parents, relatives and
friend who had -watched their prog
ress through the schools of Cochise
county, eight young men and women
of the Warren district received last
night the diplomas that vouch for
their completion of the high school
course, and for the character ' that
has sustained them through the long
Journey from .the) grammar grades.
The exercises , were held ia the hign
school auditorium, which was nearly
filled with spectators.
The graduates who received thetr
diplomas last evening were Leon
Kronman, Jack Easou, Arthur OJeda,
Amy Rourke, Raymond Foster,. Or
lean Landrum, Winnie Wood ana
Juanita Stinson. Two other mem
bers of the June division have already
left to complete'- other scholastic
work. These are Ruth Officer, who
is attending a nurses' training school
1n California, and Verne, Brooks, who
has enrolled as a student at North
western university. ;
The commencement program was
opened by E. A. Putnam, general sec
retary of the Y. M. C. A., who of
fered the invocation. This was fol
lowed by the Bisbee male quartet, in
cluding Messrs.1 .Tuell, Williamson,
Blair and Hooper, 'after ' which C. F.
Fhilbrook, superintendent of schools,
made the introductory remarks. He
spoke upon the school system of the
city in general, and of the effect it
has had upon' the community as- a
whole. He also outlined the benefits
Which have accrued from' the three
junior high schools here in prepar
ing young men and women for their
life's work, and then discussed the
vocational education features to be
taken up under the proposed Smith
Hughes law for the nationalization 6.
the American school system, taking
occasion to speak in Wvor of the plan
to build here a special school for
Mexican children, where the princi
ples bt American through and culture
may be inoculated and a change
wrought in the home lives of these
future citizens.
The commencement address was
delivered by Dr. Robert McNalr Da
vis, of the University cf Arizona, who
took as fcis subject "Reconstruction
and who outlined briefly but pointed
ly the main Issues in the league o
nations question; and, the reasons
hy, he said, the : league should be
made a' reality. -
Dr. Davis was followed by Miss
Charlotte Anderson, who rendereu
two piano solos, "Etude in D flat," by
Liszt, and "Tarantella, Venice and
Naples," also by Lizst. Her technique
and artistry were well received by
her audience. . .
j The presentation of diplomas to the
graduates was made by E. Q. Snyder,
principal of Uje Lhifeh school, in the
absence of DrvC. ,H- Hunt, 'president
of the board pf feducation, who was
unavoidably absent. In giving the
graduates the certificates of scholar
ship, Principal Snyder spoke, in part,
as follows:
"I am glad to be able to give you
these diplomas, for I know how welt
you have deserved them, and how
(truly they are yours because yo
have earned through', your applica
tion to your work and your attention
to your duties as students at the Bis
bee high schools.
'But your work is not yet finished.
You have a debt to repay. The state
of Arizona 'has been very good to
you it has afforded you every op
portunity for an education, it has
guatded your progress, and it hab
brought you to this splendid consum
mation. That debt ' you must repay,
and you can repay it in only one
way in so developing your charac
ters so as to be,, in fact, worthy citi
zens of your state."
' "An Open Secret," by Woodman,
.was then sung by Mrs. Gilbert Mas
ton, bringing the ceremonies to au
end.

STANLEY HANCOCK, WHO FOUGHT .
THROUGH ENTIRE FOUR YEARS OF
GREAT WAR, RETURNS TO BISBEE
Stanley Hancock, one of the "first
hundred thousand," or, as they were
sometimes called by the Germans,
"Kitchener's. contemptible little
army," who left Bisbee at the begin
ning of the great war was to throw his
lot with the allies, returned to thia
city yesterday after such a series of
experiences as seldom comes to a
man in a single lifetime.
Within two weeks of the time when
he arrived in France, Hancock was
fighting . along the first line ot
trenches. Through all ' the bitter
struggle that ensued from the Ger
man attempts to reach Calais and the
British ports," he fought with the thin
line of khaki-clad Britishers that
stood like a wall before the Hun
armies. In the midst of this came
the first gas attack at Ypres, when
the surprised British and Canadians
found themselves in a swirl of chok
ing, burning gas and experienced all
the sensations of men faced with a
new and unknown danger iwithout
any protection. . Hancock described
vividly yesterday how the Britishers
soaked their ' socks, handkerchiefs
and cloth leggings in muddy water
and held them to their noses and
mouths,' while those who were not
quick enough came to a sudden and
horrible death. The defense made
by these troops under this attack has
been declared one of the marvels of
the war.
Transferred to the Somme valley.
Hancock was captured and broughi
to a German prison camp. Here he
met with another Bisbee boy, Ralph
Eliinwood, who had also fallen pris
oner to the Huns. The two were to
gether for- some time, when Hancock
was taken to the mines and forced
to work 15 hours a day, seeing the
sun for only one hour every Sunday.

Praise for Local Highways
That he roads of Cochise county
built by the old county highway com
mission and Engineer J. C. Ryan, are
equal to all, and superior to the, ma
jority, of county and lnter-county
roads Ihrougnou;. tnc United States,
is the declaration of Harry Lockf.,
publisher of Locke's Good Roads
Maps, including! both maps and de
scriptions of alL fhe principal auto
mobile roads In this country, who
visited Bisbee yesterday on his way
from the east to California.
. "I am an old 'rosident of Bisbee,"
he said last nighi "and I want to
say right now that the road system
of Cochise county is m. eye-opener,
and the credit for this system can
go to only one body of men the
old board of road commissioners anu
the engineer who has conceived and
built the highways."
During the past summer Locke has
mapped, the roads of Colorado, Ari
zona, Louisiana, New Mexico, Texas,
Alabama and Mississippi, and has
traveled more than 10,000 miles in
gathering this data for the new edi
tions bf his books.
He describes the roads in the south
as being la very bad condition, es
pecially because of the excessive
rains which have visited Louisiana
and Texas. This fact, he declares,
has brought out the necessity of
high grade concrete roads "roads
built to last as long as the bond Is
sue." Locke leaves' today.
DADDY BROOKS
DYING; REPORT
:Hancock was in the service from
Sept.. 1914, until he was captured In
July, 1918. He carries seven scars,
three of which are from bullet
wounds and four from shrapnel, and
on his breast he wears the croix de
guerre for distinguished duty. In
addition he has lost three ribs where!
a German guard struck him with the
butt of a rifle. He was a member)
of the Second Wessex regiment.
Asked whether England was for
getting the war in the press of re
construction problems and the desire
to resume commercial relations with
Germany, Hancock replied emphati
cally that she is not.
England has three reminders of the
great war," he said. "The first is the
fact that nine out of every 10 women
in England are wearing mourning.
The second is the knowledge that in
London are 300,000 blind soldiers.
The third is the knowledge that there
are in the same city 250,000 other
crippled Britishers whose sufferings
have been the result of German ar
rogance and lust for power."
Hancock will take up his work
immediately with a local mining
company.

craze in Hungary with their famous
"Csardas," or tavern dances. Perhaps
the most dazzling of this fascinating music
is the "Hejre Kati (pronounced High-rb-catty)
Scenes from the Csarda." Toscha
Seidel interprets it with irresistible fire.
