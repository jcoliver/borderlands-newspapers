(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, Dec. 19. Definite plans
lor the peace conference are not
shaping as rapidly as some of the
American commissioners expect
ed. Meanwhile President Wilson
is taking advantage of the oppor
tunity to assess public opinion In
France and incidentally in Great
Britain. His advisers say he is en
tirely satisfied that the peoples
are largely in accord with the
principles he has announced as
necessary to a durable peace.
The members of the American mis
sion are employing their time before
the peace delegates from the various !
countries actually assembled, in
series of informal conferences, which
eventually will include a representa
tive of each of the entente belliger
ents. Neutral states will not come
Into these discussions.
The feeling among all tie entente
conferees is that the malting of peace
should be their first task, so that they
may determine upon the broad out
lines of a league of nations, which,
later, representatives of neutral coun
tries will assist in completing.
While the American commissioners
are holding these informal exchanges,
which are designed to clear up diverg
encies of opinion, the president is con
stantly giving the closest attention
to immediate problem. lie is receiv
ing reports from the United States,
from American diplomatic agencies
throughout the world, and from the
group of investigators brought here
for the purpose of studying the many j
special problems which will arise.
These investigators are continuing
their studies with the advantage of
being on the ground and in intimate
contact with original sources of infor
mation. The president may change the pro
gram of his movements while await
ing the opening of tb,i conference. It
was not supposed until today that he
would visit England before the new
year, but he has received urgent invi
tations to come soon.
American observers deduce from
the pressing invitation to the presi
dent to come to England during
Christmas time that some conferences
of the statesmen with the president
there would logically follow. It is
understood, however, that the presi
dent favors the holding of all confer
ences in Paris as far as possible.
It appears to be virtually settled
that all the actual peace conferences
will be held in Paris and that the in
formal exchanges, which will lay the
ground work for the final delibera
tions, also will be carried on here.

LONDON, Dec. 19 The British gov

formation this evening regarding the

SUGGEST SUDDEN DIFFICULTY
MANCHESTER, England, Dec. 19.
In commenting editorially upon PresI-
aent Wilson's visit to London, now in
immediate prospect, the Guardian, to
day regards it as significant "that
the president means business which
the leisurely arrangements previously
contemplated hardly seem to imply."
"It is unnecessary to speculate,"
continues the newspaper, "upon the
precise causes of this sudden change
of plans, but obviously the clrcum- j
stances of the moment are not such
as to brook delay. The news from
Germany shows that two things are
essential if order is to be kept and a
stable government maintained the
population must be fed and the indus
tries started by the returning soldiers
and munition workers thrown out of
employment and yet we hear of noth
ing effective being done.
"Mr. Hoover has been here nearly
a fortnight. He has a vast task to
perform. Has he all the resources and
all the authority he needs? He has
immense experience and energy, but
no man can make bricks without
straw, and we are not so sure about
the straw."
Before be left America, says the
Guardian, Mr. Hoover said lie favored
the raising of the blockade, but bis
statement to this effect, it says, was
not allowed to appear in England, the
opposite impreB6ion being conveyed
instead.
"Has Mr. Hoover changed his mind?
Has he been over-ruled or is the deci
sion pending?" . the newspaper in
quires. 1 '
The Guardian refers to the impos
sibility of an indefinite stay by Presi
dent Wileson, who had come with defi
nite principles and policy, - it says,
which the allies had formally and
definitely accepted, but the president
could not have been long in Paris, it
adds, without discovering what it
calls the strange discrepancies be
tween "this professed acceptance and
the sectional and purely nationalistic
demands put forward by various coun
tries, not excluding our own."

AMSTERDAM, Dec. 19. The con

ment) until some other arrangement
is made by the German national as
sembly. 1
The congress further appointed a
central council of soldiers and work
men to exercise parliamentary super
vision over the German and Prussian
cabinets with the right to appoint and
depose of all of Germany until the
final arrangement of the state of af
fairs of Prussia.
The congress rejected a resolution
demanding the complete elimination
of the bouregoise clasB from the gov
ernment. .
SCENES ARE STORMY.
BERLIN, Tuesday, Dec. i7.(By
the Associated Press.) The second
day's session of the congress of the
soldiers' and workmen's councils of
Germany was marked by stormy
scenes. Herr Lansburg, majority so
cialist, denounced the business meth
ods and dictatorial attitude of "the
soldiers and workmen's council of
Berlin. He declared that the executive
committee of the council- had pre
sented a chaotic budget statement.
Just before the suasion . adjourned.
30 soldiers created a sensation by in-
vadlng the meeting room and demand
ing that the delegates immediately
vote to disarm and disqualify all offi
cers and to place all authority in the
hands of the soldiers and workmen's
council.
Their appearance caused a great
uproar. After repeated efforts the
chairman and members of the gov
ernment gained control of the meet
ing. The spokesman for the soldiers
then announced their demands after
which the invaders left the ball. The
congress finally adjourned until to
morrow. The invasion was regarded as an
other attempt by the Liebnecht fac
tion to stampede the congress.
SOLDIERS INVADE SITTING.
BERLIN. Wednesday, Dec. 18. (Hy
the Associated Press.) Evidently re
flecting the views of the Ebert
Scheidemann group, Vorwaerts takes
the most serious views of the incident
of yesterday when the congress of
soldiers and workmen was invaded
by a party of soldiers. It accuses the
extreme left of aiming to disrupt the
congress.
"It must be declared openly," says
the newspaper, "that there Is danger
of the whole government apparatus
crumbling and the armistice and
peace negotiations being broken off
on the ground that no competent Ger
man government exists and that all
Germany will be occupied by entente
troops."
The Freihelt, on the contrary, de
clares the invasion of the congress
could be explained by the Indignation
of the soldiers at the counter-revolutionary
activities by the officers of
certain troops.
The demonstration by the soldiers
was so In accord with the utterances
of Lederbour, and other radicals at
Tuesday's session, as to suggest more
than a coincidence.

SENATE ADOPTS
POSTAGE FEATURE
OE REVENUE BILL
Zone System Repealed Under
New Provision; Insurance
Rates Also Acted Upon
Favorably
(liy Review Leased Wlr)
WASHINGTON, Dec. 19. By
adopting the finance committee's
amendments to the war revenue bill
affecting second-class postage and
insurance companies, the senate to
day cleared the way for disposal of
the few other contested, but important
features remaining. Leaders now
have increased confidence of passing
the bil! before adjournment next Mon
day. BGy a vote of 34 to 22 the senate
approved the eoSnmittee amendment
proposng repeal next July 1 of the
present zone system of second-class
postage rates and substitution of a
rate of 1 cent a pound within 150
miles and 1' cents beyoad. Most
of the day was spent in spirited dis
cussion of tiiis amendment and one
by Senator McKellar of Tennessee
for a modified zone plan, which was
rejected without a roll fail.
The senate alwo approved the com
mittee plan for new rates on cas
ualty, fire, murine and other insur
ance companies, except life insurance.
The new rates based on premium re
ceipts, are respectively: Fire insur
ance companies, li per cent; cas
ualty, plate glass and similar com
panies, l'i per cent; and, marine. 24
per cent cn inland and 1 per cent
cn export policies.
'Disposal of these and many minor
administrative and verbiage changes
left virtually only the income, war
excess profits, inheritance and luxury
tax sections to be considered.
A substitute for the committee's
bill, proposing large tax increases,
principally on big incomes and war
excess profits, was introduced late to
day by Senator LaFollette of Wis
consin, republican, who is expected
to make a lengthy address tomorrow
in its behalf. Senator Jones of New '
Mexico, democrat, plans to advocate
an amendment to continue war profits
taxation through 1920, and ' Senator
Thomas of Colorado, democrat, is ex
pected to propose elimination of the
inheritance tax provlsons, with Sena
tor Kenyon of Iowa and others pre
pared to urge re-insertion of the fj
per cent tax on luxuries.
Besides these questions, that of
prescribing 1920 taxes, opposed by re
publicans, remains for disposition.
Disposal of the second-class postage
section tpday was regarded as remov
ing a considerable obstacle from the
bill's path. Senators Hardwick of
Georgia and McKellar of Tennessee,
led the fight on the committee amend
ment which was defended by Senator
Suioot of Utah. Opponents charged
that second-class publications are
granted a large government mall
"subsidy," while Senator Sinoot de
clared the present zone system tends
to foster undesirable sectionalism and
would drive many small publications
out of business.
On thi) roll call on adoption of the
committee amendment, 13 democrats
and 21 republicans supported the new
periodical class, with 15 democrats
and 7 republicans in opposition, as
follows.
For adoption:
Democrats Fletcher, Gerry, Hen

Mexico. Kendrlck, Martin of Virginia,

gan, tried, in vain, to buy the Otto
man Telegraphic News agency, with
headquarters in Bagdad, to spread Ger
man propaganda. The publication of
a German edition of Current Litera
ture, a magazine, of which George
Sylvester Yiereck in the I'nited States
and his father, Louis Viereck, in Ber
lin, were proomters, were mentioned
by the witness, together with the Ger
manic museum at Harvard and the
movement to exchange professors
with American universities, as Ger
man propaganda moves.
To Discourage Effort
One example of. enemy' propaganda,
said Mr. Brecker, consisted of the
systematic effort late in 1917 to
spread throughout the world the Idea
that Germany was on the verge of
internal revolt. . and that the kaiser
woild soon be overthrown. The fact
that the dissemination of these reports
was encouraged by the thief German
government censor, was convincing
evidence that the efforts were propa
ganda intended to paralyze prosecu-.
Uon of the war, in Mr. Brecker's opin
ion. He said these reports had been
heut out of Germany by "George T.
Odell, correspondent of the New Ycrk
Evening Mail, after the United States
entered the war, and were circulated
widely by the McCIure newspaper
syndicate, described as a subsidiary
of the mail.
Senator Reed, wio is not a member
of the committee, interrupted, to ask
whether similar, articles had not be,en
published by other newspapers then,
and even down to the present, and
whether developments had not borne
them out. Mr. Brecker'said this was
true, but insisted that the reports
were inspired by the German foreign
office late in 1917.
Other News Agencies
Mr. Brecker said the Transocean
News agency maintained a wireless
service, intended to influence mainly
South American!! peoples, while the
German South American institute, and loose
the German News Service for Portu
gal and Spain, subidized by the Ger
man government, had similar func
. tions.
Mr. Brecker told the committee that
enemy propaganda in the I'nited
States was disclosed incidentally dur
ing his investigation of the activities
of Bola Pasha in promoting the fi
nancing of the Paris Journal and in
what was described as an attempt to
form a news alliance between the
Journal and William R. Hearst's news
papers. The witness told of an unsuccessful
effort by Polo in conferences with E.
G. Grace of the Bethlehem Steel cor-J
poration. to get ihe company to pur
chase the Journal, but added that he
believed this move was entirely "cam
ouflage," intended to cover up the real
purpose of his visit to the I'nited
States.
Former German Ambassador von
Bernstorlf assented ' so readily to
Bolo's proposal that the German gov
ernment advanced the money to pur
chase ;he Journal, the witness said,
that fie Now York investigations pro
ceeded on the theory that Mr. Hearet
might have arranged tiit'purchase be-
agaiast the Industrial Workers of the
World in the northwest.
Alleged formulas for treating plants
and trees with chemicals and direc
tions for "mixing the finest flour of
emery dust in lubricating oil for ma
chinery" were read to the jury.
Today's showing was for the pur
pose of proving the general conspiracy
charge, Robert Duncan, special at
torney for the department of justice
announced, and witnesses are to be
placed on the stand beginning tomor
row in an effort to connect the io-
vidual defendants with the plots
charged.
Reference to the sudden death of
"Our Old Friend Sherilf Meadows of
Imperial valley," was made in a let
ter alleged to have been written by
C. L. Lambert, former I. W. W. secre-
tary here, read to the jury' today.
"They finally got our old friend.
Sheriff Meadows of Imperial valley
This rat has dodged everything suc
cessfully for the last five years from
prison to bullets, but finally Jie fell
nnd died alter four hours of terrible
agony from poisoning of some kind
e lived five year3 too long."
A letter signed by C. L. Lambert,
secretary of the Wheatland defense
committee, addressed to Phil- Mc
Laughlin, a defendant here, said:
"If we could have gotten as many
sab-cats at Wheatland as there are
said to be in Stockton, there would
have beu something doing there."
The Wheatland hop riots occurred
February 5, 1914. E. T. Manwell. dis
trict attorney of uba county, was
killed. R. D. Suhr and Richard Ford
were sentenced to life imprisonment
for the crime.
Another letter Lambert is alleged to
have sent Charles Schultz character
ized "the statement of Johnson on the
Ford and Suhr case" as ''one of the
finest whines that could be kicked
out of a yellow dog." adding: "Hut
we will make him howl some more

addressed tr Vincent St. John, I. V.

said Germer.
"Roosevelt said the German people

the government officials with perse

There were many indications today
that a proposal to sink the ships
would meet strong opposition in con
gress. The Paris dispatch prompted
Senator Lodge to introduce today a
resolution calling on the state depart
ment for information as to whether
the American delegates are advocat

and if so by what authority. The. reso

While tike impression has been giv

would not look with favor upon send

some officers pointed today to. prac
tical obstacles to absorption of the
surrendered vessels by the allied and
American navies. They said that ow
ing to differences in design and equip
ment between the capital craft of the
German fleet and those of any other
naval power; the military value of the
ships to the victors is far from as
great as might be thought. The Ger
man ships were built, it was explain
ed, on theories that differ fundamen
tally from British, American, French
or Italian ideas of naval construc
tion. Only in the case of the most modern
German dreadnaughts or battle
cruisers, one officer said, would the
extensive reconstruction necessarily

fighting fleets be Justified.
As a peacetime element of the

officers were inclined to think that

EXPLAINS WILSON'S STATEMENT
NEW YORK, Dec. 19. In explana-
i tion of President Wilson's denial in
Paris that he had ever directly or in
directly endorsed a plan formulated
by the League to Enforce Peace, the
official statement was issued here
today by the national headquarters of
that organization.
"President Wilson's statement ca
bled fcom Paris that he never en
dorsed 'the particular plan' of the
League to Enforce Peace needs no cor
roboration. The league never sought
any such endorsement.
"It must be plain to everyone that
it would have been unwise and undip
lomatic for the head of a nation to
commit himself to any specific plan
for an international settlement before
j the peace conference meets. The
h . ht to.n V n ! League to Enforce Peace would have
power that, might become swelled with
ambition for world conquest.
It was recalled, however, that some
of the Spanish ships sunk by the
American fleet at Santiago in 1898
were raised and used by the American
navy and that also Japan made simi
lar use of Russian ships captured in
1904 after rebuilding them.

Most authorities now agree that
what we ' call Spanish Influenza is
simply the old-fashioned grip, which 1
was epidemic here in 1889 SU. The in- j
fluenza germs enter through the nose
and mouth and attack the lining of the
air passages nose, throat and bron-!
chlal tubes. I
There is no cure or specific for this (
disease, but Nature will throw off the
attack, if only you conserve your I
strength. A competent physician
should always be called. The use of
VaporRub does not interfere with any
interna) treatment and it is now being
used by broadminded physicians ev
erywhere, in order to stimulate the
lining of the air passages to throw off
the grip germs, to aid in loosening
the phlegn and keeping the air pas
sages open, thus making the breath
ing easier. Hot. wet towels should
be applied over the throat, chest 'and
back between the shoulder blades to
open the pores. Ten VapoRub should
be rubbed in over the parts until the
skin is red. spread on thickly and
covered with two thicknesses of hot
flannel cloths. Leave the clothing
loose around the neck, as the heat of
the body liberates the Ingredients in
the form of vapors. These vapors. In
haled with each breath, carry the
medication directly to the parts affect
ed. Aat tl same time, VapoRub is
absorbed through and stimulates the
skin, attracting the blood to the sur
face, and thus aids in relieving the
congestion within.
HOW TO AVOID THE DISEASE
Evidence seems to prove that this is
a germ disease, spread principally by
human contact, chiefly through ou lin
ing, sneezing or spitting. So avow
ing crowds common drinking cups,
roiler towels, etc. Kep up your bo!
ily strength by plenty of exercise in
the open air and good food.
KEEP FREE FROM COLDS.
Above all. fcee p free from colds, as
colds irritate the lining of the air pas
sages and render tiieci much better
breeding Haras for tiie germs. Use
Vicks VapoRub at the very first sizr
cf a cold. For a iiead cold, melt a lit
tle VapoRub in a spoon and Inhale the
vapors, or better still, use VapoRub In
a benzoin steam kettle. If this is not
available, nse an ordinary tea kettl?.
Fill half full of boiljp.g water, put in
half a teaspoon of VapoRub from time
to time keep the kettle Just slowly
boiling and inhale the steam arising.
NOTE: Vick's VapoRub is the discov
ery of a North Carolina druggist, who
found how to combine, in salve form.
Menthol and Camphor with such vola
tile oils as Eucalyptus, Thyme. Cu
bebs. etc., so that when the salve Is
applied to the body heat, thess ingre
dients are liberated in the form of
vapors.
VapoRub can be had in three sizes
at all druggists. While compara
tively new in certain parts of the
North, it is the standard home remedy
in the South and West for all forms
of cold troubles over six million jars
were sold last year. VapoRub is par
ticularly recommended for children's
croup or colds, as it is externally ap
plied and can. therefore, be used free

Whale Meat
We are just beginning to realize some of
the tremendous and far reaching after ef
fects of the great war. With the first let
up of the excitement and the strain we
can more calmly count our losses and tend
our wounds and mourn our dead. We can
also begin tq estimate something of the
wondrous changes the war has brought and
the marvelous developments in the fields
of mechanics and science and finance and
sociology and industry and commerce. Al-
ready many nations are having aerial charts
made for mail service and airplanes are
being constructed to carry passengers
across continent and sea. we think in
billions now, instead of millions. Our
social questions have multiplied and be
come more perplexing than ever before.
Surgery, chemistry and industrial achieve
ments have taken giant strides in the past
four years. Few indeed are the habits,
thoughts, circles, conditions, visions, that
have not been changed by the great con
flict. Kings have been banished and peas
ants sit in palaces. A new merchant ma
rine has been created over night on this
side of the globe. Two million of our
young men spent the summer in Europe.
We have turned to war and back to peace,
all within about a year. But did any one ever
dream before hand that this cataclysim
would turn the thought and affection of the
average plug citizen from beefsteak and
pork chop and leg of lamb to whale meat ?
If he did, no Daniel came forward and in
terpreted the dream so that we might be
prepared for the revolution. Think of it,
friends, according to no less- authority than
the Scientific American, which has made
an exhaustive study of the matter, the edi
ble flesh of one whale equals that of one
hundred steers or five hundred sheep.
And whale meat tastes like beef. A whale
steak, they say, is most tender and palat
able. No one knew it or thought of it to
any extent, until the abnormal conditions
of the war stirred the ingenuities and in
itiative of mankind to develop new food re
sources. Experiments extended to whale
meat and its success as a food product was
startling from the first, so they say. Con
sider, an average whale yields tons and
tons of meat. No feed or herd bills. Just
the expense of actually getting the whale.
Here is a herd of steers. Here is a fat meat
and lean equivalent to that 'from a half a
thousand hogs. Have you eaten any whale
meat yet? You may have done so and not
know it. They're serving it in many places
along the Atlantic and Pacific seaboards,
and it tastes like beef. Here is a possible
and practical solution of the sky high cost
of meat.
This column takes occasion at this time
to congratulate the moving spirits of the
Warren district upon the organization of
the Bisbee Luncheon club, consummated
yesterday noon at the Copper Queen hotel.
It is a splendid step, and it marks progress.
While its material good will be more than
a little, it is in morale that it will help most
and in more different ways. In union
there is strength. In good fellowship there
is a tower of strength. At the Tables
of the Luncheon club many fine ideas and
plans for the improvement and added hap
piness and reputation of the district will be
born. And besides these things, there is
material in the new club to yield much
pleasure and entertainment and profit to
the members in the matter of the noon day
talks.
When the men waiters at the famous
Waldorf restaurant in New York went on
a strike the other day for higher wages and
shorter hours and all the other fine things
of which workers dream, they killed the
goose that laid their golden eggs. The man
ager of the Waldorf promptly placed wo
men waiters in the places of the strikers.
And now he finds the new service so satis
factory that he announces that he will keep
the women, even though the strike is called
off and the men wish to return under the
old conditions and at the old wage scale.
He declares that the women excel the men
in every branch of the waiter's art. They
are more deft, more prompt, more pati
ent, more dependable and more satisfac
tory in every way. Now, the world knows
that waiters in popular and high priced
cafes receive in tips every night more
money than the average hard working and
skillful citizen makes in a week at regular
work. The swell cafe waiter who has no
automobile and sealskin overcoat and block
of real estate is improvident and wasteful,
or he has been unfortunate in his invest
ments. To think that these waiters should
have struck, even for a day. And their
brethern of other cafes, how they must exe
crate these strikers, for now their jobs are
also threatened by the shining success of
the female waiters at the Waldorf.

HOUSING IN TUCSON
(Tucson Citizen.)
The action of the chamber of commerce
in launching a movement to provide the
additional housing needed by Tucson will
strike a popular chord. Not only will it
be a boon to winter visitors to provide
roofs for all comers, but it will be a great
thing for those who live here permanently
and have to compete with the winter vis
itors and pay exhorbitant rents.
It has been estimated that two hundred
houses will relieve the immediate conges
tion and the object of the chamber of
commerce is to provide these homes. The
great majority of them will be homes for
rent and when the project is complete it
should be possible to rent a bungalow at
a very reasonable figure from $20 to $35
' a month, according to size. Now five
room bungalows are bringing $40 and $45
unfurnished and as high as $1 50 furnished,
if in a desirable location. Manifestly the
small salaried man cannot compete at these
prices, and is forced to take anything he
can get and his rent check eats heavily into
his salary. As long as Tucson is laboring
mder a burden like this and winter visitors
who ccme here by the hundreds are com
pelled to move on because they cannot find
a location, there is little use of the city ad
vertising its climate and other advantages.
The idea of organizing a quasi-public cor
poration to provide these homes and Jet
those who make it possible to construct,
them benefit by the appreciation of the
adjoining property as well as in the general
benefits which all business and professional
men will receive through the increase in
population, is a splendid one. It is not ex
pected that the project will in any wise in
terfere with normal building. The two
hundred homes which would eventually be
provided would only meet the present
shortage and would not in anywise take
care of the normal growth of the city, which
has been continuous and steady for nearly
twenty years.
The action of the chamber of commerce
in launching this big building project is
epoch-making and shows that Tucson is
fully awake to the necessities of the situa
tion. To provide these two or three hundred.
additional homes, means just two cr three
hundred more customers for every business
in Tucson, the public utilities included and
they can afford to be very liberal in giv
ing their assistance and support to the en
terprise as they will no doubt be glad to do.
The mining companies have already in
augurated a plan not unlike the one above
for the Warren district, except that here.
the new houses are to be owned, and not
rented, by company employes, who pay
for them by the month:
Harry J. Evans, manager of the
Tombstone office of the Mountain
States Telephone & Telegraph com
pany for the past seven years, left
yesterday for Colorado Springs, where
he will join bis family for tne Christ

located with the same company. Har

office, has already taken up his

STORY OF NUMBER 40
Crossing the street from tho Douglas
drug store toward the Phelps Dodge
store Wednesday evening at about 6
o'clock, A. W. Carson, proprietor of
the Carson studio, was struck by a
Willys Knight car driven by Robert
E. Claborne" and injured. Mr. Carson
was walking and when part way
across the street saw the Claborue
machine. Mr. Claborne brought his
car almost to a stop to avoid hitting
him. Carson saw the driver stop the
car, hesitated and then started for
ward. At the same time Mr. Claborue
started his car, as he thought Carson
was going to wait until he got past.
The machine hit Mr. Carson iu the
side and he received a bad bump on
the head, when he fell. He was
taken to bis rooms at the Leslie and
was reported to be getting along very

Senators Sterling of South Dakota,
Warren of Wyoming and Watson of

committee amendment, but because of
absent "pairs" withdrew their votes
and Senator Gay of Louisiana, demo
crat, announced that he was paired
and, although unable to vote for tut
amendment, favored its adoption.
Tne substitute bill which Senator
LaFollette will advance tomorrow
proposes mainly large increases in
the war-xcess profits rates and indi
vidual income surtaxes. In lieu of
the bill's levy of 30 per cent on the
excess of corporation's net income
over credits and under 20 per cent of
invested capital Senator I-aFollette's
bill proposed 33 per cent on profits
undor 15 per cent of invested capital.
Instead of the bill's tax of 60 per cent
on profits in excess of 20 per cent,
the Wisconsin member proposes a tax
of Cn per cent on profits between 15
and 20 per cent, and 70 per cent on
those over 20 per cent.
The LaFollette substitute also pro
poses to retain the 12 per tent tax on
corporation incomes, but would cut
the individual normal rate from 12 to
2 per cent and secure the bulk of in

taxes. In lieu of the bill's surtaxes

SPEECH
OD
To an interested audience, Cleon T.
Knapp, local attorney, delivered an
address upon the subject of conserv
ing food that the world may eat, in
the auditorium of the high school last
night. Mr. Knapp's speech w as punct
uated with pertinent facts and marked
by common sense in the view he ad
vanced of proper application of the
conservation program.
He dwelt upon the necessity for
food conservation, but at the same
time said he did not mean for the
people here to deprive themselves of
necessities; rather, he said, it should
be the rule for all families to have
plenty of wholesome, substantial food,
eliminating from their diet only non
essential luxuries. For luxuries, the
speaker said, plainer, more substantial
fare should be substituted.
Mr. Knapp appealed for food savins
wherever possible, is the name of
180.000,000 people of Europe, now on
the verge of starvation because of the
affliction of the world war. Among
those he appealed for, he was specific
in his failure to include the subjects
of the former central powers.
He dealt at some length with social
and political problems of the day,
emphasizing particularly the world
wide efforts of bolshevists and I. V.
W. to tear down all of the things
built up gradually by democracy.
Mr. Knapp opened his address by
paying a splendid tribute to the mem
bers of the C. & A. band for the free
spirit in which they had given their
services to forward every object of
national betterment, or charity, during
the period of the war.
The band played two selections dur
ing the meeting. Another enjoyable
feature was the singing of two selec
tions by a male quartet.

This District; Hood Still in Douglas
CITY TREASURER NOW
HAS PLENTY FUNDS
County Treasurer Harry S. Ross has
returned to Tombstone after spending
a few days here and at Douglas on
business incident to winding up his
year's business preparatory to deliver
ing his oftice and the funds over to
his successor, Guy Welch, on the first
of the new year.
Mr. Ross is now visiting the banks
of the county in which he has funds
of the county deposited making a final
settlement with the institutions. He
said that he'now holds, a cash balance
of about one million, seven hundred
thousand dollars. This includes all
funds of the county, general, road,
school, etc.
While in the city Mr. Ross delivered
to the city treasurer, M. L. Butler,
the sum of $54,000 on account of
city taxes collected. It is understood
that this amount will enable the city
to cash all outstanding city warrants
which have been registered but not
paid for the want of funds.
Immediately after making transfer
of the county treasurer s offiee to Mr.
Welsh, Mr. Ross will hurry to Phoenix
where he will assume the office of
state treasurer to which he was elect
ed at the general election- in Novem
ber by a majority believed to be the
largest received by any candidate on
the state ticket, though the exact fig
ure he does not know yet.
Three weeks ago Mr. Ross was In
Phoenix and rented a home which he
will move into. He leaves an excel
lent official record in this county and
his friends predict that he will dis
charge the duties of state treasurer
with equal efficiency and satisfaction
to his constituents.
The firm of Hood & Bledsoe, com
posed of J. T. Hood and Frank liled
soe has decided upon a dissolution of
partnership, it was learned yesterday
upon reliable authority. Announce
ment of this fact will be made in the
immediate future.
Mr. Hootl will retain the Ford
agency, garage and other appurte
nances of the business in Douglas, it
is understood, while Mr. Bledsoe, who
has been a resident of this district fo
some time, will retain the Ford
tgency and its appurtenances in this
district. No announcement has been
made as to the apportionment of ter
ritory between the two, who have held
the Ford agency for Cochise county
for a number of years.
Both members of the firm are well
known and popular here, where, prior
to entering the partnership they re
tided for a number of years. Mr.
Hood formerly was cashier of the
Miners & Meichants' bank, while Mr.
Bledsoe was engaged in the drug
business.
They have many well-wishers in the
district who will be pleased to wit
ness even greater- business sue cess for
each of them separately,; than they
have attained together as a firm of
hustling "live wires."
and they are earnestly requested to
he present. Mr. C. W. Irishman is
scout coimuis.;icinT of this district
and Frank Bruiting is head scoutmas
ter. The Y. M. V. A. has given its
rooms tor meetings and there is no
reason why a good Mronr; healthy
organization should not be established
here.

A scoutmaster's club for all - men j
interested in Boy Scout work was ,
formed at the Y. M. C. A. last night.
Several local men who are interested
in boys were present and plans were j
formulated for the inauguration of a I
vigorous campaign for the movement j
in this city. There are already five i
troops of scouts in the district and i
dozens of boys are anxious to get into i
the scouting but the difficulty has '
been lack of men to lead the work, j
Now that the war is over scouting ,
should take on increased interest for
all and at the next meeting which will
be Thursday night at 7:30 it is hoped
a great many men will be present who
are sufficiently interested to become
scoutmasters. No previous experience
is necessary as the work is easy to
learn and immensely interesting as
well as beneficial to both the boys
and their leaders. Young men be
tween the ages of 18 and 21 can also
be of value as assistant scoutmasters

DOCTOR SAID "KEEP
ON TAKING TANLAC"
Mrs. Bieal Gains Twenty
Pounds Wants Others
to Be Helped
"I have not only gained 20 pounds
since I began taking Tanlac, but it
has Hone me so much good that my
doctor after seeing the improvement
this medicine brought, advised me to
keep on taking it," declared Mrs. Mary
Bieal, of 519 Dayton avenue, Seattle,
a tew days ago.
"I feel so grateful for Tanlac, I
don't know what to say," continued
Mrs. Bieal. 'Tor three years I suf
fered such agony with my stomach,
that I wasn't able to do a thine around
the house. In fact, 1 was 'hardly able
to get around at all. I completely
lost my appetite, and what I did force
down caused me so much pain, I
could hardly stand it. Of course this
got my nerves in a terrible condition,
and I hardly knew what it was to
sleep at night, I'd just roll and toss
until morning.
"At last I got so bad off. that I was
taken to the hospital, and had an ope
ration performed. I was there for five
weeks, and wheovl finally got back
home, I was a perfect wreck. I was
so weak I couMn't move around the
house at all and had to stay right
in bed and my husband had to leave
his work and wait on me. I had the
best attention I could get but nothing
seemed to give me any strength and
although I tried and tried to get up
and move around, it was no use. 1
was too weak; I just couldn't do it.
Everybody insisted that I go back to
the hospital, but I said: 'No.' I had
been through so much I just couldn't
bear the thought of going back there
again.
"Then I decided to try Tanlac, as I
had heard so much about it and it's
the honest truth this medicine did
more for me than I ever thought any
thing could do. I have taken six bot
tles now, and my stomach is in splen
did condition. I have a fine appetite
and can eat anything I want and never
suffer the least bit afterwards.
"Tanlac certainly has built me up
wonderfully. Just think, before I took
it, I didn't have strength enough to
set my own table, nd now I can do ev
ery bit ot my house work, even to the
washing, if necessary, and I sleep like
a child and wake up in the mornings
feeling refreshed and full of life. I've
gained 20 pounds and look so well that
my doctor told me to keep right on
taking Tanlac, and you may be sure
I'm going to do it. I'm glad for ev
eryone to know what Tanlac has done
for me and hope the story of my case
will help other sufferers to get the
same relief."

BY REVIEW
MCV YORK. Dec. 19. Trading in
seciiities during the greater part ot
today's sesson was dull to the point
c stagnation, the stock market itself
being most often overshadowed bv
lurtiier persistent' liquidation of Lib
erty bonds.
This condition experienced a sud
den transformation in the final hour,
when heavy selling of high grade
shares, notably rails, swept over the
stock market, effecting extreme re
versals of 2 to 4 points.
Transactions in Liberty bonds at
tained enormous proportions, the
fourth 4V4s contributing more than
their usual quotas at the new low
record of $94.72. This represents a
depreciation of 3"i per cent from
their initial quotation on the stock
exchange.
Various theories were advanced in
explanation of the further break iu
the government's latest war flotation,
these bearing, mainly on the cash re
quirements of corporations and insti
tutions early in the coming year.
This theory lacked plausibility, how
ever, as call loans were plentiful Tit
4 to 4V4 per cent.
Among leading stocks United States
Steel made a better showing than
other industrials and equipments, for
feiting only a large fraction. Total
sales of stocks amounted to 400,000
shares.
Traction bond Issues were heavy
with Liberty bonds, but the interna
tional group held steady. Total sales,
par value, aggregated $20,5000,000.
Old United States were unchanged on
call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Dec. 19. Prospects that
a squeeze might be encountered in
filline contracts for nearby deliver
ies had a strengthening effect today i
on December and January corn, but
later months were '.Inclined to sag.
The close was unsettled, January
$1.36 to $1.36 and May $1.3874 to
$1.35, with the market as a whole
off to 1 up compared with yester
day's finish. Oats lost V to . The
outcome on the provisions was un
changed to 35c lower.
Bulls in corn put emphasis on the
fact that stocks of corn here amount
ed to virtually nothing. In this con
nection it was pointed out that coun
try roads in many sections were in
bad shape as a result of bad weather,
and that farmers' deliveries were re
stricted. Besides, temperatures were
unseasonably high, a circumstance
which counted against any heavy
movement of the crop during the near
future. On the other hand, predicted
rains were not in evidence and bears
took due notice that it had again be
come permissible to carry gr&vi store
for an unlimited period.
Slowness of export call and of do
mestic shipping sales tended to de
press oats.
Continued excessive marketing oi
hoss had a weakening influence on
provisions. Despite. "big shipments of
lard and meats, buyers were extra
cautious.

KEPT HER AWAKE
The Terrible Pains in Back and
Sidles. Cardoi Gave Relief.
Marksville, La. Mrs. Alice Johnson,
of this place, writes: "For one year I
suffered with an awful misery in my back
and sides. My left side was hurting me
all the time. The misery was something
awful.
I could not do anything, not even sleep
It nighL It kept me awake most of the
night ... I took different medicines, but
nothing did me any good or relieved me
until 1 took Cardui ...
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. I got
to bad with my back that when I stooped
down I was not able to straighten up
gain ... I decided I would try Cardui
... By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
itraighten up and my pains were nearly
all gone.
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." It you suffer from pains due to
female complaints, Cardui may be Just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

In a war emergency measure enacted
a year ago following the declaration
of war. At that time it was decided
to waive the literacy test and other
qualifications for the admisison of
foreigners in order to fill the gap
caused by the departure of soldiers
from the mines and agricultural fields
of the southwest. . ,
Many thousands of Mexicans came j
to this country unaer mis ruling ui
order to get the high wages offered.
This spe.cial ruling was abrogated yes
terday, however, as shown by the fol
lowing aelegram received from Wash
ing ton by F. W. Heath, immigration
inspector in charge at Douglas.
"Departmental orders of June 12
and July 10, 1917. concerning admis
sion of Mexican laborers abrogated
with provisions for admission up to
January 15 of such laborers for whom
permit has been granted on or prior
to December 18. No new permits' un
der said orders are to be granted or
applications received after December
18. Give such notice as. will reach
the Mexican authorities and others in
terested without delay."
The new order will be pleasing to
some of the labor union men of the
state who did not. regard the admis
sion of so many Mexicans, even as an
emergency measure, with much pleasure.
BABY BONDS MAKE
GOOD XMAS PRESENTS
"Give twice at one price." This sug
gestion i ; mailt by Secretary of the
Treasury W. G. McAdoo to the people
of Arizona when he urges that war
savings stamps (baby bonds) and
thrift stamps, little brothers of the
baby bonds.' be given as Christmas
presents. By making baby bonds and
thrift stamps Christmas presents a
double gift Is made, the direct fift
to the individual and the investment
asked for by the government. Thus
the most userul kind of a present is
given and the government is given the
help it needs to support the army of
occupation in Germany and to bring
that army home again when the task
is done.
Artistic little folders have been pro
duced to hold one or more baby bonds
and even to hold thrift stamps. These
litt'.c folders have upon them suitable
Christmas wishes, neatly printed, and
it is an easy question to answer:
"Who would not be delighted by Uie
gift of a baby bond on Christmas
morning?"
ThU Christmas is or should be one
of the moat Joyous in the history of
the world. Gilts will be made in the
spirit of the" day, a day devoted to
the Prince of Peace. In addition to
the handsome and useful things which
can be obtained everhere, the ever
present baby bond which can be pur
chased at every postoffrte, makes an
ideal gift which will keep the giver in
the mind of the receiver for at least
four years for during the period up to
January 1, 1923, the baby bond grows
steadily in value and matures shortly
after that Christmas day of four years
hence.
It is believed' that the suggestion of
the secretary of the treasury that
baby bonds be used for Christmas
gifts in Arizona will meet with gener
ous response from the people of this
patriotic state.
Let ub an join fervently in hoping
that Mr. Glass, the new secretary of
the treasury, doesn't crack under the
strain. Newark News.
