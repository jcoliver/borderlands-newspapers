WASHINGTON. Feb. 21. Army of
ficii! showed every evidence of sur-
pr.se today at press dispatches Iroi
France teil'Dg of German control ol
tbe air over the sector of the front
held by the American forces. ' They
would make no comment for publica
tion however, and Se:retary 'Eaker
also was silent beyond saying that hl
advices frcm General Persbin? malo
no mention of srch a situation.
Disclosure of te coadirions de
scribed by the dispatches comes on
the bee's of Secretary Raker's an
nouncement yesterday that American
built battle plane3 had bee nshippeil
to France five months ahead of the
crisinal schedule and soon would be
ready in quantities. ' This statement
does net mean tht the whole pro
Kram for the American air fleets is
so far ahead, and it is understood that
actually it is not far from the sche
dule cne way or the other. The ex
art string of the program is a care
rally kuarded secret.
Pershing Sole Judge.
Secretary Baker eaid tcdav in re
sponse to questions ab'nt the cab'e
dispatches that any pub!icfty of that
nature must come from General
Pershing, who alone is able to judse
of the military value of the inform.v
tion.
There are certain considerations, it
was pointed out by some officers none
of whom claimed actual kowjedge uf
the situation at the American front.
-bich to their minds made, it te
more str-prisine that a comple'e lac
of adequate air patrols should exist
there. In the first place General
Pershing was fully advised as to ail
matters regarding the American air
ervice and the degree to which h
could rely cpon it when he decided
to put tbe forces into the line.
Also and great stress was laid on
this he has been working in com
plete co-operation with the French
government in ge'ting bis men to the
front. So far as known, fbe particular

airmen, presumably French, before , , . x

lem, goesf ar deeper than supplies to
the allies. During the last three
months we have far fallen behind in
movement of foodstuffs from the farms
to ihe consuming and storage centers.
Up to the first of February less than
i0 percent of the normal ratio of corn
has been moved, less than SO percent
of the oats and less than 60 percent
of the potatoes. From November 1 to
January 1 we were short in the usual
movement of grains and grain pro
ducts into the terminals alone by over
120.000 carloads over 120.000.000 bush
els and this was further aggravated
by similar shortage outsideathc termi
nals. May Lose Corn
Furthermore, this year we have j
tne largest percentage oi soil corn in
many years and though we have a rec
ord crop of corn, a considerable por
tiono f the soft corn will be lost by
spoiling unless it can be moved fn the
next sixty days to the drying termi
nals. The least amount of grain that
must be loaded fur the nextsix ty day
is 8,000.000 bushels per day and we
have not yet attained that. Less than
this will solve neither the allied nor
our own domestic situation.
"We have about 130,000 carloads of
potatoes on November 1 which should
have been moved from the principal
producing centers, and up to the first
of February we had moved about 28,
000 carloads while we should have
moved over 50,000 in this period. The
result is that potatoes are piled up
spoiling in the producers' hands, and
the consuming centers have only been
supplied by virtue of the summer gar
dens and other stores carriei over
from last year. There is a great deal
of livestock which has been ready for
the market for some time, but is still
held in the farmers' hands through in
ability to secure transportation. These
cattle are eating their heads off with
out increasing their meat value and
are only adding to the costs of the far- j
mer and consuming the grain.
"The effect of this delayed move
ment has been manifold.
"First, to jeopardize the safety of a
great deal of the soft coi n and perish
ables, such as potatoes.
Farmers Returns Diminished
"Second, the stricture in flow of dis

price conditions in the country by
practically suspending the law of sup

forts of the railway administration in
the movement of foodstuffs in every
direction to tbe exclusion of much oth
er commerce of the country. Consid
erable progress has been made in the
last ten days, but continued rises in
the prices of cereal commodities and
he failure to secure sufficient surplus
over immediate domestic consumption
to feed the allies, areerldence that
there is still a deficiency in food cars
ana that they need be still further in-;

Reduce Tax On Railways
"Comparisons of the movements ;
from day to day during the last few j
days with movements of similar nen-
ods last year reflect the efforts being i
made by the railway directorate I
have, however, a long occumulation '
to be got over and to be got over with-1

calls for every co-operation or the pub-:

WASHINGTON.
Not in the century and a quarter
since Washington's death has the an
niversary of tis birth meant so cinch
to his country as it does this year.
This tall, strong, kind, patient, reso
lute Virginian was the dominant and
outstanding type of the new Republic
of America. He was nerer a brilliant
military genius or a great statesman.
He was more than either of these
things; he was a MAX! Simple,
gentle, unostentatious, practical, he
adapted his high moral courage .and
the powers of his well balanced mind
to terrible and discouraging condi
tions and carri-ed them through to
success. His patience and persever
ance and tact and nobility of charac
ter, rather than his unusual or bril
liant talents won for him his victories
In civil and military life. His ideals
were high and hi motives unselfish,
hence his strength, for he was unas
sailable in what is generally the weak
est point with leaders and public
men. We think of Warh'ngton al
ways as Erst in peace and first in
war. The United States aspires to-1
day to be first in these two; these
contrasts; these paradoxes; these im
perative necessities to a nation's
greatness and permanency. Wash-
intrtoa was too kind and too gentle
and too humane and too noble to hatre
loved peace for peace sake. And he
was too big and too practical and too
high-minded to hesitate to draw the
sword when the bully crosses the
deadline set by forbearance. He
fatoeM for freedom against English
autocracy. His country now fights
side by side with English democracy
for freedom for weaker peoples. How
Washington's great heart would ex
pand and his noble glance kindle if
h- could be alive today to see Ameri
cans press forward to finish the figtt
he began. How deeply he would be
affected to see h!s little nation, now
grown to be so large, paring In heap
ed and rounded measure the debt he
owed to France. Washington en
dured defeat and privation for eight
bitter years. Despair sat at his right
hand. But .he , fought on. And he
won. as they always do who ficht on
for the riebt and never giv? no.
France sent money and men and eiips
to save Washington. And today, upon
the anniversary of Washington's birth,
the very angels smile while we send
men and mony and ships to France
in order to keep burning that torch
lighted by the great, unselSsh and
kindly hands of the Father of His
Country. Today, pledged to a death
grapple mith autocracy, we can oo
serve thy natal day and honor thy
memory mith uplifted eyes and un
blushing face. Thy republic is not
degenerate. Thy ideals still stanQ
before its eyes. Thy spirit lives on.
Flease God. we will pay the debt of
Lafayette.

regular weekly issues cf Treasury
certificates which may later be ex
changed for bonds. In this connec
tion the most s:gni3cant development
was the fall in 2nd Libert 43 to
94.70. the lowest price on record. The
decline was evidently due to liqulda
tion. and selling by financial institu-!
tions and others in order to facilitate
subscriptions for the next issue; also
In part to the fear cf a possible pro
longation of tte war. The declines in
these bonds will not cause the tf'ght-!

first step in this direction is to keep
business as active and as profitable,
within reason, as possible. If through
ill-advised legislation, excessive taxa
tion or government interference, pros
perity is unduly checked, the princi
pal sources of income and taxation
mill be dried up and the country drift
into a serious crisis. Fortunately
such danger is clearly foreseen, and
the Administration has some of the
ablest and most patriotic financiers
of the country at its command.
AMERICA'S PART.
A noted military critic, in an arti
cle placing the complex western bat
tle front clearly before th layman's
eye. declares that the allies forces in
the west have been formed into a
vast army reaching from Switzerland
to the sea. Of this army the BrtUsh
form the left wing, some one hundred
and twenty miles long, from the- sea
to La Fere; the French hold the cen
ter, three hundred miles of It, from
La Fere to the Vosges mountains.
The Americans arc being inserted at
the Lorraine sorter and will eventual
ly hold the right wing, or lower end
of the line, one hundred miles in
length, from Lorraine to the Vosges.
This is a vital sector of the great
front When the great forward move
ment against Germany really begins,
it is through Lorraine that the Erst
advance mill be made, for that is the
easiest and most practical road to the
heart of the German empire. What
a day for America when the Sam
mies push forward into the land of
Joan of Arc and pound upon the door
-f the great German fortress ot
Metz! A hundred miles of the battle
line. Held by . million American
Lboys. Ten thousand to the mile. A
half million reserves. Happy dream.
And oh, that it may soon come true.
A STUDY IN SCARLET.
Dr. VonKuehlman. addressing the
Cerman Reiihstag yesterday, uttered
words in setting forth the present
Hunnish aims that every American
man and woman should read and write
upon the wall in letters so large that
those who run may read also. He
said: "Germany is prepared to con
clude a peace mhirb corresponds with
her interests." He was speaking of
his nation's dealings with Ukraine
and Russia. And this is the real!
basis of a German peace at this time.
One that "corresponds with- her in
tercets." That v as the kind of a
peace she just forced upon Russia and
Ukraine. Taking thousands of
miles of territory upon which she has
do shadow of A claim except by con
quest; seizing millions 'of subjects
and exacting billions cf roubles in in-
! dennity. This p-'ace "corresponds
-rith German interests." In fact, "cor
responds" is a weak word with whi:h
to describe the be?ring this pace has
icon Germany's "r at crests." But mhat
about the "interc-.ts" of those Rus
sians of the lest rrovinces of the for
mer Russian empire? They will
clank th?ir c.ba!ns for the next nun-
dred years with a louder noise than
ever they clanked before if Germany
is not beaten on the western front
The hope of th3 world lies on tha:
battle front from Switzerland to the
sea. just as it lav some fifteen cen
turies ago upon a narrower front in
this same land mhen Charles Martel
struck the Saracens at Tours with
the French hammer and shattered the
hope cf Mchammedism to rule all of
the then known wcrld.

A READER WRITES.
A Bisbee subscriber left an inter?st
ing note and a large batch of clippings
upon the editor's desk yesterday. This
reader is intensely patriotic and is ev
idently keeping close tab upon all
things pertaining to the war, judging
from the range of thought covered by
the clippings. After warning the ei
itor that there is a woman in this
district with strong German and I. W.
W. cympathies (they seem to always
go hand in hand) and predicting tin
the wobbliee mill again soon try tc
stir up trouble here, the subscriber
goes on to defend the government in
the prosecution of the war. President
Wilson has a strong admirer here,
and cne who resents any criticism ot
his cabinet or his course. And yet it
is only by honest and friendly and
constructive criticism that any big and
worthy thing; is accomplished by pub
lic servants. Criticism and com
plaints are too often mixed with the
latter dominating the mixture. But
the watchful Interest of this subscrib-
r'
the trend of common thought and the
strength of, public sentiment every
where for the fighting of thj world
war to a finish.

didates announced is between W. A.
Moeur and Fred Colter with the bet
ting odds heavily on the land commis
sioner from Maricopa. Moeur geogra
phically is from the center of popula
tion in the state. Maricopa county,
where he has lived the past fifteen or
more years. Colter is from the sparse
ly settled north. Apache county. Moeur
has had no pat political affiliations j
which could deflect support. Colter j
has frequently been called on to align j
himself with one or another faction
and naa be,?n looked on as more or
Jless of a Hunt partisan. Moeur's ree-
br(, , offlce ha h blemished,
Colter's record has been good. Moeur
has demonstrated his party principles
and staunchness beyond doubt Col-
er has occasionally been questioned.
The Maricopa county vote of course
will be divided. Osborn is a native
sort of Arizona and a resident of Mari
copa. His strength, horn-ever, in a race
against Moeur. l ardly would measure
up mith his past ability to poll votes.
Party affiliations and record will as-
operation of the public mind. Judge!

Shares 3c Now
FOR A FEW DAYS ONLY
The gre&l progress that has been mad: by this Company, and the obvious fact
the Chino Valley Oil Boom is fast devel oping into a "strong reality, makes the
treasury shares of the United Chino, at ths present price, a speculative investment
that is seldom equaled and never excelled. Th's price will again be raised within
a few days.
What Has Been Accomplished in Two Short -Months
Just a little more than two months ago. we offered you treasury shares of
this company at the exceedingly small figure of 2 cents per share, cash, an addi
tional 2 cents per share to be paid when we were producing oil in commercial
quantities.
In this short time, by. using our stockholders" money in furthering their in
terests, and by efficient business methods which are necessary for the success of
ANY business enterprise, we have bought complete drilling equipment a3 fine as it
is possible to buy-anywhere in the country, and we have this equipment in the
field, where a strained effort is being made by a large force of men. under com
mand of one of the most aggressive engineers in the west, to get the machinery
set up, the rig built and the beam bobbing.
At the present time, these men are driving away, with the assistance of expert
men from the producing fields of Southe n California the rig is being construct
ed, 18 men are actively employed by the company, and several big six-horse teams
are hauling the heavy machinery to the spst where our No. I well will be put down.
Net a penny is being wasted, but the enti-e financial energy of our treasury and the
physical and mental energy of the men behind this company, are concentrated on
making our enterprise a SUCCESS
A Talk With an Oil Expert
Last week, the writer spent two day? ir. the field, in the company of oil ex
pert? from CDl:forr:a and others, among tScm Driller DeWiit, a man who was for
many years with the Standard Oil people a practical oil man who has spent his
life, fince he was 8 years old (and he is now 53) in the various oil fields of the
world. Mr. DeWitt will be associated wita this company in putting down our first
well.
We took him to the ground where oar well had been spotted by experts arid
asked him what he thought of the country. We told him frankly that expense was
no object that we had moved the location of our well from near the railroad to
its present location on the Ritter anti-elite in the Black Forest, four miles away,
because that spot had been chosen by experts as the most LOGICAL place to
drill for oil. Mr. DeWitt, after a careful svudv of the surrounding country, stated
most emphatically that he believed we haj tle chcicsst piece of ground in the dis
trict, and that if we did not bring in a flo'vir.g well, his forty years in the game had
taught him nothing He explained his position in the matter, by calling attention
to surface indications which he said could be caused ONLY BY GAS FROM BE
LOW which means OIL Mr. De Witt predicts a FLOWING WELL and so
thoroughly enthusiastic is he about the prospects in the CHINO VALLEY, that he is
going to REMAIN THERE, although he came from California to do temporary
work in building our rig and setting up the drilling rig.
We Have Kept the Faith and We Believe We'll Get the Oil
Do you know why UNITED CHINO OIL b the most popular and most talked
of issue in the state of Arizona today?
Do you why we have hundreds of friends throughout the state, who are con
stantly expressing their confidence in this company, and backing up that confi
dence with their financial support?
Do you know why the recognized brokerage houses of this state, men with big
folbwinss who handly only clean-cut issues of responsible companies, are handl
ing UNITED CHINO?
The Answer Is Simply Because We Have Kept the Faith
We have used the money received from the sale cf our treasury stock in a
legitimate manner. We have spent thousands of dollars in buying equipment and
supplies, and we've spent NOTHING unless we believed absoluielv it was for the
benefit of the company. We have created an ACTUAL DEVELOPMENT FUND
which quickly assumed substantial proportions, and we are bending e"ery possible
effort toward MAKING BIG MONEY for those who have had confidence enough
in us to give us their financial support.
We Are Willing to Stand on What We Have Accomplished
Today, the future of the UNITED CHINO seems absolutely assured. We have
stock subscriptions already which insure ample funds to continue our aggressive
operations, and the value of this stock is increasing even day. It will be impossi
ble, after a few days from now, for anyone to buy UNITED CHINO at the present
price, because that price will positively b; raised, and probably doubled, within a
very short time.
The Day We Spud In
UNITED CHINO oil stock will have a value cf at least twice the present price.
As the drill goes down, that value will incease. and when the oil is struck and
we hnve reached the point where ve believe most positively that it .W ILL BE
UNITED CHINO stock should easilv be vorth a hundred times its present price.
IN NINETY DAYS TIME, we have ever,- reason to believe that UNITED CHINO
will be selling for around 50 cents per share.

SPECIAL ATTENTION GIVEN COPPER STOCi
Pecos Valley. Oil
This field in which oil has been known to exist for
many years is now being rapidly developed. A num
ber of the big companies being in the field. Among
them being the Great Western Oil and Refining Co.
The Standard Oil Company. The . Home Investment
Company of Oklahoma. All of these companies have
already brought in one or more producing wells ani5
are sinking other wells rapidly. Land in what is known
to be proven oil land extending frcm 40 to 50 miles in
length on either side of the Pecos river and from 1 2 to
1 5 miles in width, this land, much of which was of very
little value for any other purpose, is row eagerly sought
after and high prices paid for oil leases. Among the
most active companies in the field is the Lake Arthur
Oil Company, with 18,000 acres in the heart of the
proven field. This is the pioneer company and the land
was carefully selected by Prof. Milton McVVhorter, when
the choice of the entire field was to be had. Pxof. Mc
Whorter is an authority on oil lands and has visited
" personally practically all the cil fields of any conse
quence in this country and Europe. He Is now devoting
his entire time in this field and states that this will be
the largest oil field in the Uni'ed States and that the oil
is a paraffin base and runs very high in gasoline.
The Lake Arthur company has three fully equipped
oil rigs working. One well already producing oil and
two ether wells rearing the oil depth which should be
brought in within the next 60 days. These wells be
ing sunk are artesian wells, which have always produced
some cil, but are now being deepened down to the main
oil bearing sands. The artesixn water has been cased
out by forcing cement down through small pipes by
which the artesian water is entirely eliminated. Bisbee
people have now perhaps the ory opportunity they will
have to get some of this stock at one dollar per share, as
when sufficient funds are raised to pay for casing the
two new wells being sunk, there will most likely he no
necessity for more stock to be sold, as the oil produced
is now bringing $3.00 per barrel at the refinery atLake
Arthur. This will notnly pay for further development
but will soon be paying dividends to its stockholders.
The di rectors, at a meeting on January 3 1st, passed
a resolution that after April 1st. 1918, no more stock
would be sold for less than $2.00 and if the new wells
now being drilled are heavy producers, such as the first
one, the price will be far above $2.00
