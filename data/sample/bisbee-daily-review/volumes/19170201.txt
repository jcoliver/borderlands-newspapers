GENERAL WOOD FLAYS
DEPARTMENT Al
flllLAS FAILURES
Federalize National Guards and Kick Out the Cobwebs in the
War Department and Put a Swift Moving Force of Busi
ness Men There, He Shouts Heatedly Batters Away the
Opposition to Universal Service.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 1 .Major General Leonard
Wood, recalled today for cross-examination before the senate
universal training sub-committee, said army officers were, not
disposed to shirk responsibility for the war department's short
comings in the distribution of the national guard to the border,
but reiterated .that the guards system was indefensible, be
cause of defects inherent in its make-up.
Militia a Tragedy.
Tomorrow the committee will cross-examine Major Gen
eral Hugh L. Scott, chief of staff, who in his testimony several
weeks ago took a stand similar to that of General Wood.
General Wood repeated today his assertion that the mobiliza
tion was a tragedy, but also declared he did not intend to
criticize the officers and men
'vicious, defensible system.
In War, Would Be Hopeless.
"By supreme effort in six months' time," he said, "we
got 1 58,000 men to the border. The country could have been
eaten up by an efficient enemy in that time."
Senator Lee pointed out that the
regular army had played its part in
the failures.
Raps War Department.
"Yes," said General Wood, "and I
would go after the war department
with a sand bag and reorganize it."
Need Mhnitions Dept. -
The greatest failhre of the federal
government. General Wood said, was
the supply system. Great Britain
had facd the same thing, he said,
when the European war came and
found it .necessary to abandon her
whole system and create- a depart
ment of munitions.
Wants Business Men.
"If the border trouble had gone to
a real war, he said, "we would have
had to do that: create a commission
with some live, energetic business
men upon it. We would -have had to
shake the cobwebs out of the supply
department and get some punch into
it: convert it from a wheelless veh
icle to something that would run."
The men and offirere of the guard
are high minded patriot ir individuals.
General Wood said, but not soldiers.
"It would have been murder to
send them against any fairly efficient
foe," he added.
Swiss System Faulty
Senator Lee led the discussion to
Here's Promise Germany
Made to U. S. and Broke
When the Sussex was sunk the .
President, threatening a severance of j
relations, wrote:
"If it is still the purpose of the Im

law and the universally recognized
dictates of humanity, the government
of the United States is at last forced

U. S. Had to Threaten.
"Unless the imperial German gov
ernment should now Immediately de- j
clare and effect an abandonment of
its present nietbodF by Methods of
submarine warfare against passenger
and freight carrying vessels, the gov
ernment of United States can have
no choice but to sever diplomatic re
lations with the German empire alto
gether. This action the government
of the United States contemplates
.with the greatest reluctance but feels
constrained to take in behalf of hu
manity and the rights of neutral na
tions." Germany's Promise.
To this note the German govern-
ment acceded in its reply of May 4,
191C, in what has become known as
the Sussex pledge, as follows: -
"The German government, guided
of the guard, but only the
the Swiss military system which, he
declared, had solved the problem of
dual control of the military forces by
state and federal governments.
"Dual control is a rotten system In
Switzerland, if1 it exists," General
Wood said. Moreover he did not be
lieve any alternative from universal
service offered itself short of pay for
soldiers at a prohibitive rate. The
national guard of the rank and file,
General Wood said, were eager for the
enactment of universal service legis

Says War
Inevitable
NEW YORK WORLD.
There can be only one answer on
the pirt of the United States to the
new German submarine proclamation,
and that answer should be made to
day. The German ambassador must
receive his passports forthwith and
diplomatic relations must cease at
once. We have every concession to
Germany that self respect will permit
and all those concessions have proved
to be in vain. No peace is worth the
surrender of a nation's sovereign
rights.

President Wilson has been more
than patient. He must now decide
whether the United States shall suf
fer the loss of the major part of her
foreign commerce or go to war. And
Germany is talking to a man of cour
age as well as to a master of dip

Worcester (Mass.) Telegram.
It is a declaration of war against
the United States, sent in the form
of an insult which red-blooded Amer
icans cannot stand for. It is the most
astonishing paper ever issued by a
government sustained by a sane peo
ple. Baltimore Sun.
The government is now facing the
most critical situation of the whole
war. We cannot temporize. There
must be no more illegal killing of
American citizens on the high seas.
If insistence upon this means a break
with the central powers, then the
break must come.
Arizona Republican.
The note of Germany announcing
a resumption of unrestricted subma
rine warfare makes scraps of paper
of all understandings hitherto reached
between Washington and Berlin on
that subject. Germany reverts to her
position, back down, or prepare for
eventualities. Germany was not
bound, of course, by her temporary
acceptance of our view. We were
given due notice that her future con
duct on the sea would depend upon
our success in persuading Great Brit
ain to alter her conduct. We have not
succeeded.
Albuquerque (N. M.) Journal.
Germany evidently believes she has
counted the cost of this last desper
ate step which makes severance of
diplomatic relations with the United
States inevitable.

WASHINGTON. Jan.
f
are.
A starvation blockade of England, the like of which the world never has seen, was
announced to the world today in notes delivered to American Ambassador Gerard in Ber
lin and to the state department here by Count von Bernstorff.
Thus begins the long-feared campaign of ruthlessness, conceived by Von Hinden
burg, it is said here, on a magnitude never even contemplated by Von Tirpitz.
Break Relations at Least, Expected.
Again the United States faces severance of diplomatic relations with Germany
with all its eventual possibilities. President Wilson's repeated warnings of "a-world-a-fire"
and Secretary Lansing's "verge of war" statement are being recalled in the capital
tonight with feelings of apprehension and misgiving.
Germany's action is the super-crisis of all those that have stirred the American gov
ernment in two and a half years of world war.
Wilson Amazed by Warlike Message.
Talk of peace in Europe and means of preserving the peace of the world have gone
glimmering. President Wilson, incredulous at first when the unofficial text of Ger
many's warning was brought to him, at once called for the official document which had
just been presented to Secretary Lansing by the German ambassador. Mr. Lansing abso
lutely refused to comment. President Wilson began immediately a careful study of the
document.
Three Courses Open To President
The President has the task of deciding what shall be the course of the United
States. Three immediate steps appear among the possibilities. The United States might
solemnly warn Germany against a violation of her pledges; it might be decided that the
German warning is sufficient notice of an intention to disregard those pledges and a suf
ficient warrant for breaking off diplomatic relations; it might be decided to await the
results of the blockade and determine the course of the United States as the actual oper
ations develop.
Aim To Starve Britain In Thirty Days.
On almost every side Germany's drastic action is interpreted as an open confession
of the effectiveness of the British food blockade. It is regarded as a determination to
strike back in kind.
German officials in the United States estimate the food supply on the British Isles
will last a month.
May End War in Month.
Admittedly the plan is to carry starvation to the doors of England with swift,
staggering strokes, as a fulfillment of Germany's announced determination to end the
war quickly. She counts on the operations of an unheard of number of submarines to
deliver blows to bring England to her knees within sixty days. One German official here
predicted today the war would be over in a month.
Conveyed to the world as her an-
swer to the refusal of the entente al
lies to talk peace, Germany's latest
warning says:
"From February 1. 1917. within
barred zones around Great Britain,
France and Italy in the eastern Med
iterranean all sea traffic forthwith
will be opposed. '
Repudiates Promises.
It virtually is a renewal and an ex
tension of the celebrated submarine
blockade of the British Isles pro
claimed on February 4. 1913. and
which became effective February 16,
1915. Under it ships were sunk with
out warning until Germany abandoned
the practice and gave her assurances,
in the Sussex case, to abide by in
ternational law. The Lusitania, Fal
aba, and scores of other ships were,
sunk under1 the decree.
American citizens and American
ships are warned from entering the
war zones, although certain precau

The town of Clarksto'An, in the Ait:
fieid, was "jumped" Saturday, accord
ing to Secretary John Caret l"J, of the
liisbee-Ajo Copptr company, who re
turned Irom a v. sic of inspection to
the Ajo district yesterday.- According
to Carretto, tiie town waj originally
own. d by Sam Clark, who had tdased
out about I'jur claims on v. ich the
town was subsequently built. ClarK
is said to have been denied ciiizm
ship papers recently, which. If true,
j would bar him from ownership of the
property.
I Although Clarkstown residents are
said to have known this, no one
seemed to be particularly anxious to
"jump" the town until Saturday when
C. T. Reddington, an attorney, C. .
Carpenter, mining engineer, and L. M.
Allen, an Ajo mining man, calmly
walked around the town, dime in a
I few stakes, and announced that iu the
future they would be known s's the
owners of the town. There was no
uif.n of violence during the procedure,
but a hot legal contest is expected io
result if the "claim jumpers' attempt
to collect rem IiVini property owners,
j wiiich is said to amount to between
Uuooo and $!40oo a .nonih. CarreUo

to need an army and navy at all, we shall nee? big and

And if a world fed iratiou comes, we may want them io

of tiaining would doubtless do us good.
The view is steadily strengthening that we need a com
pulsory training system not of the Prussian barracks sort,
but of the Swiss type, which makes all able-bodied men
undergo the physical development and military drill
necessary for a soldier, without drawing citizens away
unduly from their civilian pursuits and without maintain
ing a large and expensive standing army. These summer
training camps seem to be really paving the way for the
Swiss system.

WOMEN
AND TOOLS.
The old idea that a woman has no mechanical ability J nients, seasons of "training
educated has its Women's Athletic Association or its
Girls' Field Association. Physical education for women
in these schools has widened rapidly to include real
athletics. Dumb bell drills and wand drills are really
a very small part of the modern girl's physical training.
In most colleges she plays hockey, baseball and basket
ball. There are regular teams and championship tourna-
"scrub" and first teams.
has been severely jolted. Since women took to overalls
and tackled the work of men in munition factories, evi
dence has been accumulating that they are far more tal
ented in this direction than the male sex, or they them
selves, ever suspected. Women have made good as me
chanics In America, just as they have in Europe.
In an article in the Saturday Evening Post, Forrest
Cressey gives almost incredible reports of woman's
achievements in overalls. He tells of one youtig woman
in a Philadelphia manufacturing plant who was put to
work on a machine previously tended by a man recog
nized as a "very fair worker." When she had been on the.
job a much shorter time than it usually took a man 10
learn it. she was found to be turning out two and one
half times the product of her predecessor. Another young
woman, taking a certain machine-tool job on which a
"good man" had been turning out six units of produce
per hour, was soon turning out 51 perfect units per hour.
These cases are admittedly exceptional, but they merely
emphasize the discovery that "women are wonderful
workers along mechanical lines." They are found to have
a "deftness of movement and a touch that are marvellous
and that turn out work with surprising facility. They arc
nimble of mind and finger; and as ordinary operators,
tool operators and inspectors they have given account of
themselves calculated to warm the heart of any executive
who is pushing for production." It is found that their
work is as high in quality as it is impressive in volumes
The manual dexterity of women at mechanical tasks
might have been expected. Girts are usually more n'Pible
and accurate in using their fingers and hands than boys.
But an efficiency expert declares that they also iie their
brains with better results.
"When it comes to a natural feeling for mechanics." he
fcays, "you would be astonished at the startling demon
strations we have of that here at our plant every day.
It's simply the case of another feminine intuition taking
the short cut and beating the man to it. There are girls
who have been working here only a few months and
who are without technical training, who have an under
standing of machinery that one would think impossible
except as a result of an engineering course."
All of which exemplifies the old truth that man had
never understood woman, and never will. Also another
argument for scx-ecjuality. How can a proud male refuse
either the right to work for equal wages or the risht to
vote on equal terms to a woman who beats him at his
own specialty? '
There are indoor and outdoor track meets with nearly all
he events that are run off in the men's meets. Trophies',
medals, sweaters and jersies with letters and numerals
have long been awarded the victors.
Heretofore intercollegiate contests for women have
been frowned upon by leaders in physical training. But
if the proposed convention really takes place one may
expect almost anything. Probably the discussion will be
confined to a comparison of methods and organizations,
the handling and financing of local associations, sports in
cluded in the athletic schedules, and other perfectly sale
problems. But anyone who hasn't been following the de
velopment of women's athletics had better not attempt
prophecy in this field.
SHIPPING.
Tiie American shipping boom continues to grow in vol
ume as the world's shipping is depleted by the war. Ex
perts say that nearly 10 per cent of all the nations', mer
chant tonnage has been destroyed, and the rate of de
struction is increasing.. Great Britain has lost at least
one-eighth cf her merchantmen. British shipbuilders have
made great efforts to replace their losses, but not more
than two-thirds of the sunken ships have been made good.
A Norwegian shipbuilder says that there is at least three
years' work in sight for ali the shipyards in the rorid
merely in restoring the war losses.
Our own yards gain an ever increasing share in this
bocm. Never in the history of the industry has theri
been such a stimulus to construction. It is announced
tiiat vessels with a capacity of 1,250,000 tons will be
launched by American builders during the present year.
And the greater part of them are expected to "y the
American flag.
The activity is by no means confined to the seaboard.
Ocean traffic and the shipyards that minister to it hae
drawn attention from inland navigation. Shipping on the
Great Lakes has reached tremendous volume and im
portance. During the 1916 season there were more than
74,000,000 tons of freight carried through the "'Soo"
caiMiis. a far greater volume than that of the Suez, Pana
ma. Kiel, Manchester and all other great canals put to
gether. And shipbuilding on the Lakes has naturaiiy
developed in proportion, to meet the pressing demand for
new vessels. .
There's been more money in building ships lately than
in making munitions. And it's a much cleaner and more
useful industry. The world can't have too many ships.
citically exonerated liolling, however,
from all Mams for the "leak" on the
note.
To the best of his knowledge, Mr.
Connelly smilingly told the commit
tee repeatedly, his advices to the Hut
ton firm were based principally on
"gossip and rumor" he gathered in
his ollice and deductions he had made
from a speech he heard President Wil
son deliver at the Gridiron Club din
ner in WashinKiVm on December 9.
In vain did Sherman L. Whipple, coun
sel for the committee, and all its mem
bers, six of whom are attorneys, at
tempted to draw irom Mr. Connelly
tiie name of a single person who gav'.
him any of the information he for
warded to New York.
Connelly's examination was unfin
ished when the committee adjourned
tonight He still was radiant and
eager, apparently to help, but the
committee, according to certain mem
bers, were somewhat at a loss as to
what augie his interrogation should
take when it is resumed tomorrow.
Touching on iioiling's partnership,
Connelly declared that the fact liiut
he was a relative i the President haa
not influenced him the slightest in in
viting Lolling to become a member oi
his Arm. Asked if he hud eoii-iuUcd '
with Boiling in preparing his resume,'.

THE TRAINING CAMPS.
Regardless of official preparedness plans, the compara
tively unofficial military training camp work continues
mere energetically than ever. The experiment started
two years ago at Plattsburg, N. Y.. has assumed national
proportions. There is now a very much alive Military
Training Camps Association of the lited States, looking
after the development of this civilian training plan, in co
operation with the war department. It announces thai
there will be at least 00,000 men attending this year's
summer camps.
Thc camps have grown to more than a dozen, providing
easily accessible training pl.i.ch in every beet ion ot th-?
country. And nearly everywhere there is cnthusiaMii lor
this no.I enterprise, which oinbiiics in so a (tractive a
form a month's healthful vacation with an opportunity to
master the rudiments of military ill.
it i.s Tun. but it is also earnest work. And the men al
the head of the association know exactly what they're
about. "V.'c are not trying to build up a new volunteer
force," they say. "We do not believe in ji volunteer sys
tem. We are trying to bring about a universal and demo
cratic system of military service, and we will stick at it
until we succeed. Our national safety requires it. Men
who opposed it a year ago are today .heartily in favor ot
it, and the number in favor of it continually -rows."
It is expected, of course, that (he (raining the men re
ceive will be valuable in case they t-liould be called on for
actual service. Most of them would be well on Iheir way
t.je'Ollilig efficient officers. AH could be whipped in'o
serviceable shape for . a national 'emergency far moro
quickly than raw recruits. But they may be rij;bt in their
view that the most valuable part of their enterprise is the
propaganda that goes with it.

TEACHING THE IMMIGRANT.
In a recent report on '"The School and the Immigrant"
the Cleveland Education Survey has brought to light thc
fact tiiat although there were more than 10,000 students
enrolled in the night schools, most of these representtd
names in books rather tiian students in school. And it's
probably as true of other cities with large foreign popu
lations as it is of Cleveland.
The trouble is that grown men and women, foreigner
far from illiterate but with little knowledge of thc Eng
lish language and anxious to learn American customs,
have not found in the night schools wfiat they sought
and needed. Men "5 to o0 years old, with keen minds and
ambitions, have been set to copying such illmuinatit'g
phrases as "I am a yellow bird. I can sing. I can lly. I
can sing to you." And after a few evenings they have
dropped out .if the .lass.
What IIicm.' men and women a..k .if our night schools
is .11. mediate, concrete, practical training. If is an insuH
to their intelligence and earnest purpose to oiler them
primary work. In general the teachers are free to teac'i
what they please by whatever methods seem best. !l
looks as if the teachers did not understand their tasl;.
Too often they haven't got the immigrant student's
point of view at all. They painfully teach him to rad
primers instead of newt-papers. "Of the life and workings
of (he city in which he lives they tell him nothing. It's
time for us (o um? a little common sense and le.s ag:ie

CHICAGO. Jan. 31. Suggestions of
a posible new move by I'Vesident
Wilson did a pood deal to make wheat,
lu -ices decline. The market closed
heavy. T" to net lower, with May
at S1.71 to $1.71' , r.r.d July at $1.40
to 11.46",. Corn finished to Ts
down, oats off to I'-k and pro
visions at losses ranging from 21jc to
60e.
Right from the outset the wheat
market had a downward slant.
Dispatches were at hand intimating
that the German and Austrian diplo
matic repreesntatives at Washington
would announce a wilingneis of the
Teutonic powers to formulate peace
terms if asked to do so by the entente
allies. Knowledge that the German
chancellor was about to make an
.important speech in the Reichstaf
tended also to center Interest on
the peace outlook.
Lowest prices .on the day in the
wheat market came just before the
ciose and after news had been re
ceived that the Swiss minister at
Washington h2d been seeking an en
gagement with President Wilson to
discuss peace.
Throughout the session the bulls
were handicapped further by indica
tion of the presence of German pea
rovers in the North Atlantic.
Corn weakened with wheat. Dull
ish effects of cold wave predictions
failed to be felt except for a brief
time at the start. Oats gave way to
tin- depressing influence of the weak
ness of other cereals.
Highest prices on hogs since the
civil w?r gave only a temporary lift
to provisions. The weakness of grain
brought about a material decline
later.

play to be exhibited at the Eagle

especially appealing to women and

by a company selected because of the
individual fitness of the player and
for the role assigned. Wm. Canfield.

ZANDER REFUSES TO
RECOGNIZE KUCHLER
ON TAX COMMISSION
(Special to the Review)
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Jan. 31. Governor
Campbell today named George H.
Smalley public examinfr, succedins
Harry Rountree, of Phoenix, wuc had
been named by Governor Hunt Decem
ber 30. Rountree had been named to
succeed Dave j'jhnson, who became
state treasurer the lirst of the y.p.r.
! Smalley is from Ti-o:v and was a
candidate for state tax commissioner
;at the last election.
A scene was created ft the e.nfal
today when Zander, chairman of the
i state tax commission announced he
would refuse to recognize Rudolph
j,Kuchler. who had heretofore been ap
i pointed by Governor Campbell as his
; own successor on the state tax rom
' mission. Kuehler has been attending
i meetings of the commission, but no
decision on any subu-ct hud hen tak
en at any meeting held. Zander arid
! Howe today decided that they would
refuse to recognize Kuehler until in
structed to do so by a written epin.'jn
of the attorney general. This Kueh
ler has applied for. I'e has hereto
fore tiled with Zander ,a eertiiteate
jfrom Secretary of Slate Osborne that
an appointment of himself had been
i filed by Governor Campbell, that his
'bond had been approved, and that he
had taken his oath of 'jmep. The ac
tion of members Howe and Zander of
the tax commission has created aj
mosl as much excitement as did the
refusal of Governor Hunt to surrender
his office to Campbell on the lirst of
tbe year.

TEMPLETON CLEARED.
The charge of grand larceny filed
against Wesley Templeton, of Lowell,
several days ago by his father-in-law,
J. R. Tate, was dismissed in the Low
ell justice court yesterday when Tem
pleton was given'a preliminary hear
ing before Judge J. L. Winters. Tem
pleton was charged with having taken
an 'automobile owned by Tate to El
Paso. As it was shown that Tate had
j turned the machine over to Templeton
i to use in the livery business. Judge
Winters ruled that there was not
enough evidence to show that Tem
pieton intended to steal the machine,
t particularly so as Templeton drove it
hack from El Paso until the car broke
down near lunulas.

The European war has increased the
business of the trappers and hunters
of Northern Arizona four fold, ac
cording to the reports in Prescott.
The demand for pelts and skunk oil
is almost greater than the supply.
More than $3,500 has been received
by two men in the last two seasons
from two classes of game pelts, skunk

principal point to which the result of
their skill is shipped is Ottawa, Canada.

STAY OUT OF JAIL;
DON'T TOTE A GUN
OR A BOTTLE HERE
Developments in city court yester
day morning' proved that there are
two things a man should not carry in
Bisbee a bottle of booze or a six
shooter. Dewey Hogan, nabbed Tues
day by Officer Walter Shepherd while
toting around a bottle 'of bootleg, was
lined $20 and given ten days in jail.
Elvis Siat, arrested for packing a gun,
forfeited a $50 bond by not appearing
when his name was called by Judge
Thomas. The management of the Im
perial pool hall entered a plea of nut
guilty to a charge of maintaining a
public nuisance and was released on
$25 bail to appear this morning. Owen
Prytherch, charged with vagrancy,
pleaded not guilty and will be tried
this morning.

TUCSON SCANDAL..
A small municipal scandal is about
to result in Tucson in connect ion '
with the acceptance by the city of j
sewer pipe laid by the Shea Construc
tion Company ou the north side ini- I
provement. A confidential report is j
said to have been made by a sanitary ;
engineer at th request of promi- i
nent taxpayers. The report Insists
that more than 50 per cent of the i
pipe was not properly glazed so that '
it will not stand the use to which, i
it is to be put. Other of the pipe j
was not of the proper thickness con- i
sidering the diameter of the pipe. :
Altogether 75 per cent of the pipe is
Involved In the condemnation. Legal
complications are likely to be brought
atout becaus-' of the probable re- :
fusal of the property owners to nay
for the work, even though the city has
already accepted the pipe.
