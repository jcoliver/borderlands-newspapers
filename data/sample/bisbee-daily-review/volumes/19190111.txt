Secretary Baker Fails to Bring i

U. S. Shipping Unhurt
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEK YORK, Jan. 10. No hope of
early settlement of the strike which
has paralyzed the port of New York
for two days, waB apparent tonight.
Leaders of the 16,000 workers on tugs,
lighters and ferryboats declared em
phatically that they were prepared for
a finish fight. Their employers, mem
bers of the New York Boat Owners'
association, were equally emphatic in
their assertion that they never would
yield to the demand for an eight hour
day.
The visit to the city late today of
Secretary of War Baker led to the
hope that his Influence might result in
an adjustment, but the hope was short
lived. When the secretary left tonight
for Ottawa, he gave no Intimation
that the war department would take
a hand in the controversy.
Government Not Embarassed
On the contrary, he said the strike
had not. resulted in serious embarrass
ment to the department. Returning
troops were being debarked -without
delay, he stated, and there had been
no interruption to the flow of supplies
to the army overseas. Enough navy
tugs are available for this work.
Mr. Baker said, A. H. Smith, region
al director of railooads teppareitly
has failed in his effort to arrange
an armistice of from 4S to 72 hours
in the belief that If operations were
resumed the differences could be com
posed by conciliation. No reply has
been received by Mr. Smith to a let
ter sent by him to leaders of the
union, but the strike committee an
nounced earlier In the day that they
would not agree to an armistice.
Revoke Exemptions
The most serious development of
the day was the decision of the strike
committee to revoke all exemptions
previously made. This action called
out men employed on fire boats and
those runnine to islands on which are
located municipal charitable reform
Institutions. j
There was no actual shortage of j
either food or coal because of the
strike, but it was realized that the
situation might result in complete j

"The trouble does not lie at the

(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Jan. 10. Denunciation
of bolshevism and Inslduous socialis
tic doctrines marked numerous ad
dresses today at the meeting of the
republican national committee here,
several speakers declaring that the
election of a republican president Is
all that can save the country from evil
days in the future.
With women sitting in the councils
of the party for the first time in' its
history the day was a veritable love
feast at which plans were laid and I
campaign strategy discussed. Chair
man Will H. Hays established a prece
dent by delivering a short prayer be
fore hecalled the meeting to order.
Mounment for Roosevelt
Later in the day Chairman Hays
suggested that the committee consider
what it might do to express its ad-1
miration for the late Colonel Roose- j
velt. Acting upon this suggestion the ;
committee decided to appeal to the I
republicans of the country to erect a
permanent monument to the former
president. It is planned to raise the
necessary funds by popular subscrip
tion. The character of the memorial
is to be decided upon by a special
committee of which V. B. Thompson
of Yonkers. N. Y., Is chairman. Tho
other members oj the committee will !
be named by Chairman Hays later, i
The committee reaffirmed the
party's indorsement of woman suf
frage and urged congress to pass the
constitutional amendment for suffrage
and republican state legislation to '.
ratify the same when it is submitted j
to them for action. ,
Demand Return of Railroads I
Members of the committee applaud-1
ed speeches attacking the democratic
national administration for what was
termed its socialistic tendencies and
demanding that the railroads be re
turned to their owners without un
necessary delay.
Governor Beekman of Rhode Island,
referred to the recent victory of the
republicans in the congressional elec
tions and said that the people of the
north were tired of paying 90 per cent
of the taxes and having it expended
by the minority of the south which
dominated the democratic national ad
ministration.
Governor Burnquist of Minnesota,
denounced bolshevism, anarchy and
socialism and said the hope of the
country for the future was in the elec
tion of a republican president. He
spoke of the activity of the non-partisan
league in the northwest and said
the sympathy of the democratic party
had been with that socialistic organ
ization. Criticize Extravagance
Governor Harding of Iowa criticized
the democratic national administra
tion for its alleged extravagance and
inefficiency and referred to W. G. toc
Adoo, federal director of railroads, as
"the crown prince."
"This is too big and too great a
country to be ruled by one corner of
It," said Governor Harding. "1 hope
the republican congress will see that
the railroads are returned to their
owners without delay."
Congessman Royal Johnson of
South Dakota, who appeared in the
uniform of an army officer, made a
similar address.
Chairman Hays was given a vote of
confidence by the members and auth
orized to name an executive aud other
committees at his discretion.
Mrs. Medill McCormick of Illinois,
chairman of the woman's executive
committee, read a long report outlin
ing plans for woman's organizations in
every state and for the active partici
pation of the women in the national
affairs of the party In the future.

The committee settled a contest
over the national committeeship in
Louisiana which has been pending
since the last republican national con
vention In 1916 by seating Emil

SHIPPERS WILL FIGHT PLAN
TO RETURN RAILROADS WITH
TRANSPOR TA TION SECRET A R Y
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. Attitudes
of shippers' interests, railroad securi
ties owners and state commissions, to
ward railroad legislation became
known in part here today, in advance
of their presentation by representa
tives of the various interests to the
senate interstate commerce commit
tee next week.
The shippers oppose establishment
of a secretary of transpoitatlon and
federal incorporation of railroad com
panies, as advocated by railway ex
ecutives and propose the following:
Propose Liberal Rates.
Rates sufficiently liberal to guar
antee proper maintenance of railways
and ample returns to security hold
ers; internment regulation by the In
tel state commerce commission; main-
iciunce of the functions of the state
commissions; common use of termin
als and other facilities; co-operation
among railways to promote efficiency
cf service, but with pooling and unifi
cation agreements subject strictly to
the interstate commerce commission
and restoration of the roads to private
ownership as soon as remedial leg
islation has been enacted.
Railroad security owners oppose the
five-yew extension of government
control and urge return of the roads
to private) management after enact
ment of legislation paving the way
for partial unification. They are op

for creating a secretary of transporta

Secretary Lane Urges Immedi
ate Appropriation of Hun
dred Million to Put Plan
Into Operation Immediately
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. . 10 Immedi
ate consideration of the interior de
partment's request for $100,000,000 for
reclamation and occupation of 215.
000,000 acres of tillable soil in this
country by returned soldiers was
asked today by Secretary Lane at nn
Informal meeting of members of con
gress, held today in the house cham
ber. Secretary Lane said an appropria
tion of $100,000,000 would be suffici
ent to put the plan in operation, al-
though a much greater amount could
be used.
"However, $100,000,000 will provide
for the employment of 100.000 men,"
he said, "and wi'l result In the de
velopment of 25,000 farms and that
will serve well as a beginning. It is
absurdly small, but it will help. I
wish that an amount equal to the war
cost for a week could be given, about
$300,000,000, but I suppose that is too
much to hope for."
The secretary said there were great
tracts of tillable soil in nearly every
state, "which can be reclaimed by
draining or irrigation and that be
tween Washington and the southern
end of Florida there is enough land
to feed the entire populaUon of the
country if drained and cultivated. Im
mense areas In the west could be
made ready for use by irrigation, he"
added, and at comparatively small ex
pense, thousands of acres of rich land
In New York, Massachusetts and
Maine could be put under cultivation.
Send Men to Farms
"The department proposes that
gangs of men be sent to these tracts
of land and put to work," he said.
"They would be housed In comfortable
barracks, furnished good meals, and
paid current wages. Then after they
have worked for one or two years
and the land Is ready for cultivation.
we would tell them to pick out tneir

ment agents would be near always to

markets. Village settlements would
be opened with schools, moving pic
ture theaters, halls and churches. The
soldier farmer and his family would
he hnpi y and the great danger the
country caused by the movement city
wards would be counteracted."
That soldiers are anxious to become
farmers Is attested, the secretary
said, by the fact that hundreds of let
ters are beine received daily by the
department asking If farms can be ob
tained. No answers to these letters
can be made, he said, because money
for the project hns not been appropri
ated by congress.
FOR RETU
tion and for federal incorporation cf
railroads.
Among the proposals of the state;
commissions are that state govern
ments should retain their control ove
interstate rates, that state regional
direi-tois should be created to assist!
the interstate commerce commission
and that the federal commission and
the state commission co-operate in all
matters pertaining to railroad regula-1
tion.
They oppose the plan for a secre
tary of transportation, and insist that
the so-called "twilight zone" of author
ity between federal and state govern
ments does not truly exist.
The proposed legislative programs
of these interests will be presented
to the senate committee next week.
Clifford Thome, representing ship
pers' interests, gave out a statement
saying, that although the railroad ad
ministration had tried worthily to
eliminate rate injustices caused by
the general advance, "many orders
developed that are arbitrary and un
just" without granting shippers a
hearing. For this reason he urged
that congress immediately restore the
rate suspension powers of the Inter
state commerce commission by elim
inating from the railroad control act
"the clause which states' that the
orders of the president may supersede
the common law and the statutes of
the state and federal governments;
and require the director general to
pay final judgments rendered against
common carriers.

(Hv Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Jan. 10. The injunc
tion suit brought by the Commercial
Cable company and the Commercial
Pacific Cable company to restrain
Postmaster General Burleson from
taking over for the government their
respective cable lines and merging
them with lines controlled by the
Western Union Telegraph company
was dismissed today by Federal Judge
Learned Hand. Counsel for the com
panies announced that an appeal
would be taken.
Judge Hand decided the case on its
merits, passing without decision the
jurisdictional questions raised by the
United States district attorney, who
contended that the suit could not be
maintained on the grounds that it was
directed against the United States and
in elfoct against the president.
Considers Both Claims
Taking up the claims of plaintiffs
that the seizure of the cable lines on
November 16, five days after the sign
ing of the armistice, was not justified
by the joint resolution of July 16, 191S,
authorizing the president to seize
cables when he deemed it "necessary
for the national security and defense"
and that the resolution itself was not
a sufficient warrant for the seizure.
Judge Hand decided both claims ad
versely. Commenting on the contention of
counsel for the cable companies that
the "necessity" for seizure within the
meaning of the joint resolution had
terminated with the signing of the
armistice, Judge Hand said:
"The resolution expressly extends
the powers until peace has been de
clared. Had they (congress) intended
that a suspension of hostilities should
terminate the right, they would not
have said precisely the contrary."
The richt of congress to authorize
such a seizure, by the president was
justiitied by Judge Hand on tue
ground that, as commander in chief of
the armed forces of the nation, the
president was permitted by the con
stitution to hold either money or prop
erty to be used for the national defense.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Jan. 10. Widespread
labor troubles in Argentina, which
apparently had paralyzed business in
that country, rallied the corn market
today from bearish effects of the re
moval of the United States ban on
importation of Argentine coin. Prices
closed unsettled January J1.44V2 and
May $135 to J1.3G, with the final
range as a whole '2 cent off to 1
cents up, compared with 24 hour be
fore. Outs ?c to lUc. In provisions
the outcome varied from 50c decline
to a. rise of 32 to 35c.
During- the first half of the day,
bearish sentiment dominated the corn
market as a result of certainty that
the United States government had
cancelled all restrictions against im
ports from Argentina. In addition,
receipts here were liberal and it was
said the February minimum on hog
values might be lowered. Subse
quently, however, attention focussed
on the seriousness of the industrial
clash in Argentina and the possibil
ity that shipments from tiere might
be indefinitely delayed. Hedging
pressure from Argentina halted com
pletely and other offers became scarce.
A fcharp bulge in prices followed, but
profit-taking- by longs brought about
something: of a reaction from the top.

BOWLING

Ladies first, always. Is a good
mott but it (Is seldom that the'
women of a community take a lead-'
in? place in athletics.'' Yet llutt is i
I what has happened at the Y. M. C. A.,
where the ladies' team stands in the
lead in the bowling tournament, not '
having lost a single game out of seven1
played.
The success of the womn compos
ing it is not to be attributed to gal
lantry on the purt of their masculine
opponents, for the regularity with
which the "fems" have put it over
on the supposedly good bowlers of
the association has aroused rivalry
and a determination on the part of
the men to beat them once, anyway.
Tonight, being the last in the
tournament, the women will bowl
against the team captained by J. C.
Amos. Amos and his men say they
have the number of the fair ones,
but they, in turn, point to their per
fect record and declare that they will
have to be shown.
All of the members of the ladies'
team bowl a good, consistent game as
is evident irom their averages for
the tournament. These follow: Mrs.
Verfuth. 134 5-6; Miss Studley, 1412-9;
Miss Core. 131 1-12; Mrs. Tonkin.

Returning Soldiers
Reports being sent out from Phoe
nix that "Arizona eniployersare fall
ing to measure up to the standard of
loyalty and patriotism expected of
them" in returning former employes
to their positions when they are must
ered out, teach two lessons. Whether
the reports are entirely correct or are
exaggerated, does not matter. They
show that the man with the job is
fortunate, and that some means must
be provided for employment of more
men.
That the report is not accurate, in
sofar as It concerns the Warren dis
trict, is shown by the official state
ment of W. R. Asiiurst, agent of the
federal employment bureau here, who
early this week gave publicity to the
fact that all soldiers formerly em
ployed in this district, are receiving
back their places. In the same report,
he gave figures as to the number of
soldiers returned to employment, and
lie confidently anticipated that ail
others returning to their pre-war jobs
will find them waiting.
It is a proud moment for the War
ren district, this period. Other parts
of the state are finding It difficult
to take care of the returning men.
The Warren district may boast that
this task is being performed well.-
Returning to the lessons to be found
in the report from Phoenix, the warn
ing of Mr. Ashurst on labor condi
tions in the district, again takes on
special significance.
Hold onto your jobs, the federal
agent advised. No matter what the
pay or what the conditions, he de
clared, work now is better- than . no
work and all work is becoming ex
tremely scarce.
This ia the first lesson to be learned
from the report from Phoenix. Work
is scarce, and for this reason some
districts of Arizona are finding it dif
ficult to return their soldiars to their
former positions. Ten thousand more
soldiers recently mustered out, are
now beginning to return to the state.
Work will become more scarce when
they have reached home and absorbed
their former places, and positions will
become more valuable.
The second lesson in the Phoenix
reports grow out of the first. The
opportunities for work in many dis
tricts of Arizona are few, the demand
for work is growing, and, more work
must be found, more jobs made if re
turning men are to be absorbed into
the state's industrial life. Employ
ers of the state must give this phase
of the reconstruction period atten
tion, and every citizen of the state
must assist in developing opportuni
ties which will permit the soldier to
return to bis former position in the
state's industries. Solutions of this
problem are now being worked out,
under the suggestion of President Wil
son and other national leaders that
an enlarged program of public con
struction and improvement will pro
vide work for many returning men.
Bisbee first tunied its attention to
this problem when the city engineer
was Instructed to prepare plans for ex
tensive street improvement and pav
ing. These plans will be worked out
in the next few weeks and within a
few months will provide a large num
ber of men with work. In the state
a similar program is fant being worked
out, and it is probably that a meeting
in Phoenix the latter part of this
month will mm- launched a movement
for improved hiRbways in all parts of
Arizona.
From these facts it is apparcut that
error has been committed, in send
lng out the Phoenix reports. Arizona
employers are living up to "the stand
ard of loyalty and patriotism expect
ed of them," but to live up to the
standard, tln-y are sacrificing their
on interests to devote their time
to -develoiniu'iit of projects which will
make employment for the returniiii;
KOldi-TS.
'.'lit two l'ffons of the Phoenix .re
ports have tdkt.il root in fertile
ground. Labor is holding onto Its
jobs. More places are being prepared
for mere returning toldiers.
Further, little can be said, except
that there is no need for alarm on
the part of friends and relatives of
returning soldiers. Conditions are not
half so serious as some would have
Uie public: believe.
Our War Record
Now that peace has come again,
Arizonans are entitled to review the
state's war record and to estimate the
part we have played In the great
struggle for democracy and justice.
The closest examination into the rec
ords will fail to disclose anything of
which we have to be ashamed. On
the contrary we will find much to be
proud of; much that will prove the
Baby state patriotic to the core.
We gave generously of our young
men to both army and navy and we
sent many of the best of our older
men In Red Cross and other forms of
relief work. In proportion to our
population we contributed more men
to the armies of democracy than al
most any other state In the Union,
this owing to the fact that our pro
portion for the draft was based upon
our census figures and that such fig
ures were entirely unjust, owing to
the large proportions attained by our
alien population exempted from serv
ice. It is not beside the fact to say
that no 6tate in the Union approached
our record in this important direction.
Notwithstanding this great drain on
our man power, we not only maintain
ed the output of copper and other
metals so essential to the successful
prosecution of the war, but increased
that output in the fate of difficulties
of every kind, including largely ad
vanced costs, heavy taxation and all
the other burdens necessarily imposed
by war.
In this great achievement both la
bor and capital subordinated their
private interests to the public good
and both are entitled to share the
crediL
We made good on every appeal that
was made to our patriotism. We sub
scribed our allotments of the Liberty
loans; we gave loyal support to the
Red Cross, the United War Work
campaign and every other department
of the war work that we were asked
to aid and, in Yavapai county at least,
we have not been slackers in the
purchase of baby bonds and thrift
stamps although this is the only
county in the state that can lay claim
to this last distinction.
Our women have done their full
share, and more, in the branches of
Red Cross work other than the mere
raising of money and, so far as the
Verde district is concerned, there has
never been a failure on the part of
our patriotic women in doing their
complete duty.
In a word, Arizona has justified her
claim to a perfect measure of patriot-
Ism during the strenuous year just
closed. She will not disgrace this
record in the years of peace that lie
before us. Verde Copper News.
Useful Memorials
It is really cheering to find that
the demand for suitable memorials
of the great war is taking form in
proposals for something better, be
cause more useful, than merely orna
mental statues. Some of these pro
posals contemplate the construction of
great public halls, of beantiful bridges,
and of museums. There is no reason,
of course, why art should not enter
hand in hand with utility into the
design of war memorials; In fact there
is every reason why it should.

SUPREME COURT TO CATTLEMEN TO 'ASK COCHISE ASSESSOR PATHFINDERS WILLVVAR .ORDER HAKES
CALL CALENDAR OFSLOWER VALUATIONSiHEADS STATE BODYsTOUR THIS STATE! HARRIS JOB SAFE
IMPORTANT
tlteview Phen!x Bureau)
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Jan. 10. The cal
endar for the present term will be
called in the state supreme court
Monday. The calendar is unusually
heavy owing to the fact that the Oc
tober term was devoted to the dis
posal of cases then pending, and
which it was desired to remove from
the docket before the advent of Judge
A. C. Baker.
As arranged now, there are 81 cases
awaiting the attention of the judicial
body. Of this number there are but
eight criminal cases, the remaining 73
being purely civil actions.
Important Suits Pending.
Several important suits will prob
ably be decided this term. Among
the number is the case of Greenlee
county vs. Frank B. Laine.
The decision that will be ren
dered will have a direct bearing
upon the back salaries due state offi
cials! under the new classification
law. The action was instituted by the
appellee, superior judge of Greenlee
county, against the board of super
visors to determine the constitution
ality of the measure.
Another case that is attracting wiJe
attention is the appeal that has been
lodged in the supreme court by the
Arizona Publishing company, publish
ers of the Arizona Republican. A
judgment for damages was returned
against the publication in favor of
Adjutant General Charles Harris, who
sued the paper for libel. The action
was based upon an article alleging
tbut Harris' resignation had been
asked by Governor Campbell, during
the latter's previous term of office,
because of seditious remarks the offi
cer was accused of making. A ver
dict of J6000 was rendered.
Taxation - Case Holds Interest.
Mining interests are vitally con
cerned in the tax suit instituted by
the state against the Inspiration Con
solidated Copper company of Miami.
The suit is the outgrowth of a con
troversy relative to the method of
taxation imposed upon this class of
property. Producing mines are as
sessed by tie corporation commis
sion upon their "intangible value," in
addition to the valuation placed upon
their equipment and property. It is
the contention of the company that
this procedure is unconstitutional.
and that this form of taxation is un
justly discriminatory.
The twin or this case is found in
the suit against the International
Smelting company. In this instance,
the physical valuation of the plant
was disregarded entirely. In both
cases a decision in favor of - the min
ing cases was rendered in he lower
courts.
Government Ends
Wobbly Evidence
(l!v Rvk-w leases "Wire)
SACRAMENTO. Cal., Jan. 10. The
government concluded the presenta
tion of its case against 46 alleged
Industrial Workers of the World in
the United States district court here
today after John Diamond, a witness,
testified many of the defendants had
told him they had started incendiary
firei in the San Joaquin valley during
tho past two years.
Diamond said he was a member of
the I. W. W. and had been present
at a gathering when opposition to
the war was discussed and it had
baen proposed as a method of hinder
ing the war program to throw sand
in the boxes of railway cars, but
some members thought this was too
simple and proposed other methods.
Adjournment was taken until Monday
at request of the defense.

Another source of delay, he added,
was the transferring of units of troops

Mr. Praeger appeared before the
committee to urge appropriations of

He predicted a great future for this

Review I'hornix Bureau!
. PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 10. Cattle
men, through the medium of the
Arizona Cattle Growers' association,
are organizing for the purpose of se
curing a lower valuation on livestock.
An effort in this direction met with
failure at the recent sessions of the
States Assessors' association here,
and the basis of a new attempt to be
launched at the next state tax con
ference is now being laid.
After a lengthy discussion, the min
imum valuation of $30 per head for
cattle was decided upon at the con
vention of assessors. This, the stock
raisers contend, is an unjust rate
and out of proportion to the tax im
posed in other industries, inasmuch
as the assessment rate is based upon
the high market price rather than the
average. The valuation also leaves
no margin for fluctuation, they claim,
and works a hardship upon the owner
who is compelled to dispose of his
holdings without waiting for a favor
able market.
False Impression.
Cue to the publication of articles
dealing with the high prices that
were being received for beef, the
public generally has gained a false
impression of the true situation, it is
said. While it is true that in many
instances yearlings have brought
from $4i to $50 per head, this is the
exception rather than the rule. There
have been no accounts of the cattle
men who have been compelled to sell
their stock at prices ranRing from $16
to $20 per head, nor is the increased
cost of feeding and labor taken into
consideration.
The greatest objection the stockmen
have to the valuation is that it does
not contemplate relief to those affect
ed by the wide range of conditions.
It is pointed out that an assessment
of $!0 would not be too high for the
cattlemen of Mohave county, where
the range is 12 per cent better than
normal. It would, however, be a seri
ous burden on stock growers in Nav
ajo, where the range is 68 per cent
below normal.
Many Ship CV.ttle.
v. the southern portions of the state
the cattlemen have been put to the
addtional expense of sending their
stock to other more favored ranges
to provide adequate feed. In the
north the deep snow has caused and
is causing serious losses in the herds.
Even with a high market these stock
men will make but a small margin of
profit. Present indications are that
the market will be low.
Unless a lower valuation can be se
cured, many of the smaller concerns
will pass out of existence, it is
claimed. To avert the danger which
threatens the industry, the cattlemen
are going to make a determined fight
to secure an assessment of $20 per
head or a reduction of $10 from the
present rate.
Although he tax conference will
not take place until next summer, the
local branch of the association is now
compiling a comprehensive review of
the situation which will embrace all
of the various phases of the industry.
The figures will be complete in every'
detail and will constitute a statistical
history of stock raising In this state.
The conference will be held in either
Bisbee or Douglas.

(lli'vic.v Phncnix llurrati)
PHOENIX, Ariz., Jan. 10. E. , A.
Hughes, assessor of Cochise county,
was elected president of the State
Assessors' association at the close of
the joint session of the association
and the State Tax commission today.
The organization convened for the
purpose of electing officers for the en
suing year and adjourned immediately
after this task was accomplished.
Other officials elected at this time
were: A. B. Ming of Yuma, vice-president;
C. E. Gentry of Yavapai, secretary-treasurer;
J. A. Duncan of Gila,
assistant secretary-treasurer. The
Gila man was signally honored in the
election as this is the first time in the
history of the organisation that a dep
uty assessor has been chosen for
office.
Committee Unchanged
The personnel of the legislative
committee was not changed. The as
sessors are. anxious that the measures
which they will recommend to the leg
islature be prepared without delay
and it was deemed advisable to let
the proposed legislation remain in the
capable hands in which they placed
it last year. On this committee are:
C. E. Gentry, J. T. Bone. E. A. Hughes,
Pat Ross and Charles Woolfolk.
As a fitting conclusion, the asses
sors presented the retiring president.
George Truman of Pinal, with an elab
orate Elks', charm handsomely en
graved. The presentation spepch was
delivered by N. O. Ruggles of Mohave,
one of thf new members.
The conference of the association
with the tax commission came to an
end after a very brief meeting this
morning. The same minimum valua
tions as prevailed last year on all
classes of property were recommend
ed to remain the same. It was the
opinion of both bodies that conditions
at this time were too unsettled to
formulate intelligent reforms, and that
if changes become necessary they can
be better attended to at the state tax
conference which is to convene ni
August.

ties cf the leisure classes of Great
Britain, during the world war; their
splendid and unselfish labor in caring
for convalescent soldiers and their in
numerable sacrifices. It shows not
merely actors made up to represent
these people, btrt t'.'.e people them
selves, the ver flower of England's
finest womanhood engaged in the
noble task of succoring the brave sons
of Britain. France and the allies of
all the loyal nations, in their time
of great suffering and sacrifice.
The chief roles are in the hands
of capabale screen players, many of
whom appear for the first time uuder
the Artcraft trademark. These in
clude Henry Walthall. Ullian Gish.
Robert Hrron and others, all of
whose portrayals are essentially
artistic and lend much to the verisi
militude of the scenes.

HEARTS OF WORLD
ON OPENING NIGHT
"Hearts of the World." the master
creation of that marvelous wizard of
the screen. I). W. Griffith, played
to a packed house at the Eagle theater
and turned hundreds away last niuht.
is cne of the most realistic pictures
ever screened, containing some of the
most wonderful battle scenes yet pre
sented to the' public and is really a
fine tiling, fully worthy ot the tre
mendous patronage that has bee-n ac
corded it wherever it has been shown.
A decid'-dly commendable: feature of
the affair e.-pecially to strong, cool
and sentimental folks- is the fuct that
the bouse was darkened and one may
blubber his eyes out unobserved. That
'here are tear is foolish to deny.
That was brought about a number of
times during the evening when the
lusty poiiu defies and vanquishes a
squad of boches or when the wee
brother sacrifices his toy pistol to the;
cause; of France, but tears there were
The large svmphony orchestra that
accompanies the picture set the col
oring and atmosphere to the play and
a person forgets that he is merely
witnessing a photoplay instead of liv
ing in war-ridden France;.

is shortly to be visited by the puth
finding committee appointed to in
vestigate the feasibility of a federal
highway through this state from EI
Paso to Los Angeles, constructed un
der the provisions of the Bankhead
federal aid act. R. A. Kirk, of this
city, is in receipt of a telegram stating
that the committee will arrive here in
the course of a few days.
The highway through this stat will
follow the old Borderland route if the
recommendation of the pathfinders is
favorable. Among trie important points
on the route are Tucson. Pha-nix, Bis
bee and Douglas. Arrangements havo
been made here to entertain this com
mittee and supply the members with
data relative to the desirability of
this plan and an effort is being made
to have the other cities and counties
affected co-operate in this endeavor.
No Definite Date Set
No detinite date has been set for
the arrival of the federal inspectors.
T. S. Plowman, president of the Bank
head Highway association, has an
nounced the call for a meeting of the
board of directors for the purpose of
selecting its representatives on this
tour. It is expected that the delegates
chosen will commence the trip without
delay.
Prompt action is necessary since
the survey must be made and reported
before the third annual convention of
the association occurs. This will take
place at Mineral Wells. Texas. April
1S-19. at which time the location of
the highway through the southwest
will be definitely fixed. Whether Ari
zona will participate in the benefits
of this federal construction and to
what extent will depend upon the ag
gressiveness with which the various
civic organizations press their claims
during the course ot the tour of in
spection proposed.

Review Phornii Bure-a.ii
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Jan. 10. Recogni
tion of all states adjutants general as
otficers of the national guard, with
permanent commissions, has been pre
scribed by the secretary of war in an
order issued December 23, copiea of
which have recently been received at
the capitol. The new order prescribe
that the adjutants general of the vari
ous states shall wear the uniform of
an officer of the national guard, not
in federal service.
Under the new ruling of the secre
tary of war it is likely that legislation
similar to the Arizona military code
will have to he enacted by many of
the slates. In the case of Arizona no
change in existing laws will be neces
code of Arizona already provides that
sary, it is believed. The military
code of Arizona already provides that
the adjutant general shall hold a com
mission as an officer of the national
guard.
While no expression has been forth
coming from Adjutant General Harris
in view of the newly promulgated or
der of the secretary of war, it is not
believed that he regards same with
any degree of dissatisfaction, and
while it in no way alters his status
under the Arizona military code, his
friends are frank to say that they be
lieve he will urge the recent action
of Secretary Baker as further evi
dence tending to support his conten
tion that he can be removed from of
fice only by death or by court martial
by the general staff.

BOND TRADING IS
ACTIVE ALL OVER
STATE AT PRESENT
Trading in Liberty bonds on the
streets ot Bisbee and many of the oth
er cities of Arizona, has become so
common as to create little comment,
while a surprisingly large number of
the bonds are being sold through local
brokerage otfices every day.
A group of individuals, claimed by
some people to be allied with one an
other but said by others to be operat
ing individually, has appeared on the
scene and its members are making
their living by "bargain hunting" for
the bonds.
As a usual thing the street brokers
get hold of some individual who either
is hard up or lacking in patriotism
and anxious to sell "in order to get
his money out." The price paid al
ways is several dollars under the cur
rent market quotation, the speculators
placing the ready cash in front of
the faces ot the the men they mulct.
Usually from five to six dollars, ex
clusive of accrued interest on coupons,
is the profit made on each bond
bought.
The buyers then are said to dis
pose of their purchases the same day
through brokers' offices, where they
are paid not only the market value of
the bond, but the accrued interest as
well. Thus their working capital is
kept busy and a substantial daily
profit made.
The public has been advised fre
quently to hold on to the Liberty
bonds which ultimately will be worm
considerably more than their present
selling price, if the money involved
be taken as the only consideration. In
addition the sale of a bond is transfer
ring the evidence of patriotic self
denial, in most cases, to another.
Bankers of the Pacific coast are
said to be purchasing large quantities
of the bonds at market prices, either
for the banks they represent or for
their customers.

Suffering Described As Torture
Relieved by Elack-Dranglt. "
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, ot
this place, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting,-he in
jured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and feU off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their tMdicine, hit
bowels failed to act '."He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession, lie
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black
Draught I made him take t big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got wen,
and we both feel he owes his life tc
Thedford's Black-Draught.".

to keep fit. ready for the day's work.

CALLED HOME.
Mrs. Mary Alexander of Reading,
Pa., who was Visiting her daughter,
Mrs. J. M. Rothenberger of Warren,
was called home on account of the se
rious illness of her sister, Mrs. C.
Marr.
Following a conference between Dr.
Harry A. Reese, county health officer,
and Dr. D. Brown, city health officer
of Bisbee, decision wag announced
late yesterday afternoon to enforce a
modified quarantine on all parts of
Cochise county, including a ban placed
upon public dances. This will end
the inequality which existed since the
Bisbee city council announced the ban
on dancing within the corporate lim
its.. This resulted in people who pre
viously intended attending the dances
in Bi6bee going to Lowell and Warrea
instead.
It was explained by Dr. Brown,
through whom the announcement was
made, that the '"modified' quarantine
contemplated, . would consist in the
practical immolation of influenza pa
tients and those in direct contact with
them, from the community in general.
Placards announcing the presence of
influensa will be ported upon the
houses of patients. No members of
the family will be allowed to leave the
bouse, except the bread winner, who
will be pledged to come in- contact
with the patients as little as possible.
Until the card has been removed, no
visitors may enter the home. This, at
least is expected to have a very bene
ficial effect, as promiscuous visiting
has been a fruitful source of spreading
the disease, the doctors say.
Dr. Brown said in. discussing the
new rulingB:
"It is the purpose of the county and
city health officers to avoid if pos
sible a recurrence of the bad condi
tions which existed here during the
fall, and to prevent the placing of an
absolute quarantine on the district
and county once more. A bad condi
tion threatens us, although there are
i dui a threat uuiuuvr ui Castro ui prva-
ll ent.
"If conditions are no worse than at
present, there will be no quarantine
in all probability, on any other form of
public amusement except dances,
which we consider a large factor in
spreading the disease."
