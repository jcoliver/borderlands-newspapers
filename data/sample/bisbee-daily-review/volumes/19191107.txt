THAT TREATY WILL NOT 60 INTO
FORCE UNTIL ALL OBLIGATIONS
ARE EX EG U TEDSAT I S FACTO H I LY
Replacing of Vessels at Scapa Flow; Five Light Cruisers
to Take Place of First Class Battleships Sunk at
Same Place; Turning Over of 42 Locomotives
and 4,460 Cars and Restoration of Art
Among Demands Made in Protocol
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6. Notice
was served on Germany by the allied
and associated powers in a note and
accompanying protocol, forwarded
last Saturday, that the treaty of
peace would not go into force- until
Germany executes To the satisfaction
of the allied and associated powers
obligations assumed under the armis
tice convention and additional agree
ments. The note, made public tonight by
the state department, provides that
the German government shall send
representatives to Paris November

the putting into effect of the treaty.
But the note specifies that before
the treaty can be made effective

the nation to carry out the terms of
the protocol.
The protocol contains a number of

the armistice convention and comple
mentary agreements which have not
been carried out and which have been
the subject of urgent representations.
These include the withdrawal of
German troops from Russian terri
tory and the delivery of certain Ger
man tonnage.
Most important, however, in the
obligations Germany is asked to as
sume under the protocol is the. re
placing of vessels destroyed at Scapa
Flow with fiver light cruisers, and to
make up for the first-class battleship
sunk at Scapa Flow by turning over
floating dry docks and cranes, tugs
and dredges equal to a total dis
placement of 400,000 tons. In this
respect the protocol declares:

time. , .
"Go after the common people the
masses" Pandolfo 'advised him.
"They are the boys. - We want peo
ple for our stockholders who buy
their stock in lots of five to 25 shares
each. We want to distribute the
stock widely, and not to sell it in
one lump."
"That line of talk is a winner in
canine"' he added. "When people
realize from the start that they can
not have any more than 25 to 50
Bhares of a stock they immediately
want some of it."
' "Get some man to introduce you
and go about with you in any com
munity you enter and give him five
to seven per cent commission on the
- stock you sell. Then capitalize his
friends and acquaintances."
"The people here are lousy with
money but it is hard to get," Weigle
wrote in return. "When you mention
stock to a prospect in this country
he puts one hand on his pocket, the
other hand on his watchand looks at
you with a frozen face."

On Office Clearing
PHOENIX, Ariz., Nov. 6. Governor
Campbell today asked Wiley E. Jones,,
attorney general, for an opinion as
whether the law allows state offices

Jones stated tonight he would not
give an opinion before tomorrow.
He said so far as his own office
was concerned he had arranged so

Lever food control act, according to a
statement issued here today by
George H. Smalley, federal fair price
commissioner for Arizona.
Mr. Smalley said he had notified
restaurants alleged to have raised
prices that they must restore them to
their former level at once. Accord

Bisbee's Paving 45
Per Cent Completed
Bisbee's big paving project is 45
per cent completed, according to an
announcement made yesterday by
City Engineer Halleck, without tak
ing into consideration the work
which has been done in perfecting
the necessary organization, which is
now so constituted as making the
actual labor of putting the concrete
on the streets a mere matter of de
tail.
Thirteen thousand square feet of
paving have been laid in Tombstone
canyon, out of a total of about
19,000 square feet. On the Naco
road Halleck has put down 3,208
square feet of paving and 1,100 lin-
eal feet of curbing. In Subway
street, the paving of which has been
completed, 1,000 square yards of con

Concrete will be poured on Main
street, according to Halleck, as soon
as the water company has. renewed
Its service. It has already started
this work.

conversing in high pitched voices
shortly before the shooting. One
neighbor, a woman, the officers said,
informed them she had seen Wilson
leave the house a few seconds after
she heard the report of a revolver.
Officers said the position of the body
and course of the bullet precluded
the possibility of suicide.
CDAL STRIKE
With . the strike of the coal
miners a reality and the walkout
of railway employes a near prob
ability, the fuel situation in Bis
bee is not at all reassuring, ac
cording to declarations made yes
terday by fuel dealers.
With regard to coal, the situa
tion is already becoming acute.
There are not more than 600 tons
of coal on hand in the district
now for ordinary purposes an
amount which is barely, suffi
cient to last until Christmas. No
more shipments are available,
even of coal already ordered, as
the railroads have notified the
dealers that all supplies of coal
in transit hove been taken over
by the railroads for their own
use. Dealei-9 have already placed
the maximum amount which may
be bought at one time by the

LEGALITY OF
PROHIBITION
ASSAILED BY
ELIHU ROOT
Attorney for Brewers Asserts
Congress Exceeded Its Au
thority When It Passed Act;
Says War Technically Over
j
Bill Passed t Under
"False Pretenses"
Country Still Legally at War
Until President's Proclama
tion Announces Demobili
zation, States U.S. Attorney
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6. Elihu
Root argued against the constitution
ality of the prohibition enforcement
act in the United States district court
here today, saying 'that Its passage
was under false pretenses and beyond
the power of congress.
He was associated with William D.
Guthrie, in the suit of Jacob Ruppert,
who seeks an injunction against the
local United States attorney in order
that sale of 2.75 per cent beer may be
resumed. Two other suits involving
the constitutionality of the act were
also argued and Judge Hand took all
under advisement.
"Oo October 27, the sale of this
beer was legal, said Mr. Root. "On
October 29 its sale was not lawful.
On October 28 (the data of enforce
ment of the Volstead act by over-riding
of the president's veto) congress
had no constitutional authority to
prohibit the manufacture and sale of
the kind of beer made by the Ruppert
company."
Mr. Root argued that in passing the
bill congress was exceeding its con
stitutional powers, to raise and sup
port armies
"The president has told congress
that the armies had been demobil
ized," he said.
"He had said over and over again
that the actual war had ended and
that it was no longer necessary to
raise and support an army. tfe said
that when the armistice was signed
now the armistice has been executed.
The enemy has laid down its arms.
It has surrendered its navy and sunk
it, disbanded its army, given up its
munitions. There are no countries in
the world which are so certain not to
wage war during our lives as Ger
many, and the terms of peace have
been communicated to them and ac
cepted. These terms are not being
discussed now by us. We are only
discussing certain covenants among
the parties on one side.
"This bill was not signed in rela
tion to carrying on the war. There
isn't a man, woman or child in the
United States who doesn't know it.
The bill was passed under false pre
tenses. "The prohibition amendment, pass
ed during the war, provided one year
for the liquor business to adjust it
self. Now after the real war has
passed, when no enemy threatens,
congress passes a law taking away
from the people the year of grace
that in time of greatest exigency the
will of the people decreed; this im
poses a greater duty upon the courts
to scrutinize the substance of this
legislation and determine whether it
was honest and sincere."
IY SERIOUSLY
If the threatened railroad
strike becomes a reality, the situ-
ation with regard to wood will be
as unfavorable. Without rail
road transportation it will be im
possible, dealers say, to get suf
ficient supplies of firewood into
the district, although there is
enough on hand now to last until
the first of the year.
It is rumored here that the
coal mines at Gallup are running
at only 50 per cent of their ca
pacity, and that they are over
burdened with orders which they
cannot fill.
Lack of coal will not affect the
Bisbee Improvement comptny,
according to C. S. Thompson,
manager, as the gas and electric
ity for the district are produced
from oil. The railroad strike,
however, will have an almost im
mediate effect. The company is

LAREDO, Texas, Nov. 6. A gen

newspapers received at the border
today. The confederation, it is said,

is to be telegraphed in a code mes
sage. Paulino Fontes, director gen
eral of railways, is quoted as having1,

0. S.k"W ASK MEXICO TO
REC0IM5E JENKINS' LAWYER
FOR TOE SUM PAID KIDNAPERS
OF lERICflltCONSULAR AGENT
Unless It Is Proved That Abduction Was the Result of
Negligence on Part of Mexican Government Reimburse
ment Must Come From Private Sources; News
papers in Mexico City Indignant Over
Refusal to Pay the Ransom
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6. The pol
icy of the United . States regarding
kidnaping of Americans in Mexico
and attacks upon Americans and
their property in that country was
set forth in an official statement that
unless negligence on the part of the
Mexican authorities can be shown,
there will be no claim for damages
made by this government. The kid
naping of Wm. O. Jenkins, American
consular agent at Puebla, and the
payment by his attorney of $150,000
ransom for his liberty, was discussed
at length by a high official of the
state department in outlining the pol
icy of the United States.
.. Jenkins will have to effect his own
reimbursement of the money paid to
the Mexicans who kidnaped him, it
was said, unless he can prove that
the Mexican government was negli
gent in affording him protection. The
fact that he was an official of the
United States government has no
bearing on the matter in any way,
it was stated. Americans in Mexico
can expect no more, or different pro
tection than is afforded to Mexicans
under the Mexican law, this official
said, in definitely disposing of the
suggestion that the protection sought
by Americans in Mexico through dip
lomatic channels to counterbalance
the greater measure of protection
granted to Mexicans by their courts,
will not be urged by this govern
ment. It was admitted by the state de
partment official that the robbery of
American mine and oil company pay
masters "might be" different, as the
paymasters are compelled to notify
the authorities in advance of their
route, time of departure, and the
amount of money carried. Assertion
that on occasions Mexican soldiers in
federal uniforms are reported as par
ticipating in the robberies and that
officers of the federal army at times
have led their men in alleged raids
on the camps, brought the reply that
in such event there "might be"
grounds for a claim against the Mex
ican government under international
law.
Morrow Wins With
30,000 Majority
LOUISVILLE, Ky., Nov. 6. With
complete unofficial returns giving
Edwin P. Morrow, Republican, a ma
jority of slightly less than 30,000
votes over Governor James D. Black,
Democrat, in Tuesday's gubernatorial
election, interest today turned to the
contest as ergards the statewide pro
hibition amendment.
Of the 120 counties in the state, 84
showed complete unofficial returns
tonight, giving the "wets" a majority
of 564 votes. At the office of the
Kentucky Anti-Saloon league it was
said that "as the remaining 36 coun
ties, unheard from are ;dry" there
was no doubt that the amendment
would be carried by a 5000 majority."
Out pf 84 counties heard from, 23
gave a "wet" majority of 32,847. The
remaining 61 gave "dry" majorities
of 32.2S3. v

TO MEET SHIPS
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6. A con
gressional committee would meet the
6teamship Lake Daraga, which Is due
to arrive in New York Sunday with
bodies of American soldiers wno lost
their lives in Russiia, under a reso
lution adopted unanimously by the
house.
Advices from Mexico City today
indicated the newspapers of that
capital are much exercised over the
situation and the refusal of the gov
ernment to reimburse Jenkins the
money paid to the Mexican kidnap
ers. The attorney general of the
state of Puebla, in which the kidnap
ing occurred, has urged the Univer
sal not to express an opinion until
the matter has been thoroughly in
vestigated by court officials, declar
ing that up to the present no legal
evidence has been presented as to
the kidnaping or the payment of the
ransom.
The Excelsior, another fominent
newspaper, however, states unequiv
ocally that everything indicates that
Jenkins was actually kidnaped.
This newspaper conducted an in
dependent investigation of the case,
and has presented the first detailed
account of the incident.
The Excelsior in its account says
that five "rebels" seized Jtenkins at
his factory in Puebla on October 19.
The consular agent was compelled to
open the safe, which was rifled of its
contents, was taken outside the ac
tory, where horses were waiting, and
was carried off and kept a .week un
til he had arranged to pay the ran
some. Jenkins holds -the receipt of
the bandit leader, -Federico Cordoba,
for 300,000 pesos ransom.
The newspaper further states that
he suffered the natural discomforts
attendant upon living with the ban
dits and that his health broke Sown.
He was compelled to sleep on the
ground, forced to undergo long hard
rides in heavy rains. He feared that
his life was in danger at all times,
although there were no open threats,
sines he was in the power of men
wholly undisciplined, wlvp engaged
in drinking bouts and fights at all
times. The "rebels.", fearing at
tempts at rescue, kept constantly on
the move. Jenkins finally was al
lowed to write to his wife and the
letters were taken to Puebla by se
cret emissaries of the "rebels."
SENAT
NEARLY
ENDS SQUABBLE
Whether to Ratify Treaty or
Not Almost Comes to Vote
Is Blocked by Opposi
tion to Pact
WASHINGTON, Nov. 6. Whether
to ratify the treaty with Germany
without reservations or amendments
seemed for a while this afternoon
about to be decided. by the senate.
Thrown into the thick of a dra
matic parliamentary battle, a request
for an immediate showdown on un
qualified acceptance of the treaty got
the backing' of the . leaders on both
sides, who seemed' anxious to outdo
each other in pressing for. a roll call.
But before the stage, of 'action was
reached the move was blocked by
Republican senators who objected
that it might cut off any later at
tempt to put reservations into the
ratification.
The senate got back to its regular
order of business, and, having voted
down the last of the long list of pro
posed amendments, began work on
the reservations presented by the for
eign relations committee, said to
have the backing of a majority of
the senators. When a recess was
taken until tomorrow, the first of the
15 committee proposals had not yet
come to a vote.
The reservations got before the
senate only after a point of order
against them had been overruled by
Vice President Marshall, who de
clared no technicalities of the senate
would be permitted to stand in the
way of the right of senate majority
to frame its ratification of the treaty
as it chose. The ruling, which fol
lowed an hour of bitter argument,
was accepted as containing a signifi
cant declaration of policy with re
spect to the parliamentary tangle de

THE OLDEN DAYS
The olden days in Bisbee
Were the golden days in Bisbee,
When hearts beat true and high
When all the sins were big sins,
When all the wins were big wins,
And men dared -to do or- die!
There's a history to IMsbee;
There's a mystery to Bisbee;
That the world may some day know
There's a golden, glowing story
Of her former human glory,
And the days of long ago.
And the pioneers of Bisbee
Now are worth the tears of Bisbee,
For the paths they traced so well.
For the height of their endeavor,
For the courage that marked them ever.
And ihe tales they left to tell!

A BOOST FOR TOMBSTONE
VALUABLE EDUCATIONAL WORK
THE fourth annual report of tho Agricultural Extension Service
of the University of Arizona, just issued by Director E. P.
Taylor, contains some illuminating statistics as to the growth
f,of agriculture in the state of Arizona under the stimulus ot
this comprehensive branch of university" service. A large meed or
credit for the rapid growth of agriculture in this so-called "arid"
state during the past four years is due to the tireless and exhaustive
work of the university in this field, since it was brought into being
hi 1914 by the Smith-Lever act This year, says the report, lias been
the year of greatest achievement since extension work in agriculture
and home economics was begun in Arizona. The Agricultural Ex
tension Service demonstrated its value in successfully taking the
leadership in our wartime national food crisis, and now, due to its
permanency of organization, it speedily adapts , itself to the needs
of the reconstruction period following the war. In co-operation with
the United States Department of Agriculture, the University of Ari
zona carries on this agricultural work in every county in the state.
It has trained hundreds of "young Arizona men to be scientific far
mers, and hundreds of young Arizona women to be scientific house
wives. It is bringing Arizona, once considered a desert, into prom
inence as a leading agricultural state of the southwest. Let the
.good work go on.
THE WAR' LEGACY
THH aftermath of the war has surely been true to form as ex
pressed in the passions of mankind through strikes and labor
disturbances, for one after another of the labor elements have
' hrefiteued the country with chaos by endeavoring ro tie up
industry with a strike. If the country as a whole were in sympathy
with the radicals of the labor element anarchy would have been in
full sway and the foundations of the government shaken. But the
great bulk of the people, and among these are the majority of labor,
have stood solidly for good government, says the Boston Financial
News.
How long ti'e poht-war exciU-mont will last only time can tell,
but it would seem sale to say that the strike fever is on the wane
after a cl'.max vhich threatened dire results.
Now comes the coal miners, who have decided to walk out at
the command of their leaders; yet, as they are willing to do this
without an individual vote, their obe'-iience to obey is similar to that
of a vote. It will probably be found that the public is more ready to
contest the dispute' than in any of the oUier strikes. The govern
ment is ready witli troops to protect those miners who are willing to
work something which was not in evidence when the Steel workers
quit. And the fact that the government has taken hold of the coal
situation may be taken to mean that the coal strike, if it actually
develops, is doomed to failure. .
The "coal industry is one of the most basic of the country, for
without coal the great bulk of industry ceases to function. It means
a tieing up of the railroads as tight as if the railroad men went out.
For this reason coal mining may bo regarded as a public utility of
the most vital sort and a utility which extends over (he country as
much as therai1roads. It is a" government function to see to U that
the mine are not closed and with the war still not officially over
the government has it. in its power to use most any means to keen
the mines in operation.
"AS THE TWIG IS BENT"
A BOOST for Tombstone, and one which will be read with interest
by every pioneer in Arizona as well as many of Arizona's com
parative newcomers, appsars in this week's issue of the Satur- '
day Evening Post, placed on the news stands yesterday, it
is written by Frederick R. Bechdolt, who was in Tombstone last
August collecting material for his Saturday Evening Post series,
"Stories of the Old West."
Mr. Bechdolt, in his extensive article, has caught the tr,ue spirit
of the early west, as typified in old Tombstone, now the progressive
little city which we know, but in the days of which he writes a
truly typical example of the "wild and woolly' western mining camp
which has now passed into limbo. Narratives of the founding of the
city, and of ili coming of the daring and hardy pioneer prospectors,
are plentiful in Mr. L'echdclt's article, and through them all runs
the vein of the Western romance that is gone.
Tombstone citizens may read the article with much the same
interest as a grown man would feel in coming across some account
of his almost forgotten bojhood days. And pioneers of Tombstone
may read it with a just sense of pride, for there is nothing in the
record of these courageous builders of the west at which a more
erudite society may point the finger of scorn today, and perhaps
much in the spirit of those advanturers of the early days which
might well serve as a model for a later age.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. G. Slept late, when I was awakened by the furniture man, who

over the question today decided that
air flying oa Sunday does nut violate

Border Town Warriors Twice
Beaten, Will Attempt to
Come Back; Local Squad
Hopes to Add Another Win
The football squad of the Bisbee
High school will meet the gridiron
ers of Nogales at the latter city
tomorrow afternoon in the third
game of the season. The local boys
will leave by auto this afternoon
and will return by the same method.
This is the first year in which
the Border City has had a football
team, and, although the team has
been defeated twice, it has put up
such a brand of football as has
given promise of being worth while
with more practice and experience.
Tucson and Douglas have defeated
Nog ales since the season's start,
and as Bisbee High has handed both
of these decisive trimmings there is
liitle doubt that the local boys will
come back victorious.

Clothing Workers
Extort Sums From
Employers, Charge
CHICAGO, Nov. 6. Charges that
agents of the Amalgamated Clothing
Workers of America have obtained
more than $500,000 from clothing
manufacturers in Chicago and other
ciiies, led to raids on the local head
quarters of the union today by detec
tives from the state attorney's office.
Books and records of the organiza
tion, including bank books of the
union and individual officials were
seized.
Allegations made to the state at
torney were to the effect that union
agents for their own profit , called
strikes agaidst manufacturers and
threatened and coerced them into
payment of sums ranging from ?500
to $30,C00. - The latter suni was paid
by one manufacturer In three install
ments of $10,000 each, according to
information in his possession. Assist
ant State Attorney Michaels an
nounced. A strike to enforce a wage
increase of $8 a week, a'forty-four
week and diversion of 25 per cent
of profits 'of. manufacturers to the
union was reported to have been
planned for next monHi. The union
agents are alleged to have sent slug
gers, from one city to another, and
some manufacturers actually were
put but of business, Mr. Michaels declared.

FRO II VOYAGE
ONSfBRHE;
Clair Madigan. a well-known Bis
bee boy who was employed as ma
chine man at the Shattuck-Arizona
mine before he joined the illnited
States navy, returned yesterday
afer two years' service in the sub-
marine branch. He will reside here
permanently. j
While Madigan has scores of tales
to tell of his work in what Is per
haps the most technical branch of
me navy, ana wnicn, especially since
the submarine attained such promi
nence in the great war, is perhaps
tho most important arm of the ser
vice, his most thrilling reminiscence
yesterday being of a typhoon in
which the ship was caught In the
China sea.
For two days, according to Madl-i
gan, it was impossible to lie in a1
bunk or hammock. For 16 hours of i
this time no food could be prepared
for the crew, while waves 70 feet
high, swept into being by a wind
that traveled 180 miles an hour and
threatened to crush the vessel. . Be
fore returning from the Asiatic
coasts to receiv his discharge, Madi
gan's ship was held in quarantine at
Nagasaki, Japan, because of cholera.

NEW YORK, Nov. 6. Young more interested in people than In
woman, do you yearn for a husband ideas. She is more conscientious
and mo-e adaptable than men."
But Dr. Beatrice Hinkle says "no"

work, take care of tho baby, anc'
mr.ke tin pies and biscaut:?
You can get him, if yo i look
around. There are just us many men
who are fitted to do housework f.s
there aie who are fitted to d'g
ditches, run machinery and go to
war.
There are no such ihings as "mas
culine" men and "fe;n!nine" women.
Sex hasn't anything to do with it.
Man or woman, if you belong to the
"extravort" type of humanity, you
are aggressive, self-confident; while
if you are an "introvert" you arc
thoughtful, hesitant, les? aggressive
and lew. sure of yourau'if. Women
are not necessarily weak, submissive,
changeable, timid or irrational, nor I
are men necessarily aggroKsIv,-,' con

Points of Differetice.
Such was the answer cf Dr. Beat
rice Hiukle of New Yo.-k before the
international conference of women
physicians at the Y. W. C. A. head
quarters here to the conclusions of
Dr. G. Stanley Hall of Claik cdkge,
Worcester, Mass.. who addressed the
conference on "Points of Difference
Between Men and Women."
The mere man physician held to
tho old fashioned idea that there r.re
essential differences between the
sexes; that the gentle art of persua
sion, the ability to "get her own
way, me power or cajonry, reset as
from th? fact that women are not
as strong or aggressive as men, and
that they have therefore trained
themselves to accomplish results in
a pure'y "feminine" way.
"Woman's motherhood powei s
make her more sympathetic," said
he. "Htr moods are richer and more
varied than those of men. She is
sites to those they themselves pos
sess. The "introvert" type of man
will prefer the "extravert" type of
woman the woman with a strong,
to the assertion that woman is the . assertive personality, will look with

"Both men and womn have suf
fered from the conventiowl assump
tion that the man must be the supe
rior being and th ewomaa the weak
er vessel," she said. "Many men do
not wish to be superior. They dc
not wish to be warlike and aggressive
find they suffer from the opinion that
they must not be sensitive. Mar.y
women, on the other hand, suffer
just as much because they are sup
posed to be weak, timid and full -of
moods, when they are nothing cf the
sort."
Dr. Hinkle admits that there are
probably secondary sex characteris
tics, but that such distinction play
no real part in the fitness of men or
women to enter any field of indusliy,
are or letters.
"Differences lin' temperament, at
tributed to sex, are reaily ci matter
of type," she asserts. "Ths human
race is divided into 'extravetts and
'introverts' with graduations between
them. There are men of each type
and there are women of each type, i
We must remove the artificial taboo
we have placed in the names of
'masculine' and 'feminine.' A wom
an's work always has been much
more restricted than that of a man.
We must stop1 telling human beints
to feel in a certain way or to work
at certain things because of 'heir
sox."
Opposite Characteristics.
Dr. Hinkle believes that the nulli
ties that women like in men, and
vice versa, are generally the oppo-
favor upon the man who possesses
the opposite' characteristics.
"Marriage ought to be finer and
more enduring than ever before when
th? two parties to it feel they can
be themselves, honest with each
other, keeping up no traditional bar
rier of artifice and convention," she
concluded.

Tiny Zumsteg vs. Bruner
Zumsteg.
Twenty-eight rounds of boxing,
with the added attraction of a Jazz
orchestra, is the offering to be pre
sented to Warren district fight fans
at the Grand theater tonight by O. S.
French, manager of the Bisbee Ath
letic club. The main event, in which
Johnnie Celmars of Los Angeles and
Russeil Chambers of Douglas will ap
pear, looks like perhaps the finest
10-round go that has been arranged
for Bisbee in many moons. Both
men are In the best of condition,
with Celmars a favorite ; here but
with plenty of supporters for Cham
bers making themselves heard in bet
ting "circles. ,
The battle between Bob Collins and
Frank Ford, which will be the semi
final, is also being looked forward to
as a real conflict. Each man packs
a heavy punch, and there is a general
belief that, one of them will measure
the canvas" before the six rounds are
ended.
Kid La Salle comes to Bisbee froii
Phoenix with a reputation as a shifty,
celver boxer, with plenty of punch
and experience, while his opponent,
Kid Griffith of Douglas was recom
mended to Manager French by Kid
George, who has been training with
Chambers in the Smelter City. Kid
Higgins, who is known as a willing
boy, is taking good care of himself,
and is becoming better every time he
steps into the ring. His opponent is
of the same caliber,, and a bout worth
while will mark their meeting.
The Zumsteg brothers, 9 and 11
years old. will furnish the curtain
rauers. The youngsters have proved
a big attraction wherever they have
appeared and are to be shown to
night by Manager French in response
to popular request.
The show will open promptly at
8:30 o'clock. There is 1o be abso
lutely no delay in beginning the card,
according to French, and the succeed
ing events are to be staged with no
waits.
The referee will be Al Williams of
Iouslas, who has given general sat
isfaction there for several months,
and who has a thorough knowledge
of the game. The decision, however,
will be rendered by two judges, one
of whom - will be selected by each
fighter. In case the judges disagree,
the referee will then make the award.
Good delegations of fight ; fans
are expected from Tombstone and
Douglas, which with the attendance
from the district, will probably he
all that the theater can hold.
Bob Sweeney,, Celmars' manager,
arrived In Bisbee last evening, and
will tuperintend the work of the sec
onds In his fighter's corner this eve-
TiinET.
The ticket Bale for the fights will
open at the Grand theater at 3 o'clock
this afternoon, bo that men coming
off shift will be able to get good Beats.
The unsold tickets will be called in
frnm the different stands in Bisbee
and Lowell, where they have been on
oai and these seats will be maae
available for those who have not pur

OUTSIDE OF UNIVERSITY
BY FRED TURBYVILLE
N. E. A. Sports Writer
The post-war readjustment brought
quite a change in the athletic complex
ion of the country. Football no longer
is considered a Bporth for collegians
alone. They're playing It on the sand
lots and in the baseball parks. The
many service teams in this country
and the teams overseas played the
game last fall and the year before.
Soldier boys who hal never gone to
college learned the game and liked it.
It has become Immensely . popular as
one of the major sports. It always
was a popular school sport.
Some of the greatest football stars
of all time.s are playing professional
football this fall. Such men -as Jin?
Thorpe, Paul Des Jardiens, Joe Guyon,
Church Barrett and-Chamberlain, for
merly o Nebraska, are finding the old
gridiron lure still strong and they're
making good money, too. Professional
football pays well.
The most successful professional
teams are those of Canton, MIsslllon,
Akron and Cleveland", rn Ohio, and
Hammond (Ind.) team.
Jim Thorpe, manager of the Canton
bulldogs, has a great collection of col
lege stars. He has Guyo, Calic, Cham
berlain, Telfer of Darmouth, and
Cochrane of Georgetown. He plays
himself.
The Massillon Tigers have Church
Barrett of Cornell and are now after
LJmer Oliphant, old army star, who is
coaching West Point.
The Cleveland Tigers have Pirotti,
former star at Wasligton, and Lee.
The Hammond Crackerjacks have
besides Das Jardiens, Ghee of Dart
mouth and Halas of Illinois.
These are only a few of the head
liners. There are many other college
men on the teams. Several are All
American players.
Nearly every city and town in the
country has repsesentative gridiron
teams this fall. I believe there are
twice as many as there ever were be
fore. Football fits in nicely in the sport
calendar, succeeding a long season of
baseball when outdoor conditions are

RED GROSS W
WHAT MAKES AN IDEAL HUSBAND?
"MAGNETISM," SAYS PEGGY WOOD
In an official announcement of the
purposes of Ihe national campaign
of the American Red Cross to en
roll dollar members from November
22 to 11, Dr. Livingston Farrend,
chairman of the central committee
of the organization, said:
"The Red Cross comes before the
American people 'with a call for a
large and widely distributed mem
bership which shall give to its peace
program the spirit and effective
ness which made its accomplishment
in war astonishing to Europe and a
source of satisfaction to all patriotic
Americans. -
"The emergencies of war created
demands which could only be met
with great sums of money and these
were furnished by the people with
unexampled generosity. The peace
program to which the Red Cross
has set its band calls for no such
financial outlay but does involve
continuous co-operative personal ser
vice which shall reach into every
corner of the country.
"For this reason, in the campaign
set for November 2 to 11, inclusive,
the Red Cross is stressing not money
but perso:il enlistment. What is
necessary to accomplish the import
ant tasks of peace is the member
with his dollar and his heart and
his service.
"The Red Cross proposes nothing
less than the mobilization of the
American people in a united, con-j
structive effort to eliminate prevent
able and unnecessary misery from
American life. It. calls upon the
American citizen to translate his
patriotism into action and service."
(This is the last of the series of
seven articles on "What Makes an
ideal Husband," which the Review has
been publishing daily. The wide
spread interest taken in this series by
the women of the Warren District has
been attested by the number of letters
received by the editor, expressing the
opinions of local women on the sub
ject. Other series on domestic sub
jects, of epual general interest, will
be published in the Review in the
near future. Ed.)
America' Prima
Donna Sings For
Columbia Record
BY PEGGY WOOD
NEW YORK. Nov. 6. Thfre is one
quality which I think is important
above all others in picking a husband
for a successful marriage, tl is an in
clusive quality, and for want of a bet
ter name, I would call it "magnetism,"
It is that quality which "makes people
like you." It includes appreciutiveness
and aiso a sense of humor.
Everyone knows the "magnetic"
rersonality and although personal
magnetism is oftener ascribed to wo
men as a "feminine" characteristic
than it is to men, I think it is even
more important in men than in wo-,
men. In a man, magnetism is that,
characteristic which corresponds to
"charm" in a woman. I like a charm
ing woman and a magnetic man.
. The man who has megnetism is a
human, he as able to appreciate a wo
man, he can laugh when a laugh is
called for and be serious when the
occasion demands it. iie "understands
a woman," as I have heard it put. He
is the kind of a man to whom a woman
teels instinctively drawn ,one in whom
&he feels that she can put her trust.
It is difficutl to describe magnetism,
but every woman knows the quality in
a man when- she meets with it.
The magnetic man is abel to appre
ciate a wife something that so many
husbands lack and lie is likely to
wear better on acquaintance than
most any other type of the male.
Therefore, I think this qualiay is most
important in picking a husband.
A noteworthy offering among Co
lumbia Records for November is
the touching and intensely dra
matic "O Patria Mia!" from Ver
di's "Aida." All the heartaches of
the captive maiden is heard in the
strains of this famous aria as it is
sung by Rosa Ponselle.
Barrientos and Stracciari are
heard in a thrilling rendition of the
ringing "vengeance duet" from Rig
oletto and Stracciari puts all the
masterly art of a finished opera
singer into the simple words and
melody of Von Tilzer's "What the
Evening Bells Are Ringing."
A song from Carmen, Micaela's
sweet and tender aria, is charming
ly given by Hulda Lasbanska. Am
parito Farrar is heard to splendid
advantage in two numbers Moskow
ski's "Serenata" and Tosti's "Vene
tian Song."
"Say, Art. did you notice how
crosseyed Bob's girl was?"
"Notice it! Why, sajOittle girl,
when I sat next to her at dinner she
was so cross-eyed she ate off my
plate." Lehigh ' Burr.

SEES DANGER OF DRIFTING
"Bisbee, Nov. 6, 1919.
"Editor Review:
"Allow me to disagree most heart
ily with the writer of the letter which
sees 'danger in too mucn propinqui
ty.' I believe that any couple who
take so little pleasure In each other's
society that they are obliged to go
away from each other every so often
to avoid an open breach, are certainly
far from being well-mated, and had
no business to get married in the
first place. Living their social lives
apart, husband and wife are apt to
drift apart in the deeper things of
life,' an unfortunate condition which
must inevitably end in the divorce
court or worse. Yours sincerely,
"HAPPILY MARRIED."

AVAUNT, GREEN-EYED MONSTER
"Lowell, Nov. 6.
"Dear Editor:
f My husband could be almost any
thing else he wanted to be if he
would only refrain from jealousy. The
jealous husband makes both himself
and his wife miserable, and 99 times
cut of 100, without the slightest shred
of cause or excuse. He sees Intrigue
in an innocent glance, and every act
of his wife is open tosuspicion in his
mind until she has proved it innocu
ous. I think all young girls should
study their suitors ror presence of
this trait before becoming engaged.
It Is not necessary to flirt in order to
accomplish this aim; a man's actions
and looks in connection with the
simplest incidents will betray
