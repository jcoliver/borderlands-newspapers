"In any event,' he said, "no Amer

ALASKA Oil EVE OF

All Previous Records of Pro
duction Expected to Be
Broken Soon
SEWARD, Alaska, Feb. 20.--(By
Mail.) In Alaska to make a survey
of various resources for Secretary of
the Interior Lane, W. A. Ryan is quot
ed in the Seward Gateway as saying
that Alaska is on the eve of a re
vival' of mining that soon will result
in production surpassing its best pre
vious records.
Numerous discoveries of more or
less apparent value have been made in
well-known Alaskan mining regions
this winter, according to Ryan. In
the Fairbanks district a discovery has
been reported in the Saloha country.
New discoveries, he says, have been
reported from Eve and Moose creeks,
tributary to the Xenana river, anu
from the vicinity of Lignite or Hasan
na creek. A considerable movement
of prospectors into the hills in the
Bounifield district indicates the grad
ual spread of knowledge concerning
mineral discoveries adjacent to the
government railroad.
In the past,' Mr. Ryan pointed out,
most of the North's rich gold-finds
have been made near waterways, me-'
not venturing far from '. avenues ' of
communication. This.' of course,. was
never advanced as an argument that
paying minerals were not to be found
elsewhere, so that the opening of the
government railroad is considered
likely to bring out new bonanzas. The
Broad Pass country is' cited as one
isolated region 7 which; known to be
rich in various minerals, will be easily
accessible to prospecting and develop
ment after the railroad has pierced ::.
Other newer and rich fields, similar
ly isolated before, will likewise be
opened.' . '

with the public more nearly appre

ever before. He said the expenditures
required of the government for opera
tion of the roads would not show as
great a loss as many people suppose
"While the world has beu movins
rapidly toward the eight-hour day,'
said Mr. Hines, "the issue came more
quickly with the war. The govern
ment had to follow a policy of uni
formity with ' respect to wages and
hours. Higer wages and Improvements
would have come anyway."
The purchasing power of the dollar
has been greatly diminished, he said,
and it followed that the railroad's
suffered as much as any other dollar.
The 2,000,000 railway empyoyes, or a
very large part of them, had been paid
low wages, and the government was
confronted with and had met the diffi
cult problem of increasing wages soon
after federal administration began.
But he said the increases were in the
nature of a permanent "improvement"
of the basis of labor.
In speaking of a permanent solution
of the railroad problem, the director
general said he believed some new

of private operation by some' 170 com

ful. He said the suggestion of S.
Davies Warfield, head of a norganiza

a statutory standard of reasonable

was getting nearer to one of the fun

OUTLOOK GOOD FOR
BRIDGE AT PARKER
PHOENIX, - March 2S Prospects
are bright for- the . proposed bridge
across the Colorado river at Parker,
according to State Engineer Maddock.
At the last session of the legislantre
a bill passed appropriating $30,000 for
this work providing California and the
federal government each set aside a

ued: "When W. W. Patch .divisional en
gineer for the California highway
commission, arrived here, we sent him
to Parker at once .accompanied by R.

WOMEN PUT FORWARD
MUCH LEGISLATION
IN MONTANA HOUSE
Passage of Several Measures
Prevented, Others Aided
by Representatives
(Br Revltw Leasea Wire)
HELENA. Mont., March 2 3. "What
was women's work in the sixteenth
legislative assembly?" Mrs. Magg:
Smith Hathaway, representative in the
lower house, was asked by the Associ
ated Press. Mrs. Hathaway and Rep
resentative Emma Ingalls of Flatheaa
county were the only women in the
assembly.
Mrs. Hathaway won laurels as a
parliamentarian and presided several
times over the committee of the whole
house.
"Women's work was two-fold," sa
replied. "We prevented passage of
bad bills, as well as repeal of good
bills and we put some good bills
over.
"I began to feel like a uetective,
before the session ended, for Mrs.
Ingalls and I were ever on the alert roi
'jokers' in innocent looking legislation.
"For instance, I discovered an act to
repeal the age-of-consent law. I killed;
it, quickly. There w as another vicious
measure dealing with Juvenile delin
quency, that, would have consigned
juveniles to common jails, perhaps for
long terms, while awaiting law. We
also had that axed.
"My great task,'-' Mrs. Hathaway
continued, "was to prevent pernicious
amendments of the Mother's Pension
act, which I wrote four years ago.
Amendments as offered would practi
cally have nullified the law. We wosi
this fight, too."
Mrs. Hathaway spoke of the prohi
bition act passed by this assembly.
ARNOLD DALY IS A
DISTINGUISHED ACTOR
Mr. Arnold Daly, the star of Metro's
historical drama, "My Own United
States," which will be seen at the
Grand theater today and tomorrow, is
America's foremost actor. As rhfllip
Nolan "The Man Without a Country"
the dominating character around
v hieh the story centers, Daly gives a
steriing characterization. All the finer
artistry at the command of this dis
tinguished stage figure is brought imo
play in pieseiiting Nolan, in whom are
combined the sensitiveness of an ideal
ist and the recklessness of an ad
venturer. Daly is noted foi his characteriza
tion of Napoleon which he has pre
sented iu several plays, the most re
cent being "Josephine." Other current
plays in which he has starred are
"The Master," and "The Very min
ute." Born in Brooklyn, Daly was edu
cated there and entered the theatri
cal profession as a call boy at the
old Lyceum' theater, New York. His
first appearance as an actor was as a
butler with Fanny Rice. His imper
sonation of Chambers in "Puddin
Head . Wilson," with Frank Mayo,
brought him into notice. Then he ap
peared with success in "Because She
Loved Him So," "The Bird in the
Cage," "Barbara Frletchie," "Are You
a Mason?" "When We Were Twenty
one," "Secret Service," and other
rlays. He has been identified with
the production of plays by George Ber
nard Shaw, notably "Candida." in
which he played 150 nights. Other
Shaw plays in which he appeared are
"Arms and the Man," "Mrs. Warren's
Profession," and "The Man of Des
tiny." He was the founder of the
"Theater cf Ideas," at the Berkeley
Lyceum and there appeared as George
Washington in "Washington's Firs:
Defeat," as Arthur Blair Waldingham
in "The Van Dyck," as Richard Mur
ray in "The Shirkers," and as Dick
Anderson in "The Flag Station." He
has played with success in vaudevilief
and in motion pictures. Adv.

IjONDON. March 2S. (fcy the Asso

ly experience of war. when it was com
pelled to send enormous sums into
other countries In payment for petro
leum end petroleum products, the
British government had adopted a
clearly defined oil policy, and is al
ready' credited with financially back
ing what is expected here to develop
Into the most powerful oil producing,
refining . and transporting enterprise
In the history of the industry.
The government's first Important
movement, it was statedby authorities
here, will be the creation of a perma
nent oil ministry. The next move, it
is asserted, is the combination under
the; protection of the government of
tb most Important oil companies op
erating in British and neutral coun
tries. If they are wholly or partly
British owned. These Include such
concerns as the Royal Dutch, the Shell
I' lM the Lord Cowdray interests.
Controls Texas Property.
The Royal Rutch-Shell group con
trols Immense production in many
lands, including many properties in
Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, California
and Wyoming.
Interlocking directorates give it a
commanding place in such companies
as the Burman Oil company and the
Anglo-Persian oil company. The Brit
ish government la the largest stock
bolder In the last named company,
while the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Co.,
an Important? ubsldiary of the Royal
Dutch-Shell Interests, has a selling

close together. It is generally accept

ment Is not altogether satisfied with
Its 40 per cent interest in the Royal
Butch, and would like to have a more
important financial place in the cor
poration. This sentiment, it is said,
is seconded by the most important
Dutch stockholders, who feel they
would enjoy added safety for their
investment if backed by the financial
and military power, ot the imperial
government.
Powerful Company.
Pearson oil interests, that is,
the Lord Cowdray companies, are
perhaps the most powerful of all the
British companies.
The Cowdray interests include im
portant holdings In Mexico, where they
hate developed a targe producing field
and brought it to a mgh state sof
efficiency, including possession of the
necessary refineries and ships for the
manufacture and transportation of
their operations, and have taken ad
vantage of the experience gained byi
Americans from the early days of oil
df scoverJes da Pennsylvania pven.
now the operations in ' England" are
largely carried on by Americans.
'Of the 'Undeveloped territory . ta
wUch- the British government la said
to be looking, none is more important
than that known as. the Persian field.
Here the Anglo-Persian OH company
has ft concession of 00,000 square
miles on which a number of wells
hate, been drilled and w,hica already
has an annual profit production of ten

All Women Instinctively Love Gems, but Few Have De'el
oped Good Sense in Wearing It
By Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the Golden Apple"
Very few women know how to
wear Jewelry.
All women instinctively love
jewelry, "but few have developed
taste in its selection and wearing.
History does not record a time
when women did not decorate
themselves with tinkling orna
ments, finger rings, and even toe
rings, armlets, bracelets and ank
lets. Modern women seem to feel
that the more jewelry they can
pile upon themselves the more ar
tistically they are adorned.
Very few women can wear
more than one piece of jewelry to
advantage. If women would make
this a hard and fast rule they
would do a good thing for beauty.

Senators Who Opposed Mor

Final Session j
(By Review Lenscd 'IV'Ire) I
YUMA, March 2S. The 1920 conven- j
tion of the State Federation d Wom-
en's clubs will be hf-ld at Bisbee. This J
was decided late today at the confer
ence committee meeting of the federa
tion, which closed its business ses
sions here tonight.
A plea for united action by women
on legislation in which they are inter
ested, and an arraignment of nine
senators - who voted against the so
called "morality bills" at the last ses
sion of the legislature were features
of today's report of Mrs. J. L. Alex
ander, of Phoenix, chairman of the leg
islative branch.
Mrs. Alexander's report criticizec
the action of the Phoenix club in op
posing the school inspection bill when
she said, the voters of the majority of
other club members throughout the
state had been cast in its favor. In
this connection, she urged the oppolnt
ment of a special legislative commit
tee, three cf whose members would
remain permanently in Phoenix to in
sure speedy and direct action on leg
islation which affected women.
- Senators Named
Mrs. Alexander named the follow
ing senators as having voted against
the bill to raise the age of consent
from 16 to IS years; which passed the
house and was killed in the UDDer
I chamber: Elliott. cGodell, Hoarndon.
Johns, Hicks, Hughes, O'Neil, Whit
ing and Youngj The chairman added :
"This should guide us somewhat in
casting our ballots in future for mem
bers of the legislature if we would se
cure passage of morality laws."
The following statement occurreu
later in the report: "It i3 a signifi
cant coincidence that President Johns
of the senate voted against both house
bill Xo. 44, the bill referred to above,
and 45, (a bill which passed, raisin?
the marriageable age of females from
11 to 16 years.)
Americanization Plans
In the Americanization plans, the
women's clubs propose by a process of
helpful education and the introduc
tion of the study of the English lan
guage in Mexican homes to make a
united population of the residents ot
Arizona, irre&pectitve of color or
speech.
It also was proposed that women
take a leading part in a movement
to plant trees along state highways
and in public parks as memorials to
Arizona's men who have fallen on the
fields of battle in the great war. It
was suggested that the expenses of
caring for the trees after they are
planted be taken up by the state.
A resolution was adopted that tsc
clubs endorse only those bills com
ing before the legislature that are
fair of purpose and discountenance
any lobbying for bills which may be
introduced at the instance of the fed
eration. CAPTAIN BURNHAM DEAD

ments by Major General Crowder, i

Secretary Baker announced today j
that he had returned tne letter toi
Colonel Ansell with the suggestion!
that its publication would not be help-!
ful, and that if the officer had any
suggestion or recommendation as to j
changes in the court-martial system:
he could make it either to his supe
rior officers or the secretary of war. I
Colonel Ansell said he had no state-'
ment to make. Ifis friends asserted it;
was improbable that he wouU take
any steps toward making public the j
reply himself ,as such action would
be construed as insubordination and!
would render the officer liable to '

Forty years ago an old doctor was
putting up a medicine for; diseases of
the blood, that cured the worst cases
of specific blood poison, f and tlnit
proved that the cures were permanent.
After many years I secured the pre
scription (being a druggist), and took
each ingredient separately and refer
red to my U. S. Dispensatory and oth
er authoritative books on medicine
and found the medical properties set
down as follows: "Employed in dis
eases of the glandular system, in blood
poison, scrofula, constipation, stom
ach and liver troubles, chronic rheum
atism, catarrh, in sores, ulcers, skin
eruptions, mercurial and lead poison
ing. Under its use nodes, tumors and
scrofulous swellings that have with
stood all other treatment disappear-as
if by magic." To commemorate m
40th year as a druggist I named this i
medicine "Number 40 For The Blood."

Commencing April 1, THE REVIEW, will inaugurate a new system
of delivery based on the ownership by the boys of the routes. On the seme
date THE REVIEW will put into force a new subscription rate, made
necessary in part by the change in delivery system. Better service will
result for all subscribers with the inauguration cf the two systems.
The following subscription rates will be enforced after April 1:
4 One Week 5 .20
Six Months 4.C0
One Year 7.50
The only substantial change from the old subscription rate is in the
weekly charge, which is raised slightly. The old three-months rate has
been entirely discontinued. Ail rates are to be strictly in advance.
Under the new system the boys will have businesses of their own.
The community is divided into practically equal routes. Each boy owns
one. He pays THE REVIEW in advance for his papers, and collects from
his subscribers. What remains above his debt to THE REVIEW is his
profit
Under the old system the remuneration to carriers was so small
that it was difficult to secure and keep boys who take an interest in their
routes. By inaugurating the new plan, the boys are given businesses earn
ing as much as 6 per cent interest on $4,000. The attention they pay to
these businesses will determine how much more they will earn. And the
actual value of the route to the boy when he wishes to leave h's business,
is something from which he can realize ready cash. Under the same sys
tem a newsboy In San Francisco sold his route in the business district to
his succjssor for -$2,000.

For a good many centuries the sons of men have been iiromised' '
that if they tired it they would find that it was more blessed to. give.,
than to receive. ' . ! c;
But for the most part the sons of men let this text alone. 7
War has certainly improved tnis nation. -
First we gave because we had to; men because we felt we ought
to, and now we are giving because we prefer to give.
Never has the public given so. generously to every request.
We are giving more all the time.'
We met all .the drives and loans and taxes without hesitation; and
thcuga the exactions mount higher each week there is no .sign of public .
protesL '
And now, when one would imagine that public giving would be re
laxed a bit, we find the purses opening wider than ever.
One church starts a camraign for flCO.000,000 to evangelize the
world. '
Almost every church plans to raise more for missionary work, re- ,
construction work, pensions, social service, salaries, buildings, than ever
before; end several churches have launched plans that call for funds far
beyond all former expectation.
Society is busy adopting French orphans or finding work for re
turning soldiers; or rebuilding devastated towns; or filling a million botr
ties with nickles and dimes for hungry babies.
It ha been considered not quite the decent thing to die with all
your money intact, but now not only is there no protest over Uncle
Sam taking most of the larger incomes, but there is a general ambition
to spend what may be left in making this a better world.
America never was as money mad as Europe thought it, but today
mere money means less than nothing; and, as e nation, we are dis
covering that the beatitudes follow service, and happiness comes with
self sacrifice. ." '
We always were supposed to. believe this, but today we are ilving it.
.The Cheer
. Time was when the youngsters who went to the big cities to make
their way in the world rather laughed at-the old -folks when the latter
urged them to write home frequently. The boys rather thought it was
something of an imposition to ask them to take time from their busi
ness and pleasure every day or so to pen. an epistle to "the folks. They
viewed the letters from home rather casually. .Home was too close-by
too easy to reach to make them feel its temporary loss very keenly.
But when these same chaps arrived "over there" and began yodeling
for joy when a letter from" home reached them,, they soon learned what
it is to wait with anxious longing for the mail man and to feel that -dreary
sinking of the heart when he fails to. hand over the hoped-for
epistle. They discovered that the lonesomest feeling -in the world is
when the expected letter from home fails to arrive and they larnd how
important ltters are. They realized the inestimable cheer it brings to
have the loved ones at home writing lengthily and often.
Aiid now -when --tAfy are- bade in America- and- scooting -away" fronf"
the old firesides again to land jobs in other cities, they'll stop and
think and apply the reverse English to the situation they'll reciprocate
by writing back to the old folks at home lengthily and often.

Thomas A. French, acting secretary o fthe state penitentiary during
1918, and former secretary of the state federation of labor, has sued the
Ariozna Gazette, of Phoenix, for $50,000, $25,000 being charged as com
pensatory and the balance punitive damages.
Seveial libel suits have been tried in Arizona during the last few.
years. One suit, last year, resulted in considerable publicity being given
the then governor of the state he was the complainant if we remember
rightly. The one result of practically, all of the libel suits has been
advertising for the newspapers or newspaper people accused.
Newspapers believe in advertising. That is their stock in trade.
They adopt various and expensive methods for advertising their medium.
When sued for libel, however, the advertising value is tremendous. If we
were not familiar with the.parties to the suit we might" think that the
French suit i3 merely a clever publicity scheme on the part of the
manager of the Gazette.
In any event, the Gazette will secure columns of publicity and the
suit is a tacit acknowledgement of the effectiveness of that newspaper.
Of the result of the suit, we dare not forecast. We will wait and selp
advertise the Gazette when the trial takes place. Arizona Star.
Taft as Truth-Teller
The other night former President Taft was making a speech in favor
of the League of Nations. He was interrupted by somebody who
wanted to know about Ireland. Now, of course, there are senators,
who, interrupted that way, "would see the whole Irish vote coming to
them if they got off some blarney talk that sounded good, but got
nowhere.
But Taft isn't built that way. He said we must do one thing at a
time. Right now the job was to perfect a charter for thej League of
Nations. It was no time to discuss internal matters, wheUier it was
Ireland's relation to England or our own to the Philippines.
"That does not sound political,' but I'm not political. I am telling
you the truth."
And that's just exactly the measure of difference between Taft and
some of these senators who are opposing the League of Nations. Whether
their inspiration is not personal hostility, it is just plain political.
Starr, the Cherokee bandit, has been released from the Oklahoma
penitentiary. He says he is through with the rough stuff. Good boy.

Set for Drive Pledged as
Time Limit Nears
Following the meeting yesterday of
team captains and members, time for
the Y. M. C. A.-Y. W. C. A. annual
budget drive was extended until next
Monday evening at 7 o'clock, when
the campaign will conclude. This an
nouncement was made from Y. M. C.
A. headquarters yesterday at the con
clusion of the daily workers' confer
ence. At the .Monday night meeting the
official returns and reports of the
twelve captains will be tabulated and
the final results pt the drive will
be announced. It "is hoped by tnen
that the full sum of $11,600. the bud
get needs of me two associations, will
have been raised.
An especial appeal to residents of
the district to bring in their contri
butions to the fund, either to the Y.
M. C. A. or the Y. W. C a., was issued
by members of the committee in
charge of the drive yesterday, lit
will be impossible for the teams to
visit every person in the district per
sonally, declarea the committee, and
for this reason some who wish to sub
schibe to the budget fund will be over
looked. "If the workers have not seen you,
see them," said one cf the commit
tee, "or, better yet ,go k tne Y. M.
C. A. tor the Y. W. C. A. and leave
your pledge."
Yesterday the drive was continuing
with fair success compared with days
preceding anc at the close of hours
last evening the management of the
campaign reported that approximately
one-half of the objective of the drive
had been obtained.
For some unaccountable reason the
campaign slowed down considerably
yesterday, as only a small number of
subscriptions were reported. However,
team captains are determined that
they will go over the top with the
complete quota: There are yet many
places to canvas and workers are con
fident that, with a few large donations
added to those already promised tte
fond will be swelled to quite an ex
tent With only $5,500 reported up to last
night, there is still $6,100 to be ob
tained, and. for the purpose of raising
this sum, the. residents of this disrtict
are asked to subscribe an amount if
only a dollar. If 3,000 persons in the

a complete success, as there are a few

I was not able to do any of my work

was confined to my bed off and on. I got

of nations with the ambitions of the
former emperor of Germany, United
States Senator Miles Poindexter of
Washington, in an address before
members of the City cjub today advo
cated the formation of alliances as a
substitute for the proposed covenant.
"The kaiser sought to set up a world
government," Senator Poindexter de
clared, "and there is not a doubt that
he believed it was for the best inter
ests of mankind. He proposed to en
force peace and to suppress the strug
gling aspirations for freedom. Like
wise the constitution of the proposed
league proposes to enforce peace, to
put the world in a straightjacket and
- expressly provides that the members
of the league shall guarantee the ter
ritorial and political integrity of all
the members against attack.
'Instead of joinirig the league,
America can enter alliances with na
tions that fought the war with her and
the result would be the same as that
promised by the league without tan
possibility of surrendering American j
sovereignty.
"The Monroe doctrine is essentially
American, and therefore it is impos
sible to spread it all over the world
as this super-government, the league
of nations, proposes to do."
The senator declared the proposed
interference of the proposed league
with the self-determinations of the va
rious countries' peoples would be a
cause instead of a preventative of
awr.
(By Revien ieasea Wire)
ST. LOUIS, March 28. United
States Senator Miles Poindexter ot
Washington, here today to address the
City club on the league of nations,
said: ' -
"I am opposed to the setting up of a
super-government which shall have
the power to enforce decrees which
would come in conflict with the sover
eign rights of this country. If the plan
as finally worked out provides only for
a free union of free nations, acting in
dependently together for the preserva
tion of peace, it might be discussed on
an equal basis."
The Washington senator declared
that the military power of the United
States should be retained solely- un
der American control.
Force, he said, was to be behind the
leagues, formed on a plan for a govern
ment of the world similar to the rela
tions of the states and federal govern
ment of this country.
"If the league exercised the power
which is to be conferred upon it un
der the constitution," said Senatoi
Poindexter, "civil war within, the
league would arise within a few years,
and, if the league determines to main
tain its power, as it well might, the
war would be a war of extermination,
of conquest, the bloodiest and most
destructive that the human race has
ever experienced, not excepting the
war just closed."
Nations as well as individuals, Sen
ator Poindexter predicted, will con
tinue to have disputes and to settle
them by force of some kind, and per
petual peace, he asserted, is an. illu
sion. "Neither the Monroe doctrine noi
the Panama canal, nor any of the vital
interests of America," he added, "can
be left to the good will or generosity
of Great Britain or any other power,
and still less to an alien league of
powers."

Eli Markenstein and Aaron Siegol
were arrested when they alighted from
a Metz train in Paris Tuesday, it be-

A report from Amsterdam quotes

Member of 20th Engineers, Rc turned From Across, Says He
Heard Few Complaints Against War Work
S
TUCSON, March 2S. Sergt. P. H. , regiment being assigned for canteen
Harley, 11th Battalion, 20th Engineers,
is in the city, having recently returned
from overseas. He enlisted in the
Engineers from this point, having been
in the forestry service, and will leave
for Flagstaff shortly to re-enter that
service.
"What do you think of the Y. M.
C. A.?" Sergeant Harley was asked.
"That was about the first question
that was asked me when I landed and
about the first was asked when I got
to Tucson," replied the sergeant, "ana
in appreciation of the 'services it ren
dered me as only one of two million
American soldiers who went abroad
.nd of the benefit and comfort I re
ceived, I am glad of an opportunity to
give an account of the Y. M. C. A.'s
activities as I found them on my
moves through France.
"On oar way over, we (the 10th
Engineers) passed through Scotland
and England,' stopping five days
at
Southampton txfore crossing the chan
nel to France. Strangely enough, as
we left America it was with a feeling
that we were departing from aj
thing3 American. It never occurred
to me nor had I at that early day ben
informed that there would be any or-
,. . .
rraniznHon of effort made tn r,2rr
the .heme feeling along with the boys
And it was that want, the feeling that
we would be out of touch with home
ties, of which we often thought though
seldom spoke among ourselves.
"So at Southampton -we had hardiy
unslung our packs and been given ou?
liberty until we discovered close to our
camp a real American Y. M. C. A. Dur
ing our five days stay there I am sure
most every man of our regiment visit
ed that "Y" and the first thought ot
entering there was to write home and
tell them there we were in a "little
America" the Y. M. C. A. (Many of
our first letters just got as far as the
censor's desk).
"In this Y. M. C. A., as in all Y. M.
C. A.'s which I later entered, we found
music (piano and graphaphone), books
and magazines," and billiards and oth
er popular games, and all these means
of entertainment were eagerly, which
I emphasize, ;taken advantage of. Yes,
then we were in "little America" and
in high spirits. I do not mention the
canteen there, which I do want to
mention later.
Ice Team at Front
; "From Southampton we crossed the
channel and landed at Le Havre. We
immediately took ,the train and after
riding two days and nights were told
to "unload." We found ourselves at
Nevers (Nievre), in central France.
There we found the Y again and in
addition to ail the comforts I mention
ed before it was the only place we;
could get canteen supplies, tobacco
and candy. At that time these items
were in the French shops but their
scarcity, especially candy, made the
prices out of reach of the soldier at
any time except on payday. Here, too,
the Y. M. C. A. made and sold us ice
cream, something unknavn to, the
French. At Nevers we could not buy
supplies from the quartermaster
(1917).
"At Nevers our regiment was split
up and sent to various parts of France.
I was sent with a small detachment to
Gievres (Loir et Cher), a small village
at which place was later located the
larges A. E. F. engineer-supply depot.
Here again I found the Y. M. C. A.
in a large barracks building. In it I
found the nearest approach to home
comforts, with writing material, piano,
magazines and newspapers, and for a
time the only place we could find a
fire to get warm, it being the winter
Of 1917-1S.
Bid 25c for Tobacco
"No canteen had yet been installed
and such luxuries as candy an dtobac
co were not luxuries but impos
sibilities. Many of the Loys were of
fering 25c for a 5c package of smoking
tobacco without success. When the
canteen was later installed it was the
most popular place in camp. Up to
this time (March, 1918) at the camps
I had been in, the quartermaster was
not selling supplies direct to the sol
dier. As this camp at Gievres grew,
the Y's activities grew with it, ana
before I left there in March, 191S, the
V. M. C. A. was giving moving pic-
ture shows (free, of course) wceiiy,
and was conducting ail forms of
amusement, such as boxing, wrestling,
musical concerts, etc. They also fur
nished basketball, football and base
ball outfits for these real American
games.
"From Gievres our tictacnmcnt was
sent about France and at every stop of
course wc always found the welcome
of lhe red triangle.
"Finally I wan sent down in the
wooieri area of the Landes, where I
stif-nt mv longest stop at any one camp
and where I was at the close of the I
war j,ere at pontenx-les-Forges the
Y. M- C A. was well estaDiisnea. wnn
canteen, music, reading and wrltin-,
accommodations, billiards and furnish
ing all sorts of entertainments week
ly. Everything was given free except
:lie canteen supplies and it was lier
that I noticed that prices on a few
items were a little higher than the
quartermaster prices when it was pos
sible to reach a Q. M. store.
"But our Y. M. C. A. canteen was un
der direct supervision and control oi
our military commander, two of our

work. And our nearest Quartermaster
store was located 76 kilometers (50
miles) from our camp and we couia
only reach it when on leave' or when
omciai amies cauea us tnere. so the
small differences in prices, which were
small, I never questioned or even won
dered at for the supplies and their sale
were handled under our own regi
mental control.
"No specific 'overcharge' do I have
in mind, for I never felt that I wa
over-charged on a single item. I was
always only too glad that it were pos
sible to get the canteen supplies.
"In summing un my experience with
the Y. M. C. A. 1 can only do it by ex-
pressing my gratitude for the number-
less things it has done for our comfort,
of which we never make mention,

"The only complaint I ever heard
abroad was that of overcharge at times.
But I never experienced it. Being out
of reach of a quartermaster depot I
could not make daily comparison, of
prices, but I feel the prices I paid for
items could only cover cost of pur
chase and transportation to us surely
no profit.
"And the complaints I heard were
only general, never specific, and small
in comparison to those made because
our tents leaked ,or because our mail
was slow in reaching us, etc., but I felt
all these kicks were against the great
America that was doing its utmost to
provided everything for us, and I . felt
that the kicks against the Y. M. C. A.
were unjust kicks against a great or
ganization which was doing its all and
making great personal sacrifices to
carry to us not only the ever present
message but the ever present consci
ousness of the care and comofrt the
folks at home wanted us to have,
"Personally that is what the Y. M. C.
A. has been to me a real connecting
link between the foreign and unfa
miliar atmosphere I was in, and my
home in America, When I was think
ing of those across the sea, usually I
would end the day at the Y. M. C. A.
where everything symbolized America
and home." .

COLORED MINSTRELS
ARE THE BEST
The modern minstrels evolved from
the colored race. The negro if he can
be restrained from becoming self con
scious makes the best minstrel man.
Any person is sure of a good laugh if
they can be around a group of negroes
30 minutes without the latter knowing
they are near because the colored man
is then perfectly natural.
There have been many colored min
strel organizations which were unsat
isfactory in their entertainment be
cause the colored performers were
self conscious and did not act natural.
Mr. R. M. Harvey, a well known circus
man undertook the task of asesmtling
a company of clever colored people
who are not posers, who were capable ,
of always remaining natural even on
the stage.
Harvey's Greater Minstrels billed
for the Grand theater, in this city,
next Monday and Tuesday, March 31
and April 1, is headed by Mr. Ed Tol
liver and Mrs. Clarence Fowell, both
natural comedians and do their best to
create a furore of amusement and
laughter at every performance.
Traveling in their own 80-foot car,
this company of 40 colored artists are
playing in the principal cities and
towns of the state and judging from
press comments and verbal criticisms
