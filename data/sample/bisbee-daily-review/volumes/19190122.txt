The senator urged that those in

CHARGE FORD
EAGLE BOATS
WERE FAULTY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. Han? E.
Leroy, of Saginaw, Mich., formerly em
ployed as a constructor at the Ford
Detroit boat plant, testified before the
senate naval committee today that the
Eagle boats built for the navy at the
plant were seriously faulty in design
and construction. He said the walls
of the craft were weak, particularly
about the engine and fire room. When
he reported his observations to his
employer, he said, they promised to re
port the criticism to the navy depart
ment. Rear Admiral Taylor, chief con
structor, recently testified the Eagles
had conformed to designed character
istics and were useful both Tor war
and peace purposes.
Leroy also criticized the character
of workmen employed at the Ford
shipyards, declaring most were for
eigners, including many Germans and
Austrians, unable to speak to under
stand their superintendents, who had
to give orders by manual signs.
Senator Pittman of Nevada, demo
crat, asked Mr. Leroy If there was any
connection" between the witness'
criticism of the "Eagle" boats and the
political controversy between Henry
Ford and Truman H. Newberry. Le
roy said he went to the office of Paul
King of Detroit, campaign manager
for Newberry, and there wrote a letter
in criticism of the "Eagle" boats to
Senator Lodge, the republican leader,
who proposed the committee's Investi
gation. Democratic senators also closely
questioned Leroy as to his experience
! as a shipbuilder. The witness said
he had built few boats, none over 25
feet in length, but had built pianos
1 and other mechanical devices. While
at the "Eagle" shipyards, he was in
charge of riveting gangs, Leroy said.

I WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. Kdward
! Reynolds of New York, who recently
was relieved of his duties as vice
I president and general manager of the
Postal Telegraph-Cable company by
Postmaster General Burleson told the
j house postoffice committee today that
' the only excuse for the government
j retaining control over the telephone
i nam, a member of the Minnesota com
misison.
Burleson Used Arbitrary Power
Mr. Reynolds said that 'to utilize
the government control for increasing
telephone rates as is now being done
by the postmaster general is assuming
authority that congress did not confer
upon the postmaster general t and de
clared that efforts now " are being
made to increase telegraph charges.
Burieson Wanted Increased Rates
"Mr. Burleson's operating committee
consisting of a Western Union man,
two Bell telephone men and one inde
pendent telephone man," the witness
declared, "has within the last few days
tried to get the Postal company to
agree to increased telegraph rates and
tha Postal company has refused. If
the government will turn back at once
the Postal telegraph lines we wih con
tinue to carry on the telegraph busi
ness at present rates." -
W. U. Wants Huge Monopoly
The witness accused the postmaster
general, Theodoro N." Vail and New
comb Carleton. president of the West
ern Union company, "of seeking to
consolidate all telegraphic and tele
phone and cable lines into one huge
monopoly," and said there is no good
reason why all the lines should not be
turned back at once and the loss now
sustained by the government in their
operation stopped.
No Advantage in Consolidation
"The idea that a great consolidation
and the wiping out of competition and
the grant of subsidies for new cables
will confer great benefits upon the
American public, is put forward to de
ceive. Such a combination would im
pose a hardship upon the public with
out giving, it a single advantage."
Discharged by Burleson for Opposition
Mr. Reynolds said that Postmaster
General Burleson had discharged him
as a pcstal official because he sought
to prevent Mr. Burleson's plan for con
solidation of wire companies. He also
declared his company refused to ac
cept the compensation award of $1,
6S0.000 made by the postmaster gen
eral because the company earned $4,
296,000 in the calendar year 1917.
Fictitious Figures Used by Burleson
Chairman . Moon of the committee,
asked if the Postal company had not
filed a sworn statement with the Inter
state Commerce commission that its
property was valued at $6,447,000, but
Mr. Reynolds answered that this was
not the actual value of the property,
but the equity stock value represent
ed by the 39 companies composing the
Postal. In reply to further question
ing by Mr. Moon, it was stated that
Mr. Burleson fixed the company's
property value at $2S,000.000 for com
pensation purposes.
"I don't know where they got that
figure," said Mr. Reynolds regarding
the company's property, "for the post
master general has not Inspected our
property yet."

Merchants that retire from business because they didn't find it profit

This Is the advertising age life and sustenance of business demand
It,
Modern competition Is sharp, keen and pitiless and there is practically
no way to stem the tide except by persistent advertising.
Twentieth Century ideas and methods must be in vogue in a live es
tablishment, if they wish to march triumphantly past the other fellow.
There is not a business on earth that cannot be helped by the right
kind of advertisring.
People like to buy of a house that advertises, for they feel more as
sured of a firm's prestige and when once a customer begins to trade
at a store they most likely keep on indefinitely.
Money Invested In good advertising Is certain to produce a profit as is

meats, Mr. Armour said the reason
why bacon now costs 70 cents a pound
against 25 and 30 cents four years ago
- could be readily understood. Prices of
live hogs had increased 245 per cent
in that time, he declared, while costs
of labor and fuel had doubled.
The market prices of by-products
had not increased in the same ratio as
live hogs, he asserted, and this neces
sarily put a greater price burden on
the edible parts of the animal.
Mr. Armour's prepared statement
covered 6S printed pases and the wit
ness voice became so weak before the
end that he had one of his associates
complete its reading. The afternoon
session was devoted entirely to the
questioning of Mr. Armour by mem
bers of the committee.
"How far are the 'ramifications' of
the mefct packers to extend?" asked
Chairman Sims, referring to criticism
by the federal commisison of the en
trance of the packers into trades ap
parently unrelated to the killing of
meat animals. "'If you can tan leather,
why can't you manufacture shoes, es
pecially as you control such quantities
of hides? And why can't you retail
those shoes to the public. If you can
make lard compound from cottonseed,
why can't you go into the business of
raising cotton and. of spinning the

that we can do all those things," the
witness replied. "There is more reason
for us to engage in cattle raising than
in shoe manufacture, but so long as I
am alire, my firm will do neither. We
could not make a success of shoe
manufacturing, because it is a sepa
rate industry. A business has to stop
expansion at the point where it loses
efficiency " by adding more articles
than it and its salesmen can handle
with profit. There's a limit to what
a man can do well.
Mr. Armour asserted that many
small packing plants were competing
with his firm and were making more
money on their invested capital, be
cause the large corporations expenses
are greater.
Then you ought to split up into
small concerns," Mr. Sims suggested.
"No, because we make a greater ag

ment to acquire stockyards, refrigera
tor cars and other adjuncts of the
business, should not be passed. He
declared that, the packer owned re
frigerator cars made nearly twice as
many miles a day as the railroad-owned
cars supplied to shippers not own
ing cars, because the packers kept
tracers constantly after their rolling
stock. He denied there was any dis
crimination on the part of the rail
roads. "Then if you operate these cars so
efficiently end yet lose money on
them, how can the small packers hope
to compete?" Mr. Sims asked.
"They can't compete unless they get
cars, but there are enough .railroad
cars as a rule to take care of them,"
Mr. Armour replied.
In response to questions by Repre
sentative Esch of Wisconsin, Mr. Arm
our denied that ownership of stock
yards was used to manipulate prices
of cattle. He told Representative
Doremus of Michigan, that he did not
remember the details of his acquire
ment of the Union stockyards of Chi
cago, with F. H. Prince of Boston. He
asserted, however, that none of the
other packers was interested in the
yards, and that so far as he knew, MrJ
Prince held all the stock not owned
by Armour.
No expert advisers were furnished
the food administration by Armour &
Co.. the witness said, although sev
eral of their men became "dollar a
year" employes of other government
agencies. ,
As the committee adjourned for the
day. Chairman Sims told Mr. Armour
he, bad no complaint to make of his
demeanor as a witness and thanked
him for "answering right off," without
any attempt to "dodge."
"I have no desire to dodge," Mr.
Armour replied.

Polish Question Up
The Polish question will come up at
tomorrow's session as well as the mat
ter of Russia. It is understood in this
connection that President Wilson has
received information concerning the
spread of the bolsheviki movement in
Poland, where the bolsheviki army is
nearing Warsaw. It is expected that
proposals will be renewed for the al
lied armies to help the Polish army
with war material, but this has not
yet been decided. The nature of the
discussion was in determining the ap
pointment of two committees, the first
to deal with reparation for the dam
ages of the war, the second to deai
with the subject of the society of
nations.
Wilson Memorial on Peace
Another full session of the peace
conference will likely be held next
Friday or Saturday for the purpose of
the presentation of a memorial on the
league of nations by President Wilson.
The English and French memorials on
the league of nations will probably be
presented at the same time and the
committee proposed today will then
work out the details, while the full
conference may enunciate some gen

plan. 4

jail.
News of her exoneration was taken
to Madame Lebaudy by Mrs. Phineas
Seaman, matron of the jail, at . 3
o'clock, shortly after the grand jury
had reported "no indictment." Ma
dame Lebaudy, who paced her quar
ters in the jail nervously through
out the afternoon, fainted, but quickly
recovered. She was kneeling, with a
crucifix pressed to her breast, and of
fering a fervent prayer in French
when her attorney entered to confirm
Mrs. Seaman's reports.
"Thank God it's all over' she cried,
bursting into tears.
While the attorney went before Su
preme Court Justice Aspinall to ob
tain a written order for his client's
release, Jacqueline was summoned by
telephone from the home of Rev. Wil
liam F. McGinnis of Westbury, where
she hadj been staying since her moth

Before she left the jail, Madame
Lebaudy kissed Mrs. Seaman, shook
hands with the sheriff and other jail

be conveyed to the members of the
grand jury which had freed her.

IT?
y THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY, JANUARY 22, 1919,
THREE
GRADES ARE SET
FOR NEW PAVING
'As the result of the introduction
K( an ordinar.ee at the ' meeting of
the city council last night, embody
ing the result of the surveys made
recently by City Engineer Halleck,
the grades to -which paving- in Bisbee
Kill conform in case it is cecided that
it shall be done, were adopted. The
ordinance, after being read paragraph
by paragraph, was adopted unani
mously by the council as an emerg
ency measure and following legal pub
lication will become the law. Portions
of Xaco road, O K street, brewery
avenue. Subway alley and Main street
are included.
Following adoption of the ordinance
there was considerable discussion of
technicalities of paving. The -result
was that it became apparent that
under no circumstances can the
ordinance calling an election on the
bonds be prepared and passed by the
council before the second meeting in
February. Specifications 'as to width
of paving, height of curbs and other
matters pertaining to the purely phys
ical aspects of the question must be
prepared by the city engineer while
the finance committee of the council
in consultation with the city attorney
roust decide upon the denomination
pf the bonds rate of interest, the
term during which they will run and
other details connected with . the
financial end of the affair. All that
has been settled is that the paTtag
shall be laid according to certain
grades, while it is presumed that
about $150,000 will be required to do
the work. This is another detail to
be threshed out.
No decision was reached by the city
in the matter of purchasing a new
truck for city garbage collection. ,Two
bids were offered, that or T. Olsen for
a 2 14 -ton Mack tmk, $4442.30, and
the Bisbee Auto company for a Gar
ford truck, 2-fbn capacity, $4160, with
$25 additional for a driver's cab. Mr.
Olsen and Mr. Bowen spoke in behalf
of their trucks.
In the midst of the discussion an
apple of discord was tossed into the
assemblage by O. E. Franklin, who
submitted a blanket bid of $1285 per
month for collection and disposal of
rity garbage. As no bid had been
called for, Mr. Franklin's proposition
could not be accepted. However, its
submission opened as entirely new
field for discussion and it was de
cided to table the whole matter until
the next meeting of the council, the
first Tuesday in February. Between
now and then City Attorney Sam H.
Kyle and the street committee will
talk over the details of calling for
bids under set rules of collection
which probably would alter the entire
asnft nf fh affair A ft or Mr SVanK
Klin's Lid had been read. City Engineer)
K Halleck said he bad a verbal bid from
another man, whom he had told that
it was useless to appear at this time,
but the amount was almost identical
with that of Franklin's bid. It was
decided to table the matter of heavy j
truck purtha; until the next meet-)
ing. '.
Bids on a light truck for the use of
the city engineer were submitted.;
The Bisbee Auto company offered a ;
Maxwell truck to the c ity at S9S5 1
while Frank Bledsoe offered a Ford j
at $-322.25. The latter bi.l was ac-j
cepteJ and the Ford truck ord red ;
purchased. - j
When the question of arpointnient
of a committee to attend the j;ood
roads convention in Phoenix next i
Monday was broached by the maycr, i
J. J. Bowen was requested to explain
briefly to the council some of the
measures which would arise at that
time. This Mr. Bowen did. saying
the best read builders from the state
and the United States would be
present. He said the movement for a
state bond l3sue had the emire sup
port of the various counties and had
been inaugurated at the request of
President Wilson to take care of the
condition of unemployment sure to
arise otherwise, when large bodies of
soldiers are brought back from
France. He explained also in some
detail the federal aid proposal.
Dr. N". C- Bledsoe endorsed the
good roads movement ooth as a ben
eficial public work and as a method
of -taking care, of unemployed men.
Upon his motion the council em
powered the mayor to name the street
committee. Councilman Jovanovich,
Rosik and City Engineer Halleck to
go to the meeting with all expenses
paid. J. C. Ryan, county highway
engineer, was added to the commit
tee with the understanding that his
expenses were not to be paid by the
city, but that he was to be given cre
dentials as a member of the city's
delegation. A fifth member will be
named by the mayor.
The council instructed the city en
gineer to prepare plans and specifica
tions and proceed to carry out an
agreement between the council and
the school board two years ago that a
retaining wall should be built at the
high school.

Seeks Lost Bonds
(By Review Leased Wire
SOUTH BK.M. Iml. Jan. 21. All
efforts were concentrated tonight in
search for a clever thief who stole the
$2;.0.000 worth of Liberty bonds be
longing to the Studebaker corporation.
John N. Hunter, postal inspector, and
Henry J. Bridgeman. assistant cashier
of the First and Old Detroit National
bank, admitted today for the first
time that the disappearance of the
bonus was a theft.
The chief development in the inves
tigation today was the report of John
E. Ennis, a Chicago handwriting ex
pert, that he found the signatures on
all receipts for registered iSail pack
ages reported by the local postoffice
as delivered to the Studebaker offices
on January 4 to have been written by
the same person.
The registered mail received on
that date was signed for by Eddie
Snyder, the 15-year-old office boy who,
however, has convinced all concerned
that he knew nothing of the disappear
ance cf the bond.

San Carlos Dam
Permanent organization at Salt Lake City Monday, of a land settlement
congress for soldiers and sailors and marines, with Arizona represented on
the executive committee and among the permanent officers, opens a direct
channel through which the state may work for obtaining the San Carlos dam.
The fact that the secretary of the congress, Judge Otis J. Baughn, is a resi
dent of Florence, Pinal county, heart of the project, will not detract from
appeals for action.
Reports of the feasibility of the San Carlos project, government reports
on its costs and possibilities, were published in this column several days ago.
Now is an excellent time to press this wonderful project. The Review
believes that if commercial bodies throughout the state will co-operate in ac
tion in bringing the project to the attention of the proper authorities, the
year 1919 will see the San Carlos dam well on its way toward completion.
Action, and concerted action, is all that is necessary to realize thi3 gi
gantic irrigation system.
National Guard
Divisions Embark
For Home Ports
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, an. 21. The
homeward flow of American fighting
units which had the opportunity to
distinguish themselves, soon will be
gin. The war department announced to
day thaj three famous national guard
divisions the Twenty-seventh (New
York), Thirtieth (Wildcat) and the
Thirty-seventh (Buckeye) had been
ordered to prepare for embarkation.
There was no information as to when
the divisions would start from French
ports, but heretofore it has required
several weeks for units to embark
after being assigned to early convoy.
Divisions having a distinguished
fighting record and others having a
distinctive local identity in the United
States will be kept together after
their return from France until t'uey
can be paraded at home and receive
the welcome that the people are
anxious to bestow upon them. No def
inite plans as to the three divisions
now designated for early return has
been made here, but it is assumed at
the war department that the various
units of each diviskra will be sent
home close together so that it w ill be
no hardship upon the men who arrive
first to keep them organized until the
entire division can be paraded.
to wcrk before the end of the week.
The troubie arises out of the opera-j
lion of the 47-hour week, which has
just been granted. When the new I
hours came into operation the em-i
plovers decided that 47 hours meant j
47 hours work and withdrew certain
privileges that had been previously
allowed, such as ten minutes for re
freshments in the morning and a few-
minutes of the employers time for
men engaged in rough work to wash
their hands.

Densmore's Report'
At least a shread of encouragement in the belief of the disinterested
layman, in a possibility that Thomas J. Mooney may ha ve been persecuted
and "railroaded" lias slowly been building up throughout the United States.
Labor's consistent appeal in behalf of the condemned man, the disclosures
which have been made through labor's activities, the strong fight carried to
last "resources to save him from the gallows7eacbT hasaddedto the fund ot
facts at the layman's hands to increase his belief that Mooney may not be
Suilty. ' . i
New doubt arises now in the mind of the layman, with receipt of the re
port of the San Francisco grand jury, investigating reports of John B. Dens
mcre, director general of employmenL The grand jury report was made Mon
day. It stirs doubt in two directions: doubt of the good faith of certain labor
leaders cn the "inside "; and doubt that Mooney should receive clemency or
consideration for clemency.
Mr. Densmore, in his report , to the department of labor, made serious,
sweeping and incriminating charges of irregularities in the Mooney trial. His
report was given wide publicity by the department of labor and by news
papers throughout the nation.
Assuming there wa3 a basic element of fact and truth in the Densmore
report, a grand jury was called to investigate the charges of the report.
Mr. Densmore was subpoenaed to appear before the body. He refused.
Mr. Densmore was requested by the foreman of the grand jury to return
to San Francisco and assist in an investigaticn. He refused. t
The department of labor was requested to send Mr. Densmore to San
Francisco. The department refused.
So the grand jury which had been called to assist labor in its fight to free
Mooney, which had been called at the behest of an agent of the department
of justice, was forced to cease functioning from a lack of co-operation.
Here is the report of the grand jury on adjourning:
"Our investigations led us to believe that the report 'is at least inac
curate in many important details. Conversations or purported conversations
have apparently been distorted and garbled. Facts have been misstated and
circumstances misconstrued. . '
"The grand jury of the city and county of San Francisco therefore begs
to report that it can find no evidence tending to show either misconduct in
officer or malfeasance in office or the commission of any crime on the part
of the district attorney of his assistants.
"The Densmore report remains an unconfirmed and unsubstantiated
document. f
"It is to be regretted that any official of the United States government
would be permitted to come to San Francisco, or any other city, and give
publicity to a report reflecting not alone on the officials, but upon the mor
ality and integrity of the community and then deliberately fail to assist In
substantiating the charges and refuse to support them.
"This grand jury lias found itself in the peculiar position of being op
posed and hampered and blocked in its efforts by officials of the government
and more particularly by the very officials who made and gave publicity
to the charges."

LEM BERG BESIEGED BY
UKRAINIAN-; FIGHTING HEAVY
Land for the Soldiers
Settling the returned U. S. soldiers on the land is not altogether unlike
the enumeration of chickens before the eggs are hatched. It depends largely
on what the soldiers think about it when they get back. But the idea at
least has produced some great mathematical additions of available acres.
Between Washington and New Orleans there are 40,000,000 acres of unused
land. In the U. S. as a whole there are some 0,000,000 acres of land, some
of it swamp and some of it subject to periodical overflowing, that could not
be drained and reclaimed. In the west there are about 80,000,000 acres or
arid land that could be irrigated. ' '
All told there are about 228,000,000 acres of territory, most of it east of
the Mississippi, which has been stripped of its forest growth by lumbering
operations, and could be either re-forested or used for f aiming. There is evi
dently plenty of land for the soldiers; and it will be a fine thing for every
body if it turns out that there are soldiers enough for the land to add. some
millions of these new unproductive acres to the nation's agricultural wealth.
ROCK ISLAND, 111., Jan. 21. By
shooting John Sexton, a turnkey, and
overpowering two guards, between 20
and 25 persons escaped from the coun
ty jail tonight. Sexton's wound is
slight. Fourteen of the men who es
caped are convicts from the Joliet
penitentiary, who, until recently, have
been paroled and working at the Uni
ted States arsenal here. They were
taken into custody several days ago
for violation of their parole.
Tonight's jail delivery followed an
unsuccessful attempt of a number ofi
prisoners to escape tnree weeKs ago ;
and is the culmination of a wave of i
crime wnicn nas swept tne city anu
vicinity for six weeks. Six hundred
paroled convicts from the Joliet peni
tentiary had been employed in Rock
Island manufacturing plants until the
murder of Sheriff Jacob Wigers by
automobile bandits nearly two months
ago, when a majority of the convicts
were returned to prison.
Among the criminals who escaped
from jail tonight is Arthur Miller, alias
James Ellsworth, confessed murdered
of Jake Schaul, a Rock Island business
man.
According to reports received by
Sheriff Miller, shortly before midnight,
the escaped prisoners stele three auto
mobiles after fleeing from .jail and
are i believed to have started for Chi
cago. An unverified report received
here, stated that seven of them had
been captured a short distance east
of iiere. The convicts are said to in
clude murderers, hold-up men and
burglars, a majority of them from
Chicago.

THOUSANDS JOBLESS
SAYS LABOR SECRETARY
WASHINGTON, Jan. 21. Reports
from 21 cities, showing more than
135,000 unemployed, were submitted
to the house immigration committee
today by Frank Morrison, secretary
of the American Federation of Labor,
in support of his contention that
"there will be bread lines in every
industrial center before May 1."
Mr. Morrison appeared in support of
legislation to restrict immigration.
The reports submitted today, were
thnsA from thirty cities
given to the committee last Thursday j g
by Mr. Morrison and snowed ueirou
with 50.000 unemployed; Philadelphia j
with 10.000; Indianapolis, S000; i
Bridgeport. Conn., 15.000; Charleston,
000: San Francisco, 15,000; Tacoma

Falls, Mont.. 1000; Akron, O., 2o00;
Schnectady, N. Y., S500 and Pittsburg,
10.000.
A report from Seattle, Wash., said
it was impossible to give the approxi
mate number of unemployed there, but
that there were thousands, and that
the number was increasing daily. The
situation was becoming so menacing,
it was stated, that government inter
vention might soon be necessary.
Mr. Morrison told the committee
that further proof is being obtained
daily of the increasing extent of un
employment and that action must be
taken immediately if serious labor
troubles are to be avoided. He said
that two things should be done by con
gress, first, that legislation providing
for the employment of returning sol
diers be passed, and. second, that im
migration be stopped until normal
times are again reached.
Mr. Morrison said that only two
cities Toledo and Youngstonn, Ohio
ot the 30 mentioned by him last
week, as having larga numbers of un
employed, have denied that such con
ditions exist.

Bainbridge Gains Twenty
Pounds Taking Tanlac
Troubles Ended
"My old time energy with 20 pounds
of my lost .weight have been returned
to me by the use of Tanlac," said C. E.
BainDndge, the well known contract
ing painter, decorator and wall paper
man ot 89 East Eleventh street, Port
land, in an interview, recently.
'"Just about a year ago," said Mr.
Bainbridge, in describing his case, "I
lost my appetite and soon got to where
uo thing 1 would eat agreed with me.
My food would lay in my stomach
and ferment, bloat me up as tight as a
arum and cause me to suffer agony.
Of course I had to live on a very lignt
diet and not being able to get the
proper nourishment 1 lost weight and
strength continually. I dropped down
from 165 pounds to . 132 losing 33
pounds in just a few months. I final
ly got so weak and run-down I had to
give up my work and was laid up for
more than five weeks. Then I began
suffering with rheumatism all over,
which was especially bad in my right
arm. The muscles in this arm would
become so drawn and painful that I
could not get my hand to my head. My
back also hurt me all the time. I was
haoltually constipated and had such
terrific headaches that I could hardly
see. 1 was so nervous the least noise
would upset me and I have gone
through many a night never closing
my eyes for sleep. My strength and
energy had just about all left me and
my condition had become alarming to
me. In fact, I had become discour
aged, as I had taken so much medi
cine without getting any relief.
"Finally a friend of mine, knowing
the fix I was in advised me to try
Tanlac, saying his wife had been in
the same condition and that six bot
tles of Tanlac restored her entirely.
So after he told me this I lost very
little time in getting me some Tan
lac, and believe me, it has done the
work. After taking the first bottle I
was simply eating like a bear and I
have been eating just anything I want
since that time with no signs of bloat
ing or any other discomfort after
wards. I have just finished my fourth
bottle and now the rheumatism is
gone tdo. With the aid of Tanlac Tab
lets I 'have been relieved of constipa
tion and, it's a fact, I haven't had a
headache since I began taking Tanlac.
I simply sleep like a log every night
and can do a full day's work and still
feel fresh and fine at night. My wife
also suffered from indigestion and she
has gotten entirely rid of it by using
Tanlac. I tell you it's great and peo
ple with stomach trouble and rheum
atism will do well to take it."

ixLVv YORK, Jan. 21. The con
spicuous teature of today's broad
stock market was the determined and
partly successfull effort of bear trad
ers to extend their advantage of re
cent dajs, in which they were aided
by the pessimistic views attributed to.
industrial leaders and railroad execu

pivot around which the market re
voked and it is likly to retain this
position for another week, when its

a net gain of a large fraction.
Some prominent rails suffered in
the early reversal, representative
issues reaching 1 to 2 points and sec
ondary shares 1 to 4 points. High
grade rails rallied substantially later,
but St. Paul. Baltimore & Ohio, New

Sales amounted to 650,000 shares.
Bonds moved with the stock list,
speculative issues recording addition

on corn. The close was strong.

Oats gained Vi to lc to lHc. Provi

75c decline to 25c advance.
Corn broke sharply at the start, but
soon began to advance, and through
out the rest of the day ascended with
out any. serious setbacks. The tempo-!
rary initial setback was ascribed to,
agitation for a lower living cost.!
Bearish sentiment, however, appeared
to operate under the influence of
gossip that during February the exist
ing hog price would remain un
changed. In this connection, buying j
showed much greater impetus after
definite announcement that a spokes
man cf the food administration had
said an abandonment of the price
policy of hogs would not be recom
mended at the meeting of the hog

A NERVOUS WRECK
From Three Years' Suffering. Sayt
CardaiMade Her Well.
Texas Oty, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Mrs. G. H. Schil!, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable fb
do any of my work.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache sine
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troubles made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
in medical books as being of benefit in
female troubles, and 40 years of use has
proven that the bocks are right Begin
talcing Cardui today. NC-I34

j FACES SERIOUS CHARGE.
' Preliminary hearing "will be held
this morning at 10 o'clock by Justice
j of the Peace James Allison in the
I case of Roman Hernandez, a Mexican,
! charged with failure to support his
girl wife. Carmen M. Hernandez, aged
j 17. The young wife is in a delicate
condition and unable to support her
self and the husband is alleged in the
charge to be attempting to evade his
duty as a husband and prospective
father. This if proven, constitutes a
felony under the Arizona statutes.
A most amusing comedy-drama is
contained in the five reels of "Money
Isn't Everything," starring Margarita
Fisher at the Eagle theater today.
Franklin Smith, an impecunious law
yer, scents big money when a dainty
little client calls upon him for advice,
but on discovering that her entire
capital consists of $7 he immediately
suggests a partnership in a "Beauty-To-Let
Corporation" which shall at
once start operations with a view to
capitalizing his client's facial attrac
tiveness. Throughout the story there is a
judicious admixture of drama and just
a little pathos, but the main theme :s
pure unadulterated comedy of the best
American type. This story couldn't
happen anywhere but in the United
States the entire scheme is typical of
American initiative and hustle and of
course, as in all such narratives, the
colors are laid on with a heavy brush
in parts. But that only makes it an
the more laugable and enjoyable.

NEW COUNTY BUILDING
TO BE FURNISHED IN
SUBSTANTIAL MANNER
Instructions were issued by I. C. K.
Adams, chairman of the board of sup-
. . . . F , w i 1 1 i v v i .a
'James Allison of this city, to select
substantial furniture of the better
grade for the justice court room in
the new city-county building on Naco
road, and when the building was ready
to see that it was installed. The
furniture will include a typewriter, for
use of the justice of the pace.
"The supervisors do not believe in
squandering money, but neither do we
think it effects any saving to buv
cheap, snide furniture," said Mr. Ad
ams, in issuing tJie instructions to
Judge Allison. "I believe as a gen
eral principle, that the man who will
use the furniture will be better fitted
to chocse it than another. We have
a good building here in Irisbee, and
it should be well furnished."
The court room in the new building
will be ready for occupancy in about
a month. Judge Allison then will
move from the city hall, where he now
holds ccurt in the council chamber,
into it.

CAMPBELLS RETURN TO
BISBEE FROM FRANCE
James W. Campbell. Hq. Co. 126th
F. A., and William A. Campbell, Bat.
A, 125th P. A., arrived in JSisbee yes
terday after having been honorably
discharged from the service. They
soon will resume their places in the
civil life of the community.
Going from Bisbee to Camp Cody,
near Deming, N. Mex., they were as
signed to the regiment,, formerly the
First Iowa artillery. After training for
a few weeks in Cody, the 34th division
of which this was a part, left for the
east and embarked late in September
for France. It was good fortune and
nothing more which brought the two
Campbell boys back to Bisbee. Had
they been on the transport Otranto in
stead of the Kashmir, they very prob
ably would have been drowned in the
disaster -which overtook the Otranto
off the Isle of Islay in the Irish sea,
October 6. The Kashmir in the heavy
storm and "fog plowed into the side of
the Otranto and then was forced to
veer off leaving the other transport in
a sinking condition. The Campbell
boys never were able to learn just
what organizations were on the Otran
to. They saw a cruiser go through the
fog and take off some of the men from
the sinking vessel, but the greater
part of the rescue and - subsequent
sinking cf the Otranto could not be
seen because of weather conditions.
Their regiment was stationed in
France about 40 miles behind the front
but never participated in the fighting.
Although both the young men bear the
same name, thev are no relation
James W. Campbell was saddened by
tne aeatn or nw brother, Floyd Camp
bell, a member of the 8th -Machine Gun
battalion, killed in action last summer.

much of his time communing with na
ture, therefore be it
Resolved, That all Scouts have suf
fered a loss at his death, and that we,
of Troop No. 2, do pause to pay our
tribute of respect to him, and be it
further
Resolved, That a copy of these
resolutions e given to each of the
daily papers of this city, and a copy
be placed on our records.
