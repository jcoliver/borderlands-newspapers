Garfield and McAdoo Con-
fer. Prediction Made That'
Heatless Mondays Will Not
Be Carried Through.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 1. Abandon
ment of the heatless Monday program
after its enforcement next Monday was
predicted tonight at the close of a pro
longed conference between Fuel Ad
ministrator Garfield and Director Gen
eral McAdoo.
A final decision was not reached. (
further conference will be neict t
Tuesdav.'but there was every indica- j
tion that both officials, as well as !
President Wilson, who has been con- J
suited, feel that the purpose sought
can be accomplished from now on by
continuance of preferential coal trans
portation and distribution and by rail
road embargoes now in force.
At the conclusion of the conference,
tonight the following statement was
issued jointly by Dr. Garfield and Mr.
McAdoo:
Joint Statement Made
We have had under consideration
the question of suspending after Mon- j
day next the Monday closing order.
We have not reached a final conclu
sion about it. We shall have another
conference on Tuesday next, when the
results of the Monday closings and
cf the lailroad embargoes up to that
nine can be fuliy considered, and shall
be able to make an announcement
ticxt week as to whether or not a sus
ensioii of the Mondv closing order
nay be made."

by the fuel administration January 17 i and must reach elevators quickly. Af
as a measure to save coal and to re-iter conferring today with a delegation
lieve railroad transportation. Next!"1
Monday will be the third observed.
The Monday holidays were preceded
by a five-day industrial shutdown at
the close of which eastern railroads
at the oirection of Director General
McAdoo put on embargoes against the
movement of general freight.
Monday Closing Opposed
The Monday closing has brought
about the most vigorous opposition
from commercial interests, particular
ly the tig department stores. The
small stores, too. have opposed it. as
-have the owners of office buildings.
Theatres succeeded in having the day
as r.pplit-d to tv'em changed,to Tues
day. It was ttated officially tonight that
the reason a final decision was cot
reached was because complete reports
have not as yet been received show
ing the exact results of the five days'
closing and the effects of operation of
the embargoes to date. Both Mr. Mc
Adoo and Dr. Garfield are or the opin
ion, however, it was said, that since
the coal problem is largely one of
transportation, embargoes will brlnr
results without continuance of the
Monday closings. Nine days' enforce
ment of the embargoes, it is held, has
improved tne situation as mucn as:ments of food for th Mies to 11
would have an observance of nine ,
heatless Mondays, although had weath

fuel administration's preferential or
der calling for the distribution of coal
first to householders, ships, public in
stitutions and favored war industries,
will stand, as well as will the railroad
administration's order giving prefer
ential rail movement to coal and fod.
These two orders, it is declared, will
guarantee cor I to consumers which
the government is determined to see
supplied, although the less essential
industries are expected to suffer and
some may have to close.

Empties Are
Huiried West
To Save Foods
tBy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 1. Fearing se-
Hoods in the middle west and
south within a few days, the govern-
ment railroad administration today
rushed empty cars westward from the
eastern congestion area to provide for
an emergency movement of corn to el
evators, and cotton to southern sea
ports for trans-shipment to New Eng
land mills, engaged on government or
ders. Owing to the absence of new snod
and the steady work of clearing tracks
of accumulated snow, the movement
f . Kiihtiv better todav and
otficiai8 predicted slight improvement
for the next few days.
The danger of floods loomed large,
however, with forecasts of warmer
weather tomorrow for the middle west!
and the gradual eastward movement
of the thawing area. The Ohio river
is n earing a serious flood stage, and
other streams in the middle west and
are still rising.
To Move Corn
Special efforts are to be made to
transport corn, much of which is soft

ficials arranged to dispatch a number
of empt) cars to those states tomor
row to carry corn to St. Louis. Chica
go and ether terminals. From the corn
territory west of the Mississippi, the
movement of corn eastward continued.
And Cotton
From St. Louis. Memphis and other
points where theer are large accumu
lations of cotton awaiting shipment to
market, between 50.000 and 100.000
bales will move to south Atlantic and
gull ports within the next week on or

sued today to C. H. Markham. region
al director for the south.
The action was taken after a confer
ence between Mr. McAdoo and repre
sentatives of the National Association
of Cotton Manufacturers and New Eng
land commercial interests who ex
plained that many cotton mills have
closed because they could not get suf
ficient raw material.
The shipping board also has agreed
Mr. McAdoo announced, to furnish ad
ditional vessels to carry cotton no-v
accumulated at Calveston. New Or

Satisfactory progress was reported
today in the movement of export ship-
nnrtc to which thev were diverted

was better than yesterday, and prom
ised to improve further tomorrow.

El'ENuS A1KKS, feu. 1. 'tne min
ister oi war has recalled Argentine's
military ataches from Berlin and Vien
na. In political circles this action is
regarded as significant and connected
with te sinking of the Argentine
steamship .Ministro Irriendo, ou Jan

The Argentine minister to France

ship was Hying the Argentine flag

announced by what authority the
change of flags was made after leav
ing this country the vessel having
sailed under the Frenca flag out re
gards thi sinking as unfriendly act
even though the use of the home fag
was unauthorized. The assumption
in political circles here is that Germa
ny does not intend to keep her prom
ises in regard to Argentine's shipping.
Situation Tense
The situation here is tense and thejmanian tore who were sent there
authorities are maintaining more than
heir usual silence on the subject, but
evcral .events at the government
house late today lead to the belief that
the government at last is preparing
to take an important step. After an
unusually long lapse of time, the for
eign office nxi:.y replied to the notes
of Peru and Uruguay, which notified
Argentina of their rupture of relations
with Germany, and that of Brazil in
forming Argentina of her sister coun
try's state of war with the central pow
ers.
Argentina, in the three notes sent in
reply, expressed her approbation and
warmest sympathy with the three oth
er South American countries. The
note to Brazil which was the most sig
nificant, says that the Argentine gov
ernment has followed all the phases
cf the causes which led to "this just
resolution." and closes with an ex-
I pression of homage to the Brazilian
nation.
These notes and the simultaneous
recall of the military attaches from
Berlin and Vienna are regarded as in
dicating that the country is verging
on a crisis in its international relation
It also was announced today that an
army officer, who has been acting as
correspondent in eBrlin for La Nacion

J In Germany, although ar-parently

Newspapers Fail
The failure of German newspaper
to arrive at the usual ieutral points
from which nes of conditions in Ger
many is disseminated leaves a veil
of uncertainty over the exact states
of affairs there. Such advices as hav
come through, however, tend to indi
cate that the strike movement reach
ed its greatest heish and now is in
the process of dwindling. This fact
is ascribed to the seeming lukewarm
nes of the labor leaders toward the
movement and also, and in great part,
to the strong repressive measures
adopted by the government.

Effect on England j
As experts these men were invited
to reply to three Questions: First J
What would be the effect on Kns'.and ;
of unrestricted sjbmaiine war Sec-1
end What would be the effect on Ger- !
Kiar.y's relations with the I'r.i'ed ;
States and other neutrals, and th:id
To what esteut did the internal sitjj-j
tion of Germany demand the use of '
ta? drastic weapon?
Alt the experts on the first point j
that E.ig'.and would have to sue for 1
peace in six months at most. Ilei.'..
Mailer said England's supply of iwii
Ftuffs was smaller than ia peace lime.i
and therefore a ruthless lMoal war
would probably accomplish the pur
pose in three months.
Jr. Salcmoi-schn asserted that Eng
land's pcsiticn was very vulnerable
owing to her dependence on foreign
capital and the absence of a spirit !
se:f sacriiice among the English peo
ple. He therefore thought six mo:;-lis
vas an excessive estimate.
Pr. Spn'ngorom said:
"Everything depends on the cutting
off of supplies from Great Uritui:
(,'aickiy and thoroughly."
On the second question, Keir Keuch
said :
"The neutrals despise our restrict
ed submarine warfare. Every ship in
I'ritish waters, enemy or neutral,
should be torpedoed without warning
The world only respects those ii ri
a great crisis know how to make ;ae
most unscrupulous use of their power.
Germanv's position ia the world nif.r j
ket after the war will be all'the stro i
r for her having .convinced the world
er for ber having convinced the worl
of her power."
Herr Schmidt said:
"I have no fears about America. "
On the second question. Herr M iller
said : -
"Unrestricted submarine warfare
w ill cause the wholesale fiieht of neu
trals from the war zone. Their news
papers will abase Germany, but thy ;
will soon tire. The chief danger is the
I'nited Slates, but that danger will e
less in proportion as Germany "per
ates decisively and ruthlessly.
Not Worth 'Considering
"Eirer feeling in the IniteJ S.ates
after the war is cot worth considering
i iuse if Germr.r.y scceetis she can
dictate terms to assure favored rrent-.
nieni for herseif. If. on the ot herT.tr.;!
Cermany throws away this opportuni
ty, the passive approval of the Ceiled
States will te cf saiaH practical value"
lr. Salomonsohn said on the second .
"I recognize the possibility of a war
with th Vnited States, but I am loath
to throw awav so desi'-aMe a wea-jou !
cn this account. As a banker I realise
how disastrous America's tn'ry into
the wir would be. bat I insist tr.s a

Although the experts differed as to
the prospect of war with the I'nited
States, none of them advised again.,
the C-boat war on that account.
Effect in Germany
Oa the third question all the experts
agreed that the internal situation de
manded a drastic remedy. Herr Zuck
schwert said:
"The most drastic measures are ad
visable owing to the feeling of the
nation. The nation will stand by the
government but not if it yields to the
threats from America. Such weak
ness would tend to serious consequenc
es." "It is quite possible that Germany
will be unable to hold out." said Hen
Schmidt. "More drastic steps should
be taken before disorder and unrest
arise in the agriculture districts. Each
day's delay means trouble."
Herr Engelhard gave his opinion as
.
".A",
few weeks' delay may render ev
en unrestricted wariare arane oi
good results."
Herr von Finck said:
"A great mass of our people are at
the end of their resources."

Sir Eric Geddes
Tells Reporter
J lOontinuvU from eagf Onei
the fact mat the sinking of niercnaui
j !-!:ips now had be.n reduced to a level
!lorr ..".an belore Germany cast aside
' '1 rvstraini.
' "I c'it at: cptiir.i.n regarding the V-
boai -aariare." sv.id Sir Eric. "Ti.e
subn.ar'ne. re.-trained and unrestrain
ed, has been met and has not proveu
iuviuiibie. 1 am inclined to think
that now. since I made my last public
tatemeut 'we are sinking submarines '
as last as Germnay can ouna mem
My 'curves' are all good, and I cannot
foresee any way in which the situa
tion can be changed except for tne
better.
Sooner the Better
'The soonor the better is now the
"The sooner tfce better is now tbe
allied navy's aim. Hut you see there
is st.il a but. and it is a very impor
tant one we must nave more ships
if we are able to turn this German
failure into a positive allied victor'.
The submarine destruction of the
woriJ's tonnase h. not a big percent
age of the whole, but the submarine
of ships, and meantime the demands j
f in,.,n h.- i,n
and bounds.
"America's participation in the war
must inevitably liiade laige demands
i.n '-terc! ant shipping. Yet we must
continue al the same time to keep up
vi'.h the demands of the allied armies
and with the vital necessities of the
European civil population.
"'Ships, anl yet more sliips." is still
t!ie most important corollary of the
war. How far can we rely on Ameri
can effort for these ships? I have no
doubt ilie I'uited States will do it
inmost, but 1 want to urge again tae
vital importance of its merchant ship
ping program.
"When we firs' asked the United
States for ships there was a quick re
sponse. In no way can the I'si'.ea
States help more than in building
ships. Is she succeeding? Is she
throwing her best brains and great en
ergies into it? It is a worthy contri
bution to our great cause. I hope
she is.
Britain Not Idle
"Mesnwhile we shall not be idle.
Great Britain is straining every re
source to launch every ton of which
she is capable. We aire at the present
moniert building merchant ships at a
higher rate than ever before in our
record before tbe war. and before 191S
is over we shall be building shipping
I' f ail kinds at a rate more than double
that record year. But a great real de
pends on American effort, and I should
greatly regret if anvthine I mitrht sjtxi
regarding the failure of the German
subn ariiie warfare should be con-1
strued as minimizing the need for
M.ips. ana yet more ships.

Policy of Secrecy.
The subject of disaster to Gernnn
submarines led Sir Eric to the de
fensive of the Hritisci polity of entire
se- rt cy since the sinking of I'-boats.
"Our policy of secrecy." he a:iid

"The German sailors morale fail, known citizens in the state. H-" is
under the acid test of tats on re-;
seated exnerience of suspense. Oace
ar twice this failing in morale has
come to the surface in strikes or
mutinies. Hot more often it is only
evidenced by certain reluctan.e and
timorousness and generally lowered ;
efficiency.
"Even commanders of I'-boats are
net what ttey used to be. There still
are brave and capable men among j
them, asthere still are keen and dar-j
ing crews; but they are the exception.
The average submarine is in no way

.There was a very much surprised
man in the sheriffs office in Tomb-t-tone
Thursday evening in the person
of Under Sheriff Guy Welch when he
looked up and saw coming in the door
way the person of Barney Bono. Bar
ney, it will be remembered, in De
cember was convicted of the crime
of transporting intoxicating liquor and
had at two-year suspended sentence
standing over him and was taken to j
the road camp. He had a little store j
at Gleeson and was allowed by the
court to go with an officer to fix up
his business and then come in and ,
to to the road camp to work out hti
time He went to Gleeson and sold
ut his business and was to come bacV
into town that nighL While the o:"ti
cer was eating his supper Barney
made his way out the back dor left
about six weeks. j
When be came into the office he'
stated tbat he had come back to serve
his time; that Sheriff Wheeler and his i
deputies had always done the riht
thing by him. and he felt that he was
cot doing right by staring away and
making the officer feel bad over his
getting away; that be was willing u
so out on the road and work out his
time and when completed again be
come a resident o the county. He
stated that he had teen in New Mex
ico most of the time and that his con
science troubled him all the time that
he was away. Feeling that he had
not done right, so he came back.
He will now have to serve out his
two-year suspended sentence on the
county highway between here and
Tombstone.

Two great Uerman Tictories may be recorded for the
week: The air raid upon London and the air raid upon
Paris. Orer a hundred men. women and children were
killed in the two raids and several residences were de
stroyed.
Hun forces hare been obliged to sire ground to the
.Italians in the Brent Rer Region in Northern Italy.
It may appear to the casual obserrer that the Germans
are taking their legions back to the western front for
that super effort.
There are infallible indications that the German troops
hare been mainly withdrawn from the Italian front. The
Austrians are going it alone again. And as a result
the forward movement towards Venice has become a
retrograde movement towards Vienna. Germany wfl!
evidently stake all upon a grand offensive in the west
and. failing is this, she will begin at once to cry in
earnest for peace.
, In his recent address to the farmers of Illinois Pres
ident Wilson reiterated more strongly than ever this
country's adamant resolution to fight this war to a bit
ter and decisive finish. And the Trotzkys can betray
and the pacifists rave and the alien enemies on our
shores hamper, harass and hold back but the nation as
a whole will press on until its work is done.
John Reed, newspaperman and socialist (mostly the
latter) has been appointed Russian consul general in
New York by the BolsherikI regime. Reed, it is an
nounced, will leave for home during the next few days
from Petrograd where he has been advising Lenine and
Trotxky. Reed also stated, in a Petrograd dispatch, that
he would return to face an indictment charging him
with attempting to obstruct the draft. His arrival and
subsequent activities wiH be watched with interest. A
a Russian consul, will he be immune from prosecution?
Will he be able to carry on his nefarious pacifist pro
paganda under the cover of a Bolsheriki office? Mr
Reed will be watched, undoubtedly, and his work wilt
be gauzed. according to the fairminded principles of the
people of a real democracy.

The only way. then, in which the value of the copper
product of Arizona this year can equal that of last year
is by making the total output greater than that of 1917.
It must offset the difference between cent copper
and 30 cent copper for a part of the year.
On the other hand, there will be the advantage that
the mines this year will be operating at full capacity dur

such as the closed shop. They should present nothing

In spite of the apparent spirit of hostility toward the
big mining companies af Arizona, exhibited by some of
ficials of the department of labor, and in spite, of a similar
spirit shown by officials of the American Federation of
Labor, there is reason to believe that the miners will
receive every consideration from the companies and that

"We're just starting," is the Socialist slogan in their
propagandas and activities in the various warring na
tions of the world. That is the trouble with the so
cialist; no matter how far he goes, he only is just start
ing. Xo half way ground for him; no happy medium.
He is a radical by doctrine and an extremist by nature
and heredity. He may do good; often does. He may
have principles that are rishteous If for no other rea
son, that they help the workingman and his condition.
But any good he does in the beginning is more than
oftset by the harm he does in the end- He always runs
amuck, does the socialist. Give him an inch and he
wants a mile. Some men will take a piece of rope ana
anchor the sh.p of fortune to their wharf, but the so
cialist winds up, figuratively speaking, and occasionally
in a literal way. by hanging himself with his rope.
SENATOR STONE HEARS FROM HOME.
Senator Wi"iam J. Stone of Missouri, chairman of the
foreign relations committee, was vigorously denounced
for his recent -partisan speech in the senate In re solo-
tions unanimously adopted at a special meeting of the
St. Louis County Democratic central committee the
other day. The resolution "apologizes to the nation" for
Stone's undiplomatic, indiscreet and government-weakening
address and praises the Republican party and press
for their local support of the administration's war plans.
The resolution will be sent to Washington with the
request that it be written into the Congressional Record
The meeting was called by Chairman John E. Mooney
for the purpose of denouncing the speech. The resolu
tion states that Senator Stone does not represent the
views of the seventy-six thousand Democrats of the
county and that they want to "apologize for his actions."
The resolution says in part:
"Whereas. We deplore the fact that William J. Stone,
one of Missouri's failed1 States senators, has seea
fit to become a party 'o this undiplomatic, indiscreet
and government-weakeninz policy by injecting politic
at this time, it is the desire of the seventy-six thousand
Democrats of St. Iuis county to apologize for his ac
tion and further declare to the nation that he is not rep

our congratulations to the Republican party and the "ite
