Y REVIEW
NEW YORK, Dee.19. N'o new de
Telopments or problems presented
themselves for serious consideration
today, but the stork market continued
to decline, an imposing array of Issues
falling to new minimums.
Prices seemed to recede from sheer
Inertia more than from any other rea
son. Support, save in isolated rases
and at intervals, was wholly lacking,
gilt-edge Issues yieldin'more easily
than those of less value.
The supplementary list of fresh low
records, both for stocks and bonds.
Included such former prime favorites
as New York Central. Pennsylvania.
Atchison. Great Northern. Louisvilld
nnd Nashville and Baltimore and
Ohio.
In these stocks extreme losses ex
tended from 2 to 4 points, while
among the bonded obligations of the
same properties the hrinkage ran
from 1 to 2 per cent. United King
dom 5's were weakest of the interna
tional group, other foreign issues also
yielding.
Stocks were lower on the enlarged
offerings of the last hour, leaders los
ing 2 to 5 points. United States Steel
made an extreme reverse of 24 to
S0 and Union Pacific 3Ti to 102.
Sales amounted to 460.000 shares.
Liberty bonds were beavy at 97.13
to 97. the being more steady at
9S.50 to 98.40. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $4,530,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Dec. 19. Both com and
oats today surpassed all high-price
records this season. Disappointing
smaJlness of receipts was largely re
sponsible. Com closed firm at to
l&c net advance, wi'h January
U to $1.21. and May $1.19V
Oats gained i to "e to 2S,c. and
provisions 45c to fl.
Arrivals of grain were uncomfort
ably meager. One reason ascribed
was a dearth of sufficient motive pow
er, and it was said that many engines
had been diverted from the corn belt.
The resulting advance in the price of
corn was upheld, owing more or less
to prevailing warmth and moisture
that greatly hindered tbe safe hand
ling of poorer qualities of the cereal.
Strength in oats came in consider
able measure from reports that the
government had been a free buyer
during the last few days.
Curtailment of the hog supplv here
lifted provisions.

FUNERAL OF GOTCH
C H A M P 1 9NWRESTLER
Last Rites Said Over Body of
Man Who Once Had the
Wcrld at His Feet In the
Game of Wrestling.
(By Review Leased Wire)
HUMBOLDT. It- Dec. 19. Marked
by the simplicity he had requested,
funeral services were held late today
for Frank A. Goteh. retired world's
champion wrestler, who died at
home here last Sunday.
Business was suspended for two
hours in the afternoon and virtually
the entire city joined with the hun
dreds of persons from out of town in
paying tribute to the memory of the
premier matman.
Hardlymore than 600 persons were
able to crowd into the Congregational
church during the services there, but
nearly 1200 others, who had remained
outside, viewed tbe body at the con
clusion of the services. .
Gov. W. L. Harding, speaking at
the church, praised tbe man he had
known for years as a personal friend,
and pointed to Gotch's life as an ex
ample for the coming generation in
"right living and clean sportsman
ship." Numerous automobiles and car
riages, in addition to hundreds of pe
destrians, joined in the procession to
Union cemetery, where interment
took place after brief Masonic rites.
The procession was more than a mile
and a half long, extending virtually
from the church to the cemetery.
The Rev. Alexander Bennett, a
Methodist minister of Salina. Kas..
formerly pastor here and an intimate
friend of Gotch. had charge of the
j religious sen ices at the church, as
sisted by three other clergy men.
PACKING INDUSTRY

Federal Trade Commission

( By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 19. The pack

searchlight of the federal trade com
mission's investigative powers at
open hearings beginning tomorrow.
Uniess they come of their own voli

five great packing families jirlll not

to the possibility of giving immunity

future prosecutions might be based.
T!ie specific question at issue will
be the ownership of the Chicago stock
yards and the Chicago terminal rail
road. The National Cattlemen's asso

WASHINGTON. Dec. 19. Com
plaints that American ship captains
have not co-f.pertted with comman
ders of convoy and with naval gun
crew commanders caused the depart
ment of commerce to issue instruc
tions today to merchant officers to
follow the directions of their naval
associates in every Instance where
they are prompted by military neces
sity. Disobedience of the instructions,
it is pointed out. will' cause the wlth
drawal of merchant officers licenses.
Attention is called to the need for the
strictest discipline in war time and to
the necessity of enforcing particularly
sobriety among the men.
Ships Endangered
The navy's recent Insistence on
manning all merchant ships with
naval reserves grew out of an alleged
lack of co-operation by merchant cap
tains and an absence of discipline
among merchant crews. Seamen, the
navy contended, were permitted to
come aboard ships in foreign ports
drunk, endangering the ships on their
return through the submarine zone.
An arrangement now has been
reached between the navy and the
shipping board providing for manning
by the navy of all transports, all ships
carrying supplies for the army and
the navy and all vessels carrying
whole cargoes of ammunitions. Op
eration by merchant crews is left to
passenger ships and to vessels carry
ing part munitions and all other car
goes.
Question to Be Aired
The whole controversy as to opera'
tion of merchant ships is expected to
be aired at the senate investigation
of the shipping board to start later
in the week, as well as before the
senate military committee, where
Major General Sharpe. quartermaster
eeneral of the army, will discuss his
recommendations that the crews of
all army ships be brought into the
i military service.

.-, a VIOLENCE IN ARIZONA.
Incendiaries, in the Salt RiTer Valley during the last
few months, have caused the destruction of thousands
of tons of food and stock feed. The people of Maricopa
county, backed by Governor Campbell and Attorney Gen
eral Wiley E. Jones, have joined in a determined drive
to rid the region of the cause. Maricopa county, during
the last eleven and a half months, has been visited by
the largest number of mrrders 1b any like period. This
is true of Cochise, Santa Crur, Yavapai and other sub
divisions of the state.
It would appear that Arizona is indulging In a carni
val of crime. Unlike most epidemics of a similar nature,
there is only one citable cause for any of the action, and
that applies alone to the incendiarism In and around
Phoenix.
The frequency with which fire has visited different
parts of the Salt River Valley, consuming cotton, alfalfa,
beans and other foodstuffs, for man and animal, has led
the authorities to tbe conclusion that gents of the
enemy are at work. Attorney General Wiley E. Jones,
in discussing the matter, advises that the actions are
not simple transgressions of the statutes against arson,
but constitute treason and involve the death penalty.
In Cochise county, within a week, one of the most
brutal murders in local history has been perpetrated. A
suspect has been arrested and is now in Tombstone.
What of him, in case of conviction of first degree mur
der? Can he not. also, be charged with treason?
There is no intention by the foregoing, to discour
age the application of the death 'penalty in Marico
county for the destruction of foodstuffs. It is the Inten
tion of The Review, however, to ask the simple question,
where shall capital punishment be applied? Does not
the operation of destroying crops destroy men? Does
not wanton murder reach the same end? Why the dif
ference in thought or application of the principle or
policy?
Sentiment reached a high state of inflation tn Novem
ber, 191S. when the people of the state w.sUtuted life
sentence for capital punishment There is too much sen
timent, in any event, in dealing with mureerers and
criminals. Rarely does a Jury return a first degree ver
dict and then only when it is warranted in the extreme.
During the past year the state has seen many wanton
killings. The murderers rest in the assurance that they
will LIVE.
Any step in the direction of detecting and shooting
incendiaries, according to the suggestion of Attorney Gen
eral Jones, is heartily endorsed by The Revrew. It sup
plements that endorsement, however, with the advice
that tbe death penalty should be- broadened so as to in
clude every class of first degree murderers. "
MEN AND OFFICERS.
Secretary of War Baker's explanation to the United
States senate, in answer to a resolution passed by that
body, defined the relations of an officer to the enlisted
personnel of his command. The statement, in our opin
ion, was hardly needed, but can do nothing but good to
clear op any misapprehensions held by the people as a
whole.
"An officer Is just as good as his men. no better and
no worse," is the manner in which the distinction, be
tween men and officers, was characterised by a good of
ficer on the Arizona border, bet so very long ago.
This officer went into details, explaining his state
ment. His details, a little more personal and more in
teres Ling, perhaps, coincide with those given by the
secretary of war. --
Social distinction In the United States army, cherish
ed nntil the Mexican expedition, has received a death
blow from democracy. It received a blow in the only
way it could, through a more widespread service. Time
was and that not very long ago on the Mexican border,
at Naco, Douglas and other points when a soldier was
considered, well he was not considered. He was a sol
filer. That covered his status. On the other hand, the
officer was an officer rnd, wherever he went, stepped
into his position, socially and from a military standpoint.
It was not the fault of the soldier, necessarily. It was
the fault of the people. It was not the fault of the rich.
It was the fault of alL The American army Sad become
a clearing house, in its ranks, for human derelicts who
could make a living in no other way.
Witness the change at tie present time!
Through the operation of the selective draft, ttje
average of American citizenship is now in the army.
Tbe enlisted personnel dees not consist of the "classes"
or the "masses." The army of this nation is merely it?
trained, male citizenship; having the same ideals, the
tme ambitions, the average scholarship, the average
Intelligence and the average desires of the same men in
peace times. In the few short months the training
camps have been in operation, they have done more to
clarify tbe atmosphere of class ignorance tnan any other
single agency in tbe late history of the United States.
In the experience of the drafted men the nation can
well pay attention to the results and adopt a modified
-scheme, at least, for peace time. If democracy, in its
finest sense, is to be retained, the implements for mak
ing democracy close association of man and man must
be maintained. There is no other method to meet the re
quirement except service and that service, must be for
the government, under rigid rules of discipline. Such
service, under our sys'em and under vur Institutions,
would not make for autocracy or militarism, but it would
make for that ideal which this nation desires, real de
mocracy. !
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
Only the Lord and Secretary of War Baker know why
the Lewis machine gun. the invention of an American,
has been twice rejected for the American army. The
Lewis gun, adopted by the British, has served through
three terrible years of the Great War and still bears its
dreadful title, "The Belgian Rattlesnake." That Baker
rejected it the first time, before its acid test, should not
be held against him. but that he rejected it after its dead
ly efifciency had been proved in the hardest fighting the
world has ever known, and by that rejection held up the
manufacture of machine guns in this country for many
months while our shops changed from the Lewis gun
mouldings they were making by the thousand for the
British, to the mouldings of an untried gun, he w ill never
be able to explain successfully to the average hard
headed, practical American citizen.
All this talk yon hear about the car shortage and
the nation's railroad problems over unmoved tonnage
is not mere hearsay or rumor or report. It is, alas, too
true, as The Review can personally attest, having a car
load of paper ordered three long months ago from Port
land. Oregon, still in transit Major Kelly of the Doug
las International and Friend Jaynes of the Tucson Citi
zen, can. if they will, lend their voices to this wail over
the progress sortheastward of this print paper that
moves slower than the proverbial molasses in winter.

"FRIENDS."
"We are no longer enemies, but frieuds," declares
General von Hoffman, of tbe German delegation, which
perfected tbe armistice under which the peace envoys of
Bolshevik! Russia and autocratic Prussia and Austria are
meeting. It is tbe old. aid story of the lion and tbe lamb.
Bolsheviki Russia and tbe most highly perfected auto
cracy in the world! Strange bedfellows, indeed.
The meeting of the rest envoys from the Lcnine
Trotzky government with Count Czernin and Dr. von
Kuehlmann a meeting to promote the democracy of the
world is one of tbe strangest travesties !n modern his
tory. It is as though Alexander Berknian and John D.
Rockefeller only doubled many times bad reached
complete accord on the perplexing problem of govern
ment. Of real democracy in Russia there Is little. De
mocracy spells restraiut not license. Tae Leuine and
Trotzky propaganda forctbidos an even greater debouch
for Russia. Their activities indicate, to the casual mind,
that the cH fairy tale f ill be re-eiia'tcd the lion will
swallow tbe la inl.
More than interesting will be the conference between
the envoys of the kaiser and emperor of Austria and
those of tbe Bolsheviki. Particular iulerest will atta u
to the ultimate peonage, exacted of tbe Rjs&Ians by tbe
Teutonic, foreign minister. Autocracy and democracy
much l.s fv-lsheviki li'-rnse do not mix. One dstroys
the other and in tin's Instance it is not bard to forecast
This is tbe season of Christmas editions but we pick
ouL of tbe entire number, the edition of the Douglas Iaily
International, appropriately termed the Miuing aud Indus
trial Edition," for special comment. In volume it is large,
tn readable content it is .excellent, in typography it is
comparable to the best end from an editorial standpoint
it is a credit to its makers and to Arizona journalism.
Cochise county has araia been shocked by a deliberate
and horrible murder. It is auother link in the evidence
against sentimentality which the people of Arizona seem
to have espoused. There is a remedy in the initiative and
also In the legislature. Cochise can stand but for ouc
thing the elimination of wanton murder.

WILD GEESE.
Will geese were flying south today!
I heard them honking overhead; and
to my aunt I paused to say. "The
winter's coming, autumn's dead. It's
up to me to lay in coal, to buy a stock
of flour and spuds, to strip my slim
aud meagre roll for weather strips
and winter duds. The weather pro
phet, in his den. may tell us what next
week may bring, but all the prophec
ies of men are merely tommyrot, by
jing. I would not for cold days pre
pare, if warned by any human seer:
man says tomorrow will be fair, and
it is dark and bleak and drear. Man
says tomorrow will be cold, and it's
so hot we stew in sweat; no weather
rightly was foretold by any human
prophet yet. The wild geese have no
maps or charts, no Instruments of
brass or steel; they do not try to
break our hearts with highs or
"lows" or kindred spiel. They have
no traps to measure wind, to weigh
the clouds or test the air, but when
for southern climes they've skinned,
for wintry days we should prepare.
I saw the wild geese gallivant, some
southern island is their goal; so lend
me forty bones, dear aunt, and I'll lay
in a stock of coal."

Whether the man arrested Monday
by Justin C. Daspit, special agent for
the department of justice in Douglas,
.s named Manuel Sanchez or Manuel
Hernandez is a small matter; tbe gov

deserter by either name. Sanchez was
arrested there on a charge of being a
deserter. He at once claimed he was
Hernandez. Rut this was of no avail.
Mr. Tompkins, working in the same
department of the government with
Daspit, arrested Patrick Henry Lusk
Monday on a charge of being a de

to respond to the call of the draft.

The Inventor of the British "Tank"
Colonel Swinton of the English
army, is said to be the man who is
directly responsible for the tanks
which have been of such great value
in the big British pushes, particularly
hi the recent drive on Cambrai. It is
now said that England is building
these tanks on a larger scale than
ever before and expects to put hun
dreds of them into use next spring.
The present tanks are able to hurdle
trenches and to sweep small trees out
of their- path. They are so heavily
armored that they cannot be de
stroyed except by heavy shell fire.
The 1918 models will be much more
formidable and destructive.
