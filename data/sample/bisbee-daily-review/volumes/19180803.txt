NUMEROUS TOWNS AND HAM
LETS HAVE BEEN CAPTURED
BY ALLIED TROOPS IN LATEST
FIGHTING, AT SOME POINTS AD
VANCE TWO OR THREE MILES
UNDATED WAR LEAD BY THE
ASSOCIATED PRESS. The crisis in
the allied offensive on the Soisons
Rlieims salient apparently has been
reached. French troops have entered
the town of Soissons, the wastern an
chor point of what remains tot the fa
liious salient, and all along the thirty
pix miles of curving battle line from
Soissons to Thillois. which lies about
three miles west of Rheims, French,
American and British troops have
pushed in the entire enemy front and
sent the Germans backward every
where in retreat. -
Over the battle front the fellies, by
nuick and fon-il!3 method of cm
slaught, have deeply Indented the
German defense line for splendid gains
which seemingly foreshadow the ne
cessity of the eventual retirement of
the forces of the German crown prince.
The plains behind the northwestern
portion of the battle front are dom
inated by the allied guns; In t!ie south
the French and Americans have nego
tiated almost all of the hill and forest
country and are encroaching percep
tibly toward the Fismes railway, while
on the east the British and French
are almost astride the Riieims-Sols-sons
railway and have their guns now
so placed that the enemy is sure to
be sorely tried as he endeavors to
press back and gain a haven of re
fuge along the Vasle river.
Just how far the retreat of the Ger
mans will go cannot at present be
forecast, but with the southern line
swinging northward in conjunction
with that on the east toward the Vesle.
and with the French dominating the
Aisne eastward from Soissons, it is
not improbable that the Germans may
be compelled to take refuge north of
the Aisne.
Numerous towns and hamlets have
been captured by the allied troops dur
ing the latest fighting, and at some
points they have advanced from two
to three miles. South of Soissons the
entire Orise river has been forded by
t.lie allied troops; northeast of Fere
En Tardenois the allied line has been
pushed well to the west of the region
of Grand Rozoy and the town of Sapo
nay has been taken. In the center the
Nesles wood is being swept clean of
Germans by the French cavalry and
American and French troops are
pressing the Germans hard north of
Sergy and the hamlet of Ncsles.
Further eastward almost to the
gates cf Rheims. combined forces of
Fritish and French everywhere are
sorely harassing the enemy. In this
latter region, in addition to Thillois,
the village of Vllle En Tardenois is
in allied hands and the French are
now on the heels of the Germans two
and a half miles north of the Dormans
Rfceims high road over! a front of
nearly four miles.
Altogether, viewed from the war
maps, the situation for the alliefl.
troops at present is a most promising
one for complete success in ridding the
SoiRROns-Rhelms salient of the enemy.
Throughout later phases of the bat
tles, the Germans have not shown
their stamina of previous days, and a
some points the allied troops, partic
ularly the Americans were enabled to
make their way Into German positions
with virtually no opposition being im
posed. All behind the battle lines the smoke
of burning towns Is visible whfTh
seemingly would give weight to the
prevailing belief in the allied capitals
that the Germans at present are no
where near the end of their retreat.
Aside from the Soissons-Rheims sali
ent there ha been little fight in any
of the war theaters. The British' are
continuing their raids on the German
in France and Flanders, and the Ger

War Tax on Tobacco, Ciga
rettes and Cigars Decided
Upon at Meeting
(By Review Leaded Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2. Heavy in
creases in the present war tax on to
bacco, cigars and cigarettes were
agreed to today by the house ways
and means committee as part of tho
new J8.000000000 revenue bill. The
tax imposes three times the existing
rates on some items for the schedule
and is expected to raise approximately
$340,000,000 in comparison with the
present $168,000,000 revenue from to
bacco. Members of the committee today
said all danger ot delay is over and
the bill will be in form to report when
the house reassembles August 19. The
Committee went back today to the in
come' surtax paragraphs and while
there was no definite action it was
evident there bad been heavy in
creases in surtax rates.
There was also some discussion or
two plans to superimpose a strictly
war profits tax on the excess profits
tax, one of the plans being for a com
plete supplemental tax, every dollir
of which would be additional to the
excess profits revenue, and the otne
an alternative proposition under which
the treasury would impose either tho
excess profits tax or the war profits
tax, but not both cf them. The tax to
be imposed would be that which would
bring the larger revenue in each indi
vidual case.
Today's action as to war taxes on
tobacco was independent of the spe
cial license tax on manufacture. or
tobacco in which double the present
tax was imposed on the basis of the
annual sales.
Chairman Kitchin made this state
ment tonight:
"The committee reached the follow
ing tentative decision as to the tobac
co schedule:
"On cigars weighing not more than
three pounds per thousand tax in
creased from the present $1 per thou
sand to $2 per thousand; cigars weigh
ing more than three pounds per thou
sand and retailing at not more than
four cents each, increased from $3 to
J5 per thousand; cigars retailing at
more than four cents and not more
than seven cents each, increased from
?4 to $10 per thousand; cigars retail
ing at more than seven cents each and
less than fifteen cents each, increased
from $6 to $15 per thousand; between
fifteen and twenty cents each, in
creased from $8 to $20 per thousand;
and those retailing at twenty cents or
more, increased from $10 to $30 per
thousand.
"Cigarettes weighing not more than
three pounds per thousand and retail
ing at less than two cents each, in
creased from $2.05 to $5 per thousand;
those of same weight retailing at two
cents or more, increusrd from 2.05

to mean the French are pushing

to force the enemy to continue
his withdrawal to the Aisne with

If the advance of the French
on this line continues, it may well

The Crise river tas been crossed along
the whole of its front further progress
has been made in the center of the

newed possibilities of a coup of
a decisive character. It is be
lieved. Among many officers there is a
strong feeling that operations on other
fronts of the western line are impend
ing. They believe that a blow by the
British to obliterate the Flanders sali
ent may come at any moment. There
have been hints that a great concen
tration of British forces has been com
pleted, probably in preparation for a
decisive battle on the western front,
and to observers here the time now
seems to have come for the launching
cf this assault. They believe it cer
tain that such a stroke will be ordered
by General Foch before fighting in the
Aisnc-Marne field has been stabilized.
ABANDON DISPUTED GROUND
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE. Aug. 2 (By The Associated
Press). The Germans are in retreat
on all sides of the salient between
the Aisne and the Marne. On the west
the French and British troops, con
tinuing their push of Thursday, have
'reached the valley of the Crise, a lit
I tie river which joins the Aisne at
Soissons.
I The Germans, therefore, have aban
jdoned the whole of the Chaudun Pla
teau. between the Coeuvres and Crise
valley.
I This ground has been a desperatelv
J disputed battle field for weeks. It
ihas been swept by the German heavy
I puns frr.m th nnrth nf llln line and
from the east and probably was the
hottest sector of the whole battle
front.
In the center the French cavalry
are in the big woods called the For
est De Nesles, a mile northeast of
Fere En Tardenois. On the allied left
the troops are in touch with the for
ests of the Ardre, two miles north of
Villers Agron.
The Germans, disregarding the mil
itary considerations which counselled
frank acceptance of defeat and rapid
retreat many days ago in order to
spare their men for their new at
tempt, have been obliged to accept
the inevitable and are falling back,
probably to the Vesle river.
Tho German crown prince's offen
sive on the Marne has failed as Bip
nally as that of Von Kluck in 1914.
aud the last word is with the allies.
The allied line this evening runs
from Hcmmieres to Soissons thence
to Belleau, the Valley of the Crise.
Chacrise and Arcy-St. Restitue,
through the center of the forest cf
Nesles to the village of the same name
and through the center of the forest of
Rheims to Lagery, L' Hery and Tram
ery. North of the last named three
places, French cavalry has advanced
another mile to Bois Le Moine and
Treslon. Brouillet is still In the en
emy's hands, in flames and further
east, near Rheims, Thillois has bean
retaken.
The day was one of continued suc
cess for the armies of General Man
gin, De Goutte and Berthelot. All
along the line the Germans have been
forced to hurry their retreat, especial
ly on the west and center of the sali
ent. The enemy is completely devas
tating the country as he retires, cur
rying out the settled German policy.
The French are now on the edge of
the plateau between the Crise and
Vesle after an advance which at some
places was three miles deep In seven
miles of Fismes. The enemy, H now
seems certain, must retire to the Vesle
and very probably to the Aisne.
A copy of the Berlin Tageblatt, re
ceived behind the French lines con
tains the following article written re
cently by Herr Hegeler, its war cor
respondent: REAL HUN VICTORY
"From the strategical point of
view tho seven day's battle has
been a complete failure. Never
theless, success has been gained
which I can register today. A
new part of France has been laid
waste. Everywhere are njned
towns, villages and farms. Fires
light up the nights, and all day
thick clouds of smoke, caused by
voilent explosions, float over the
ravaged cornfields and destroyed
forests."
A previous account, received dur
ing the day, drew the new allied iine
as running south t Villers Agron,
through Goussancourt and the Reddy
Farm (the latter a mile north of Cier
ges). past Perinees south of Sapona.
through Cramaille, Servenay and Cor
doux south of the Plessier Woos. and
through Contremain and west of Tlg
ny. he advances of the French troops
west or Fere En Tardenois give them
possession of the wholp ridge from ihe
Plessier wood through tfce Arcy Wood.
Thus they command the valley of the
Crise. which is the gateway to Sois
sons. THhey also have won Improved
gun positions, making It- easier to in
terfere with the German transporta
tion. YANKS MEET WITH
SMALL OPPOSITION
FROM THE ENEMY
(Continued from Paso One)
Jay by the French and Americans on
ihe Ai.sne-Marne front. From one to
two mile3 were gained, and with al
most no fighting.
Plans had been mai'.e to strike hard
blows acainst the resisting German
rear, but the German war council evi
dently had decided that the time was
inopportune to fight, for when the al
lies moved forward it was only to
follow up on the trail of the retreat
ing enemy.
At a few places there were sharp
encounters but, they were nothing as
compared with the terrible engage
ments that previously had been fought
or what was expected.
The French cavalry operated near
Drsvegny, abo it two and a half miles
noith of Coulonges, with tho American
infantry lo.se behind while another
;ctneh:r.''nt cf mounted French troop
oi.cr.ed the way a shart distance to
tho west, with French infantry and
American foct troop close up.
The penetration by the French and
Americans to the region of Dravesny
would place them only a scant eight
miles southeast of Fismes, on the rail
road line between Soissous and
Rheims,
To the. westward the French reache 1
tho outhern borders of the Loupcigne,
Mi'reiul and Aihuizy Woods, and tho
French cavalry to ih, southern bor
ders of tho Moines Wood. .
Occasional bursts of marhine g:in
lire chal lenged the advancing line. Vit
it wos apparent curly in tne move
ment that thr Germans h;d gone. The
stTfest fiuhtinj; encountered by the
Americans wa ; in a little piece ot
CK.iind east of Chamery. where, ac
ordii:g to th,. German newspapers,
the b'idy of Lieutenant Quentin Roose
vi U was hurried after his airplane
ha-l been brought down early In the
prec nt operation.
Thrti!;h wheatfields and over wood
id trails soaked with tne rain that
fl! ilinoM all day, the Americans
moved slowly and cautiously but al
most continuously, over farms and
pay' villages, among them Conlon.ie
and Copan. To the westward another
l rre of Americans also was moving

Prisoners were taken durtnfj tne oay.
One, a captain, admitted the Ger
man artillery had been withdrawn.
His story confirmed tales of other
prisoners that the Germans were de-,
termined to make their next big ataad i
on the Vesleg, and not the Ardre; and
that their movements under way indi
cated the fortifying of Fismes as the
center of the next fixed line of bat
tle. It is not anticipated that the Ger
mans will withdraw to the Vesle line
without renewing their rear guard re
sistance and It Is expected that the
present unopposed advance will end
quickly, perhaps with stiff fighting on
the high ground just south of the
Ardre in order to give the Germans
more time for getting their artillery
and stores across.
With only a slight advance in ad-
dition to that of today the heavy guns
of the allies will be in position to shell
Fismes and any part of the line the
Germans may determine to stand on
could Immediately be made uncomfort
able. Although the enemy's retreat on the
whole has been successful and he has
been able to get out the greater por
tions or his armies, observers have
witnessed conditions which they be
lieve indicates that the Germans are
moving more hastily than they desire.
Huge clouds of smoke and dull ex
plosions have come from St. Gille, on
the Ardre a short distance south of
Fismes. and other places near the
allied front. These told of the destruc
tion or big ammunition rumps. Fires
also are visible at eight or ten places,
even as far as Fismes. That they
had been started by the Grmans seems
obvious', since no allied shells nad
reached these places-during the day.
The Americans expect to find the
enemy prepared for a bitter fight, but
when they swung northward from
their positions in the line after brief
artillery preparation, to which there
was no reply, all was silence in front
of them. The skirmish line even was
abandond, and the men were enabled
to proceed single file through such
wheat fields and clumps of woods ps
they had known at home. During the
rarest of intervals there was a spat
tering of rifle or machine gun fire,
which served to check the line for a
few minutes- that was required to si
lence the enemy gunners.
KEEP UP ADVANCE
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
THE AISNE-MARNE FRONT, Aug 2
(Hy the Associated Press! 8 p. m.
The French and American troops
north of Fere En Tardenois advanced
simultaneously early Friday, the
French occupying Cramaille and Cra

infantrymen entering Saponay at 8
o'clock.
The Americans meantime kept pace
with the French through the forest of
Nesles.
Several locomotives and forty rail
road cars were taken at Saponay.
The allies advanced under barrage,
the Germans withdrawing northward
through the valley stretching from
Saponay, feebly replying at Intervals
with artillery.
There are many fires behind the line,

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Ahr. 2. Stocks were
under less -restraint today, althos;n
irading was at lowest ebb, with fur
ther backwardness In rails.
Investment issues received scant at
tention. The only exception was the
strength of Liberty tax exempt 2Va
which touched par.
General motors was most often the
central feature, recovering the great
er part of its recent loss at a gross
advance of 6 points. Industrial alco
hol, oils, marine preferred, Baldwin
locomotive. Sumatra tobacco, tobacco
products. Anaconda copper and ferti
lizers comprised the other steady to
strong specialties at extreme gains of
1 to 3 points.
Labor difficulties forced Western
Union telegraph down another 214
points, to a new low record for the
present movement. American tele
phone called a part of its recent Im
provement. United States Steel was almost a
point higher at its maximum, but drop
ped with other leaders at the irregular
close, retaining only a small fraction.
Faleg amounted to 126.000 shares, the
lightest full session of the year.
The general bond list was lower, In
ternationals easing with domestic is
sues, including 4,4's. Total sales par
value, aggregated $4.S7.r,000. Old Uni
ted States Bonds were unchanged on
call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, Aug. 2. Excessively dr
weather in parts of Iowa and Missouri
had a bullish effect today on corn.
The market closed nervous 1 to 2
cents net higher, with August S1.57l4
to Jl.57 and September $1.59 to
$1.59H. Oats finished off to
Vic up and provisions unchanged
to an advance of 2 cents.
Throughout the day, selling pressure
against corn was conspicuously absent.
In addition to the unfavorable crop
conditions In Iowa and Missouri, car
shortage complaints operated as a fac
tor in lifting prices. Comprehensive
reports which a leading authority made
in regard to cron detonation did much
to prevent any important downturn of
values at the last.
Oats averaged slightly higher ow
ing to t!ip strength of corn.
Provisions were neglected but firm.
Sharp advances in the hog market
more thail offset the unlooked for bear
ish showing of the monthly report of
stocks on hand.

FAIR PLAY
( From the Tombstone Prospector)
We are not fighting the battles of any
candidate for the nomination for governor
ship on the democratic ticket but are the
champions of fair play and we do not be
lieve it is fair play that some of our demo
cratic brother editors should be harping
that Fred sutter is a corporation hireling;
that he has a "copper collar" on and a lot
of rot of a similar character. The fact is,
Fred Sutter is an absolute independent man
and they all looked alike to him as superior
judge of Cochise county and if elected gov
ernor would be the self same independent
man as governor as he was judge and as he
is as a private citizen. And now in refuta
tion of the vile slanders of some of the
editors up north, we want to make a state
ment that will probably surprise the afore
said editors. During the year 191 6, Fred
Sutter, on behalf of a client, secured a judg
ment for $10,000 against the C. & A. Min
ing company. Steve Davidovich was the
iplaintiff. The case was appealed and we
find that the "Appellees Brief" in case No.
1543, Steve Davidovich vs. Superior and
Pittsburgh Copper company, is signed Fred
Sutter, W. B. Cleary, attorneys for plaintiff
appellee and that was in April, 1917. It
doesn't look as if the companies have
a collar on Sutter, when Cleary and Sutter
are joint attorneys in a suit against the big
C. & A. Copper company. And this is the
same Cleary so well known as "Windy
Bill," the anti-corporation attorney. Fair
play, gentlemen of the press, or. at least
confine yourself to the truth.
LOOKING DOWN FROM THE AIR
The editor of the Washington Times is
generally pessimistic when he views the
trend of the war. He looks ahead to next
year when we shall finally come into our
own. But in the following his enthusiasm
over American dash and courage has car
ried him away and he looks with shining
glance at a bright present state of affairs
on the western battle front:
"Thanks to the United States, which has
done its duty and no more these are the
conditions.
"Hoover is told in London this week
that the English can buy bacon and pork
freely, without any card or restriction.
"England, that was to be starved, has
plenty, and the submarine is a failure.
"Infinitely more important is the scene
upon which our flying men look down
upon the western front.
"The men with their backs turned to
the enemy running at high speed are Prus
sians that were to conquer the world in
ninety days.
"And the young men rushing ahead of
their cannon and food wagons, under the
leadership of Foch, the magnificent French
soldier, are young Americans. Their ar
rival at the front line has been the signal
for an inspiring series of victories for the
allies. There is marvelous power in unself
ish enthusiasm, and that power our young
men take into battle."
The cost of printing a newspaper stead
ily mounts higher as the war drags on.
Labor, material and postage go up like a
flock of airplanes on a clear day. The Los
Angeles newspapers fought the mounting
cost of everything until they were com
pelled to fall back before the big drive and
announce an increase in the price of their
papers to the public. Beginning August I
the price of these newspapers on the streets
will be increased. Afternoon papers which
heretofore sold for one cent will sell for two
cents and morning papers formerly selling
for two cents will be increased to three.
The street price of Sunday papers will be
seven cents in Los Angeles and immediate
vicinity and ten cents elsewhere. The in
cryased price of afternoon papers by car
rier will be forty-five cents, the announce
ment said, and that of morning papers will
be eighty-five cents a month.
OUR EXPORTS
Our foreign commerce for the fiscal year
just ended, showed a slight decline, exports
amounting to $5,928,000,000, a decrease
in twelve months of $362,000,000; while
imports touched $2,946,000,000, a gain of
$287,000,000. This movement left an ex
cess of exports for the twelve months
amounting to $2,982,000,000, compared
with $3,631,000,000 a year ago.
The tendency toward a more normal
trade balance will be considered beneficial,
inasmuch as it facilitates control of the ex
change market and tends to restrain the
growth of an excessive European indebted
ness. The June exports of merchandise
were $485,000,000, compared with $552.
000,000 in May, a decline of $67,000,000,
largely due to a shrinkage in shipments of
foodstuffs. June imports figured at $260,
000,000, against $323,000,000 in May.
The total exports of breadstuffs in June
were only $54,000,000, compared with
$76,000,000 a year ago. Meat products
on the other hand rose to $78,000,000,
compared with $41,000,000 the same
month a year ago. Of cotton, the ship
ments were valued at $45,000,000, as
against $27,000,000 last year. During the
twelve months we shipped $653,000,000
of breadstuffs in comparison with $589,
000,000 a year ago;, while meat exports
were valued at $680,000,000, as against
$403,000,000 last year. Cotton exports
reached $655,000,000, compared with,
$543,000,000 the last year.
The rush of foodstuffs to our allies in
March, April and May fortunately relieved
the danger of famine. But the obligation
of feeding Western Europe will continue
to fall largely upon the United States ; and
it is necessary to still further stimulate pro
duction, and practice conservation of food
until the war ends.
Mr. Hoover performed a brilliant public
service by insuring the allied food supply.
Had it not been for his efforts, food prices
would have been much above their present
level; and his success has been due far
more to earnest appeal than to legal en
forcements; all of which reflects favorably
upon Mr. Hoover's tactfulness, backed by
public patriotism.
Since February 1 5, when the training
school at Hog Island was opened, 872 men
have been given instruction in it, and
turned over to the ship construction depart
ment, and are now engaged along the ways,
doing efficient work with the veteran ship
builders, according to the Hog Island News.
Up to June 22 last 809,707 rivets were
driven in the ships under construction at
Hog Island of which number less than I per
cent had to be cut out by the inspectors. A
considerable part of this work was per
formed by men who graduated from the
training school. .There are now 800 stu
dents enrolled at the training school and 50
per cent of these are being trained along
the ways. There are eighty-five instructors
a,t the school and eighty-seven aspirants for
the post of instructor are undergoing train
ing at the center.
With our summer rains long delayed, it
is getting hotter than usual here, but this
is still a summer resort compared to Mis
souri and Kansas these August days. From
Topeko comes word of a temperature that
stayed at 102 until 5 o'clock in the eve
ning, and from Sedalia, Mo., the weather
man reported it was 1 06 above. The editor
of this column has basked in the beautiful
sunlight of both these localities in his day,
hence his enthusiastic ravings from time to
time about the glories of the summer cli
mate here in the desert. They send word
from time to time from the blue grass
bloom up yonder commisserating this pil
grim upon his summer stay in the sand.
But he knows they are sweltering up yon
der in a nightmare of heat, while he merely
complains if it get a little warm down here.
Pay no attention to this talk about Tur
key breaking with Germany. She would
like to do so, no doubt, but she hasn't a
chance. The German is too thorough. His
officers dominate every branch of the Turk
ish army and his agents control the police
system of Constantinople.
The crown prince ought to be a master
of the art of conducting a "strategic retreat"
by this time. He has had enough practice
ever since he was driven back from Verdun
some three years ago.
The name of the German General Hell
means "bright" in English. But wc hive
some generals of our own vho arc brighter
than Hell.
SALE OF WAR STAMPS
APPROACHES FORTY
THOUSAND
REPORT OF SALES IN BISBEE
POSTOFFICE FOR MONTH NEAR
LY REACH THAT FIGURE WHILE
WARREN AND DON LUIS SALES
ARE NOT INCLUDED
The sale of war saving stamps in
the towns of Bisbee aiid Lowell for the
moiitli of July amounted to the sum of
iCT.aT'j according to the report of Post
master Lailey, which was completed
yesLerday. The sale does not represent
the entire sales in the Warren district.
The postoftice at Warren is not in
cluded in the salts of the district as it
secures its supply of stamps from the
Douglas postoiuce as does Don Lui3.
An effort was made last evening to
reach these places by phone to ascer
tain the amount of these sales so that
they could be added to the receipts
of the Bisbee office and the tot-it
amount given but they could not be
reached.
There has been but a slight demand
for the cashing of the stamps in the
LSisbee postoffica as in comparison to
a number of offices and only S7.15.6S
worth of them were cashed last niniiui.
This is an excellent showing and it is
to be hoped that the record will be
maintained. The slackers in this re
spect are not to be found in the dis
trict. One of the great virtues of the war
savings plan is that it brings into tn
treasury a steady stream of money
Against which the United States can
draw for current expenses. This reg
ular daily income, for some time past
in excess of the entire cost of running
the government before the war. Is or
tremendous assistance in enabling the
government to keep sending forward
the supplies so sorely needed by the
men at the front, particularly in the
present offensive. A war saving so
ciety of 100 members, each buying
six thrift stamps a day, or a
little over two war savings stamps a
week, will keep an entire company o
soldiers supplied with their daily ra
tions. If sixteen members of a war
savings society buy only one thrift
stamp a day each, they will be fenc
ing a corporal and his squad. j
The war savings societies at home
feed the men nnd tho machine guns
at tho front. The government counts
upon them for the constant flow of
money which their members have
pledged themselves to supply. There
is a very definite relationship between
the money which the army of savers
at home puts into government securi
ties and the bullets which the army
of fighters abroad puts into its guns.

A notice appeared in yesterday
morning's Review stating that the
sheriffs office had received a telegram
askhig about Mrs. Ted Rhodes. As
soon as the sheriff's office was opened
yesterday morning there appeared a
man who said he was Mrs. Rhodes'
husband and that she had been in no
accident; that she was the proud
mother of a baby girl that had arrived
on Thursday morning and wished that
a telegram be sent to the army officers
at Camp Funston to that effect and
that she and daughter were both do
ing nicely. The officers there had
wired for information on account of
Itho fact that a teletrram has been re
ceived there by her brother stating
that she was dangerously ill and want
ing him to come. A telegram was
sent to the officers there explaining
the circumstances. The Review notice
brought the desired result.
