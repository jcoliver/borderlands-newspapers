ERAL PROBE OF
ES IS BEGUN
Cost of Building Materials
Under Investigation
in Chicago
CHICAGO, April 5. A dozen wit
nesses were examined today by the
legisla);vet commission investigating
the high cost of building materials in
an effort to show the existence of an
alleged price fixing combination
among Chicago brick manufacturers.
The testimony showed that the
American Equipment company, which
leases o nroyalty a patented brick
setting machine, to the leading brick
manufacturers, wields a powerful in
fluence over the industry. All the
members of the alleged combination
have a contract with this company
which contains a clause specifying a
their product. The contract was
signed in 1914 and fixed $7 as the
price for brick delivered in Chicago
and $5 fo rbrick on board cars to be
shipped to outside territory.
B. M. Weber, president of the Na
tional Brick compauy, testified that
there was a clause in this contract
which permitted a. majority of the
manufacturers In the agreement to
alter the maximum price whenever
they desired. It is believed that It
was under this provision in the con
tract that the present price of S12
was fixed.

Malady Announced by
General Blue
WASHINGTON, April 5. Although
183 cases of lethargic encephalitis, or
"sleeping sickness," with 14 deaths,
were reported to the United States
public health service up to March 29.
officials of the bureau still are un
decided whether the disease of the
type prevalent in Europe, has reached
the United States. In a statement
tonight the bureau said it was impos
sible to say whether the figures gave
a true picture of the prevalence of
the disease inasmuch as the disease
is not generally 'reportable; to the
health officers.
"The diagnosis in most of the cases
reported to have been based largely
on the presence o fa stupor, a con
dition found in many other diseases,"
the statement said.
"In the absence of any method of
positively establishing a correct diag
nosis and especially because of the
failure, thus far, both in this country
and abroad to find a specific germ in
these cases, the public health service
is as yet unwilling to accept "lethar
gic encephalitis" as a new disease."
Surgeon General Blue has detailed
qualified medical officers to make a
comprehensive investigation in order
to learn the true facts regarding the
prevalence of the malady, it was stat
ed, and has requested state health
officers to make the disease, report
able so that the study of it can be
facilitated.

Casualties
BERLIN Thursday, April p. (By
he Associated Press.) Prussia's huge
losses In' officers and men during the
war are indicated by a staff officer,
who writes in the Lokal Anzeiger. He
submits figures compiled from the of
ficial casualty lists to show that 32,
454 active officers at the front were
killed, wounded or missing out of
10,178,000, who actually fought at the
front.
. He points out that these figures be
lie the stories sometimes heard that i
the Prussian officers did not attack j
with their men, an dasserts that their
losses were particularly neavy in the
first two years, but were much less
in the. later years of the war because
the officers had to be saved for gen
eral staff work.
The figures show also how little
Germany counted on a long war, for
the Prussian mobilization contem
plated 3.700,000 soldiers, to which ap
proximately 6,500,000 had to be added
before the end. Germany started the

COPPER SITUATION Czechoslovaks,
th eiinwi?!Dnrwc?'CHT
VIIEII BUILDING BEGINS
Passing of Dividend of Calu
met and Hecla Reflects
Dull Market
Are Praised By
Yankee Forces:
No incident in the copper situation
bas given a better idea of the actual
condition in the copper metal mark
et than the passing of the Calumet &
Hecla quarterly dividend, . ears the
Boston Financial News. The an
nouncement came out of a .blue sky,
for while it was thought that the
dividends would not be as large as
$15, the two last previous declara
tions, nobody looked for an entire
omission. The action is undoubtedly
& ocrrect reflection of a very dead
metal market with the price of copper
not only below the currept cost of
production but actually away below
. the current cost of production but ac
tually away below the cost of tJie cop
per now in transit from the mines 01
held in storage.
What makes the Calnmet action the
more prominent is that the export
committee which went abroad to learn
the condition of the copper market
evidently found the situation a Tery
poor one, and as President Agassiz
was a member of that committee the
passing of the Calumet dividend must
have been due largely to the. infor
mation which he gleaned on the other
side.
Market Saturated
Despite the fact that copper is be
ing offered at under the cost of pro
duction, consumers are slow to take
on any lareg tonnage. But this is
probably not due to the belief that
the price is going lower but rather to
the lack of new orders for goods in
which copper is used- Consumers
probably feel that it is cheaper to
let the , producers carry the copper
through the transition period, especi
ally since all the mines are producing,
although at a reduced rate. Yet even
at the reduced rate of production
there is more copper comining out ot
the ground today than is going into
consumption. The market ia satur;
a ted and it will not be until the con
sumption begins to use up the metal
faster than it is being produced that
there will be an improvement In the
price.
But on the other hand the . large
producers are not offering the -metal
at under 15 cents "and it is doubt
ful if they would pell mucli at that
figure. They cannot afford to dis
pose of copper at this price a3 there
would be a loss on every pound sold.
They v. iiy undoubtedly sell somcat.
that figure with the jmrpose of, en
couraging the buyers to come Into the
market and thus make a basis from
which to work. Copper producers are
not in the market to sell their com
modities at a loss. All must have
a profit or business will cease.
Profits Steadily Decline
The chief load about the neck of
the copper situation is the large sup
ply of government copper, both. here
and abroad. How much there is of
this metal is not known definitely,
but it is sufifclent to operate as a
damper on the entire copper market.
Although the producers enjoyed hand
some profits during the first two years
of the war, if the present condition
prevails for long their average profit
w ill steadily decline. They are the one
claf-3 of interests who have been hit
particularly hard in the post-war pe
riod. Copper is down to a pre-war de
p res-ion ptice, but no pther com
modity h:i dropped to such a level.
St'1".! has come down but not to the
pea -e level. Neither has cotton nor
grain, ncr leather, etc. It will prob
ably ee the. last to recover for as
pointed out above, the surplus is
large and there is no pressing demand.

The first case of the new disease
sleeping sickness for the Warren dis

er it really is a case of sleeping sick
ness or some other malady, is not
known so far, but the victim, who is
at present making his quarters in the j
Lowell jail, has been sleeping since
Thursday and all efforts on the part '
of officers to rouse him have been of !
no avail.
The man, whose name is unknown,
was found by officers in Johnson ad
dition last Thursday morning. He was
sleeping at the time and it was
thought the man had been drinking
too much "white mule." However,
he was taken to jail and when much
cold water and slapping of his hands
failed to awaken him, the officers be
came worried.
. Judge J. L. Winters, who is at a
loss as to the cause of the man's sick
ness, has instructed Deputy Sheriff
Tom Foster to watch over him and
ever since then the officer has been
trying different remedies in an effort
to get the man to talk. The man is
about 45 years old, an American and
be is a stranger here. He has not
eaten any food since he was found.
Should the sleeping man show no
signs, of improvement by tomorrow a
physician will be consulted.

The natural condition of a child is
to be happy and carefree. When the
girl mopes and is indifferent to school :
and study, or the bey-fa sullen and re-!
fuses to- go out and play, the child '
needs a laxative to empty the bowel'
and stir up the liver. !
But something should be given that I
will produce the result in as simple
and natural a way as possible. Harsh
cathartics and physics are neither
necessary or desirable. )
Many mothers have found that the i
combination of simple herbs produces j
a free movement of the bowels with- j
out griping ., This combination is sold I
in tablet form under the name of Laxcj
carin and is universally . being useu. j
Only a few laxcarins are required and j
it is very pleasant to take in fact it
is a doctor in candy form. That is
why children like it so much. A few
hours after its use the child will be its
happy self again. It works like a
clock.
It is an excellent remedy for the
mother herself, and for the other mem
bers of the family, in obstinate or oc
casional constipation, . for . the relief
of sick headaches and an aid to colds
and fevers, , minor skin eruptions and
all disorders where the basis of the
trouble is constipation. It aids diges
tion, relieves fermentation, neutral
izes ever acidity, stops the bloating of
i gas. aids sour btoiuach. .
In spite ,
laboratory costs ;
by sacrificing
profits and absorbing war taxes
we have maintained the price at which
this family laxative has been sold. It

during the last few weeks to order ,

Single Handled, Attacked Gun Crew
SACRAMENTO, April 5. Personal
experiences and observations during
the first days of the Korean "passive
resistance" movement for Independ
ence were described here today by V.
S. McClatchy, publisher of the Cacra
mento Bee and a director of the Asso
ciated Press. It v.as Mr. McClatchy
who returned from Japan April 2, who
made public through the Associated
Press the first translation of the Kor
ean proclamation of Independence to
be given to the world..
Thi3 copy was obtained by him in
Seoul, the capital of Korea, and was
brought out by him personally. It was
the reading ofc this proclamation In
Korean cities March 1, at memorial
services for the former emperor, that
marked the beginning of the independ
ence movement.
Mr. and Mrs. McClatchy spent two
days and a half in Seoul and made two
trips through the length of the Korean
peninsula. His description . of the
"passive resistance" movement agreed
with that of the Associated Press cor
respondent at Seoul, told recently.
Japanese officials, he said, had de
nied publicly that acts of violence
were committed from the start by the
agitators and a Japanese public inves
tigation had disposed of charges that
American missionaries had instigated
the independence movement, acquit
ting them "even of knowledge or the
matter."
"The astonishing thing about the
demonstration," Mr. McClatchy said,
"was that no injury was done to prop
erty and no violence attempted by the
Koreans, even in retaliation for what
seemed unnecessary brutality on the
part of gendarmes and soldiers in
making arrests."
Speaking of these arrests Mr. Mc
Clatchy said:
"Eye witnesses have told me of girl
students being set upon by Japanese
coolies with clubs and stamped upon
and being marched off by the gen
darmes with thongs-about their necks
and tied together by their thumbs. Up
to the time we left Seoul, March 6,
firearms had not been used by the
Japanese in that city as far as I could
learn and while there were numerous
injuries from clubs, clubbed muskets
and swords, no Koreans had been
killed."
On the morning he and Mrs. Mc
Clatchy left Seoul an unsigned procla
mation from Korean leaders appeared
congratulating the people "on the man
ner In which they had testified to Ja
pan and to the world their desire to
be free, and on the self-control and
forbearance with which they had es
dured injury and arrest." They were
reminded that as oKreans they must
stand up for the sacred cause to the
last man and they were cautionee
again to do no violence and no injury
to property.
Mr. McClatchy commented at length
on the contentions of the Korean
that their nationality was being stif
led by the aJpanese administration but
cited also many public Improvements
and educational advantages instituted
by the Japanese.

HOME FROM PACIFIC
COAST PAVING TRIP
No Decision Yet Reached as
to Type to Be Adopted
Here, He Says fc '
"I cannot say what would be the
best paving for Bisbee. I do not wish !
to venture an opinion and I shall await
the return of City Engineer Herrlck
before I give to the citizens of Bisbee
my opinion on what I would suggest
that they invest their money in," said
Mayor Jacob Eriokson, who returned
from the Pacific coast yesterday aft-i
ernoon after a two weeks' so-journ
which was utilized in the study of
good roads in the southland.'
"Do you have a preference for con
crete? Don't you think it would stand
.the strain of this locality?" he was
asked. "Well, yes,' 'he replied. "Since
you have broached the subject of con
crete. Yes. I looked over the concrete
roads and I find that they have given
the best service in California. It has
stood the wear and tear of the tourist
traffic, that migrates to the Pacific
coast annually. It has stood the acid
test very well. Personally I am par
tial to it but I shall not submit my !
opinion to the council until I receive '
the facts and figures-Jrom Mr. Her-
rick." And shaking the dust from his
outer-coat he pointed with pride to the
Copper Queen hospital and said: "See
that? Well, we'll build roads that will
correspond to the stability of that in
stitution. Yes. It's the people's mon
ey that we're handling and they'll eet
penny for penny on the investment." I
The city engineer will return" early i
thi3 week. On Monday night a coun-l
cil meeting will be held to canvass the '
paving bond election vote and to dis
cuss the work of commencing street
paving.

Chicago Boy Alen Advanced
on Machine Gun Nest'
In Face of Fire
By A. E. Geldhof
WASHINGTON, April 5. Jo
hannes S. Anderson of Chicago
was first sergeant of Comnnnv n
. 132nd infantry, when the Thirty
third Division captured Consen
voye in the great allied advance
of last October.
TJie Germans wei-e pouring an
intense artillery and machine-gun
fire into the American line be
tween the Meuse and the Argonne
forest. Company B was right In
the thick of it
Sergeant Anderson noticed that
most of the machine-gun fire came
from a single German machine
gun nest just ahead of his com
pany's position. Its fire was so
deadly that the company could
not advance; it would have meant
instant death to every man in it.
Instantly Sergeant Anderson
formed his plan. Leaving lis
company, he crept forward alone
, across No Man's Land. The
ground was flat and open; the
sergeant's only protection from
the murderous rain of bullets and
xploding shells over his head
was a shell hole here and there
which afforded him a moment's
rest
Crawling steadily forward, how
ever, Anderson worked his way
around the boche machine-gun
nest and to the rear of it. Fate
was with him, and he never got
a scratch.
Reaching a shell-hole just be
yond the German crew,' Anderson
dropped into it and awaited his
opportunity.
There were 23 men around the
German gun, and they were pump
ing it for all they were worth. At.
last they had to stop to replenish
their ammunition. Anderson's
chance had . come. Jumping up
with a wild Chicago yell, he fired
his rifle into, the midst of "the
Huns and rushed . forward upon
them.
The Germans were taken com
pletely by surprise. This was
entirely contrary to all they had
been taught about the laws of
war.
For one hated American to at-

Ugly Spots.
There's no longer the slightest nees
of feeling ashamed of your freckles,
as Othine double strength is guar

Simply get an ounce of Othine -
double strength from any druggist
and apply a little of it night and
morning and you 6hould soon see' that
even the worst freckles have begun to
disappear, while the lighter ones have
vanished entirely. It is seldom that
more than an ounce is needed to com
pletely clear the skin and gain a
beautiful, clear complexion.

Before the Huns-realized it, they
had their hand3 in the air. and
were 'yelling "kamerad"!
The brave Chicago soldier or-
dered the 23 to face about for
the American line. With the cap
tured machine gun on one shoul
der and with his bayonet pricking
the chagrined boches, Sergeant
Anderson marched the whole 23
of them back to Company B, his
prisoners.
A great yell went'ujfc from the
rest of his company when they
saw their sergeant approaching.

is, before we pass on it," said "the
Judge.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, APRIL 6, 1919.
TO 1 ASWAR ENDED
Aggregate Strength of Ger
many and Associates
Was 7,630,000
WASHINGTON, April 5. The cen
tral powers faced odda of greater than
two to one in mobilized troops when
Germany gave up the fight last No
Tember. The estimated aggregate
strength of the f nemy powers at that
time, according to official estimates
made public today by General March,
chief of staff, -was 7,630,000. The in
dicated aggregate allied strength on
the date was more than 16.70Q.000.
This situation is disclosed in the
figures received bF the war depart
ment from France giving the present
status of the belligerent armies. They
show that . the., central powers on
March 1 had under arms 1,125,000 men
while the allied forces aggregated
13.366,000. ,
Following is General. March's state
ment: "We have received from France
some rather interesting figures about
the demobilization of the central pow
ers and the demobilization of the en
tire allied forces to include February.
The demobilization is still going on,
but the figures show what has been
happening over there. The central
powers figures are:
Estimated strength By February,
on Nov. 11. Reduced to.
Bulgaria 500,000 ' 129,000
Germany 4.500.000 820,000
Turkey 400,000 70.000
Austria 2,230,000 106,000
"The total force of the central pow
ers on November 11, was estimated at
7,630,000. This has been reduced, to
include February, to 1,125,000, or to 15
per cent of their strength. On the
same day on which this report was
made, the strength of the allied forces
was 13,366,000, or 75 per cent of the
strength which they bad on Novem
ber 11."
Turning to the demobilization of the
American army. General March said
that the second anniversary of the en
trance of the United States Into the
world war found the restoration of
American manhood to civil life more
than 40 per cent complete. On returns
up to April 1, the army had been re
duced to an aggregate strength or
2,055,718. For that force General
March has set a mark of 310;00 dis
charges a month toward which pro
gress is being made. Actual dis-
charges up to and including April 5
aggregated 1,624,171 officers and men.
"Every state in the union," General
March said, "is welcoming its return
ing son3 the finest types of American
manhood, clean and virile and deserv
ing the thanks of the American peo
ple." ZBYSZKO TO MEET LEWIS

It is a good rule for all women
-but it is positively vital for mar '
xied women to say Always Look
Your Eest
If a married woman will always
look her best when hubby .comes
home, he WILL ALWAYS COME
HOME!
Seriously, it is the duty of every
woman to study her personality,
her figure, her type of beauty, :
and dress, talk, and act upon it.'
If you have not good taste, it
will pay you to hire, someone who
has to ' advise you on what to
wear and what not to wear. A
good dressmaker, an intelligent
hairdresser, &nd "wise selection
of underthings as well as over
things will do more to make your
homa, an -attractive place for tbe
man now. occupies it with you
than anything else I know of.
There is one formula that I
know of, which if every married
woman would adopt, might create
a great deal more happiness than
exists today. It is this: ALWAYS
DRESS FOR .YOUR HUSBAND
AS YOU DID WHEN HE WAS
YOUR LOVER. No matter wheth
er you are very beautiful or
very plain, you surely have some
one or more good points of which
you can make toe best. If you
have a plain face but beautiful
arms and shoulders, let your
dressmaker make you gowns that
display your arms and shoulders.
If you have a pretty face, but a
scrawny neck, cover your neck
with soft filmy material and
. busy yourself in exercises and '
massages to fill out the scrawny
neck.
Wear' pretty things for your
husband. Many a husband looks
at his stenographer's silk stock
ings, because his wife Insists on
wearing cotton ones! Many a mar
ried mad admires a chic kown on
some other woman, because his
wife keeps on her house dress to
receive him in when he ocmes
home in the evening.
Be beautiful for your husband;
and if you can't be beautiful, be
as beautiful as yoa can:

William Fox will present Theda
Bara in "Cleopatra," the widely her
alded film version of the loves of
Egypt's siren iueen. at the Eagle the
ater, commencing today, with com
plete music score.
Described as a film spectacle of sur
passing beauty, "Cleopatra" bares on
the screen the passions of the vampire
of the Nile The ancient siren is said
to be admirably impersonated by the
foremost modern exponent of siren
roles. The filmed "Cleopatra" depicts
that lady's historical encounters with
Caesar and Antony, and the meeting
of her army and that of Antony with
the forces of Octavius. It shows, as
well, the world's first naval battle
the battle of Actium where the com
bined fleets of Antony and Cleopatr
were routed and finally burned to the
water's edge by the Romans.
Ancient Rome and Alexandria were
recreated in California, where "Cleo
patra" was filmed under the direction
of J. Gordon Edwards. The Roman
Forum was reproduced and there is
shown the death of Caesar. Cleo
patra's - famous barge once again
moves majestically over the water,
and the famous feasts of , Egypt's
queen, those feasts which by their ex
travagance dazzled the eyes of Caesar,
and later of Antony, are shown in all
their sumptuousness.
Thrilling chariot races across tne
desert sands, the hand to hand conflict
of spear-armed soldiers, an dthe tri
umphal entry of Octavius troops Into
Alexandria, all are ghown,,vhile the
Sohinx and the Pyramids look down
on the scene as they did thousands of
years ago.

GRAY WOLF WILL BE
EXTERMINATED IN
TWO YEARS IN UTAH
SALT LAKE CITY, April 5. The
gray wolf, responsible for a large per
centage of cattle and sheep losses in
the western part of the country, will
be exterminated in Utah within two
years, and the western states wjll be
freed of the animal within five years,
through the campaign against preda
tory animals now being conducted by
the United States department of agri
culture This is the opinion of Dr.
A. K Fisher, in charge of the depart
ment, given during a. recent visit ti
this city -
Dr. Fisher said there were about
V)Q gray wolve? left in Utah. He es
timated tht each such wolf destroys
?10i0 worth cf stock annually. Dr.
Fisher says that $95,000 was paid the
government for hide sof predatory an
imals last year .and that the various
states received almos ta like amount.
He declares that $4,000,000 worth of
wool and meat and $10,000,000 worth
of grain and produce were saved last
year through the killing of predatory
animals.
Sheep and cattle can be turned out
on the range in places where it for
merly was impossible before the de
struction of predatory animals by
government trappers and various
boards, according to Dr. Fisher, and
crops ar eraised with profit where it
formerly was impossible because of
activit yof grain destroying rodents.
Dr. Fisher predicts an increase in the
efficiency in this work annually.

German Control of U. S.
Metal Market Is EndedA
A. Mitchell Palmer Tells How He Killed Octopus Whose
Tentacles Held Markets of the World
NEW YORK. April 5. A. Mitchell
Palmer's report on the elimination of
German Interest in the metal indus
tries of this country was made public
yesterday by Francis P. Garvan. Mr.
Palmer's successor In the office of
fallen property custodian. Th' re
port is accompanied by four charts in
which the ramifications ' of German
control had grown and multiplied likej
the tentacles of a giant octopus and
were fast enveloping mines, smelters
and kindred factors in tie field of
metals, as already occurred in other
parts of the world.
It mar be said " Mr. PaWr wrftP.
, . . ' 7 . i
in his summary, "that finding German
interests and German Influences ln
the American metal market centred j
In three well defined -corporations
American In name, but all controlled
by the German metal triumvirate, the
activities of which were not confined
solely to the United States but pene-!
trated into Mexico and South Amer
ica, owning mines, 6melters, refineis
ies, oil concessions, railways, dealing
in every known metal ding business!
which annually ran Into hundreds of
millions of dollars, the alien property
custodian has succeeded in thorough'
ly Americanizing two of these con
cerns and in liquidating the third,
thereby entirely eliminating German
influences in our metal markets and
our metal industry.
German Metal Octopus.
"The German metal octopus had
spread his tentacles across the ocean
and over into the. United States and
Mexico and South America, but for
the present, surely, and for all time.
It is to be hoped, it has been driven!
back and a wall of Americanism erect-l
ed against him," says the report. j
' The report deals exhaustively with!
the development of German dominance
in the metal industry of the world."
Germany was never a great producer
of metals. Her production of copper
in 1913 was but 3 per cent, of- the
world's output, against about 60 per
cent produced by the United States.
Her production of refined zinc is about
23 per cent and. of lead she produces
16 per cent.
Though she consumes 500,000,000
pounds of copper more than she pro
duces, she consumes only 23 per cent
of the world's zinc against her own
prooucuon or -a per cent, ur leaa snej
consumes 'about 20 per cent against
her own production of 16 per cent, i
iet wie completely controlled the zinc ;
and lead markets of the world.
The secret of her power lies In the
fact that her great metal firms acted
in concert in the purchase of zinc and
lead ores, co-operated in the control
of smelters and refineries and, by th
free use of unlimited credit extended,
to them by the German banks, who
themselves participated in these in
dustrial enterprises they were enabled
to buy and sell huge quantities of
metals, thereby influencing the mar
ket prices.
'Three' Great Concerns.
There are but three great interna
tional metal concerns In Germany
the Metallgesellsshaft, Beer, Sond
heimer & Co. of Frankfort, and Aron
Hirsch & Sohn of Halberstadt. The
Metallgesellschaft is the most pow
erful metal concern in the world. It
i3 a stock corporation, with a capital
of 18,000,000 marks. In the early six
ties of the last century Henry Mer-
ton, whose real name was Moses and ;
who was related to Philip Abram
Colin, founder of the parent company,
set up the metal business in London
which finally became the powerful
house of Henry It. Merton & Co. The
Metallgesellschaft and the ' Merton
firm worked hand In hand for the
advancement of German' domination!
of the metal markets of the world. j
The business of Aron Hirsch & Sohn I
has always been kept in the Hirsch
family. It has interests all over the
world. Beer, Sondheimer & Co. is a
copartnership which has confined its
activities principally to the zinc
smelting business.
In the control of these three houses v
were not only German metal and j
chemical companies, but also French,'
Belgian, English, Australian, Ameri-i
can, Swiss Austrian Italian, Spanish j
and Mexican. In addition they con
trolled syndicates for the exploration)
of mines in South America Hungary,)
Russia and Africa. In this vast com
bine were charted 245 separate com
panies whose interests lay in almost
every part of the globe and which
produced every known form of metal.
At the outbreak of the European
war each member of the triumvirate
bad a branch of its business in the!
United States. .The Metallgesellschaft j
had the American Metal company,!
Aron Hirsch & Sohn had L. Vogelstein !
& Co.. and Beer. Sondheimer & Co.
bad a branch under its own name. All'
the branches were in New York andj
all developed vast and extensive in--
teresU in the United States. Mexico
cud South America. Under whatever i
name t'te branches operated, the con-
trcl remained with the German homej
companies. j
The Americau Metal company had
among its most important subsidiaries
the American Zinc & Chemical Co.,
the Barlesville Zinc Co.. the American

ing improved processes of ore concen
tration and was connected with rari
ous minerals-separation companies,
which used the patents. -
After the passage of the Trading
With the Enemy Act in October, 1917,
the alien property custodian investi
gated! the three concerns, with the
result that he took over the entire
business of Vogelstein & Co. and of
Beer, Sondheimer & Co. and 49 per

BIG CURTAILMENT IN
COPPER DIVIDENDS
IN ARIZONA NOTICED
Rqd
uction Elf fects Pocketbook
of 100.000 Share-hold
ers in Mines
Reduction of from one-third to one
half in copper mine dividends in the
state has occurred since November
last. Among those making curtail
ment of one-half in their rate is the
Calumet & Arizona. Verde Extension
has just passed by an extra dividend
that was expected. Ray Consolidated
curtailment of payments represents
reduction of a third. None of the
producing companies have yet, how
ever, wholly ceased dividends except
the Shannon. There may be some
that will be obliged to do so shortly,
for copper is costing more to produce
at the present time than it is com
manding in the market.
The reduction of dividends is to the
owners of copper properties what. the
reduction of wages is to the employes
of the companies. It i3 a fact that is
not of en given consideration that
there are more owners in- Arizona
copper mines than there are employes.
Owners in these mines probably ex
ceed 100,000 In their total number.
' There is one company alone in the
state with 17,000 stockholders, and
no producing company among the 17
large ones in Arioznai except the com
paratively i close ' corporations of
Phelps Dodge and United Verde, with
fewer than 5000.
Get Double Cut.
The more than 100,000 shareholders
in Arizona copper properties, the
owners of these, compare with an
outside estimate of 35,000 employes
in all branches of the industry in the
state. Many of the 100,000 owners,'
incidentally, are also employes, there,
being few of the old time Arizona
miners who have not from a few to
a good many shares in Ariozna pro
ducing mines. Calumet & Arizona,
Verde Extension, Inspiration, Rey
Consolidated, Old Dominion, Shattuck,
New Cornelia are notable among the
big mines In which' miners have in
the aggregate large holdings. These
shareholders get a double cut; when
wages and dividends both go down.
The rise in wages following the
beginning of activity in the copper
market in 1915 and the increase in
demand and price was greater pro
portionately than the increase made
in payments from earnings to share
holders. With the decline in. metal
price and copper demand in effect
since the armistice, the decrease in
wages has been much less proportion
ately than the decrease in payments
to shareholders. The cut made in
wages among employes in the copper
industry, in other words, has amount
ed to less than one-sixth in compari
son with a minimum cut of one-third
and a maximum, fo the present time,
one one-half to the thousands of own
ers, -r The latter were, in every part
of the country, but mainly In the lake
copper country, the western mnning
states, Pennsylvania and the New
England states so far &o Arizona prop
erties are concerned. For the most
part they are people of mode3t means,
a great many of them being employed
daily. :
. Dividends Reduces.
.Mining dividends as. reduced at this
time are returning 'fair Interest only
in the best of cases. Mining dividends
are presumed to do more than that,
indeed must do more if they break
even for the investor' pocketbook.
.In addition to interest they must make
return of capital invested, because if
they do not when the ore is all gone
the investor who opened, or helped
open, the mine with his money will
find himself lacking the amount of
his original investment. The end of
the ore is in the end of the mine,
and it has no other asset, unless a pos
sible &urplus in the treasury which
may be disbursed, with which to make
returns to its owners.- In -nearly all
cases when the mine comes to an
end, however, the surplus is nil, hav
ing been exhausted in endeavors to
find more ore,' the hope of which will
very naturally persist until the very
last resource has been exhausted in
mqneyand research."
While the copper dividends in Ari
zona are going down, singularly
enough the gold - dividends have
started upward. These miners In
Arizona are also largely owned by
miners, most of them people of small
means. This is true in the case of
both United -Eastern and Tom Reed,
the premier gold producers in the
state. During the war the gold prop
erties opprated in (most Instances
eithtr at a loss or on a very close
margin. Since then the heavy fed
eral taxes have been taken off and
they have been enabled to again do
business at profit In. the case of the
United Eastern this has been reflected
in the last few months by sufficient
gain in income to permit to increase
its dividend rate from 5 to 7 cents.

Story of Exploits V
In Washington
When I set out to gather from
the war department the facts
about the Archangel expedition,
I found that not even the general
staff nor the army war college,
which is the historical branch of
the army, had enough information
to form a connected story of the
expedition's exploits.
In the office of General Peyton
C. March, chief of staff an attache
told me:
"Communication with Archangel
has been so dififcult that the of
ficial reports from Col. Geo. E.
Stewart, commander of the ex
pedition, and from Col. James A.
Ruggles, military Intelligence .at
, tache at Archangel, have been few
and far between, mostly confined
to reports of casualties and the
physical welfare ef the men."
From the facts I did obtain,
however, it is possible to piece to
gether a sketchy story covering
the high spots of the expedition.
Its history really dates back to
February, 1918. when the allied
ambasadors at Petrograd found it
necessary to flee from the Rus
sian capital to Archangel. That
turned American attention to Rus
sia. In the following month the
Germans began to occupy parts of
Finland, and again it became ap
parent to the allied governments
that some action was necessary In
western Russia. The new govern
ment of North . Russia asked the
allies for help.
En&i&nd and France, therefore,
aent detachments of marines to
Kola, on theMurman coast, to pro
tect the Murman railroad, running
from the Murman coast to Petro
grad. and the vast war supplies
that had been gathered along this
railroad. The Finnish White
Guards were advancing to seise
this road.-.
First U. S. Marines
Landed Last July
On July 1 a detachment of Uni
ted States marines landed at Kola
to co-operate with the French and
British in this work. The marines
are still there, so far as is known.
On July 30 General Pershing
cabled that on recommendation of
General Foch, he had detached
33Sth regiment of Infantry from
the Soth division and sent it to
Archangel on British transports.
The 339th was made up largely of
men from Detroit, employes of
automobile factories and was in
command of Col. George EL Stew

A little later Pershing reported
he had rent one battalion of the

310th engineers, the 337th Field
Hospital and the 332th Ambulance
company to Archangel. These
nnits, also, came from the 85th
division, and were made up of
men from Michigan and Wiscon
sin. The total number was 5334.
A detachment of British troops
also was sent "to Archangel, and
the whole expedition was placed
in command of General Ironsides
of the British, army.
Experience of " the quarter
master corps in supplying troops
In Alaska was called into play to
equip the expedition. In addition
to the regular overseas equipment
the men got fur caps, fur mit
.tens. moose-hide moccasins, fur
overcoats, fur parkas, or hooded
coats and "mucklucks," or winter
boots used in the north country.
The Americans landed at
Archangel August 5, and lost
no timt) in getting into action
against the bolsheviki, who were
reinforced by German troops.
Three days after they had landed
they had begun the march south
ward toward Vologda and had at
tacked the bolshevik forces. '
As a result of these conflicts Pre
mier Lenine on August 9 issued a
statement that the bolshevik gov
ernment considered itself at war
with the entente. This was fol
lowed on September 10 by corro
boration from Ambassador Fran
cis, then at Kamalaska. He re
ported that the Germans and bol
sheviki had signed a new treaty,
.requiring them to join forces to
expel the allies from Russia.
In Ten Days They
Advanced 100 Miles
t By August 5 the British-American
expedition, accompanied by
several companies of pro-ally Rus
sian ' troops, had marched 100
miles southward along the Archangel-Vologda
railroad, without
encountering any very great re
sistence. On Auguest 22 the allied repre
sentatives at Archangel Issued a
proclamation to the Russian peo
ple, stating they had come at the
- invitation of the Russian govern-.
ment of the north , to expel th.e '
Germans from Russia and over
turn the Brest-Liitovsk peace ;.
treaty. -
In the .meantime the American
forces were aiding refugees, Amer
ican and otherwise, to - escape
from Russia to Stockholm by way
of Archangel.
The Bolsheviki were massing
an army along the River Dvina,
which empties into the White
Sea at Archangel, so in Septem
ber an American and Russian
force was sent southward along
the Dvina to disperse them.- The
bolsheviki had several gunboats
in the Dvina, and two of these
were sunk by allied troops and
naval units. Three guns also
were captured, and several towns
were occupied.
At the same time the allied
troops operating farther north
In Kola peninsula, had driven
the Finnish White Guards
back across the border and
cleared the Murman coast and
the Kola peninsula.
By the middle of October the
bolsheviki, considerably rein
forced on the Dvina, began a,
series of heavy attacks against
the Americans. Our boys were

outnumbered and driven from
several of the towns they had oc
cupied, but their casualties were
not heavy.
Base Established at
Mouth of the Voga
On October 16 the American
Russian force repulsed another
heavy attack and carried out an
advance along the Dvina to the
point where it meets the River
Vaga. Here a base was establish
ed and the troops pushed on up
the Vaga toward the city of Shen
kursk, 190 miles, south, of Arch
angel. -The epemy retiid to Ko
tlas, 75 miles southeast. '
Another battje took place -at
Ugor, in Vologda province, and
the Bolsheviki were driven from
the. town.
Everywhere' they went the
Americans found the 'peasants on
the verge of .' starvation, and re
joicing at their arrival. Great
fear prevailed ' lest the (bolshe
viki come back and" renew their
reign of terror. The ever-present
American Red Cross sent a ship
load of food and other supplies
into the district and relieved con
ditions to some extent.
The Bolsheviki then began to
entrench, themselves along the
Dvina, and on October 19 they
forced the allies to withdraw, for
six miles. But another American
force then started a movement
southward along the Onega river,
which is about 70 miles west of
the Dvina, to outflank the soviet
forces. This forced another re
treat of the Reds, and the Ameri
cans, together with a British de
tachment, captured the city of
Shenkursk, on . the, Vaga, Oc
tober 30.
Here they were reinforced by
considerable numbers of Russian
tribesmen. On November 15 the
bolsheviki opened a heavy bom
bardment of the allied lines along
the Dvina, but the allies replied
so effectively that the Reds suf
fered heavy casualties.
Winter now set in and the
country became1 frozen up, so
that military operations went
forward under difficulties.
The Dvina became blocked with
ice, and the Reds were forced to
withdraw their gunboats and
abandon their efforts to drive the
Americans back down the Dvina.
Snow and ice hemmed in the
Yanks and Pritish between the
rivers Vaga and Dvina and sep
arated them from the bolsheviki.
New Advance Begun
Up the River Pinega
On November 28 the allies be
gan a new advance up the Pinga
river, which joins the Dvina 50
miles above Archangel. March
ing over frozen swamps and snow
covered roads, the Yanks and Rus
sians took many bolsheviki pris
oners and by December 1 had cap
tured the towns of Shetagorskoi,
120 miles from Pinega. By this
time the whole western end of the
Republic of the North was under
allied control.
Then followed another operation
which had for its objective the
capture of Vologda. A force of
Siberian and Czecho-Slovak troops
were moving on Vologda from the
Ural mountains front to the east,
and the American operatoin was
timed to be in conjunction with

On December 30. the 339th In
fantry, accompanied by a Polish
legion, a French infantry detach
ment, Canadian artillery and Rus
sian volunteers, advanced fifteen
miles up the Onega river, 40 miles
west of the Archangel railroad,
and captured the city of Kadish,
one cf the larger towns in Arch
angel province. This improved
the allied outpost positions con
siderably. Fighting around Ka
dish continued for several days,
the allied forces being outnum
bered by the Bolsheviki three to
one.' They succeeded, however,
in holding their positions around
Kadish. .
The Americans- and their allies
now were scattered, -over a wide
front In northern Russia, and it
was Impossible to consolidate
their various positions into an un
broken front, chiefly because of
the weather, ;
Allies Out Numbered
2 to 1 by Russians
In the early part of January the
makeup of the allied expedition
was approximately as follows:
British 6,000
Americans 4,500
French 1,500
Russians 1,200
Poles and others 1,000
Total 14,200
Against this small force the
soviet government had sent a
force estimated at 25,000-tnen,
with 150 machine guns, 66
field guns and 9 six-inch guns.
Thus vastly outnumbered, the
Michigan boys and their allies
were forced to fight under tre
mendous difficulties. They march-
- ed through great fir forests In
snow up to their waists, in dark
ness for twenty hours of every
day for the days in the north
country are only four long in mid
winter. For shelter they built
. rough lean-tos or occupied the log
huts of the peasants scattered
. here and there along the few
roads that run south of Archan
gel. Sleds were used for transport
ing supplies, sometimes, horse
drawn, sometimes reindeer or dog
drawn. But despite all their dif
ficulties, the American troops
maintained perfect health, discip
line and morale.
Early last January the oBlshe- 1
viki started a terrific bombard
ment of the allied positions on all
four fronts in north Russia
those of the Onega, Vaga, Dvina
and Pinega , rivers.
It was apparent the Reds were
planning jan infantry attack to
"drive the allies Into the White
sea" their announced intention
For two weeks, intermittently
the bolsheviki shelled the allied
blockhouses, concentrating most
of their fire on the line between
the Vaga and the Dvina, near
Shenkursk.
Bolsheviki Burn
First City Captured
j On Jan. 23 the force at
Ust, Pedenga, the point fur
thest south reached by the
allied expedition, was forced
by the artillery fire to with
draw. At Shenkursk, on tt Vaga,
was a force of one British, two
American and two Russian com-

panies. This little army was at
tacked from three sides on Janu
ary 24. .
Outnumbered and facing ca
ture, the allied troops "evacuated
the city and retired five miles to
the north. Shenkursk was burn
ed by . the bolsheviki. Another
allied force at Tania, IS miles
west of Senkursk, was attacked
at the same time by 1000 Red sol
diers, and was also forced to re
treat ten miles. Two hundred
more Reds drove back the allied
force which was holding the town
of Kodema, 2 miles from Sen
kursk. In this retirement the Ameri
can losses were only ten killed,
17 wounded and 11 missing.
On January 26 the Soveit troops
again subjected the American
force at Tulgas, on the Dvina, to
a heavy artillery fire and then at
tacked, but were repulsed with
heavy losses.
The next day the Bolsheviki at
tacked Shegovarsk, 20 miles north
of Tania, in such numbers that
the allies retired 10 miles down
the Dvina. taking up their position
at Vistavka.
The principal consequence
to the allied forces of these
retreats was the capture by
the Reds of large stores of
provisions and other supplies
which had been brought from
Archangel by sledges. Hun
dreds of peasants were driven
from their home's. '
The retirement constituted a
retreat of about 75 miles north
ward along .he V,aga and the
Dvina. After another week of
spasmodic fighting in this sec
tor, the Red attacks forced the al
lies to fall back for 40 miles fur
ther, and TarasoTo was evacuated
on January 30.
Allied Defense Sends
Reds to the Woods
The bolsheviki continued their
offensive against the new allied
position along the Dvina. no
tably at Tulgas. but were every
where thrown back with heavy
losses. On February 4, however,
the Soviet troops began a bom
bardment of the town of Vista
vka. the new allied stronghold
early in the morning, and -kept it
up until 3 o'clock in the afternoon,
when their infantry launched an
attack.
The allied soldiers were by this
time thoroughly rested after the
retirement from Shenkursk. and
they gave the Reds a pretty right.
They poured so heavy an artil
lery and machine gun fire into the
bolsheviki ranks that the latter
broke and the Reds fled to the
woods.
On the same day the "Bolshies''
began an assault against the Pi
nega. River front, to the south
east or Archangel, and forced the
allies to retire, but failed to dis
lodge them from the town of Pi
nega. On February 7 the allied troops
.
' " 4.

ADVANCE
on the Onega River opened a lit
tle offensive of their own to im
prove liheir positions jsouth oC
Kadish. This force was soon re
enforced by the "French Foreign
' Legion," a detachment of Russian
volunteers trained at Archangel
by French officers and sent south-
ward.
. Allied airplanes aided In
harrassing the bolsheviki, and
the army of Americans, Brit
ish and Russians made a suc
cessful advance of five milete
south of Kadish, to prevent
the flanking of the American
positions on the Vaga.
On the tenth the Reds suc
ceeded in occupying temporarily
several allied blockhouses in this
sector.
On the tenth and eleventh the
Lenine troops atacked the Amer
ican positions at Sredmakrenga,
on the Dvina, but they met with
such effective resistance that they
were forced to retreat.
Two Weeks Lull, Then
Renewed Offensive
For more than two weeks after
that there was a lull in the fight
ing, although the Reds kept up a
desultory artillery fire.
The big offensive was not yet
over, however. The bolshevik gen-'
eral staff at Moscow declared
recently that the bolshevik army
would reach Archangel by May 1.
This statement may, however, be
based on the fact that the War
Department has announced that
the American trovjps are to be
brought out of North Russia. :
The British government has an
nounced that a copy of the mili
tary plans of the Soviet govern
ment which has fallen into' its
hands indicates that the offensive
of last winter was to be the great
est effort of ttie bolsheviki, and
was to be followed by another in
the spring.
Since March 1 the fighting on
the Archangel front has been un
important. On March 3 the Reds
attacked the allied forces north
of Vistavka, but were repulsed.
Their artillery also renewed the
shelling of the Dvina positions.
On March 6 the town of Kadish,
which has changed hands several
times, and was destroyed by shell
fire, was permanently evacuated
by the -allies, who retired to the
bank of the Emtsa River.

the fight ended, however, the

On March 15 the bolsheviki
made an attempt to cut the allied
line of oomniunicat JonJ between
the Dvina and the Vaga, but the
effort failed. The Reds lost 57
killed and four prisoners, whilo
the only casualty suffered by the
allies was cne man wounded.

made.
In the period between Febru

"Must Be No Sabotage by
Capital or Labor," Ad
vises Noted Economist
By Roger W. Barbson
Head of the Information and Educa
tional Service U. S. Department
cf Labor
While Congress has been busy In
vestigating bolshevism, the executive
department of the government, under
direction of the president, have been
earnestly trying to prevent its spread.
Instead, however, of merely scolding
about it, these departments have been
endeavoring to remove 4he cause for
its existence,' namely, by extending
opportunities, reducing prices and pro
viding employment.
One thing, however, has seriously
handicapped some of the federal de
partments in their efforts to improve
the situation. Therevls an apparent
attempt at sabotage from certain new
quarters. Ey "sabotage Is meant an
attempt to destroy values by refusing
to perform work or otherwise, with
the avowed purpose of personal profit
Heretofore, the word sabotage has
been used only in connection with the
I. W. W.'s These questions, however,
are now being asked.
Other "Sabotage" I
Is it not as much, "sabotage" for a
manufacturer to try to smsh, a cur
rent wage rate as for a -wage earner
to try to smash machinery, provided
both are actuated by a desire for
personal profit?
It it not "sabotage" for a speculator
to attempt to destroy values in ordei
that he may buy goods cheaper ov
bring about financial conditions which
would force others to sell at a loss
against their will?
Is it not as much "sabotage" for
capital to refuse to do business, hop
ing for lower prices of material and
labor as iC is for labor to refuse to
, work, with the avowed purpose of
making industry so unprofitable that
capital would be discouraged and the
plants would fall into the workers'
hands?
I am not making any charges;
moreover, I know that the great ma
jority of manufacturers and bankers
with whomI com in contact are not
guilty of such "sabotage!" Something
or somebody, however, is gumming
the wheels of prosperity.
The executive departments of the!
federal government have not prepared
any theoretical plans for reconstruc
tion which are impossible of execu
tion. They have not prepared any
paper programs. They, however, are
working on sound economic and prac
tical, plans for reviving a national buy
ing movement.
Buy Wisely, But Buy Now
Normal employment of labor can be
maintained only with a normal vol
ume of new orders. Manufacturers
are willing to produce, merchants are
willing to stock op, when the public
is willing to buy. "Washington beli
eves there is a very large buying
power in America which is being held
back simply by the mental attitude of
the buyer. In addition to' helping the
various departments to secure from
congress the needed legislation to car
ry out the various reconstruction
plans already referred to. public of
ficials can perform the greatest serv
ice by preaching:
"Buy wisely, but buy now." j
The problem of getting the country
to economixe was handled during the
war -by systematic publicity cam
paigns, carried on by the treasury de
partment, the labor i department, the
food administration and other agen
cies. It is strongly recommended to
na today that the government should
now secure as much publicity fr a
movement to stimulate buying as it
did, during the war, to retard buying.
As one who had charge of the war
publicity of the' labor administration,
endeavored to get the wage worker
from a peace basis to a war basis, both
as to his labor and his purchases, I
feel that I should spend as much time
and money in getting back on a peace
basis as I spent during the war' in
getting business on a war basis.
Publicity Campaign
I am In favor of the government get
ting behind a nation-wide publicity
campaign to stimulate business for
the mutual benefit of manufacturer,
merchants and wage workers. Only
by such national newspaper advertis
ing could justice be done to every
stathe and city. The entire cost of
such a campaign could be covered by
contributions from the Industries of
the country in the same manner as
the cost of the publicity for the Lib
erty loan was taken care of without
expense to the government.
The buyer should be appealed to
not by asking him to buy something
that he does not need. It could be
explained that a buyer who follows a
waiting policy rot only Injures the
business of his fellow men, but tends
to bring about a business depression
from which he ultimately will himself
greatly suffer.
. The manufacturers can be appealed
to to do all In their power to adjust
prices as quickly as possible to a reas
onable basis. Where feasible the
manufacturer should be nrged to guar
antee the merchant that, should the
manufacturer's price for the commod
ity be reduced within a given time,

LONDON, April 5. How to house

is bothering the military authorities.
Many of the older tfpes will be scrap

but many others will be kept by the
army and be always fit for emergency

WOMEN EDIT ITEMS
FOR BRITISH AGENCY
LONDON, April 5. Renter's, the
great British news collecting agency,
during the war has been employing
women as sub-editors. Seven of them
were used in the -London offices, and
so well have they done that one of
them is now "covering" the peace
congress. Before the war the agency
did not even hire women typists.
the merchant will be protected by a

Finally, labor should be appealed to
to help in the campaign by doing bet
ter work, and by co-operating to re
duce the cost of manufacturing.

Every period of inflamation is fol
lowed by a period of deflamation. We
are not burying our headhin the sand
as blind optimists, although we had
rather be blind optimists than blind!
pessimists. What we are fighting for;
is that the readjustment shall not be

Tanlac that I began takfilg it, too, and

We will drill in Texas too, after we get going in good shape in the BOWIE OIL BASIN.
OUR HOLDINGS IN THE BOWIE OIL BASIN ARE NOT A PROSPECT, BUT A

Tested by our chemist, this sand yielded a high gravity parafin base oil, yielding 30 per cent'
gasoline and, in their turn, naptha. benzine, kerosene, etc. This establishes it as a petroleum
of the highest economic value. That's why we can make such positive statements. The oil
is there. We have seen it- handled it tested it We know what we are, talking about.
If we find no more oil sand we will be content with this first strike. But we have pur

A Horse Is Decorated
The French government has decorated a horse for gallantry in action
This recalls Queen Victoria's hanging the Kabul medal around the neck
of Volonel, the dainty Arab steed of the late Lord Roberts.
Every war except 'the latest has produced famous horses. Nineteen
chargers were killed under Napoleon. His favorite steed, Marengo, an
Arab breed, was wounded seven times.
When Lord Alfred Paget led the Charge of the Light Brigade, five
riderless horses raced neck and neck with him, eager to get into action
a trait vouched for by old cavalrymen. In this engagement 80 more
horses were killed good average figures for old-time battles.
Many centuries were required to deevlop the horse.
Originally they were small as dogs and were tie pets of the children
or tne cave men.
, museums display graauaiea sKeietons snowing now tne uve-toea
perissodactyl ungulate mammals developed into Dobbin of today.
Came the period when, in a wild and even man-eating state, they
were tamed by man, who recognized their possibities for warfare.
s Horses drew the chariots of Rameses with their deadly sharp knives,
jutting from the wheels.
Later the horse became a beast of burden. But to warfare and
later to racing we owe the science of breeding, which began in earnest
when heavy cavalry horses were introduced Into England during the
Norman invasions and crossed with British roadsters, coach and draft
horses.
r All American horses come from imported stock. The first batch,
brought by Columbus in 1493, perished. In 1519! Cortez landed 15 horses
in Mexico. A century later French steeds were shipped into Canada.
A few, escaping, produced the great wild herds that made for ro
mance on the plains of the west. Some scientists dispute this, claim
horses are native Americans, and cite bones of ' pygmy horses dug up
in the Mojave desert by Professor J. C. Merrian.
Today America has 23,000,000 horses and is largely given to riding
in automobiles.
Well, It Finally Got Here
Well, after fussing around for a few weeks spring iinally got here.
Every year seems like it takes spring a bit longer to thaw out and
get on the job, but she finally makes it.
Just about the time you have given up hope of ever seeing an angle
worm face to face and when ma says that if she has to patch those oldest
set of flannels again she'll die why you wake up some morning and there's
the sun a shining not a cloud in the sky some warmth to the air the robins
and junkos and wrens and bluebirds and larks and tinier creatures just
singing their heads off and winter kicked clear out of the state.
The first sue enough spring day; when you just know it isn't going
to freeze right hard again this season that's a real day.
The blood flows a bit faster; rheumatic grandpap hobbles out to the
back yard and sorts the bean poles. , -
The boys and girls of. the neighborhood begin to come home from
school together.
The office seems 'mighty stuffy and tiresome.
Mother leaves the kitchen work and putters around in the place where
the bulbs ought to be but usually are not.
The smell of old rubber and rags and burning weeds arises and green,
things pop ip out of the ground and from bare tree limbs like magic.
Aye it is magic.
The" resurrection andythe life; the annual reminder that death is as
transient as life and that eternal forces flow and ebb and flow again but
never cease.
A reminder that decay is but preparation for new birth and that from
the rich earth the buried things rise in a more vivid living dress.
And too, curse it, a reminder that the first half of taxes are nearly
due, and we have to buy 50 feet of hose and a new baby buggy!
Remove the Mask of Coldness
A little girl was trying on a lot of new dresses and her"" face "fairly
shone with happiness and satisfaction. t Child like she wanted every
garment she saw. ' -
"How happy your little girl looks and how easily pleased," said an
observer to the mother.'
"No," answered the mother, "it is only that she has not yet learned
to hide her feelings behind a mask of indifference."
It's true. How often we are tickled most to death by a favor or a
new suit or something that comes into our lives, but we hide 99 per cent
of that pleasure behind a mask of cold ness. - We do not wish to appear
demonstrative.
But, how are those who try to please us to know they are succeeding
If we do not pat them on the shoulder or smile at them for work well
done. '
Let us be children in our appreciation of kindness and of service. It
will make us much better satisfied with ourselves and it will make those
about us infinitely more happy.
When we remember all the things
before we entered the war, it gives us
th cost of their activities must now be
weight of taxation.
We are told that , the German peace delegates are to be on an equal
footing, although there is a count among them. It isn't anything much
for the other delegates to declare them the equal of the Hun counts
we know about.
Despite Soutn America's pitiful wail for popular automobiles and
toilet goods, we are about to .take those ships of the South American
run and send them to people who regard food as a luxury.
Governor Zinovieff of Petrograd says that any treaty the bolsheviki
may make with the allies will be a scrap of paper. Any treaty the allies
make with the boliheviki will be a scrap of Imbecility.
The Huns didnlt appoint eBrnstorff as a delegate to the peace
conference, and we are beginning to believe that the Huns have acquired
a leader with a little horse sense.
Future legislation to control disease germs should provide hemp
rope treatment for the genus that invents new machines for use in
the game of organized murder.
It is only fair to tell Germany that a part of her food shortage
Is due to the fact that her submarines cast so much bread upon the
water.
The amount of the indemnity demanded by Belgium won't be satis

Y. M. C. A. INDIAN ON
RHINE WITH YANKS
COBLENZ, April 5. Miss Anne
Ross, descendant of Cherokee war
rior, who has follewed the doughboy
trail from Paris right up into Ger
many, serving as a Y. M. C. A. enter
tainer, is not very much impressed
with the boche "auger-warrior"' as
she finds him in his native haunts.
"Too fat," is her frequent comment on
the Coblenz residents.
Miss Ross, or Princess Galilohi, to
use her Indian name, has just befin
assigned to Coblenz as an Entertainer.
When she dances she furnishes her
own accompaniment with a tom-tom
or a gourd rattle and chants teh tunes
to which the Cherokees have danced
for generations. She finds that the
doughboys like the Indian music and
dance best of all. Even a New York

BATH AND SWIMMING
. POOL FOR SOLDIERS
COBLENZ, April 5. When Neuweid
was opened up as a leave center for
the Third army corps, comprising the
2nd and S2nd divisions, the officers
found on the main street a fine, sub
stantial, rather ornate bath and swim
ming pool which up to that time had
been used by the German civilians.
It was turned over to the Y. M. C. A.
and now each day a good part of the
1000 men who come In each three
days on leave disport themselves
where the Germans used to frolic.
"This is the greatest treat we've
had since f leaving the U. S. A.," the
boys agree as they splash and dive
in the pool and boil and shiver under
the hot and cold showers.

No Dividend Action Owing
to Unfavorable Copper
Market Conditions
(Special to the Review)
GLOBE, March 30. The Iron Cap
Copper company reports for January
24 .cars of ore shipped to the smelters
which carried from 1.02 to 3.4 ounces
silver and 3.87 to 9.60 copper. Re
turns from smelters gave $51,1S7, ex
penses were $51,805, showing; an ap
proximate loss on a 15 cent basis of
$618.
' As the Engineering & Mining Jour
nal published no quotations for cop
per metal during January, the com
pany provisional settlement from the
smelter basis on a price of 15 cents
a pound, with the understanding that
when the metal is sold au adjustment
is to be made. Production for the
month was 773,797 pounds.
On February 21 the Arizona Com
mercial Mining company field suits
against the company, one seeking pay
ment to them of a; part of their ex
pense incurred in pumping water from
their ground, a portion of which water
they contended has come from Iron
Cap ground; the other seeking to re
cover) proceeds from the sale of ore
which they allege have been extracted
from veins which, apex the property
of the Arizona Commercial.
The officials of the Iron Cap have
been advised by what they believe to
be competent authority that .these
suits are without basis. In fact they
have never prior to February of this
year heard any intimation that the
veins now being worked by the Iron
Cap apex other than on its property
and they do not believe that they io.
Steps are being taken to protect the

Mining, and Financial News
BY REVIEW
KKW YORK, April 5 At the out
set of today's short but active ses
sion of the stock marxec indications
pointed to a further advance of the
general list under the guidance of
rails, but profit taking in that quarter,
also among oils, and renewed pres
sure upon steels created an irregular
tone at the close.
Southern Pacific, the reature of yes
terday's demonstration among rails,
failed to make more than fractional
improvement at any time and react
ed 2 points when offerings exceeded
demand. Reading ana other coal
shares ;also yielded their moderate
gains. Sales amounted to 550,000
shares.
Mixed conditions in the stock mar
ket reflected the character of ad
the heaviness of United States steel
being ascribed to uncertainty regard
ing the outcime of the' impeding con
ference with the war industrial board.
The bank statement disclosed an
other large actual contraction of
loans, a total of about ?S7,000,000 in
two weeks, but last week's decrease
of actual reserve was replaced by a
substantial increase.
Foreign bonds yielded slightly, but
Liberty issues and standard rails and
industrials were steady. Total sales,
par values, aggregated $6,775,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call during the week.
BANK CONDITION
NEW YORK, April 5. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for -the week shows
that they held $50,852,590 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is
an increase of $21,545,030 from last
week.
COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, April 5. Cotton clos
ed steady at a net advance of 55 to
79 points on new style months. Old
style deliveries closed 'net 20 points
lower to 100 points higher. '
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO. April 5. iVotwithstand-
ing that for distant deliveries corn to
day touched the highest prices yet
this season, weakness prevailed in the
market as a' whole by reason of in
creased offerings to arrive from the
country. Quotations closed heavy, c
to 2c net lower, with May $1.56 to
$1.56 and July $1.4S?4 to $1.4S.
Oats lest to lc. In provisions the
outcome ranged from 10c decline to
40c advance. ,
Selling pressure .on torn deemed to
be directed chiefly against the May
delivery. The later months, too suf
fered from liquidation, but not until
the May-July j difference had become
3 cents narrower than was the case
earlier in the week. Cash owners led
the selling of May. Renewed adv?ces
that labor difficulties at Buenos
Aires were again threatening to cur
tail Argentine exports had only a tran
sient bullish effect.
Oats followed the changes in corn.
For the most part, trade was local.
Provisions averaged higher with hogs.
Prices for liv eanimals overtopped all
records since September.

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK, April 5. Enonomic
events of vital importance engrossed
the attention of banking interests this
week," while the stock market contin
ued its advance, with such passes and
variations as might naturally result
frcm realizing for profits and the ten
tative aggressions of the bear faction.
The extent of public interest was
again a matter of debate, but all avail
able information confirms the belief
structoive side continues to have its
main impulse from other other than
local sources.
Accession of bullish sentiment from
interior points coincides with more
stable conditions reported from var-.
rious industrial centers
Although a confuseM situation exists
in the steel trade due to the contro
versy over prices trustworthy reports
concur that leading mills are operat
ing at a comparatively high rate of
capacity.
Shipping, oils and metals were gov
erned by influences applicable to
those issues, but the breaking off of
tie Mercantile Marine deal, uncer
tain Mexican conditions and further
readjustment of the market for cop
per exerted no perceptible effect.
Rails were the prominent feature of
the late dealings, their strength sug
gesting something mor etangible than
a raiJ against the shorts. Buying of
transportations of the investment
class was almost without precedent
in the varied movements' of the past
six weeks.
Rapid absorption of tne notes offer
ed by the war finance corporation
testified to the underlying strength
of tho investment maritet, which is
soon to be put to a greater test by
the inauguration of the "Victory"
loan.

SCIENTIFG FIRING
PRACTGED IN MINES
OF WARREN DISTRICT
Employes Classified as to
Service, Dependents and
Citizenship
. ?
A party of women were being shown
over an industrial piant by the gen
ial Irish foreman and one admiringly
Asked : ,
"And do you have charge of all of
this, o do with It as you please, to
hire and discharge men as you wish?
"Sure," replied the foreman, and to
prove the truth of his statement, he
called:
"Jimmie, come here. "You're
fired!"
This is typical of the old method
oX "firing." .
, During the period of the war when
. labor was scarce, the bmimess of em
ployment manager in industry was
hiring, hiring men and carefully plac
ing them where they were best fitted
to work. The careful selection of em
ployes had developed to a consider
able extent before the war, and was
. becoming a recognized science.
The "Firing" Problem
In the last few months, however,
th ecancellatlon of copper contracts,
the accumulation of large stocks, the
necessary, curtailment of production,
because the copper could not be sold,
and the lack of any Immediate pros
pects of the copper market opening,
have lead to a universal reduction
of force,, and the problem that the in
dustry now confronts is that of "fir
ing,'' rather than hiring. The prob
lem has been aggravated by the can
cellation of contracts In many war
Industries with the consequent turn
ing loose of hundreds of thousands
of men, a great amount of unemploy
ment, and the return of the soldiers
and sailors. ,
The problem has now become one of
"firing' with the leas: hardship and
the least Injustice, and yet caring for
the returning soldiers, sailors and ma
rines, who have been in the service of
Uncle Sam for nearly two yearB, and
who have suffered the supreme sac
rifice.
Employes Classified
The Copper Queen branch of the
Phelps Dodge corporation operating
at Bisbee, Ariz., found it necessary,
along with all of the other copper
companies of the country, to reduce
materially its force. In making this
reduction employes were classified
with, respect to dependents .length of
service and citizenship. The question
of individual efficiency or workman
ship did not enter into this classifi
cation. Copper produced to sell at 26 cents
a pound has been selling at under 15
cents and vgJX, little copper is being
sold at'-ari. Practically every copper
producer In the country has enormous
Stocks on-hand ,and without a doubt
if. would be profitable in the sense of
taking no less for many of them to
close down entirely. It has been im
possible lo reduce wages to the basis
of the price of copper, for such re
duction would bring the wage scale
'below the cos tof living. It wold obviously-
cause hardship to stop the
work altogether and throw out of em
ployment a large number of employes
who have worked loyally for the com
pany for 'a considerable time, and it
would disturb the labor situation
greatly by increasing the number of
unemployed.
It, therefore, became necessary to
reduce the output to as low a point
as possible and still maintain reason
able costs, and yet retain in the em
ploy of the company men who have
put in years of faithful service. In
many cases it has not been possible
to place these men in actual operat
ing work, and they have been put on
development, as development work
has not been eliminated, in spite of
the fact that it could be done cheaper
at a later date, and that some of the
Phelps Dodge properties have devel
opment so far, ahead of actual mine
operations that they could afford to
stop such work for a considerable
period.
As one of the features of its em
ployes' representation, the Copper
Queen maintains a welfare committee,
composed of nine men, elected annual
ly by the employes, who represent
various divisions of thrf ;plant and
mine. For days this committee met
with the superintendent, the foremen,
the employment manager and the ser
vice record clerk and studied Individ
ually the record of. every man as to
his continuity of service, his depend
ents, citizenship and reliability. With
the records of every man before them
the result was a careful classification
of all employes.
Class 1 consists of all old employes
who have been In the service of the
company over two years, who have de
pendents, and who are citizens of the
United States. This class also covers
old employes of the company who are
Bearing the time when they will be
eligible for a pension, without citizen
ship being taken into account, for it
waa considered that their pensions
had no relation to their citizenship,
and that it would b (ean injustice to
classify otherwise men whose long
service had entitled them to the priv
ilege of retiring shortly with an income.
HOW TO HANDLE OIL
WELL WILDCATTING
EXPLAINED BY REQUA
Director of Oil Division for
U. S. Tells Method of
Protecting Buyers
By Mark L. Requa
Director Oil Division, U.
Administration
S. Fuel
The problem of wildcat oil wells Is
an important one and cannot be light
ly dismissed.
A wildcat well is a well drilled in
undeveloped territory without any
certainty of finding' oil. A company
organized for the purpose of drilling
such a well is called a wildcatling
company. A man engaged in the drill
ing of such a well is called a wild
catter. These terms are not discred
itable, but tbjey are generally used
as indicative perhaps' of the uncertain
ty surrounding such operations. '
By far the largest proportion of
wildcat wells are failures, some peo
ple even going so far as to say that
90 per cent of the strictly wildcat
wells are negative in result. The 10
percent . remaining, however, is the
foundation upon which the petroleum
industry of this country is built.
. uv,t mj J icgiumaic item
open to the promoter who wildcats
with the hope of big profits through
final success. Operations of this kind
are frequent through the organiza
tion of small comrsnies and by the
personal activity of the promotei
among immediate friends and ac
quaintances, and to a certain extent
with the aid of newspaper advertis
ing. Such, promotion should be en
couraged; the operations are usually
conducted openly and above-board,
with the final profit depending upon
the success of the enterprise.
On the other hand, there are great
abuses through irresponsible promot
ers using advertising space freely, is
suing extensive prospectuses and ex
aggerating statements, and presum
ing that there! s no opportunity for
failure. In many of these cases, even
with the possible success of the well
drillingT the investor' has very little
chance forf ;the return of his capital.
As a general proposition, I believe
that any prospective investor who has
been told the whole truth as to the
company whose stock he Is purchasing
should be permitted to make the in
vestment if he cares to take the
chance. Of course the important fac
tor here is that he should be told the
whole truth, and this is seldom ever
done in ordinary oil advertising. The
promoter should discuss fully the
stock authorized by his. company, in
dollars and shares; how much pro
motion stock was issued and what
value; the nature and terms of con
tract for land, setting forth prices
to -be:-, paid, tc, as well as the -promotion
stock issued to the promoters.
The amount or amounts to be paid
for selling the stock should be dis
closed; the amount expended for ad
vertising, fees, and similar expenses
not directly connected with drilling
should bed isclosed and agreed upon.
It might be wise to Insist upon the j
promoter escrowing his stock and be-j
ing prevented from selling it until '
after the property is on a paying i
basis.
In other words, we should limit the
possible profits to promoters, and
make a full and truthful statement
absolutely a prerequisite to the grant
ing of any permit. And I am inclined j
to believe that promoters should not
be permitted to sell any of their
shares until the concern is a suc
and marines, whether they have been
in the employe of the company for one
month or a period of years. This
classification along with the rule that
all honorably discharged soldiers,
sailors and marines who worked for
the company before the war should
be given employment, even though the
forces were being curtailed ,gives dis
tinct preference to those men and will
greatly relieve the problem of the re
turning soldier in the Warren district.
Classes Three and Four
Class 3 Includes old employes who
have worked continuously for over
two years, who are without depend
ents. There are many men working
in mining camps wh ohave families
elsewhere, and these men are put in
the) above class provided tfhey are
American citizens. Class 3 also In
cludes the younge remployes who
haveworked continuously since Jan
uary 1, 1917, and who have depend
ents. In this class also are placed
old employes who have dependents,
but "who are not citizens.
Class 4 covers the men who have
worked 18 months and who have de
pendents and citizenship. It also in
cludes some Austrians and Germans
who had made the first move towards
securing citizenship, but who were de
prived of the right to make their
final application during the war, pro
vided they had dependents, and had
shown evidence of desiring citizenship.
Class 5 includes
