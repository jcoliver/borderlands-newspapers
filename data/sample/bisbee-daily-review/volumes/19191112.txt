of Germany's Surrender
SEATTLE, Nov. 11. About 8
o'clock the mob - surrounding the
Centralia jail succeeded in getting
one of the I. W. W.'s arrested out of
the jail and into an automobile, rush
ing him away before the guards
could prevent, telephone reports here
said.
At 7:30 tonight the city's lights
suddenly were cut off and a volley
of shots ranged down Spearl street.
It was during this period that the
prisoner was taken from jail and
spirited away. He was rushed to
ward a nearby wood and at last ac
counts the crowd had disappeared
therein with him.
According to a report telephoned to
the Associated Press here tonight
from the Centralia Chronicle, the
mob took the alleged I. W. W. from
jail, escorted him to a point just out
side the city limits and hanged him
on a bridge on what is known as the
old Chehalis military bridge.
Ben Casagranda, one of the men
shot in today's clash, died tonight at
the Centralia hospital.
CENTRALIA, Wash., Nov. 11.
Two former American soldiers, War

killed here today and half a dozen
other service men were wounded
when persons believed to be Indus
trial Workers of the World fired on
an Armistice Day parade of former
soldiers, sailors and marines. Ben
Casagranda, Centralia real estate
man, at first reported dead, was alive
early tonight. He was wounded se
verely. Early tonight a mob carrying ropes
surrounded the Centralia jail, where
six Industrial Workers of the World,
arrested after the shooting, were
confined. The jail was guarded by
former soldiers who had donned
their uniforms todav for the parade.
Other former soldiers were doing
picket duty tonight in all parts of
the city.
Early tonight the list of wounded
stood as follows:
" Dale Hubbard, Centralia, shot four
times, probably will live.
George Stevens, Centralia.
Jacob Phitzer, Chehalis.
J. E. Watts, Chehalis.
E. Eubanks, Chehalis.
The firing started when the pa
rade, proceeding down Tower ave
nue, Centralia's main street, parsed
the corner of second avenue, where
the I. W. W. hall is located. Just
as the marchers reached the hall two
former soldiers stepped from the line
and started for the hall doorway,
witnesses declared. Immediately
shots came pouring from the roofs of
the nearby buildings.
Grimm, leading a company of men,
dropped in his tracks, mortally
wounded. McElfresh, marching in
the ranks, was killed instantly. Oth
ers, wounded, fell to the pavement.

of Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, read
at the formal opening of the con

Women here tonight.
Mrs. Catt, president of the National

sent her speech.
Gov. Frederick D. Gardner of Mis

Hubbard gathered a small number
of men together and started in pur
suit of an armed I. W. W. The fugi

ing and shooting at the men as he
ran. The pursuers, all unarmed,
dodged behind telephone poles and
trees to escape the bullets. They
finally drove the man into a Viver
bed, where he took refuge behind
a clump o bushes. As the men
came up he fired', wounding Hub
bard. Immediately after the shooting a
crowd of spectators and marchers
seized a man they believed to be
the ringleader of the I. W. W. They
put a rope around his neck, threw
the rope over the cross arm of a
telephone pole and started to haul
him up. He was in the air only a
few minutes before the chief of po
lice prevailed upon the crowd to let
him down. Tonight the man was in
jail here, nearly dead. Later the
mob ransacked the I. W. W. hall, tore
out the front of the building and
made a bonfire of the furniture and
inflammatory literature found there.
At 6:30 o'clock the crowd In front
of the jail "had swelled fo between
two and three hundred persons, in

Frequent yells of "Lynch them!."
were heard. Determined ex-service
men armed with high-powered rifles
surrounded the jail while others,
armed and not armed, took up the
search of the surrounding district,
bent on rounding up all suspected
radicals wherever found.
Local business men and city offi
cials attempted to quiet the crowd
by making speeches in front of the
jail.
SEATTLE, Wash., Nov. 11. To

attempted to "invade" Everett to

Beard, Everett sheriff", and a number
of armed men were at the dock when

Wisconsin Representative Is
Applauded When He As
serts Government Control
Not Solution to Problems
WASHINGTON, Nov. 11. Expres
sions of opposition in the house to
day to government ownership of rail
roads drew applause from both Dem
ocratic and Republican members,
when debate on the house railroad
regulation bill began again.
"After hearing proponents of the
Plumb plan for government owner
ship, with employe operation, the
committee was convinced that gov
ernment ownership was not and never
can be the solution of the, railroad
problems." declared Representative
Esch, ' Wisconsin, chairman of the
interstate commerce committee,"
which framed the measure.
The only suggestion of the trans
portation problem as a 1920 cam
paign issue was raised by Represen
tative Sims of Tennessee, ranking
Democratic committeeman. While
supporting the committee plan, ex
tension of the authority of the inter
state commission, Mr. Sims reserved
the right to offer a substitute later
proposing continuance of government
control until the end of 1921.
"By that time the campaign will
have passed, the congress will have
been elected, labor will have gone
through its reorganization and so
will Wall Street," he said.

facing an acute fuel situation.
At least 200 families are totally
without coal, and there is not a
pound of surplus fuel in the city.
The creamery is entirely out, and the
packing plant has only enough for a
few days. -
Even if the miners go back to work
immediately it will be several days
before supplies of coal sufficient to
meet the demands can reach Chey
enne. Governor Carey tonight took offi
cial cognizance of the situation, issu
ing a proclamation warning residents
of the state that the apparent ending
of the strike would mean little to
Wyoming unless conditions return to
normal immediately.
"The supply will never catch up
with the demand." he said, "unless
every miner goes back to work and
unless every person conserves fuel."

SENATE TALKS
BUT THE PACT
Seven Hours Discussion Ends
With Treaty No Nearer Rat
ification Than When Came
Up Several Weeks Ago
WASHINGTON, fcov. 11. The
peace treaty drifted j into the dol
drums again today, the senate talk
ing for seven hours and accomplish
ing nothing. J
Tonight each side was blaming the
other for the delay and hopes of I
winding up the whole treaty fight
this week were waning rapidly. Tech
nically the committee reservation to
article ten of the league of nations
covenant was before the senate, but
the debate was aboift almost every
thing else. - Starting' with the Mor
mon religiot, it shifted to the four
teen points, and culminated in a long
speech by Senator Reed, Democrat,
of Missouri, assailing the administra
tion's war policy.
The immediate pending business, a
motion by Senator Walsh, Democrat,
of Montana, to amplify the committee
reservation, scarcely was mentioned.
Although some of . the irregular Re
publicans continued to regard it as
a trick to load down the reservations
with obnoxious features, others of
that group were understood to favor
its adoption and the leaders thought
the vote would be very close.
Senator Reed read to his Demo
cratic colleagues from the Democrat-
ic campaign text book of 1916 to sup -
oort his claim that the party's claim I
for re-election was based upon a pol-,
icy of non-interference in European

WASHINGTON, Nov. ll. Two
events 'of national importance not on
the arranged program the arrival of
the Prince of Wales as the guest of
the nation and President's Wilson's
leaving his bed for the first time
since illness forced him to abandon
his speaking tour last month
marked the celebration of Armistice
day in Washington. A general feel
ing of relief in official circles over
the decision of the soft coal miners
to rescind the strike order was an
other high point in the day set apart
to commemorate the ending of hos
tilities in the great war.
Tonight a chorus of community
singers gathered on the steps of the
treasury, across from the White
House to serenade Mr. Wilson. The
president had planned some days in
advance to leave his sick bed today
as in some measure his own com
memoration of Armistice day and
reposing in a wheel chair was able
to hear a part of the program ar
ranged by the singers in his honor.
Formal expressions as to the day's
meaning is not only American but
world history, were sent to the coun
try by the president, cabinet offi
cers. Generals Pershing and March
and other officials. Secretary Dan
iels talked to wounded soldiers at
Walter Rfid military hospital.

Canada Wants U. S.
To Supply Box Cars
MONTREAL, Nov 11 Prompt ship
ment of 2,500 Canadian Pacific box
cars from the United States to relieve
the Canadian shortage is being sought
by the dominion government. Refer
ring to a Washington announcement
that the large number of Canadian
cars in the United States was due to
the coal strike, the Canadian railway
war board asserted today that since
the first of the year the average num
ber of Canadian cars in the United
States was 45,067, while the number
of United States cars in Canada was

REFEREE AWARDS DECISION TD
FRANK LOUGHHEY AFTER HARD
PAST BATTLE
By F. F. M.
After 1ft rounds of hard and aggres
sive fighting at Warren park yester
day afternoon. Frank Loughery, the
Philadelphia Bearcat, won a decision
over Russell Chambers of Douglas.
The bout was the main event in a
four-card program which had been ar
ranged by the L. S. Kngle. Jr., post
of the American Legion, as a part of
its Armistice day celebration, and
vas one of the chief features of the
day's festivities.
The battle appeared to many as
substantiating to almost ' the limit
.contentions that Chambers lacks a
punch. ' Chambers' lip, .which had
been uut recently, was opened again
by Loughery, while Loughery's lip,
which was in almost the same condi
tion as that of his opponent, was
hardly touched during the encounter.
Chambers face was swollen after the
bout, while Loughery was unmarked.
Other reasons, however, and more
pertinent ones, may be taken from
the last five fights in which Cham
bers and Loughery have , figured in
the Warren district. In his first bout
w ith Loughery, Chambers won the de
cisiou, when it was patent to all the
world that Loughery was not in con
dition. Their second match was a
draw, and now Loughery comes back
with a clean victory. When Lough
ery fought Johnnie Celmars at the
Grand theater, the battle was a pure
draw, with Loughery giving- Celmars
tit for tat through 10 of the warmest
rounds ever twitnessed here, while
Chambers, although he got a draw
with the same slugger, did not inflict
half the damage that Loughery did,
while, in the opinion of many, Cel
mars would have put him away in
another minute.
A feature cf the fight was the fact
that Loughery had stolen a leaf from
the notebook of Johnnie Celmars, and
slipped over left swings to the htad
and jaw while he was eithct in a
clinch or just coming out of one. In
addition, he did the greater part of
the loading, he was the more aggres
sive, and he had Chambers worried
during every round. Loughery's long
suit in the ringj is : his willingness to
fight, and it was this willingness, or
even anxiety, to get at close quarters,
that not only took, away from Cham-'
bers much of hi3 hitting power, but
which also made the latter's ' rabbit i
punch" abortive of result.
Both boys fought hard. Chambers
played continually for his opponent's
body, landing at times with a thud,
while Loughery played for the head
and jaw, and especially Chpmbers'
lip, which had been cut in his fight
with Celmars last Friday, ana -which
opened up in the first round. Th
fight was also clean, with both scrap
pers trying hard and honestly for a
' decision. ' It was practically on a par
with the last two Celmars battles
here, which are considered the best
to have been staged here In months,
in which both Chambers and Lough
ery were given draws with the Los
Angeles welterweight.
The battle opened up with Lough
ery leading as soon as the boys had
shaken hands, and before many sec
onds he had Chambers guessing.
Loughery played continually for the
head and face of Chambers, rockiug
his head back with overhand jabs,
and ending the session"" with a clear
margin. In the second round Lough
ery repeated. Chambers by this time
wa3 bothered, countering Loughery's
jabs with hooks to the body and short
uppercuts which, however, did not
slow the Bisbee boy's tactics in the
slightest. Tho third round was a
repetition of the first two, with
Loughery piling up a definite lead,
while his aggressiveness 1 became
more apparent every moment.
In the fourth round Chambers took
the lead with three or four hard
swings to ' Loughery's mid-section,
which the Bearcat found it impossible
to avoid . Chambers continued this
through the round, meeting Lough

ery's jabs to the face with counters
to the stomach and ribs, and opening
up his "rabbit punch," which, how
ever, did not have the steam behind
it that showed in his former bouts
with the Bisbee fighter. This round
was even.
The fifth round went to Loughery
by a shade. In the sixth, Chambers
rushed Loughery as the bell sounded,
swinging to the stomach and catch
ing Loughery with the "rabbit punch''
as he ducked. Loughery came back
with straight jabs to the face, varied
by-left swings to the jaw as he came
up from the blows on the back of
his neck. This was the most spec
tacular round " of the fight, with
Loughery's newly learned trick of
catching Chambers with a left swing,
often rocking the latter's head. The
round was Loughery's.
. The seventh round was tame, with
both boys evidently tired, and contin
uing a series of taps to the head and
stomach. Even Stephen. The eighth
went to Loughery by a mile. Start
ing with the gong, he fought .Cham
bers off his feet, carrying the fight
with never a hint of a let-up, and
forcing his opponent throughout the
session. In the ninth, Loughery took
the lead again, while Chambers
showed bad judgment in his' swings,
and the "rabbit punch" had lost all
its kick. He still had plenty of fight
left, however, and landed several
stiff ones to Loughery's mid-section,
but not in sufficient quantities or
force to offset the latter's swings to
the jaw or jabs to the nose and
mouth. The round was Loughery's.
The tenth and last round w?s even,
with Chambers fighting hard from
the tap of the bell, but met at every
stage by Loughery's bulldog desire to
be in the htick of the mixing. Cham
bers repeatedly tried the "rabbit
punch," with Loughery surprising
the spectators with his cleverness in
coming up with hard swings after
he had been beaten almost to his
knees, and landing heavily on Cham
bers' head and jaw.
The decision was made by Referee
Jack McDonald of El Paso, who ref
ereed all the afternoon's bouts.
In the semi-final "Johnnie Meyer
met. in the person of Frankie Fowser
of El Paso, not only the cleverest
man to face him in his career, but
perhaps the cleverest and cleanest
hilLl.iK boxer that has appeared in
the Warren district in many moons.
Fowser looked like pur class yester
day afternoon, while Meyer showed
a better knowledge of boxing than
even his friends gave him credit for.
The draw decision was the only one
that could have been given. Meyer
showed the same coolness that has
distinguished him in his other ap
pearances here, while Fowser was
unable to plant the haymaker which
he so evidently carries.
The preliminaries were tame. Kid
Frenchie and Kid Hansen, local boys,
met in the curtain-raiser. Frenchie
stepped out in the first and second
rounds, putting his opponent to the
canvas in the latter, but not with
sufficient force to get him anything,
and in the third Hansen came back
and put Frenchie -away for the count
with a pretty and neat little clip to
the jaw.
Kid Higgins of Bisbee stepped into
Kid' turns of Lowell in the second
preliminary as if he were going to
knock his block off without any hesi
tancy, but Burns took exception to
this and handed more raps 'to Hig
gins jaw. in 30 seconds than Higgins
thought were in . the known world.
Then Burns took one healthy swing
that was loaded to the guards with
morphine, and Higgins went to sleep.
Burns has a very neat way of hand
ling himself, and carries a punch
that starts from his shoulder with
out any frills. He boxes neatly, and
with handling should prove a good
addition to local fistic circles.
The newly organized band of the
American Legion was in attendance
throughout the card, and repeatedly
won the plaudits of the crowd by
their renditions. The timekeepers
for all the fights were "Red" Gannon

with several ' points to spare, the
squad of pigskinners from the Nine
teenth infantry went down to defeat
yesterday morning before a crowd es
timated' at more than 2,000. The
final score was 16 to 7.
Sensational open field running by
Captain Abbott, the soldiers' star
quarterback, and ' Benton and Lau
renson, of the Legion team; the line
pluneinsr of Olson- and Thomas and
lilt; ucatu ti'l- liiiiLLi& ui ynpiaiii
Cochrane were outstanding features
of the game. The Legion's .line also
did good work, always holding the
hard plunging soldiers whenever the
goal was threatened.
For the first few minutes of play
it looked as though the local squad j
was an easy winner, the soldiers re-
ceiving the first kickoff and after !
failing to gain the required ten yards j
in three down punted to Bisbee. By
right and left end runs and line j
plunging the Legioners carried the !
ball to the 20 yard line and Thomas i
kicked over for the first three points.
Bisbee again kicked off and p.jrain'!
the infantry aggregation failed to j
make the gains, once more punting. ;
The local efeven started down the :
field again with the soldiers making :
vain efforts . to stop them. When '
within 40 yards of the visitors' goal
the latter started to hold and when
io
Fn
om then until the last of the
third quarter things looked rather un
favorable to the Legion backers. The
soldiers tightened and "Bisbee was
powerless to break through their de
fense. During the early part of this
quarter the soldiers were in posses
sion of the ball most of the time,
only the inevitable goal post rally
preventing touchdowns on several oc
casions. During the last few minutes , of
play in the third quarter the ex-service
men asserted their prowess and
continually made long gains on for-!
ward passes, end runs and line j
plunges. Dame fortune took a hand, I
this time giving her support to the !
locals when Benton, sneaked through
the soldiers' line and after dodging j
the few men playing back, carried
the ball to within a few yards of the j
goal. While Benton deserves credit i
for the way in which he eluded his '
pursurers, nevertheless his getting '
away from the massed players wa3 j
considered a "fluke." Bisbee made
its first touchdown a few minutes j
later when line plunges carried the ;
ball across the line. After kicking
goal Bisbee led by three points.
The Legioners second touchdown
came near the end of the game and
wa3 an earned score in every sense
of the word.- Trick plays, long end
runs, line plunges and alU the strat
egy of seasoned gridiron warriors
were put into play and about all the
visitors could do was line up and
watch their opponents tear by them.

THE PRICE IS NOT
THE MOST
important consideration of an automobile, but VALUE
IS. This sums up the policy of the Dort Motor Com
pany in perfecting the DORT CAR. The price of the
DORT is not PROHIBITIVE, but it is sufficient to
include important features that cheaper cars do not
have. At the same time it is much lgwer in price than
other cars which possess those features. It will, there
fore, satisfy the purchaser who has paid more for a
car in the past, while to him who has paid less it will
prove an unexpected revelation.
A VISIT TO THE BISBEE AUTO COMPANY
to inspect the newly arrived DORT CARS will well
repay the prospective automobile purchaser.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
'Bettoi to wear out than to rust out."
Bishop Cumberland.
THE LEGION AS HOST
THE residents of the Warren District were the guests of the ex
service men of L. A. Engle, Jr., post of the American Legion
yesterday, and thousands who enjoyed the various features of
the diversified Armistice Day program went to bed some time
after midnight this morning warmly praising the brand of hospitality
offered. The Legion men proved ideal hosts and henceforth may be
counted on as a big social factor in the district.
From the opening of the program with the parade at 9:30 o'clock
in the morning until the last handful of confetti was thrown at mid
night, there was not a dull moment, and not a single unpleasant
incident or accident marred the day's success. The thousands or
spectators and merrymakers, including hundreds of visitors from out
side the district, were expertly handled, without friction, inconve
nience or delay to any.
In every particular the boys of the Bisbee Legion post yesferday
showed that they know how to do things. Their organization,
through their entertainment committee, was excellent, and reflected,
no doubt, the benefits in this respect of their army training.
The thanks of the district are due the entertainment committee
of L. A. Engle, Jr., post, and every man in the post, both soldier and
sailor, not only for the splendid program provided, but for the highly
efficient, skilful and harmonious manner in which every reature of
it was carried out.
SLACKERS IN WORK
IV an editorial in the Gallup Herald, a printer-publisher, doing a
dozen hours daily of mechanical labor, tells workmen that the
way to make the world better and help all the people including
themselves, is to go back to work where they were receiving
i rein ?3 to ?10 per day, six days in the week, for eight hours of daily
labor, and were content and useful to the world until called to idle
ness by eastern leaders whose grievances, if they have cause, are
not duplicated in New Mexico.
Us work that makes the wcrld go round, makes men better than
animals that exterminate one another. . Here is the Herald comment
a-.ade at the rUhi. lime and place, though applicable to all localities
and to all men who desire to be of service to mankind.
What is wanted now is work steady, earnest work.
We have been engaged in wholesale, world-wide waste. L'ntil
we have replenished .that which we have wasted, there will be a
shoitage and high prices.
Anyone engaged in everything to retard our work of rebuilding
and replenishing should be forced to work or leave our shores.
There is no pther .way out no other way to make good.
Labor leaders and sociological thinkers are crawling through the
small end of the horn in their efforts to solve the problems steering
their constituencies wrong. They are trying to make .the public bef
fieve the remedy lies in shorter hours, shorter days of production.
The whole world is short on produced articles, then to lessen
production is the wrong way out. We should produce more instead
of less. We should work more instead of less. We don't mean that
workmen should work more and get less. Every man is entitled to
just compensation. No man is entitled to that which he does not
produce. Every man should be willing to work. . No man should be
allowed to idle.
All of us can't dig coal, copper, silver, gold or potatoes. Some of
us must be merchants, bunkers, preachers, printers, and so on. The
woild is the vineyard of the Lord and everyone of us should be doing
something in this big round vineyard.
This is no times for strife and turmoil.
Th'is is no time to harbor llussian'sm, I. W. W.ism or anarchism.
THE GOVERNMENT IS SUPREME
EERY general approval will be given to the prompt and decisive
action of Judge 'Anderson of the federal district court at In
dianapolis, commanding the officers of the United Mine Work
ers union to cancel the order of October 31 calling a genera!
strike of bituminous coal miners. The court upholds the contention
of the government that the strike order was in violation of the federal
food and fuel act nd declares that it was not only illegal but that
under the circumstances it approached rebellion, says the Globe
Record.
The order allows no chance for quibbling or delay, but must be
complied with in strict accordance with the explicit instructions of
the court, which fixes the dale for the termination of the strike at
the various mines when the order of cancellation is received, which
will not be later than Wednesday.
It is a relief to know thwt the strike which has already seriously
curtailed the production of coal, and which inevitably would have
caused great suffering to many people if continued much longer, will
be spe'.-dily ended. Attorneys for the mineis have intimated that
they will take the case to the United States circuit court or appeals
in Chicago, but such action will not affect the injunction proceedings
nor the government's plan to ask that the injunction be made per
manent on November 20; and as the court's order to call off the
strike must be cafiied out, there appears to be reasonable assurance
that the production of coal will be quickly resumed and not again
interrupted.
Certain labor leaders said that the course .taken by the govern
ment in obtaining a "re-training order" against, the uniop officials
in the 'coal strike "introduces something new" into the industrial
situi'ti'on. Attorney General Palmer admitted that "the facts are
without precedent," but he; also said that "if the government cannot
protect itself in a case like this, we had better find it out now." And,
doubtless, union officials will find in Judge Anderson's order "some
thing new" recognition that the right of the nation is superior to
the right of any group.
The chief virt ue of the course now being taken by I he govern
ment is its courage. It displays a recognition of the supremacy of
the common interest u. against Hie cla'iiiH of a class interest. A
deiuonstiaiiou of this kind was needed. There was no other apparent
way in which Mie demonstration could bo given, and it. is to be hoped
that in the end it will prove effect ivj.
Railroad men want time and a half pay as a "punitive measure."
Every increase in pay is a punitive measure so far as the public is
concerned.
When a man must choose between his theoretical rights and his
immediate and urgent needs, it doesn't take him long to get his coat
off and go to work.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 11. Up betimes but missed the parade, which my wife did not,
und so made my own breakfast, which was very good, although the eggs
boiled very hard .and the coffee had a peculiar taste, so that I experimented
with a second potful, but did not improve it much, so I filled the cup with
milk and gulped it down, getting an omelet down town before I went to"
work.. The town very quiet, but some talk of the football game, where the
telegraph editor had his best girl and a clean shave, and I pitied him for
having to get up so early for the fascination of a silk skirt and a fall haty
being a bald-headed man myself and knowing that all is not complexion
that blooms like a peach. Tp fight headquarters, where I heard much dis
cussion about the bouts on Nov. 21, when they say there is to be a grudge
fight with plenty of action, so I resolved to be there. To the girls at the
cigar stand which they have just opened, where I spent a couple of dimes
and found them very pleasant, but I attempted no persiilage, being mindful
of what happened yesterday. To Miss Ford, the good-looking truancy officer
with the high boots, who gave me her report for the month and told me of
her work and also her first name, but this was only for the news story.
Thence to the Y. W., where I had a pleasant visit and recited some poetry.
Tc the prize fights at Warren, which I enjoyed hugely, and so the office,
where I v.rote much and then to bed, thinking of the verses that I had
written -about Los Angeles, and thinking how very true they were just at
the time when my thin shanks hit the sheets, which, while they were snowy
white, were also snowy-cold.

CATTLE AND BABIES
Horse and cattle breeders u-rning

their animals "registered." It adds
to their value and is therefore justly
regarded as highly desirable.
Contrasting this attitude with that
of careless physicians and parents, tne
public health service gives the follow
ing reasons why baby's birth should be
registered.
1. To establish identity.
2. To prove nationality.
o. To prove legitimacy.
4. To show when the child has a
right to enter school.
5. To show when the child has the
right to seek employment under the
child labor law.
6. To establish the right of inheri
tance to property.
7. To establish liability to military
duty, as well as exemption therefrom.
8. To establish the right to vote.
9. To qualify to hold title to, and to

STOCK REVIEW
NEW YORK, Nov. 11. The tower
ing speculative structure in the stock
market, reared by professional Inter
ests in the last month on a founda
tion of "easy money," toppled over
today, when call loans rose to 25 per j
cent, the year's highest figure, and
the maximum since December 27,
1907.
Losses of 5 to almost 20 points
were sustained by many leaders in
the recent rise, especially steels,
equipments, motors and oils. Numer
ous other industrials wnrch accom
panied the October . boom " also
crumbled in today's convulsive move
ment. Almost the only stock to escape the
drastic liquidation were United States
Steel, which lost only a fraction of a
point, and the high grade railway
shares. . ,
The reaction was the more violent
and sweeping because it followed an(
opening advance of 2 to 6 poinvi,
based on the calling off of the coal
miners' strike. In point of fact, that
development exerted only temporary
influence, prices falling back within
the first hour. Even before call loans
opened at 14 per cent, the year's

a thorough theoretical and practical
training in machinist lines, at the
government's expense.
At the end of 56. week he is rated
as a second class petty officer, and
paid $55.50 a month. At the comple

ana paia I66.C0. He is then sent to
a naval aviation station. On his ar
rival there his pay is Increased 50
per cent, for flight duty, or to $99.75.
This sum is pure "velvet." as all his
living and clothing expenses, his
board and lodging, are paid for him
in addition.
"Out of the young man's three
year enlistment," - says Lieutenant
Kilmer, "he is tBus in school. 18
months, is paid liberally while being
educated at the government's ex
pense, and at the end of his 18
months receives $99.75 a month clear
of all living expenses.
"This is the kind of education of
fered; it will fit the young man not
only for naval aviation, but it will
fit him to take charge of any ma
chine Bhop in the country. The
equipment he uses while in school is
of the best. We use no worn-out
"V'..r "::motors equipment.; it
costs the government from $300 , to
that of naval aviation. Secondly.
we are here to interest young men

The recruiting party left San
Diego on August 23. So far Its tour
has completed all states west of the
eastern boundary of Colorado, includ
ing California, Washington, Oregon,
Idaho, Montana, Utah, Wyoming, Col

Panhandle. Lieutenant Kilmer and
his aides are now on the last leg o't
their journey homeward to San

Arizona they have visited prior . to

The reason men of higher type,: of
initiative and ambition, and a solid
educational foundation, are required
for these enlistments, says Lieuten
ant Kilmer, Is because 100 men are
picked from the navy every year to
qualify, by competitive examination,
for entrance to Annapolis.
"Although the aviation branch of
the navy is comparatively very

SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 3. "Pearl!
Pearl! Don't give up yet. Bring my
murderers to justice. They buried my
body on the ranch out of ' Scotia.
Then they built a fire over the grave
to cover up all traces.
"Dig there! You will find my
body!"
The voice of Selma Armour, med
ium, ceased.
From across the black darkness
of the room came a gasping, chock
ing sob. -
Pearl McNutt, wife of W. H. Mc
Nutt, murdered Spokane capitalist,
fell forward in a faint.
"Will! Oh, Will!" she sobbed
when she was revived. "I'll get
them. I'll never rest until they've
been brought to justice."
W. , H. McNutt disappeared from
his home here some time ago.
He announced before leaving that
he was going to settle up some af
fairs with two men and two women,
business associates.
He never returned.
As the days dragged on, Mrs. Mc
Nutt tried every clue.
She appealed to the sheriffs office.
They scoffed at her murder theory
"Your husband's run '; off with ai
other woman," they grinned.
She did not "despair.
She tried the Burns Detective
agency.
That failed also.
She turned, at last, to a medium
Selma Armour.
Together the two women entered
a darkened room.
Selma Armour went into a trance.
Suddenly, above the silence, she
spoke :
"Your husband," she whispered,
"was murdered!
"He was clubbed into insensibil
ity in the Wolverine Hotel.
"Then a towel was stuffed into
his mouth. He was taken down to a
waiting truck. His body was wrap
ped in an old bedspread and then
bound with bailing wire.
"The truck, goes north.
"Now I see a man feverishly dig
ging a hole in damp, sandy ground.
A lantern sheds a feeble ray on the
scene. The man glances fearfully
behind him now and then.
"Then comes the truck. The body
is taken off and dumped into the
hole. It Is doubled up and - thrust
in, because the hole is too small.
"They, shovel back the earth and
build a fire.
"Through the smoke I see them "
"Stop! Stop! For God's sake,
stop!" shrieked Pearl McNutt. "I
can't stand it any longer."
Two days later she appealed again
to the sheriff. She was laughed at.
She appealed to Burns operatives.

All Inquiries regarding enlistments
In this branch of the navy, and all
applications for enlistments, mav be
made at the offices of Chief Quar
termaster G., J. Rome, in the Allfn
minding.
"We don't deal in spooks," they
grinned at her.
Still, she would not give up.
With friendly aid she journeyed
out to the lonely ranch.
The cold ashes of a fire were
found. Trembling, Pearl McNutt
watched while the men dug.
Five feet down they came to an
old bedspread, bound with bailing
wire. ..
They enlarged the hole.
Soon it was large enough to en
able them to extricate .the body.
They snapped . the wire. The bed
spread was unrolled.
In it, tinged by the blood red of
the v fading sun, lay the mangled
body of Will McNutt.
He had been clubbed to death.
A towel gag forced his jaws
apart.
Even as the medium had seen.
Back in the. city the authorities
tardily got to work.
Dark stains in the room at the
Wolverine hotel, where McNutt is
supposed to have met his fate, were
tested by chemists.
They were pronounced blood-stains.
In Los Angeles two women were
caught and charged with complicity
in the murder.
Their brother was rounded up in
another California town, also on the
same charge.
The fourth.-of the quartette is be
lieved to be hiding near Spokane
and is the object of a manhunt.
"We don't deal in spooks," .said
the Burns men.
"Well you see now, maybe "
say the police and sheriff.
"If I have helped Mrs. McNutt
that is my reward. I ask no other,"
says Selma Armour.
"Will! Dear Will, I'll never rest
until your murderers pay the pen
alty," sobs Pearl McNutt.

JN the morning of February 26th, 1779, General Israe

before a mirror in the home of General Meade in Green

the first long, shearing stroke. Suddenly he saw in the glass the
figures of enemy cavalry sent to capture him. Acting for once in
hi3 impetuous life "on reflection", he leaped on his horse, his face
still , white with lather, and escaped down the perilous rocky stair
way on what is now "Put's Hill ;to alarm his soldiers and
disperse the enemy.

THE BISBt . DAILY REVIEW
WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 12, 1919
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONOS
NEW YORK, Nov. 11. Stocks went
down with a crash today, all gains of
the previous month and much more
in a number of instances being sac
rificed in the wave of liquidation
which covered the market in the furi
ously active final hour.
Excepting United States Steel and
representative y railway shares in
which recessios were comparatively
moderate, leaders reacted 5 to almost
40 points. General Motors, conspicu
ous for its recent adance above 400,
broke frcm 386, its best price of the
morning, to 34S1.
Primarily the iolent upheaval was
attributed to recurrent stringency in
the money market. Call loans opened
at the new high of 14 per cent and
held at that price until the last hour,
when 20 per cent was demanded, with
another jump to 25 per cent just be
fore the finish.
To add to the unsettlement further
apprehension was caused by the de
moralized conditions wnlch prevailed
in the market for foreign exchange.
Rates on London, Paris and Rome
fell to new levels of discount and re
mittances to less important European
centers were sympathetically affected.
The market was strong almost to
the point of buoyancy at the opening,
due to calling off of the coal strike.
Sales amounted to 1.900,000 shares,
almost 600.000 of which changed
hands in the last 60 minutes. Bonds
were irregular to heavy. Total sales,
par value, $13,350,000.
GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Nov. 11. Profit taking
by speculators nearly counterbalanced
in the corn market today declines
which had resulted from rescinding
of the strike order to coal miners and
from a return of good weather. The
market closed unsettled, unchanged
to -c higher with December $1.33 to
$1.35. and May $1.26 to $1.26.
Oats gained cc to c. In pro
visions the outcome varied from 10c
decline to 15c advance.
Sellers of corn much more than
outnumbered buyers atjfirst. but con
ditions were almost reversed later.
Calling off of the coal strike was gen
erally construed as bearish, inasmuch
as possibility of the crop movement
being curtailed through lack of fuel
lor railroads was no longer in ques
tion. Active export inquiry gave strength
to oats. In provisions the effect of
weakness of hog values was largely
nullified by late upturns in srain.
COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK, Nov. 11 The cancel
lation of the coal strike order before
the expiration of the government's
time limit was followed by a very
shvp advance in the cotton market
during today's earlier trading. De
cember closed at 3S.15, with the gen
eral list closing easy, net "5 points
higher to 5 points lower.

"I Now Understand Why So Many
People Praise Tanlac,"
Says McGill.
"I have gained thirty pounfls since
I commenced taking this Tanlac, and
haven't felt so well in twenty-five
years," said C. A. McGill, a well
known employe of the Coast Ship
Yards, and who lives at 1043 East
Fifteenth St.. Portland, Ore., while
talking to a Tanlac representative the
other day.
"1 can now understand why so
many people all over the United
States and Canada are publiciy en
dorsing Tanlas," contmued Mr. Mc
Gill, 'for I have tried it myself, and
out of all the medicine and treat
ments I have taken during the past
twelve years, Tanlac is the only thing
that has don me any good at all. I
suffered something awful from
stomach and kidney troubles, and
ver since these troubles began my
condition had gradually grown
worse. Everything I ate soured on
my stomach and 1 would be bloated
up with gas foi hours at a time, and
suffered terribly from shortness of
breath. I had pains in the small of
my back nearly all the time, and
when I stooped over for anything I
could hardly straighten up again. I
seldom ever got a good nignt's rest,
and felt just as tired and worn out
every morning as I did whe I went
to bed at night. In fact, I had a tired,
draggy feeling all the time, and it
just seemed that all my energy had
left me. I suffered from constipa
tion, too, and often had raging head
aches, and finally got to where I
would be completely exhausted if I
walked only a few blocks.
"To tell the truth, 1 was just about
disgusted with medicine, and every
thing else lor that matter, but I had
read so much about Tanlac helping
others that I decided to see what it
would do for me. Well, sir, Tanlac
gave me the surprise of my life, for
by the time I had finished my first
bottle of this medicine I was feeling
like a different man altogether. I
stuck to Tanlac until I had taken
seven bottles, and now you won't find
a healthier or stronger man anywhere
than I am. It is simply wonderful
the way I have gained in weight and
strength. The truth of the matter is,
Tanlac just knocked my troubles
winding, and I am(ln such fine con
dition now that I can do as much
work, in a day as I ever could. I
have a good appetite and eat just
anything that is set before me, and
as much as I want, and I -never suffer
the least bit afterwards. The pains
in my back are a thing of the past,
and so are the headaches, and when
I hit the bed at night I go to sleep
and am dead to the world until time
to get up in the morning. I don t
have to take medicine of any kind
now. but if 1 ever do again, it will cer
tainly be Tanlac. I am buying this
bottle for my wife, as she seems to
be in a badly run down condition, and
I believe Tanlac will straighten her
up all right."
