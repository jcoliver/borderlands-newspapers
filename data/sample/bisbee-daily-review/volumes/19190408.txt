Naval Chief Declares Ameri

Defeat of Hun Submarines
Admiral Given Picturesque
Welcome to U. S.; Greets
Wife and Children First
NEW YORK, April 7. The convoy
system, which many naval men had
termed Impracticable, overcame the
German submarine menace and fig
ured tremendously In the winning of
the war. Rear Admiral William S.
Sims, commander in chief of the Amer
ican navy's forces In European wa
ters, declared today on his arrival here
aboard the British liner Mauretania.
Depth charges and listening devices,
he said, contributed materially to suc
cess in maintaining practically un
broken the trans-Atlantic "bridge" of
transports and supply ships essential
to the allied victory, s did the "mag
nificent work" of the merchant sea
men, who "took their charges across,
convoy or no convoy."
But It4was the convoying scheme,
worked out to a fine detail by the com
bined fleets of the associated powers,
the officer asserted, which made the
transportation and supplying of the
American force whose appearance in
battle with the allies turned the tide
against the 'German invaders on the
western front. - - ,: '

When he left the Mauretania, whoso
passage into the harbor was marked
by a reception as picturesque as it
was eloquent of the nation's and city's
tribute to a homecoming victor, the
rear, admiral boarded the naval yacht
Aramls and stepped into the circle of
his family. Greeting his wife, three
children and three sisters, the officer
smiled happily, declaring that his
greatest regret in connection with the
war was his inability to have his fam

shared with 6000 officers under his
command. ,

greetings extended by representatives
of Rear Admiral Gleaves of the naval
transport service and Rodman Wana
maker, chairman of the mayor's com
mittee on welcome to homecoming
troops.
The Mauretania entered the harbor
in mid-afternoon delayed sine? early
morning by a fog which shrouuded the
coastal waters for many miles. A
great fleet of airplanes, their wings
flashing in the sun which succeeded
the morning's fog, heralded the ap
proach of the transport, bearing the
admiral, his staff and 3000 troops, and
escorted by a flotilla of destroyers and
smaller naval craft. In a din of salutes
from the harbor forts, whistles from
welcoming vessels and cheers of the
officers' former shipmates, the big ves
sel lay to off quarantine while the
trans-shipment took place.
As the admiral stepped aboard the
naval yacht, his flag shot up the main

Draft of Bill Is Requested
WASHINGTON, April .7. Lieuten
ant Colonel Ansell, former acting
judge advocate general, and one of
the leaders over courts martial pro
cedure, has been directed by Secre
tary Baker to prepare and submit a
bill, which, in his opinion would cor
rect deficiencies in the exicting mili
tary justice system. The secretary's
order under date of April 5, was made
public today, by the war department.
At the same time announcement was
made that Secretary Baker had refus
ed for the 'second time to make pub
lic the recent " communication from
Colonel Ansell. replying to statements
made by Major General Crowder,
judge advocate general.
The secretary's order, which is in
th eform of a regular departmental
communication, signed by the adju
tant general through which it was
transmitted, follows:
Secretary's Order
, "The secretary1 of war acknowl
edges the receipt through military
channels, of the first paragraph of the
endorsement made by Lieutenant Col
onel Ansell under date of April 2.
dealing with the subject of proposed
changes in a system of military jus
tice. . The suggestions made by Lieu
tenant Ansell are entirely apparent in
form and substance and merit earnest
consideration, which they will receive.
"With many of the suggestions the sec
retary of war finds himself in hearty
concurrence, if In fact .existing statute
law is defensive m the particular sug
gested by-, the proposed change.
"In order that the subject may be
fully considered and Views of Lien
tenan tColonel Ansell adequately stud
ied it is directed that Lieutenant Col
onel Ansell prepare and submit to the
secretar yof war at the earliest possi
be time the draf tof such a bill as
would, in his opinion, be adapted to
tarry into effect the ideas expressed
in the first paragraph of his endorse
ment "With regard to the second para
graph of the endorsement which calls
for this memorandum, the secretary
of war declines to receive officially
the communication herewith returned.
The communication in question has al
ready been published, and there Is,
therefore, no point in seeking to use
the secretary of war as a medium of
publicity. The resort to personal com
ment in connection with this subject
matter was not ' begun -. by General
Crowder. It plainly would have been
more fitting and appropriate of never
begun by anybody.
. "It has certainly been carried far
enough by everybody. The secretary
of war assumes Lieutenant Colonel
Ansell's earnest desire to concentrate
public attention and official attention
upon the improvement of the syestem
of military justice, and is quite sure
that a single-minded and unbiased
consideration of that subject can best
be assured by the abotement of fur
ther personal discussion and ' unani
mity of effort to work out the best
results for the system which we all
desire to improve."

President Sends for George
Washington ;; ; Wild Ru- .
mors Follow Action
PARIS, April 7. (By the Associat
ed Press. President Wilson's orders
that the United States transport
George Washington proceed immedi
ately to a French port have aroused
much comment here and are even
construed by some officials as pre
liminary to a determined move to force
an agreement at an early date by the
peace conference.
As is usual in such cases, various
rumors were soon in circulation and
before night one was current that
the president had delivered an ulti
matum to the effect that he would
withdraw from the -conference unless
an agreement was reached within 48
hours.
It is confidently asserted by those
close to the president that he did not
contemplate any such action, but the
same authorities have no hesitation
in declaring that the president has
made" his" position plain on the ques
tions at issue, and it is believed his
determination to adhere to this posi
tion is fixed.
The summoning of the George
Washington will place the president
in such a position, it is pointed out,
that, he cannot be embarrassed by
having to wait for the transport
should he wish, owing to failure of the
peace delegates to agree or unwar-.
ranted delay in reaching a settlement
of peace question, to withdraw from
the discussions.
The belief is common that Presi
dent Wilson will not hestitate to take
definite action if a deadlock is actual
ly reached. . . ' ':

owners. The horse originally v had

Project; Demand Right to

BUDAPEST, Sunday, April 6. (By
the Associated Press.) General Jan
j Christian Smuts, the peace conference
representative to Hungary, placed his
proposal before the Hungarian com
munist government Saturday. This in
cluded the following:
"The Hungarian government to
withdraw all troops west of a line
which General Smuts outlined; that
Rumanian troops be ordered not to ad
vance beyond their present positions
and that the territory between the line
drawn by General Smuts and the Ru
j manian army be 'neutral and be 6c
i cupied by British,' French, Italian ana
if possible, American troops.
"That the Hungarian government
accept the terms of the military con-
i vention concluded last November 13,
I by the Hungarian : government with
! the allied powers; that the afore-
mentioned line of demarcation has no
influence on the territorial arrange
ments in the final peace conditions
and that General Smuts will propose
to the peace conference to raise the
blockade of Hungary immediately and
allow facilities for the immediate im
port of prime necessities, especially
fats and coal."
Frontiers Discussed
General Smuts also suggested that
he would propose to the peace confer
ence that before it finally determined
the political frontiers of Hungary it
should invite the Hungarian govern
ment to send representatives to Paris.
These representatives would formu
late their standpoint on the frontiers
and the questions arising from them
in a special conference with represen
tatives of the Caecho-Slovaks, Jugo
slavs, Rumanians and German Austri
ans. A representative of the allied
powerB would be chairman of the spe
cial conference.
The government replied to General
Smuts, thanking him for his civility
but declaring that the conditions pre
sented were unacceptable, except as
an order to those who might be in
clined to ssume the government of
the country effective under such
terms. . ; .' 1
"But," the, government's reply add
ed, "relying on the good will displayed
in such an unaccustomed manner by
you, we beg ypu to interpret the fol
lowing proposals ;to the entente pow
ers: ' ' - v? i
; , Soviet' Stand
;" First, the soviet government also
is disposed to create a neutral zone,
but eolely on the condition that the
frontier thereof is shifted eastward to
the Maros line and that the soviet re
public shall administer without inter
ference in the territory occupied by
the allied troops, thus allowing the
Boviet republic to be re-established in
Ssegedin and Arad. There shall be
free intercourse from the neutral zone
both in the direction of Hungary end
Rumania and free transit in the Tran
sylvanlan territory occupied by Ru
mania. "Second, at the same time we re
quest the complete raising of the
blockade and the supplying of the re
public with coal and fats.
'Third, we request that the pro
posed conference should Include rep
resentatives of the Hungarian soviet
republic, Bohemia, Rumania, Serbia,
Jugo-Slavia and German Austria and
that it meet at the earliest moment
possible at Prague or Vienna, so as to
proceed simultaneously with the peace
conference.

PARIS. April 7. (By the Associat

improvement in his condition, how
ever, is nnounced by the attending
physicians.
PARIS, April 7. (By the Associat
ed Press.) The peace conference has
apparently reached tlje turning point
between definite and speedy results
and further prolonged delays. The
Indications today were toward action,
but new doubts began to appuer as
to whether the desired results could
be accomplished within a fortnight as
Premier Lloyd George and " Colonel
House have predicted.
The council of four was to have
met at 11 o'clockthi s morning at the
"White House." where tlie president
still is confined to bed, but able to
consult with his colleagues in emer
gencies. . It developed, however, that
Premier Lloyd George has been af
fected in a similar manner as the pres
ident which has confined him also to
his bed. A morning session of the.
council was therefore impossible.
Lloyd George Sick.
It was then determined to have the
council meet at Mr. Lloyd George's
residence, so as to be near him. and
here the session besan at 3:3X) this
afternoon with Premier Clemenceau.
Premier Orlando, Colonel House and
all the technical experts present.
Reparations was again the chief is
sue, and it was settled in the main
principle.
One of the American experts
summed up the situation as he left
the meeting, saying: "The chances
are favorable to an agreement, but
we- have not agreed yet."
The principles which seem to be
settled are that reparations and resto
ration shall be in accordance with the
president's seventh and eighth points
and the allies reply to the president's
note and also that the actual damage
and destruction shall be the main
basi3 for etsimating the damages and
that the commission shall formulate
categories or classes of these dam
ages. Payment is to be spread over
a period of years, without a specific
total being fixed and the initial pay
ments probably will be required with
in the first two years. -
: No Agreement Reached.
At the cloae of the council's session
it was stated that no agreement had
been reached on reparations or other
subjects and that discussion on repar
ations would be resumed with Presi
dent Wilson possibly present.
Extreme tension was evident as a
result of today's discussions and It
is believed throughout the conference
that another critical stage has been
reached. One of. the most respon
sible authorities associated with
President Wilson said that he would
not be surprised If American parti
cipation was brought to an early
close if the delays over details were
carried much further. The differ
ences remaining on the subjects of
frontiers and reparations are com
paratively slight, he added, and yet
these slight differences are so per
sistently maintained as to threaten
to create prolonged delays, which the
president and American U!egaton
are not willing to accept. THE BiSBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY, APRIL 8, 1919.

"American farmers wouldn't feed
the food we were given to their hogs,"
according to Ralph E. Ellinwood, vet
eran of the German war who has re
turned to Bisbee after an absence of
nearly two years. (
"It consisted of black bread about
two inches in diameter and alleged
soup made out of cow beets and cab
buge. Oh. it was a lovely menu." He
was speaking of the ration issued to
prisoners in German prison camps.
"We owe our health and. our lives
to the American Red Cross workers."
he continued. "Each month they would
snJ.us 90 pounds -of food per" man.
We didn't have any trouble in getting
the food that was sent to us but over
in the prison camp in C'assel, Ger
many, the men didn't fare as well and
there were many reports of food sent
them being stolen by the German
guards. 1
' In the Chemin-des-Dames sector
where I was taken prisoner 1800 Bri
tish Tommies were captured and they
were put to work behind the German
lines building roads and working on
ammunition dumps. The poor fellows
were so undernourished that six
months later only 187 of them still
lived and they were moved into one ot
the prison camps In the interior ot
Germany.
"Seventy-five of them died the first
ten days. They were in a pitiful
plight. American doctors who examin
ed them said that none of the re
mainder would live more than two
years longer due to undernourishment
and hard labor. A sad looking lot
were those Tommies. '
. Sail in June, 1917
Mr. Ellinwood sailed' for France in
Jane, 1917, and served four months
on an ammunition truck. On October
1 he joined the American army ambu
lance corps and was attached to tlie
French army which was operating on
the Rheims front. Later on his com
pany moved up to the Soissons line
and it was during an engagement on
Mav S, 1918, that the Chemin-des-Dav
s line was shattered by the Huns
unci lie was taken prisoner. On Jan
uary 1, 1919, he was released-from the
Hun prison camp and entered the
American lines, after spending eight
months in the prison.
When questioned concerning the Y.
M. C. A. and the part it played with
the American epedlt'onarJr forces Mr.
Ellinwood said he believed they did
what they had contracted for with the
expeditionary forces.
Did Good Work
"They did a lot Of good worX bp
added, "in simply having huts where
men could congregate and have rec
reation and write letters and have
their entertainments. The organiza
tions dearest to the heart of the dough
boy is the Red Cross and the Salva
tion Army. They performed extraor
dinary work."
According to Mr. Ellinwood the
German people accepted the terms of
the armistice without any cdncern
They were calm he said and seemed
to have adopted themselves to the in
evitable fate which they knew was in
store for them when the French
turned them back at the Marne and at.
Mens in 1914 when Von Kluck ham
mered his way right to the gates of
Paris only to be turned back by the
valient French and what the Germans
called "the contemptible little English
army.'. . '
"There is only one real country," he
said-in conclusion, "and its right here
in my own United States. I'll say
I'm jdad to get back. You bet. It
feels bully."

Nine Machine Gun Crews and 48 Other3 Captured by Small
Band of Americans
By A. E. Geldhof
WASHINGTON', April 7. Ma
chine guns and German howitzers
mean nothing In the life of Cap
tain George H. Mallon of Kansas
' ity. Mo.
Give Captain Mallon a handful
of men and he'd attack the whole
German army and he'd give it a
beating, too.
Captain Mallon commanded a
company of the 132d infantry in
the. battle of the! Meuse last Sep
tember. While his company was
5ghiing its way forward through
the Forges Wood in the midst of
a dense fog, Captain 'Mallon and
nine of his men became separated
from, the rest of the command.
Instead of trying to find his
way back to his company, as most
officers would have done, Mallon
ordered his little army to follow
him, and . they charged forward
into the German machine gun
nests sprinkled through the forest.
One after another the ten men . !
..it tacked nine . enemy machine
Sun crews. Every one of the nine
surrendered to the brave little
band, and not one of the Ameri
cans was killed.
Encouraged by their success.
Captain Mallon and his nine Illi
nois National Guardsmen of the
Thirty-third Division pushed
on through the woods until they
struck a battery of .German 450
mm. howitzers in action.
The German euns were hurline
shell after shell over the heads of
Mallon and his men into the j
American lines. There were four
manned by a dozen Hun soldiers.
Captain Mallon didn't hesitate.
Rushing upon the battery with a
lusty yell, and the 10 Americans
looked like ten hundred to those
scared Germans.
"Kamerad!" yelled most of
. them. But some of them showed
fight and that was what Mallon
had come to France for.
-"towing away his pistol, the
intrepid Missourian sailed in with
his firsts, and before you could
say "Jack Robinson" he had
taught two of. the Boches what
an American uppercut is, and .
taught them so successfully that
the other Huns, seeing what was
coming to them, stuck their hands
in the air and surrendered.
This outfit finished, the little
army pushed on again and ran
into another machine gun nest
with two of the German man-killers
In it. This time Captain Mal
lon decided to employ strategy,
so he deployed his men to the
flanks, while he rhimself . rushed
forward directly in the face of
the fire. Before his men came up
he had silenced those two guns
slnglehanded and captured them
and their crews!
The exceptional bravery dis
played by this plucky Missourian

Palmer to Fight Debs Appeal
on Stand in Federal
League Suit
WASHINGTON, April 7. Three
leaders in organized baseball testified
today in the District of Columbia su
preme court in the fOOO.OOO damage
suit pf the Baltimore Federal league
against the National and American
leagues and certain officials of the de-
funct Federal league.
August Herrmann, chairman of the
national baseball commission, was re
called for cross-examination by coun
sel for the Baltimore club as to the
signing of the "peace pact" and nego
tiations leading up to it. B. Bancroft
Johnson, president of the American
league, and Connie Mack, president of
the Philadelphia American league
club, were the other witnesses.
Mack testified as to relations exist
ing between club officials and players
in organized baseball and cited a num
ber of instances designed to counter
the plaintiffs', charges that organized
baseball was a 'monopoly .and players
were permitted, no prjvileges. The
court room was thrown into an up
roar time and time again by the droH
answers made by Mack during cross
examination. , ' "
President , Johnson denied that the
American - league was operated for
profit afthough the constituent clubs
were so operated. The reserve rule
in players' contracts, attacked by the
Baltimore club as an evidence of mo
nopoly, was said by Mr. Johnson to be
just as essential to baseball clubs as
"coal to a train." .
ASK NEW MEXICO TO
PAVE BORDERLAND
Secretary. Thomas Egan of the War
ren District Commercial club, has sent
an appeal to the New Mexico State
Highway commission,' asking that they
favorably consider expanding the
funds extortioned that state by the
federal' government and those appro
priated by the legislature oh the con
struction of sections of the Border
land highway and thus bring through
this district the bulk of the tourist
traffic that flows back and forth
across the continent. " '
. At present there is 25 miles of
paved highway in' Cochise county and
80 mile3 of graded and surfaced
road now complete. It is Mr. Egan's
contention that if for nothing i more
than an economical standpoint the
money to be expended in New Mexico
should be used in connecting up with
good roads already completed in Co
chise county, thus aiding both Arizona
and the neighboring state, and every
effort will be made to Impress upon
the highway commission the necessity
for co-operation among the two baby
states if they are to mutually enjoy
the benefits that will be derived from
the heavy tourist travel to and from
the Pacific coast!

ment tonight that be would oppose
strongly any effort to obtain executive
clemency for Eugene Y. Debs, the so

PROMINENT AMERICAN
OARSMEN TO ROW IN
INTER-ALLIED MEET
C. D. Wiman, Former Yale
Varsity Captain, Will Lead
Yankee Crew
PARIS, April 7 (By the Associated
Press.) The American crew -which is
to compete in the French inter-allie!
eight-oared race on April 28 -will be
made up of some of the best known
oarsmen of American universities, the
captain being C. D. Wiman, former
Yale varsity captain. Captain Wiman
asks that, inasmuch as merely elimina
tion trials are being held at present
and as therefore the crew which will
appear in the big event has not yet
been picked, the names of the oars
men be withheld until a final selection
has been made.
The race will be over a course of
2300 meters down the Seine, starting
at the Pont Royal and finishing at the
Pont de L'Alma. and passing under
four bridges, including the famous
Alexander Tii bridge.
The obstacles of the race will make
it more spectacular, the space under
the arches on the bridges permitting
only two crews to pass under at a
time. The Pont Royal has only three
arches, at which the cowswains will
have to do some clever jockeying and
maneuvering, and a lively sprint can
be looked for at the take cff.
The crews will use off-center slid
ing seats lapstreak barges with Bel
gian tholes. The boats are somewhat
heavier than those to which American
and English rowing men are accus
tomed. No time was given for yesterday's
trial. The men appeared to be in
fairly good form. '
BRITAIN PLANS TO
BUY BELGIAN CONGO
LONDON, April 7. Britain may
buy the Belgian Congo.
A price of 53,500,000,000 has been
suggested.
Belgian ministers have been in
close conference with the British min
istry of foreign affairs.
Belgium owes Great Britain not
less than $500,000,000., She has a to
tal war debt of not less than fl,500,
000,000. Interest payments on her loans
amount to $2,500,000,000, which is one
sixth of her pre-war revenue. j
Sale of Congo would give Belgium
funds for reconstruction and place
the country on a sound financial basis.

'Pittman's Prides" Prepare to
Make Chicagoans Elxtend
Themselves
By "Biz" B. Phan
Well, folks, here I am again.
Been out Iookin' the local boys
over an', take it from me, they're
.goin' to make the Cubs step
some to beat 'em. See where the
Cubs took three trimmin's out o'
four from the Los Angeles club
last week.. 'Course that don't
signify that the Cubs can't play
ball, 'cause we all know that that
Angel club is right there with the
goods in the early part o' the
season, knocking the ol' pellet
'round like they were big
leaguers, only difference bein
that when the season gets goin
they can't keep up the pace.
Takin it all in all, an' by an'
large, as my ol friend Ccbb would
say, we ought to have a right
smart ball game here next Satur
day. The Cubs right now are in
' almost mid-season form, an the
whole world knows that that is
some fcrm. Pick is swingin' a
wicked club out on the . coast,
cloutin 'cut base 'hits po fast an'
so often the scorers are gettin'
dizzy-tryin' to figure his averages.
The mound .men are twirlin' a
good game, too., the enly loose
place in the club bein' in the fielJ
in' column, an' that's only natural
this time o the year. Take in a
few days, an' they'll have all the
wrinkles ironed out, an' then
there aint any club in the world
they'll have to take off their hat3
too.
Local Boys Work Out
In the meantime, while the
Cubs are cavorting 'round in the
famous Southern California sun
shine, an all that goes with it,
Includin' the luxury of a million
dollar hotel at Pasadena, the War
ren district fellow 3 are gettin
busy. We been havin' a little
baseball weather here ourselves,
an' the collection of ball-tossers
who are goia' to do their best to
show the Chicago birds that they
aren't the only tribe that can
play ball are getting' seme good
workouts in the local lot.
Manager Pittman's runnin
'round busier than an ol' mother
bird teachin' her young'uns to
fly, dashin' here and there to
make final arrangements for the
game, an' back out to the park to
see how the club's gettin' "long
The fans are comin' to life and
are gettin' in . their reservations
for grandstan' seats, ; and ', all in
all we've got a pretty good picture
here cf a regular baseoail town.
Good Time for All
'Pears like we'll have an en
joyable time next Saturday, so
the Cub reporter can say "a good
time was had by all," at the end
o' his story.
Pitts takin no chances on get
tin a wallopin' Saturday, an' says
his club will be all to the merry
when the umps bellows "Play
Ball!" at the grandstan,' exercis
in' the ancient an honorable prac
tice o' keepin' the fans gues?in
what he's sayin.
Scarcely realized myself how
soon the bis; game was comin' 'till
I met Pitt on the street an' he
tells me how his club will line up
for the battle. That kind o' made
me come to an' wake up to the
fact that we haven't got much
more o' this waiting stuff to do.
By the way, just to satisfy those
folk3 who still think the Cubs
aren't goin' to play in Bisbee, here
is a telegram from John O. Seys,
the Cub's secretary, received by
Pittman yesterday:
"Fresno, Calif., April 7. 1919.
"Number eight holds at Tucson
until 4:30 for Cubs. Arrive about
8 o'clock Friday ni?ht. Notiry

) Laxcarin Cannot Harm Tender Stom-'
.ach, Liver and Boweis
A laxative today saves a sick child
tomorrow. Children simply will not
take the tiaie to empty their bowels,
which becomes clogged up with waste.
Liver gets sluggish, stomach sour.
Look at the tcngue, mother! Ii
coated or your child is listless, cross,
feverish, breath bad, restless, does not
eat heartily, full of cold or has sore
throat or any other ' children's ail
ments, give them a' few' Lascarin tab
lets. They don't worry, because it is
perfectly harmless, and in.a few hours
all the constiuation poison sour bile
and fermenting -waste will move out
of the bowels and you have a, well
playful child again. A thorough "In
side Cleansing" is oftentimes all that
is necessary. It should be the first
treatment given in any sickness.
Beware of counterfeits of oils,
syrups salts. Accept no substitutes
they might harm your child. Lax
carin is an excellent remedy for the
mother herself, and for the other mem
bers of the family. It is never known
to fail, and it works like a clock. It is
best in obstinate cases or occasional
constipation, for the relief of side
headaches, and an aid in colds and fev
ers, minor skin eruptions and all dis
orders where the basi of the trouble
is constipation. It aids digestion, re
lieves fermentation, neutralizes over
acidity, stops the bloating of gas, aids
sour stomach.
, It is best on account of the great
demand to order enough for a full
treatment as once, which is fdx boxes
for $5. It is really worth while to the
fufferere a million more. One box is
only $1 and will be sent upon receipt
of money order or cash by the Lax
carin Products company. Dept. E-52,

Your Duty Now as an American
A few. short weeks and the American people again will be called
upon to furnish their government with funds not for war this time, but
for the purpose of aiding the nation to pass over the crtical readjust
ment period from" war to peace.
Arizonans patriotically responded to every call for funds during the
war. Liberty leans were fully subscribed, the people of the various dis
tricts being quick to realize the necessity for action. The Red Cross
was lielpdd from our bountiful store, citizens net hesitating to reach down
in their pockets to aid the work so necessary to our cause.
New, that the war is over, that generosity' which marked Arizona's
part in the great conflict "must not give way to selfishness. The govern
ment needs tunds now as badly as during the war. It is just as vital that
the fifth Liberty loan the Victory loan be fully subscribed as it was for
the other four calls for mGney to be met. If America is to pass salely
the readjustment period, when big business and little business, giant
industries and small industries, are recovering from the shock of the
sudden ending of the war, and facing the problem of getting themselves
once more on a peace time basis, the call of the government lor money
must be met.
The swift victory of the allies after America entered the war was
possible largely through the generosity of the American public. A swift
recovery from the effects of war will be made possible jonly by the same
willing spirit to sacrifice for a time the small luxuries and comforts which
we enjoyed in pre-war days, that peace and prosperity may be everlasting.
On April 1 the people of Arizona will be called upon to furnish their
share of the five billion dollars which; the government is asking. As in
the case of other Liberty loans, the amount will be raised by popular
subscription. And, as in the case of the other loans, citizens are asked
not to give, but to loan their money to the government, the money being
returned later, with interest. ,
The Victory loan is attractive as an investment, particularly from the
standpoint of the small investor, who has no large sums to place out at
interest. The Fifth loan notes will bear interest at the rate of four and
three-quarters per cent a large return to the investor. The same secur
ity that was offered for the four other loans again is offered the entire
United States of America, with' all of its resources.
If there exist any American who i3 not enough of an-American to save
money that his government may survive; who is not willing to sacrifice
a few trifling luxuries that his fellow men may get a better chance to
recover from the effects of the war; who can look the thousands of re
turning soldiers squarely in the face and refuse to buy Victory loan notes;
if there be any such, certainly there are none so narrow-minded as to
refuse to buy notes if only from the standpoint of them being a money
making proposition for him.
If you are a real American, you will buy Victory loan notes. There
are none who cannot afford to save a little cut of their income, and there
are none so poor as to be unable to buy at least one note.
Buy Victry bonJ3 to assure the safety of your nation and of yourself. x
Remember, the campaign starts April 21. Begin saving now.
Heroes Are Human
When we realize that heroes are human, with the same desires and
aversions, the same weariness and weaknesses, the same anxities
troubles, temptations and necessities as the rest of us, there may be less
talking, but there should be more real doing.
That the man who crept across No Man's Lahd, a target for all the
Many devised death's, to rescue a pal, may become a homeless tramp
is a simple fact. -He may have been one before he went on the Great
Adventure. Or he may not.
The hero is just the pre-war human plus, the war experience. That
experience made many great changes. It is not well' to forget either
element in their makeup.
The hero has been well fed, sheltered, clothed, medically cared for,
trained to act with others, to disregard danger and to die for ideals with
little talk about them. He was sent away with profuse promises and
plaudits, told that he was going to save the world, to make it better and
ta be welcomed back to the bounty of a greatful nation. He has re
turned to be reminded of these promises through a momentary outburst
of fulsome flattery, then told to look for a job and scolded if he does
not take the first one offered.
He finds that while he was collecting souvenirs and experience some
of those at home were accumulating more substantial emoluments. He
hears it said that all this talk about "dying for democracy" was "bunk,"
and sometimes feels a little as if he had been buncoed. Y2iile he
may not have taken all the pre-war promises seriously, he does not
feel that there should be unseemly haste in repudiating them.
Subjecting millions of ordinary human beings to such extraordinary
experiences produces great results.
The soldier learned the possibilities of united action. He saw what
could be done when men and money are spent without stint. He knows
that the impossible has been moved far beyond it3 pre-war boundaries.
He has learned to respect organization, practice discipline and fear
n.thing. He has learned to choose and follow leaders or to act, when
necessary, without them. He can do and dare things in his daily
work that were once beyond his dreams.
Instead of wondering what we will do with and for the heroes we
had better wonder what they will do to and for us. Politically and
economically they are the largest compact, commonly experienced, and,
theraefcre, on many points commonly minded mass this, or any nation,
ever knew.
They will run our industries, carry our elections, control our society
for a generation. They will do this the easier because the things they
want are what we all want.
They want better jobs, with as good food, clothing, care, education,
amusement and ether privileges as tiiey enjoyed in uniform. They
want security against war, poverty and injustice.
I.eing human as well as heroes they will willingly work with all of
us to secure these things peacefully. But they 'wil not be easy to bully,
deceive or defeat.
All this howl about paying your share of the league expenses reminds
us of the men who hired a private tutor because he objected to paying
school tax for only one child.
If the severs meat had guaranteed the price of everything else as it
did that of wheat, the average man wouldn't be able to buy anything
but a tax receipt.
One trouble with America just now is that so many of us have stopped
sawing wood to tell the rest of us how thing should be done at Versailles.
The more complaint wo hear about he inefficient management of the
campaign in the Argonne, the more our wonder and admiration grows.
' Hunger is responsible for much of the disturbance in Europe, and they
will probably keep on raising cane until the next crop Is harvested.
Russia i:; learning that when people loaf and live on the fat of the
land, the land soon gets lean.
The significant thing about our busy little strike organizers is their
fluent German.
After that row at Tien Tsiu, a court-martial will tell it to the marines.

Industrial Board of Depart
ment of Commerce As
sures Early Cut
WASHINGTON, April 7 "There is
every reason to expect lower food
prices in the relatively near luture."
to speaks George X. Peek, chairman
of the new industrial board of the de
part nipnt of commerce.
Peek describes the industrial board
as 'the doctor to American business."
He believes the patient should be well
on the way to recovery within J0 to
!H days.
"And after six months of convalesc
ing, American business should be
healthier and more prosperous than
ever," he asserts.
"Doctor" Peek is now diagnosing
the ailments of the industries which
produce the basic necessities, such as
steel, coal, lumber, brick and building
materials. Already he and his assist
ants have brought about a reduction
of 10 to 15 p-r cent in the prices of
steel. When prices of these commodi
ties have been brought down, then the
board will go after food prices.
There's no government control
about it; it's purely a voluntary ar
rauirement. Way System Works'
Here's about the way it works not
so informally, perhaps, but along these
general lines.
Down in the wood-and paper build
ing where the council of national de
fense has given quarters to the indus
trial board, there's a committee room,
with a long, plain table and a few
plain chairs.
Into this room Chairman Peek calls
Judge Gray of the United States Steel
corporation, Charles SI. Schwab of
Bethlehem Steel, and other steel mag
nates. They all come quite willingly
"Now, judge," saya Chairman Peek.
"You know darn well steel prices are
too high. Nobody's buying any steel
because they can't afford it. Now it
seems to me it would pay. you to cut
the price, even if you do lose a little
by It, so that people would buy. What
do you say?"
"Sure," says Judge Gray, flicking
the ashes off his cigar. T mwilling.
I'll cut prices 10 per cent, if that suits
the rest of you."
"That's all right," says Charlie
Schwab. "But I think some things
could be cut la per cent."
"That's too much,"' says some other
magnate. "I think 12 per cent would '
be better."
So they agree on 12 per cent. Then
they take a pad of paper and a pencil
and figure out just what they'll charge ,
for various commodities. This sched
ule is put into shape, and they all sign
an agreement not to chage more than
it says they'll charge and there you
are!
Business Bears Shock
One of the best things about this
new and novel method of price-fixing
is that labor i3 perfectly protected
The industrial board looks after that.
It will permit no cut in prices that
will give the employers a chance to
cut wages. So long as the cost of liv
ing remains high, wages must remain
high, the board holds, so that the liv
ing standard shall not be lowered.
The theory underlying the whole ar
rangement is that big business, still
holding its profits made during the
ar, is in a far better position to stand
tho first shock cf readjustment than
is the Anierican workingman.
"No one dares buy until prices fall,
and even then everybody will wait to
tee how far they fall," says Peek. "In
dividual action in lowering selling
prices is therefore long drawn out and
unscientific. It renders the market un
stable and dangerous.
"By sane and temperate action all
this can be avoided." ,

Five per Cent Interest Rate
proposal Looked Upon
Unfavorably
WASHINGTON, April 7. The 5 per
cent interest rate borne by the war
finance corporation's new five yeai
bonds, approved ly the treasury, is not
to be taken as an index of the rate on
Victory Liberty loan notes, It was
stated authoritatively today.
Suggestions that the Victory issue
should bear at least 5 per cent are
reaching the treasury persistently
from banking and other commercial in
terests, but apparently the proposals
are looked on unfavorably. t
The rate and other terms of the
loan will be determined -within the
next week or ten days and announced
only a few days before April 21 when
the selling campaign opens.
Printing of the notes has been start

Ain't Nature Wonderful By Ahern
King Solomon was the heavyweight wisdom titleholder
of his day. He had a thousand Mrs. Solomons, but the up

wouldn't be considered lavish
with his wisdom if he had to foot
the bill for a thousand Easter

relatively little headway, dealing in
transportations being limited to popu

points, while steel kept within nar

American International Corporation
was the spectacular feature, outstrip
ping all other stocks on its advance
of almost 10 points.
Oils, motors, shippings, equipments,

and fertilizer issues furnished unus

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, April 7. Strength de
veloped in the' corn market today ow
ing to the fact that rural offerings,
although - of liberal volume were for
the most part held at comparatively
high figures. Prices closed unsettled
at the same as Saturday's finish to lc
up with May $1.56 to $1.56 and
July $1.43 to $1.49. Oats gained
to cents. In provisions the out
come was unchanged to 12c higher.
Corn advanced rather sharply after
an earlv break that was dua mora or
less to prospects of larger acreage this
seasor. than has recently been looked
for. It was pointed out that stocks
were still far below the total a year

Oats showed independent strength.
Curtailment of the visible supply was
a bullish factor and there was talk of
better domestic demand. .
Provisions averaged higher with
hogs. Quotations on the live animals

Correct Posture Is Important
to Appearance; Don't
Dawdle Along
By Edith Hyde
"The Girl of the' Golden Apple"
A correct walking posture i3
very important. Nothing tends
to do more harm to a woman's
health and beauty than slovenly
walking. . .
When you rise to walk the
whole body should be thrown into
a staie of gentle tension, putting
every musclar which harmonious
movement employs, into vigorous
responsive action. In this way
every limb and part of the body
will be so perfectly balanced that
there will be no strain anywhere.
Keep lithe- abdpmen well In -and
even a portly person can do
this with the exereise of a littfe
will power. The shoulder, hip,
and ankle joints should be upon
a line; the chest held high, the
head erect.
Of course deep breathing must
go with walking. If the lungs
Improperly inflated, this act alone
gives to the br;ly a buoyancy
greatly increasing and lessening.
Don't d?.-aole along. Walk with
a free, easy and hold step. Don't
shuffle alons on the heels. At
each stride spring off lightly from
the hall of the foot. Don't roll the
hips. This i3 not enly unhygienic
but vulgar too.

A GOOD WAY TO SAVE
"In times like these when economy
is so essential.-1 know of no better
way to save than to have the entire
family shod with Neolin Soles."
writes a F.Williams, Rochester, N.Y.
In his letter Mr. Williams tells of
a pair of Neolin-soled shoes which he
has worn constantly for four months.
'-'The soles still look like new,"hesays.
You, too, will think there 13 no
better way to save, when once you
have tried shoes with these long
wearing, comfortable, and waterproof
soles. They come in many styles for
every member of the family. And
good repair shops carry Neolin Soles
for re-soling. They are made scien

: ' War heeds made prominent the question of a standard test for gasoline. On July
k '31st, 1918, President Wilson ordered a committee appointed under the United
( States Fuel Administration to establish specifications and standards of test for gas-
oline, supplied to the Government. This committee consisted of the United States
, Fuel t Administration and representatives of the War and Navy Departments, the
, United , States" Shipping Board, the Director General of Railroads, the Bureau; of
Mines,; and the Bureau of Standards. Standards were adopted for aviation gasoline
export, fighting and domestic) and for general motor use on land and sea.
(The Gravity Test Discarded
' The Government's Committee on Standardi
zation of Petroleum Specifications stated in its
. report : "It will be noted that there are no grav-
ity limitations in the specifications for aviation
gasoline, nor in the specifications for motor
; gasoline which are given later, for it has been
' found that gravity is of little or no value in de
' te'rmining the quality of gasoline." The stand
ards adopted by the United States Government
are based on boiling points. '
Boiling Points the Real Test
Gasoline is known to the refiner as one mem
ber of the petroleum family. He distinguishes
. each member of the family, not by gravity, but ,
by boiling points. Gxavity is a fleeting stand
ard of test, but boiling points are unchanging
in their value and always determine the quality
of the product. Knowing them the refiner can
keep his product uniform and reliable.
What Is a Boiling Point? '
A boiling point is the temperature at which
a liquid will begin to boil or vaporize.
In distilling a given quantity of gasoline the
refiner ascertains at what point each 10 per
cent vill boil, until the entire quantity is evap
orated or distilled. In this way he determines
.what is known as the initial boiling point, as
well as all intervening boiling points :Jn the
chain, up, to the maximum, high boiling point.
Boiling Points Tell the Story
Boiling points determine the vaporizing and
combustive qualities of gasoline. They decide
the action of the gas developed from gasoline.
They are the only true measure of gasoline
value.
An ideal gasoline has boiling points in a con
tinuous, uniform chain. There must not be too
many low boiling points, otherwise the loss in

As combustion starts with the lowest boiling
points and flashes on. through the gas, the coa
, tinuous chain of boiling points from the low
4 to the high is necessary for instantaneous,
