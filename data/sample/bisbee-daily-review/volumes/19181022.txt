In the war theater the allied armies
have taken no heed of the efforts un

peace, but are continuing fo force
back the Germans at vital points
along the lines in rfelgium and!
France. In these endeavors the Brit
ish and Americans are for the mo
ment taking the principal parts. The
British have approached to within
two miles of Valenciennes and the
Americans, to the northwest of Ver
dun, have succeeded in occupying two
highly important positions in their
operations aimed at an advance north
ward. American and British troops have
crossed the Oise canal on a wide
front in the face of desperate resis

sector wil menace the Germans both
to the north and south.
The Valenciennes-HIrson railway,
formerly one of the Germans' main
lateral arteries of communication, has
been cut.
The west bank of the Scheldt canal
has been occupied by the British along

of Tournai, which city is being de

with machine guns.

from the Spanish border to the Eng

work of the American Navy in foreign
waters were given to the public today
by Assistant Secretary Roosevelt, who
recently returned , from a. visit to
Europe.
The American people seem to have
little idea of the extent Of our naval
activities abroad," said Secretary
Roosevelt. "The tendency is to think
merely of the convoying and patrol
work our destroyers and other vessels
are doing and the presence or our
battleships with, the British fleet.
But Important as Jhis is it is only
part cf our activities and there are
dozers of other things of importance
of which little has been said."
The building of the Northern mine
barrage was one of the biggest things
ever accomplished in ordnance work,
Mr. Roosevelt said. In turning out
material for it, a number of plants
!n this country were kept busy for
months. Several American bases were
established on the British coast to lay
and handle the mines.
To save haulage of oil. the American
navy has undertaken to construct a
pipe line across Scotland.

The key position at the south is in j
the region below Valenciennes. At
both places the exhausted German di
visions, whosa ranks have had great
holes chopped into them by terrific
blows, are fighting with the greatest
desperation. The German command
ers are sacrificing many men in their
endeavor to hold their ground, but
in both sectors the allied troops have
smashed into the enemy and made ap
preciable gains. Scores of additional
villages have been reclaimed and num
erous prisoners and large quantities
of supplies have been captured.
In the center of the battle area the
British kept thrusting out everywhere
and gradually during the day moved
forward toward the west bank of the
Scheldt with increasing cellerity. The
Germans have taken advantage of the
natural protection offered by the
width of this tream and its canal and
marshy borders. They are hiding be
hind it in shallow trenches and are
showing nervousness aa the allies ap
proach. Back of them, their artillery,
the strength of which has been great
ly depleted, is giving some support.
" The Germans have their cannon
dose to the roads and on them, so
that when it becomes necessary to
withdraw the guns they can get away
in a hurry. In their retreat the Ger
mans have resorted to every known
means to delay the bringing up of
the artillery, but without effect. At
the present time, however, the allies
are not hampered in the least, for the
Germans were put to suSh hurried
flight that they had little time to take
their artillery and vast stores of am
munition with them. These fell intc
the hands of allied troops, and the
guns were promptly turned around
and shels made in Germany were sent
eastward as fast as they could be
fired against their original owners.
Infantrymen thus had a novel experi

Tombstone 75.800 40,000
Naco 17,700 17,000
From the northern end of the coun
ty, including Tombstone, Judge A. C.
Lock wood reports that all districts of
that division have gone over the top,
but that he has net definite figures
on each separate district. His estimate
places the amount of over-subsdrip-tion
anywhere from 30 to 40 per cent
above the quota assigned, $225,060.
Cananea, which in the past has as
sisted this district materially in their
quotas and which has always taken a
liberal allotment of bonds, again re
sponds heartily to the call of the gov
ernment with a total subscription of
$83,000. of which some $63,000 has
been assigned to this district's total.
The campaign in Caaanea was con
ducted by the office force of the Four
C organization wjth the general assist
ance of several citizens, including
merchants and bankers. The Foreign
Relief association of Cananea, N. C
Thompson, president, was the nucleus
for the drive. Those of tne associa
tion who assisted in the work were:
J. M. Gibbs. M. W. McGuire, W. W.
Minhinnick. Robert Anderson, A. L.
Houck, Dr. N. Zeinun, A. Tabet, C. J.
Beale, W, M. Kenefick, William Mc

H. Brandt, S. H. Dale, J. J. Compton,
Dr. Frank Homeland, E. G. Rogers, F.
D. Hamilton, II. S. McKay and Henry
Beard. J. M. Gibbs, who is the repre
sentative of the United States govern
ment In Cananea, handled the banking
arrangements. Public appeal of the
association to the residents of Can
anea, constituted a large part of the
campaign. A poster announcing the as
sociation's part in the drive was sent
all residents. In part it read: "As a
matter of local pride it is desired that
all subscriptions from Cananea be
handled through the Relief associa
tion. Please hold your subscription
until some of the committee call upon
you." Reports from the committee
declare that not only Americans, but
that Mexicans, Englishmen, French
men and other foreigners partook
heavily in raising the Sonora camp's
quota.
Mining companies and large cor
porations of the Warren district and
Cochise county, were not permitted ;
through a ruling of the treasury de
partment to allot their subscriptions
to any district in Arizona. At the
beginning of the drive the treasury
department issued a ruling that all
corporations should subscribe where
their banking reserves are maintained.
Since most of the corporations of the
west maintain their reserves in the
east, this ruling at the outset seriously
hand'eapped the local committee and
at an early date seemed to make im
possible the raising of the $2,502,000
quota assigned to Cochise county. The
companies were able, however, to as
sign a part of their quotas to this dis
trict, which assisted the county ma
terially. These assignments were not
equal to those of the earlier drives.
Following is an additional list of
members of the honor roll in this dis
trict in the fourth Liberty loan drive.
The lists of the employes of the Shat
tuck and the Phelps Dodge corpora
tion. Copper Queen branch, and other
lists not printed to date will appear

It is hoped that the people of the

of subscribers by filing the papers in

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21. After
reading a number of late reports on
the outcome of the fourth Liberty loan
ampaign which closed Saturday
treasury officials declared tonight
there is little certainty at this time
either of the total volume of subscrip
tions or the number, of subscribers.
They still felt no doubt that the loan
had teen over-subscribed but explain
ed that many earliar messages appear
ed too optomistic in the light of ac
tual figures nowbeing compiled by
every bank and local committee over
the country.
Some cities which at first reported
they were heavily over-subscribed now
discover that they barely went over
their marks. '
There was good ground, however,
for the estimate that 22,000.000 or
more individuals had subscribed to the
greatest war loan ever floated by any
government The fact that many of
these represented lump 'subscriptions
by corporations which later would re
sell bonds to their employes led to the
belief that the number of actual bond
holders would be considerably higher.
Owing to the present uncertainty
the treasury expects to make no furth
er announcement concerning the re
sults or the loan until definite and
official figures are received from each
federal reserve bank. The first of
thesd reports is hardly looked for be
fore next Monday, and the final com
pilations may be delayed for two
weeks.
A digest of reports indicates clear
ly officials say, that the house to
house canvassing methods, or the sys
tem of having citizens call voluntarily
at polling places, should be used much
more extensively, in the fifth Liberty
loan campaign, set for next spring.
Stories of self sacrifice by indi
viduals and business interests of fine
records of loan workers, of unceasing
effort throughout the three weeks per
iod, of clever methods and efficient
salesmanship, of enthusiastic demon-
j stration which stopped
at neither
moral discouragements nor physical
handicaps from influenza illness are
reaching the treasury in every mail.
"Words of thanks seem paltry in
the face of the deeds being reported,"
said the officials.
The navy subscribed more than $40,

by Rear Admiral Cowie. navy Liberty
loan officer and this figure will be
raised by later reports. The army
also made a fine record, but the fig
ures are yet incomplete. General Per
shing cabled that up to October 14,
members of the American expedition
ary forces had subscribed $1,270,000
and that this probably would run to
$2,000,000 or more.
Officials and employes of 97 ship
yards subscribed $35.3S.S0O. the ship-

CONSIDER LATEST NOTE FROM
GERMANY SUFFICIENT WAR
RANT FOR FURTHER TREATING
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 21 Germany
has replied to President Wilson with
a note which, though no one is pre
pared to say it will lead the president
even to continue exchanges on the
subject of an armistice and peace, at
last has served almost to bring con
viction here that the people of Ger
many actually are taking the reins of
government and sincerely desire peace
on any terms the United States and
the allies are willing to give.
' There was no intimation tonight of
the attitude of the president and prob
ably there will be none until the of
ficial text of the new German com
munication has been received. The
president was in conference all even
ing with Secretary Lansing, discuss
ing the note as received by wireless
late in the day. Like the reply to
the president's inquiries a week ago,
this note was sent out from the Ger
man wireless stations and picked up
in the allied countries many hours
before the official text could move
by cable. The official version prob
ably will come tomorrow through the
Swiss legation here.
As received by wireless the note is
believed to be slightly garbled in the
important sentences regarding condi
tions for the evacuations of invaded
territory and for an armistice, but
nevertheless it is regarded as an awk
ward attempt to meet the conditions
laid down by President Wilson tor
consideration of an armistice. And
it makes the significant declaration
that the government in Berlin no
longer is responsible to a single arbi
trary influence the kaiser but is
supported by an overwhelming major
ity of the German people.
This declaration is supported by the
statement that constitutional reforms
are in progress in accord with the
determination of the people under
which no government can take or hold
offices without the confidence of the
majority of a reichstag elected by uni
versal, secret suffrage. It is accorded
more consideration here because of
confidential advices received only to
day indicating that the German mid
die classes have resolved to have
peace at any price and if necessary
are prepared to get rid of the kaiser,
the crown prince and all military con
trol. Thus the belief ia strengthened that
the present note and those that have
gone before are genuine efforts to ob
tain peace, and are inconclusive mere
ly because the Germans conducting
the exchanges are seeking to bargain
for something better than the uncon
ditional surrender they are prepared
to give if pushed to the wall. It is
assumed also that they want to pre
pare gradually the German public for
a realization of what has happened
to their military machine and the war
lords dreams of power, so as to avoid
a complete collapse or government.
Diplomatic observers point out that
the president is at liberty with perfect
consistency to make no response at
this time, but to await developments;
to await the performance of the prom
ises of the Germans not to torpedo
passenger ships, their implied promise
to work no more destruction during
their retreat from Belgium and France
than military necessity requires, and
finally to await further development
of the political leaven that evidently
is working toward the complete over-

tions at Bisbee. on July 12, 1917, was
begun in the United States district
court here today before Judge William
M. Morrow of the circuit court of ap
peal:) for the Ninth circuit, who came
her from San Francisco for the hear

him by the constitution and laws of

The argument was opened by Clif
ton E. Matthews of Bisbes of the firm
of Ellinwood & Ross, counsel for all
of the defendants except those In
France. He argued that the right or
privilege guaranteed by the constitu
tion or laws of the United Slates must
be one secured against acts of Indi
viduals and not one merely secured
against state action; that the rights
and privileges referred to in Section
14 of the constitution of the United
States and secured thereby are only
against state action anu not against
individual acts; that the section has
icference only to fundamental rights
and immunities; thai the rights
claimed to have been violated were
not created by the constitution of the

the federal government for their ex

HEAVY NIGHT FIGHTING.
WITH THE ALLIED ARMIES IN
BELGIUM AND FRANCE. Oct. 21, 11
a. m. (By the Associated Press.) In
heavy fighting which proceeded
throughout the night and continued
today in a heavy rain, the Germans
everywhere were driven still further
eastward. In Belgium the allies are
three miles from Eecloo and in the
whole vast stretch between Courtrai
and the Dutch border the British,
French and Belgians are pushing the
uicrmans before them, closing in to
ward Ghent, from which they now
are less than seven miles.
In the center of the battle area the
British are on thefevest bank of the
Scheldt for more than ten miles, north
of Tournai, in front of which city the
Germans are resisting stubbornly with
machine guns. Frontally the British
have reached positions less than four
miles from Valenciennes. Northwest
of Valenciennes they have entered the
great Vicoigne-Raismes lorest. In the
region northwest of Lille the British,
are pushing out in the general direc
tion of Lequssnoy, fighting every foot
of the way.
The Germans here and there in Bel
gium have held out strongly in enor
mous concrete -forts from which the
guns had been removed. These forts
were used by German machine gun
ners and in some cases it required
shells from heavy guns to crack them.
More prisoners have been captured,

throw of military and autocratic pow
er in the empire.
No one believes that an immediate
cessation of hostilities is in sight. The
opinion most generally held is that if
Mr. Wilsou decides to make a reply,
and if the entente governments asree,
the only step possible at this time
would be to sanction arrangements
to be dictated by General Foch in the
field for withdrawal of the Germans
without further fighting. Such ar
rangements, of course, would be con
tingent upon guarantees of continued
supremacy of the victorious allied
armies and consequently virtually
would mean surrender of tho Ucr-
mans.
The official view here so far has
been that evacuation of invaded terri
tory must be completed before there
can be an armistice. Should President
Wilson after consulting with the allies
adhere to this view, the work of driv
ing the Germans to and across their
own borders would proceed and the
opportunity for fixing details which
the new note suggests "be brought
about' would come only through a
request iiotn the German lines under a
white tlag on the battle field.

German armies.
TEXT OF NOTE
LONDON, Oct. 21. The text of the
German note, as received by wireless
is as follows:
"In accepting the proposal for an
evacuation of occupied territories, the
German government has started from
the assumption that the procedure of
this evacuation and of the conditions
of an armistice should be left to the
Judgment of the military advisors, and
that the actual standard of power on
both sides in the field has to form the
basis for arrangements safeguarding
and guaranteeing this standard.
"The German government suggests
to the president that an opportunity
should be about for fixing the
details. It trusts that the president
of the United States will approve of
no demand which would be irrecon
cilable with the honor of the German
people and with opening a way to a
peace of justice.
"The German government protests
against the reproach of illegal and in
humane actions made against the Ger
man land and sea forces and thereby
against the German people. For the
covering of a retreat destructions will
always be necessary and they are car
ried out in so far as is permitted by
international law. The German troops
are under most strict instructions to
spare private property and to exercise
care for the population to the best of
their ability. Where transgressions
occur in spite of these instructions, the
guilty are being punished.
"The German government further
denies that the German navy in sink
ing ships have ever purposely destroy
ed life boats with their passengers.
The German government proposes
with regard to all those charges that
the facts be cleared up by neutral
commisisons.
"In order to avoid anything that
might hamper the work of peace the
German government has causeu or
ders to be despatched to all submarine
commanders precluding the torpedo
ing of passenger ships without, how
ever, for technical reasons, being able
to guarantee that these orders will
reach every single submarine at sea
before its return.
"As a fundamental condition for
peace the president prescribes the
destruction of every arbitrary power
that can separately, secretly and of its
own single choice disturb the peace
of the world. To this the German gov
ernment replies:
"Hitherto the representation ot
the people in the German empire has
not been endowed with an influence
on the formation of the government.
"The constitution did not provide
for a concurrence of a representation
of the people in decisions of peace
and war. These conditions have just
now undergone a fundamental change.
A new government has been formed
in complete accordance with the
wishes (principles?) of the represen
tation of the people, based on equai.
universal, secret, diicct franchises.
"The leaders ot the great panie3
of the reichstag are members of this
government In the future no govern
ment can take or continue in office
without possessing the confidence of
a majority .of the reichstag.
"The responsibility of the chancel
lor of the empire to the representation
of the people is being legally devel
oped and safeguarded. The first act
of the new government has been to
lay before the reichstag a bill to alter
the constitution of the empire so that
the consent of the representation of
the people is required for decisions
on war and peace.
"The permanence of the new sys
tem is, however, guaranteed not only
by constitutional safeguards, but by
the unshakeable determination of the
German people whose vast majority
stands behind these reforms and de
mand their energetic continuance.
"The question of the president
with whom he and the governments
associated against Germany are deal
ing is therefore answered in a clear.
unequivocal manner by the statement
that the offer of peace and an armis
tice has come fiom a government
which is free from any arbitrary and
irresponsible influence, is supported
by the approval of an overwhelming
majority of the German people.

Harlan W. Hall, news editor of the
Thoenix Republican, and state public
ity director of the United "War work
drive for Arizona, spent Monday in

this compalgn, soon to start. Mr. Hall
expects to visit every county in the
state and also every town of any size
in the prosecution of. his publicity
work. He is writing, working and
talking along most practical and com
mon sense lines in his work, and is
therefore bound to score a most ef
fective success In presenting the aims
and the needs and the great good of
this work to the general public.
Mr. Hall declares that "Billy" Spear,
editor of the Republican, that grand
old man of Arizona newspaperdom, is
as young and virile as ever. Mr.
Spear Is a former editor of the Re
view of this city.
Mr. Hall also declared that the in
fluenza quarantine was affecting busi
ness in general to a serious extent in
Phoenix, Tucson and Douglas, and that
the newspapers in these cities were
suffering as much as any other line of
business with the exception, of course,
of the theaters, which are put out of
business entirely for the time being.

Checking of War Savings pledges of

dicsloses that many residents of this
district who have signed up to pur
chase several war savings certificates
each month, have to date not kept
kept their pledges. This statement
was made yesterday from the office
of the Warren District Commercial
club, where the report cards of pledges
are being kept as purchases of stamps
and certificates are returned from the
agencies throughout the district.
Similar laxity of the people of the
entire state is reported from the state
headquarters at Phoenix by H. R.
Tritle, state director, who has issued
numerous appeals recently for greater
subscriptions in every district. In
citing this laxity Mr. Tritle has made
public a telegram from the governor
of the federal reserve bank of San
Francisco, Cal.. as follows:
"Secretary McAdoo is extremely
anxious to have war savings pledges
ccllected. Please use you very best

Are
Weak
and Ailing Because o
Acid
Sto
mach
There are any number of people who for years
have been sick and ailing, weak, run down and in
a poor physical condition who will be surprised
even dumbfounded to learn that their trouble has
just been an acid-stcmach, which is merely another
name for what doctors call superacidity. Yet it is
now positively known that acid-stomach is the cause
of a very large number of diseases.
Excess acid in the stomach prevents proper
digestion and assimilation, thus causing the blood
to become thin and impoverished as a result of
which people become sallow-skinned, emaciated and
anemic.
Excess acid causes irritation all elong the intes
tinal tract irritation so severe and aggravating as
to frequently result in catarrh and even cancer of
the stomach.
Excess acid causes stomach and intestinal fer
mentation, producing poisons which, absorbed into
the blood and carried throughout the system, cause
auto-intoxication, insomnia,, nervousness, irritabil
ity, mental depression, melancholia, dizziness, verti
go and, often times, valvular heart trouble and
heart failure.
Yes, many people will be greatly" surprised to
learn that such a long train of physical ailments can
be traced directly to an acid-stomach. Put there
is no need for surprise. Think what acid mouth
does to the teeth. The acid eats right through the
enamel the hardest substance in the human body.
.And that is exactly what makes teeth rot and de
cay. No wonder, then, that excess acid in the
stomach plays such havoc; causes so much ill
health and misery makes so many people weak and
ailing unfit for e'.Uier work or pleasure and brings
on premature old age.
So often you have heard the remark: "I've taken
all sorts cf tonics and medicines and tried many
different doctors but nothing seems to help me."
Nine times out of ten the person making such
a remark has an acldJstomach. And until the
excess acid is removed, nothing WILL help. Re
move that excess acid and the results are truly
wonderful. Health and strength return almost liko
magic.
You can now rid your stomach of its excess acid.
A wonderful modern medicine called EATONIC lit
erally wipes It out. It dees the work easily, speed
ily and thoroughly. It makes the stomach pure,
sweet, cool and comfortable. It helps you get full
strength out of every mouthful of food you eat;
and unless ycu DO get full strength from your
food you cannot enjoy robust, vigorous health.
EATONIC is in the form of tablets. They are
pleasant-tasting you eat them just like candy.
Try EATONIC and see how wonderfully dif
ferent you will feel. See how quickly EATONIC
banishes the immediate effects of acid-stcmach
bloat, heartburn, belching, food repeating, indiges
tion, etc. See too, how o.uickly your general health
improves how much more relish you take in eat
ing how much more easily your food is digested
how soundly you sleep how nervousness and irri
tability disappear. And all simply because, by tak
ing EATONIC, you get rid of a lot of excess acid
that has been holding you back and making your
life miserable.
This is the help you need. You need it to keep
your stomach in a strong, healthy condition so
that, in turn, your mind and body will be strong
and vigorous.
It is so easy to get this help and it costs so little
So why suffer another hour when sure, quick relief
is at hand? Ask your druggist about it. He knows
that tens of thousands of people all over the United
States have used this wonderful modern remedy and
the results have been nothing short of marvelous.
Everywhere people who have used EATONIC tes
tify to Its power to bring quick relief. The testi
monials of some of these people are so enthusiastic
and tell of such remarkable results as to be almost
unbelievable.
If you are one of those who have "tried every
thing." but in spite of it are still lacking in physical
strength and vigor, begin at once to take EATONIC
Don't put it off. Get back your physical and mental
punch. Have the power and energy to work with a
viw. Enjoy the good things cf li'e. Iarn what it
means to fairly bubble over with health. Like
thousands of others, you will say that you never
drenmed it possible that such a wonderful change for
the better could be brought about so quickly.
So get a big box of EATONIC from your drug
gist today. We authorize him to guarantee EA
TONIC to please you and you can trust your own
druggist to make this guarantee good. If EATONIC
fails in any way. take it back he will refund
your money. If your druggist does not keep
EATONIC write to us direct and we will send you
a big 50c box. You ran send us the 50c after
you receive It. Address H. K Kramer. President.

"We Do Not Discuss;
We Judge Them!"
With all this peace piffle spreading about
like influenza germs and German notes
fluttering to and fro like scraps of paper in
the wind, it is well to bear in mind the
fact that just the other day they pasted post
ers all over Paris bearing the legend, "We
do not discuss; we judge them. Remem
ber!" France knows the Hun; has suf
fered his heavy hand in war and in every
species of cruelty and torment under in
vasion and has been looted by him from
the tree tops to the bottom of the wells and
has dwelt for forty years under the shadow
of his menace. She will not discuss, she
will judge. This peace, talked so much
about, when it comes, it will not be a de
bate, but a hall of judgment with the allies
sitting in the tribunal and Germany brought
before the bar to face justice for her crimes.
No German note, including this last one
that is being flashed and hawked about the
land, even approaches the attitude and the
terms Germany must bear before she will
be listened to by the free nations of the
world. There is too much discussion; too
many terms and conditions. It is a plain
proposition of "yes" or "no." It is either
"surrender," or "fight on." As France
says, "we do not discuss; we judge them!"
That jury verdict at Phoenix last week of
eight to four against Governor Hunt in
his libel suit against Colonel Breen of Co
conino Sun, is most significant. 1 Tie issue
on trial here was practically the governor's
loyalty to his country. The evidence,
brought out from Hunt himself under cross
examination, was startling to say the least.
He consorted with one Kastner, an alien
enemy and I. W. W. of the worst sort, and
freed him from jail and gave him a state
position in utter defiance of law and loyal
ty in war time, according to the evidence
at this trial. Hunt's relations with Kastner,
in spite of his evasions and lapses of mem
ory under the gruelling by Judge Campbell,
were most reprehensible, to say the least.
This testimony points an accusing finger
at Hunt. In fact this trial, brought about
by Hunt as a plaintiff, wound up with Hunt
as defendant before the bar of public opin
ion as well as justice, and his loyalty suf
fered further and grievous injuries, rather
than was healed by this legal operation.
After following this trial from beginning
to end, the Arizona Gazette demands
Hunt's resignation from his high office.
Every time Hunt has opened his mouth
lately he has put his foot in it, and his
every recent move has met with discom
fiture and further humiliation of his state.
His past company, acts and friendships
haunt him still.
Washington announces, after a careful
study of the reports by many retail dealers
on twenty-eight articles of food, increases
of prices as follows: Four per cent increase
from August 1 5 bf this year to September
1 5 ; fourteen per cent from September,
1917, to September, 1918; and seventy-two
per cent from September, 1913, to Sep
tember, 1918. This means seventy-two
per cent increase since the war began. It is
too low for many foods and doubtless high
for others. And upon clothing, building
materials and a score of other household
necessities the increase has been 1 00 per
cent and more upon many of these things
and 50 per cent at least upon all.
If one might judge from the remarks
heard most of yesterday afternoon in that
forum of public opinion, the crowds before
the Review bulletin board when extracts
from the latest German peace note came in,
American citizens on an average reject and
disbelieve the note and also regard it with
suspicion. One man emphatically, ineleg
antly, and yet truly, sized up the situation
when he declared, after scanning long and
carefully the bulletins: "Looks to me like
the kaiser is like the man that had caught
a wildcat and was yelling for some one to
help him let it go." The crowds expressed
unanimous approval of this metaphor. Seri
ously, there was a marked difference in the
reception of this note from the expression
of the public some days ago when the first
note came. The public seemed to think
Germany was sincerely in earnest when
she sent out the first appeal, but the ten
dency to haggle and squirm and tempora
ize is already grating on the public's nerves,
and it is getting both impatient and implac
able under this note writing strain. The
crowds in front of the Review office yes
terday afternoon were hoping that Presi
dent Wilson would not answer this last note
at all.
PATRIOTISM AS POLITICAL ASSET
(From New York Sun.)
Arizona is some distance from our baili
wick, but the election of a Congressman
from that state is of importance to us, and
hence of interest. Arizona owns only one
a representative-at-large. He is Mr. Carl
Hayden, or, if our information is correct,
he should now be called Major Hayden of
some part of the United States army. And
thereby hangs the following tale:
Congressman-Major Hayden voted
against nearly all the measures in prepara
tion 'for war in the Congress. He voted,
it is true, for the actual declaration of war,
but followed that with a vote against con
scription. Thus he did nearly all he could
to hamper and interfere with the energetic
and sane prosecution of the war.
But he is a candidate for re-election, and
running against him is a man who holds a
lieutenant's commission and is now and
has been actually serving in France. Rea
lizing that this left him at a disadvantage,
Candidate Hayden, at the last moment,
slipped off to Washington and succeeded
in dragging down a Major's commission
within the last few weeks. Thus he proves
his patriotism at rather beyond the eleventh
hour say about I 1 :49 p. m.
It is reported, however, that even this
sort of conversion to militancy is not doing
him much good or acquiring popularity for
him.' Are the Arizona voters to be so eas
ily fooled? This is the kind of man that
congress can do very well without. And
what is to be thought of a war department
that creates this kind of a "major?"
Here is a cow to make the famous, or
rather the infamous, cow of the Widow
O'Leary of Chicago, take second place in
the historical rank of cows. This is "the
cow of Lille." She was successfully con
cealed b' her owner from the Germans
during their four years' occupation of this
city. Name of a name! What a cow! How
patient and cunning and silent she must
have been. That she lived underground
during this period goes without saying.
What a lucky cow. It is to be doubted if,
in all the torn and distracted realm of north
ern France if another cow or a single pig or
horse or goat escaped the lynx eye and
clutching hand of the invader. They say
that this cow was to be decorated and led
forth in triumph to march in the procession
that met the British deliverers of the city.
Well, why not ? This cow was entitled to
this place of honor. As a mascot and a
standby and a single triumph of the French
in all this orgy of loot, thievry and destruc
tion this cow stands alone.
Hustled from her prey before she can
rend and destroy it, Germany now shows
a disposition to cease the destruction of
evacuated towns. Checkmated at sea,
Germany now offers to recall the subma
rine. Driven from Serbia and Belgium and
France, Germany now offers to fulfill this
one of the fourteen conditions. She will
first have to do something voluntarily and
of her own free will before she can receive
one credit mark upon the ledger of the his
tory of today.
After all, it is not by exchanging notes
with Germany that ve shall gair. a victor
ious peace. Bah! It is by force of arms in
the field, and force only, that wc shall gain
the peace we desire and to which we are
entitled. Consider this point well: No
German note yet received but that has
conditions attached. There is a "but or
an "if" in every note. Mark them well,
for, if we enter this door,' they will surety
pierce our flesh like the barbed points of
a trap.
The evacuation of Belgium continues,
even without that "mixed commission'
suggested by the Hun to conduct this im
portant step.
Will Colter
Repudiate It?,
(From tha Arizona Gazette.)
My Dear Mike" has created soma
what of a sensation in political circles.
Without knowing it. this humble in
dividual, whose whereabouts is at
present a mystery, has given no littie
worry to t'.ie governor or a great state
and to the triends of another who
aspires to be the governor of this
same gr;at slate. What are the feel
ings ot the aspirant for these guberna
torial honors have not yet been ex
pressed by him, and the public gen
erally, as well as his constituents, are
waiting with interest what he will
have to say.
My Dear Mike" is innocent of the
charge of having put either Governor
Hunt or his protege. Senator Fred T.
Colter, in the hole that they now find
themselves placed in. It is quite
true tiiat Mike may not be innocent
of some other things, but certain it is
that he Is innocent of tnls charge.
"My Djar Mike" is the affectionate
term hy which Governor Hunt ad
dressed M. C. Sullivan as late as
August 16 of this year, at the time
tlie governor was rounding up his po
lit'cal cohorts in the interest of his
candidate for governor. Senator Fred
T. Colt?r. Tiie letter, which the gov
ernor addressed to "My Dear Mike"
was introduced in the case of libel
against Fred S. Breen, editor of the
Coconino Sun, and was reproduced in
the Arizona Gazette' on Wednesday
afternoon.
"My Dear Mike" is reminded of the
iistee deportation and the governor
expresses his regrets that Mik? will
be unable to "return to Arizona this
tail and plan to take part in the cam
paign." The governor apprises Mike
Jt tli3 political situation and de
nounces Senator Fred Sutter, candi
date for the democratic nomination
at that time, as a friend of the corpo
rations, and says he gets all "het up"
whenever he thinks of him.
"My Daar Mike" is further advised
by the governor:
"Then I think Mr. Osborn is not
much better, because a short time
ago, when I was in California, m.v
chauffeur was driving him around and
he remarked to another man who was
in the car that Mooney ought to hang,
and he also doss not believe in ex
perimenting; in fact, I think that he
is just as subservient a tool as Sutter
and I believe the man who really rep
resents progressive democracy Is Fred
Colter.
"I am very giad that the old lady
from Ireland is coming here, and I
l:ope I shall have the pleasure of
hearing her and if I have an oppor
tunity to meet her shall recall the
incident when we Baw ner in Iiisbee."
"My Dear Mike" is aware, although
the reader may not be, that "the old
lady from Ireland" referred to by the
governor is none other than "Mother
Jones," whose record is one of infamy
and time served in jails when she
was not agitating in favor of the 1.
W. W. and the advocates of tho tenets
of that organization. Two. years ago
during the campaign she appeared in
Phoenix and declared that Governor
Hunt was the one governor whose
band she was proud to shake.
"My Dear Mike," having received
the letter from Governor Hunt ad
vocating the candidacy of Fred Col,
tcr, is naturally not aware that the
fact that he was the governor's candi
date was strenuously ucnled on the
stump and through the press by Sen
Ktcr I'oiter and his friends and also
that the I. W. W. itself was weakly
repudiated by those who spoke for
Seaatrr Colter. Nor is Mike aware
that what the governor stated to him
in his litter was not to be proclaimed
in public and that Governor Hunt re
frained from a public announcement
cf his favorite ia the primary, how
ever many hundred letters similar to
that to "My Dear Mike" he may ha
sent out.
"My Dear Miks" has furnished the
connecting link and there can now bs
r.o doubt nor refutation of the fact
that Colter was at all times the candi
date of Governor Hunt and that the
appeal was made for the votes of
the disloyal element represented by
the members of the I. W. W. as is
shown by this letter of Governor
Hunt in which he regrets that Mike
will be unable to return to Arizona in
;he fall and take part iu the cam
paign. Will Candidate Colter repudiate "My
ar Mike," "Mother Jones" and their
class as arrayed In his interest by
the Hunt political machine and make
bis campaign on an appeal for the
suffiag? of the loyal and honorable
element of society?
Will he publicly sever relations
with Ger.rge Wiley Paul Hunt, who
has placed his name and his honor
able ambition to be governor of the
state of Arizona on the low plane that
includes such outcasts of society?
Will he brand as an unwarranted
liberty the appeal in his behalf here
shown to have been made by Govern
or George Wiley Paul Hunt to that
class which claims the privilege of
citizenry at the polls and repudiates
and denies all obligations to govoii
ment and society as organised?
The action of Candidate Collar is
awaited.
IT WILL TAKE MORE THAN A SCRAP OF PAPER TO BALANCE THE
SCALES I

GRAIN MARKET.
CIIK'ACO. Oct. 21. Corn prices
broke shaiply today under selling
pressure due to bearish versions of
ihe German reply to President Wil
son's note. Uncertainty, however, as
to the real meaning of the Berlin

siderable extent. The linish was un

Oats closed U to "si" down and pro

Before uows was received that the

market had a decided upward swing,
influenced almost wholly by the fact
that delay to the answer was con

an aguressive character and had be
come nearly exhausted when about
one hour before the close a sudden
Increase of selling denoted tha effects
of the supposed bearish tenor of Ger

were more or less conflicting, and

Oats parelleled the action of corn.

OF INFLUENZA
ARE REPORTED
SEVEN DEATHS ARE REPORTED
IN COUNTY SINCE SATURDAY
MORNING THREE IN DISTRICT,
THREE IN DOUGLAS AND "ONE
IN PEARCE
The influenza epidemic in the War
ren district shows no improvement.
The cold damp weather of the past
few days has tended to increase the
number of cases and several who
were reported as improving have had
reverses and are now in a dangerous
condition on account of pneumonia.
On Sunday there were three deaths
reported in the Warren district and
one from Pearce. There were three
deaths from the disease in Douglas.
The deaths in Bisbee were those of
Mrs. Clara Kaufman, George Wahlin,
at the C. & A. hospital, and that of

National Good Roads Move
ment Given Impetus by
Commercial Club's Joining
Two Bodies
Further activity on the part of the
Warren district in the national good
roads movement for the future de
velopment of highways and for the
co-ordination of highways with other
transportation agencies or the coun
try, was taken by ths board of di
rectors of the Warren District Com
mercial club at their meeting last
Saturday when the club became a
member of the Highway Industries
association, a national organizaiion
with headquarters in Washington, D.
C. In addition, the Commercial club
took under consideration the namin.?
of a delegate to the convention of
the American Industries association
and American Association of State
Highwav officials, December 2 to 6,
inclusive, at Chicago.
Through becoming a member of
the American Industries association
the Warren District Commercial club
will enter actively into the formula
tion of plans and the carrying out
of programs for road and highway im
provements which will follow a dec
laration of P?ace. At the convention
in Chicego the general road situation
today will be taken up and plans and
recommendations formulated for the
future development of this important
problem. Co-operation with the gov
ernment of state and nation by high
way associations to the end that the
highways may render the maximum of
service in t lie transportation system
of the government, will also be under
discussion at the convention.
Announcement that the Warren dis
trict has completed the organization
of the Cochise county local of the
Dixie Overland Highway association,
and that this county will be included
in the surveys of the proposed route
of this highway, was also made from
the office of the Commercial club yes
terday afternoon. Routing parties of
the Dixie association are expected to
visit this district within the next two
months, and following their report to
the national commission of the asso
ciation it. is anticipated that the Co
chise county link of the Borderland
route will be included in the official
route of the Dixie association.
SOLDIERS TO MAKE
ALLOTMENTS TO
HOMES UNDER PLAN
GOVERNMENT CHANGES MODE OF
SENDING ALLOTM ENTS TO
RELATIVES OF MEN IN SERVICE
AVOIDS CONFUSION AND
DELAY
If a man desires to continue allot
ments, which under the new plan can
no longer be made through the bureau
of war risk insurance, he must make
the allotment through the appropriate
officer who has charge of his ac
counts and it will be paid through the
following offices:
In the army, through the "Office of
the Quartermaster General of the Uni
ted States Army, Washington. D. C."
In the navy, through the "Navy Al
lotment Officer, Navy Department,
Dashington, D. C."
In the marine corps, through the
"Paymaster, United States Marine
Corps Headquarters, Washington,
D. C."
In the coast guard, through the
"Captain Commandant, United States
Coast Guard, Washington. D. C."
Reasons for These Changes
It is important that soldiers' and
sailors' families understand that the
changes outlined above were deter
mined upon after careful study and
with the approval of the war depart
ment and navy department for the
purpuse of speeding up delivery of
government checks to the relatives cf
enlisted men.
Under the new plan the payment of
allotments and allowances Is simpli
fied. The bureau of war risk insur
ance will now handle allotments of
only two amounts $15 and ?20. For
merly the allotment was a sliding
scale and had to be changed every
time a man's pay was increased by
promotion or otherwise. Th's required
from 130,000 to 200,000 changes per
month.
By transferring to the v ar and navy
departments all allotments not carry
ing allowances the bureau of war risk
Insurance can concentrate all it at
tention upon the payments to persons
entitled to government allowance, and
it is believed that this simplification
of the work will tend to speed up
the delivery of checks "to these per
sons Although the institution of these
chances may cause temporary delay
and concern to soldiers' families un
less the reasons for the changes are
carefully explained, it Is expected that
the ultimate result will greatly re
bound to their benefit, and the quar
termaster general's office states that
no delay is anticipated.
In some instances, however, rela-;
tive3 of a soldier or sailor m:iy find i
that their man in the service has not !
taken the necessary steps outlined
above to see that his people at home
continue to receive the same pay
ments as formerly through the war
MEN
and navy departments instead of
through 'the bure:'ii i f war risk insur
ance; In such c-ises the relatives
should write him uiging upon him
the necessity of taking the necessary
action. It is a matter which lies pure
ly in his discretion. He is under no
compulsion from die government.
To Relieve Any Resulting Hardships
It is also ;if the greatest importance
that soldiers and sailors and their
families should lie inspired with con
fidence that if distress results in any
case by reason of these changes in
governmental procedure ' the Red
Cro.;s home service stands ready to
relieve it. Where necpssary to pre
vent hardships the Red Crops wil;
make interim payments from its own
funds until the government checks
arrive. Relatives of enlisted men
should not regard this as charity, but
as part of the responsibility which
the Red Cross has assumed for main
taining the morale of American sol
diers and sailors by instilling them
with confidence that their families
will not suffer for the necessities of
life during their absence.

TLE ONES, WHO SUFFER
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz.. Oct. 21. In
response to a suggestion made by the
Cecil ise County Food Conservation
U?alers' association, the federal food
administration for Arizona is urging

chants throu; !'Ci't the state in a mat
ter which amy be a v'rai- fa. tor in

the result that a famine in this par
ticular line of baby food exists, and
countless infants, depending upon it,
are deprived of their sole nourish
ment. Tl'.3 present abnormal ('cnand, as
ofrt food officials, is d'K' without ques
tion to the selfish and unpatriotic
practice indulged in by certain house
holders in changing from unsweet
ened milk in order to obtain an extra
allowance of sugar.
Merchants of Arizona, therefore, are
caUad upon to refuse the sale of such
milk except to families having small
children. J. W. Dorris. state mer
chants' representative of the food ad
ministration lends his hearty approval
of the plan and asks that nil mer
chants' associations adopt resolutions
to this effect and to obtain rigid en
forcement.
