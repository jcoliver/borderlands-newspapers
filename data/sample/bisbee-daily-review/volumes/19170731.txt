ly Opposes Measure.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 30 The fight
for nation wide prohibition by
constitutional amendment op
ened in the senate today un
der unanmous consent agreement to
take final vote Wednesday. The final
debate was purely perfunctory with
tut few senators in their seats, a
small number of spectators in the gal
leries. Senator Sheppard, author of the
pending resolution to submit such an
amendment to the states, opened the
debate and was followed by Senator
Underwood, who, in a brief speech, op
posed the resolution. The only other
speakers were Senators Ashurst and
Sanfroth, both of whom supported it
The debate will continue tomorrow j
and a large number of senators have ;
declared their intention of speaking. !
Demon Rum Assailed. ,
The constant activity of the liquor
interests is a peril to free institutions,
Senator Sheppard told the senate, ;
while alcoholic liquor itself is a men-
ace to the nation's wealth, morals and '
efficiency Organized labor, be said,
has been asked to oppose prohibition
because bartenders and brewery and j
- distillery employes are members of
unions.
"Labor is asked to imperil its very
existence," said the Texas senator, "to
take food from the mouths, and cloth
es from the tacks of men. women and
children to sustain a traffic meaning
hunger, disease, insanity and death
for the masses, while the liquor barons
thrive in luxury.
"If the liquor traffic is to be eradi
cated, the aid of the federal govern
ment must be invoked. The partner
ship between the liquor traffic and the
federal government is one of the
most frightful hearitages of the civil
war."
Close Vote Expected.
Senator Underwood declared adop
tion of the bill would "have a tendency
to centralize our government under a
police autocracy such as exists in Ger
many and Austro-Hungary," entrench
ing national authority and weakening
the sovereignty of the people.
"I see no reason why we cannot
now trust, as we have in the past, the
enlightened electorate of each state to
.pass the necessary laws for the do
mestic control of their own people,"
the Alabama senator continued. "If
the federal government is once called
on to enter the field, apprehend ani
punish the petty vices of the citizens
of the states in respect to the matters
authorized by this resolution it will
not be long before efforts will be
made to further the police powers of
the federal government and this will
result in destroying state boundaries
and the abolition of state govern
ments." Leaders expect the vote on the res
olution to be close. A two-thirds ma
jority is required for passage.

THE principles and work of the Citizens' Protective

terday by Samuel Gompers, president of the Ameri-
Federation of Labor in
can
president of the local chauffeurs union. Francis and
other members of the organization had been invited to
enroll as members of the Citizens Protective League.
Wishing to hear from Gompers before affiliating with
any organization but their own, they wired the follow
ing principles of the league to him, asking his opinion of
them :
"The undersigned residents and taxpayers of the
Warren District hereby enroll themselves as members
of the Citizens' Protective League, the purpose of which
shall be to promote better city and county government ;
to preserve order and enforce law; to reduce taxes and
to foster and protect the best interest of the District with
out discrimination against any man because of his mem-
.bership or non-membership in any organization or so-
ciety. '
Gompers reply follows:
"Telegram received. The right of the workers of
Biebee or elsewhere to organize or join any bona fide or
ganization for the protection and promotion of their
interests and rights is not only lawful but commendable.
The workers of Bisbee should repudiate any organiza-n
tion that pursues an unlawful course or has improper
or un-American aims. At the same time all should insist
upon the right to extend the field of opportunity and
influence of the furtherance of the interests of the work
ers and aid in promoting general welfare. '

here that the time Is not far distant

so close to the actual fighting front

Following up the British advance
the railway men find bridges blown

ating department
To lay a mile a day of this broad-
gauge railway is not an uncommon
feat. "Our best sustained record," said
the colonel in charge of one gang, "is
4 3-4 miles in five days. We have just
finished one stretch of line. We had
fir to build a bridge 140 feet long.
That was started on Friday and finish
ed on Tuesday. Then we had to clear
the road beyond, which was littered
with German ties, torn rails and Other
material. We started at 6 on Tuesday
and had finished laying the line by
Wednesday midnight. We had 600
men clearing the road and 150 working
on the stool actually laying the rails.
"Twenty-two miles of light railway
were put in the new territory at the
Ancre river fight."
These railway men do not even use
cement in building the foundations for
their bridges. Strong timber flung
across is the only support. "No wait
ing for cement parapets here," said
the colonel. "We build the line as
they build a pioneer line in the west."

PROVISION FOR
FOOD BOARD IS
FINALLY KILLED
President Wilson's Interven
tion Causes Conferees to
Break Deadlock on Admin
istration Control BlLL
WASHINGTON, July 30. Yielding
to the urgent request of President Wil
son, senate and house conferees on the
food bill today eliminated the provis
ion for a food board of three members
instead of a single administrator and
consented to make one effort to agree
regarding the section creating a war
expenditure committee of congress.
Before today's meeting the president
conferred at the White House with
Representative Lever, heading the
house members, and Senator Chamber
Iain, the administration's senate spok
esman, and earnestly Insisted upon
one-man food control and elimination
of the clause creating the expenditures
committee. Within an h'our after re
convening the senate conferees yield
ed on the food administration section,
adopting the original house proposal
that the president appoint an maiv i
ual administrator not subject to sei
ate confirmation.
The agreement was reached by a
bare marjority of one. The house con
ferees, Republiacns and Democrats
alike, stood solidly for one-mrtn food
control and are united on striking out
the congressional war supervising
committee.
The president's Intervention, the
conferees declared, was largely instru
mental in breaking thei- deadlock on
the food administration dispute. His
course was criticized by some mem
bers and some sharp tilts in conference
were reported. Senator Gore said to
night that the conferees had been "de
nied a full and free conference."
Sucecss Of the food administration.
President Wilson told the conferee's
leaders, largely depends upon its man
agement by one man. He said a larg
er board would "seriously interfere"
with successful conduct of the war.
There were persistent but unconfirmed
reports that the president felt reten
tion of either three-member board or
the congressional committee would be
sufficient cause for a veto. Senator
Chamberlain declared positively that
the president gave no intimation to
that effect during the conference.
Reception by the senate of the pro
vision for an individual food adminis
tration is uncertain, although Demo
cratic leaders expect the conference
report to be accepted.
Some of the senate conferees be
lieve, however, that the senate is so
overwhelmingly for toe war expendit
ures committee that a report elimin
ating it might be rejected. They told
the house conferees today that a pri
vate senate poll indicated insistence
upon the provision.
In yielding on the food admiinstra
tion section the senate conferees se
cured adoption of a new section pro
viding for & board of three members,
one of whom would be the president
Of an agricultural college, to fix wheat
prices based upon the standard pre
scribed by congress for next year's
crop of not less than $2 per bushel for

AMERICAS QUICKNESS
IN SUPPLYING ALLIES
PRAISED BY ITALIAN
(By Review Leased Wire.)
ROME, July 30. Ouiseppe Canapa,
food controller in the Italian cabinet.
talking to the Associated Press about
aid fiOm the United States to the en
tente allies said "The efforts of the
American government to help the al
lies solve the grave problem of sup
plies are fully known and appreciated
in Italy.
"Besides the military aid which
America is already giving the entente,"
he added, "and which will have a de
cisive influence of the war, American
co-operation in the question of supplies
is of essential interest to our country."
"We receive the greater part Of our
supplies both for the conduct of the
war and for living, from the American
market," he said, "and the promptness
of the financial aid given the allies has
already relieved us of great difficulties
and anxieties. Equally Important is
the help which America will give us
through the proposed legislation en
suring adequate regular supplies to
the allies at reasonable prices. Meas
ures already adopted lO regulate the
cereals market and center them in
European ports of the allies with the
efforts for an increased yield deserve
the highest praise. .
"The control of the merchant marine
by the United States government."
Senor Canapa declared, ' will have ex
cellent results in the use of shipping
for the transportation of urgently need
ed supplies, at the same time prevent
ing excessive rates.
"Our new ally," said the foOd con
troller, "prudent and enlightened on
every question, with sincere idealism
joined to common sense, prompt in ac
tion after mature reflection, perfectly
has understood that the long war must
soon be won by force of arms but not
less so by providing subsistence for
the people. Thus the United States
government has appreciated from the
beginning the vital question of supplies
for (heir European allies and is hasten
ing to solve it, undertaking a colossal
work to organize a new lOod adminis
tration unprecedented in the , history
of the world.
"Italians are deeply grateful to the
American people, - congress and the
government," said Senor Canapa ' in
conclusion, "for what they have done
already and for what Is to be dOhe in
the line of supplies. With their tradi
tional courage and magnificent altru
ism, whereof they have given us proof
by coming into the war, we feel sure
the Americans will not hesitate to g:ve
us the assistance that ' will insure a
combined victory." '

(By Review Leased Wire.)
DENVER. July 30. Placards, bear
ing an account of the Colorado Fuel &
Iron Company's negotiations with the
representatives of the United Mine
Workers of America relative to the
strike which that organization has no
tified the state industrial commission
would be called about August 1. were
posted today in all camps of the com
pany. The poster, which Is signed by Pres
ident J. F. Welborn of the company,
says in part:
"The Colorado Fuel & Iron Com
pany will continue to operate under
the Industrial representation plan and
agreement, whicB it believes have
been satisfactory to a large majority
of its employes, in spite of the present
hostility of union officials and organ
izers, who have had free access to our
camps. .The officers stand ready nt
any time to adjust grievances by the
methods prescribed in this plan,
which provides for final appeal In ev
ery case to the state industrial com
mission. "The company is earnestly striving
to protect and improve the interests
of its employes. Its loyalty to them
cannot be questioned and it naturally
expects equal loyalty on the part of
the employes toward the company and
the mutual interests of both company
and employes, as outlined in the in
dustrial representation plan. In view
of the present emergency I agreed to
this unusual conference for the adjust
ment of grievances but shall expect
that hereafter all grievances will be
taken up through the regular channels
provided'in the Industrial representa
tion plan.
"If the United Mine Workers of
America insist on calling a strike, it
will be on the sole issue of union rec
ognition which will not be granted.
Such action would be in direct defi
ance of all rights of unorganized labor
and I confidently believe that the
larger portion of our employes would
refuse to leave their work.
,"As I have already stated to the Col
orado Industrial Commission, unlet i
contrary to my belief thpre are no
serious grievances as to either wages
or working or living condition .which
the company officials have refused to
fairly adjust, it will certainly be little
short of treason to attempt to partic
ipate a strike amonb coal miners at
this critical time in th history of our
country."

"It depends very largely upon th
French whether we shall get through

said gentlemen. We make this inquiry
in the interest of the public welfare
and to the end that if the said gentle
men do not propose to take any action
that we be advised to that effect in
the very near future and thus save
valuable time. If there is any delay
because of a certain communication
(copy of which you sent us) address

test against any delay for that reason,
and beg to inform your excellency
that under no circumstances can we
recognize the said person as repre

reason cannot enter into any negotia

plants being manned by volunteer he'p
and company officials. The union
maintains a few pickets on the roads
leading to the mines, but these, with
the unusual number of idle men on

would be taken by the International
Union until Governor Gunter takes
further action in his plan to end the

noon. Although not on either line-up.
one Jupiter Pluvius. better known as
common, unadulterated rain, hutted
into the game and made it necessary
for the players to frequently duck un
der cover. At that, however, the game
was a good one and a good-natured
crowd left the park satisfied with the
exhibition. The C. & A. band was on
hand with a lively bunch of music, and
this helped lake the edge off tho
grouches caused by the aforesaid Mr.
Pluvius. '

COPENHAGEN, July 30. German
newspapers variously interpret the
talk on peace by Dr. Michaelis, the
German imperial chancellor to news
paper men in the Berlin.
The Berlin papers of the stamp of
Vorwaerts profess to find in the chan
cellor's concluding phrase a clear dis
avowal of all annexation plans while
the Pan-German and annexationist or
gans are no less satisfied with the dec
larations and they, lay weight on the
alleged designs of conquest entertain
ed by Gearman's opponents as nullify
ing all overtures for a moderate peace.
The Tages Zeitung says the revela
tions made by the imperial chancellor
show the necessity of material and
comprehensive security for Germany's
future in the peace treaty and proved
how1 childish and comic are German
discussions of peace based on under
standing and subsequent reconcilia
tion. Varwaerts regrets the chancellor did
not expressly state that Belgium
would be given entire freedom.
CONSTANCYY.
The mist came up and hid the hill.
But I knew that it was there.
So what could be the difference
If it was plain and bare?
I knew a bill of pines and fern
And dogwood blossomed too;
I would have it where the should
of
mist
Hid the plain, bare one from view.
I moved the hill of pines and fern
O'er a thousand miles of waste
And set It in the shroud of mist
And held it there by faith.
And now when I grow weary,
From climbing a plain, bare hill.
I know the one of pines and fern
Is standing standing still.

A GREAT MEDICINE
That most successful of all remedies,
for woman's ailments, Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound, owes its
origin to a botanic recipt which came
into the possession of Lydia E. Pint
ham about 50 years ago.
This recipe had proved so effective
in the practice of a skilled physician
that Mrs. Pinkham procured the herbs
and steeped and prepared them ir. true
old-time fashion on her kitchen stove
for her friends and neighbors who suf
fered from woman's ailments. The
fame of the virtues of this wonderful
medicine spread, until it is today rec
ognized as the standard remedy for
woman's Ills. Adv.
with highly satisfactory results for
Scrofula. Being made of the roots
and herbs of the forest, it is guaran
teed purely vegetable, and absolutely
free from all mineral ingredients.
You can obtain S. S. S. from any

ARIZONA'S ROAD PROBLEM.
The most clinching argument .to be uesd in behalf of
good roads and, as applied to the particular case of Co
chise county, the proposed bond issue, is a trip over the
highway between Bisbee and Douglas. Each subdivision
of the state has similar arguments to offer. Some of
them are more effective; some less. On the whole, the
conclusion reached must be the same:
Build better, buy better, and administer the building
and buying with efficiency.
America has spent more money, proportionately, on
road building than any other country in the world.
America has less to shew, in the matter of good roads,
than any other country. There has been absolutely no
uniformity of design in our highway construction and no
attempt made to co-ordinate the work of the various
states and the various counties. Paving and road build
ing has been a political football, the outgrowth of the
spoils system and designed to bolster private fortunes and
public taxes.
In Arizona there has been much unnecessary expense
connected with the roads which have been constructed
The highways in this state remind the traveler of some
farming regions, where one cultivator is industrious and
a fine farm is the result, but whose next door neighbor
is slovenly and whose ground is allowed to loaf and waste
its time.
Between -Bisbee and Tucson there are several exam
pies of this feature. A good road will be the pleasant
surprise of the tourist for some miles. Then, the auto
mobile will encounter some of the worst possible navigat
ing. So it is, all over the state. There has been little co
operation between the counties and the connecting links
between them, as a consequence, are, in many cases, pass
able only.
There is a light ahead in the highway commission
law, passed by the last state legislature, and the gradu
ally awakening of the public to the fact that public
funds, to be applied to the construction of roads, must
be administered by non-partisan officials and men who
have no political ax to grind.
In Cochise county, on October 9. the taxpayers will
vote upon the question of a million dollar bond issue.
Maricopa county will vote on a larger levy. The high
way commission has been appointed in this county, and
includes the ablest men obtainable, resident of the sub
division. They are men who have no political ambitions
but who desire good roads and whose one object in ac
cepting appointment to the commission is to see that a
dollar spent will represent a dollar in actual construc
tion and return to the people.
Cochise county is also fortunate In having the most
competent highway engineer in the state, in J. C. Ryan.
The roads he has surpervised have been as permanent
as the class of construction permitted. Pima county has
just passed through a siege of road building. It was
handled, apparently, in a haphazard manner and a full re
turn was not received by the taxpayers.
Road officials in Arizona are not, necessarily, enti
tled to severe criticism. They were merely links in a
system which did not permit of the highest efficiency.
It has been wondered bow such roads as that from Bis
bee over the divide and several other stretches of high
way have come to pass. They become all the more re
markable whap the facts under which the builders worked
are taken under consideration.
Arizona, like every other state, is face to face with a
big problem, in its roads. Through the highway com
missions, on which there promises to be appointed men
of character and high capacity, the solution should be
nearer. The first necessity is to secure the greatest
amount of first class work for the smallest amount of the
taxpayers' money; the second question to be solved is a
standardization of roads which will do more to tire last
ing efficiency and the gradual decrease in the cost ot
roads than any other single factor. -
Thomas E. Campbell, last Saturday, in a letter to the of
ficer, asked that he return over the effects of his office
to Captain Oscar F. Temple. The reason assigned for
the action, on the part of the state's chief executive, is
that there is no furthre use for the office.
The colonel has had a nice time since he has held
office in 'Arizona, There is no reason why he shouldn't,
perhaps. The job has been a sinecure in this state, any
way; the principal reason for its existence being the ne
cessity of keeping the national guard at its lowest effi
ciency rather than a useful part of the state's organiza
tion. Harris was appointed by the lamented Mr. Hunt. The
latter gentleman wanted a national guard because he saw
on way by which he could eliminate it He wanted a
guard, however, which mould be anything but what its
name implies. He used the guard on one occasion and
it was necessary for the United States marshal to send
in special deputies in order to protect mining property
while assessment work was being done.
Yes, it was, as Kipling says, "a beautiful little
army.
Colonel Harris ran the guard as a personally con
ducted exhibition of incapacity. In the guard there were
any number of eminently capable men. Their hands
were tied. They dared not move and some even left the
service as a consequence of Harris' maladministration,
Harris tangled with every man who advanced an idea for
the organization's improvement. The army officers, who
were sent to Arisona to aid the guard, found in the
colonel a man who was neither reasonable nor approach
able. The state's troops lost caste with the government
but the cause could not be removed. Until Hunt was
defeated at the polls Harris tenure of office seemed as
sured. The adjutant general thought in the same groove
as did the chief executive.
Now, however, Harris has come to the parting of the
ways. The Arizona national guard is in camp at isaco.
Its officers and enlisted men are free of the domination
of the Tempe giant. As a consequence, the Arizona con
tingent is a first class organization, and a credit in every
way. Harris has nothing to do. There is nothing for him
to play with and Governor Campbell desires that the of
fice be vacated until such time as there is necessity for
the resumption of the work. Harris refuses to resign. He
wants and needs the job. He might find it necessary to
hibernate if that is possible in a Tempe summer climate
and lose his meal ticket.
Whether or not the governor can force the issue
with Harris and force him to resign is a matter which
has not been thoroughly threshed out to a satisfactory
conclusion. The need is apparent, however, and if Col
onel Harris is so desirous of serving his country he might
be able to dodge the federal officials and go to Prance.
He would look better with i gas mask, anyway, than ho
does as the important servint of the people of Arizona
at a time when his services are entirely superfluous.
WASHINGTON ISSUES
ORASIICCEHSORSHIP
PECULIAR SEASONS.
When the visitor in Phoenix complains of the heat
he is immediately told that "it is the hottest summer
in history"; when the miner seeks surcease from the
norths cold and goes to Warren in the spring, he is told
"the wind is terrible now, worse than ever before," and
now there are some in Bisbee who are wondering why
the elements have twisted their working hours around
and are dumping their overloaded carryalls of rain at
night
Maybe, it is raining more at night than in the pre
vious history of Bisbee. If that is the case, it is a wel
come innovation to the people of the community. Those
who find it necessary to labor at night and who prefer
to play at night are certainly in the minority.
The fact remains that rain is rain and, whenever
it comes to Southern Arizona, it is more than welcome.
Every day's mail brings to the desk of the editor
of the Review some congressman's speech in favor of the
food control bill. These speeches are all lifted from the
Congressional Record and printed by the government
and sent out under a government mail frank. And thus
do these congressmen achieve fame. Nebraska, South
Dakota, 'Montana, Ohio, politicians representing all these
states in Washington seek to spread the glory and the
grandeur of their name across the valleys and mountain'
ranges of Arizona, But if these near statesmen really
want favorable mention in the Review, let them ruslt
the food control bill through to passage free of all
amendments. Let them vote for it more and talk about
it less. Then, and not until then, will they win ' praise
and golden opinions from this voice of freedom in iar
off Arizona,
The bureau of mines department of the University
of Arizona has sent out a series of handsomely printed
cards in red and black upon which ere printed epigrams
that are well calculated to impress and help by their
terse effectiveness. They have the punch. One of them
reads: "In less than another generation there will be a
lot of good ragtime players and one-steppers in the poor
house." Another: "A mule makes no headway while ho
is kicking, neither does a man." Here is a third: "One
example is worth a thousand arguments."
This country is raising an immense army, but is
not doing It in the way that Col. Bryan predicted. There
are': so many things being accomplished In the United
States in defiance of the views of Bryan.
Among the crops that should be encouraged this
year is hemp, in order that we may have a plentiful sup
ply of rope when we get around to dealing properly
with the pirates who are artificially stimulating the prices
of foodstuffs.
Has the naval advisory board ever thought to refer
the U-boat problem to our high school graduates? They
undoubtedly could solve the matter easily euough.
Several of the members of the Italian commission
are ill in the east. They probably could not get away
with the American-cooked macaroni without bad results.
(By Review Leased wire)
WASHINGTON. July 30. A new list
of press regulations making material
cuanges in the voluntary censorship
rules under which American newspa
pers have been operating was promul
gated tonight by the committee on
public information.
The new regulations contain the
first general request that there be
published no mention of the arrival of
American troops at Eui'jpean ports,
replacing in that respect an express
authorization in the old rules for use
of any cable dispatches passed by the
European censors.
Other sections of the old regulations
are made more severe by specific stip
ulations in place of the more general
language employed in the rules in
lOrce until now. Information which
the government considers might re
veal military movements or policies is
described in detail.
"Re-Statement" Made
In the statement accompanying the
new regulations, George Creel, chair
man of the committee, says that ' re
peated and serious violations of the
voluntary censorship have been at
tempted to be excused on the score of
misunderstanding," and that a "re
statement" is made with the idea that
hereafter there shall be no room for
doubt as to the committee's desires,
The instances to which the most ser
ious charges of violation ;have been
made, however, have not resulted from
misunderstanding Of the committee's
rules but from following them implic
itly. These instances have involved
publication of dispatches passed ojr
the European censor announcing the
arrival of American military units in
Europe. On this subject the commit
tee's only standing rule contained in
the general list promulgated May 28
and never replaced nor revoked, was
as follows:
"All messages received from abroad
by cable or wireless are censored at
the point of dispatch or receipt and
are free for publication unless some
especial circumstances arouses the
suspicion of the editor.
Censorship Approved
The new rules instead of stating this
principle, substitute lVr it a prohibi
tion of publication of:
Information of the arrival at an;
European port of American war ves
sels, transports or any portion of an
expeditionary force, combatant or non-
combatant, until announcement is au
thorized by the secretary of war or by
the secretary of the navy."
Secretary Baker and Sir. Creel were
seen together at the former's office to
night by a representative of the Asso
ciated Press. In reply subscribed to
the language in the paragraph discuss
ing alleged violations, Mr. Baker said
he had approved the whole statement,
although be had not written.it Mr.
Creel said that Secretary Daniels, who
could not be reached tonight also had
approved the statement before it was
issued. .
Mr. Baker authorized die statement
that he had in mind, in relation to the
strong language employed by Mr.
Creel, no specific newspaper or press
association. In the harsh language
used, he insisted the purpose has been
to do what many press representetives
sked to be done, to "scold" offenders.
The secretary said he had received a
report from the war college . showing
nine, separate items puonsnea in
American papers of resent date whicli
the officers at the college regarded as
furnishing valuable information to the
enemy. t
New Press Rules
Mr. Creel declared that, the purpose
of the paragraph referred to was gen
eral, not directed at any .specific case
or cases. t
The whole purpose of the new regu
lations, both Mr. Baker and Mr. Creel
insisted, was to make impossible any
further misunderstanding of what was
desired.
The committee's statement foi.Ows:
"The desires of the government with
respect to the concealment from the
enemy of military policies, plans and
movements, are set forth in the follow
ing specific requests. They go to the
press of the United States directly
from the secretary Of war and secre
tary of the navy and represent thought
nd advice on their technical advices.
For the protection of our military
and naval forces and of merchant snip

HIGHER CORPORATION
AND INCOME TAXES TO
RAISE REVENUE BILL
Revision of Measure Is Started
by Senate Finance Commit
tee Whiskey and Beer
Must Also Pay More.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. July 30. Revision
of the war tax bill to increase lis to
tals from $1,670,000,000 to about $2.
000,000,000 was undertaken by the sen-
ate finance committee while house
leaders informally discussed measures
to provide further against the increas
ed estimates of this year's war expen
ditures. Final action was not approved by
the senate committee, but Chairman
Simmons announced today that the
concensus of the committee opinion in
dicates that the following cflanges will
be made in the tax measure:
Imposition of most of the tax in
creases on corporations and individ
uals having incomes of 20,000 and
more.
Material modification of the so-call
ed Jones amendment which in its pres
ent form levies 15 per cent upon cor
porations' undistributed surpius-.
M increase of the normal income
tax rate on individuals, but an in
crease, probably to 6 per cent, of tuat
on corporations.
Additional taxes on intoxicating
beverages including w hisky, beer and
wines.
Increase of some of the consump
tion taxes imposed in the bill on su
gar, tea, coffee and cocoa, and possibly
addition of a few new consumption
taxes.
Addition of a few news mall taxes.
The exact division of the new tax
burden has not been decided, but in
creased corporation income taxes
probably would raise about $170,000,
000 of the $300,000,000 to be added tt
the bilL The normal rate probably
will be made 6 per cent. It is 2 per
cent under present law and an increase
to 4 per cent was provided in tne bill
as it passed the house.
Committee sentiment has crystal
lized decidedly against further in
creasing individual income taxes ex
cept on incomes of $20,000 and more.
The additional increase in rates on in
toxicating beverages probably will not
be large. As drawn the bill w'juld
double the present rate on whisky ana
greatly increase' that on beer.
Should consumption taxes be in
creased, it if expected the proiosed
-rate of one-half cent a pound on sugar1
f would be raised. Among new revenue
sources the committee is considering
Is a new tax on petroleum products,
including gasoline.
Whether the Jones amendment tax
ing corporations' .undivided surplus 15
per cent is to be reduced in its levy
or entirely eliminated was not, decided.
The committee decided today to
change the basjs of war profits taxa
tion so as to include, under the exemp
tion clause, certain concerns in exist
ence before the war.

deported men," he said. "A number of
them gave me letters from their wives
asking for assistance and information,
I promised that when I was in Bisbee
I would see their wives and families.
"On July 26 I interviewed Governor
Campbell in Phoenix and received two
letters of introduction, one to Harry
C. Wheeler, sheriff of Cochise county,
the other to Jacob Erickpon, mayor
of Bisbee. The letters were substan

''After informing him who I was,

" 'In behalf of Mr. Moore, I know I
can command your best co-operation
as to the purpose of bis visit and I
beg to thank you in anticipation of af
fording him all the privileges of the
Warren district, which are his due as
a law-abiding citizen.'
"I did not arrive in Bisbee until
about 10:30 this morning. I register
ed at the Copper Queen Hoted from
Chicago. I was told that Sheriff
Wheeler's office was in Tombstone. I
made inquiry for the mayor at the city
hall and was told that he was at work
but would be in his office at 4:30. I
introduced myself to the city judge
and was talking with him when a Mr.
Vucovich came in. He told me his
brother had been among the deported
men, but had returned and had been
ordered to appear before the commit
tee and then was before the commit
tee. I decided to go before the com
mittee to advise them of my presence
and to see what could be done in be
half of Vucovich.
Requested to Leave.
"On arriving at the committee room
I asked for some member of the com
mittee and one of them coming out
I told him who I was and what my
business was. After some delay, I was
ushered into the presence of between
25 and 50 men. Most of the talking
was done by four or five. I repeated
to them who I was. One of them
questioned the existence of the gov
ernor's letters and I showed them.
Both letters were read by the chair
man of the committee. Then I was in

when I said I expected to see the may

that they would take care of him. I
could get no information about Vuco-1

had telegraphed me while in Phoenix,
asking my good offices. Then I was
told my presence in Bisbee was high

presence would give moral support ro
the men and women wbo sympathized
with the deported men. The commit
tee was very frank, one member say
ing my presence .was a menace lo
them. I was told to return before the
committee at 4:30.
I went to the telephone office and
called the governor. I succeeded in
getting him at 4.30. I told him of de
velopments and asked that he call the
commfttee before which I was to ap

of the telephone booth I was met by

"When I walked into the committee
room the chairman was talking over
the telephone with someone, his con

telephone he said he had not seen the

thought he was talking with the gov

GLOBE, July 30. Despite the ract
that former Governor George W. P.
Hunt announced this evening that the
strike, which is tying up the biggest
copper producing district in the world
was "pracically at an end," .the mine
amnagers refuse to make any definite

According to Hunt, who is the per

the three big operating companies.
Regarding these conferences. Gen

second vacancy 'occurs this shall be
filled in the same manner and an elec

which two members shall be elected
and the members appointed to fill the
vacancies shall cease to serve.
"Regular meetings of the work

that department
"It is understood that Judge. Mc
Bride held similar conferences with
the management and employes .com
mittees of the other companies, and
that similar decisions were arrived at"
John R. McBride, representative or
the department of labor, refused to
make an estimate uiAm the possible
length- of the copper strike in the
Globe-Miami district. However, ne
said that he was heartily in accord
with the statement made by General
Manager P. G. Beckett of the Old Do

NEW YORK, July 30. Little relief
from the monotonous sessions of the
preceding week was furnished by to
day's stock market, prices again man
ifesting uncertain tendency on the nar
rowest dealings of recent months.
Rails were unresponsive to the bet
ter crop outlook and the settlement
of the switchmen's strike, albeit the
latter at no time was a market factor,
and metals were seemingly Indifferent
to 'another advance In the price ot
high-grade coppers.
Local monetary conditions were un
disturbed by the payment of a 20 per
cent Liberty load installment. Steel
and other industrials, together with
shippings, made up the greater part of
the day's business.
Steel rose a point to 123 at the
opening, fell to 122 and rallied lat
er, closing at 124V4. a net gain of 1.
Total sales of stock amounted to 352,
000 shares.
Aside from. Liberty 3'c, which
ranged between 99.33 and 99.47, deal
ings in bonds were nominal. ' Total
sales, par value, $2,360,000.
United States bonds, old issues were
unchanged on call.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, Jly 30. Largely as a
result of the settlement of the switch
men's strike, holders of corn showed
a disposition today to indulge in gen
eral profit-taking sales. Accordingly,
the market had a downward slant
most of the time. Prices closed steady,
unchanged to cents lower, with
September lfZ to 1.63 and De
cember 1.18. to 1.18"i. Wheat fin
ished unsettled, 5 cents off to two
cents up, at 2.62 July and 2.24 Sep
tember, The outcome in oats ranged
from one cent decline to cent ad
vance and in provisions from a set
back of 7 to a rise of 1012 cents.
Welcome rains both sides of the Ca
nadian border, giving relief from hot
winds which had been threatening the
spring wheat crop, turned prices down
grade for the September delivery of
wheat.
Provisions averaged lower, chiefly
in consequence of a break, which took
place in hog prices.

XEW YORK, July 30. The market
, see-saw during the greater part of
'the session, but in the final hour the
price level in practically all issues im
proved. The buying movement in the
closing hour, which was most conspie
ious in the steel shares was repre
sentative chiefly of short covering, al
though the vulnerability of the market
in the face of early pressure inspired
a moderate amount of buying for the
rise.
An added inducement to purchasers
were the reports In circulation, sug
gesting that the second quarter earn
ings of the U. S. Steel corporation
scheduled for publication tomorrow
will make a showing approximately
$130,000,000 mark, the largest for any
three months in the history of the
company. The peace talk of over Sun
day made little or no impression in
local circles, and had no influence in
the day's dealings.
The action of the senate committee
of finance which seems to favor a
slight increase in taxes and the grow
ing activity to cover additional exped
itures through the medrum.of bond
issues, helped encourage the convic
tion that impost on corporate and in
dividual incomes may not be so dras
tic. However, the doing in Washing
ton in respect to price fixing and taxa
tions measures are commanding the
attention of the financial district it
the moment and until final verdict is
rendered a' certain amount of uncer
tainty will prevail.

GERARD'S CLEVERNESS
ENDS HIS GAREER IN
-DIPLOMATIC SERVICE
WASHINGTON, July 30. Judge J.
W. Gerard has resigned from the dip
lomatic service fox good aiid all. Such
is the judgment of official Washington.
And the reasons reflect nothing but
credit upon Judge Gerard.
Nevertheless should Judge Gerard
be accredited by this government as
ambassador to any other nation, even
one of those with whom our friendly
relations are unruffled,- the chances
are that the formula "persona non
grata" would be returned.
This story will run in the Los An
geles Examiner beginning Sunday, Au
gust 5.
Mr. Gerard at Berlin out-Prussianeo.
the Prussians. That Is the reason why
he would be t'oo much feared at any
other chancellory. An ambassador is
supposed to be very dignified and very
ponderous, to move slowly and always
in plain sight, tv be a sort of figure
head, representing his nation; not an
active keen brain. Bernstorff at Wash
ington undertook to play the Gerard
game and left a wake like a paddle
wheel steamer. The papers were kept
busy with revelations of German ac
tivities. Gerard left no more wake at
Berlin than a submarine. That isn't
playing the diplomatic game according
to the rules. . Hence no more diplo
macy for Gerard.
Mark Twain, in his "Yankee at
Prince Arthur's Court," drew a picture
no more genuinely humorous than Ge
rard in Germany. The kaiser, the
crown prince, Hollweg, Zimmerman,
met and talked with this American and
then went on talking their plans, mak
ing their boasts, spinning intrigues to
enmesh the United States in trouble
in Japan, in Haiti and in Mexico, as
unconscious of the fact that he was ob
serving them as the members of
"Prince Arthur's Court" were uncon
sciVms of the telephone or other mod
ern means of communicating.
With the official sanction of the state
department, Gerard is publishing,
through the newspapers of the widest
circulation in the United States, his
memoirs in serial form. No one knows
just how much he realized from the
sale of the serial rights; the bidding
was spirited and the figure was a large
one. The royalties from the book,
when published, will be heavy be;
cause it will be made a part of the ref
erence library of every man interested
in current history. As a lawyer, Ge
rard is sure of a handsome income. So
there is nothing for him to worry
about, even though he is definitely out
of the diplomatic service. He cannot
be a diplomat again, with the rank of
ambassador, because he served his na
tion so well at Berlin.

Hy Review LeaaM Wire).
CHICAGO, July 30. Chicago suffered
in the hottest of the year today, the
temperature reaching a maximum of
98 degrees. The city's chief source of
relief, the lake bathing, was not avail
able today, for the west wind that
came with the heat sent the surface
water out into the lake, leaving the
temperature Vf the water at the bath
ing beaches down near 50. It was too
hot to stay on shore and too cold to
go in thewater.

Brilliant Feats of Daring
By the French Legionaries
TARIS. July 30. The valorous feats
accomplished in the taking of Auberive,;
by individual members of the Foreign!
Legion are named here:
In an assault Sergeant Gailler lo--t j
20 of his grenadiers; with the only one;
who remained he resisted eight Ger-i
mans and forced them to surrender. I
Armengo, a 16-year-jld boy, killed
five Germans with his rifle machine!
gun. He was then seriously wounded '
but refused to allow the stretcher bear
ers to carry him off the field until lie
had shot down his sixth foe.
Four sergeants Dort, Pincard, Gra-
nacher and Lenfant were decorated .
with the military medal on the battle-j
field and Lenfant was named second ,
lieutenant. j
Father Arnal, the priest of the re-i
gi"jn, was again cited in army orders
as follows: "Volunteer almoner of ab-'
solute devotion and rare energy. Nev-
er ceases to encourage the combatants
and to care for the wounded, giving to
all a fine example of bravery and con
tempt of danger. Gave proof of great
danger in accompanying the troops to
the assault of the enemy lines and re
ceived, April 21, his second wound.
Already cited in the order." j
A son 01 itazar-Aga, .Persian minis
ter to France, wtm the following cita
tion:
'Lieut. Nazar-Aga, volunteed fbr the
war's duration, has conducted himself
bravely in all the combats of his regi
ment, particularly in 1915 in Cham-1
pagne, and in 1916 on the Somme. j
Again has given proof, during the re-t
cent operations, of a fine fearlessness j
under fire and of remarkable devo-t
tion. Already wounded, and twice cit-'
ed in army orders fluring the cam--paign
against Germany." j
The fine citations gained by the le- j
gionnaires during this, their latest bat-,
tie, are too numerous to be given here, i
I quote only a few, all of which give;
vivid glimpses of the battlefield:
"De Lannurier, a young captain who,
April 17, 1917, in the most critical cir
cumstances, took while under fire the
command of a battalion, maintained
this c'omniand during three days and
three nights, all the time waging a
combat bitter, continuous, merciless,
against a position solidly organized
and defended to the bitter end by an
enemy superior in number and resolv
ed to resist even until death. By the
quickness of his decisions and by his
cool courage be won the admiration
of every one and largely contributed
to the success of his battalion."
"Adjutant Chef Sapene. A fine sol
dier, of a remarkable devotion and
courage. Won the admiration 'of all
during the combats of April 17-22 by
his superb attitude under fire. Charged
with his section to clear out a system
of difficult trenches, always kept in '.
the lead, firing and hurling grenades
with an ardor which he communicated
to his men. Refused during the entire
combat to take the slightest repose,
keeping up the morale of his leg.'jn-:
naires by his good humor even during :
the hottest moments of the fight.'
"Wermuth: Serves with enthusiasm!
the cause which he has embraced. On '
April 17, during the combat in the en
emy's lines, he offered himself spon '
taneously to replace the grenadiers
who had fallen; fought apart from this
moment with the squad tof grenadiers
in a perfect manner and at his own
wish took part in several dangerous
missions."
The cross of the Legion of Honor
of
I your foods 1
1 v are cooked f
was awarded Adjutant Chef Mader,'
with the following citation: "Under-'
Oliver of a remarkable bravery and
energy; an unexcelled chief jf section
and a veritable leader of men. A1-'
ways at the head of li is troops, he con
ducted himself admirably during the,
combats from April 17 to 21. By for
tunate plans and the accurate fire of
his machine guns, he assured with his
section the capture of an enemy bat-,
tery, putting to flight a company of in-:
fantry which was defending it. Al
ready twice cited In army orders."
Henry Claude of L'o.ston. Ivan Nock
of Baltimore and the late James Paul
of St. Louis also won glowing citations.
General Deligny surely spoke truly
when he said, more than lvulf a cen
tury ago: "Soldiers of the Legion,
the folds of your flag are not broud
enough to write thereon your claims,
to glory."

PEACE TALK IS NOT
APPROVED IN BERLIN
Prediction of German That He
Could Arrange End of War
in an Hour, Meets With
Derision From Press.
(By Review Leased Wire).
BERLIN. July 29. The German of
ficial world apparently is not inclined
to share the optimism with which Ma-'
thias Erzberger exhibited In the recent
interview he gave in Zurich and which
burst in upon Berlin today.
When the Associated Press, corres
pondent inquired whether Herr Erz
bergers presence In' Switzerland and 1
bis announced ambition to sit at a table
opposite Premier Lloyd-George for the ;
purpose of arranging a peace confer ,
ence reflected the sentiments or the
authority of the German government, j
the foreign office replied that Herr;
Erzberger was traveling and talking in ;
a private capacity. !
Herr Erzberger is reported to have
declared to the Zurlcher Nachricnten
that if he "could talk with Lloyd
George (the British premier) or Mr.
Balfour (British foreign secretary,' he
would in a few h'ours reach an under j
standing which would enable official
peace negotiations. . (
"After this interview, Herr Erzberg !
er cannot longer be taken serious,"'
says the Cologne Gazette, "however.
for the sake of the public interest we
would urgently request him to discou- j
tinue playing the role of providence
to the German people."
