AGAIN ON GRILL
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2 Reforms i
in the present military court martial j
system were urged today before the ;
senate military sub-committee by J. j
E. Runcie of New York, instructor at ;
the West Point military academx. Tht j
commission is holding hearings on the j
resolution or senator namDenain ui
Oregon revising the present system of
military justice. Samuel T. Ansel!,
who resigned from the army recently,
after making a long fight against the
present court martial system, will tes
tify Monday.
Mr. Runcie declared the existing
articles of war relating to court mar
tials were obsolete, unjust, absurd and
undemocratic and provide for no auth
oritative interpretation of the court
martial code. He also said too arbi
trary power was conferred upon the
military officers and there could be
no appeal from the court martial pro
ceedings. He recommended modifying
existing codes so as to require trials
to be conducted by men familiar with
law and permit appeal to a body not

OUR
MARTIAL
WAR TIME PROHIBITION LAW IS
UNCONSTITUTIONAL SAYS ELIHU
ROOT IN OPINION TO BREWERS
WASHINGTON. Aug. 2. The
war-time prohibition enforcement
bill recently passed by the house
and now pending before a senate
committee is unconstitutional,
according to an opinion by Elihu
Root, Wr. D. Guthrie, and Wm. L.
Marburn, counsel for the United
States Brewers association, made
public today.
This Vpinion holds that until
the eighteenth amendment be
comes effective on Jan. 16, 1920,
congress under well settled rules
of constitutional law, "has no
power to prohibit the manufac
ture and sale of beer, whether or
not intoxicating."
There , is now no valid reason
for the war-time prohibition act,
the lawyers declare, and there is
no evidence, they add, to support
the claim that the proposed en
forcement measure is necessary '
or proper to conserve the , na
tion's -food supply.
The opinion, an exhaustive
document dealing with all legal
phrases of the question, was
sent to Christian W. Feigenspan,
president of the Erewers associ
ation. The lawyers contended
that while District Judge Hand
and the New York circuit court
of appeals had held the war time
act constitutional, the decision

charging that the Woman's Temper
ance Union was backing a movement
to have anti-nicotine laws enacted
in everyV state.-
Tobaccoless by 1920?
The W. C. T. U. will celebrate its
fiftieth anniversary five years hence
and the organization is hopeful of
having congress submit a constitu
tional amendment before March 20,
1920, says the statement.
The $1,000,000 "drive" begun last
Mach by the White Ribboners, it is
alleged, has for its object the crush
ing of demon nicotine and to this
end the anti-prohibitionists say, $300,

fare, health and morality, education
and information," and other propa
ganda methods by means of the
churches and public schools. The

U. with planning to finance its cam
paign against tobacco without ap
pealing directly for funds or naming
the purpose for which the money is
to be expended.
Text Books Used, Charged
In support of this it asserts that
already "in the guise of public school
recitation books which flagrantly vi
olate the sanctity of the home and
filial devotions, fathers who use to,
bacco are portrayed as filthy and un
fit for childish caresses."
The Investigation disclosed, said
the statement, that a bill has been
Introduced in the Georgia legislature
to prohibit the use of tobacco in any
form and that measures have been
taken in the legislatures of other
southern and western states to put a
ban on cigarettes. The Anti'Saloon
League is also accused of actively
aiding the W. C. T. U. and of having
indorsed the slogan "Nicotine .next."
Dr. P. Charles Green, of Philadel
phia was said to have protested to
the public school authorities of his
city for permitting, he said, the W.
C. T. U. to establish medal contests
and offer money rewards to pupils

ITS
WAR DEPARTMENT TO LAY BILL
FOR UNIVERSAL WAR TRAINING
OF U.S. YOUTH BEFORE CONGRESS
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2. The
war department bill providing
for a moderate system of univer
sal military training as the set
tled military policy of the na
tion, will be laid before congress
without further delay.
Probably it will be in the
.hands of Senators Wadsworth
and Kahn, heads of the two mil
itary committees, early next
week.
Previous plans for extended
conferences with General Per
shing and other overseas offi
cers before presenting the bill
have been abandoned.
Details of the war department's
bill have not been made public,
there are indications, however,
that it differs essentially in some
ways from the Kahn-Chamber-laln
universal training bill al
ready before the committee.
In previous sessions of the
committee dating back to the
; preparedness hearings before
the United States entered the
war, most army officers who tes
tified held that . training should
be given in the nineteenth year.
Secretary Baker expressed the
same views and it is thought
NEGRO RIOTERS
CRICAGO FIRE
Six Blocks of Homes in the
Stockyards District Burned;
Negro Whose Alleged Murder
Started Riots, Was Drowned
CHICAGO, Aug. 2. As a result of
the fire which early today destroyed
six blocks of homes of stockyards
workers, negro labor at the yards will
be barred to prevent a possible recur-
rance of race rioting. This announce
ment was made tonight after a con
ference of Governor Lowden and the
packers. .
The stockyards had been a storm
center of racial feeling during the
riots of fiv days this week, and with
the disappearance of serious outbreaks
yesterday it was planned for the 15.
000 negro workers to return to their
posts at the yards tomorrow, but the
fire, which many of the workers made
homeless declared was started by ne
groes .aggravated feeling and changed
the plans.
Although Fire Attorney McCabe de
clared many had toH him negroes had
been seen to set fires in the neighbor
hood, Governor Lowden was inclined
to believe that labor trouble rather
than race feeling was responsible.
Except about the stockyards, racial
feeling seemed to have subsided to
nights At the fire ruins militiamen were on
duty, as well as in the negro district,
and houses of refuge for the burned
out victims were opened in fire sta
tions.' '
A surprise was caused today when
Coronor Hoffman announced that no
marks of violence had been found on
the body of Eugene Williams, a col
ored youth,' wlio was reported stoned
and knocked from a raft into Lake
Michigan last Sunday, precipitating
riots. . '
The coroner stated the negro had
not been struck by atones, but had
been drowned, careful examination by
a physician showed.
George Stauber. white, is being held
by the police on charge of murder, in
connection with Williams', death.
Only a few minor disturbances oc
curred tyriay. In one case a Mexican,
Theodore Gracla, supposed to have
been mistaken for a negro, was stab
bed, probably fatally, by white men.
The militia will continue to guard
the danger centers for several days.
The sheriff announced today he would
send 1000 special deputies into the riot
district at once. The police still re
main on riot duty, although enough
men for traffic duty have been re
leased. SEIZE RIFLES
BELFAST, Aug. 2 (By tha Asso
ciated Press). Sinn Feiners to
day raided the freight depot at
Greenmore and carried off a quan
tity of rifles which had just ar
rived from England. The rifles
were addressed to the command
ing officer of the Royal artillery.
IT
SINN
FEIN S
probable the war department
plan will be found to call for
the training of youths of 18 in
stead of 18 as provided in the
Kahn-Chamberlain measure.
Another point on which the de
partment's judgment is awaited
with interest is the amount of
training to be required.
Throughout the extended study
of the subject in which various
branches of the general staff
have been engaged ever since
hostilities ceased, this has been
a difficult problem.
The Kahn-Chamberlain bill
would provide for six months
training. There is some reason
to believe that the war depart
ment would be satisfied with half
as much time devoted to intens
ive instruction.
Limiting the training period to
less than six months, some offi
cers have said, would compel
abandonment of all projects for
vocational and other educational
work. All that could be done,
would be to concentrate on pure
ly military instruction of a pri
mary nature as the time would
not permit more than incidental
physical development.

The land was ordered condemned
by the state agrarian commission un
der the law which permits munici
palities to condemn land adjoining
townsites for the use of the people
residing within the towns.
These lands are to be paid for In
state bonds and the price is fixed ar
bitrarily by the state agrarian com
mittee. Mexican attorneys here say.
. General Manager Hayes was notifi
ed that Governor Ortii of Chihuahua
bad approved the condemnation pro
ceedings and the matter had been re

ONE DRY MONTH G ONE! HOW DID
PROHIBITION INTHEU.S.WORK?
BY RICHARD SPILLANE
"Noted Economist and Daily Review
Staff Writer on Economic, Busi
ness, Financial Subjects
Three reactions from prohibition,
two favorable, one unfavorably are
reported officially after one niontn
or nationwide "dryness." i --
The Emergency Fleet Corporation
is authority for the statement that, in
the New England district it has been
more easier to book seamen einefc'the
dry law went into effect than before.
In 14 cities of more than 100,000
population the returns show an ex
traordinary decline in -hospital, case
since June 30.
On the other hand there is a notice
able increase reported in the demand
for. narcotics and 6timulant9 that
promise some satisfaction to persons
who have been habitual users of al
cohol. ". Economically -the result of prohibi
tion in regard to sailors is important
but there are persons who might
judse the New England evidence en
tirely different from the way it im
presses you. The general idea is that
the sailor, whose habit it has been to
go on a spree after a voyage and not
ship again until he was penniless, has
Kon cai-ori frnm this pmss follv. AlSO
that the troublesome Question of get-'
tinir Bailors for American ships is sim
plified somewhat by this new develop-1
ment.
Another person might argue, and
usually does, that the thirsty -sailor is
rushing to sea In a mad desire, to get
away from this arid and . .benighted
country and hop ashore in, some Joy
ous land where he can be riototos and
rummy so long as his money holds
out. , .. i
A thirst for knowledge led ;to the
discovery of a continent. j
A thirst for adventure has lied to
many things. - j
A thirst for booze has yet to show
its effects and theyrmay be ; Queer
when it is appreciated that never
until now has a great nation j really
gone in the water wagon a lage mi
nority protest ingly if. not defiantly op
posing it. i
The showing of prohibition's effect
on hospital cases is encouraging but
. not surprising. It is. but in fceeping
with the very. great .decline n the
number of arrests reported byr the po
lice in the large cities.
Most of the emergency cades in
hospitals have had a relation to
liquor. The ambulance was- kept busy
mostly bringing in gentlemen battered
or cut up or Wounded in some way in
saloon row or from over-indulgence in
liquor. The. dispensary, too, has had
a large patronage from persons in a
haH wnv frnm nvpmisp nf alrrthol.
The ambulance gong is.lieard less
in city streets since July 1. Hospital
officials say if "business" does not
pick up they do not know what they
will do. Meanwhile the police con
tinue to report a small number of ar
rests night after night and many cells
vacant.
But the narcotic evil sticks its ugly
head high. The registration of ad
dicts -shows how urgent is the correc
tion of this vile habit. Efforts .are
under way to create large medical
forces to specialize in this one-field
and to have hospitals devoted ;to the
victims, of this' degrading vice, j

To Meet Frank Laughrey of
PhiladelDhia. Who Staved 20
Rounds With Late Les Darcy
A real treat for the inereasine num
ber of boxing fans ill the Warren dis
trict has been arranged for August zz.
The Warren District Athletic club an
nounced vesterdav that Russell Cham
bers of Douglas and Frank Laughrey
of Philadelphia had signed up for a
match on that day. This should be
one of the warmest arguments which
the local fight enthusiasts have yet
seen in the squared circle and is ex
' Dieted to brine out a record rrnwrl.
Those who saw CHambers, the husky
First cavalryman, in his battle with
Kid ralmer, Nineteenth infantry, at
Douglas Thursday night, will not miss
the opportunity to see this willing
fighter in action. Palmer and Cham
bers stf-nned ten hot rounds to a draw
aud put up a battle that had the crowd
on its feet hair the time.;
The two men have nosted SFiO for
fit money each and will weight in at
3 o'clock in the afternoon of August
,2.2 at 145 pounds. The fight will be
staeed at the Warren hall srnnnds
""and the first preliminary will start at
S o clock p? m.
Laughrey is a fighter of inter
national class. havine lasted 20
rounds with Georges Carpentier, the
rTench champion, in a match at Paris.
In 1914 in Australia he went 20 rounds
with- the late Les Darcy and is the
only American fighter who ever lasted
tins long with the Australiau cham
Pion. He fousht a draw with Miriror
King, the -champion, middleweight of
Australia, although outweighed by
l&s pounds to 14C.
i nambers has become too t.-ii
known to the boxing enthusiasts of
int.- Huuuiwesi io neeu an introduction.
His draw with Palmer was one of the
best touts ever staged in this section
ana he will draw admirers here from
all towns along the border.
A splendid card of preliminary
fights also is being arranged. These
win consist of two six-round hm.fo
and two of four rounds each. Johnny

some good welterweight from Doug

Carter and Wallace
Local fight "fans" are talking over
the possibility of arranging a match
. Jtee, betwe Tommy Carter and
" al,ace. whom Carter defeated
i u raso recently. Since this vic
tory. Carter's fiehtintr ctnb- vo
a jump far beyond par and it is con-

claim the lightweight championship of
.uc unu. ior me present title holder
is said to be in the welterweight
cjasSa
It was Oto Wallace who was con
sidered the best bet In the lightweight
class, but Tommy Carter outfought
him and, gained a popular decision at
the end of the fifteenth round and by
this defeat it is little Tommy who
goes to the top instead of Watface.
Carter's ring experience is rather
short, he having really done no out
side fighting until he met and defeat
ed Al Manus in Miami some few
months ago. Since then Tommy has
risen fast and his improvement m the
fighting game has been remarkably
good. .
The first" time Carter met Chet
Neff It was considered by many
that Neff was entirely too mueo for
him. The last time they mex . was
an entirely different story. In Just four
short weeks Carter having improved
so wonderfully thaUt was considered
he really having the best of the argu
ment. But the fight was 'close and
the draw decision was entirely satis
factory, no one having any kick com
ing. If these two boys ever meet
again it is said by his friends that
Carter will bring home the bacon.
With Tommy Carter's rapid rise
from a mere preliminary fighter to
the utmost top of the lightweight
ladder, his. many friends in this dis
trict are greatly pleased and say the
little fellow should put in his claim
now for the lightweight honors and
take on all comers for the title.

Establishing a precedent which Is
Dound to attract the attention of
sportsmen throughout the country
Joe V. Prochaska. state game war
den, has announced a limitPri nnon
season for elk hunting from October
17-31, Inclusive.
The dates will be haled as a red-
letter, event in the annals of sport
dom, and incidentally , will call the
attention or me world to the fact
that Arizona is a big game country
as well as several other thinr
Arrangements for opening the elk
season were formulated at a con
rerence neia early in the summer
between state and federal ame nf
ficials and representatives of the fed
eral forest service. The full details
however, which have taken many
weens to tormulate are here an
nounced for the first time.
In Sitgreaves Forest
The elk in question are to be
hunted in the Sitsreaves national
forest in the northern portion of the
state. A certain portion of the for
est, embracing some seven town
townships, have been set aside as a
perpetual elks' sanctuarv. and no
hunting will be permitted In this spe
cial preserve.
Only 100 special permits will be
issued to hunters of elk. outside the
sanctuary. Applications for ' such
permits must be filed at the office
of the state . game warden, capitol
Duuaing, Phoenix, not later than
September 11. The license fee will
be $10 for residents of Arizona and
$20 for non-residents. Fifty . pet
cent of the amount of the fee must
accompany the application.
In the event there: are more than
100 applicants for permits, a lottery
win be held in the office of the game
warden on Friday, September 12.
The first 100 names of applicants
drawn will be entitled to permits on
payment of the balance of the fee.
io those who fail to draw, the ini
tial payment on fee will be returned
All permittees will be suDnlied
with a contour map of the Sitgreaves
national forest, ehowiner the norpi
location of the elk, he boundaries of
me sanctuary, irans,; waterways, etc.,
together with rules and regulations
governing the hunt.
One Male to Each Hunter
Each holder of a license will he
permitted to slay but, one male an
imal, the object being to reduce the
present herd of 350 to 250 by the
taking of 100 males, which are con
sidered surplus. Attention is called
to the fact, however, that there is
good deer hunting In the same sec
tion and that turkeys are abundant,
so there are good chances to bag
these consolation prizes for those
who are not successful in bringing
down one or the big boys.
The object of the coming open
season Is three fold:
1 To reduce the number of sur
plus males.
2 To confine the roaming of
ese animals to the prescribed iter
ritbry, and j
3 To provide the sportsmen of
the state and nation with a king's
sport.
The present herd which numbers
better than 350, according to esti
mates, represent the original 81 an
imals which were shipped in in 1911
and. their increase. The elk were
shipped from the Yellowstone na
tional park, through the active co-operation
of the Elks' lodge of Arizona.
Complaints of Damage
For some time past complaints
have been coming into the game
warden's office that the elk were
creating considerable damage among
mountain farms. Headed by two oi
thre males, the bands would become
quite bold. In some instances they
have destroyed crops and in other
instances they have raided hay
stacks, destroying in the aggregate
hundreds of dollars worth of feed.
It was this situation which re
sulted in a conference which led to
the decision that an open season
should be declared. Elk lodges
throughout the country will be in-

RANSFERKED IN
S450.000 DEAL
PHOENIX, Aug.. 2. One of the big
gest mining deals in copper property
put over recently in Arizona was con
summated Thursday when the final
papers were signed for the transfer of
32 of the claims belonging to the Con
solidated Holding company to the
Grand Pacific Syndicate for the sum
of $450,000.
These clainis, popularly known as
the Daggs Group, were located in 1899
by A. J. Daggs and Hugh R. Daggs.
They are located adjacent to the
Grand Pacific group already owned by
the purchasing syndicate, are about
one mile from Superior, and near the
famous Magma mine.
The purchasers were represented in
the transaction by J. C. Denton, gen
eral manager of the Grand Pacific
Copper company, and the local inter
ests by Hugh Daggs and P. H. Hayes,,
president and secretary of the hold
ings company. The purchasing . syndi
cate is made up of about 40 big New
York and Pennsylvania capitalists,
headed by C. C. Steinbrenner as presi
dent. Mr. Steinbrenner is vice-president
of the Galena Signal Oil com
pany, a 30 million dollar company, and
the Grand Pacific company is capital
ized at $2,000,000.

MEXICO CITY, Aug. 2. American
moving films are increasing in popu
larity here. Until eighteen months
ago European pictures were favored
by the public, which had acquired a
taste for French and Italian produc
tions. Of late, however. American
manufacturers have put their prod
ucts to the fore in the republic and
their films are to be found in virtually
all picture houses, in many of them
displacing altogether the European
films.
As evidence that the United States
manufacturers intend to expand their
field, here is the fact that within the
past few weeks three of the leading
companies have established offices in
Mexico City and these in turn have
started branches in Vera Cruz, Guada
lajara, San Luis Potosi and Monterey.
Representatives of these firms assert
that in a short time Mexico will re
ceive film releases almost simultane
ously with the United States. This
will be an innovation, for heretofore
managers have .been content to re
ceive films many months old and of
a poor quality.

been reported as a highly valuable
property by some of the best engi

sion. The four original claims, which
were acquired by the Daggs interests
by purchase were long worked as sil
ver mines, without regard to the cop

Monte Carlos and the Touchnot
claims were extensively worked for
silver, which was hauled to Tempe,
the town of Superior not being in ex
istence. Surface workings have indicated as
high as 17 per cent copper, $42 per ton
gold, and 33 ounces of silver in the
Monte Carlo claim, and some very
high percentages in other claims. Sev

property has been about to be sold a
large number of times to big inter

with the war prevented the consum

this outfit and other moneyed interests.

option it was about to take up when
the war broke out in Europe, it askea
for an extension, according to Mr.

B. T. Biggs, vice president of the
Sunshine Oil corporation, gives the
status of the well drilling operations
of that concern in the Pecos district,
Reeves county, as follows;
The Laura well, a deep test, con
tinues a uniform 12 1-2 inch hole near
Ing 1300 feet in depth, water causing
much Inconvenience but whtl the
drill pierces any hard stratum show-
ings of oil and gas are disclosed. This
well is about six miles from Pecos
city.
The King well, about half way be
tween the Laura and Pecos city, was
down 418 Teet with showing3 oi oil
and gas. This well, which is being
drilled with a star rig, is to get the
shallow sand struck at about 800 feet
in the Laura well. Mr. Biggs . said
that in the King he thought this sand
should be struck at possibly 600 feet.
At the Victory well in Ward county,
east of the Pecos river and two and
a half miles southward from Quito,
drilling operations are still delayed
awaiting the arrival of the engine.
Mr. Eiggs said everything else " is
ready.
The shallow test being also drilled
with a star rig near the Victory was
down about 300 feet.
Mr. Biggs said the next well his
company plans to 6tart will be on the
Lemon ranch about 30 miles north of
Pecos city and in Loving county. The
company has 20,000 acres of holdings
in that section. He thinks there is
helium In the gas from the "whist
ling" wells as they are called, which
have been sunk there for stock water.
He has sent some of the gas to chem
ists for analysis.
Dance Numbers on

a medley foxtrot, "Just Another
Good Man Gone Wrong," introducing
"Who'll Love You When I'm Gone?'
on one side of a record, and "Yelping
Hound Blues," introducing "Foot
Warmer" on the other. The Five's
special pet banjo puts lots of "pep"
into these pieces. . .
. Don't let the title of ."Tears, (of
Love") mislead you. It's a melody
one-step, introducing "I'm Glad I Can
Make You Cry" and "Pahjamah." It
is played in a lively fashion by the
Jockers' Dance Orchestra, which
plays on the other side of the record
a melody fox-trot "Yama Yama
Blues," introducing "You're Some
Pretty Doll."
"Mammy's Lullaby," . a waltz. Is
heralded as a triumph of saxophone
recording because of the full value
it gives to . that instrument, ' which
carries the ' melody for the Happy
Six.' On the other side of this record j

BAKERSFIELD, Cal., Aug. 2 Fires
that occur in the great oil storage
reservoirs on the "tank farms" of the
Kern River oil fields near here will
be smothered by a new system of fire
control-adopted by one of the largest
operating companies in . California.
Used in the new fire fighting plan
is a liquid effervescent chemical ex
tremely opposed to fire.' It is formed
by mixing two separate fluids. These,
when merged, were spread as a seeth
ing, foaming mass upon the surface
of the burning oil and exhaustive
tests are said to have shown that this
will quickly extinguish the fiercest
oil tank fire.
The big containers for the fluid are
connected with the various oil tanks
so that in' case of fire it Is only nec
essary to. turn on the main valve,
merging the fluida and the valve lead
ing to the particular tank involved.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars
have been lost. in fires in oil storage
reservoirs. The ."tank farms" are
comprised -of idle-land on which are
located scores- of coOcrete reservoirs,
each with a capacity of 5,000 barrels
or more of oil. Tire petroleum when
ignited in one tank" frequently will
boil over and small rivers of flame
set on fire oil in' nearby reservoirs
The "farms" have been the scenes' of
many costly and spectacular fires.

Summer visitors, almost tonic in
their effect on the somewhat lackadai
sical spirCi of milady who eschewed
for a time the party and luncheon,
seem to provide the necessary inspira
tion for many smart affairs. In spite
of the persistence of the warm days,
the informal entertainment has taken
on new life and the past week has
been markvd by a more lively pro
gram than many of those which have
gone before.

Treat in Store
A goodly number of names of sub
scribers for season tickets for the

lovers of the district. ' Sponsored by
the Musical Events Club of the War
ren District some of the best artists

opportunity which will be well worth
while.

RELUCTANT BEARER OF
SAD NEWS IS AIKEN .
Our old friend H. W. Aiken, recent
ly of Bisbee but now of Baltimore,
Md.. returned to the district Thurs
day after an absence of eight months.
He is here on important business ior
the Canion Air Brake Company for
which he is secretary and treasurer.
He expects to return to Baltimore
about August 12th. Henry states that
he intends making Baltimore his fu
ture home, but wishes to say, now
ever, that he is-still single to his
many lady friends in Bisbee. He is,
as always, an active member of the
Y. M. C. A., although in Baltimore all
of his time is spent at the Y. W. C.
A. "Personally," says Henry, "I don't
like Baltimore would rather live in
Bisbee, but the attraction is too great
in Baltimore." All we have been able
to learn is that she is a school teach
er. This will be a great blow to many
young ladies of Bisbee, but the sad
news has been expected for some
time.

many thrilling experiences he witness
ed was just off the coast of Ireland
when they sited the aiming of a sub
marine at the U. S. S. Chicago, then
loaded with ammunition. "The torpedo
missed the ship within 20 feet," says
'Billy,' and it is needless to describe
the effect it had upon all who wit
nessed." MEN'S DOUBLES IN Y -TOURNEY

The Seventh Day Adventlsts pro

from people in all parts of the city,
and one reason of it Is that the sub

lantern slides. Tho place is Eagles'

Main street, Bisbee.
That the fifty girls who took part
during the summer's Y. W. C. A. en
campment in Miller's canyon had a
good time is shown by the following
account of the outing written by one
of them:
The whistle blew at seven thirty
and the day started! With some it
started with a smile, while others ap
peared sleepy, due to a cookie feed
during the night, but before long,
thanks to the originator of calisthen
ics, everyone was singing, as music
during the "Arms upward and down
ward stretch" helped a great deal
toward cheerfulness.
Then breakfast, followed by the
various camp duties. Each week a
detailed program was made out and
posted so every girl knew her duties
several days ahead. We had water-

carriers, wood-gatherers, table-set,ters,
dish-washers, kitchen girls and order
lies. It. was interesting .to watch the
girls at their work. One child was
detailed to peel potatoes, and come to
find out, at the age of 13 she had
never done this fundamental house
hold duty before. Wood gathering
was a much disliked task and slack
ers were always found in this de
partment, but no wood meant no
food, and as eating was a feature,
the difficulty was easily overcome.
Two and one half hourB of school
followed. .A teacher was furnished by
the Board 'Of Education and the girls
did very good work. The teachers
were not only faithful in their duties
but were an asset to camp life and
those who went out were much be
loved by the children.
After a noon dinner it was either
a hike of three miles to the post box
for a letter, a package from mother
or a newspaper. Sometimes it was a
hike in the hills followed by a swim
in the mountain stream. This per
formance was most interesting, as
many a tear was shed and many a
friendship lost due to ducking and
reckless water play.
At five thirty we had Retreat, The
girl who stood highest in her studies
for the day took down the flag and
held it while the whole camp stood

at attention, saluted and sang the
"Star Spangled Banner."
In the evenings either an original
play was given, or else Cinderella, or
the Ruggles preparation scene from
the ' Bird s Christmas Carol was
dramatized. - This was generally
screamingly funny. It was interest
ing to notice the originality used, not
only in costumes and make up, but In
the clever repartee and interpretation
of characters. . Other evenings were
spent around the open fire in story
telling, singing and general good fun.
There was a great deal of talent and
each girl did her share. t
Every night before retiring there
was another fifteen minutes of drill. '
Before this, each girl ran for her
hair brush, placed it on the ground
before her and after drill we all
brushed our hair fifty times. Some
times we counted in French, often in
Spanish and again in English. This
was a rather new experience, but the '
girls liked it and may have continued
doing it since they returned home.
Wednesday was an all day hike,
either to Ramsey canyon, the Reef, or
Miller's peak. We started early in
the morning, returning about five, in
time for a plunge before supper. The
girls were excellent walkers. Few
ever remained at home.
Every Friday was field day. About
three o'clock there was . baseball
game, peanut races, ', three-legged
races, basket ball games and string
eating contests.
The Girl Reserve program was car
ried out to some extent and many
girls received honors for, writing
stories about their day at Ramsey,
the Shelight Quarry thrills and camp
experiences; others for making Jelly
from the manzanita berries they
gathered and brought home.
During the four weeks of camp
there were sixty-five girls who spend
a week in the fresh air of the Hua
chuca, mountains. It . was ' a very
happy camp and everything "aa done
to give these girls a happy time.

BY REVIEW
WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW
NEW YORK, Aug. 2. The stock
market this week was perceptibly af
fected by a sharp flurry in call loans,
further weakness of foreign exchanges
especially the Pails rate, and the nation-wide
crusade against the high liv
ing cost.
Speculative issues under pool su
pervision suffered only moderately in
tho wifle fluctuations, but representa
tive shares, noticeably rails, were ir
regular when not distinctly unsettled.
Th situation respecting transpor
tations is likely to become more acute
in view of the latest data submitted
by the railroad administration, indi
cating a deficit under federal control
during the first half of th calendar
year of almost $250,000,0000 it Is the
opinion of leading commercial expert s
that foreign trade prospects continue
to be threatened seriously by the un
explicable delay in stabilizing ex
change. Unless remedial measures
are speedily applied, it is likely, they
declare, that heavy selling of foreign-
sue, with consequent impairment of
values.
The Morgan offering of French treas
ury bills along lines similar to that

It is understood a Belgian eredit is
well toward completion; and Interna

report that negotiations as yet tenta
tive, are under way for the new loan

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Aug. 2. Unpopularity of
high prices lead to heavy Belling and
to unsual lack of support today in the
corn market. The close was nervous,
1M: to 4c net lower, with September
$1.85 to $1.85.8 and December $1.54
to $1.554. Oats finished lc to 23ic
down, and provisions varied from 70c
decline to a rise of 25c.
Attention of corntraders focussed
throughout the day almost exclusively
on developments in the movement to
reduce the cost of food and of other
prime necessities. Only a few con
cerns had the hardihood td recom;
mend buying in the face of widespread
agitation for lower prices, and but
very few moments of actual trading
at the outset was required to demon
strate the error of opinions that the
corn market had already fallen
enough. Then anxiety to unload hold
ings plunged values downward in a
hurry. The September delivery made
an almost vertical decent of nearly 9
cents. Transactions, though, were few
in that month. Week-end covering by
shorts tended to ' steady other more
active deliveries before setbacks be
came abnormal.
Oats fell in sympathy with the
weakness of corn. Liquidation of Sen
ternber holdings of oats was on a
large scale.
For the mo9t part, provisions went
down grade with hogs and corn. Of
ferings, however, were not urgent.
GOLD STOCKS DECREASE
WASHINGTON, Aug. 2. Gold
stocks in federal reserve banks con
tinued to decline .during the week

mately $20,000,000.

condition of clearing house banks and

COPPER HOLDING
mm 4 CIS
Measure Before Congress to Continue;
Exemption of Assessment Mine Work
FOR SEPTEMBER
The copper market appears to have
settled for a time at least around the
24c per pound quotation for Septem
ber deliveries, and although business
during the past week has been small
er than heretofore. It is said some
good orders came to the larger deal
ers, even at the highest prices quoted.
There have been numerous efforts
during the past week on -the part of
consumers to have contracts for last
ouarter delivery taken by the sellers.
and although there have been some j
reports that transactions have Deen
closed at 25c and better, no confirma
tion is obtainable and they are not
generally credited in well-informed
quarters.
Sentiment in the trade is excellent
and this applies to producers as well
as consumers. The attitude of both
sides apparently indicates that higher
prices are coming or at. least that
such a belief prevails.
Four months ago the copper market
was In the doldrums. Sales were few
and far between at 14 cents a pound.
While a big curtailment policy was
in effect at the copper properties,
talk was heard of the steadily increas
ing surplus, then placed at between
1,300,000,000 and 1,400,000,000 pounds.
It was about that time that Calumet
& Hecla decided to pass its dividend,
while Kennecott reduced its rate and
Phelps Dodge lopped off its extra.
That conditions in the copper metal
market have rapidly improved since
then is 'seen in the present asking
price of 24 cents a pound for future
copper by the leading agencies, with
spot quoted at 23 V4 to 23 cents a
pound.
After the middle of March there
was a slight improvement in the price,
with sales made by the close of the
month at 15 cents. The price dur
ing the greater part of April ruled
close to 15 cents. On the 17th of
that month the first break In the
ranks of the large copper selling
agencies occurred with sales at 15
cents. Sales at that price were very
infrequent During the early part of
May there was no change, but on the
12th of that month the price was
marked, up to 15 cents, following by
other advances until the close of that
month found the price at 16 cents.
The month of June witnessed another
upward movement to prices: from
16 to 18 cents. On July 1 the
price was 19 cents. On the 10th it
was 20 cents; on the 15th 21 cents;
on the 17th 22 cents, while the 23
cent level was established on the 21st.
Congressman Carl Hayden has an
swered the protests of Bisbee mining
men against doing assessment work
this year by introducing a bill to
exempt the owners of mining claims
from doing assessment work on five
claims this year. The bill ha Just
been reported to the house, according
to a letter received yesterday from
Congressman Hayden by Postmaster
Lee R. Bailey.
"Whether we will be able to pass
the bill remains to be seen," the con
gressman says, "because there is con
siderable opposition. We shall do
our best, however."
During the time the United States
was in . the war, claim owners were
exempted from doing assessment
i prospector or to those communities
that these men be required to quit
their employment long enough to go
out into the hills to make the assess
ment work this year especially in
light of the fact that gold has not ad
vanced In value as have other com
modities. "In many Instances miners ;have
done three or four years' assessment
work on claims without having found
mineral in paying quantities to guar
antee them in leaving Other employ
ment and applying themselves, en
tirely to their mines, and to neglect
making their assessment work would
lose to them all the labor they had
put into it heretofore, by reason of
Borne other person, more fortunate
armistice It again became necessary.
Recently a protest was sent to Con
gressman Hayden irom Bi6bee asking
that the exemption be continued this
year as conditions had not been re
stored to a normal, peace-time basis.
The bill to exempt five, claims is the
result. The measure on being sent
to the house was accompanied by a
report from the committee on mines
and mining which says in part:
"There is no doubt -that because
of the war those who went Into the
service' of the country have not yet
all returned to the communities that
they left, and in addition to this a
large number of persons answered
the call for employment -In ship
building, ammunition works, and oth
er industries that required help - to
'supply the war's needs.
"Large numbers of these men have
not yet returned to their homes, as
they are still following the pursuits
in industry that they took up then.
"The high cost of powder, steel,
and other requirements in mining
work almost precludes the possibil
ity of men doing their development
work. Labor in the mining states by
reasons heretofore .stated Is scarce,
the men that have claims are, as a
rule, employed at going mines or on
the farms and in' the construction de
partments of industries located near
their home, and all the man power
that possibly can be secured for these
operations is necessary in the build
ing or rebuilding of houses and the
harvesting of crops.
"Taking them away from these in
dustries at the present time would
lose to the supplying energy of the
states, it is estimated, several mil
lion dollars, and it is not fair to the
ISIlScflNG
work but . with the signing of thelthan they in the matter of finances
taking up- the claim.
"The committee therefore decided
to recommend that the best; public
interests were served by suspending
assessment work- up to the number
of five Claims during the present
year." ' ''"

New Cornelia is fast becoming the
prominent copper .on the local board
and if present indications of the ope
rations of the company are any cri
terion the issue should sell at much
higher prices, sas the Boston Finan
cial News.
The mine production 3,440,000
pounds of copper in June, making tne
total output for the 'first six months
19,960,000 pounds..
The June output was only 68 per
cent of its February production of
over 5,000,000 pounds! .New Cornelia,
being an "open pit," -mine, and conse
quently requiring less labor to operate
than deep shaft mines, is in a position

rapidly, as conditions warrant. As its
output increases, costs will have a
tendency to decrease. .
The construction of an experimental
flotation plant for the treatment of its
sulphide ores has' recently been start
ed and it is expected to be completed
in September. .- This plant is being 'each

erected mainly for these ores, of
which the company has definitely
blocked out over 40,000,000 tons. The
' latter figure by no' meaas measures
the extent of its sulphides, however,
as practically all of its drill holes
were stopped In good commercial ore.
It is planned eventually to treat 10,
000 tons of these sulphides daily, but
within three years a daily output of J
aOOO tons should be realized. .'
This, together1 .wit hits carbonates
which are now being treated at the
$5,000,000 leaching plant; should
.make a daily output of at least 10,000
tons and an annual production of con
siderably over 100,000,000 pounds of
copper.. These figures are not con
sidered high. On the contrary,, they
appear very conservative, la view of
the favorable conditions existing at
the mine. . ' , ' '

It is not uncommon to find miners
of the Copper Queen figuring on' the
amount of lime, iron, silica, etc., nec
essary to smelt the ore in the place
where they happen to be working.
This is a result of the practical min
ing course which Is being given to all
workmen who desire to better themselves.
There are literally mountains of tin
cans at Ajo, which will, be placed in
copper water and the iron replaced by
copper, giving an additional extrac
tion of copper that might easily spell
the difference between profit and
loss.
For "something doing all the lime,"
Morencl is one of the most active
places in the state. Individual and
community" initiative have shown the
people that it is not necessary to
bring in attractions to keep "them
busy, but that they can do it themselves.
The new miners' hotel built by the
United Verde Extension Mining Co.
at Jerome would do credit, for beavty
and equipment, to a city ten times
the size of Jerome.
While Tyrone, New Mexico, is often
regarded as a clpse company town,
there is competition in practically all

Rattlesnake Dance
of Hopis August 17
.Unique and entirely unlike any
Other Indian rite, the Hop! snake
dance given annually on a reservation
in northern Arizona is attracting hun
dreds of tourists from all over the
state as well as from various parts or
the United States. The religioua
ceremonies of which the famous
dance with live rattlesnakes is the
culmination, extends over a yeriod of
nine days and is the annual Hopl cus
tom in the dry season of the year, of
praying for rain. They believe that
the snakes, released, after their par
ticipation in the dance, carry the
message of supplication into the un
derground regions. '
These ceremonies commence Au,;.

are situated on a small reservation.

J. O. Fife, of the Hill Top mine, ac
companied by L. B. VickRoy. who
has been' at the property in the Chiri
cahua mountains for several days,
was in the city this week. Mesrss.
Fife and VickRoy have been together
interested in mining operations for a
good many years, and though the lat
ter has not been actively connected
with the development of the Hill Top
property, he. owns some stock in the
company-' Eefore the mining industry
was Interfered with in Sonora by the
revolution in Mexico these gentlemen
had developed, successfully, a gold
and silver property in the Tabotacha-
chi district fifty miles south of Doug
las and made important shipments
from it.
At the time they temporarily aban
doned the property the development
had proven to their satisfaction that
it was a good one and plans had been
made for important water develop
ment to supply the needs of their
property, as well as others in the dis
trict. Mr. VickRoy said that they
had by no means abandoned their
Mexico properties and hoped to be
back there when conditions .were
substantially safe again. Mr. VickRoy
says that he .is pleased to ; observe
that Sonora has been seemingly free
from disturbance during the past
year, except for the trouble with the
Yaquis in the southern portion
Mr. VickRoy, when speaking of the
Hill Top mine, 'waxed enthusiastic
and, made the declaration that he re
garded it as one which will prove to
be in the lass of the best silver
nmnertiea ever developed , in - the
west. About the time this property
was secured by Mr. Fife, VickRoy said
ho nent several weeks making a
rin . lamination of the surface.
where there is a vein more than two i
hundred, feet wide cutting across the
top of the mountain. On the surface
he found many ore croppings in a
day's Journey over it. These ore
croppings have now been cut by a
series of tunnels and in the upper
tunnel, cut entirely through the top
of the mountain, fifteen ore bodies
were cut, showing that the surface
outcroppings were of cone shape and
when cut by the tunnel were of vary
ing widths, some of them sixty feet.
These ore bodies have again been
cut in the second tunnel and some
at a depth of as much as fourteen
hundred feet. Still another and lower
tunnel is now being bored through the
mountain. '
Mr. VickRoy said that he regarded
the development plan on the Hill Top
as the best to be found in the coun
try, pointing to the , fact that, the
water is all carried out through the
tunnels and to the further fact that
nil nf the ore will.be handled througn
new found privileges and usurping ; lhe tunnti8 and never will a pouna
man's ancient prerogatives in more have to DO raiScd. but it will go by
ways than one. A New York man gravity into the ore bins and into
complains that his wife has been los- tne future reduction works which is

BUKD'AY, AUGUST 3, 1919.
Graphic Story of How Typhoid Was
Eradicated From the Warren District
During Fifteen Year Medical Battle
How medical science bas won a
mastery over typhoid fever is graph:
ically shown In a compact but . Illum
inating table tracing the practical
elimination -of the- malady from the
Warren district In fifteen years and
compiled by Dr. C. II. Hunt of the
Copper Queen hospital. This table
shows that in 1904 there were handled
at the hospital from Blabee 94 cases,
resulting in five deaths, and from
Lowell three cases with one death.
In that year the Warren district
had not been equipped with a water
or sewerage system and no method
had been adopted for the disposal of
garbage. Late in that year, however,
a garbage system was started and in
1905 the Bisbee-Naco water system
was developed. Warren was, not then
included in the water company, which
covered only Bis bee and Lowell, The
disease, that' year decreased to 81
cases, with two deaths,, from Bisbee,
and five cases with no. deaths from
Lowell. " .
The year 1908 saw sewer connec
tions established in Bisbee with the
result that the hospital hanaled 18
cases, no deaths, from Bisbei, and
three cases, no deaths, irom owelL
The past two years, 1918 and 1917,
show a clean record, so far as the
hospital is concerned, no eases having
been received and no. deaths having
occurred. -
Partial figures for Warren and
Bakerville show one case in 1906, two
cases and one death in- 1907 and one
case in 1908. Dr. Hunt's figures
cover only the Copper Queen hospital
and do not Include what few cases
may have been treated privately at
home, but they show that under
proper living conditions and sanitary
conditions, typhoid has no chance.

' Dr. R. B. Durfee, the" city and
county bacteriologist, regards the
fight made against yphoid in the
Warren district as trulv rnmnrtsLhla
and gives-the chief credit to the splen
did water supply and. the fairly good
sewerage system. : . '
"In these days a community, can1
purchase nractical immunity from tv-
phold,", said Dr. "Durfee. "It. Is largely
a matter of dollars and cents. It has
been found positively that typhoid 13
carried from the excrement nf rm
person to' the mouth of another. This
may be done 'in various ways, but the
water supply and milk are the most
common. carriers.. v . . .
When a i community snends its
money for an adequate supply of pure
water, installs a good sewerage -sys
tem and adopts sahitarv carbaee dis
posal methods, the . most " important
phrase of the battle has been won.
t '-Ajier. inat it is largely, a prob
lem of personal hygiene and.cleanli
nesB and this must be inculcated in
the- minds of all by educational meth
ods. We must never foreet that tv-
phoid is & filth disease; that it is one
of the most dangerous diseases we
have and that any one with a case of
it should be reported, at once and all
uie precautions necessary taken to
preventits spread...
"Besides its good water supply and
sewerage system, the Warren district
is favored by nature in the war
against typhoid in many ways. In
the first place there is no community
higher up or above us .along the. wa
ter courses from which we draw our
supply. The attitude, the fact that we
are, a desert city, the healthful, -air
and the sunshine are also factors that
glvo typhoid but little 'chance of get
ting a foothold.
"We should remember that the .milk
we use is' a frequent cause of. infec
tion from typhoid. In Washington, D.
C, it Is estimated that fully. 10 per
cent of all typhoid cases are due to
impure milk. Flies also are danger
ous carriers. Dirty hands are anpther
source of infection. ..Constant watch
fulness in these matters is ose of the
prices we must pay for immunity.?

iThoj pathway of American history,

civilization, is marked with magnificent-
slab.: .memorable daUs made
clear by the sacrifices and blood of
our countrymen.
Along the green banks of the
Marne river, on the peacefurhills ot
Lorraine, under the shadows of Sed
an, near St. Mihiel, in the dismai
Valleys of the Argonne, are the leaf
covered mounds which announce to
the Old World that Americans ideals
still live.
July 18, 1918, Is Memorable Date
No date in the world's history can
ever dim the glory of July 18th, 1918.
It was then that a comparatively
small number of Americans stemmed
the German tide which was seeking
to overrun Europe, which event later
proved to ba the inspiration and
strength of Ailied victory, soon to
Tollow.
Chateau Thierry! More spectacular
than Bunker Hill, grander than Bull
I Run, and a name to be handed down
10 posterity witn tender love for
those who made it immortal.
cnateau Thierry now has a place
in American History. Rudely arous
ed by the noise of war, many of the
old French towns were awakened
from their peaceful slumber of years
to play their parts once again in the
strife of the world and to receive
fresh wounds where time had soft

"Now Chateau , Thierry has a big
place , in the heart of every French
man." While In France I visited Chateau
Thierry several times and attempted
to become familiar with the history
ot the fighting forces in that sector
but the records of the various divi
sions were not completed and it was
not till the last of April this year that
I was able to get any authentic re
port of the fighting in this sector and
this report was mostly that of the
second and third divisions who did
mrwt of the fighting there.
Three Chateau Thierry Operations.
There was no important battle
foueht in the town of Chateau Thierry
itself. The so-called battle of Chateau
Thierry was. in reality, three separ
ate and distinct operations, extend
ing over a period of three months,
during which American troops parti
cipated in many battles of varying im
portance.
The three distinct operations were
as follows:
(1) Ludendorff's drive towards
Paris, which was stopped June .
1st, 1918, by the timely arrival of
The American second regular Ji.
vision, and the machine gun bat
talion of the third division, .on

rines. This division contained all
the marine regiments that were ever
in battle., Every time the second di
vision got into -a ight, newspapers
quue naturally mentioned the ma-i
rines, because they were not permit
ted to state definitely the official
designation of a division or any of
its units without violating the very
strict censorship regulations.
It was, of course, not the fault of
the marines that most newspapers
and magazines consequently came
out in great headlines crediting the
marines with every success of the
second division. The entire marine
Torces was only two sevenths of the
second division and. received a great
deal more credit than the rest of the
division and some, people have the
idea that half the divisions were
composed of marines instead of a
fraction of onei division.

curtain or peaceful security, have
sprung into the limelight of the world
again to take their place in the events
of today that were the cause of bind
ing France and America closer in
the pages of history.
naieau ihierry, where the' Ger
man armies, in their drive for Paris
first met the resistance of the Ameri
can troops, stands out prominently
among these old French towns that
have been engulfed in the thickest
ct the fight.
It is a little town on a hill and at
Its feet flows the slow, untroubled
waters of the Marne. From the gray
eionea, red. tiled outskirts on the
other side of the river one used to
cross a three, arched bridge of stone
to mount by winding paths to where
the ancient church lifts Its 16fb cen
tury belfy to the heavens.
House by house and street ' by
street the town has grown up through
the centuries around a ' snuat. deep
dungeoned chateau. Of this chateau
only two vine gates and the frag
ments of the thick set walls are left
to tell the story of many a bitter
siege.
Chateau Built By Charles Martel
The chateau was built in the year
72,0 A. D. by Charles; Martel, the
great soldier who. saved Europe for
Christianity when in 732 A. J), he
met and routed the turbaned hosts
of what were then the conquering
forces of Europe, in the battle of
Pointers. Little remins of the
chateau itself, but you can still see
the base of the tower " which was
once a famous prison.
When in the' early days of June,
1918. the Americans fought, hand to
hand In the narrow streets of Chat

guns stirred ancient echoes In the
crumbling ruins of the castle, history
was but repeating Itself. The river

COMPELLED HUN RECOGNITION
OF U. S.
The success of the American troops
in the Chateau Thierry salient not
only demonstrated the fighting .'.bil
ity of the American soldiers to the
French authorities but compelled the
German high command to recognize
the American troops as a deciding
factor in the. war.,
Next to Chateau Thierry Itself, Sois
sons is probably the most noted city
in this salient, as considerable fight
ing was done there by American
troops.

objective, but they had considerable
ground to their credit. -

the gallant French and British tVoops
that were used to stop the drive to

to the line along the Chemin des 1
Dames between Sojssons and Rheims
where an attack Was probable.
Then in May the First American
division was holding the line at
Cantigny, and the Second division was
relieved from its position at Verdun
and St. Mihiel and ordered to Beau

First division which had demonstrated
its qualities at Cantigny.
Ludendorff Takes Soissons

On March '27, out of an almost eleae

broke the line, took, Soissons, and
started for Parish France again wit

exodus of people from Paris,. . plans
were hurried for its defense ' and
plans were even made for transferring
the seat of the government to a more
southern point.
..Wave after wave of Germans pour-

and Rheims, capturing vast stores of

millions ofdollars worth of private
property. Cities, towns and private

condition jn this salient when the

U. S. Capture of Vaux Electrical;'
The town of Vaux. about five miles
from Chateau Thierry, gave a dem
onstration of the ability of the Ameri

proceeded by a terrific bon.bardnept
that literally pulverized the little
stone village. It was a brilliant
achievement; lasting about 15 minutes,
carried out with all the dash and
vigor that marked subsequent Ameri

America, was electrical and laine at

one day I learned that It was here
that the American artillery gave a
demonstration of its ability. From a
French stonemason who had escaped
from the town the Americans learned
where every cellar and tunnel In the
village was located. These places
were all bombarded, and when the 9th
and 23rd regiments of the Second

found these shelters had been de

f for having made It.
ii According to a news Item, a minister of a little tmurch
J in northern New York, traded automobiles four times in a
65-mile journey with farmers along the road from Natural Bridge
to Three Mile Bay. ' ' '
As he returned with a better car and 55 more dollars in his
pocket than when he started Just a dollar a mile. The congrega
tion appointed a committee to go over the ground and in the belief
that their pastor was too shrewed to be honest.
They found that each of the other parties to the transactions
were perfectly satisfied with their bargains, that each had received
just the kind of car he wanted- for his purposes and that most of the
trades had been proposed by the farmers to the preacher.
Shrewdness is not necessarily dishonesty.
In transactions between man and man it is in knowing our wants
and what we are giving and getting.
Shrewdness is not Just ability to take unfair advantage of the
other fellow.
All transactions can and will one day be mutually profitable.
Honesty in dealing is in knowing our rights, but never denying
to another his rights.
j GOD DOESN'T ASK US TO PUZZLE OUR WAY
PERHAPS it's a bit fanciful, but it's at least interesting to
study the meaning of the ten names given in the fifth chapfei
of Genesis from Adam' to Noah.
The names are those which stand out during what is
known as the ante-deluvian period in iBble 'history that is. the
period before the flood.
It is said by some Cible students that the definition of these ten
names outline the complete history of mankind from the creation of
man to his final redemption.
No doubt those who have given us these definitions have stretched
a word here and there to make the span of life perfect, but here are
the names and the definitions:
First, the names: 1, Adam. 2 Seth. 3 Enos. 4, Cainan. 5, Ma
halaleel. 6. Jared. 7, Enoch. 8, Methuselah. 9; Lamech. 10, Noah.
Now the meaning of the names: 1, man in God's image. 2, sub
stituted. 3, man in misery. 4, lamenting. 5 the blessed God. 6,
will come down. 7, teaching. 8, hi3 death will bring. 9, to the
weary. 10, rest.
God hasn't put His most precious truths into the form of puzzles,
which only the imaginative can "understand." He has made the
way of life so plain that the simplest of us can understand the signs
that point the way.

JUST LIKE SOME HUMAN BEINGS.
H. T. WILLIAMSON of Williamson, W. Va.. tells about a
pigeon that hatched out a hen's egg and then began trying to
teach the chicks how to fly. Mamma Pigeoon had- taught baby
pigeons to fly and thought she could succeed as well with this
new kind of a baby.
Naturally you will agree with us that the mother pigeon dis
played little sense in wasting flying lessons on a chick, whose wings
are not built to do bird-like stunts. And you probably agree with us
that a lot of human fathers and mothers are much like this mother
pigeon. Eternally are they trying to make their eons and daughters
be something other than that for which they are best fitted by
nature.
They take a boy who might become a second Edison and make
of him a third-rate doctor or preacher. Or the lad who has all the
makings of a. farmer they tie behind the counter of some store.' The
daughter who would make a fine housewife and mother is crammed
full of college degrees and embarked upon a "career."
It's a wise pigeon 'who recognizes the difference between a bird
and a chicken.
And it is a wiser parent who realizes that his child should be
consulted in the mapping out of the latUr's destiny.
If a fellow knew the approximate age of the human race, he could
tell the approximate date of the first race riot.
Evidence that our prison officers tised blackjacks on doughboy

Earl Curzon thinks the kaiser will not be tried in London, and
about half the world is beginning to think that he won't be tried

English judges object to trying the kaiser "by a law they do

NOGALES, Ariz., Aug. 2. The No
gales Oasis says:
From about 1894 to his retirement
in 1907 the history of the tremendous
development of Northern Sonora was
practically the history of Bill Greene
the celebrated cow-man-mine-prorac-ter
of Cananea fame.
Within an incredibly short time,
from a hamlel of a few dozen people
he made Cananea a town of some 20,
000 people, and created one of the
biggest copper mines in the world,
representing a fixed investment of
around twenty million dollars of out
side capital, which has caused since
an annual outporing of metal the
equivalent of $5,000,000 to $10,000,000
of brand new wealth year in and
year out. Incidentally Mr. Greene be
came Col. W. C. Greene, an honored
member of the romantic "nouveaux

and the Interview ended.
Greene rustled the balance of the
money either from his friends, or oth
erwise; and before tle time appointed
presented himself at Logan's office.
The latter was ready to act. A West
Virginia corporation was organized
for $6,000,000; and the next Sunday
the papers were full of Cananea, let
ters and prospectuses were mailed by
tens of thousands to a selected list
of known speculative mining stock
buyers, from the dignified banker to
the village druggist and pious clergy
man. At first Greene was somewhat scep
tical about the efficiency of soliciting
by mail. Logan curtly responded: "It

tion comes to the corporation commis
sion in the form of a telegram from
C. O. Whitemore, of Los Angeles, gen
eral manager of the Swansea Lease
company, who, states that the corn-

PAY OF ENLISTED MEN
WILL NOT BE REDUCED.
DOUGLAS, Aug. 2 The war de
partment at Washington had made
an official announcement that sets
at rest rumors circulated to the ei
feet that the pay of enlisted men
would soon revert to a pre-war basis,
that is, $15 and $18 a month. The
present pay is $30 a month for a
private and $33 for a private first
class.
A telegram was received this morn
ing at headquarters of the Arizona
military district from headquarters of
the southern department transmitting
the following official notice from the
war department:
"Newspaper reports that the pay of
enlisted men will revert after the
present emergency to a pre-war scale
are incorrect. The appropriation bill
for the fiscal year 1920 provided that
provisions of the act approved May
18, 1917, insofar as it increases the
pay of enlisted men of the army, are
continued in force and in effect from
and after the date of approval of this
nnnronriation act of 1920. You will
give wide publicity to these facts."
large scale. The Swansea mine is
owned by Senator Clark and associates.
The management is; now seeking
to secure the reopening of the line,
which will set thing3 humming with
activity again following a long period
of forced idleness. Personal diffen
ence appear to have arisen between
the management of the mine and the
road, however, and it is these that
Whitemore is seeking to have ironed
out
He says that when the railroad
closed down that it was with the un
derstanding that the management
would reopen the line as soon as min
ing operations were reopened. He
is now ready to operate, he says, but
despite the fact that his company has
guaranteed the road against loss, the
management refuses to live up to its
end of the understanding.
Realizing the importance of the
situation the commission has ordered
both sides to be present at a hearing
which has been set for next Monday,
with the probability that the railroad
in question will be placed in operation.
The difference between an honest man and a pollciciao is that
one is an honest man.
HOW NAVAJO OFFICIALS
PLANNED TO GET MORE PAY
PHOENIX, Aug. 2. How the of
ficlals of Navajo county planned to
increase their salaries .through the
simple expedient of raising assess
ment valuations by $1,000,000, there
by jumping from third to second dab's,
is the interesting story . which has
come out of the tax commission's of
fice in connection with the announce
ment of a hearing in August.
r The land department of the Santa
Fe and the Santa Fe Land and Im
provement company, which operates
the water syhtem supplying Winslow
are the complainants. They charge the
board of supervisors with doubling
the no;i-opcrative property values of
the water plant for the last five years,
and adding the increase in on the tax
rolls. It is also alleged that the
county increased the valuation of
grazing land from $1 to $1.25 per
acre, and that the latter figure is ex
cessive. , '
The real motives . behind the in
crease were brought out during the
recent tax conference at Grand Can
yon, according to a tax commissioner
who 6tated that during the .course of
discussion on the 'ibpic a certain
county official admitted that county
classification advancement had some
thing to do with the action taken by
th" supervisors.
Both Bides will be given opportunity
to be beard before the commission in
tne hoariug set for August o. .

of gifts to Mr. and Mrs. Cates and
speeches of appreciation of the work
Mr. Cates had done while here and
more dancing.
During the year he has been here
as general manager of the company,
Mr. Cates has proven himself a man
of exceptional ability as is proved by
his advancement. He has made many
warm friends among the mining men
of the Btate and especially among the
employees of the Ray Consolidated
Needless to say these regret to see
Mr. Cates leave, yet rejoice at his
promotion, and anticipate very pleas

This training has recently 'started at
the various -army camps and the in
terest displayed ,bv men in uniform
is gratifying. -"More than 600 men
have signed up in one or more of the
bevel al blanches of studies that are
offered. More men are on the rolls
now than we can handle to good ad
vantage on account of our limited
facilities. Of course, as soon as the
government is assured of the success
of the new institution, more equip

Ross L. Bush, head of the vocational
department, at Camp Stephen D. Lit
tle. Chaplain Priolean is assisting.
Courses in elementary studies are
under Chaplain Priolean and there
are large classes of reading, writing
and arithmetic. Spanish also is
taught. Courses also are offered in
typewriting and bookkeeping. There
are also" courses that will permit the
soldier to train for non-commissioned
jobs and when vacancies occur, these
men will be given preference in ad
vancement.
A soldier has opportunity to learn
horse training, motor repairing, mo

did they realize that Greene had "ar
rived with the goods."
Such was the romantic beginning of
Cananea. From that time Colonel
Greene was a hero and financier to
his old-time friends. The inside facts
of sudden elevation from a mediocre
miner-rancher' and peripatetic promo
ter to a full fledged financial mag
nate, have never been told and have
ever remained a mystery along the
border.
As .Colonel Greene and all the par
ties immediately connected with the
New York end of the romantic long
ago have been gathered to their fath
ers, it now seems appropriate for The
Oasis to publish the story as told its
editor by one whose position in the
marts of the mighty made him entire
ly familiar with every phase of the
early history of Cananea. Hereafter
follows the allaged entrails of the deal
practically verbatim:
In Greene's various peregrinations
seeking capital he had often met, both
East and West, one Walter S. Logan,
an able New York corporation lawyer,
with elaborate offices in the Wall
Street district. With his lawbusiness
Logan had branched out successfully
into real estate and mine promotion.
The glamor of Mexico's mines and
lands was just beginning to interest

LAND OWNERS SIGNING
FOR FLORENCE PROJECT.
FLORENCE. Aug. 2. The biggest
event in the history of the Florencc-
Casa Grande project, is the signing up
campaign now being conducted by
government officials. They are here
to secure the contracts of land own
ers in the project in connection with
the building of the diversion dam and
the honed for construction of the
San Carlos reservoir. The officials
are anxious to complete the signing
up as soon as possible to that they
may proceed with a great deal of de
tail work that must necessarily fol
low, before actual construction work
on the diversion dam can be started
From information gained it now
looks like all the land owners would
sign up. Both man and wife must
join in executing the contract to the
government and the land owner must
be prepared to show a waiver from
any mortgagee holding a mortgage
or lien upon his property. This is
essential. .Or if desired, copies of the
contract may be secured from Flor
ence by writing to Judge O. J. Baughn,
Florence, Arizona.
'This pvent marks the beginning of
an important era-'Jn the development
of the Florence-Casa Grande section.
It looks as if this district would now
realize some of the wonderful possi
bilities which have been so long delayed.
SOUNDS WARNING TO
LIVESTOCK OWNERS.
PHOENIX. Aug. 2. A warning
that stock should not be permitted to
feed in cantaloupe patches was sound
ed last night by Dr. H. E. Gerdes,
veterinarian, after several cases of
stricken stock had been reported. Dr.
Gerdes was emphatic fn saying that
it is practically fatal for stock to
feed on land on which cantaloupes
have recently been grown.
Several cases of dead stock have
developed recently from valley ranch
es after the stock had been turned
loose in cantaloupe patches to forage.
Dr. Gerdes explained that the dying
and fermenting cantaloupe vines ara
charged with hydrocyanic acid, one
of the most deadly poisons known.

Upon previous occasions Greene had
appealed to Logan for assistance in
certain promotions, but, after submit
ting his contracts, data and proposi
tion, Logan had smiled, courteously, at
his crude preparations and microscop
ic funds, and had outlined roughly an
informal plan which, if coupled with
a concrete proposition on a promisinc
property, with a competent report
might interest him.
In due time Greene arrived in Nw
York on his Cananea campaign. After
meeting many typical rebuffs from
metropolitan financiers he bethought
himself of Logan. An appointment
was arranged and Greene submitted

and the lawyer-promoter was interest
ed. However, he said: "Before we go

COPPER STATUS
, FELTf MM
Copper miners and. stockholders
alike are watching with keen interest
the copper market and the progress
of the price of copper, and are plac
ing great confidence in the ability of
the large operators to handle the
situation satisfactorily for them. Tho
miner is interested, for to him it
means higher wages,, while the stock
holder is interested in returns on his
capital invested. From all indications
it would seem that the Interests of
both are being amply protected.
The copper industry today is load
by four great interests. Anaconda,
the Guggenheims, Phelps Dodge and
Calumet & Hecla, and this centraliza
tion has proven the bulwark of pro
tection that has kept the mines open
and provided work for hundreds of
thousands of miners and returned sol
diers. John D. Ryan has many times
proven his ability as a copper mer
chant. If his competitors wanted
business at cut prices, they were wel
come to it, and it usually turned out
that when the up swing camo, and
consumers were bidding furiously for
copper, Mr. Ryan was the man willi
copper to sell, the little rellow having
sold out at lower prices. It wuld
not be a bad guess today that all of
the abovo lour are using this method.
So long as the controlling interests
above referred to are entrusted with
the job of getting the market on an
even keel, stockholders and miners
have little to fear. Their interests
are as stockholders and producers,
but the interests of the miners are
the same, for the sliding scale of
wages is but a method of sharing
the profits of higher prices higher
prices mean higher wages.
The placing of the copper market
in balance is a big undertaking, on
which men have "gone broke" many
times, with less than the present day
burden. Many months ma-y elapse le
fore the market is normal, but mas
ter hands are at the helm, and the
miners know it thus their confi
dence. ,

PHOENIX. Aug. 1 The Apache

bile stage properties in this state, was
sold today to Buetke Brothers of
Phoenix, present owners of the Union
stage line, for a consideratiin of
$10,000. The sale was approved by
the corporation commission, which
also approved issuance of $35,000
bonds by the Union stage line to cover
the purchase price and to provide
funds for erection of a modern stage
station here. .
A scarcity of cigarettes in England
is attributed to the growing practice
of smoking by women, as well as to

Suggest Rotations
For Arizona Crops
It is difficult to overestimate the
advantages which the climate of Ari
zona possesses over that of less fa
vored regions when the possibilities
of truck gardening in this state are
considered. In southern Arizona it is
quite possible to produce as many as
three, and sometimes four, good revenue-producing
crops on the same land
in a period of twelve months.
The following are some profitable
rotations suggested by Prof. F. J.
Crider, Horticulturist of the Agricul
tural Experiment Station of the Uni
versity of Arizona:
Lettuce, planted in th fall and off
the ground in spring in time to be
followed by cantaloupes, which, in the
latter part of July or first of Augus'..
may be succeeded by corn for silage
or cowpeas. With this combination it
itn ot difficult to obtain a profit of
two to three hundred dollars per
acre with the added advantage of be
ing able to grow a good cover crop.
Spinach, cabbage, or cauliflower, all
good money crops, may be planted in
the fall and followed by early Irish
potatoes or string beans, which, in
turn, give place to a cover crop of
cowpeas or a late crop of melons.
Other combinations may be worked
out to meet the requirements of par
ticular soils and markets, and, with
the use of shorter season crops the
land may be handled in such a way
that it Is possible to produce as many
as four crops in the same year.

ROYALTY BOOKED
FOR AMERICAN TOUR.
King of Belgium.
Queen of Belgium.
Prince of Wales.
Crown prince of Italy.
Queen of Rumania.
By Carolyn Vance Bell.
N. E. A. Washington Bureau,
1128-1134 Munsey Building,
WASHINGTON, D. C.
One short year ago and the capital
resounded to the slogan "Down with
kings."
But times nave changed!
Just now the capital is feverish and
fearful that the "right thing" will not
be done by the royalty who have signi
fied their intention of visiting us.
One king, two queens and two
crown princes have let their royal de
sires to visit the United States be
known. Already one prince and a
duke have completed a visit.
Instead fo shouting "Down with
kings" the Washington populace will
doubtless cheer itself hoarse with
"Long live the king and queen," when
King Albert and Queen Elizabeth of
Belgium make their appearance here
in the fall.
Far from turning up their noses at
royal titles, the debutantes of official
circles are all a flutter at the prospect
of meeting the Prince of Wales, sched
uled to be here October 1.
The crown prince of Italy, who also
proposes to visit is causing a furore,
but the same quality of heart interest
is not being excited.
Young Prince Aage of Denmark de
lighted and flattered all Washington
oy declaring the city to be a "Damn
nice place."
Even a king and queen of biblical
history have been recently represent
ed here by one of their traditional
progeny, Dedjazmatch Nado of Abys
sinia, said to be descended from a
son of Ring Solomon and the queen
of Sheba. Accepted authorities do not
mention this particular armour, but
that may have been merely overlooked
by time.
Shakespeare declares that "a king
has never dropped from the clouds."
But the Belgium commissioner of the
Red Cross, Rev. Dr. John Van
Schaick, says:
"When the king and queen of Bel
gium comes to the United States I
should not be surprised to see them
traveling by airship."
A queen who looks the part and who
will also visit the United States in
the fall is Queen Marie of Rumania.
Altogether Washington expects to
have a royal good time in entertaining
the royal visitors.
that "the less work a man does the
more work there is for others." Tho
fallacy lies in the assumption that
there is not enough work to go all
around. The fact is, work as hard
as it may, the world will be unable
for years to make good the destruc
tion of war and the loss incident to
deferring work.
SEND THEM BACK
New York Times:
It was said a few months ago that
something more than a thousand of
the Germans interned here were re
garded as dangerous; if only half
that number are included in the bill
now before congress, it is evident
that our authorities have not erred:
on the side of strictness. These per
sons ought to be sent back to Gen
many, and never allowed to land
here again. They came among us
and were received as friends, and
they have behaved as enemies.

Tex Barton Scores
As An Expert On
Lady's Toothmarks
Introducing "Tex" Barton, expert
on tooth marks!
Ladies and Gentlemen, meet Mr.
Bartqi, the only uoliceman at large,
so far as known, who has officially
and legally qualified as an authority
on the tell-tale marks sometimes left
by milady's pearly bicuspids.
"Tex" has played many parts in his
busy life as a worker, a guardian of
the peace, a minion of the law; he has
successfully filled the roles of keen
witted sleuth, avenger of the wronged,
nemesis of the evil doer, guide, coun
sellor and friend to the city's unfor
tunates. . But yesterday, in Police
Judge Hogan's court, he was called
upon the first time to qualify as a
tooth mark expert. Of course, he
made good,
It came about like this. Viola Stew

office Friday and before the afternoon
crowd knew what had happened the
two dusky damsels were putting on a
battle that would have made a Toi-,do
preliminary look slow. They were at
it hammer and tongs when Policeman
Brown interfered and took the two
combatants to the station.
Yesterday morning Viola pleaded
guilty before Judge Hogan and was
fined $10 and costs. But Myrtle in
sisted she wasn't to blame and wanted
a 'trial. Each girl acted as her own
attorney in tt.e trial that was pulled
off yesterday afternoon, Charles Long,
an eye-witness, gave a vivid word pic
ture of the scrap and then Myrtle was
called on for her version.
After raising her good right hand
and taking the oath, Myrtle averted

only 18 years old, when she met Viola
and they had words.
"Then she hauled off and nit me in
the jaw," Myrtle narrated, "and then
she hit me in the nose and then she
knocked my hat off and when I went
to pick it up she hit me again."
"What did you do?" Judge Hogan
inquired.
"I didn't do nothing, absotively,"
Myrtle vowed.
"She did too, done something,"
Viola disputated. "She tried to chew
off my hand," and offered the hand as
exhibit A.
Then it came down to a question
whether Viola's hand had been bitten
or had been hurt in some other way,
for it bore fresh wounds. Viola n
sisted Myrtle had bitten her; Myrtle
swore there was never no drop of
cannibal blood in her veins. Mrs.
Brown, matronly friend of Viola,
swore she had dressed the latter's
bitten hand. Judge Hogan examined
the marks, but could make nothing
from them.
In his dilemma Judge Hogan re
membered "Tex" Barton's versatility
and called on him to diagnose the
wounds.
"Toothmarks," said "Tex" after one
look.
'Ten dollars and costs," Judge Hp
gan ruled, just as promptly, and the
case was over.

COPPER EXPORT
IS
The export trade of this country in
refined copper, which slumped in
March, is showing a gradual recovery.
In May, 18,686,929 pounds were ex
ported, compared with 17,841,000
pounds in April and 13,088,000 pounds
in Marcn. in May, 1918, exports
amounted to 65,298,000 pounds.
Of the 18.686,000 pounds exported
In May 10,053,000 pounds were ship
ped to the United Kingdom. For the
first month in a number of years not
a pound of copper was exported to
France in May. During the war ex
ports to that country averaged close
to 27.000,000 pounds a month. Italy
took 1,368,000 pounds of our coppei
in May, while 1,456,000 pounds were
exported to Sweden.
The export trade to Sweden has
been increasing considerably of late.
During the eleven months of the
1918-1919 fiscal year ended with May,
Sweden imported 17,617,000 pounds of
copper from this country, as against
none during the corresponding period
of the 1917-1918 fiscal year ended
May 31, 1917.
The decrease in shipments to
France and the United Kingdom since
the signing of the armistice has been
very considerable. During the eleven
months ended with May, France im
ported but 96,317,000 pounds from'
this country, against 301,260,000
pounds - during the corresponding
period of the 1917-1918 years, while
exports to the United Kingdom drop
ped from 284,823,000 pounds to 177,
839,000 pounds.

UNITED
Invites the public to join hands with it in prov
ing to the world that commercial oil exists in the
sedimentary rocks of the Bowie Oil Basin, right
here in our own state, some one hundred miles
north of the Warren District. It has installed a
California Standard Drilling Rig on its property
and has drilled a 16-inch hole 300 feet deep- There
is now in transit from Los Angeles to Bowie over
the Southern Pacific Railway, a carload of casing,
consisting of 500 feet of 14-inch and 1000 feet of
12-inch casing. In addition to this, the company
now has at the drill-site 300 feet of additional cas
1 ing. That carload of casing is paid for- A tele
gram from Los Angeles, now on file with the com
pany's secretary, announces the shipment of that
carload July 31st. It will require perhaps a week
to deliver the casing at the well-site, when the
well will be cased and the drill begin to drop.
Last summer the company drilled a small test
hole near the present drill-site, reaching the
Trenton lime (dolomite) at 700 feet. In so doing
it pierced a.stratum of oil sands at about 350 feet,
testing high in physical and chemical properties.
One or two drilling shifts will drive the bit into
these sands.
The treasury stock of the company was ad
vanced to par, 50c, April the 10th, and has sold at

Considerable damage in Bisbee

Jet go at the head of Woods can

through the two towns like an
over-F.ized mill race and was fol

year. The rushing waters wash
ed out a big hole in Moon canyon,
but did its chief devastation in
Tombstone canyon and Brewery

In Tombstone canyon the well
at. the pump house was washed
out but the pumphouse itself was
left undamaged. Farther down the
canyon, the footbridge from the!
depot to the Czar change house
was washed out. Wood canyon

HONOR LEGION
FDR PROV DEHS
J
' "While the American Legion Is be
ing formed into a great democratic
body by the soldiers, sailors and ma
rines of tbe American army and navy,
the men who used to employ them
when they wer eplain citizens are ulso
organizing what is known as tbe Le
gion of Honor.
These employes couldn't go and
.Tight themselves, but they emptied
their offices, stores aud factories of
their best employes, so that the war
.might' b.e speeded up and won glor
iously. While the yonugsters were
away .these employers strained every
nerve to keep their standards of ef
ficiency with the aid of women work
ers, older men, and redoubled effort
on their own part. And now. the
young fighters are coming back, luey
are finishing the job gallantly by open
ing the doors to the old job, oiten
with increased pay, always with a
handclasp and a "Welcome Home"
that is the real thing.
; It is not always easy for business
organizations to do this. Increased
cost of operations and the rather slug
gish conditions of commerce just at
present are a serious drain on the.
books. But the Legion of Hono'
knows no compromise and whether;
the firm suffers or not, soldiers must
not, and every one who comes back
to toe "old stand" is received cor
dially. To every business house that
pledges itself to take back all Us for
mer employes who have been serving
their country, the war department is
sues an official citation, through
Col. Arthur Woods, assistant to the
secretary of war. and head of the gov
ernment's great employment service
for the benefit of dicharged men.
Between 70 and 80 per cent of re
turned men have offers of their pre
war jobs and the large majority of
American employers are qualifying
for the legion of Honor.
