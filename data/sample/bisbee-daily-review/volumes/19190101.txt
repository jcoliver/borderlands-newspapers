Many Watch Parties.
New Year's eve was featured in the
Warren district by numerous watch
parties, dances and other forms of
entertainment, which served to keep
many residents awake to welcome the
New Year. Nor was the religious side
of the passing of 1918 neglected. A

amusing program with a prayer serv

(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS, Dec. J1The declara
tion made by President Wilson m
his speech at Manchester Monday
against balance of power among
the nations is regarded in high
American quarters here as a di
rect rejoinder to the speech of
Premier Clemenceau in the cham

clared himself on the "balance of

make it his guiding thought in the
peace negotiations.
MAY BE INTENTIONAL
Whether it was intencied to b
so is not known, but the presi
dent's speech coming within 24
hours after that of the premier
has led to a contrast between the
two declarations as sharply defin
ing two opposing viewpoints on
the subject of balance of power
among the nations.
The textual copy of the premier's
speech on Sunday night now is avail
able and gives the following reference
on this subject:

Great disorder broke out in the
chamber at this point and Pierre
Prizon, a socialist deputy exclaimed:
"This is the system which has gone

Premier Clemenceau -continued, say

"This system appears to be con
demned by some very high authorities.
Nevertheless, I wiK remark that if
such a balance bad preceded the war
that if America, England, France '
and Italy had got together in declar
ing that whoever attacked one of
them must expect to see the three
others take up the common dei'ense "
The premier was interrupted here
by applause and disorder in the cham
ber, but later resumed:

people of the United States:
"I tfcsnk The Associated Press for
giving me the occasion of sending
once more to the United States a
token ot admiration.
"France is try grateful to the
American people for-t'ue great part
t'uey have taken in the struggle for

tained by the allied armies.'
"1 have several times visited the
American troops. -1 -have seen them

fore Verdun. I have observed their
splendid bearing, their courage, their
high spirits and their smiling con
tempt of danger.

towns or villages where they had their
cantonments. They were much be
loved there by the inhabitants. I
recollect for instance that in Nancy
the people were deeply touched by
the solicitude the American soldiers
showed to the children.
Thus, not only between our arm
ies, but also between American troops
and French citizens, have been most(
intimate relations and ties which will
remain indissoluble even after the ,

"Both our nations had already been
brought together by the remembrance
of your war for independence by the j

and by natural sympathies and by !

JAPANESE PLEDGED
TO PEACE POLICY
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Dec. 31. Japan will
enter the peace conference pledged to
policy of peace and the "open door"
iu the far east, in the maintenance of
which she will welcome the co-opera
tion of the allies. Baron Nobuaki Ma-
kino of the Japanese peace commis
sion declared on his arrival here to
day with fellow delegates, attaches
and secretaries on the way to France.
Insure Partnership.
His country's course in her foreign
relations, said the baron, who is a
member of the Japanese bouse of
peers and the advisory council of the
diplomatic affairs, will be such as to
insure the mott effective partnership
with the associated powers in the
work of reconstruction. Having es
tablished peace iu the orient by clear
ing Germany from her fa eastern
bases and keeping the Pacific open to
commerce, he added, Japan is fully
in accord with the allies for a just
and lasting world peace.
Accompanying Baron Makino on his
arrival on a special train, with an
official escort, provided by the state
department, were Lieut. Gen. Takeji
Nara and Vice Admiral Isamu Takes
hita, military and naval representa
tives; Eigo Fukai. director of the
bank of Japan, and Kikusaburo Fukui
and Matazo Kita, noted Japanese
financiers, together with a party of
attaches and secretaries numbering 23.
""Marquis Saionji, senior delegate,
wiil join the party in Paris, traveling
by way of the Suez canal. Baron
Chinda. ambassador to England, is
the third peace envoy of ambassadorial
rank.
Baron Makino will go to .Washing
ton to call on Viscount Eshi Ishii, the
Japanese ambassador, and with his
party will sail January 4 on the
Cunard liner Carmania, spending a
few days in London before going to
Paris.

PARIS JOURNALIST SNOWS IN KANSAS DOLLAR YEAR HEN
URGES NECESSITY BLOCKING TRAINS END WAR SERVICE
OF OPEN SESSIONS
PARIS, Dec. 31 (By the Associat
Owing to ' heavy snowstorms in
Kansas and Colorado, train schedules
; in the southwest probably will be dis
arranged for several days. The first
local advice of this condition was re
ed Press.) Etienne du Naleche, di-' ceivej at the E. P. & S. W. depot
rector of the Journal das Debats, and
vice-president of the Society of Paris
Journalists, has given the Associated
Press the following concerning the
practical application of open di
plomacy to the peace congress:
The war which is ending is a war
of the peoples; the peace will, and it
should be a peace of tae peoples.
The sessions must be public in the
sense at least that the public ought to
know on what basis they repose and
to what combinations they are at
tached. "There is no question of publish
ing reports of the sittings of the con
gress as is done in the case of legis
lative sittings, nor of divulging the
conversations between the pleni
potentiaries. But each plenipotenti
ary ought to have the right to make
public what he has communicated in
writing or verbally to the congress.
Duty to Country.
"If discretion prevents him from re
vealing what has been confided to
him by his colleagues, his duty to
ward nis country bids him enlighten
the country on the manner in which
he is carrying out his mission. Dis
cretion is a condition necessary to
every negotiation, but it saoulJ not
hind a plenipotentiary as a secret of
the comessioual binjs. .
"It U clearly subordinated to the
obvious condition that the mainte
nance of secrecy will not do injury!
to the bonor or interests of his coun
try. Otherwise plenipotentiaries
those without scruples Deing assured i
of absolute secrecy, could make most!
oifensive suggestions and propositions
without rih-k.
7As regards decisions they should
be mad public, as soon as each, is
reached. Care should be taken to
avoid placing the peoples brusquely
some day before a complete collec
tion of irrevocable decisions.
Distinction in Purposes.
"Hitherto the governments have
always taken precautions that noth
ing shall be. divulged before the def
inite closing of diplomatic confer
ences. This - has' been so because
previous conUlcts were above all con
flicts of governments. But the case
is not the same for the present con
flagration. " ,

WELCOME THE NEW YEAR
A new world is dawning with the
opening of the New Year, nineteen
hundred and nineteen. New concep
tious of humanity, of the duty of man
to man, of the obligation of nation to
nation, of religion and politics and
economy and society have been in
culcated in the people of the entire
earth, and with the newer and bigger
and brighter outlook on life is com
ing a greater, broader, more humane,
less grasping world.
One year ago nations were engaged
in war. The United States, drawn
into the net by Germany's perfidy, had
begun sending its youth beyond the
seas to the battlefields of Europe.
The New Year was somber, dark, over
cast. Today a spirit of gaiety and joy
pervades the American people. In
the great cities last night unprecedent
ed celebrations welcomed in the New
Year. Abandon marked the people's
attitude. The contrast was more than
passing.
America has learned its lessons
from the great war. Sacrifice has
been instilled into the lives of its peo
ple. They have learned that it counts,
not how a man dies so much as how
he lives; that more concern should
be shown for the life here on earth
than for the possible future life. They
have come to know what spells patri
otism and love of the flag. They
have profited through unity of pur
pose and concerted action. Employe
has learned that employer is human
and honebt, and employer has learned
that the man who works has certain
inalienable rights. . J
Greatest of the -lessons which Amer- i
ica has learned, however, is the lesson
of thrift. In the past a people of
extravagance, of hap-hazzard and
thoughtless expenditure, . Americans
have been moulded in a few brief
months into a nation of savers. Lib
erty bonds and War Savings certifi
cates have taught this lesson until
now, men and women of the United
States are saving at an estimated
rate of over three billions of dollars
each month.
The United States will profit from
all its lessons in the great war dur
ing the year to come. The new align
ment of its people, the cemented pat
riotic spirit, the greater conception of
society, economy and religion, will be
reflected in the people of the nation.
Thrift will remain to some extent a
factor of the new period.
To perpetuate this thrift, to make it
the dominant feature of this nation,
is one of the greatest works of this
year nineteen hundred and nineteen.
The tendency to become lax, is al
ready showing in many men and wo
men. Their lesson has been but par
tial; they need cultivation. Especial
effort must be exerted to bring them
to the realization that thrift comes
not only in times of stress, but al
ways. Let us then, each one of us, make
one New Year vow to perpetuate
our thrift practiced in a time of war
that it may be an even greater bless
ing in times of peace and prosperity.
For the first time in the history
of civilization no wars are being
w aged on this earth. The future holds
possibilities of the complete and last
ing peace, of a re-made world.
Happiness, prosperity, wealth,
health, the home, the state and tho
nation will increase with thrift.
ECONOMIC FRIGHTFULNESS
It is good to have surh a rleanand
informing report as that of Mr. Hoover
on Belgium as he appears in the wake
of the retreating German. An account
of the first crimes of German occupa
tion we possess in the Bryce report,
and what happened after has been
largely a scaled book save when the
cry ;f an Edith Cavell has reached
the oars of a horrified world.
What Mr. Hoover tells is only what
we should -expect. Germans who will
rape an'.! murder and maim with sys
tematic barbarity in order to bow
down a people, are Mirely not go
inn to stop with these explosive aets
of violence. The future must be taken
ran- of in the picture t.'iat Mr. Hoover
pai:.ts Thirtj-flve or forty steel fur-
naces have been deliberately destroy-;
ed in the determination to end the '
Belgium steel industry. Many of the
textile mills have been similarly
wrecked. That the coal mines were
largely saved is due to President
Wilson's promise of retribution, Mr.
Hoover declares. Only when immedi
ate retribution appeared upon the hor
izon did these precious vandals cease
their depredations.
Belgium was not only to. be scared
into slavery by unspeakable atrocities,
,but condemned to complete subjection
in the years to come through economic
inferiority. Northern France has been
similarly wrecked. The German pur
pose is written across a dozen Indus
trial provinces.
Not even the pitiful picture that Mr.
Hoover paints of these destitute and
starving peoples, kept alive through
American agencies, can make us for
get this larger problem of reparation
and rehabilitation in the years ahead.
Belgium, like France, must not only
be repaid for damage done, but the
payments exacted must be sufficient
to cover the complete restoration of
all the consequences of the campaign
of economic frlglitfulness which Ger
many has conducted. To do less
would be to let these burglars escape
with their most precious booty the
economic life and very subsistence of
their victims. New York Tribune.
N
GOVERNMENT OWNERSHIP
The success of government owner
ship would depend in part upon the
temperament of the official immedi
ately in control, upon his whims. That
is one reason why many people hesi
tate to embark upon government own
ership. There is one town- in this
country where doubtless this hesita
tion is quite pronounced. That is
Houston, Texas, where the citizens
have had some experience with the
temperament of Postmaster General
Burleson, though himself a Texan.
Under his authority, as director of
the telegraph and telephone systems
of the country, the postmaster gen
eral ordered that telephone rates be
advanced to $3 for residence phones
and $7.50 for business phones. The
authorities of Houston protested and
refused their assent. Thereupon, the
postmaster general notified them that
if they did not agree to the advances
he had proposed, he would arbitrarily
impose still greater' ones for resi
dence phones, $3.50 instead of $3 and
for business phones, $9 instead of
$7.50. This threat reminds us some
what of Prussianlsm, something of the
methods of von Bissing, in dealing
with the Belgians.
Doubtless the postmaster general
has authority to prescribe the charges
which shall be made for telephone
service. Tlfe government assumed a
financial responsibility in taking con
trol of the telephone lines and with
the liability it must have derived the
authority to safeguard itself against
loss. But has the postmaster general
legal or moral authority to penalize
people for not being as obedient as he j
thinks they ought to be?
If the government, in the opinion
of Mr. l'urleson, could safeguard itself
against loss by the figures, that is the
advances, he first proposed, the fig
ures which he threatened, would rep
resent extortion, which the private
owners of the telephone system would
not have dared to try to exercise and
which public utilities commissions
would not have allowed them to ex
ercise. The difference between the
figures proposed and the figures the
postmaster general threatened. In a
city the size of Houston, would repre
sent a large sum of money and would
be regarded as a fine placed upon the
municipality for (having refused meek
ly to submit to the order of the post
master general. The people of north
ern France and Belgium within the
last four years have had a great deal
of experience with this sort of thing.
The Galves'on News, commenting
on this inciden.- says: "The facts pre
sent a luminouj case of bureaucracy.
The surprising circumstance is that
it should have been allowed to pre
sent Itself while the question of gov
ernment ownership of telephone lines
is under consideration, for it rises as
a warning of one of the inevitable
consequences of government owner
ship. No community would have a
voice or authority in determining the
rates it shall pay; they would be de
termined in Washington by some one
in no degree answerable to those upon
whom the charges would fall as a
tax, and any obstreperousness on the
part of the community would incur
a fine as a vindication of the bureau
cracy's dignity.
"It is doubtful if the evils of bureau-
j craey are separable from government
ownership. Tiiey seem to be Inevi
r tably a price to be paid for whatever
1 benefits may be derived from govern
ment ownership'. Can the benefits be.
worth the price? The postmaster gen
eral, wl.ile preaching the beauties of
.government ownership of telephone
; lines, with singular fatuity, has given
a most signal deiiioutsration of one
of its evils." Arizona Republican.
CITIZENS TURN NEW LEA VES
E3
Begin New Year Right With Many 'Resolutions
S WEARING" OFF IS POPULAR
Good resolutions in abundance were
formulated by Bisbee people at mid
night, when nineteen eighteen, with
its sorrows and tribulations died and
nineteen nineteen made its infantile
bow to the publ.c. An attempt made
by a Review reporter to obtain from
a number of well known citizens a
statement as to their personal resolu
tions met with failure. It is certain
that deep down in the hearts of every
man there is a desire to "turn over a
new leaf in some direction. The Re
view therefore offers the following list
of resolutions:
Mayor Jacob Erickson To get
down as much paving in Bisbee as
possible during my administration.
Justice of the Peace J. L. Winters
To succeed myself in office, being the
same today as yesterday and the same
tomorrow, settling as many cases out
of court as possible, by bringing
would-be litigants together.
The bunch of out-going office hold
ers To get to work.
The bunch of incoming office hold
ers To get to work.
Paul Lorenzen To smile and smile
and smile at ALL of 'em.
Bill Truax, jr. To have pork and
beans three times a week. ,
Judge J. D. Taylor To feel pleased
and happy because of peace.
John Twomey To keep 'em coming
back for more of the same old stuff on
the big black board.
Joe Downs To hew closely to the
line.
'Doc" Ball To remember that ev
ery little pellet has a meaning all its
own.
John Bowen To continue singing
that "jazz" Studebaker melody.
Jack Mertaugh To learn the words
and music of "I'm the Papa of a
Bouncing Baby Girl."
Walter Lanford Ditto.
Justice of the Peace Jiuunie" Alli
son To remember that no jurist ever
thinks in terms of less than a "ten dol
lar fine.

GUN MEN HOLD UP
Held up at Bakerville by two
masked men who, he claims, pointed
pistols at him and demanded his wal
let. Frank Morales, driver of a service
car, stated to the officers last night
that he had lost approximately $100.
The - amount was rumored to have
been $250, but investigation ihows
the smaller sum to be more nearly
correct.
According to Morales' story to the)
ofiic.'ers, he was approached early In
the night by two men who, after tele
phoning to a place In Bakerville,
hired the automobile to take them
out. Upon arriving at the house, the
men alighted from the car and entered
it, leaving Morajes in the car with in
structions to fait for them.
Shortly aiterward. two masked mvi
appeared from the direction of the
house and pointing pistols at Morales
ordered him to hand over his wallet.
He complied at once. They left hur
riedly. Morales called for assistance
several times, but no one came to his
aid until the two passengers he had
brought from Lowell returned from
the house. He told them of the affair
and they drove to Lowell, where
IX-puty Sheriff John Ryan was noti
fied. He accompanied them to Baker
ville to investigate.
One account of the holdup said that
the house in front of which the rob
bery occurred had been held up toy
the masked men after the car had
left. However.5 this could not be' con
firmed. Morales told the officers he ha1
changed two large denomination bills
on the streets of IjowpII the day previ
ous before several onlookers.

RENEWED ANCIENT CUSTOMS.
LONDON, Dec. 31. Evidence that
the war Is ended came again tonight
in the London celebration of the pass
ing of the old year.
The traditional gathering of Scots
men before St. Paul's cathedral took
place with Wassail and native songs.
Vnc tha last four vears the sadness
of war precluded this celebration, but i
tonight this old custom was renew ea
with enthusiasm.
Tho streets surroundinir St. Paul's
were filled with Scotsmen before mid- i

and exchanged greetings, while j
chimes, silent since the outbreak ofi

CHICAGO GOES WILD. j
CHICAGO, Dec. 31. Chicago cele-;
breted the opening of the New Year,
with an enthusiastic demonstration of
cheering, horn-blowing and shouting, .
and with more celebrators than in
any previous year, and thought a light !

the streets were crowded, whistles

Managers of hotels and cafes, where j

they never had entertained so many

(Ky Hevlew Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Jan. 1, 1919. Father
Knickerbocker and his numerous fam
ily began prying up the "lid" late last
night and had it entirely removed by
the time chimes, whistles, bells and
horns gave riotous greeting at mid
night to the advent of 1919.
A strike of union waiters; called al
most literally at the eleventh hour,
and the excessive cost of high liv
ing cast no damper on their determi
nation ot celebrate properly. They
blithely pawned the family jewels or
mortgaged the lold homestead that
they might be prepared for emergen
cies. Two Factors in Merriment
The oldest inhabitants of Boardway
and adjacent streets in the "roaring
forties" admitted unanimously that for
merriment and noise it was the most
successful New Year's eve they could
remember. They attributed the whole
souledness of the celebration to two
factors. One was that war no longer
cast a ghastly shadow over the spirits
of mankind and the other was the
prospect that when 1920 appears upon
the scene, toasts will be drunk in
nothing more enlivening than chaste
tea or foaming ginger ale.
By a special dispensation of Mayor
Hylan, permits were issued to 150 of
the more popular hotels and cafes to
continue the festivities for an hour
and a l?alf after the usual closing
time at 1 a. m. and all availed them
selves of the privileges to the last
moment.

strike, which, according to union lead
ers gained 3500 supporters during the
day, were the Baltimore, Manhattan,
Gotham, Savoy, Ansouia, Belleclaire,
Lafayette and Brevoort. Restaurants
affected include the Fifth avenue, Sa
varin, Voisin, Elysee and Avignon.
In the merrymaking crowds were
thousands of soldiers and sailors.
The Hotel Men's association, antici
pating the extension of the strike,
which has been in progress in several
hotels for some weeks, had mobilized
more than 1500 relief waiters and
these were rushed in automobiles to
places where the waiters walked out.
The Rltz-Carleton, one of the hotels
affected by the strjke, met the situa
tion by throwing a .detachment of
uniformed soldiers into the places va
cated by the waiters and, as it was
a "victory new year's eve" anyway,
the fighters were warmly received and
reaped veritable harvests of tips.

Regrets Clumsy Propaganda.
Prince Carl said lie regretted that
the German propaganda in the United
States had been carried out in what
he termed such a clumsy manner.
Germany, he declared, should have
started her propaganda on a larger
scale and spent millions of marks in
stead of thousands. The greatest
fault with Germany's diplomacy, he
added, was the persistent disregard of
the importance of national psychology
and failure to appreciate the poiits of
view of other nations.
The prince was discharged from
the German army at Hanover I few
days ago and is living at his castle at
Naumedy, on the Rhine near Ander
nach. He said bis first intimation of
Cermany's military collapse was when
the high command sent an order to
him on the western front to man a
telephone with an officer of the per
sonnel. The only troops in the in
terior of Germany, the prince added,
when the recent trouble started were
replacement battalions of young, un
trained men who were easily con
taminated by bolshevik doctrines. It
was his opinion, he asserted, that this
would not have happened if an old
time German ofiicer had been com
manding. 60,000 Hun Officers Killed.
The prince concluded the interview
by saying that 60,000 German officers
had lost their lives during the war.
Prince Carl was German military
attache with the Japanese army dur
ing the Russo-Japanese war. He is
said to have been extremely pro
Japanese and strongly anti-Russian.
During tho visit to Germany in 1907
of the late King Edward. Prince Carl
was relieved of command of the first
regiment of dragoon guards, of which
King Edward was the honorary com
mander. It was rumored at the time
tiiat his friendliness to the Japanese
and hi.-s open hostility to the Russians
was the cause of his transfer.
Laughed at American Army.
Carl is another of the German gen
erals known before the European war
to have held strong prejudice against
the ability of the American army and
navy, on various occasions having be
littled them. His antipathy also ex
tended markedly to the British land
and sea forces?
With regard to Germany's losses in
officers, the Cologne Gazette on No

cers killed at 44.000 and those missing
at 13.000.
party. The former, be said, was an
economic organization which believed
in direct action and sabotage to
achieve its alms. The socialist party,
he explained, was a political party
that stood for compliance with law
and mass action by peacable means.
Socialists,1 he said, believed in evolu
tion rather than revolution.
The witness discussed the efforts
of socialists to abolish war and said
he was a nationalist before an inter
nationalist. ,'
Assisted I. W. W. Funds
He said be had been a citizen of
this country for more than 30 years
and had always regarded himself as
patriotic. He told the jury that he
had purchased some of every issue
of Liberty bonds and had been a mem
ber of the Red Cross for many years
before the recent war.
When asked why he had contrib
uted $10 to the I. W. W. defense fund
In J917, Berger said it was because
he knew they had no money and he
thought they should be given a fair
trial.

to all men in the fleet.
Thorough instruction.
"Under Admiral Sims' direction the
college will expand in its work, so as
to touch every officer in the fleets as
well as those officers who are priv
ileged to go to Newport for a term.
It is my purpose to have assigned to
the college an eminent naval con
structor and along with the study of
tactics and strategy there will be the
study of naval construction. We
have learned many things about the
building of ships and the importance
of the protection of ships during this
war. Other officers and other staffs
and corps will also have the advan
tage of attendance at the war col
lege. "It will be manifestly unjust now
to put in force an order that no man
should be assigned to an important
place in the fleet who had not taken
the college war course, but we are
looking toward that end and must
make provision for affording oppor
tunity to all officers to take this
course. When this has been done
promotion and leadership in then avy
should go to those who have mastered
strategy and tactics as taught at the
war college as well as to those who
hav shown mastery over the seas in
the actual practice of seamanship
afloat."
FALTIN'8 FATE UNDETERMINED.
There ia peculation in Phoenix over
what Governor Campbell will do in the
case of William Faltin, convicted
about three years ago in Phoenix of
the murder of his partner in a hovel
near Phoenix and sentenced to death.
The warden of the penitentiary re
fused to carry out the sentence, al
leging his belief in the prisoner's in
sanity. He was committed to the in
sane asylum, whence he escaped, to
be recaptured, pronounced Bane by a
jury of physicians and returned to
Florence, with the death sentence still
over him. Then the state abolished the
death penalty. Now the death penalty
has been revived by the voters and a
new governor and warden will be in
office a week hence. Faltin's victim
was Btricken down from behind with
a blow from a plowshare and then
was buried under a heap of fertilizer
material.
WEARS MANY INSIGNIA.
D. F. Johnson, Jr., of Phoenix, son of i
the state treasurer, is at home on a 1
furlough, and the sleeve of the jacket
of his naval uniform shows more in
signia than has been noted on the uni-!
form of any of the returning service
men. It all means that he is an expert i
gun pointer, member of a six-inch gun 1
crew ot the U. S. S. St. Louis, one of j
Uncle Sam's light cruisers, and that j
he has seen 15 months' active service
in the war zone. This latter fact is j
attested by two gold bars. Young .
Johnson, who is now but IS years of
age, enlisted when be was 17 and is
one of the youngest gun pointers in
the navy. On board the St. Louis dur-!
ing his 15 months' service in -the war
zone, fie made 12 trips as convoy for
transports going to and coming from
France. Johnson has a 30 days' fur
lough, most of which he will spend
with his parents.'

RUSSIAN PRISONERS IN
MOST PITIABLE STATE
Shoeless and With Few Clothes Are
Making Way From. Germany to Na
tive Villages; Revulsion Toward
Bolshevik! Evident Attitude
WASHINGTON, Dec. 81. Official
advices to the state department today
say the first contingent of Russian
piisouers of war reaching Omsk and
Chilabinsk on their way from Ger
many and Austria are in a pitiable
condition because of lack of clothing
and shoes. Forty thousand, according
to estimates, are endeavoring to re
turn to Siberia, and of these 15,000
have Insufficient clothing. Seven
thousand are reported in Samara
without shoes.
The American Red Cross at Chila
binsk, though handicapped by lack of
material, is rendering all the assist
ance possible. The Russian Red
Cross is said to be unable to give any
aid.
The prisoners relate stories of ex
treme hardships and privations. The
bolshevik authorities, the report says,
are seeking to Induce the former
prisoners to join the Red army, but
the prisoners are reported strongly
resentful against the Reds and hor
rified at atrocities they had witnessed.
Postal Censorship
In Occupied Strip
AMERICAN ARMY OF OCCUPA
TION, Sunday. Dec. 29. (By the As
sociated Press.) The postal censor
ship as imposed by the American de
cree for the conduct of Germans with
in the area of occupation became ef
fective today. The censorship does
not apply to mail for circulation
within the occupied area, but all let
ters and packages for points outside
the area must pass through the cen
sorship. All incoming mail also is
censored.
The censorship force consists of
two officers and forty-five enlisted
men with offices at Treves and Cob
lenz, an officer being in charge of
each headquarters. The soldiers are
picked men. Soldiers with a knowl
edge of German are in demaud in the
censorship and other departments of
the third army, but so far there has
been no real shortage, as men are be
ing brought from divisions not in
cluded in the army of occupation.
"WHITE LIE," BILL
AT EAGLE THEATER
You could hardly be deceived in a
clever and more legitimate way while
attempting to guess the nature of a
subject in advance. You are dead
sure it is, going to be a suggestive
picture. Why? Doesn't the heroine
tell in the presence of the audience
by a substitute, of course that she
deceived her husband as to the real
father of her child? Isn't that plain
enough? What more do you want?
She is guilty. Hang her.
But you have another guess com
ing, as the picture is as clean as you
wish to see.
Complications abound a-plentj:. in
this thrilling Barriscale picture and
holds the suspense from beginning to
the last. It is a play you will thor
oughly enjoy. ' Lonesome Luke." in
the two-part comedy, "Lonesome Luke
Loses Patients." completes the bill.
"The White Lie" will be shown at
the Eagle today.
LYNCHINGS IN PAST YEAR.
Bv Review Leaned Wire)
TUSKEGEE, Ala.. Dec. 31 Sixty
two lynchings took place in the United
States in 1918, according to records
compiled by Tuskegee institute and
made public tonight. The total, which
includes 58 negroes and 4 white per
sons, is an increase of 24 over last
year. Five of the number were
women. The largest number of
lynchings occurred in Georgia, where
18 persons were thus put to death.
Nine persons were lynched in Texas.
KIDNEY TROUBLE NOT
EASILY RECOGNIZED
APPLICANTS FOR INSURANCE
OFTEN REJECTED
An examining physician for one of
the nrominent life insurance co;;-.-
panies. in an interview of the subject,
made the astonlshinc statement that
one rtson why so many . applicants
for insurance are rejected is because
kidney trouble i3 so common to the
American people, anil the large major
ity of those whose applications a;e
declined do not even suspect that they
have the disease. !
Judging from reports from druggists j
who arc constantly in direct touch ;
wilh the public, there is one prepara- j
tmn. that has bctn very cucccsstul in
overcoming these conditions. The mild i
and healing iufluer.c" cf Dr. Kilmer's j
Swamp-Root js soon realized. It stands j
the highest for its remarkable record I
of success.
We find that Swamp-Root is strict
ly an herbal compound and we votilu '
advise our readers who feci in n'ed j
of such a remedy to give it a trial. J
It is on sale at all dnis stores in hot '
llet; of two fdes, medium and large.

9Y REVIEW
NEW YORK, Dec. 31. The final
day of the year on the stock exchange
was noteworthy less for the activity
'and scope of the trading, which fell
considerably under the huge turn
over of the preceding day, than, for
the pronounced change from pessi
mism recently prevalent throughout
the financial community.
Prices were firm at the outset, but
the market immediately developed
uncertain tendencies as a result of
the heavy offerings of stocks and
bonds for cash, these being made,
mostly at concessions, to adjust year
end tax income accounts.
Liquidation of this character ran its
course before midday, conditions
thereafter becoming more orderly and I
settled, with a moderate inquiry for
seasoned rails, industrials and spe
cialties of recognized value.
Foremost in the latter group were
the oils. Mexican Petroleum reg
istered an extreme gain of 12 points,
Texas company loj( Pan-American
Petroleum, common and preferred, 4i
and 6. respectively, and others 1 to 2
points. United States Steel failed to
hold its extreme gain of a point, but
kindred issues were firm to strong
with coppers, motors and a few equip
ments, notably Baldwin Locomotive.
Sales, 935,000 shares.
Bonds were irregular, some railway
issues yielding 1 to 2 per cent, but
the Liberty division strengthened per
ceptibly, fourth 4'4s, for example,
rising to $96.20, against yesterday's
low record of $94. Total sale9, par
value, $27,230,000. Old United States
bends were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET. I
CHICAGO. Dec. 31 Prospects of
colder weather tonight and of much i
larger receipts next week tended to- i
day to weaken the corn market. The
prices closed unsettled. 1 net lower
to c advance, with January $1.42? '
to $1.42 and May $1.35 to $1.36.!
The finish in oats was unchanged to ;
l5ic down and in provisions varying
from 50c decline to a rise of 30c.
At first the corn marXet showed an
upward slant except for December.
Offerings of other deliveries were
temporarily scarce, but selling pres
sure became general aner prediction?
that temperatures wouia fail through
out the main portion of the corn belt.
The inference was popular that In
creased arrivals would soon follow
the cold wave. Bearish views were
also expressed as to the attorney gen
eral's ruling about price fixing after
January 1.
Speculative selling associated with
the visible supply enlargement had a
bearish effect on oats.
Provisions averaged lower with
corn.
