Octcber 3 repealed provisions of tho
previously enacted food control law
which flatly - prohibited the importa
tion of any distilled spirits. Now the
question has been placed before the
atiorney general, however, for a de
cision, and in the meantime the food
law prohibition remains in effect.
That section of the food law, passed
August 10. after prohibiting the manu
facture of distilled beverages in this
country, says:
"Nor shall there be imported into
the UnUed Spates any distilled spir
its." Section 301 of the revenue law.

ucts the growth of such islands, and
not then into any state or territory
or district of the United States In

toxirating liquor is prohibited), or'

Mr. Becker held that the words "pro-i

in the revenue law, in effect, pef-i
mitted the admission to entry of spir

the act. Instructions consequently,
'were addressed to all collectors ad-;

Today these Instructions were re
called, high officials of the depart
ment taking the stand that the ques-j
tion was one of such magnitude that
Attorney General Gregory should pass
upon it. .
The effect of the decision of the
solicitor would be to make available
for importation and consumption here
the great store or whisky, cordials.
liqours and other distilled beverages j
produced aborad prior to the enact-:
ment of the revenue law. j
How far Mr. Becker's Interpretation'
of the law became operative before j
the recall of instructions is not known.
The instructions were 48 hours old
when recalled. The collector at New
York, for example, had all of today in '
which to permit the entry of distilled
spirits into the country. i
Such admission applied not only to
Importations arriving today, but also
shiDments reaching the United
states after the enactment of the food
control law and seized by customs of
ficials to await final disposition by the
department.
If acted upon today, the effect of
these instructions will have been to
admit into the country large stores
of such importations.

POSSIBILITY
OF FULL LOAN
Only 26 Per Cent of Total Has
Been Officially Accounted
for by Treasury Department
Officers.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oot. 22. Treasury
officials announced tonight that re-'
ports reaching the department of Lib-
erty loan subscriptions throughout the '
the nation today were not of a char- J
acter to warrant confidence that $5,-
000,000,000 maximum quota desired j
would be achieved. j
Virtually on the eve of the cam-;
paign's finish, it appears that the total,
will fall short of the huge sura set as:
the country's goal. Only an avalanche;
of dollr.rs can bring the lists up to thej
full maximum quota. j
Liberty Day, officials assert, will do
much todward bringing be goal near-.
er, bu Libery Day will no do It all.
The remaining three and one-half
days, they assert, must bedays of. the j
most strenuous endeavor and big re-1
suits if the total runs to $5,000,000,-1
000. !
'Indications from increases shown
by latest official reports of sales and,
such scattering unofficial estimates o.
today's business' as trickled tuto thei
treasury departtjaent are thatVhe $2,j
000,000,000 mark has" been well pass-!
ed," says the treasury's announcement)
tonight, "and that possibly $2 250,000,-
000 has been subscribed."
A total of unofficial estimates was
not available from the 12 official fed
eral reserve bank.. Officials delayed
the issuance of the statement tonight
beyond the usual hour, waiting for
reports, but few came In.
:Optimism is being expressed by
many, the announcement continued,
in the belief that Liberty Day and
eleventh-hour sales will carry the to
tal across the maximum quota mark.
It is considered unlikely by careful
observers, however, that these two
elements alone will result in tne
larger total.

I am sure that the southwest, like
other parts of America, is ablaze with
patriotism," the statement said. "This
part of the United States particularly
resents the insults and perfidy of the
German kaiser, when, although the
United States was then at peace with
Germany, the kaiser secretly offered
to turn Texas. Arizona and New Mex

Secretary of the Navy Declares That the Social Evil Is a Greater
Menace to Humanity and to All of the Nations Involved in
the War Than the War Itself. Urges Continence as the
Only Solution of the Growing Evil in Country.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO. Oct. 22.,-Pealing frankly
and boldly with the social evil as a
menace to the nation's military effici
ency, Secretary Daniels of the navy
in an address here tonight before the
Clinical Congress of Surgeons of North
America, appealed to the medical pro-
fession "to end the false double stand-

"There is not an army in the field
whose effectiveness is not reduced by
reason of immoral disease" said Secre
tary Daniels.
"The navy suffers likewise and busi

destroys the 'manhood of workers and
fighters. During the last statisacal
year men of the American navy lost
111,344 days sickness from a small
gi'jup of absolutely preventable dis

sin. This means that every day
throughout the year there were 456
men disabled by this disgraceful mal

quired to care for the disabled and we
have enough men on the non-effective

F. N.WOLCOTT OF
TOMBSTONE MEETS
DEATH BY ACCIDENT
Was Killed While Hunting in
lit? Chiricahus Mountains.
Details Are Lacking. Resi
dent cf County Since 1831.
Telephone word was received here late '
yesterday afternoon to the effect that
F. N. Wolcott, the Tombstone mer
chant, had met his death while out
hunting in the Chiricahua mountains.
No details of how Jiis death occurred
could be obtained. The report was
phoned in from Pearce- that he had ;
met his death and that Judge Winters!
of Lowell was there with the body. I
As far as could be ascertained Mr.
Wolcott and his son Newton " left
Tombstone on Sunday afternoon fcri
a hunting trip to the mountains in the'
hopes of securing a deer, and went
to the mountains in the vicinity of fie
head of Shaw canyon, and that early
this morning he met his death. There'
were no particulars as to whether he
was killed by someone, who took him i
for a deer, or whether he was killed '
by his own gun, but t.'ie latter seems
hardly probable as he had been ,
handling guns for years and was j
regular hunter. As soon as the word i
reached Tombstone Deputy Sheriff
Harry Rafferty, accompanied by John!
W. Walker and Edward Hughes, left
in a machine to the scene of the ac
cident. Up to a late hour last night
they had not returned to Tombstone
or to any place of communication.
Theer are no phones now in that sec
tion of the country.
Mr. Wolcott was one of the pioneer
residents of Cochise county. He came
to Tombstone In 1SS1 and engaged in
the mercantile business and has con
tinued in that business up to the pres
ent time. He was married in TomV
stone in 1SS4 to Miss Emma Krinsle
and as a result of the marriage there
are three children, Mrs. Eva Wallace,
the oldest being a resident of Warren;
Mrs. Lucy Kyle of EI Paso, and the
son Newton, who was with him at the
time of his death and who has been
a resident of this district for the past
few years, and who only recently re
turned from San Antonio, where he
passed the examination to enter the
aviation corps and is awaiting call.
Mr. Wolcott was a man of sterling
character and his friends throughout
the state of Arizona are numbered by
the thousands and they will regret
to learn of his untimely end. He waj
l t , t : l ?
Tombstone and the funeral services
will no doubt be held under their aus-
pices. In the death of .Mr. Wolcott
Cochise county loses one of its most
substantial citizens and a man who
has been the friend to many a poor!
miner and prospector in the early days!
of the county. He was 67 years of;
age.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a, problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or -discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

Tuesday Morning, October 23, 1917.
For nearly two weeks the federal commission, ap
pointed by President Woodrow Wilson to investigate gen
eral labor conditions in the southwest and west, has
been working in Globe, Yesterday, the committee, which
is headed by Secretary of Labor W. B. .Wilson, made a
report and some recommendations. Those recommenda
tions and findings merely -accentuate tho beliefs that
patriotic people in Arizona have held for months, and
the recommendations are bridges over political chasms
which exist in the country.
The commission will shortly visit Bisbee. Of much
interest to the casual observer is the fact that no I. W.
W.'s are to be found in this district. This was proven
when the federal authorities did not arrest one defendant
in this camp. Another bright spot in the controversy
is the fact that few if any professional labor agitators,
whether they be of the I. W. W. stripe or of any other
brand, have found refuge in the Warren district
Globe has been a hotbed of treason from the I. W. W.
organization and aided by the other craft unions, or their
officials. A glance at the court's criminal calendars will
bear mute evidence to the assertion. The Globe-Miami
mining district has been hampered in its production cf
copper, so necessary to the welfare of the nation's busi
ness; the business people of the communities have suf
fered to a degree and the men who wanted to work have
been forced to leave through intimidation and treasonable
practices.
Apparently, the commission sent to investigate the
situation has found that the agitators are alone respon
sible fcr the strike. The commission recommends that
former employes of the mines be given preference. The
Globe operators offered their former employes an oppor
tunity to return to work. Some did. The crux of the
matter, however, is found in the recommendation of the
commission that no further lock-outs be called.
It now remains to be seen whether or not the com
mission, which is very favorable to labor and its aims,
has real influence over the members of the crafts and
can change the attitude of some of the agitators from
one of treason to one of co-operation when the
nation is at war.
IF PETROGRAD FALLS. .
In the capture of Oesel and Dago islnads by the Ger
mans there is nothing to strike consternation into the
hearts of the allies. It is not a victory of major impor
tance to the. invaders, nor of major consequence to the
defenders.
Rather, it is simply another step in the Teutonic ad
vance toward Petrograd, for the possibility of which ad
vance Teutonic intrigue, bribery and deceit, and ignor
ance, anarchy and disruption within the ranks of the
Russian army are responsible.
It may mean the ultimate fall of the Russian capital
the evident objective of the German drive toward the
northeast, in which the capture of Riga was the outstand
ing Incident.
Possession of these two islands virtually give the Ger
mans possession of the Gulf of Riga and the key to the
Gulf of Finland, and under ordinarily favorable condi
tions should render the advance to Petrograd a compara
tively simple matter.
However, the season is all in the allies' favor. The
rigorous northern Russian winter is just setting in, and
unless it proves to be an exceptionally mild wniter fur
ther extensive maneuvers of military advances before
spring will be difficult and expensive in the extreme to
the invaders, both in men and treasure. It is doubtful if
the Germans will consider the possible prize worth tb'j
certain sacrifices, preferring to wait for Bpring.
In the meantime, the Anglo-French forces will con
tinue pounding the Germans on the western front! Ameri
ca will be preparing itself for the great part it is to play
in the zone of fighting, and Russia will have the winter
months' valuable 'recess to devote to putting Its military
and governmental affairs to rights and to grubbing out
the roots of sedition and mutiny.
It it, hardly probable, therefore, that Petrograd will
ever fall into German hands, because by next spring
Russia certainly will be able to hold at bay whatever
German forces can be spared from the western front to
prosecute a continuance of the invasion to the east.
But even should Petrograd itself fall into enemy hands
during the winter or next spring, it would by no means
be a loss that would be fatal or evep staggering to the
Russians or their allies.
From a strategic standpoint it wculd amount to littl
to the enemy; and about all he would get would be th
bare city itself. The capital would long in advance have
been removed to Mos-ow and all of the supplies and
materials of value to the foe would have been removed
farther inland to places of security.
But in the evacuation of the city by the Russians, the
German sentiment, the pseudo pacificism, the mutiny,
the sedition, the anarchy would be left behind given
back to the German military machine which gave it bein;;
and to which it belongs; Russia will have done with it;
and, having purged itself of it, will be a mightier Rus
sia than ever before.
For that one reason many wise statesmen and some
among the best Informed students of world affairs argue
that the fall of Petrograd would even be a good thing
for Russia and for the cause of democracy.
Its possession by Germany at the most, would be
but temporary, because the ultimate defeat of Germany
is as certain as tomorrow's sun. And when Petrograd
should be returned to Russia it would become a different
Petrograd from what it is today.
It is, of course, not to be hoped that the city will be
wrested from Russian control; but if it should be which
will be this winter or not at all its fall will not be n
serious disaster to the allies.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)

WILSOX "DON'T WORRY, WE WILL GET THE WAR SUPPLIES
AND SOLDIERS TO YOU." '
FOOD AND THE WAR. '
The bitter denunciation of our embargo on food ex
ports by pro-German newspapers in Holland was pub
lished on the same day with a trustworthy estimate of
Germany's new crops, says the New York Times. There
is only a little more than half of a normal yield, the
reduction being 40 per cent for wheat 45 for rye, oats,
and barley. These figures show a perilous shortage in a
country which found it necessary to import large quanti
ties of grain before the war. In Austria and Hungary
crop conditions are even worse. Winter is at hand. Al
lowances of food for the people of these countries are
blrtady very small. They will be reduced. The crops
of all the northern neutrals are far below average. Ger
many can have little or nothing from Holland, Denmark,
Norway, or Sweden unless they are assisted by imports.
We do not say that any part of grain on the eighty
four Dutch ships held here would go directly to Germany
if it should be released. But some of it would cross the
border in other forms. Holland has a quarrel with En?
l3nd tecause the use of cables has been withheld from
her. Put this has been done for the reason that Hollnni
pciuits Germany to use her waterways and territory
for the transportation of great quantities oX sand anil
gravel for the concrete needed in trench warfare. Eng
Inna Fays that there must be no more of this. By their
embargoes both the United States and England say !hey
will not assist the neutrals to help Germany.
Such expressions as are found in the pro-German press
of Holland were to be expected. German influence is
powerful in that country, with the aid of German intrigue,
exposed in many other parts of the world. It seeks to
make the Dutch our open foes. One paper talks ahout
i "declaration or war." The president of the Overseas
Trust, which controls imports, says our government "U
rlaving a high hand." It Is a strong hand because the
cards in it are high, and it is played fairly, with due
regard for the interests which it represents. He knows
that there has been playing in the neutral countries which
was not fair. "Food will win the war," Mr. Hoover says.
Lack of food will hasten the defeat of our enemy and
pave the lives of American soldiers. The United States
and England will strive in every legitimate way to pre
vent relief of Germany's food shortage by supplies from
a oread.

SECRETARY OF WAR DOES NOT THINK
WINTER WILL STOP THE ALLIES ON
WEST FROM POUNDING EFFECTIVELY
Thus the events in Russia today
should cause us to have increased con
fidence iu final allied victory.
"Along the western front trench
raids, as well as the usual artillery
duels, are reported. Isolated counter
attacks were conducted by ;lie enemy
in such a manner as to indicate that
no real success was expected, but

To keep these poisons and toxins
well flushed from the stomach, liver,

Get a quarter pound of limestone

is inexpensive and almost tasteless,
except a sourish twinge which is not
unpleasant. Drink phosphated hot
water every morning to rid your sys

also to prevent their formation.
To feel like young folks feel; like
you felt before your blood, nerves and

"In Alabama, at Birmingham,

Dr. Garfield said that reports of a
coal famine in Chicago were not borne
out by official information and that
the coal on hand there, both anthra
cite and bituminous, is greater than
a year ago.
At the offices of the administration
today it was stated that investigation
had disclosed a dozen cases of hoard
ing by individual concerns in the mid
dle west. The administration soon
will have information from 100,000
concerns shownig ho winuch coal they
have on hand, how much they use per
month, etc. The first remedy for
hoarding will be the suspension of
shipments to the hoarders.

The end of the strike, which has
tied up the copper industry in the
Globe .Viutni district since July, was
brought about by the acceptance of
the suggestions made by the investi
gation commission to the mine man
agers this evening. The members ol
the iniiicrs' union had previously votei!
to accept the suggestions of the com
mission.
Wliile it was not compulsory upon
the part of either the operators or the
miners to agree to the proposals of
the commission, it was believed that
the government would eventually ruta
that the two factions would have to
accept the findings of the commission.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEWYORK. Oct. 22. Advances of
1 to 4 points in the Erst half of the
today's stock market session were
forfeited later, the market closing with
a heavy trend. Early improvement
was most general in wr shares and
the varied groups of equipments, rails
and metals holding back.
Developments over the week-end
received favorable Interpretation for
the most part and the rapid growth
of I.ibertx loan was again a factor.
Money rates were virtually undisturb
ed, despite She heavy loss reported in
local bank reserves lar-t Sna'rday.
Tracing was of a promising charac
ter, public inquiry reflecting only, a
moderate accession. J
Pools continued their bullish activ
ity in numerous speculative issues at
pi oss advances of substantial propor
tions, but these, too, were surrender
ed before the close.
Gas shares were depressed even
when other specialties were inclined
to advance. Consolidated Gas dropped
6 points and People's Gas established
a new minimum at 39.
United States Steel reacted from
107. Its top of the forenoon, to 10414

Independent steels, notably Bethle
hem, Crucible and Lackawanna, met
with similar reversals, and early sub
stantial sains tn Baldwin and Ameri
can Locomotives were lost. Sales
amounted to 715.000 shares.
Enlarged dealings in the irregular

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Oct. 22. A decided up-
shoot which took place in corn prices
today resulted largely from the fact
that the amount of corn on hand in
Chicago had been reduced to the small
est total in many years. The market
closed strong 1 to 2c net higher,
with December HC?i to 116. and
Miy 110 to 1101.. Oats ad
vanced V4 to c and provisions
20c to $1.50. '
An aggregate of only 36,000 bushels
of corn in Chicago elevators today
contrasted sharply with 1,058.000 bush
els a year ago and drew attention
to the meagerness of the visible sup
ply in the country as a whole 1.656,
000 bushels as against 8.870,000 bush
els last year.
In this connection smallness of
hedging sales were taken to Indicate
but slight prospects of stocks accumu
lating at terminals, especially is talk
was current of pronounced car short
age at rural stations and of Insuffi
ciency of labor for rapid work In husk
ing and shucking.
Oats derived strength almost wholly
from the bulge in the corn market.
Assertions that recent drastic breaks
in the price of pork and ribs had car
ried those commodities far below the
cost of manufacture led today to no
table upward swings in the provision
market. Increased commission house
buying was evident, especially in the
January delivery of pork.

Juice of Lemons!
How to Make Skin
White and Beautiful
At the cost of a small jar of ordin
ary cold cream one can prepare a full
quarter pint of the most wonderiui
lemon skin Softener and complexion
beautifler, by squeezing the Juice of
two fresh lemons into a bottle con
taining three ounces of orchard white.
Care should be taken .to strain the
juice througn a nne ciuiu so no icniuu f
pulp sets in, men mis iouon win Keep
fresh for months. Every woman knows
that lemon Juice is used to bleach and
remove such blemishes as sallow ness,
freckles, and tan and is the Ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifler.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra-J
zrant lemon lotion and massage it
daily into the face, neck, arms and
hands. It naturally should help to
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin.' It
Is wonderful to smoothen rough, red
hands.
Grand Lodge Buys
Liberty Bonds
Harry Aplin and Earl Sobrey have
returned from Prescott where they
went to represent the Rathbone Lodge
No. 10, the local lodge, at the sessitm
of the grand lodge. They report thai:
"A great deal of important business
was transacted at the meeting which
is of particular interest to the mem
bership of the order," but to their mind
the most important action taken was
the decision to subscribe for $1,000
b'onds of the Liberty Loaan. The
funds of the grand lodge are not as
great as other fraternal organizations,
and the taking of this amount of the
loan at the present time, means the
sacrificing of other matters fraternal
In which the order is interested, but
in the end it will mean something
more to the membership at large than
the amount contributed.
"The order Knights of Pythias is
peculiarly an American order and its
standard of patriotism is based upon
the principles of royalty that caused
the founder of the order to take as the
exemplification the friendship of Da
mon and Pythias of ancient lore with
which we are all familiar. As Pythias
was ready and eager to lay down his
life for his friend so the members of
this order are ready and R illing ?j give
of the blood and money to support the
American government in its glorious
fight for liberty, and democracy of all
nations all over the globe. We wish
e had had a million instead of a
thousand lo give."
