that the "rights of the delegates to
meet unmolested" in that city v.'julo
be protected.
"We have arranged fo.r the halls and
are assured a Ordial welcome by the
invitation given us by Mayor Hoan,"
said Mr. Hillquit. "For some time
Secretary Lochner considered holding
tae convention in Washington sVj that
the federal government could be put

there was so little time that it would
be impossible to make the necessary
arrangements for halls so that the plau
was abandoned."
Telegrams were sent to the New
Vjrk delegates who left here yester
day, directing them to proceed to Mil
waukee. It was the third time the des

(By Review Leased Yv'Ire.) j
PUEBLO, Colo., Aug. 31. The 't
officials of the exemption board on
appeals. District No. 1, were pre-
sented with a puzzling question to- '
day in attempting to designate the !
names of men to make up Mineral
county's draft quota for the nation-
al army. The entire quota for the
ccunty is five men. Five per cent
would be one-fourth of a man.
The county has certified but one
man to the district board and in- ,
formation received late this after- !
noon is to the effect that this one f
U man is in the hospital with a bro
ken leg. However, the beard de
cided to designate him as five per

Early Reduction in the Price
of Bread Is Not Anticipated
by the Food Administrator
in This Country
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. August 31. Pros
pects of an early and radical reduc
tion in bread prices apparently van
ished today when Herbert Hoover.
food administrator, announced that the
test the public may expect is a six
teen ounce loaf for ten cents or pos
sibility eight cents.
Eight Cent Loaf.
The eight-cent loaf of sixteen ounces
is possible, Mr. Hoover said, if bak
ers, retailers and consumers unite to
eliminate wasteful distribution meth
ods and co-operate to attain a stand
ardized loaf.
The price of family flour, Mr. Hoov
er said, should be reduced from the
present price of wheat at least two or
three dollars a barrel. Baker's flour
will sell little cheaper than at pres
ent. It may be a month before the pro
gram Is ready it was learned tonight.
Bakers To Help.
"The bakers have been and are
holding themselves in readiness." sai l
a statement by Mr. Corby, "to effect
its plans relative to bread.
"The bakers respectfully request th
public to disregard the many ridiu
lous statements abroad, emanatim
from unreliable sources and ask tha
they await the announcement of t:
president relative to the nation's pla
lor bread production."
What Committee Thougnt.
Members of the price coiumitw
which recommended the price of $2.1'
fixed by President Wilson for wheal
I declared after their work was end-d
that the committee was convinced it
was possible to make and sell four
teen ounce loaves of bread for fiva
cents.
Millers Agree.
Millers have agreed to hold their
profits on flour to 25 cents a barrel.
Under this agreement. Mr. Hoover said
(lour should retail in New York from
$11.73 to $12.75 a barrel. The prire
of bakers' patent flour to small bakeri
and retailers he said should be from
$10.25 to $11.25.
Average Price.
The average retail price of family
patent in New York from April to Au
gust has been $15.36. At present
baker's patent is selling in New York
to jobbers at $10.65 which would
make it cost small bakers and reta.l

Of bread prices and prospects of a

Hoover On Prices.
"At the prospective prices for flour
it is improbable that a full lS-oun;e
loaf can be delivered to the consumer
for less than 10 cents per loaf unless

ALL TOGETHER!
All together, now! Get ready to push and boost for
the great Labor day celebration next Monday. Labor day
should be the great day of the year in this district for
the reason that this is a labor district Some 5000 min
ers are employed here besides hundreds of craftsmen
in other trades. Industrial troubels that threatened us
vhave passed away. Workmen and business men have
united for the best interests of the community. A square
deal and high wages and the best of conditions for every
man that wants to work is the motto of the district
Especial efforts are being made on every band and
by all classes of citizens and their wives to make the
celebration next Monday the greatest ever held here.
That the Trades Assembly of the Federation of
Labor, through its officials should promulgate resolu
tions that neither commefid nor condemn the celebration
is to be regretted. But if the official part of organized
labor in the district wish to hold aloof from the festivi
ties of a day devoted to Labor, that is their business, the
rank and file are with us. Hundreds of members of the
Loyalty League are good union men, and many men from
the trades unions of the district will take active part.
It will be a patriotic day as well as a Labor day.
Cochise county's quota for the World War is being mob
ilized, and these boys will be given a grand farewell on
this day. Every one will take part in this part of the
celebration. All good patriots will march in the parade,
burying their petty differences and showing their colors.
This nation is at war, and This Labor Day finds her new
nationalist army that is to go to France being mobilized.
All together now, for Uncle Sam and the hosts that
toil!
The Vigilantes announce that the German language
papers in this country are beginning to see the light.
Recent issues contain little if any treasonable matter.
However, sums up the same authority, that is more than
can be said for certain English language publications in
this republic.
The government has called for the first thirty-four
men from Cochise county to answer the draft to be men
of some military experience. The Warren district is to
furnish fifteen of these, Douglas nine, and the rest of the
county, ten. The drafted men of the district should take
a pride in promptly coming forward for this first quota,
that is, those who have had previous experience in mili
tary school camp, or training ground.
How much does it cost to produce a potato? Has
the cost increased a thousand per cent over the old days
when spuds sold at a nice profit for seventy-five cents per
bushel? Land has doubled in value the past fifteen
years, say the real estate sharks. The price of labor
has doubled. Very well. , Why this cry of despair, then
over farmers ploughing their potatoes under and letting
them rot in the ground because they can get only the
pitiful price of two dollars per bushel for them? Piffle.
Land that yields eighty dollars to the acre in spuds is
the most valuable real estate in the country outside of a
city business section or a gold mine.
The Pacifists are still hunting for a place to hold
their national convention. So far no city has consented
to bear this stigma. The finan haddic who was elected
governor of North Dakota invited them to his state, but
the citizens of Fargo where it was proposed to meet de
clined the doubtful honor. In Minnesota, where the pro
paganda was started and where the officers of the move
ment dwell, the governor refused to sanction their pro
posed jawtest And Minnesota, be it understood, by this
art tries to atone for thp traitor, Gronna In tell United
States senate. Wisconsin, home of certain notorious pac
ifists, also refused to harbor this swarm. Based upon the
returns so far, there is ground for hope that they will
find no city willing to allow them to use Its precincts as
an iucuhator for treason.
OPTIMISMS
Henry Clews, the sagacious and far seeing old New
York banker, must have a good digestion as well as a
good' bank account H? always uses rose-tinted spec
tacles in looking at the world's affairs. In his latest let
ter to the public he writes in part as follows:
"The steady rise in power of the allies and cor
responding decline among the central powers strength
ens the hopes of an early peace; albeit the end of tlu.
war is not yet in view. Germany is by no means ex
hausted to the point of submission to the well known
terms of the allies. Nor are the allies yet able to deliver
a decisive military blow. At the moment their policy
appears to be that of wearing the enemy down; the
relative rise or fall in the strength of opposing armies
being of more significance fo rthe time being than
the acquisition of territory which are geographically
trifling.
"As the war goes on, talking and planning for peace
become more and more definite. Opinion is divided as
to what the effect will be upon American trade, much
depending upon the individual point of view. There Is
no doubt that peace will necessitate extensive readjust-
ments.a These will come gradually and will by ro means
demand a return to old conditions which is imau-ible.
Concerns devoted to war business will be obliged to
scrap considerable of their plant or prepare trr othc
lilies of work. Wr profits would of course di.japper.r,
8nd a few lines of endeavor would cease entirely, iJut
very important offsets would quickly appear. The fact
that the world had turned its face from destruction o
reconstruction would at once set loose great economic
forces. Optimism would promptly succeed despair, and
the work of rebuilding and rearranging the civilized
world would start with a vigor that would soon overcome
all confusion and hesitancy.
"Our steel mills would receive no more war orders,
but far better, they would be pressed with orders for
shipbuilding, for railroads, for buildings and for all kinds
of construction work in all parts of the world.
"Our textile mills would soon recover from loss of
war orders and be fully occupied with both domestic
and foreign ordes.
"Our secondary industries, such as automobiles,
typewriters, agricultural implements, machinery, etc.,
would also be pressed with orders to make good war
losses in Europe. Our mineral producers would be
equally sure of good markets and good prices; so, too,
would the American farmer who may rest assured of
good prices for all he can grow for some years to come.
"The truth is wir has impoverished the whole world.
The waste of life and wealth has been inconceivable.
Millions of lives have been destroyed or impaired, and
the expenditures for war since 1914 of all nations have
been over $90,000,000,000.
"Everything grown or made by the hand of man is
scarce. Years will be required to refill the enormous
vacuum, and the scarcity of men or labor at a time when
most needed means high wages, high prices and a long
period of industrial activity. Of course there will be
periods of weakness and depression. There will be grave
impoverishment of some sections, as well as the crush
ing burden of debt upon all. Difficulties, at present un
perceived, are likely to develop, and recovery from war
does not mean escape from all its losses. But let it be
distinctly be kept in mind, peace when it does come will
find the United States elevated to a pre-eminence indus
trially, commercially and financially that would have re
quired a generation to attain, had it not been for this
cataclysm in Europe.
"The war enriched us enormously, because of the
profits obtained in our foreign trade and the fact that
we have been the least affected of any of the great na
tions. We have suddenly become world bankers, seem
ing a position that will not be surrendered. Even should
Great Britain recover her leadership after the war, wo
will still be a close second, instead of a distant third or
fourth as before the war. Our foriegn trade shows phe
nomenal growth, and while a better balance between
Imports and exports may be necessary, still we have
gained a foothold in foreign markets that will not be
relinquished.
"The future of American export trade is exception
ally brilliant. By far the most significant result of 'the
war to Americans will be the restoration of the United
States to a fitting position as a maritime power. Our
weakness in this respect has long been a thorn in our
national pride. Before the war we ranked close to the
foot of the world's sea-going tonnage, but within a coupl
of years, thanks to prompt seizure of a favorable oppor
tunity, this country may easily become a good second
to Great Britain as a maritime nation."

Depot agents over the country, and among them
F. L. Williams of this place, are urging shippers and
consignees of shipments in carload lots to do their hit
for the war by not holding up freight cars. Merchant-'
and dealers are urged to make every effort to be ready
to lift their bill of lading promptly upon receipt of car.
As an example of the far reaching results of careless
ness or indifference in this regard, Mr. Williams cites
figures to show that over seven thousand freight cars
were held up on an average of four days ea-h by this
negligence. Freight cars are of vital importance In the
conduct of the war.
From time Immemorial the dcain penalty forcow
ardice and desertion in the face of the enemy has been
in effect in the armies of all nations, whether republican
or monarchies. Why the Russians should abolish it
when they needed it the most is past comprehension. It
has been re-established. But its abolition cost more
deaths in battle and by execution than a campaign.

FROMJKiS TIME ON
Notice Published Some Time
Ago Misunderstood in Some
Quarters Regarding Pay
ment for Bisbee's Morning
Newspaper
Abcut the middle of the month, this
paper published a short explanation
of its reason for charging subscribers
for August as well as July, on the
bills that have gone out this month,
ty the carriers and through the mail.
It is found that In most cases, there
has been no misunderstanding in the
matter. In fact, it is not believed
hat anyone who fully understands
that request is NOT for "extra"
money, or even for any unreasonable
tayment in advance, can doubt that
the arrangement is perfectly fair. In
no case, unless so ordered, have bills
been made out beyond September 1.
This means that subscribers are pay
ing for the current month, and are not
paying in Rdvance. The fact that the
majority of the bills did not reach
subscribers until the days following
the second pay day plainly shows that
those who paid these bills p.'id any
where frcm a day to a week in ad
vance. In consideration of the fact
that a number of newspapers make a
definite ruin that no one wantinu the
pnper shall be served until they pav j Iixf d at the recent joint meeting

the accounts on the new basis.
Commencing in September the Re
view will wherever possible collect
subscription account by mail, from
readers who receive the paper by
carrier, as well as those who receive
it through the postoffire. This is
made necessary through the fact that
the increasing cost of distribution,
brought about by our larger circula
tion, higher price of material, etc., de
mands that the paper handle its col
lections as cheaply and quickly as pos
sible. While mail collection will not
entirely take the place of that by cr
rier, it will supplement the latter to a
great extent.
Today the carriers will be around
lo see nil subscribers who said "come
back later," or for any reason did not
understand their bilN. We respeci
fu'ly nre that a!! those who are

amount.

REVELATIONS GIVEN
BY GERARD CAUSE

Members of Beth Branches of
the National Legislature
Are Appreciative of Good
to Come From Such Publicity
DISTRICT BOARD AT
TUCSON CLEANS UP
SAMMIES MARCH THRU FRENCH TOWN ON WAY TO TRAINING CAMF
VA(MONTMEI
Mr. Gerard's revelation have caused
a tremendous sensation in official cir
cles here. Many senators and repre
sentatives who made last-hqur efforts
to obtain copies 'of the Sunday Tublic
Ledges discovered that the unprece
dented demand had swamped the news
dealers ,hence the action by Senator
Brandagee today.
Members cf both branches of the na
tional legislature are keenly apprecia
tive of the importance of Mr. Gerard's
disclosure and their direct and signifi
cant bearing on the international sit
uation. Those who missed reading the
first installment of the ambassador's
book will now be able to do sc in the
Congressional Record.
They are especially interested In the
opening chapters, as they contained
the Kaiser's personal letter of August
10, 1914. to President Wilson, a u'jcu
ment which was then withheld from
publication by Mr. Wilson in the inter
est of preserving good relations with
one of the principal belligerents al
most at the beginning of the European
conflict.
Utmost Historic Value.
It was in this letter, h'jw universally
regarded of the utmost historic im
portance, that the German emperor
admitted that the invasion of Belgium
was a necessity on "strategical
grounds."
"I regard the letter of the emperor
as highly important in the light that
it throws on the incidents at the out
break of the war," said Senator Bran
dagee today in discussing the Gerard
publication. "For the first time the
public learns that the emperor justi
fied the violation of Belgium's neu
trality on the ground of strategy."
Senator Philander C. Knox of Penn
sylvania, former Secretary of stale,
wh is a close student of international
affairs, said: "I greatly enjoyed read,
ing the Gerard article, and I expect to
find illuminating sidt lights in the Ger
man situation in subsequent chapters
of his remarkable bcok."
The Gerard stories are now appear
ing every day in the Los Angeles Examiner.

"In Europe, however, it would seem
that publication of such matters by
common consent, is postponed to later
periods, when Judgments are both
calmer and more mature. Mr. Gerard,
however, may hold the special license
conferred by 'shirt sleeve' diplomacy

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it. is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

BISBEE IMPROVEMENT CO. THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SATURDAY MORNING, SEPTEMEER 1; 1917.

f Mining and Financial News
BY AEVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK. August "31 The tirst
half of today- active slock market
session witnessed a repetition of the
recent liquidation, important stocks
losing two to four points. The
movement was without any semblance
cf demoralization, but also without
signs of support.
During the mid-session rallies of
cne to three points were registered
chiefly in equipments, shippings and
specialties, but the list became un
settled again at the close, mainly on
the higher money rates, call loans ad
vancing to six per cent.
Steel was at all times the outstand
ing feature by reason of its enormous
turnover which aggregated about one
tbird of the day s business. Steel op
ened with 3",.noO shares at 111 to
112'.;. minus the regular and extra
dividends of 4U per cent. Soon it fell
to 109'4. rebounded to 110 and is
suddenly dropped back, closing at
lyO'i, a net loss of 2 points. Cop
pers were heavy, but recovered with
motors although not before Studebak
er had established the new minimum
of 44.
Total sales 910.000 shares.
Bonds were heavy on broader deal
ings. Liberty 3s varied from 99.90
to 99.96.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
13.600.000.
Panama registered 2's rose 1 per
cent on bid, other governments un
changed. GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, August 31. Corn ad
vanced in price today, the increase
beginning with initial sales and con
tinuing virtually without Interrup
tion during the session closing near
the top. Rapid absorption of offer
ings was evident whenever recessions
appeared and at times an oversold con
dition was noted which forced shorts
to cover their lines. Cash strength
was an important feature and some
traders regarded the government
wheat announced today as of bullish
Influence. The close was strong 2 to
2 cents higher, with December at
112 to 112 and May 108 to 108"8.
Oats showed strength with September
leading and closed to 1 higher.
Provisions finished the day with mod
erate gains.
T, rade in cash wheat was light and
prices went through readjustment to
the basis of the government figures
which placed $2.20 a bushel as the
price of No. 1 wheat with variations
for other grades, all figures being at
the Chicago terminal. Buying and
selling of wheat will be in the hands
of the local food administration to
morrow. The new differentials fixed
by the government committee on
wheat did not meet the approval of
the Chicago board of trade and the di
rectors of the board protested against
them on the ground that they were un
just and would work against Chicago
and prevent grain from reaching thiB
market.
Wheat traders generally held aloof
from the market awaiting announce
ment cf the course to be pursued when
the new prices go into effect tomor
row. The board of trade will adjourn to
morrow at 11:30 a. m. as a mark of
respect for the late J. C. F. Merrill,
secretary of the board. There will be
no session Monday, September 3, La
bor Day.
NEW YORK. August 31. Liquida
tion was again heavy and prices re
ceded. A rather steadier tone pre
vailed in the afternoon as a conse
quence of a tendering of moderate sup
port and much scattered short cover
ing. The situation has altered pre
cipitibly. The position of the stock
market is somewhat improved and a
fair sized short interest is outstand
ing but it does not look as though
liquidation has fully run its course
tind while occasional rallies may be
experienced, still it strikes us that
the general trend of securities prices
fare still downward. It is not unlike
ly that the price will be set on steel
products within the course of a few
days and we understand that the same
is likely to prove to be a disappoint
ment to many.
From all we can see and hear inter
ests which are invariably conspicuous
during constructive movements in the
market have made up their minds to
hold aloof until congress is out of the

A NERVOUS WRECK j
From Three Years' Suffering. Say
Cardui Made Her WelL I
Texas City, Tex. In an interesting
statement, Mrs. G. H. Schill, of this town,
says: "For three years I suffered untold
agony with my head. I was unable to
do any of my work.
I just wanted to sleep all the time, for
that was the only ease I could get, when
I was asleep. I became a nervous wreck
just from the awful suffering with my
head.
I was so nervous that the least noise
would make me jump out of my bed. I
had no energy, and was unable to do
anything. My son, a young boy, had to
do all my household duties.
I was not able to do anything until I
took Cardui. I took three bottles in all,
and it surely cured me of those awful
headaches. That has been three years
ago, and I know the cure is permanent,
for I have never had any headache since
taking Cardui. . .
Nothing relieved me until I took Cardui.
It did wonders for me."
Try Cardui for your troubles made
from medicinal ingredients recommended
in medical books as being of benefit in
female troubles, and 40 years of use has
proven that the books are right Begin
taking Cardui today. NC-134
