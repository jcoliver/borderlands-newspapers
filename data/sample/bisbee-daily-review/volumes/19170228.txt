CUT VIOLAIi OF lEii RIGHTS WAS

(By Review LeaseC Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 27. The
sinking of the Cunarder Laconia
by a German submarine, was stat
ed officially today to constitute
a dear-cut violation of American
rights.
Two Americans Die
Conclusive official information
at the state department shows
that two American women lost
their lives, that if four other
Americans among the passengers
and the fourteen among the crew
were saved. It was only by good
fortune and that the vessel was
sunk without warning in direct
defiance of nil tr-e principles for
which t!'e United States has
stood.
Without Warning
Consul Frost's reports from the
survivors landed at Queen:town
and Bantry show that the vessel
was struck by a first torpedo

LEGISLATION NEEDED
TO MEET SITUATION
If Use of Mails, Telegraph and
' Telephones Were Prescrib
ed Something Might Be
Done to Curb Rising Cost
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 27. Attorney
General Gregory today advised Sena
tor Borah that no evidence had been
found up to the present time, except
in two or three cases, to warrant the
federal government in seeking indict
ments in its investigation of the ris
ing cost of living.
No Jurisdiction
The sale of foodstuffs by retailers
to consumers in various cities and
communities, the attorney general
stated, generally falls outside the
jurisdiction of the federal govern
ment, and increases brought about by
"a common selfish impulse of traders
to take advantage of the extraordina
ry condition of the times, are not pun
ishable under any existing federal
law, no matter how completely lack
ing in econonic justification, no mat
ter how extortionate."
Legislation Needed
A possible remedy, the attorney
general said, initht be made by legis
lation making "the charting of extor
tionate prices in interstate commerce
an offense per se. although not the
result of either conspiracy or monop
oly." One of the suggestions was as to
whether the produce exchanges and
stock yards of the country should be
placed under much closer governmen
tal scrutiny and regulation than now
j prevails.
Mr. Gregory' presented his views in
s long letter to the Idaho senator who
is the author of a pending bill to rp-
1 propriate $6,000,000 f-:.r relief of ruf
J ferers of the high co-it of Pving.
j Prescribe Use of Mails
I "Without stopping now to inquire."
the letter said, "how far the federal
government could directly regulate
such exchanges, it could doubtless ac
complish the same object by pre
scribing the conditions uml-r which
thev should be permitted to use the
mails, the telegrams and other intru
mentalities of interstate communica
tion in carrying on their business."
Associations Blamed
Associations existing in almost ev
ery branch of trade, the attorney ptn
eral continued, while performing
some very useful functions, "also in
many instances make their influence
felt in maintaining prices in such a
subtle and intangihh" way, howevc r,
that it is impossibV t: convict iheii
of violating the law." The leniency
of federal judges in imposing n-n-
tences upon those convicted of viola- '
tions of the anti-tnis, law. in some I
instances, were ciU'.l, Mr. Gregory de- !
daring that "a number of federal .

Hungary have been made by Am
bassador Pen held on instructions
from the state department. It
was learned iVitlay that the am
bassador had been directed to
.take this step, the belief at the

take over American interests and
plans have been made to expedite
the withdrawal of all Americans
if the break occurs.

The last report from Ambassa

be favorable. No real hope was

CHANCELLOR BITTER
TOWARDS AMERICA
"nntinued From Pace On i
British endanger American lives? On
ly because neutral countries, and es
pecially America, voluntarily submit
ted to "the British orders, and because
the British, therefore, could attain
their object without employing force."
Confident that Germany would emerge
from the' conflict victorious . and win
for the world freedom of the seas was
expressed by the chancellor. He as
serted that the submarine war would
be pressed to its utmost and informed
the Reichstag that Germany was with
standing the eneny successfully on all
fronts as well as in their latest sub
marine operations.
Victory By Any Means.
"While our soldiers m the front
stand in the drum-fire of the trencnes
and our submarines, defying death,
hasten through the seas: while we at
home have no other absolutely no
other rfask but to produce cannon,
ammunition and food to distribute
victuals with justice; in the midst of
this struggle for life and ljr the fu
ture of our empire, intensified to the
extreme, there is only one necessity
of the day which dominates all ques
tions of policy, both foreign and
domestic to fight and gain victory."
To Continue Struggle.
The chancellor pointed Sut that the
government of the German nation in
Keichstag's last vote granting new
war credits, demonstrated to the
whole world its readiness to continue
the struggle until its enemies were
ready for peace.
"Ye will meet hair way all wishes
of neutrals which can be complied
with," he said, "but in the endeavor
to do so we never can go beVnd the
limits imposed upon us by the ir
revocable decision to reach the aim
of the establishment of the barred
zone.
Freedom of the Seas. . '
"I am sure that later the moment
will come when neutrals themselves
will thank us for our firmness, for the
freedom Kf the seas hich we gain by
fighting is of advantage to them also."
Concerning the negotiations with
the I'nited States the chancellor con
tinued: American Note Contrary.
"As to the American answer given
to the German note, it was so absolute
ly contrary to what we in our note had
said clearly and without any possibil
ity of misunderstanding that a reply
on our part would have changed no
thing as to the standpoinLs maintained
by both sides. But nobody, even an
American, could doubt that already,
the conditions were fulfilled upon
which, according to our declaration,
depended our regaining full liberty jt
decision. , ;
England Cited.
"England did not abandon the isola
tion of Germany . but on the contrary,
ilHeiisilied it. in the most reckless
fashion. Our adversaries were not
made- tu respect the principles of in
ternational law. universally recognized
before the war. nor made to foli'jw
the laws of humanity. The freedom
of the seas which America wanted to
restore, in cooperation with ns, dur
ing the war, has been still more com
pletely destroyed by our adversary,
and America has not hindered this.
All this is common knowledge.
Retaliation Only.
"Even at the end of January, Eng
land Issued a new isolation declara
tion for the North Sea and in this
period since May 1, nine mouths had
passed. Could it then be surprising
that on January :;i we considered
that the freedom of the seas had not
been re-established and wedrew our
conclusion from this? Hut the rase
:.tends beyond that of t'lrmal iiu

now by mutual consent must tight fur

nations. The Eug,li:'h tirvattnn block

the speeches of Lloyd-George are

England Started War.
"It was England who, from the he
ginning, wanted to make this war. not
a war of army against army, but a
war of lid i ion agaiuht nation, aud
after it did so and after its leaders
announced in the face of our will lor

the circus rosters say, 'better than

The show was a bit loiiK. but it was
a Rood show, with no end to the em

ARMED NEUTRALITY.
With American commerce and American people afraid
of the terrible submarine menace and with that agert
of German destruction working day and night in the
waters around the Allied countries, and with the plig'it
of Holland and its great loss in merchant tonnage before
our eyes, nothing can appeal to us more readily thai;
President Wilson's request for permission to use the
forces of the United States to protect American lives and
ships against the U-boat, to put the nation in a state of
armed neutrality.
Through either a fear on the part of the German gov
ernment to commit any overt act which might align the
United States on the side of the Entente nations or
through a desire on the part of the submarine command
ers to treat American shipping with courtesy nothing
has, as yet, taken place which could lie construed as a
reasonable ground for the declaration of war with the
Central powers. What effect the destruction of the La
conia will have is yet a matter of conjecture.
Unrestricted undersea warfare has now been in pro-'
gress for nearly a month. Two American ships Jiave
been sent to the bottcm. Those in a position to know
have taken no umbarge at the acts of the German sub
marines for those actions. With the Netherlands, how
ever, lu-mmed in by Germany and nearly at the la iter's
mercy, losing ship after ship, which contained food fcr
its country, the President of the United States can Jiardly
be blamed for any action he might take to protect Ameri
can lives and shipping from any eventuality.
That there should be a division on the part of congress
and particularly from the Republican side is hard to be
lieve. The minority in congress, with the aid of the ma
jority's pacifists, are said to object to issuing a "blank
check" to the President. It would appear that their ob
jection has no valid grounds in view of the conditions
which now confront the American people.
Congress will soon recess and some of the members of
that body object to going home while the situation is sc
fraught with dangerous possibilities. Some object to giv
ing the President a free hand. Incidentally, it is doubt
ful whether congress could prevent the President froi'i
authorizing American merchantmen from going armed
into the war rone. Mr. Wilson, however, wants the ap
proval of congress in any action lie Diay take.
President Wilson can not declare war. Under our con
stitution that power lies solely with Congress. As a con
sequence, it is difficult to believe that the head of this
great nation, should conditions get into bad shape, would
plunge the country into any trouble without first calling
congress into session and conferring with that organiza
tion. We believe the country is behind President Wilson
Any measure he may take for the protection of American
rights and American lives rouses in us a spirit of right
which rises with patriotism. Least of all does the Pres
ident desire war with any country. He is in a position
to know of the horrors of war. His information is ac
curate and, fin taking any step, he is, undoubtedly, well
advised in advance of its possibilities.
Wc hope that Congress will not hud occasion to divide
on the question of an "armed neutrality". When Ameri
can lives and American shipping are endangered by an
internationally-illegal agency of a , belligerent, uaiiou
then a neutral must take a lceilcil .st;inl. We hove taken
cur stand. But it is merely a paper stand. Realizing
what "scraps of paper" amount to when Germany is con
cerned, it would be most advisable to back up our
"scraps of paper" with 'some tangible evidence of our
iutent-
over whom Germany exerts no authority supervise the
worn. The Belgians are powerless in case the German
at my of occ upation sees fit to take the supplies for it
own use.
Whatever happens, this great philanthropic enterprise
must go on. T.'ie 10.000,000 Belgians and French who
are dependent on the charity of the outside world must
not be left to starve. The first essential is that there
shall be a new Belgian relief commission in which all
parties concerned will have confidence. Germany owes
it to, the civilized world to place no obstacles in the way.
When such a bedy is established, there should be an out
pouring of gifts on a more liberal scale than ever before,
because they will be needed worse. Americans particu
larly, who Jiave been strangely parsimonious so far in
their attitude toward Belgium, ought to open their hcaru
and purses.
There should be no hesitation cr interruption now, Ijc
au:e of the difficult situation. The money and food will
be carried to the Belgians somehow, if it has to be car
ried in warships.

THE WAR REFERENDUM.
The demand for a national referendum on the question
of war with Germany seems to be what a New York
paper calls it, 'the expiring gasp of German propaganda
in the United States." The men and women most prom
inent in pressing the demand are apparently honest
pacifists, but the moral and financial support back of the
movement is said to be largely German.
This, it must be admitted, is one of the least object
ionable forms that the German propaganda has taken. It
is not illegal. Perhaps it cannot even be called un
American. It ma'ies its appeal through a distinctly
popular principle of American politics. And yet this
movement stands Recused of insincerity and absurdity.
Ours is a government of the people, by the people, for
the people, but it is not a government by universal
referendum, and never can be. The people have given
into the hands of congress the power to make war. There
is no constitutional authority to submit a war decision to
the people.
There is no legsl or moral reason why an unofRrir.I
referendum may not be .'ie!d, for the information of con
gress. But neither is there any reason to think that con
gress needs such advice on this subject. The congress
men know what the country thinks. They know what
their constituents -vant. They haven't had their eyes and
tars shut fcr th last two years.
The referendum in question is unnecessary. And it is
mischievous, because it is calculated to bring delay and
confusion into a situation where clearness and readiness
for prompt action are necessary to protect our vital in
terests and honor.

Tucson business men at the recent
meeting of the luncheon club, coin
posed of the progressive business men

parking space for automobiles. This
will remove the congestion of the
down town district and lessen much
of the immediate traffic in the center
of town. The Old Puebla has not the

Plans for the erection of a large

IS IT FAREWELL TO THE COMICS?
The Victoria Colonist is rejoicing because the "alleged
comic supplements and the supposedly comic features
which characterize very many newspapers in ' America"
are disappearing. TJie Victoria paper believes they can
not disappear too soon. While granting that the comics
possessed some slight element of freshness and origin
ality in their beginnings, the Colonist maintains thnt
they very soon became dreary and vulgar.
The Colonist is quite right about the dreariness and
vulgarity of most of the comic supplement stuff. It is to
be hoped that it is right also about the approaching dis
appearance of this type from the papers of the country.
Probably it Is true that the comics, having reached tba
top notch of popularity and inanity, will have to decline
and that they have already begun to do so. A few ad
dicts to the comic section habit will miss them at first.
Such people console themselves with the antics of the
hero of the hour, Charlie Chaplin. But the rest of us will
I'avc no regrets. Wc will accustom ourselves to the loss
with astonishing ease and rapidity. It is likely, too, that
our children will not laugh and be merry the less for this

WASHINGTON. Feb. 27. General
legislation in the senate made practi
cally no progress today and the pi"a-

I measures will fail to pass before March
I , wi.en tae present congress dies by
limitation, was greater by twenty four
nours. For most of the six hours of
the session the senate talked about
the revenue bill on whicn it already
aas agreed to Vote tomorrow night.
Naval Bill Cmsidered.
The only other important bin that
got even a glance from the senators
was the $535,000,000 naval appropria
tion bill, which was taken up for a
brief time' but to which Senator Lafol
ette showed his opposition. The army
appropriation bill still rested In the
military affairs committee tonicht and
the sundry civil and the deficiency
measures have not even been sent
over from the house.
May Force Extra Session.
These indications lead many sena
tors to believe that President Wilson
will find some of the great govern
ments unprovided for March 5 and
that he will be forced to call an ertra
session to give them funds.
There is every possibility that the
senate will sit all night tomorrow and
that it will spend most of the remain
ing four days and a halt in continuous
session.
Fear for Bills.
Hopes senators may have had for
legislation other than the appropria
tion bills and the measure authorizing
the President to protect American
shipping hare Rone glimmering and
even old timers who have seen the
senate put through eight appropria
tion bills In one day are far from con
fident that it will finish the essential

HOW TO STOP WAR.
A St. Louis pacifist named Charles Lomax Delbridg"
has a simple and practical plan fcr abolishing warfare.
Anybody can learn how to achive this desirable result
by paying a nickel for one of Mr. Delbridge's pamphlets.
And somebody who lias invested a nickel passes the in
formation along for nothing. Here it is.
You simply buy off the enemy at $1,000 per head. For
example, if the United States should be invaded by u
hostile army, the idea would be to pay that bum to every
enemy soldier who deserts or gets captured. Along with
the Sl.'J'in bonus he would be given friendy treatment
and invited to make himself at home. Mr. Dclbridge is
positive that with such a reception every invader would
throw down his guu and rus.'i into our hospitable arms.
"I know liuuiau nature," he says. "There is not an
army or a navy ou earth today that could be held together
iu the face of such a reward." .
And the bloodless victory would bo absurdly cheap. Ho
has figured out that in the present European war it cosU
$37,000 for every enemy killsI. We should therefore
save $j,000 per enemy.
The: beauty of the plan, .however, lies not so much iu
its economy as in its ultimate effect ou world peace. T!e
enemy, ubscrtiug the lure of the $1,000, would probably
offer a t;imllur reward. Tlw-u the rb.-il forces would melt
a way. the lighters of each lountry would teud to settle
noun pe:jci fully iu Hie otb'T country, tb hostile race.,
wculd amalgamate, uud there would be nothing left to
make war about.
It's just as easy as that--and all for a nickel! Take it
tor what it's worth. ' ' 1

"It Pays fj Advertise" really needs

It is not a high-brow play. It is just

Constipation, or iuaction of the
bowels, a condition that nearly every
one experiences with more or less fre
quency, is the direct cause of much
disease. When the bowels become
clogged with refuse fi'oiu the stomach,
foul gases and poisons are generated,
and unless the congestion is quickly
relieved the system becomes weak
ened and most suceptible to attick.
Various remedies to reljpve constipa
tion are prescribed, but many of these
contain cathartic or purgative ai:cnt?
that are harsh and V iolent in their ac
tion and slrt)ck the system. The tnost
effective remedy is the combination
of simple laxative herbs with pepsin

Warren District. alt!irugh known
elsewhere as a "man's carp," has
"really the most lovely little pink-1

will be seen at this show, according j
to the show's promoters. Their smiles '
their limpid eyes, rosy cheeks, pro
fuse cutis. rusical voices and their
comely chubbiness, all wi'l count in
this sfiow, and a fine bronze medal ,
will be given the mother of the most
perfect youngster.
Then e?ch child will get a diploma
showing its markings, including those
en the disposition, teeih. chest, and
other possessions of the supremely
healthy baby. !
Beauty is to be of minor import- j
ance in this contest, which is aimed
'Irst of all merely to inspire better
nnd perhaps more intelligent effort in
the 'fare of the baby, jiot in the per
fection of the pretty type.
Out of all this exhibition will doubt-
'rss come invaluable suggestions on
the rearing of babies, to obtain the
Mghest efficiency, such as the num-!
ter of times daily to bathe the baby, j
the amount of meat he should eat, the
need of abstinence from stimulants
such as tobacco and drinks of all
kinds except water. It is generally
conceded among bachelor circles that
the ideal baby should drink at least
five gallons of water after every meal
never smoke before breakfast and
read nothing but Robert Browning.
Then he will be such au irresista- ;
ble and charming and rohust little
taby that even the politicians will
find it impossible to icsist kissing
him. At any rate, Bisbee is going to I
have a real live baby show and it is
hoped that not a single baby in the
District will be denied the joy of par- I
ticipatin? in this festive occasion.

2 or 3 drops of "Get3-It" on the corn

There's no other corn-remover in
the world that acts like "(lets-It." No

Don't forget that fact. "Gets-It" does
away forever with the use tf salves

In the last issue ot our COPPER AND GOLD LETTER we pre
dicted a sharp advance in Arizona Ray shares. WE WERE RIGHT!!
The stock has advanced 4c during the last three days, one of which
was a holiday. .
The allotment to cover our special offering of 11' 2e was over
subscribed within twenty-four hours after our COPPER AND GOLD
LETTER was mailed. We were obliged to return a number of unfilled
orders while other orders which read "at the market" we wer able to
fill at prices ranging from 12c to IS'e.
RAY CONSOLIDATED has advanced to $27.00. while RAY HER
CULES remains firm at $4.25. Both of these properties join and par
tially surround the property of the ARIZONA RAY COPPER COM
PANY. The LOS ANGELES TIMES of February 22nd says:
"Development work on the Arizona Ray properties is being pushed
with all possible speed, and the officials of the corporation state that
they expect to make an important announcement within a short space
of time." -
If the Company has an important announcement to make they have
not given it to us up to the time of this issue going to press. That in.
riders have "something up their sleeve." is generally rumored bctn
here and in Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Exchanges in which
cities report a growing activity in Arizona Ray shares.
ARIZONA RAY today is by far the best speculative issue being
traded in among the Arizona Copper stocks.
The location of the property is ideal. The property is being vigor
ously developed under the direction of Rred E. Young. E. M one of
Arizona's really successful mining men. That the shares will eventu
ally sell at much higher levels is universally predicted by shrewd
traders.
We have withdrawn offerings of Pool Rights entirely and have dis
continued the sale of same in all of our various offices and are at this
time putting all the pressure at our disposal behini an aggressive cam
paign on the remaining treasury shares under our contract ON AN
ADVANCED MARKET.
To enable us to give those who have been following this issue a
final opportunity to purchase the shares at their present low level, in
fact, AT A DISCOUNT OF 25 PER CENT FROM THE PRESENT
LEVEL, we are going to make this SPECIAL OFFER TO THOSE
WHO ARE WILLING TO HOLD THEIR STOCK FOR SIXTY DAYS

Plan in 1000 share lots for Arizona Ray. REGULAR STOCK (NOT
POOL RIGHTS) at 12c per share providing the holder will sign an
agreement not to dispose of or transfer his stock for sixty days
from date. Thus, stock purchased under this offer, which holds
good only until our present allotment is exhausted, will be released
on April 23rd. This should not be confused in anyway with Pool
Rights, the stock held under which, is pooled for an indefinite
period.
We know Arizona Ray, and we believe in it. We want to be able
at some time in the near future to say. "I told you so," both to the wise
investor who has purchased the shares and to the "Doubting Thomas"
who still hesitates.

RAIDED CLEAR INTO THAMES
BERLIN. (Monday) bv wireless to
Sayville. Feb. 27 The official German
announcement of the raid of German
torpedo boat destroyers on the Kent
ish coast Vf England, on the night of

A Hint to the Aged.
If people past sixty years of age
could be persuaded to go to bed as
soon as they take cold and remain In
bed for one or two days, they would
recover much more quickly, especially
if they take Chamberlain's Cough
Remedy. There would also be less
danger of the cold being followed. by
any of the more serious diseases.

Tells how to take soreness
from a corn and lift it
right out
Hospital records show that every '
time you cut a corn you invite lock
jaw or blood poison, which is needless,
says a Cincinnati authority, who tells
you that a quarter ounce of a drug
called freezone can be obtained at lit
tle Cost from the drug store but is
sufficient to rid one's feet of every
nard or soft corn or callus.
You simply apply a few drops of
this on a tender, aching corn and the
soreness is instantly relieved. Short
ly the entire corn can be lifted out,
root and all. without pain.
This drug is sticky but dries at'juce
and is claimed to just shrivel up any
corn without inflaming 'or even irri
tating the surrounding tissue or skin.
If your wife wears high heels she
will be glad to know of this.
