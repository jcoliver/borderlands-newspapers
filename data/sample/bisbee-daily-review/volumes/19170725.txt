by eliminating the two principals

board and Major-General Geo. W.

The resignation of General Goethals,

and Mr. Denman was asked by the
president to follow suit, that the gov-j

forward without embarrassment. i
Edward N. Hurley of Chicago, for-1

Officers'of the Cloud City union, af
filiated with the International Union
Of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers,
said tonight they could not make any
announcement as to the attitude of
their union regarding the acceptance
of the mediators appointed by Govern
or Gunter until it had been formally
presented to the union and had been
considered bv the members in meet-
of; ing.. They said, however, that the In

tion of labor and the American Feder-
; ation of Labor had, agreed to leave the
settlement of the strike to the loca!
union, offering it their support in every
way possible.
Ask Wage Raise Only
Regarding the position taken by the
operators that they would not official
ly recognize the international union or
Charles Moyer as its president in deal
ing with the Leadville miners, Albert
Carpenter, president of the local min
ers' union, said:
"We have not asked for a recogni
tion of our union in the demands made
upon the Operators. We waived that
point and that should not be a stumb
ling block in the way of an agreement
ieaeral mediators at Denver that we
only waived the recognition of our own
union but of any union. What we
want is an increase in pay and that
was what we struck for and there were
no other conditions except that the in
crease should be retro-active from
June 15, when the demand was made.

After reviewing the history of the;

bring about a meeting between the
operators and miners at Denver, the
statement denied that the present sit
uation in the Leadville district wasj
brought about by "imported agitators" !
and said that the men in charge of the
strike had homes and families here.
The statement questioned the logic of

Among Soldiers Spreads
j Despite Keretisky's Orders.
Notwithstanding the threat of Pre
mier Kerensky that a policy of "blood
brilliant gains they had achieved un
der his personal leadership early in
the month, the Russians continue their
retirement, virtually, pell mell before
i the German and Austro-Hungarian ar-
anywhere making an attempt to hold
back the on-coming enemy.
Already the losses of the Russians
in men killed, wounded or made pris
oners and in guns and stores captur
ed are extremely heavy and these un
doubtedly will become greater unless
the hoped-for stiffening in the morale
of the Russians is realized soon.
Tarnopole Menaced.
Stanislau, the important grain and
manufacturing center, is being evacu
ated by . the Russians while Podhay
tse, Halicz and other towns have been
taken by the Teutons. Tarnopol is
more seriously menaced than ever, if
it has not already been retaken.
The entire eastern front from the
Baltic to the Black Sea is the scene
of dangerous operations, with the Rus
sians standing firmly in the Rumanian
theatre.
The Russians near Dvinsk and Vil
na continue to show signs of disaffec
tion. Although they had attacked and
captured German positions along the
.Dvinskj-Vllna railway, the Ruibians
could not be induced to press their ad
vantage, and retreated to their old po
sition. In the repulse near Krevo,
which was re-captured, and south of
Smorgon, the Germans cut entire reg
iments to pieces with their galling Are
of the infantry and machine guns. (
Important Bases Taken.
General Petain's forces have assum
ed the initiative along the Chemln des
Dames in France, and have taken
back the small advantage gained by
I the enemy during his (weeks of tena-
clous assault. The lost ground on the
i Californie and Casemates plateaus all
has been recaptured and the French,
in spite of vicious counteF-attijeka,
have even pushed their line forward
at several points in the latter region.

ithe British official communication as
yet has only barely mentioned the
fact that the big guns are hammering
away, the probability is that General
Haig is preparing for another of his
. great drives, similar to those made on
Arras and Lens fronts, which worked
great havoc on the Germans and gave
the British forces bases of important
strategic value from whence to con
tinue their operations.

Bisbee's start in the formation of
organizations which have as their ob
ject the unification of the citizenry of
the Warren district, to the end that the
United States may not be hampered
in the present undertaking war has
taken firm root and a statewide Organ
ization along the same lines promises
to be the result. This was ascertain
ed yesterday afternoon when it be
came known that the local leagues and
the Globe Loyalty league were work
ing to that end.
When the strike started in Bisbee
the Workmen's Loyalty league, com
posed of loyal American citizens who
believed that America's Industrial ac
tivities should not be hampered in the
slightest extent, was organized. The
Citizens' Protective league was resur
rected and the two organizations have
been working together since that time.

WASHINGTON, July 24. Plans
the selective draft.
Secretary McAuOo, at a special
I meeting of the senate finance comruit
! tee, revealed that the war department
alone is preparing estimates to cover
additional expenditures of nearly-$3,-000,000,000
and asked the committee
to hold up the $1,670,000,000 war tax
bill until the detailed estimates of all
departments are submitted. The com
mittee agreed to the request and pigeon-holed
a report On the measure,
which it had planned to submit dur
ing the day.
Tax Levy to Be Raised
The new estimates, including $500.
000.000 additional for the shipping
board and $100,000,000 for the navy
department, are to be subni'tted to the
committee late this week. Then there
will begin another revision of the war
revenue measure, probably resulting
in an increase Of the bill's gross tax
levy from $350,000,000 to $1,500,000.
000. Further credits may also be auth
orized in the form of bonds or indebt
edness certificates.
Besides the additional sums needed
for the American war program. Secre
tary McAdoo told the senate commit
tee that the $3,000,000,000 authorized
for roan to the allies probably will last
only until October and that $2,000,000
for their further assistance will be
needed. Provision for this, however,
is not planned in connection with the
present revenue legislation. It prob
ably will be considered at the next
session.
The secretary made no recommenda
tion as to what part of the total should
be raised by taxes and what part by
bond issues or other credits. It was
reported,, however, that the treasury
department would favor raising $1.
000,000,000 more than had been plan
ned in taxes, making the tax bill total
$2,670,000,000.
New Estimates Asked
As to the tax sources to be tapped
to meet the new estimates, the first
disposition of the committee was to
turn to new taxes on war excess profits
and incomes. A meeting will be held
immediately after the new estimates
are submitted.
A resolution was adopted today
calling or submission of new estimates
by all departments, so that the whole
war expenditure program might be
called in connection with the Impend
ing war tax legislation.
The so-called $5,000,000,000 war
army Increases, the secretary said, are
largely to provide for the second draft
i army ot 500.000 to be called while the
first 500,000 are under training. The
$5,000,000,000 would provide tor expen
ditures until July 1. 1918.
During today's debate on the rivers
and harbors bill, Senator Smoot pre
sented statistics to show the appro
priations ot the war session already
aggregate $9,226,000,000 so that the
new estimates would raise the total
tor the first year of the war well
above $14,000,000,000.

Figures Given Out by Tax
Commission Show Over
$200,000,000 Increase Over
the Past Year.
An increase of approximately $200,
000.00 in the assessed valuation of
Arizona property, real and personal,
was noted in 1917 as compared with
1916, according to the report by coun
ties as made public yesterday by
members of the state tax commission.
The total assessed valuation for this
year of f 686,236,51S.6S, as compared i
with $6S6.236.581.6S in 1916. an in
crease of almost 30 per cent. The
figures for this year, however, are sub
ject to change by the state board o!
equalization.
This remarkable increase indicates.
It is stated, not only added person al
wealth but a substantial Increase i::
the real estate wealth o the state.
The greatest increase noted in any
classification was in the mine assess
ments. Under this classification, the
increase totaled approximately $163,
000,000, it is said, of which part ap
proximately $50,000,000 was on prop
erty owned and controlled by the In
spiration Consolidated Copper com
pany. A substantial increase was also .not
ed in assessments on cattle. The cat
tle valuation for the state this year
is about $3,000,000 greater than in
1916. This increase is a result of a
greater cattle census this year than
last rather than an increase In valu
ation of cattle.
The greatest Increase noted in any
one county was in Gila, where the to
tal for this year is $142 633,706.35.
This is an increase of $62,800,000 over
1916, mostly due to added valuation
of mining property.
The remainder of the increase was
about evenly divided over the other
counties of the state.
The assessed valuation for the four
teen counties of the state is as fol

UP FROM DOUGLAS.
Assistant County Attorney IJruee
Stephenson was in the city yesterday
from Douglas on business connected
with bis official position. He states
that a charge of murder will now be
placed against the Taiterson woman
who was held on a charge of Shoot
ing Chas. Irby on thP train a few
nights ago. Irby died from the ef
fects of his wounds on Monday afternoon.
leased in the near future as the case
would be tried before a prize court.
More humiliating was the announce
ment that the Norwegian crew now
would be brought before German court
martial because they, according to or
ders from a Norwegian naval officer in
Norwegian waters, had hoisted the
Norwegian flag.
For the firbt time since the war
broke out a friction, with one of the
belligerent nations has been discussed
openly in the legislature. In other
cases the minister of foreign affairs
has kept everything secert and been
unwilling to let the public know what
steps the Norwegian government has
taken to protect the rights of their
citizens against the now numberless
encroachments from German side.
Press Demands Action
All the leading politicians, in very
strong terms, condemned this last hu-u.I-r.tion
from the German govern
ment i
The press requested that the Norwe
gian crew at once be given their lib

was no prospect of the ship being re-!struck aghast that this crime against
the country should not be punished
more severely. The Germans involv
ed were acquitted. '
' Of the Norwegians Involved, two
were captains on route steamers be
tween Newcastle and Bergan, who had
been paid to report to the German
espionage control in Bergen everything
they saw in England and on their way
between England and Norway.
Spies Overrun Norway
The espionage control was estab
lished, it is charged, by the Antarctic
explorer. Lieutenant Flichner, who.
before the war, had been very kindly
received everywhere In Norway, and
been the guest of the Geographical so
ciety, draw Norwegian men In his net
and make them traitors to tneir own
country. The whole press condemned
Flichner. The whole nation felt ash
amed and dishonored by this case, re
membering the way the Swedish Bar
on von Rosen, with his anthrax and
glanders bacilli in sugar, was treated
by Norwegian authorities and the
way a German proved spy, Baumoister.
also was allowed peacefully to go
back to Germany.
In the legislature it was strongly de
manded that the police authorities
and the department of justice, here
after, should see that the nation was
ridden of such German pests.
And in spite of all this, in spite of
the nearly unanimous demand to stop
export of anything the country needs
for IU own. citizens, the fish exp'Jrt to
Germany still is going on and the
export of home made farm products
and canned milk is not stopped, al
though the prospects for the people in
the coming fall and winter are worse
than ever.
Millions Wasted
Why the government which week
after week suffers humiliations at the
hands of the Germans, has not stopped
all export on Germany until satisfac
tion is 'given. Is regarded here as a
mystery. A great many anti-Socialists
agree with "the Socialists who cri
ticize the government for having spent
$100,000,000 in three years on the neu
trality guard. The Socialists say ii
would have been better to use this
money to relieve the high cost of liv
ing, asserting that the naval and army
defense is in too poor a condition to
be of any use and that the money is
wasted. Other citizens who believe
in armament for the defense of the
country now ask, with the Socialists,
what the country has obtained for the
$100,000,000. They indignantly declare
that more than 400 Norwegian vessels
have been destroyed, with the loss of
500 sailors, by the acts of a so-called
"friendly" nation, that no excuse nor
satisfaction has been given for any
of the numerous violations of the inter
national law; that Norwegian sailors
have been murdered In the life boats;
money and private trinkets on board
Norwegian ships stolen by German of
ficers and taken to Germany; Norweg
ian government vessels In coast traf
fic in Norwegian waters seized and
taken as prizes to German ports, and
that not a shot has been fired from a
Norwegian gun to defend Norwegian
rights, not a Norwegian boat nor a
Norwegian sailor has Decn allowed to
fight for his life. Meantime, they add.
the country which has spent $100,000.
000, is threatened by famine of food
and fuel during the coming winter.
Delbert Perry Contracts Tu
berculosis on European
Continent Worked in Bis
bee Until Fall of 1914.
Delbert Perry, former Bisbee boy.
has returned to this region of the
country to die He was taken, yester
day, to the home of his parents at
Lewis Spring, a hopeless victim of tu
berculosis, contracted while serving
with the Canadian expeditionary forc
es in France.
Perry is well known in the Warren
District Until the latter part of 1914
he was employed at the J. M. Ball
drug store. He became interested in
the Mexican revolutions about that
time and joined the forces of Gener
al Benjamin Hill, the Carranza com
mander who defended Naco, In the
fall of 1914, against theonslaughts of
Jose Maytorena and his Yaqui hosts.
After his campaign with Hill, Perry
went to Canada and enlisted with the
Canadian oversea forces. He went to
England and then to France and serv
ed for many months there.
At last he contracted tuberculosis
and was invalided back to Canada and
thence to his home in Arizona. The
physisians say he has a short time
to live.
Undoubtedly Perry feels that he has
lived long and seen much already.
WENT TO ST. DAVID.
Quite a number of the residents of
the Warren District went to St. David
yesterday to attend the Pioneer's Day
celebration. Quite an interesting time
was had. There were all kinds of out
door sports, a ball game between Ben
son and St. David, and the celebration
concluded with a grand ball. Those
who attended report having had a
most enjoyable time.

THE BOOT ON THE OTHER FOOT.
Since its inception the time honored tactics of the
L W. in time of a strike, have been to establish a
picket line and seek by jeers and threats and violence to
drive loyal workmen from their mines or shops or fac
tories. And if they could not get strike-breakers to Join
them they always tried to run them out of town.
For the first time in their long career of outlawry
and crime these drivers have been driven. Bisbee placed
the boot on the other foot And it hurt. It hurt so badly
that the wobblies yelled, and they are yelling still, and
certain of their sympathizers are yelling also.
But really, the Bisbee deportation was simply a case
of beating the deporters to it with this difference, how
ever, the loafers instead of the workers, were driven
away. The trouble-makers got into trouble. The Idlers
wb.o have for many long years been allowed to pour with
a free hand bitter medicine for workers, were forced to
take their own medicine. They do not like It. Of course
not. It is wormwood and gall.
History shows thousands of cases of how rufflers,
and loafers and agitators and roysterers and knaves and
thieves and winebibblers and masterless men have held
high carnival and riot In communities to the annoyance,
pain and loss of all honest men. And then when all
human patience had been completely exhausted, the citi
zens had arisen in their might and either imprisoned,
hung or driven away the scum that polluted their midst.
The patience of working men and merchants is
proverbial. Beasts of prey have fattened upon this prin
ciple ever since the days of the parasites of Phoenicia.
The industrious man will yield three-fourths of the
Btreets he has himself builded rather than to have trou
ble with the professional troublemaker. But when he
does turn his band to war the man of industry always
routs the idler and bully, foot, horse and guns.
In the western portion of this country the indus
trious men are banding together with blood in their eys
and they are after the professional loafer and trouble
maker. And they will set them, too. The days of the
propagandist are numbered. He has pushed patience too
far. His effrontery and his impudence and his brazen
stoppage of useful labor finally went too far. His foot
crossed the dey.d line.
All reputable and conservative labor unions have
condemned the wobbly even while they saw him using
and abusing their own tactics on strike. They have drawn
away from him and their leaders are fighting him and his
evil ways. But some few of them, notably J. L Donelly,
president of the American Federation of Labor for this
state, are actually lining up with him, check by jowl, and
seeking to draw their followers down to share his ruin.
An idea of how metropolitan - papers from outside
the state view the recent actions and antics of Donelly
cn behalf of his I. W. W. friends, deported to Columbus
for acts of anarchy, may be gained from the following
editorial in the Los Angeles Times:
"Organized labor In Arizona Just now appears to be
in a devil of a fix. It appreciates that the L. W. W. is a
force that is disrupting the unions and yet it likes the
work the I. W. W. has been doing In trying to smash
the stubborn corporations that have refused to accept
union control in the past. Arizona unionism is on the
iloor, so to speak, bumped in trying to occupy two stools.
Its federation boss has taken sides to the extent of de
manding that Gov. Campbell insist on return of the I. W.
W. to Bisbee. Possibly, while filled with indignation nn
this subject, possibly also filled with something else,
this boss aforesaid has just been jailed in Phoenix,
charged with assault with a deadly weapon on a young
man who had joined the Loyalty league. All of this de
spite the dignity of his position as head of organized
labor in the state, in which, we believe, he Is as well
chairman of the labor committee of the State Council
of Defense."
"A soldier dead at Douglas," read the headlines, but
it was love, nor war, that killed him . He hung himself in
his tent, and his comrades declare that he had been de
spondent for some time because of an unfortunate love
affair. According to the authorities war runs a bad third
in the' list of slayers. I he poets are agreed that love Ih
first, although Shakespeare declared that ambition
"caused more tears than wars or women have." Be that
as it may, love and ambition run one, two in the matter
of deaths to answer for, and theu comes dreadful war.
KERENSKY'S TASK.
.The labors of Hercules, all combined, were easy com
pared to the task that Kerensky, the young Russian pa
triot, has been set to perform. He has civil duties that
would overwhelm an ordinary statesman. Besides his war
portfolio, he has just been made dictator of an empire
larger than these United States. On the heels of this
great responsibility he has been called to .the front to
sustain the shaking Russian battle line.
Many men have led forlorn hopes to victory before.
Cromwell moulded English brewers and wagon makers
and clerks into an invincible army and beat the cavaliers
trained to war from their youth up. but he had brave
men for material. Napoleon inspired the ragged, half
starved, ill-armed patriotis of the French revolution to
beat the best armies of Europe, but his battalions were
composed of men of flaming ardor. Washington won the
war of freedom In our own country against odds, but his
continentals were the very flower of exalted manhood.
Kerensky's task is harder by far than the miracles
performed by the three immortals named above. It is
harder because of the material with which he has to do.
He must deal not alone with stupidity and ignorance, but
with cowardice as welL The French, always brave, be
came braver still when they threw off the yoke of the
Bourbons. But these Russians, always brave if not good
soldiers, lost their courage when they gained their liberty.
They evidently never had any pride to lose. They are
like cattle loosed in a field of corn, for they will gorge
themselves with freedom until they die of it.
The great soldiers of history always had brave
armies. But this pale faced patriot with the burning eyes
must win with weak, cowardly, rebellious armies. His
soldiers are not only undisciplined but they are afraid.
They will fight the Austrians bravely enough, but the
sight of a German spiked helmet throws them into a cold
sweat of terror. They fire their guns at the new moon
and run like men. 1
Kerensky's (laming spirit impelled the Russian arm
ies forward on the recent successful offensive and then
these miserable men turned tall and ran before their own
success. There is nothing In history to compare to such
cowardice. The most timid of soldiers will fight when
they are winning. But these Russian sheep trembled
even as they went forward. Not all of them, be it un
derstood, but enough to lese all they bad gained and Im
peril the allied cause on the eastern front.
Can this shepherd lead these sheep back into the
scorching fire of battle? Can he inspire them again?.
Not 6ince Joan of Arc turned back the tide of the Hun
dred Years' war and led the beaten French to victory
over the invincible English has such a task been set to
mortal bands.
If Kerensky can stiffen the Russian front and start
another successful offensive we have a chance to beat
the Prussians back to the Rhine this year. If he fails,
then must two million American soldiers at the least
enter the terrible maw of the western battle front before
the Huns can be forced to give way.
With anarchy in' the cities and mutiny in the armies
and ignorance and depravity everywhere, this young dic
tator must perform, not one, but many miracles, before he
can save his country a worse slavery than any It ever
knew under the czars.
Whatever may be said for or against the Socialists
in time of peace by their enemies and their friends, all
good citizens will agree that the Socialist is close kin
to a traitor in time of war. Dispatches from the Russian
battlefronts declare that "refusal of the troops to fight a
force much inferior in numerical strength is laid in the
official reports to mutiny started by radical Socialists."
This is a terrible indictment of Socialism throughout the
world. Pretending to fight for freedom, these gentry
would destroy Russia as soon as she. has gained her free
dom. By what species f hallucination can they argue
that the rule of the kaiser will be any improvemept over
that of the czar? The kaiser is the stronger of the two,
and therefore he must certainly have the heavier hand.
To strike at any organized form of government, whether
it be monarchy or republican, seems to be the Socialist's
creed. By his side in this country, since war has been
declared, can be found only the traitor, the Prusisan spy,
the outlaw and the L W. W. horde. All of them hate
work; all love to talk; and all of them should be in
terned together.
Having appealed to the farmer to plant more vege
tables and grain, and to the worker to rally to the shop
and factory, and to the young man to enlist, and to the
housewive to save, and to all men to give, the publicists
are now asking the landlord to cut down his rent. This
last request is sure to gain more applause. than all the
others that have gone before. To win the war rents must
come down. At last they have the right idea. They argue
that food is high because it is bought and sold and de
livered from expensive assembling and distributing places.
The retailer and the wholesaler and the distributor have
to pay too much rent. So does the consumer. Cut rents
and win the war!
El Paso is all swelled up because a moving picture
concern has ptiched its tents on the townsite. War news
and film news now struggle for supremacy upon the front
pages of the city's newspapers. The dreamy eyed girls
and the boys with pinch back coats are all eager for a
tryout before the camera's eye. Los Angeles is on the
ropes. The border city has come Into its own. Congratulations.
MRS CHAS PEDEN
GAINS27 POUNDS
Twice Examined and Each
Time Told Operation Was
Only Hope.
"I have just finished my third bot
tle of Tanlac and uave gained 27
pounds," was the truly remarkablt
statement made by Mrs. Chas. Peden,
residing at 550 Mill street, Huntsville,
Ala. Mrs. Peden is one of the best
known and highly respected women of
that thriving little city, where she has
made her home for a number of years.
"When I commenced taking tht
medicine," she continued. "I oniy
weighed 98 pounds; now I weigh 125
pounds and never felt better In my
life. For years I have suffered with
a bad form of stomach trouble, consti
pation and pains in my side and back.
At times the pains took the form of
torture and I was twice examined and
each time I was Did that I bad appen
dicitis and that an operation would be
my only hope. I had fallen off until
I only weighed 98 pounds and was so
weak I could hardly get around.
"I had no appetite at all scarcely,
and what little I did eat would cause
gas to form in my stomach, which
gave me palpitation of the heart, sick
headaches and a dizzy feeling about
the head. When the spells came on
I would get awfully nervous. I wor
ried about myself until I could rest
and sleep but little.
"I had fallen off until I was almost
skin and bones and my strength and
energy were slowly leaving me. I had
a dread 'of the future and could see
nothing but the operating table and
the knife. I had a perfect horror of
an operation, but I bad made up my
mind that it was either life or death
and prepared to submit to it. I had
made all preparations tor the operation
and called on my sister to tell her
good-bye, as I did not know whether
I would live to see her again or not.
My sister begged and plead with me
not to allow thenl to cut on me and
told me tv wait and try a good tonic
for a while. The next day, as I re
turned from the consultation room, I
thought of what she said and as I
had heard so much about Tanlac I de
cided to try it as a last resort, and
stopped at 'Gilbert's Drug Store and
bought a bottle. Of course I had lost
heart and had no faith in the medi
cine,. but to please my sister I made
up my mind to take it, and oh, what
a happy day that was for me!
"I never returned for the operation.
but just kept taking the Tanlac. Right
from the start I began to feel better.
The medicine seemed to take hold
right at once. It had a soothing effect
and in a few days I felt no pain at all.
I, was so happy over the wonderful
improvement in my condition that 1
sent for my neighbors to tell them how
much better I felt. I sent and got an
other bottle of Tanlac and have just
finished taking my third bottle and
feel like I have been made all Over
again into a new woman.
"As I have said before, I now weigh
125 pounds, and my improvement has
been so rapid that none of my clothes
are big enough for me. I will have
to make them all over again. I now
have a ravenous appetite and my bus
band says I am simply eating him out
of house and home. I have even gone
back to my coffee, which I was told
not to touch. Those terrific pains in
my back and head have all disappear
ed and I sleep like a child. I am no
longer nervous and when I get up
mornings I feel refreshed, cheerful and
bright I am now able to attend to
my household duties and I Seel as if I
had started life all over again. My
husband is highly delighted and my
recovery Is the talk of the nelghbor
uood. I do nothing but .rejoice all
day long over the recovery of my
health and praise Tanlac j 10 every
body. "I feel so grateful for my escape
from the operating table and the knire
that you may publish what I have said
you may, if you will, tell other wo
men suffering as I was to come and
see me and I will be glad to tell them
all about my case."

Arizona License
Plate May Solve
Desert Mystery
(By Review Leased Wire).
SAN BERNARDINO. Calif.. July 24.
An Arizona automobile license plate
bearing the number 5.997 was found
today in the sands of the Mojave des
ert near where the body of an uniden
tified man was discovered by automo
bile travelers. The man bad been
shot to death. An abandoned automo
bile, believed to have been the prop
erty of the man killed, was found
twenty miles away. Authorities said
the body was that of a man about
forty years old and that his clothing
was of good material. The pockets
of his suit had been turned out and
there was nothing to aid in identifica
tion except a Denver shop label on his
silk shirt and the license number of
the automobile.

The proposed medal
Representative O'Shaupessy, of
Rhode Island,' has introduced a bill
asking: that two twelve-pound guns
presented to the United States by
Lafayette be molted and made into
medals to reward United States sol
diers who distinguish themselves in
France. The g-uns are of bronze,
hand carved. The proposed meal
would-.rank next to the reeulaiion
meda of honor. Enough irc-ta, for
30,000 medals is contained in the
two puna.

NEW YORK. July 24. Stocks re
sumed their downward course today
on almost the smallest turnover of
any full session thus far ihis summer.
Total dealings barely amounted to
E30.00 shares.
Traders apain aliened themselves
on the bear side, forcing prices to low
est levels in the last hour, the only
active period of the day.
Rails Vere moved to higher levels
for a time on the interstate commerce
commission decision which favored
the western and Pacific Coast carriers,
but soon fell back with the general
list.
Rubles were the only foreiim remit
tances to show my pronounced
chance, repeating their recent low
record of 21 o!the discouraging mili
tary news from Russia. Rumors of nn
early resumption of gold imports from
Canada lacked authoritative confir
mation. Dealings in the bond market, except
for sporadic advances in minor rail
way issues were altogether perfunc
torv with an irregular tone.
Liberty 3's ranged from 99.45 to
99.49. Total sales, fpar value), $2,
925.000. United States old issues were un
changed on call.

CHICAGO, July 24. Brightening

Prices finished easy to 1'4 cents
lower with September 1:63 and De
cember 1.14,.i to 1.14. Decline 5
to8 and closed steady at 2.54 July
and 2.25 September. Oats lost "4
to 2 and provisions 23 to 30 cents.
Expected enlargement of receipts of
wheat here did a good deal to send
values for that cereal down grade.
Oats broke sharply under selling
from a big house which had recently
been a conspicious purchaser.
Weakness of grain pulled down provisions..

NEW YORK. July 24. Realizing by

ing on the reaction theory in the fore
noon gave the market an appearance
of strength, but a subsidence of the
demand from this clement fpund the
market bandly wanting for sustaining
buying power and the market later
declined rather easily on a mod
erate amount of liquidation. The taxation-question
in the late dealings came
in for greater consideration owing to
the publication of a Washington de
spatch which in substance intimated
that an effort will be made to ameud
the war revenue bill for the purpose
of obtaining a still larger revenue,
probably one billion dollars more.
This increases the belief that the im
possible on excess profits will be aug
mented and inasmuch as the bill in its
present form which seems to be rath
er far reaching the fear of an addition
al burden is viewed with much more
concern.
It is therefore to be expected that if
earning power is to be revised down
ward to an appreciable extent that the
prices of the various industrials now
established, on the basis cf present
large earnings, will likewise be ad
justed in a downward manner.

TO BRING SUITS.
Between 15 and 20 suits will be fil
ed by Assistant County Attorney
Bruice Stephenson against estates sit
uated in this county seeking to have
them escheat to the state as soon as

where a person dies without leaving
a will and no heirs can be found
within seven -years after the settle
ment of the estate by the probate
section of the superior court, it shall
escheat to the state, the proceeds go
ing into the public school fund. Mr.
Stephenson, who Is acting as county
attorney during the absence of John
F. Ross, has made a list of estates of
this kind and will file actions against
them, probably today, intending to go
to Tombstone for that purpose.
