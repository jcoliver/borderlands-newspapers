Argentina's Action Invites
Break By Germany. Costa
Rica Wishes To Prove Her
Friendliness To U. S.
WASHINGTON. April 11. Without
formally announcing abandonment of
their neutrality, two more Latin-American
republics, Argentina and Costa
Rica, have given assurances of their
moral support of the Cnited States
against Germany. , r
Argentina, choosing a middle course
between those of Brazil and Chile, has
notified the state department that she
"recognizes the ustjice" of this coun
try's stand against German aggres
sion. The communication contains no
intimation, however, that the Argen
tine authorities contemplate an actu
al break with Berlin.
Costa Rica Would Fight '
Little Costa Rica, just emerging
from the throws of a revolution sent
word to her diplomatic representative
today that she endorsed the course of
President Wilson and "was ready to
prove it if necessary."
Argentina's position was defined in
a note reaching the state department
today in answer to the note of this
government in regard to a state of
war. The communication defining a
status is short of an open break.
Argentina's note follows:
"The Argentine republic in view of
the causes that have prompted the
United States of America to declare
war against the German government
recognizes the justice of that decision
founded as it is upon the violation of
the principle of neutrality established
by the rules of international warfare
which have considered definite con
quests of civilization."
Costa Rica's announcement was un
expected, for the new government set
up there by Federlco Tinoco and per
fected today by an executive declara
tion of bis election as president, has
not been recognized by the I'nited
States.

Staff Army Plan In The
Main However As Most
Desirable.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, April 11. Presi-1
dent Wilson, in a conference with j
Speaker Champ Clark and Minority
Leader Kitchin at the Capitol today,
insisted on the terms of the adminis
tration plan for raising a large army
in the principle of selective draft. At
the same time, however, it was learn
ed that the war department virtually
had decided on plans under which op
portunity will be given for approxi
mately 500,000 mn to volunteer for
service for the term of the war.
The net result of the new plans j
would be to make the total niitional
guard and regular force to be organ
ized first independently of the selec
tive draft plan approximately 750.000
men, making room for the- absorption
of half a million volunteers.
Congress to Act First
No attempt to enlist men to accom
plish this will be made, however, un
til congress has acted and authority
is granted to enlist such volunteers
for the duration of the war only.
The President made it clear that
the army plan had been formulated
only after it had been decided it was
the only way to meet the demand for
a great and efficient fighting force.
Volunteer Plan Popular
Both Speaker Clark and Mr. Kitch
in told the President lhat much op
position existed in congress against
the plan, principally on the ground
that draft should not be resorted to
until an effort had been made to raise
an army through volunteers.
Careful reconsideration of the terms
of the existing national defense act
is responsible for the contemplated
change of the administration's policy
in regard to the mobilization of the
national guard for war. Ogicials now
think the law grants the states the
right to organize additional guard
units up to the full limit of 800 men
to a congressional district. If that
view is sustained by army legal au

cincts which cast majorities for for
mer Governor Hunt, in which it was
alleged that irregularities had been
committed. These precincts are:
Swansea, Yuma county; Drance, Tiraa
county; Piohn ranch, Mohave coun
ty; Bisbee No. 1; one Douglas pre
cinct and one in Miami. Among the
irregularities alleged are the assist
ing of voters by persons other than
the members of the election board,
partisans of Governor Hunt; the ser
vice on the board of a candidate for
office and the service on an election
board of a non-resident of the county.
Campbell's attorneys were given a
week to gather evidence.
On account of the chaotic condition
of the figures it is impossible to state
just how the vote between Hunt and
Campbell now stands. Several dis
puted ballots are yet to be ruled upon
It is estimated that now with the ex
clusion of Snowflake. Hunt has a lead
of between 30 and 40.

WILSON WANTS;
BOETHALS TO i
Will Give Canal Builder Un
limited Authority In Devis
ing Means To Keep Flow of
Food To Allies Unbroken.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 11. Major
General George Goethals, builder of
the Panama Canal, was formally rec
ommended by President Wilson today
to take charge of the building of 1000
wooden ships for foreign commerce.
Increase of overseas tonnage is re
garded as tin imperative need to de
feat the German submarine campaign
and keep up the flov?-iif supplies to
the entente. (Vmsequeutly the great
est importance is attached to the
plans of the shipping board for build
ing wooden ships. The entire re
sources of available, ship building
yards are to be used for the purpose.
The President earnestly hopes that
General Goethals will undertake the
work, and if he does so will be placed
in general charge with unlimited au
thority to organize the building facil
ities. The shipping board has $50,000,000
at its disposal for the construction
and purchase of vessels, and it is es
timated that beginning early in the
autumn ships at the rate of 200,000
tons a month can be turned out.
In 1916 the United States had 500.
000 tons of shipping in the trans-Atlantic
trade. During a meeting of
railroad executives here today the
question was taken np of arranging
for ships of the Great Lakes and in
the coastwise trade to be utilized for
ocean-going commerce. Under such
a plan, to be put into effect when the
railroads can provide facilities to take
the places of the lake and coastwise
shipping it is estimated the present
trans-Atlantic tonnage of the United
States will be doubled and possibly
trebled.
The use of German merchant ships
now in American harbors will add ap
proximately 600.000 tons to the sup
ply of the United States.
Chairman Win. Penman of the ship
ping board discussed the entire ship
ping question with Pdesident Wilson
today. '

WASHINGTON, April 11. As
sembly in Washington within a
few weeks of a great internation
al war council was foreshadowed
by an announcement from the
staTe department today that a
British commission, headed by
Arthur J. Balfour, minister of for
eign affairs, is expected to arrive
within ten days to discuss with
the government here questions
connected with the conduct of the
war. In addition to the foreign
minist'r, the commission will in

This was as far as the an

ed authoritatively that a French
commission also will be in Wash

commission will be headed by M.

justice in the French cabinet and
formerly premier.
It is assumed that owing to the
difficulties in passage and the proba
ble delays the interests of other al
lied governments will be confided to
their resident ambassadors.
No Political Pact
It was made clear that in no way
will the United States government
depart from the traditional policy of
avoiding anything in the nature of
political alliances, though or course
that does not exclude full and inti
mate military and naval cooperation
in the prosecution of the war.
While It is by no means certain
that there will be a joint meeting of
the visiting commissions, if the state
department should desire to avoid the
appearance of an lliance, there is cer
tain to be concert of action in some
way.

submitted today by the resolutions

rialist party should take in the war
between the United States and Ger
many were debated far into the nisht
by the national convention of the par
ty in session here.
The majority report, signed by 11
members of the committee condemn
ed the entrance of the United States
into the European war and said the
action of this country had been insti
gated by "predatory capitalists."
A minority report signed by John
Sparpo praised the patience shown
by the American government, but
urged that this country" could make
the largest contribution to the dvfeat
of Germany by placing the greatest
possible amount of munitions and
food supplies at the disposal of the
allies and Helgium, rather than by
sending an army to Europe.
A second minority report called on
the Socialist party to oppose the war
with all the power at its command.
The majority report report said in
part:
"When Belgium was invaded, the
government enjoined upon the people
of this country the duty of "remaining
neutral, thus clearly demonstrating
that the "dictates of humanity' and
the. fate of small nations and of dem
ocratic relations were matters that
did not concern it. But vhen our
enormous war traffic was seriously

on us to rally to the 'defense of de

Explosion At Chester, Pa.
Munition Plant Was "Dia
bolical Plot of Desperate
Demon."
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHESTER. Pa., April 11. A state
ment today by a high official of the
Eddy stone Ammunition Corporation
placed the blame of yesterday's dis
astrous explosion on a disloyal em
ploye who is thought to have sacri
ficed his life with the 116 known dead,
most of whom were girls and young
women. '
Numerous suspects were arrested
and in each case the disposition of
the prisoners was placed in the hands
of agents of the department of jus
tice. The statement of the company's
responsible representative, who de
clined to permit the use of his name,
said the tragedy "was the result of
a diabolical plot conceived in the de
generate brain of a demon in human
guise." and that the triple explosion
was due to a bomb manufactured from
a shell by one of the employes. The
official refused to disclose details.
Unless the bomb was timed, it was
explained, the plotter must have met
the same fate as the rest of the vic
tims: CnoGieial reports of missing to
day placed the number at 36, but It
is thought many of these will be ac
counted for when the confusion calms
down. Between 60 and "0 injured still
were in hospitals.
The belief that the explosion was
deliberate on the part of a fanatic or
an employe who thought he was doing
a patriotic duty for a foreign nation
is shared by Alba B. Johnson, presi
dent of the Baldwin Locomotive
Works, which owns the buildings oc
cupied by the Eddystone Ammunition
Corporation and Samuel M. Vauclain,
president Of the Eddystone Company.

BLIZZARD SCATTERS
ALASKA DOG RACERS
NOME. Alaska. April 11. Paul J.
Kjeg.stad. one of the drivers of the
112 mile all-Alaska sweep-stakes dog
team race which started from Nome.
Monday morning, was found today sev
en miles from Solomon. Kjeg.stad had
lost his dogs in the -terrific blizzard
which arose soon after the racers left
Solomon. They were all found scat
tered over the tundra. One was dead.
Kjagstad was found by the mail car
rier from Council, which lies fifty-three
miles northeast of SolOinon. which is
in turn 32 miles east of Nome. The
carrier had traversed the route be
tween these two settlements along
which the race was supposed to be
run. without finding any. sign or tli
other drivers. As the course runs cast
along short for a considerable distance
before turning north, it is feared that
the Other teams may have left the
trail, gone out on the ice and been
carrieid to sea. ' It is thought that
dogs and drivers have' taken shelter
in an Eskimo hut mar the tdiorc. Two
men with dog teams have set out in
search for them.
Some think the racers will return
to Noun- and the contest will be start
i a-aln in tcu days.

JCEW VORK, April 11. Although
technical anil basic conditions appear
ed to be unchansed today's stock
market evinced a decided deposition
to throw off its depression. Dull pe
riods were frequent, but activity was
mostly st hiqher levels, especially in
stocks of intrinsic value.
Investment liquidation was asain
observed in the bond list, some rail-,
way issues., also industrials and utili
ties recording substantial concession
on small but steady offerings, with
unusi'al gaps between bid and asked
prices.
' Less pressure was exerted against
munition and equipment stocks.
Unlike the market of recent days,
highest levels with few exceptions,
were attained in the last hour. United
States Steel leading at an extreme
advance of 2 points to 111 with
.,3,4', 4 points for other issues of like
description." ratifies led the rails at
goras of 1 to 3 points. Sales 640.000

Free selling of July and September
wheat was in evidence from the out
set. Notwithstanding the lowering of
.prices for deferred options, millers
and export interests were paying the
highest premiums yet for nearby de
liveries of wheat. European govern
ment buyers offered as much as 26
cents a bushel over May at the Gulf
of Mexico. How long this urgency

largely on length of time which must
elapse before shipments could be
available through the Great Itkes.
( Corn reflected tiie heaviness of July
and Sept'-'Mber whent. Trading lack

spite heavy selling, oats were rela-
tively steady on account of a fair de

OBEY THE LAW; AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
United States Attorney General Thomas W. Gregorr
has considerable humor 'about him. He would make a
good sign writer. His summary of the "don'ts" for aliens,
is remarkable for its brevity and for its sanity.
OBEY THE LAW; KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT.
According to the Attorney General, in a letter of in
struction to the United States Marshals and United
States Attorneys, no alien need have any fear of trouble
in this country, even in the event of the worst of war,
if they maintain the rule, heretofore quoted.
BORDER TOWNS, ATTENTION!
There is some inclination, on the part of some of the
border towns at the present time, to hope and pray and
work to the end that all of the mobilization may be made
along the border. Bisbee has wanted some of this mobil
ization. Douglas, of course, is in for her share and wc
will wager that El Paso is leaving no stone unturned to
secure more than half, the pie. Pertinent to the situ?
tion is ar editorial printed recently in The Chicago Tri
bune, under the title of "Sons and Stepsons."
"The best friends of the volunteer system are tfce
men who make money out of the volunteer soldier. The
volunteer soldier is not only a hero; he is the beet of
business prospects. His needs are elemental, but they
are imperative. His collective buying power is enor
mous. ,
"Texas found that out. Texas was made prosperous
from the mobilization of the national guard regiments
It discovered that exploitation of the troops, was the
easiest way of making money. Its cities fought for the
opportunity to open their arms and their shops to ho
and bunry militiamen. Mobilization meant bank bal
ances.' "There was no public opinion to prevent boosting prices
and prices were' boosted. Prices always are boosted fw
volunteers. Because the boys in 'Austin, Tex, were rot
in the army to any great extent, no one in Austin made
any especial effort to keep prices low. Twenty thou
sand new customers, all wantingthe same things tlutt
is bow the business men regarded the arrival of the
troops. ; ,
"Contractors for supplies have always liked the vol
unteer system for this reason.' From Valley Forge to
the Austin hike troops have been at their merry. Con
cessions for camp grounds, concessions for laundry
agencies on camp grounds,- lunch counter concessions
on camp grounds the possibilities for money making
are enormous. Gen. Grant almost lost his job became
he fought exploitation of the soldiers. Gen. Funston was
made uncomfortable in Texas. He could deliver cus
tomers to any community.
"For the volunteer soldier is not protected by public
opinion. When be is not of his home neighborhood be
is at best only the stepson of the community where he
1r. The conscripted soldier has protection of public
opinion. When every man's son is in the army some
where, public opinion toward the army has a different
texture. Such politicians as have made gains by de
livering customers to merchants will not be popular.
And exploitation of soldiers cannot be stopped except
by making exploiters unpopular."
BISBEE'S POSITION.
Bisbee, the largest and most prosperous mining carup
in the Southwest and in fact in the country with one
possible exception, comes in, at this time, for special
consideration, both from our own people the residents
of the Warren District nd from the government. As
a potential factor for the support of the country, espe
cially in war time, this camp's possibilities have never
been brought to the attention of the general public.
Consequently the need for adequate protection can hard
ly be overestimated.
Ranged with Bisbee. in this instance, is Douglas. The
latter named town, to Bisbee, is what the many rail
road towns in Kansas and their Dour mills arc to the
wheat". 'growing sections of that great iuland empire.
-' IHmglas rs wholly dependent upon IHsbcc aud, to a lrss
extent, Bisbee is upon Douglas.
Munition of war are chiefly made from powder, of
various kinds, and metals. The greatest amount of auy
metal used is steel and next is copper. The amount of
copper w!:!ch '-ia been thrown a'ay in the present
European conflict would be hard to compute. The Ger
mans have made every effort to supplant copper with
other metals. Some authorities would have, us believe
that the failure of the Central countries' arms, at the
present time, ia due to some extent to the failure of
other metals to supplant copper in the manufacture of
munitions.
Bisbee and Douglas are producers of both war and
peace materials are rich, potentially. The copper, pro
duced in those mines, ia used in hundreds of ways. The
peace uses are, of course, greater than the war uses.
Vet all contribute to the general preparedness which the
United States desires at this time.
In view of this conditjbn it would appear that the
government should be taking some active step to protect
the local plants from possible trouble. The companies,
themselves, are taking every precaution possible. The
govrnment has Its secret service agents at work In thit
and, we suppose. In other copper camps In the state
of Arizona. They have under aurveilance every German,
Austrian, Bulgarian, Turk, or other man who fa an alien.
In addition to these people they have many Americans
by birth and by naturalisation under their eyes and are
watching them for some overt action, on which, to bring
them to conrt and to time.
Bisbee is close to the Mexican border. Though there
Is little trouble expected from Sonora or eves from the
entire country of Mexlca, it is always well to be pre
pared for any contingency that may arise at any time

"The European system is a compact of racial ind

To Play Bachelors
Friday Afternoon
The benedicts and bachelors of
the general office of the C. &. A.
will clash for baseball honors at
Waxen Park Friday afternoon.
The game has heen arranged as
an amicable means of settling a
Ion;, standing grudge between the
two tactions. To make the game
interesting, every married man
empi'jyed in the C. &. A. offices is
-said to have gone home last night
and informed his wife that she
must attend the game and cheer
for the benedicts.
Difficulty is being experienced in
finding umpires' for the game,
scores having turned down the
jobs for fear that the fair fans
might not approve of the decisions
and attempt to trounce the um
pires with rolling pine. The com
mittee in charge of preparations
for the game, h'owever, announced
last night that, if necessary, a
squad of police will be called out
to protect the bachelors from the
wives of their opponents in case
the game gets too exciting.

(Special to Review)
TOMBSTONE, April 11. The mem
bers of the board of supervisors,
Vance M. Johnson, chairman, J. M.
Sparks of Douglas and John Rock, of
Tombstone, accompanied by County
Engineer J. C. Ryan of Bisbee. will
leave here next Monday for a tour of :
inspection of the roads of the county.
Th. Kr the rrppnt time has a
number of forces at work on different
roads in the county and the work be
ing done is of the permanent charac
ter and not of the class that was done
before in the county. The board has
the record of being the only one in
the state that has made a success of
running a county road camp and mak
ing a success of it. The cost of
maintaining the present roacf camp
be'wcen here and Bisbee was at a
minimum cost aud the work accom
tlished was as good as was niaintain
?d by t'ie state while they were oper-
fating it. The county stood the ex-
I oense of the ramo up ufttil the fust
of the year on this road but at the
present time the state is bearing the
expense and the county is furnishing
the prisoners.
Excellent Results
There has never b?en less than
twenty five men at work in the carvp
sud the present average is over forty.
Th4 work accomplished crn he seen
by those who have been over the road
Intely. At the present time the force
is at work surfacing the grading that
has already been done, using the old
Bisbee extension dump for the base,
i'ot all the force is engaged in this
woik. a part being used in erecting
the bridges that will be used on the
road between the present camp and
the Government Draw. The road has
been surfaced from the top of the
'. grade leading into Tombstone canyon
to the camp and it will be ready for
use wi'hin the next few aas.
A force of engineers from the coun
ty engineer's office is being used in
making a preliminary survey of the
cost of pavin? the road between Bis
bee and DoujIps so that, when the
question of paving comes up with the
bond issue the estimated cost will be
had. The work is bing done under
state expense but will become a coun
ty charge if the bond issue carries.
Record is Good
A small force is at work on the
road between .Douglas and Rodeo cut
ting down some of the grades and fix
ing the curves in the road. Another
force is working in the Sulphur
Spring Valley, one working on the
road between Willcox and Dos Cabe
zas. another on the cutoff between
Tombstone and Dragoon, another be
tween Tombstone and the county Jine
and another working between Bisbee
and Osborne.
Last year the board spent the sum
of $102,757.57 on the roads of the
county between December 1st. 1915.
and December 1st. 1916. In another
column of this issue will be found a
tabulated statement of the amount of
money that was spent on each road

she is thus not only an 'outcast, but
a criminal of a sort as well. Brooding
over her wretched lot she arrives In
America, where romance awRits her
to be strangely complicated, however
by her morbid belief regarding her

County Assessor Is Requested
By Governor To Gather
1 Names of Males Qualified
For Military Duty.
E. A. Hughes, county assessor, is
in receipt of a letter from Governor
Thomas E. Campbell a-sking that he
take an enrollment of all those in the
county eligible for membership in the
state militia. The object of the en
rollment is to secure enough men to
fill out the war strength of the First
Arizona Infantry.
. All men between the ages of 18 and
45 are eligible, under the constitution
and laws of Arizona. There are some
exemptions, but they are few. The
county assessors will taks the enroll
ments and these, in turn, will be sent
into the governor who is commander-iu-chief
of the state militia.
No Money Handy
It is not known how Assessor
Hughes will go about securing the en-1
rollment in Cochise cOunty. There is
no provision in the laws for the ex
penditure of money in securing the
enrollment and it is probable that it
will be made on a voluntary basis.
The instructions, placed in the
hands of Hughes, are as follows:
Separate lists will be made for mar
ried men and single men.
Enrollment will be made commenc
ing with number one in each class
and continuing till the total enroll
ment is completed in each class, so
that the total of each roll will be the
total of the married men and to to
tal of the single men in each county.
exemption is allowed will be written
the word "exempt" in the space
lowed for "residence" but complete
information will be given: also the
surname will be written first and the
Christian name last in all cases.
Exemption List
The enrollment will be made of all
residents between the ages or is and
45 excepting those exempted by law

the entries on the enrollment list the
name or those whose exemption is al-
rowed will be entered on the "exemp
tion list" giving the same number as
is given on the enrollment list and
showing whether the man is married
or single and the cause or exemp
tion.
The assessor will satisry himself
that the reasons given Tor exemption j
are sufficient and in case physical dis
ability is claimed that is not appar
ent the man should be examined phy
sically by the county physician and a
certificate furnished.
The following are penalties provid

Council That Officers' Sal
aries Be Raised.
A movement for the increase of the
salaries paid the city marshal and
city police was launched last nisht at
a meeting of the board of directors of
the Warren District Commercial Club
when the following resolution was
I adopted:
"Resolved; That the Warren Dis
trict Commercial Club recommend to
te city council that the salary of the
city marshal be increased $25 and
that the salaries of members of the
police department be increased $15
a month, and that the police force be
Incieased sufficiently to' safeguard
the city."
The proposed salary increases
would make the salary of the city
marshal $175 a month and of the po
lice $130 a month. Out of the present
salaries the police are buying their
own flashlights, uniforms and even
