AS TO REASON
Answer to This Question May
Determine Whether Depart
ment to Continue Along
Same Line of Action
WASHINGTON'. Doc. C Develop
ments today left it mill in doubt
, whether Mexican officials really com
plied with the requestor the United
States in releasing William O. Jen
kins, the American consular agent
whose imprisonment at Puebla
brought relations between the two
governments to a critical pass.
Press dispatches that the release
was accomplished only after bail had
been furnished were not civered in
official advices to the state depart
ment, which said that Jenkins had
reported himself as entirely ignorant
of the manner in which he was lib
erated and that he was making an
investigation on his own account.
Upon the answer to this question
seems to hinge whether the sharp
diplomatic correspondence on the
subject is to be renewed or the inci
dent permitted to pass into history.
Meantime the fact of the release
itself apparently has relieved much
of the tension of the Mexican affairs
both at the state department and in
the senate, where uneasiness over I
recent developments had produced a
determined movement to ask for a
severance of diplomatic relations.
The resolution of Senator Fall, Re
publican, New Mjexico, requesting a
diplomatic break, was considered at
an afternoon conference of Republi
can members of the foreign relations
committee, and it was decided not
to press the proposal for action until
President Wilson had sent to the
committee the memorandum of ad
vic ehe promised Senator Fall yes
terday at the Whtie House.
It. was indicated that there was
some difference of opinion 'among
the Republican senators as to the
expediency of the resolution and that
if the president expressed disappro
val, it might not be pressed for ac
tion. The full committee will meet
again Monday.
In trying to establish the facts be
hind Jenkins release, the state de
partment is running down a suspect
ed connection between J. Salter Han
sen, said to have furnished bail for
the consular agent, and the Mexican
government.

Southwestern head offices by the lo
cal agent.
What the reduction of service along

PROGRESS IDE
AT INDUSTRIAL
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6 Delegates
to the second industrial conference
concluded their first week's work to
day, confident that substantial prog
ress had been made toward a pro
gram for harmonizing relations be
tween capital and labor.
It is the tentative plan now to con
tinue holding ten and perhaps twelve
executive sessions a week up to Dec.
19, by which time it is hoped a pre
liminary draft of the conference's
recommendations will have been fin
ished. Recess then will be taken
over the holidays.
On their return the delegates will
have available the result of investi
gations by experts into various
phases of the industrial situation and
will hear the opinion of representa
tives of labor and capital on the pre
liminary draft. Using the new in
formation the conference will re
draft their recommendations and sub
mit them to the house through the
press, hoping to obtain constructive
criticism before the final report is
prepared.
While definite conclusions were
not reported on any of the questions
before the conference, it was said
that the delegates regarded the first
week"s work as highly valuable. Stan
ley King of Boston, summarizing the
.results, declared the conference had
reversed the procedure o fthe first
conferenc and was proceding first to
the discussion of "maenmery and
methods," arther than to enunciate
a set of principles.

CONFERENCES
NEIMUNICIPAL
CONFERENCE 0 f
IMEX. GOVERNORS
S SIGNIFICANT
Believes Carranza's Call For
Meeting of Executives Is
To Urge Campaign To
Prevent Intervention
WASHINGTON, Dec. 6. The con
ference of Mexican governors called
by President Carranza for Dec. 20 is
said by advices from Mexico City
reaching here to have wider aspects
than first was indicated.
In issuing the call, according to in
formation received here, the Mexican
president is said to have informed
the governors that it was Imperative
to pacify the country if American in
tervention were not "Ultimately to be
expected. A plan will be outlined at
the meeting for the organization in
all the Mexican states of rurales,
home guards and militia, it was
added.
Those who are openly hostile to
Carranza profess to see a different
purpose in the move than one to
pacify the country. The first, they
contend, is to place Mexico on a war
footing so far as possible and to sup
plant the federal troops with an army
organized in the variQUs states; and
the second, it is charged, is to make
the unpaeified condition of Mexico
so apparent as to warrant a suspen
sion of the presidential elections next
July, when Carranza's term expires.
There is warrant in the Mexican
law, it is said, for postponing elec
tions whe nthe country is not fully
at peace.
Those who support Carranza, how
ever, contend that his plan is entirely
to pacify the country, hant down
bandits, restore order and remove
the causes for difficulty with the
United States.
The majority of governors called to
the conference, it is said, are Carran
za supporters, while a smaller num
ber of them are adherents of Gen.
Obregon, the most formidable con
tender so far, for the Mexican presi
dency. Armed clashes between the
two factions already have been vari
ously reported.
Because of continued inquiry being
made to the Review regarding the ex
emption of mining claims from assess
ment work of this year, the following
statement of Congressman Carl Hay
den is published for the information
of those who may still be in doubt re
garding the matter:
"All mining claims are exempt from
assessment work dunig the ear
1919, but each claimant must tile a
notice with the county recorder prior
to December 31, in order to obtain the
benefit of this law. By joint reoolu
tion the senate and house suspended
the provision in Section 2324 of the
Revised Statutes of the United States,
which requires on each mining claim
located and until a patent has been
issued therefor, not less than $ 100
worth of labor ' to be performed, or
improvements aggregating such
amount to be made each year. The
suspension applies to all mining
claims in United tSates and Alaska
during 1919.
"But to obtain the benefits of this
suspension of law every claimant of
any such mining claim must have
filed in the office where the location
notice or certificate is reorded on or
before Deember 31, a notice of desire
to hold said mining claim under this
resolution."

RECORD YEAR IN CITRUS !
m FRUIT IS INDICATED
PHOFNIX. Dec. C With the sea
son more than hair gone and every
indication pointing toward a record
year in citrus history in Arizona, the
Arizona Orange association is ship
ping on an average of three cars of
oranges and grapefruit each day. Al
ready nearly 70 cars have been
shipped by the association, which in
cludes a majority of the orange and
citrus growers' in the valley, and the
.season's output will run close to 150
cars. v ;
Probably the most important fea
ture of the, season, however, is the
fact that at last Arizona oranges and
grapefruit are coming into their own
as America's best, and are finding
recognition as such in every part or
the country. The Arizona product is
receiving preference over the famed
California crop in Los Angeles and
San Francisco! and is dominating
the entire coast market, as well as
middle western markets.
The first car of Arizona fruit was

October 29, and ever since that time
there has been ceaseless activity.

ing women fho are unbeautiful. Higher
education for women, women in in
dustry, all the changes of the ages in
the position of women have not made
women less beautiful. From ancient
Egypt to Babylon to modern London
and New York, men have admired
beautiful women and chosen them for
mates and they will go on doine so.
And th erace tends to reproduce the I
qualities of each generation in each j
succeeding one. Women of less at-

curing husbands and consequently the ;
chances are that in futuer there will j
be more beautiful women rather than '

After the first application of Famo,
you should not have a flake of dan
druff. If the case is stubborn, a little may
remain, but not for long.
The germs will be dead and dying
the new growth begun.
Your hair will be like the hair of
healthy children; your scalp like a
baby's scalp. All itching will b gone.
Famo Will Win Fight
If it is falling out, your hair is fight
ing for its life.
-Famo will win that fight by killing
the bacilli which kill the hair.
Dandruff is a disease which scientists
call Seborrhea.
Freed from the bondage of that dis
sease by Famo, the hair leaps ir.to
luxuriant new growth.
Healthy, Beautiful Hair
It is, we repeat, like renewing the
youth of the scalp giving back to
your hair its . early strength' and
beauty.
Famo will keep the head continuously
clean the hair fresh, full of life,
soft, smooth and glossy.
If your hair ever had a natural ten
dency to wave, Famo will bring
back the waviness and intensify it.
New Hair Is Grown
New hair growth from Famo is con
stantly being reported.
Some of the cases are so remarkable
that they cannot be reported in
print, because they would tax your
credulity. You must learn from per
sonal experience, and the experience
of your friends. Famo contains no
alcohol to dry the scalp and produce
gray hairs. As Famo requires no
scalp massage, its application is
simple.
Every member of the family should
use it every day.
Famo is sold at all toilet goods coun
ters in two sizes a small size at 35
cents, and an extra large bottle for
$1.00. ,
Your money returned if you are not
satisfied.
Seborrhea is the medical name
tor a morbidly increased flow
from the sebaceous glands of the
scalp. The seborrhemn excretion
forms in scales or flakes and is
commonly known as dandruff.

The regular meeting of the board
of control of the Warren District Re
lief association was held on Monday
at 4 p. m. in the office of the school
board. Central .school building, when
a report of the work for the past
three months was given by the gen
eral secretary. Miss Esther Cum
mings. Nineteen families in the district
had been given aid by the Associa
tion s'ncr September 1st, of which
nine fr.:iiies were widows and five
were deserted, these nineteen families
including forty-two children.
Fourteen cases of illness were given
aid, out of which there were five
tubecular cases. The general sec
retary made mention of the fact that
most of the tubercular cases were
transients coming here from the
eastern states, but they did not usual-

ly remain here any longer than it
would be possible to get to some other
place where the altitude was lower.
Eight cases of transportation were
furnished, five of which were on ac
count of illness.
One hundred and twenty articles of
clothing were given out among the
various families and individuals, but
that the big problem during the w in
ter months' in the way of clothing
would be the purchase of shoes.
Fifteen transients applied for aid
during the past three months, some of
whom were considered unworthy and
were refused aid, while others, es
pecially the tubercular cases, were
given help while they remained in
the district.
The local Red Cross shop having
turned over all its clothing to the
Warren District Relief association, as
well as $50 proceeds of the sale of
clothing since October 1st, the gen
eral secretary was instructed by the
board to write Mrs. C. F. Hawley a
letter of thanks for her faithful serr
ices in the sale of this clothing and
other articles in the Red Cross shop
for the benefit of the local association.
The Bisbee High school having also
rendered the association considerable
aid by having printed five hundred
copies of the annual report free of
charge the general secretary was
asked to write the school a letter of
thanks for this donation.
The matter of supplying a Christ
mas basket for each of the destitute
families in the district was consider
ed by the board, when it was decided
to ask the Ministerial association, as
well as business firms in the city, to
notify the general secretary of any
families who might not be able to
have a Christmas dinner without some
aid. when a special effort would be
made to see that each family reported
would bt supplied with a good Christ
mas dinner, the board also hoping
that special donations would be sent
in for this purpose.
During the past three months over
$700 has been expended in connection
with the work of the association, and

This is the fifth of a series of ar

Durfee, district school physician.
Another article of this series will ap

By DR. R. B. DURFEE.
The physical findings in five of the
schools in the Warren mining dis
trict are ery interesting, with Lin

normal children, 48 per cent; Green

nutritional defects, with Central and
Old Warren having the greatest per
centage of undernourished children
and Lincoln the least. There is very
little chance for error or difference
of opinion, as all children 10 per cent
underweight are classified as under
nourished. However, there are many
children less than 10 per cent under
weight who are just as urgently in
need of better care, ho are not in
cluded in these figures. Because you
hae received no. notice froi'rfthe
school health department, does not
mean that you need pay no attention
to the weight of your cnildren. v The
importance of frequent weighing can
not be over-emphasized, and that
weight recorded and compared with
the standard weight. The standard
is only a normal average secured
after weighing thousands of children.
and every chilj should be up to this
standard. Four or five per cent un
derweight may mean as much to one
child as 10 per cent to some other.
Ten per cent indicates that the chijd
has reached the point where it is im
perative that something be done to
improve its physical condition. It is
no lesB important that a child should
gain steadily month by month when
he itf five or ten years old, than it
was that he gain week by week when
he was five or ten months oltL
The homes of the rich are no more
immune than'ihe homes of the poor.
It is not altogether what a child eats
but what he assimilates that makes
the well . nourished child. ... "Every
thing that money can buy" does not
necessarily mean ' that money buys
the right' thing. In fact, there la
great danger of a pempered appetite,
one spoiled by candy, or too much
unwholesome piecing between meals.
If there is no milk In a child's diet,
the effect is the same, whether it is
because of lack of means to buy the
milk, or because it is refused in
preference to some other article of
food, perhaps not at all suited to his
need.
It is Indeed gratifying to find such
hearty response to our efforts in get
ting the pupils up to normal as is
being manifested in the different
schools. Many of the rooms can now
show a clean record, having had all
their defects "corrected. :v Glasses are
being worn, diseased tonsils removed,

perhaps best of all, those who :were

PREST-O-LITE
BATTE 1
AVOR HERE
Automobile drivers throughout
Southern Arizona are welcoming the
new "Green Seal" Prest-O-Lite battery
as the most economical yet placed on
the market. The fact that the battery
Is virtually made the same day you
jut it int your car, has attracted the
attention of hundreds of motorists all
over the southland who at first won
der how such a thing is iiossible in
battery construction, considering that
Southern Arizona is some 2000 miles
removed from the Prest-O-Lite fac
tory at Indianapolis.
"It is just this way," remarked D.
V. Kinmore of McCoy & Kinmore, lo
cal distributors for the Prest-O-Lite
Green Seal battery; "!the erceC of suc
cess of the Perst-O-Lite Green Seal
lies in a perfected process of manu
facture, which permits the shipping of
the battery without being filled or
charged at the factory. It is a well
known act among motorists that de
terioration of the component parts of
a battery is caused by the action of
the acid upon th electrodes or plates
of the interior. The Prest-O-Lite
Green Seal battery is made dry at the
factory and shipped ready to receive
acid and charge for the Lrsi time at
our service station the dty it goes
into you car.
"That means that you get a fresh
battery, newly charged the day it is
connected up. Compare this with the
old style storage battery that is fully
made and charged the day that it
leaves the factory. Perhaps it is one
month in transit out here and lays on
the dealer's shelf from three to nine
months before it is purchased. Dur
all this time the Action of the acid
upon the plates of the battery has had
a deteriorated effect. TU.il battery is
from six to nine mouths "worn out"
the day that it goes into yout car."
Not only in southern Arizona, but
throughout the Unitel Siates, the
"Green Seal" Prest-O-Lite battery has
virtually stampeded the bdltery mar
ket, according to reports that aic com
ing to local dealers from various cor
ners of the country- The experience
of the dealers in this community has
been repeated time and again through
out the nation in as much a3 there has
been no advance in price of the Prest-O-Lite
due to' the "Green Seal" fea
ture and likewise due to me ract mat
Prest-O-Lite is known as the oldest
service to motor car drivers in the
United States.

GATES TUBES
Widespread popularity in the War
ren District is being gained by the
Gales tested tubes for auto tires. The
Gates Rubber company of Denver,
which manufactures the tubes, call at
tention to the great toughness, long
year and satisfactory service which
comes from the 800 per cent stretch
which the tubes have. A sample at
tached to each tube enables the pur
chaser to test this 800 per cent stretch
for himself. Stretch means toughness,
toughness means wearing quality; and
wearing quality means service. The
antimony used in curing this greater
durability and heat-resisting quality.
Also popular are the Gates half-sole
tires, which have proven their quality
in all sorts of service over all kinds
of roads. They are guaranteed punc-
ture-proof. Among some of the
achievements of the Gates half sole'
tires are: 16,600 miles was the win-j

used by Dr. F. H. lierg of Modesto, I
Cal. The other three ran 12,000, 14,000 !
and 15,000 miles respectively.
An old model half-sole has been in
constant service on the Ford of Har-1
ry F. Rhoads of Denver for over two
years with a mileage record close to;
the 20,000 mark and is still going.

do me one particle of good and I was
about to lose all faith in medicine. A

has been nothing short of remarkable
the way Tanlac has helped me. My
appetite came right back and nov I
can eat just anything I want and di
gest it perfectly. My kidneys don't
give me any trouble, and I can sleep
all night long as sound as a child. I
have gained in weight and strength
so much that I dont' feel at all like

Recent favorites fn the motor and

This is not a threat; it's a promise.
A committee meeting to consider
plans for an entertainment program
or a social gathering for the first
year in 1920 was held this afternoon
in the association headquarters. Af
ter going over various plans and pro
posals the committee adopted a pro
gram frcm which it will prepare its
New Year's celebration.
What the celebration will be
party, dance, show will not be known
until the first of the year. Whatever
it will be the committee insists that
it be a surprise so their plans are
being kept secret.
Meeting at the association building
this afternoon to formulate plans for
the occasion were Mrs. S. M. Hatter,
chairman of the committee; Mrs. W.
Lytle, Mrs. J. D. Gresham, Mrs. John

Calumet Baking Pow- m
der is sold at a moderate Iffi
It costs, much less than the
" high priced brands. And but
very little more than the "big
cart" kinds that can never be
depended on. When you pay
more than is asked for Calu
met, you are squandering
money. No matter how much
you give, yon-can't get a bet
ter leavener.
When you buy cheap pow
ders,, you do save a few
pennies on the cost, but poor
baking powder is the most
expensive in the long run be
cause it spoils and wastes
many dollars worth of baking
ingredients.
The moderate cost of Calumet,
combined with the highest merit,
establishes the greatest of baking
powder buying economy.
Calumet has been on the mar
ket for 30 years.-- Long past the
. experimental stage. It is used by
more housewives, more chefs and
Domestic Scientists because ex
perience has proved it productive
of best results at the most eco
nomical cost.
Made in the world's largest,
finest, most sanitary Baking Pow
der factory.

Calumet has mote; than
the, ordinary leavening

use less.
It is all Baking Powder. It
begins to, raise bakings the
instant they are put into the
oven. You don't have to keep
peeping to see if the bakings
are all right. ; You know they
are.
Calumet is sure. . It never
fails. Cajces, biscuits, every
baking in which Calumet is
used, comes from the oven '
just right light, tender,. per
fectly raised and thoroughly
wholesome.
Look Qui For This
; When you buy a pound can of
Calumet you get a full pound
16 ounces no short weights.
Some baking powders are now
being put on the market in 12
ounce cans instead of pound cans.
Be sure you get a pound when
you want' it. Remember Cal
umet is not made by the Trust,
not sold at Trust prices.

GOOD CARD IS
ARRANGED FDD
DECEMBER 1 1
Although handicapped by condi
tions over which the managers of the
organization hau no control, and
which required the fastest kind of
thinking, telephoning and telegraph
ins to overcome, the IMsbee Athletic
club, of which O. S. French is mana
ger and Fiank Loughery matchmak
ei. are announcing fcr their program
on Dec. 11 a card of 26 rounds of
boxing that is declared to be supe
rior ewn to the original list of bouts.
In substituting Danny Kramer and
Ralph Lincoln in the main event,
taking the place of Johnnie Meyer
and Happy Woods, the fans are of
the opinion that the club Is putting
on a bout that will be fully as ac
cepiable as the Meyer-Woods go,
with the added fillip that Lincoln is
laying for Kramer with blood in his
eye, while Kramer has one victory
over the sturdy bantamweight, and
the fact that he gained it through a
foul has not changed his opinion
that he can repeat the trick. This
bout bids fair to be the fastest and
hardest battle that has 'been staged
at the Grand theater since the Bis
bee Athletic club came into, exist
ence. Kramer, accompanied by his man
ager, Charlie Kline, arrived in Bisbee;
last evening. Earl Mohan, manager
r.f Linooin, also came in on the even
ing train, and the preliminaries for
the fight were arranged quickly by
them and Manager French. Lincoln
will be in tov'i this morning. Both
boys are in the best of shape,- and
will finish conditioning at local gym
nasiums. Beth' will start training
today. . As. has been announced,-the .fight
between Johnnie Meyer, and Happy
Woods was called off on the advice
of Dr. S. D. Townsend, of Tucson,
after an examination to an injury to
Woods' eye, which had been received
in his last fight. The results of Dr.
Townsend's examination are con
tained in the following certificate,
which he mailed to Manager French
yesterday:
"I rind the condition of Mr. Woods
light eyelid in such shaep that I do
not consider him physically fit to
engage in any boxing bout for at
least two weeks.
"The wound he received in his last
fight has become infected, and I
think it would be inadvisable for him
to take any violeftt exercise.
(Signed) "S. D. Townsend, M. D."
The substitution of Kramer and
Lincoln for Meyers and Woods has
added considerably to the expense of
putting on the card, as have several
other changes which have been
forced upon the management, but
the substitutions have been made
with the one thought which has dom
inated the policy of the club in put
ting on all its cards that is, to give
the best there i3 and to keep its
promises. The support which has
been given to the club by the fans
of the Warren district has been proof
that this policy has been appreci"-
ated. ,
The semi-final is going to be as
good a bout as the main event. Bob
Collins, the husky heavyweight of
the Briggs shaft, will step out against
L'illie Johnson, and fans are of the
opinion that Johnson, who is a few
pounds lighter than his opponent,
will show Collins some tricks ot the
squared circle that the latter has
never known before. Of course. Col
lins has that haymaker left of his,
and if he gets it over tlie bout is
apt to ccme to a quick and perma
nent end, as have the last two of
Collins' bouts.
Another bout that is going to get
the crovsd cn its feet is that between
Tony 0hf. of Tucson, and Kid
Bruno, of Ilauglas. Ochoa is fast and
clever, with a good punch, while
Bruno has a punch that comes
through the air like a sledge ham
mer. This was demonstrated in his
fight here with George Bums, when
he floored the Ixiwell lad in the first

Hernia, the haid-hitting youngster j
who made such a good impression m
his fight here three weeks ago with

just about llerrera's ouild.
Ai.hm.eh this is a substitute card.
lt'is considered a better program
h-n the original, 'especially in the
fact that the main event is going to
be practically a championship lut tie
with both boys on their toes for the
laurels of the southwest in the ban

i PR ESCOTT HAS FINE CLUB
r PR.ESCOTT, Dec. 6. The Hassa-
yampa C'ountry club, located in the
j heart of tbe pines in West Preteott,
I is one of, the most beautiful country
I club sites in the southwest. Bealiz
ing the lack of entertainment facili
i ties in the mile high city, Leroy An
derson a few months ago started the
campaign for this club. It met with
the unanimous approval of the lead
ing men and women of Prescott and
its membership now includes live
wires from Jerome. Phoenix, Clark
daie and even Texas and New ork.
A beautiful nine-hole golf course
has been opened to the memoers.
This course was constructed under
the. direct supervision of Jack Mc
Laren, one of the best known golfers
in the United tSates and Scotland. A
challenge was recently made by Rob
ert E. Tally, H. DeWitt Smith, Wal
ter C. Miller and Bert Williams, mem
bers of the Clarkdale Golf club, to
meet any four members of the Hassa
yampa Country club in a tournament.
This challenge has been accepted.
Plans are now being submitted for
the building of a club house. Teunis
courts will be built in the spring.
PALMER TO BOX I NTUCSON.
TUCSON, Dec. 6 Kid Palmer of
Douglas and Bert Colima of Los An
geles will be the main event on the
next fight card at the Elyslan grove.
The two boys have been matched by
Pronioter Art Shannon for the night
of December 12, one week from to
night. , ' :
Palmer needs no introduction to
local fans. He has cleaned up every
thing from Frenchy Desmarias to Kid
Herman. Palmer is without question
ajsqrapper who sojii day is going, to
be at the top in his class. Colima will
be remembered as the only lad who
has so far won from Happy Woods.
Colima gave Happy a broken nose and
stopped him in the six round of their
scheduled ten round bout at Yuma. ,
PHOENIX SEEKS COAST GAME
PHOENIX, Dec. 6 Th Phoenix
high -school football team is still
hopefully waiting for definite arrange
ments to be. made for a coast trip. It
is practically a certainty that a game
can be scheduled providing Phoenix
high school will wait long enough.
Although Santa Monica has cancelled
her game with the Cootes, Long
Beach is still willing to play after she
, completes her race for the champion
ship, and now negotiations are tinder
way for a game between Phoenix and
a California team to be played in
Pasadena during the tournament of
roses on New Year's day.
MARTIN BURKE IS FRECKLED LIKE OLD BOB
.
1
v .
mnrT burke
Martin Burke, sensational young heavyweight of New Orleans, looks something like old Bob Fitzsim
mons. Old Bob was so freckled you didn't know which was freckles and which was his natural complexion. And
Martin isnf any improvement on the old model. He's probably worse. He looks as if he'd been -wearing a
sieve for a sunshade. And besides the freckles he is knock-kneed like old Fitz.
Despite the reverse suffered by
Martin Burke of New Orleans in his
bout with George Chip recently, the
sensational oung aspirant for heavy
weight honors still should be consid
ered in the running along with the
other young giants Bob Martin, Jack

than it does today. The youngsters

Georges Carpentier, the new heavy-
weight boxing champion of Europe,
j was born at Lens, France, Jannary 12,
, 1894. He began boxing when only 13
j years of age. This was in 1907, when
boxing was beginning to be papular in
France. He was both skilfull and ag
gressive, and in 1909 scored many vic
tories, defeating among others Charles
Leboux, the Frence bantamweight
champion.
Carpentier too kon weight rapidly
and two years later he was meeting
and defeating . men in the welter
weight division.- The Frenchman scor
ed his fitst sensational victory when
he knocked out Jim Sullivan, the Eng
lish middleweight, in two rounds at
Monte CarTo in 1912."
At Ghent the following year, Car
penter, after beng knocked down
twice by Bombadier Wells, the Eng
lish heavyweight, knocked out the
British representative, in the foutrh
round. The fact that a French lad 19
years old and a middleweikht, had
knocked out the cleverest English
heavyweight, Beemed to some of the
latter's backers a fluke. Carpentier
dispelled this doubt, however, vhen
he went over to London and knocked
out Wells a second time, ending the
bout in the opening round. Forty
days afterwards, Carpentier fought
Y.M. C. A. Bowling Notes

Another popular bowler whose de

friends but by all of his wide circle
of acquaintances, is Mr. McGaughy,

of the E. P. & S. W. at this point. We

A lot of the old timers are still try

Joe Jeanette, the American negro
heavyweight, defeated Cahpentler ear

the declaration of war between France
and Germanq, the French champion
won decisions from Kid Jackson and
Gunboat Smith on fouls.
A few hours after i.,r Smith fight,

During his early ring career, Car
pentier grew rapidly fom a bantam
weight to a light-heavyweight and
beat the Euopean champions in each
class as he progressed. He ammassed
a fortune variously estimated from
$200,000 to $500,000.
Most of this money he invested in
coal mines near Lens, where he was
born, and he lost everything there by
the German invasion.
During the war Carpentier was con
spicuously daring as an aviator. "He
was frequently commended by his su
perior officers and among the many
decorations conferred upon him, was
the military rnedal, the highest war
honor that can be given to a French
soldier.

match was with the Y. M. C. A team,
the tournament leaders, on Thursday
evening. Harrington and his men,
however, evidently had this very
match in mind when they bowled the
School Faculty team on Saturday
night, for their scores were excep
tionally low on this occasion. As a
result of all this, the C. & A. and Y.
M. C. A. teams . faced each other
Thursday evening with a difference
of 316 pins between them. With &uch
a handicap' the C. & A. couldn't hope
to win and the Y. M. C. A. team con
tinues to hold first place. Who's go

the Pickups, the last team the Y. M.

Miss Core continues to lead tne la
dies with rer remarkable bowling.
Last Wednesday evening she bowled
206, 172 and 154. Her average of 156
for the tournament is one of which
any amateur bowler might be proud.
When the fact is taken into considera

The Knights of Columbus soccer
team will have some of the old reli
able players in its lineup when it
faces the Copper Queen team this
afieinoon. Among the K. C. players
will be some who were on the team
which won the Warren District foot

no o.h"r team having held it.
They also won the Charity Cup
twice straight. The Fourth of July
relay race also was won by four
members of the K. of C. football club.
The final game of 1914, in which the
Warren District cup was offered the
fiist time, was hotly contested be
tween the K. of C. and Bisbee "Hom

to nothing at half time. The reputa
tion of the K. of C. for coming from
behind again asserted itself and they
defeated the Homers for the final
score of 3 to 2.
Ed. Dickinson, president of the
Homers team, was the most disap

that at half time has was seen to be

It is true that the Dort is more than ordinarily
economical in the use of gasoline and oil.
Its tire mileage, likewise, is visibly higher than
is usual.
The sum of ycur savings in these three points
will run up to an appreciable amount in the
course of a season.
But you will find the most noteworthy econo
my of the Dort in such items as overhauling,
tuning up and replacements.
It requires the minimum of service attention ti-kcc.T
it in fit condition and continuous service.
Two factors are chiefly responsible for.this. They
typify the Dort ideal in manufacture.
One i.s the skill and painstikinQ precision

THE FORWARD MOVEMENT
N THE CHURCHES
Apparently the churches are awake
to the necessity for increased activity
in this new day of opportunity. The
Methodist chuich through the "Cen
tenary Movement." has raised more
than one hundred million dollars for
churcii extension and plans to add one
million n:i:.es to its roil during the
comiag year. The Harpists are seek-:
ing to attain similar ends, working to
attain similar ends, working through
the agency of the 'T.aptist Layman's ,
Movement." The Lutherans have a ;
"Tereentary Movement," the Disciples '
a "Men and Million Movement," thu i
Presbyterians a "New Era Move-
went,", while the Episcopal church is
seeking to mobolize its forces through
a movement known as the "Nation- j
wide Campaign' '
Other churches loo nuerous to
mention have inaugurated special
movements with the Y. M. C. A. and
the- Y. W. C. A. and the Salvation
Army cooperating, un.il it would seem
that all the evangelical forces of the
nation are harnessed and set to work.
Mr. Lewis B. Franklin, formerly di
rector of the five Liberty Loan cam
paigns, volunteered his services as di
rector of the nation-wide campaign of j
the Episcopal church and gives the'
following interesting summary of its ,
objective: I
We men of this country have grown '
in our business lives in the last 20 ,
years. We are no more an isolated i
nation. Self-sustaining, Independent
of any other, we have become almost
the hub of the universe. We are today
the center of the financial part of the
globe. We are today the richest na-
tion in the world. We lead in mer-1
chant marine, we lead in manufactur- i
ing, we lead in production of food
stuffs. Our men of business and our
professional men are In touch with
problems and economic conditions all
over this globe. Their own Immediate
business may be affected tomorrow by
what happens in Russia. Their own
personal fortunes may be affected by
something that is going to happen
next week in Italy. They are up and
doing. They know what is going on in
this great world today. They are well
up with current history. They are
alive,-: Their business is expanding.
They take no back seat from anybody.
But they have not been interested.
When they, serve on the vestry they
are invited to a meeting perhaps once
a month to spend the mony that the
women raised. Is it any wonder that
the men of our church have not been,
as deeply interested in the church of
God as in their business?
They have sat from Monday until
Saturday looking out throukh a pair
of opera glasses, and at the other end
they see on the field of vision great
things going on in the world of trade,
in the world of finance, in politics, in
all of which they are interested. And
then on Sunday that same opera glass
is turned around the other way and
they put the big end up to their eyes
and down below them see a little
problem of the church not of the
church, but -of their own little parish

fascinating and thrilling alventur eto
sit on a vestry after thinking ami
dreaming in terms of world trade all
week? Some excuse for the layman,
it seems- to me.
The Army That Must Be
The church today has something
different to say to us. It comes to
us and says: "Turn those opera glass
es that you use for church and put
them right end foremost, and we will
show you that we have before you
here a vision of what the church in
tnis country ought to we a vision
that you and I are going to make
come true, and the plan by wjgc-h we
are going to make it come true is here
before us, and we are not going to
fail. It is a vision big enough and
broad enough and a problem great j
enough to enlist the imagination of j
any man or woman in this country, no i
matter how big his business interest !
may be. It is grand enough to chal-
lensre the time of any man with red
hlnn.I in his v-fina and with the slizht-'
est bit of devotion to the church of Dec. 7th is recognized as "Steward
Christ. We are done with thinking in- ship Sunday" throughout the United
wardly. We are going to Dranch out States by the Presbyterian Church,
and see wttat we can do in the bigger It is hoped that all members of the
world."
Some peopl ehave said. What is the
need of all this money? Why this sud
den change in conditions? The church
has never taken up anything like this
before. Why now?
I would suggest, if yoc want an an
swer to that question, that you read
the paper tomorrow morning look on
the front page of the big dailies of to
day. What do you see? Right across
the front page you see murder, an
archy, rape, riot, sedition, arson. Vou

fchot down in cold blood, with a nation;

tion we ar eliving in today, friends.
What is the church to do about it? I
Leave it to our legislators? They have
been struggling with it, working with
it, and they are about ready to say
that the present social disturbance
and the present social problems can
not be solved by legislation.
I had a letter the othei day from a
man to whom I wrote about the Na
tion Wide campaign a man who has
been giving, during the past three or ;
four years, a very considerable por
tion of his time to preaching sound '
economics to the people of this coun-;
try as a cure for social disturbances
and social equality. I asked him it ne
would help inthe Nation-Wide Cam
paign. He said to me:-"I am not a
churchman, but I want to tell you that
after spending several years of my
life in talking to the people ol this
country about economic problems and
the relation of capital to labor and
suggesting new legislation to cure
these problems, I have come . to the
conclusion that there is only one cure
for this situation and that, is a general j
acceptance of the preaching of Jesus (
Christ." i
EDUCATE CHILDREN IN RELIGION
The idea of many parents that the ,
religious education of their children '
is of little concern; that in matters
religious the child should be left alone
until the time when he can work these i
these things out for himself, is scored '
by Rev. Henry A. Arnold, pastor of the
Washington Street Congregational
church.
"We do not dream of letting our
children decide whether they will
have polite manners or not, whether
they shall be ignoramuses or not, and
; yet too often we do not take every
I means to see to it that they are guided
I into a helpful religious experience,"
he said.
"It is infinitely more reasonable
that we put our best energy in seeking
to train our children in right habits
and moods and impulses, the sources
I of character, than to let them grow
up like weeds and then seek by ex-
: tr.avagant methods to convert them
from the error of their ways."

By Rev. H. C. Hengell, Madison, Wis.
One cannot read the newspapers
nowadays without feeling some mis

American Republic. As Americans
we all wish to believe that all is well
with our country and that her future I
is assured, but the current events of i
the day indicate that our nation faces
worse foes than it has ever faced be
fore. We are not, indeed, threatened
seriously by aggression from without,
but we are threatened by discord and
disorder from within.

country in a turmoil.- They are try

SAVED FROM
RELIGION ALONE
In his farewell addressed 1o the i
American people, George Washington '
gave the answer when he wisely
wrote, "Both reason and experience
forbid us to expect that national mor- i
ality can prevail in the exclusion of j
$religious principles."
If Americans ;
continue to neglect religion, if they
continue to neglect religion training
for their growing boys and girls, the
time will surely come. when the Amer
ican ship of state will be wrecked on
the reefs of materialism.
The anarchists are logical and con
sistent in their slogan, "Neither God
nor master." Refusing to recognize
God there is no logical or consistent
reason why one should recognize an
authority or convention established by
mere men.
The only effective means to prevent j
anarchv is to promote religion. The
only sound method to promote Ameri-
canization is to teach respect and j
obedience to God. Either a way must i
be found to train Amrican boys and j
girls in religious thoughts and prac-
tice in the schools, or the American
Republic is doomed.
PATRIOTISM
build bridges after she has cut out
engineering? Why solution of moral
problems when she has cut out moral
teaching and the basis of it? This Is
truth, however strange it may sound,
to those of us who are accustomed to
think that the state must have noth
ing to do with religion, and the church
nothing to do with politics.
"Sixty-five per cent of the people
are without religious affiliation. Many
of these grow up in the midst of posi
tively Hnti-religiout- and anti-mo-al
surroundings and teaching. Yet they
are expected to be loyal, intelligent
citizens whenever the state exercises j
religious functions, and be good moral
subjects!
"What 'religion shall the .'tate
teach? Teach a religion that is a
summicient basis for the religious
functions that she exercises and the I
moral laws she has enacted. j
"Some of the results of this system
would be to elimin?te atheism from
our patriotism. The unrodly and the I
unpatriotic would be in one class. Ir
religious teachings would be put out
of our state institutions. The class
room could not be used for the de
struction cf citizenship. The trans
gressor here would be tried . as a
criminal against the state. This same

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"The best of what we do and are, just God forgive!"

NEWS PRINT PAPER SHORTAGE AT CRISIS
THE news print paper shortage, seriot's for many weeks past, has
now reached the acute stage, with scores of weekly news
papers being forced to the wall, and daily newspapers in many
comparatively large communities facing similar ruin. Drastic
action must bo taken, and taken immediately, or the publishing
industry in America will be dealt a blow from which neither the
newspapers nor the American reading public will recover for years."
Representatives of Eastern paper houses, visiting Arizona pub
lishes on their way to the coast, report that the extent of the
present paper shortage, especially of news print paper, is as yet but
vaguely realized except by those most vitally concerned, an3 tha'
to mako a had matter worse, there is absolutely no relief in sight
for the situation.
The American Newspaper Publishers' Association, the accredited
national organization representing all the important publishers- and
piactically all of the minor ones, is issuing daily appeals to the news
papers to cut dowrf their use of paper to tha minimum, while, in
creasing their advertising rates, ir. ordor that they mr.y curvlTe.
Advertising rates must be increased so that the advertisers will
spond the same amount of money with the newspapers, while .not
calling for ro large an outlay of news print paper.
This is the situation which the Bisbee Daiiy Review, together
with other Arizona papers, fs facing. The situal'cn in its ultimate
aspects is worse, if anything, in Arizona than in other parts of the
nation, owing to what may be described as the intermediate size of
the daily papers published in this state. The weight with which
the paper shortage affects the newspapers begins lightly at the top,
where the leading metropolitan newspapers are able to purchase
hu?o scores of paper wholesale on long time contracts, and make
drastic cuts in their voluminous editions where necessary; it is fcR
most heavily at the bottom, where the little weekly pacers can ill
affoid to pay the tremendous present cost of white paper, and must
purchase in negligible quantities, supplying their wants (or tut a
fewissues at a time. In between are the papers-in cities of 100,01)0
cr under, such as the Review, which, while on too .firm a financial
basis to be forced to suspend publication like many of the iittle week
lies, enjoy none of the advantages in wholesale paper purchasing,
end in ability to reduce the size' of their editions, of the metropolitan
dailies.
It is the fact that all the papers in Arizona are of this inter
mediate size, which makes the situation peculiarly precarious in this
state. Practically no paper can now be purchased at domestic mills.
Quotations from foreign mills, to give tone typical example, are from
S to 9 cents F. O B. from Scandinavian mills, which means about
15 cents per pound for news print paper at the point of entry in this
country; while to this 15 cents must be added the snipping rates
across 'the continent to Arizona.
The newspapers of Arizona, including the Review, are facing a
crisis which calls for drastic action unless these papers are to be
operated at a loss. ;
HEALTH IN THE RiSBEE SCHOOLS
ILLUMINATING, but not discouraging, are the statistics given by
Dr. R. B. Durfee, district school physician, on detects found
aucng children in the Warren District schools, which are pub
lished in full in nnother part of this issue of the Review.
These statistics reveal that of 1542 children examined by Dr.
Durfro n five schools of the district, only 39.2 per cent were found
to be perfectly normal that. 60.3 per cent of all Ihese children had
physical defects of some kind. The Lincoln school stands highest
in point of health, with 43 per cent cf the children examined found
to be normal, and the Cemial lowest with 31 per cent normal.
At lirst thought this appear:; to point, to an appalling condition
in the lecal school., but such is far from the case. In the first place,
the local schools compare favorably in health with :ny in the South
west, or the nation; but other sc.l-.ooln have not been given the frank
and determined publicity as to hea.tii conditions which the local
school authorities, in a vigorous helath campaign recently launched,
have instituted. In the second p;ace, the great majority of the
defects found can and will he- corrected, according to Dr. Durtee.
Finally, the examining of the school children has lasted over a period
of weeks, and since the first, examinations were made, much correct
ive work has been undertaken, with the result that the percentage
of normal children is undoubtedly now much higher in the schools
examined first than the published statistic show.
The wisdom of the school authorities in launching their cam
paign of health publicity and education already has been justified.
"It is indeed gratifying to find such hearty response to our efforts
in getting the pupils up to normal as is being manifested in the
different Hchool.i." says Dr. Durfee. "(Masses are being worn, dis
eased tonsil.-, removed, defective breathing corrected, ami perhaps
best of all, those who were undernourished art rapidly gaining in
weight."
All this, as a result ol a few weeks examining of children in the
schools, concurrently with a practical campaign for correcting the
defects found. But, as Dr. Durfee points out, and as his published
statistics shew there is still much to he dene. Parents are urged
to consuk with the Health Depannient of the schools In the cam
paign for further correcting the physical defects of their children,
and insuring them happiness, health, and an opportunity to grow up
into strong, clean and intelligent American ci'izens, unhampered by
the physical ills which in later years result from neglected defects
of childhood.
The BL-beo school authorities have taken the right course. They
aie doing a splcnlH work, which will soon make the health condi
tions in the schools of the district ar. example to the entire Southwest.
A division of Serbian fighters is now on the job to discourage
any further patriotism in the way of poetic license.
We can't blame Germany for not knowing what oiiar boys were
fighting for when our own senate doesn't know.
Conditions in Turkey, must lie normal again. There has been
another efficient butchery of Armenians.

He lives in another day,
While his thoughts are those of another time
And an era that's far aWay.
The land he knew when his life was young
Has changed with the changing years.
And the smiles he has for the modern things
Are dimmed by Memory's tears.
His was the glory the high romance,
The courage and flie singing heart;
His was the strife with a stranger land.
And the life from the world apart.
And Time has painted the things he wrought
In colors that never fade,
And the debt we owe for bis virtues bold
Can never be well repaid.

Happenings of a Week
From Texas Oil Fields
OIL SHALE OF ARIZQNATfl PHGVE IWICHITA FAtLS
FIELD GROWING
VALUABLE ASSET SAYS TAX HEAD
PHOENIX, Dec. 6. Oil will be dis
covered in Arizona in the form of oil
shale, thousands of acres will be
turned Into open oil shale mines,
easily operated by steam shovels, oil
shale extraction plants will be estab
lished, and a great new industry
added to the state. This is the start
ling prediction made by C. M. Zander,
chairman or the state tax commission,
and he bases it upon what he saw and
heard at the National Mining con
gress, which he attended as a' mem
ber )f the Mine Tax committee of the
National Tax conference.
"So important was this pioneer in
dustry regarded by the congress,"
said Zander, "that a new oil shale
section was created with Professor
Alderson of the Colorado and Utah,
..and to ny mind there is no reason
why hus:e. quantities should not be
located in this state.
"With other delegates I visited the
trial plant which has been set up iri
East St. Louis, demonstrating tho
process for extracting the oil from
shale which has been perfected by
Professor Wallace. With my own
eyes I saw the rock, ordinary shale
in appearance, placed in a retort, and
the finished product, oil. taken out.
"The theory is that there is no oil
as such in the shale but that the ex
cessive heat brings about a chemical
change which liberates the oil through
the disintegration of the other sub
stances which to to make up the
rock. Fifty gallons of oil may be ob
tained from a ton of shale in thu
manner, though not one drop could be
secured by pressure unless there was
heat combined.
'Enough gas is given off in the
process to run an ordinary plant,
thus eliminating all cost of operation.
The product is a high-grade of oil
with bases of asphalt and parafinc
about canalized.' For some time past
shales of Scotland have been treated
by a similar process with good suc
cess, though more sulphate or am
monium Is to be obtained in the
Scottish shales than is to be found in
those of western America.
"I have been informed that there
are large shale deposits in the north
ern part of Arizona, and it is likely
also that some will be discovered on
the Navajo Indian- reservation in con
nection with the deposits of coal
thfrpin. Arizona has large lignite
coal deposits and I was told that this)
grade of coal undoubtedly would yield j
to' the treatment, giving a good pro-j
portion of oil and also a residue, o. ,
coke, which could be made into bri
quettes." The American Mining congress was
held November 17-21, with the larg
est attendance in the history of the
organization. Among those who at
tended from' Arizona in addition to
Zander, were: R. B. Watkins, editor
of the Arizona Mining Journal, Joe
Curry, secretary of the Arizona chap
ter; T. O. McGrath, chief clerk of the
Shattuck Arizona Copper company;
Superintendent Jerolemon of the C.
& A., of Bisbee. and Professor But
ler of the University of Arizona.
According to Zander the congress
took a more advanced position in the
matter of labor and capital than ever
before, "conciliation" being the key
note of the hour.
The section on mine taxation was
attended by those who had been
named by the National Tax confer
ence. Two main points were devel
oped: invested capital and depletion
of ore bodies. The general thought
was that invested capital should be
considered the present value as de
termined by pre-war averages, rather
than the amount invested at the in
ception or the business. Nothing
definite was worked out in the mat
ter of depletion of ore bodies and it
was admitted that this would be a
difficult matter to get at.
WICHITA FALLS, Tex., Dec. 6 A
2000 barrel weir has been completed
extending the extension of the Burk
burnett field about a quarter of a
mile northwest. It is the No. 9 of C.
B. Jackson in block 98. This well is
attracting much attention as it is in
a territory which has been considered
hazardous drilling land on account of
salt water.
This company holds 40 acres in
block 98 under lease and already has
four other wells going down.
The Rock Island railroad is now
considering the best route to be taken
in laying a line into Wichita Falls. A
surveying party will be in the field
at an early date.
This new line will run north and
south, giving greatert strength to tho
city as an oil and refining center. It
will also materially aid in making
Wichita Falls an industrial and job
bing center.

Phoenix en route from Douglas to
Jerome. The emergency will be met
by the use of oil as fuel, Douglas ex
plained, and until a supply of oil can
be secured Senator Clark of the
United Verde has offered to loan the
amount of coal necessary to keep the
United Verde Extension in operation.
Sleet Suspends Operations
Operations in the IH-stlemona field

miles west of Round Rock in William-
1 son county, is the newest- scene of
drilling operations in the effort to find
the pool of oil said by geologists to lie
beneath the surface of Travis or ad
joining counties.

One of the outstanding features of TEXAS RANGER is the attitude of the
organizers regarding further promotions.
Stockholders are assured that ALL the ENERGIES of the men who are
organizing this unusual company will ALWAYS be toward MArUISO
TEXAS RANGER a success.
Already TEXAS RANGER has holdings CHECKERBOARDED throughout
the GUSHER fields of LOUISIANA and are also PROTECTED in the
New Mexico fields.
And the PRESENT holdings by no means constitutes the EARNING
power of TEXAS RANGER.
The company is INCORPORATED under the rigid laws of the state of
ARIZONA. Their charter permits them to engage in all branches of the
OIL BUSINESS, and the AMBITION of the men behind TEXAS RANCLK
is to make this one of the really BIG independent producing, refining and
marketing organizations.
New acreage will be added to the company from time ime pipe
lines and refineries will be built it is the sincere EXPECTATIONS of the
organizers to make eaeh DIVIDEND check GREATER than the preced
ing one.

m 12 DIFFERENT TRACTS
Llnin nf TEXAS RANGER consists of . ONE HUNDRED
ND SEVENTY acres in the HOMER field. SURROUNDED by GUSH
ERS of the Standard Oil Company, the Texas Company, Sinclair and
within a FEW FEET of OUR ONE HUNDRED ACRE tract the. Royal
Dutch Schell company and the Roxana Petroleum company are drilling
at more than a thousand feet and any day a PRODUCER might be brought
in by either of the BIG companies which should cause this ONE tract to be
worth several times the capitalization of TEXAS RANGER.
You will note from the attached clipping from the El Paso Times that
acreage in the HOMER field is selling for FORTY THOUSAND DOL
LARS per acre. These enormous prices are paid for land in the NORTH
WEST portion of the field, where MOST OF TEXAS RANGER'S leases
are located and where oil men ARE CONFIDENT will be found the
GREATEST PRODUCERS.
Texas Ranger owns TWO 20 acre tracts in the Bull Bayou field within
l3s than 400 feet from production and their lease in Comanche County,
Texas, is only a short distance from producing wells.
The company has also secured holdings in the Orange Basin, New Mex
ico, but this land will not be developed until after some of the many com
panies now operating here prove up this field.

Ted's Sprained Ankle
White House. November 2S, 1903.
DEAR TED:
If I were you I should certainly get
the best ankle support possible. You
do not want to find next fal lthat
Webb beats you for the' end because
jour ankle give out and his does not.
If I were in your place, if it were ne
cessary I should put the ankle in plas
ter for the netx three weeks,; or for as
long as the doctor thiuks it needful
rather than run any risk of this. At
any rate. I would consult him and
wear what ever he thinks is the right
thing.
I wonder if you are old enough yet
to care for a good history of the
American Revolution. Jf so, I think
I shall give you mine by Sir George
Trevelyan; although it is by an Eng
lishman, I really think it on the whole
the best account I have read.. If I
give it to you you must be very care
ful of it, because he sent it to me
himself. 1
p. s. The Bond parrot for mother
has turned up: it is a moat meritor
ious parrot, vey friendly and quite a
remarkable talker.
In December, 1903, President Roose
velt delivered his message on the
Panama Canal, which brought down
upon him a storm of censure and in
sured the successful completion of the
great waterway by the United States.
Af:er 57 years of strife and ineffi
ciency in the canal zone, "something
yas doing." So much for open his
tory. At almost the same time, for
eign powers wer ethreatening Vene
zuela. Germany was the boldest
among them. President Roosevelt
forced the kaiser to arbitrate his
troubles wjth the' South American re
public by threatening to sen dthe
American fleet to uphold the Monroe
doctrine. In other words, this coun
try was on the verge of war. Read of
a Christmas in the Roosevelt home,
and sense the greatest man who could
in O. Henry's words, "turn to a child
the heart of a child," no matter

You Caii Tell VfMsh
Pecple Have Iron hi
Th3ir Blood Strcng
Healthy, Vigorous Folks
City riivtilcinn Says Ordinary Nuxated
Iron Will Increase the titrenctb of
Jsorvous. Kun-down I'eople In Two
Weeks' Time in Many Cases.
ONE stance is enough to tell vhica
people have iron in ibeir blood. They
are the ones that do and dare. The
others are in the weakligg class. Sleepless
nights srent worrying over supposed ail
ments, constant (Jos:nj; T.-itli babit forming
drugs and narcotics, ami useles attempts to
trace up with strong: coffee or other stimu
lants are what keep them suffering and vain
ly longing to be strong. Their real trouble
is lade of iron in the blood. Without iron
the blood has no pov.-er to change food int3
living tissue and, therefore, nothing you eat
does you god; you don't get the strength
out of it. When iron is srpp'ied it enriches
the impoverished blood and gives the body
greater resistance to ward off disease.
Numbers of nervous, run-down people who
were ailinj all the while have most aston
ishinply increased their strength and en
durance simply by taking iron in the proper
form. And this, after they had in some cases
been going on fur months without gctiiiig
benefit from arythin?.
If you ere not strong or well you owe it
to yourself to make the following test: See
how long yiu can vork or how far you can
walk without Occurring tired. Next take two
five-grain tablets of ordinary nuxated iron
three times per day after meals for two
weeks. Then test your strength again and
see for yourself how much you have gained.
There is nothing like good old iron to helo
put color in your cheek end sound, h:-a!thir
flesh on your bones. Hut you must take iroa
in a f-rm that can be easily absorbed and
assimilated like nuxated iron if you want it
to do you any good, otherwise it may ppfcva
worse than useless.

The Supreme Christmas Joy ,
(To His Sister,' Mrs. Douglas Robson)
. White House, December 26, 1903.
We had a delightful Christmas yes
terdayjust such a Christmas 30 or
40 years ago we used to have under
father's and mother's supervision iu
20th street and 57th street. At seven
all the children came into opon'the
big, bulgy stockings in our bed; Ker
ihit's terrier, Rllan ,a most friendly
little dog, adding to the children's de
light by occupying the middle of tho
bed. From Alice jto Quentin, each
child wa sabsorbed in his or her stock
ing, and Edith certainly managed to
get thf most wonderful stocking toys.
Bob was in looking on, and Aunt Emi
ly, of course. Then, after breawfast,
we all formed up and went into the li
brary, where bigger toys were on sep
arate tables for the children. I won
der whether there can come in life a
thrill of greater exaltation anr rap
ture than that which comes to one be
tween, the ages of say six and foureen,
when the library doom is thrown open
and you walk in to see all the gifts,
like a materialized fairy land, arrayed
on your special .table?
interested as any of the children,
though I had to come back to my work
in the office b.efore it was half
through. At one period Ethel gae
up her ring for one of the tricks. It
was mixed up with the rings of five
other little girls, and then all six rings
were apparently pounded up and put
into a pistol and shot into a colection
of boxes, where five of them were sub
sequently found, each tied around a
rose. Ethel's, however, had disappear
ed, and he made believe that it had
vanished, but at the end of the next
trick, a remarkable bottle, out of
which many different liquids had been
poured, suddenly developed a delight
ful white guinea pig, squirming and
kicking and looking exactly Ike Ad
miral Dewey, with around its neck
Ethel's ring tied by a pink ribbon.
Then it was wrapped up in a paper,
handed to Ethel ;and when Ethel
opened it, behold there was no guinea
pig, but a bunch of roses with a ring.

of Six Thousand (6000) Acres of the
BEST CITRUS FRUIT LAND IN AMERICA
The Auction Sale Begins December 10, 1919 at 10 o'Clock a. m.
SUNSET PARK, YUMA, ARIZONA
And Will Continue Daily Until All the Lands Are Offered For Sale. The Lands Are Divided
as Follows: . '
FORTY-FOUR (44) FIVE (5) ACRE TRACTS.
THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN (313) TEN (10) ACRE TRACTS.
ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY-FOUR (134) TWENTY (20) ACRE TRACTS.
ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY (160) ACRES RESERVED FOR UNITED STATES
TOWNSITE.
Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane has appraised these lands at a minimum of
$25 per acre to which must be added two per cent, of the sale price of the lands as fees for
the United States Land Office. The construction charges have been officially estimated at
$200 ptr acre, making the minimum $225.50. per acre. Payments are as follows:
TEN PER CENT, cash on day of sale ;
FIFTEEN PER CENT, within sixty days thereafter if bid shall have been approved by
Secretary Lane;
TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT, one year after date of approval;
TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT, two years after date of approval;
TWENTY-FIVE PER CENT, three years after date of approval
ii
With interest, at six per cent, on all deferred payments. The entire amount may be
paid before due, whereupon patent for land will issue. This is the rarest opportunity cf a
lifetime to obtain a citrus fryit grove in the only district in the United States that is immune
from injurious frost.
The Yuma Mesa Citrus Fruit ripens earlier and the fruit contains more juice and more
sugar than any citrus fruit in the United States. Yuma Mesa Oranges, Grapefruit and
Lemons take first prize wherever exhibited. ' Fruits from the Yuma Mesa's twenty-f ive-year-cli
grove have never been damaged by frcst, while in size, color and flavor they are unsur
passed. The lands to be sold lie six miles immediately south of Yuma and will be irrigated
by government constructed works in connection with the great Yuma irrigation project
which is recognized as the banner irrigation project of the entire United States.
The Orange, Grapefruit and Lemon trees on the Yuma Mesa are known to have pio
duced twenty-five boxes per tree, while the celebrated Deglet Noor Date tree will produce
from four to six hundred pounds per tree,, never worth less than fifty cents per pound.
This is the destined garden spot of the world and now is your chance to purchase one
or more of these tracts. The Government limits any one person to forty acres as the max-
lmum.
Bids can be made through regular appointed power of attorney who must be furnished
with affidavit of American citizenship of purchaser as no one else can purchase or own
these lands. The lands are being sold under special act of Congress, approved by President
Wibon on January 25, 1917.
The Yuma County Chamber of Commerce cordially invites all those who want an ideal
citrus fruit grove to visit Yuma on December 1 0th and promises that all who come will
ceive a hearty welcome.
