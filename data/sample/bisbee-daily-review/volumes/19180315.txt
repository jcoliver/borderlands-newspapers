Reports from Douglas indiiate that
the time is ripe to include that ciy

that it they do no efforts will be spar

Fans in Douglas who would like to

believe that satisfactory employment
could be provided for the players such

wiile the business n.en in all proba

Douglas already has a good ball park

War Summary
i.By Revitw ltwd Wire?
On tli3 major battle fronts the oper
atiens cont.nue as for weeks past,
mainly of artillery duels, trench raids
and intensive aerial activity by all the
opposing torces. In the operations on
land the American troops continue to
locate and blow to pieces with their
artillery gas projectors in the Toul
region which the Germans recentlv
have been attempting to set up in
large numbers in preparation. It ts be
lieved, for a gas attack on a huge
scale. "
American aerial observers have been
doing fplendid work spotting out tbl
gas tubes and reporting their where
abouts to the artillery. Not alone are
the gas throwing implements coming
in for attention by the American gun
ners, but German batteries, trenches
wire entanglements and points of mil
itary concentration and munition
dumps also are being given demon
strations of the accuracy of the Amer
ican gunners.
79 Hun Planes Engaged
With the return of good weather
many airmen daily are to be seen over
the battle line dropping bombs or In
aerial combats. The British, French
and German air services all are claim
ing numerous victories for their avia
tors in fights in the air. During the
first ten days of March British airmen
are credited with accounting for 7J
German planes, while the German war
office asserts that on Wednesday 17
enemy machines and three captive bal
loons were destroyed by German air
men along the Franco-Belgian front.
The situation in Russia and Siberia
apparently is still far from being set
tled. Although the Germans and Aus
tro Hungarians Ftill control territory
from Finland to Odessa on the Black
Sea, it is not certain that the Russians
will not again take up arms against
them. The Bolshevik! foreign minis
ter Trotzky, has asserted that he will
oppose the ratification of the peace
treaty with Germany and advocates
the reorganization of the army for the
defense of Russia.
Sub Hospital Ship
Meagre advices from Constantinople
indicate that with the evacuation by
the Russians of sections of Turkish
Armenia, the Tnrks are again harrass
ing the Armenians, but that the Ar
menians are offering resistance. Er
rerum. the principal city in Armenia,
already has been re-occupied by the
Turks.
Another case of frightfulness" by
German submarine commanders is
chronicled in a report of an attempt
to send the British hospital ship Guil
ford Castle, with 45!) sick or wounded
soldiers on board, to the bottom. Not
withstanding the plain markings of the
ship, two torpedoes were launched
against it. One of the missiles struck
the vessel's bow, badly damaging it,
but the was able to make port with
difficulty.
To Take Dutch Ships '
One million tons of Dutch shipping
which will be used in sending sup
plies to the armies of the allies or in
transporting troops to the war zones,
will be taken over by the United
States and Creat Britain next Monday
thus relieving in great measure a dire
need of countries at 'war with the Teu
tonic allies.
Hollcnd's hesitancy to come Into tho
agreement with the United States and
England, which would permit of the
use of ships flying her flag, many of
which are now lying in the allied ports
no longer is to be tolerated and next
Monday, whether she be willing or not
the vessels will be taken over under
the provisions of international law and
put into uses which are highly essen
tial to the success of the allied cause
- Holland yet has time to acquiesce
in the demands of the United States
and England and sanction the use of
her shipping, but her plea of Germa
ny's menace no longer will avail, and
there is to be no modification in the
decision of the United States and al
lies to seize all Dutch vessels through
out the world and use them.
Liberal compensation is to be award
ed owners of the vessels and all their
rights will be safeguarded. In addi
tion the export of food stuffs to Hol
land will be permitted and coal by
which Holland may resume her inter
rupted trade with her colonies will be
guaranteed.

revolution wkicb, resulted In the crea
tion of an army whose efficiency was
Ihe wonder of Europe with the Ru
sian revolution w hich had deliberately
destroyed every fighting instrument.
He cast not he slightest aspersion
on the Bolshevlkl but declared it was
obvious to the world that the course
they bad pursued had rendered them
helpless in the facef German aggres
sion. Leesmith Asks Questions.
The Bolshevik! now established a
genuine and earnest desire to re
constitute the army and would doubt
less welcome the assistance of Great
Britain In carrying out the object but
such reconstruction of the shattered
Instrument of defense could not be
accomplished in p day.
H. B. Leesmith liberal, for North
ampton, who several days ago notif
ied tb3 house of his intention, asked
Mr. Balfour whether he ould give the
house any Information regarding the
Intentions of Japan in Asiatl Russia
and what wa sthe attitude of Great
Britain on this subject Lord Robert
Cecil, he said had made a statement
on the subject that was of a startling
character and most unfair at Uie pre
sent time. There was not the slight
est evidence, be d?clared, In support
of the statement that a large number
of German prise ners in Siberia had
bee narmed and that a German general
was on the way to organize them.
There wes no evidence that Germany
was going to play in the allies' hands
and difsiprte her forces by a mad ex
pedition Into Sierta. If the allies oc
cupied Russia's eastern provinces,
they could not at the peae confer
ence be abl eto raise their voice on
behalf of the world for Uthunia or
Rumania.
Praises Wilson's Message. 1
He dwelt upon the fact that Presi
dent Wilson the only allied statesman
to send a message to the Moscow
conference and declared that thu
avowed policy and language of Presi
dent Wilson were quite at variance
with those of Lord Robert Cecil which
contemplated a policy which wrould
mean that Japan would have to make
war en Uie Soviet government of Rus
sia, because if she entered Russia, she
would b"? resisted by the Russian So
viet troops. If Japan entered Russian
territory seized and' occupied It at
the mandate of the alliance. It fol
lowed with almost absolute certainty
that this territory would not be re
turned. Asked by a member "Why not" Mr.
Leesmith replied:
"Did Japan return Korea?"
Mr. Leesmith said that Great Brit
ain would follow the line of policy
laid down y President Wilson. If
she did not, but gave way to the de
sires of Japan, she would notbe act
ing for her own best intereri. for Rus
sia, notwithstanding what had hap
pened, would remain a great country
and when sh3 revived, democratic and
stronger. Great Britain would be giad
to have ier as a friend.
Balfour Replies.
I there was the slightest founda
tion for Mr. Leesmlth's- , contention
'hat whenever foreign troops invade
a country they Inevitably stay there
9nd annex it, said the foreign secre
tary. It was a very bad outlook fcr
northern France.
Mr. Balfour considered that Mr.
Leesmlth's idea that if Japan sent
troops to Siberia she was certain to
remain there was absurd and he be
lieved that Mr. Leesmith failed to re
alize the conditions in Russia. Mr.
Balfour did not think for a moment
that Germany was likely to try to send
an army to Vladivostok. It must be
remembered that Japan, in aty such
movement, would be a friend of Rus
sia against Germany, and as things
were now It was costly for Russia to
offer any resistance to German pene
tration. Could not Mr. Leesmith see that
Ru-eia was now a drllect upoa tre
waters which no power of resistance
whatever and that there would be
German penetration from end to end
of Russia that would be disastrous
for Russia.
"I believe the house does nto know
how far this penetration has already
gone," said Mr. Balfour. 'I suspect
tc a: at this moment a German officer
wculd be much safer traveling through
Russia tian would an allied oflker.
Only one bank is allowed at Moscow,
and that is a Carman bank.'
"If Russia has destroyed every ins
trument of self protection she ence
pois(g.-ed w hy can't the allies supply
wrat she now lacks. It would not be
done to satisfy Greed but because the
slliss believe Germany is penetrating
through the whole of that vat empire,
net by vast armies traveling from the
east to tt-? west, but by methods per
lectly well known to Germany.
"That Is the allies' point of view
and I ask the house to consider this
nue."tion from the Russian viewpoint"
Cannot Resist Huns
"Russia sincertly desires to resist
this penetration. How can she do ?
when every instrument to make'resist
ance possible has been destroyed? 1
do not think thnt Germany will try tc
send great organized forces from Riga
to S'ladivostok; that would be an 011
eration of great difficulty and, from
a purely military viewpoint, an unnec
essary and even fatal waste of time
Russia is a country of surprises and
it is impossible to predict her future.
But the thing most to be feared from
Kus-iia is that it is Germany's interest
to foster and promote disorder. It has
alwnys ben Germany's game that oth
er countries should be weak and sh';
knows that thero is no better way than
in ni.iUng them divided. What would
be the result of this disorder and di
vision? Men w ill at least look around
and iay to themrelves:
" This condition is Intolerable and
makes life Impossible. Something
mint be done, good or bad, to terini
nate the chaos.' ''
Mr. Balfour said he was unable to
see how without external help Russia
vas going to resist this German mal
adv. adding:
"Therefore, the question we .had to
ask ourselves was. could any of th-
allie; go to Russia In her extremity '

war department has reduced every
thing to diagrams showing the present
status in each branch and progress be
ing made."
Senator Hitchcock added that all
questions asked by the senators had
been answered mlly by the men who
are In direct charge of the work, frank
ly disclosing every element of the war
work in which the department was be
hind schedule and the steps being tak
en to remedy the difficulties.
Aviation Work Behind
In some respects, the senator said,
notably in the aviation program, therj
had been great delay and the war coun
cil has initiated an investigation to de
termine the cause. Another member
of the committee said the aviation pro
gram was 74 percent behind schedule
aad that over-sanguine reports wen
being inquired into.
Shipping tonnage available, reportea
by representatives on the council of
the shipping board and also by Major
General Goethals, in charge of embar
kation of men and supplies, shows an
encouraging increase. Senator Hitch
cock said. More tonnage is now avail
able, the work of shipment has been
systematized, and the round trip to Eu
ropean ports is taking a shorter time.
The committee was shown a summa
ry of activities on all fronts in Europe
prepared by the army war college, a
member of which was present to ex
plain the movements noted. Cable
grams from General Pershing received
yesterday were also read, showing ac
tivities on his front and his supply and
requirement .seeds. v
Army Officers Elated
Army officers generally were elated
at learning that out of the storm of
criticism in congress against the de
partment has grown this new ;o!i-:y.
They believe, and members of the sen
ate committee shared this vic.. that
through the close cooperation now fore
cast between the executive and legis
lative branches good will come with
added speed in getting the army u
France.
In connection with the brighter out
look on shipping reported. It was learn
ed that recently a transport made th-j
round trip to the debarkation port in
France in 29 days. That is evidence
that bteps taken to clear away the con
gestion In the debarkation ports havo
been effective. Previously laden ships
have waited at these ports for days,
even wesks, for opportunity to unload.
Trips sometimes required from fifty to
sixty days.

WILLIAMS. HART IN
"THE NARROW TRAIL"
PICTURE AT CENTRAL
Western Drama Ons of BesI
Films in Which Artcraft
Screen Star Hes App;ared;
Plays "Bad Man."
When Thomas H. Ince Introduces
his famous star. William S. Hart, to
Central Datrons of. Artcraft pictures.
q he will depict a rare bit of life In the
Narrow Trail." at the Central theatre
today only. Hart has the role of a west
ern highwayman who ventures into n
typical "honky-tonk" of a decade ago.
and the motion picture audiences will
see presented with graphic vividness
the sensational features of night life
that made this particular section of
San Francisco notorious the world
over.
Nothing like the Barhary Coast has
lever been known. It occupied a niche
of its own underworld history. Here
I all sorts of crimes were plotted and
! Perpetrated Here were drawn the
ureg vi criminal ui K-iuiaiiuns irom
foreign fields, as well as this country,
and here crimes thrived and blossomed
and succeeded as nowhere else In all
the world. Port Said, reputed to be a
'bad town." was a kindergarten com
pared whh San Francisco's Barbary
' f31. in J''? perio1
And it
Is this period that Is so wonderfully
reproduced in Hart's "The Narrow
Trail."
' An effort
to "shanghai" the big.
j rugged western highwayman results
I In a fight that for sheer spectacular
! features has no parallel in screen bat
, ties.
. Into the life of this outlaw comes a
; beautiful girl, his ideal of all that is
! good and pure. After the greatest
; fight he has evar experienced a ba
: tie with himself he gives up his fol
; lowing and hunts up the girl to start
life anew. Suddenly, his ideals stran
' g!ed through a horrible revelation, he
j believes himself misled and his new
. faith in the good side of life is shat
: tered.
Through the scenes which depict
: these evolutions in the career of this
man ,of prairie. W.lliam S. Hart
! ravel8 ith rea"8 will mark
as a much greater actor than even
his many thousands of ardent adniir
ers proclaim him to be.
"The Narrow Trail" Is the great
film feature which was used by Grau
nians when he opened his million dol
lar Palai theatre in Los Angeles sev
eral weeks ago.
WILLARD AND FULTON
CONFER ABOUT TITLE
RING BATTLE JULY 4
(Bv Review Leased Wire)
KANSAS CITY. Mo., March 14.
Whether Jess Willard. heavyweight
champion, and Fred Fulton of Minne
sota, aspirant to the title, are to be
matched for a bout July 4. remained
problematical tonight, after a confer
ence here late today between Mike
Collins, msnager of Fulton and Colo
nel J. C. Miller, of Oklahoma, repre
senting Willard.
The conference did not get ibeyond
the financial discussion stage although
the two men parted with the under
standing that they would meet again.
The sum mentioned was not di-
I vulged. but Fulton's manager said he
1 was unable to consider the offer. At
! the conference he informed Miller that
I he would guarantee Willard J 100,000
1 to tight Fulton in New Orleans on July
4 nothing definite concerning the
latter proposal has transpired.

Our City Affairs
Good for the Citizens Non-Partison
league! It has come out squarely for a
stronger, simpler, straighter system of city
government. It would do away with the
professional politician and office- seeker pie
counter and make the matter of .governing
Bisbee what- it was intended that every
city government should be when the fathers
of this republic laid the foundations of af
fairs in revolutionary days, which is to say,
a business proposition based upon freedom
and efficiency.
The basis and strength, yea, the cause of
all republics, is the desire of the people, the
producers, the doers, to be governed by
themselves. This aim is defeated unless
the average citizen, the shopkeeper, the
clerk, the workman, the doctor, lawyer,
artisan, is called to-office directly from his
bench, counter or desk. The man who is
a good workman, a successful shopkeeper,
a skilled doctor, or keen lawyer? is the man
best fitted to administer his city affairs.
The man who works hard in his own be
half has acquired habits of industry suffi
cient to carry him through a term of city
office" with credit. He has pride in himself
and his record that spurs him on. It is a
wise people that select the workers and the
doers to handle their affairs.
That is whr the non-partisan idea has
come to be almost general in the cities and
towns of the United States. The profes
sional politician and office holder has killed
the goose that laid the golden gg of an
easy and fat job. Graft arid incompetency
have come to be proverbial in the affairs
of the cities cf this nation. Hence the grad
ual elimination of party tickets and the
coming of "Citizens" and "Indepedent"
tickets the country over.
However, there are no charges of graft
in Bisbee; no particular scandal in connec
tion with our city affairs. But, neverth
less, the city is sadly in need of a forceful,
progressive, efficient administration.
Strong, successful; representative men
should be drafted, from their business and
their work to do something for their com
munity. Improvements should be made that are
permanent. Most of our city streets are a
joke. They have to.be improved and re
paired three or four times a year. More
money is spent every few years for these
improvements than permanent streets
would cost. Bisbee needs sidewalks ; needs
a parking place for aufos. Needs more
water for yards. Needs more street lights.
Needs cheaper utilities. Needs stricter reg
ulations as regards a half dozen things. Ev
ery citizen who ha3 the good of the city at
heart wishes it to be made a more attractive
place in which to live. Wonders have al
ready been accomplished in this canyon;
but there are wonders yet to do to make it
all that it can and should be made as a
modern city.
This Non-Partisan league has started
right. It has called safe and strong men
to the front and promulgated a platform
that promises much for the district. Jacob
Erickson, called to run again for mayor,
has already shown himself possessed of the
two imperative attributes for a good mayor,
he has been honest and h has been courag
eous. Plain spoken, seeking not to curry
public favor, simple and direct in all his
public acts, he is just the man to carry on
the work planned by the Non-Partisan
league. And the candidates for council
drafted to serve with him are men with rec
ords behind them. Every one of them will
have to sacrifice his personal affairs and
business to serve on the council, and these
are the kind of men needed right now for
the city's executive body.
This is a rich district. A great volume
of business ebbs and flows in the canyon
The district will grow richer and the busi
ness will grow greater. To keep the cily
up and abreast and worthy of this unex
ampled prosperity is the duty of the cily
government. To govern and improve and
regulate the city for the greatest benefit for
the most people is the ideal that every pub
lic man and institution should seek to at
tain in his trusteeship to his fellow citizens.
The league has started right. It is up to
the people here generally to see that the
work is carried on to a successful accom
plishment After scanning the editorial columns of
a score or more of representative dailies
from all sections of the country. The Re
view is convinced that the president's pol
icy of hands off in Siberia has but little sup
port in America. The situation is' such a3
to demand instant action. Japan should be
asked to throw all the troops she can possi
bly spare into Siberia and wage aggressive
war against the Bolsheviki and German
forces there. They work together, these .
two, the Bolsheviki and the Prussian, and
have been doing so steadily for six months.
Every move they have made in relation to
each other has been the move calculated to
hurt the entente the most. These moves
are too regular and have too much the same
purpose not to be deliberate and the result
of a plan. For the allies to blind their eyes
to the facts is to court disaster. Strike!
Strike now! Strike with the aid of Japan .
through Siberia. It 13 the only effective way
by which the Prussian power can be check
ed in the east at this time. If Japan will
move NOW with her full military force in
to Siberia and wage offensive war upon the
Bolsheviki and the Germans and Austrians.
it will savej a million French, English and
American lives on the western battle front.
It is authoriatively stated that the Cossacks
and the more loyal and intelligent Russians
desire Japanese aid. Anything rather than
sure serfdom under the kaiser.
Elihu Root, than whom there is no great
er American today, greeted the English
archbishop visiting" our shores, with the fol
lowing message of soul-stirring patriotism,
which is sure to find a responsive thrill ar.d
glow in every loyal heart: "We are with
you in heart and soul, in judgment and con
viction; -in purpose and determination,
proud to be with the mien who have shown
the manhood, the heroism, the" high cour
age, the self-devoticn, the willingness to
die for liberty, that the men of Great Brit
ain have shown in these times. We arc
proud that our laws, our system of justice,
our conception of liberty, our customs,
come from these fathers out of whose loins
sprang the men in the trenches upon the
British line. The future of your children
and ours depends upon the same struggle,
for if the Germans' conception of govern
ment in this world is to control, your chil
dren, and ours, will not be free."
Germany still insistes that the United
States has only a division of troops (27,
000 men) in France. But then, this is a big
admission for Germany, as it will be re
membered that when Pershing's first army
went into quarters in France last fall the
Germans claimed that only a battallion
(600 men) of American troops. were in
France. If Germany admits that the Amer
ican army has increased fifty times over
its first strength, then General Pershing
must have a considerable army by this ,
time. The fact is," over a half million
American troops are in France and most
of them will take part in the fighting next'
summer and Germany knows it and is pre
paring her people a little at a time for un
favorable eventualities.
Douglas International: The mining in
dustry in the Chiricahua mountains is show
ing increased activity. During the past year
several new companies have started devel
opment work in the section around the Hill
top properties which has been under de
velopment for four years and which now
is regarded a3 a practically proven mine
with prospects of large production in the
future. Among the newer companies in
that vicinity are the Hilltop Extension, the
Ajax, the Nippers and others. These com
panies are on the east side of the range.
On the west side and in the Dos Cabezas
district there is considerable increased ac
tivity and with the Mascot making regular
shipments of copper ore to the Sasco smelter.
Secretary Baker is on the western front.
He will see a practical demonstration of the
Lewis gun there if he gets close enough to
the firing line.
Trotsky has resigned, but Lenine holds
on still. His Potsdam checks were larger

BISBMHRY
George Roberts, Thirty-six
Years a Resident of District,
Honored By Hundreds Who
Attend Funeral.
A mini's man, material worthy of the
very best traditions of the big hearted.
impulsive, generous, honest through
and through type of the old days, tho
man trying days of the pioneering peri
od in Arizona's isolated metal dis
tricts, was laid to rest yesterday after
noon in Bisbee cemetery.
George Kooerts, was the name. Few
old timers in the Southwest but have
aeard it; not a few but have distinct
occasion to remember It with gratitude
tor many is the one in other days.
Kindlier days, to whom the hand ot
George Kooerts went out in aid in one
way of another and without the left
jand knowing that which the right did.
Hundreds yesterday afternoon as
sembled at the Palace Undertaking
chaoel to pay their last respects and
to join in sorrow of that kind which is
bcrne with the passing of a good
frieud. George Roberts was such with
ail whom he knew who traveled
straight, and he had been the good
friend of many a man whose footsteps
had faltered on the narrow path, and
many he helped back to the right road
None, indeed, might be more worthy
of the gathering of throngs at his bier
and the piling high of flowers, than
this man, and so it was that tht
throng yesterday filled the chapel and
overflowed far Into the street, while
the fiowers were banked high.
George Roberts had been a resident,
of Bisbee for more than 36 years. He
came here from a farm in the middle
west to go to work in the restaurant
cf his sister-in-law. The Can-Can was
the restaurant, and in its door, as she
looked out on Main street to see what
was going on. the proprietress met
her death soon after the arrival of the
young man. the tragedy of her death
being a part of that enacted in-lhe
famed bandit raid upon the camp. Sub
sequently Mr. Roberts settled the af
fairs of the restaurant and engaged in
business for himself.
Later, when the Spanish Americas
war came, he was among the first in
the ranks of the Rough Riders with
Buckey O'Neill's gallant crowd. After
the war he came back to Bisbee and
j reengaged in business. He made ion-
1 ey easily and be disbursed it Just as
readily among those whom he felt
needed it more than he did. He was
never rich, except in friends, although
at various times he was comfortably
situated in worldly goods. At the time
of his death his possessions were rep
resented chiefly in a ranch in the Sul
phur Springs valley. ' upon which he
! hsd soent a good deal of money in de-
velomnent and improvements.
He hid pursued mining to some ex
tent, but mostly through advances to
miors and prospectors who needed
j assistnce to go on with their plans
-iui ;anors. in me course 01 nis con
tact with the industry he gathered ni
the earlier days a remarkable collec
tion of specimens of copper ore, said
to have been one of the most compre
hensive and finest in the country. Up-,
on his retirement frrmrt business sever-
al years ago. he disposed of the great
er part of the exhibit to I. W. Wallace,
in whose possession it now Is. -His
life had its deep griefs and tri
als, but he fought the game bravely
and within himself. His trouliles were
never the burden of others. For his
fallow beings' he always had a cheerv
smile and a warm hand, and in his
passing to the cemetery yesterday
with escort of the Elks and the Frater
nal Order of Eagles, and a host of sor
rowing friends, the . world became
poorer.

of Schwerdt and his associates to min

for German interests to hoard grea
stocks of wool which might be sent to
Germany when peace is concluded.
