NEW YORK. Mar. 14. An apS
peal to the partriotism of thf
member of the four great rail
road brotherhoods to refrain from
any "rath movement" which
would bring an industrial warfare
in the pretrnt national crisis was
made here tonight by the nation

ways on the eve of the conference
tomorrow with the chiefs of the
trainmen's organizations. There
were additional indications, how
ever, that the brotherhood:, were
determjned to call a strike unless
their demands were granted.
Unions Stand Pat
After a meeting here with several
hundred general chairmen and chair
men of the? locals in the brotherhoods
organizations on lines entering New
York, W. G. Lee, president of the
brotherhood of railroad trainmen, an
nounced that unanimous support had
been voted the brotherhood demands
and the course they plan to take.
Terms Modified
These demands he said, would ,be
based on the modified demands of last
December, which called for a basic
eight hour day and pro-rata pay for
overtime. This is virtually what the
Adamson law would give if put Into
force, he said. The original program
of the men, the refusal of which re
sulted in the call last September of
the strike, which was averted by the
passage of the Adamson net. included
an eivht hour basic day with time and
& half for overtime. Mr. Lee indicat
ed that there was no intention of go

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. March 14. Full
cooperation to make a strike effec
tive will be given by the American
Federation of Labor if the railroads
reject the demands of the employes'
bi'jtherhood.s. No immediate sympa
thetic strikes are contemplated, fed
eration officials said tonight, but tiie
brotherhood chiefs have been assured
of prompt support in every other way ,
possible.
Officials of the federation's railroad
department, representing more than
400,000 shop employes, switchmen,
telegraphers and maintenance of way ;
laborers not affiliated with the bro-1
therhoods, conferred at length today.
It was said the first move if the strike
comes will be to admonish all union ,
men not to offer to replace strikers. '
When the brotherhoods threatened
a strike last fall, railroads began en
rolling other classes )t workmen to
act as engineers, firemen, conductors
and trainmen, and many of these were
said to ha,-e been shop employes or
switchmen. Since then, however, the
four brotherhoods, not on over-friendly
terms with the federation, have af
fected a working agreement with Its
leaders. I

United States on March 3, at 123,06:!,

The reports show that the number
tied up has decreased approximately
28 per cent since February 17. Effects
of the ork toward relieving conges

ther reduction.
Plans rbr a general strike of all
other railroad employes have been
discussed but the belief generally ex
pressed was that no good could be
accomplish by suddenly calling out all
union men at this time.
President Wilson is ready to act
promptly should the nation-wide rail
road strike threatened beginning Sat
urday really prove imminent after the
conference in New York tomorrow.
Any action is expected to take the
form of a demand in the public in
terests that the two sides settle their
differences in view of the grave in
ternational situation.
Through Secretary Wilson and mem
bers of the federal board of mediation
and conciliation the President kept in
close touch with the situation today.
Secretary Wilson said tonight that he
did not plan to go to New York per
sonally to deal with the situation, and
would not discuss the question of
whether another government repre
sentative would go.

(By Review Leased Wire)
"WASHINGTON. Mar. 14. Former
Ambassador Gerard, fresh from Iier
lin. reported to the state department
today that. when he left there Germa
ny fully intended carrying out her
ruthless submarine campaign, regard
less of the prospect of war with the
United States and that talk, of peace
had been abandoned.
The former ambassador did not see
President Wilson because the Presi
dent is still confined to his room, but
he conferred at length with both Sec
retary Lansing and Counsellor Polk,
and went over with them in detail
events leading to the break In diplo
matic relations between Germany and
the United States.
Bank All On "Subs"
Mr. Gerard reported that German
officials apparently considered the
consequences of submarine ruthless
ness before rroclHimlng it and as far
as he could learn were confident of its
success. When he left Berlin, how
ever, the campaign was only in its
second week and the Germans were
still predicting the destruction of a
million tous of shipping a mouth, the
amount admitted by Teutonic experts
to be essential for an effective starva
tion blockade of England. Since then,
vowever. te average destruction has
been below half that.
Germans Not Starving
Food conditions in Germany when
Mr. Gerard's party left were reported
as serious, but not necessarily criti
cal. This question is looked upon by
the American government as very im
oortant because of its bearing upon
the possibility of further peace moves
bv Germanv In the nar future
The former ambassador arrived here
from Key West. Fla., shortly after
noon and was met at the station by a
group of officials. A formal statement
was given out by Mr. Gerard saving
he would make his report to the gov
ernment aud would not talk for publi
cation. He will ko to New York to
morrow for a formal reception to be
tendered him there Friday.
Tells of Treatment
The report made by the former am
bassndor, to the state department was
understood to deal particularly with
the treatment accorded himself and
other Americans following the break
in diplomatic relations, the efforts of
the German government to get liim
to re-affirm the old treaty of 1SJS with
extensive changes, the general atti
tude of the German government and
public towards submarine wnrfare,
neace and relations with the United
States and conditions in Germany.
The department presented a scene of
unusual activity with the many re
turned diplomats who accompanied
Mr. Gerard reporting to their superi
ors. Some of them will be kept at the
department and .other will be given
new posts.
While officials are extremely anx
ious to learn the personal opinions of
men fresh from Germany, there is not
the slightest disposition to feel that
the international situation can be af
fected in any way at this time. Ger
many is believed to have shown her
self in the series of sinkings such as
the Laconia. the California and many
others, including the American steam
ship Algonquin, reported today sunk

For several days past attacks
by the opposition in parliament

came the war director or France.

To inaugurate a plan of de

The submarine opened fire on

These were not sufficient to sink
the steamer, so she was boarded
by men from the submarine who

(Continued From Tage One) I
the navy orders will be given the'
light of way. The chief difficulty is
in obtaining engines for all types 01
navy raft, including the new- coast
patrol boats soon to be ordered in
considerable numbers. A plan for the
co-ordination of the engine building
capacity of the country may be nec
essary. The department has sought
information from the electric boat
and Lake Torpedo Boat Company, the
two concerns building navy submar
ines, as to the number of boats each
could complete within six months.
Replies have not yet been received.
Congress provided that the. 3S new
boats should be of the S0O ton type,
and the department's present specifi
cations call for increased speed and
other changes from the three boats ol
filename size already ordered. In the
interests of speedy construction, how
ever, the new plans may be abandon
id and last year's boats be duplicat
ed. Pians Tor the three 42.000 ton bat
tleships are not yet ready for distri
bution to builders. It is indicated
that attention is to be turned to other
parts of the building program for the
present as the battleships. In any
cvent, will require a long time to con
struct. More than 15 destroyers probably
will be- ordered at once. Congress
provided specifically for this number,
but granted additional authority un
der its emergency application clause
for the construction of small craft.

Take a glass of Salts before
breakfast if your Back hurts
or Bladder is troubling you.
No man or wo:nar. who cuts meat
regularly can make a mistake by Hush
ing the kidneys occasionally, sayo a
well-known authority. Meat forms uric
acid which excites the kidneys, they
become over-worked from the strain,
get sluggish and fail to filter the
waste and poisons from the blood, then
we get sick. Nearly all rheumatism,
headaches, liver trouble, nervousness,
dizziness, sleeplessness and urinary
disorders come from sluggish kidneys.
The moment you feel a dull ache in
the kidneys or your tack hurts or if
the urine is cloudy, offensive, full of
sediment, irregular of passage or at
tended by a sensation of scalding, stop
eating meat and get about four ounces
of Jad Salts from any pharmacy; take
a tablespoonful in a glass of water be
fore breakfast and in a few days your
kidneys will act fine. This famVms
salts is made from the acid cf grapes
land lemon juice, combined with lithia.
and has been used for generations to
flush and stimulate the kidneys, also
to neutralize the acids in urine so it
no longer causes irritation, thus end-
Jing bladder weakness.
j Jad Salts is inexpensive and cannot
(injure; makes a delightful effervescent 1
! lithia-water drink which everyone I

kitlneys clean and active and tho

A Senate Chairmanship.
While the United States senate grapples with the pro'i
lem of abolishing its absurd "unanimous consent" rule
and establishing the governing right of the majority,
it faces another, and a closely related problem 'of im
portance. The senate is handicapped by the "rule of
seniority," which gives the chairmanship and control of
a committee automatically to the member of the domin
ant party who has served on that committee longest.
Ordinarily the rule seems to work no great harm. It
puts mediocre men in the chair and suppresses abler
men merely because of their shorter service, yet business
gets itself done somehow or other. But when such a
situation arises as that existing on the foreign relations
committee, the rule is open to challenge.
Ordinarily this committee attracts little attention.
Now it is the most important cf all committees, because
the foreign problems with which it has to deal have be
come the most important problems of government. Sen
ator Stone, holding the chairmanship by right of senior
ity, in the last session broke completely with the admin
istration and with an overwhelming majority of the sen
ate. There has been seen lately the spectacle, whjch
would be incredible in any other capital in the world, of
the chairman opposing a program favored by his own
committee, by the president, by congress as a whole and
by tin nation.
No one questions Senator Stone's right to hold his own
opinions on foreign affairs, and to express them on the
floor of the senate, even if he stands alone. But it is re
garded as anomalous and intolerable that under such
circumstances he should continue at the head of his com
mittee. Many senators of his own party are trying to
persuade him to resign. If he refuses it is said that an
attack will be made to unseat him.
Such action would be unusual but not without preced
ent No less a statesman than Charles Sumner was re
moved from the chairmanship of the committee on for
eign relations, in 1871, merely because he differed "with
President Grant on his Santo Domingo policy,
t
Villa Fades Again.
Our picturesque an delusive friend, Pancio Villa, is
said to have vanished again. His latest campaign to re
gain control of northern Mexico seems to Lave struck
a snag just when the outside world began to think that
the- bandit chief was really "coming back." He is now
said to hare definitely given up bis operations against
Chihuahua City, disbanded his army and gone into retire
ment. That retirement, it may be assumed, it not for prayer
and meditation. Oue story has it that Panclio, with a
picked force of 300 men, hopes to surprise and capture
Carranza. That would be a fine practical joke worthy of
Villa's best days. A more likely explanation, however, is
that the old wound in his leg which has kept him laid up
for a year, is bothering him again, and his general health
is bad. It takes a healthy man to hold a Mexican army to
gether. .
Whatever his reason, Villa's disappearance is a good
omen. It serves at least to help simplify a complicated
situation. Villa has been cur open, avowed and implaca
ble enemy ever since our government shelved Jiim in fa
vor of Canan.i. The latter may be just as hostile at
heart, but lie will probably stop short of active enmity.
And if it comes to the worst, mid the "Kirat Chief" makes
war on the United States in alliance with Germany, it s
better to have Villa in the tall timber than lined up with
Carranza. With those two leaders united against us, we'd
have our hands full.
of the Germans to cause an estrangement tjetween Japan
and the United States as by their complete failure to ap
preciate the aims and ideals of other nations.
"Nothing is more repugnant to our sense of honor'and
to the lasting welfare of our country than to betray our
friends and allies in this time of trial and to become a
party to a combination directed against the Unite!
States, to whom we are bound not only by the sentiments
of true friendship but also by material interests of vast
and far-reaching importance.
"The proposal which is reported to have been planned
by the German foreign office has not been communicated
to the Japanese gcverrment up to this moment, officially
or unofficially, but should it ever come to hand. I can con
ceive no other form of reply than that of indignant and
categorical refusal."
Te-e is no apparent reason why any American should

Holland's Dilemma.
Our maritime troubles are serious enough, but Hol
land's are worse. Germany sinks the Dutch merchant
men if they venture to sea, and England threatens lo
confiscate them if they don't.
This British me iace is something new. A British dip
lomat explains thrt it the Dutch ships refuse to exercise
I their lawful right of sailing in defiance of the German
decree, they will thereby be acquiescing in the German
policy, and will thus be guilty of unneutral action aud
subject to "retaliatory measures" on the part of Great
Britan. It would be a natural and justifiafible move, I'e
ladds, to retaliate by requisitioning the Dutch ships now
in English harbors.
Such measures, it appears, would not be adopted against
the United States because we have not only protested
against the German policy, as Holland has done, but have
undertaken to defend our shipping. Otherwise our ships,
too, would be liable to seizure.
We're grateful for the assurance. But if Great Britain
is wise, she won't adopt such a policy against Holland or
any other country.

Japanese Friendship.
It was worth while to have the Japanese scars brought
up again just to have it so thoroughly disposed of. The
German proposal to win Japan, away from the United
states and launch h'T against the United Ftatcs as a
German ally ha.; failed completely. Mere than that, ii
lias served lo bring from Japan rmpliatir assurances of
her good' will toward America.
On top of the official assurances given to our govern
ment by tile Japanese government. Prime Minister Tor
auehi, in response to a request from the Chicago IJeeorU.
cabled this statement for the benefit of Ihe Ainci ic.i:i
public:
"We are surprised nt so murh by the persistent efforts
Too Proud to Economize.
"We Americans do not want to eat rice!" cried a dele
gation or New York women who called on the mayor to
Totcct against the advice given by h:s fooa committee,
""nt the. women wanted, they explained, was the foods
'hey were accustomed to, at the old prices.
It was a natural and pardonable desire. But the atti
tude of those women revealed a typical weakness on the
-art of the American public.
We want to live economically, but we will not change
t habits and tastes in order to make the economy pos
sible. If steak goes up to 35 cents a pound, and cabbage
o 30 cents a head, and potatoes to $1.20 a peck, we must
have our steak and cabbage and potatoes just the same.
The mere fact Uiat there are foods in the market far
cheaper and no less nourishing makes little difference.
The example of wise acquiescence in the use of substi
tutes set us by the European belligerents, particularly
"y the Germans, seems to have little effect.
Our people scorn substitutes. They will net adopt
them except spasmodically, ia the course of temporary
nnd rather futile boycotts of their accustomed commod
t;es. Inevitably they return to the high-priced foods ct
the earliebt opportunity.
We're too proud to economize.

L
Germans in Mexico.
Possibly too much has been made of the hegira of Ger
mans from the United Slates to Mexico. It is true that
many thousands of German reservists, who happened to
lie living in this country for one reason or another, have
Tone to Mexico in the last few months or weeks. It ts
true that the attitude of the Carranza government is
"'or 'VjHous. it is true that iu case of open hostility
between Mexico aud the United States those Gern-.am
iuifeht take up amis against us. Put very likely both the
cxteut of this iui,;ruUou aud the significance of it have
btcn exaggerated.
Take the ca:e of a German subject caught ' in this
wintry on ti e ev of an anticipated war between Ger
many and tlio I.'nitcd Stales. What is more natural t':a"
that we should want to get out, and avoid the possibility
of being peuned up in a concentration 'camp? it isn't
likely that our government would interfere with the free
dom of German subjects, if they be.-.aved themselves
properly, but the men concerned do not feel sure of that.
All the experience of Germans living in enemy countries
at the outbreak of the European war tends to make them
tear the worst and get out while they can.
And having decided to leave, what is more natural than
that th"y slioul-l go to Mexico? The Allies control llio
I :u;d will let thctii through. Canada bars them.
! Mi xico is the nearest refuge.
There arc uiniuestiiiiialily mativ Germans of intlucmc
Mid aiiliiy. trained army ottieers in particular, who haw
en ordered by their .home government to proceed to
M"i', in furtherance of Germany's secret pffins. But
there is no rea I'll to suppose thai all residents of Gei
ni. hi origin ileparliu for Mexico are actuated by similar
motives.

From Ray
Says (12)
"I read something the other
day that a chap had said
about TODAYS POSSI
BILITIES being TOMOR
ROW'S REALITIES."
That looks like it might be meant
to apply to
judging from the favorable re
ports that we are receiving from
the scene of operations at Ray. In
fact we were never more satisfied
than rioht at this time, THAT THE
POSSIBILITIES OF ARIZONA
