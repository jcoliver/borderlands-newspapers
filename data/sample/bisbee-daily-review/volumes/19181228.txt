ornaments valued at $15,000,000.
These had been brought from the

COMPANIES SEEK
Fifteen Corporations File Suit
Against Government to Re'

ments
(By Review Leased Wire)
BOSTON. Dec. 27. Suits were be
gun In the federal court here today
by 15 copper mining companies to re
cover a total of $384,000, which it is
claimed the government illegally as
sessed as income tax between the
years 1913 and 1915
The suits are the result of differ
ences between the government and of
ficers of the corporation, as to what
is capital and what is Income, as ap
plied to copper mines. It is under
stood that the principle involved will
affect far larger sums, which the gov
ernment collected for last year and
the year before.
The largest amount sought in the
suits is $125,000, by the Calumet and
Hecla Mining company, of this city.
Others include the Champion Copper
company. Allouez Mining company. St

Reports received from Germany
indicate that the present govern-.
nient there is to constitute a fed
eral republic on virtually the
same plan as the United States.
There would be a congress com
posed of two chambers, a volk

would be the chamber of repre
sentatives, and a stadtenhaus, or
chamber of the states which take
the part of a senate.
The president would be elected
by the people and would not be

The border states would be com

the nobility abolished and Ger

WASHINGTON, Dec. 27. A strik
ing tribute to the courage and skill of
Urig. Gen. Douglas MacArthur, com
manding the 84th brigade of the 42nd
(Rainbow) division, was given by Maj.
Gen. Charles T. Menoher. formerly in
command of the division, in a letter
to General Pershing urging for a
second time the promotion of General
MacArtNur to the rank of major gen
eral. A copy of the communication has
just reached Washington. It reviewed
the record of General MacArthur and
disclosed that the young officer, a
major of engineers when the United
States entered Ce war, had been
twice wounded, had been decorated by
both the French and American gov
ernments for personal gallantry in
action and in addition had been twice
recommended for the French Legion
or Honor.
Tribute to MacArthur.
"I do not feel that I am free to as
sume another command," General
Menoher wrote General Pershing, on
the eve of his transfer to the com
mand of the Sixth army corps, "with
out recording the services rendered
by Gen. Douglas MacArthur. The
contributions made to our military es
tablishment by this general ofticer
have already had far-reaching effects.
He has stood for the actual physical
command of large bodies of troop3 in
battle, not for a day. but days' dura
tion, and 1 believe, has actually com
manded larger bodies of troops in the
battle line than any other officer in
our army with, in each instance, con
spicuous success.

"He has developed, comoined and
applied the use of infantry and cor
related armies with an effect upon
the enemy, a husbandry of his own

nave Deen untiring, uninterrupted and
without the least regard for his per
sonal safety at each of the many
times when he felt his personal lead

Took Drive's Brunt.
The itemized account of General
MacArthur's services included the
statement that the 42nd division "sus
tained the full brunt" of the German
drive in the Champagne last July, and
that it was the skill and personal
supervision of this officer which made
possible a great victory. Later, dur
ing the Aisne-Marne offensive, the
42nd was driving toward the Vesle
when an incideut occurred which
General Menoher described as fol
lows: Undertook Pursuit Quickly.

President Wilson Replies
Replying to the king's address,
President Wilson said:
"1 am deeply complimented by the
gracious words which you have utter

warm .so natural, so evidently from

the Lowell officers went out to try
and find further trace of the quar
tette but were unable to do so. It
was surmised therefore, that they had
gone across the international boundry
in the vicinity of Palominas and from
there to Cananea. Brown said he
rode in the back seat of the car with
the two girls. They both talked to
him and the Freeman girl did not act
as if she was being kidnapped, though
she had ample opportunity to talk to
him and tell him if anything was
wrong.
From latest developments it be
comes plain that Miss Foreman either
wrote the note she dropped at Greater
vil'.e under stern duress or deliberate
ly assisted the convicts with their
plan to escape. Accepting the note as
of genuine intent to give information
that would lead to her rescue, officers
were thrown on an entirely wrong
scent. The note gave it positively that
the convicts were headed for Nogiles
and intended .crossing the line there.
Acting on this information, the offi
cers netted the country through which
access to Nogales could be gained.
They did this so thoroughly that it
was a matter of but a dozen hours be
fore they knew that those they sought
could not have struck for Nogales.
Instead of going to Nogales the
party turned toward the Elgin country
and remained hidden at a ranch house
for about 12 hours until the officers
had passed ahead of them and were
lost as to their whereabout They
then started to reach this section of
the country. It was not thought that
McDaniels will go to Douglas as he
is too well known there.
It has become known that Wunder
and McDaniels ran the state car about
Florence and the adjacent country
freely, both day and night. They are
reported to have consorted with wo
men and to have often had these in
the car. It is alleged that at times
they took other convicts with
them and that women Joined these on
joy rides.
The Landis girl is said to have been
frequently with the convicts on the
outside and to have invited other wo
men on the joy rides. It is possible
that she may have brought Laura
Foreman under the influence of the
men. The disclosures concerning the
conduct of the prisoners serves to re
vive the disgraceful conditions which
brought about high scandal and state
wide indigation a few years ago, when
citizens of Florence made it known
that "honor men" and other convicts
were being allowed the freedom of
the streets and 'had' become so em
boldened that women were being op
enly insulted and girls and children
terrorized.

When I condemned the militarizing of
a people as stunting individual de

"History will recognize in this two

Boasted of Leniency j
After thus quoting the emperor's
language, Prince Albert adds: I
"You afterwards talked at length to j
convince me you had no bad sentiment ,
toward France or anyone and you re-j
marked to me that you might have

The prince then relates a sensa
tional conversation in which the em
peror, pointing to a Itritish squadron
visiting Kiel, foresaw the coming of
war.
"The transformation of jour mental

English officers are about to laugh
and dance with our young women they
seem very far from dreaming of mak

Prince Albert then relates numerous
conversations when the Russian em
peror proposed an international court
at The Hague. "You disclosed to ine
one day your real thoughts upon this
noble movement in remarking to me
with a smile that you were happy to
participate in the czar'g conferences,
but did so by appointing as your dele
gate the most vigorous German gen
erals." Prince Albert's letter con
tinues: Referred to Tirpitz
"I recall also that when I asked
your support for the first internation
al marine congress you referred me
to Adjniral von Tirpiti for whom the
soul of the sailor will never have any
respect."
The prince gives a conversation
with the German crown prince as
showing his attitude toward The
Hague tribunal.
Crown Prince Appear
"Talking with the crown prince at
his Kreuth residence in Bavaria, I
complimented you on offering to set
tle the Casa Blanca affair before The
Hague tribunal. The heir to the im
perial throne answered that the chan
cellor had made a mistake in accept
ing that arrangement 'because.' said
the crown prince, 'the French are
right in that affair, but a powerful
state should never avoid war even
w hen it is In the wrong under penalty
of losing its prestige."
In another talk with Emperor Wil
liam, the prince says the emperor re
marked that he held the Russian czar
in his hands. In this connection
Prince Albert writes:
Nicholas ia Assassinated
"In the series of crimes, for which
Germany must bear responsibility
there is one which will revolt human
ity for all time. Nicholas II was in

lies. He wished to perform his duties.
not agreeing with your wishes, al
though you told me you held him in
your hands. Nicholas eluded your
suggestions, but was assassinated by
your bolsheviki accomplices without
your intervening to save him."
The prince gave extracts of letters
from Prince von Radolin, the German
ambassador to France shortly before
the war. saying. "Where are they lead
ing us? I fear a great catastrophe."
One of the emperor's letters ex
pressed solicitude for the Parisians
during the Paris floods. "These are
the same Parisians," says the prince,
"whom you bombarded, killed women
and children and the sick."
The prince relates the following:
"Your son, Eitel Fritz Hohenzollern.
showed his ideas of the right of the
strongest. He occupied the chateau at ;
Avricourt. belonging to my ministry
to France. A judicial inquiry has es
tablished that precious objects belong

(Bv Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Dec. 27. Forty American
newspaper correspondents who are
visiting London with President Wil
son ano party were entertained at
luncheon today by Lord Northcliffe
at the Times office and at dinner to
night by the Newspaper Proprietors'
association.
The principal speeches delivered at
the luncheon were by Baron Burnham,
Richard V. Oulahan of the New York
Times, David Lawrence of the New
York Evening Post, Herbert Swope of
the New York World. Admiral Sims,
commander of the American naval
forces, and Rabbi Stephen S. Wise of
New York.
Lord Northcliffe, in welcoming the
guests, said they would find absolutely
no hostility to the united States In
England. Momentary Instances of
Irritation had faded away, and in the
same way he was certain some of the
supposed difficulties about the com
ing peace conference would disappear
in the capable bands the United States
and Great Britain had placed them.
Lord Northcliffe added that the
American journalists had seen the
' kind of reception President Wilson
had received in London and that it
was more than remarkable in that it
was unprecedented.
Baron Burnham, in extending cor
dial welcome to the guests at the
luncheon, made a strong plea for the
abolition of all censorships. He said
that if there had been more real free
dom of the press, and if secrets had
been more fully revealed, there would
have been on war.
George RudelL the publisher, in a
speech, said he believed the state
ment that a censorship had been de
cided for the peace conference, was
incorrect.
"We shall start the conference with
out censorship,' sir George continued,
"but It will be open to the conference
to pass resolutions as to certain mat
ters being kept secret. I sincerely
hope that they will not take that
course. I am assured that the Brit
. ish government is strongly in favor
of complete freedom of the press."
The American journalists wfll be
received at the foreign office Satur
day, morning. Afterward they will be
tendered a reception in Downing
street by David Lloyd George, the
British prime minister.

RICHMOND. Va., Dec. 27. Cur
rency and credit expansion during the
war, although to some extent un
avoidable, was greater than necessary
in the opinion of the committee on
war finance of the American Econo
mic association. The committee, of
which Prof. E. R. A. Seligman of Co
lumbia university is chairman, pre
sented its report at a sesson tonight
of the annual convention here of the
association and five other economic
organizations.
Recommendations as to post bellura
financing as represented by the com
mittee Include:
The federal reserve authorities
should follow a less liberal policy in

PERSHING PROMULGATES RULES
FOR GERMANS' GUIDANCE
COBLEN Dec. 27. (By the

within the area occupied by the
Americans further cause today
for realizing they are a conquered
people. After a three weeks' dis
play of .leniency as great or great

military officers, the American
commander promulgated rules of
conduct "foj the guidance of in
habitants." Strict obedience to the rules
was enjoined by General Per
shing. The regulations are mod

French, although - less ' drastic.
They provide for the registration
of every one above the age of 12
years, regulate travel in and out
of the occupied zone, limit drink
ing to light wines and beer and
impose censorship on the press,
theaters and mails.

THE NEW UNITED STATES
(Christian Science Monitor.)
Without waiting for the decisions of the
peace conference, which, in the anticipa
tion of an overwhelming majority of the
American people will be just and wise, or
even for the completion of the domestic
readjustment which the abnormal eco
nomic conditions of the last four years
have made essential, it is not only possible
for the United States to recognize the fact
that an epoch in its history has ended and
another has begun, but it is imperative
that it shall do so. A new era for the re
public has set in. It would be folly to waste
time in elaboration of argument on this
point. Just as certainly as the war of 1 861
65 marked the transition of the republic
from an old order to a new, has the war
of 1914-18 drawn a line between the na
tion's past and its future. As the hours,
days, months, and years roll on, the dis
tinction will grow more pronounced be
tween thoughts and things existent before
humanity was presented, by German militarism-
with the tragedy of the ages.
Let it be repeated and emphasized that
in the United States there is unlimited faith
in the justice and wisdom of the nations
which will settle the questions growing
out of that tragedy. The settlement has
passed from the arbitrament of the sword
to the arbitrament of the pen. All parties
to it are agreed that it must be a final set
tlement and therefore, that it must be fair.
Its conclusion will affect all the peoples of
the earth. In the United States it is the con
viction as well as the hope that it will af
fect humanity beneficially. Whatever may
be the tendency or disposition in smaller
groups toward anxiety, perturbation, or
alarm over the possible outcome, the mas3
is willing to leave the various problems to
the representative men. intrusted with
their solution.
In turning from international to nation
al questions of immediate concern the
United States will not be 'shirking
from the full measure of its world
responsibility. Now, as never before, it
realizes the meaning and weight of interna
tional obligations. To this realization has
it been awakened by the war. As little as
ever does it feel called upon to meddle with
the affairs of its neighbors, and yet, more
than ever is it influenced and impelled by
the spirit of neighborliness. It recognizes,
as it claims, the right of every people to
self-determination and self-government, in
the largest possible measure commensur
ate with the common welfare- but it has
got past the thought that it can live, or the
wish that it might live, within itself. It
has emerged from the war with the settled
conviction that, henceforth, it must take its
part in the world, sharing in world re
sponsibility and sympathy, as in world
power.
Its world duty begins at home, no matter
hew widespread may be its later activities.
Nothing which the United States can do, at
the present time, will be more serviceable
to humanity, eventually, than the steps it
shall take toward overcoming the losses
sustained by industry during the progress
cf the war. By clearing away the debris and
restoring normal business conditions at
home, it will open opportunities for enter
prise and labor abroad. What the world
wants most today is not sympathy, no mat
ter how expressed, but work. To bridge
over the period between idleness and em
ployment is a task which the United
States will cheerfully take up, but this af
fords at best only temporary aid; the task
that calls for all the intelligence, energy, en
terprise, and constructive statesmanship
which the nation can command is that of
setting the new era going with full steam
ahead.
There is no lack of capital in the coun
try; there never was before, in the history
of the world, so much idle capital in one
nation, so much capital readily available to
profitable employment, as now may be
found in the United States; and never were
there greater opportunities for investment,
or more projects demanding prompt atten
tion. Nothing has ever happened, and, ap
parently nothing could ever happen, to re,
veal more completely than has the war
the immense resources of the country.
Within a dozen years it was thought a won
drous thing that the United States, without
disturbing its business routine, could ex
pend a few hundred million dollars upon
the construction of an isthmian canal. The
cost of the Panama undertaking was only
as a drop in the bucket- compared with the
expenditures of the nation upon the war.
For fifteen years it has been notorious that
the reconstruction of the country's rail
way system had become a necessity. Ten
years ago James J. Hill estimated that, at
that time, the cost of rehabilitating the rail
ways of the United States would not be
less than $400,000,000, and the public and
the press alike were appalled by the figures.
The construction of waterways, the control
of flood waters, the development of hydro
electric power, the speedier reclamation of
flooded and desert areas, even the opening
of Alaska, have been all deferred, interrup
ted, or delayed on the ground of cost. Any
one of the loans raised by the people dur
ing the last two years would have covered
the probable expenditures upon all of these
undertakings combined. '
Statesmanship of a comprehensive order
has handled the affairs of war, on behalf
of the United States, since April, 1917.
Not the question of cost, but the point of
need- was considered in every undertak
ing. The country was prepared to go
along for years at the same rate of expendi
ture, if necessary. There are now awaiting
attention a number of projects for the bene
fit of the nation to which prompt and equal
ly liberal support should be given. Not one
of these necessarily calls for extravagant
outlay.
The new United States is a subject to
which the best thought of the country may
well be turned. Not only upon material,
but upon intellectual, lines is there oppor
tunity for tremendous improvement. Mr.
Lane, the secretary of the interior, and Mr.
Wilson, the secretary 6f labor, following in
the way of hundreds of observers and
thinkers, have shown in their last reports
how easily great improvements might be
undertaken for the advancement of the
people, and how( necessary it is that they
shall be undertaken. It is not enough that
the new United States shall be rich and
prosperous; it 'should be a nation of edu
cated, cultivated, right-thinking, happy
people, and expenditures that will make
for such a condition ought to be on a large
scale where resources are practically unlimited.
Since Christmas it has leaked out that
some of the old Bisbee boys had a real
old fashioned celebration of the day, with
all the trimmings, including even egg-nog.
With eggs selling at 80 cents per dozen and
whisky at $7 per pint, there was no chance
for the newspaper fraternity to indulge in
such heavenly delights.
We have heard of Greek meeting Greek,
but what is to be done when the fire en
gine begins to burn, as happened recently
in Cleveland? Here is a job worthy of Mr.
McAdoo's versatility. It takes a man
"who knows everything about all " as El
bert Hubbard used to say, to handle an
emergency like this.
John Bull is now paying distinguished
honor to the first American president who
ever visited that country. Johnny Bull
seems to have learned to admire the kind
of government built up in this country and
the kind of people who have been repre
senting it recently in Europe.
Having drank $80,000 worth of booze
as a remedy for the "flu" it is now reported
that the Phoenicians are bringing in more
of the remedy in hot water bottles, the sup
ply in the jails of the capital city having
been exhausted before the epidemic was
entirely exterminated.
Yaqui outlaws are yet so bad in Sonora
that the men in charge of the Southern
Pacific west coast railroad enterprise dare
not make an inspection of the Yaqui river
branch coming north as far as Tonichi, to
see what is left of this road, which was
once in operation.
Now that Italy has finished her task of
"redemption," the Jugo-Slavs, unfortu
nately, have decided to do a little fancy
irredentist work of their own. There
ought to be a law against two nations re
deeming the same piece of territory.

XEW YORK. Dec. C7. In authoriz
ing President Wilson to take over the
nation's cable lines, congress intended
such seizure to be made "onlyin case
of impending danger to the national
security" and not ''at any time during
the existence of a mere technical
state of war." declared Cnarles E.
Hughes, counsel for the Commercial
Cable and Commercial Pacific Cable
companies, in federal court here to
day. Mr. Hughes made this contention
while arguing before Judge Hand on
the motion of the Cnited States gor
erumeut to dismiss the bill of com
plaint n a suit brought by the two
companies to enjoin Postmaster Gen
eral Burleson and Newcomb Carlton
from merging their lines under federal
control with those of the Western
t n ion Telegraph -company, of which
Carlton is head.
At one point, in reply to a ueqstion
nf Judge Hand as to whether "the se
curity of defense of the nation does
not depend on achievement of the ob
jects for which the war was fought,"
and not on the mere- termination of
figntine. Mr. Hughes said:
"1 think what may be achieved, in
the sense of the final results of the
war. will probably not be terminated
during our lifetime. I think that con
gress haj no reference to the national
security iu the sense of tiie absolute
establishment of some conditions.
Congress had in mind an actual state
of applied force."
Previously counsel for the govern
ment, who contended that the I'nited
States is the vital defendant and can
not be made party to the suit, had
challenged t':at part of the bill of
complaint in which it is asserted that
"seizure of said cables on the ground
that they wire or are necessary for
the national touudation or basis in
lact."
This imputed deception to the
president, declared Edward F. Mc
Clennon, sperial assistant to Attorney
General Gregory.

RELEASE FROM HAND
OF HAPSBURGS ONLY
RELIEF TO TRAGEDY
ONE BRIGHT SPOT IN TRAGICAL
FATE OF AUSTRIA-HUNGARY
DECLARES SOCIALIST LEADER
OF GERMAN AUSTRIA IN NEWS
PAPER INTERVIEW
(By Review Leased Wire)
VIENNA, Tuesday, Dec. 27. "The
only bright spot in the tragedy ot
Austria was the release of the coun
try from the Hapsburg autocracy
which could never be restored," de
clared Karl Seitz, leader of the Ger
man socialists in Austria and presi
dent of the national assembly of German-Austria,
in an interview today.
The fate of German-Austria was
especially tragic, he said, because
she had been accused wrongfully of
kindling the war. History would
prove, he declared, that the German
Austrians had no expansive aspira
tions against the Slavs and always
had opposed the action which started
the war. No country in the world, he
asserted, had suffered such brutality
and persecution at the hands of the
military class as had German-Austria.
A federation of nations, comprising
Austria-Hungary, perhaps, would be
desirable in the interest of capitalists,
he continued, but such .a thing would
be Impossible for a long time, not only
because the Czecho slovaks now were
fighting against the Germans, but
owing to the insuperable difficuies
of arranging common customs, taxa
tion, finance and traffic systems, to
say nothing of the difficulty of lan
guage. German-Austria, however, he
added, could not exist alone because
of her geographical positon and be
cause the arteries of traffic united
her with south Germany and thence
with all cf Germany, upon which Aus
tria, owing to her needs of coal and
capital, depended for her restoration.
The German - Austrian republic,
which had not yet been recognized by
the entente as an independent state,
Seitz declared, was faced with the
greatest difficulties concerning food
supplies, raw materials and capital.
It would hardly be possible to main
tain this state economically without
a loan from the entente, he asserted.
He contended that the smoothness
and order with which the revolution
in Austrian had been achieved had
done much to restrain the spread of
bolshevbm in Germany.
Entente subjects who had remained
in Austria throughout the war bad, he
said, suffered no ill treatment from
the people of German-Austria, who.
had no hatred against England, France
or America.

8Y REVIEW
! N i-V YORK, Dec. 27. Covering of
short contracts was a factor of cou
i tiuciahie importance in today's stock
I market, prices in general recovering
at the first sgas of support, though
manifesting some irregularity on
protit-taking toward the close.
Among the most conspicuous ex
ceptions to the better trend were St.
Paul common and preferred, some of
the secondary coalers and several of
the other rails whose rental or con
tractual relations with the govern
ment are jet to be definitely de
termined. Far more active, relatively, than
stocks was the bond market, the
turnover in that quarter aggregating
probably the largest total of any ses
sion thij year. Liberty bonds, with
the fourth 4'4s at the low record of
$94.20 and the first and second 4s at
new miuimums of $92.80 and $92.50,
respectively, contributed mainly to
the extensive dealings.
The early rally embraced utilities,
including local tractions, but gains in
that quarter were not long main
tained. Coppers also fell back on
reports of additional price-cutting in
aflillated metals.
Shippings, oils, motor and equip
ments were the sustaining features.
United Fruit scoring an extreme ad
vance of 7 points, petroleums an aver
age of 2 points and General Electric
2 points. Sales amounted to 25.000
shares.
Aside from the heaviness of the
Liberty group, the bond market lacked
feature, foreign issues holding firm.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
$32,750,000. Old United States reg
istered 4s lost 8 per cent on sales.
DUN'S VIEWPOINT.
NEW YORK. Dec. 27. Dun's to
morrow will say:
"A year of unexampled achieve
ments nearo its ending with the pro
cess of economic readjustment ac
centuating the seasonal repression of
business activities. Recognition that
the change to a peace basis, although
continuing steadily since early No
vember, is yet far from completed, in
tensifies the hesitation incidental to
inventorying and other annual ac
counting, ad the prevailing disposition
is to defer important engagements
until the future outlook is clearer.
That the question of prices is one of
increasing . significance there is
abundant evidence, and many buyers
are prompted to hold commitments
within the closest limits through the
belief that the yielding tendencies
lately developing in some leading
commodities will widen in their scope
with the return of Tree markets. Yet
the further removal, after January 1,
pf the arbitrary regulations and re
strictions, affecting production and
distribution and prices, will make pos
sible the conducting or operations
along more natural lines, and there is
confident expectation that the revival
pf regular domestic and foreign com
merce, once it fairly commences, will
make gratifying progress. Weekly
bank clearings, $5,541,672,044."
BOSTON COMMERCIAL BULLETIN.
BOSTON, Mass., Dec. 27. The Com
mercial Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"Interest centers in the wool auc
tions almost exclusively and with the
intervention of the holiday little busi
ness has been done, allotments from
the wool distributor's office having
been timid. The quantity of wool at
the next sales will be about the same
as at the preceding series, the only
practical difference being the offer
ings would consist of wools which may
be expectej to meet the demand as
expressed as the last saies.
"The foreign markets have changed
little during the week and while the
manufacturers are looking the market
over for sampling purposes and to
see what can be done for uext season,
the goods markets are more or less
as they were a week ago. Ths de
mand for mohair has been dull. Ter
ritory: Fine staple, 158 to 160; half
blood combing. 162 to 165; three-quarter
blood combing li'5 to 130; fine
clothing, 150 to 153; fine medium
clothing, 140 to 143; pulled extra, 158
to 160; Jl. A., 156 to 158; A supers,
142 to 143."

there was all last winter and the I
prospects are that the amount will
be increased before very long.
NO NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
There have been no new develop
ments in the Singer mystery of Thurs
day evening. Yesterday the local
officers made a further effort to try
and get some clue to the man who
tied and gagged Mrs. Singer, but they
made no progress. One suspect was
taken up to the house for Mrs. Singer
to look at, but she said that he was
not the man. Mrs. Singer was still
quite nervous yesterday from her ex
periences, but is rapidly recovering.
VISITING FAMILY.
Capt. J. P. Hodgson of the Detroit
Copper company at Morenci, formerly
with the Phelps Dodge company here,
is spending the holidays here on a
visit with his family and making ar
rangements to take them back to that
city with him. where they will make
their future home.
WILL BE DOUGLAS ASSISTANT.
As soon as he can take the Arizona
bar examination and be admitted to
practice in this sfate George Ml
Roark of Douglas wfll be appointed
as deputy county attorney for Doug
las, according to an announcement
from County Attorney-elect R. NC
French. Mr. Roark, who is an attor
ney of many years, having practiced
in Texas, has never been admitted to
practice in Arizona, having followed
other lines. He was for years police
judge and recorder in Douglas. I
"It's a small world," is a piece of
philosophy oft repeated, and in many
tcngues, dialects, or "patters," as may
exist. Uncle Hiram, loafing in the
corner grocery, avers as much, as he
shifts his quid r.nd expectorates on
the strive- while President Wilson or
Kine- fieoree. President. Poincare or
any other of the notable figures in
. ... , i . ,
world atlairs aouDtiess nas maae me
same observation, cn occasion. The
latest evidence of this truism is a let
ter from Chester A. Johnson, bettet
known as "Chet." former telegraph
editor of The Review, in which he
to'.d of meeting "Somewhere in
France." W. A. Sutton, who worked
with him in Bisbee as operator of the
Review's leased wire of the Associ
ated Press.
"I was in line in front of a Y build
ing, waiting . to get in, and I heard
somebody behind me swearing around,
not in an ordinary manner, but artisti
mllv It reminded me so much of
someone I had known that I left my
place in the line and walked back
about fifteen feet, to confirm my sus
picion. I was right. It was Sutton.
He dropped out of line also, and for
fifteen minutes we cussed eah other,
pounded each other's backs and shook
hands. She's a small world, maybe.
hut thii was the first -reunion I had
had with anybody I had worked with
on the Review."
Johnson said S'itton had been in
France ahout a Year at the time of
thpir mcetlnc. h.ivine enlisted in the
signal corps soon after leaving the
Review. He had been in t$e greater
part of the fighting in which Ameri
cans had participated and had seen
the most active sort of action.
The letter said Johnson and Sutton
both planned to return to Bisbee
whenever they are discharged from
the army. When that would be. the
writer was at a lossveven to conjec
ture, though he hoped it would be
soon.
Johnson said he had been detached
from dutjf as regimental sergeant ma
jor of the 158th infantry, and was on
duty with the intelligence department.
This work had carried him away from
the regiment and to other parts of
France until he no longer even knew
me ttucreduuuis Ul Hie lui m.:. -
tional guardsmen. However, this tin
formation was vouchsafed the world ;
last wepk when it was announced that I
the Arizcnans had been designated to
act as President Wilson's guard of
hnnnr rinriner his stav in France.
Johnson's letter advised his friend
not to write him any more, as he was
moving about constantly, and could
not be certain of receiving his mail:
anyway he was hopeful of getting his
discharge in a few weeks at the out
side. The letter was written Novem

soring of feature productions, as
there is generally some scene to incur
the displeasure of the reviewing com
mittee. "The Warrior" was passed in
its entirety, a splendid commentary
on the wholesomeness of the screen
play of love, comedy and war. There
is not the slightest suggestion of the
usual nauseating sex interest which
forms an important part of many film
productions and every reel of the sev
en part picture has a clean, whole
some atmasphere. In the wide appeal
which Manager Tammen feels "The
Warrior" will make to his audience he
wishes to emphasize above all things
the cleanliness of the production,
which will be a strong factor in "mak-
scrvices in the first Sunday in De
cembPr. but owing to the influenza
quarantine it could not be held here
cn scheduled time. For the same rea
son the lodgemen abandoned for the.
once, their usual practice of holding
the service in one cf the local theat
ers. Charles P. Ward, an attorney of
Phoenix, noted throughout the state
for his ability as an orator, will be
the principal speaker, delivering the
annual menioMal address.
The ledge room will be decorated
in keeping with the nature of the
occasion, while the solemn ritualistic
ceremonies of the order will serve to.
distinguish and enobie the day in the ;
minds of the lodgemen and their
friends who attend. A musical pro
gram will be rendered in connection '
with the service. j

The great screen spectacle 'The

sorbingly interesting reels. Manager
Tammen, who will present "The War

fact that the feature offering has
passed the careful scrutiny of the Na
