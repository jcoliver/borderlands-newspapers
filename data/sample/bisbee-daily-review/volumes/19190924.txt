TE LABOR C1ITTEE W
INTERVENE IN STEEL STRIKE;
BOTH SIDES STIR! FIRM
Investigation Is Ordered to Determine if Congress Can
Relieve Situation; Union Secretary Says 327,000 Men
Are Participating; Crowd Told By State Constabulary to
Disperse; Fires Volley; Bystanders and Miners Are Killed
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23. Con
gress intervened in the steel strike
today by directing the senate labor
committee to institute an immediate
investigation to ascertain "if the situ
ation can in any way be relieved by
federal action."
The inquiry will begin Thursday,
when representatives of the strikers
wil be heard. Later Chairman Gary,
of the United States Steel corpora
tion; President Gompers, of the
American Federation of Labor, and
other spokesmen for both capital
and labor, will appear.
Action by the senate was taken on
a resolution proposing the inquiry of
fered by Senator Kenyon, Republi
can, of Iowa, chairman of the educa-.
tion and labor committee. The reso
lution was adopted without objection
after brief discussion of the serious
Industrial situation involving the pub
lic's Interest.
While the senate was launching
the committee inquiry, the house
loudly applauded an address by Rep
resentative Cooper, Republican,
Youngstown, Ohio, a member of one
of the railroad brotherhoods, assail
ing William Z. Foster, secretary and
treasurer of the committee organiz
ing the steel workers, and other union
labor leaders, whom, he charged, were
fomenting revolution. The represent
ative from the heart of one steel in
dustry district appealed to the rank
and file of labor organisations to
disregard "radical" leadership.
V Officer Sent For.
Immediately after adoption of his
resolution. Chairman Kenyon sent1
telegrams to Judge Gary and John J.
Fitz'patrick, chairman of the steel
strikers organization, requesting
them to appear Thursday. Judge
Gary telephoned later that he could
not appear Thursday,' and, at his re
quest, hi3 testimony was deferred
until a week from tomorrow. Sena
tor Kenyon said tonight he was as
sured Fitzpatrick and probably othei
representatives of the strikers would
beon hand to start the hearings'
Thursday.
Expedition of the committee's in
quiry Is planned by Senator Kenyon
"I hope to complete the hearings
and submit a report late next week,"
said the chairman, who added, dur
ing senate discussion of his resolu
tion, that legislation to bring about
conciliation might result.
Senator Kenyon told the senate
that he was acting primarily in the
public interest, believing that the
steel strike was "the first skirmish
in industrial warfare" and denied that
either capital or labor" had the right
of acting in detriment to the public.
Further senate discussion of the In
dustrial unrest and the strike is ex
pected tomorrow in the senate. Sen-J
ator Thomas, Democrat, Coloraao, to
day introduced a resolution which
would put the senate on record as
disapproving "conspiracies and dis
turbances" to accomplish objects by
force or disorder, denouncing the
"cloned shop" as tyrannous and un
American and deploring "strikes for
power."
The senator plans to call up the
resolution tomorrow.

flays and holidays and important im
provements in conditions of labor,
were adopted this afternoon by the
convention of the United Mine Work
ers of America.
The convention then adjourned to
await the result of the joint wage
scale conference with the operators of
the central competitive district, which
opens in Buffalo Thursday. Should a
satisfactory new agreement be reach
ed by the respresentatives of the min
ers and operators at this conference
the convention will be reconvened at

Should no agreement be reached in

by the contending forces in the wide
spread Inustdrial contest now being
waged. '
The leaders of the organized work
ers boldly claimed today that the
strike is spreading and that thou
sands of men who worked yesterday
joined the walkout today. Predic
tions were made that plants still in
operation would be closed tomorrow
or Thursday and that no gains were
made anywhere either by the United
States Steel corporation, the princi
pal factor in the struggle, or by in
dependent concerns.
Representatives of the Carnegie
Steel company, the largest subsidiary
in the corporation, admitting that
some of the plants are closed be
cause of a strike, claim that the situ
ation is better than it was yesterday.
According to an authorized summary
of conditions within the Pittsburgh
district more men were at work at
Homestead, Clairtown, Duquesne and
and other places. "All told, the situ,
ation is better than It was yesterday.
The situation in the Monongahela
valley, where our four big mills are
located, is considerably improved
and is encouraging," was the state
ment of an official of the Carnegie
company.
Nearly Half a Million.
William Z. Foster, secretary of the
national committee for organizing
iron and steel workers, in charge ot
national headquarters here, said re
ports received by him during the day
from organizers and others in charge
of steel districts show that 327,100
men are participating in the strika
According to his figures, 5000 addi
tional men are out in the city of
Pittsburgh; 5000 more at Braddock,
and 3000 additional in Rankin, near
here. He claimr 20,000 additional
are out in the Chicago district and
5000 more .in the Youngstown dis
trict, and 3000 more fn the Wheeling
field. While not giving any figures,
corporation representatives tonight
disputed the figures, asserting if they
were true, many of the districts In
cluded in Fister's list would be com
pletely shut down, whteh is not the
case. The United States Steel cor
poration, according to reports, has
not met with as much success in
operating some of its subsidiaries In
other parts of Pennsylvania as . has
the plants of the Carnegie company
in this immediate vicinity. In sev
eral localities its -Smaller works were
closed down when it was found In
sufficient men had reported to keep
the plants in successful operation.
Representatives of the Carnegie in
terests here declared that this was
due to lack of adequate police pro
tection for men willing to work.
Mr. Foster said steel workers were
being arrested at Duqusne for beins
on strike and fined when' they re
fused to return to work.
: The matter of financing the strike
will also be taken up at the meeting,
he said. ,
"We are going to prepare to fighi
to the bitter end," he added. "If It
is to be a long struggle we will be
ready. It is a fight for industrial
democracy and the workers are de
termined to stick."

of bituminous coal mines in the Unit
ed States will automatically ensue on
that date, which may extend to the
Canadian coal fields if the interna
tional executive board and the repre
sentatives of the Canadian districts so
determine.
While a decided increase in wages is
demanded to meet the heavy increase
'.n the cost of living the miners' dele
gates were no less interested in pro
viding regular employment for all
members of the union throughout the
year, voting not only to restrict the
number of working hours to 30 per
week .but also to prohibit the employ
ment of double shifts in producing coal
with this aim in view.
The report of the scale committee
was adopted unchanged after a com
paratively short debate. Practically all
objections and criticisms were obviat
ed by the fact that the delegates will
have opportunity to pass upon any
agreement before it comes into effect
Resents Discharge;
Mexican Attempts
To Carve Foreman
A warrent is now out for the
arrest of Folimeno Rodriguez, a
Mexican resident of Bisbee on the
charge of assault with attempt to
kill. The complaint was sworn to
by Pedro Mendozo, a section fore
man on the Sacramento Hill rail
road gang, and his brother, Jesus
Mendozo. The complaint is the
second one issued for the accused
and is said to be the outgrowth of
a quarrel over the discharge of
Rodriguez by the Mendozo broth
ers. Upon being discharged by Men
dozo, Rodriguez, it is said, drew a
knife and started to assault his
former boss. The brother of Men
dozo then went to the rescue and
with the aid of a rock succeeded
in subduing Rodriguesz. The sec
tion boss then swore out a com
plaint for his assailant, who was
released on $10 bail, which was
forfeited in Judge Winters' court
yesterday. Evidently looking for
more trouble Rodriguez came
back later in the day and repeated
the same tactics. The warrant
was then issued on the more se
rious charge.
EL PASO, Texas, Sept. 23. A
courier passed through here last
night on his way to San Antonio,
Texas, from Francisco Villa's head
quarters near the Durango-Chihua-

a member of the Villa organization
here tonight. r
He visited Villa In his Durango
headquarters in the interest of the
proposed union of all rebel leaders
opposing the Carranza government,
it was announced. The courier was
expected to go to Washington from
San Antonio with a message for
Villa's representative, Miguel Diaz
Lombardo, who Is said to be in
Washington at the present time. He
did not reveal the exact plan of
union proposed to Villa, It was said,
but It was said to be similar to the
one General Angeles has been urg
ing upon rebel leaders recently in
the Bouth of Mexico. Manuel Pel
aez, the Cedilla brothers, a south
ern leader named Hernandez, and
General Qpnzales, the new Zapata
leader, were said to have approved
of the plan of amalgamation.

Before Session Adjourned
WASHINGTON, .Sept. 23. Repub
licans took actual, control of peace
treaty procedure in the senate today
by a three vote margin.
The first test In the fight now be
ing waged about the pact with its
league of nations covenant, came on
a motion by Chairman Lodge of the
foreign relations committee to post
pone for one week consideration ot
some forty odd amendments which
would relieve the United States from
service on commissions created un
der the treaty. The formal motion,
with a fixed date, was put In the
senate, after the vice president had
ruled on a point of order by Senator
Hitchcock, leader of administration
forces, against a motion for indefi
nite consideration, and it was adopt
ed, 43 to 40.
The motion, not of itself import
ant, was accepted tonight by oppo
nents of the league as the best "pos
sible index of the feeling and attitude
of the senate toward the treaty and
the covenant. Democratic leaders
declared it meant nothing.
Except in three Instances the vote,
on which the ayes and nays were de
manded by Senator Hitchcock, fol
lowed party lines. Senator Jones of
Washington and Senator McCumber
of North Dakota, both Republicans,
voted against the motion, and Sena
tor Reed, Democrat, of Missouri,
voted for It. , Ten senators were
paired and three Gore, Oklahoma;
King, Utah, and Shields, Tennessee
absent and not voting, were not
paired.
The little flurry over the Lodge
motion was the only excitement dur
ing the two hour consideration of the
treaty, which was not taken up until
3 o'clock because of a parliamentary
wrangie. Seuator Lodge called it up
at 2 o'clock, the regulation hour, but
the fight over a senate rule still was
running wild, when Senator Hitch
cock cut it short by a demand for
reading of the treaty. There was no
speechmaking, and late in the day
the crowds In the galleries, listening
to the monotonous reading, looked
down and saw only two senators
Hitchcock and Brandegee, Republi
can of Connecticut, in the chambers.
Others flitted back and forth but few
sat through the reading.

J. D. Bauer, a local lawyer, who
cenently gained fame by defend
ing certain members of the I. W.

Hogan's court on the charge of
vagrancy, was yesterday hailed

turbing the ieace. ,
The hearing of Bauer's will be
before Judge Winters' court in
Lowell and is set for 4:30 Thurs
day afternoon. Bauer was arrest
ed on a complaint sworn to by
Ada Harless. The exact cause of
the quarrel could not be learned
yesterday, but It is understood to
be the result of an argument In
which Eauer and his wife were
involved. The airing of the trou
ble before the justice court is ex
pected to attract a large audience,
owing to the prominence of the
accused in Bisbee.

RESERVATIONS IN

CUT THE HEART OF LEAGUE
WILSON TELLSSALT LAKE CROWD
The President Answers All Objections That Under Article
Ten U. S. Would Be Called to Settle Balkan Troubles;
Explains Choice Would Be Made From Nearest Available
Forces; Speech Is Frequently Interrupted by Applause
SALT LAKE CITY. Sept. 23. Re
plying directly to senate proposals
to write reservations into ratifica
tion of the peace treaty. President
Wilson declared in an address in the
Mormon tabernacle here tonight that
the proposals would "cut the heart"
out of the league of nations.
Before a great crowd iwjiich re-
peatedly cheered his utterances, Mr.
Wilson read a proposed reservation
under which the United States would
ouuie no respunsi Dimy io 'pro
tect the integrity of foreign govern
ments under article ten. Such a res-
ervation, he asserted, would relieve
the United States of a part of its
just responsibility.
"Does the United States want to
be in on thai special footing?" asked
the president, and there, was a great
i shout of "no" from the crowd.
article ten the United States might
be called to settle Balkan controver
sies, the president said:
"If you want to put out a fire in
Utah, you don't go to Oklahoma for
the fire engine, and if you want to
put out-a fire in the Balkans, , you
don't send to the United States for
troops."
The choice would be made, he said,
from "the most suitable and most
available" forces, and the decision
would be made with the consent of all
the nations concerned. Should the
controversy spread so that the aid
of the United States would be neces
sary, then it would be so serious a
situation that this nation would gei
in any wav, league or no league. To
adopt such a reservation, continued
Mr. Wilson, was not to interpret the
covenant, but would constitute an
"absolute withdrawal" from the re
sponsibilities of article ten and con.
sequently a rejection of the treaty.
Instead of waiting to get what it
could without assuming any respon
sibility, it was the nation's dutv. he
said, to accept the leadership which
the world now offered. That cou"fl
be done, he continued, without in any
way impairing national sovereignty,
because no great decision could be
taken without the .vote of the United
States.
The president was cheered again
when he said that the "only serious
forces" back of the movement to re-
ject or change the treaty "proceed
from exactly the same sources as
the pro-German propaganda proceed-
ed from." He added that he had no
notion of reflecting upon the public
men who were aiding the opposition,
but he declared they were pleasing
Germany by their attitude. Through
certain channels open to the govern-
ment, he said, he knew Germany waSjTnpn hand, with one missing finger,

Every previous treaty, said the ; who claimed to have shot xnd killed
president, had been a division of Epifanio Holguin, former Villa col-
spoils, while the present document
was "!an absolute renunciation of
spoils."
Everywhere throughout the world,
he asserted, settlements had been
made on the theory that the people
themselves would determine what
form of government they should have.!
Through the people, the president
said; he was appealing to senators
to take a second thought if they in-
tended to write Into the treaty any
such reservation as that he had ,
quoted.
SUPERVISORS SUGGEST BUS
PHOENIX, Ariz., Sept. 23. The
final session of the first annual meet
ing of the Association of County Su
pervisors, held here today, appointed
a legislative committee of holdover
members of the various boards, so
that they would have time, while still
in office, to prepare and present to
the next legislature certain new laws,
repeals and amendments the super
visors' association favors.
The committee consists of Bowen
of Maricopa, Gates of Gila, Woolfolk
of Coconino, Harrison of Santa Cruz,
Moon of Greenlee, Elliot of Yuma and
Midgely of Yavapai. Most of the sub
jects discussed were referred to this
committee for action.
The legislative committee will draft
a number of suggested laws, to be
submitted to the next meeting of the
Association at Dauglas, next July.

PEACE THEATY
The president also discussed the
Shantung provision, repeating his
previous statements that the league
covenant offered the best hope for
China's interests. He asked his hear
ers to make felt their moral Judg-
j ment that the thing for America to
. do was to redeem the pledge by ao-
cepting the treaty,
j President Wilson declared his
, transcontinental trip had convinced
him that the "overwhelming major-
ity of the people want the league ot
nations adopted."
In a SDeCh which acain nnrl a train
was interrupted with outbursts ot
cheering, the president said that one
bv one the tn
had melted away until the issue had
been resolved Into a square-cut ques
tion of taking the treaty or leaving it.
The president spoke t? a crowd
which the police estimated at 12.000.
Every seat was occupied and all the
available standing room taken, while
outside the tabernacle there was an
other great throng blocking the en
trances and the surrounding streets.
The cheering that started when
the president entered the tabernacle
lasted more than a minute, and then
the Star Spangled Banner was played
on the great pipe organ. As the last
bar of the song began, the cheering
broke out again.

Christianization of
Jews Is Advocated
NEW YORK, Sept. 23. -Christianization
of the Jews in the United
States as part of a $1,000,000 Ameri
canization program planned by the
Episcopal board of missions was ad
vocated here today at a board conference.
Suggestion by Bishop Rogers Israel
of Erie, Pa., that any action should
be deferred until after the Episcopal
geaeral conference at Detroit in Oc
tober brought answer from the Rev
John I. Zacker, superintendent of
Jewish work for the diocese of Phil
adelphia, that if the Jew was left put
of the program for only a short time
it would be a failure.
"The Jews control the world," said
Mr. Zacker, "and if Christianity is to
convert the Jews it must be attempt
ed at once."

To Survey Damage
By Forest Fires
MISSOULA, Mont., Sept. 23. Under
the- direction of the bureau of silvicul
ture of the forest service, a Burvey is
to be made soon of the amount of tim
ber destroyed in Montana during the
fire season just ended. This survey
will undertake to determine the value
of the merchantable timber destroyed,
the loss in young growth, the possi-'

president of the American Federation
of Labor, would attend the confer
ence, Mr. Foster said: "No." He ex
plained that John Fitzpatrick, chair
man of the committee, who would
attend, was the personal representa
tive of Mr. Gompers.
The possibility ot extending the
strike to include seamen on carrier
vessels on the Great Lakes and union
trainmen will also be discussed, ac
cording to Mr. Foster. He said rep
resentatives of both unions had been
invited to attend the meetiag.
"Already a number of union train
men in the strike districts have
walked out and refused to move cars
of material in and out of the strike
affetced plants," he added. "The
seamen are also ready to strike in
sympathy with the steel workers."
, Mr. Foster said that he had been in
communication constantly with the
officials of the Broaherhood of Rait
way. Trainmen and the International
Seamen's Union of America and that
both organizations would co-operate
in making the strike a success.
, At a meeting of union organizers

PUEBLO, Cok., Sept. 23. The sec
ond day ot the strike of steel work
ers in Pueblo passed the same as
the first. No disorders and every
thing quiet. Hundreds of steel-workers
and their families attended the
sate fair and enjoyed other forms
of recreation. From both union head-,
quarters and the officals of the plant
came the statement that there is no
change in the situation.
The clouds of smoke usually com
ing from the smokestacks at the steel
plant have almost totally disappeared,
as some of the furnaces are banked
and others cooled off. The only
workmen in the place today are the
few men operating the electric light
plant that supplies the Minnequa
hospital, numerous residences, in the
district' and the plant. A meeting of
the Pueblo Trades and Labor assem
ly is to be- held tonight for the pur
pose, it is said, of raising fuads with
which to render financial assistance
to the striking steel workers.
Numbers of the steel workers are
said to be seeking employment in
other parts of the country. Some are
said to be preparing to accept posi
tions, in, Arizona and New Mexico,
where it is said that there is a short,
age of men in other lines of industry.

DEMONSTRATION GARDENS
FARRELL, Pa., Sept. 23. Serious
rioting here torLight resulted in the
killing of one man, the wounding of
three others by rifle bullets and' the
injuring of two other persorS The
outbreak, which followed that of last
night and early today, occurred when
20 state troopers attempted to dis
perse a crowd of strikers and their
sympathizers in the heart of the busi
ness district. The rioting was over
in a few miautes. The troopers in
attempting to scatter the mob were
assaulted with, bricks and missiles.
Finally several- shots - were directed
at the state policemen and they were
ordered to open fire. Five or six vol
leys were fired, it is said, most of
them in the air. The crowd scattered
and four men were found lying in the
street. One of the men. John Band
zak, said to be a striker, was killed
instantly. One of the injured was
rushed to the Euhl hospital in Sharon
with a bullet through the neck. He
is not expected to live.
Among the other Injured was Ella
Echio. She was shot in the hip by
a bullet ' '
Two qher men wjth badly battered
heads were lodged in jail. Both were
found armed, the policesay.
While the borough quieted down,
following the shooting, there was
great tension and more serious out
breaks are feared. James Gibson,
sheriff of Mercer county, tonight
swore in a large number of deputies,
among them' being returned soldiers.
Some ofthose sworn in are negroes.
Local police ana state troopc
were stationed tonight on every street i
corner along tne main stre" and!
searched pedestrians for firearms, j
Ten men were arrested carrying pis-j
tola. ,
After the clash with the troopers
a report reached the authoritoes tb?t
an attempt would be made to dyna
mite the police station and the fire
house and a cordon of deputies was
thrown about these places.
Thirty more state troopers who ar-1
rived at Butler today were ordered
here tonight. The feeling against
the state policemen by the strikers
and tuetr sympathizers is inteuse.
This was aroased as a result of the
killing of a man last night and the
wounding of several others. In a
second outbreak this morning two
persons were shot, it is alleged, by
troopers. Strike leaders claim that
the presence of the troopers has been
responsible for disorders, but itis as
serted by others that the troopers
in no instance shot into the crowds
until they were fired upon by some
of those in the mob.
It is charged by corporation officials
that several times during the day per
sona: on the hillside and the roofs of
nearby houses fired rifle shots into
the plant of the American Steel and
Wire company.
The rioting started, when Paul Kos
imshi, 25, a workman, was attacKed
by a dozen or more men while on his
way to the plant of the American
Steel and Wire company. Special
Policeman Samuel Carter ,a negro,
went to Kosimshi's rescue. By this
time they,, were surrounded, by a mob
of several hundred persons.
The two men sought shelter In a
butcher shop, The crowd is alleged
to have attempted to enter the build
ing and fired a number of shots.
Joseph Hngartz, 21. said by the police
to be a striker, fell with a bullet
wound in the abdomen. He was tramp
led by the men as they rushed into the
shop.
CJaief Gilson -and members of the
Lackawanna city police were in the
thick of the crowd, trying to restore
order. Their frantic signals to the
guards to cease firing were not heed
ed, Chief Gilson, said tonight. It was
not until the crowd, which included
many women and children, broke up
in a panic that the firing stopped, he
asserted.
The strikers were in an ugly mood
tonight. Three were arrested on
charges of inciting to riot. Three
other men were found near gate num
ber three tonight- carrying shotguns
wrapped in paper. They were releas
ed after they had produced runting li
censes and denleG any hostile object.
Chief Gilson tonight expressed the
opinion that the plant policemen had
"acted somewhat too hastily" in open
ing fire on, the mob. "However," he
added, "the plant guards were under
great provacation. The .. crowd . was
bombarding the policemen with every
sort of missile it could lay its hands
on."
Chief Gilson said 'he believed that
in their excitement the plant guards
did not see him or his men signalling
to cease firing. If there is further dis
order tomorrowChief Gilson said to
night, he will ask that the state troops
be called out to keep order in Lacka
wanna. A detail of state police is ex
pected tomorrow and the riot squads
of the Buffalo pojice department will
be at the line in readiness to cross to
LackaVanna if needed.

Home Economics and Civics
Branch of 20th Century
Club Told How the Ballot
Regulates Affairs of the
Government.
The Home Economics and Civics
branch of the Twentieth Century
club met yesterday at the Y. V. C.
A. and listened to an interesting talk
on "Women Voters" by Alexander
Murray, a local attorney, and to an
explanation . of the aims and pur
poses of the ; "Opportunity School"
by Mrs. Etta G if ford Young, of Phoe
nix, who is here as the representa
tive of the Department ot Vocational
Education. ' '
Mr. Murray explained that the suc
cess of any government depended on
the intelligent and boardminded use
of the ballot.
, He said In part:
"No higher function could be ex
ercised by any people than that of
tlie ballot. All functions of govern
ment will be purely or impurely ad
ministered in the same measure as
tb ballot is purely or impurely func
tioned. "How can we expect that the right
to vote will be intelligently- or hon
estly used if the majority of voters
employ ; it for dishonest or selfish
purposes. It is peculiar that the ma
jority are so obsessed that we put our
personal interest ahead of the pub
lic interest. As long as the public
vote shows that it is impelled by
personal interest, just so long will
public officials be elected who will
employ their office to personal ends.
-"Once arrived at the place where
we can divorce personal interest and
exercise the ballot only for what is
right, there will be fewer mistakes
made."
Mrs. Young explained that the vo
cational training, which will be given
in the Opportunity School to be
opened here, is the result of a revival
in interest and a revolution in meth
ods in school training. , Under what
is known as the Smith-Hughes act,
the work is subsidized by the federal
and state governments assisted by
the community.' The motto of the
school is "Any amount of instruction
to anybody, at any time, free." '
Students must be over 14 years ot
age and regularly employed. It is
intended ' particularly to interest
adults who may feel that In their
daily work, whatever it may be,
housework as well as business or
professional, they may go to the
school and get instruction from those
who have had actual experience along
the lines in which they want Information.

WASHINGTON. Sept 23 Three of
the foremost leaders of organized la
bor, before the senate interstate com
merce committee today, denounced
in unqualified terms sections of the
Cummins railroad reorganization bill,
which would prevent railroad workers
from striking
Samuel Gompers, president of the
American Federation of Labor; War
ren S. Stone, chief of the Engineers'
Brotherhood, and Glenn E. Plumb,
author of organized labor's solution
of the railroad problem and general
counsel for the brotherhoods, in turn
presented varying arguments but all
emphasizing the single point that in
their view no power could constitu
tionally prevent men leaving work
at their will.
T do not wish to live a single day
after" that right has been taken away
from workingmen," Mr. Gompers said
with more than a touch of indigna
tion. He served notice on the com
mittee that the anti-strike provision,
if enacted as law, would not be
obeyed.
"With a full sense of my responsi
bility," he told senators, "I say that
I should have no hesitancy about
participating in a strike after its
passage than I do now. I t wouldn't
stop strikes; it would just make law
breakers." There ,was considerable reference
to the Plumb plan, which provides
for government ownership of the rail
roads and joint operation by the pub-,
lie and employes, when its author)
that strikes would be beneficial in
the future, because workers would
use them to force down prices in
stead of merely to secure a greater
share of the cost of production, and
allowing prices to increase. Puzzled
senatorial questioners dealt at some
length with .this theory, but it did
not shake his conclusion.
Likewise Mr. Plumb made refer
ence to approaching revolution
should "conservative labor forces"
not secure concessions of the type
embodied in his plan, and this- oc-H
casioned more querying. Mr. Stone
attacked the Cummins; bill in its" en
tirety. Its committee on wages and
working conditions,' he said, was a
"mere bluff," it t cinched "bureau
cratic control" on the roads; it
"distorted procedure of . the inter
state commerce commission in or
der to give the commission a man
date to fix rates on the- basi3 of
inflated capitalization," and ii had
a transportation board "just to take
the blame off guilty railroad offi
cials for denying rights to labor."
"Frankly vicious," he said, were;

Since July, 1916, Goodrich De Luxe Truck
Tires on the wheels of a 5-ton truck operated
by The Texas Company, handling petroleum
and its products, with a 750-gallon tank astride
its "chassis, has been crunching over rock-strewn
paths daily.
Yet only the other day De Luxe veterans on
the rear wheels gave way to De Luxe succes
sors, having delivered over 15,000 miles of ser
vice in three years.
Such heroic and commendable service from
De Luxe Tires is due to the extra-deep, extra
thick treads, treads so resilient and tough as to
defy penetration by rocks.
Put this extra rubber under your trucks
for safety and economy's sake. JUST ONCE.
ONCE is sufficient to convince.

WHAT IS LUXURY
TRULY, the ways of the legislator are beyond calculation. He
prescribe the length of bedclothes in Texasand the constitu
ents of a meal in California. He loses sleep over the evil in a
bob-tail flush, and christens a battleship, as happened in Ore
gon, with a quart of milk. He keeps one ear to the ground le6t his
actions offend the folks back home, and with the other he harks to
the plaudits of the press gallery.
In the so-called "luxury" laws, he has been funnier then usual,
if that is possible. Ice cream alone is a luxury, but ice cream com
ing at the end of seven courses is a food, according to the code, so
the man who eats in the middle of the afternoon because he is hun
gry is taxed for it, while he pays no tax for the same ice cream
when served merely that he may get the taste of the Rocqucfort out
of his mouth.
If he takes a soft drink, he pays a premium, except in the case
that that drink is milk, when, in the opinion of the law-maker, he
has not been stepping along the primrose path but has been satisfy
ing the inner man. Therefore, the law ponders and says he shall not
pay the tax.
In those states where the much vaunted, but unsatisfying 2.75
per cent beer is now an article of common consumption, he pays no
tax when he orders a foaming flagon, whereas the same amount ot
sodawater would cost him one cent. What the dispenser of illegal
wet goods charges on behalf of the government is, of course, prob
lematical, but we may hazard a shrewd guess that it is as odd a
charge as that on coca-cola in Brewery Gulch.
Some day, they say, there will be sane law-making, but that will
be in a distant age, and, we fear, in a distant clime, where the red
banana hangs from the drooping stalk and the luscious cocoanut, all
unaware of its importance to the government, drops handily inp
the lap of the grinning cannibal who has never learned the difference
between a glass of iced tea and a bottle of grape juice.
THE TRUTH ABOUT SHANTUNG
a LTHOUGH President Wilson has now been on the Pacific Coast
A for nearly a week he has not in any of his speeches to the peo
ple thus far touched upon the one thing in the peace treaty that
the Far West is most interested in. California, Oregon and
Washington are keenly alive to the Shantung situation. They re
gard Japan with suspicion, if not with fear. The kingdom of the
Mikado to their mind is the Prussit of the Orient. Her aims have
been more or less imperialistic, her policies controlled and guided
by self interest. It may be said in her behalf, even as it was said
for Germany, that the increasing population has made it necessary
for her to find an outlet for the surplus; but that does not give her
any moral or legal right to take her neighbor's territory unjustly
or wrest concession from weaker nations under threat of compulsion.
The American peace commissioners have not attempted to justify
the spoliation of China. The majority of them were flatly against
it. Only Mr. Wilson consented to it in order to save the League of
Nations. But is a League of Nations founded in fraud worth sav
ing? Japan must have the right to oppress and exploit S6000,000
people of a different race against their expressed will and dominate
the most important and most sacred province of China, the cradle
of Chinese civilization and the birthplace of Confucius." Is that self
determination? Is that the justice that the President has every
where preached but voted against? If he sees any visions on the
horizon and hears any voices in the air we should imagine they
would be the visions of despoiled and outraged people and the voices
of those crying out in the night against this robbery.
No wonder the President does not discuss this provision in the
treaty with the people of the Pacific coast and does not even defend
his action before the rest of the country except to say that he had
to do this foul wrong in order to bring about the dawn of the millenn
ium. But if the millennium is to come by such dishonest and inde
fensible methods, the world will prefer that its arrival be indefin
itely postponed.
The President says 'that Japan intends to give back to China
her territory. But that does not mean that she is going to let go
her stranglehold upon Shantung. She does not admit any intention
of giving up her valuable economic rights in the peninsula, and we
need only examine into Japan's record in South Manchuria in orde
to appreciate the far-reaching consequences of the Shantung clauses
in the peace treaty.
We do not believe that the American people will willingly con
sent to let Japan realize her dream of military glory by the armed
conquest of her neighbors, no, not even to save Mr. Wilson's sacred
covenant: And if Japan must have Kan-Chau and the valuable econo
mic rights in Shantung, and China is to be forced to enter unon a
military path to regain her lands, her freedom and her independence,
let it be said that this republic did not become a particeps criminis
in the tragedy.

IT WAS a sound argument for common sense methods of recon
struction which Herbert Hoover presented in an address in New
York. Mr. Hoover says that five years' service in Europe, has
put two dominant convictions In his mind; namely, that socialism
is bankrupting itself and that America must not abandon its moral
leadership in the world nor permit itself to be, used for experiments
in social diseases. Most Americans will endorse that.
There is good evidence, which Hoover's testimony fully supports,
that the philosophy of the Lenines and Trotzkys is destroying itself,
the most apparent and surest proof being the startling lessening of
production. As he pictures the situation, socialism in Europe "has
wrecked itself on the rock of production." It is a complete wreck
there, and is rapidly approaching the wreck in the United States.
The warning of Mr. Hoover should not be necessary to prevent this
country from plunging into the same miseries which grip Europe.
Those who have eyes surely can see what the prospect is. A sensible
solution must and will be found.

CLEVEUAND, Sept. 23. Action
upon the demands for a sixty per cent
increase in wages, reduction of the
working day from the eight hours
now assigned to actual labor "at the
face" of the coal seam to six hours
underground, counting time taken to
go from the shaft mouth and return,
and other features of the mine work
ers' program, was put over until to
morrow by a roll call forced in the
convention of the United Mine Work
ers of America today on a question
of appointment or election of audit
ors, organizers and other salaried
field workers of the union. A pro
posal backed by the organization
forces to refer the question to a com
mittee to report at the next biennial
convention wa scarried by a stand
ing vote but the opposition called
for a roll call, which occupied the
entire afternoon and evening.
A resolution to extend sympathy
and support to the striking steel
workers, but only by such measures
as can be "legally" employed under
the union agreements with the opera
tors, was adopted, the convention
thereby disposing pf the proposal in
troduced Saturday to call strikes In
aid of the steel men wherever coal is
mined or was being used to the det
riment of the steel workers' cause.
The Washington agreement under
which the miners are now working
forbids strikes during the life of the
agreement. The resolution gave as
a further reason against indulging in
any sympathetic strike at this time
the fact that the miners organiza
tion is itself facing the possibility of
'The church should en

Gains Nineteen Pounds "Just
Seems Too Good to Bs True."
"I am so happy over the woudev-
ful improvement of my health since
I commenced taking Tanlac I just
want to tell everybody I meet about
it," said Mrs. H. H. Harner who
lives at 736 West 41st Place, Los
Angeles, Ca.1.', the other day..
"It seems' too good to be true,"
continued Mrs. Ha -nci!-. in Asking
about her recovery to health by
using Tanlac, "for I was in wretch
ed health for about six years, and
everything I had tried in the way
of medicine and treatments had fail
ed to do me any good at all. In
fact, I had about given lip all hope
of ever finding a . medicine that !
would overcome my trouble. What
I suffered during these years on ac-1
count of the awful condition of myj
stomach, simply cannot be told in
words. Every time I ate anything;
I would have terrible cramping j
spells afterwards. I was nervous,
too, and such a thing as a good,
night's sleep was out of the ques
tion with me. I just seemed to lose
all my strength and energy and fi-;
nally got so weak and run ' down j
that I could hardly get about at all. j
I went down in weight from one
hundred and seventy-seven, to one j
hundred and forty-nine pounds, and i
you can imagine how much I must
have gone through.
"Well, about five weeks ago I de
cided to give Tanlac a trial and
see if it would do me any good,
and Just in that short space of time
I have actually gotten back nineteen
pounds of my lost weight. Why, I
began to pick up before I had fin
ished my first bottle of this won
derful medicine and I just continued
to improve until ' I am as well and
hearty now as I ever was. I never
have a pain or ache of any kind
and my stomach trouble has been
so completely overcome that I can
eat just anything I want and I
never suffer afterwards. All the
nervousness has left me and I sleep
just like a child every night. In
fact, I just feel perfectly well all
the. time, and I never lost an op
portunity to say a good word for
Tanlac."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. Sept. 23. Trading in
stocks today was dull and. uncertain
of tone after the firm opening, but
became active and strong in the later
dealings when steels and other popu
lar issues rose to top prices of the
session. Advices from leading centers
indicated no pronounced change m the
steel situation. Shorts again hesitated
to avail themselves of Buch advan
tages as might accrue from prevailing
labor troubles.
Distinctive Bteel shares were under
restraint from the outset, but m no
case was the setback more than nomi-
nal. United States Steel was 1
nninta lniror at t9 minimum, but TG-
sponded to substantial buying at the
end, closing unchanged at 102.
Tobaccos, oils and food issues again
ran counter to the general tendency,
gains in those divisions ranging from
2 to 7 points, with American Tobacco,
Retail Stores, Mexican Petroleum,
Texas company and American Sugar
as the chief features of strength, Sales
975,000 shares.
Liberty issues of bonds were firm
and the international group moderate
ly irregular, but the general bond mar
ket eased on reactions among specu
lative rails and utilities. Sales, par
value, aggregated $13,650,000. Old
United States 4's rose 4 per cent on
call. .
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO. Sept. 23, Corn bulged
in price today despite a weak start.
The upturn was due to shorts taking
fright over scantiness of receipts and
of offerings. Notice that both E. H.
Gary and John Fitzpatrick had been
called to appear before a senate com
mittee, tended also to stimulate buy
ing. The market closed strong, lc
to 54c net higher, with December
$1.28 to $1.28 and May $1.25 to
$1.25. Oats finished c to c up
and provisions varying from 2c de
cline to 95c advance.
Misgivings on the part of the shorts
in the corn trade were emphasized by
assertions in some quarters that farm
commodities had of late dropped to a
point probably below the real cost of
production. Shorts who tried to cover
found offerings lights and the'market
ran up sharply, September in particu
lar during the rush that ensued to
close out open trades.
It was much later before announce
ment was made of senate plans in re
gard to a strike investigation, but the
effect was evident in the increased
strength at the last. Early strength
was ascribed to overnight advices
from the strike centers.
Oats merely paralleled the action of
corn. Provisions were ruled by grain.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK. Sept. 23. Cotton clos
ed strcnK at a net advance of 38 to 60
points.
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK. Sept. 23. Bar silver.
$1.15. Oiher metals unchanged.

faffering Described At Tortsrt
ReHeTed by Black-Draught
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, ol
Ihls plaiw, writes: "My husband is aa
engineer, and once while lifting, he in
lured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
to sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and fell, off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
tike he would die. We had three different
doctors, yet with all their midicine, his
bowels failed to act.He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
(t two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sent and bought Thedford's Black
Draught 1 made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got relief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owe his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught"

NURSE LOCATED
ON NAGO ROAD
Miss Amy Potts, Warren ; district
public health nurse, working under
the auspices of the Warren district
Red Cross chapter, has opened head
quarters on the Naco road in John
ston addition, where she will have
regular office hours daily, except
Sunday, from 1 p. m. to 3 p. m. Dur
ing the next month it is planned by
the public health nursing committee
of the local Red Cross to have Miss
Potts devote a considerable amount
of time to some individual district,
and Johnston addition was the first
district selected for the concentrated
work.
After a month or more spent con
tinuously in one district, during
which time the rople of that district
will have the opportunity to gt ac
quainted with the work of the nurse,
and for the nurse to get in close
touch with the public health . needs
of the district, another headquarters
will be established and only one oi
two afternoons a week given to the
earlier location.
The public, health nurse movement
Is sweeping the country as a part oT
the home service work of the Ameri
can Red Cross, and probably no or
ganization in the country is better
fitted, both in equipment and per
sonnel and in the hearts of the peo
ple, to undertake to instruct the na
tion in the principles of good health.
While Miss Potts has been in the
district for only a little over a month,
her work up to the preseit time has
been devoted to the care of soldier
cases coming to the attention of the
Red Cross headquarters and to civilian-
cases coming to the attention
of the Warren - District Relief asso
ciation. The public health nurse is
in the district to serve and will be
pleased to get calls to places whero
she can - be of assistance. Commu
nication should be sent to the local
Red Cross headquarters in the Li
brary building, where they . will re
ceive immediate attention.
PUBLIC HRRKET
i TO
CONDUCTED Bf
EIIL
1
That the public market which is be
ing conducted at Lowell under the di
rection of the American Legion com
mittee on the high cost of living will
soon be housed, according to all ex
pectations, in a building of its own,
was announced yesterday by Ira B.
Joralenion, who has been in charge of
tne venture.
The board of county supervisors, at
its last meeting, agroed to furnish the
building for the market, provided that
the committee in charge would give a
five-year guarantee. This, guarantee
has been debated by those interested
in the work, and notification that it
will be given will be made to the su
pervisors at their meeting on Octo
ber 4. ?
Another proposal of importance
which is still under consideration is
that of E. A. Tovrea, vdiich hinges
upon the question of putting a refrig
erator in the new building. Tovrea,
it is announced, has made known his
willir.sness to slaughter all cattle and
have them inspected by the govern
ment at a price to the ranchers which
is considered very fair. He will hold
the meat for 24 '.hours, and will then
turn it over to the original owners
for sale at the market. The proposal
has been received by the ranchers, the
only objection being that there will be
considerable difficulty in accepting the
plan by some of ihe cattle raisers Be
cause of the , distance between their
ranches and the slaughter house.
The present committee in charge of
the market Is composed of Harly
Cox, representing the city of Lowell,
and Dan Anguis, representing the
American Legion. Another member is
yet to be selected by the city of Bis
bee. The market will be open this
morning, as usual.

As a soldier, he realized the part they would play in
