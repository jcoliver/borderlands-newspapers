K ser. Olympia, Admiral Dewey's flagship at the battle of
Manila Bay, ran aground in the fog off Block Island early
today. The cruiser was reported in a bad position with con
siderable water in her hold. Chief Machinist's Mate William
Babb, lost his life when he was struck on the head by a falling
hatch. No other fatalities were reported.
Warships and wrecking vessels were standing by the ship
tonieht. The sea remained calm, but it was reported that as
a precautionary measure a part of the crew had been taken off.
The Olympia put out yesterday for target practice and it
is supposed she struck during the thick fog which stretched
far out from shore. Details of her exact position could not
be learned here.

JUDGE, JUROR AND
ATTORNEY CLASH IN
FRISCO BOMB TRIAL
(Dy Review Leased Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO, June 26. Twenty-two
witnesses were put on the stand
by the state today in an attempt to
prove that Mrs. Rena Mooney, whose
trial on a murder charge grew out of
the bomb expiosion here last July, was
actively involved in an alleged anar
chistic conspiracy against the govern
ment which the prosecution -contended
culminated in the bomb murders and
the killing ten persons.
Superior Judge Emmett Seawell
overruled repeated objections on the
part of the attorneys for the defense
who tried to keep out testimony tend
ing to prove a conspiracy. The al
leged unlawful acts of Mrs. Mooney,
Thomas J. Mooney and Warren K. Bit
lings, the latter two of whom were
sentenced respectively to death and
life imprisonment for one of the bomb
murders, from 1913 to within a few
days of the bomb explosion was gone
into detail by the state's witnesses.
The alleged activities of Mr. and
Mrs. Mooney in attempting to start a
street car stirke in San Francisco
last July were testified to by a number
of witnesses. The dynamiting of three
eiectric power towers near San Fran
cisco on the night of June 10, 1916.
with which the state declared it would
connect some of the defendants in thc
bomb cases, figured in the testimony.
Other feautres of the day's pror

Juror Frank M. Channtng to the open

the Infliction of a $10 fine on Attorney

Russians' Envoy
Senate Throws Dignity Aside
In Welcoming Ambassador
Bakhmetieff And Other
Members of War Mission.
( Kv Review Lensed Wire)
WASHINGTON. June L'6 In anoth
er stirring address today at the capi
tol. Ambassador Pakluneticff. head of
Russia's diplomatic mission, gave a i.Vl-
emn pledge that tiie Kusvan people
and army "convinced that a separate
peace would mean the triumph of Ger
man autocracy," are prepared to fight
on beside America until the world has
been made safe for democracy.
The ambassador spoke before the
senate and was given a reception al
most as enthusiastic as that accorded
Saturday in the house. On no previous
occasion since the war began lias sen
atorial reserve been cast so completely
aside. At the conclusion of the ad
dress a resolution was adopted by
unanimous consent expressing the sen
ate's gratification over the stand of
the newest democracy.
"Russia's rejects wkh indignation
any idea jf separate peace," said the
envoy. "Striving lor a lasting peace
based on democratic principles estab
lished by democratic will, the Russian
people and army are rallying their
forces around the banners of freeiiom.
Russia wants the world to be safe for
democracy. To make it safe means to
have democracy rule the world."
Many "of the rumors of industrial dis
sensions in Russia. Mr. Bakhmetieff
said, grew out of misunderstanding of
the changes taking place in the trans
formation of Russia to democratic
standards. He pleaded for patience
and confidence that these changes, al
though they might take time, would be
worked out successfully in the end.

Senate Would Empower Wilson
To Bring National Prohibition
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 2. The ad

by the house was re-written today by
a senate agricultral sub-committee so
as to give President Wilson the pow.T
and responsibility of deciding wheth
er the nation shall be "rone-dry" dur
ing the war and to place iron, and steel
and many other products in addition to
food and munitions under government
control.
Advocates and opponents predicted
passage by Saturday. As a substitute
for the house prohibition sections
which without qualification forbid the
manufacture of foodstuff Into liquor,
the sub-committee added provisions
which would prohibit manufacture,
during the war, of all intoxicating bev
erages and empower the president to
commandeer existing supplies of dis
tilled spirits, but would authorize the
executive In his discretion to permit
manufacture of malted, fermented and

Sheriff Announces He Will
Use Force to Prevent Any
Disorders During Trouble
Tombstone, Ariz.. June 26, 1917.
I have been informed this day that a strike is con
templated in Bisbee by the I W. W's. I was asked as
to what stand I would take. This is my answer:
I shall Derform my full duty, which, according to
law. is as follows:
To protect all men in their constitutional rights as
citizens of this state and of the United States of Amrei
ica, and all aliens in peaceful pursuit of their daily labor
or vocations.
To orotect all private and public property and to en
force all laws appertaining thereto.
In general preserve the peace, law and order of the
community.
It is difficult for me to believe, especially at this time,
that any loyal American, or body of Americans, would
contemplate anything which might in the slightest de
srree cripple the povernment of our country. The clos
ing down or hindrance of the great copper industry in
this section, would prove a direct blow, and a heavy
one. to the government of the United States.
I beg those interested to take notice that I will, in
case of anv disorder calculated to injure or harm th&.
interests of this community, or of the United States of
America, call upon and deputize, if necessary, every
able-bodied loyal American in Cochise countv to assist
me in preserving peace and order, and, should necessity
exist therefore, I shall not hesitate to demand aid and
assistance from both the state and federal governments.,

which went to trial here yesterday,

IKES DEMAND 01 LOCAL
1ES; WALKOUT CALLED
No Attention Paid Demands of I. W. W. By Management of
Operators. Meeting Held At City Park Last Evening
Unenthusiastic Promises Made To Men For Their
Support. Stand of Officers Warns Trouble-makers In

SEVEN demands were presented to the operators of the
Warren District yesterday afternoon by a commtitee chim
ro represent the Bisbee branch of the Metal Workers of the
I. W. W. The companies took no cognizance of the demands
nor of the committee.
The demands, presented, are:
First The abolition of the physical examination.
Second Two men t owork on machines.
Third Two men to work together in all raises.
Fourth To discontinue all blasting during the shaft.
Fifth The abolition of all bonus and contract work.
Sixth To abolish the sliding scale. All men t'nder
ground a minimum flat rate of $6.00 per shift. Top men
$5.50 per shift.
Seventh No discrimination to be shown against
members of any organization.
Last evening at the city park six members of the I. W. W.
organization addressed an enthusiastic crowd cn k-h.-lf of
their demands to the companies. The speakers urged that all
of the men in the Warren District walk out this morning.
They promised relief to men of families and asked that 'hose
interested aDpear at their hall and participate in the appoint
ment and selection of pickets.
On the whole, the meeting was unsatisfactory frorn a
point of view of the I. W. W. A considerable number of
in attendance were I. W. W. members. Throughout the our
of speaking, however, little enthusiasm wa3 evinced. Idl cur
iosity drew the larger proportion of the crowd to the prk. A
peculiar feature of the meeting was the fact that hardly one
of the speakers was known to the crowd.
Walkout Part of State-wide Scheme
Strike Unpopular Among Men.
That the proposal of the I. W. W.
to enforce a walkout In the Warren
District is unpopular with the rank
and file of the miners, was the tenor
of all opinions heard on the streets of
the city last evening. It was pointed
but by several union men that the I.

and that the present effort was a part
of a general stand of the organization

would walk out this morning.

Suits From $25 to $45
Upholds State Law That Em
ployes Must Be Paid On
Day of Discharge. Several
Cochise County Cases
Among Number.
Several opinions were handed down
by the supreme court yesterday, none
ol them of great importance, though
one of them is not without interest.
It is the Arizona Power company, ap
pellant against the state, from Yaya
pal county. It was instituted by T. F.
Caughlin against the power company
whose service he had quit and had
been required by the company to wait
until the regular pay day. before re
ceiving the amount due him. The
company was charged with a violation
of the law which provides that an em
ploye shall be paid when he quits the
tervice of his employer.
The case was tried before Judge
Smith of Yavapai county without a
jury and a verdict and judgment were
rendered against the defendant com
pany. It w-as the contention of the
company that the law was a violation
of the constitution which guarantees
a validity of contracts. Under the
terms of its charter the company had
formed certain regulations regarding
the time of the payment of its em
ployes and that its contracts with
them recognized the terms of payment
with respect to time.
The opinion of the court upholds the
validity of the lay and affirms the
judgment of the lower court.
In the case of Mary M. Mannion, ap
pellant, against Theodora W. Marsh,
appelle, from Santa Cruz county, the
judgment of the lower court is re
versed with directions that the appel
lee's complaint be dismissed. In this
case the appellant had made a home
stead entry including a tract of about
eight acres upon which the appellee
asserted some sort of a claim. It was
the contention of the appellant that
the government having permitted her
to file on the several legal subdivisions
described, she is entitled to possession
of all of it.
In the case of the Warren company,
appellant against L. Willard Whitt, a
minor, appellee not reversable error
was found and the judgment of the
lower court of Cochise county was af
firmed. This was an action for dam
ages for which a verdict awarding $7,
000 had been rendered on account of
injuries sustained by the overturning
of an automobile he was driving on an
uneven street.
Other cases were Aurella B. Sparks
and Harry C. Wheeler, appellants,
against Douglua & Sparks Realty com
pany, appellee, Cochise county, judg
ment affirmed; Francisco Porras, ap
pellant against the state of Arizona,
respondent. Greenlee county affirmed
The appellant had been quilty of vio
lating the prohibtion law. An appeal
was taken on the ground that there
was insufficient evidence to convict.
The supreme court held that though
the evidence was conflicting that was a
matter for the jury to decide.
In the case of H. S. Corbett, trustee,
appellant against Sv L. Kingan, ap
pellee and Ferrand O. Benedict, de
fendant, from Pima county, the judg
ment of the lower court was reversed
and a new trial ordered.
Motions foV rehearings were denied
in the following cases: Southern Pa
cific Railroad company vs. State of Ar
izona; William Henry Marshall vs.
State of Arizona; Eugene S. Ives vs K.
F. Sanguinetti; R. M. Fuqua vs. State
of Arizona; O. B. Hall and J. J. Klliott
vs. State of Arizona.
The Southern Pacific case is one
in which the right of the state corpo
ration commission to fix rati-s at which
circus trains shall be transported with
in the state is upheld. The Marshall
Fuqua and Hall and Klliott cases are
bootlegging cases. R. M. Fuqua is a
wealthy Phoenix man who was con
victed about a year ago of violation of
the prohibitory law in illeeally trans
porting by motor car, intoxicating liqu
or across the state line. J. J. Klliott
did not join in the motion for a rehear
ing as he was pardoned by the governor.

GLOBE, June 26. The miners and

In the Globe-Miami district there
are representatives of each of the na
tions bearing arms with the United
States in the comon cause of liberty.
These representatives will be desig

of guns in honor of thp flag. .
Representatives of the several na

of heart and soul in tribute to their
brothers upon the fields of battle and

t'ons. It will not only l.e a;i immense
occasion in breadth, bu. all from the
standpoint of public -.irt ic-ii:it ion and !
of novelty. No previous a.-'seinblaue
of international llacs for public honor j
nnd aslute has even been bad in Ari
zona. None othr has Imm ii planno l
in the state to this time, but the Globe ,
idea will doubtless find Much of l lie
copying that is now beiiu "reed for it
on the Fourih of July. Ii can nlso le
said that international Mag asHmbi- !
ages and salutes have h"i n very infre- !
quent in the history f the United !
States and seldom if ever, practiced j
away from its main wapovts. Globe,
in the Arizona desert, land of copper, !
poin's the way. j
The American flag to he used in the ,
Globe assemblage will provide a con- ;
sinerable feature in itself. Plans are !
under way to have it made by patriot-
ic women of the city, and to make it j
laruer than any other flag to this time ;
hoisted in the state. A fifty foot em- I
blem is considered. Its nearest ap-,
proach in the st;te will be a .".."i-foot j
flac made by patriotic women of l?is- '
bee and hoist to the top of the lrghest j
peak; overlook n that copper city on 1
registration day, when great outburst ,
of patriotic fervor was created. I
Why r.ot adopt the Globe idea ;n this 1
city which has representatives of all
the allied nations of the United
States and let them join the parade
and have the salute fire at the City
riaza as each flag makes its appear
ance at that point. Bisbee should not
be out done by Globe in this respect.

XEW YORK. June 26. Prominence

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, June 2C. Announcement
that harvesting had begun in Kansas
acted as a bearish factor in today's
wheat market. Prices, although
steady at the close, were 1 cent net
lower with July at 2.09 and September
1.84. Corn finished 2M to 34 down,
oats unchanged to to down, and
provisions closed at a decline of 35
cents to ITi cents.
Several places in Kansas reported
that cutting of wheat was in progress
and there were also advices that new
wheat from Oklahoma was arriving at
St. Louis. Bullish reports that farm
era in Texas were binning most of
their wheat as soon as it was threshed
were given conKiderable notice.
Sultry weather, just the kind to pro
mote the growth of corn, led to aggres
sive selling of that cereal. Beneficial
rains in Kansas, Oklahoma. Nebraska
and Mississippi counted against the
bull.
Oats were sustained by export pur
chases that were said amounted to
800.000 bushels. The prohibition fea
tures of the food control bill remained
to a degree a depressing influence on
values.
Provisions weakened in sympathy
wiUt the bog market. Thera also was
disappointment over the withdrawal of
-tbBelgian relief commission as a
prospective large buyer.

MIAMI UNION DEFERS
ACTION; SITUATION IN
GLOBE IS IMPROVING
(By Review Leased Wire.)
GLOBE, June 26 While the Miami
Miners' union decided toni:;ht that it
will formally present a number of de
mands to the Inspiration Consolidated
and Miami Copper companies next
Thursday, the Globe union failed to
set any definite date for final action.
In view of the fact that the local
council of defense and a large number
of business men have come out openly
in opposition to the pi'jposed strike,
and have been covering the district
with hand-bills calling upon the men
not to walk out. it is thought that
trouble will be averted.
The situation in Globe is brighter
than in Miami. In this city the elec
tricians, boiler-makers and several
other allied crafts have already gone
on record as opposed tb a strike and
they are attempting to influence the
miners.
There is no wage question here. The
demands, which were framed two
weeks ago, provide for: Permission of
organizers to go on the companies'
properties; equal representation on the
hospital board; grievance committees
to be elected by the unions; a guaran
tee of no discrimination against union
men, and the discharge of all men who
oppose the union.

SALT LAKE. Utah. June 26. Col
ton is the farthest point east in the
Price river flood district which could
be reached tonight by telephone, all
line of communication being down be
yond that point. At that point it was
reported that the water had receded
about three feet and the Mammoth
reservoir in Gooseberry creek is now
empty save of the water that is run
ning in from the melting snow, the
dam having gone out to its foundation
near the center of the core.
Seven railroad bridges on the Den
ver & Rio Grande line between Col
ton and Castle Gate have been washed
out and three or four bridges a Pong the
state highway also Iruve gone out. At
Castle Gate five company houses were
undermined by the water and col
lapsed. The tenants had moved out
seeking higher ground and no loss of
life or injuries were reported.
The last report received from Price
was that the diversion dam, ab'jut two
miles and a half above thj Price is
holding, but that the earthworks at
each wing had been cut open to keep
the water in the river bed and keep it
from inundating the entire valley.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WITH THE ROOT MISSION EN-
ROUTE FROM MOSCOW TO PET
ROGRAD, Sunday, June 24. The Root
mission left Moscow for Petrograd to
night with a distinct sense of encour
agement. "I have derived much more encour
agement from my observations Vf con
ditions in Moscow than I expected."
said Mr. Root. "It seems clear that
the men we met there and the classes
they represent are patriotically devot
ed to th task of bringing the country
through her present difficulties. I
may say that I think after visiting
Moscow that there is a fair chance of
their succeeding.
"I believe that the cloud which rest
ed over the peasant population and
some of the less well informed classes
already shows signs of lifting. They
are attaining a conception of the
meaning of their new liberty and of
the way in which to preserve it."

Warns women against cutting
corns and says they lift
right out.
Because style decrees that women
crtiwd and buckle up their tender toes
in high heel footwear they suffer from
corns, then they cut and tr'n at these
painful pests which merely makes the
corn grow hard. This suicidal habit
may cause lockjaw and women are
warned to stop It
A few drops of a drug called freez
one applied directly upon a sore corn
gives quick relief and soon the entire
corn, ioot and all, lifts out without
pain. Ask the drug store man for a
quarter of an ounce of freezone, which
costs very little but is sufficient to re
move every hard or soft com or callus
from one's feet.
This drug is gummy but it dries in
a moment and simply shrivels up the
corn without inflaming tr ever irri
tating the surrounding tissue or skin.

"A SPLENDID TCSIC "
Says Hixson Lady Who, On Doc
tor's Advice, Took Cardiii
And Is Now Well.
Hixson, Tenn. "About 10 years ago
I was..." says Mrs. J. B. Gadd. of
this place. "I suffered with a pain In
my left side, could not sleep at night
with this pain, always In the left
side...
My doctor told me to use Cardui. I
took one bottle, which helped me and
after my baby came, I was stronger
and better, but the pain was still
there.
I at first let it go, but began to get
weak and in a run-down condition,
so I decided to try some more Cardui,
which I did.
This last Cardui which I took mado
me much better, in fact, cured me. It
has been a number of years, still I
have no return of this trouble.
I feel it was Cardui that cured me,
and I recommend it as a splendid fe
male tonic."
Don't allow yourself to become
weak and run-down from womanly
troubles. Take Cardui. It should sure
ly help you, as it has so many thou
sands of other women in the past 40
years. Headache, backache, sideache,
nervousness, sleeplessness, t!red-out
feeling, are all signs of womanly trou
ble. Other women get relief by taking

HIGH TREASON.
. High treason stalks in our midst in the guise of
the Bisbee branch of the Industrial Workers of the
World. This organization, whose leaders have no
jobs, no families and no interests in the Warren
District, seeks to disrupt the even, peaceful tenor
of our course and to jeopardise a large unit of the
copper producing industry of the country. In short,
it becomes an effort to cripple not only Bisbee, not
only the local copper producers, but the United States
of America.
It is nothing short of treason, incipient and ter
rible. With living and working conditions better than at
an time in the history of the District, we see men
with no interest here, with no wives and homes, and
with no means of self support, attempting to use the
miners of this camp for their sinister purpose. They
are cloaked in a mantle of deceit, which may have
its appeal to some of the men, but which has, as its
ultimate object, the paralyzing of the industrial pre
paredness of the federal government.
The situation does not need a long stretch of the
imagination to label it correctly.
It is treason!
Those who fall into the I. W. W. snare will be the
tools of a deep laid plot to cripple the people of the
United States in the prosecution of the business at
hand pur war with Germany
LOS ANGELES OPTIMISM.
If there is one Southern California trait which we ad
mire it is the optimism appearing on the surface in that
balmy clime. Los Angeles seems to have cornered the
market in this regard and the Angel City's papers fairly
ooze with the "sunny side."
Witness a case in point:
"In Southern California during the summer most of the
rivers run under the surface of the ground instead oi
above iL That's one of the little things among the many
which serve to differentiate this part of the country and
to make it more attractive than others. Any State can
isliow rivers which run in the ordinary way on top of the
ground, but few can point to streams flowing beneath
their beds.
"The less favored States have to be content in summer
with the ojd swimming pools; Southern California, thanks
to its underground rivers, has the new swimimng pools.
The municipal playground department of Los Angeles
has reopened for the season the swimming pool in the
Arroyo Seco near Sycamore Park. It's a remarkable
plunge and one which attracts boys from all over the
city."
Arizona is, to a greater or less extent, in the same
catagory with Southern California when it comes to these
"underground rivers," which "accomodate" the people
by going by so as to be of the last possible trouble to
residents and tourists. Arizona has many a swimming
pool, such as Los Angeles utilized. There are so many,
in fact, that it would be difficult to determine where
to begin.
Come to consider the whole matter, however. Arizona
is too busy developing its real resources; too busy mak
ing money; too busy in an industrial way to have to con
sider ways aud means for fooling the susceptible touris'
into believing that a naturally arid desert is a blcssiur
in disguise. When Arizonaus have a little time to sparf
they write their check, take a train and get into Southern
California's one attraction the Pacific Ocean.
The regular army which will be sent abroad has had j
its efficiency impaired by the necessity of filling up withj
untrained men. Even this small establishment is not H
ready, not even with men. and less ready with material.
Now it seems as if the national guard could not be
mobilized until September. The work If getting the
camps ready delays calling the men Into service. Con
sider what this means. We begin war in eany April
and cannot get even the national guard into training
camps before September and it may take more time.
We do not know how long after that it will require to
put the guard Into shape fit for modern war. It may take
nine or tea months. It might take longer.
The conscript army will be inadequately officered fori
training and maintenance of discipline It may require
the services of the national guard and of what is left of!
the regular army to keep the new men in hand while j
they are being taught the military virtues. j
We have a task of over a year before the American j
army will take shape as a dependable, reliable instru
ment of national defense. It may take much longer.
i
And all this time we are at war, entirely helpless if we j
were not protected, struggling to get on our feet. We:
never would be able to do It if we were single handed in j
the fight. !
The moral is as plain as day. The United States can-:
not afford to expose itself In this fashion again. We need
a continuing military policy which will give us an army
and keep an army for us. The time to adopt this policy
and put it in operation is now. Now our deficiencies and
the dangers to which they expose us are apparent.
If congress will pass a universal service law we shall j I
have a correct military policy adopted. Then call out the j
young men of 19 as soon as equipment can be provided:
for them and training establishments provided for them,
and we shall lay the foundation of American security upon j
a firm basis.
We have accepted the justice of universal service by
adopting the selective conscription, but that is a com-;
promise, and we have no legislation which will provide
an army after the war is over. This will not be the last
time the United States will need an army. It ought to
be the last time it is found without one and the better
the army the less the danger of needing it.
Americans have to say: "Thank God for the British
navy. It keeps the Germans out of America " They
ought also to say: "Never again."

PREPARE NOW.
Nearly every week brings a government statement or
intimation that the mobilizing of the American army will
be delayed longer than expected, says the Chicago Tri
bune. We are getting proof that is is next to impossible
to prepare for war after war lias started.
If there were no purpose to lie served by this experi
ence we might accept the situation and do the best vn
can as rapidly as we can, thanking God that there is a
bulwark of allies between us and our enemies and that
one of our allies controls the sea.
But there is a purpose to be served by it if we are
willing to take full value from experience, and if we are
not willing to do that now the next time we have to rais
an army we may be betrayed and not protected by conditions.
THE SOCIALIST CONFERENCE.
Socialists, professing the Marxian ideal of Internation
alism, but led astray by the complete domination of the
cult by Wilhelm and his advisors in Germany, are seek
ing to inviegle their "Comrades" from other countries to
Stockholm to "put an end to the bloody conflict now
raging."
If the Stockholm conference was free and unbiased, its
conclusions might be watched with a interest born of a
hope that the Socialists would put forth a sane, above
board, reasonable proposal to the various warring coun
tries. As it is the conference has degenerated into a
hopeless and useless publicity campaign for the German
autocracy.
American Socialists have had little to do with the
Stockholm affair. Let it not be understood mat tnej
would not have participated but the distance and other
things prevented. Then too, the American socialists,
those who are Americans first and Socialists second.
those w
come to pass in the day of time, have thrown the whole
thing overboard. The Americans real Americans here

The Stockholm conference is not fraught with any
dangers to America. It is "bunk" in the strictest sense
of the word. It merely discloses, though, to what length
Pro-Germans in this and other countries will go, when
stimulated by the war lord of Potsdam.
BISBEE'S RED CROSS DONATION.
Bisbee and the Warren District is justified in its feel
ing of pride in the manner which the quqta for the Amer
ican Red Cross fund of $100,000,000 was raised. Bisbee
was debited with a charge of $15,000 by the western
headquarters When the books are balanced it will be
shown that this community contributed about $8.o00 more
than it owed the cause.
Judging from the manner in which the Red Cross fund
and the Liberty Loan campaign were readily taken up
here, can there be any doubt as to the position take-i
by Southern Arizona in the business at hand? Can there
be any truth in the assertion, sometimes made here and
elsewhere, that the people are not behind the govern
ment? Facts speak for themselves in this respect and
there are few places in the entire country which havt
not approximated the Warren' District's example.

FIRE IN HUACHUCAS.
Late yesterday a forest fire broke
out in Ash canyon, in the Huachuca

gained considerable headway last
night, judging from the reflection that
could be seen fini the road between
here and Tombstone. The fire was
reported to the forest ranger station
and men "are already on the ground
fighting it. It is to be hoped that it
will be stopped before it has gained
much headway as there is quite a
large amount of timber in the canyon.

ALL MAKE GOOD.
The First Arizona regiment sent
twenty-five men to the first oificers'
training camp, and all these twenty
five have made go'jd and will get com
missions as officer. That is the word
that was received in Naco yesterday
at the headquarters of the regiment.
The next officers' training camp will
be at Leon Springs, Tex., August 27.
and after that all men for training
camps for officers will be taken from
the ranks of the enlisted men. The
opinion prevails that there toill be only
a few civilians from Arizona at the
next officers' training camp, as the to
tal tv be selected lor officers i3 only
40, and the majority of that number
will come from the ranks of the First
Arizona regiment.

THE CAUSE
Many Bisbee People Have Kidney
Trouble And Do Not Know it.
Do you have backache?
Are you tired and worn out?
Feel dizzy, nervous and depressed?
Are the kidney secretions irregular?
Highly colored: contain sediment?
Likely your kidneys are at fault.
Weak kidneys give warning of dis
tress. Heed the warning; don't delay
I'se a tested kidney remedy.
Read this Bisbee testimony.
t'has. Rendleman, miner, of 158 Op
era Drive, says: "Twelve years ago
my kidneys were in awful shape. I
could hardly nfjve, my back was so
lame and stiff. My kidneys were weak
and acted irregularly. The kidney se
cretions were highly colored and 1 had
to get up often at night to pass them.
When I tried to bend over sharp pains
would dart through my hack and 1
would become dizzy. A friend told me
about Doan's Kidney Pills and I tried
them. Two boxes completely cured
me. Since then I have used a few Vf
Doan's Kidney Pills occasionally and
they have kept my kidneys well and
strong."
