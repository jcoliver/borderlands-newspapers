Senator Reed of Missouri De
clares Proposed Bill Would
Tear Down All of Nation's
Anti-trust Laws.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Dec. 11. Warning
that tne United States must prepare
to assume further burdens to win thf
war was given today in the senate by
Senator Reed in vigorously opposing
as a trust scheme, the Webb export
combination bill, which President WiV
son in his recent address urged con
gress to enact.
Iwclaring that congress should con
enlrate upon great war problems and
defer consideration of such legisla
tion as the export t-ade measure, the
Missouri senator said that with "Rus
sia out of the war and Rumania also
pone." the enemy, numerically, a&w
is superior in manpower.
Although an opponent of army cou
pcr.ptlon. Senator Reed predicted that
new draft levies probably would be
necessary and urged military training
for youths between 18 and 21 for
coast defense work. Invasion of
America, he asserted was not beyond
the realms of possibilities should
other allied powers fall b?side Rus
sia, Rumania and Serbia. .
Reed Denounces Bill.
The Webb bill was dnouiiced by
Senator Reed as destructive of the
Sherman anti-trust law at behest of
trusts and monopolies and proposed
legalizing of illegal combinations
which would encroach- on consumers
abroad and increase domestic prices.
"It epeals," he said, "every vestige
( of that system of anti-trust statutes
built un during 28 years by the feder
al government so far as the sao:e ap
ples to commeice with foreign pow
ers. It is intended to legalize the cre
ation of combination and trusts to
control every foreign market in which
the American citizen may seek to sell
his goods. Indirectly it will enable
these same combinations to control
the domestic markets, because of the
price of the sur-'us that goes abroad
to Had a nrarktt controls the price
of the home rr.duct
Trusts Assailed.
"This legislation has the enthus.
iastic -support of the allied trusts of
the United States, together with their
servants, agents, employes and sym
pathizers. It will be supported by
every newspaper that believes in the
control of big business, which re
gards every effort to limit or cir
cumschibe the powers of capital as
undesirable and dangerous.
"The second outstanding fact is
that this system of laws which had
for their purpose the preservation of
free and open markets for the Ameri
can people and which were common
ly known as the trust statutes, which
were originally passed by the repu
blican party on the secon day of
July, 1889, and during intervening
years have been frequently amended
and laboriously construed until they
have become a great code of verile
laws behind which honest business
can take refug.e are now sought to be
disemboweled during a democratic
administration and at a time when the
clouds and anxieties of war have dis
tracted the attention of the country
from any legislation except that per
taining to the pending conflict."
Senator Cummins of Iowa, also op
posed the bill as a virtual repeal of
foreign trade combination provisions
of the Sherman law. .
Defending the measure were Sena
tor Pomerene of Ohio, who bag It in
charge, and Senator Townsend of
Michigan. Debate was not conclud
ed and opposition threatened to in
terfere with the leaders' plans to pass
it before the holiday recess.

WASHINGTON, Dec. 11. All gen

medical boards and efficiency boards
"with a view to determining the ad

Commanders for- American troops
at the fighting front are to be select
ed only after rigid investigation of
their physical and professional fit
ness. Early announcement of the re

general officers is to be expected, as
medlcial boards already have report

and national guard services.

THIRTEEN NEGROES
PAY PENALTY UPON
GALLOWS FOR RIOT
(Continued From Page One.)
Men Stoical
The condemned negroes had known
of their fate since Sunday. Twelve
of them sought spiritual consolation of
army Y. M. C. A. workers. Outwardly
all of the negroes were stoical. They
did not know the date of the execution,
but last night they were taken from
the cavalry guard house, where they
have been prisoners more than a
month, and placed in separate bar-j ances

Aside from a dozen officers of the
southern department and the sheriff
of Bexar country, no one In the city
or army camps knew of the execution
date or place. The other negro de
fendants were ignorant of the fate of
their companions until after the
formal announcement had been made.
Aroused eBfore Reveille
The condemned men were aroused
this morning a
regular army reveille, 5:30 o'ciVck.
The military guard had been 'summon
ed silently and no sound was beard in
the camp where nearly 40.000 men
were sleeping except the purring of
the army truck motors awaitiug their
loads. The negroes were dressed in
their regular uniforms as carefully as
for inspection.
The negroes executed displayed
neither brazado nor fear. They went
to the execution singing a hymn, but
the singing wes that of soldiers 'on the
inarch. Arrived at th clearing, the
singing stopped, the men, shackled,
were helped from the trucks to the
scaffolds and seated on chairs. A low
"goodbye, boys,' addressed to members
of their military guard, who had been
in
were brought here from Fort Illiss,
was the tnly expression from any of
the negroes.
Prayer Offered
The men's feet were shackled. An
army chaplain offered prayer. An of-1
fleer called "attention" and as on pa-i
rade the negroes stood erect. They j
stood quietly while caps and nooses
were adjusted and then stepped on the
traps. The major in charge of the
execution gave a signal and -soldiers
sprung the traps. The negroes plunged
nine feet to instant death.
Even after the execution and after
the return of the guard to the camp,
news of what had happened did not
spread through the camp or through
the city until announced by the news-1
papers. It created some demon stra-
tion among negroes who had follow-! .
ed the progress of the trial in the na-1 Ul&rles
ture of "nitturnlngs' at a few negro f
churches. Crowds at these, however,!
were small. i
Other Sentences
No announcement has been made
when the 41 negro defendants given
life sentences by the courtmartial will
be taken to Fort Leavenworth.
Of the others, four were sentenced
to dishonorable discharge from tne
army, forfeiture ot an pay ana aiiow-

Wednesday Morning, December 12, 1917
From a score of cities in every section of the country
comes word that fuel and labor are scarce, workshops
busy and food prices soaring.
A great crisis of the war is to come this week if the
German preparations in rufhing men and guns and shells
to the westren front in unprecedented numbeis count for
anything as a shadow thai impending events cast before.
Here is a wan from Kansas City that can hardly be
appreciated in this land of smiling skies and balmy
zephyrs: "No gas; coal supply limited; fewer street car,
and these poorly heated and another cold wave predict
ed for tonight. And neither the gas man nor the coal man
nor the weather man wiil predict any relief."
Eastern railroads hare been commanded by the gov
ernment to send back ten thousand box cars belonging
to railroads of the west. Every one of them U needed
to move the big corn crop to the gulf and Atlantic ports
for shipment to our allies To keep the box cars moving
is another one of the thousand and one things we must do
to win this war.
St. Louis has opened a municipal coal narket. and is
selling coal to the poor In small lots at sixteen cents per
bushel. New York ' going to organize a club to try
to put the food buccaneer out of business.'; New Orleans
cannot move her cotton. St Paul faces a street car
strike. Los Angeles is calling for freight cars. Boston
wants skilled workmen. Cleveland is out of sugar. Sis
bee oh, we don't need any hing here in particular -except
more advertising of Cristmas goods in the newspaper.
President Wilson's last message was received in Paris
with acclaim. Commencing upon it editorially, the El
Diario said: "President Wilson's, words resound through
out the. world, to confirm once more to the world the ir
revocable resolution to pursue to the end the fight for the
liberty of the people. The message is another confirma
tion of that gospel which drew the great pacifist. Presi
dent Wilson, into the war, convinced that only by a war
which destroys Prussian militarism is a world peace possible."
It is expected, yea, hoped, that the president will soon
ask congress for a declaration upon Turkey. Such
declaration would be in keeping with Vnited Slates tra
ditions. Our first war was fought for our liberty. Our
second for the freedom of the seas. Our third to free
this section of the country from Mexican misrule. Our
fourth to free the black mail. Our fifth to free Cuba.
In this war we also fight for freedom. The Turk for av
thousand years has been a blemish upon European civili
zation. Up to the time of the present German methods
he stood without a rival in the field of deceit, cruelty 4
and dishonor. Now he is yoked with Germany, and they
make a great pair; only the devil himself Is worthy to
make the partnership into a trio. Ever steer. Ben Frank
lin printed a paper in Philadelphia the Turks have been
massacring Christians In Europe. Let the ttars and
stripes join the English, French and Italian flags in that
drive that .will eject him from Europe forever.
An Austrian captain of liuzzars, talking to an Ameri
can correspondent in Europe, fully and frankly stated
the difference between Austrian and German troops, more
particularly officers, as follows: "We are not efficient
like the Germans," he said. "Thank God. we are not. We
don't want to be. A German thinks that the end and
aim of human existence Is to be efficient; well, we don't.
We Austrians figure that we have only one life to live
and we want to get all there is out of it. Wc may not
be passing this way again. One must work; that is right
and ona must do it reasonably well. But, good heavens,
these Germans would turn us and everyone else in the
world into machines. A very tedious people the Germans.
They are all brain." Perhaps It is not surprising In tlie
circumstance that the war, from the standpoint of I no
central powers, lias consisted of a series of expeditions
to rescue the Austrians. Every time the Austrians iter!,
ously engaged in a campaign they got Into difficulties
from which they were rescued by the arrival of the Gt r
man troops.
WHAT GERMANS THINK.
(Kansas City Star.)
It is hard for Americans to understand the Germans,
There is a widespread disposition to believe that only a
few fanatics believe in wars of conquest. Public senti
ment in general we assume to be reasonable.
For this reason one of the most useful documents the
government has publisho-1 in tha war is the book. "Con
quest and Kultur," "by Wallace Notestein and Elmer E.
Stall of the University of Minnesota. It Is an exlaordi
nary compilation. Passages, are quote.1 from something
like two hundred German writers, public men, college
professors, clergymen, glorifying successful war as the
highest expression of a nation's life. The compilers say
there was no dearth of material. They had collected about
three times as mucn material as was used "and
could find new passages of similar import as long as they
had library facilities." In contrast to the feeling in Ger
many they say:
The German writers whom the compilers have
read have sought again and again to fan the flame
of German hatred by quoting English utterances
of a similar character, three English utterances in
all, and only one of them comparable to the passages
in his collection. Of French jingoistic utterances
German writers have much to say and little to quote.
They talk with greater vagueness of the ambitions
of America.
Consider this passage printed in 1913, the year be
fore the war. In the Jungdeutschland-Post, a weekly
paper for young people, and imagine anything like it ap
pearing, say, in the Youta's Companion:
War is the noblest and holiest expression of hu
man activity. For us, too, the glad, great hqur of
battle will strike. Stiy and deep in the German hearty
must live the joy of battle and the longing for it lt
us ridicule to the utmost the old women in breeches
who fear war and deplore it as cruel and revolting.
No; war is beautiful.
Here is a passage from a book by Adolf Lassnn. pro
fessor of philosophy in the University of Berlin; con
trast it with the teachings of William James of Harvard
or of John Dewey of Columbia:
It is not jalone that which it already has that a state
defends by war; it is even more, that which, as yet
it- has not, but regards as a necessary gain from the
war. It is abturd to inveigh against wars of con
quest; the sole point of Interest is the object of the
conquest. The state which realizes the highest form '
of culture of the race can realize itself only by tle
destruction of other st-.tes which, logically, can only
be brought about by violence.
Two years before 'the outbreak of the war a German
officer. General Keim, wrote in Der Tag on the necessity
of using offensive warfare as a means of state policy. It
is possible to imagine an American officer like General
Wood, for instance, talking in this strain:
The will to war must go hand in hand with the
resolution to act on the offensive without any
scruples. We can only deplore the fact that it has
become official and parliamentary usage to speak ex
clusively of Germany's "defense," for which she
ought to be prepared. No; Germany ought to be
armed for attack exactly as in 1870. - '
Or contrast this utterance of the kaiser at the laying
of a cornerstone of a Berlin church with the utterances
of any American president from Washington down: -It
is the soldier and the army, not parliamentary
majorities and votes, that have welded the Gercan
empire together. My confidence rests upon the army.
Evidently Germany has been living in a different
world from ours for the last generation. It Is a vorld
In which the state has been exalted as above law; a
world in which might makes right on a national scale.
That is why the German empire has become a menace
to all other peoples. That is why the war cannot sinp
until the German people have learned that these political
theories do not pay and that in the international sphere,
as well as in private life, morality is the best policy.

LIBERTY BONDS AS
PRESENTS IS THE
NEW SUGGESTION
The real patriotic American Christ

even of gold coins, have no place with
he purpose and meaning and effect of
the preservation of Uncle Sam's bonds
which he gives the people for the', loan
of their money to carry on the great
war to a successful conclusion.
Officials of the federal reservo
banks are urging the widest possible
distribution of the Liberty loan bonds,
an especial effort being made this
Christmas time to place the bonds in
:he hands "of practically every citizen
in the country.
Urging the wide distribution of the
Liberty loan bonds, the officials of
the Twelfth Reserve -bank at San
Francisco have asked Governor Camp
bell to call the attention of the people
of Arizona, and especially the banks
of this state, to a continued effort to
place as many of the bonds with the
people as possible.
The following letter was sent oy
Governor Thomas E. Campbell to eacn
one of the 74 state and national banks
in Arizona:

GOOD WILL BE NEEDED.
(Kansas City Times.)
At a time when unity of the allies is essential. Mr.
Lloyd George reports evidence of German propaganda
to create in England dissatisfaction with France, and in
France and other countries dissatisfaction with England.
In a speech in the house of commons, he said :
Since I have been in this war 1 have striven to
got, not merely co-operation between tho allies, but
friendship, good will and comradeship. I have donn
my best to make these people our friends That is
the secret of our success. It is essential th.-'t you
should have this perfect good will.
The essence of good sense Is in this statement, and
It applies as much to tho United States as ii does to our
allies in Europe. The war will not be won by distrust
ful partners.
In this country the most fertile soil for German pr
paganda of distrust Is probably the inherited feeling
against England handed down from the days of the revo
lution end occasionally revived by politicians for political
purposes. We need to be watchful lest we permit oM
prejudices to hamper our efforts in the war
upon the part of our bankers for the
widest possible distribution or :-i:er;y
loan four per cent tonds is necessary.
Our government requires every dol
lar of new money available I'or the I
purchase of its bonds 'during the war
and the real purpose of the Liberty
loan compaign is a distribu:ion of
these government bonds among in
vestors who will hold them during
the duration of the war.
Officers and employes jf all banks
are urged to constant effort in the dis
tribution of any bonds they Have on
hand, among residents- of their dis
tricts who have not already invested.
It is pointed out that the approach
ing holiday season may well furnish
an incentive to the purchase of these
tonds. Every effort must be made
by letter, advertisement and personal
ly, to prevail on our people to buy
'liese bonds as Christmas gifts to rela
tives and friends, instead of the use
less offerings so commonly made at
that time. i w
I have assured the governor of the
federal reserve bank of the twelfth
district that the bankers of Arizona
will respond manfully to this appeal.
With best wishes I am, sincerely,
THOMAS E. CAMPBELL.
Governor.
A further reason put forward by the
federal reserve bank officials why
gold coins should not be used this year
as Christmas gifts is because the gov
erment needs all the gold it can pos
sibly hoard.
Many people the rich being guilty
in this respect after failing to find
gifts that suit them'to send to their
friends at Christmas said the official,
drop into a bank the day before Christ
mas and get a "handful of gold" to
scatter around Christmas day.
The only reason why they shouldn't
do this this year is that I'm le Sam
needs the gold to help 'win the war.
To keep up the great system of war
financing, which keeps the allies fight
ing, as well as ourselves, the gwvern
inen must board the supply of gold.

- Francis Framlngton, M. D., states in
Health Culture: "I have frequently
drawn attention to the horrors that en
sue from the use of salversan (606) in
the treatment of blood prison." Ex
perts like Major H. C. French of the
Royal Army Medical Corps, Dr. C. F.
Marshall, and Dr. J. Earnst Lane, Eng
land, and Dr. Gaucher, France, insist
that the use of salversan involves riBk
of life. Dr. Gaucher, reported that
three days after injection patient had
slight headache; movements and fev
er, 105 degrees F. death ensued. (From
London Lancet.) If you value your
life do n'Jt submit to injections of ar
senic for blood poison when you can
get a safe remedy like Number 40 For
The Blood, the ingredients of which
are set down in the V. S. Dispensatory
and other medical books as follows:
"Employed in diseases tf the glandu
lar system, in blood poison, mercurial
and lead poisoning, in chronic rheuma
tism, catarrh, constipation, stomach
and liver troubles. Under its use nodes,
tumors, scrofulous swellings, sores, ul
cers, copper colored spots and diseases
of the blood that have withstood all
other treatment disappear as if by
magic." Made by J. C. Mendenhall,
