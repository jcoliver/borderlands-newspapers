Triumphal Finish of U. S.
- Plane's Trans-Ocean Flight
PLYMOUTH, May 31. (By the As
sociated Press.) Seaplane NC-4,
pride .of the American navy, crossed
Plymouth sound this afternoon, circled
the place where the Pilgrim Fathers
sailed in their cockle-shell ship for the
new world in 1620, and alighted in
the Cattewater, her epoch-making
trans-Atlantic flight ended.
As she came into view through the
western haze, England gave her the
splendid welcome she deserved.
Leaving Ferrol, Spain, at 6:27 this
morning, the NC-4 covered the dis
tance of approximately . 500 miles to
Plymouth In less than seven' hours.
Last Leg Without Hitch
' Despite adverse wind and weather
conditions the NC-4 covered the last
leg without a hitch to mar the exploit.
Safe . and ' sound, but thoroughly
fatigued by the physical ordeal of the
trip ,as well as the mental strain,
Commander. Albert C. Read and his

, The rousing welcome of Plymouth
residents to the American airmen and
the cordial reception given to them
aboard the Rochester by Rear Admiral
Plunkett, the mayor of Plymouth, Brit
ish and American officials and the
crews of the other NC planes, reached
a climax with the first actual land
ing of the victorious crew at the spot
from which the Pilgrim Fathers set
forth for America.
There was wonderful interest in to
I day's flight, although it was eclipsed
j by the previous flights of this sea
, plane, for in the opinion' of the Ameri
I can naval officers and the British pub
lic generally, the NC-4 reached the
peak of her great adventure when she
;' spanned the Atlantic at-Lisbon.
British Praise' Unstinted
The pride felt by Americans in the
extrordinary feat of the NC-4 finds
echo tonight in genuine admiration,
expressed by British naval men and
i airmen for the crew's skill and pluck
and the well worked out plans of the
American navy to facilitate and safe
guard the flight
Early in the morning, when word
was flashed that the NC-4 had start
ed on the final leg of her journey, a
heavy rain was falling, but shortly
afternoon the skies cleared and ideal
conditions prevailed.
The NC-4 flew in rain and fog
through the Bay of Biscay, and fog
also was encountered off Brest, com
pellling the plane to keep ata low
altitude. . : ,
Although news of the progress of the
traft was passed along by warships
stationed on the way, it was not until

PLYMOUTH, May 31 (By the Associated Press) "Our trip really
was uneventful," Lieutenant Commander Read said to the correspondent.
"We knew we would have trouble with fog and did, but otherwise every
thing went off as we had planned.
"Our machine worked perfectly ever since we left Newfoundland,
with the exception of our tittle radiator leak yesterday."
Lieutenant James L. Breese, Jr, of California, th reserve pilot-engineer,
said:
"We had all the comforts of home on the old boat. We had oomfor.
table bunks in which we took relays for sleeping. Hot water from the
radiator faucet near the bunks helped to make shaving easy.
- "We knew when we were near a destroyer as Rodd (Ensign Charles
Rodd, Cleveland, Ohio, radio operator), would tell us the radio was get
ting stronger. Then in a few minutes we would feel a distinct bump, and
knew we were over one. It seems that the heat or smoke' from a vessel
has an effect on the air seVen or eight hundred feet up and this caused
the bump. - W!
"I never was o'nee nervous during the trip, but admit I have been on
shorter flights. The machine did everything we asked of it. I think
you can fly anywhere with a Liberty motor."
"We hardly realized that we were doing anything extraordinary at any
time after leaving Newfoundland," said Ensign Charles Rodd. "We were
In constant wireless communication. Both our regular and emergency
sets worked well, except when the fog drove us very low and the hanging
antennae got into the water."
The more or less Indifferent attitude; of the whole crew caused com
ment among the naval and military men here as well as civilians.
Secretary Daniels said tonight no decision had been reactied as to the
means by which the NC-4 would be brought home, and that no instruc
tions had been, sent Admiral Plunkett in regard to other flights.

the meteoric, the dazzling rise to fame
that this portrayer of western roles
has enjoyed. , ,
Less than a. year ago William Fox
saw Tom Mix in a comparatively
minor role in one of his pictures. The
absolutely new, fresh and unhackney
ed style of Mix's acting fairly lifted
Mr. Fox out of his chair, and as soon
as telegraph wires could carry the
mesace west, Tom Mix was a star.
That wuH.ouly a few months ago.
auJ Tom Mix's name soon appeared
on the list of tlars uiakiig Fox pic
tures. Mix was put on a play called
"Cupid's Round-Up" It went, over

letters began to pour' into the Fox
Film corporation offices asking for
more bookings. All of these letters
carried the same refrain:
"This fellow's a wonder! Give us
more of him! He's great!"
Then followed "Western Blood" and
"Ace High." Tom Mix was made as
a dramatic star.
Tom Mix plays western pictures in
a way that western pictures have nev
er been played before. A cowbody
a soldier, a Texas Ranger, he has nev
er known what fear is, and when he
went into motion pictures he brought
to his work the same daring and sen
sational riding that had been his life
habit. Other men have played western
roles, but none has played them in the
same breath-taking manner as Tom
Mix. If the script calls for a leap on
horseback off a bridge into a stream
30 feet below,1 Mix does it. and i;i such
a manner that the feat appears to he
only a matter of course.
Mix if life and swat breath of life:

PEACE MEET SUMMARY
(By the Associated Press.)
Monday noon is the time fixed by
the peace conference for the presenta
tion to the Austrian delegation of the
terms of the peace treaty. The small
powers, which recently asked for an
extension of time for the purpose of
examining those clauses which par
ticularly interested them, have made
reservations on the financial and re
parations, points. ' ' '
Important discussions were held
Saturday ' on the Adriatic settlement,
the Ju go-Slavs delegates conferring
with 1 the members of the American
delegation, except President Wilson.
The president later went over this
matter,"1 as .well as the'German terms
with his conf erers. It has not yet
been disclosed whether the Austrian
treaty is complete, but it is believed
that several important points are still
subject to adjustment
An interesting report comes from
Berlin by way of London to the effect
that the Pan-German union will intro
duce in the German national assembly
a resolution inviting the former Ger
man emperor to return to Germany.
Austrian terms were laid before a
plenary session of the peace confer
ence Saturday and it Is expected that
the terms wllL be soon presented to
the Austrian delegation. Although the
peace conditions for Austria are vir
tually completed, the conference ap
parently has not yet succeeded In ad
justing the Adriatic problem.
The Gerrnan counter proposals have
not yet been answered. Indications
In French diplomatic and official cir
cles are that the pleas put forth in the
counter proposals were contained In
previous German notes and that they
were answered by the allied and as
sociated powers. It is not believed
the Germans will be able to gain any
important concessions. ...
- Premier Clemenceau sent replies to
two of their notes to the German dele
gates Saturday. The texts of the notes
and the replies have not yet been
made public.

NC-4 ARRIVES AT END
OF ATLANTIC FLIGHT
(Continued from page one)
land in expressing great admiration
for your achievement and in welcom
ing to these shores our American cous
ins.' The NC-4 appeared suddenly out of
the haze at 2:19, summer time. After
circling over the harbor, she dropped
gracefully toward the Cattewater,
alighting near the buoy prepared for
her at 2:22. The great crowd on the
harbor front cheered heartily and
craft tied down their whistles in noisy
applause.
The seaplane, when sighted, was
flying high and leading an escort o
three flying ' boats. Her enormous
size left no doubt of - her Identity.
While the thousands of spectators yell
ed themselves hoarse, the flying boats
dropped very lights, and a fleet of
small boats rushed out to greet the
Americans.
The captain's gig from the mine
layer Aroostook proceeded to the NC-4
as the latter taxied up to her buoy,
where she quickly made fast. It was a
perfect landing. As the members of
the crew were being taken off by the
boat from the Aroostook to the Roch
ester, the other flying i.i.-.afs swept
into the Cattewater and drew up
alongside the NC-4.
The inner harbor was calm when
the NC-4 came in and presented a fine
setting for the brilliant picture as
viewed from the densely crowded
slopes of Plymouth's celebrated play
grounds. The Hoe. The haze lying
over the sound obscured visibility, and
it was not until the NC-4 was over
the harbor that her presence became
known.
Commander Read said that shortly
before reaching Brest his seaplane ran
into a thick fog. The NC-4 circled
over the shipping in Brest harbor and
then passed directly over the Ushant
lightship. 'The journey across the
channel was made at a very low alti
tude. The seaplane never flew at a
greater height than 200 feet, and only
at 50 to 100 most of the way, because
of the fog.
Bad weather conditions prevailed
during the flight across the Bay of
Biscay. Nevertheless the NC'4 kept
to her course perfectly and the trip
from Ferral was made at an average
speed of about 70 miles an hour.
Before alighting in the sound the
NC-4 circled the Hoe and passed over
the spot from which the Mayflower
sailed.
After a brief reception aboard the
Rochester, Commander Read and his
crew were taken to the Aroostook,
where they doffed their flying clothes
before proceeding to Mayor J. P.
Brown's reception at the Mayflower
stone. The parade leading to the
pier was lined with British bluejackets
from men of war and shore stations.
On the faily decorated pier a blue
jacket guard of honor was drawn up
under a canopy of allied flags. The
royal garrison artillery band played
America and British anthems.
Mayor Brown arrived in state, ac
companied by three mace bearers.
British and American officers stood
with the mayor to receive the NC-4's
crew. As their boat drew alongside
the pier the band. played "The Star
Spangled Banner:' and "God Pave the
King," and the orew then advanced
to meet the mayor.
In his address Mayor Brown said:
"Plymouth is always a point or his
toric interest to Americans. The
memorable sailing of the Pilgrim Futh
ers from this port was an event which
has proved to be a point in history of
immeasurable interest. Mainly out of
that email beginning a mighty people
has sprung up, and today in inost dra
matic fashion their descendants have
crossed back to us in a way never
dreamed of by our forefathers, and
equalling, in scientific .developments
and .daring the greatest imagining of
Jules Verne." . .

Put your money to work for you where it will be as safe as in a SAVING BANK with a hundred per cent greater
earning power. Refining is the sound, substantial manufacturing end of the oil business where never a dollar is
lost. And it offers the most PROFITABLE investment you can find anywhere, in or out of the oil industry.
All Gambling Eliminated
There's no guess work to oil refining. We know from actual test and
experience what we can make from the Texas crude oil; the sameas
the miller can weigh your wheat, or corn, and tell you how much
flour, meal and bran you will get, and give you the value of it. There
is no gamble or speculation in the matter. Oil and oil products are
as staple as wheat and corn, the price is as well established-4-the mar
ket is world-wide the consumption is greatly in excess of the sup
plythe. law of supply and demand assures ever increasing profits
from the manufacture of refined petroleum products.
The only essential to remarkable success is an ample supply of crude oil and proper
management. The Panther City Oil & Refining Co. possesses those elements to a
degree that bespeaks a brilliant future. Ncte on' the map that two of tn pipe line
that led into Fort Worth from the Great Ranger and Burkburnett fields cross our 51
acre refinery site, on which our plant, of 10C3 barrels initial capacity, wilt be erected.
Read the letter reproduced herewitli it speaks for itself. We are going to BUY from
t the producer our supply of cruC-e oil and REFINE it, taking the B!G and SURE profits.
iThe production company, after taking all the risks of getting oil, sells his output for
$2.25 per. barrel... The refinery converts this same oil into refined Petroleum products
at a net profit of $5 per barrel. ! There is more money , in refirring ;a' barrel of-oit than
, In producing it and there is never a dollar lost in the refining en.a,.
Our Vice-President, A. P. Nicholson, will be in active management of our refining
plant. He built and operated the Union Refining Co. plant at Shrevtfcort, La., which,
after four months of operation, sold out, paying each stockholder 2 1-2 for 1. He ia
a practical and successful refinery manager who knows every phase of the oil business.

Demanding Immediate Attention
Some day, it is announced at Washington, the -government is going
to provide money for a national leprosium. Then, John It. Early will
have home and medical attention until the dread leprosy has killed him.
But in the meantime. Early must be shunted from state, to state,
.from a Leper's Home to an isolated shack, because no state feels it should
bear the burden of caring for this leper.
Some time ago Early was confined in a shack o the outskirts of
Washington. Tha,t city treated sick dogs better than it did this human
being afflicted with the disease which rots the flesh away. Naturally,
the poor, doomed man didn't like it. He ran away. But there was no
place for him to go. No man's home was open to him. Villages and
cities drove him out when he appeared. Finally he came to New Orleans.
There is a Leper Home, supported by Louisiana, for the few lepers of that
state. Here Early was taken in, fed clothed and given what treatment
physicians can give. .
And now the Louisiana authorities have asked the District of Colum
bia to pay for Early's care and maintenance. The district refuses, claim
ing that Early was a resident of North Carolina when he enlisted in the
Spanish-American war.
North Carolina refuses to pay because Early has not lived in that
state for many years.
The United States government doesn't pay because congress refuses
to provide a national leprosium. 1 1 is a matter for the United States
government, not any city, or any one state. Early was a soldier
of the United States. He fought for the whole country, not only for
North Carolina, the District of Columbia, or Louisiana. While fighting for
the U. S. in the Philippines he contracted leprosy, for which there is ho
cure
Obviously it is the nation's duty to provide for Robert Early down
' to the last minute of his life, and to take good care of his dependents.
This must be done at once. Congress should pay the Louisiana Leper
Home for Early's maintenance until a national leprosium is built.
Early wo old never have been a leper had he not been "brave enough
to enlist to fight our battles. For y ears he has waited for us to do
our duty. Let us do it NOW!
Some Men Never Forgive God For Forgiving Sinners
King David once wrote a letter to his commanding general ordering
him to place Uriah whose wife he coveted "in the forefront of the
hottest battle." '
And Uriah was killed, and David .got his wife. She became the
mother of -Solomon, the wise king.
But David suffered the torments of hell because of his contemptible
conduct, and in great anguish he pleaded for forgiveness.
He paid a terrible price, but he was forgiven.
There have been men who ? never forgave David, and they even
declined to forgive God for forgiving David.
This is just another evidence of the infinite mercy of God. It's a
lucky thing for most of us that we aren't to be Judged by our fellow
sinners.' They'd never let up until we had "paid the last farthing."
If we confess our sin, God is faithful and just to forgive us our sin,
and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
There's a lot of comfort here for the man whose soul is being torn
by remorse.
One of the greatest psalms in the Bible is the fifty-first. It was
written by .David after he realized the sinfulness of destroying Uriah.
Read it it's a wonderful confession and ,a passionate plea for forgiveness.
Here's just the begininng of it: ,
"Have mercy on me, O God, according to Thy loving kindness: ac
cording unto the multitude of Thy tender mercies blot out my transgressions."
Kiss 'Em or Spank 'Em?
We voice a contrary opinion to this:
"The mother who cuddles and kisses her child when ho cries should
be punished by law."
So asserts Dr. John B. Watson, professor of psychology at Johns
Hopkins University, Laltimore, Md. He goes on:
"Yes, mother love is the most beautiful thing is the world, but it
is at the same time most harmful." '
Maybe the learned professor knows what he is talking about, but
we think he doesn't.
The professor had in mind "spoiled babies." . And you can spoil a
baby by letting it have its own way regardless 'of what it should or
should not do. But fathers, aunts, and grandfathers are even more to
blame for "spoiled babies."
In all our varied experience with criminals, big and small, we have
yet to run across one whose family history showed that he had been
a "spoiled baby." On the other hand
Woodrow Wilson has said:
"There was nothing which could more quickly cure my battered
. thumb or bumped forehead than to run to mother and cuddle up in her
arms, two kisses, and the pain was -forgetten."
And now what the Huns think of Mr. Wilson finds enthusiastic echo
from the ranks of the Prohibitionists.
The council is trying to find some solution of the Turkish problem
that will leave the Mohammedan free to exercise his faith but not free
to exercise bis works.
Heinle's complaint that the peace terms will mean moral degrada
tion for Germany reminds us of the murderer who didn't want to be
hanged because it would disgrace his family.
The reason we can't understand statesmanship is because a senator
will favor giving a half-developed race the right to govern itself, and vote
to deny the same right to American women.
Statesmen are moving carefully in order not to offend the sultan's
religious principles. Why not be consistent and leave him a few Ar
menians for the practice of his principles?
According to the clothing advertisements, a pinch-back coat is all
that is necessary to enable a young fellow to dictate to cowering di
rectors of the company.
The young fellow who believes thm putting up a front is the chief
essenital to success Is prune to be an affront to the boss.

Is Prince of Wales Grooming For
First President of Great Britain?
LONDON, May 31. Is the Prince
of Wales being groOmed. for first
president of Britain?
Or is there a campaign on to make
him so popular that he 'will sit firmly
on the throne for which he is some
day intended.
Whatever the purpose the Prince
of Wales is Just now the most press
agented person in all Europe.
It began right after the armistice
when some of the British papers mod
estly declared it was a shame royal
modesty and British reserve kept from
the world the knowledge of the
prince's bravery on the field of battle.
And then they went on to relate the
instances when the prince went over
the top. And they told of his cool
ness under fire.
Having established his reputation
for bravery, the papers fed the public
stories of his democracy, of his ming
ling with the men in camps and bar
racks. They told of the joking he
stood for and of his hearty hanfl
shake. Then the prince went home and
joined the Masons, which every good
politician does.
Stories of whom the prince might
marry and pictures of pretty girls all
over Europe who would be eligible as
next queen of England kept alive in
terest and the boyish face of the
prince looked well among them.
The prince went down into the
slums and tenements of London and
the incidents of his shaking the sudsy
hands of costers' wives and holding
the babies made copy that would de
light the heart of a ward heeler.
Now here comes the prince smok
ing the cigars of the most democratic
man In England, dressed like the most
democratic man in England and hav
ing his picture taken with the most
democratic man in England Lloyd
George just after a luncheon giyen
by the most democratic man in Eng
land at which the prince was the
guest of honor.

IN PROPOSED WALKOUT
LONDON, May 31. The repetition
today in Liverpool, Lancaster, Bir

vincial cities where a police strike is
threatened, of the order issued Friday
by General Macready, commissioner
of the metropolitan police force, had
a sobering effect on the older men on
the forces in those cities and in Lon
don. The ' commissioner's order was
that any officer or man failing to re
port for duty would be dismissed and
would not be permitted to rejoin the
force under any circumstances.
The older men are not inclined to
jopardize their pay and pensions for
the police demands recognition ol
the union' and reinstatement of dis
missed constables.
' The younger men, however, are all
for a strike and as they formed a ma
majority of the union members in
London, it is expected that the vote
will be overwhelmingly in favor of a
strike.
Police officials said today that ar
rangements had been completed to
protect the public should the police
men go out.

Luke. Jr., the head hero "ace" of

LUKE'S LAST FIGHT
By Sergeant Seth T. Bailey of the
Star and Stripes
As I remember it,-it was late in the
afternoon of September 29, 1918, when
1 saw an American avion streaking
atio.st'ia sky over the Argonne head
ed l a German -balloon. The puffs
of smoke in the air about him caused
b ythe bursting of shrapnel shells,
attracted my attention. Would be get
the balloon The shells were bursting
close to the plane. - I -stopped in my
tracks, arrested by the desire to see
him through. The plane hovered over
the balloon for only a second and then
dived straight for the inflated bag.
Huppity-pup-pup-pup-pup! It relieved
me to know that his machine gun was
working. I was also, relieved and thril
ed, when the balloon gradually . col
lapsed and burst into, flames The
plane, side-slipped, dipped and then
rose again, headed straight for another
balloon a kilometer or so away.
Again I enjoyed the same sensation
lof hearing the machine gun "talk" to
the balloon. The plane side-slipped
again, turned the nose for a dive and
then shot straight up, side-slipped
(again and came back at the. balloon.
Again the machine gun w6nt into ac
tion, and simultaneously the second
balloon burst Into flames and fell be
hind the German lines '" ;: .
My eyes followed the'.balloon down,
and when I locked again J" had lost the
plane. Where had he gone? Had he
continued his mad dash straight into
the avion:infested country of the ene
my and alone!
Late that night at divisional head
quarteds I was told that a Spad had
dropped a message reading: "Look for
burning balloons." It- was signed
"Luke." According to the report at
divisional headquarters,' at. 5:05
o'clock that same evening two boche
balloons were seen to fall in flames.
Seven minutes later, so the observers
reported, a third was seen to fall.
Luke was not seen again.
The final chapter can now be writ
ten in the story of Lieujf.' Frank Luke,
Jr., the young Arizona freiywhoi after
a meteoric 'appearance antbng -ttie
foremost American aviators, "vanished
from sight over the German lines in
the first ilays of the Argonne drive.
His grave has been found in the cem
etery of the little village of Murvaux
east of Dun-sur-Meus.e.
Lieutenant , Luke scored his first
victory on September 22 the first
day of the -St. Mihiel drive. He was
killed seventeen days later. On that
day, he brought down his eighteenth
boqhe. The observers said that he
seemed to be possessed by a notion
that he must tie Fonck's record in a
single season,. There was no holding
him in check. He picked nights
against heavy odds, flew alone when
he was under, orders not to, flew at
times and under weather conditions
when he was supposed to be safe in
camp, and toward the end, went scout
ing. to strange fields for his replenish
ments of gas and 'ammunition, fearful,
if he showed up at his own airdrome,
that he would be held there. In fact,
on that last day, there vere orders out
to sentence him a a month of ground
work as soon as he' Teturnoxl. - -
On October 18, a telegram. from the
Jnternationtfl Rod Cross TepoTted him
"killed m actlon.v and late in- Decem
ber! an America soldier, returning-to
France 'from a prison camp' in Germany,-reported
that' lit the village of
Murvaux and the countryside about
there hadalready growa up a legend
of a ' yoUng ; American flyer who, just
before sundown on the fourth day of
the great "battle, wrought great de
struction among the German balloons,
and who then, mortally wounded, came
to earih'nd.gun in hand., stood off
the"; enemy until ha, , fell dead in the
field. He was buried, they said, -in
the village church yard. From that legend,-,
as enlarge and corrected by
the-affidavits of 15 French men and
women, the Luke identification has
been made. They saw his plane streak

Re-
across the sky, headed straight for a
captive balloon and chased by a Ger
man escadrille that had picked him
up when he crossed the lines.
Dipping, wheeling, dodging, like a
bird before a hawk, he eluded his pur
suers. He destroyed that balloon, and
though the . chase frew (hotter: and
though the fire from scores of ma
chine guns and anti-aircraft guns was
by that time throwing up an almost
solid barrier of bullets and bursting
shrapnel, he destroyed another. In
this last dashj he was wounded.
Darkness was coming on and he was
ten kilometers inside the enemy lines.
It is supposed he knew the end had
come and that his idea was to do as
much damage to the enemy as he
could in the, last few moments of life.
Flying low' over Murvaux he poured
all the ammunition, his machine gun
had into the enemy: troops assembled
there. The .French, say he killed six
Germans "and-.wounded many more.
Then ha landed in a field. The vil
ligers saw - the - Germans running to
ward him, saw him draw his automatic
to defend Jbimself and then topple
over on the ground..
.Luke was a second lieutenant. He
was born May 19, 1897, the son of
Frank Luke, of 2200 West Monroe
street. Phoenix, Ariz. His most sen
sational exploit was on September 18,
1918, when he destroyed two enemy
balloons in the vicinity of Marsar
Tours and the same day, single-handed,
destroyed three enemy planes in
a combat that lasted only ten minutes.

ENTERTAINER TO TELL
OF EXPERIENCES ON
WAR FRONT WITH T
While there has been much writ
ten and said about the war, it has re
mained for ft. C. Maclver, of Pres
cott, Arizona, a prominent mine op
erator in that field, to come forward
with a highly interesting recital of
a nine months tour of the A. E. F. as
a Y.M. C. A. entertainer, giving his
experiences and impressions.
Formerly a noted magician and

organized the "3:M unit," which was
the first American unit to tour the
Combat Divisions along the firing
line, and the first unit of entertain
ers to go into Germany after the ar
mistice was signed, with the Ameri
can forces.
Mr. Maclver tells in a very inter
esting way, the story of this tour,
which covered the entire American
front, on which tour they gave 312
entertainments, ninety-eight of which
were given under continuous shell
fire, performance given under all
sorts of conditions. He tells of
many interesting happenings, inject
ing into it all a good deal of humor
and original wit, as well as present
ing many of his remarkable magical

overseas occupied a very important
place in the army organization and

Bisbee, Arizona, May 29, 1919.
Mr. J. A. Finney, Sr., f' '

Bisbee, Arizona.
Dear Sir:
" At a meeting of the Board of Direstors of the Warren .
District Commercial Club, held Wednesday, May 28, 1919,
in. the Commercial Club rooms, your two letters with ref- ,
. ' . erence to the extending of the street car line to the ..west- s

and the motion was made' whereby the Commercial Club
. -..as an organization heartily endorsed the idea and will go -
"on" record as s6 doing-. . " ' " . -
I ain having published in tomorrow morning's Review,
the fact that the Warren District Commercial Club direc
tors endorsed this proposition at their meeting yesterday. '
I want to personally thank you for bringing this mat- i i
ter before the Warren District Commercial Club, and ap
preciate the fact that you realized that this is what this
organization is for.
I did not take thi3 matter up earlier Ju;. view of the
fact that I was aware this proposition was to be put off
until the meeting of the Council on June 3rd, thereby ap
preciating the fact that by bringing this matter up at our
meeting yesterday would give. the. Directors ample tifie
to do whatever they saw fit in the -matter.
Again thanking you for using this organization for
one of the purposes for which it is maintained, and hop

ELKS STAGE PARADE
FOR SALVATION DRIVE;
"CAGE" IS FEATURE
With the C. & A. band in the lead,
closely followed by veterans of the
great world war and with more than
200 Elks bringing up the rear, last
night's parade in behalf of the Sal
vation Army Drive for $2300 was
staged successfully. The parade
swung down Main street to Brewery
Gulch and up the gulch to the city
park where it turned around and
marched back over the same route to
the Elks home on Main street and dis
banded. The parade was an inspiring one,
that told of the fefdlngs of the Amer
ican doughboy for the organization
that had served him In the fr"ont line
trenches while he waded hip deep rh
rtud after the boche. The Salvation
Army had turned out for him, had
gone a head and done their work and
done it efficiently. Last night the
American doughboy didn't forget and
he turned out as if on dress parade.
He turned out in behalf of the Sal
vation Army, his tried, and proven
friend, who are now asking the War
ren district for $2500. ,
As the parade wended its' way
along the streets the applause was
genuine and the doughboys smiled
back in acknowledgement. Follow
ing In the, wake of the procession an
improvised "Black Maria" barked and
spitted just like a regular uncouth
city patrol wagon. Ridiftg on the
front seat with the chauffeur a cele
brated detective from Sonora dirett
ed the operations, of a score or more
detectives, that mingled with the
crowds. As the famous detective
would wink his eye or curl his mus
tache, which was. a code signal, the
correspondence .detectives would
swoop down upon some unsuspecting
Elk standing on the sidewalk, as it
with an idea that the parade was
being given in - his honor by his
brother Elks.
After beating the Elk into submis
sion with a crowbar the detectives
would place him in the mobile prison
while the crowds would cheer. As
the parade reached the demobilization
point the following prisoners were
tolled off: Doctor Hawjey, charged
with practicing poker" without a li
cense; Leonard McWhorter, charged
with 14 points, George Medigovich,
charged with electricity. Charles
Sam Kyle, charged with $3.00. F. S.
Cundiff, charged with l?;htning, and
Bassett Watkins, charged with 5 gal
lons of gasoline, j;
As soon as the prisoners reached
the entrance of the Supreme Court
Building, Judge Hqgan came out in
his court robe resplendent, and hand
ed down fines in every instance. Sam
Kyle, Citz Attorney, was fined $3 for
having more than $5 on his person.
The rest of the fines ranged from. SI
to $2. , Sam Kyle was only fined $2
to begin with but he made a statement
to the court that he thought the scales
of Justice were improperly balanced
and the court stuck on a nother dol
lar to make the scales balance.
After the parade. the Elks gave a
smoker and the prisoners were al
allowed to look on. Everybody had a
good time.
According to reports from the com
mittees last night the local campaign
is dragging sorrowfully behind with
more than one-half of the quota yet
to be raised. Reports from other
cities were likewise despondent and
thus far, Jerome, : the seat of receit

has been much idleness, is the first
and only city in the state to go over

As a result of the failure of Ari
zona to reach its quota during the
. r 1 f . . . 1 . a ,

I By that time, local Elks say that the

COACH RUTS OF THE EARLY DAYS
Residents Owe a Debt of Gratitude to the Cochise County
Highway Commission and Its Engineering Force Who
Have Made This Arizona's Premier Good Roads
County; Highways to Stand For Generations
BY H. D.
The first highway from Douglas j
across the deoert to Blsbee. from!
.k .. I
through Government draw to Tomb
stone, and from Tombstone out over
Curtiss flats to Penson, was thrown
down on the ground. It was good
enough for those days it served its
purpose. It was two ruts where the
wheels tracked, and two trails where
horses drawing rumbling stage coach
es or clumsy ore wagons and trailers
had beaten bare the earth and kicked
aside -the rocks. '
This road was sufficient for those
days. Over it passed the pioneer
miners with pack trains. Traveling
men, gamblers, business men, tour
ists were drawn over its ruts and
bumps in old-fashioned stages. The
rich copper or silver ores found irf
the districts which the road tapped,
piled high in gTeat wagons, were"
Srawn the road's length to concen-'6
tratora or railroads.
Relics of the road still remain.

biggest and fastest stage coach ply
ing between Tombstone and the Mule
canyon.
Come back on the highway at the
west side of the summit between Bis
bee and Tombstone. Here are more
relics of the old days when the old
roads were good enough to serve the
purpose.
Winding down the bottom of the
canyon, here and there reaching up
to. the Bides of the stream, are rem
nants of the old road. Rough they
are filled with ricks and ruts. They
are mute testimony of what palmy
days offered the tourist in travel
comfort.
They Wer" Roads Once
Or, go' back farther from Tomb
stone to the early roads across the
plains between Bisbee and Douglas.
Roads! They were roads once. Trav
el made two ruts where wheels
tracked. Then came rains. The ruts
widened and deepened. Soon they
became unpassable. Then the road
moved a few feet to the south or
north, the east or west.
Many a desert gully or arroya once
was a desert road. Rain, travel and
time have wrought the change.
And, as rain, travel and time have
worked, man has worked until today
man, speeding across J mountain 'or
desert, demands 'something beside
the wagon-track trail on . which to
drive his motor car.
The first railroad thrown up and
leading into the Warren district vi-'
cinity, came south from Benson to .
Fairbanks, and then took to the foot
hills for the remainder of the dis
tance. Down below the Warren dis-,
trict country club still can be seen j
the old grade. Near the Hereford
road below Don Luis, is a black slag
and cinder dump, marking the old
Naco Junction of the pioneer rail
road. Striking southeast from the
Junction is the old grade to Naco. j
This road has long since been ;
abandoned. '
It was done away with for one
reason it had outlived its usefulness
it had become too expensive to
maintain because floods and . rains
from the hills persisted in washing it
out.
It was torn up. New grades were
built further south and nearer the
river. New ties were laid and new
rails were strung.

building, demanded that something
better than the Pioneer road which
served the early settlers and pros-
pectors and merchants and gamblers
and saloon men, be constructed. To
day the old grade stands in mute ev
idence of what we have learned in
railroad construction during the past
few years just as the old wagon
tracks on the desert and gulch testi
fy to an age long past in highway
construction.
' Just 100 years ago the Steamboat
Savannah, an American built vessel
of 320 tons, made the first steam
driven trip across the Atlantic. . It
labored under awkward side-wheel
propellers at the rate of six knots an
hour. It took five times the number
of days to cross, now required'. But
it crossed in much less time than
modern sailships of its day.
And, within the past week an air
plane ha3 crossed the same path from
United St"es ? E lt CU
down remarkably the time required
by the fastest steamship.
The Savannah left docks on May
22, 1819. The, NC-4 commemorated
this date by its flight.
When "the first railroad wound out
of Benson toward the Warren dis-
trfct' th engineers built according
Birucuou euKmccia.
But in spite of these facts, the hea
vy rains of the summer period," the
could bursts of Arizona, washed out
the culverts, demolished the bridges
and ate. away the roadbed.
Drainage Paramount Problem .

summitt and down to the gulch. Here
it followed' for the main part down

travel from Bisbee to Tombstone, he
climbed into an old-fashioned stage-Old-time
stage drivers tell still a
story of the green eastern peddler or
salesman who traveled one of these
stage trips over the divide. When
the coach reached the top of a steep,
rocky hill, the road down was found
washed and rutted and filled with
rocks.
"Get out and walk down," the dri
ver advised the passengers.
But the salesman had paid to ride.
He'd be damned if if he'd get out and
walk down. He'd ride, he would.
Passenger Gets Money's Worth
He did. The doors of the old coach
were closed. The weight which un
der ordinary circumstances would
have held the stage partially to the
ground, had been removed. Ruts and
rocks and chuck holes and gulleys
made no difference to the driver. He
had the brakes set tight and the
eight horses were running to keep
ahead of the heavy coach.
Inside was the salesman. Bumps
and Jolts and Jerks sent him from
one wall to another, and from the
front to the, back of the coach. He
emerged at the bottom of the hill
bruised and bleedjng.
"Why didn't you stop when I yell
ed to you?" ha hotly demanded of
the pilot. "Damn you, you've half
killed me."
"Greenhorn, you're larnin'," chuck
led the driver. "Next time you'll
take a kind old feller's advice."
Then it took a full six hours for
the trip to Tombstone. The horses
were changed twice. The passen-1
gers were worn out from their hard
drive.
Today the traveler makes the trip
"1
to Tombstone by motor car In 46 to
50 minutes. Today he Tides at a
rate of 30 to 40 miles an hour in
entire comfort and safety. Traveling
men secure passage in an automobile
in preference to the trip on the train,
because the ride is a real pleasure.
It was six years ago that the state
and county together decided to at
tempt building a highway which
would withstand the rigors "of. the
country and which would remain in
repair with a minimum of maintain
ance expenditure. An engineer ran
lines from Bisbee up Tombstone can
yon toward the summit, down into
the gulch, along the side of the gulch,
out over the plains and into Tomb
stone. And at that time more than
the first half of the road was built.

As you speed along Jie highway
built above the bottom of the gulch,
you pass on the left the remains of
an old adobe building. Years ago,
when men traversed the same road,
but in stage coaches or on horse
back. Apache Indians swooped
down on this little hut, murdered the
inhabitants and hung their bodies on
the meat hooks outdoors. The stage
coach driver discovered the massacre,
and reported it to the half-hundred
residents of the then infant Bisbee.
Six years have cars traveled over
this road. And, in all this time U

Apache Point Commands Canyons
Ahead of you looms Apache point.
It is a round mountain, red of color,
and placed almost in the middle of
the canyon. From its top nearly ev

you are traveling, can be seen clear
back to the summit. , On the other
side the view is unobstructed for
miles. Here the Apaches had their
lookout. From here the watched for
stages to rob, settlers to kill. From
here they swooped down on the little

of valley and mountain scenery such
as can be seen in lew other spots
In the southwest. On a low sky-line,
far across the deep valley of the San
Pedro, can be seen in their blue
hazy distance six separate and dis
tinct mountain ranges, some in Mex
ico and others in Arizona. The sun
is sinking in the west. !
They tell df the old time's at the
Bisbee Extension when you speak to
the pioneer of the panorama below
you and the sunset behind the six
mountain ranges. Even the old mud
diggers, the hard, seasoned, pioneer
miners and muckers who worked in
the Extension shaft would sit at eve
ning on their mine dump, puffing
aged pipes and looking silently out to
the west. They were worshipping
the shrine which called them out
west and kept them there. They
were dreaming.
But they did not dream of the
highways over which they pass to
day toward Tombstone or Bisbee.
They dreamed of the riches of the
west, of the freedom of the west, or
the great hills and canyons of the
west. If you had told them that in
the year 1919 Tombstone would be
building a new hotel and laying out
a site for a tourists' camping ground,
they would have laughed.
But that's what they will tell you
in Tombstone today. The plans for
the new hotel are practically ready
and construction will begin soon.
Think of that a Tombstone whose
boom days are gone with a new and
modern hotel a Tombstone where
no new business block has been
erected in these many years past.
with one of the best hotels in the
state!
The camping ground site has been
selected at the western outskirts of
the pioneer city, where the highway
leads out over the Borderland route
to Fairbanks and Tcson or Benson
land Tucson. It is a broad expanse
of land with room for many touring
parties. Pipe lines will be run on
to it where drinking water will be
supplied and baths will be erected.
Purest Water In-Country i
"And the Commercial Club will fur
nish the gas for lighting," laughingly
advises the Tombstone business
man. And the water. Many years
ago the Tombstone business man was
reading a government report on goat
raising in Arizona. He was interested
in goats then. ; He read In the goat
report a beer report the purest beer
ever manufactured In the United
States, said the report, was made
from the waters of the HuaChuca
mountains.
This Is the water which will he

Further down the road and almost
in the morning shadow of the granite

sand of the purest and best type

and Douglas. It is being used in the
concrete which is making the finest
stretch of paved highway in the south
west between the mining town and
the town where the ores are smelted.
Highways are built scientifically
today Even the dirt with which the
roads are surfaced, is tested thor
oughly. All along the highways can
be found Shallow pits where surfac
ing material has been rejected, and
deeper pits from which surfacing ma
terial has been taken.
Drainage has been the great prob
lem which has been worked out on
the highway from Tombstone to Ben
son: - Here is a stretch of road which
in the past has been a constant
source of trouble, of repair, of x
pense and high costs. Today these
troubles "are being 'eliminated, an1
dens where each 'year crops of great
value are harvested, and where-many
cattle are fed and fattened. Among
the' trees are hid the homes of many
families. Here and there a modern
school house bespeaks prosperity and
advancement of the community, and
a garage and automobile at nearly
every farm house is testimony to the
productiveness of the land.
But the matter of drainage has been
a great problem to these residents of
all cross drainage, and the water
comes from many miles of mountains
and hills and valleys to pour down
onto the road bed. For this reason
the highway was built up from the
ground. Along the side are drainage
ditches, converging at regular inter
vals into culverts or under bridges.
Good Roads Prosper Benson
Above the highway, sometimes half
a mile, the engineers bave, carried
their work. Have you ever noticed
being paved. When this time comes,
the preliminary steps to paving will
have been completed. Everything
will have been done but the laying of
the foundation for the pavement, and
the surfacing of the pavement.

over the Bisbee-Douglas highway. It
was constructed in the same manner
as the roads from Bisbee to Benson
were built. Every loot of the entire

Past Drainage Lessons
The lessons which the railroad
engineer had learned, have made
possible this feat. Application of
knowledge of rainfall and engineering
skill have surmounted the drainage
difficulties. Every foot of ground
above the road which must be drain-!
ed has been measured by the engi-l
neers. With rainfall records of the!
past six years, the engineers nave j
then ascertained just how much water
will be carried at a maximum in any
one gulch, canyon or arroya. Then
they have constructed bridges of their
own design especially to carry away
the heavy waterfall, and culverts
where the flow is lighter.
Not in one place, but in many,
where the new road carries i 12-foot
bridge, the old road was undermined
with a 12-inch culvert. And in places
where a big bridge was thrown into
the old road, a small culvert has been
found sufficient to carry away the
water. It was simply a matter of
measuring the drainage area a- fac
tor which in the past had been more
or less neglected. - .
from the railroad coach how ditches
are cut for miles from the tracks
out over a .hill directly away from
the road bed? These ditches force
flood waters under certain bridges.
They are salvation to the railroad
when heavy rains fall. Similar ditch-.
e3 assist in controlling the flood wat
ers which pour down onto Curtis
flats, and now a few bridges drain
the entire stretch. The roads are
saved; the farmers are saved from
greater inroads by the heavy rushes
of mountain waters. Scientific high
way construction . from Curtis"'' flats
to Benson has eliminated the flaad
and safety of the traveler, and to culverts and under bridges. In mak-

edge of the hill, shaved off the ob
stacle, and when drivers now make
this turn they will be able to see ve
hicles ahead.
"Safety First"
Safety first here is advanced a
notch. And convenience Is advanced
two notches. The driver may the
more safely judge his speed for the
curve, and the passengers in the car
may feel the more comfortable in
knowing they will not go headlong
into an unseen car.
Elimination or curves aaas still
more-to the safety of travel on this
paved highway. In one place below
Lowell five separate cunres have been
straightened out, and now instead of
a bending, winding highway this spot
is a long arrow-like stretch. Inciden
tally, one of the curves which has
been eliminated has been the scene
in the past of several more or le6S
serious accidents.
On the new paved highway from
Douglas to Cisbee motor car - trips
will be one of the greatest delights
of tourists and of residents of the
districts in close proximity to the
road. Thirty-five to forty-five min
utes will be ample for the most con
servative driver to make the trip.
No dangers from passing other cars
will be felt. All of the dips and
grades of former highways will be
eliminated. The trip will be as de
lightful and as easy as a drive over
a level city pavement or' boulevard'.
As Skillfully Built Aa RailrnaH -
The highway leads out of oDuglas
paralleling the El Paso & Southwest
ern railroad tracks. It is sufficiently
elevated to be dry at all seasons. As
you speed over its level surface you
are surprised to note how nearly 1t
parallels the railroad in construction.
You are impressed with the fact that
the same care and the same engi
neering experience has gone into the
highway as was used In throwing up
the railroad bed. As you programs on
the road this feature is more strik
ingly illustrated.
At Forrest Station the highway,
leaves the railroad and turns to the
north and west. Here the difficulty
of construction was even more mark

ner in which Landru, the : Parisian
Bluebeard, hypnotized her. The
Fauchet &rl is believed to have es

coiled my hair. He went down on his
knees, took my hands, fixed me with
his eyes, and Baid, 'Annette, I am your
roaster; you belong to me. I suddenly
felt queer. I saw a diabolical glint
in his eyes and must have become un
conscious, because I remember noth

again he terrifies me; he must be
the devil."
NUDE MAN,, WEIRD AIRS ,
' ' MAKE IRISH' MYSTERY
DUBLIN, May 31. Ireland hasn't
lost all its fondness for the supernat
ural. Witness this story from Ros
common: Wild chantings and shouts
alarmed the people of the neighbor
hood. Investigating parties were
warned by an invisible person to stop
their search. A nude taale figure was
seen to rush through the woods. It
disappeared In a ravine. A whirring
sound, as of several airplanes passing
overhead was heard. And then the
woods resounded to most beautiful
music and the searchers returned
trembling to their homes. So the
story goes.

FORE TAKING TANLAC
"Tanlac proved to be the very thing
I needed, for it soon put an end to
my troubles," said D. V. McCracken,
829 Second avenue, Dallas, Texas,
night superintendent of the Dallas 'Oil
c Refining company,
"I had been . troubled with Indiges
tion for over two years," he continued,
"and was going down hill fast I was
constantly belching up sour food and
didn't-digest enough to keep up my
strength or do me any good, and I
lived almost entirely on cereals. My
stomach felt like there was a knot in
; it and hurt me all the time, and I was
; swollen up with gas till my heart
would flutter and I would get dizzy. I
could hardly sleep when I went to bed
and got little rest at ail.
"I had the best treatment money
could buy, and kept getting worse all
the time. I was induced by a friend
to try Tanlac and it fixed me up so I
can eat and digest anything I want
and sleep fine at night. I have no
more gas on my stomach, no palpita
tions nor dizziness, and I reel so grate
ful for what Tanlac has done for me
that it is a pleasure to indorse it."

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, JUNE 1, 1919
TROUT SEASON
111
III
PHOENIX. May 31. Trout season
in Arizona opens tomorrow, said J. V,
Procbaska, state game warden today.
"and," he added, 'there is any amount
of trout for the anglers of the south
west." Besides trout, the game warden
' pointed out, the season never closes
for mountain lions and bears, many of
the latter being found at this season
of the year gorging themselves on the
abundant wild berries.
Taking Phoenix as the starting
point, numerous streams and lakes are
within easy reach of the trout fish
erman. For a one-day, or week-end
trip bass and croppy may be found
at Mormon Flats on the Roosevelt
road; Joint Head, between Phoenix
and Tempe; Granite Reef, the intake
of the big Arizona canal, and various
points on the Verde and Gila rivers.
Out the man who is out for the cold
water fish, full of fight, must travel
farther afield. Numerous streams hav
ing plenty of mountain trout may be
reached via Roosevelt and Fort
Apache. ' On the way up there are
good opportunities at Mormon Flats
and Roosevelt lake, but the first trout
prospect will be found at the White
river en route to Fort Apache.
From Ft. Apache, the mountain trout
streams to be reached in drives ap
proximately 200 miles in length from
Pnoenix, include Diamond creek, ac
cessible by automobile and Big and
Little Diamond above the forks ( to ar
rive at which packing must be resort
ed to. Other promising trout waters 1
in this section are the Big and' Little
Bonlta, East and North forks ot the
White river, Clear creek. Paradise
creek. Caribou creek. Trout creek,
and Cherry creek.
From WinBlow there is'; another
Clear creek accessible, which boasts
the only salmon trout said to be tound
in the state. In this district there
also is West Chevalon, well stocked
with brook trout and also reported to
hold a plentiful supply of Verde trout
or bonytail.
Oak creek in Yavapai and Coconino
counties is reached via Prescott and
Camp Verde ,a trip of less than 100
miles and is said to be one of the most
beautiful trout streams in Arizona,
abounding in the speckled beauties.
In the Sierra Anches, via Pine and
Payson, or by Pleasant valley. Rock,
Cherry and Trout creeks can be reach
ed. Between Pine and Payson, via
Roosevelt and up the Tonto river Pine
creek is within easy distance.
For those who prefer to do their
fishing where boating is possible,
Lakeside is said to hold out induce
ments. This artificial body of water,
two miles in length, is situated hi
Navajo county .and is reached Ma
Prescott, Flagstaff and Holbrook, or
by way of Roosevelt, Globe, Rice, Ft.
Apache and thus into the White
mountains to the lake.
By way of Flagstaff Lake Mary may
be reached. Bass and croppy are n-aid
to be plentiful there. Norman Lake,
a natural body of water, is 22 miles
from Flagstaff and contains rainbow
trout, bass and croppy. Stoneman lake
with its rainbow trout, also is reached
from Flagstaff.
In the Graham mountains of Graham
county, via Safford, there are said to
be numerous tempting trout streams.
In the Catalinas, via Tucson and the
Mount Lennon road route, lies the up
per Sabino with its rainbow trout.
Anglers in previous seasons have re
ported landing especially large troph
ies from this stream.

PAGE FIVE
SILVER PROPERTY
OF JUMBO CO. IS
HIGHLY VALUABLE
CASTLE DOME IS
HOW DRILLING III
Five Tons of Rich Silver Ore
Extracted Daily From
Main Tunnel
GLOBE. May 31. The Jumbo Min
ing & Milling company, owning val
uable silver property at Richmond
Basin, has been operating for several
years so quietly that -very little has
been known of them locally.
In 1916 the company purchased four
claims from William Phol, who had
made several shipments of very rich
ore. In 1916 and 1917 the company
made a number of shipments of high
grade ore to the Selby Smelting com
pany, at San Francisco, from which
they received good returns, some of
the ore going over 8,000 ounces in sil
ver to the ton.
Finding that thirty per cent could
be saved by treating the ore here, the
company erected a small crushing and
amalgating plant, a short distance be
low the basin, which gave very fair
results. However, tests showed that
a greater saving of metal could be ob
tained by using the cyanide process,
and a new plant of 10 tons capacity is
now nearing completion.
Bessonette Manager
The company is owned by Texas
people, and W. T. Bessonette, form
erly of Waco, is in charge of the prop
erty as manager. Mr. Bessonette, who
was in Globe during the week, says
that a tunnel has been run 750 feet
on the principal vein, from which
about five tons of ore is being ex
tracted daily. The ore averages 50
to 60 ounces silver, and some of it
runs as high as 7000 or 8000 ounces.
About six miles of good road has been
constructed, and one can now go from
Globe to Richmond Basin by automo
bile in an hour.
The Gila Monster Mining company,
Mr. Seamon manager, owning the
Mack Morris and other properties at
Richmond Basin, which were large
silver producers nearly forty years
ago, will soon have their mill in operation.
THE GLOBE FIELD SILVER TIP CLAIM
Work Being Done Quietly
But of Important extent;
Road Building Feature
GLOBE, May 31. So quietly has
the Castle Dome Development com
pany carried on work at it3 large
copper property that few persons in
this district have had any knowledge
of what was being done there, Man
ager Drummond being averse to giv
ing out information until justified by
developments.
The Castle Dome property is situ
ated on Gold Creek, adjoining the
Continental, owned by the Old Do
minion company, and is about six
teen , miles west of Globe and ten
miles from Miami. The company is
controlled by New York men of
large financial resources. The work
thus far has been largely of a pre
liminary character building roads
(of which about 4600 feet have been
constructed) erecting the few neces
sary camp houses and prospecting
the ledge by means of a tunnel driv
en into the mountain about 350 feet,
and two drifts in ore starting, each
about fifty feet in length, 300 orj
more ieet irom me porcai oi tne tun
nel. The ore in the drifts, chalcocite
and chalcopyrite, it is said, averages
about four.per cent. The tunnel is al
so in ore of the same character, for
the greater part of its length.
The showing is sufficiently en
couraging to warrant drilling to de
termine the width and thickness of
the orebody. It is planned to drill
a series of holes, the first of which
was started this week, near the por
tal of the tunnel. Drilling will be in
charge of Mr. Owens, who has had
many years' experience, he having
drilled on the properties of the In
spiration Consolidated, Miami Cop
per, Nevada Consolidated and Utah
Copper.
GREEN
MONSTER TO
RESUME WORK ON
Operations On Large Scale;
Sinking of 200 Ft. Shaft
To BeTirst Work
JEROME, May 31. Active opera
tions on a large scale will be resumed
at the Green Monster mine within the
course of a day or two, according to
aa announcement made by W. S.
Humbert, president of the "company.
Arrangements to unwater the main
shaft and explore the Silver Tip
claim, were made at a meeting of
the board of directors held Tuesday
night.
An effort is to be made to recover
the ground lost by the long period of
idleness brought about by the I. W.
W., who succeeded in bringing min
ing developments in the district to
a standstill last February. The op
erations are to be resumed on a large
scale, and each phase speeded up to
the maximum consistent with effi
ciency. ,
The plans contemplate the sinking
of a 200-foot incline shaft on tne
promising Sliver Tip claim. This
work is to begin immediately, a con
tract for the work having been let
to E. S. Bartholomew, of this city.
While no estimate as to the time that
will be required to complete thi3
work was hazarded by the directors,
it is safe to assume that the shaft
will ,be sunk in record time.
' First Development
The present is the first attempt
that has been made to seriously de
velop the Silver Tip claim. About a
year ago there was some exploration
started, but in spite of favorable .
dications, this was not followed out.
The proving work consisted of shal
low trenching, and one 30-foot iiy
clined shaft. This work was inter
rupted by a change in the main pro
gram of development, and a later at
tempt to carry on the exploration
was defeated by a strike in Feb
ruary. The outcroppings on this claim are
in some places 18 inches -wide on the
surface. The ore in the vein assays
about 20 ounces of Bilver to the ton
and has an appreciable gold and cop
per content. The strike of the vein
is northwest and southeast and tn
dip from 30 to 35 degfces west.
To Unwater Shaft
The exploration of the Silver. Tip
claim will not interfere with th op
erations at the main shaft, on whicri
work will begin at the same time.
The plans for this latter phase have
not been announced. The first prob-
SHUN MINE SWEEPING,
HUNS HAVE A REASON
LONDON, May 31. British naval
men complain the Germans do almost
nothing to aid in removing the mines ,
which they had planted and which
armistice terms require they shall
sweep up. Moreover, the Germans, in
violation of international law, when
they planted thousands of mines re
moved the chains which were there
to pull out the primers in case the
mines broke from their moorings. So
floating mines, instead of being harm
less are a double menace.
BEAUTIFUL BACKS
IN LONDON SHOPS
LONDON, May 31. "Beautiful
backs" is coming to be a trade mark
with London beauty parlors. With
this year's evening frocks cut to ex
pose the. back almost completely, spec
ial treatments have been devised to
. make it presentable. - Special cream
and massage to smooth and whiten
the skin and improve the appearance
icf prominent vetebrae are used and
electrical treatment is popular.

CAN CALL IIP ON A
RAY OF LIGHT NOW
PORTO RICO FUTURE
MOVIE STUDIO HOME
SAN JUAN, May 31. Porto . Rico
may become to the motion picture in
dustry all that southern California has
been. There's ' plenty of "atmos
phere" of the artistic, type, and it only
remains to demonstrate that the. at
mosphere of the climatic type is right.
F. Eugene Farnsworth of New York,
one of the pioneers in the picture
business, here investigating, says:
"Porto Rico's.1 coast . line, mountains,
vegetation and buildings are more
varied and attractive than California.
It offers new themes and plots that
will prove of fascinating value."
, Housecleaning time is here and you
will need ' lots of clean papers under
your carpets, rugs and on shelves.
Get them at the Review office in
25-cent bundles. A-27
I-iONDON, May 31. Talking over a
ray of light is now possible. A young
British scientist has developed the in-(
struments by which the messages arej
sent. The message is spoken into a 1
transmitter. The diaphragm oscilates '
a mirror which sendout intermittent i
flashes of reflected light.. As the re-j
ceiving end a lens catches the light
rays and the action of selenium cells
translates the flashes through a tele
phone receiver Into speech. The limit
of distance is, of course, the horizon
and the stronger the light ray the
clearer the message. But only one
message can travel over a ray an-I full
secrecy is assured.
BULLET PROOF TANK
FOR PLANES INVENTED
' LONDON, May 31. A bullet-proof
gas tank for airplanes is the invention
of a Canadian officer, Lieutenant J.
Imber. Where a bullet enters a gas
tank the hole is small, but where it
passes out it makes a huge opening.
A series of "baffle plates" to stop the
swish of the fuel and, a thin metal
case with a quarter-inch rubber coating
which springs out with the passing of
the bullet, and back into place closing
the opening, is the substance of the
invention.

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW .
NE WYORK, May 31. Business on
the stock exchange this week was lim
ited to four full sessions, but the turn
over in that comparatively short time
lacked nothing In point of activity or
variety, the first day's operations
aggregating slightly more than 2,000,
000 shares.
Intervals of dullness and uncertain
ty accompanied signs of higher money
land apprehension concerning the pos
sible course of events abroad, but
these were overcome by fresh waves
of buying which embraced the entire
list.
The market has experienced almost
four months of trading on an unpar
alleled scale. ' Its magnitude may be
judged from the fact that stock trans
actions for the first months of the
year almost doubled the 1918 output
for the same period, while bond sales
FREEDOM, STATEHOOD,
PORTO RICO DEMANDS
SAN JUAN, May 31. Statehood or
independence. That's the ultimatum
whicfi" Porto Rico would deliver to the
United States.. El Tempo the princi
pal paper on the island, which is print
ed in Spanish, with one page of news
in English and an editorial page in
English is presenting daily arguments
for action. "The big and little brother
business is nonsense. If Porto Rico is
not going to be a 'state of the union
sometime, if she is not established as
a territory, leading to statehood, even
though the road be a long one, then
Porto Rico is no place for a navy yard
or for military headquarters of any
kind. Porto Rico will not. be made"
loyal by any twaddle about love, or
protection, or in any other-way except
by placing them pn a, basis of man to
man with, all other citizens of the
United States under the constitution.
If the United States .government in
tends 'to ufifize Porto Rico "as a key
to the canal, the future sffould. be
clarified without delay."

THE .GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO,. May 31. Belated cover

sharp last-of-the-month bulge In" corn

varying from 28c off to a rise. of 65c.
Fresh supplies, here amounting to

it soon, developed that Industries were

'TUCSON. May 31 With 75,000 tons
ot gold, averaging: $40 per ton and
better, and rich streaks running to
$250,000 per ton, according to report,
the Azlan Cold syndicate has placvd
its first complete collection of jewel
ry store ore on exhibition in the
chamber of commerce, with the result
that there may be a rush to the vicin
ity of Winkleman which should rival
Ooldfield after the discovery of the
Sandstorm.
The ore was found in a blanket
Tein, on a footwall of andesite, under
a hangwall of lime, the regular forma
tion of the country. There is a possi
bility that it will be continuous, ow
ing to the thorough dissemination,
thiough the gangue. The gold is main-!
' ly cryatalized ore. There is wire gold,
also, and nuggets galore in the collec-j
tion. I
i Unfortunately for Tucson, and thej
Tucson investors, H. A. Whitcomb.
who is handling the proposition, an-j
nounced that all the stock had been!
disposed of and all the likery land;
had been taken up. However, gold iai
where it is and the probabilities of a
rush would be based upon that faet.
The discovery of rich gold in the;
district is not new. It has been j
found in rich pockets in the districts
for the last twenty years, but this is
the first time it has been found in
continuous vein formation.
' The discovery is credited by Mr.
Whitcomb to E. I). Scott and E.'.R. j
Tufts. Nelson O'Shaughnessy, form-,
erly American minister to Mexico,
was also credited with participation.
' ' Seven Milts From Winkleman
"These claims are located seven
miles from .Winkleman," says Whit
comb, "the ore is found in a blanket
vein covering the seven claims of the
group, the vein varying in thickness
from five to twenty feet and is cut at
intervals by six vertical veins car
rying very high gold values. Some
of the samples assayed are said to run
as high as $200,000 per ton in gold.
And think of it!v This is right at the
very threshold of Tucson doesn't
that mean wonderfully increased pros
perity for Tucson and all southern
Arizona?"
Mr. Whitcomb says he already has
$2,500,00 of ore blocked out.
Plan Aerial Tramway
The company proposes to build an
aerial tramway from the mine to a
point on the Arizona Eastern railway
and on the Gila river, four and a
half miles from the mine, where
ground is now being broken for the
erection of a mill the material for
which is now being assembled there,"
said Mr. Whitcomb.
Mr. Whitcomb, who has taken over
the property, is in conjunction with
eastern capitalists, preparing to oper
ate on a large scale.
"There will be-no stock for sale,"
said Mr. Wihtcomb. "Fortified withj
a bank account of $15,000 and. prac
tically unlimited financial resources,
we hope to make the operation of
the mine an assured certainty.". ;
Hiram Whitcomb is one of the well
known mining men in this part of the
country. He operated the Las Guijas
tungsten property.
Mr. Whitcomb is now operating the
mill at the mine of the Patagonia dis
trict, Santa Cruz county. The World's
Fair up to date has produced more
than a million dollars. It is now
steadily producing silver, lead and
copper. ' '
EL 10 MINES
AT SILVERBELL
ARE WATERED
Leasing Company Busy With"
Pumps For Past Month;
Recover 300-Ft. Level
TUCSON, May 31. May 15th wit
nessed the end of the first month of
operations at the El Tiro copper mines
Silverbell district, under the control of
the new El Tiro : leasing company,
V. I i V. 1. n a n ia t'AQv Iaaba n ttia Aft.
tire property. ' j
The manager, Percy Williams, , re
ports that the entire month was given
over to pumping operations and the
Inauguration of certain changes that
will makei for decreased costs of oper
ations when shipping recommences.
The 300-foot level, which has been
under water for seven years, was re
covered after 18 days of steady pump
ingday and night during which pe
riod sa me7,000,000 of gallons of water
were raised. Now that this level has
been recovered, the pumping opera
tions are vastly diminished as it only
requires a few hours' pumping each
day to hold the water down. The
pumping costs from now on will
amount to about 20 per cent of the
cost of the first month's pumping.
In reopening the 300-foot level, a,
few caves have" yet to be cleaned up
and retimbered and new track laid,
after which work shipments will be re
sumed of 8 per cent copper ore, the
amount shipped depending on the con
dition ot the copper market. It Is
interesting to note that on 8 per cent
copper ore, a difference of 2 cents per
pound in the marke price makes , a
difference ' In revenue of about $4500
per month when shipping a car a day
only from this property.
The heavy expenditure entailed by
the reopening of the three compart
ment shaft of El Tiro at the railioad,
together with the initial pumping cost
to remove accumulated water and the
purchasing of supplies is now com
plete and from now on the expendi
tures will greatly decrease each
month until the profits from ore taken
month ntll the profits from ore taken
out In development work will more
tha,n meet all expenses.
, Mr. Williams states that' during the
month two men mined and filled the
underground bins with more than
three carloads of high-grade ore,
which is ready to be shipped as soon
as the .underground collections on the
300-foot level is cleaned out between
the big shaft and the new stopes
which produced so prolifically last
year. Many experienced mining men
who have recently viewed the rehabi
litation now going on at EI Tiro under
Mr. Williams' direction, have express
ed the opinion that El Tiro costs will
be lower than obtains at any other
small produced in the country.
Numerous changes have ben mado
In the bip power house to reduce fuel
consumption, while haulage and track
age has been changed to facilitate
placing the ore direct from the stopes
on board the railroad cars without
more, than one hauling.
El Tiro is in shape to make a hand
some profit t 18 cent copper.
ATLANTIS
COMPANY
MAKES
PROGRESS
TO SHIP ORE SOON
Installing 'of Machinery ii
Proceeding Rapidly ; Have
15 Silver Claims '
GLOBE, May 31. General Manager
J. D. Riley of the Atlantis Mining
company, announces that considera
ble progress has been made in the in
stallation of the mill and other min
ing machinery on the property, and
that - within a short j time shipments
will be mads to the smelter." The
property,-which is Bituated in the Ox
Bow range of mountains near Payson
is predicted by experts as one of the
most likely prospects in this section
of the state, especially at the pre
vailing price of the white metal. -
The property consists of 15 claims
and considerable work has been done,
on several of them. The largest
amount of work has been done on
the Golden Wreath claim. Here a
tunnel has been driven into the hill
a distance of 600 feet, aiyi ' It Is
claimed that ore 13 showing practical
ly the entire length of the tunnel.
One hundred and forty feet from the
mouth of the tunnel a . winze was
sunk 100 feet deep In ore. ' Another
winze 15 feet deep was also sunk
further on, then an upraise was driv
en to the surface. All these work
ings are In ore carrying iron oxide
and manganese, gold and silver with
a small amount of copper.
The new mill building which has
just recently been completed houses
the fifteen ton roller quartz mill, the
fifty-ton Dodge rock breaker, a twen
ty horse power engine, an N. V. Mc
Donald separator, an amalgamator,
ore bins, shafting and all necessary
mill adjuncts. Tracks, cars, engine
with pipe for aid and other accesso
ries are included in the up-to-date
equipment.
Mr.- Riley reports that he has ar
ranged for the best of living condi
tions for , his employes. An ample
water supply is furnished from the
flowing springs on the property, of
which there are a number.' The
boarding house is a building 18 by
30 in dimensions.' Four comfortable
sleeping houses are occupied by the
mine workers.
On the recommendation of ' Con
sulting Engineer Geo. Behune, and
under his supervision, considerable
development work has been mapped
out. Mr. Riley states that with the
amount of paying ore on the dump
and the promising ore bodies of good
values which have already been de
veloped, he is confident of the future
of the Atlantis property.
