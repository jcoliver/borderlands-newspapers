SAYS WILSON'S STEP
FRAUGHT WITH DANGER
Offers ' Resolution Declaring
Agamst Peace Step Dem

and Stand by President
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 25. Ground
work for the expected attack in the
senate on President WilbOn's propo
sal that the United States join a
league for peace was laid today in a
resolution introduced by Senator Bor
ah, reaffirming as a national policy the
doctrine of no entangling alliances laid
down by Washington and Jefferson.
Strong for Tradition
I'nlike the pending Cummins' reso
lution. Senator Borah's proposal
makes no direct reference to the
President's peace address, but its
adoption Mould commit the senate "in
all matters coming before it touching
the intent or affairs of foreign coun
tries, to conform its acts to these
time-honored principles so long and
so happily a part of our own policy."
There was no debate on the resolu
tion, but after its introduction Demo
cratic members of the foreign rela
tions committee went into informal
conference and made pleas to fore
stall discussion before the committee
has considered it
Traditions Not In Danger
The Democrats insisted that the
President bad proposed no departure
there is nothing in the resolution to
reflect on his utterances. SVrnie lead
ers even predicted that if the resolu
tion came to a vote every Democrat
would support it, but they declared
discussion needlessly would disrupt
senate business.
Resolution Up Today
Senator Borah asked that the reso
lution go over for a day but did not
reveal whether he would call it up
tomorrow. Senator Cummins also de
clined to say whetner he would press
his resolution setting aside next week
for debate on the President's speech,
lie did not attempt to call it up to
day. Washington Quoted
In a long preamble, the Borah reso
lution quotes Washington's declara
tion in his farewell address that, "it
must be unwise to implicate ourselves
by artificial ties," in the affairs of the
old world, a letter written by Jeffer
son declaring, "our first and funda
mental maxim should be never to en
tangle ourselves in the broils of Eur
ope"; and Monroe's historic message
to congress laying dOwn the doctrine
of America for Americans. The res
olution then says:
"Whereas, the policies thus early
announced by Washington. Jefferson
and Monore, have contributed greatly
to the peace and happiness of the peo
ple of the United States, and,
"Whereas, we believe any material
departure from these policies would
be fraught, with danger to the peace
and happiness Of the people of the
United Stales involving us, in all prob
ability, in the controversies of other
nations, be it,
"Resolved that the senate of the
United States reaffirm its faith and
confidence in the permanent worth and
wisdom of these policies and shall
seek in all matters coming before it
touching the intent or affairs of for
elgn countries, tj conform its acts
to these time-honored principles so
long and so happily a part of our own
policies."
To Oppose Borah
If Senator Borah attempts to press
the resolution tomorrow, the foreign
relations committee Democrats will
move to refer it to the committee.
Should pronounced opposition to that
course develop, however, the leaders
declare it will not be insisted upon,
and that Democrats will join the Re
publicans iu passing the measure. The
Democrats pointed out that the Pres-
IftAnt himao'F Hprlnrprl in ht nriHroaa
that participation in a league for peace j
would not be a departure from the

Canadian Senator Maligns Wilson for Seeking Peace
Without Victory. Would Bar U. S. From Taking Hand
In Peace Terms. Says Wilson Talks Like Pedagogue
(By Review Leased Wire.)
OTTAWA. Ont. Jan. 25. The peace
proposals of President Wilson were
discussed in the Canadian senate to
day by Senator Pope who represents
one of the English speaking districts
in the province of Quebec and who
has been a member of parliament for
many years.
Senator Pope offered a resolution
providing that "in the opinion of the
senate of Canada, only representa
tives of nations who have taken part
or who have been encaged in the
present war should participate in the
negotiations for peace."

journed at four o'clock, One entire pre
cinct, Safford No. 1 hud been passed,
with the exception of about fifty bal
lots laid aside during the inspection,
and one dozen laid aside as disputed
during the day.
Speeds Up Court
On the resumption of the case this
afternoon. Judge Stanford requested
counsel for Campbell and Hunt to
stipulate that when the tellers agreed
in their count on undisputed ballots,
that these ballots be left out of fur
ther proceedings; in other words that
the recount determii e the number ot
regularly marked bal ots and the num
ber of disputed or i: regular ones and
that the court be r. quired to pass
only on the irre'ilJj',J1ilVui. -
During the morning session, the two
tellers, one named by each side had
worked separately. Upon suggestion
of Attorney Billiard, the tellers were
sworn in as court attaches and pro
vided with seats together, so that they
might check their lists as the recount
proceeded.
Another important result was to de
termine to pass or rule on all disputed
ballots at the end or recounting the
precinct in which they occurred. In
this way, each precinct will be treated
as a distinct section, the ballots will
be sifted for irregularities, the dis
puted votes will be decided and award
ed and at the end of each little hear
ing, that precinct will be tallied com
plete. Campbell Leads
Safford No. 1 showed the following
figures recount: Hunt 2t9, Campbell
296; official count. Hunt 301, Camp
bell 328; inspectors' count, Hunt 303,
Campbell 321. During the course of
the day Dullard laid aside 7 Hunt bal
lots as questionable and Ives laid
aside 5 for Campbell for the same rea
son. The trial opened with the filing and
arguing of a demurer by Billiard to the
entire proceeding. This was over
ruled.
Bullard then attempted to bring in
the election boards, as the most com
petent men to attest the ballots were
the actual ones cast in the election,
counted by the boards and canvassed
by the boards of supervisors. This
motion was over ruled. After some
time spent in arguing the preliminar
ies the tally clerks or tellers were

he thought it proper that Canada
should express through the senate an
opinion as to who was entitled to pass
upon terms of peace.
Canada Not Too Proud

WASHINGTON, Jan. 5. The
world peace address of President
Wilson to the senate was inter
preted by Elihu Root in a speech
here tonight as an admission that
there is no way out except by
preparation for war and aa a de
nunciation of the course of Ger
many. He said he was in full
sympathy with the purposes of the
speech, which contained "much
. noble idealism."
.Mr. Root spoke before the National
Security League's congress of con
structive patriotism, beginning a three
day session. He appealed for a return
to the "basic principle" upon which
this government was founded. '
U. S. FREEDOM THREATENED
"American freedom was threat
ened, he declared, by the princi
ple of 'liberty of national evolu
tion' asserted by Germany, the
. application of which had meant
the overwhelming of Serbia and
: Belgium and which, if approved
by the world will mean that "our
American freedom will surely die,
and die while we live."
Cheer Abuse of Germany
The spcaker'a plea for universal ser
vice and bis denunciation of Germany
brought his bearers to their feet,
cheering, time and again. His address
was the . feature of a day filled with
vigorous appeals for universal mill
tar training and service, which prom
ises to be the central theme of tht
congress, although a long program in
which other questions of national de
fense will be treated has been mapped
out.
Alton B. Parker of New York pre
sided today and Senator Sutherland ol
Utah was in the chair at the night ses
sion, the speakers including S. Stan
wood Menken, first president of the
Security League; Lawrence F. Abbott,
Mrs. Wm. William Cumming Storey.
Wni. Roscoe Thayer. Henry L. Stim
tOn, former secretary of war; George
Von L. Meyer, former secretary of the
navy; and Rear Admiral Bradley A.
Fiske, retired. Every speaker en
dorsed proposals tor universal service
which will be formally recommended
in resolutions later.
U. S. Defenseless'
Mr. Menken declared that despite
two years of effort, the defense prob
lem was unsolved. He credited Sec
retary Daniels with having exercised
every effort to build up the navy
but declared the Hay bill. contained
treasonable measures of "pork." He
demanded that congress meet in ex
tra session to work out an adequate
military policy.
Mr. Root said the European war was
begun on the principle that a state
exigency is superior to those rules of
morality which control individuals. He
continued
"Upon that principle, it was de
clared there was no obligation upon
a nation to keep the faith of a treaty
if it did not suit its interests.
Force Alone Wins
"It doesn't matter much what you
and I think abont these things. What
does matter is that approximately one
half of the entire military forcft of
this world supports that proposition
and I say if that principle of national
conduct bo approved, then our Amer
ican freedom will surely die, and die

nication in regard to certain pro
visions which it has been propos
ed to include in the new Mexican
constitution. The communication
calls attention to judicial re
course and also the article pro
viding that civil commercial com
panies cannot own property of a
greater area than is necessary to
accomplish the purpose for which
they are formed and placing the
power to determine what area is
necessary in the hands of the ex
ecutive. Mustn't Confiscate
The communication says that if the
latter provision were made retroact
ive it might be confiscatory as no pru
vision Is made for compensation.
Attention is called to the article
providing that there be no exemption
from taxation. It this were given a
retroactive effect, says Secretary Lan
sing's communication, it would impair
contracts of many foreign companies
now operating under contracts pro
viding periods of exemption by the
federal or state governments.
Rights of Foreigners
Regarding Article 33, dealing with
the expulsion of obnoxious foreigners,
objection is made because the pro
posed article permits the executive to
expel any one. without recourse to
appeal, whose presence is deemed in
advisable by him. The letter states
that this is not in accord with the us

RELATIONS HURT
WASHINGTON. Jan. 25. Future
relations of the Mexican de facto gov
ernment with the United States may
be materially affected by-the manner
in which the suggestions of Secretary
Lansing regarding the proposed radi
cal changes in the constitution are re
ceived by General Carranza and thi
members of the constitutional con
gress now la session at Queretaro.
The protest delivered to the for
eign office in Mexico City against in
corporation in the new constitution,
of provisions limiting property hold
ings of foreigners, and providing for
other restrictions of the rights of for
eigners, was made after the receipt ml
the state department of numerous
complaints front American with prop
erty in Mexico. Enactment of such,
constitutional proisions may prove
cause for diplomatic entanglements,
not oiily with the United States grov
ernment but with other governments
whose nationals have invested in
Mexico.
Secretary Lansing's protest against
the adoption of a provision for con
fiscation of property was based on the,
proposed article in which it is stated:
Would Seize Property
"Private propeity shall not be seiz
ed for public purposes without com
pensation. The need ot utility of
such seizure shall be determined br
the proper authorities, but ia th
event of any disagreement as to terms

Further basis for protest was found
in a continuation of the article read
ing: "Civil and commercial corporations

also own and exploit mining proper

"The war is not won yet and we
want to concert our efforts so that
we may exert our maximum strensih
at the critical moment.. Further, we
are n:ost anxious that (faring the last
and most dying phase of the -war the
British empire may present to the
! world an absolutely united front. Up
to the present the Eritisli government
j has shouldered responsibility for the
i policy of the war practically alone.
It now wishes to know that in its
measures for carrying the war to a
j finish and in its negotiations for
i peae it will be carrying out a policy
I agreed upon by representatives of the
whole empire sitting in plenary coun
! cil."
I "What about after the war?" he
I was asked.
"If you mean by that constitutional
reconstructions." replied Mr. Lloyd
George, "I can only say it is too soon
to talk about "after the war,' but I

VILLA'S GOME BACK
THREATENS MINING
GAMPS OF SONORA
His Declaration to "Drive Out
Barbarians of North" If Ex
ecuted May Paralize Sonora
Industries.
Willi Villa "comin? back," Persh
ing coming out, and the guardsmen
along the border going home, anxiety
among local mining men over th
Mexican situation is growing acute
again.
Superficially, Sonora is tranquil.
Calles and the Carranzistas are firm
ly in the saddle and the Villistas seem
to have vanished into thin air.' No
one pretends to believe, however, that
ill danger is past. From time to time
there have been rumors of little plots
here and there in Sonora
Naturally
people as far noith as the border do
not get their full import. Just a few
days ago. it is said, Calles authorities
at Nacozari investigated a report
about some kind of a Viiia frameup
among the Mexican miners ct Plli:ies(
Probably Remembers
Villa got such a drubbing the last
time hiA tfame.to f0"a that It -in not
considered likely that he will attempt
soon to repeat such an operation, but
if he continues to gain the ascenden
cy that he has been' lately in Chihua
hu, there is ground for apprehension
that his followers will start trouble
in Sonora. Villa once more has pos
session of northern Chihuahua with
the exception of the ground covered
by the punitive expedition. It is claim
ed in some quarters that he could
easily take Juarez if it were not for
the danger of the American troops,
50,000 of them, just across the line.
After months of comparative quiet
ness along the border, the situation
s again pregnant with serious possi
bilities. Carranza is not as secure as
he was six months ago. Villa is gain- j
ing in popularity through his promise
to drive out the "barbarians from the
North."
Many Rebel Bands
About a half dozen well officered
retel hands are now operating in
Mexico with very little in common
except hostility toward the de fact
wvernnn-iil. persons of huig and in
timat" acquaintance with Mexican af
fairs say. Sometimes a fictitious un
ity is given them through' so've paper
party such as the "lcgalista." But
the legalistas themselves disclaim any
coii'iection with any fiction, saying
that their aim is not a military one
but to work out a plan for a united
Mexico. They exprivs willingness to
support the Carranza government if
a free civil government is re-estab-'ished
and constitutional guarantees
that have been susHiided by martial
law are restored.
Francisco Villa is considered by
northern military critics as the ablest
fi:lit"r among the revolutionary
chiefs, loll, by reason (.f his ability
ill the tic ami his. hold on his ful
'overs. No other l-aih r has succeed
ed in the making of the Mexican, who
likes to tight from behind rocks or at
long range charge w enemy lines.
He introduced hand grenade attacks
before the outbreak of the European
war.
Villa's Program
Villa's political program, according
o his proclamations, is con f tied most
ly to the icha f driving out foreign
ers, particularly the Syrians and Chi
nes., who intermarry with the Mexi
cans. His hatred of Americans, it is
snid by his old friends here, would
disappear in case of American for
gheiioss and recognition it he should
prove successful ill northern .Mexico
against Carranza.
Zapata, who operated in Motclos,
south of Mexico City, bases his cause
on auraiiaii relorms. His state is
largely owned I,y alioui ten landlords,
most of them Spaniards, fie has de
clared that he v ill support l-ociii-
nient that does not equalize land hold
ings. On the military side, Zap;a is re
garded as weak. He his no army,
but a kind of militia that gatheis to
gether, makes some raid and then qui
etly returns to work in t'.e fields in
time to greet the punitive expedition.
He keeps some outposts employed,
however, and did make an organized
stand at Cuernavaca and a few other
points. ;
Believe Him Invulnerable
Zapata's followers believe he is in
vulenrable, much as Aguinaldo was
regarded by the Filipinos during his
insurrection after the Spanish war.
He has been generous to the peon,
but has tortured members of the land
lord class with unspeakable barbari
ties. Felix Diaz, although regarded as a
liberal in the time of his uncle, Pres
ident Diaz, now is said to favor cer
tain interests that prospered during
the Diaz regime. His operations have
been confined to the Guataniala bor
der, and from time to time have been
swelled by rumor to"large proportions.
Jose Ysajiel Robles, according to
his own report of operations in Oax- ,
aca, received here recently, seems to
have moved in the backwoods there, ,
without accomplishing much of im
portance. Rumors out of Mexico had
him seizing Puebla and other large
cities of the south, but these have
teen disproved. He is said to be un
allied politically, and little is known
of his purposes.
Robles on War Path
Robles, after being paroled a year
or two ago by Villa on condition of
withdrawing from Mexican politics,

BIG AND INTERESTED
CROWDSTO ORPHEUM
William S. Hart, in the Title
Role, Makes Good Before
Screen Fans Border Story
Is Excellently Told.
During the filming of some scenes
of "The Patriot." which plays again
today at the Orphoum, the powerful
Triangle drama of the Mexican border,
from the pen of Monte M. KatterjJhn
in which Thomas M. Ince presents Wil
liam S. Hart as star, little Francis
Carperter. who shares honors with
Georgie Stone as the boy actor of the
piece was taken to a "location" one
evening, and became st sleepy while
other members of the company were
rehearsing that it was found necessary
to arrange a cot for him in one of the
tents, in order that he might doze in
comfort while in the grip of the "sand
man."
About three o'clock in the morninjr,
after rehearsing and "shooting" night
-scenes ior several ivours. Hart was
. heard to remark that "Francis sure
' has grit." because of the zest with
which thin sturdy little chap, when
" wakened every half hour, would rub
his eyes for a tfiinute. until thoroughly
alive to the work in hand, and.be
ready to go on with his part, not with
standing that It was long past his
.usual bedtime.
Francis' part is one tf importance,
- but he is challenged for the glory by
Master Stone, the other boy player.
, Oeorgie, too, has many "big" scenes
w-ith Hart, princ'pal among which are
those which depict him. at the begin
ping of the story, in the patriotic act
of lighting firecrackers tm the doorstep
of his father's shack in New Mexico
on the m'jrnhig of the Fourth of July.
Discoloring his father in the doorway.
dressed in the uniform of an American
soldier, Georgie, as "Little Bobs," in
chidih devotion asks: "Are vou a so-
jerj too?" and without waiting for an
answer struts, with inimitable military-dignity,
to his side, turns and
with shoulders squared and body rigid,
salutes the Stars and Stripes. The
scene is said to be unusually impressive.

How many have seen the "poor
mountain whites" hold a dance? The
custom has so quickly died out that
even in the little frequented Kentucky
mountains it is a rare occurrence but
the Morosc'J-Paramount photoplay,
"The Stronger Love" shows the best
scene ever photographed of a country
dance held in the district schoolhouse
at night. The antics of the "moun
tain Johnnies'' and their almost bar
baric methods of "courtin' " seem too
primitive to actually exist
In the wild surroundings, according
to the film play coming to the Lowell
theater tonight, lives a mountain girl
whose ingenious charm and unsophis
tic allurement plays ha'oc with the
affections of many strong men and
leads to a most unexpected turn of
events. Vivian Martin plays the part
of the girl.

Sparkling and vivacious merry,
bright, alert a good, clear skin and
a natural, rosy, healthy complexion
are assured only by nnre blood. If
only every man and women could be j
induced to adopt the morning Inside
bath, what a gratifying change would i
take place. Instead of the thousands
of sickly, anemic-looking men, women
and girls, with pasty or muddv com-.
plexions; instead of the multitudes of
"nerve wrecks,- "rundowns," "brain
fags" and pessimists we should see
a virile, optimistic throng of rosy-
cheeked people- everywhere.
An inside bath is had by drinking
each morning, before breakfast, a
glass of real hot water with a tea
spoonful of limestone' phosphate in It
to wash from the stomach, liver, kid
neys and ten yards of bowels the prel
vious day's indigestible waste, sour
fermentations and poisons, thus
cleansing, sweetening and freshening
the entire alimentary canal before
putting more food into the stomach.
Those subject to sick headache, bil- j
iousness, nasty breath, rheumatism,
j colds; and particularly those who I
! have a pallid, sallow complexion and j
who are constipated very often, are i
urged to obtain a quarter pound of
limestone phosphate at the drug store I
which will cost but a trifle, but is j
sufficient to demonstrate the quick
and remarkable change In both health '
and appearance, awaiting those who
practice internal sanitation. We must
remember that inside cleanliness Is
more important than outside, because
the skin does not absorb Impurities
to contaminate the blood while the
pores in the thirty feet of dowaIs do.

i WORK FOR CONGRESS.
The present congressional session is half over, but
; there Is little evidence that congress has done half its
'j work. The Wall Street "peace leak" investigation seems
to have paralyzed its energies and kept it from more
j important duties. With little more than a month left,
j the president is right in urging the law-makers to get
I busy.
Most essential of all are the appropriation bills. They
, will be passed, of course. But they ought to be handled
nant with charges and countercharges are prepared. Tombstone, Arizona., Jan. 18, 1917.
Trifles light as air are magnified to give the case added Hon. Harry C. Wheeler, Sheriff,
seriousness. To secure the divorce and earn the fee, Cocmse County,
Tombstone, Arizona,
the lawyer compiles a debit account which often works near Sir:
eerious and irreparable destruction." j Vour communication containing the
Tk. , ( ,,rf following questions, recered.
1. On which date did said law take
the bitter charges and counter-charges are presented, en-ect? (referring to the Prohibition
whatever scandal there may be is dragged into the light, Law adopted November, 191B)
1. Just what is contemplated by
and the court passes judgment not on a human problem
involving two weak and erring mortals but on abstract
points of law.
"Too often the judge is merely a highly dignified
referee in a technical game." If the lawyer has done
his work well, tiie divorce Is granted and two partners
who in most case smight have been reconciled are sepa
rated forever, with mutual bitterness and the destruction
of family life.
In Cleveland there was established some years ago a
conciliation court to handle civil disagreements, includ
ing domestic troubles, in an informal way. Chicago fol
lowed later with a specific "court of domestic relations."
Both institutions have been of great benefit in combat
ting this evil. Husband and wife appear before a judge
who is not there to weigh technical arguments but to
act as mediator. He hears their stories, balances ac
counts, makes allowances for human frailties. He tries

the last day. This is no time to waste money by mis
taken or porcine appropriations.
The railroad bills, too, are highly important. In en
acting the Adamson eight-hour bill last session, congress
either went too far or not far enough. If that measure
is to stand, there should be some such complementary
measures as the president has asked for, particularly a
law preventing the calling of strikes or lockouts with- .
out due notice and public investigation. j
Attention, too, is demanded by the water, power and
public land leasing bills. The development cf our nat- j
ural resources has too long been held up by delay in j
working out proper legislation along these lines. And j
there are numerous other matters that conrress can j
profitably occupy itself with every working day up to ;
the expiration of the session of March 4.
proportion of cases lie is successful.
THE EGG KING WINS.
James E. Wetz cf Chicago, attained fame a few weeks
ago by announcing that he had cornered most of the vis
ible storage egg supply and expected to clean up a mill
ion dollars. To all outbursts of popular indignation he
stuck his thumbs in his waistcoat arm-hcles and tilted
his cigar toward his left eye and asked, "What are you I
going to do about it?
He was investigated, along with other food specula
tors, by the federal department of justice, but nothing
happened, except a temporary and ineffective boycott
of eggs. Apparently he was within the law, and could ply
his genial trade immune from prosecution.
Well, "King" Wetz has just announced that, having
bold Jiis eggs, he's going south with his family tor the
rest of the winter, lie courteously conveys his thanks
to the Chicago aldermen and Housewives' League, to
gether with other officials and organizations that tried
to force down the price by boycotting eggs.
"They made folks think it a sure tign of aristocracy to
at eggs," he says, 'Everybody wanted to 1; aristocratic.
Everybody ate eggs. Demaud jumped. I made 11.000,
000. I ought to allow a generous commission to the
originators of the boycott."
It's well, perhaps, that somebody should see a little
humor in the tragic situation that enables speculators
to make fortunes by levying tribute on the people's food.
And as long as the public stands for the absurd prac
tices and laws that permit such outrage, the public de
serves to be treated as the butt of the joke. Wetz, in
laughing at the rest of us, is still within his rights.
WHEN FRENCH FAILS.
We used to be told that French was the most perfect
of languages, the one tongue in which very shade of
thcught or emotion could be expressed with the utmost
clearness and precision Because of this perfection
French was the chosen medium for diplomatic docu
ments. Recent comment tends to shatter this ideal. When
President Wilson's note asking the belligerents to state
their war-objects was dispatched, there came from Lon
don mournful laments about t:ie difficulty cf translating
certain parts of it into French. One vital passage, that
in which the president referred to the aims of the two
sides as being identical according to the statements of
their spokesmen, gave especial trouble. It was said
that it couldn't be turned into French without making
the president seem to declare that in his judgment the
aims of the two sides were actually identical. That ac
counts for much of the French indignation.
A British writer calls attention to another recent in
stance in point. When Mr. Asquith, on a certain critical
occasion, expressl his opinion by the sententious
i phrase, "Wait and see," the French translators had a
dreadful time with it. The best they could do was to
turn this fine, clear English sentence of three syllables
into "Attendex, et vous verrez ce qui arrivera," which
might be turned back into "Wait patiently, and you will
behold that which will arrive."
English is a pretty good language after all.
SCIENTISTS AND RELIGION.
Iir. James Henry Leuba, professer of psychology at
Bryn Mawr, has been investigating the religious faith of
Auierican scientists. He sent to 1,000 "men of science,
historians, sccioligi.sts and psychologists" a set of ques
tions concerning the existence of a God who answers
prayer and the personal immortality of the individual
man.
The results are not flattering to the faith of this
generation as represented in its intellectual leaders.
The majority of replies revealed a lack of belief in these
two great religious principles. And in general, the more
eminent the scientist, the less faith he professed. The
1,000 men were divided into two groups, 400 "greater
men" and 000 'lesser men". Of the former, less than
one-third believe in a personal God ami a little more
than one-third in personal immortality. Of the "lesser
' men about 4s per cent believe in a personal uou ana
j about. T)'.t per cent in personal immortality.
j 1'ruf. Leuba regards this as proof of "the widespread
rejection of the two fundamental dogmas of Christi
anity," and seems to believe that it threatens the doom
of tiie Christian church. With the greater diffusion of
knowledge, he intimates, the general public will agree
with the scientists.
It doesn't ne isarily follow, however. Scientists
themselves are probably less lacking in faith today than
they were a decade or two ago. The gross materialism
into wliic'i the scientific world was plunged by the work
THE SHELL CONTRACT.
Whatever the reason may be, it is huuiiiiating that
the bid for big naval shells should have to be givca, to a
British firm. U humiliates our government, after all
its preparedness efforts, and it particularly humiliates
American industry.
It hardly seems likely that the British k'icIIs have
been offered to us below their cost of production. Even
if Great Britain has more big shells than she needs at
present, they would hardly be given to a foreign nation
at a sacrifice.

3. In the case of liquor havin
been in one's possession previous to
said laws passage, would it be un
lawful to remove, or transfer, said
liquor, just as it would be unlawful to
transport liquor introduced uese
quent to the passage of the recent
Prohibition Law?
4.v Is it lawful for one to transfer,
from place to place, liquor in small
quantities, say as much as one bottle?
5. When finding jr locating any
great amount of liquor, nd there ir
doubt as to whether or not said liquni
was, or was not, introduced since the
recent law's passage, what would be
the wisest course, in your "oinion to
pursue. In the case of liquor now
my possession, is it not a violation
for any owner to transport or move
said liquor from the County jail to
any other point?
6. In case of liquor be;'i shipped
front one state to another, and
through ArizVma, wouid said shipment
be considered a violatio l of lluj 1-iws
of this state?
I will answer your questions con
seculively, as they are uumbe.-cd.
1. Paragraph 3103 of the Revised
Statutes of Arizona, 1913, provides:
(after making provision fcr canvass
ing the voles cast -n a measure) :
"That the governor shall forthwith
issue his proclamation, gtving tht
hle number of voted cast in tht
stale for and asa:nst each measure
and proposed constitutional amc-i'fl
meats as are appi.jved by a majorit)
of Lho.se voting thereo.i to ae in full
i'jrce and effect .us the law of the
Slate of Arizona, from the data ol
said proclamation," From this para
graph you will note that the law took
effect immediately upon the prDclnma
tion being issued y Jhe governor.
2. Webster defines !hi word "tram,
port" as follows: "Tj rarry or con
vey from one plaace to noUitr." Th.
legal definition is Jjiven in about llu
same words, as folios";.' : "To remove
to carry, or eocvv, f.-cu ot. placi
10 ar.'other; to carry, .(.ar er conve;
from one place or country to another,"
38 Cyc, 946. You will note that th.
definition given by these tw: uuthorl
ties is very broad, md lixei- no linii
talion. It has been held that the act
ot a station agent, who removed lie.
our Irom the platform where it wa.
unloaded by the train crew into th
freight room was a violation of th
law against transporting liquor. Slat
vs. Rhodes, 24 L. R. A.. 245. In tin
case of State vs. Pope, 00 S. E., 234
it was held "in a prosecution for trans
porting iVmtraband liquor, where the
defendant was found at the church
selling liquor from bottles in his pos
session, the presumption is that he
carried it there." The reasoning it
this case is that, a person having lio
our in his possession at an unusual
place carries with it the clear pre
sumption that he brought it there, anc.
therefore transported it. Again th
mere removal of liquor a distance 'ot
12 feet is held a violation of the law
prohibiting the transportation of in
toxicating liquor. On the other hand
it has-been held that, where the re
moval, of liquor is within a person':
domicile, and is only removed from
room to room, it is not a violation ot
a law prohibiting the transportation ol
aliquor, 1st Woolen & Thornton on in
toxicting Liquor, Sec. 219.
On examination of the authorities
is it by opinion that in o'-r.stniin the
word "transport," as iioed in the Pro
hibition Amendment, cue should h
governed more by the place and the
manner of transput tin tha'i b i.i.tc
distance, for instance, if a person wr"
upon a highway w tn liquor in his pos
session, that (ad alone would he suf
ficient, no matter how short a distance
the removal; while a man in U tit con
tinuously can .' a hoitl-.' ;.f lumor in
his pocket in hi- own dwelling house,
and not in violation of the law, on the
other hand, should he carry the same
botlle from his residence to his place
of business, a short distance away, the
act would come within the Prohibition
Amendment.
3. I'poti a careful reading of the
Amendment it is my opiiu'.m that it
was the intention of the people in
adopt iiio it to prohibit the transport
tng of intoxicating liquors within the
Stale and the prohibition applies to
all intoxicating' liquors w ithin the
State', no matter whvn brought In,
even though the liquor were possessed
pn'.ir to January 1. 1915. when the
original Amendment went into effect.
4. Your 4th question is praci ically
disposed ol in my answer to the hist
one. The law i'phihits the transpor
tation of intoxicating linu.ir. regard-

A ' J

flf! Confidential and careful treatment of all SInI
r n
would be a violation of the law.
5. In all cases where the liquor is
simply in possession of the holder, mid
no evidence of sale or transportation.
for the protection of yourself and your j
office I would say the wisest course!
i'or you to pursue would hi- to s:he
he persons having liqi.'or the benefit
of the doubt and take no action, ex-i
'ept in suspicious cases to be vigiiuut
.'or violation of the law. In the last
art of question No. 5, I presume you
.efer to liquor in your possession,
iiich has heed returned c.t the ow ner
y order of the Court. In that case
.ny removal of sa:n would be a vio- j
alion of the law, whether from the ;
ounty jail or any other place.
6. This goes back to the question j
jf interstate shipments, and the an- j
wer must depend, to a great extent, t
jpon the circumstances surrounding
ach shipment. It w'ould be impossi
ile to lay down an iron clad rule for'
our government in all. cases where.
.iquor may be claimed to be in transit
rom one state to another. It is my '
jpiniou that intoxicating liquors, j
.iiich are shipped from some other :
tate and are in transit to another
,tate, through the State "of Arizona.
iocs not come within the Prohibition
Amendment, so long as the liquor re-,
jains in the original package and Is
.n continuous transit. Continuous tran-1
iit, iu my opini'on, does not mean that
he liquor must be moving at all times (
jut so long as it remains absolutely ;
:n the hands of the transportation;
oinpany, or a common carrier, atidj
to effort is made to transfer it within
.his state, it remains under the pro
ection of interstate commerce. The 1
ihipmcut must be bona tide t'o come
vithin this protection, and shipments
uaile in an unusual ami expensive i
nanner should be looked upon w ith
suspicion, for instance, if a person
should have liquor in an automobile :
joining from New Mexico through
l.'ould claim that he was transporting
this county, and. upon being stoppeu,
.t to the State of California, or even
.nto the Republic of Mexico at
Oouglas or Naco, in my opinion, it
vould be your duty to arrest him and
cave it to the court and a jury to
av whether his claim was in good'
.aith. and he was entitled to the piV '
ice tion of the federal law . as it is not 1
reasonable that any person would jj
transfer a shipment of liquor lrom a;V
railroad running to the same point of jr
deliver, into an automobile to he
transported at a greater cost, loss of
time and ineoiiv cnienee.

I DOUGLAS. Jan. 25. Mining men
operating in Mexico complain of a re
I cent order of the Carranza govern
I ment fixing the value of Mexican sil
' ver as 1.80 pesos for one dollar Amer
I ican, superseding the former rate of
j exchange two pesos for one American
dollar. This rate applies to payments
of duties and wages, increasing both
by ten percent, it was claimed.
Under recent ruling duties and
wages must be paid in Mexican gold
or silver. No Mexican gold being ob
tainable, silver pqsos must be used.
This ruling was made by the Mexi
can government, officials admit, for
the purpose of taking advantage of
the high price of silver, as contained
in each peso. However,- Americans
affected claim that the government
(ruling has advanced an impossible
proposition: that, the Mexican gold
peso which is equivalent to the silver
one, has increased similarly in value,
although its actual value is a fraction
under fifty cents American money.
The real effect, they say, has been to
destroy the work of forty years by
removing the country from a gold to
a silver basis.

Shortening of the haul on ore and
shipments of bullion from the Ray

the Southern Pacific at Maricopa and
the giving of better service to Mesa

given for the proposed change. Un
der the present arrangement all

district moves by way of
Tempe, or about 20 miles farther than
would be necessary by the proposed

General Ulrich Wille.
Fearing that Switzerland is yet in
dancer of invasion by the forces
of the central powers, General Ulrich
Wille, commander of the Swiss army,
wishes to mobilize all the forces of
the mountain republic. The fedoval
council is said to rejrtrd such a mea.--u;t
us excessive and to have decided
to mobilize only the Second and
Filth divisions of the army. .

into both the House and the Senate,
asking congress to turn over to the
state Foil Whipple near Prescott, as
a location for a military institute,
along with 100,000 acres of land for
the equipment of il. As a good deal
of opposition was developed in both
houses emanating for the most part
from friends of the University, who
believe that the appropriating by the
government to that institution for mil
itary instruction would be diverted.
Honest Bill Favored
The "Printers' Ink" misleading ad
vertisement bill with added sections
prohibiting the advertisement of take
worthless mining stocks, was given
a favorable report by the whole com
mittee of the Senate. In the original
bill the valuation of it was described
bs a misdemeanor with no other pen
alty than that that attache? to mis
(iLineanors generally but the bill was
amended providing a special punish
ment for violators of from six months
to two years in the county jail, or a
fine of f'oui $100 to $1,000, or both. .
Would Bridge the Gila
Mr. Devine of Pinal county, brought
in a "cjil appropriating $30,000 for a
bridge across the Giia River near
Florence, the channel of the river hav
:ng lately abandoned the comparative
ly new bridge at that point.
Telegrams and communications
were received in the House from the
management and attorneys of he
Harvey Eating House system asking
to be heard on the McKay minimum
wage for women bill. The communi
cations stated thut there was no dis
satisfaction of the waitresses- of the
lystem with the wages now paid to
thein and that the enactment of the
bill into law would derange the sys
tem. The House voted a public hear
ing to he given next Monday morning
when labor representatives will also
be present in support of the bill.
No new bills were brought into the
House. Several are ready for intro
luction but it was stated that the le

able vet to conclude his investigation
of them.
SENATE DEMOCRATS
DISAGREE ON LEGISLATION
WASHINGTON. Jan. 2.",. Demo
crats of the Senate after a three hour
debate in caucus tonight ovr the
legislative program for the balance of
the session, found themselves in such
disagreement over measures that
should take precedence that the whole
subject was referred back to the steer
ing committee with instructions to
report to the caucus at a later date.
Water power legislation and the
corrimt practices bill were anions
the principal bones of contention, ma
ny senators declaring neither could
be passed by March 4.' The steering
committee will meet tomorrow.
The sense of the caucus seemed to
be that railroad legislation should be
passed and the bill to be reported
from the interstate commerce com
mittee probably will be given right ol
way for immediate consideration.

dormant specialties were almost al
together futile.
United Stales Steel and related is

Total sales of stocks, 425,0o0 shares.
Foreign exchange markets were
dull, when rates on the Teutonic cen
ters shaded after previous strength.
The recent improvement in marks

better dn better demand. The bond
market was without marked feature.

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. Jan. 25. British official
t'tterances that, were construed as ad
verse to an early peace gave the
wheat market an upward swing to
day, which, however, was not well
maintained. The market closed hea
vy Vi to V net higher with May at
1.84s to 1.S5 and July at 1.53 to
1.53. Corn held 5i to at lc gain
and oats finished 3 to at V up.
Latest figures on provisions varied
from-SVz decline to a rise of 40c.
Advance that in- some cases amount
ed to 2,,-s a bushel on wheat resulted
from the purchasing which was large
ly stimulated by the British chancel
lor's .speech at Bristol commenting
unfavorably on President Wilson's
plea for a peace without victory.
In the absence of any sign of im;
portant new business with Europe the
market in the last hour of trading
came very near to losing all the pre
ceding enhancement of values.
Active export buying hoisted the
corn market to a new high record not
equalled since the civil war. Oats
rose with corn.
Houses with eastern connections
wero free buyers of provisions despite
an upturn to the highest point of the
season.

There's a wonderful difference be
tween getting rid of a corn now and
the way they used to try to get rid
of it only four or five years ago.
"Gets-It has revolutionized corn
history. It's the only corn remedy
today that acts on the new prin
ciple, not only of shriveling up the
corn, but of loosening the corn off
so loose that you can lift It right off
with your fingers. Put 2 drops of
"Gets-It" on that corn 'or callus to
night. That's all. The corn is
doomed sure as sunrise. No pain, or
trouble, or soreness. You do away
once and for all with toe-bundling
bandages, toe-eating salves and irre
sponsible whatnots. Try it get sur-
j prised and lose a corn.

GERMAN SUBSTITUTES
MEET POWER'S NEEDS
DESPITE BLOCKADE
upon the inferior Bavarian graphite,
hut German chemists have been able
to find a process by which the Bav
arian article can be purified to a 97
per cent standard.
Rosin: Supplies of this had come
exclusively from America and France,
but German chemists have now he-
come able to produce all that is need
ed from the German forests, or are
able to use as a substitute for rosin
the by-products of wood and coal.
Textiles: Paper has been adapted
in innumerable instances to nerve for
cloth. By using protoxide of sodium,
sulphite cellulose anl paer, a very
durable and' satisfactory thread has
been evolved.' ."which,; in torn, lends
itself to the creation of sacks and
bars, girdles,' doijies, aprons, work
ing garments,! wra.fcin? ' cloth and
thread and string, the inventors have
discovered a way to 'give the "paper
cloth" great' resistance to dampness
Cellulose has been found to lend it
self to the production of gun cotton
when combined with other chemicals,
and nettles have proved themselves
to be the source of cotton matting,
thread, yarn, coloring matter and ev
mi fed Btuffs. Dresses and other
clothes are being manufactured out
of artificial cotton and wool, as they
sometimes were in peace times. Even
'the reeds that grow on the banks of
lakes and ponds are being used to
make artificial cloths. ' ...
Copper: Almost the only "unsub
stitutable substance has been cop
per, but there, has been found to be
nlenty of that on hand in German
industrial plants and elsewhere. In
place of the copper thus taken by the
government there have been installed
aluminum and zinc, out of which
wires and utensils of various sorts
have been fashioned, with perfect
success. In addition zinc has been
found to do just as well as copper
in the manufacture of a score of ar
ticles in everyday use, and is a good
substitute also for brass pnd bronze.
Ifon and steel also subeiitnte satis
factorily in dozens of other cases, and
are now largely used in installing ap
naratus of all kinds, in place of rub
ber, copper and brass. Zinc and alum
inum and zinced iron flad their use
now in switchboards and the like In
place of marble or slate.
Foodstuffs: Imitations have play
ed almost if not quite as large a part
as substitutes for foodstuffs of which
a shortage has been created by the
war. Many of the imitations are of
doubtful nutritious value, some M
theui have proved dangerous, but the
authorities have kept a watchful eye
on the situation and have promptly
put the ban on the bad imitations and
required the proper labelling of the
good ones. The grain supply of the

BERLIN (Correspondence of The
Associated Press) The extent to
which substitutes and imitations are
rampant in Germany today from one
of the most interesting subjects of the
now seasonable reviews. The'ersatz
the German word for substitutes
is now common not only in the line
of foodstuffs but in technical industry,
textiles and metals. Though from
time to time indiratfbns of this change
in German life have become known
abroad, there have lately appeared in i
teresting summaries which afford a
sharper focus 01! the situation. Some
of the items in this development, un
der their respective heads, are as fol
lows: Saltpeter: Before the war Germany
Imported annually over $40,000,000
worth of saltpeter for agricultural and
ammunitfbn purposes, mainly from
Chile, and all of this regular supply
was lost at the outset of the war. To
day countless factories in Germany are
manufacturing saltpeter, whereas be
fore the war there were only a few
experimental establishments, and Ger
many is now able not only to supply
the increased amount . of saltpeter
necessary for ammunition but also has
been able to furnish all that is neces
sary for fertilizers. '
Aluminum: Before the war the sup-1
ply of beuxite for the manufacture of '
aluminum had been imported from J
France, and the cutting off of this
supply led German scientists to dis-1
cover a process of aluminum manufac-;
ture by electricity from ordinary clay. I
Mineral Oils: Chemical experts in !
the German coal fields have discovered
new ways of extracting oils from ctoal,
partly relieving the serious condition J
resulting from the cutting off of min-:
era) oil imports which in 1913 amount I
ed to no less than J277.000.000. I
Rubber: Germany lost practically
all of her imports of rubber, and to ',
offset this shortage she has substituted '
steel for rubber in Innumerable cases
where rubber had been used purely
for its elasticity. Further, the per
fection of a submarine merchantshlp
made is possible to bring in enough
new rubber to mix with the old in the !
creation of a regenerated or synthetic ,
rubber. The supply of this has been
developed until now it Is said to be
sufficient to last for another eight
months.
Graphite: Ceylon was the exclusive ,
source of supply of graphite used in i
! Germany before the war, because the ;
Ceylon graphite was 99 per cent pure.
Since the beginning of the war Ger
many has been dependent entirely

When the c offee began to run short ;
its consumption was reduced, and !
Germany took recourse to admixtures 1
of chicory, roasted grain, so-called 1

which also is short and expensive,
has been gradually replaced by ex-'

its tastes somewhat and to be content
with brews that sre probably jn.-t as

THE MAN WITH' A THOUSAND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS
Win. S. Hart in "The Patriot"
HERE'S A HINT OF THE STORY
With the present crisis in Mexico and the ceaseless agitation for pre
paredness, the thesis of this story, which upholds the sentiment of
"America First" will attract considerable attention. The story re
volves about a red-Ilooded patriotic Yankee who settled on Govern
ment property. Through the machinations of some gamblers and the
connivance of land thieves his property is taken away from him. In
vain he tries to get Uncle Sam to help him. In a moment of revulsion
he curses his aggressors and his native land. He aligns himself with
the forces against it and organizes a band of Mexican outlaws. Just
as he is about to make an attack on an unprotected! American town,
he realizes that he is about to shed the blood of his own kin and blood.
The dying embers of his patriotic soul are rekindled.

NEW TAX ON AUTOS.
Basing of the tax on automobiles
n the weight of the car, strengthen
ing of the tax limit and budget laws,
and the placing of a small mill tax on
moneys and credits are among the
recommendations made by state tax
commission in its annual report,
which has just been transmitted to
the legislature. The commission rec
smmeuds among other reforms that
the tax roll be simplified, that the law
providing for a specific tax on express
companies be repealed and that the
tax commission be allowed to tax
them on a mileage basis, and that the
inheritance law be administered by
the tax commission. Consolidation of
the offices of county and city asses
sors and tax collectors is recommend
ed, it being suggested by the commis
sion that the county assessor perform
this work in incorporated towns and
cities. There are only 25 Incorporat
ed towns and cities in the state, and
the work could be done by the county
assessors, the commission declares.
