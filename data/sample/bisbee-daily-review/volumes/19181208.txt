WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Further
chapters in the story of the efforts
of Count von Bernstorff, the form
er German ambassador and other
German agents to Influence senti
ment in America toward Germany
and to prevent the shipment of war
supplies to the allies were revealed
in documents laid before the sen
ate investigating committee today
by A. Bruce Bielaski of the depart
ment of justice. .
"Wreck of the propaganda fiystem
built up by Bernard, Dernberg, the
kaiser's personal agent in the United
States, by the sinking of the Lusi
tania, and the rebuilding of it by von
Bernstorff, in a manner which, "can
not hurt us if it becomes kr-own,"
3lso were dealt with in communica
tions from the former ambassador to
the Berlin foreign office.
About Embargo Activity
There also was evidence relating to
the organization in 1915 and subse
quent activities of the American em
bargo asosciation with the hope of
stopping shipments of war supplies
to the allies by so arousing feeling
among the voters as to compel legis
lative action. One of the communica
tions offered by Mr. Bielaski and pur
porting to have been written by P;
Reiswitz, German consul at Chicago,
dealt, with a mass meeting of the as

that among those who had "agreed to

QUARANTINE WILL BE

CITIZENS OF THE DISTRICT ARE
ASKED TO ASSIST IN PREVENT

HERETOFORE PUBLISHED
At a meeting held yesterday after
noon by the physicians of the district
and attended by the acting city health
officer, Dr. Bryant, and the county
health officer. Dr. C. H. Hunt, it was
decided to lift the influenza quaran
tine Monday morning.
The "lid" will be lifted on every
thing except dances. This means that
the public schools, churches, pool
ha'ls and soft drink establishments
will be allowed to open and resume
business as was customary befiVe the
quarantine was put on.
Thero still are a few cases of in
fluenza in the district and others are'
reported every day, but the number
is small. A number of cases have i
been brought here from Texas during
the oast week. If this continues it 1
may mean that the officers will take
steps to place some one at Ooborn to
examine persons as they are about
to enter the district.
The doctors feel, as do the physi
cians In other places, that there are'
bound to be cases of the disease I
throughout the Winter, but they hope1
to keep the number down to a mini
mum. To do this will require the
assistance of the citizens of the War-

WASHINGTON, Dec. 7 (By Wireless
to the Associated Press). At the
present rate or speed President Wil
son will not land at Brest before Fri
day. He probably will reach Paris I
Saturday. His conference with the
French statesmen is expected to begin
promptly Tuesday, after an exchange
of official visits. It was expected
that the Azores will be passed tomor
row, but the George Washington and
her convoy of warships are plowing
through one squall after anTther,
which are heavy for the southern
course. As a consequence the Azores
will not be reached before Tuesday.
The Pennsylvania is steaming morej
than a mile ahead or the president s
ship. The destroyers which make up
the remainder of the convoy of ten,
are hidden from sight in the valleys
between the great rollers which are
washing them so frequently that the
crews scarcely can cling to the decks.
The George Washington, however,
is keeping a comparatlvtdy steady
course in the heavy sea and none of
the official party has been seasick
thus far. The president took a con
stitutional on deck after his morning
work, after which he again took part
in a boat drill and then retired to
his suite for a nap.
NEW "WHITE HOUSE"
(By Review leased Wire)
PARIS, Dec. 7. The town house of
Prince and PrinceBs Joachim Murat,
placed at the disposal of President
and Mrs. Wilson, during their stay In
Paris, at the request of the govern
ment, will soon be completely reno
vated and ready to receive the Amer
ican chief executive and his wife.
The Rue de Monceau, In which the
house is located, while one of the
most fashionable neighborhoods of
Paris, contains all sorts of houses.
Adjoining the Murat house, on the
right, is the Ste Marie institution, a
large school for children, consisting
of many buildings and a playground.
Across the street, lives a woman art
ist and a doctor, and there & group
of offices and a butcher store. On
the corner, there is the familiar little
French cafe, with a fer iron tables
and chairs on the sidewalk In front,
where signs announce that wine and
beer are for sale. ,
Although the Murat mansion is rap
idly becoming known as "La Malson
Blanche de Paris" it Is not white,
but a dull brown tint. The house It
self is hidden from the street by a
stone wall, ten feet high, in which
there are two narrow wooden gates
and, in the center, a big double door
for vehicles.
Inside the gates is a large graveled
space. Here the guard of honor will
be stationed. A low ornamental iron
fence on the side, away from the
school, separates the court from the
spacious grounds and gardens stretch
ing away for half a block and en
closed by a stone wall, giving com
plete privacy.
Broad gravelled walks wind through
green lawns under trees of great size.
A stroll around the gardens gives a
view of elaborate conservatories at
the rear of the house. At the pear
also, are the servants quarters, the
garage and other outbuildings which
are reached by a passage way under
the house, at the side nearest the
school. '

(Bv Review Insed Wire)
NEW YORK. Dec. 7. A denial that
he had ever served as agent, counsel,
or in any capacity in the interests of
the German government, was issued
here tonight by Samuel Untermyer,
who asserted that his suggestion in
1916 to Dr.' Heinrich Albert, commer
cial attache of the German embassy,
that the latter acquire an interest in
a New York newspaper was a purely
personal negotiation.
As tar. back as 1911, Mr. Untermyer
said, he and a group of friends had
considered acquiring control of a
metropolitan journal and Dr. Albert
bad shown interest in the project.
When au apparent opportunity to car
ry out the plan developed, Mr. Unter
myer stated, he oiiered the German
attache a minor interest. Though up
holding the propriety of any lawyer
serving as a legal counsellor to the
German government in this country
while the United States was neutral,
Mr. Untermyer stated that he had re
peatedly refused to perform profes
sional services for Ambassador von
Bernstorff and his associates. He told
the Germans, he added, that he was
under obligations to the British peo
ple, many of whose interests he had
represented in this country, for a long
period of years.
Dr. Win. Bayard Hale issued a form
al statement tonight denying that he
had received funds from the German
government while he was serving in
Berlin ab special correspondent of the
New York American.,
"The statement," said Dr. Hale, "by
whomsoever raude, that while in the
employ of the New York American I
ever received one penny from the Ger
man government, or from anybody
connected with the German govern
ment, directly or indirectly, is false. ,
"The allegation that the German i
government or anybody with the Ger
man government, directly-or indirect
ly, contributed one cent toward the
payment of my expenses in Berlin is
false."
M'LEAN ENTERS PROTEST
WASHINGTON, Dec. 7. Edward B.
McLean, editor-president of the 'Wash

statement regarding the evidence in
troduced before the senate commit
tee investigating brewers activities.
"Mr. Bielaski, in his testimony be-
fore the senate committee Quoted a
despatch from former Ambassador von .
Bernstorff, in which the statement is
made that my father, the late John R. j
McLean, offered to sell or rent the
Washington Post to the German gov-1
ernment. This is another or von Bern-
storrrs infamous lies. The Post was
never offered to him for sale or hire.
"My father purchased the Washing
ton Post for me. He managed it in
my interest If any proposition had
been on foot to sell the paper, or run
it by handing it over to any special
interests, I would have known it.
"Von Bernstorff was anxious to put
through anything that would help his
government. He often lied to bis gov
ernment and be was often fooled by

of the German propaganda.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, .Dec. 7. Reaction
from war economy is apparent in re
ports to various government agencies
since the signing of the armistice.
War savings committees in all parts
of the country have submitted state
ments tending to show that persons
who abstained from buying unneces
sary clothes during the war have rush
ed to shops within the past week or
two and bought according to pre-war
standards.
. Retail businesses report stimulation
of business by peace news. In some
cases, the response was immediate,
business showing a big Jump within a
day or two after November 11. This
reaction seems most marked among
the wealthier -classes. .'.,.
Reports gathered by the federal re
serve board also show activity among
wholesale houses to meet the demand
of retailers. The wholesale business,
however, is somewhat restricted by
the desire of retail merchants to let
their stocks run low, while waiting
for prices to come down. Thousands
of retailers quickly arranged special
sales of their stocks at lower prices,
in view of the uncertainties of the
future course of prices.
Building opeiations have taken a
sudden start after the long entorced
period of sluggishness during the wa,
and building materials are now begin
ning to flow away from former war
enterprises, toward peace time build
ing projects. Private building seems
to be holdng back, however. Munici
palities and states have turned their
thoughts to building roads and bridges
held up during the war by shortage of
materials, and within the next month
officials here look for a multitude of
' advertisements for bids for these pro
jects. At least $8,000,000,000 must be
raised in the United States next year
from war bonds or war savings. Of
ficials argue that floating of these
loans without corresponding savings
in money and materials merely serves
to inflate credit, and the practical re
sult of this inflation is a general rise
n prces.
The treasury now is seeking tp de
velop means of continuing thrift

years, to educate the publie to the

spondence of the Associated Press.)
The German plot to incite Mexico and
Japan to war against the United
States originated with Herr Von
Chemmitz. who bore the title of lega
tion counselor and was employed in
a subordinate capacity in the German
foreign ofice. it is now asserted.
This is disclosed by Professor Bonn,
rector of the Commercial academy at
Munich, Bavaria, according to the
Munich Nachrichten.
"Von Chemnitz," says the Munich
newspaper, "imagined himself an au
thority on ljitin-Amerlcan affairs and
suggested the scheme to Dr. Albert
Zimmermann, then German secretary
for foreign affairs. Zimmermann dis
cussed it with other foreign office offi
cial, but they thought ft unfeasible.
"Zimmermann kept the matter in
mind. Presently, Von Chemnitz came
and told him that the next few days
an especially reliable messenger would
leave for, Mexico4kto whom the mes
sage could safely be entrusted, and
that it was a matter of now or never.
"Zimmermann allowed . himself tc
be over-persuaded ; and so the fatal
step waa taken." .
- Dr. Albert Zimmermann on January
19, 1917, directed the German min
ister. Von Eckhardt, at Mexico City,
to propose au alliance between Ger
many, Mexico and Japan, to take ef
fect as soon as it was certain there
would be war between" the United
States and Germany. The German
minister was directed to urge Presi
dent Carranza of Mexico to ask
Japan's adherence to this scheme.
Zimmermann proposed that Mexico
should "reconquer the lost territory
of New Mexico, Texas and Arizona."
The German plot was made public
by the United States government in
February. 1917. Its disclosure was
one of the startling incidents which
preceded America's entrance into the
war.
Prof. Moritz J. Bonn, director of
the Commercial high school at Mu
nich, was lecturing in the United
States on German history and defined
German war aims in addresses deliv
ered here before the United States
became a belligerent.
YANKEE TALK MADE
HIT WITH DOUGHBOY
PARIS, Nov. 7. He was spluttering
with the helpless indignation of the
man who wants to tell folks what he
thinks of them and can't pronounce
the words, when he came into the
V. M.' C. A. headquarters. The
gendarmes with ferocious moustaches
and friendly eyes shepherded him
into the room.
"L'Americaine!" they announced,
simply, and turned away with the air
of those who have done their duty.
They had learned that the Y. M. C. A.
would always look after the Ameri
can soldier in France.
"What's : the matter?" asked the
secretary.
"Matter? There ain't anything the
matter with me!" said the American
soldier, angrily. "You better ask
them policemen what's the matter
with them. Say, they couldn't hold
down a job ten minutes in New York!
They can't even talk Just make
noises."
"What did you want to talk to them
about?" inquired the Y. M. C. A. man.
"Oh, I just want to ask the way
back to the station, that's all. I left
my ritle and my pack in the corner
and came up to see Paris. Now I got
to go back to catch my train."
"Where do you live back home?"
askc.1 the. Y. M. C. A. man.
"I'll just telephone and find out
where yo:i left your rifle and your
pack.'" said the Y. M. C. A. man. A
few minutes later he was ready v ith I
the desired information, and with di-'
rectlofs for getting "back to the sta-j
lion."
"Thanks." said the Ainerian boy. I
I sure am much ohliye't. Hut. say.
DISPUTED ZONE OF
"'GREAT CHACO HAS

INFLUX OF AMERICAN CAPITAL
INTO STRIP BETWEEN BOLIVA
AND PARAGUAY BRINGS WORLD
TO REALIZATION OF INFINITE
WEALTH OF REGION
LA PAZ, Bolivia. Nov. 7. (Corre
spondence of the Associated Press.)
Influx of American capital into the
central republics of South America
for the development of vast areas of
hitherto untouched resources has
caused Bolivia and Paraguay to
awaken to a realization of the posis
bilities that lie in the disputed zone
which is known as the Great Chaco.
The boundary line between these
two republics never has been fixed
definitely because of the wilduess of
the country, but both nations have
been satisfied with going on record
as claiming all the zone and then go
ing about their daily business without
forcing the issue.
But now that gruat development
companies from the United States are
seeking concessions, the newspapers
and public men are urging that the
old question be brought up for final i
settlement.
The Great Chaco is a vast area
north of Argentina betweeu the Pil- j
comayl tnd Paraguay rivers. It is !
claimed by both Bolivia aud Paraguay,
though both admit that their claims ;
are so large that they will have to
give up large areas in the linal reck-
on ui g. ;
For several years Bolivia, has been
preparing quietly for the day of fiual
settlement, so that it is now in a po
sition to press the issue to advantage.
That country has constructed a chaiu
of torts at intervals of i'O miles, in
direct wirele.ss communication with
La Paz, put its army in possession of
the strip aud settled bacK to wait for
the argument which now appears to
be approaching.

T k E R E IS ONE THING ABOUT THE FAIR STORE, says a woman, "ir you read something In the store news and then go and buy
It. you always find it comes up to expectations when you get home." Of course It does. The store holds its special place in this com
munity because of the hundreds of friends it has made and keeps, and the way it makes frtends isn't to fool them on something they have
paid out their money for. As the Chriitmas season draws on. it is well tc remember these things and to depend upon the store that you
know , by experience is dependable. A great deal of the Christmas shopping is done in a rush. There isn't time to think over things and
to make comparisons as carefully as you might at other seasons. So it is the every-day-ln-the-year dependable store that is the safest to pin
faith to at this season.

Soldiers Acclaim Ebert As
President of Germany and
Cheer for New Republic
(By Review leased Wire)
COPENHAGEN, Deo. 7 The "Ger
man republic and lier fJrst president,
Comrade Ebert," have been hailed by
an organized demonstration of sol
diers and sailors at Berlin. The
Wolff bureau, the semi-official news
agency, thus describes the incident:
"On Friday evening soldiers and
sailors armed with rifles demonstrat
ed before the chancellor's palace.
Their leaders spoke as follows:
"Germany stands on the brink of
a catatrophe. We demand that a na
tional assembly be summoned on De
cember 20. The executive council
must no longer be able to put pres
sure on the government. Long live
the German republic and her first
president. Comrade Ebert.' "
Chancellor Kbert replied that the
administration must remain in the
hand of the go eminent. He coun
seled patience until the congress of
the workmen and soldiers' councils
had decided regarding the convoca
tion of a national assembly.
A sailor from Kiel spoke up: 'i
will put a straight question, whether
Comrade Ebert will agree to our se
lection of, him as president of the
German yepuoncT
The chancellor replied: 'N"ot with
out conferring with the government."
The scftdiers and sailors then
marched away.

And bless each place of rest;
And bless the door that opens wide

And every sturdy wall.

The peace of love in all!
And still Lenine and Trotzky hold to
the shreds, of their power in motheaten,
threadbare, ragged Russia. What an irony
that Russia, the first to quit fighting the
Hun, should be the last to quit yghting the
allies her former allies. The war is oyer,
yes, in a way, but the war will never be
really over and well over until Lenine and
Trotzky have been hung for, their crimes
and the bolshevik driven from power in
Russia. '
The High Cost of Living
While the war is over and the strain of
intense preparation somewhat relaxed and
the enormous expenses of the government
greatly reduced and all the undesirable
kings dethroned and the gnawing of the
submarines at the world's commerce done
away with, yet there still remains an auto
crat, stern and harassing, with whom all of
us must still deal. It is the high cost of
living. That old and worn and brass-bound
excuse, "the war has raised the price' can
no longer be used by manufacturer, whole
saler, jobber, commission merchant, farmer
and retailer, yet the man in town working
for a salary, is still paying war prices' for
'necessities and comforts, as well as lux
uries. We cast about for some one upon
whom to lay the blame and we find the
profiteer and the politician, and so we lay
it upon both of them. And one cannot be
far off the mark when he lays the blame
upon these gentry. Their greed and their
duplicity have become by-words. And yet
we ourselves are not altogether free from
blame and blemish in the matter of the
high and still increasing cost of most things
that we must eat arid use and wear.
Consider well the old days of low prices
of everything, and low wages for labor. In
those days the average man and hi3 family
were content to live "much more simply
than they are now. Luxuries then were
only for the rich and comforts and conveni
ences for the well to do. People working
for moderate wages had only the necessities
of life, with a comfort and a luxury and a
good time or two every few" weeks. They
. saved up for an occasional outing or piece
of finery or big meal.
But in these days' the average man and
his family must live like the best. They
must have a nice home, beautifully- furn
ished and a car and fine clothes and expens
ive foods and trips and all the pleasures
and expenses that only the rich could have
in the old days. And this is all right. It is
a queer or mean man who will not have the
best he can for himself and his family. He
works hard and he is surely entitled to play
and also to enjoy the fruits of his labor.
But, this demand upon every hand for
nice things and for pleasures has steadily
increased the cost of things. The simple
life and economies and plain clothes and
quiet habits of living of a few years ago are
unknown now, except among the very poor
people and the most improvident or unfor
tunate classes. As the price of fancy foods
and silks and housefurnishings and fine
shoes and clothes and pleasures rnount
. higher ,the men and women in most mod
erate circumstances think they must still
have them and they buy and buy and take
no thought of tomorrow. Good times and
good wages have turned our heads and we
buy every day beyond our means. Milady
of millions and the typist maid on fifteen
dollars a week buy the same shoes at ten
or fifteen dollars a pair. The boy of today
spends foolishly much more than the boy
of the old days could earn for both neces
sities and luxuries. The average man must
dig up fifty dollars for his wife's clcak or
dress and another fifty for his garage and
pay also as much for fancy as he does for
plain groceries. He has the habit and so
has his family. Ben Franklin's wise advice
to save at least one-sixth, if not one-fourth,
of his income, which was heeded by so
many sensible men of moderate means and
earning capacity in the old days, is heeded
by but few now.
The price of everything in the markets
of the world is governed by an inexorable
law of supply and demand. A dull market
means a drop in prices as sure as the dusk
follows the day. But we spend and spend,
and thus keep the market lively and high.
Of course he war brought about high
prices in everythig. European competitors
turned their hand from production to de
struction. . Submarines . destroyed thou
sands of cargoes of merchandise. Produc
tion decreased and demand continued.
But litle change can be expected for at least
six months after the fighting ended. But
there is sure to be a downward trend next
year. And its extent will be determined in
no small measure by ourselves. We should
use more common sense and less silly pride
in the market places. Economy and self-de
nial are irresistibla weapons against the
high cost of living. And we should watch
for the profiteer, too, and we should spur
the politician on to fight the profiteer for
us. The politician is our servant and pub
lic opinion can force him to act and thus
keep the profiteer from becoming too bold.
Our eovernment has ddne much lately to
regulate prices and protect us from those
pirates who fatten upon necessities of life.
It should continue to do as much or more
in these first days of peace. And we should
study conditions and talk and write and in
sist that this be done. But in the matter
r t . 1 I
or luxunes we can protect ourselves Dy
not rushing in to buy at any price.
More important to the average man even
than the peace conference or the changes of
r.i ii .1 i rn l:
me woria maps or ine rise aiiu iaii ui wugii
or the governmental control problem, is this
matter of the high cost of living. County,
state and national officials should study it.
Economists and statisticians should work
on it. Politicians should tight it. And the
average man himself should do his own
part,he and his household also, to hammer
prices down to some just and reasonable
basis. It is a mighty and many sided prob
lem. This autocrat is still seated firmly
upon his throne and the entire world pays
him tribute.
About the State
Newspaper correspondents with the
armies of, occupation all write in the same
vein of the German reception of these vic
torious troops. And a study of these writ
ings strengthen the belief that the boche
was not beaten badly enough before the
armistice was signed. He is sullen still, if
not full of pride. He is far from chastened.
He looks and acts and seems to feel that
he was the victim of circumstances and un
kindly fortune and not the loser on the field
of battle. Only a fight to a finish in the
field could have taken it all out of Fritz.
He is dangerous still, and with his kaiser
still at large and full pf plots, and his gov
ernment in a chaos, Fritz is still a danger
ous and uncertain animal. Anything may
yet happen in Europe. Since the world
cooled there has never been such a mixup
and such uncertainty on the stage of the
world's affairs. Already the Poles and
Slavs are quarreling. The Bohemains are
mobilizing. The Austrians are running
amuck. The Russian bolshevik are still
under arms. In fact, there is peace and
order in Europe only so far a3 the gleam
from the allied bayonets may be thrown
into the eyes of these motley throngs. As
fighters the allied soldiers seem to be done
with their task for the present, but they
will be the busiest policemen that any riot
ever called from the station house for the
next year or so.

Prescott: There has been delay in
construction of the 30 new buildings
of the $2,000,000,010 hospital plant at
Whiprle barracks, mainly for the lack
of common labor. Heretofore there
has been allowance of only $2.40 a day
far such labor, a rate below what
laborers could earn in the nearby
mines. Now authority has been re
ceived from Washington to pay $3 a
day, a rate at which it is believed
tnero will be an influx of labor. It
is expected that the greater part of
the present contract will be complet
ed in the spring. '
Phoenix: The annual meeting of the
National Mchair association is being
held in Phoenix today. Among those
attending are the association's presi
dent, U. S. Grant of Dallas, Tex.; Sec
ond Vice-President H. A. Morgan of
Willcox. Ariz.; Secretary F. O. Land

ber of Arizona, New Mexico and
Texas Ar.gora goat raisers. Tfcs meet
ing was scheduled here in the expec
tation that the state fair would be in
progress, with a good exhibit of

influenza epidemic has kept away a
large number oi members who other
wise would have attended.

perman crawled to his bed, and Doc
Brandon came with cheerful grin to
press his pulse and test his temper
ature. ,
' Uiu." said the doc In his happy lit
tle way, "two degrees of fever; not
bad at ail. I d better give you a shot
to keep the pneumonia bugs away."
And he did.
The newspaper man lay there in the
darkened room and tossed with the
fever and enrsed the pains in his back
and head and wondered why so many
rough dark places are set along the
way of this pilgrim journey. Well, aft
er about an hour or two his arm began
to hurt. And then he remembered
that the doc had imparted to" him the
information that there were six mil
lion friendly and preventative germs
in that procession that had entered
his left arm. "And each one of them
will multiply," had said the dec, "so
that in an hour or twe you will have
six billion germs fighting on your side
against the 'flu' bugs."
This was encouraging, and tile
newspaper man felt that he needed at
least that many fighters to help him,
And he felt., too, that these friendly
germs had already begun the battle,
The pains in his arm were many and
every time he moved it the pains, like
the germs, multiplied
After awhile he fell into a troubled
slumber, half awake and half asleep;
sunlight and shadow on the field of
life. And tiien it was given him to
witness a greater and more deadly
battle than any of the Great War. Ver
dun, the Marne. Ypres, Cambrai, these
ensanguined and immortal fields were
mere skirmishes In comparison to the
ferocity and slaughter of this battle
of the germs. The first thing those
six- million white ' warriors did after
they debouched in the principal vein
of the newspaper man's left arm was
to form up In companies and advance
fearlessly right into the enemy's ter
ritory in the shoulder and left breast
They went over the top without wait
lmr for artillery support. About ten
million black germs advanced to meet
them and the carnage was something
he had been a sufferer the past year.
The deceased was born July 1, 1S42,
under the flag of the French consulate
on the Isle of Cuba. His father was
Peter Redewill. bom in Bordeaux and
Frances Redewill of Lyons, France.
He was educated in Boston. When
17 vears old, his parents moved to
California and he became associated
w ith his father in business at Tjtock
ton. Shortly before his marriage in
ls7S, he went into the piano business
aud traveled extensively throughout
tne northwestern states. He was also
interested in mining until crm.ing lo
Arizona.
Ajo: The success of the co-operative
store idea in this camp was made
evident by a pre-Christmas order just
issued for the payment of $41,000 in
dividends to the patrons of the New
Cornelia company's mercantile estab
lishment. These patrons are employes
of the mining corporation, numbering
743, out of a total of 900 employed.
The average check received will be
above $30. This dividend covers a
whole year of business. Last year's
saving, covering eight months of ope
ration, was about $15,000. The com
pany officials speak warmly in praise
of the loyalty of the men during the
past couple of months, where the
works at times were kept in operation
with only half a force, doing almost
double work per man.
Jerome: Among traveling men es
pecially there is bitter complaint that
trunks are opened by force, if keys
are not effective, in a search by train
men for liquor, assumed to be a part
of the contents 'of about every trunk
or grip that comes into Arizona from
New Mexico or California. It is told
that not only is liquor taken, but arti
cles of clothing and other valuables
are in the lout. Several traveling men
announce their intention of making
their next trip with bottles of whisky
that have been "denatured" with prus
sic acid, and have asked that all train
men be advised. The alleged looting
is said to he based upon the fact that
the transportation of liquor into Ari
zona is a felony, both under national
and state laws, so the victims merely
will get into trouble If they complain
of the thieves are arrested. On this
account, also, no formal complaints
have been lodged with the railroad
ma nagements.
Tucson: Lt. M. J. C.otthelff of the
medical corps of the army, now in
camp, will probably be appointed
county physician of Pima county, ef
fective January 1. if he is mustered
out of service by that time, according
to a report circulated yesterday, but
not confirmed. At a conference yes
terday between Dr. W. A. Baker, hold

The friendly germs fought lika the
Roman legionaries of old, in close
formation jind with perfect discipline,
using the short sword for attack and
thuftiMall round shield fc-r defense.
They, hewed their way against odds
into the enemy positions and routed
them, killing the wounded as they
moved up to and took possession of a
fortress in the lobe of the left lung.
But the black germs although
beaten were not broken. They re
treated fighting stubbornly, and pret
ty soon reinforcements came up by
the millions and they drove the friend
ly germs back to the shoulder. Then
the artillery came into action. The
wheels of the cannon had flanges that
stood out like the cogs on an English
tank and they used the nerves in the
newspaper man's arm for roads and
the muscles for gun platforms. The
game little general of the friendly
germ forces drew his sword and
stuck the point of It about a foot into
a long muscle and said he would die
on this spot. In the meantime the
white germs also received reinforce
ments. These came in endless col
umns, each germ carrying a small rifle
with an enormous sabre bayonet fas
tened to its muzzle. They struck the
myriad black formations like a storm
wave and stabbed and thrust and cut
their way right through the center.
advancing and taking the third line
positions where they dug in. But the
wings of the black army closed in on
them and killed them to a germ.
Then,tb,e white general, seeing that
courage availed not against such num
bers, resorted to strategy. He pound
ed the enemy troop concentrations in
the center with heavy artillery fire
and started the action over again with
a terrible drive on the extreme right.
Both sides were reinforced by mil
lions upon millions of fresh warriors
and no quarter was asked or given,
lt was noticeable that while the blacks
were the larger and stronger, the
ment in ranka the white armies ad
vanced as one man all along the line
and swept their black enemas away
in broken clouds, upon the edges of
which the wljite hosts continued the
merciless slaughter.
The fierce little while general with
drew his sword from the muscle
wherein ne had buried It In brave
despair earlier in th battle and
waved it over his head'and pranced
forward to direct the army of occupa
tion. And the twinge that followed
the withdrawn blade awakened the
newspaper man entirely. He stared
about him wildly for a moment, seeing
still in his disordered and feverish
fancy, the red battlefield and the ad
vancing white lines of the friendly
germs. He even weakly cheered that
fierce little white captain. And then
he laughed foolishly and gave a poor
excuse to his wife for that ill timed
cackle.
Old Doc Brandon came with the
light of the new day and thrust his
thermometer into the newspaper
man's mouth. "You're better." he said,
cheerfully; "temperature about gone
and pulse normal. Better stay In bed,
though."
Yes, the friendly germs had won a
great victory over the unfriendly
germs in that terrible battle vision.
It was not all a dream.
A PRINCESS AMONG
WAR WORKERS
Many and fine are tho war workers
in the Warren district. The newspa
per man has seen all of them; seen
them in grand review marching on
the street, seen them at post of duty
and in the trenches and going over
the top when they stormed his den
without hesitation or hindrance. He
has seen them- working in the summer
heat and the winter rain. Seen them
on outpost duty and under heavy ar
tillery fiie and digging in to hold the
line. No finer war workers in the
world than these. In Rod Cross room,
in active campaign and in council, he
has seen aud admired and wondered
at such resolute effort and undimmed
enthusiasm. But the other day it was
hi.i lot to see a real Princess Pat
among the workeis tor the war. And
this was Miss Jeanette Newman, one
of the Liberty Girls, on her mission
of selling the cunning and charming
little woven wool and silk mascots she
had made to raise her self-allotted
share of money for war work.
Ycu see, Jeanette has adopted a lit
tle French orphan girl, and tRis tiny
ma'amselle sent to her godmother
from far-off France one of these lit
tle mascots, which is hung about the
neck by a cord and is worn by the
French kiddies now as a mascot and
also as a token of the re-born glory
of France. Jeanette hung the French
favor about her neck and. while she
fingered the fuzzy little poilu at its
end, she became possessed with the
idea of making them, too, and telling
them to raise her portion of $10 as a
Victory Girl. "We changed our front
room into a factory," said Jeanette
simply to the newspaper man, and
surely we have had fine success in
making and selling the little French
favors for the great American wars
work. I changed my goal from $10 to
$50, and I have nearly reached It
now.
Jeanette gave the newspaper man
one of the mascots she had made and
he will keep it always and treasure it
highly, for is it not a token from
small, fair hands to tell how brave and
how helpful the American girls have
been all through this terrible war!
And then, too, it is a decoration, com
ing from this most successful young
war worker: a token she had direct
from her orphan in France. It is a
French decoration, not as heroic a-
the Croix do Guerre or the Legion de
Ilonneur, of course, but a decoration,
nevertheless, and with more than a
little of sacrifice and of accomplish-

Poet's Corner
MOONLIGHT ON THE DESERT.
. a
Tonight the moon lights all the desert
sand;
There is no sleep just waking
dreams for me;
Ami far I see the dim cold mountains
stand
Robed sentries, watching by this
desert sea.
Yet nearer now, close on the desert's
rim,
Red walls of rock stretch onward
with the plain;
There in the moonlight, and the
shadows dim
Weird forms are theirs, of castle,
tower and fame.
Last night I saw them by the setting
sun
Celestial, most they seemed close to
the sky; ,
The' twilight came, and walls and
towers were gone.
Mist and the moonlight veiled them
suddeiuv.
Above the rumbling of the flying
train
The lonesome coyote's voice I seem
to hear;
There is hot on the land nor any main
A cry so desolate, a sound so dsear
The clustering sagebrush in the moon
light seem
Gray-coated fairies bidding us to
stand
And share with them the desert's lure
and dream.
Or dance with them upon the desert
sand. '
Three things I love beyond all things
on earth;
The purrle mountains, and thj gray
old sea.
And the lone desert; since Creation's
birth,
Somehow, they speak of God's
Infinity.
So, in the stillness of the desert night.
With yonder moon upon the desert
sea,
I watch the stars slide downward out
of sight.
And th6ugh alone, I have great
company.
Yet wert thou w-ith ' me in these
silences.
Where night and desert seem as
things divine,
Twere like a dream of some sweet
blessedness, v
And doubled joys this summer night
were mine.

MY OLD PARO.
My old pard said good-bje to me
And sailed away across the sea;
He came not back for many a year.
And yet I felt him always near
Could hear his voice, could touch hU
hand
And hear' him say, "I understand.
And then one day across the sea
My dear old pard came back to me;
He did not grab me by the hand
And tell me tales of that far land;
We smiled and -walked along the way
As if we'd never missed a day.
My old pard said good-bye to me
And sailed away across Death's sea
And still we wander, side by side.
With never a thought death can di
vide I hear his voice, I touch his band,
I heard him say, "I understand."
And some day. by the twilight's rim,
I shall come softly up to him
And say some casual word that he
Was just about to say to me;
And we'll go walking down the way
As if we'd never missed a day.

To State Highway Departments.
In view of the fact that restrictions
on highway work have been removed
by tiie action of the War Industries
board, the fuel administration, the
railroad administration and the
United States Highways council, a
great revival in road building should
result. In my judgment, no more ef
fective means of insuring employment,
particularly to unskilled labor, in the
transition period from war to peace
can be devised than the vigorous
prosecution of all public improvement
work. I believe it would be better to
go ahead with road work wherever it
is needed rather than to wait for a
nortnA nt inffpr nrices. The benefits
of improved highways are Immediate,
to say nothing of the great desirabil
ity of having all labor employed and
Federal aid funds already available
and those Which will be made avail

$50,000,000, of which amount not over
$5,000,000 has been expended. It is
quite probable, therefore, that state

$100,000,000. This should constitute

General Quote. Law.
The estimate as to the possibility
that all except regular divisions will
have been withdrawn from France by
mid summer is based on General
March's reply to a question as to steps
necessary to obtain an extension of
the enlistment period for men in the
armv of occupation.
"The law about the men who were
raised in the national army is that
they must be discharged four months
after the declaration of peace," he
said. "That, I think also was ex
tended to include men who made vol
untary enlistments in the regular
army. I won't have any difficulty in
bringing back from France the so
called national army divisions in four
months after the declaration of peace.
It is entirely possible that we will
ask congress for some modification of
the law to provide a longer period for
the units which will remain in Eu
rope." Those Now Designated.
A total of 5325 officers and 125,515
men. General March said, have been
specifically assigned for early return
by General Pershing. Included in the
additional units reported today are
1426 officers and 29.3S1 men, the larg
est organizations mentioned being the
field artillery brigades of the Sth
(regular) and 92nd (national army
negro) divisions, and the 345th and
346th infantry regiments from the
87th (national army) division. The
remainder of the list consists largely
of motor repair units and auxiliary
divisional troops.
The 346th infantry is numerically
the largest unit yet ordered home,
showing 77 officers and 3182 men,
while the 345th, with K officers and
734 men, has apparently been stripped
by replacement drafts.- The full
strength of an infantry reglmtnt is
approximately 3600 men.
Demobilization at Home.
Discussing demobilization of the
forces at home. General March said.
rnlliEp rmn other than those in offi-
leer's schools which were being aban
doned would receive no preference as
to the time of their discharge. The
order of demobilization providing that
the combat divisions be disbanded
last, lie said, has not been altered.
"The system is working at a very
much greater speed." General March
said, referring to demobilization, '"and
I have originated a system by which
I get a daily record as to officers and
a weekly record as to enlisted men.
The actual number of officers dis-
j charged at the time of the last an
nounced was 113: the number dis
! charged last week, up to yesterday;

I charged in the United States last

The Bernstorl'f communication to

has been of no use during the war,
on account of its management. The
league has published under my col

reports on the war which will be of
great service to our cause.
The support which. I have already
giveu the league is entered in the first
quarter's account from 1916, item No.

ments to them I will refer to this re
port. "I ask that this may be sanctioned.
Another document referred to the
use of New York representative of
the Wolff bureau, the German semi
official news organization, in sending
league reports to Berlin. Under date
of September 16, 1916, Berlin warned
von Bernstorff that the Wolff bureau
agents reports were criticised as too
one-sided and said more unbiased re
ports "seem to be urgently desirable."
Von Bernstorffs message, dated
August 24. 1915, said:
'As your excellency is aware. I have
used the intermediary of the New
York representative of the Wolff
agency. Herr Klaessig, in order to
send telegraphic report, to yon. These
telegrams Intended for you are indi
cated by the fact that they do not
begin by naming the day of the
week.
"In order that the report, shall not
excite attention, it ha. been necessary
in many case, to disguise them in the
form of press extracts, or put into the
mouth of member, of congress, when
in reality they are not intended to be
merely the expression of some indi
vidual opinion, but as being views,
which in my opinion, are important
for the direction of our foreign policy,
and for a proper comprehension of the
local situation."
Wolff Message. Criticized
Berlin sent this message via Ctock
holm and Buenos Aires, dated Sep
tember 16, 1916:
"The reports of the Wolff bureau
agent are rightly criticized by a part
of the German press as one-sided, a.
he has reported for some time noth
ing but indignation agahist English en
croachment which nobody here take,
seriously.
"A. the matter will probably be tak

sense."
Two Agents Named
Consul Reiswitz's letter regarding
the embargo conference said that the
leadership in the movement to stop
shipment of arms to the allies was
In the hands of two men, one in Chi
cago and the other in Detroit. There
was no indication as to the identity
cf the men. This part of the letter fol
lows: "For your confidential information
I would further inform you that the
leadership of the movement thus far,
lies in the hands of two men. (one
in Detroit and one in Chicago) who
are firmly resolved to worn to the
end, that the German country shall
above all things remain the back
ground, and that to all outward ap
pearances it shall have an American
character. I have known these gen
tlemen very ell for a long time and
know that personal interest doe. not
count with them; the results will
bring their own reward."
To Outwit Censor.
Mr. Bielaski Introduced letters writ
ten by G. Thomas, at Rotterdam, to
George Barthelme, former represen
tative here of the Cologne Gazette.
outlining a scheme for outwitting the
British censors and getting eGrman
news to the United States and Central
America. According to t'ae letters the
plan was to establish a cable news
sertlce system between Holland nd
America which ostensibly would be an
exchange service between a Dutch
paper and a newspaper or new asso
ciation in America; The United States
broke off diplomatic relations with
Germany before the plan was put into
operation.
Organization of the eitizens corn
committee for food shipment, ostensi
bly formed to send food to German
civilians, was alleged by Mr. Bielaski,
who said the apparent expenditures
for postal shipment of condensed
amount to more than the value
of the goods - shipped. Thirty thou
sand dollars collected by the organ
ization under the guise of intending
to send focd to Germany, apparently
was spent for other causes, he said.
The -committee was formed. Mr. Bie
laski said, at the home of Samuel Un
termyer in New York.
To Distribute Classrc.
The German publication sqciety. to
distribute German classics, also was
formed. Mr Bielaski said. Dr. Albert
giving UTi.Oi'O for that purpose.
"As usual." said the witness.
"Gerrge Sylvester Yiereck had some
thing to flu with this organization,
even after the United States entered
the war. but he ceased his activities
after the passage of the espionage
act."
Lecturers Were Subsidized
Mr. BieJas-ki submitted to the com
mittee copies of letters showing that
several lecturers who toured the coun
try speaking in favor of Germany were
paid by von Bernstorff. One of these.
Mrs. Ray Heveridge. received J:!iimi
for her services, he said. Mrs. Beve

von Bernstorff. the witness declared,
and at one time brought a parcel of

him from Germany.

school course.
Edison, Eastman. Frklt, Shedd. Far
rell, Wilson, Simmons, Carnegie, Ford,
Woolworth. Duie, Douglas, these, and
many others who have risen from the
ranks received a very moderate
amount of school education. But most
of them have become educated men,
men of wide knowledge, men of pow
erful mentality, men of the keenest j
observation, uven of the soundest
judgment, men who have studied na
ture as well as ' business. Andrew
Carnegie had a tutor even after he
graduated, to a Fifth avenue mansion.
- Even the busiest of financiers and
captains of industry find time to read
a great deal. Quite a few of them
have a cast irou rule to read for at
least an hour every night before going
to sleep, no matter how late they re
tire.
In addition to doing, a full day's
work at his bench or in the mine a
young man should daily devote an
other day to studying all about his
work or bis profession so that he can
better understand the meaning of
everything he does, the why and the
wherefore of it, the principles under
lying it, and thus equip himself to rise
to any height.
Comparatively, few American youths
whoso parents paid for their uni
versity course have reached the top
most rung of the ladder, but it is
astounding to note ,how many of
those at the very top had to work
their own way through college. We
dYn't appreciate anything we get for
nothing. This manifestly applies
with special truth to university train
ing. The fellows who by their own
sweat and their own self-sacritlce had
to pay for their learning derived .most
benefit from it. They were wise
enough to make the most of
a course of study. But very soon the
pleasure derived from the good habit
will immeasureably outweigh the false
pleasure derived from the bad habits.
When the most successful of our
present day leaders were youths the
facilities for self-education were
lamentably meager. Today there are
not only facilities but inducements on
every side. '
The Practical Mining course offered
by the Phelps Dodge corporation to
its -employes will prove of extraordi
nary benefit to the. young men of this

cal men. Watch the bulletin boards

By becoming better educated than

on helpful subjects you will not only

you will lay up for yourself riches

valuable beyond price to you in later
life when the things which money
can buy cease to satisfy and one must
find pleasure and satisfaction and

The annual meeting -of the Warren
District Relief association was held
on .Monday, December 2. in the Cen
tral school building, those present be
ing only the most interested mem
bers and contributors, as on account
of the quarantine regulations the
meeting could not be thrown open to
the general public as in former years.
The meeting was called to order by
Mr. M. Newman, president of the asso
ciation, when after reading of minutes
a financial statement and report of the
work for the past fiscal year, ending
September 1, 1918, as well as financial
statement and sVport - for the past
three months, were given by the gen
eral secretary. Miss Esther Cummings.
This financial statement showed an
expenditure ' of $2196:46 foe the fiscal
year, and an additional expenditure
of $798.24 Tor the past three months,
for all purposes in connection with
the work of the association, during
the periods stated, including groceries,
clothing, rents, fuel, household furn
ishings, trasportation, amounts paid
out on account of illness, and all oth
er necessities.
Forty-nine Families Aided
During the fiscal year 49 families in
the district received aid through this
association, which represented about
140' children, most of these receiving
onlv tenmorarv aid until their condi
tion could be bettered in some way, I
whiel in other cases where there was
illness, accident or death in the fam
ily, the need was greater, but in no
case was there any family given help
where the father was well and able
to work, so that in all the cases aid
was necessary on account of unfortun
ate circumstances. In all, 71 cases of
illness were given aid during the year,
23 of which were tubercular cases.
many of these being transients who
go from place to place in search of a
better climate, and who are obliged
to receive more or less temporary aid
while in the district. Transportation
was furnished in 25 different cases
of families and individuals, where it
was found necessary to send these
people to their friends, or to other
places where they might be able to
better their condition. During th
past three months, however, transpor
tation was furnished on three occa
sions only. '
Clothing and Employment
A great deal of clothing was sup
plied and distributed among the Mex
ican families in the district, where
the mothers have been left with a
number of children to support. Most
of the expense to the association for
the Mexican families is on account of
the clothing supplied them, although
much of this clothing is donated.
During the Hiseal. year employ intuit
was furnisheiljmaiiy women and girls.
on at least 7f occasions, one of the
chief objects being to help all such
people to become self-supporting
wnenever it is possiDle. to do so. ;
On account of the influenza epl
demic during, the past two months
mnch extra work, was done, by the as
sociation, as on account of illness
many families were left destitute for
the time being. Over 20 women were
employed to act' as nurses, and every
effort was made to render aid in nurs
ing as soon as it was known that this
was necessary. In this way between
50. and. 60 families were supplied with
the required help without much delay,
and it is believed that many, deaths
were avoided on account of the people
being able to get some one to care
for them before it was too late. Where
such families were unable to pay for
a nurse this expense was paid by the
association for the time being.
Stands for Welfare
The Warren District Relief associa-
tion has always endeavored to stand
for the general welfare of the Warren
district in every way, and has been a
center of investigation for any and all
matters referred to it, although many
of such cases have not required direct
relief from the funds of the associa
tion. If there were dependent and
neglected children to be cared for they
could b, taken over by the juvenile
court Sot proper care and supervision,
or if there were widows with depen
dent children to be cared for the asso
ciation could frequently obtain the
widow's pension or at least some coun
ty aid to cmihle the mother to keep
her li in i I y together until the children
could become srMf supporting, probab
ly with some extra aid from the asso
ciation, but it has always been the ol-

SYDNEY. Australia, Nov. 6. Cor
respondence of the Associated Press.)
When the French mission headed
by Gen. Paul Pau, which is now tour
ing Australia, returns home it will
urge the government to appoint trade
commissioners to improve the com
mercial relations between France and
Australia. Dr. Siegfried and M. Motte,
j..u ers of the mission, have been
Vw.j- actively engaged in Sydney and
i... bourne in conferring with com
inticial interests and governmental
departments with this end in view.
Addressing the Commercial Travelers'
association in Sydney early in Octo
ber M. Motte said that the Germans
has robbed northern France of
$100,000,000 worth of wool and woolen
goods, machinery, leather, corper and
other things and he added. "It will
take us some time to reorganize, and
.we want support in order to enable
us to rebuild trade before Germany
can find her place again."
Subsequently, at a dinner given to
the mission by the commonwealth
government in parliament house, Mel
bourne, the actiug prime minister,
William A. Watt, said: 'For four
years prior io the war Australia im
ported from France a yearly average
of $10,900,000 worth of goods; while
we say it with shame during the same
period our yearly average with Ger
many was $32,000,000. Now we have
learned that it is better to do busi
ness with civilized and friendly
people. , If Australia can by the ef
forts of the government and parlia
ment put France in the position that
Germany formerly was in the govern
ment and parliament will do so with
pleasure. We recognize that France
deserves special consideration among
all the allies." .
Lille, Roubaix and Tourcoing, be
fore the war, were the chief French
manufacturing centers. . German in
vasion and occupation ruined them,
plunder and destruction, being 'the
enemy's policy. The French government,-
however, has been for some
time preparing for the reoccupation
of the wool districts, and it is expect
ed that now the factories will be
speedily rebuilt and the large consign
ments of American machinery import
ed will be installed.

LONDON, Not. 16, (Correspondence
of the Associated Press.) Out from a
dense fog streaking the sea shot a
small dirigible called a blimp, man
ned by three allied flyers. Directly in
from of them a mile away, was a
U-boat with its conning tower and
decks well out of the water, says an
account of one of the most success
ful encounters of a British aircraft
with a German submarine.
, Opening out his engine to its full
capacity, the pilot steered straight
for the German craft, many of whose
crew' were on deck. They-had seed
the airship approaching and imme
diately brought a quick-firing gun into
action. With shells bursting about
them, the airmen pushed on and soon
were within, effective machine-gun
range.'
The observer used his gun to such
good effect that with one drum he ac
counted for the submarine's gun crew.
Thereupon the Germans, without wait
ing to rescue their wounded, began
hurriedly to submerge.
Meanwhile the wireless operator of
the "blimp" was busy sending out
urgent signals to various patrol boats
and submarine chasers known to be in
the vicinity.
Climbing to a height of about 1500
feet; the pilot now got ready to use
the- "machine's heavy bombs. The
U-boat, although submerged was still
easily visible, and taking careful aim
through his sights the "blimp's" gun
ner pulled the trigged of the releasing
gear
The airship, released of a heavy
weight, shot up like an express eleva
tor in a New York skyscraper, but
careless of its movements its occu
pants hung over watching the bomb
sink swiftly until it struck the water.

PARIS. Nov. 7. Probably the big
gest problem that the Young "Men's
Christian association has to face in
the city of Taris, is the housing of
soldiers who flock to this city in thou
sands for 24 to 48 hours leave. Every
American toy who comes to France is
eager to see the city of Paris, and
the prices of accommodations at the
French hotels is beyond the possibili
ties of their slender purses. The
Y. M. C. A. has several hotels where
they can go and for one franc a
night can get a bed and a shower.
Meals are served at cost.
The Pavilion is the largest of these
hotels .and as an illustration the
crowd that flocked in there the other
night is a good one to be guided by.
The hotel was full to overflowing. The
other hotels in the neighborhood on
the overflow list were also crowded
to the limit. The office also has a
long list of rooms which French fam
ilies will rent to soldiers. The list
was exhausted, yet the men kept pour

coats, rolled them up, made them into
pillows and slept on the floor of the
"lounge room." At eleven all lights

JURY TRIALS WILL
START IN SUPERIOR
COURT NEXT MONTH
FIRST MONDAY IN JANUARY WILL
SEE CIVIL JURY CASES BEGUN;
CALL OF THE COURT CALEN
DAR WILL BE MADE SOON IS
THE PREDICTION
Judge Lockwood of the superior
court at Tombstone was in the city
yesterday for the purpose of having
his youngest daughter examined by
the local doctors. She had an attack
of influenza and never fully recovered
from the effects and he wished to
have an examination made. It was
discovered that she was not fully re
covered from the effects of the dis
ease and that it would wear off in
time. They returned home late last
evening.
Befora leaving Judge Lockwood
stated that he would call the next
jury term, both for the disposition of
the civil and criminal calendar, for
duty on Monday, January 6. This, of
course. Is provided the epuarantine Is
lifted on the entire county within a
week or two. He had originally in
tended to call the jury this month,
basing his dates on the fact that the
quarantine would have been lifted
early in December. Owing to the law
governing the calling of juries, how
ever, a jury could not be secured to
report until December 23 at the earl
iest, which would only give two days
before Christmas. This would entail
much expense and delay, and the
court has decided to postpone the call
ing of the jury until the first Mon
day in January. From then on, there
Is now on the docket enough civil
jury cases to last at least three
months, while the criminal business
will take up over a month. The civil
1 cases on the docket do not Include in
' the vicinity of 300 civil suits, known
! as the "deportation cases." The civil
I calendar will be tried first, stated
the court today, giving time for the
new county attorney to, get his calen
dar ready.
The call of the calendar for the set
ting of the cases will be made the lat
ter part of the month, either on the
21st or 23d. Due notice will be given
before that time.

Secretary of Arizona Chapter of American Mining Congress
Shows in His Annual Report That This Year's Production
""of State Will Be 819,000,000 Founds, as Against Bumper
' Yield of 700,000,000 Pounds Made Last Year; Regarded
as Best Informed Compilation of Figures Extant; Discusses
Present Copper Situation
The afinual report of Secretary J. E. Curry to the members of the Ari
zona chapter of the American Mining congress, contains much Interesting in
formation concerning the mining industry in Arizona, particularly as to the
copper producing division.
Among other things, the report places an estimate upon the year's copper
production which exceeds by more than 100.000,000 pounds the output of 1917.
the previous high year in Arizona copper production. The estimate for this
year is based upon carefully gathered and segregated figures, taking into
account all copper made from Arizona ores and may be accepted as the best
informed compilation of figures on the. state's production that is available,
the figures of the Geological Survey or the Engineering & Mining News not
excepted. The report of Secretary Curry in part is as follows:
Copper Production
The copper production of the State of Arizona for the year 1918 is esti
mated to be S29.000.000 pounds as against the previous year's production of
700,000,000 pounds, showing an increase of 129.000.000 pounds. Not included
In the above figures, might be conservatively estimated five hundred thousand
pounds of copper produced by Arizona, mines from shipments of ore to
smelters outside the state.

"A. The present rate of production

employment being thus Insured dur
ing the first period of the transition
from a war to a peace basis."
"P. The present level of prices of
the metal and the existing wage scale
of labor are to be preserved."
"C. The War Industries board, or
such other government agency as may
be designated, is to continue regula
tion of prices and allocation of the
mineral."
Supply of Copper
It is estimated that more copper
has been produced since July than has
been sold, yet apparently there has
been a shortage In supply. The short
age, however, is unreal and is ac
counted for by delays In refining and
transportation. Forcing production
has been the rule. Keeping up pro
duction, handicapped by a shortage of
labor with which to carry on develop
ment has brought many mines into. a
restricted productive capacity. Ad
vance development work must be done
before the properties will again be at
tbelr.best
Cost of Copper
The advance in wages, freight rates
and the increased cost of supplies, to
gether with war taxes, has brought
the cost of producing a pound of cop
per to more than double pre-war cost
and in many instances materially
higher.
With no reduction in wages, freight
rates or supplies, there is no induce-1
merit for mining companies to con
continuance of the present market 1
prices of 26 cents a pound.
Efficiency of Working Forces
In mining and manufacturing gen-'"1
,n . ; .
erally it is reported there has been
notoriously diminished efficiency In
work per hour or shift. Although
wages are higher, efficiency is low.1

which the Anaconda Copper Mining company built In Great Falls at the

which began output October 12, closed last night without having sold a

Efforts of Gold Producers
Your chapter contributed J500 to
ward the fund raised by -the Ameri
can Gold conference to defray ex
penses of Its executive committee to
Washington for conference' with the
secretary of the treasury, the director
of the mint, the senate and the house
committees on mines and mining and
other governmental departments for
the purpose of obtaining relief to the
gold producers. Relief sought, was
hoped to be accomplished through leg
islation providing a bounty on the pro
duction of gold.. The committee should
arrive In Washington November 22.
The War Industries board has an
nounced that the restriction hereto
fore imposed on the domestic uses of
gold and silver for Industrial pur
poses has been terminated.
Slowing Down of Production
The Industries of the country which
have responded whole-heartedly to the
call of the government for increased
production must, with the discontinu
ance of war, be diverted from war
time production to their normal In
times of peace. . '
During the war production of non
essentials was largely eliminated and
civilian needs curtailed. The efforts
of the War Industries board wilj be
to curtail as rapidly as possible the
production of war necessities. Instruc
tions have been issued to all bureaus
of the war department governing the
method of slowing down of production
so that, as far as possible, there should
be a tapering off of war work, giv
ing time for industrial re-adjustment.
The Compensation Measure
The necessity for a workmen's com
pensation measure has been felt since
the enactment of certain laws by the
'lKisla'Urf ?f A"ti ,aw
equitable and just compensation law
that would be acceptable to the voters

ine annual meeting or tne Arizona
Chapter American Mining congress .
held at Phoenix during last week was
attended by resumption of urgency on
the part of the chapter thathe min
ing industry be given a seat in the
naional cabinet. This movement was j
started a year ago by the chapter and
nas Deen Kept constantly to tne rore i
in resolutions adopted and forwarded
to Washington from all meetings held
in the interim. Because of the vigor
with which the matter has been urged,
mining organizations throughout the
country have come in line together
with the national organization of the
American Mining congress and there
is considered at this time to be bet
ter outlook for the attainment of a
cabinet seat for mining than at any
prior period.
At the annual meeting of the Ari
zona chapter in Phoenix there was
representation from all of the import
ant producing districts of the state.
The formal business transacted in
cluded the re-election of the old board
of directors to serve during the en
suing year. The board organized with
Norman Carmichael of Clifton, as gov
ernor; Cpt. Joseph P. Hodgson declin
ing to set a third term precedent and
placing Mr. Carmichael in nomination.
Three vice-goverinors were elected,
Fobert E. Tally of Jerome, first vice
governor; W. B. Gohring of Bisbee.
second vice-governor; G. H. Dowell of
Bisbee, third vice-governor. Joseph
E. Curry was re-elected secretary and
accorded a strong vote of thanks for
untiring endeavor through his office
for the advancement of the best in

Among general actions taken In the
annual meeting was endorsement of
proposal of the national organization
of the mining congress to materially
expand its work, particularly in point
of bringing larger co-operation be
tween the several branches of the in
dustry, coal. Iron, copper, etc. The
proposal if carried out, as is probable,
will make available a far wider range
of statistics concerning mining activ

partly by the fact that be is no longer

Colonel Thompson has not been ac

The clearest paper yet issued as
defining the difference from a tax
able standpoint of the developing mine
and the established mine and as de
fining mining investment and the dif
ference between this and commercial
investment, has been forwarded to the
United States treasury department as
a resolution from the Association of
Arizona Mining Men. The resolution
was written and presented by T. O.
McGrath of Shat tuck-Arizona and wad
adopted as presented.
Interpretation of the mine taxation
laws of the federal government, ac
cording to recent announcement, is
up to the treasury department again
without the aid of congressional
amendments which It mas hoped
would be passed and smooth ont

It is the hope that among the recom

will be found proposals which can
be adopted and which will materially
clear the situation. The resolution

TAXING THE PROSPECTOR.
Sir: The present income tax law
and treasury department rulings gov
erning the collection of the income
taxes makes no distinction between
mines in the course of development
and mines that have been proven and
placed upon a producing basis.. This
results in the taxing of the net re
turns from development ore shipped
from prospect and development mines
as Income before It is known whether
or not such return will be Income or
capital returned.
In order to bring this matter be
fore the treasury department, at a
meeting at Phoenix. Ariz.. October 12.
1918. the represent.lt ives of about
30 mines that are in the course of
development met and adopted the fol
lowing resolution, which Is respect
fully referred to ou for attention and
decision:
Suggestion for an addtion to the
treasury department's regulations
governing the collection of the in
come tax in order to protect the
prospect and development mines
from paying an income tax upon a
return of principal.
WHEREAS. The present federal
acts Imposing an Income tax upon
mining companies, and the treasury
department's rulings governing the
collection of the Income tax. do not
make any distinction between income
received by producing mines that
have developed sufficient ore to guar
antee the return, or to warrant a be
lief in the return, of the original cap
ital invested In the business to the
business, as well as a profit above
the return of the original Investment,
and the income received by prospect
and development mines that have not
developed sufficient ore to guarantee
the return, or the reasonable belief
in the return, of the original capital
invested tn the business to the busi
ness; and.
WHEREAS. The said federal acta
and the treasury department's rulings

LAKE DISTRICT
LABOR PROBLEM
BEING
SOLVED
Return of Men From Muni
tion Factories and Adoption
of Mechanical H a u la g e
Point to Solution
CALUMET. Mich.. Dec. 7. With
winter approaching, assurance of
steady employment is bringing a lot
of workers back to the Lake Superior
mines and there is a feeling among
the mine managers that the metal
output next spring will be up to nor
mal. After a lapse of two years or
more, during which practically every
mine in the lake district suffered ma
terially, there now is a ray of hope
that the time is not far distant when
every mine will be lull banded. In
fact, it is believed that the producers
can reach normal with approximate!)
4000 more workers.
The removal of workmen from the
Lake section dates back to 1914, but
it reached its climax only last sum
mer. In the meantime, it is variously
estimated that between 3000 and
600 men, many of them with their
families, went to the munition in
dustrial centers. Some of the mines
distant from the larger towns have
been hit more seriously than others
and one employment manager, whose
field covers almost half of the district,
estimates that the shortage of tram
mers has been as high as 40 per cent.
While the managers were worrying
over the loss of their men and espe
cially trammers, experts have been
working out various schemes to meet
such un exigency and, to a large ex
tern, the problem is nelng solved.
The reduction of the physical effort
element from tramming long has been
sought and the introduction of me
chanical devices is the solution.
Chutes, automatic loading equip
ment and underground haulage are be
ing perfected to a degree that tram
ming soon will not be so arduous.
This is noted especially at Isle Koyale.
where the production has been ma
terially increased and the trammer
force has- dropped U0 per cent. In
fact. Isle Royale, with less than 200
trammers lust mouth produced more
copper than it did with 300 tram
mers. The use of underground haulage is
becoming more general al the lake
and it is believed that the days of
relying only on manual labor in mov
ing cars from the stopes to the skip
roads are nearing an end. Mohawk
is using four underground locomo
tives, but they have been in commis
sion only a part of November so the
increase in production will not be
noted until next month.
Calumet & Hecla is experimenting
with three loading devices and with
the supplanting of manual labor with
mechanism, it will have solved a rid
dle for once and for all. The extent
to which these loaders will be used
may be seen from a statement by an
authority at the property who assets
that the output will be equal to mill
capacity within a month or two. In
fact'' another hundred trammers are
all that are required to boost the
daily production to 10.000 tons.
Higher efficiency is another ele
ment that will be reflected in larger
tonnages and the knowledge ' that
there no longer is a labor shortage
at once makes tor "more rock per
man." During the period when men
were in demand, there was a tendency
to "rest on their oars" and a resultant
smaller output. The haste with which
mine employes are getting back to
the Lake district now is apparent, not
only in the mines and .mills but in
the shops where the workers are striv
ing to demonstrate their efficiency.

A recent visitor at Ajo states that
among all Arizona producing mines
New Cornelia is now looking best iu
point of efficiency of operation and
extension of ore resources.
Recently the steam shovel operations
have gone out beyond the original
drill hole boundaries, within which
the findings in the holes, pits and
drifts provided the ' information upon
which determination of tonnage avail
able was made, and have demonstrat
ed extension of the ore resources be
yond those boundaries.
In the underground development on
the Ajo Con., purchased by New Cor
nelia last winter, ore tonnage in ex
cess of estimates upon which pur
chase of the ground was made is also
being developed. This is direct smelt
ing ore and running even higher tnan
original estimates. Both in the steam
shovel surface operations and in the
underground development, therefore,
New Cornelia is increasing available
tonnage of good commercial ore at a
material pace. Those who in the early
day of New Cornelia operations pre
dicted that the property would greatly
increase its tonnage, possibly more
than doubling original estimates,
have occasion to feel satisfaction with
their advance judgment.
In the reduction plants of the com
pany, the largest engaged in precipi
tation practices in the world, splendid
operation results are being obtained,
These plants involved much that was
entirely new in practice in the begin
ning of their work and called for the
exercise of a great deal of pioneer
ing ingenuity, which the splendid
management has demonstrated itself
wholly equal to in all of the 'several
divisions of operation. Changes
which have been required have not
encroached upon the original prin
ciples of operation, which have proven
wholly successful. Some alterations
of slight character, mainly in provid
ing heavier equipment, have been
necessary but these have not been as
extensive as have usually to be dealt
with in getting new reduction plants
of large capacity in efficient opera
tion. Influenza made severe inroads upon
working forces of New Cornelia dur-

The National Conduit & Cable com-;
pany s monthly review of the copper
market says: ' i
The copper market remains steady
although quiet. With the fixed maxi
mum price of 26 cents a pound to con- i
tinue in force until January 1 there 1
are no indications at present that pro-1
ducers are prepared to book orders on
any different basis. There has been
a ready -outlet for the bulk of market
able metal as it became available, and
refiners were busy until lately ship-
ping out their products on a big !
scale. j
Of couise the cessation of war will !
make a great difference in the char-!
acter of the demand for copper, muni-!
tions and a variety of war equipment J
material have been absorbing almost !
me entire output for many months.
Productive capacity has consequently
been taxed to the limit in order that
this country and our allies might be
supplied with sufficient tonnage to fill
the enormous domestic and foreign
requirements. During the long period
of hostilities the entire copper indus
try was called upon to concentrate all
their efforts on the sole task of furn- j
ishing every pound of copper needed i
by the United States and the different ,
entente countries. And this tremend-!
ous undertaking was wonderfully sue-1
cessful notwithstanding the many dif-:
ficulties in the way.
Meanwhile during the extended per-1
iod of war activity much new con-1
struction work and ordinary indus
trial enterprise had to be postponed !
while the great world conflict was in i
progress. Consequently there is an I
enormous amount of delayed work to !
be attended to as soon as business !
and industry become adjusted to the ;
new post-war conditions. I
Nevertheless receut developments i
are likely to induce considerable con-1
servatism among manufacturers and j
consumers. Although there has been i
conspicuous strength and buoyancy !
apparent in the copper market hither- i
to the process of industrial readjust- j
ment to a peace basis is bound to
mvoiie new possimuties. It seems
probable, thetefore, owing to the ex
traordinary conditions that the war
industries board will continue to ex
ercise a certain amount of govern
mental control over tho situation until
the work of reconstruction advances
and the, equilibrium of normal trade
is more definitely assured. The sta
bilization of the market, and condi
tions generally, is of urgent import
ance at this time, when trade and
commerce must necessarily feel the
stress andstrain incident to the
change from war to peace.
Prominent copper producers are to
meet with the war industries hoard
in Washington to confer together re
garding plans for stabilizing the cop
per industry during the transition
from a war to a peace basis. Up to
present there is no knowledge of the
government having cancelled any of
its copper contracts and no immediate
action is looked for in this respect.

mained to secure the necessary sig
natures to place the proposed law
upon the ballot, it was immediately
taken to headquarters of the state fed
eration of labor for approval or re
jection. A promise was obtained from
the president of the state federation
of labor to give the proposed law full
consideration and that it would be re
ferred to the several locals and their
attitude reported. This was not done.
Instead of referring It to the locals
and to central trades councils, several
of which had expressed a friendliness
towards the proposed law, the presi
dent of the state federation of labor
was induced, we presume, through in
fluence of personal injury lawyers, to
rt commend to all local unions of. or
ganized labor, without having read
the measure, to fight it. If, there
fore, it was defeated labor is to blame
only for following the instructions of
a leader to whom it had every right
to look for honest counsel.
Department of Mining
It has been suggested that I lie pres
ent woufd be the ntsi opportui f
time to urge upon tho congress ol
the United Stales the necessity of the
early creation of a new cabinet port
folio that of Minister of mines.
After a review of the history of
mining in the l ulled .States during
the past 20 months of war experience,
it is believed that, regordless of those
in congress who formerly opposed the
creation of this department, there
would be few indeed who would not
at t'ns particular time lend tlieir un
stinted support to Die formation of a
branch of the ministry to head tue
industry of mining.
Ily a careful perusal of the acci.inp-
l;sliiiient of the minis of the United
Stiitts during the past two years--and.
particularly the base metHl mines

Iteport from the United States Oil
& Kefining company, operating near
Bowie, is that arrangement has been
made to secure a standard drilling rig
and that it is expected that it can be
put on the ground early in the new
year.
With churn drill equipment this
company managed to get its hole down
710 feel, where it was obliged to stop
because of inadequacy of its equip
ment to make further denth. The
drill stopped 14 feet down in a line ,
t apping similar to those which have i
come to be considered in oil develop-1
ment as commonly overlying oil pools.
Shale and sand alternated in the
structure which the churn drill went
through until it reached the limestone.
At 340 feet they went through a paraf
fine sand which the chemists found to
be soaked with oil. All of these find
ings are opposed to theories advanced
by some, previous to sinking of the
well, that the country did not possess
oil toi mation. That it has tho latter
is now conceded, the only question be
ing whether commercial quantities of
oil will be found.
United States Oil & Kefining is a
Bisbee enterprise, financed to the
present time entirely by Bisbee In
vestors. Shut down at the pioperty oc
curred aliout a month ago. since when
active steps have lieeu taken to ar
range for resumption with a ris equal
to going to such depth as may be
necussary to thoroughly lest tne coun
try. Present belief is that when the
present limestone capping is gone
through enough will bo found to solve
uuy problems of financing that may
thereafter come up.

Note the Gradual but Steady Decline of the Kaiser's Arrogant,
Prideful Gaims From 1914 to Last October
THE EISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, DECEMBER 8, 1918.

r f ' 'A
i : f t
The whole world remembers the
boastful utterances of the German
kaiser before the war began and at in
tervals afterward. As the years of
conflict passed and his dream of em
pire not only remained unfulfilled, but
began to fade, the tone of his speeches
changed until they became mere mut
terings of platitudes. The following
selections will serve as illustrations:
November, 19"14. "Under all cir
cumstances, the enemy will be bea
ten." The kaiser to the Brandenbury
regiment behind the front.
June, 1915. "I have not willed
this." The kaiser on seeing a group
01 iauen uernian soldiers on the west
ern front
July, 1916. "It is the most poignant
grief of my life that I am not able to
take a more active part in the war. It
is my earnest desire to take my place
in the trenches. I could take my place
with, the youngest of you, and I prom
ise you I would leave my mark on the
enemy. But the Almighty has decreed
otherwise. My life must be conserved
carefully for the welfare of Germany
in order to carry out the duties assign
ed to me by divine appointment."
The kaiser to his soldiers on the Som
me front.
September, 1916. "Everybody must
admit that our nation is great, that it
is, without complaint or hesitation,
sacrificing everything for a great
cause. This is an inspiration derived
from God." The kaiser to

thoroughly. We live with the Lord."
The kaiser to army chaplains.
August, 1917. "Above all, we stand
resolute to prosecute this righteous
war of defense to a successful victory
Our enemies do not know how Ger
many can fight. Our people may rest
assured that German blood and Ger
man zeal are not being gambled with
for an empty shadow of ambition or
schemes of conquest, but in defense
of a strong, free empire in which our
children may live in security."
Kaiser's proclamation to the German
people and armies.
August, 1917. "A difficult struggle
lies ahead of us. But, with God's help,
we shall see the struggle through and
be victorious." The kaiser to his
troops on the Flanders front.
February, - 1918. "The German
sword has prepared the way for peace.
Look ahead! Trust in God!" The
kaiser to the German Agricultural
society.
March, 1918. "Firmly . trusting in
the sword, I face a future whiff will
bring us victory and a strong peace."
The kaiser to the king of Saxony.
June, 1918. "I know that Prussian
militarism, bo much abused by our
enemies, winch my forefathers ana 1,
in a spirit of dutifulness, loyalty, or
der and obedience have nutured, has
given Germany's sword and the Ger
man nation strength to triumph, and
that victory will brine a peace which

This year more than any other is a
year to give only the most practical
things possible, nothing must be
wasted at Christmas time. We want
to give the durable gift, not for a day
or an hour but for a year. The Red
Cross has asked that America give as
its present to our army and navy its
annual pledge of membership to the
Red Cross. A small thing for an in
dividual, dollar, bnt for the-service
what a lot it will mean. Good
cheer at the canteens, recreation cen
ters, and hospitals, and cigars and
cigarettes for the men in places you
can not get yourself, for there are
numbers who have no one to think of
them. Not only for your own boy, who
has fought so bravely but for every
boy who has worn the khaki and put
new spirit into the allies cause. This
you can do through your own Red
Cross. Give your membership.
In addition there are other lovely
gifts most appropriate for a fighting
man, or rather one that has been a
fighting man. A comfort bag, one of
the very convenient things that have
been worked out. It contains soap,
Bocks, shaving stick, cold cream, face
cloth, writing pad, comb .trench mir
ror, etc. Though these go at Christ
mas they may be used all the year and
even when the boys are mustered out
and come back to take up their pur
suits in life come in nicely.
Practical Gifts
A basket, or pieces of old straw
hats, make a work bag, top of blue
silk, bindings, gold gallon, flowers,
colored crocheted wool; handle of
brown silk braid. For a traveling case
line oval pieces cretonne with rub

insider 1 1-2 inches, snap double. For
cone shaped knitting bag, line two
pieces cretonne with buckram, put to

To make a sachet pincushion, bits of
silk and scraps of lace and Georg

cushion 8 1-2 inches long and 6 inches
wide, diamond shaped. Cover the tops
with scraps of lace whipped together;
a puffing of silk, a chiffon ruffle, a
lace ruffle and flowers complete it.
Comething you can make at home at
small cost, to be welcomed by a book
ish friend, is a pair of book ends. Buy
the ordinary book ends at the ten cent
store, cover them with cretonne, bind
the edges with colored braid and
make pockets. To make a talcum pow
der holder, fashion a frame of buck
ram with an oval piece of cardboard
for the bottom. Cover the buckram
with colored silk on the outside, line
it with white china silk, and make the
trimming of gold lace and gold braid.
War-time Fashions
The winter dresses are surprising
ly alike in line, and yet quite differ

They actually measure a yard and a
half or less, around the hem, and the
skirts are absolutely, straight and
skimpy in effect, with their charm de

by the contrasting materials. Wom
en look very smart in the new clothes
of the season. There is a good deal
long coats of the somber colors in du
vetyne or velours, small hats of a
bright contrasting shade. There is a
sprinkling of henna red in the coats
and cloth capes. These winter capes
are different from the spring capes in
that they are slimmer, trimmed with
fur collars and frequently close at
the neck.
POPULAR COUPLE MARRY
Miss Ethel Bonner and Roy T.
Greene were married by the Reverend
Jacob White in the Episcopal church
at 6:30 p. m. Wednesday. The cere
mony was solemnized in the presence

the bridal couple were host and host
ess at a dinner at the Copper Queen
hotel. The table was artistically dec
orated in pink carnations and smilax,
the carnations the same shade as the
bride's cheeks. The guests were the
Rev. Mr. White. Miss. Winifred Cool
ey, Mr. D. A. Blackburn and Mr. L.
Barker. The couple left that night on
the Golden State limited for a short
honeymoon and will reside in Warren

sought to prevent King Ferdinand
from committing Bulgaria to war on

FRENCH TOWN WHERE YOUR
BOY MAY SPEND CHRISTMAS
Where, somewhere in France, will
Arizona soldiers spend Christmas?
On November 27 the war depart
ment announced the whereabouts of
the 35 combat divisions and six depot
divisions of the American army in
France, as of November 7. Since it
is no longer necessary to keep' secret
the location of American forces in
France, it is assumablc that the divi
sions were still where they were on
November 7, when the war Apart
ment made the announcement a few
days ago of their location.
Twenty-two of the army divisions
are partially located at St. Dizier,
which is evidently a great rest camp.
The 89th division, a combat division,
composed of Arizona. Missouri, South
Dakota. Nebraska, Colorado and New
Mexico troops, is located at Tailly
and St. Dizier, while the 40th Depot
division Is located at Revigny and St.
Dizier.
Therefore, the names Tailly, St.
Dizier and Revigny have a- special in
terest for Warren district citizens,
and maybe the destination of the
Christmas package and thoughts of
them for their soldier boys in France.
St. Dizier is at the Junction of two
principal highways which form a
letter "X," with the town at the cen
ter. It is also on the Meuse river
and is only about 15 miles (on a bee
line) from Barle-Duc. but there Is no
direct rail 'connection with the town.
It Is connected with Vitry-le-Francois
(or simply Vitry) by highway, rail
road and by the Canal de Dizier. The
distance is only about IS miles, and
as it is a city of some pretensions
it undoubtedly will attract many Ari
zona boys on Christmas leave. Paris
is considerably distant, though "dis
tance" in France conveys a conception
different from Arizona distance. It is
approximately 100 miles almost due
east of Paris; more accurately east
by south; by rail it would be more.
St. Dizier is in the department of
Home Marne, and is about 35 miles
southeast of Chalons-sur-Marne, with
which it is directly connected by high
road, canal and railroad.
Revigny is about 13 miles due north
of St. Dizier, but is in the depart
ment of the Meuse. It is situated on
a narrow-gauge railroad and is In
walking distance from the famous
Aisne-Marne canal. It is on the Or
naine river, and is about ten miles
west of r.ar-le-Due. Revigny is locat
ed on a blue line on the war map
which represents the Germans' farth
est advance in 1914. St. Dizier is
not In the Invaded country. Revigny
Is about 20 miles from Vitry-le-Francois
and about 30 miles from Chalons-sur-Marne.
but it has no direct rail or
highway connections with the last
named nlace. To the north is St.
Minehould. on the Aisne, and on the
western edge of the famous Argonne
forest, where the American army
fought its greatest battle and won its
greatest victory.
Arizona troops at Tailly are well
within the repent battle tone, being
only shout IS miles southesst of Se
dan where the Amerfcnns nlso cov
ered themselves with glory. It ap
parently Is a somewhat isolated vil
lage if any place in so crowded coun
try ran be said to he "isolated." for
it is neither direA ly on a railroad or
a highway, and there are few places,
however small, that STe not close to
some principal highway..- Tailly will
be found by map students to be in
the deiai'tmcnt of the Ardennes.
Further aids in locating it and in pic
turing its general environs are that
it is several miles west of the edge
of the forest of Woevre, four miles
from the Ve'rdun-Sedan railroad and
only 19 miles from the great fortress
itself.
St. Dizier and Revigny are in east
ern France, far south enough for its
winters to be tempered by the Medi
terranean's balm, and this part of
France is in bold contrast, climatolog
ically speaking, with the northwestern
part, where cold rains make the win
ters unpleasant. Tailly is about 55
miles due north of St, Di.er, and also
higher in altitude, and probably con
siderably colder.
Vive Tailly! Vive St. Dizier! Vie
Revigny! ,

Christmas in France
A fitting Christmas gift to France
will be to adopt a child in that land
or to renew a subscription of adop
tion so that throughout the year 1919,
wholesome food- and warm clothing
may be the lot of a child whose fath
er fell for freedom. Of all the touch
ing scenes in France there is nothing
worse than a cheerless Christmas
morning for the children. Such a very
little will make them happy.
These orphans will grow up in the
memories of a father who fought what
seemed a losing fight, and of a moth
er who toiled and sacrificed to keep
the little family together until hard
ship and exposure became too great
for her frail strength, and she laid
down the burden that the people of
America must take up and make their
own by adoption. This care should
continue until the nation of France
has recuperated and is able to stand
on her own feet and look after her
own. This may be the last year that
it will be necessary for us to put forth
our hand and help in this way.
The blessings of our own children
are so great in comparison that our
hearts go out in sympathy to the less
fortunate. Just' think if there should
be no Santa Claus, no fire in the grate
before which to hang a small stocking,
no nuts and apples and oranges, no
eager voice full of faith and hope.
But in this land of plenty Christmas
day a feeling of thankfulness will glow
In our hearts that the war is over
and won and that peace has really
come again. Glad that our soldiers will
not spend this greatest of days in the
trenches but In warm huts with letters
and gifts to make them happy.
In the hearts of the French the feel
ing of thankfulness will be the same,
of course, hut there will be few If any
rift to make the French orphan girls
heart glad, and no toy engines, to
amuse little boys, for sll the money
to he had mnt be used for the hare
necessities of life. 'Toys must be for
gotten unless the kind people of Amer
ica realize that they have the power
to gladden childish hearts and make
the day of good cheer universal.
Mr. J. P. Potter, the new chairman i
of the boys' advisory board, is tak-1
ing a very active part In the cam-'
paign. Mr. Potter says that he hopes
that in time we will have the very
best boys' department in the west.
There is no reason why this should
not be, as here in Bisbee we have so
many boys. At present the aim for
membership is but 400, but the boys ;

for there is no limit to a boys' energ,

trade associations that is, all .uinu

lines followed by the Germans in

save much expense in maintaining
salesmen and branch agencies and
that just as strong organizations can
be effected as under the other plan.
Advocates of the one-line-of-business
idea contend, however, that their sys

the manufacturers embraced in the

Officials who have studied the

and 12 per cent if distributed as divi

"RESOLVED, That the treasury de
partment, in revising Regulations No.
S3 governing the collection of the in
come tax imposed by acts of Sep
tember 8, 1916, as amended by the
present tax legislation now pending,
include under Article No. 172 of the
present issue of the Regulations No.
23 (which article sets forth the method
of determining the depletion deduc
tion and the method of arriving at the
mine valuation) a paragraph covering
the method of determining the rele
tion deduction against returns from
prospect and development mines as
follows:
PROSPECT AND DEVELOPMENT
MINES.
The net returns from prospect or
development mines shall not be con
sidered income subject to income tax
until the total net development earn
ings, plus the total net value of the
ore in sight shall be equal to or
greater than the investment in mine
property and mine equipment, plus a
reasonable rate of interest on the
actual investment, provided such net
returns are set aside as depletion re
serves for the return to stockholders
of the original investment in the mine
property and mine equipment, or for
further development of, or for re
investment in the mine property.
Any mine so setting aside its net
returns from prospect or development
ores shall, at the end of any year
when the net value of the ore reserves
plus the net 'earnings to d;ite shall be
equal to or greater than the sum total
invested in the mine property and
mine equipment, plus a reasonable
in the mine, (d) and the total net
earnings from development ore that
have been set aside as depletion re
serves. From this statement there shall be
determined the actual depiction re
serves chargeable against past de
velopment returns set aside as capi
tal returned and the depletion reserve
account shall be reduced to the proper
amount, by a transfer or the differ
ence to the surplus account as earn
ings, and upon this amount of earn
ings there shall be levied the proper
income taxes according to the years
in which the earnings accrued.
In support of the above resolution
arguments are offered as follows:
MINING DIFFERS FROM OTHER
BUSINESS.
While the investment in mine prop
erty and mine development is the
same .in principle as the investment
in merchandise by a merchant and in
materials by a manufacturer, never
theless there is no assurance in the
case of mines that the amount of tbe
investment in mine property and de
velopment will be returned either in
whole or in part; for, if there is not
developed sufficient, quantity and
grade of ore to give a return above
the cost of extraction, the total mine
investment is lost.
In the case of a merchant who in
vests in a stock of goods, the imme
diate purpose is to sell the goods or
merchandise in which he has invested
and from each sale of merchandise to
deduct the original cost, thus knowing
immediately whether or. not each unit
of his investment is being disposed of
at a profit or at a loss.
However, in the case of mines, there
can be no sale of the original invest
ment until there has been developed
sufficient commercial ore to equal the
amount of the original investment.
which is the amount paid for the
purchase, development and equipment
of the property. Any net returns
above operating cost from the sale
of development ore in the meantime,
is simply a reduction of the amount
of the development investment neces
sary to prove the value of the initial
investment in the purchase of mining
claims.
When the net value of the develop
ment ore that has been shipped and
that is in place equals the property
investment, then the total net invest
ment in the ore and each ton of ore,
or rai-b pound or ounce of metal, can
be determined and this cost of each
unit can be deducted as depletion
deduction from the amount of the
sale of each unit produced, the same
as the merchant deducts the cost of
ers more ore, establishes new deplu
Hon rates per unit of metal in place
in the mine.
However, in the case of the mer
chant, he knows just what the cost of
returned to the company or indi
vidual? It is very apparent that the treasury
department should make a distinc
tion between the producing mine that
will return the original investment
with interest and the development
mine that obtains a net return from
development ores shipped intermit
tently, or more or less continuously
d'iring a taxable year but which has
EVIAN, France, Nov. 13 (C'oiTfr
spondence of the Associated Press).
The return to France of the women,
children and old men who were sent
out of that part of France occupied
by Germans for more than four years
presented pitiful spectacles. Many of
these refugees were little tots whose
fathers and mothers had been taken
away by the cruel Boche to work in
Germany or behind the fighting lines.
Others were orphans.
Twice daily the affecting scenes of
their return were enacted here when
the tr&ins bringing them through
Switzerland bringing 600 to 700 re
patriates back to the beloved soil of
France. With them were Belgians,
who came from parts of Belgium then
occupied by the Hun. Much was done

may be proven to be nothing, may be

NECESSARY TO MAKE DISTINC
TION BETWEEN DEVELOP
MENT AND MINING.
Out of every one hundred mines
promoted it has been estimated that
only 5 per cent pay back the original
investment in the property and equip
ment with interest, about 47, per cent
pay back only a partial return of the
original investment, and about 50 per
cent fail entirely to pay any return
whatsoever of the original Investment.
Now, should the net returns from
shipments of ore from the 43 per cent
that will make only a partial return
of the original investment be consid
ered income against which there will
be made an estimated depletion
charge and on the remainder there be
paid an income tax of 18 per cent if
undistributed and 12 per cent if distributed?
The abnormally high price of cou
rier, silver and lead the last several
years has enabled a certain portion
of the development failures that had
invested money in the purchase, de
velopment and equipment of mine
property in years past and that had
developed only unprofitable low grade
ore, to re open and to make shipments
of these low grade ores and thereby
obtain a partial return of their orig
inal invest ment which hail been con
sidered an entire loss.
Now, should the net returns m ore
shipments from null mines he con
sidered income subject to an esti
mated depletion deduction ami an in
come tax ou the remainder of 12 per
cent If distributed and IS per cent
if undistributed? Should not such
net returns be considered capital re
turned as long as He re i any duuM
of the prospoct and development
mines would prove a great loss to
those unable to stand such a loss,
and would be the means of discourag
ing the already lagging industry of
prospecting.
We hope that we have herein pre
sented the facts as to ihe distinction
between development mines and
proven mines clearly, and that the
attached statement of procedure is
plain, so as to enable you to see the
n'-ed for making a distinction be
tween the income or returns from de
velopment mines and the income from
proven mines and to exempt the re
turns of development mines from in
come tax, as shown by the attached
statement, until the total development
returns or earnings, plus the "net"
value of the ore in sight, eq'ials the
investment in mining claims, mine
development, mine equipment and a
reasonable rate of interest thereon.
The net value of the ore in sight to
bo determined by the treasury de
partment, using, say the average price
of metals for the pst ten years und
the average recovery vaiues aud costs
obtained during the period of develop
ment operations and a depreciation
of equipment charge necessary to
dose out the cost of equipment by the
time its usefulness wore ended, etc.

PROPAPGNDA RECEIVED
Harry Noel, of this city has received
from his son. Cole Noel, who is with
the 34oth field artillery a copy of
some German peace propaganda that
was dropped from an aeroplane over
the American lines on October 3oth.
It is printed on a small sheet of paper
with English on one side and on the
other in French. Cole Noel will be re

as follows:
The German People Offers Peace
The new German democratic gov
ernment has this programme:
"The will of the people is the high
est law."
The German people wants quickly
to end the slaughter.
The new German popular govern
ment therefore has offered an armis
tice and has declared itself ready for
peace on the basis of I justice and
reconciliation of nations.
It is the will of the German people
that it should live in peace with all
peoples, honestly and loyally.
What has the new German popular
government done so far to put into
practice the will of the people and to
prove its good and upright intentions?
(a) The new German government
has appealed to President Wilson to
bring about peace.
It has recognized and accepted all

CANADA PLANNING FOR
DEMOBILIZATION OF
HER OVERSEAS TROOPS
SYSTEM BEING ARRANGED TO
MEET ECONOMIC AND INDUS
TRIAL CONDITIONS IN DOMIN
ION MEETS APPROVAL OF AU
THORITIES, AWAITS SOLDIERS
WINNIPEG, Canada. Dec. 7. Plans
for the demobilisation of Canada's
286,340 overseas troops under a sys
tem intended to meet economic and
industrial conditions, have been com
pleted and will be put into operation
when withdrawal of the forces is con
sented to by the liigh command.
After considering available shipping
facilities and rolling stock in Canada,
the imperial ministry of shipping and
the Canadian war board have conclud
ed that the rate of return can approxi
mate 20.000 men a month.
Close study of the military and eco
nomic phases of demobilization result
ed in a decision to first return men
whose trade classification showed
there was immediate use for them in
industry. Preference is to be given
married men, the order of their re
turn to be determined by the length
of time in Dverseas service. TJio
single men will be returned along the
same general lines.
Classification of the troops into oc
cupational groups by the militia de
partment was deemed advisable to
meet the requirements of the labor
market in the various districts. To
return the men regardless of their oc
cupation in civil life and demands of
Uie labor marked in their respective
districts would work a hardship upon
them as well as upon Industry, offi
cials decided.
Latest figures list 2S6.304 as the
number of Canadian troops overseas.
An estimate of how these men will
be distributed among the various
provinces, based on the ratio of en
listment 'in each province, follows:
Ontario. 121.500; Quebec. 39,500;
New Brunswick, 12.500; Nova Scotia
and Prince Edward Island, 15,500;
Manitoba. 33,500; Saskatchewan, 18,
500; Alberta, 21.500; British Colum
bia. 23.500.
The problem of bringing back from
England the wies and families of
Canadian soldiers, estimated at 35.000
persons, has been placed with the de
partment of immigration. They will
be returned to Canada as quickly as
possible, as the government desires to
have the soldier's home re-established
before their arrival.
FRENCH RECOVER MUCH
WHEAT FROM GERMANS
NEW YORK, Nov. 30 (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press). More
than 137.500 acres of wheat were re
covered from German occupied terri
tory In France by British and French
armies in the great offensive that end
ed the war, says the New York Fed
eral food board. This is believed by
the food officials to have materially
rontributi d to the food crisis which
helped to bring Germany to her kne-ps.
This wheat was harvested chiefly by
the French. The work of nearly 17,
0m men was required in the harvest
ing. The binding machines and
thres''ii'K iimi liines were supplied by
t lie French office of agricultural re
eonsi i ,i t ion ..id when the harvesting
was compli ted the macluinv were
sold lit i educed prii-ps to fatmers or
