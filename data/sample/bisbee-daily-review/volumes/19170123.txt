(By Review Leased Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO. Jan. 22. For the
first time in the history of the United
States a foreign consul general, Franz
Bopp, one of three consuls general of
Germany in this country, was sen
tenced to prison and payment of a
fine today for violation of American
neutrality. Judge Win. H. Hunt, in
the United States district court, sen
tenced Bopp to two years in a federal
prison at McNeil's Island, Washing

assessed an aggregate fine of $10,000

Three of Bopp's aides, Vice-Consul

violate American neutrality by setting
afoot a military enterprise against
Canada in aid of Germany; second, of
conspiring to violate the Sherman law

in interstate commerce. The first is
a felony for which all, save Mrs. Cor

NAMED
PRESIDENT TELLS SENATE U.
FORSAKE ISOLATION FOLIC! OE 1
YEARS IF
Future Must See Such Concert of Powers That Another
Catastrophe Like Present Shall Be Impossible, Says the
President America Must Announce Her Position Now
' (By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22. President Wilson in a personal address to the Senate
today, laid down the question of whether tie United States shall depart from its tradi
tional policy of isolation and no entangling alliances and take part in a world league to pre
serve peace after the war.
No such history-making event with such far-reaching possibilities to the United
States probably ever had been seen in the Senate chamber.
Gives Only Hope of Lasting Peace.
Shattering precedent of more than a century, the President, regarding the Senate
with its treaty-making powers as his counsellor in foreign affairs, explaining why he be
lieved the time had come for the world to know America's position and describe the un
' derlying causes on which he believes a permanent peace of the world can be maintained.
Shall We Forsake Policy of Washington?
While President Wilson was speaking directly to the Senators, after the manner of
Washington, Madison and Adams, his address was in the hands of foreign diplomats or
on its way to them. In the back-ground of the fundamental problem of whether the
United States shall alter the foreign policy laid down by Washington and carried out by a
long line of presidents, was the thought of most that some such league of nations might
come at the end of the present war. When the President had flnishe'd and the Senate re
turned to its regular business. Senator Lafollette epitomized the sentiment of all present
by saying:
"We have just passed through a very important hour in the life of the world."
Concert of Powers in Future Vital.
Briefly the President in his address said that he believes that a peace of victory in
the present war would not be a permanent peace, and that it must be taken for granted
that peace "must be followed by some definite concert of power which will make it virtu
ally impossible that any such catastrophe shall overwhelm us again."
WASHINGTON, Jan. 22. Whether
the United States shall enter a world
peace league and, as many contend,
thereby abandon its traditional policy
of isolation and no entangling al
liances, was laid squarely before con
gress and the country today by Pres
ident Wilson in a personal address to
the senate.
Diplomats Amazed
For the first time in more than a
hundred years a President 'of the
United States appeared in the senate
chamber to discuss the nation's for
eign relations after the manner of
Washington, Adams and Madison. The
effect was to arouse congressmen of
all quarters and left the foreign diplo
mats amazed and bewildered.
Opinion Differs
Immediately there arose a sharp
division of opinion over the propriety
as well as the substance jf the Pres
ident's proposal.
"Startling." "Staggering," "Astound
ing," the "noblest utterance that has
fallen from human lips since the De
claration of Independence," were
among the expressions of senators.
The President, himself, in his address
said:
"I have said what everybody has
been longing for, but has thought im
possible. Now it appears to be pos
sible." WILSON'S PROPOSALS
The chief points of the Pres
ident's address were:
That a lasting peace in Europe
cannot be a peace of victory for
either side. That peace must be
followed by a definite concert of
power to assure the world that no
catastrophe of war shall over
whelm it again.
That in such a concentration of
power the United States cannot
withhold its participation to guar
antee peace and justice through
out the world.
That before a peace is made the
United States should frankly for
mulate the condition upon which
it would feel justified in asking
the American people for their for
mal and solemn adherence.
"It is clear to every yan who
thinks." the President told the Sen
ate, "that there is in the promise no
breach in either our traditions or our
policy as a nation, but a fulfillment
rather of all that we have professed
or striven for.
Worldwide Monroe Doctrine
"I am pi'jposine that the nations
should with one accord, adopt the
doctrine of President Monroe as the
doctrine of the world: that no nation
should seek to extend its poriry over
any other nation or people, but that
I INT LASTING
every pt'jple should be left free to 1
determine its own policy, its own way
of development unhindered, un
threatened, unafraid, the little along
with the great and the powerful. I
am proposing that all nations hence
forth avoid entangling alliances
which would draw them into competi
tions of power, catch them in a net
of intrigue and selfish rivalry, and
disturb their own affairs with influ
ence intruded from with'out. There is
no entangling alliance in a concert f
power. When all unite to act in the
same sense and with the same pur
pose all act in the common interest
and are free to live their own lives
under a common protection.
Policy of Justice
"I am proposing government by the
consent 'jf the governed ; that freedom
of the seas, which international jus
tice has urged on those who are the
convinced disciples of liberty; and
that moderation of armaments which
make of armies and navies a power
for order merely, not an instrument
of aggression or of selfish violence.
"These are American principles,
American policies. We could stand
for .no others. And they also are the
j principles and policies of forward
j looking men and women everywhere
of every modern nation, of every en
lightened community. They are
principles of mankind anil must pre
vail." Speech Crosses World

Julian's Hotel In
Cananea Collapses
One Person Killed
(By Review Leased Wire)
DOUGLAS, Jan. 22. Messages re
ceived here late today from Cananea
corroborated the report that a large
number of people had been killed or
seriously injured in the collapse of
one wall of the Sonora Hotel. Sunday
ninht. .
Gaston Mendoza. aged 22. was the
only person killed, his body being re
covered this morning. A number of
Kuests, including several Americans,
were slightly injured. W. A. Julian,
proprietor of the hotel and American
vice-consul, was sleeping in a room
on the side which collapsed, but es-
f-nnnfl ininrv
i The collapse of the building was

against the adobe wall, softening it.
S.
copies of his address had been for
warded t'J American diplomats in all
the belligerent countries for the in
formation of those countries, and
were being prepared for representa
tives of neutral governments here.
Groundwork of Peace
Back of the fundamental proposal
for some sort of international sanc
tion for preservation of the future
peace of the world, now already ac
cepted in principle by both sets of bel
ligerents in their replies to President
Wilson's peace note, lies the possi
bility which the President tody openly
expressed, that thereby may be laid
the ground work upon which an ap
proach may be made to an end of the
present war.
In public utterances the President
has hitherto expressed the conviction
that the present was the last great
war in which the United States could
be a neutral, that it no longer could
remain in the position of being "half
in and half out"
"The American people." the Tresi
ident told the senate, "cannot in hon
or withhold the service to which they
are about fj be challenged. They owe
it to themselves, and to the other na
tions of the world, to state the con
ditions under which they will feel
free to render it. I am here to at
tempt to state those conditions.
"The present war must first be end
ed; but we owe it to candor and to
lust regard for the 'opinion of man
kind to say that so far as our partic
ipation in guarantees of future peace
is concerned, it makes a great dial
of difference in what way, and upon
what terms it is ended." 1
While the United States would have
no voice in what those terms would be
he said, it has a voice in making per
manent peace an international cove
nant. New World Speaks
"No covenant or O-operative peace"
he said, "that does not include the
peoples of the New World, can suffice
to keep the future safe against war,
anil yet there is only one sort of peace
that the people of America should
join in guaranteeing. The elements
of that peace must be the elements
that engage the confidence and satisfy
the principles of the American gov
ernment, 'elements insistent with
their, political faith and the convic
tions which the peoples of America
have once for all embraced and un
dertaken to defend."
From this utterance all the Presi
dent's hearers drew the common con
clusion that he was holding out to the
Old World a warning that if it would

What Mr. Wilson is sworn to do is

GOLF TOURNAMENT IS
COMPLETE SUCCESS IN
SPITE BAD WEATHER
Southwestern Golf Associa
tion Closes Its Bisbee Meet.
Many Exciting Contests
Staged Sunday Afternoon.
It was not until yesterday that the
last of the golf enthusiasts who par
ticipated in the third annual tourna
ment of the Southwestern Golf Asso
ciation which was concluded Sunday
i
on the links of the Warren District
Country Club departed for their
homes. Unlike the opening day of
the contests. Sunday was perfect as
to weather conditions but the course,
while playable, was far from being
in such condition as would have ob
tained if the rains had not despoiled
fareways and greens.
The triumph of the local players in
the team match was naturally of
great interest but Sunday events con
tributed equally to the success of the
meeting. Attention was centered in
the morning on the rivalry in the In
dividual championship. The players
who qualified in the first flight of
eight, were Corbett and Kendall, of
Tucson: Poppen and Ziesemer. of Bis
tee; Vance, of El Paso; Houck. of
Douglas, and Bannister, of Globe.
When the struggle had narrowed
down to four players, Vance won
from Corbett and Kendall from Ziese
mer. A gallery composed of both men
and women watched the final play be
tween Vance and Kendall. On the
first round of nine holes, Vance se
cured a lead of four up. On the
eighth hole of this round, his tee shot
placed him well np the fareway and
his second with a brassie found him
about ten yards from the green. Ken
dall was within i. few feet of the cup
with his third sho( with a four prac
tically assured. Vance chose a mash
ie for. the approach and pitched the
ball into the cup for a three, two be
low bogey. Vance maintained his lead
In the second round and won the In
di idirol championship of the Associa
tion for the second time.
Douglas came to the fore in the sec
ond and third flights of players, the
events being won respectively by
Robinson and French. Poppen, of
Bistee, won the first flight in the con
solation and also won the cup present

tion that this should be a war with
out victory. Both the entente reply
to the President's note and the sup
plementary statement emphasized the
belief that an allied ictoiy over so
called German militarism and lust for
conquest was essential to any kind of
world well-being. The allies have in
dicated that they believe the greatest
moral value that will come from the
war would be that of a victory over
force and disregard of int-rnut.Vmal
treaties.
Demands Freedom of Sea
The demand for the freedom of the
seas, while indefinite, is expected to
cause resentment in Englasd, where
jit will be pointed out that that has
been Germany s cniei rallying cry
since England entered the war.
Throughout, England has maintained
that the seas are indeed free, that her
navy does not contain the menace of
a vast land military system, and that
it is essential to far-flung empire. The
central powers are expected to find an
indirect criticism in the contrast of
their offer of a conference to that

C CLASS LEAGUES
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Jan. 22. The bars of
the baseball players' fraternity have
been lowered to admit Class B and C
leagues, it. was announced here today
by David Fultz, president of the or
ganization. Hitherto only Class A
leagues have been admissable, be
said.. President Fultz said that the
application for admission of a Class
B, league had been received and ac
cepted.
WILSON PLAN IS
SOULOFPEAGE
with his state
ment "that the entente powers have
replied much more opportunity for a
discussion of peace which officials here
had every reason to believe they
would welcome.
There is an absolute refusal here,
however, to enter into any discussion
of the details of the address on the
ground that the big principle Involv
ed should be left as clear as possibel
without confusing it in side issues.
Terms Left Flexible
Its phrases are understood to have
been left rather undecided in some
sections in order to be as flexible to
different shades of op!nr'jn and desire
as was the entente statement of terms
in the note to the President.
Most of the argument is expected
abroad with all kinds of double inter
pretations on that section dealing with
the-necessity of government resting
on the consent of the governed and
the desirability jf passing people back
and forth from sovereignity to another
as the restoration of Alsace-Lorraine
to France and returning to Italy of
Trentino, Rumania for Transylvania or
Austria for parts of Serbia. Bulgaria
for parts of Rumania is certain l'j be
widely discussed.
Asks No Disammament
Mention of disammament as the
most practical question of the note,
caused surprise in some circles as
President Wilson has not been an ad
vocate of disarmament The President
speaks of the "common strength" op
nosed tt) the "individual strength" of
nations and no less than 13 times he
mentions the word "guarantee" or a
cognate. This implication of some
kind of force behind his proposal,
whether physical or economic, is ex
pected to bring about deep 'opposition
nn the part of manffy peace organiza
tons, such as the American Peace So
ciety, the World Court League" and
"thers that are already committed to
world reorganization based only on

18. They feel that in a statement j'
position as full as the Presidents
both sides may feel they have unjust
ly attacked and as a result they look
for a bitter outburst in the more vio
lent press.
It Is Soul of Coming Peace
The greatest confidence is fen
here that the belligerent peopless
want peace and that the chief ob
stacle to an early peace is the un-
certainty as to whether that peace
that as soon as people abroad see
in the American actftjn a possible
means of making that peace per
manent, any first reaction to the
address will disappear, and as se
rious and friendly discussion will
follow as followed tne original
pece note.
Hits at U. S. Traditions
Administration officials expect an
tafionism in this country to any abate
ment jf the traditional policy of Am
erican isolation.
It has been felt in high official
quarters for some time that no such
fundamental change in America's for
eign policy could be taken without
decided change in the basi attitude of
public opinion and that a wide cam
paign must be undertaken by the
President before his program were to
be carried through. The present op
portunity was seen, therefore as offer
ing a very decided incidental impetus
to that end.
To Fight For New Policy
The strength of this internal Ameri-
jran opposition is said not to be under
estimated by the President as it has
already been foreshadowed in the re
cent opposition by Senators Lodge.
Dorah and others to an endorsement
of the President's original note. With
the policy that is recognized as more
revolutionary than any in foreign af
fairs since President Monroe enun
ciated his famous doctrine nd indeed
with wider possibilities than possibly
any other step in American history
the administration Is preparing for a
formidable and a conscientious strug
gle transcending ordinary political
hounds.

CONGRESSIONAL ECONOMY.
The high cost of paper has now struck congress, and
the result is an unexpected spasm of economy. A senate
bill favorably reported contemplates reductions in the
volume of congressional printing which will effect a sav
ing of $$3,000 a year on paper alone, and a total saving
of $469,000 a year.
There are to be fewer documents reprinted, and tiie
Congressional Record is to be curtailed by omission of
long and unnecessary newspaper and magazine articles
with which it is usually loaded. The congressional di
rectory is to be abbreviated to the extent of 150 pages.
Congressmen are to pay for embossing their own letter
heads and envelopes. They are to pay the cost of their
franked envelopes and slips used for mailing speeches
and other public matter. Duplications are to be avoided,
and there is to be a general elimination of waste.
All these are excellent reforms. The process might
be carried still further, benefitting the Congressional
Record by severer restrictions, and limiting congress
men's mailing privilege, thereby saving postal expense
as well as printing bills. '
In congress, more perhaps than anywhere else, econ
omy should begin at home. If the congressmen them
selves undertake to save money on the expenses of gov
ernment with which they are personally concerned in
their every-day life, maybe they'll develop a habit of
economy that will save the nation hundreds of millions
a year. There's plenty of opportunity in that direction.
OUR CARTAGE BILL.
In a recent address to the Philadelphia Chamber of
Commerce, Secretary Redfield'of the federal commerce
department made a surprising statement that our na
tional "cartage bill" is five to ten times as "great as our
freight bill.
If that estimate is anywhere near correct, we are
spendng from $12,500,000,000 to $25,000,000,000 a year
merely for carting tilings around on short local hauls.
Compared with that, all the money collected by all our
railroads for all services together is trivial.
Here's the way it works. Mr.. Redfield remarked that
it "'costs more to take a barrel from the warehouse to
the railway in Philadelphia than it does to transport it
from Philadelphia to Chicago."
The evil is seen at its worst in the big cities, and the
bigger the city the more absurdly disproportionate is
the cartage expense. A New York merchant says that
it costs more to deliver a case of goods from the lower
end of Manhattan Island to Brooklyn, just across the
river, than it costs to ship the same goods to the Philip
pine Islands; .that it costs as much to ship a barrel of
potatoes from downtown Manhattan to uptown Manhat
tan as it does to ship them from Norfolk, Va., to New
York.
While the nation has been making a great fuss about
railroad freight rates, says Mr. Redfield, we've been
"wasting at the bunghole." Railroad transportation is,
everything considered, one of the cheapest things in
America. Cart or truck transportation is, everything
considered, the dearest. The railroads are making all
j the money they deserve to make, with existing rates.
But it is an argument for serious consideration of our
non-railroad hauling problem. If we spent in a concert
ed, nation-wide effort to reduce the cost of carting com
modities around our cities half the effort we've spent in
keeping freight rates down, we might save as much as
our entire freight bill amounts to. And the saving would
nearly all go to the consuming public. All commodities
would cost less.
A FORCEFUL CITIZEN.
The Arizona Daily Star pays the following tribute to
one of the industrial leaders of the Warren District:
"Captain John C. Greenway, the real hero of the rescue
of the two American avaitors who were lost in the wilds
of northwestern Bonora, is the sort of a man's man fiat
the heart warms to. He is the sort of man of whom
Arizonans are proud. When there's a big thing to be
done opportunity has a way of commandeering him. She
does not knock indifferently at his door or promelock
with a take-it-or-leave-it insouisance. She puts on her
galoshes, grabs a dark lantern and rouses him for the
man's size job. When the military was mourning the
aviators as lost. Captain Greenway was directing a fine
comb search for the luckless airmen from his headquart
ers at Ajo. And it would have been contrary to the
usual had he not found them. Several years ago Captain
Greenway, having for the time being caught up witli his
craving for work, went to Europe to while away a few
weeks. It would seem that London would have been a
pretty good place to lose his identity in the crowd, hut
opportunity found Jiim and put him to work heroic
work and the cable news told how he had rescued hap
less guests at the hotel where he was staying, from death
in a fire. It is not only in doing opportunity's emergency
jobs, such as we have recounted, that Captain Green
way measures up to the full stature of a man's man.
Even his work as the Sirector of development of great
mining projects is romantic. But it isn't magic. It's jnst
seeing clearly and doing things thoroughly insight and
foresight energized by a love of work.' '
UNDER-SIZED FURNITURE.
We have read innumerable complaints in recent years
from women dissatisfied with the arrangements of house
hold plumbing. They want their kitchen sinks higher,
their gas jets lower, their ovens level with their arms
instead of their ankles, numerous other adaptations of
household equipment to feminine physique that the old
time, unliberatcd woman never dared dream of. Now
comes a corresponding wail, from a masculine critic. An
editorial writer in the New York Mail wants to know
why- the persons ho manufacture household furniture
don't make it big enough for a full-grown man, instead
of "catering to undersized humans."
The present-day chiffonier, le says, is a thing of tor
ture to a man of decent size. "If he wishes to look into
a glass as be combs or brushes his hair, the highest re
flection he gets is of his brisket or neck. To get a peep
at his face he has to tilt the glsas, and nine times out
of ten the glass will not remain tilted."
When that same decent-sized man undertakes to bathe,
he has to climb into a tub made for a Liliputian. When
p goes to bed he can't stretch his legs to comfortable
length unless he hangs his feet over the foot or 'sleeps
diagonally on a wide bed. There's much trouble, too,
the critic might have pointed out, about chairs and
couc'ies.
- All this is lamentable indeed. What happiness can
there be in life for the full-sized man in a world of under-sized
furniture? We hope the furniture makers will
do something about it.
TETHELIN CONTROL.
Some of Alice's. adventures in Wonderland seem to In
coming true. According to a more or less accurate report,
a professor of biochemistry in Bcrckley, Cal., is said to
have isolated tethelin. Tethelin, though we may not
have been aware of the fact previously, is a most im
portant "substance produced in the anterior lobe of the
pituitary body" at the base of the brain. It is supposed
to control corporal growth.
From this point on there are a good many "if's" in the
btory. If this tethelin has really been "isolated", and if
the professors really know as much about its properties
as they think they do. and if they ran control its opera
tions after they -set it isolated, thou marvelous things
may be accofnplishcd.
Muscles may be developed symmetrically, inches may '
THE WHITE SLAVE LAW.
The supreme court, passing judgment on the celebrated
Caminetti case, has approved the Mann "white slave
traffic act." That is, the court has pronounced it legal,
establishing the fact that congress has power to enact
such a law. With the question as to whether br not it
is a good law from the standpoint of common sense or
public morals, the court has nothing to do. But its opin
ion is evident enough.
The. court holds that though the law may have been
intended to apply only to commercialized vice, and not
to individual escapades, it must be taken at its face
value, and the wording of it plainly makes it applicable !
to both classes of offenses. It is admitted that this in-
terpretation makes the law lend itself to the purposes '
of blackmail. In fact, that has been its chief effect the
actual abridgement of interstate "white slave traffic" has
been neglibile. But such a defect, says the court, is for
congress itself to remedy.
It's a good lesson fop the nation's law-makers. It
doesn't matter how good their intentions may have
iH-en. They must put their intentions into language that
means what it was meant to mean. They must learn
how to write laws accurately. And when it becomes evi
dent that they have made a mistake, as they have in this
case, they should have the moral courage to admit their
error and amend the law.

Would Parcel Europe
He specifically mentioned that the
statesman of all the belligerents have
agreed that there sh'juld be a "a unit
ed, independent and autonomous Po
land," but his words were construed
to apply to Alsace-Lorraine, Belgium,
the Italian portions of Austria and the
mixed nationalities of the Balkans as
well.
Some of the senators who disagreed
with the .President openly referred to
this port.'jn of his address as "an at
tempt to parcel out Europe," and an
i interference in the affairs of the east
ern hemisphere.
Equal Rights, His Aim
Nevertheless, the President went
exhaustively into that phase of his
proposal. saying, "the world can be at
peace only if life is stable and there
can be no stability where the will is
in rebellion, where there is not tran
quility or spirit, and a sense ot jus
tk-e, of freedom and of .right
"Equality or territory Vr of re
sources of course, cannot be, nor any
other sort of equality not gained in
the ordinary peaceful and legitimate
disposition of the peoples themselves.
But no one asks or expects anything
more than an equality of rights. Man
kind is iVoking. now for freedom ol
life: not for equities of power."
Dealing with the question of arma
ments, which he declared to be "the
niost immediate and intense practical
question connected with the future for
tunes of nations, and of mankind,"
tha President declared there could be
assurance of safety if great arma
ments were to be built up and main
tained and that, difficult as the ques
tion might be, it must be faced with
the greatest cand'jr, "and decided in
a spirit of real accommodation."
Previously the I'resident had touch
ed upon a collateral point when he
said:
WOULD FORCE PEACE
"Mere agreements may not
make peace secure. It will be ab
solutely necessary that a force be
created as a guarantor of the per
manency of the settlement, so
much greater than the force of
any nation now engaged or any
alliance hitherto formed or pro
jected, that no nation, no probable
combination of nations, cculd face
or Aithsland it. If the pesoe
pt isenliy io be made is xo endure,
it must be a peace made secure
.by the organized major force of
mankind."
.This declaration called to the minds
of the hearers the statement of Au
thur Balfour, British l'jrei.nn minister,
in his recent note which said an in
ternational sanction for peace should
be backed by a force which "would
give, pause to t'ae hardiest assressor."
No Action Now

and even senators who did not agree
with the suggestions advanced foi
world peace did not question the
President's right to suggest them noi
io enler into negotiations tending to
commit the United States to such a
policy.
Republicans, such as Senators
Lodue and IV.irah, who are members of
tne foreign relations committee, would
not comment on the message. One of
the Republican leaders asserted that
the I'resident had full authority to
proceed along lines which he has sug
gested: that there could be no consti
tutional bar to his efforts and that
such a league for peace as he proposed
would have to be embodied into a
treaty. It iitiht be possible for ie
President al some other time to nego
tiate such a treaty in this senator's
opinion, but to get the senate's ratifi

OIL PROMOTERS ARE
FASTER THAN COPPER
BOOSTERS, NICHOLS
Prescott Mining Promoter
Says Arizona Schemes Take
Second Place When Okla
homa Artists Are Around.
Arizona people 'think that the min
ing promoter is ab'jut the fastest
working "artist" in his business and
declare, ofliines with doleful manner
ami glance, that its high time the
Htaie was taking a hand in the matter
and protecting the "poor working
god." But copper promoters are as
cnildren to Sandows in the promotion
game when experts from the Okla
homa Diltiekls are considered, accord
ing to C. F. Nich'jls, Prescott promo
ter and heavy stockholder in the Yer
de Apex.
Nichols has just returned from a
trip tnrough the oilfields of Oklahoma
and 'Kansas and brings back tidings
of golden streams of actual money
being taken from the ground in bar
rels instead jl ore cars. It's the real
boom country, declares the mining
man, and Tulsa is its capital.
"With oil at $1.90 a barrel and new
oil districts being opened up rapidly
there is little wonder that the people
of Oklahoma. Texas, Kansas and Mis
souri have gone 'hog wild' over the
securities of these ventures," said
Nichols last evening. "Every town in
the Oklahoma oilheld is fairly running
over with ' piA)ple. Accommodations
are at a premium.
"For many mouths Jerome was sup
posed to be the hardest place to find
a room in the country, for the tran
sient. On day, not long ago, I ar
rived in Tulsa. Tulsa is a town of
nearly 50,000 people. It has a mat
ter of thirty hotels and during my
stay there, one night, 300 people
slept in the railroad station. Jerome,
with its band stand for accommoda
tions, will certinly have to go some to
approximate that record."
K. C. Stock Exchange
One ol the greatest things for Okla
homa oils and Arizona and other
Southwestern mining stocks will be
the opening of the Kansas City stock
exchange, according to Nichols. The
Prescott man says some of the capi
talists, who own the El Tigre in So
nora, are largely responsible for the
new market. This will give another
outlet i'jr the coppers of Arizona and
will aloo bring the oil and copper in
terests closer together than they have
been in the past.
Jerome Snowed In
During the last several days Yava
pai county has experienced a very
heavy snow fall, declares Nichols, and
Jerome is contemplating the adoption
of snow- shoes and skies as the best
method of locomotion. Along the main
line of the Santa Fe, in northern Ari
zona, the railroad has employed snow
plows to break a way through the
drifts for its trains.
"Though there has been a tempor
ary lull In the interest in coppers,"
said Nichols last evening, "I am of i
the opinion that the demand will be
as great or even .larger than before.
The 'operations in the Jerome field
have been discounted to a large ex
tent but this action has not caused a
"essation in development activities in
that field."
Nichols will remain here several
days conferring with R. A. Dill and
Dthers interested in the Verde Apex.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 23, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Jan. 22. Storks wore
moderately- unsettled during tho first
half of today's session by the an
nouncement that President Wilson
would address tho United Statf-s sen
ate on Impending international devel
opments. Early gains of from one
to two points in specialties were
soon replaced by extreme losses of
two to four points in speculative fav
orites, with more for shippings and
Pethlehem Steel, the latter reacting
15 points.
Prices later rallied but only in a
few important roses wete full recov
eries made.
Bethlehem Steel was watched for
pome line or indication of action by
the directors at tomorrow's meeting.
United States Steel as well as Cru
cible, Lackawanna and Gulf States
steel were two to four points down
at lowest levels, with similar recess
ions in shippings and coppers.
Recessions of two to five points in
motors, petroleums. Ohio Gas, Pitts
burs Coal and Virginia Coal were
supplemented by more moderate re
versals in the leather, paper and sug
ar issues. Rails averaged one point
decline, with two points for Reading.
Acute weakness was shown by Rus
sian and Italian exchange. German
and Austrian notes also denoted weak
ness. Bonds were lower on narrow
dealings. Total sales, par value, $2.
255.000. U. S. Bonds were unchanged
on call.

was a rush to sell on hasty inferences
that President Wilson might disclose
a new crisis with Germany regarding
submarines or about the status of

Principles of Progress
That the present state of
civilization of all races is the
result of an evolutionary pro
cess is today beyond question
of doubt. One of the princi
ples of this slow form of pro
gress is the inventions which
have broken the barriers of
isolation and made as one all
the nations of earth. The rail
roads, steamships, telegraph,
etc., are prime factors, but
the public press is univer
sally recognized as one of the
greatest agents of public up
lift. It spreads the desire for
knowledge; it furnishes sub
jects for comment; it creates
an air of independence, and it
keeps the great family of hu
manity in touch." No fam
ily circle is quite complete
without a daily visitation of
one or more of the leading
papers. To supply this need
for Bisbee and the Warren
District, the Review has en
stalled the latest telegraph
system, giving you today's
news today, and keeping you
in touch with the whole world
and in "tune" with your fel
low man. Does the Daily Re
view visit your home regu

There's no sense in mixing a mess of
mustard, flour and water when you can
easily relieve pain, soreness or stiffness
with a little clean, white Musterole.
Mustcrcle is made of pure oil of mus
tard and other .helpful ingredients, com
jined in 'the form of a pleasant white
ointment. It takes the place of out-of-date
mustard plasters, and will not blister.
Musterole usually gives prompt relief

roup, stiff neck, asthma, neuralgia, head
:c'ie, congestion, pleurisy, rheumatism,
umbago, pains and aches of the back or

RHEUMATISM NOW
Says We Must Keep Feet Dry,
Avoid Exposure and
Eat Less Meat
Stay off tiie damp ground, avoid ex
posure, keep feet dry, eat le;s meat,
drink lots of water and above all take
a spoonful of salts occasionally to
keep down uric acid.
Rheumatism is reused by poisonous
toxin, called uric acid, which is gen
erated in the bowels and absorbed in
to the blood. It is the function of the
kidneys to filter this acid from the
blood and cast it out in the urine. The
poros of the skin are also a means of
freiing the blood of this immirity. lu
damp and chilly, cold weather, the
skin pores are closed.' thus forcing
the kidneys to do double work, they
bTome weak and sluggish and fail to
eliminate this uric acid which keeps
arctimuiatiiis and circulating Duuuii
the system, eventually settling in the
joints and n.usrl's, causing stiffness,
soreness and pain called rheumatism.
At Hie lirst tw ini;c of rlu-umathin
get from any pharmacy about four
ounces or Jad Salts; put a tublespoon

IWhoGetsI
the
Credit?
Some years ago prominent min
ing engineers turned oown the
United Eastern and Big Jim
ground at Oatman as being
worthless. Yet other engineers
found this ground good and two
great mines have been developed
there. Some engineers said Chili
Copper could never be made a
success. Yet, Chili Copper is a
great mine. It is an actual fact
that the United Verde turned
down the Little Daisy claim and
refused to do the assessment
work on it, which is now the Unit
ed Verde Extension (the won
, I
4
der copper mine of the world.)
There are hundreds of instances
where ,-big" engineers have turn
ed down properties which later
proved to be bonanza mines. THE
CREDIT COES TO THE ENGI
NEERS and operators who saw
the genuine attractiveness of
such properties and proved their
theories to be correct.
Someone might say to you that
ARIZONA RAY ground was dis
carded by a oreat copper compa
ny as worthless.
Just to raise a hynothetiea! ques
tion WHAT IF IT WAS?
Other engineers such as Freder
ick E. Young and J. K. Turner,
examined ARIZONA RAY ground
and found it GOOD.
On the basis, of their reoorts, the
company is steadily developing
and proving up this ground,
which these engineers say has al
ready been practically proved up
on three sides by the operations
of other companies. When these
operations bring a real mine into
being.
I
ARIZONA RAY
GETS THE CREDIT
Engineers who have achieved rep
utations as mine makers have re
ported favorably on ARIZONA
RAY grcund. We believe this
ground will eventually be mined
as profitably as the property of
the Ray Consolidated and Ray
Hercules. The compary is actu
ally mining. Now then,
WE WANT YOU TO HELP
WE WANT YOU TO GET SOME
OF THE CREDIT
WE WANT YOU TO CET SOME
OF THE PROFIT.
We believe ARIZONA RAY is the
most promising of all the young
Arizona Coppers; that when prop
erty and price of stock are con- 1
sidered it offer the greatest op
portunities for profit of any of the
young Arizona Coppers.
'.
Write us or call at our office for
complete data, maps, etc., which
will help you to understand why
we believe in ARIZONA RA.
We believe that you will also be
'lieve in Arizona Kay after you
have received complete, first-hand
information concerning it. Don't
forget that the success of ARI
ZONA RAY is such that it makes
some other people jealous. But
we can't help that.
Buy Arizona Ray at the Market.

President Wilson has taken it upon
himself to outline the after-the-war
policy he thinks we should pursue.
This declaration must be character
ized as notable and perhaps epoch
making. New York American
The President says the truth. There
must be no more "sovereignty'' of the
seas. Neutrals must never again be
asked to submit to the intolerable in
solence which has marked the con
duct of the belligerents toward the
commerce of neutral states with each
other and with the belligerents them
selves. New York World
Our own belief is that President
Wilson has enunciated the broad prin
ciples of liberty and justice upon
which alone a durable peace is possi
ble and under which the democracy
of the world can ultimately come in
to its own. The influence which the
President's address exerts upon Ku
rope will depend in a very large meas
ure, upon influence which it exerts at
