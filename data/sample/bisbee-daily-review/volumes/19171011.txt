Mexicans crossed the international
line near here shortly after noon to
day, captured Sergeant Michael Za
broksy and Private W. B. Vincent, of
a cavalry command encamped hero,
who were duck hunting near the line,
and placed them in an adobe house
at Zaragosa, Mexico, five miles up
the river from here.
Later they leaped from a window
and escaped to the American side
with the Mexicans in close pursuit.
They left their shotguns behind. They
had been hunting on the "San Eliza

which lies on the south side of the
Rio Grande, but on the American
side of the boundary.
Raid Proceedea Capture.
The capture and escape of the two
soldiers followed a raid yesterday
afternoon on three American ranches
located on the "island." Twelve
horses were taken from these ranches
and they were driven across the line
by the armed Mexicans. Two of the
Mexican raiders were captured by
patrols.
Large Force Located.
A large armed and mounted force
has been located opposite here near
Cuadalupe, Mexico,, but the army of
ficers have been unable to discover
whether they are Mexican federal
soldiers or bandits although the cap
tured two soldiers said their captors
wore the regulation Mexican army
uniforms.

John C. Greenway, brevet captain
of Theodore Roosevelt's famous
Rough Rider regiment in the Spanish
American war, general manager of
the Calumet and Arizona mining in
terests in the state of Arizona, in
cluding the New Cornelia Copper
company and the Gadsden Copper
company, has been commissioned a
major in the United States army, en
gineer corps. This information was
received in Bisbee yesterday by W.
B. Gohring, mine superintendent of
the C. and A.
The wire is a follows:
"Have joined the army as major of
engineers. Expect to sail in 15 days.
Will return to Arizona on the 14:.'i
for four or five days. Regards to
you and all my friends.
"JOHN C. GREENWAY."
Major Greenway, since the declara
tion of hostilities between Germany
and the United tSatea, has been anx
ious to join the colors of this nation.
When Col. Theodore Roosevelt sought
to raiie a division for service in
France, Greenway was picked as a
colonel for one cf the regiments.
When the offer of the former presi
dent was declined, the Bisbee man
did not cease to hope to be used
abroad.
As fast as possible, Greenway com
pleted several large projects, which
.ie had under his direction; the most
notable one being the starting of the
leaching plant of the New Cornelia it
Ajo. Some weeks ago he left for the
east and the telegram of yesterday,
dated at Washington, is the answer
to his absence.
The board of directors of the C. and
A. company will arrive in Bisbee some
time next week, it is thought, for the
purpose of taking some action on the
pending absence of Major Green
way. Undoubtedly an acting geneial
manager will be named while the
beard is in sessino iere.

Thus far all sessions have been held

WASHINGTON. Oct. 10. Few dis
patches since the war beean have
created more interest at the n.ivy de
partment than today's report from
Amsterdam telling of a revolt in the
German navy. Officers unhesitating
ly declared that the story, so far not
confirmed in official reports, was one
of the most encouraging signs of the
year for the allies and probably one
of the most ominous from the Ger
man view. They pointed out that
while the allied powers have note.I
repeatedly recently in their official
' statements, that the morale of the
1 German troops was declining and ob
i servers have believed that the end
i would come in food anl labor riots or
perhaps in a political revolt, there
; has been nothing to suggest that the
j iron discipline of the German mill
I tary system had lost it hold over
fighting millions in the slightest de-
gree.
Declining 'Morale.
The declining morale on the west
, era front noted, it was stated, ha
shown itself in the feeble character
of counter attacks as compared to
j the all but irresistible drive a year
l ago. Assault after assault has dash
: ed itself to pieces before the French
1 and British trenches.
The revolt in the navy, these offi
cers said, was a more serious matter
for Germany. The sailors generally
have not been subjected to the batter
ing of the guns day after day. month
after month. They insisted that if
there is discontent among the sailors
with their condition, it must foe evT
greater in the army.
No Publicity Hurts.
' A' one Pss'b'e explanation of the
navy revolt, they pointed out that ever
since submarine warfare was started
by the Germans, the British have
adopted ihe consistent policy of sup
pressing Information as to the fate
of the submarines sent to the bottom
by their patrols. The policy was
a.lc.pted as deliberate method of
breaking down the morale of the sub
marine crews.

of the war, when she bore alone the
brunt of the Prussian war machine
while England was getting ready. It
is estimated that there will be 300,
000 French children to mourn for
their fathers fallen in battle before
the war is done. If the war works a
hardship upon us in many ways in
this great, rich country so far from j

must be in stricken France. Fuel and
food are grievously high over there. )
Thousands upon thousands of French-
men wno were canea to me coiors ;
left penniless families behind, who
were absolutely dependent upon them
for support.
As soon as these conditions became
generally known in America there
was a response. Many thousands of
these war orphans have been adopted j
and permanent funds for their sup
port subscribed. The heroic and won-
derful defense of Verdun by the j
French legions, while it increased the
total of war orphans to terrible pro J
portions, also aroused America to a;
frenzy of admiration for the breve i
men who stopped the German crown
prince's hordes dead in their tracks.
French bravery in this war h!s reach

average good American family to say,

cause. These letters will have a touch
that cold his'ory cannot give. Direct
from the heart they will come, and
they will be priceless possessions of
this city.
The work of caring for these French
orphans and handling and administer- j
ing the funds has been organized i
along most thorough lines by great
men an(j WOmcn of both countries. It
js a great trust and is as free from j
blemish as the love and kindness that !
inspired it.
it has been es;imated that 10 cents I
a aay will care lor a rTencn orpnan.
This means S3 a month, or 136.50 a I
year. It means that the French mo-1
ther can keep her child with her and
under her guidance,! and care. It means j
that in helping these French children j
we are helping our own lit'.l ones by i
instilling into them the great lesson
o? unselfishness and doing for others, j
The letters to and fro give the per- j
sonal touch and the in'erest between!
the children here and their little
French brothers and sisters beyond !
the sea. The Bisbee children will be!
moved to deny themselves little lux- j
uries in order that home and happi
ness may be the lot of the French :
orphans.
The work is far reaching and vast I
in its scope. It will be promoted
through the schools and by entertain
ments, and by every expedient and j
plan that kindly hearts and loving j
thoughts can suggest. j
To care for 15 French orphans is
well, but Bishee will do. much more
:i.an that. The iirvt practical part
kiddies whose fathers sleep uuoer
wooden crosses in fields that will be
famous forever.

NORTHERN COUNTIES

STRONG FOR BIG LOAN
Yavapai, Apache, Coconino,
Navajo and Mohave Will
Oversubscribe Their Quota
of Loan, is Declaration.
(Special to Daily Review.)
PHOENIX, Arix., Oct. 10. Declaring
that the five counties Of Northern Ariz
ona will greatly over-subscribe the
amount allotted to them in the Liberty
Loan campaign, H. D. Ai ken, who has
charge of Yavapai, Mohave, Coconino.
Apache and Navajo, counties, was in
Phoenix yesterday in conference with
the members of the executive commit
tee. Plans r-jr united and vigorous ac
tion in the north were discussed and
will be immediately put in action. Mr.
Aitken was enthusiastic in his appeal
to the people of Arizona to contribute
liberally to the fjan fund.
"Men, munitions and money these
are the sinews of war," he declared.
At the present time the greatest need
of the United States government is
money. She must have it to render
the best possible help ID herself and
the allies.
"To put the burden of our share in
this struggle for democracy as far as
possible on the present generation,
rather than shift it to our children, is
the government's avowed intention.
"Our congress has very sensibly
vted to expend large sums at once so
that the war may be brought to a
successful and early termination. This
is not only a wise economy, but will
result in saving many human lives.
"To raise this money the govern
ment has issued Liberty Bonds for
which we must subscribe. These
bonds bear a 4 per cent rate of inter
est, and mature in twenty-five years.
Back of them stands the entire weaUh
of our Uniled States.
"At the present rate of interest the
Liberty Bonds afford an opporutni'y
for safe investment with reasonable
profit. But even if they did not, in
the words of Jay Cook, 'what we need
Is patriotism and not money making.'
In this second Liberty Loan of 1917.
the government has combined both.
"Buying a Liberty Bond at this time
is t'Jund business. It is an investment
which has for its security the entire
riches of our nation. It is our patri
otic duty to do that which is now with
in our power and which counts for
most at this time."
SALT RIVER VALLEY
DAIRYING INDUSTRY
EFFECTED COTTON
Turning Over of Alfalfa Land
to the Growing of Cotton
Has Decreased Activity In
the Raising of Milk Cattle.
Phoenix. Ariz.. Qt. 10. The trans
fer of about 35.000 acres or alfalfa
and grass pasturage within the Salt
River Valley t'J use in growing of cot
ton has had serious effect upon the
dairy industry in this locality. An
other factor is the keen demand known
for forage for draught-stricken Texas
and for the army camps. The Salt
River Valley supplies most of the but
ter used in Arizona and the supply of
late has hardly been equal to the de
mand. In addition, the milk condens
ing plant at Tempe, lately has afford
ed a profitable "jutlet for the milk of
the valley's 70.000 cows. A similar
plant of even large capacity, now is
being erected at Glendale, both to be
operated by the Amour interests of
Chicago, which purchased the Tempe
plant during the summer. One item of
the demand, is the late order for 20,000
cases of condensed milk, for use in
the army camps, while all surplus for
sometime past is understood t'j have
been going to Europe.
From the National Food Administra
tion have come some remarkable fig
ures concerning dairy exports. Be
fore the war, condonsed milk exports
averaged 17,792,57'J pounds a year, for
the last fiscal year, they reached 6fi,
0S7.2i:i. Butter experts jumped up
from 4.457,155 to 2S.835.n92. Cheese ex
ports rose from 3,7SS.nfi5 to tirt.0S7.213.
Possibly significant is the fact that
Holland took 84.9 per cent of the milk
shipped to European neutrals, and
there is little doubt that Germany
profited to some ex.eiit. During the
past year, tbe world's supply of cattle
decreased by more than 28.000.000
head, mainly in England, France and
Germany, and Holland is expecied to
sacrifice her herds through the lute
embargo on fodder.

British Holding
Lines Captured
(Continued From Page One.)
French armies who yesterday made
such a spectacular assault over the
llnaders bog lands against the Ger
man defenses east and north of Ypres
were digging themselves in today
along a line that represents an impor
tant gain. But the never-ending
reaches of almost bottomless mul had
during the last 24 huors robbed Field
Marshal Haig's men of some of the
laurels which they had won in such
a remarkable manner.
Ground impassable
Over much of the front involved
the small bodies of hardy pioneers,
who floundered forward through mer
ciless morasses to the most forward
positions that were reached had been
forced to fall back and rejoin their
comrades on the mam line of the ad
vance. In some places this was due
in part to German counterattacks, but
for the main part tne terrible condi
tion of the ground was responsible.
Even those rain-drenched, mud
caked, weary men were still reaching
out for more ground. Late reports
toid of bodies of infantry that were
far beyond the line which now Is
claimed as definitely held. -What they
may achieve only another day cad
tell.
The French Line
The French line tci'ay was still
nestled firmly almost at the edge ot
the great Houthoulst wood, and the
poilus had even improved their luu
somewhat during the niiiht. On their
immediate right the British also were
established in positions some 2000
yards in advance of their jumping-olT
place of yesterday. They had surged
forward to a line aboitt 500 yards em
way and had maintained several vig
orous counter-attacks.
, Counter-Attacks
The Germans delivered heavy counter-attacks
at the Juncture of the Brit
ish and French armies early in the
day, but the allied ar;i!!ery caught
ihe attacking troops and smashed the
attempt.
The ground immediately in front
of the British left and the French
right wing was so wet that the Ger
mans made no attempt to occupy it
permanently. For this reason the al
lies here had a comparatively quiet
night.
Hard Fighting
Just north of the Ypres-Staden rail
way there was hard fighting yester
day morning near the St. Chcmin.i
farm. The British forced the Germans
aut of the latter place, but were un
successful counter-attacked almost at
ence. Hard fighting still continued
sbout the brewery in the eastern
"nvirons of Poelcapelle.
Withdrawal
South of Poelcapelle the British
early pushed through to a depth of
100 yards or more, but owing mainly
o the condition of the ground were
forced to withdraw somewhat from
the most advanced positions they ha1
Uained. In this region the infantry
had to cross the Lakkerboterbeek and
Stroombeeke rivers.
The British advanced in a thin line
toward the German positions, which
were thickly held here. As the Brit
ish struggled miserably in the deep
mire the Germans poured a heavy
machine gun fire into the advanced
line. The German counter-attarked
almost enimednately and the Bii'ish
withdrew slightly.
The German troops here continually
harassfd by sniping from shell hob's
and from platforms built in .the few
remaining trees.
Ravebeek River Crossed
West of Passchenclaele the Bri'ish
troops had crossed the Ravrhk riv
er, and here as in other places the
men often were up to ttfir necks in
mud and water. The main advantage
secured in this section was the estab
'ishment of a line on the German side
if the river.
Hard fighting was encountered in a
few places, notably at the Yaf'a
houses and the Wolf farm. The as
sured gain in this sector appears to
be from about 400 to 700 yards in
lepth.
Reutel was taken over yesterday
by English troops. The ruins of the
hamlet apparently were not occupied I
by the Germans, but the latter made
a sti fffight with machine guns in the
juniper wood.

OPPORTUNITY FOR
BUSINESS WOMEN j
AT NiGHT SCHOOL!
i
Government Making Appeals ;
to "Fill Civil Service Posi-
tions Vacated By Men.
A patriotic appeal to women appears
In the current Issue of the Ladies'
HMme Journal under the caption, ' Wo
men wanted at Good ray." It is an ap
peal for women to learn stenography
and typewriting, and enter the Civil
Service, the sponsor of which is Dr.
Anna Shaw, chairman of the Woman's
committee of the National Council of
Defense at Washington.
There is a special reason why Hhis
appeal can be met with a hearty re
sponse by women in Eisboe. The
nieht school at the high school is con
ducting classes in stenography and
typewriting;, as well as in Spanish, me
chanical and the allied commercial
subjects. A large number are already
availing themselves of the opportuni
ties offered there. In view of the
above mentioned appeal, a special ef
fort will be made to accommodate as
many more as possible.
Best Instruction.
The instruction, so far as practic
able, embodies the methods now used
at the Gregg school in Chicago, which
is the national headquarters, not only
of Gregg shorthand, but of Ra.ional r
Touch typewriting. The latest edition
of the Rational typewriting manual is
the basis of instruction. This manual
contains a section devoted to the civil
service: and it can be definitely- an
nounced that when that phase of the
course is reached, the work outlined
In the manual will be supplemented
with the Erst hand experience of
teachers wh'o have successfully passed
the civil service examination for the
departmental service at Washington.
Demand Exceeds Supply.
The requirements of the civil ser
vice far exceed the supply. By fie
end of the firs: year of the, war, there
will be one hundred thousand addition
al employes in the civil service. The
filling of these positions by women will
release more men for the field. Wo
men are now paid the same salaries as
men in the civil service. The begin-,
ning salary in niVst cases is $1,000. Out
of 366 women employed in the depart
ment of commerce, only 54, and most
of them scrub women, receive less
than $900 a year each. The secretary
of the navy has announced that women
will be given preference in those posi
tions open to both men and women.

that almost all of the Warren Dis
trict men at Fort Riley have takeu

The position of draftsman, heretofore
open to men only, has recently been
i thrown open to women. On account
' of the war, siate governments are also
employing more people. Ten states
have civil service commissions, and se
lect their employes in the same man
ner as does the federal government.
! Good Opportunity.
i P.y taking shorthand and typewrit
ing, women are not only eligible to civ-
. il service positions, both national and
slate, but also to the vacancies arising
in commercial, industrial and other
lines on account of men leaving for the
jiational army. These positions are
likewise available to the men whj are
not draf :ed. They, too, will he called
upon to fill vacancies created by the
departure of men io fight in the field.
Fine positions at good pay are opening

pared. It has been suggested that

had some difficulty passing the physi

MAJOR GREENWAY.
Bisbee views with pride the patriotism and devotion
or another well known citizen who has left wide business
interests to serve his country In France. Captain John
Greenway, general manager of the C. and A. mining
properties in this state, has at last realized his soldier
ambition. The former rough-rider chafed in the halls
of peace, no matter how gay they glittered with the dec
orations of success, when the old war game was afoot
in that wonderful land of la Belle France. The captain
is a major now. He will leave In two weeks with the
engineering corps for the western battle front. And
of the many of the flower of this land who have gone
and who will go in the days to come, none will be bet
ter fitted by training, experience and natural attain
ments to win renown In this great and terrible game
than Captain John Greenway, master of his mine, brave
soldier, good comrade, gallant gentleman and Arizonan
par excellence from the crown of his Stetson hat to
the soles of his yellow riding boots. "
THOSE INVINCIBLE PRUSSIANS.
When we read how the British shopkeepers and
clerks and workingmen and farmers are beating the
Prussians in Flanders we thrill at the triumph of De
mocracy. And the French poilus who have fought the
best the kaiser had to stand still, these peasants from
the provinces and gamin and idlers and artists and cab
drivers and Idlers and merry makers from Paris. We
thrill again at the greatness of Republican France when
the Prussian war machine invaded her fairest valleys
from Lille to the Arragonne. "But there is nothing new
under the sun. This same identical thing happened in
almost the same place more than a hundred years ago.
When the French revolutionists had beheaded the
last of their Burbon kings and seized the reins of gov
ernment, the kings and prices of Europe were prompt
to declare war on the new Republic that menaced their
God-given right to rule supreme. At that time Prussia,
as now, was conceded to have the greatest war machine
in the world. Frederick the Great's wonderful army
of grenadiers was still intact And the Prussian king
begged for and was given the privilege of crushing this
monster of Democracy that had just been born in France.
The Prussian army advanced with banners flying and
bands playing, headed straight for Paris. It would make
short work of these ragmufflans and rebels and murder
ers. Its equipment was perfecl. Its artillery was most
formidable. Its discipline was matchless. In fine, the
same thoroughness prevailed in Prussia then as regard
ed things military that prevailed there to this day. But
this splendid army was turned back in that same valley
of the Marne.
French revolutionists mustered from shop and office
and forge -and inn and Paris streets went out and fought
one of the decisive battles of the world at Valmy with
the Prussian hosts and beat them in a standup battle.
The Prussian king marched his beaten army back again
and the French Republicans maintained their govern
ment until the great Napoleon came along and had him
self made emperor of the French.
But at Valmy was had the first great test between
trained soldiers of a king and patriot batallions inflam
ed by the new breath of liberty. Dumouriez and Kellar
man, two most skilfull generals, commanded the French
army at this battle, and they clearly outgeneralled the
Duke of Brunswick, leader of the Prussian invf ders. but
the fact remains that the French soldiers .Inspired by
liberty, at Valmy turned back the tide of defeat that had
overwhelmed French arms for many long and disastrous
years, and carried the French flag victoriously across
Europe until it was folded in defeat at Waterloo twenty
years later.
At Valmy. in the valley of the Marne, it was demon
strated the free men were better fighters than slaves.
In that same valley over one hundred years later. It
was demonstrated again republican soldiers shall prevail
against the soldiers of a king.
The man who conies forward from forge and field
and fire-place to fight for his country is a dangerous
foe-nan. He may not be as skilfull as the hireling of the
piefessional fighting man, but he will fight harder and
longer, and in the end he will win. Ha !s winning todaj
againet the Prussian, just as his fathers won a hundred
years ago. And his victory will be a still longer and
greater step towards a world freedom than was the vic
tory of the French republicans over Prussia at Valmy.
Only a few hundred men fell in that first fight for
freedom in Europe. Hundreds of thousands have fallen
in this last great struggle for freedom. The cause is
immortal and no price is too great to pay for its triumph.
Valmy will remain In history as a shrine of freedom
long after scores of greater and bloodier battles are for
gotten. That battle was not an army against an army
or a nation in array against a nation; it was a cause
against a cause. Therefore it sa been set down by the
wise of the ages that cane after as one of the fifteen
decisive battles of the world.
The Giants stopped the White Sox drive for the base
ball championship of the world, but the Germans will
never stop the allied drive for the democracy of the
world.
McGraw's Giants rallied and drove Comiskey's White
Sox from the second line trenches after the fiercest
sort of battle. Marshal Benton proved an invaluable
aide to the "Little Napoleon" of baseball. Today's game
will almost tell the tale.
The half-million-dollar pile of marble honoring Wil
liam McKinley has been dedicated at Niles, Ohio. It
has been over sixteen years since the gentle spirit of
that gentle man took flight, and Ohio has done well to
erect a great tribute to a great president. But McKinley
builded his own monument by leaving behind him a
clean record as a soldier, a statesman, and a man. Then,
too, his name is carved deep in the heart of every true
American. This is his finest memorial.
Halg is pushing on in spite of the rain. And on hit
left flank the French are fighting as gallantly and as
Irresistably as ever. Tuesday's smash was a terrible
blow and the German counter attacks Wednesday were
as costly as ever and gained but little for the desperate
invaders. A German withdrawal upon a large scale
seems inevitable even if the British gain no more ground.
But every indication points to a continuous offensive
until the cold weather drives the Scotch-English chief
to winter quarters.
After listening to the C. and A. band play through
an evening, one wonders If the entire personnel know
that the war is going on. Not that it isn't a gooi band;
for it is. But they are way behind times. Thj music
they render is hoary wilt age. One or two of their num
beis were popular as recently as 1915, but they luven't
e tingle air ofv the vintage of '17. "Allah's Holiday."
"Till the Clouds Roll By." "Babes In the Woods" and
even Cohen's "Over There" are already old timers ev
erywhere else in the country, but they have yet to make
their blushing bows in the district. Boy, page Mr.
Martin!
Bisbee ladies started a movement yesterday that is
as fine and touching as any since the gentle Master
wept over His children from the hills beyond Jerusalem.
They will take care of a few of the fatherless children
of France. A war orphan is a sacred charge. It is es
timated that there will be three hundred thousand of
them in stricken France by the time the war is ended.
Poor little kiddies! Devoted, grief stricken, struggling
mothers! How will they feel towards the women of far
off America who adopt them and write to them and do
for them and think of them from over the sea? Only
the angels will ever really and truly know.
Lonely Mr. Bennett. The New York Republican Com
mittee, by a vote of nearly four to one, has refused to
approve his candidacy for mayor. Thank Heaven, three
fourths of the New York Republican Committee are reg
ular he-men, and not politicans. There is absolutely no
chance for Bennett to he elected, and if he truly has the
moral bigness and fitness qualifying him for any public
office, then he should gracefully step out and ask his
friends and all good Republicans to vote for the Fusion
candidate, iJohn Purroy Mitchell. Mitchell. is the only good
mayor New York has ever had. and all good Republican:)
will vote for him anyway, irrespective of Mr. Bennett or
anything that Mr. Bennett may have to say.
In the moving picture of "The Slacker," shown in
Bisbee last week, there was not only a splendid and
practical lesson of patriotism shown, but some of the
views of the troops marching through the various cities
of t''C east thrilled the onlooker from head to foot. The
camera man who took those pictures of the Rainbow
division was a master of his art. He got them from an
angle that showed the le:.n, brown faces of the men and
the glinting sunlight on their bayonets. The white put
tees of the marching men swept down the street like &
storm. Pride was depicted in their bearing and strength
In their poise and swin,?. More than one man In the
Audience glowed all over as he watched these soldiers
of his country swing by, as natural almost as though in
flesh and blood, and the house broke forth into cheers
time and again. Many of the movie plays are overdrawn
and silly, but some of them are truly great, and there
is no doubt at all but that the silent drama is playing an
Important part in stirring the patriotism of the country
to a high pitch of devotion and enthusiasm.

AWAYS SOMETHING.
There's always something calls for
brine, if 'one's inclined to mope and
whine. The weather man provides a
day that ought to please the carping
jay; the sky is smooth, ihe breeze a
peach that murmurs through the elm
and beech. It is a day when normal
men throw up their lids and whoop
again, a day on which they grow and
thrive, and thank their gods that
they're alive. Bu you will see the
mournful hick who says such weather
makes him sick. He says the sweet
and balmy breeze is spreading mic-
l'jbes and disease. 'Tnless we soon
have snow and frost," he mutters, "we
shall all be lost." Jt is so easy to be
gay, in this old planet where we stay.
so easy to discover good in any earthly
neighborhood. It is a marvel there are
gents who still are sulking in their
tents. I go forth in the Autumn dawn
and loaf around upon my lawn, and see
a world so bright and fair, I can't be
lieve it's stocked with care. And then
my neighbor yells across, "This coun
try is a total loss! They're jacking up
the income tax until it's bound to
break our backs."
AUTO DEALERS PROTEST
TO FAIR COMMISSION
ABOUT OUTLAW RACES
Every automobile dealer and acces
sory dealer, or representative, was
present at the meeting held last night
at the salesrooms of the Babbitt-Pol
son company. The purpose of the
meeting was to protest against the
holding and staging of an "outlaw
automobile race or races during the
tate fair. M. L. Burkhead was unan
imously elected chairman and George
Purdy Bullard was one of the first
to take the floor. Mr. Bullard stated
that Secretary Zachau of the state
fair commission had made arrange
ments with Sloan Henkinson who will
furnish automobiles and drivers for
such attractions and which he said
is nothing more than an exhibition
in which there is no sport or excite
ment. It was stated that the money
paid for these races is simply a hip
podrome or carnival proposition.
Practically every dealer present
took the floor in turn and protested
against the races being held under
the auspices of the International 3i!o
tor contest association. It was brought
out that in staging such a contest or
race, the track at the fair grounds
will he disbarred from holding races
under sanction of the Arizona Auto
mobile association. It was also stat
ed that the fact that the races were
held under the auspices of the three
"A's," does not mean that the driver
must be a professional. Any amateur
can drive under sanction of the three
"A's." This is proven uy the fact
that the drivers driving at the fair
last year were all licensed three "A"
drivers, and were boys from Phoenix,
Tucson, Globe and other cities in Ar
izona and also New Mexico. Not one
professional was entered.
The dealers said they believe that
there could be no greater harm done
to the clean sport for which Phoenix
is noted, than the staging of this ex
hibition. In the past automobile day
has always been the biggest day of
the fair, people coming not only from
all over Arizona, but from Texas, New
Mexico and California. They' believe
that if the exhibition scheduled is
staged, dealers and BUtomobUe en
thusiasts from none of the cities of
Arizona will visit Phoenix on this
oay.
A committee of four was appointed
to formulate a protest which will bej
submitted to the fair commission. On
this committee ar Cal Messner, of j
the f'al Messner company; William I
Ferguson, of the Ferguson-Xieler com
pany; M. L. Burhead, of the Babbitt
Poison company, and J. J. McAleer.

These two brought about the down
fall of the Chicago combination when
' the outlook for a break In the series
of defeats was none too bright.
The Old Ball Game
For three and a half innings the
opposing boxmen had proved invinci
ble, and the thirty odd thousand fans '
were settling down for a hurling duel
when Robertson sprang into the cal
cium glare of fame. He ended the
White Sox's four inning attempt to
penetrate the piiching ot Benton with
great running catch of Gandil's lnog
sizzling drive to right field when he
hurled himself against the concrete
wall of the grandstand and plucked
the ball with one hand just as it was
about to strike the wall. Had he
missed the catch, Gandil's smash
would have gone for at least a two
base hit. But Robertson was not done.
The Norfolk player doffed his fielders' ;
glove and stepping into the batter's
box picked one of Cicotte's sharp
breaking low balls and drove it high
and far into the right center.' The.
sphere sailed upward and onward un
der the force of the blow until it
seemed certain that It would equal
Flesch's home-run drive of the open
ing game. Both JaVkson and Felsch
raced frantically after the ball, but it
hit the bleacher fence and bounded
away from their clutches. Robertson
was sliding into third base when the
ball was returned to the infield.

The Giants had live men up in their
half of the first and tw'j were left on
the bags. Burns, first up, fanned. Her
zog caught one of Cicotte's benders on
the end of his bat and lifted it to
Felsch. Benny Kauff sent the second
ball pitched on the fly to John Collins

and let it drop. The error looked dam

flied to Felsch who made a quick re
turn to the plate and held Holke at
third. Rariden took second on the

ond time.
The White Stat went out in order in
the third.
Collins Again Errs.
Cicotte fouled out to Rariden. John
Collins' time at bat was prolonged
when Holke dropped his high foul.
Then Collins bounced a grounder to
Zimmerman and was an easy out.
McMullen fouled to Rariden. Herzog
opened New York's third by striking
out. The crowd then had the laugh
on J'ohn Collins who duplicated his er
ror of the first inning, again dropping
a fly off Kauffs bat, the runner reach
ing second. Kauff moved up to third
when Zimmerman grounded out, Weav-,
er to Gandil. Fletcher was thrown
out by Eddie Collins on a fast piece of
fielding.
Zimmerman made a beautiful play
on Eddie Collins in the fourth inning,
knocking dvwn his fast bounder and
throwing him out by a step. Jackson
hit weakly past the pitchers box and
was thrown out by Fletcher. Felsch
drove a hot single to left and was left
on the bases when Robertson bumped
against the right-field wall in catching
Gandil's long fiy.
The Fatal Fourth.
Then came the wrecking crew that
ditched the Sox. Robertson, first up
in the fourth for New York, let loose a
terrific drive that looked good for a
home run as it started. The ball, how
ever, fell short of the right-center field
fence and Robertson drew up at third.
He was widely cheered. Holke, next
up, took a strike and then drove Ci
cotte's second offering tv the left-field
fence for two bases, Robertson of
course, scoring. Rariden became a
martyr by sacrificing, Cicotte to Gan
dil, Holke moving to third. Benton
struck out on three pitched balls.
Holke scored the Giants' sec'ond run
on Burns' scratchy infield hit. Cicotte

out to Fclscli, giving the Sox center
fielder his fifth putout.
Weaver opened Chicago's eighth iu
ning with a two-base slam to left field
but was caught between the bases
when Benton caught up Schalk's puny
gi'junder and ran over and touched i
him out as he was trying to return to'
second. Cicotte struck out as Schalk
tried to steal second. The runner was
tagged out by a throw by Rariden to
Herzog, completing a double play.
Another Hit.
Spectators began leaving the

a single to center and then made a

Chicago's last stand at the plate was
sc'jn over. J. Collins dropped a
grounder in front i the plate and was
thrown out by Rariden. McMullin
was tossed out by Fletcher. Captain
Collins beat out a grounder along the
right field fould line. It was a close
at first and the bleacher crowd, think
ing the game was over began to vault
the fence into the playing field. Play
was stopped while policemen cleared
the 'outfield. Joo Jackson, the Sox
last hope of the afternoon, did his best
to land on the ball for a home run,
which would have tied the score. But
it was not bis day to be a hero,

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

NEW YORK, Oct. 10. The underly
ing cause of the liquidation in stocks
is due to the taxation, government
regulations, and hysteria. No one
knows what the future has in store.
and the largest men in the country
freely admit their opinions are with
out value under the present condi
tions. Therefore the desire to con
vert wealth Into cash is everywhere
in evidence. What can we expect
when the only buying is short cover
ing and when liquidation and short
selling overwhelms everything eiseT

little since the North sea fight but
steam out to target practice behind
mine-protected zones. For the men
of the ships there has been little but
the deadly routine of this business
varied only by calls for duty and
probable death on the submarines.
In The Reichstag.
COPENHAGEN, Oct. 10. In an
nouncing to the reichstag yesterday
that a plot had been discovered in the
German navy to paralyze the fleet.
Vice Admiral von Cappelle, the minis
ter tf marine is quoted in a Berlin
dispatch as saying:
"It is proved that the principal api
tator conferred in this plan with the
independent socialist faction in the
reichstag. explained his plans to depu
ties Haas and Vogtherr, and obtained
their approval.
"I cannot make a statement here on
the subsequent events which occurred
in the navy. Teh few persons who
forgot their honor and their duty suf
fered the penalty."
High Treason Charged.
Then centrist member. Herr Trim
born declared that if three deputies
named by Admiral von Cappelle had
transgressed the law it would be a
question of high treason.
The conservative member, Herr
Kretch, said if the three men were
guilty their parliamentary immunity
must be rescinded and that they must
be prosecuted.
Socialist Answers.
Herr Ebert, the socialist leader, said
the government ought to have consid
ered the effect of such grave charges
on domestic and foreign politics. The
material Admiral von Cappelle had
prbduced, he added, did not justify the
charge against the independent social
ists, and the chancellor had set one
party outside the pale at a moment
when a difficult situation necessitated
the utmost unity.
"We regard it our duty to fight with
all our strength a government which
indulges in such a policy," Herr Ebert
concluded. Herr Haase, leader of the
socialist minori:y in the reichstag
said :
Haase Talks.
"It is true that the sailor of whom
Admiral von Cappelle spoke had a talk
with me in the party conference room,
but it is incorrect to say that he pro
posed such a plan to me. The sailor
in question voiced his strong discon
tent and anger. The sailors had be
come eager subscribers to independent
periodicals and evinced a desire for in
tellectual culture while on land. I
pointed out to him that this is not per
missible and I warned him to be care
ful and proceed cautiously."
Bernstroff Shown
Again as Plotter
(Continued From Page One)
dead for several months. It was al
so suggested that Casement might
hage proposed these names simply be
cause he had met the men and knew
them as Irish agitators in this coun
try, without any correspondence with
them on the subject. '
Other Details.
There was no official attempt to
identify the Dr. Hale recommended
by von Bernstorff as an authority on
the work of the embargo conference
which so liberally bombarded con
gress with telegrams demanding that
munition shipments to the allies
cease. Dr. William Bayard Hale, one
time envoy of President Wilson to
Mexico and author of a biography of
the president, was in Berlin about
that time as a newspaper correspond
ent and apparently was on intimate
terms with the German government
Hale's attitude on the embargo ques
tion is said to have strained his re
lations at the White House at the
time.
In spite of the absence of formal
comment, administration officials did
not hesitate to discuss the latest dis
closure privately and to describe it as
a natural and proper development of
the whole tremendous indictment
against Germany as an international
criminal and a lawless violator of the
most elementary and generall accept
ed principles of international inter
courses and comity.
KILLED IN FIRE.
PETROGRAD. Oct 10. A special
dispatch to the Novoe Vremcya fiDm
Kiev says that at Briloff. In the gov
ernment of Podolsk, two-hundred per
sons have been burned to death in a
vodka factory. Soldiers looting the
factory set fire to a thousand gallons
tf spirit in the cellar where they were
trapped by the flames.
STRIKE CALLED OFF.
PETROGRAD. Oct 10. The minis
ters having promised to issue a decree
satisfactory to the demands of the rail
way strikers the executive committee
of the rai'roaders has called off the
strike. The men on all the lines af
fected have been Instructed to resume

man foreign secretary. Herr von
Kuehlman win proceed at an early
date on a visit to Vienna, Budapest, So
fia and Constantinople. It is said his
mission has Important political and
peace significance.
Commission May
BeJ)elayed Days
(Continued From Page One.)
! Strikers Close Statement.
j Strikers in the Clobe-Miami copper
j district closed the statement 'jf their
lease before the president's labor com
I mission today. Their final word was
that they unqualifiedly placed the en
; tire dispute in the hands of the pres
ident's commission for arbitration and
that if the operators would similarly
concede to such arbitration the men
would be willing to g"j back to the
mines immediately and continue there
pending arbitration.
Industrial Peace Needed.
Secretary of Labor Wilson and other
members of the commission are con
tinuously hammering home the fact
that that industrial peace is needed
and speedily needed in this district,
not merely because of the interests of
the companies and their workmen, but
primarily because Vf the copper re
quirements ef the United States. Sec
retary Wilson continuously impresses
upon all parties who appear before the
commission the country's vital need
for copper, not onlv for its munitions
in the war but also for making of ar
ticles indirectly required in the prose
cution of the war in industries closely
allied to the munitions industries. The
i commission is also emphasizing the
fact that this comes as a personal
message from President Wilson and
that he has directed the commission
to make this the basis Kt all of its ac
tivities on its western section. The
miners have also the nation's needs in
mind and state they will approach this
problem from that viewpoint: The op
erators will be heard tomorrow

is at the present time employed by

properties in the vicinity of Patagon
ia. He was seen thefe by Bisbe
parties last Monduy. The Review is
glad to make this correction.

WANT PERMISSION.
Charles T. Hamilton, at present of
Douglas, but who is well known in
Bisbee. was in Phoenix on Tuesday.
The purpose of his visit was to ascer
tain whether or not he could acquire
title to mineral ground in the Fort
Huachuea military reservation. Ham
ilton and S. A. Gardanear own con
siderable mineral land in the south
east corner of the military reserva
tion. The mineral deposit is tung
sten and they are building a 10-ton
mill which will be in operation with
in 30 days. The southeast comer of
thi9 reservation is heavily mineraliz
ed with tungsten and as the govern
ment requires a large amount of this
mineral in it munition factories for
hardening steel, Hamilton and Gar
darnear thought perhaps they could
get a permit to work the ground. As
the United States land office had no
authority to permit their acquiring
possession of the ground, they will
take the matter up with the secretary
of war.

Here's Real Paint
House painting isn't
a matter of prejudice
it's a matter of business
and common sense.
That's why you ought
to make sure what kind
of paint your painter is
going to use on your job
or what kind of paint
you buy from the dealer.
Paint isn't like an
apple you can't tell by
looking at it or by biting
it how good or bad it
is.
It takes weeks, perhaps
months, and maybe a
year or more to tell
whether - it was worth
what you paid.
SWP
stands for Sherwin-Williams
Paint (Prepared)
and its fifty-year record
of results means quality
and satisfaction to any
painter or property-owner.
Be sure the initials
are on the label, then
you can count on the
