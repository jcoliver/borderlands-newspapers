American troops arrived byj
the same steamer whereon
Kermit Roosevelt, his wife and
child traveled. When tenders
went alongside the vessel Fri

"Are we down-Jiearted?"
which was' answered with a
roaring "No," given with
great enthusiasm. Represent
atives of the general staff
watched the disembarkation.
There was no civic demon

These cheered and the troops!
cheered back. The men en
trained quickly and left for

for some hours, and these were

contingent which the public

AMERICAN TRAINING CAMP IN
FRANCE, July 28. Two American
base hospital units, organized under
the direction of the Red Cross, but tak
en over by the United tSates army,
have just arrived in the American
army zone in France and are estab
lished some 20 miles apart. Both units
have taken over French hospitals,
where, however, there are very few
patients. The . work soon will be or
ganized of caring for the American
sick and wounded sent back from tbe
advanced field hospitals and the cas
ualty clearing stations.
The first of the units to reach France
was Base Hospital No. 18, organized
at Johns Hopkins university, Balti
more. . This was quickly followed by
Base Hospital No. 15, from Roosevelt
hospital. New York, the latter being
organized and equipped largely through
the Interest of Clarence Mackay.
Units in New Quarters
Each of these organizations is cap
able of caring for 1000 to 1500 patients.
They have brought over large sup
plies, but one of the great problems
they will have to meet is that of keep
ing warm this winter, for a serious
coal shortage is threatened.
The Roosevelt hospital unit is now
established in a summer hotel, which
is not provided with heating facilities
for winter, but plans are already un
der way to install stoves or, if pos
sible, set up a steam heating apparat
us. The Johns Hopkins unit is tem
porarily housed In a French base hos
pital, but may later take up its quar
ters in a barracks, which is really eas
ier to heat than the .barn-like hotels.
MOVEMENT OF FREIGHT AT CHICAGO
HANDICAPPED BY YARDMEN'S STRIKE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, July 28. Movement o,
freight to, through and from Chicago
was handicapped today by the strike
on 18 railroads of switchmen affiliat
ed with the Brotherhood Of Railway
Trainmen. For a time after the men
walked out at 6 a. m. tue possibility
of mediation hung in the balance, but
before noon the present likelihood of
federal relief vanished with the re
fusal of the strike leaders to accept
the Offices of G. W. W. Hanger, of the
federal board of mediation and con
ciliation. Contending that they sought on,
the establishment of reasonable rules
regarding employment, promotion and
dismissal of switchmen, the strike
leaders asserted that close to 6000
men quit work. The railroad mana

number who refused to work at r.

of the governor, who informed
him of the action of the governor.
The only reply or comment by the

Result of Strike Talk
The action of the governor is
said to have been precipitated by
certain reports which the adjutant
general has made regarding the
strike situation 'and which have
been characterized by the gover
nor as "seditious." ,
Cblonel Harris has seen at ae
head of the national guard ' of

the military code of the sta:e,
said to have been prepared by Col
onel Harris, prescribing the quali
fications of the adjutant general,
one of which is that he should
have had a continuous service of
fiVe years in the national guard
of the state. He alone possessed
that qualification. It is on that
amendment, it is said, that Col
onel Harris will resist the at
tempt to remove him. ' It 1b said
by friends of the governor tnat
the amendment cannot interfere
with the power of the executive
to remove any appointive officer,

have power to fill -the vacancy.

NAY INCREASE
WAR TAX BILL
TO 2 BILLION
Largest Part of Proposed Raise
in Revenue Measure Will
Come From Higher Income
Taxes During War.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. July 28. The
finance committee reported a
- tentative agreement late today
to revise the present $1,670,
000,000 war tax bill so as to raise at
least $1,943,000,000. the larger part of
the increase to come from higher in
come taxes.
Members of the committee said to
night it is possible the total of the bill
before it gets to the senate will be 12,
000,000,000. According to the present
plan about $230,000,000 of the increase,
will be obtained through higher In
come tax rates $70,000,000 from in
dividuals and the rest from corpora
tions. Tbe committee fixed an in
crease in tbe normal rate on individ
uals from two to five per cent and on
corporations to six per cent. Tbe rest
of the increase may be obtained by in
creasing the excess profits tax and
by consumption taxes on ' sugar, tea.
coffee and cocoa.
Unde; the program tl.O2,70fl,000
would be the total levy this year upon
Incomes. The present law yields $300,
000,000, the pending till originally was
designed to increase this by $532,700.
000 and tbe $230,000,000 additional it
is now proposed to levy would raise It
over the billion mark.
The senate committee will confine
its work for tbe present to tbe present
war tax bill and will .leave to the
house the task of raising the rest of
the $7,000,000,000 the. administration
believes it must have to prosecute the
war this yeart Mairrj leader Kitcfc
in, of the house, ' was in conference
with the senate committee today, and
this decision was reached as a result
of bis contention that tbe house might
resent any senatorial Infringement on
its constitutional prerogative of insti
tuting revenue legislation. Whether
the house will prefer to authorize 83,
000,000,000 in bonds or treasury cer
tificates to supplement the $2,000,000,
000 the senate Is providing, will not be
determined until next week.
The decision today to leave tbe
house the task of providing $5,000,000,-
000 additional promised greatly to ex
pedite senate action on tbe pending
revenue bill. Senator Simmons said
the committee plans to complete 1U
revision Tuesday and report the bill
to the senate for beginning of debate
the latter part of next week.
Senator Simmons said tonight there
is no immediate necessity for the sen
ate to consider revenue questions be
yond the bill, there being ample funds
to meet all calls until December.
The committee's agreement to In
crease income taxes by $230,000,000
in increasing the pending tax bill from
$1,670,000,000 to at least $1,943,000,
000 was said to be based upon belief
that the bulk of the Increase bail come
from incomes rather than war profits
already heavily taxed In the bilL
The committee gave much time to
discussing reconsideration of the
amendment, already written into the
bill, levying a tax of fifteen per cent
upon corporations' undivided or tin
disturbed surplus. This is known as
the amendment of Senator Jones of
New Mexico, and has been rigorously
opposed by corporations. There was
much opposition to changing this sec
tion. Japanese Vessel

"Germany accomplished less in this

More than twe million women, Mr.
Hoover announced, have enrolled as
members of IhW food administration,
pledging themselves to saving food
within the house hold. Within sixty
days, be said, many more millions will

"No one can rightly be gloomy over
the outcome of the American people
in this war," said Mr. Hoover. "Suc
cess in this war is a question of le-
sources and the ability of tbe peo

rightly and endure. Many thinking

been too little for the demand upon us

had not responded to the call for ellm

200,000,000 of these cans. Tbe returns

that the American women will pre

WASHINGTON, July 28. Conferees on the administra

tomorrow.
Two provisions prevented an agreement the senate
amendment proposing a food control board of three members
instead of an individual administrator, and that creating a con

planned to report the partial disagreement to the two houses
and ask for further instructions. A deadlock is not considered
improbable. . .
Earlier in the day the conferees smoothed "out their dif
ferences on a prohibition provision and agreed to the section
fixing a $2 minimum per bushel for wheat.

There was little opposition to tbe

endment but it was changed so as tt

NO PLANS YET FOR
REORGANIZATION OF
AMERICAN FORCES
Regulars and National Guard
to Move to Camps in Pres
ent "Typical" Division
Formation, Announcement
v"By Review Leased wire)
WASHINGTON. July 28. Plans for
tactical re-organization of the army
are Uot advanced to the point where
any immediate change in the size or
formation of divisions now in this
country is contemplated. It was
stated officially today that divisions of
regulars, national guard and national
army would be moved to their camps
in the formation of the present ''typi
cal" infantry division prescribed by
law, but which the president is au
thorized to vary as he sees fit
Presumably a reorganization of Gen
eral Pershing's forces In harmony
with the smaller division plan now in
vogue in European armies already has
been effected. The exact nature of
the change has not been disclosed. A
tyijjcal infantry division of the Amer
ican army makes a total force of
about 28,000 men. The French use
about 16,000 men to a division and the
Germans about the same, and in
trench fighting the unit of organiza
tions appears to be the corps rather
than the division. The typical division
as it exists can be shaped easily to
meet any emergency, ..however, and
that is what will be done on the basis
of actual experience of France.
MURDER MYSTERY '. -BELIEVED
SOLVED
BY NEGROS ARREST
(By Review Leased Wire)
Marlin, Texas, July 28. Efforts to
solve the mysterious murder of Hal
St. Clir, found dead on his farm near
here late Thursday, as yet are unavail
ing, but it is learned that in addition
to having three men under surveil
lance, a neero has been arrested.
It is reported that the negro hns
confessed and implicated two white
men but the authorities have declined
to make any statement
"Your only reward," he. said "must
be the knowledge that at great person
al sacrifice you are rendering your
country an indispensible service In a
matter of the utmost moment."
President Wilson tonight issued an
executive order directing government
'officials to exercise "the greatest
care" in issuing exemption affidavits to
employes in the civil service depart
ments, emphasizing tne nigh national
importance of carrying out "the spirit
of the selective service act and of se
curing its fullest effectiveness by hold
ing to military service all drafted men
who are not absolutely indispensible"
to department work.
He says discharges should be reduc
ed tv the "minimum number consistent
with the maintenance of vital national
interests duriug the emergency of war.
Warns of Seriousness
"It is earnestly hoped, moreover,"
the order concludes, "that acting in
the same spirit as the federal depart
mental officials all citizens who ma
be called upon as employers, under
section 44 of the regulations, Vj make
affidavits for securing the discharge
of persons deemed to be indispensible
to national industrial interests, daring
the emergency will exercise the same
conscientious and scrupulous caution,
to the end that there will appear to
be no favored 'or exempted class among
the citizens called by the law to .the
national defense."
General Crowder's communication
mailed to boards, reads as follows:
"You are entering on a difficult task.
the gravity of which is beyond any-
thing that can be said in the way ot
discussion. Ytm realize the signifi
cance of what you are to do and you
know that a responsibility, heavier per
haps than any you have ever faced, :&
upon you.
Individual Sacrifices
"War demands individual sacrifice
to the common cause. rvo people ever
approached war with a calmer appre-
ciatlbn of that sacrifice or a firmer re
solve to bear it and to present them
selves to be classified for service in
the place to which it shall best serve
the common good to call them. This
calm determination could not exist
were it not for the confidence tot tne
nation in its institutions. In this pub
lic confidence is found the very spirit
of the selective service law. The most
sacred rights of country, home and
family ar entrusted for adjudication to
local citizens and Officials, nominated
by state governments and appointed by
the president
"The most equitable rules that could
be devised have been prescribed for
your guidance and the administration
of these rules and tne sacrrnce tia:
is offered by your neighbors is en
trusted to your hands. The selected
! man offers his life. . There is no great
er giving than this; and that th'jugni
should guide you always. There may
be a few who will urge upon you
claims for exemption or discharge tha,
whatever may be your Inclinations ot
bympathy or affection, you will know
ought not to be granted. It will
strengthen you to remember that for
every exemption or discbarge that is
made for individual convenience or to
escape personal loss of money or prop
erty, tor for favor or affection some oth
er man, whose time would not othei
wise have come, must incur the risk
of losing his life."

Herbert Hoover are designed to con
stitute a government purchasing com
mission serving under the board's di
rection. The work of the commis
sioners will be divided as follows:
Mr. Baruch in charge of raw mater
ial purchases; Mr. Brookings, finished
products; Mr. Lovett, to decide prior
ity, and Mr. Hoover, food buyer.
There will be no change In the or
ganization of the council itself, whose
membership Is drawn from the cabi
net, nor in the organization of its ad
visory commission, made up of indus
trial and scientific representatives.
The change in organization is ex

that manufacturers and producers as

ernment forces under command of
General Gulllermo Chavez had sur
rounded a body of Villistas under the
personal command of Francisco Villa,
in a mountain canyon 65 miles south
east of Parral, Chiahuahua and the
capture or annihilation of the entire
Villista force, seemed certain, accord

LEADVILLE, Colo., July 28. The
Diamond mines, another group of
Leadville mines, was added to the
list of those which the operators have
announced would be closed and the
pumps, trams and other underground
tools drawn. This increased the li3t
of mines which will oe closed down
for the present, at least, to five. TIip
Robert Emmett, the McCormick, the
Old Moyer and a fourth big mine, the
name of which has not yet been an
nounced, will be shut down until there
Is a readjustment of the labor situa
tion in this district.
It was announced tonight that the
pumps, track and other underground
equipment of the Diamond are now be
ing withdrawn and the water permit
ted to raise in tit si group of gold
mines. These mines are working
through the Yak tunnel, which extends
for a distance of three miles under
Iron and Breete hills, penetrating the
heart of the mineralized Leadville dis
trict. The reason given for the with
drawal of this group from the list of
operating mines in this field is the
great expense Incidental to operation
of the two large -shafts. But it was
known that the present labor problem
affted the decision to close. As the
group is classed .as "wet," the water
level Is expected to raise rapidly in
these thafts after pumping operations
have ceased. .
"Bluff," Say Strikers.
The striking members of the local
miners' union Insist that the an
nounced closing down of the five large
mines Is merely a "bluff" and that,
when the present strike blows over,
these mines will be reopened and op
erated. Eli Follett, secretary of the Cloud
City Union, said tonight he did not
consider the action of the operators as
having any vital bearing upon the
strike situation.
"The mines belong to the operators
and I do not know their business." be
said, "but I do know that the strikers
will not allow themselves to be influ
enced by any action In arriving at a
settlement of the present labor differ
ences." In snswer to this position, which
has been generally assumed by the
striking miners, especially of the min
ers' union officials, the operators call
attention to the fact that the work of
pulling the pumps, withdrawing the
underground equipment and the clos
ing of all operations at these mines is
now actually tinder way. They insist
that, as practical mining men, they
would not permit their mines to- fill
with water if t'hey were simply "bluff
ing," as the strikers claim, and they
decline their intention of discontinu
ing all operations at these five prop
erties until "the union no longer Inter
feres with the labor situation here," as
one operator said tonight
Strikers Orderly.
Only a brief message was received
by the miners' union from it's commit
tee in Denver and the local strikers
were in ignorance tonight what ac
tion had been taken there looking to
the settlement of the strike. Secre
tary Follett said the committee had
received a' proposal from the repre
sentatives of the government but said
he did not know the exact nature of
it. The committee is not expected to

week.
Meantime this camp is as quiet as
a deserted village.
Fishing is good on Tennessee creek
and many strikers spend their days
there. Merchants complain of a fall
ing off in business and there is a gen
eral tone of unrest in the camp be-!
cause of prolongation of the dispute
and the resutling tie up of the mines,
upon which the life and business of
the camp depend. No arrests have
been made as a result of the strike,
there have been no labor disputes on
the streets, none but union hall meet
ings, and the Leadville strikers claim
to be conducting the most orderly
and peaceable strike in the history o'.
the state. The only evidence that the
Btrike is in progress is the presence
of va few pickets on the mine trails
and the unusually large number of
mienrs to be. seen on the streets and

Sunday Morning, July 29, 1917.
The war enters its fourth year with the entente allies'
main work ahead of them yet to do.
Troops have been sent to San Jose, California, to
preserve order in the canneries strike., Orders for the
U. S. government and her allies have been held up by
the strike. The men are demanding better wages than
(2.40 a day and the women want more than 75 cents a
day. And yet there was a strike in Bisbee by men who
were receiving $5.50 and $5.75 a day. Women in Art
zona must receive more than $1.50 a day under the law.
Every one knows that the kaiser and Gott are side
partners, but there is worse to come. The new chancellor,
Michaelis, they say, is another pal of the long suffering
Gott He is as deeply and fanatically religious as is Wll
helm, bis master. He, too, is a self appointed instrument
of Deity to make the rest of the world conform to the
Prussian doctrines. Gracious heavens, what next! Will
the German general staff summon a legion of angels to
help them in their massacre of women and little children
upon land and the high seas?
"I want to congratulate you upon that article in the
Review Saturday morning pointing out that this was the
time of real peril for the district," said a leading mem
ber of the Protective League yesterday. "It will help a
lot. Every word of it was true. I have been closely in
touch with this thing since it started and I am working
every day now with it. I know that we must still bo
active and vigilant. We must depend upon the average
citizen for the real effectiveness of our work. The clerk
and merchant and worker and office man, all these must
be on the alert and must watch and listen for our enemies.
They must report to us every suspicious word and act.
We must ALL work together in order to reap the full
harvest from our fine sowing."
MAKING A STRONG SENTENCE STRONGER.
President Wilson said the world must be made safe
for Democracy. Governor S. W. McCall, of Massachusetts,
has transposed this sentence to "Make Democracy saf
for the world." And thereby he has made it a stronger
and more effective epigramme than it was before. Gov
ernor McCall goes 9n to say: "Democracy is not a shy
flower to be sheltered from the winds and storms, but
must be conceived of as a strong man making his way
in the face of tempests and having in him all the atrengtii
of the race." .
From the cement face and iron jaw of this Massa
chusetts executive has come a stirring text and one that
fits our times. "Make Democracy safe," he says. It is
the ideal form of government but it is being changed to
clay by the bungling selfish hands of legislators. Out of
discussion is born light, but the constant expansion anl
dilution of individual views of certain tireless talkers in
congress serve no purpose but a bad one for Democracy.
"From lack of organization Democracy has been com
pelled more than once to bear the guilt of glaring faults,"
says Gov. McCall, "and that is what I mean by making
Democracy safe for itself, able to meet effectively what
ever situation arises."
Democracy will be made safe in this country only
when it Is organized to meet emergencies promptly. In
time of war administration measures and recommenda
tions should be considered at once and either accepted
or rejected by congress under emergency ruling. The
congressional machine should either be speeded up or
scrapped for old junk. A ninety-mile an hour aeroplane
used to be regarded as a world wonder. It is a joke
on the Flanders battle front today where fighting ma
chines make 160 miles an hour.
This nation is at war and Democracy has not recog
nized the fact The imperative demands of the cltizcnn
of this republic should be made upon Washington in such
fashion as a storm cloud of protest against all this deba'u
and petty politics and piddling and pettifogging and phil
andering over vital measures demanded by the adminis
tration and Tor Vhich the administration will be held
responsible. Congress, that cannot run itself, wants to
run the war. Only the voice of the people, threatening,
united and terrible, can stir these sluggards and silenro
their endless tongues and shatter their colossal and
selfish egotism.
Make Democracy safe for itself and It will quickly
make the world safe for free government for all time
to come.
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON.
"Oh, thou of little faith, wherefore dost thou doubt'"
Matt. 14-31,
Always we are inclined to doubt, to be timid, to
hesitate, to falter and loiter and even come to a full
stop along the way. We doubt ourselves and we doubt
our friends. It has always been so. The children of
Israel, with God's own word constantly in the mouths
of their prophets, and God's pillar of fire to lead them on
doubted. God lost patience with them scores of times
and scourged them for their eternal doubting.
Faith is a sublime attribute of the race. It is our
faith that cements ua together and spurs us on. No one
ever accomplished anything worth while without faith
The bread line, the river docks, the prisons, the alms
houses and the Potters' fields are full of doubters. Men
of faith are in the vast majority in places of council,
in positions of responsibility, in the bright light of fame.
in the seats of the mighty.
Faith, and faith alone, carried the caravel of Co
lumbus across' the sea. But for faith Washington would
have surrendered at Valley Forge. Faith sustained Lin
coln throughout the dark hours of the civil war. Fnlth
carried the pioneers across the Mississippi and the
Rockies to discover the west, and faith made the waste
places bloom and the hills yield under their weak hands
and brave hearts. Faith won their fight with the In
dians and gave them that, last punch that enabled them
to make this southwest empire the wonder of the world.
Faith gave the Warren district the greatest copper
mines in the world. Physical strength and resource and
courage were gone before the big strike was made. But
faith, and faith alone, sustained the pioneer miners of
this valley until they had accomplished their destiny.
Faith built Bisbee in a cleft in the mountains and
made her one of the wonder cities of the west. Faith
drove the wobblies away.
Faith is the eternal spring from which we dip all our
happiness and prosperity and accomplishment in th's
world below and it is all we have to build upon for our
hopes of the hereafter. The builder had to have faith,
else he would be living in a tent today, or under a tree
or In a cave. The banker founded his institution upon
faith. The workman's muscles are braced by faith. The
lover lives on faith alone and the preacher would be dumb
without faith for his text
The doubter and the timid one, ah, they are easy to
identify. They live in rented houses, they hold poor
jobs, and more often, none at alL Their clothes look the
worse for wear. Their eye is dim and their glancp is
bent downward. They shuffle their feet when they
walk. Their shoulders droop. When they speak their
tones are set to excuses and complaints, and when they
are silent they. sigh. They are almost always in diffi
culty or trouble. They have more bad luck and bad falls
and bad fortune and bad feelings and bad . breaks and
bad everything than the ten lost tribes in the desert.
Look up, friends, and take a chance. Set your lips
and make your unwilling feet gq forward. Have faith in
yourself, your future, your friends, your family, your
town, your country, your God. Be game and gay, and it
will follow, as the night the day, that you Will be good
and be happy and be loved and be fortunate and be able
to win at least a good living from the world.
Faith was born with the first light of the morning
stars; she dwells always in the glorious womb of that
great Tomorrow to which all of us look for the fulfill
ment of our heart's desire. Never doubt it, there is a
light ahead and a golden chair and a sweet smile and
a true hand and a thrilling song and a blessed recom
pense for every brave heart. Faith will unlock every
door between the deepest dungeon of earth and the high
est gate of heaven. .
These Germans, by what process of reasoning do
they"reach their self exalted state? A German scholar,
recently arrived in Switzerland, hungry and loquacious,
delivered himself with supreme egotism of the German
state of mind at present. According to him Germany
wanted war in 1914, therefore there was war. Germany
wants peace now and cannot understand hy she cannot
have it. Germany loves France and cannot understand
why France does not kiss the hand that has smitten
her so terribly. Germany hates England with sullen bit
terness and cannot understand why England's soldiers
fight on so steadily and calmly and gayly and make joked
of "old Fritz" and his ways. Germany is surprised and
displeased with the United States and regards her en
trance in the war as of no consequence at all. This is
the German mind at present as interpreted by an in
tensely loyal and an intelligent German fresh from the
fatherland. Consider it, analyze it, and then reconcile it
with the sane sense of modern civilization if you can.
The Review is in receipt of an imposing little book
let, sent by a preacher of some sect or other in New
Jersey, in which is Bet forth the somewhat startling dec
laration that upon August 4 next the "heavens will be or.
fire, all business will end and there will be death every
where." The editor almost fainted from terror. Then
his staring eyes read further and found that upon August
7, according to the prophecy of this book, "the devil will
appear upon earth and the temple will be rebuilt at
Jerusalem." That assertion about the devil appearing
upon earth sounds reasonable, he is here now, but the
claims about the temple sound a little far fetched. But
now comes the worst of all. The book solemnly affirms
that upon September lfi "every child shall be caugh:
away," and "every saint shall be caught away." There
are many children upon earth, and a few saints, and we
cannot afford to lose any one of them. The man that
wrote this book is the prize pessimist of the age. lie
must have access to an avenue of information denied
the ordinary mortal.
Close Call From Centipede
. Bite for Prescott Man
The first case known in many years
of a person being bitten by a centipede
with injuries that were serious for sev
eral days occurred on July 12 to A.
E. Bird, a mechanical engineer of the
Congress mine, says the Prescott
Journal.
His foot was innoculated with the
poison of this insect and for nearly a
week afterward his recovery was
doubtful.
Mr. Bird arrived in Prescott on Wed
nesday tj receive further medical at
tention, and is slowly progressing to
ward recovery. He states the trouble
took place at about 10 o'clock at night
while he was asleep and instantly aft
er being bitten the pain was intense.
Arising and lighting a candle he saw
the centipede, which measured over
eight inches in length, on the bed.
The foot of Mr. Bird was swollen
to four times its natural size, while his
general physical condition also was
severely affected by the Voi8on- It is
presumed this Insect had over 100
feet, although only two small wounds
were made in the attack, both fangs
penetrating the flesh ij full depth. Mr.
Bird states the sensation was like a
knife blade entering his foot
Carbuncles on Chaplin's
Million-Dollar Legs
After the most serious illness he has
had in many years and which requir
ed the undivided attention of two phy
sicians, Charlie Chaplin, the mill'.'jn
dollar fun-maker, this week returned
to the Lone Star studios to again start
his activities before the camera.
Although it was not generally known
Chaplin was confined to his bed for lv
days.
Chaplin noticed the symptoms July
when he was about to start work 'On
a picture. A physician was summoned
and after thoroughly examining Char
lie he detected two carbuncles in their
early stage, located directly opposite
each other on the comedian's million
dollar legs.
The disturbing elements were lanced
and Chaplin was ordered to bed ir .
complete rest Not used to this sort
of existence and believing himself cap
able of remaining on bis feet, the pa
then ventured out In violation of the
physician's orders and the following
day found him painfully, if n'jt danger
ously, at the mercy of the malady.
Expert attention prevented blood
poison from setting in and there was
much anxiety as to Chaplin's condition
when he suffered a relapse when ap
parently cured. However, he rallied.
and two days of undisturbed rest found
him discharged from the physician'3
care. ,,-

Guynemer, French Flier,
Downs 48th Teuton Plane
Captain Georges Guynemer, the
dauntless Vace" of the French fiyins
forces, who was recently made an offi
cer of the Legion of Honor, has de
stroyed three more,, German aei
planes, bringing to 48 his list of enemy
machines shot down and officially
counted. Several Weeks ago the French
war office stopped naming "ace" avia
tors in the official statement. Guyne
mer was then the elader of the attack
ing pilots with 43 victims.
Late in June he "descended" t
additional adversaries and his forty
sixth victim was shot down July 7 at
Moussy-sur-Aisne after a sharp com
bat The enemy machine fell right cn
top of a French cannon, which was in
the act of firing on the German
trenches. It was the first time in the
war that an aeroplane had fallen upon
a battery. The machine was 'of a new
type. It was a 200 horsepower Aviatik
on its first flight over the lines and
was manned by a pilot and a gunner
just arrived from the Russian front.
Pilot Survives Fall
The gunner was killed by Guyne-
mers bullets, out the pilot survived
tne fall unhurt although his aeroplane
was completely wrecked. Learning
the name of the pilot who shot him
d'jwn be cursed the fate that, in hit-
first flight over the French lines, sent
him straight into the sector of the air
man whom tiie Germans most dread.
Captain Guynemer's forty-seventh and
forty-eighth enemy machines were de
stroyed a few days later. These were
also well near the lighting trenches.

NEARLY A THOUSAND
RABBITS KILLED
In the big rabbit drive in the Casa
Grande valley last week 647 dead bun
nies were counted after the citizens
had finished their work. These did
not include many that the Indians na;
taken away. It was the first concert
ed rabbit drive the citizens had ever
undertaken and its success has decid
ed them to continue the work. The slo
gan in the Casa Grande country is,
"The rabbits must go." They have
become, through their increasing
numbers, a pest and a nuisance to the
ranchers and small farmers 'of the
valley.
ARIZONA BOY WINS
HONORS AT CHICAGO
Word from the naval training camp
on the Great Lakes near Chicago is to
the effect that John K. Akers, formerly
of Phoenix, but now of the U. S.
naval reserves, made the highest per
centage of bulls' eyes recently Xn the
rifle range. There are 35,000 young
men of the naval reserves, the pick of
the country, in camp near Chicago. In
the stiffest kind of competition this
Arizona sharpshooter maintained his
reputation established last summer at
Phoenix on the home guard rifle range.
Voung Akers has been made an in
structor in wig-wagging at the naval
rerve camp.
Behold the Burro! At Last
He Gets His Just Dues
Eugene Borw n has an admitted fond
ness for the burro, and tells in the Lor
Angeles Times Illustrated Magazine
some of tile distinguishing character
istics of the animal that he has learn
ed from persoiml observation. He
sketches the little fellow's salient
points thus:
He nas a lilfch forehead and a
thoughtful, reflective face, but is noi
as brainy as he looks. Sometimes, in
deed, he seems as inane and stupid as
a man in love with a grass widow. Most
generally a burro has great, soulful
eyes, but rtallv his soul is smaller
than that of. a blind kitten. In a col
lection of souls that of the burro
would seem like a mere speck. The
greatest value of the burro Is for the
load he curries. If a man I'ould carry
the same load and be as sure-footed
ab'out it he would he worth S2U.0UU a
year as a wine a&cnt
The burro can geuerally get away
ARIZONA TO HAVE STATE FAIR
Arizona will have a good state fair
this fall in spite of the unsettled af
fairs of the country and most of Ue
local fairs will be held as usual. This
is as it should be, for fairs stimulate
better agricultural production in times
of war as well as In times Vif peace
and agricultural production needs stim
ulation by every means possible. It
should be remembered that fairs are
of great educational value and such
educational features are always desir
able. This promises to be Arizona's ban
ner year of agricultural production,
and consequently the exhibits are like
ly i'j be unusually good.
Farmers should begin saving their
good agricultural and horticultural
specimens and start early to fit their
livestock for the shows. The state
fair secretary is Mr. B. W. Zachau,
Phoenix, and he has plans well under
way.
ARIZONA WINS FAME IN EAST
Confident that the publicity cam
paign ln which he has been touring
the cast for the past five months will
bear fruit and prove of great value to
Arizona, W. Ward Davies, secretary
of the Casa Grande Chamber of Com
merce, left Tucson for his home this
morning, says the Citizen. He arrived
in this city yesterday, just five months
to a day from the time that he left
for the east with a message from this
state.
People were amazed at the wonder
ful wealth and resources of Arizona.
Mr. Davies said. He addressed 18 pub
lic meetings In the largest centers of
the east distributed over 2000 pam
phlets describing Pinal county, an
met many capitalists who were great
ly interested in the opportunities for
investment here.
The east has but a vague idea of
Aru'.ma, Mr. Davies declared, and the
personal touch possible by sending lec
turers through the country is the best
kind of advertising imaginable.

Business Bettered
, "General business should, in the very
near future, be better than it ever was
in the history of the Warren district,"
said Mr. Arthur Notman, assistant
mine superintendent of the Copper
Queen. "The Copper Queen will pro

approximately 70 per cent of the nor
mal output. It can be seen from these i
figures that, on a basis of pounds cop

"The working forces of tne copper

Amusements Hurt
.Summer weather, summer dances
and strike conditions hurt the amuse
ment business. With normal condi.
tions, the moving picture theaters con
stitute a very fair barometer of gen
eral business. The present outlook,
however, produces good business in
this line.
"We have suffered more, proportion
ately, perhaps, than any other line of
business in the Warren district," said
A. J. Detloff, general manager of the
Progressive Amusement company. This
company owns the Orpheum, Eagle
and Central theaters.
' "Since July 12 our business has
been increasing. I can hardly account
for it, though I accredit the increase

the forces of the mining companies'
are back to normal I confidently expect
to see the best business my company
has ever enjoyed."
Banks Not Hurt
The financial institutions of the
Warren district have hardly felt the
strike and the subsequent happenings
on July 12.
"The Citizens bank has hardly felt
the trouble," said C. A. McDonald,
cashier of the Institution. "Taken
from top to bottom, the nien who went
out on strike are not tnose who save
their money. In but very few cases
do they build homes. It is an element

And the Mud Digger
Stability and contentment is the per
vading feeling in the mines. Tn
miners, muckers and mechanics are
taking new interest in their work.
They feel that all now working want
to work. They feel that their fellow
workmen are not merely getting a
"grub stake" with which to loaf upon
when L W. W. leaders declare r a
strike or a walkout.
"I have worked in the mines of Bis
bee tor eight years," said a miner yes
terday. "I have never sensed a bet
ter feeling among the men than at
the present time. Before the strike s
man guarded his tongue when under
ground, faring some I. W. W. or other
labor leader. Now that care has been
eliminated. Every man that I know
of, and many others, express satisfac

fearing labor trouble. They are mak

Other Merchants
The smaller merchants in Bisbee
are looking to the future with all as
surance. To a man they appear to
feel that a better, bigger Bisbee will
be the result of the recent exodus On
July 12 and the subsequent increases
in working forces among American
citizens.
"Speaking for my own business I
can confidently say that while the
strike was felt, the ultimate good to

than repay me for any loss it may have
caused, temporarily," said J. B. An

"Tanlac to my mind is the greatest
and grandest medicine in the world,"
said O. H. Maliaffey, chief engineer of

Tenn.
"I have taken eight bottles," he con
tinued, "and have actually gained 40
pounds in weighs, and feel stronger

EXPENSE OF COCHISE
FOR FISCAL YEAR EXCEEDS
$500,000, ACCORDING TO BUDGET
COUNTY
A. C. Karger, clerk of the board of
supervisors, has completed the budget
for the estimated expenses of the
county for the fiscal year 1917-1818.
It shows that $552,501.25 will be need
ed for the operation of the common
wealth for that time, and that it is
probable, according to the clerk's esti
mate that the county tax rate will not
exceed 30 cents. Last year the county
rate was 43 cents, which added to the
state rate of 40 cents made a total of
83 cents. Mr. Karger estimates that
the total rate for Cochise county this
year including the state rate will not
exceed 60 cents, basing his estimate
on the budget and Increase in valua
tion as published in these columns
recently.
j The budget which is printed on pag
1 es 6 and 7 of the Mining Section,
i shows that the sum to be raised by di
' rect taxation will be $272,808.37 for a
1 general fund and a special district
levy to be raised for common school
maintenance of $117,329.60. The
amount needed for the road fund .s
i placed at $109,000.00 with $170,692.88
' for the general school fund. For
high school maintenance $117,591.20
will be needed to be raised by special
district levy.
Litery Digest
Devotes 2 Pages
To Deportation
The Literary Digest of July 28 de
votes two pages to the I. W. W. men
ace and the Bisbee' deportation. It
quotes briefly from a dozen or more
newspapers of widely separated parts
of the country that both blame and
praise the act of the Bisbee citizens.
Most of the papers quoted unquali
fiedly commend the deportation; all of
them condemn the I. W. W. but a few
criticize the methods used In getting
rid of them (as if there were an?,
other).
The Digest itself undertakes to be
neutral but it closes the article in a
surprised and pained way by quoting i
from Haywood, head of the I. W. wj
in which he declares that his organl-j
ration is composed of "the roughnecks
of the world" and "they can't stop us. j
We will take control of all products!
and work when we please and how
much we please. The man who makes
the wagOn shall ride in it itself."
In thus quoting Haywood on the
purposes and utlimate objects of n
organization the Digest pleaded the
cause of the Bisbee citizens better
than any partisan exclamations and
adjectives could have done.
A part of the Citizen's Protective
league and Miners' Loyalty league
telegrams of explanation were used as
was also the salient parts of Sherilt
Wheeler's proclamation declaring the
causes of and necessity for the drive.
Of one thing there can be no doubt
whatever. The swut, sudden, silent
stroke of our citizens on that bright
July morning stirred the country fiOni
coast to coast. Thinkers, writers and
talkers have discussed it in every com'
munity in the land.
We have succeeded not only in
throwing the L W. v. out of Bisbee
but throwing them into the sharp
glare of public inspection and public
condemnation.

Has an Invention
To End the War
Joseph G. Walker, a patient at the
Cochise county hospital, has an inven-
tion that he declares will end the war
in a rush in favor of the allies if
adopted by this country. It is nothing
less than the arrangement of a series
of mirrors to catch the sun's rays anu
throw them from mirror to mirror ami
thence through a powerful glass from
which they are projected through
space in the form of a single terrible
and death dealing -heat ray. Walker
claims that it will slay from afar; that
it will devastate the German trenches
from a distance of three miles.
"I killed a cat with it." said Wal
ker, "just to show the soldiers at Doug
las how it would work." He is going
to present this invention to L'ncle'

REVIEW LEASED WlUE
(By Review Leaseu Wire)
NEW YORK. July 2S. Short cover
ing was again the paramount influ
ence in today's llsht operations, the
oversold condition of the list being
seen in the 1 to 2 pains, recorded by
leading stocks. noIaWy -war issues.
Advances were largely surrendered
In the profit-taking of the final hour,
the market closing, however, with
firm tone.
Rails were Ignored throughuot Unit
ed States Steel it one tirtie showed a
one point rise but soon surrendered its
gain.
Metals ' were inconspicuous. Total
sales amounted to 223,000 shares.
The bank statement reports an actu
al loss of almost $50,000,000 In reserv
es of members held by the federal re
serve bank and a decrease of slightly
more than $37.000,(HIO in excess re
serves, still leaving the total excess
well more than $100,000,000.
Bonds were irregular on very limit
ed offerings, the Liberty issue being
quoted at 99.38 to 99.40, with occasion
al sales as low as 99.25. Total sales,
par value,' aggregated $1,270,000. U. S.
bonds, old issues, were unchanged on
call during the week.
J CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 28. Anxiety over
shipping complications due to the
switchmens' strike did a good deal to
day to cause an all-around advance in
values of grain and provisions. Corn
finished strong, to 376 net higher
with September at 1.634 and Decem
ber 1.19H to 1.19'4. Wheat closed un
settled. 3 to 8 up, at 2.60 July and
2.29 September. Oats showed a jump
of 14 to 1 and provisions 10 to 27.
.Unfavorable crop news -from North.
Dakota and Western Canada increased
bullish sentiment regarding wheat.
Despite the outlook for a huge crop,
the oats market rose with corn. The
strike of switchmen here gave reason
for serious apprehension that the
movement of the crop might be delay
ed. Strike difficulties curtailing the
arrival of hogs led to a decided up
turn in provisions. Belgian relief pur
chases counted also as an element of
strength.
- WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July 2S. Professional
traders had the field to themselves in
this week's negligible dealings, which
incidentally marked the third anni
versary of the war.
Prices again responded to bear pres
sure prompted by adverse develop
ments at home and across the water,
together with the utter lack of public
inquiry for stocks.
War prices and taxes again engaged
attention. " ' !
Railroad earnings for June are
showing up very favorably and corn
prospects, except in Isolated spots, are
Increasingly bright.
Forecasts of the United States Steel
earnings for the second quarter, to be
published next Tuesday, range from
$15,000,000 to $25,000,000 over those of
the preceding period, although allow
ance is made for changed conditions In
that industry. General trade is report
ed to be satisfactory but authorities
lay more than ordinary stress upon the
undertone of the conservatism due to
uncertain government regulations.
I ies. The camper shares are expected
to work higher.

the use of these tablets: "I had a bad
spell with my stomach about six
months ago, and was troubled for two
or three weeks with gas and severe
pains in the pit of my stomach. Our
druggist advised me to take Chamber
lain's Tablets. I took a bottle home
and the first dose relieved me wonder
fully, and I kept on taking them until
I was cured." .These tablets A'o not
relieve pain, but after the pain has
been relieved may prevent Its recur
rence. " Adv.

BE BRIEF, PLEASE
County Recorder Krebs writes the
Review asking that we announce to
all persons writing in for information
about the draft to make the letters
plain and brief. He wishes them to
give the precinct in which they regis

as can be answered "yes" or "no."
The office Is snowed under with let

are not specific and cause much ex

posed of 200 pages and it is a pretty
big job to go through it for a name

COMMISSIONS REVOKED
On account of disorderly conduct
and being Intoxicated three commis
sions have been revoked by the sher
iff's office. The three special depu

are Richard Cox; Henry Wright and

not stand for that sort of conduct on
the part of any of the deputies and
their commissions will be revoked as
soon as any report of that kind is
made to the office and the cases inves
tigated. Green was locked up last
night In the branch county jail and It
is probable that a charge will be
placed against him of disturbing the
peace.

that Miss Pruitt had been reported

Conditions In Bisbee
And Jerome Assuming
Their Normal Aspect
Operations in All Other Districts in the State Still at a Stand
still Loyal Americans Are Flocking to Warren District
to Secure Work With L W. W. Now Minus Quantity
Mines Will Pay Huge Takes This Year State Rate Will
Probably Be Higher This Year. f
The situation In Arizona copper mining districts which hate suffered
the precipitation of so-called strikes by I. W. W. during the lasl two
months, seems to be at a standstill except in the Bisbee and Jerome districts.
The strike in Bisbee ended abruptly with the deportation of L W W.
on July 12, as it did in Jerome with deportations made in the preceding
week. In both districts the mines have gained men steadily ever since.
'Abatement of L "W. W. terrorism in
to work of many men who had withheld
element In the case of Bisbee, every train during the last week has brought
Americans from different uoints of the country, some of them old time em
ployes, who are coming with intention of making the district the one big
strictly American copper mining camp
plished, it is held that there will be
years, if ever again, while the infusion of progressive blood will bring about
expansion in individual endeavor and operations in the district which it is
believed will in a very few years place it at the very front among copper
mining centers.
Each day of the present week has shown Increasing numbers of men go
ing to work at the different properties. The end of the month will see con
ditions at this rate very near restored to normal, both on the surface and
underground. The tonnage of ore going out has been climbing daily. It
has reached a point where the last possibility of embarrassment to the smel
ters at Douglas is removed. It is now assured that the record will be
achieved of having kept the latter going at full capacity regardless of the
crippling of the mines. The strike loss is therefore confined mainly to the
mine payrolls and to the loss of ore production, which cannot be caught up
with. ' There has also, of course, been a considerable amount of money loss
to the companies through lessened efficiency and upkeep of workings, main
tenance of workings and plants, and in increased protection expenses which
were necessary, and are not yet entirely abated.
In Clifton and Mo'renci, the situation Is unchanged, with no prospect for
the early resumption of work, although destitution Is coming about among
many of the Mexicans lured into striking by the L W. W and these may
ultimately npset the program with violence wreaked upon those who misled
them, with promises of winning the strike demands in the course of a few
days.

Mines Will Pay Huge Tax.
PHOENIX, July 28. Basing calculations upon the vaulatlon fixed for this
year by the State Tax commission upon producing mines of Arizona, and
using the tax rate of last year, they will pay in round numbers $256,000 the
month into the treasuries of the state and the mining counties. The daily
payment will be something more than $8,500. These figures are based upon
the combined tax rate of Cochise county and the state last year, the Cochise
county rate being the lowest of any of the mining counties. The combined
rate was v. 93 cents on the $100. That portion represented in the state tax is
spread over the entire state, lifting part of the burden of the agricultural as
well as the mining counties, and in its total is a big item for the consideration
of all taxpayers.
It Is probable that the state rate will be higher this year than last, as
much being reasonable of expectation in view of war time conditions which
must be taken care of. In that event the tax levied upon the producing mines
will represent a proportionate increase over the minimum total arrived at
through taking the low mining county rate as the medium for figuring the
total payments which the mining companies will make in taxes on their pro
duction during the year, and which in round numbers totals tax payments
of $3,306,000.
Gila county, where the producers have been shut down all of this month,
and Cochise county, in which production has been shortened since the latter
half of June, carry nearly two-thirds of the assessed total valuation put upen
the producers of the state, $330,631,944.76. Their shortened production will
tell Jn next year's' valuation, as will that also of the mines of Yavapai county,
where the Jerome strikes cut into the better part of two months' production,
and from which recovery to normal output Is yet to be made. In Greenlee
county production is also entirely annulled and has been for a month, which
will mean another material cut in next year's available tax money from
mining resources.
Altogether, so-called strikes now In effect in the state in furtherance
of I. W. W. anti-government propaganda, t this time confined to Gila and
Greenlee counties, are causing loss to the taxpayers of the state of more than
$3,000 a day, or for the month the producers in Gila and Greenlee counties
have been out of commission, more than $100,000. Every day of continuance
of effectiveness of the I. W. W. terrorism which is keeping the mines of
these counties out of production, mean that much additional loss to the
Individual taxpayers of the state, who must dig down in their own pockets
to make up the deficit at the rate of $3,000 the day.

Competitive Offers By Small
Dealers Deaden the Market.
Competitive offers by small dealers
on all inquiries for the most limited
amounts which have dime into the
market have resulted in quotations by
theBe interests reaching the lowest
levels they have been in a long time,
says the Boston Financial News.
For August and September deliver
ies, these interests are asking from
26 1-2 to 27 1-2 cents per pound, while
the last quarter of the yeaf has been
offered at from 251-2 to 261-2 cents,
the time of shipment and the quantity
being requested governing the quota
tion. '
Probably at no time since the begin
ning of the war in August, 1914. has
the stagnation in the market been as
pronounced as it has been for the past
few days. Buyers apparently will not
purchase, and inquiries on which it
was known that manufacturing con
tracts depended have been withdrawn
during the last week or 10 days.
while only small contracts were
placed during recent weeks, there has
been absolutely nothing doing since
the statement by President Wilson ad
vocating that low prices' for products
not only be made to the government
or its requirements, but also to the
regular consumers.
Regular Users' Inactive
Since the middle of last week the
regular users have kept away from
the market entirely and are merely
waiting for the government to make a
price which some of them conOdently
expect will be the level which they
will be charged on their needs in the
future.
It has been noted for several days
that any small inquiry has caused a
flurry among the less important sellers
of the metal and the new quotations
which have been made by these inter
ests represent a decline of 2 to 3 cents
in the last few days and a drop of
twice that much from the levels pre
vailing less than a nAmth ago.
The geperal impression in the trade
is that there will be no return to buy
ing until the government finally set
tles on the price it will pay for its
metal and much speculation is being
indulged in as to whether the domestic
producers will be compelled to supply
the allies at the same figure that will
be named for this government.
Outcome la Mystery
All in all, the copper situation just
now is more unsettled than in several
years, with no signs of any improve
ment. There is no market to speak
of and a tone can only be made on the
nominal quotations which are ruling.

East Butte Company Makes
Surprisingly Good Showing
During July in Spite of At

' BUTTE, July '26. The East ' Butte
Company made a surprisingly good
showing in its output for the month
of June. The larger of the two lurn
aces at the Pittsmont 3iuelter went
down on June 15, and the smaller one
shut down on June 20, on account of
the strike of the miner, electricians,
machinsts and mill and smeller men.
In spite of this the output of cop
per for the month amounted to 1.519,
230 pounds, and the production of sil
ver ot 44.621 ounces.
The output for the month of May
when operations were continuous
throughout the month amounted to
2,008,060 pounds of copper. .The fall
ing off in June was 4SS.830 pounds.
The company is taking advantage
of tht present shutdown to make many
needed repairs, and put the smelter as
well as the mines and their workings
Into splendid shape for operating as

The company offered to pay shaftmen
$8 a day, or $2 a day more than the
demands of miners, but the Metal
Mine Workers' Union refused to per
mit its members to accept the offer
until the entire mining trouble was
settled. In the meantime, changes
have been made at the Butte-Detroit
mill so that by August 1 the latter
will be in a position to handle from
200 to 400 tons of maganese ore per
day. Indications are that the labor
situation will be cleared up before that

THE B1SBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY MORNING, JULY 29, 1917.
COPPER OUTPUT FOR FIRST HALF
OF 1917 EXCEEDS BILLION POUNDS
Copper production from the principal mines and smelters of North and
South America approximated 1,085,815,413 pounds during the first six months
ot 1917. But for the miners' strikes which started in June, output would
have been considerably greater.
The Butte district in June showed a substantial falling off, due princi
pally to Anaconda's drop from 28,000,000 to 20,000,000 pounds. In Arizona
losses were general, all the properties with the exception of Ray Consolidated
being affected by strike. The Alaskan properties of Kennecott Copper Cor
poration were also shut down with the exception of the Beatson mine.
June's total 'copper yield was about 167,000,000 pounds, comparing with
190.000.000 pounds in May. The July production will be far less than that
of the month just ended as some of the mines will not have turned out a single
pound of copper.

This list of-producers does not by any means include all the mines con
tributing to the total output of copper as many of them s.hip their product
direct to custom smelters which do not make known their figures. The
American Smelting & Refining company, controlling many custom smelters,
makes no monthly figures public, but the aggregate far surpasses the total of
any individual competitor.
United Verde Extension Mining company, which has climbed above 5,000,
000 pounds of copper a month, sends its ore to several smelters pending the
construction and completion of Its own plant. The figures credited to Phelps
Dodge & Co., and Consolidated Arizona, include the bulk ot the Extension
company's output
North Butte ships to Anaconda, but the disastrous fire of a few weeks
ago quickly followed by the Butte strike has put that property out of the
running .temporarily.
The curtailment in mine and smelter operations now in effect will not be
felt ft refineries until late in August or early September. The extent of re
finery curtailment which will then develop will depend entirely upon the
length of time elapsing before the miners' strike has been settled. Boston

Kingman people visited the mine and
mill last Sunday and found one of the
most op-to-date properties in the

who has been with the company for
sometime in the northern country,
superintended the erection of the mill.
Superintendent Russell of the mine
is rushing work on the main tunnel
which already is in 7C0 feet, in order
to determine exact values of the vein
and to locate the junction of the rich
silver and copper veins. He believes
that the two veins will Junction a
short distance from the present breast

KINGMAN, July 28. Several sam
ples of rich ore were brought in from
the property of the Victor Copper com
pany in the Walnut creek section of j
the Wallar-al mountains a few days
ago by J. W. Oney and S. E. Guthrey.
Although no assays have been made
as yet, parties familiar with the ores
of that particular locality estimate
that it would run from $150 to $200
and from the appearance of the gold
in the horn spoon, it is indicated that
the Judgment of these gentlemen was
correct.
The main vein on which these
claims are located is a kig one in
which the only meial value found was
from the copper si most solely so that
the discovery of this small gold vein
lying alongside was a most pleasant
one for the company. This property
is one of the most promising of that
section of the country and should
prove among the winners as soon as
a small amount of development work
is done and as Messrs. Guthrey and
Oney are lending every available ef
fort to get things into shape. It is pre
dicted that it will not be long before
work will be progressing on these fav
orable showings.

SALOME, Ariz., July 28. The new
owners of the Ocotillo mine, situated
to the south of Mineral Valley in the
Alamos, plan an immediate campaign
of active development of the great
old mine, which has a record of pro
duction in excess of 116,000,000 with a
total depth of less than 300 feet
Engineer Ray W. Arms, who is
largely interested in the new company
left H. V. White to mRke plans for
leading stockholders, to make plans
for the erection of a permanent camp
and the immediate resumption of
work.
Arms was at the property for three
days and with the aid of a miner nam
ed Fisher, cleared out the old shaft
for a depth of firty feet, at which
point a bulkhead was built by the for
mer owners and above which point
practically all the values to date have
been extracted.
Don't Overfill j
Your Batteries
"Overfilling your battery with wa
ter is as bad as not filling it at all,"
says Mr. Rogers, the Willard expert
"When the -cells are too full, rough
riding or the rapid charging of the
battery which comes frcm long sus
tained or rapid driving, forces the elec
trolyte to oversow and run into the
bottom of the battery box. And it is
only a short time before the acid elec
trolyte has eaten out the bottom of
the box.
"The mot'orist should keep in mind
the fact that although it is pure dis
tilled water he puts into the cells, it
is not water but diluted acid that over
flows, and this acid corrodes either a
wooden or a steel battery box.
"In filling the battery cover the top
of the plates witli about one-half incn
W water. More than this is unneces
sary. And this depth of water' will
allow for the movement of electrolyte
caused by rough driving or by rupid
charging."

fl.50 to $3.44 gold-silver per ton. Sej
lected samples of the ore showing
c'lalcoi yrite and a trace of copper
glance, taken more recently, asayul
as high as 12 per cent copper and $10
gold-silver per ton. In the opinion of
Mr. Thomas the surface indication!
of mineralization on the Blue Monster
i estate are Identical with ttiose of the
known ore bodies of the producing
mines of Jerome.
An additional asset of great value
to the company in the opinion of Mr.
Thomas is the fact that Cherry Creek
runs through the property for nearly a
mile and affords about 75 miners'
, inches of water during the dryest pe
' riod of the year. Through medium of
a fall of about 300 feet that can be
! obtained by fluming, he estimates that
I at least 100 horsepower can be gen
! erated for driving mine and mill ma
i chinery, in addition to supplying water
' to the camp for domestic purposes.
; The company holds title to this water
right and millsite. The state highway
j from Prescott to Jerome crosses the
: porperty and affords quick and easy
access to both and to the right-of-way
of the railroad recently usrveyed from
Mesa on the(south to the United Verde
Extension mine on the north. The lat

sion mine and smelter with the tail

The fact that Boston and other i
Massachusetts capital is interested in;
the development of the estate of the!
Blue Monster Copper company Is wel-j
corned here as the possible forerun-,
ner of further investments in local '
mining enterprises by the people of a!
commonwealth whose name is so close-!

industry of ITontana. Michigan and;

July is the month when, under nor
mal conditions, the makers of fash
on take a long breath and look for
vard to developing the winter modes.
This year,-' however, everything is
'opsyturvy, and we do not know what
day will bring forth. There is al
vays the possil ility that several of
he mill properties may be taken over
)y the government for munition pur
poses, and also that the shortage of
'atbr may effect the output of the
nills. - It is therefore very difficult to
.tate authoritatively just what will
be the winter 'mode in fabric and de
sign. The day may come when, like
Paris, New York will be obliged to
jse what it has, rather than what it
iesires.
" Under these complicating circum
stances it is natural that our atten-
lion should be more definitely direct
;d to planning sports clothes for th.-j ;
lutumn season, and it is indeed a j
pleasure to work out new details fo;
the months when sport Is king. Bey !

Then thee is covert, that hard-
wearing material so much used in
England before the war. American
aomen, unless unreservedly given to
ramping and hunting, have never real-
y accepted covert. Their objection
has always teen that the stuff, al
though of iron-wearing quality, was
oo pallid in the conventional color
ings to be becoming. But considering

s a likelihood that the supply of
army serge will not equal the demand,
covert will become one of the useful
materials of the early fall.
It lacks the color quality's of khaki,
but it can be made up just as satisfac
torily and will stand being combined
with silk or velvet in bright colors.
For all sports costumes the straight
lines of the present will continue and
as interest in women's share of the
war work increases, not only such out
fits, but tailleurs for every-day wear
will become tinged with military se-1
verity. This Is In direct onnnnitinn

Fashion says hosiery should be

Nothing prettier or mote expressive

imagined than a voile frock with ruf

The smock is at the pinnacle of pop
ularity and is especially pretty for
blouses and children's dresses.
For coolness and charm a crepe neg
ligee is hard to excel. When traveling
it ccn be tucked away in a tiny corner
of your tag and does not wrinkle.
A simple yet popular blouse is made
cf white handkerchief linen with pale

and indications point to its being with
us throughout the winter.
rashion lovers can be satisfied with
an informal dinner gown of black sat
in and silver over which a shaped
mantle of black chiffon is tastefully
draped.
A short coat made from large check
ed material and trimmed with fringe
or sailing, large baggy pockets in
front adds much to the style.
Long drapery is excellent for the
skirts of today.
White silk jersey makes up very
pretty when touched off with hand em
broidery in bright colors.
Coral beads form embroidered mo-
UIS on an arusuc evening gown or
white satin.
For your evening wrap a cape of

White silk crepe, with envelope
pockets and trimmed in large pearl
buttons make an ideal sports skirt.
A sports blouse of striped linen,
blue, rose or green with white collar
8nd cuffs, worn with a sports skirt of

for outings
The local stores are displaying a
wonderful line of new fall suits, they

Ribbon trimmings ve very good on
evening dresses of Georgette crepe

The togs of the younger set should

tended that Bisbee was a summer re

now that I am absolutely correct. If
we could only persuade grass and
flowers to grow in the rocks we would
surely be in paradise.
"This burg is on the square, and is
laid out in perfect squares more than
we can claim for Bisbee and is in
the heart of the great Panhandl?

only for grazing and is now a great
cattle section."
It is quite noticeable the great num

(By Review Leased Wire).
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, July 28. The arrival of the
first contingent of the American army
in France serve to recall the fact that
the United States is entering a war al
ready old and wise wise with the
dearly bought wisdom of three long
adventurous years and steeped in all
the diabolical wickedness that inces
sant delving into the deviltries of de
struction can bring R it
Having escaped the first terrors ot
weapons which German science hau
evolved through toiling years of mill
tary preparation, the American divi
sions will nevertheless plunge event
ually into a seething cauldron whict
has grown from the unavoidable p'olicj
of "fighting the devil with fire." They
will have quickly to learn not only tc
take the awful German frightfulnest
with calm endurance, but to return i;
with an ever-increasing measure. In
doing this many nerve-testing and soul
searching experiences undoubtedly lie
before them, but there are alread)
thousands of yung Americans in tht
Canadian fend British ranks who have
proved themselves traditionally wor
thy in the scorching flames of moden
war. '
Americans Fortunate
The American forces are fortunate
indeed to be able to base their educa
tion upVm the bitter lessons learned
by the French and British soldiers in
all the eventful days that have follow
ed that first rush of battle in 1914
Marvelously complete books of instruc
tion have been builded upon those ex
periences and out of these the Ameri
can soldiers will glean tne last-word
knowledge that will fit them for the
foremost trenches.
First of. all, ' when they take their
place, will come the baptism of fire
from the noisy black high-explosive
German shells that scream in from afar
and burst with terrifying reports
sometimes in most unexpected places.
The Germans are great believers both
In noise and high explosive. They even
' mix their adored "H-E". with their
shrapnel shells wtiich break high in
the air and send their bullets show
ering down with the whine of an angry J
winter wind, ine Americans soon
will learn to distinguish the individual
songs of the various shells, for there
is not the slightest doubt that the mo
ment he discovers they are in the
"line," the German will turn every
available calibre of weapon against
them in a ' flourish of introductory
"hate." 'They' will come over In order
these shrieking, grumbling missiles
ranging in size and noise all the
way from the nasty little pip-squeaks
of whiz-bangs, up through the four-
p'oint-twos, the five-point-nines and
then on to what the British Tommies
laconically call "the big stuff" tne
eight and eleven-inch howitzer shells
and the projectiles from heavy cali
bered long range naval guns,, known
without affection as "Whistling
Percys."
Baptism of Bombs
There will be little Opportunity to
hear a "Big Bertha." for those famous
old 42-centimeter howitzers are seldom
used nowadays. It is believed that the
Germans planned to bombard Arras
with them, using prusslc acid shells,
but the British advance on Easter
Monday last put a stop to that par
ticularly nefarious scheme against the
already sadly battered little Arl'jls ca
thedral city.
There is also awaiting the new
American army a bounteous baptism
of bombs and hand grenades and the
still more dismaying Introduction to
the ghastly rattle of the machine gun
and the sinister swish of' spraying bul
lets sounds well calculated to stab
with a moment tf fear the heart of the
bravest man.
But above all the American soldiers
must equip themselves to endure the
lethal gas that will be sent over
against them in huge poisonous, vap
orish clouds, or Ehowered upon tnem in
a deluge Of heavily charged cylinders
and shells. They must prepare to deal
also with the treacherous lachryma
tory gas which, while not dangerous
to life, irritates the tear duU until
one cries with blinded, smarting eyes
for hours. The surprise of both these
gases is . their altogether pleasant
smell, the lethal variety suggesting
the clean oUVr of a sanitary hospital
ward, while the so-called tear gas has
the appetizing scent of crushed ripe
apples or cider.
There is also the reason-shaking
terror of the "flamenwerfer," with its
roaring stream of liquid fire flaring
with the velocity of a high pressure
fire nozzle and with an toff-pouring of
smoke rising like a black cyclone cloud
to the heavens.
Boomerang Weapons
The first day of their stay in battle
trenches the Americans will make the
acquaintance 'jf a very old and scarce
ly cherished, friend of the Tommies
and IWIus another member of the
Werfer family, known as "Minnie."
This is the Germ.m mine thrower or
minenwerfer, which flings over at
short range great heavy projectiles
known as "flying pigs" because oi
their wabbly, ungainly flight. They
go off with a deafening roar, expend
ing more energy on n'jlse, however,
than on material damage.
A notable development of the war
has been the dread with which the
Germans have seen weapons of their
and with a 'steadily increasing inten
sity. Their prisoners speak of the
terror these weapons have caused and
declare the German higher command is
realizing all too late the Frankensteins
it brought into being. While the en
tente allies are multiplying these ter
rors on the lines laid down by Em
peror William himself, the Germans,
isolated so long from the world find
their resources and materials constant
ly failing both as to means ot carry
ing on this stylo of warfare and, what
is more important to them, combat
ting the retributive measures under
taken' by British and French.
Asphyxiating gas may be taken as
a striking example. The whole world
was shocked when Germany first re
leased those poison clouds during
their second attack on Ypres when the
allies, little suspecting such a weapon,
had rrt protection whatever against it
The horror of those days when men
engulfed by the lethal waves died ag
onizing deaths will never be forgot
ten. But the manner in which the Ca
nadian troops rallied and prevented
the Germans breaking through in what
they hoped would be a victorious
march to Calais and Boulogne will
ever be one of the most thrilling stor
ies of the world war. Nowadays the
British fairly bathe the Germans In
every form of gas whenever the
slightest opportunity offers and pris
oners all say their losses in these at
tacks have been alarmingly heavy. Gas
is sent over in creeping banks of fog.
is shot over in bombs that suddenly
explode in trenches and at entrances
to dugouts, while no billets or sleeping
quarter for troops in rest miles back
of the fighting line are safe from the
gas shells which are ever knocking at
their doors.
Dead Are Envied
The bitterness of it all to the Got
mans, however, is the fact that daily
they find they have less and less rubber
with which to construct their gas
masks, many of which are very infer
ior and offer but poor protection to
the fighting men against gases that
constantly are becoming more power
ful.
Foiling and b!azing oil drums whicii
they find exploding about them in scald
ing and incendiary fury, heavy shells
which break over them s putting
streams of melted lead, are other spe
cies of the dread chickens of fright
fulness that are daily flying lome :o
the German roost.
It is small wonder that half-finishea
letters found On Germans in the front
lines dwell upon the terror of the war,
or that some go so far as to speak a
desperate envy of the dead.

To be suspected of being a dyna
miting "wobbly," to be surrounded by
a narmed cordon of deputies and cit
izens, and to be surprised while fix
ing his gasoline torch, was the exper
ience of a Lowell plumber, yesterday
afternoon. Unaware and unknowing
he gave the people of the Lowell sub
urb one of the greatest scares It has
enjoyed in a long, long time.
There was a leak in the roof of the
Lowell Hotel building. It needed fix
ing. The rams do not wait for leaky
roofs, and the Arkansas traveler, who
couldn't repair his roof while it
poured and who didn't think the root
needed any repair when it didn't rain
has no place in Bibbee.
So a plumber was secured and sent
to the roof. He started his vrork. and
was using a gasoline torch in his ef
forts to stop the leak. The torch Le-
came unmanageable
warning and without
plumber, blew up.
The scene Is now
Main street, Lowell.
White smoke rose from above the
Lowell Hotel building, accompanied
by a loud report. I'eopie on the Iow-
ell street immediately decided there
was trouble abroad. It must be a
wobbly" with a bomb, who had
carelessly allowed it to explode pre
maturely, instead of hen he threw
on the street, among pedestrians
and traffic.
Actiig on the impulse, deputies
were secured. A cordon of arnif d men
surrounded the hotel. Then so'iie of
the more venturesome proceeded to
nvestigate. Earh flicht of stairs was
approached with caution, for the
'wobbly"- might have had another
bomb. Fina.'ly the attic was reached
and the trap door leading to the root
spproaihed with caution.
Looking out upon the roof, through
a mere crack in tlie door, the siht
was trully appalling;. The men saw
a lonely plumber v.ho was trying to
cet his gasoline torch in such shape
that he could finish the roof asainst
Arizona rains.

BURY OF U. 8. INTO WAR IS MOST
IMPORTANT DEVELOPMENT OF WORLD
I SAYS MILITARY EXPERT
ONFLIC
LOXDOX, July 2S America's en-, military nation and cannot become a
trance mid tne war is the iiiost iui-' miiitary poWer soon enough to play
ponaiit ucvciopiueut ot the-third year j any part in this war. We pr0Ved that
ot the great coiihiet in the. op.nion of lheory wroiig aa you will prove her
Alitor oeueial rrederiek. B. Maurice, tneorieg regarding the United States
Kmet direc-ior ol .Military uperauous
at the British war oihce, as expressed
in an interview in which he reviewed
tne mam events of the tnird year and
summed up the present situation
wrong.
"What was it that lead Germany
into war with the United States? She
lound she could not win on land. It
was necessary to try U-Boat warfare.
Today, .Major Utneral Maurice said, . .TMs.t gaid the german theorists, 'will
Germany, whose wnoie military gospel
was to prosecute a vigorous otteusive,
is reduced to "a pititui state of mili
tary helplessness in which she is
barely abie to bang on" in the hope
that her submarine wiii force tne
people of tne entente powers to de
mand peace al a time when Germany
has the "big pawns" with wuich to
luate a bargain.
-"Speaking lrom a military point of
view," saia Major General Maurice,
'the greatest event of the third year
ct the war is the fact that the Ameri
can people joined us. Up to the'pres
ent .France and Russia always have
been able to say to their people that
the English power had not yet been
developed to the fullest extent and
that, when England's full weight was
i the field, the pressure on the
French and Russians would be some
what lessened. That still is true, but
only to a limited extent Even Eng
land is getting near the point where
she must say that she cannot extend
her work much further in France.
Meanwhile, the strain in the continent
al countries is becoming greater and
greater and the French are in real
need of more and more support.
' German Reasoning Wrong.
"Of course, the same, is true and
probably in far greater measure in
enemy quarters.
"But the whole lesson of the three
years of warfare- is to emphasize the
military maxim that the man with the
last reserves is going to win, and we
etill have got the whole power of the
United States to -draw upon. The
United States is today the general re
serve of the entente. With that re
serve Intact, we may look the fourth
year in the face With entire confi
dence. .
"Germany has made the same mis
take with regard to the United States,
ad three years ago, she made with re
gard to England. She argued, 'we
do not believe England will come in
bnt, if she does come in, she is not a
defeat Enpland and bring the reign of
the entente to an end. We do not be
lieve the United States will come in
but, if she does, she is an unrailitary
nation, has no army, cannot create one
for many months, perhaps years, cer
tainly cannot become a military factor
soon enough to play any part in this
war.
First Year Of War.
"That reasoning sounds unbelievable
to us but a drowning man clutches at
a straw. We believe the German theo
rists will be proved as wrong in their
estimates of the United States as they
were in their estimates of, England.
"You asked me what is the outlook
at the opening of the fourth year of
the war. First, let me give you in ep
itome the history of. the first three
years as I understand it.
'The first year, broadly speaking,
was an attempt by Germany to put
into effect elaborate plans which her
military .strategists had been prepar
ing over the space of many long years.
The first phase was a' concentrated
attack on France and Belgium during
a certain allotted period of time, in
which the Germans estimated it would
be Impossible for. Russia"' to disturb
them in the east
"The attack on France was checked,
first on the Marae. later on the Tser
and at Ypres, although France and
Belgium suffered severely in the pro
cess. "Germany then, according- to her
plan, took the defensive on the west
ern front and turned her offensive ef
fort eastward in an effort to knockout
Russia. Here again she failed, al
though her attack enormously weak
ened Russia's offensive power.
Old Scheme Abandoned.
"In the autumn of 1915. Germany,
definitely abandoned her old pre-war
strategic scheme and started in on a
new plan developed since the war be
gan, namely, an effort to upbuild Mi-tel-Europa'
as a great block composed
of four so-called Central Powers which
would command the road to the east
The autumn campaign of 1915 consist
ed, in essence, of the furtherance of
this scheme by conquering Serbia,
bringing in Bulgaria and haulting our
Dardanelles effort by rushing muni
lions, supplies and soldiers to the as
sistance of the Turks.
"By the winter of 1915, Germany
had gone a long way toward realiza
tion of her own ambition and this
point represents to my mind the grand
climateric of Germany's offensive pow
er. All this time Great Britain had
been building up armies, and with the
beginning of 1916. we for the first time,
had a real army in the field.
' "With the spring of 1916, Germany
had come to realize that the conquest
of Russia was impossible, Russia was
too massive to kill or crush. So the
German staff again turned on France
and the Verdun attack was the re
sult "With, the defeat of Germany at Ver
dun came a turning of the tide of
which further manifestation was seen
in a successful British offensive. Pre
vious British military efforts had been,
comparatively speaking, minor opera
tions or operations undertaken In sup
port of the French. At the Somme we
started our new work and really great,
important work it was, although a
great deal of the contemporary effect
of the Verdun' defeat and of the Som
me victory was neutralized by Ger
many's push into Rumania. The Ru
manian push, however, viewed in true
historical perspective was merely
flash in the pan. .The German military
power already was on the decline and
the offensive strength was nothing like
what it had been the year before.
. Germany In Pitiful State.
"The end of 1916 found the situa
tion between the two great groups of
contestants about equally balanced but
with the scales leaning slightly in fa
vor of the entente.
"The. year 1917 has presented a still
roiser picture. During the whole
third year of the war Germany and her
her allies have attempted nothing on
land. They everywhere have been on
the defensive. The Turks, lost Bag;
dad and the Sinai peninsula. On Ger
many's eastern frontier, although the
Russian revolution enormously weak
ened Russia's military power, Germany
was incapable of taking advantage of
the situation. On the Austrian front,
the Italians got into powerful blows.
In the west the British and French
struck repeatedly and the Germans
have been powerless to answer back
"This is the pitiful state to which
we have reduced the great power
whose whole military gospel was sum
med up in the phrase "vigorous offen
sive.' Germany's military helpless
ness owing to the strain on her man
power, material and resources, is such
that today she barely is able to hang
on and her only hope Is that she may
find some way of similarly wearing us
down and forcing us out of the war
before we get up momentum to drive
her back.
"At present Germany is banking on
the U-boat. She hopes against hope
that the U-boat, will reduce the people
of the entente powers to the same
state of want privation and suffering
which she has been enduring for
months and years past She hopes to
make the entente peoples cry enough
and start peace parleys while she still
has got the big pawns with which to
bargain at a peace confernence."

LONDON, July . 28. The National

COURAGE AND CRUELTY.
It is one of the mean and morbid
lies that physical' courage is connected 1
with cruelty. The Tolstoian and Kip
Iingite are nowhere more at one than
in maintaining this. They have, I be
lieve, some small sectarian quarrel
with each other, the one saying that
courage must be abandoned because
it is connected with cruelty, and the
other maintaining that cruelty is
charming because it is a part of
courage. But it. is all, thank God, a
lie. An energy and boldness of body
may make a man stupid or reckless or j
dull or drunk or hungry, but it does
not make him spiteful. G. K. Ches-j

Atrocities Committed by Teu
tons in Every Territory In
vaded by Them Made Pub
lic by Engineers' Commit
tee. LONDON. July 28. The American
Committee of Engineer in London, re
cently formed to help as it might In
the prosecution of the war, has ap
pointed a sub-committee whose chief
function it is to brings together ac
counts of such acts and words of the
enemy as they think should be present
ed to the American people "lest we for
get what a determined and ruthless
enemy we are fighting." This sub
committee is made up of men who
have had exceptional opportunities to
study the events of the war, many of
them at first hand. In a. statement fur
ther explaining the reasons for . ap
pointing the sub-committee, the engi
neers' committee as a whole says: .
"Great care will be. taken in as
sembling only reliable information,
chiefly the words of the Germans
themselves, in order that they may be
condemned out of their own mouth3.
The committee believes that there are
still many good people in America as
in England who say to themselves, if
not aloud: 'Are the Germans as bad
as painted r We hope that a weekly
record of German doings and sayings
will help answer that question and be
a reminder that such a spirit manner
of reasoning and acting as the enemy
manifests now no less than at the
the beginning of the war must be met
and overcome, 'if this world is to be
a safe and fit place to live in."
First Statement
The first statement of the sub-committee,'
under the caption. "German
ism Week by Week," follows:
"The policy. of the Germans with re
gard to the deported Belgians seems
o be to send home such as are too
weak to work. Thus of 537 able-bodied
men, slate-quarriers in the Belgian
town of Ecaussians, deported to Ger
many, 62 died there, and of the 210
repatriated, all in a lamentable con
dition, 70 have since died. We are not
in a position to check these figures,
though they compare reasonably with
' figures from other places. But what
j we do know and this is the true Ger-
manic touch the Germans imposed a
fine of $1,000 on this town, because
they refused to hold their usual Bach
elor Tea Party on Whit Monday, be
cause they refused in other words to
celebrate their fellow-citizens' depor
tation into slavery and starvations
Events like these are to the Kaiser's
taste, and are daily occurring.
"We have the absolute evidence of
a neutral who was present of the fol
lowing circumstances in southern Ser
bia. A Serbian farmer shot an Aus
tralian officer in the leg (not mean
ing to kill him) because the officer re
fused to pay for food stuffs he had re
quisitioned from the farm, as be was
bound to do. The ball struck an ar
tery and the officer died. Thereupon
the Austrian military authorities shot
every tenth Serbian male in three sur
rounding villages."
The town of Mons. famous for the
retreat was fined J100.000 the other
day because a Belgian newspaper, pub
lished in Holland, stated that the Duke
of Bavaria was at Mons during a re
cent allied air-raid. Mind you, there
was no evidence that anyone from
Mons had conveyed the information,
but one of the Duke's generals was
killed and the Germans were furious.
But this is not the first time that
Mons has been fined. It was fined
250.000 marks -in the first days of the
war as a contribution'. But this was
waived because, as the official poster
which says 'the people preserved such
good behavior.' '
U. S. Must Watch Coal.
"This good behavior did not prevent
the Germans frdm burning portions of
Mons, like every other town they en
tered. This general burning they af
terwards apologized for by saying that
'they had been fired at by civilians.'
This was not the case at Mons, ac-
I cording to their own statement of the
good behavior of the people.
I "Mons was later fined 10,000 marks
t because of a derailment , This was
an tne explanation, me ion tuuutu
asked for further details, only to re
ceive a written reply, stating that the
derailment had occurred months be
fore at such a spot which proved to
be 1U0 yards over the Mons line in the
town of Jemappes. Jeuiappes was fin
I ed an even amount. Mons protested
i that the derailment occurred outside
of the township and on the railroad,
jover which the German authorities,
i and not the commune, hd Jurisdic
j tion. . Nevertheless Mons had to pay
1 10,000 marks and before sundown.
Could anything be easier as a way of
making money? Could anything be
I more contemptible in the justice of
I things.

economic questions, discussing the o
loofc at the beginning of the fou t
year of the conflict.
3 saiJ M. Gide, "has spen I
about 70.000.000.000 on three years of
military effort. Yet in the thirty-sixth
month of hostili'ir-s, the French peo
ple are inviting ta short term treas
ury bonds as rreely as they were two
years ago. that is. at the rate of about
1000.ft00.000 a month."
As evidence of the excellence of
French credit, M. GUe pointed to the
co-oneration of the United State which
he said, "brings formiable aid to
Prance and her allies. This," be con
tinued, "not only removes all doubt
concerning the result of the war from
a military standpoint, but relieves the
financial situation tiy diminishing the
drain upon French gold.
"The monev which France has spent
to sustain her military effort inside
the country swells the figures of her
outlay to immense proportions but this
outlay cannot be. considered a. dead
loss except In such proportion as is
spent for steel, explosives, and other
material 'made to be destroyed. In
creased prices paid for every com
modity, it must be rememberd also.
,bave vastly increased the revenues of
the French people. Before the war
these revenues were 30.000,000,000 to
35.000,000.000 francs. Now they are
ko ooo.000.000 francs annually. . These
tmt formidable as the
IIPUICO
war debt may appear at first sigvt,
the problem of its liquidation is no
so alarming after all. '
"France can stand another year of
war outlay quite as well as she stood
the third year. It would be embarrass
ing for her to pay in gold for every
thing bought abroad, but this difficul
ty has been relieved by the credit gen
erously granted by the United States.
"France will get through the war fi
nancially sound, will re-construct her
industries rapidly and ber interior sit
uation will be liquidated without caus
ing any economic upheaval." Refer
ring to the situation of other belliger
ents, M. Gide said:
"I do not think any country will be
ruined by the war. All are more or
less In the same situation as France.
The only real drain upon their re
sources is what they pay abroad. The
base expenditure Is that which might
be called fictions; that is. the transfer
of money from the pockets of some
citizens to the pockets of others, a
transfer in which a great many new
fortunes have been built up but in
which the real riches of the country
have" been left untouched."
Referring to the economic measures
to be taken after the war and to the
complaints by Germany of an effort by
her enemies to ruin her economically.
M. Gilde said:
"The talk of an economic war after
the belligerents lay down their arms
has almost subsided. I consider it
neither possible nor useful for Ger
many to be crushed commercially.
She will be vanquished on the bat
tlefield, her military power will be
crushed, but she will be left, free to
work out her own economic destiny,

COM PANY DECLARES
Directors Decide to Sell Ships
to Avoid Loss by Subma
rines Stockholders Get
$500 for $2.50.
(By Review Leased Wire)
KOBE, Japan. July 28. A striking
example of the Japanese fortunes
made in the war shipping business is
found in the recent decision of the
Chuyetsu Steamship company to de
clare a dividend of 2,000 per cent. One
of the steamers of this company re
cently was sunk by the Germans, off
the Spanish coast. Thereupon the
officials decided, rather than run fur
ther risks, to take advantage of the
high price and dispose of its remain
ing vessels.
At liquidation each shareholder who
had originally paid but $2.50 for one
share of stock received $500 per' share.
A number of other Japanese ship
owners, preferring to profit by the
present extraordinary demand, are
selling their steamers and placing
their capital in some other business.
One of Kobe's new shipping million
aires recently sold a few steamers at a
profit of nearly $3,000,000.
What Is More
Valuable Than
Gold in Russia
(By Review Leased Wire)
PETROGRADE. July 28. How Is
Russia to Induce its peasant farmers
K part with .their precious stocks ot
wheat. That is the question which ia
wrinkling the brow of the minister of
supply, M. Peshekbonoff. Discussing
the subject before the all-Russia con
gress of workmen's and soldier's dele
gates, he said:
"The greatest difficulty or the food
situation just now is that the peas
ants refuse to give up their wheat.
In the old days, wheat was to be had
in exchange for money. But now
money is cheap and there is little to
be got for it. The peasant is there
fore extremely unwilling to exchange
bis wheat for mere money. The peas
ant population has lost its fa. In
m'jney and sticks to the one thing
which it has in its hands.
"There are plenty of things which
the peasant needs more than he needs
his wheat, but unless you caa make
those things available to him in bis
markets you won't be able to get his
wheat. The forcible seizure of wheat
from many million peasants is impos
sible. Yet something must be done
to prevent starvation In our cities.
If starvation should come to Petro
grad no power on earth could prevent
the collapse ot whatever government
happens to be In power.
"The task before toe ministry t
supply, then. Is to secure for the peas
ants supplies of manufactures aau
wares which they need. It Is getting
back to first principles of barter. The
task will be difficult because of the
lack ot raw materials and the disor
ganization of industry. Meanwhile
the peasants are hiding their wheat in
caches so unsuitable that serious loss
is certain to result."
Noah's Ark Bill
May Be Solution
To Hard Problem
(By Review Leased Wire.)
MEXICO CITY. July 23. A project
recently was submitted to Rafael Nl
to, under secretary of finance, which
evolved a new idea for the financial
betterment of the poorer agricultural
classes of Mexico. Among the em
ployes of the department of finance It
is known as "the Noah's Ark bilL" It
nmnoses that the government either
give to each agricultural family or aid
each family to buy two pigs, two goats,
two rabbits, a hen and a rooster, a
duck and a drake and pairs of othr
farmyard animals. The project asserts
that with but little care and expense
the natural increase of these famine
would speedily drive the wolf from
the doors of the .Mexican agriculturists.
