WASHINGTON. Oct. 26. The
Liberty Loan was gathering momen
tum today in its race to the finish.
Four hundred end thirty-five million
dollars measured the day's advance
and with the total nearing $4,000,000,
000 it looked as if the tremendous
driving power of 2,000,000 field work
ers might carry it across the $5,000,
000,000 line.
One 'More Day.
"One more day remains," Secretary i
McAdco announced tonight, "let every
patriot of America who has not sub-!
scribed place his name today upon the
roll of honor of the nation as a sub
scriber to the second Liberty Loan.
The man who is able to subscribe and
aoesn t win, or ought to be, a con-ecience-strieken
citizen on Sunday
morning."
Every available dollar is needed, of
ficial.! asserted, to bring the total up
to $5,000,000,000. Every agency
throughout the country is working
with redoubled energy for the last
billion on the last day. Reports from
every section are rolling up tremen
dous totals at the treasury. At 9
o'clock tonight the estimated subscrip
tions of tle nation stood at $3,635,000,-
00. pdmlttedly a conservative figure,
with Indications faat tile $4,000,000,000
might be recorded by ;omorrow morn
ing's totals.
Dallas District Short
Except for Dallas and San Francis
co, all districts had passed their mini
mum allotments and it seemed cer
tain, the treasury department an
nounced, that several districts would
go well beyond their maximum.
"New York is almost certain to do
so," the announcement said, "Boston,
Cleveland and Philadelphia probably
will and there is hope for several oth
ers. Some of them must, if the
f S.OfO.OCO P00 mark is to be attained
for a few districts. Including Dallas,
Atlanta and Kansas City, probably
cannot reach their high quotas, though
they are working relentlessly."
New York, Philadelphia, Boston and
Cleveland districts, by touching their
maximum quotas, would add $615,000.
000 to the total as it stands tonight,
bringing the grand total up to $4,250,
000,000. Official Figures.

$3,635,000,000 has been subscribed. At
best these are only estimates and are
thought to be conservative.

TO EXPECT HEAVY
Retiring Head of British Air
Service Says That United
States Must Expect to Lose
Men in Air Training.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, Oct. 2. iMajor General
David Henderson, who is retiring as
head of the British air board to un
dertake an important special duty, in
an interview today with the Associated
Press praised the American airplane3.
but warned against the danger of over
doing standardization in aircraft. He
believed the American public had been
prepared for fairly severe loss in air
training.
In connection with the American
air program Sir David's only anxiety
Is that the American plans for the
future shall not be permitted to hin
der the present work of the British
air service, which is depending to a
considerable ertent on the materials
and training machines ordered in the
United States.
Germans Anxious.
"I shall not say much to you about
plans of the British air service for
the immediate future," Sir David said.
"The Germans are acutely alarmed
over the preparations that the entente
are making for the air war next year.
They are under no Illusion about it
and they are bending every effort to
counter it by a stupendous program
of their own side. But we have had
the upper hand of them in the air
from the very beginning and feel sure,
especially with the help of the United
States, that our mastery will grow
stronger."
Asked whether it was true that the
British casualty in air training had
increased considerably in recent
months. Sir David said:
"The total number of our training
casualties increased heavily, but that
was mainly because so many more
men were training. The actual per
centage of casualties in training in
creased slightly in face of the fact
that your training has grown so much
more comprehensive.
Looping the Loop.
"Looping the loop has come to be
almost a kindergarten exercises in air;
training and the man training to be
figbtfng piiot must practice the side-
slip, the tail-slide, the nose-dive and
other aeronautical performances of a
most complicated character until he is
able to do almost anything with his
machine.
"Your casualties In the United
States are likely to be fairly severe
because you have no skilled Instruc
tors in sufficient numbers.
Experience Needed.
"Actual Field Experience is the
most valuable training for the air
man," Sir David concluded. "No
bravery or native skill can compen
sate for a lack of experience and
training in actual war. The best air
men in the British army, speaking
generally, are those who have been
at it the longest. For instance, one
of our squadrons contains 18 men who
have downed 200 enemy machines in
six months and won a victory over
that superb airman, the late Lieuten-
i ant Vosse. The leaders of that squad
ron are men who have had long ex
perience at the game. They are just
as daring as anybody, but they have
learned by that very experience how
best to protect themselves while in
flicting the greatest damage on the
enemy."

Reports That Retailers and
Wholesalers Are Getting
More Than a Legitimate
Profit Will Be Investigated.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26. A geneial
investigation into retail and whole
sale prices of coal througoout die
country appeared probable Ouay. In
a minor way, investigation of prices
consumers assert they iiave been com
pelled to pay already has been started
by the department of justice in var
ious sections of the east and iniUclle
wes:. both as to anthracite and bitum
inous coal.
Instructions have been sent to U. S.
attorneys conducting those local in
vestigations to summon witnesses to
determine the truth of the chaiges, and
where jus;ified, to bring promptly pro
ceedings under the criminal law
against those believed to be guilty, j
'Profit Exceeded. !
These instructions were based upon
complaints that the margin of profit al
lowed by the government had been ex
ceeded. Measured by the great vol
ume of complaints which have been re
ceived by the fuel administration. The
instances under investigation by the
department of justice are comparative
ly inconsequential.
Disposition of complaints is one of
the subjects which now is pressing
ihe fuel administration it is under
stood and aciion concerning them
pi'jbably will be taken within a few
days. Indications are that the bulk
of complaints upca which criminal pro
ceedings might be brought if truth of
the charges cau'be established will
be turned over to the department of
justice with the suggestion that vio
lators of the law be prosecuted prompt
ly. Heavy Penalties Provided.
Heavy penalties are provided for ViO
Iatiun of the law under which Jie pres
ident fixed the price to be charged for
coal and the margins allowed jubbers
and dealers.
"Whoever," reads the law, "shall
with Irnu'ttv that f h nrirps nf anv i

such commodity have been fixed as'
herein provided ask. demand or re
ceive a higher price, or whoever shall,
with knowledge that the regulations
have been prescribed as herein provid

of the same, shall, upon conviction be
punched by fine of not more than $5,
000 or by imprisonment for not more
than t'j years or both.
"Each independent transaction shall
constitute a seperate offense." .
Coupled with the complaints charg
ing that higher prices than those au
thorized bave been demanded and ob
tained, are numerous protests from
persons and firms alleging that 'they
have been unable to buy coal at any
price. With these, it is thought the
government has little power to deal,
except in cases where the coal opera
tors themselves refused to sell coal
which had not been contracted for
previously.
Most of the latter complaints, it is
understood, c'jme from purchasers for
household consumption.
REVISION OF COAL
PRICES UP TO WILSON
WASHINGTON, Oct. 26. Recom
mendations as to revision of coal
prices at the mines, upon the prospect
of which the agreement for wage In
creases was reached here recently be
tween operators and miners of the cen
tral competitive field were submitted
to President Wilson today by Fuel Ad
ministrator Garfield. They were not
made public and Dr. Garfield declined
to discuss them pending the presi
dent's consideration.
The fuel administrator has made a
careful survey of Conditions at tlu
mines in the various districts of the
country, but what increased prices, if
any, have been recommended is not
known.
Wages paid miners in other fields,
are based on those given in the Cen
tral field of Ohio. Illinois, Indiana, and
Tennasylvania and it is generally as
sumed that if increases are made in
that field so as to absorb wage raises,
the price in the other fields would be
similarly changed where living condi
tions warranted higher salaries to
miners.
After the wage Increases for the cen
tral field had been agreed upon miners
in many parts of that field struck in an
effort, it was charged, to force an im
mediate revision of coal prices. Dr.
Garfield warned them that the question !

BRITISH FRONT IN BELGUM, Oct.
26. (By the Associated Press.) Field
Marshal Haig's forces this morning
made two separate attacks on the Ger-
man position north and east of Ynres,
The first was from a point near Saint
Janshoek westward through the south
ern fringe jf the Hcutholst ridge to
the region of Nieuwemolen. The oJi
er assault wa: on both sides of the
Ypres-Menin highway along the Ghelu

French who also attacked on the lef

southeast of Gheluvelt which constitut

probably due to the heavy and effec

them by the British artillery last night
Many explosions were seen in the vi
cinity of these enemy batteries in the
darkness.
The aUack began in a cold rain that
had been falling several hours. It
has become almost trite to say that the
greatest barrage yet seen was em
ployed but once more this was the
case. The depth of the barrage fire
was considerably increased and the
British troops went forward behind a
terrific hail of t-hells. The prelimi
nary bombardment for these attacks
has been proceeding for days with the
greatest intensity and the expenditure
of ammunition was enormous.
Ridge Shell Torn.
The face of Passachendaele ridge
and other regions have been so alter

Last night the concentrated fire was
increased and the heavens were filled
with a crimson glow as the guns hurl

Wind Dries Mud.
The excellent bombardment was the
result of remarkable work in moving
the guns forward over the marsh-like
terrain. The brisk wind of the last

Tucson High Wins
From Bisbee By a
Very Close Score
(Special to Review.)
TUCSON, Ariz., Oct. 26. In the
most spectacular game seen here this
season Tucson High sch'ool defeated
T;sbee Hi this afternoon on Universi
ty field by the score of 3 to 0. It was
Bi.sbee's first defeat of the season and
Tucson's first vicory. The score came
in the second quarter when Codd ex
ecuted a beautiful kick back fi'Jm
Tucson's 43 yard line.
In the third quarter Tucson came
near scoring again when Harrison in
tercepted a Bisbee thoe string pass
and carried the ball to Bisbee's one
yard line but the visitor's line became
adamant. Tucson lost the bail on
downs and Bisbee kicked the ball out
of danger. Bisbee appeared well on
the way to scoring in the last quarter
when it carried the ball tfjwn the field
from it's own ten yard line to within
ten yards of Tucson's line. It was a
fight against time and the whistle rob
bed them of further chances of scoring.

THANKS ADMINISTRATORS. j
WASHINGTON', Oct. 26. President
Wilson in a letter to Fuel Administra

;o the national cause. The letter read
by Dr. Garfield at a conference of
state administrators appointed since
October 2 foli'ows: ,
"May I be permitted to express to
the federal tuel administrators for the
respective sta.es, many of whom I un
derstand are in Washington for con
ference today, my appreciation of their
generous action in contributing their
services t'J the furtherance of this im
portant and vital work? It constitutes
another instance of the unselfish de
votion by some of the country's ablest
men of their time and thought to the
solution of the difficult problems
bt'Jught on by the war in which our
whole force as a nation is now engag
ed. "Please convey to those assembled,
my earnest good wishes for the com
plete success of their efforts in this
great undertaking."
The administrators meeting here to
night heard addresses by Dr. Garfield
and other fuel administrators and Con
sidered emergency supplies, car sup

This made my work very hard. I used

they were just what I needed. They
entirely cured the back trouble and I

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

Saturday Morning, October 27, 1917.
Be not afraid of enthusiasm; you need it; you
can do nothing effectually without it. Guizot.
And Still He's Optimistic
Henry Clews, that brave old New York banker, who
always sees the brighter side, is hard pressed for it these
stirring days to be gay over the present financial situa
tion. But in his last summary of the business and war
conditions of the country he fearlessly and confidently
looks the matter in the face and expresses himself as
follows:
The influence of the war upon finance and industry
becomes more Intense each day. A the moment it over
shadows every other factor, and the country is completely
absorbed in bending every energy to the preservation
of democracy. In keeping with this spirit the financial
community is strenuously pushing the Liberty Loan,
which promises to be a complete success; the applica
tions having already approached nearly $4,000,000,000. In
all probability the loan will be well over-subscribed. This
is highly encouraging.
As we hare already stated, these bonds as an invest
ment are the safest and best in the world. Within a few
years, if not sooner, they will sell at a handsome pre
mium, and it is an imperative duty for every citizen to
assume his share of the financial responsibility in con
ducting the war by subscribing in proportion to his
ability.
The effect of these vast operations upon the country's
finances is being gradually discounted. A diversion of
$3,000,000,000 of savings from productive to destructive
purposes within a few months naturally requires exten
sive financial readjustment. It has been recently esti
mated by competent authorities that the war is now cost
ing the nations involved about $160,000,000 a day. in
cluding $40,000,000 for the United States; and that by
next August, if the war lasts until then, the costs to all
belligerents will exceed $150,000,000,000.
Such terrific wastage of course means heavy liquida
tion the world over. As long as we kept out of the war,
we felt such liquidation less; now that we are in the
struggle to the limit, we are assuming our share of the
cost, which we had before escaped. Fortunately, with
our unequaled economic and financial resources properly
mobilized, we can meet the strain with full assurance of
stability and victory. Liquidation has already cut deep
into values, and many securities are today selling far
below intrinsic values.
Recent low prices must also be partly attributed to
scarcity of and advancing rates for capital. It is evident
that we are working toward permanently higher interest
rates; and security values, especially those wkh fixed
returns, have been adjusting themselves to the new basis.
Thoughtful military experts have grave fears for the
Italians at this time. The Austro-German offensive on
the Isonzo and Carso fronts threatens General Cardoua
with a terrible menace. For the first time he and his
troops face the German war machine. It will be remem
bered that the Serbs had no trouble fn beating Austrians,
nor did the Russians and Roumanians. But when Ger
man divisions and artillery and officers and aircraft came
' and bolstered up the shattered Austrian armies, the
Serbs and Roumanians were driven from their lands and
the Russians were beaten lgnominiously. Only the
French and the English have been able to withstand the
Hun, and now they not only withstand bim, but they
have the regular habit oi beating him. Can the Italian
stand the test? It is the acid test for General Cardona's
troops. If they ran hold their own against this present
offensive they will hav- done well. If they can driv
hack the forward moving Huns and Austrians they will
have proved themselves heroes and may well be depended
upon to play a hero's part in the great spring offensive.
Heating the Austrians seems to e about the easiest
thing developed by the present war. But give theui a
few German divisions and they overrun all enemies on
the eastern front. The present offensive on the Italian
front will tell the allies just to what extent they can
depend upon Italy in the future. The Isonzo battle will
have much to do with determining the length of the war.
The Hun simply HAD to come to the aid of his ally;
Italy bad him down and was pounding the life out of
him. And so, in the face of a beating at the hands of
the English in Flanders, and a disaster at the hands of
the French on the Aisne, he has hurried to the aid of
Austria. If he fails of a victory here, sad is his plight.
It is up to the soldiers and the engineers and the
cooks and the transportation service and the executive
departments now, the people have done their part. The
second Liberty Loan is an assured success, for it has
passed the three and one-half billion mark set for it and
will come up close to if not abreast of the five biUion
mark hoped for. The people can always be depended
t'pon. The main causes cf worry are in the transporta
tion, the ship building and airplane departments. Are
the men at the head of the war and navy and ordnance
departments big enough for the tremendous jobs ahead
of them? Let us hope so. A big man might well fail on
any one of these problems. Only an extraordinary man
can cope with them. We must move millions of tons of
munitions, food and equipment to our seaboards and
then move them to France and England. Only an emi
nently organized system can do it. Fair progress is
reported on these great tasks. We have the money, wp
have the genius for organization and we have the spirit
to see the thing through; there remains only the actual
and skillful and energetic and unselfish consummation.
One thing sure, those in authority cannot lay the blame
lor any failure at the people's door. They have dope
their part. They have dug down deep and carried the
great loan through when it sagged and slipped and was
all but bogged down. Action, swift, sure, skilled and re
lentless, is what the people demand now from their
stewards to whom they have entrusted the direction of
the war.
Cochise county's quota of the Liberty Loan was about
a million and a quarter. We have already more than
doubled it, and may well reach the three million mark.
If any county In the U. S. A. can beat this record, let
them speak now or forever hold their peace.. It is true
that the three big mining companies of the county gave
more than a million, but the average, ordinary plug citi
zens of the county alone raised the quota of a million
and a quarter. The generosity and public spirit of the
C. and A., the Copper Queen and the Shattuck companies
went to make the overflowing measure of the patriotism
of Cochise. With us it is not a case of SOME classes
being generous and others holding back. ALL classes
here, workers, mine operators and business men. worked
shoulder to shoulder for the loan, and tried, not merely
to pass the amount required, but to pass the amount
hoped for. Their success is a real honest-to-goodness
cause for congratulation, gladness and pride.
"It is worthy of special mention," declares a famous
eastern financier, 'that a very remarkable change has
taken place in the attitude of the government toward bis
business since the war began. Previously our leading
business men were often persona non grata at Washing
ton, prejudice having run so deep that men of unques
tioned character were frequently regarded as criminals,
simply because they had been successful. All this has
changed. The big business men of the United States In
vaded Washington in force to help the government, with
out pay and at heavy sacrifices to themselves. Such a
remarkable display of patriotism by the leading men in
industry and trade has never been seen before in any
country, and the result is there was never a better un
derstanding between government and business than ex
ists in the United States today. Let us hope that these
better relations will extend to the national legislature
also, where prejudice has proved most injurious."
Herbert Hoover has broken loose again. This man
can conjure with the food question. He is the best pub
licity agent that pork and beans and bread ever knew.
He scares you most to death every time he makes a state
ment He has been given about all the powers that a ten
ton truck could carry, and yet and yet the prices of food
remain the same, or climb a little bit higher. The day
of their descent is put off from time to time by this mcvt
plausible man. Maybe he cannot lower them, nor run
any other man or set of men. But he promised. There
fore we grumble. This column was, and is still for
Hoover. It wanted him given the power the president
asked for him. Therefore it reserves the righ to gruinbK
If we cannot fuss at our friends, at whom then, pray,
can we fuss? We want the boy to page Hoover, and
when he finds him, make him set a specific date for the
decline of the inflated prices of beans, butter and bacon.
In its last bulletin the Arizona State Board of Health
lay especial stress upon the general prevalenry of colds
and the importance of paying close attention to them
and trying to cure them at once. Fresh air is the great
curative for colds, according to a long article in the
last bulletin. If a cold is stubborn, consult a doctoi.
Under no circumstances let a bad cold go on under the
foolish assumption that it will cure itself. Colds reduce,
the resistance of the human system to other and more
serious forms of disease. Whisky Is not, as popularly
supposed, good for a cold. A hot foot bath, hot lemonade
and quinine are worth more than all the whisky ever
distilled in curing a cold.
COCHISE COUNTY GIRL
APPOINTED ASSISTANT
PUBUCJEFENDER
Daughter of Mary Costello
Will Fill Prominent Position
in Los Angeles Courts. Bora
in Tombstone.
Los Angeles papers arriving here
this week contained the news that Miss
Evelyn J. Costello, daughter of Mrs.
Mary Costello, who is at present vis
iting in Tombstone, was recently ap
pointed assistant public defender. Bis
bee friends of Miss Costello will be
pleased to hear of her attainments,
since she is a Tombstone product born
and reared in Cochise county. Fol
lowing is what the Los Angeles Herald
had to say regarding the appointment
which was fea:ured by a large picture
of Miss Costello:
"Los Angeles has its first woman of
ficially appointed as assistant police
court defender.
"She is Evelyn J. Costello, a gradu
ate of the U. S. C. law college and to
day she began her work in the wo
man's court as assistant to Public De
fender Jim Pope.
"Miss Costello is the first woman in
Los Angeles tj be officially placed in
such a position. She is but 22 years
of age, but despite her youth, has a
keen knowledge of law.
"When Mrs. Nellie M. Pierce enter
ed the morals efficiency commission,
her place at the woman's court was
left vacant and it was decided to create
an official posi .ion that the women ac
cused of wrongdoing might be sure
of help and understanding from a wo
man. "I don't know all about my work as
yet and am unprepared to state what I
shall do," said Miss Costello in dis
cussing the new position. "However, I
have always been interested in the
case of the woman ' who has g'jne
wrong and am sure that she can be
helped. I am grea:ly interested in
my work and hope to help in bettering
the situation in Los Angeles.'
"Miss Costello is a Los Angeles girl
and has received her education here.
She was graduated from the U. S. C.
law college in 1916, and has been a
practicing attorney since then."

Circus Superintendent Says
That Local Officer Is the
Man Who Put the Skids
Under the I. W. W.'s.
A sure sign that the Hun contemplates retirement
on the west front he is sawing down trees' and destroy
ing towns and laying waste Hie country side.
"Sheriff Wheeler of your county is
the man that put the i. W. W..out of
business," declared Charlie Cook, su
perintendent of the Al. G. Barnes
show, yesterday morning as he talked
be: ween intervals of overseeing the
raising of the big top. "We were
back in the east then, but we read
the story of your- drive, and people
did not talk of anything else for days.
"You ciin bet we talked about it,
for the I. W. W. nearly wrecked our
canvas crew with the strike stuff. We
haen't recovered yet, because the
draft came along and took some more,
and we are short-handed in spite of
all we can do to get men."
Charlie Cook lies buen with Barnes
for 10 years. He was in liisbee last
year and many years a;o. The growth
f Warren amazed him. "The town
has more than doubled in size in a
year, he declared, looking a round
him at the rows of houses.
Cook is a fine type of showman;
clea-cut. soft-spoken, with a pleasant
smile and friendly greeting, but he has
bis men under period discipline all
be time. S;ine of tliem hae been
with him for eight years. The fora
men do the cussing for the big opera
tion that goes with establishing the

calls out a f:w words lo tell them

do it.

Clowns Poor. BRING RESULTS.
The clowns, .ro, were pitiful in - -
their efforts to amuse. They detract
ed far more than they added to the
show. Their "stuff" was old, and it
didn't "get over" very effectively, even
.vith the youngsters.
But .his criticism is superfluous. The
circus advertised its wild animals
not its glitter, its splendor, or its star
performers. And what animals they
had! Magnificent looking beasts of
the juiiKl". high spirited, nioved rapidly
through u never tiling piVigram. They
fascina cd old and oiuig alike.
The "Feature."
There was one feature with rather a
general appeal. It was "the prima
donna of the white top" a sweet voic
ed woman who rode a beautiful white
horse about the circuit of the tent.
