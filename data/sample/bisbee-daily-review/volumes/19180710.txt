WASHINGTON. July 9 Entente
governments, through their embassies
in Washington are fully advised of
the views of the Washington admin
istration as to the best means of car
rying out President Wilson's pledg?
to "stand behind Russia."
I It is understood that a project is
taking shape which It is hoped will
. counteract German influence and lead
the people to rehabilitate themselves
without exciting distrust of the unself
ish motives which lie behind it.
There is reason to believe the pro
posal to send American business men
to Russia forms the basis of the nego
tiations between Washington and the
entente capitals. Only it has assumed
a new phase through the injection of
the idea to make the commission and
armed guards international in compo
sition, thus tending to disarm any
suspicion on the part of the Russians
that their country is to be exploited
in the interests of a single power.
MILLION MEN NEEDED
, LONDON. Julv 10 "With a million
men. of whom 300.000 only need be
allied troops, it would be possible to
reconstruct the eastern front on a line
running through the Ural mountains."
is a statement made by Lieut. General
Horvsth, vW nreIdeut 8 1 g?neral
manager of the Chinese eastern rail
wav. according to a dispatch to the
Mail from Harbin under date of June
29.
"Intervention is unavoidable," he
said. "The actions of the German and
Austrian prisoners are undoubtedly a
part cf the German scheme to possess
the whole of Russia. They are acting
in collusion with the bolsheviki, one
tenth of whom are fools and the rest
knaves.
"Japan must supply the bulk of the
troops. The other allies must supply
money."
TOKIO. Thursday, July 4 (By the
Asscciated Tress). Colonel Vladimir
Hurban, a member of the national
Czechoslovak council, has arrived in
Tokio from Vladivostok. He will
leave short'y for the United States to
discuss the Siberian situation with the
Washington government.
Colonel Hurban told the correspond
ent that the action taken by the
Czecho slovaks in assuming control at
Vladivostok was the inevitable result
of unjustified attacks of the Bolshe
vik and the deliberate attempts of the
latter to and the Austro-German pris
oner forces in nreventine the Czecho
slovaks from moving toward Vladi
vostok.

LONDON, July 9. Prominent Rus
sian residents in London consider the
Czetho-Slovsk movement in Siberia as
the only reliable basis for a struggle
against Polshevikism.
The recent Moscow rising is con
sidered here to have been a quarrel
between the bolsheviki and their late

Two Passenger Trains Collide

Nashville; Only Few White
People Among Those Killed
(By Review I,ear! Wirf)
NASHVILLE, Tenn.. July 10.
At an early hour this morning the
total number cf identified and un
identified dead from yesterday's
collision on the Nashville Chatta
nooga and St. Louis railroad near
here reached 125. The injured
number is seventy-three, many of
them serious. .
NASHVILLE, Tenn.. July 9 At
least loo persons, most of thenl ne
groes, were killed and as many more
injured in a head-on collision today
between two passenger trains on the
Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis
railway at Dutchman's Bend, five
miles from' this city. -.
Most of the killed and injured-were
on a local train from Nashville which
carried several coaches full of work
men, going to a nearby powder plant.
The other train was an express from
Memphis and the west and after the
two engines had reared and fallen be
side the track, the bea.-y coaches of
the express ploughed through the bag
gage car on 'the accommodation train
and demolished the other coaches.
As, the crews of boti locomotives
were" killed the cause of the collision
may never be established. The ex
press; train was running late and one
theory advanced was that the engi
neer of the accommodation train may
have disregarded signals and tried to
make a switch just beyond where the
wreck occurred before the Memphis
train arrived. There also was the pos
sibility that he may have been given
wrons instructions.
Three investigations of the wreck
were expected, one by officials of the
road, another by state officials and a
'third ty the railroad administration.
Onlv a few women were among the
killed' Most of the white persons killed
were in the telescoped smoking car o"
the accommodation train. Among the
kil'ed were:
Priv. John P. Hussey, Uhlian. III.;
T.sqn B. Harris of the naval re

BOTTLING WORKS
An important business deal " was
consumated yesterday when it was an
naunced by Stuart A. Griggs, manager,
cf Die Celery Vig Bottling company,
that his concern had purchased the
bottling plant of Theodore F. Metz, a
pioneer in the Warren district, and
hereafter would conduct the affairs of
the concern.
In outlining the policy of the newv
acquired interest, Mr. Griggs said that
the manufacture and sale of Celery
Vig would be pushed harder than ever,
for several reasons. In the first place
the drink is becoming mere popular
every day; secondly the recent govern
mental ruling eliminating 50 per cent
cf the sugar used by manufacturers
from their future business, makes Col
crv Vig the logical drink lor fie com
pany to center upon as it. requires no
sugar. Honey and other naturally
sweet ingredients are admirable sub
stitutes.
.It. is not the intention cf the com
pany to neglect the 'manufacture and
sale of scda water, but Mr. Grij;,TS in
augurated his control cf the hxal situ
ation by announcing higher pr.:ces,
which he considered Justitied by con

PARIS. Julv 9. The German em
peror has accepted the resignation of
Dr. Richard Vou Kuehlmann, the Ger

a Basel dispatch to the Havas agency.
It is expected that Admiral Von Iiintze.

Dr. Jlichard Von Kuehlmann became

whose retirement closely followed the
exposure of his plot to involve tne
United States in war with Mexico and
Japan in yie event that this country
showed any inclination to join the en

conduct of the foreign office appeared
to Ibc more than usually sluccessful
until June 25 last, when he appeared
before the reichstag to discuss the
political aspects of the situation fac

said: -
"In view of the magnitude of this
war and the number of powers, incTud
ing those from overseas that are en
gaged, its end can hardly be expected
through military decision alone and
wiqicut recourse to diplomatic nego

had relerred to peace being won by
"the strong German sword was re

Dr. Von Kuehlmann's words had been
approved by General Ludondoerf, the
German commander on the western
front.
This brought to notice rumors of
friction between Ludendorff and the
German crown prince and his coterie
who comprise the radical pan-Germanic
elements in official circles.
" Soca after the address in the reich
stnr, it became common knowledge
that Dr. Von Kuehlmann's retirement
from office would be forthcoming.
Some reports were to the effect that

NEW YORK. July 9. Railroad
stocks were spurred into momentary
activity and strength, at tue opening
cf today's session on reports that Di
rector General McAdoo would soon an
nounce a form of contract satisfactory
to holders of such securities. These
reports proving premature, the mark
et soon relapsed.
Advices from abroad were apain of
unfavorable tenor, but the government
crop report, issued in the final hour,
confirmed fears of frost damane.
Spring and winter wheat especially
lost ground.
United States Steel was less con
spicuous than usual, cancelling the
greater part, of its large fractional ad
vonce in the moderate reaction at
the close.
There were conflicting movements
in other steels and equipments, mot
ors, oils and war specialties, while
shippings, coppers and tobaccos dis
played little activity.
Distillers was under pressure as a
result of the proposed "bone dry" leg
islation, losing an extreme of 3i
points. Utilities were utterly neglec
ted. Total sales 265,000 shares. All
call loans were made at 6 per cent
and time money offerings were limit
ed to renewals for sixty and ninety
days at the same rate.
Liberty issues, which were a trifle
easier, made up the bulk of the deal
ings, other issues holding steady to
firm. Total sales , par value, $5,225,
000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.
GRAIN
CHICAGO, July 9. Uncertainty
over what the government crop would
show, tended today to restrict business
in corn and to bring about an advance
after an early decline. Prices closed
unsettled at the same as yesterday's
finish to 114 cents higher, with Aug
ust $1.5514 to $1.55 and September
$1.55 to $1.56. Oats gained 'i cent
to 1 cents. In provisions, the out
come was unchanged to 20 cents up.
Hearish views prevailed in regard to
the government figures among corn
traders at the outset. Few dealers an
ticipated that the official estimate
would exceed, 3.150,000.0(1) bushels,
whereas the official forecast proved
to be 10,000,000 higher, a new top rec
ord. Some uneasiness over the effects
of dry weather northwest, counted
also against the bears.
Guesses regarding the Washington
estimate of the cats yield were too
large by about 13,000,000 bushels. This
fact was not known, however, until
after the close. Meanwhile the market
paralleled the action of corn.
Lower quotations on hogs weakened
provisions, but the losses were more
than oversome later as a result of
grain strength. 1

The time trotted and paced with the

The 2:12 pace caused the biggest up

Margrave had taken the first heat she
was forced to succumb in the second

THE I. W. W. ON TRIAL
(From the Chicago Tribune.)
A number of intellectual radicals and
liberals Robert V. Bruere, John Dewey,
Thorstein Veblen, etc. have appealed to
the people for contributions to the I. W.
W. defense fund. The leaders are on trial
in Chicago before Judge Landis. The ap
peal for funds insists that true American
ism will provide a fair trial for these men.
"Never Mind What You Think About
the I. W. V.," the appeal says; "they are
at least entitled to a fair trial and an open
minded public hearing. That is a primary
American right."
The fear that a fair trial will not be had
is not well explained. There is no public
excitement against the defendants. There
is no popular prejudice here. There might
be in the farther west. Here people regard
the organization as an amusing menagerie.
Journalism treats it in the spirit of elabor
ate josh not the best method of treatment,
but the prevailing one.
If we had the packers on trial there would
be much more popular animus. This lack
of interest i3 unintelligent and unwise be
cause it is not only indifference to the
methods of social revolutionaries but it is
indifference to conditions which give vigor'
to the revolutionaries. But it represents a
state of mind not inimical to the fair trial
of the leaders of the organization.
The intellectuals who ask for a defense
fund are not candid. Their virtual conces
sion that the criminal aspects of the case
will be treated effectually -leaves their
movement as "one to expose "intolerable
conditions of labor." For such exposure
witnesses must be brought from distant
places and money is needed.
Americans would be interested in giving
these I. W. V. leaders a fair trial and an
unprejudiced hearing of the charges against
them. These are charges which affect their
liberty and their right of action. If they are
not guilty of crimes they should not be pun
ished for them. Fair play, to which the
appeal is made, is concerned entirely with
the individual responsibility of these men
to the law as society has made the law.
These social revolutionists frequently
assert their independence of the law, their
contempt for the social order, their desire
and purpose to change it by violence and
force and to impose upon a majority, slug
gish or sane, stupid or intelligent, Inert or
determined, a new social system whether
the majority, for whatever reason. want3
it or not.
Such procedure virtually outlaws the
revolutionaries because they will accept
none of the processes of reform, modifica
tion, or amelioration which are provided by
the prevailing scheme of society. Liberal
ism in that scheme means constant amelior
ation whhout destruction. The revolution
aries frequently urge destruction as the
necessary preliminary to reform.
We cannot see how an appeal in honest
and candid spirit can be made to people who
believe the I. W. W. to be fundamentally
wrong to assist in devoting their general
case against society. It is not a case of
these big men being in danger because of
unfairneness. It i3 a case of their propa
ganda not getting its most elaborate expo
sition. Inasmuch as society considers it
self on the defensive against the propa
ganda it may be excused from furthering
the work against itself.
A criminal case is not the occasion for a
survey of intolerable conditions of life. The
scheme of society is working and it ou?ht
to work fairly as we think it is to de
termine whether the specific crimes charged
against there men were committed by them.
The provocation found in conditions of
life, against which liberalism constantly
contends and for which it constantly seeks
amelioration, is not defense of destructive
methods. The methods may be more in
jurious to the stability and general equity of
a just social scheme than the intolerable
conditions themselves.
The I. W. W. leaders are not in a pre
carious condition due to popular or political
antagonism. Their propaganda does not
recommend itself to other than destructive
revolutionists and illusioned intellectuals.
Intelligence must find a better way of sur
veying and remedying vicious conditions of
life and labor and the appeal for funds in
this case is covert, not candid.
It is stated that the United States has de
cided upon a policy of action in regard to
Russia. Let us hope so. And let us hope
also that it is a vigorous one. The German
kaiser long ago decided upon his policy of
action in regard to Russia, and he who runs
may read it on the wall of the times. Closer
and closer draws the steel web of German
power upon the Slav. Already announce
ment has been made that the Germans
would police Moscow , and Petrograd be
cause of the killing'-of the German am
bassador by an anarchist. This is a pre
text for further assumption of power over
the very heart of Russia. Lenine and Trot
sky still are in the saddle and they are do
ing everything humanly possible to aid and
speed up the machinery of complete Ger
man domination. It is not this year that
the seizure of Russia by the Germans will
affect the allied cause so much, but next
year, and in the years to come. If Germany
is allowed to sieze all of Russia without re
sistence, and can hold out two years longer,
she will, aided by Russian wheat and can'
non fodder, be enabled to hold out for ten,
unless the allies succeed in making a mighty
and costly smash in the west, or her own
leaders and organization goes to pieces un
der the strain. The occupation of Russia
by the Germans is the greatest menace that
faces the allied cause this day.
It is inconceivable why the German gov
ernment should spend more than a million
dollars to buy a controlling interest in a
grea American daily like the New York
Mail and Express. Such a paper could do
the kaiser no particle of good, for the day
that its tone and policy became pro-German,
that day its influence would fade and
its right to the mails and the streets be de
nied by the government and its printed say
ings rejected by the people of this coun
try. German high officials, with all their
genius for organization and their thorough
methods and their intense study and appli
cation, have become so swollen, witlv pride
as to be blind to the psychology of other
peoples. The German superman walks
with his head so high in the. air that he
falls into the pit He misjudged England
and America sadly and now he faces these
great nations in a finish fight that he can
not win. These two mistakes in judgment
outweigh by far all his successes- ad ac
complishments. '
It has been a month since the ls
man blow, and still the kaiser's war ma
chine is motionless behind intrenched V,rs
while the allies strike by raid or local at
tack nearly every day. A month is more
than enough time to refit and restore a
punished army. Every hour of delsy ads
to the allied strength, while it Ivri"? n tK

and also most foplish military strateev.
one doubts that the Germans will soon
strike with greater force than ever before,
and no one doubts now but that the allies
will hold them better than in any of the
first three great drives. Foch i3 stronger
than he was on March 2 1 ; Ludendoerf is
weaker.
Geo. D. Herron: "Indeed, the last thing
America row warts is peace wi'h C -'
nvny; let there be no mistake about that.
America will have no peace until she has
so thoroughly whipped the Germans that
they cease being German. Yes, when Ger
many ceases to be German ; when the fron
tiers of civilization are extended eastward
beyond the Rhine and the spirit of broth
erhood flows westward from Moscow and
Warsaw; when Germany becorrsej some
thing else than the well-spring of the sav
agery that has, for these twentv centuries,
again and again overflowed and devastated
Europe, each time undoing the progress of
generations; indeed, when the Prussian
psuedo-State ceases to exist then, and not
till then, will America believe that human
ity and democracy are safe or consider that
foundations for permanent peace and true
progress can be laid."

What reasons and considerations In
fluenced them and the larger body of
representative Ameireans to whom
they reported to call for such a larse
sum? They are the very facts and
considerations which will lead the peo
ple of our country, both rich and poor,
regardless of section or purty, to as
sociate their wealth and poverty, in
providing the amount needed. Why
then is the $100,000,0no and more re
quired? Because the number of men
culled to the colors In the American
army has enormously increased since
the campaign of last November and
will continue to increase. General
Crcwder insists that before the com
ing winter is over we should have in
the army fully 3,ni0,000 men. Presi
dfnt Wilson wisely questions whether
we shall let our minds stop even at
5,000.t)(j0 should our great cause re

association must enlarge its plans. to
keep pace with the streams of men
pouring into camps and cantonments
whatever the numbers prove to be.
Because the American navy mjU re

000 and is advancing by leaps and
bounds. Whereas when . we entered
the war we had less than 200 ships
in commission, by the end or thi3 year
there will be nearly 2000. On our
navy depends getting our army over
seas and maintaining It. We speak
of the dangers of the soldiers In the
front line trenches and their need or
our minitry. We do well to remem
ber that all our sailors in European
waters are also in. front line trenches
and likewise need our help. Because
this war Is not a war of armies and
navies alone but of entire peoples, lie
conse the center of gravity, yes, the
center of the hea't interest of the
Ameircan cause and people has shifted
within the year to the other side of
the Altantic. Because the Young
Men's Christian association is expect
ed to accompany or stand by the
American soldiers from the time they
leave their home town until the end
of the war they return. Because of
the ministry of the association of the
men overseas is so comprehensive. It
Includes vastly more thaa we at home
associate in our thinking with the let

soldiers and sailors we have the re
sponsibility of representing the Ameri

college, the American library, the
American lect'jtre platform and all that
is best in the American stage, the best
features or American club life, the
American store, and above all, many
of the aspects or the American chur
ches. ' In a word, we seek to repro
duce all that is best In American life.
WThat a responsibility! What a trust! ,
That It may be truly performed means
the wise uee of man' millions of
money. Because military authorities
maintain that the most important fac
tor in the war is the morale or the
men and that such a practical minis

can we do more to help the French
army and navy because of the suc

Hon. R. W. Damon Feels It
Duty to Tell Public
His Experience
I Business men, professional men.
farmers, artisans in fact people in all
walks of life, including innumerable
women, are now taking Tanlac. and
are testifying daily to the preparations
remarkable merits. This incontrovert
ible evidence is further strengthened
by the statement or R. W. Damon, a
! well-known attorney-at-law, who re
I sides at 2712 Yakima street So'ith,
j Tacoma, Wash. Mr. Damon practiced
his profession in the state or Ohio for
I thirty-five years, and has many
staunch friends throughout the west.
In relating his experience with Tan
lac recently, Mr. Damon said:
"I feel it my duty to do whatever 1
can to help suffering humanity, and
I am more' than glad for the sake of
others, to give this statement about
my wonderful improvement since I be
gan the use of Tanlac. I had suffered
s great deal during the past two
years from indigestion and stomach
trouble in a very severe form. My
food would not digest properly, but
would lay in my stomach and ferment,
causing gas. bloating and much pain
about my heart. At times I was so af
fected my this gas that I could hardly
breathe, and had intense pains all
through my chest. Twice. 1 was in
such a bad way that I fell to the floor
in an unconscious condition, and the
second attack put me in such bad
shape that I had to be carried to the
hospital, where I lay for thirty days.
I would go for two or three nights In
succession with only two or three
hours sleep, and the following day I
would feel entirely worn out. I seem-
I ed to receive no benefit from my food.
was inclined to be constipated, and
felt unfit for anything. 1 I, of course,
doctored, and took medicines of differ
ent' kind3, but got very little, it any,
results.
"While reading the Tacoma paper
one day I came across a Tanlac testi
monial, given by a Denver lady, and
her case was exactly like mine. So
since that time I have been taking
Tanlac, and the results have far ex
ceeded my expectations. I have onli
been taking it for about ten days and
have already been almost entirely re
lieved of the gas and bloating. My ap
petite Is so enormous, and everything
tastes so good that I have to guard
myself to keep from eating more than
I should. I have gained eleven pounds
in weight already, and am still picking i
up. I Bleep soundly every night and
get up in the mornings rested and re
freshed. So it is. Tanlac has proven
to be Just the right thing In my case
and I gladly give others the benefit
of my experience with it."
