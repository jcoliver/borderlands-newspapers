EFI1ITELY
Spotlight of Publicity Again
Turned on Teutonic Ma
chinations. Ambassador
Wanted Money to Use
Here.
tBy Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept 21. The
American government's publicity spot
light revealing German intrigue in
neutral lands turned today upon the
expenditure of money by the Berlin
foreign office in an effort to influence
congress on the eve of the ruthless
submarine campaign which drove me
United States to war.
Asks for $50,000
Secretary Lansing made public with
out comment the text of a message
sent b yCount von Bernstorff to Ber
lin last January, asking authority to
use $50,000 to influence congress
through an organization which the for
eign office was reminded had per
formed similar service before. To sup
plement this move. Von Bernstorff
suggested an official declaration in fa
vor of Ireland for its effect here.
Organization Not Named
The organization to be employed
was not named in the message, and
Mr. Lansing did- not discuss its identi
ty. It was freely suggested among
otherhs, however, that it was one of
the various societies which flooded
members of the house and the senate
with peace messages when .President
Wilson was asking that a state of war
be recognized.
Von Bernstorff Connected
This disclosure adds another chap
ter to the amazing story begun with
publication of the famous Zimmer
man n note, in which Germany pro
posed an alliance with Mexico and
Japan against the United States, and
which has included the German-Swedish
breaches of neutrality In Argen
tine and Mexico. It connects the Ger
man government and Count von Bern
storff directly and conclusively with
machinations whish the American
public had assumed was a part of the
world-wide Teuton intrigue, but which
many people firmly firmly believea
were carried on or financed in this
country by eGrman-Americans without
actual authority from Berlin.
Little Surprise Evinced
Little surprise was occasioned either
in official circles or at the capitol,
although members of congress were
highly indignant There was some
talk at the capitol of demanding an
investigation, and Senator Overman,
chairman of the senate lobby commit
tee, and Representative Flood, chair
man of the house foreign affairs com
mittee, arranged to go to tne state
department tomorrow for further in
formation. Suggests Investigation
On the hoor of the house Represen
tative Heflin of Alabama asserted that
he could name thirteen or fourteen
members of the two branches of con
gress who had acted suspiciously, and
expressed the opinion that they should
be investigated. Generally, however.
the disposition was to regard as ab-j
surd any suggestion that any part of '
the $50,000 sought by Von Bernstorff!
was intended for members of con-1
gress.
The Message
"I request authority to pay out up
to $50,000 (fifty thousand dollars) in
order, as on former occasions, to in
fluence congress through the organiza
tion you know of, which can perhaps
prevent war.
"I am beginning in the meantime
to act accordingly.
"In the above circumstances a pub-
lie uiuciiti vjtri iiiBii ueumruLiuu in la
vor of Ireland is highly desirable. In
order to gain the support of Irish in
fluence here."
Teutonic Perfidy
This message was sent out nine
days before the German government
proclaimed its unrestricted submarine
warfare. When be wrote that. Count
von Bernstorff was assuring the Amer
ican government and press that under
no circumstances would Germany vlo
, late her pledges of the Sussex or do :
anything that might draw the United i
States into the list of her enemies. '
With the Lusitania and other cases in
abeyance, the American government
had made no move since the Sussex
pledge, and there was nothing on the

(By Review Leased Wire.
WASHINGTON Rpnt 21 The first
indication that the eovernment nlan

al evils caused by large floating pop

possibilities arising out of competi

that if shipbuilders agree not to bid
against rival companies for men, steps
will be taken to secure ismilar agree

Conferences On Coast.
Although Mr. Hurley has not decid
ed when or where he will call the first
conference, it is probable it will be on
the Pacific coast, where a Seattle ship

wage increase, has caused a movement

BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, Sept. 21 During the night
the British forces with comparatively
little opposition consolidated an con
sideratly improved the new line
which they had won in their offensive
against the Germans to the eash of
Ypres. -'
Australians Jubilant.
Today from the newly acquired
enemy stronghold known as "Anzac,"
southwest of Zonhebeke, flutters the
Australian banner", a symbol of the
greatest victory which has marked
their operations in the western the
ater in the past year, not excluding
that of Messines. - Southwest of Gre
luvelt the Germans still are holding
a position which the British desired
and today at 9:30 o'clock. Field Mar
shal Haig began a local attack here.
British Holding Oon.
This morning found the British still
holding strongly the important posi
tion which they had wrested from
the Germans. The consolidating pro
cess effected in the night was facili
tated by the British artillery, its ef
fective work preventing the Germans
from bringing up their reserves.
High Ground Won.
Th eimportance of the new ground
won lies in the fact that it was high
ground tr.king in the ridges, on which
the Anzac's flag now flies and ex
tending southward and constituting
the keystone o fthe German defenses
here. Over this the onrushing British
yesterday swept with irresistible
force.
Germans Active.
Aside from the local operation
southwest of Gheluvelt the situation
today south of Anzac stronghold was
virtually unchanged. The Germans
shelled the left of this front heavily
during the night and showed consider
able activity also immediately to the
north.
Northeast of St. Julien the Germans
formed last evening for a counter-attack
but the British turned a heavy
rifle and machine gun fir into the
enemy ranks and dispersed them with
heavy losses.
Fighting Very Bitter .
The fighting yesterday was very
bitter in many places. The enemy bat
tled, firmly determined .to hold their
positions and when once forced from
the lines they were defending, con
tinued to return to the attack in an
endeavor to oust the British.
During the day no jess than six
counter-attacks were delivered on the
front north of the Anzac, but in each
instance (he assaulting troops were
hurled back.
Throughout this time the British
continued to improve their line, reach
ing out here and there to occupy posi
tions which would give them a strong
er hold.
Whole Empire Represented.
In the day's success many parts of
the empire were represented. Aus
tralia, South Africa. England and Scot
land all gave of their magnificent
troops who pushed out across the in
hospitable marshlands and battled
their way through concrete machine
gune emplacements and redoubts.
The whole operation was a remark
able demonstration of what orzaniza
tion, backed with plenty of big guns,
can accomplish.

IS.
It now appears that there are two
sons of L. C. Shattuck listed as de
serters instead of one. Yesterday The
Review was given information that
Henry Shattuck who was registered
in Yuma county, had been called toi
report on last Wednesday and had
failed to show up as did his brother,
Worner, in this city. In order to veri
fy this report two separate telegrams
were sent to Yuma to learn the truth
of the matter. One of the messages
was sent to Dr. R. R. Knotts, the
county physician, a member of the ex
aming board, and the other was sent
to Sheriff Mel Greenleaf. The one
sent to the doctor was sent by a per
sonal friend of his in this city and
the reply was, "Henry Shattuck was
absent at roll call, his whereabouts
siot known." The other was sent by
The Review to the sheriff and the re
ply was "that he was called but did
not report."
The information that came to Thb
Review was from a young man who
was acquainted with the boys ana
who recently returned, from a trip to
California. He stopped over in Yuma
one day last week between (trains
and while there made inquires about
Henry. He was informed that Henry
was at the ranch and he endeavored
to reach hiin by phone. Henry had
left the ranch with his brother, War
ner, and was on the way to Yuma, re
plied a man at the ranch to the Bis
bee man's inquiry. The Bisbee youth
had but a short time to wait before
his train left and did not get to see
the boys.
It is now evident that both the
boys were at Yuma a few days before
they were to report and left ther to
gether to avoid the draft. It has al
so been discovered that Warner Shae
tuck did not leave the city as was re
ported the latter part of last month,
at the Shattuck mine after the first
of the present month.
Numerous reports have been cicu
lated that Warner had been captured
near Nogales and other parts of So
nora, but the officials here have not
bad an official report on the capture.

Same Object Had.
"Happy in the though that our de
sires from the first were directed to
ward the same object your Holiness
today characterizes as o ne we
strive for, we have taken close con
sideration the concrete and practical
suggestions of your Holiness and have
come to the following conditions:
International Justice.
"Wi.'h deep-rooted conviction w
agree to the leading idea oi yoiv
Holiness that the future arrangement
of the world must be based on the
elimination of armed forces and on
the moral force of right and on the
rule of international justice and legal
ity. "Fully conscious of the importance
of the promotion of peace on' the
method proposed by your Holiness,
namely to submit international dis
putes to compulsory arbitration, we
are alsq prepared to enter into ne
gotiations regarding this proposal.
Wants Security Assured.
"If, as we most heartily desire,
agreements should be arrived at be
tween the belligerents which would
realize this sublime idea and thereby
give security to the Austro-Hungarian
monarchy for its unhampered future
development, it can then not be dif
ficult to find a satisfactory solution
of the other questions which still re
main to be settled between the belli
gerents in a spirit of justice and of a
reasonable consideration of the con
ditions for existence of both parties.
"If the nations of the earth were U
enter, with a desire for peace, into
negotiations with one another in tlft.
sense of your Holiness' proposals, then
peace could blossom forth among
them. The nations could obtain com
plete freedom of movement on the
hish seas in order that heavy burden
may be taken from the nations and
new success of prosperity opened to
them. -
Suitable Basis. . ,
"Guided by a spirit of moderation
and conciliation, we see in the pro
poslas of your Holiness a suitable)
basis for intiating negotiations with
a view to preparing a peace just to
all and lasting, we earnestly hope our
present enemies may be animated by
the same ideas. In this spirit we beg
that th Almighty may bless the work
of peace begun by your Holiness.

to the large number of slackers they
were not able to fill the qouta. As it

to show up so that it was impossible
to fill the list to 270. Four of the

The Chinese government has sounciei

ders, however, the activity is not in
tense. Berlin Admits Los.
The British are holding tight to the
new positions taken from the Ger
mans on Thursday. Berlin officially
admits that the British effort was suc
cessful and that the Germans were
forced to evacuate seme of their de
fenses in the vital Ypres salient, but
it attempts to minimize the import
ance of the advance. The British
losses in the assault are reported to,
have been light.
Crown Prince Loses.
On the southern end of the western
front the German crown prince has
suffered severe losses in an unsuccess
ful attack on Mont Haute in Cham
pagne. Other attacks by the Ger
mans on the Aisne Front and near
Verdun were repelled by the French.
There has been no marked fighting
activity on the eastern front.

In the Trentino, however, the two
armies have been more active. In an
attack at Cima Sief in the Dolmito

defenses. The impossible of securing
shelter, however, forced the Italians
to retire.

The Argentine chamber of deputies
has postponed until Saturday action
in the matter of the republic's rela

German Intrigue
Blamedby Japan
For III Feeling
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 21. German
intrigue and propanganda, rleverly
applied in both countries have pre
vented a full understanding between
America and Japan, Cisc lunt Ishii,
head of the Japaaes-j .uission lo the
United States, declared in aa address
here tonight at tiie Natlmni Press
club. The Zimmermann noi? to Mex-
j ico involving Japan gave a cluu ,to
I the secret agencle jat wo-k to part
I the east and the west, tb.? viscount
I said .but even the noise oi this "diplo
matic blunder" by Berlin gave a check
only for a time.
"Since the agents have been hard
at work,' 'the viscount continued.
"Every available argument has been
uced to show to your people and ours
what a low, cunning enemy we have
in the other and how much depend
ent we are upon the future support and
good will of Germany."
Viscount Ishii said that in all coun
tries today the forces of evil are wear
ing disguises most difficult to pene
trate and he regretted deeply to say
that owing to this difficulty the news
papers In both America and Japan,
inadvtrtently, he believed, had delay
ed the "inevitable understanding" be

surface to foreshadow impending trou
ble. Professed Ignorance i
Two weeks later, when Von liern
storff was handed his passports, he
professed ignorance of prior knowl
edge of his government's intention to
throw its promises to the winds.
Directed Machinations 1
Evidence had been accumulating to
prove that the ambassador was not
only cognizant of, but actually direct
ed, the activities of Boy-Ed and Von
Papen, military and naval attaches, ,
sent home long before the United ;
States broke relations with Germany,
because of their connection with bomb '
plots, passport frauds, spying nnd oth
er phases of the almost unlimited op- j
erations in this country of the Ger-,
man secret service. How complete is !
the evidence of German diplomatic du
plicity remaining in possession of the
United States government is only con-
jectural, but that it is far more than '
has been generally supposed is now
certain. It was intimated by govern- j
ment officials today that the series of
revelations is not nearly complete. '
From the outside there are reaching'
the state department echoes of the .
apprehension sounded by friends of
men towards whom suspicion long has :
pointed. I
More Coming j
Official repudiation was given a sug-!
gestion that a Swedish diplomat Is ;
about to be placed under the spot
light. The co-ordinated Intelligence
forces of the government are known
to be continuing their investigations,
however, and it is pointed out that
the government has not lost sight of
the necessity of watching for German
intrigue and espionage.
Representative and Peace
It was suggested at the state de
partment that the odd mixing of Count
von Bernstorff's talk about peace ana j
his secret activities while in Wash-,
ington appeared significant, in view)
of the peace propaganda recently!
emanating from Germany. j
There may be some discussion or j
the incident in the senate tomorrow i
when it reconvenes after a week vir-j
tualy in recess.
Applause for Heflin
Applause from the floor and tahe
galleries greeted Representative Her
lin's demand that the house take a
congressional investigation of the Von :
Bernstorff's message to determine if i
any members of either house had re
ceived German money. I
"I do not know to whom the count!
refers," he said, "but I do know that)
the contents of his message constit-j
tutes a serious reflection upon con-:
gress and should be investigated. If.
permitted, I could name thirteen ori
fourteen men in the two bodies wno
have acted suspiciously. If a member j
has acted suspiciously in or out of :
congress, he ought to be Investigated
and expelled If the facts warrant, ir;
any member is not giving his hearty'
support to the commander-in-chier m j
this time of war, he should be put out'
of the capitol." I
Mr. Heflin concluded by saying that, i
speaking for the house as a body, he !
repudiated the intimation conveyed by
the messuge that congress was sus-
ceptible to corruption. I

Yblle the apopintment of General

THE FIXED PRICE OF COPPER.
Well, the price of copper has been fixed, for four
months at least. The price of twenty-three and one-half
cents is not high when the prices of other commodities,
both fixed and unfixed, are considered. On the other
hand, it is not below what copper can be mined for with
a fair profit in certain mining districts of the country,
while in others it may work a hardship on producers
and labor alike.
As to how it will affect wages is not known at present,
as the heads of the two big mining companies for this
district are not at present in the city and cannot be in
terviewed on the matter. The dispatches announcing the
fixed price declared that the agreement between the gov
ernment and the operators was that the present scale of
wages was not to be lowered.
Based upon twenty-five cent copper, wages in the War
ren District are $5.25 for miners and $5.00 for muckers,
higher than anywhere else in the country.
On the sliding scale of ti;e price of copper these wages
would be reduced twenty-five cents a day under the new
price. ,
Before the war copper sold at about fourteen cents per
pound. Therefore the fixed price is an increase of about
, sixty per cent. '
' Wheat before the war sold for less than a dollar; yet
the price of wheat has been fixed at $2.20 and the farm
ers are grumbling. This is an increase of over two
hundred per cent The housewives and householders are
grumbling, too.
Steel is 200 per cent higher than before the war. Near
ly every commodity has advanced from one hundred to
two and even three hundred per cent to the consumer.
Therefore all people and communities interested in the
copper Industry have no cause to be hilarious over the
fixed price. It COULD have been worse. It could have
been much better and still have been decent and reason
able considering the conditions of a world war.
Another thing. Every pound of copper taken from a
mine is gone for the owners beyond repair. That mine
can never produce that pound of copper again. It i.
paid for, it is true, but when it is taken away the value
and life of the mine is reduced by Just that pound of Its
product and its usefulness. The same is true of steel.
But in the case of wheat the land that produced a
bushel of wheat this year will produce another bushel
next year, and the next. The land may deterioate a lit
tle, but with care and fertilizer and diversification of crops
it will go on and on producing grain.
Taking these things into account, the sixty per cent in
crease allowed the copper people and the two hundred
per cent increase allowed the grower of wheat stand uot
all the more in contrast.
Steel and copper are mined in much the same way. A
pound of the product taken from either mine is gone for
ever from the producing capacity of the mines. It will
never "grow" again for the owners. Wages for copper
miners are higher than for those mining steel, at leait
the Bisbee scale is higher than any steel mine scale. And
yet copper is allowed a sixty per cent increase because of
war conditions and steel allowed three or four times as
much.
At least no one can fay, be he politician, pulicist or
publican, that the government favored the copper inter
ests under the legislative provisions of its war powers en
actments. Frcm all accounts obtainable from Washington the cop
per operators mot the government more than half way
and showed a fine spirit of patriotism in the matter. Big
business generally has been inclined to hold out for high
profits. The copper folks, however, came forward frank
ly and sought to co-operate with the government in every
way possible. They are harder hit by the fixed price
than those dealing in any other great war commodity or
necessity, whether it he metal, wood or food, but so far
there has not been a murmur. Nor are the operators
feeding copper to the hogs like certain indignant Okla
homa farmers are feeding wheat.
It is possible that li price will be raised after the
first four months. Much copper has already been sold
to the government that will come under this new price.
One thing is sure, the new price, even if it is not a lift, is
not a blow at Bisbee and her prosperity and growth for
the winter. Business rhould be better here the next
six months than ever before in the district. Wages are
higher here than elsewhere, mine conditions are better
and the camp is clean end Americanized.
MISSOURI'S SENATORIAL DISGRACE.
(Kansas City Star.)
The growing resentment and indignation over the course
of Missouri's senators at Washington is one of the clear
est signs yet revealed that the people of this state are
sensing the war and all that it means to America. Sena
tors Stone and Reed were Just as bad representatives of
J issouri before the war as they have been since, but their
acts and votes in the senate called forth no such public
condemnation as has their course of opposition to the
president and obstruction of the administration's war
measures.
The reason is plain. Partisan politics jti&A made these
men the senators of the democratic party. What they
did or failed to do was felt to be the business of that
party. If it wanted to risk carrying such a load it could.
The average citizen felt 't was pretty tough on Missouri,
but was willing to wait with patience until the time came
to replace them.
But this tolerant attitude was changed when the war
revealed Stone and Reed as active workers against the
president in .his task of putting the nation in a state of
defense. At once they became conspicuous in their un
fitness and Missouri was regarded by the rest of the
country as a slacker state.
It is resentment against this conception that is now
giving form to the opposition to these senators in their
own party and throughout the state. The Stone-Reed
course in the senate is recognized as a reflection upon the
patriotism of Missouri. This state is in the war as much
as Massachusetts and New York and it doesn't relish hav
ing its senators pointed out in Washington as enemies cf
the war administration aud generals of the obstructionist
hosts.
Missouri could stand Stone and Reed in time of peace
and politics, but with the nation at war it demands Amer
icans to speak for it in the senate. Thousands of the
state's young men are now in camp. Thousands have en
listed in the navy and regular army. Hospitals for the
wounded are to be established at Kansas City and St.
Louis. Every day the war comes nearer, and the nearor
it comes the greater will grow the demand for senators
at Washington who will represent the Americanism of the
people. (
How many soldiers have we in France right now? No
one knows but the war department, and it won't tell. Say,
fifty thousand, maybe seventy-five. Well, they are go
ing to see service pretty soon. Winter trench fighting
for the Pershing forces is forecasted in the news from
France.
Rail and Colder, says the weather man every evening.
And then the next morning the sun fights hard to break
from behind the clouds. Which goes to show that, no
matter how heavy the clouds, old Mister Sun is back
there somewhere ready to shine as soon as he gets a
chance.
An authority declares that the life of a fighting air
plane is Just two days. He says further that Germany ib
building airplanes at the rate of sixty thousand a year.
He avers that the United States must build one hundred
thousand fliers before her efforts in the air will really
ba felt by the Hun. Petty big contract, but we have
undertaken -it.
"It is now nineteen hundred years since Caser defeated
the Germans in France. When they came asking terms
he said to them, 'Go back whence you came, repair the
damages you have done and give hostages to keep the
peace for the future.' It was the ancient and barbaric
custom to take prisoners and high men as hostages, and
this custom Germany followed when she entered Belgium.
But the world does not ask such hostages today. It is
the problem of world statesmanship to decide what kind
of hostages that Germany can give when she has been
convinced that her dream of world overmastery cannot
come true." Franklin Lane, Secretary of Commerce.
Yesterday's dispatches carried the information that
Captain George H. Scruton, captain in tho U. S. army
had cabled to his wife in Sedafia, Mo., the fact of his safe
arrival in France. The Review editor has tiie honor to
be an intimate friend of Captain Scruton. But that is
not the point of this editorial. The point is, that Scrut
on is not a fighting man, he is just a newspaper man, a
family -man, a quiet, peaceable, ordinary, everyday citizen
who pays takes, shaves himself with a safety razor and
reads the baseball scores and tries to keep his neighbor'3
chickens out of his garden. He Is past the age when
love of adventure appeals to his reckless zest inherited
frcm a caveman ancestor. But he left his paper snl
his life work aud his viife and family and entered tin;
army as a fighting man boiause of a sense of duty, bo
cause of deep seated patriotism, because of outraged hu
manity. He is a citizen soldier, moved to the stern trade
of war by the rightfulness of his country's enemies, and
this is the greatest material in the world today frori
which to make a fighting machine that will not be denied
upon any battle filed. Here's to this little man Scruton,
the editor and civilian, somewhere in France with an
automatic pistol and red leather puttees and a stern de
termination to Kill a ITUEsiau for the general good of tin-world.
Rippling Rhymes I
(By WALT MASON.) j
THE ARGUING MAN.
I hired a man to work around, to
groom the cow and feed the snakes,
and after seven weeks I found he
wasn't worth a brace of shakes. I'd
say, 'Oh, james, I wish you'd start
and paint the fence dark blue and
pink." He'd say, "Have some respect
for Art! That combination's rank, 1
think. If I should paint it red and
green, the colors nicely would com
bine, and every passer-by, I ween,
would cry. 'Oh, chee! That fence is
fine!'" Then I'd reply, "I pay the
mon to have that fence the way 1
wish; my' wry I'll surely have it done,
or you will lose your job, adsfish!-'
Then he would quote a lot of jays,
old Rembrandt, Titian and that mob,
to show that artist folk would raise
a clamor o'er the measly job. So we
ould stand in jo'nt debate, until the
sinking of the sun, and when the day
light pulled Its freight, there was no
job of painting done. Now, James is
poor, and always was, and always will
be till he dies; he labors too much
with his jaws to satisfy employing
guys. My way of doing things is punk.
I'm always in the wrong, I know; but
jrhen for toil I pay the plunk, I guess
my way will have' to go.

AIRSiiFIS FROM PHOE
NIX TO GLOBE-MIAMI
SOON A REALITY
In view of the fact that aerial trans
portation will befbre long be estab
lished between Phoenix and the Globe
Miami district, the remarkable impor
tance that the aeroplane has attained,
aa outlined by Major R. Perfetti of
the Royal Italian Flying corps, who
is now in the United States, will be
of interest to those having business in
those copper camps. -
Before a gathering of prominent peo
ple in Newport, R. I., on the evening
'of August 31. Major Perfetti said:
"The distinction of conducting the
largest air raid ever conducted so far
went to Italy a few days ago when
232 aeroplanes, most of which were,
unfortunately, of the Smaller type,
stormed an Austrian base. The raid
was successful and only one aeroplane
failed to return. l
"This raid showed more than ever
the revolutionary value of aircran ana
why the world's authorities now be
lieve that the war is to be decided
in the air.
"Up to recently the one difficult
problem of the allies was to find a
means of eliminating the U-boat men
ace. I am glad to be able to say now
that there is a solution of this prob
lem. Our plan will consist of taking
the largest Italian air cruisers which
can carry twenty-five passengers, and
building another even larger air crui
ser, the design of which has just been
completed by the same Italian engi
neers who designed and built the two
passenger machines, and flying these
machines across the Atlantic.
"This would solve ror good the
sending of aeroplanes from the United
States to the allies and whereas it
is less than 500 miles Mim Great Brit
ain to Keil, Wilhelmshaven, Essen
and other German U-boat and military
bases, these air cruisers delivered
from the United States to Europe by
air line can then be sent to destroy
the German bases.
"These two giant air cruisers are
the latest Italian developments in ae
ronautics. Having to fight a powerful
enemy over the Gorizia mountains and
across the Adriatic sea, the Italians
have had to evolve dreadnaugbts of
the air, which can fly over mountains
and across seas. The result was that
Italian genius developed the largo
Carponi tri-planes with a useful load
carrying weight of about five tons;
also the greatest speed 157 miles per
hour which is developed by the latest
romilio machine.
Until recently the activities of the
Apache Aerial Transportation com
pany, a corporation of focal and Globe
and Miami people, was suspended for
the reason that permission bad to d
obtained from the state corporation
commission before the stock could be
sold. This permission has now been
granted, and the company is going
ahead in a straightforward and deter
mined way lo put this lino into opera
tion as early as possible.

Unless there should be some unavoid

work is expected to go along with the
usual speed characteristic of the di

ceived a telegram Saturday, followed
by a letter today, from an old friend
In New Mexico, offering him a half
interest in a proposition that should
make $100,000 by January 1. Mr. Ir
vin immediately wired him that it is
Impossible for him to accept the of-
fer. He says he does not know the
nature of the business, but knowing
the man to be a good business man
who has made lots of money, he woul3
surely take him up if he was not in
Uncle Sam's enip'oy and had many
other Interests which hold him here.
Irvin says $50,000 is a lot of money,
but It would be worih that much to
leave Phoenix to go to New Mexico.

DISTRICT BOARD ASKS
FOR INFORMATION IN
ALL EXEMPT CASES
"All claims for exemption allowed
by the district exemption board are
subject to reconsideration and if any
person knows any facts which tend
to show that the board in this dis
trict has made a mistake in allowing
a claim, we shall be glad to receive
that information," said D. H. Clar-
idge, president of the board at Tucson
yesterday.
The board has been criticized in
some quarters for allowing claims
for exemption by parties who prob
ably are in possession of facts not
before the board and it is for this
reason that the board invites the sub
mission of evidence not before them.
'WTe must act on the evidence be
fore us," continued Senator Claridge.
This must be supplied by the party
applying for the exemption. While
evidence must be in affidavit form.
we will appreciate information, not
under oath which will lead us to dis
close evidence which we ran obtain
n a legal manner.
'We do not want to be a party
to assisting any slacker to escape
service. We are giving our time
and careful attention to all claims

that is before us, but all claims are,
subject to reconsideration and action

reconsider our course where evi

us doing so."

BISBEE FUEL DEALER
TAKER EXCEPTION TO
mm EDITORIAL
Local Man Contends That
Printed Statements Are Un
fair to the Dealers in the
Warren District
Miss Carlota Moyer of Y. W. C.A.
Rounds Out 15 Years of Services
Editor Review:
In this mornings editorials of your
paper you have, under the caption
THE PRICE OF COAL." an article
manifestly unfair to the furl dealers
of thi.H city, and feeling the you were
sincere even though in error in mis
statements made, we take the liberty
to point out to you, by request of all
interested, those errors and ask that
you at least PLAY FAIR until the mat
ter is definitely adjusted b ythe gov
ernment.
To begin: You state that New Mex
ico coal is $2.40 at the mines, quoting
Dawson coal. First, there is no New
Mexico rate, as none was definitely es
tablished for New Mexico. Secondly,
there is no definitely established rate
at any mine by the government, be it
New Mexico or any other state. The
government fixed a tentative rate as
basis to work upon for the various
mines, from- whicli it has receded, af
ter a conference with the operators,
and now agrees to readjust the whole
basis of prices at the mines granting
in most instances an increase over
former basis. Until that basis is fix
ed and becomes permanent nothing
definite can be done.
Back to the Dawson coal. Will say
that Dawson coal, in this district, is
not used as a domestic coal, but is a
steam coal. Were it a domestic coal
it would, on account of freight rates
and other considerations, take preced
ent in this district, but as it is it is
not handled here but little if at al
Last winter when the district was up
against it so hard an effort was made
to get Dawson coal but "nothing do
ing.
Further as to the New Mexico coal
fields. While you freely quote from
there and leave false impressions with
the public you do not tell the public
that the Gallup District, where the
cheaper and better grade of coal comes
from, has been closed, in so far as the
domestic trade is concerned, and has
been since July first on account of la
bor troubles. On yesterday we were
In receipt of ioformatlon from the
manager of the Gallup-American
Mines that no domestic coal could be
expected from the Gallup District this
winter. That eliminates New Mex
ico. Please tell the public this.
You sny, after quoting Dawson
coal: "Some where between the pro-
1ucer and transporter and consumer
meaning the retail dealer) some one
Is making ten dollars a ton on coal."
This so unfair a statement that we
are more than surprised at the Re
view, which usually tries to stick to
facts, but as the article was written
by some one wholly unfamiliar with
the facts that we forgive and try to
enlighten, to-wit:
There is no source to get coal into
Bisbee except fone your quotations
o tho contrary and that source is
Colorado, all other fields are closed to
Bisbee. Colorado coal, domestic nut
and lump, sacked and delivered to
our yards on the Slag Dump, costs
$15.53 per ton. We have invoices and
freight bills to prove this, and we sell
same at $17.00, which gives us a gross
profit of $1.50 from which we pay our
overhead and have enough left to pos-
ibly buy a meal ticket
When we tell you. Review, that
the freight rate from the Colorado
field is $5.98 with a diversion 'charge
of $2.00, making an average car cost
$6.05 or a total of $240.00 per car, and
that the burlap sacks in which we are
required by the public to sack it, are
costing 12 l-4c each or $2.45 per ton.
making a total for the freight and
sacks alone of $9.00 before we touch
the coal, I think you can, even though
you are some what inaccurate in fig
ures, begin to realize where the cost
comes in. To this $9.00 add the cost
of the coal, all that is now in Hisbe?,
$4.50, and at the very vest and lowest
estimate for hauling to the yard and
then delivery to the public, $2.00, or a
total of $G..0, and you have $15.50.
Where does the little retail coal man,
who i3 doing his "bit", patriotically
. peaking, in trying to keep the dis
trict in fuel for the winter, GET OFF,
when he sells this same coal at $171
If there ever was a time when busi
ness was placed upon an acconimo'la-
tlon basis, for the good of the publi
and the country, that time is NOW in!
so far as the retail coal and wood peo
ple of Bisbee are concerned.
Yo;i possibly will say, "The govern
ment has fixed $2.S5 for coal at tli"
mines in Colorado," which Is true tent
atively, hut Ihore is none of that coal.

WATER
HE A TING
GAS
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or smalL
Today, in th countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few riin-
H utes after lighting the heateis, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NTW YORK, Sept. 21. Following
the lead of the copper shares which
were stimulated by the announcement
that a price of 23 cents for the
metal had been agreed-upon, the stock
market at the opening today gave the
best exhibition of strength since the
turn of the market Wednesday. A
reaction , came quickly, however, and
the market was depressed below yes
terday's last figures. Toward the
close renewed strength appeared and
the advance was resumed energetical
ly. Total sales were 6G5.000 shares.
The price fixed for copper was re
garded as satisfactory, not only be
cause' it put an end to fears of a
severe scaling down In the quotation
but because of the favorable infer
ences which might be drawn In re
gard to the settlement of similar pend
ing quotations.
The coppers developed pronounced
strength on the late upturn with a
gain of 3 for smelting. Steel also
was active and strong.
There was unusually active demand
mor liberty bonds which sold above
par for the first time In months. The,
range was 99.98 to 100.02. The'gener
al bond was heavy with further weak
ness in Investment Issues. Total
sales, par value, $5,500,000. United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept 21. Bears too
control of the corn market today, ow
ing chiefly to the fact that threaten
ed damage by frost had failed to de
velop. The market closed unsettled,
to 1 cents net lower, at 118
to 118Vi December and 114 to 115
May. Oats finished to off and
provisions up 5 to 50 cents.
A forecast of generally fatr and
warmer weather added force to the
sentiment against the bulls In corn.
Oats descended with corn. Large
primary receipts and talk of an em
bargo at Baltimore acted as a weight
on the market
Receipts of wheat are still heavily
short of last year's figures, notwith
standing an increase of 75,000 bushels
for the week at Minneapolis as com
pared with a decrease of 120,000 bush,
els a year ago. On the other hand,
fall seeding is much further advanced
than is usual at this time. The acre
age is the largest known.
Higher quotations on hogs lifted
provisions. The weakness of corn led
to a temporary setback, but was over
come by support from packers.

NEW YORK, Sept 21. After the
initial display of strength, the market
was subjected to considerable realiz
ing by buyers of the early in the week
but offerings were absorbed in impres
sive fashion and as. the -session prog
ressed, the market under the leader
ship of the copper issues, displayed
renewed buyoancy, with quotations
for many stocks apprecibly above yes
terday's finals. Buying was actuated
by the liberal treatment accorded the
copper producers of the country, by
the government in its dictation of a
price of 23 cents a pound for the
red metal. This ,of course, is taken
as a precursor of similar reasonable
ness to be extended to manufacturers
of steel and furthermore bas forced
the belief that the government in its
effort to keep the price of the various
vital necessities within bounds, will
not adopt drastic methods.
Consequently more cheerful senti
ment is engendered and the loanlngs
of banking interests seem to be along
more constructive lines. As a result
security prices will likewise reflect
the changed order of things by in
clining upwards.

NO SPIRIT
Alfred A. Knopf, New York's Rus
sian expert, said the other day:
"The Russian revolutionists are
mystics. They're Idealists. They now
invite the German populace to revolt,
but revolution demands a democratic
spirit, and the Germail people, so far
as a democratic spirit goes, are as
deficient as the old lady.
"A very fat old lady got stuck In
tbe door of a car, and could get nei
ther out or in.
"'Sideways, ma'am! Try sideways!'
conductor shouted helpfully.
"'Oh, drat the feller! panted the
old lady; 'I ain't got no sideways.'"
