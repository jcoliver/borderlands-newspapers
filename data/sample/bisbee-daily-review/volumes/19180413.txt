(By Review Lensel Wire
LONDON. April 12. A definite
crisis has again been reached. Major
General F. It. Maurice, chief director
of military operaticns at the war of
fire, declared today.
"The situation is undoubtedly un
pleasant." he added. "The enemy is
within a short distance of Bailleul.
which is an important railway center
for feeding our Messines-Wytschaete
front. He is also advancing in the di
rection of Hazehrouck. w hich is a very
Important railway center."
General Maurice said that on the
other hand the Germans are advanc
ing on a very flat and intricate coun
try and have not yet gained any domi
nating posf'ion- Seventeen enemy di
visions have been engaged up to the
present and the enemy has lost very
heavily.
"I have little to add to the official
statement from Field Marshal Haig
at noon today. It gives a full account
of the present situation," said General
Maurice. "The enemy has attacked
on a front from Hollebeke to La
l!assee, and on that front has up to
the present ecgaged at least seven
teen divisions.
"Beginning at the north his attacks
on the Wytschaete - Messines ridge ,
have not met with vry appreciable j
success. There has been '"very heavy
fighting there and the enemy has lost'
very heavi'.y. He has failed o get on I

been no material change in the situa

evacuation of Armentieres.

VETERAN TENNIS MAN
OF SOUTHWEST VISITS
FRIENDS IN DISTRICT
Mike Xeff. father of the liorder
Slant Tennis associatiou and oue of
th.5 lurmost enthusiasts of the south
west, and member of the firm of Ncif
Stiies company, of El Paso, dropped
into I'.isbee yesterday. He will re
main here several days on business.
Meantime he is renewing his friend
ships in this district.
Mr Xeff is honorary president of
the 1 '-order States association for life.
Thnugh his enthusiastic boosting and
assistance the organization of the as
sociiwon was consumated several
years ago. It was then known as the
Sou'hwestern association, but when
officials thought to affiliate the club
with ibe national association it was
lour.'i liecessary to change the name.
Among the most interesting of the
details of Mr. Neff's close interest in
the association, is the invention and
promotion of the senior contests
which are open to me.ubers of the as
sociation who have passed the thirty
live year mile-post. This event,
known as the "Grand Old Man's"
clash, was first introduced to the ten
nis voi Id through the efforts oi Mr.
Neil and associates. Soon it hud be
come a nation-wide event, and there
is scarce a tournament of importance
todry in which the veteran singles are
not included.
.iir. Xeff stales that all indications
point to a successful and interesting
liorder States tournament when the
event is pulled in El I'aso late in May.
His be e has waived her claim to the
tournament to the Pass City, and
plans for a patriotic event are being
conij-luted by the border fans. A
larse cttendance from Arizona and
Xe- Mexico is anticipated at the
meeting, says the El Pasoan, and oue
of the fastest events in the history of
the association is anticipated.

Shake Off That Grip
When Spring comes, with itschangeable weather
and your exposure, it is best to clear away all the
symptoms left after an 'attack of grip. That evil
disease leaves you weakened, and when its victim
attempts to "do his bit" he exposes himself tothe risk of a second
attack, for which he h less prepared, and which may have graver
consequences.
There's Danger in Delay
April and May are pneumonia months. In this time a weak
f nnd system is a constant source of danger, for the pneumonia
;:Jid grip infections are ia the air, and after a long winter the
iHvly is so clogged with waste it cannot resist them. Fortify
the health, remove the catarrh, and improve the digestion.

This reliable tonic is recommended to remove the waste

inflammation that is catarrh, restore the regular appetite and
tone up the entire system to resist disease. A well man is safe.
As a tonic after grip it has won many commendations, while itseflert

CvV.. Interest asaln centred In the j
vr.r revs, which threw little iluht on j
tiie cource of events across the wttrr. !
The market's liquidated condition I
was clearly demonstrated by the ease )
w ith which standard shares railed ;
fro'n occasional pressure.
Few specialties were fairly nctlve
but their movements elicited no soe
cia linterest. Pails were sluesish but
firm. Equipments pained 1 to 14
points, with copners. motors and oils,
and shippings hardened after early
hesitation.
SneciaMes were featured by Indus

sain of Si points. Sales amounted
to ?l.ooo shares.
General pews, aside from the pro
press of the Liberty loan drive and
prospective placing of laree trovern
rient ror.tracts fo rrailwar equipment
was mostly negative and without
bearing upon valus.
The nsual Irregularity extending to
Industrial Issues, was manifested by
the bond market, the liberty divisions
making slicht rains. Total sales (par

GRAIN
CHICAOO. April 12. Liklihoo of

from St. Louis, Omaha and Toledo

whi-h took place today In com prices.
The market closed weak at the same
as yefterrinv's finish to 34 cents low
er. 'with May 1274 and July 15 to
lot'-i. Oars declined "i to V,U net.
an provisions 17 to 30 cents.
It oniric I v became apparent that
sentiment in the com trade had under
tone a decided change and that yes
terday's swift advance was generally
regarded as excessive. Talk of an in
crease In the crcp movement next
week was current.
Authoritative warnings were also
circulated that If the removal of the
maximum price re exercised an nn
d'llr bullish influence speculative
liOldf38 would he cut to ten thou
sand bushels. The most lasting de
gression, however came from sfcns,
that unless Chicago prices receded to

primary centers would be unloaded
here on a laree scnle.

A WAR PICTURE.
OYafehington Times.)
One war picture, an actual photograph
should be enlarged to life size and put up
on every dead wall in Germany now.
Eventually the German nation, having
conquered freedom in getting rid of the
Hohenzollern brute family, will make that
picture conspicuous.
It shows blind German soldiers, led by a
woman, going out into the fields to labor.
The line under the picture says, "Even
those blinded by war in Germany must
work."
The miserable creatures, forever sight
less, are led to their spot in the field by the
woman and told "dig here, and walk slowly
forward, digging as you go."
It is a photograph of a few Germans
about twenty-five, blind, in a group. It is
also a photograph of the entire German na
tion as it was when this war began.
As the girl in the photograph leads the
blind soldiers into the fields to dig, so the
kaiser in that other picture of the war's
beginning, led the blind German nation IN
TO THE FIELDS TO MURDER.
He put each man in his place and said,
"KILL HERE, and walk forward, killing
as you walk."
They obeyed. Millions of them are dead,
other millions are wounded, and thousands
are blind but not one more blind than the
German nation that with seeing eyes look
ed at the brutal kaiser in adoration, and
obeyed his orders to murder for his glory.
Never during the war, not even at Ver
dun, have the French fought better than
they are fighting now. When the Poilus
came forward at the southern end of the
line they halted the Prussian in his tracks.
Taking over nearly half of the battle line,
the French troops, outnumbered and call
ing upon none of their strategic reserve,
have held everywhere excepting for slight
withdrawals in local sectors and have, in
counter attacks, outfought and driven back
the pick of the Prussian guards and shock
troops and Brandenburgers. It will be
noted from the dispatches that the German
offensive south of Montdidier, a storm cen
ter during the later part of the great effort,
has languished for the past week. French
artillery claimed a dreadful toll during the
last effort of the German to break through
to the south. The more closely and thought
fully one considers this mighty conflict and
.reflects upon the sp'irit bf the stubborn
British and glorious French troops after
nearly three weeks of battling against odds,
the more tme is inclined to supreme confi
dence in the ultimate result in spite of the
discouraging news from day to day of fierce
and unending attacks and German ad
vances. "The race is not always to the
swift, or the battle to the strong."
"English troops retired from Armenti
eres in orderly ranks and most deliberate
manner," read the gloomy tidings of yes
terday over the wires. Pocketed by the ad
vance on either side, the town wa3 too cost
ly to hold, considering its strategic import
ance. And therein lies the entire story and
contrast of German and British methods.
In fact, here is the most cheering thing
about all the bad news of weeks of the Ger
man advance and the allied retirements. The
advance and the allied retirements. . The
allies hold their front lines lightly in order
to save men. A determined attack in
force suported by heavy artillery fire will
always gain against the allies. The Ger
mans hold their front lines heavily and will
rp-?nd men by the thousand rather than
give up a foot of ground. German pride;
German pigheadedness, we call it; forbid
the.t the Prussian superman should retire,
reheat. Hence in allied attacks but little
ground is gained. The final result of these
methods i3 plain to any one. German suc
cess, in holding ground and in gaining
grcur.d is spectacular; allied success in this
particular suffers sadly in comparison. But
in wastage of manpower the German
method has its terrible handicap. Lost
ground can be won again, but lost men can
never be replaced in this war. Today is
Germany's day; but tomorrow, what of
that? Who will hold that long German
line from Switzerland to the sea next fall ?
Certainly not the three-quarters of a mil
lion of the flower of the German forces
who will have perished by then. Only their
ghosts will haunt the crimson fields. This
is not a battle, or a campaign, it is a war to
a finish. And the side with the manpower
and the material and the money at the end
will win. We are husbanding our resources ;
Germany is squandering hers. When dog
days come, we shall see who was the
wisest. In the meantime, note again the
order of the British retreat: "Orderly and
deliberate." Land has been conquered by
the foot, the yard, the parasang and the
mile, but not the British spirit. These same
troops will be ready to fight next fall. Will
Von Hindenburg's machine be in as good
condition next fall as it is now?
With three weeks of continuous bad
news from the front, America has roused
herself like a lion. All the speeches and
messages and appeals from the tongues of
men and angels could not have done the
good the kaiser's great drive has done in
stirring thi3 great nation to her uttermost.
Everything has been speeded up since that
momentous day of March 2 1 to a velocity
the most hopeful would not have dared to
predict. Men are moving, wheels are turn
ing, money is pouring in. Up to March
21 that spirit of terrible earnestness had
been lacking. We had, as a nation, under
estimated our job. We felt that the Ger
man, weakened by the blockade and the
strain of war, was not a match for the French
and British alone. We did not reckon the full
menace of the Russian collapse. Now we
know just how dangerous is the blonde
beast and how all our might is needed to
bring him low. Instead of quailing before
the storm, as the Prussian fondly imagines,
American force has been multiplied by the
pressing danger of the Hun drive upon
Paris and the ports along the channel.
Consider again the Russian situation.
Always it gets worse. We had just as well
face it. The Bolsheviki is right out in the
open, no longer a Prussian tool and agent,
but a Prussian friend and ally. The Lenine
outfit has protested the landing of allied
forces at Vladivistok and threatens to fight
them. And yet the allied landing parties
are there simply to protect allied war mate
rials, sent there with the understanding
they were to be used against the Hun. But
did the Bolsheviki threaten to fight the Ger
man troops who have seized three-fourths
of the fairest portions of Russia? Not at
all. But a mere landing party in far off
Siberia arouses the Bolsheviki ire and war
spirit to a flame. Strange? Not at, all.
It is part of the German plan, agreed to by
Lenine before he went to Russia with Ger
man gold to betray that foolish and unhap
py country to its worse enemies. When,
oh, when, will the allies loose the Jap le
gions against this giant, doped by its ene
mies and running amuck among its friends?
Late dispatches from the battle front are
the, most serious and disquieting since the
German offensive began March 21. The
British have been forced back in the coast
sector until they are actually fighting with
their back to the wall. They have been
driven back only about 'seven miles, but
they cannot give more ground without im
periling their connection with the French
armies to the south and giving up most im
partant coast defenses and railroad junc
tions. The entire northern British lines
will be endangered by further withdrawal
here. Arras and Messines ridge, success
fully defended so far, will have to be evacu
ated if the drive west of Armentieres con
tinues. Distressing indeed is the last news
from Marshal Haig. But the British are
not beaten yet. It simply means we must
shut our lips tight and put every ounce in
to American effort to place more Ameri
can force into this titanic struggle. If Foch
has a strategic reserve of 800,000 men he
will never have a better chance to use them
to advantage than right now in that sector
west of Armentieres.
Count Czernin for Austria - Hungary
speaks softly about the possibility of peace.
But when the concrete terms are laid down
they prove to be those of Germany as
was demonstrated in the case of Russia. It
is an old trick. The voice, a3 Isaac remark
ed long ago, is Jacob's voice, but the hands
are the hands of Esau.
Germany is opposed to annexations, be
cause absorptions seem to be to much better.

Reconstruction of the Southern Pa
cific depot at Tucson to extend the
second floor over all the lower struc
ture and permit of one large wait

COCHISE
PIONEER
VISITS
PHOENIX. April 12. An interest
ing una distinguished visitor in Phoe
nix during the past week was Captain
Jack R. Dean, a well-known Arizona
pioneer. Captain Dean is in Pnoenix
tor the purpose of doing wnat he can
to secure an appointment in the
United States army, and being in
tensely patriotic, he is leaving notn
lng undone that will assist in nis get
ting into his country's service at tms
tin:
Captain Dean has an interesting
early Arizona history, in appearance
he is still a very young man, robust
and full of enthusiasm and apparently
in splendid physical shape for the en
durance of very great hardships. He
came to Arizona from Nevada, over
land in 1879. He rode pony express
front Quail Springs to Stone's terry,
carrying mail for the government. In
the tall of 1879 he first came to Phoe
nix, fiom which place he went to Tuc
son anu later to Tombstone where he
operated a caltle ranch in the Sulphur
Springs, valley owned by Tom Jones.
When the Apaches under Geronimo
broke out he was ranching with Frank
Leslie, better known as Buckskin
Frank in' the Swissselm mountains. At
the urgent request of Captain Lawton,
commanding B troop, 4th cavalry both
Leslie and Dean joined the troops as
scouts and guides, remaining in the
service of the government until Gero
nim surrendered to General Miles at
SkeleHton canyon. He was 10 miles
from Captain Emmet Crawford's com
mand when Captain Crawford was
shot by Mexican troops across the line
in Mexico, arriving with dispatches
Just before Captain Crawford died.
Lieutenant Marion P. Maus took com
mand and with Tom Horn as inter
preter, went into the hostile camp and
secured Geroninio's consent to sur
render. Lieutenant Maus, Tom Horn
and Johnnie Dean, as the captain was
then Inown, and who was said to have
been the youngest government scout
in the service at that time, were the
only -white 'men who visited Geroni
mo's camp.
Fine Bridge
For Highway
It is pleasing to note that the deep
gulch near the San Diego smelter on
the state highway near Tombstone will
be dossed by an artistic bridge of the
desiga known as the Luton arch, ac
cording to Division Engineer Cy Per
kins vow in camp personally supervis
ing the work. Mr. Perkins is much
pleased that his suggestion has been
adopted for this particular style of
bridpf- for the reason that this being
one of the best stretches of state high
way r.nd its coming importance he be
lieves in both beauty and efficiency
being embodied in work that will coma
under the eye of people from all over
the country.
Nothing like good roads advertises
a country and to have artistic bridges
at advantageous points but adds to
the pleasure, delight and comfort of
the "borne folks" as well as those who
cross country and leave foreign coin
in local tills.
Preliminary arrangements arc 'now
being perfected to get water to the
new bridge site which will be about
one hundred feet in length. The
right of way above Tenth street' In
Tombstone is now being secured, the
road is to be changed slightly from
the tiidge to the point where it will
connect with Fremont street at Tenth,
so at. to avoid crossing and recrossing
the milroad track as the original sur
vey called for.
The opening of the last mile and
one-ralf which permits travel to taki
the new highway at the present road
camp has been accomplished without
a rain falling on it. This is because
of the fact that the caliche surfacing
on that stretch was of such tine qual
ity and heavy enough to pack exceed
ingly well without the aid of rain, but
when it is rained on and dragged that
particular section will be like a paved
road.'

The third preliminary started out j the cjrcus so i,)ng that they were un
like a pink tea and ended like a bat-jaDle to fill their engagement yester-
tle in Fland-srs. Young Dallas, furn
ished the heavy artillery and Young
Klcbey was at the receiving end. In
the first round, both fighters danced
around the ring and gave an exhibi
tion of shadow boxing, occasionally
tapping each other lightly and push
ing each other about in a most lady
like manner.
The second round was a little faster
and Young Dallas gave, a forecast to
day in the border city. It would
have been impossible for the show to
have left Douglas for the Bisbee en
gagement, owing to the long time
since the animals had been fed, due
to the accident.
