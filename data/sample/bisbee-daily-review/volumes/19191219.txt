Have Violated no Law in

CHICAGO. Dec. 18. -All statements
from the packers tonight reaffirmed
that they had Tiolated no laws, that
their agreement ith the attorney
general implied no guilt on their
Dart, but that they had encountered
prejudice which they wished to er

said the only actions pending were a
grand Jury investigation begun in
Chicago September 1 and then sus
pended; complaints issued by the
federal trade commission, alleging un
fair competition, not yet heard, and
the interstate commerce commission's
hearing on the National Wholesale
Grocers' association complaint that
refrigerator cars were used to haul
groceries and thus packers were
favored over wholesale grocers by the
railroads. That latter action, how
ever, was directed against the hail-

Mexican General Sidesteps
Attempt of Carranza to
Sidetrack Him
SAN ANTONIO. Texas, Dec. 18.
General Alvaro Obregon does not
consider himself to be a Mexican fed
eral officer, in view of the fact that
the senate has accepted his resigntt
tiofl. as a major general, and his cam
paign for the presidency will go on
"to the end," according to a com
munication received here.
Recent advices from Mexico City
stated President Carranza had re
fused to accept General Obregon's
resignation from the army. A re
cent order by the president prohibit
ed army officers from seeking pol
itical office.
In the letter Obregon said he first
presented his, resignation to Presi
dent Carranza, who replied over his
signature that the national senate
was the only body that could act on
it.
"Furthermore," Obregon continued,
"two months after my resignation
was accepted by the senate, I reached
the city of Guadalajara, and. before
reaching there the" department of war,
under the immediate charge of Presi
dent Carranza, sent an order to the
military commandant of Guaralajara
in which order it state: 'Extend no
military honors or courtesies to the
Citizen Alvaro Obregon, formerly
a general of division, because he is
no longer connected with the army.
"My campaign for the presidency
will go on and trivial objections in
terposed at this time will avail my
enemies nothing, for I am in the
race to the end."

Inefficiency and Carelessness
Are Freely Alleged Against
Corporation
l WASHINGTON, Dec. 18. Ineffi
ciency, carelessness and a disregard
of the provisions of the act under
which it operated were charged
against the United States housing cor
poration hy the senate public build
ings and grounds investigating sub
committee today in a report recom
mending that steps be taken to re
cover ' many thousands of dollars al
leged by the Bub-committee to have
been expended improperly by the cor
poration. Mismanagement by the corporation,
the report as submitted to the sen
ate charged, resulted la its failure to
have ready for occupancy a single
building until almost two months after
the armistice was signed, or eight
months after the passage of the ap
propriation act.
Architects, 'it is charged, were
paid excessively for "overhead" ex
penses, the amount the sub-committee
considers recoverable from this
source being placed at $50,000.
Civil suits to recover $30,000 spent
for "extras,' 'and $16,000 charged to
sub-letting of labor by a contracting
firm also was recommended by the
committee.
Regularity of a loan for a half mil
lion dollars made to the Springfield
Consolidated Water company of Phila
delphia also was questioned.
Charges of inefficiency and bad
management were more prominent in
the report than references to over
payments. While attention is called
to the denials of the officials of the
corporation that they intended to let
contracts for more than the appropria
tion act provides, the report declared
the officials had planned .according
to the records secured by the commit
tee, the expenditure of $145,175,605,
although the amount of the appropria
tion was $100,000,000.

BLESSED KERMIT:
perhaps this means that you do not
really put all your heart and all your
head effort into your work; and that
if you are able to, it would be far
better to . think just as little as pos
sible about coming home and resolute
ly set yourself to putting your best
thought Into your work. It is an il
lustration of the old adage about
putting your hand to the plow- and
then looking back. In after life, of
course, it is always possible that at
some lime you may have to go away
for a year or two from home to do
some piece of work. If during taat
whole time you only thought day
after day of how soon you would get
home I think you would find it dif
ficult to do your best work; and may
be this feeling may be partly respon
sible for the trouble with the les
sons at scTiool.

box with Grant, who has now become
the champion middleweight wrestler
of the United States. Yesterday
afternoon we had Professor Yamash-
ita up here to wrestle with Grant.;
It was very interesting, but of course
jiu jitsu and our wrestling are so far
apart that it is difficult to make any
comparison between them. Wrest
ling is simply a sport with rules al
most as conventional as those of ten
nis, while jiu . jitsu is really meant
for practice, in killing" or disabling
our adversary. In consequence, Grant
did not know what to do except to
put Yamashita on his back, and Ya
mashita was perfectly content to be
on his back. Inside of a minute Ya
mashita had choked Grant, and in-
side of two minutes more he got an
elbow hold on him that would have
enabled him to break his arm; so that
there Is no question but that he could
have put Grant out. So far this made
it evident that the jiu jitsu man
could handle the ordinary wrestler.
But Grant, in the actual wrestling
and throwing was about as good as
the I Japanese, and he was so much
stronger . that, he evidently hurt and
wore out the Japanese. With a little
practice in'the art I am sure that one!
of our big wrestlers or boxers, simply 1
because of his great superior strength
would be able to kill any of those
Japanese, who. though very good men
for their inches and pounds, are al
together too small to hold their own
against big, powerful quick men who
are well trained.

DEAR KERMIT:
Poor John Hay has been pretty
sick. He Is going away to try to
pick up his health by a sea voyage
and rest. I earnestly hope he suc
ceeds, not only because of my great
personal fondness for ' him, but be
cause from the standpoint of the na
tion it would be very difficult to re
place him. Every Sunday on my way
home from church I have been ac
customed to stop in and see him.
The conversation with him was al
ways delightful and during these Sun
day morning talks we often decided
important questions of public policy.
I paid a scuttling visit to New
I hope you had as successful a trip
in Florida as I have had in Texas and
Oklahoma. The first six days were
of the usual Presidential tour type,
but much more pleasant than ordinar-
being a candidate entails. However,
both in Kentucky, and especially iu
Texas, 1 was received with a warmth
and heartiness that surprised me,
while the Rough Riders' reunion at
San Antonio was delightful in every
way.
Then came the five days' wolf hunt
ing in Oklahoma, and this was un
alloyed pleasure, evcept for my un-
easiness about Auntie Bye and poor
little Sheffield. General Young, Dr.
Lambers and Roly Fortescue were
each in his own way just the nicest
companions imaginable, my Texas
hosts were too kind and friendly and
open-hearted for anything. I want
to have the whole party up at Wash
ington next winter. The party got
seventeen wolves, three coons, and
any number of rattlesnakes. I was
in at the death of eleven wolves. The
other six wolves were killed by mem
bers of the party, who were off with
bunches of dogs in some place where
I was not. I never took part m a

r
From across every sea and land have come thousands of
grateful letters to the Ilorlick offices, paying tribyte to
Horlick's Malted Milk. Mothers of contented babies, j
soldiers after a campaign, explorers back from the ice

invalids and the aged all tell ui the different needs that
Horlick's has filled.
Horlick's has proved itself to be the ideal food for every
age of Shakespeare's Seven. It is so complete in itself a
to contain ever' element of nutrition necessary to sustain
life even of'the most robust - and yet it is readily digest

L
THE BIG ISSUE IN THE I. W. W. TRIAL
THE perpetuity of our social, political and civic institutions, ana
all that this republic has stood for in blazing the way for free
peoples is the issue underlying the trial of thirty-three Indus
trial Workers of the Wprld in the federal court in Kansas City,
Kansas. From the standpoint of the public this issue over-shadows
the question immediately before the court of the guilt or innocence
of the defendants. For the evidence introduced by Fred Robertson,
United States district attorney, directing the government's case,
covers the organized effort of sixty thousand members of the I. W. w.
to hamper the prosecution of the war and to break down the principles
and hopes of the republic "without regard to rigiu or wiong.''
The government has spent a week in introducing pamphlets,
newspapers and song books, literally by the thousands, as evidence
of the organization's propaganda in opposing the war and the se
lective draft, and in urging the practice of sabotage in the wheat
fields and oil belts to curtail the nation's food and fuel supply In
the crisis. The literature offered bears directly on the government's
' allegations that the 1. W. W. Is a revolutionary group committed to
a policy of a world wide "One Big Union", which can happen, the
I. W. W. writers say, only when the present institutions of govern
ment are overthrown and there is no employer or employee in our
industrial system.
To accomplish the destruction of the established institutions or
civilization the evidence indicates the I. W. W. have developed a
propaganda to promote direct action the seizure of property. This
propaganda is embodied in songs and writings celebrating the
"wooden shoe," the emblem of sabotage.
The election by Mr. Robertson to croutlen the issue in the trial
of the defendants arrested by government agents in raids on local
I. W. W. headquarters in the oil belt causes the Kansas case to as
sume proportions that no similar proceedings have gained. And the
move i3 having its effect on the "Wobblies," as members of the or
ganization are known. In the I. W. W. trial at Chicago, which re
sulted in long prison sentences for "Big Bill" Haywood, leader or
the American group, and his associates, members of the organization,
in giving testimony admitted with almost boastful candor their, con
nection with the group. Hut such members and many of them are
being used by the government in presenting the case of Americanism
take refuge in the present trial behind the constitutional safe
guard that no person may be forced to give incriminating testimony
against himself.
Regardless of the outcome of these particular cases now on trial
the government has succeeded in presenting ample evidence that the
nation has to ileal with an organization which recognizes no law but
its own creed and which regards Americanism as nothing but a challenge.
GERMAN TEARS
GERMANY is weeping again. She has wept many rimes since1 the
armistice. She will weep still more in the future. For, by her
tears she hopes to dissolve the close association of America
and the Allies.
If the separation comes, Germany's future course of action will
be clear. Preparation lor revenge can be satelv begun. All of Ger
many's plans for revenge depend on America's future attitude to
ward the war-proven democracies of Europe
lift if become known that America is indifferent to her' former
comrades in arms, and the junkers and pan-Germans will soon be
back into power. They are best tilted to direct a policy of revenge.
Once America drops out, they will drop in.
So, Germany weeps over the protocol to the peace treaty. A
protocol is a treaty's postcript. So frequently do treaties have post
scripts that the word protocol has been adopted to describe the in
strument. Yet, Germany bemoans the postscript to the treaty or
poice as if the allies threatened her with a new torture instrument.
Often since the last shot of the war have the Germans appealed
for compassion. Only by arousing pity cai the fallen monster ot
Prussion militarism hope to rise again. That is what Germany
means by compassion.
America is far removed from contact with Germany. America
is not familiar with many of Europe's complex problem. Most of
America's attention is necessarily fixed on affairs at home. There
fore, the Germans hope to wring leniency from America, be it by
bewailing a protocol or by whatever wilt serve to draw German
tears.
CHRISTMAS CLUBS
IT shows the Power of Thrift.
About 3500 banks throughout the country the past week dis
tributed more than $100,000,000 of Christmas Club funds to U,
000,000 club members.
For 50 weeks members have paid in small sums steadily and
now will get It back, plus interest.
Eight or ten years ago this form of saving was unknown, to
day it is tremendous. Tomorrow, bankers tell us. it will be stupen
dous. You start an account, independent of jour regular saving ac
count, with a penny, a nickel, or a dime. Each wek the deposit
doubles. Even so it is haid'y noticed, it Is so smaU. alter the
year has swiftly rolled around, the result is surprising.
It insures the kiddies a very, very merry Christmas.
The idea should be extended. Instead of three minions of mem
bers, there should be a hundred million, and then the distributions
will be more like $3,000,000,000, a tidy sum for the holiday season
what?
We are a wasteful people. The coal shortage wouldn't bother
us if we had possessed sufficient sense to can all the senatorial hot
air that has been generated since the signing of the armistice.
' government has saved over 45 million by purchasing its own
bonds. It could save even more by purchasing some of its promises.
Germany might as well aeree to the final peace terms. We still
have some of that force-tolieiitinost, for al! our seeming benevolence.
Courtesy lo strangers is a mark of good breeding. Courtesy to
home folks too often is a sign that there is company in the hmise.
Another reason why a man loves his old shoes is because he
knows that new ones will put an awful crimp in his pocket-book.
In ihe old days when school teaching was considered a career,
one could buy an overcoat with a month's salary.

FROM SUN TO SUN THE ONCE OVER
Chesterfield Webb, tobacco representative, who is a frequent visitor to
Bisbee has lost his faith in humanity almost. Webb decided to liven up
trade Wednesday by giving awcy a popular brand of cfgarette free, gratis,
for nothing, without equivalent financial emolument in return. He set him
self up in a main street cigar store, and for every package of the cigarettes
purchased, he gave away a package. Business was brisk, and Webb beam
ingly extrolled the meritj of his cigarettes 10 each lucky customer who ap
peared with 20 cents and took away 40 cents worth of ihe brain capsules.
But soon business passed the stage of mere briskness, and the vicinity of
Webb's cigar counter took on the appearance of a mob scene. Webb passed
out cigarettes, two packages for the price of one. so rapidly that he had
neither time nor breath to even explain why he was doing so. Finally he
got suspicious. .
"That fellow never had a whole dime of his own at one time in his
life," meditated Webb, as a youth he knew put down 20 cents and took his
two packages. "I'm being jobbed."
Hastily .calling off business Jor the day, he stalked his latest customer
up Main street, and Baw the youth disappear into the establishment, of O. S.
Fieuch. Webb entered also, and saw French chuckingjy piling up packs
of the free cigarettes into neat piles, which he transferred t the shelves
on which, he keeps his tobacce stock.
"Let's see 48, 49, GO, 51 " French was counting, as he sorted out the
packages.
"Stung!" groaned Webb gloomingly, as he backed softly out cf the
door. "And he II have the cast-iron nerve to deduct just that many packages
of cigarettes from the next order he gives me!"

Thirty students enjoyed a dance
and banquet given by the members
of the Senior classes C and B to the
graduating class "Wednesday night at
the Y. W. C. A. The students danced
nntil 10.30 at which time they ad
journed to the cafeteria where re
freshments were served. The re
gfreshmehts oonsisted of salad, sand
wiches, chocolate, and ice cream in
the colors of the graduating class
blue and gold.
Both the reception room and the
cafeteria were decorated in blue ana
gold with branches of mistletoe scat
tered about.
One or the enjoyable features of the
evening was an oriental dance given
by Miss Alice Reese and accompanied
on the piano by Miss Helen AIU1011.
Miss Reese showed great ability ana
was encored several times. Anothoi
feature of the evening's program was
a . reading by Jeanette Newman or
some very clever and amusing class
"statistics."
As the Senior class will, which
was to have been read at the class
day exercises, was lost in the fire,
the hosts of the evening donated a
will and presented every member of
the graduating class with some token
by which to remember the school.
Gerard Downs, who acted as the
toastmaster of the evening, called
upon many of members of the gradu
ating class and upon E. Q. Snider and
Miss Hattie Malam for speeches. The
general theme of mosrt of the speeches
was ably expressed by Miss Helen
Allison when she said that "like a
friend or good health, one never
misses the school until it is gone."
Pecker and Lindsay furnished the
music for the evening's dancing.
SMILE WITH US
A big general assembly, probably

this afternoon at 1:15 o'clock at the
Presbyterian church. At this time
the athletic letters and the gold B

officers will also be installed and the
quarterly report cards be given out.
A program has been prepared for the
afternoon and a good time is expect
ed. As a part of the program the
Misses Jeanette Newman and Helen
McDonald vi'l Sve readings and Mr.
James Scott will give a tenor solo.
The school orchestra will render sev
eral selections and it is probable the
graduating class will give some of the
stunts from their class day exercises.

The old story of "Wolf-wolf!" and its moral are being brought home to
Eisbee, in that the fire whistle impudently and insistently takes it upon it
self to break loose now and then and blast out on a little blow-out. Bisbee
ans are going to get so used to hearing those long.drawn out shrieks that
they'll be accepting them as a part of their day. Wednesday afternoon the
whistle broke mooring again and the firemen had to cut off its air supply
to quell it.
" ' ' "' ' - : o-
Of course, Wednesday was December 17 and it could be that the whistle
wanted to horn in on the last doings. Maybe the fire whistle thought it was
Gabriel's W. K. trumpet.
. o :
Speaking of that scheduled world exit we might bet that the astronomer
who predicted such dire events for Wednesday must have forgotten the
league of nations is supposed to save everything.
o
The only end we noticed Wednesday was the end of an ordinary day.

The end of the world can't worry the crowd that'll watch street workers.
And it's never too cold for them, either.

A dispatch from New York says eggs diopped from 89 to 78 cents a

From Brewery Gulch comes the story about the new-timer who bought
a ticket from old timer to see the end of the world. Late Wednesday even
ing when the end was noi forthcoming N. T. complained to O. T., whereupon
O. T. gave N. T. a rain check.
o
We bet Prolessoi Porta, guilty savant, got a cut on the sale of that ticket.

with invitations to let creative imagin

Mrs. Partner's body is made of two
fat raisins thrust on a toothpick. Two

her anus and hands; lor a face she
claims a smaller raisin. The gallant

It's a mute question whether this
horse is a pacer or trotter. At any
rate he has good-sized feet or
halves of raisins. His head, too, is
large, almost as large as cither of the
raisins which form the body. His
tail, strange to say, sticks out very
stiffly probably the latest style for
saddle horses.

The next man who races Johnny
Meyer in the boxing ring is in for an
unpleasant time. As a result of a new
disaster which overtook him yesterday
Johnny is mad enough to chew nails
and he is determined to break his
hoodoo on the anatomy of the next
artist of the padded mitt who crawls
through the ropes with him.
Recently Meyer was matched for a
ten-round main event with Happy
Woods, the old Pueblo slugger. But
Happyy's eyes went bad, was the re
port from Tucson and Danny Kramer
and Ralph Lincoln were substituted,
while Meyer was left holding the
sack. Then he was matched to meet
Frenchie Desmarais in a six-round
semi-final to the Talmer-Loughrey
bout in Warren Park on Christmas
day, only to receive word from Doug
las yesterday that Desmarais is leav
ing to take a job "somewhere in
Mexico," and will be unable to fill
his engagement.
Promoter O. S. French is keeping
the wires hot to find a suitable op
ponent for Meyer, and has Kid Wal
thour and Ralph de Mott in line. It is
very probable that Meyer will face one
of these on Christmas day. 8he match
will be definitely arranged today.
Interest continues keen in the match
between ' Kid Palmer, welterweight
champion of the United States army,
and Frank Loughrey. Loughrey is
working out daily on the roaa and in
the K. of C. hall with Walter Cald
well, the New Mexico lightweight, and
will work with Kid George, Caldwell's
manager, after Saturday ,on which day
Caldwell goes to AlbuqJerque.
Kid Palmer will come up from
Douglas Monday to complete his train-!
ing in Bisbee, giving the local fans j
three days in which 'to watch him
work out. A big crowd is anticipated
from Douglas to see their favorite in
action.
Walter Caldwell, the New Mexico
middleweight, who won a decision
over Kid George, the veteran San
Francisco boxer, in the November
main event, leaves tomorrow for Al
buquerque, where he will meet Den
ver O'Brien in a ten round bout on
New Year's day. The men will weigh
in at 158 pounds. !
Fred (Kid) G-eorge, who is now;
Caldwell's manager, will remain be
hind to put the finishing touches on
Frank Loughrey's training for his
Christmas Day bout here with Kid
Palmer. George also will handle
Loughrey from his corner during the
bout. , !

The Crow's Lesson
Nancy was making her daisy chain in the meadow while
Nick was playing scarecrow in the cornfield. He was stand
ing quite still in the old battered hat and coat and Nancy
would never have known the difference is she hadn't seen
Scarecrow running toward the barn a few minutes before.
All at once a great flock of crows that had been scolding
and chattering at the edge of the woods came over the field
like an immense black cloud and settled on the tall shocks
of corn. ' 1 ' ' ' ' ' t
But to Nancy's surprise Nick did not make a sign that
he saw them. He might have been the Scarecrow himself,
is so still There he stood, his old hat set rakishly on
one side, his coat-tails flopping in the wind, and the stick
over his shoulder.'
"Caw, caw, caw! cried
In iin -n n nSKiigwW ft"5, 11 - - '
arms, on his stick, and on his hat.
And they came and sat impudently all over him, on his
still thicker around him. "We used to be afraid of you, Mr.
Man with the gun, but we're not any more. We know you
can't do anything. Caw, caw!" And they came and sat im
pudently all over him, on his arms, on his stick, and on his
hat. One bold old fellow began even to pick at Nick's eyes.
Then - "
That was just what Nick was waiting for. He suddenly
let his stick fly around him in every direction so fast the
crows thought the world was coming to an end. They
couldn't get away, it seemed, but just had to take the terrible
blows. They certainly deserved their punishment, too. They
were so bruised and sore they could scarcely fly back to the
woods. i ...
But they didn't stop there. They had had too good a
lesson. They were so frightened that they kept on and or
and never came back to steal Farmer Smith's corn again. They
may be flying yet. .

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Dec. 18. An unex
pected reversal in British exchange
and the attitude assumed by organized
labor in connection with the return
of the railroads caused today's dull
stock market to yield some of the
ground gained during the, previous
session.
The decline in bills on London,
which fell about 13 cents below yes
terday's rally, was attributed in some
quarters to the decision of the British
court removing the ban on imports
into England. This theory found few
supporters among bangers and ex
change dealers, who regarded the re
cent recovery as a natural rebound
from excessive pressure.
Rails .especially low grade issues,
were depressed one to five points, bet
some of this loss was recovered later
on the support accorded Investment
shares of the division.
Call loans ruled at 6 per cent, the
lowest rate of the week, but it was
generally understood that the banks
would not release time funds, except J
in moderate amounts for the balance :
of the year.
The stack market became almost
stagnant after the first hour, with al-1
ternate rallies and declines from thei
irregular opening. Oils, majors and
steels provided the chief elements of
uncertainty. Metals and sugars were
among the few sustaining features.
Sales amounted to 700,000 shares
The feature of the bond market was
the activity of convertible or specula
tive railway issues.
COTTON MARKET
NEW YORK., Dec. 18. Cotton clos
ed barely steady at a decline of 1
point on December and 26 to 57 points
net lower on later months.
MINERAL MARKET
NEW YORK, Dec. 18. Bar silver,
$1.34; others unchanged.

The Warren District Luncheon dub
held a regular meeting in the Com
mercial clubroom yesterday. Routine
I business was taken up by the organi
j zation, after which the members heard
J. J. Dugal's report of the United
American's convention in Phoenix re
cently, to which he was a delegate.
Mr. Dugal outlined the purpose of
the organization and told how it had
been organized from middle west as
sociations formed for the sole pur
pose of propagating Americanism in
live in this country, the speaker ex
English to everybody who cvooses to
live in this country. The speaker ex
plained, is one of the organizations
major objects in the belief that the
first essential to making Americans of
immigrants is have them learn
the language of the country.
In its plan to instil patriotism and
the ideals of Americans in all people
in this country the organization rec
ognizes no group, but opposes every
thing unAmerican, will endeavor to
block the movements of those ene
mies within the nation and will do
everything in its power . to protect
America for Americans, Mr. Dugal
said. '
The plans of the United Americans
are to organize chapters in every com
munity and to give civilians a chance
to accomplish, through the association
what the ex-soldiers are doing through
the" American Legion. There will be
national, state and city units of the
organization.
A mass meeting in this district for"
the purpose of effecting a local branch
of the United Americans probably will
be held within the next few wetks.
The federal road bureau in Denver
has approved the federal aid project
in this county, according to word re

dock, who has notified the county offi

that this project, the money for which
will be forthcoming as soon as the
county road commission can complete
a contract with the state engineer,
provides for assistance from the gov
ernment on the highway from Douglas

aid money must be matched by coun
ty expenditure on roads, which prob
ably cannot be done in less than two
years. :
The allotment of the federal money
