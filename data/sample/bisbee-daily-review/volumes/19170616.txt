ALL STEEL
All Vessels Under Construe
tion In American Yards;
Will Be Immediately Con-;
nscated By Government. '
(By Review Leased Wire). !
WASHINGTON, June 15.
The vast amount of;
steel merchant shipping
under construction in Ameri-;
can yards probably 2,000,
000 tons will be taken over
immediately by the govern
ment under power granted in
a provision of the w ar budget
bill signed today by President
Wilson.
The announcement was made today
at a conference of the contry's steel
ship builders with the shipping board
and its emergency fleet corporation.
Shipping now in the yards will be
hurried to completion by the Institu
tion of a system of double and triple
work'ng shifts and when the ways are
cleared of present contracts the fleet
corporation will begin contsurtioo
of its fleet of standardized. steel ves
sels. - - - t Expect Big Ootpirt.
Major General Goethals, who is
manager of the fleet corporation, told
the ship builders today that he ex
pected to turn out within the next 18
months fully 3.0O0.000 tons of steel
shipping and perhaps more. Steel
companies, he said, have agreed to
furnish steel to build 800,0('0 tons a
month.
About 1.000,000 tons of the ship
ping building in American yards or
contracted for is for British account.
This the British government has
agreed to turn over to the United
States voluntarily. The vessels, as
fast as buiit, will be chartered by the
shipping board to private operators
and perhaps in some instances to the
allied governments.
Yards Not Affected. j
The ship builders were told the .
government at this time has no in-,
tention of taking ove the ship yards
if the ship bui'.ders exert their ut
most efforts to speed construction, j
No statement was made concerning
wcodc-n ship yards, but it is under-J
stood the intention is to commandeer1
such wooden vessels building as the '
government needs.
The price of steel for the ships to
be built has not been fixed definitely,
but it is understood General Goethals
is willing to pay $90 a ton. Some
members of the shipping board who
are directors of the fleet corporation
favor a price around $80.

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, June 15. American
naval eunners have met their first de
feat in open fight with a German sub
marine. Official dispatches today an
nounced the destruction of the tank
steamship Moreni, abandoned ablaze
June 12 by her crew and armed guard
after a desperate running fight in the
war i'jne which cost the lives of four
of her crew.
Half an hour after the tanker had
been sent to the bottom her 43 sur
vivors .including all of the members of
the armed guard, were picked up with
their life boats by a passing steamer.
The German commander had set them
adrift after congratulating tiie Ameri
can skipper upon his game fight and
having the wounded men treated by
the submarine's surgeon.
Steamer Is Shelled.
The submarine began the action at
a range of 8,000 yards, four nautical
miles, while she was partly visible to
the steamer without glasses. Present
ing virtually no target herself, she
sent 200 shells at the big tanker, mak
ing many hits, while the American
gunners wasted 150 sh'Jts without
harming the speck from which the
deadly hail came.
The action of the submarine com
mander in treating his vanquished op
ponents with such .unexpected cour
tesy was the subject of much com
ment. Germany has proclaimed her
Intention to treat their armed mer
chant crews as pirates. In this case,
even the naval bluejackets and their
officer .properly prisoners of war,
were set free, along with the merchant
crew.
UNCLE SA1 PLANNING TO DRIVE
GERMAN AVIATORS OUT OF AIR
Willi
BIG BATTLE PLANE FLEET
WASHINGTON. June 13. Plans for making the United States a great
elementary training base for aviators of all the allied nations have
been formulated by the defense council's aircraft production board,
which believes this country can supply only machines suited for train
ing work for some months to come, but can take care of the needs of all the
allies In that respect.
French and British plants under the plan would be released for the manu
facture of battle craft exclusively while American plants are developing a
battle type which by next spring probably would give a formidable and stead
ily increasing addition to the French and British supplies.
The plan to bring all allied student aviators to the United States for ele
mentary training is an outgrowth of the enormous expansion of the govern
ment's aircraft policy. The original program called only for machines enough
to equip American land and naval forces at a cost of about $75,000,000. Tin;
aircraft production board now .has mapped out a campaign, however, that
means an initial appropriation of about $000,000,000 and an eventual expendi
ture of probably $1,000,000,000.
Brigadier Genera! Squier. in charge of army aviation made it clear today
that the war department stands back of this campaign which he said was
necessary "to put the Yankee punch into the war."
While existing American plants are said to be able to supply only 10 per
cent of the number of machines wanted, arrangements have been made for
the conversion of numerous automobile and other factories for aindani'
building. M "T",
If European aviators are sent to the United States for elementary train
ing, the number of training fields w ill be Increased to a score or more and ad
ditional universities would be designated to give technical aviation courses.
"Our plans contemplate nothing less than driving the German fliers out
of the air and maintaining a constant raiding patrol over their territory for
fifty miles back of the fighting line." said Chairman Howard 10. Coffin, of the
board In a statement tonight. "If we carry through our program to produce
the thousands of machines planned, the permanent supremacy of tJie allies
in the air is assured."
Mr. Coffin's statement was prompted by a report from Paris that Ger
many expected to put 3,500 additional planes at the front by next spring.

from an estimated distance of 8.000
yards at 4 o'clock. The steamer,
which was armed and carried a gun
crew, returned the sh'Jts and attempt

and smooth sea. The submarine was
hardly visible. After 150 .shots in re

ONLY THREE RESERVE DISTRICTS
FAIL TO SUBSCRIBE IHI
AMOUNTS ALLOTTED TO THEM
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jane 1 5. The American people have re
sponded to the government's call for funds to finance the
war with an over-subscription to the $2,000,000,000
Liberty Loan of proportions so huge that officials are buried
beneath a landslide of untabulated returns.
No man could say at 10 o'clock tonight how great had
been the nation's answer. Apparently it was overwhelming
.beyond the most sanguine hopes 6f treasury officials, though
not one of the twelve federal reserve banks, regional head
quarters of the loan, could hazard more than an estimate of its
total.
In the country's ringing answer to the call, the dominant
note was the voice of the small investor.
Secretary McAdoo Is Elated Over Result
In the absence of official figures to
night OiTicials hesitate to predict ho'-v
high the total would soar.
Eastimates from the twelve reserve
districts, some of them unofficial but!
mostly from local loan committees, in
dicated late tonight that the siibscrip-.
tions might reach the total of $'J.S6J,- j
SOO.01'0. These estimates, which werei
no' vouched for as authorative at the'
treasury department were as follows:
Huge Subscriptions. !
New Yf.rk. $1,200,000,000 with the'
certainty that the offering would far'
exceed $1,000,000,000. j
Boston. $2fin.:;on.000 (official figures;
:p to 3 p. in.) '
Philadelphia. $20.00O.00O. The com
pilation at 2 p. m. was $23.000.0'0.
Cleveland. $2S4.00o.0i0. as estimat
ed ty the chairman of the local com
mittee after a careful survey of the en
tire district.
Richmond, more than $100,000,000.
Atlanta, $50,000,000 estimated with
$3S.f00 000.000 tabulated.
Chicago, $323,000,000 with $290,000.
P00 tabulated at 9 p. m.
St. Louis. $S1.5i'0.000. (estimated up
on returns to the federal reserve
bank). !
Kansas City. $90,000,000. estimated
by the federal reserve bank.
Minneapolis. $ti2.o ;0.ooo, estimate of
of the federal reserve bank.
Dallas. $17,000,000. estimated by the
federal reserve bank.
Pan Franersco, $160.000. Ot'O estimat
ed by the federal reserve bank. Tab
ulations at 4:"0 p. m. were $150,000,
0W. Three Districts Fail.
On the face of these estimates it
appeared unlikely that the total
would fall below $2.i;oo.00rt.(0. It al
so appeared that three reserve dis
tricts. Atlanta. Kansas City and Min
neapolis would fall below their mini
mum allotment.
Secretary McAdoo announced tho
oversubscription shortly after the
closing of the books in the east.
"The Liberty Loan has been over
subscribed." be said. "It is impossible
to state the amount of the subscrip
tions but the figures will be given O'U
as rapidly as the returns are received
at the treasury department."
"I desire to express my deep ap
preciation of the efficient and patri
otic scrvic 4 you have rendered in
connection with the Liberty I-oan. the
success of which has been so striking
and pleasing to the country." Secre
tary McAdoo tonight telegraphed all
reserve banks. "Will you not convey
to the Liberty Loan coniml'tees of
your district, to tho banks, and to all
other organizations which have co
operated with you in this great Liber
ty Loan enterprise the assurance of
my warm appreciation as well as my
sincere thanks.

AUTHORITIES BAFFLED
BY ATTEMPT TO BLOW
UP TOMBSTONE HOUSE
Bomb Is Hurled At Home of
Sam Watt And John Hart
man, But Explodes In Air
Before Hitting Building.
(Special Dispatch to The Review.)
Tombstone, June 15. No clue has
yet been obtained to the parties who
on Tuesday morning tried to blow up
the house occupied by Sam Watt and
John Hartnian, in the lower part ot
town. Hartnian arose from bed about
1 Vclock and had just passed through
the kitchen door to the' outside when
there was a terrific explosion. He felt
the rush of air as it passed him anu
he thought that there was someone in
the house who had shot at him. He
went around to the front part of tue
house and called to Watt, whom he
had left in bed. They secured their
guns and made a search of the kilcuen
but could find no trace of any one in
the builaing. They next examined the
window to see it the shot had been
fired through toe window, out couiu
not find any bullet hole in the screen.
They then dicided to let the matter
go until dayligut, when they made a
further examination and found about
a foot of burnt fuse near the kitchen
window and found where the powder
had hit the window. The explosion oc
curred in the air, which showed that
the party who threw the explosive had
it timed to explode about the time that
it hit the floor on the inside of the
bouse. They evidently did not notice
that there was a screen on the win
dow. Watt, who was still in bed, was
stunned by the explosion but has suf
fered no serious consequences there
from. He could plainly smell the giant
powder that was used as he has had
considerable experience in the use
thereof. Had the powder exploded in
the building both he and Kartman
would have been in danger of being se
riously wounded.
Only perhaps for the fact that the
charge exploded while in tae air ac
counts l'jr the building not having
been damaged. A thorough investiga
tion is being made in an attempt to
bring the would-be murderer to book.
Hartnian says he cannot figure why
anyone should want to destroy either
his home or assassinate him, as he iias
no known enemies and is at a loss to
figure 'out the reason they should at
tempt to use the dynamite. It is not
expected another attempt will be
made to carry out the deed, but should
the bomb throwers try to return they
will meet with proper reception.

BELGIUM IS PRAISED
BY ARTHUR BALFOUR
LONDON. June 15. Arthur J. Ual
four, foreign secretary, today signal
ized his first public appearance since
he returned from the United States by
a speech at the second annual meet
ing of the nat.'jnal committee for le
lief in Belgium at the Mansion house.
In his address Mr. Balfour advised
every one to read President Wilson's
flag day address, published in this
morning's papers, because of its rela
tion to Germany's treatment of Bel
gium. "If you have not already read Presi
dent Wilson's speech," said Mr. Bal
four, "I strongly advise j'ju to do so,
and at the same time to bear in mind
Germany's action and policy in Bel
gium. In it you will find justification
of this great alliance among all na
tions who love liberty against the
monstrous tyranny and coercion with
which the civilized world is threat
ened if we submit to an inclusive and
ineffective peace.
"The one true remedy for the wi'.ing!--of
Belgium is the defeat of Germany."
The action of the I'nited States in
taking over the whole cost of the re
lief of Belgium waB greeted with loud

COUNTY SEAT REMOVAL
QUESTION IS DELAYED
BY RESTRAINING ORDER
Temporary Writ of Prohibi
tion Ordering Supervisors
Not To Call Ejection Issued
By Santa Cruz Judge.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
TUCSON, June 15. Judge W. A.
O'Connor, of Santa Cruz county, has
issued a temporary writ of prohibition
against the board of supervisors of Co
chise county restraining them from
calling an election l'jr removal of the
county seat from Tombstone, it was
learned from the judge, who left Tuc
son today for Nogales.
He has ordered the board to show
cause on June 30 why the writ should
not be made permanent.
That date was set in order that the
proceeding might n'jt delay the calling
of the election should it be dismissed.
The board has July 2 as a date on
which to determine w hether an elec
tion shall be called.
The petition for a writ of prohibition
was presented to Judge O'Connor by
Attorney O. Gibson, of Tombstone, pre
sumably representing the citizens of
that town. The grounds named are
that the statute providing for county
seat removal elections is unconstitu
tional in that it refers solely to incor
porated cities and towns and there are
some cVmnties. such as Mohave, which
have no incorporated municipalities,
and which would consequently be de
barred from holding such elections.
Judge O'Connor is sitting in the case
because Judge Lockwood is away.

lowest amount, to $500.
These an.'junts w ill be payable eith
er cash or in quartcly installments.
Chairman Notman read a telegram
from the secretary of the Red Cross
war council which stated that Tucson
had the honor of being the first city
in America to complete its apportion
ment of $25,000.
The secretary suggested that Bis
bee challenge Tucson for the amount
raised, which the committee decided
to d'J, and starting Monday morning, a
seven-day campaign will be waged
among the residents of the Warren
District Reports on the progress of
the teams will be made at noon each

ARE FINALLY NABBED
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, June 15. Emma Gold
man, editor of "Mother Earth," and
Alexander Berkman, editor of "The
Elast," widely known as anachist3,
were locked up in the Tombs tonight
on a complaint charging them with
engaging in a conspiracy to induce
men of military age not to register un
der the select draft law.
The arrests were made in a raid on
the headquarters of the No-Conscription
League. The officers of the two
pul lications are located in the same
building.
Neither Miss Goldman nor Berk
man seemed perturbed at their arrest.
The former was smiling when she was
led to her cell. She previously had
served a term in the city penitentiary
for inciting to riot during the cloak
makers' strike. .
Berkman who fell downs-air3 nnd

deputy marshals who had him in cus

They will be given a hearing tomor

young men of military age not to reg

evidence against them was not dis

Organized Baseball j
Suit Is Dismissed
i
(By Review Leased Wire). i
PHILADELPHIA, June 15. The J
Baltimore club of the delunct Federal
league today withdrew its anti-trust
damage suit against organized base
ball. This is the1 second time within
two years that a legal action bijuge.t
lu a United States court involving the
question of whether organized baseball
as operated under the national agree
ment is a trust has been withdrawn
before a decision had been given.
The first suit was brought in the
federal court in Chicago in January,
1915, and was withdrawn when the
American and National leagues signed
a peace agreement with representa
tives of the Federal league in Decem
ber of the same year.
The action of the Baltimore club in
dt'jpping the suit today was taken,
counsel said, because it was convinced
that the "representatives of organized
baseball" had not entered into a con
spiracy to destroy the busine'-j of the
Baltimore club.
The court was informed there had
been no settlement out of court.

CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, June 15. Estimates that
the iota! tioniestic production of wheat
for 1917 wuold he nearly 30,000.000
bushels in advance of the government
report for June, did a good deal today
to bring about declines in the wheat
market. Quotations closed steady 2
to 4 cents net lower.
Corn gained to 1.
' The outcome in provisions was 3 to
5 cents lower.
Sentiment became much more pro
nounced after the issuance of a defi
nite statement by a leading authority
that the outlook was for a yield of
685,000,000 as against 656.000.000 bush
els suggested by the government. Gold
weather likely to interfere with the
best development of corn had a bull
ish effect on that cereal. There was
but a transient bearish influence from
gossip that the condition of the crop
was- equal to a 10 year average and
that July government report would
show a prospect of the largest yield
on record. Signs of export demand
helped to lift oats.
Strength of hogs and corn upheld
provisions. Considerable selling was
done. :

From now until July first at least, the

unsettled, which taken into conjunc

THE DEEP CURRENT.
The success 61 the military registration and the Lib
erty Lean are conclusive answers for those at home and
abroad who said am- the hoar, i . 11 ericai; was uot in
this w.ir.
The public acquiesced in the registry almost unanimous
ly. Such opposition as developed was purely local, spor
adic individual. There was not a tenth of the trouble
that arose when the civil war draft was enforced no
riots, no organized hostility, no sullen resistance. The
millions to whom the law applied went to their voting
booths as readily as to a presidential election, and with
less disorder than we have ever had on a national elec
tion day.
As for the Liberty Loan, it shows the nation's willing
ness to pay as clearly as the response to selective con
scription shows its willingness to fight. It is the most
remarkable public loan in the history of this country, not
only in size but in the zeal with which It has been taken
up. The whole amount would have been over-subscribed
long ago if it had been'left to the banks. The govern
ment wisely made it not a bankers' loan but a popular
loan. The appeal was all to the comman citizen, the
small subscriber. And the way in which the general
public has taken hold everywhere has surprised the ad
ministration. AH sorts of business institutions, all sorts
of organizations, people and interests of every kind and
degree, have voluntarily devoted their best energies to
this work. The public has literally taken the huge bond
issue out of the hands of the government and sold it to
itslf.
AH this has been done without excitement For the
public is not at all excited about the war. And that is the
fact that has fooled so many observers. We were noisy
and rather hysterical about Uie Spanish war. Now we
are quiet, with the calmness of deep feeling and deter
mination. It's the shallow water that ripples and foams, and the
deep current that flows smooth. The nation is quiet not
because it is apathetic, but it is tremendously in earnest.
i
No professional ball! It 'sounds incredible, even yet
But this war makes all tilings possible.
TO USE COTTON STALKS. -
Cotton stalks that were formerly thrown away as use
less are now to be utilized in making various fiber goods.
The machinery for extracting fiber from this waste ma
terial was invented by a textile manufacturer, and is now
being tested with evidence of success in the Imperial
Valley.
Many tons of cotton stalks will now be saved and con
verted into twine, cordage and burlap. It is believed that
the pulp left can then be made into paper pulp or used
as stock feed. Tests have been made showing a high per
centage of protein in the cotton stalks. Cattle have
thrived on a diet of which this was a part.
Ramie, hemp and bean straw have also been put through
the machine and have been found to yield valuable and
abundant fiber.
The present outlook is that all the Pacific Coast needs
in paper products and burlap for cotton bales may be
supplied through the utilization of the cotton stalks
grown nearby in the valley. Acres are being planted to
ramie and hemp, too. Hitherto this fiber has been made
from jue raised in India. This brings a new industry
to the Pacific coast regian. economizes' where there has
been great waste, and helps to counteract the shortage
in the usual raw materials needs in paper manufacture.
BASEBALL IN DECLINE.
President Ban Johnson of the American League an
nounced not long ago that if the war continued until next
spring there would be no attempt to open the 1917 pen
nant season. Inasmuch as there is no present prospect
of the war ending within a year, it follows that there will
be no national baseball season next year. It will not be
surprising if all the professional leagues suspend op
eration. Things are drifting that way now. Baseball, indeed,
has not been what it used to be at any time since the big
war began. Serious-minded folk and there are suc:i
among baseball fans have felt ill at ease over patronizing
the sport while the manhood of Kurope was engaged in
sterner work. Now our own entry has emphasized the
feeling. x
We recall the British condemnation of tennis, cricket
and football after war was declared, and Kipling's scath-
JELLY WITHOUT SUGAR. '
The caption 'Jelly without sugar' is slightly misleading.
tor not even the U. S. Department of Agriculture, which
recommends the canning of fruit juices aU by themselves,
can make jelly without the admixture of sugar at some
stage of the process. But the thing which appalls bo
many housewives in canning season is that the fruit and
sugar and often the containers must be bought all at
once, that sugar goes p in price as soon as the fruits
come into market, and often the combination of circum-
stances 'makes canning too expensive to be thought of.
The Department's suggestion is that the fruit juices
be cooked, strained and canned in the usual way, using
especial care to boil them long enough so that they are
thoroughly sterilized, and that the containers and seals
should be sterile and airtight The juice must be reheat
ed after straining, and bottled hot. At a future time
sugar may be bought at the housewife's convenience, and
the jelly be completed. Also, fruits which will not jell
alone, such as pineapple and cherries, may have their
juices aaved to be made into jelly in combination with
fruits like apples, rich in pectose, which come into sea
son later on.
This plan opens up many possibilities in the way of
new and delicious fruit combinations. One objection to
jams and jellies in many families has been the high pro
portion of sugar necessary to preserve them success
fully. Keeping the juices -with no sugar at all may help
to solve many a digestive difficulty during the next
winter.

AMERICA, NOW CONFIDENT AND 6TR0NG.
At the beginning of the year the conditions and pros
pects of the United States were deplorable, says the Chi
cago Tribune. Conditions were dangerous and threat
ening.
Now we stand surely on Arm ground and face the fu
ture with assurance and confidence. The nation which
was merely rich will soon be strong. The nation which
invited attack, which was wide open to invasion and
which tempted invasion, will be strong enough to guar
antee its own security.
At the beginning of the war we had no adequite de
fenses and there was no evidence that the government
would provid them or that the people would demand them.
Governmental Indifferences rode public apathy. The peo
ple were deaf to Cassandra. Congress was controlled by
parochial politicians who were incapable of thinking In
terms of the nation and who were running the country
for the benefit of their districts.
We had all the money and none of the guns. We were
acquiring wealth and no means of protecting it We were
making the German grudge greater every day. We were
regarded as profiters in the great war, sutlers trading
with courageous peoples ad getting rich without acquir
ing either comman sense or fortitude.
The United States was in a bad way and Its prospect
was to get into a worse one. We were mortgaging the
future for present day comforts and wealth promised to
be our ruin. We should have been jumped by Germany
or Japan and found, defenseless, possessing many dollars
and no strength. '
Now we are preparing to become a dominant factor in
the world. We are raising an army which will be suffi
cient for our needs and able to accomplish any task!
given it. Successful invasion of the United States will
be Impossible so long as we adhere to the wise principles
which are being adopted for this war.
i
We are building a nevy which will return to its old rat
ing next to that of Great Britain. We are acquiring a
merchant marine which will restore the American flag
to the seas. We shall return in full to the things of which
we are proud in our traditions and history.
We shaU retain prosperity and we shall know how to
defend it We shall develop and promote trade and enjoy
the returns from it. Our domestic affairs will provide
employment and good wages for our people. A strong
nation is a prsoperous one and the prosperity will be re
flected in the living conditions of the American people.
Industries will be ambitious and busy. There will be
work for all workmen. We have changed from a condi
tion which was threatening In spite of of if not because of
its Inflated wealth to a condition which is promising
The change has come about by the decision of the gov
ernment and the people.
They had it in their power to correct themst-lves and
make the United States a confident nation. , The fear
that they could not be aroused to do this has been dis
sipated. They have done it The United States has noth
ing now to fear. It will have nothing to fear so long as
it maintains the position it has taken.
If it will keep Its army it is safe. It may then keep
its money, its ships, its trade, it may keep its factories
going and its goods traveling. Its people will be respect
ed and they will be safe. We shall not be subjected to
insult and damage on our southern frontier. We shall
be well thought of beyond our northern frontier. We
shall not find danger abroad.
We still need the establishment of a continuing mili
tary policy, but even now we are being organized for
strength and security and an American may feel the
pride Ue ought to feel In being an American.

GENEVIEVE HAMPER,
STAGE FAVORITE, AT
EAGLE THEATER TODAY
Genevieve Hamper, talented stage
star, has the leading role in a William
Fox production, "Tangled Lives,"
.shown at the Eagle this afternoon and
tonight. J. Gordon Edwards, the vet
eran director of Fox features, screened

Stuart Holmes appears again the
suave villain of yore.
Miss Hamper was born in Greenville,
Mich., and was educated in Chicago,
where she first became interested in
the drama. She played in "The Mid
night Sons" company as an extra, then
under Robert Mantell, made such
progress that she appeared in "The
Merchant of Venice," as Jessica. From
then on her rise was rapid, and since
becoming a screen player she has ap

Many bad cases of kidney trouble
result from a cold or chill. Congested
kidneys fall behind in filtering the poison-laden
bltJd and backache, head
ache, dizziness and disordered kidney
action follow. Don't neglect a cold.
L'se Doan's Kidney Tills at the first
sign of kidney trouble. Follow this
Bisbee resident's example:
Mrs. J. V. Mitchell, of 93 Young
blood Hill, says: "Doan's Kidney rills
are an old, reliable remedy and we are
seldom without them in our home. Oc
casionally when I tuke cold, it settles
on my kidneys and my back begins to
bother me. When I bend over, sharp
pains will catch me in my back. I am
also bothered by dizziness at such
times and usually fel languid and
lired. I always use Doan's when 1 am
that way. They quickly remove the
trouble and I can again go about my
housework feeling fine."

(Douglas Daily International, May 12.
1917.)
The Feather River section of North
ern California has produced in placer
gold millions upon millions of dollars,
and is still a heavy producer 'jf this
precious metal.
It is seldom that any one outside
those immediately connected with this
district have an opportunity of getting
in on any of these -Northern California
Hydraulic and Placer Properties upon
the ground floor.
The offering controlled by the Feath
er River Gold Mines company. Inc.,
have received the closest investigation
by the Corporation Commission of Ari
zona, and by many outside parties. In
cvery instance the reports received on
the 510 acres of gold-bearing gravel by j
the ab'jve upon this company's proper
tics and their management have been
most flattering and convincing.
The management is in the hands of
experienced miners. Mr. George Threl
fall, the president and general mana
ger, has had years of experience in
hydraulic and placer niining, extend
ing from Alaska to the heart of South
America, and Mr. P. J. Glasier, the ,
company superintendent, has been tn-!
gaged in practical mining for the last
15 vears. Tnerefore, the lact -that '
these two men hav the development ;
of the company's properties in hand
means that those who now invest will
receive an LVme.st and sure run for
their money.
Only a small amount of stock is be
ing offered, as the money which will
he derived from thin sale will be am
ple for placing tnis enterprise upon
a producing and paying basis. The
company might have asked for and ob
tained permission to sell a very much
larger amount of stock, but they ara
aiming only to Obtain such funds as
are actually necessary to bring the
pioperties to a producing atage.
This is no stock jobbing proposition,
but a straightforward business under
taking ,aid all investors are going to
get a square deal and every cent
which is received by the sale ol stock
will go into the properties.
Mr. P. J. Glasier is now upon the
porperty, and under the date ot May
4tlx wired as follows:
"Started work upon Concordia last
week. Getting water started in our
main ditch. It will take some days for
the water to get onto the Concordia
mine, a3 we have four feet of snow on
the ditch, but water is coming through
snow in fine shape. We are also sur
veying Concordia Mine in order to
give us the proper place to start tun
nel to get to bedrock on channel. Am
more convinced than ever that we have
a great winner, and within fcu days wej
will be taking out gold. In my 15
) ears' experience of mining in all parts
of tne I'juntry I have neer si on any j
properties that have the merits that
these properties have. The Concordia
Mine alone lias got the earmarks of.
making one of the largest placer mines
in Northern California. Signed, P. J.
Glasier."

orously and effectively attacked in
"The Single Code," a startling five-reel
morality drama; product of the David j
H'jrsley studios, starring Crane Wil
bur, at the Orpheum today and tomor
row. This play is the second of a J
series of five Horsley-Mutual features
released by the Mutual Film corpora-1

This world problem has been more '
widely discussed in the editorial col-1
umns of American newspapers and in
the pages of American magazines than
any other bel'jre the public, within the
last ten years, and sentiment with re
gard to the equalizing of moral respon
sibility as between the sexes compel
ling the man to share equally with the
woman social ignominy that results
from offen8e againSt the n,0ral COde'
has undergone a vital change within
me Period wmed
The Single Code" is frankly intend
ed to whip the social founder into an
appreciation of his moral responsibil
ity, and Mr. Wilbur's forceful acting
lu the leading role, tnat of Hugh Car
rington, goes far to insure achieve
ment of this purpose.
The characterization Is one that
brings out in striking fashion society's
careless acceptance 'of the male round
er as a matrimonial eligible the keen
competition between ambitious moth
ers of marriageable daughters to
throw them into the arms of men
I whose position and wealth assure their
wives social and financial position,
while risking their souls and bodies
through the dissolute lives these men
have led.
Crane Wilbur portrays the husband
of this type faultlessly .and Florence
Printy, as "the wife with a secret of
her own," admirably interprets the
character.
