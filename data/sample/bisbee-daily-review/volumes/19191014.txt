CONFERENCE
TO THRESH
OUT STRIKE
Today's Session Will Be De
voted to Settling Question
of Intervention in the Steel
Controversy: Committee
Refuses to Recommend
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. Labor's
resolution proposing intervention in
the steel strike will come before the
national industrial conference with
out recommendation from the cen
tral committee, as the first order of
business tomorrow, it was learned
authoritatively tonight.
Tho committee devoted a small por
tion of an all-day session to consider
ation of an arbitration solution. Ow
ing to the opposition of the majority
of the five members of the employers'
group in the committee, a favorable
report could not be obtained and the
resolution will follow the only other
possible course open reference to
the general conference.
Members of the conference ex
pressed the opinion tonight that the
proposal will meet the same fate at
the hands of the conference tomor
row. A strong majority of the em
ployers' group is known to oppose
intervention in the strike and action
can be taften only with the approval
of each of the three groups, voting
separately. Delegates entertained
but little doubt that more than half
of the public representatives will
vote for the resolution, but pointed
out that in the employers' group only
the agricultural representatives look
with favor on the arbitration plan.
Out of deference to their fellow
member. Judge Elbert H. Gary, chair
man of the board of the "United States
Steel corporation, representatives of
the public have never discussed the
steel strike in their group meetings,
and it probably will be necessarv for
the grouD to take advantage of the
twenty-minute recess allowed under
the rules to caucus prior to casting
the unit vote on the arbitration reso
lution.
The central committee is reported
t,- havo made substantial progress to
day Is devlsine a method of procedure
for "putting all the members of the
confeernce to work." A number of
sub-committees for consideration of
specific problems, toeether with a
nollcy for the assignment of resolu
tions to those committees, will be
recommended to the conference to-
pi "TOW.
Under this arrangement it appears
nrohable that conflicting views on
fundamental issues; such as the onen
hon. collective bargaining and the
eibt-hour day. will be threshed out
and a hpsia for aereement reached in
select committees.

NEW YORK, Oct. 13. Cooperation
ihv lnhor in tho manas"ement of indus
try and profit-sharing were advocated
as means of preventing the American
form of government from committing
suicide, by Nicholas Murray Butler,
president of Columbia University, in
an address tonight before the Institute
of Arts and Science of the university.
"Must the American form of govern
ment commit suicide in order to give
to industry better and more satisfac
tory organization?" asked Dr. Butler.
The question, he added, answered it
self, for "if the American form of gov
ernment commits suicide it will make
no difference to anyone whether in
dustry is better organized or not.
Chaos will have come again.
"When Industry is viewed as a co
operative enterprise In production, it
follows that those who work with their
hands, like those who worked with
their brains and those who work with
their savings are entitled to take part
In the organization and direction of
the industry and to have a voice in
determining the conditions under
which their cooperation shall be giv
en and continued:
"The strike." he continued. "Is at
best not a method of reasonableness,
but a weapon of industrial war and it
ought in time to become obsolete with
thA submarine and the Bie Bertha."
Referring to the steel strike, Mr.
Butler said:
"The ultimatums of Mr. Fitzoatrick
and Mr. Foster were a 'well planned
attack on the principles tipon which
the American people have rested their
eovernment. their civilization and
their life.' The war that, has ben or
ganized bv Mr. Fitzpatrick and Mr.
Foster and the similar wars that were
organized In Great Britain by Mr.
Smilley and Mr. Thomas are many
times more dangerous than the Aus
trian ultimatums to Serbia or the Ger
man invasion of Belgium."

Curzon of Kedleston, president of the

In addition all of the foreign am

prominent in various walks of civil

present. Premier Venizelos of Greece,
Mr. Asquith, Sir John Clyne and Lord
Robert Cecil were among the princi

Premier Lloyd George sent a mes
sage to the meeting, saying:
"Civilization cannot longer afford
to squander its time and treasure on
the destruction of its own handiwork.
The allied governments are pledged
to the league's noble ideals. I appeal
to my fellow countrymen to support
international order and good will."
King George sent the following
letter to Lord Robert Cecil:
"We have won the war. That is a
great achievement; but it is not
enough. We fought to gain a lasting
peace, and it is our supreme duty to
take every measure to secure it.
"For that, nothing is more essen
tial than a strong and enduring league
of nations. Every day makes this
clearer. The covenant of Paris is a
good foundation. The nature and
strength of the structure to build
upon this must depend on the earnest
ness, and "sincerity " of popular sup

WASHINGTON, Oct. 13. Another
three-hour attack on the Shantung
provision by Senator Norris, Republi
can of Nebraska, and a ten-minute
speech. of the same character by Sena
tor Borah, Republian of Idaho, consti
tuted the sum of the senate's progress
today in its consideration of the peace
treaty.
Tomorrow the speech making will
continue, and although some of the
leaders think a vote on the Shantung
amendment may be reached Wednes
day, others are not so optimistic.
. Senator Norris, who had occupied
most of two previous sessions with his
Shantung speech, concluded today af
ter again assailing the accuracy of
statements made by President iWlson
statements made by President Wilson
that after the president had acknowl
edged he was wrong he had gone on
misstating the facts about Shantung.
Senator Borah also declared Mr. Wil
son had been mistaken in his state
ment that John Hay was secretary of
state when the German rights in Shan
tung were acquired."
Quoting from the reports of mis
sionaries in regard to conditions in
Korf a. Senator Norris declared it was
the purpose of the Japanese govern
ment to drive Christianity out of Asia
and that the United States would be
aiding in that attempt if It acquiesced
in the treaty proposal to extend Japan
esee rule over Shantung.
, "I cannot see how Christian peope
can read of conditions in Korea." he
said, "and then ask us to ratify this
treaty and not protest against a na
tion that carries on such work. It
brings us face to face with the fact
that we annot afford to turn over
Shantung to the heathen country
Japan.
"I am not a member of any church
or religious organization, but may ray
lips be sealed with eternal silence be
fore I give officIa approval of an act
to stamp out the religion ,of Jesus
Christ and put paganism in Its stead."
Chairman Lodge of the foreign rela
tions committee planned to speak dur
ing the day on the Shantung amend
ment, but he decided not to do so be
cause of the time required by Senator
"Norris to finish his address. Mr.
Lodge probably .will speak tomorrow
and the leaders hope also to make
some progress in the reading of the
treaty text.

NORTH BUTTE
HAS INCREASE
IN PRODUCTION
Few companies' of its size bare In
creased ' production during recent
months to the extent t-t North Butte
has. This company is striving to get
production back to normal, which
means about 2,000,000 pounds a
month. At the rate output has been
increasing since May it should not
be many weeks before production is
back to normal.
August output- of this company
amounted to 1,640.122 pounds, the
largest in any month since last Janu
ary, when 2.241,829 pounds were
turned out. August output Increased
445.000 pounds over July, and 685,000
pounds over June. As compared with
May, when the output amounted to
but 584.916 pounds, the smallest in
many months, the August figure
showed an increase of 966,000 pounds,
or 163 per cent. - There is no other
romnanv nroducins? ' 1,000,000 to 2c
000,000 pounds of topper & month
that can show any such increase as
that."
At present the labor situation Is"th"e
only stumbling block in keeping pro
duction below -2,000,000. pounds ,a
month. Just as soon as sufficient
men can be obtained that goal should
he reached." ,
North Butte Is turning out its cop
per at a. cost of slightly less than 17
cents a Dound.'which means a. fairly
substantial profit on the current cop
per metal : market, if the company
could dispose of itB entire output.
Costs last year averaged close to 21
cents a pound.
North Butte, like a number of other
producers, has a fairly large amount
of unsold copper.
The showing that has recently been
uncovered in the East Side proper
ties has fulfilled the earlier expecta
tions of the -management. Favorable
ore discoveries have been made and it
is possible that a rich and substantial
deposit of ore may be found there,
which might mean the making of a
bi? mine.
During the - period of curtailment
in production the management
pushed ahead its development worK,
which has been attended with excel
lent results. . . .
North Butte is a fairly substantial
producer of silver, which means' some
thing with the white metall at present
prices. The silver' recovery is said
to be running well up With the copper
content of about '3 per cent, which
has bee nthe average of late. - v"

shire in. the throes of a' great Indus
trial strike is as unlike the familiar
Yorkshire of work-a-day tone and
habit as it i3 possible to conceive, and
the spectacle of colliery acres desert
ed, pit winding wheels at a Standstill,
and huge by-produt plants stopped for
lack of the fuel which lay within
arm's reah was as unique as it was
undesirable. Occasional puffs of smoke
or steam from the boiler house in the
colliery yard served, here and there,
to suggest that not. all activity in the
district had' ceased but only the pump
ing and ventilating machinery was
being kept at work, and .this by the
aid of naval men. To all intents and
purposes, the area bounded by Lanca
shire on the west and Derby on the
south was quiet as the most unpreten
tious coastal hamlet.
Little can be seen or heard of the
bluejackets imported by the govern
ment to. keep the pumps going. . They
are mostly billeted ton the various col
liery ..premises or close by,' and are
provided with means of recreation dur
ing their spare time - that i does not
bringl theth into contact with the mftv
ers in the village. ' Khaki is seldom,
Sf ever, visible. ' .
Occasionally colliers chat , with the
Jack Tars near the pit gates, and the
jokes and laughter that then find ex
pression are symptomatic of the good
feeling that prevails between taem.
The colliers realize that, after all, the
sailors, besides preserving the pits
from disaster, are keeping them in
such a condition that once a resump
tion is ordered the workings will be
lit to receive them.
At Barnsley many thousands of men
and boys, were' to :be seen idling the
time away. May Day Green, -where
row' upon row of empty market stalls
furnished sitting room for the strik
ers, presented a curious . picture of
men wondering what would be the
next change in the situation. .
Mucli the same state of things was
to be observed in Wakefield and other
large mining centers. ' The main
thoroughfares were dotted with strag
gling groups of mines, who had
trudged in from the surrounding col
liery villages in search of a little ex
citement. .
' At Barnsley a veteran miner of
seemingly more than average intetli
frence, threw some side lights on the
affair He-considered it was chiefly
"the younger end" responsible for the
Qnrestr the strike found manyof the
others "differently placed, 'as he ex-,
pressed' it; Some had put a little by
for a rainy day, but even elrey, with
a young family of say three or four
children had not been abele to save
much owing to the present high prices.
"It takes a good woman with- a fam
ily fill her time," he remarker to make
3 (pounds go as far as a -soveregn did
before the' war. And house rents in
South Yorkshire, as a rule, are much
higher than in West oYrkshire. In
the west, too, there 'are woolen mills
where colliers' daughters are abel to
eorn good money to add to the income
of a family; whereas, in the southern
f portion of the county, in places like
Barnsley and Doncaster, there are no
such industries and a girl Is lucky here
to earn 15 shillings per week. And
that Is not enough to keep her."

pMAPtSR VIII I Discover That a
Lead Xote P1mm,
I do not wonder that opera ainrere
art prone to sine loud . tone. The
critic criticise thoie whe do It. but
the poor artists really have to follow
.this course, even when it is open to
queetioti, -on the Rrounfls of being:
Inartistic. The loud tone especially
if it be high, or comparatively so
seldom falls to brins; applause. And
as applaune Is the measure of a
people's pleasure vwe have to gov
ern oureolves accordingly, and be
blamed by those who may feel es
we feel . . . that it is not invariably
the desirable thing to do.
It was not many months after I
entered vaudeville that I made this
discovery for myeelf, one evening In
a western Pennsylvania town. I was
in a singing mood at that perform
ance, my voice vibrant and respon
sive. The time came for 'my first
solo and I lost myself, completely,
to it. When I finished the last note
Which was almost as high as 1 could
comfortably sing at the tlnie there
was a momentary silence, then a
burst of applause coming from every
part of the auditorium.
At first 1 was pussled; so much so
that I was tardy in making the exit
called for at. that joint. When I
reached the stage entrance, and had
walked out af sight of the audience,
the housa manager -caught: me by
the. hand. ..':'.''
"That -was great,"; tit sat4,''"o on
.vand do It over (again." .
."With, that he vgave ,mer a gentle
push, - and :I" found myself greeted
with a fresh clapping; of hands, to
which v I made ' proper acknowledg
ment : ' : -: .
- Three 'times 'more :I -had to finish
that .last verse of vthe song, ending
with that particular high note. I
withdrew : for the last time with a
sensation of pleasure one experi
ences In shaving been -told . that an
-endeavor pleases; and also .turning
over in my mind the effect .of what
I- had f done.
Of course 1 repeated that high-note-hold
at the next opportunity
with similar results. And In the
next town I did likewise, and ao on
from place to place.
I cannot describe the sensation
eomlng to the singer who observes
the action of those listening to such
a tons. It Is -very stimulating.
There comes a certain consciousness
of power, and one takes an enjoy
ment which, perhaps, exceeds that
tt those for whom the tone Is sung.
I grew to watch the faces of
People during my delivery of my loud
note in that sohg I mentioned. It
was curious to see the expressions
the different expressions different
people revealed. One person would
sit with mouth slightly open; an
other, lean forward, with mouth
tight'.? shut. I have marveled at the
attitudes of some, who would almost
crouch in their seats. More than
once I could see someone usually a
man gripping the arms of his seat
with both hands, and seemingly un
willing to let go. With almost no
exception there would come no
change in the given position, or facial
expression, of anyone so long as I
continued to hold the high tone I was
singing. But the moment I released
It finished, that to the people
would relax with me, and as sud
denly as I let go the note.
The majority would Instantly begin
to applaud; some feverishly and with
increasing force; others mors -sedately.
The minority would sit
watching me,, or appearing to; and
occasionally some of these would
Joln in ;the clapping of hands. -',
If it chanced that I took an encors,
very much the same procedure would
ensue: - the same , people would; gen
erally ' drop ';lntb'r their former atti
tudes of rapt-attention.- Or. If .not
Just the same, something approximat
ing that position. '. - - " -'
But one learn through experience.
I was over generous, -I fear, with
that particular top note. I probably
forced, how and again. . In my en
thusiasm. And one night it did not
go so well. Neither was vthe ap
plause so spontaneous or so .loud or .
long." It set me t? thinking. I
realized particularly after a talk
with Carmella that I must conserve.
Soon after X tried an experiment,
in a search for7 some substitute. 1

While the troopers -were clearing

lice at Clairton said a large number
of workers returned to the mills today.
Two meetings of strikers were held
at Homestead without interference.
During the afternoon troopers
searched a number of houses for fire
arms but found none.
The radical pamphlets were ' dis
tributed as "a proclamation of the
Communist party of America." The

The Capitalist Challenge You, Work

The pamphlet declares that the
municipal government Of Gary, sub
mitting to the control of the steel
trost,"had forbidden the working men
to hold public meetings and parades
and that for two weeks the working-
men had '.'permitted ' the Steel trust
government to trample under foot the
democratic rights which they had
been so often assured were the heri
tage of the people of 'this country."
"The national government, the cap
italist state," the pamphlet says, after
telling of the arrival of the troops,
"had stepped in when the steel trust
was in danger of being beaten. To
Bave itself it brought into the field
the instrument forged by the capital
ists to uphold their system of exploi

in spite of all its democratic preten
sions is but the physical expression
of the dictatorship, of the capitalist

The pamphlet concludes:
"Gather in great mass meetings.
Bring to the attention of the unen
lightened workers the meaning of
martial law at Gary. Show them
that it is not enough to strike against
low wages and bad working condi

"The workers must compare the
power of the state. They must wrest
from the capitalists the means
through which the capitalist rule Is
maintained.
"The answer to the dictatorship of
the capitalists is the dictatorship of

INDOOR SPORTS
WHEN time hangs heavy with His Majesty.the King of Eng
land, we suppose he looks over the waiting list and decides
to confer knighthood upon some deserving candidates, la
like situation the lately deposed Kaiser would distribute Iron
crosses among the faithful. If the monotony of peaceful surround
ings should bore Messrs. Lenine and Trotzky they would doubtless
go into executive session and select some new guests for the firing
squad. When ennui seizes upon our Board of Supervisors, it forth
with considers the general state of our roads and highways and
decires to appoint another County Highway Commission.
- Already tha Board has appointed three separate Highway Com
4 iid there yet remains more than a year of the Board's
iieiul term. We" cannot foretell how many more Highway Com
missions the Board may yet decide to appoint because such appoint
ments are doubtless dictated by exigencies or mood, or of time or
season, or of weather or digestions
The County -had one Highway Commission on hand when the
present Board came into office. Shortly thereafter the L'oard de
cided to appoint another, and did so. We do not know what became
of that Commission. Even the identity of its members is almost
forgotten. Whether or not it ever tried to act as a Commission, we
do not know. Probably its members speedily learned that they could
not displace the Commissioners then in office and concluded to be
satisifed by the distinction of their empty appointments. At any
rate, so far as discernible with the naked eye, that Commission .
evaporated.
Later, the Board determined again to exercise its sovereign
power in the premises and appointed another Commission.' Events
followed thickly upon that appointment. They need not be recounted
here. Shortly it became evident that the Board was sorely disap
pointed in that second Commission. That Commission held the view
that it should really perform the functions of a Highway Commission.
Moreover, it declined lo evaporate when the Board told it to. It still
holds the fort.
Now the Board has appointed another Commission. Doubtless
this third attempt on the Board'spart has brought forth a Commission
which if given the opportunity would give a life-like imitation of a
rubber stamp. Probably if it could it would like to fire Dick Ryan
which the second Commission refused to do. But, at this juncture
along comes the Pima County Commission.
Apparently that Pima County, Commission wanted its highways
built by a competent highway engineer. Itis said, moreover, that it
is a Republican Commission, whereas Dick Is a Democrat. But al
thought he l3 a Democrat he is also the premier road builder of the
State, and the' Pima County Commission seems to havo been aware
of that fact. Of course, our Board of Supervisors thought Dick's
salary as Highway Engineer of Cochise County was scandalously
high, but the Tima Commission were willing to boost thai salary in
order to get him.
So Cochise County loses Dick Ryan, temporally, we hope. He
is and long has been one of cur foremost and best citizens, whose
friends are legion. We hate to lose him.
But we still have several Highway Commissions left anyway.
Possibly the Board may try to appoint a few more but we think not.
We fear that Dick's departure will kill the Board's favorite indoor
sport.
One thing, however, is certain, namely that the Pima County
Commission will get one hundred cents' worth of first-class road for
dollar spent under Ryan's directions.
THE KING OF THE BELGIANS
F OUR institutions included a poet laureate, our royal guest of
1 Belgium would have the Nation's welcome expressed to him in
what would probably be bad verse. At least we cannot imagine
that a laureate appointed by political patronage would be likely
to be a poet. '
Lacking that means of expression. King Albert will have to
take America's welcome in such form as genuine appreciation of
his own personal Qualities as man and king, and. hearty admira
tion for t the independent spirit , and patriotism of the Belgian peo
ple, dictate and suggest. From what we know of the king we
think he will understand this form of expression and perhaps even
prefer it to any that the most formal ceremonial could provide.
The king- of the Belgians measures up to the American no
tion of what a king should be. So far as kings can be democratic
he is that. The organic law of his country declares it to be a
"constitutional, representative, hereditory monarchy." Albert is it3
king by the authority of that law, and he makes no other pre
tensions. Belgium, born of revolution, made good its claim to in
dependence before the sovereignties of Europe, and chose a form
of government under which it deemed its liberties would be best
secured. Its choice was a monarchy, but a monarchy strictly
limited and in which the representatives of the people formed the
basis of the throne. Albert is king of the Belgians and not king
of Belgium.
When the great test, came in 1914, this relationship between
the king, and his people was one of the strong links that held
the government and the people firmly together. The nation rose
in arms with the -king at its head. When the army, after dis
puting the path of the oncoming hosts with a stubbornness that
evoked the plaudits of the world was finally forced almost off its
country's soil the king was with it, and remained with it until it
triumphantly bore him back into his capital.
This is a kind of kingcraft that Albert will find no carping
at In America. A king that serves his country and people may be
forgiven the accident of his birth. A king that respects the law?
of his country, that recognizes the authority of ministers and as
semblies and that casts his fortune always with those of his peo
ple. Is pretty sure to be a good ruler no matter what his title.
( America regards Albert as a ruler of that class. It welcomes him
as a representative of the people of Belgium whose confidence he
has proved himself worthy or, and bids him make himself; at .home ,
at its democratic 'hearth. . '
One sarcastic commentator says our universities are growing
centers of tearing because the professors take so much learning to
them ud the students take so small an amount away. Well, the
professors arc rapidly being starved to death, so the situation must
Change.

SAN DIEGO & ARIZ. RAILROAD
IS BOOST FOR STATE
YUMA, Oct. 13. Press Bancroft,
general passenger and freight agent
of the- Southern Pacific railroad,
Tucson division, is in Yuma looking
after the company's business. When
questioned about the San Diego &
Arizona railroad, which . is to be
opened next month,, Mr.-'Bancroft re
ferred to a story appearing in the
Tucson Citizen,, which follows:
"When through train service is
established between Yuma and' San
Diego next month over the new San
Diego && Arizona railroad and the
Inter-California, a dream of many
years will be realized and both
Southern Arizona and San Diego will
be given a big boost. The new
service will cut the time to San
Diego several hours and make it a
popular seaside resort for Arizona
people who have for the most part
made Los Angeles their mecca in
the past.
i "Id the beginning, only one train
in each direction will be operated
between San Diego and Yuma in
connection with the Inter-California
railway, a part of the Southern Pa
cific system, interchanging equip
ment with the Southern Pacific
Golden- State limited at Yuma.
"The method of operation will be
as follows : A train will be started
out of Los Angeles for Chicago over
the Southern Pacific and Rock Isl
and lines and at the same time a
train out of 6an Doego for Chicago
over the San Diego and the Inter
California, or more properly the
Southern Pacific, and these two
trains will be combined at Yuma for
Chicago.
. "In like manner, the westbound
'trains will be split at Yuma and two
trains will be operated, one going
to San Diego and the other to Los
Angeles.

SON, 19, SHOOTS FATHER -
AS RESULT OF QUARREL.
PHOENIX, Oct. 13. Frank Patter
son, a rancher living just south of
the intersection of Seventh avenue
and Maryland, was shot three times
by his 19-year-old son, Alva Patter
son, early this afternoon. Immediate
ly after the shooting the boy went
to the 'adjoining ranch of H. S. Dye,
and calling out the owner, said to
him, "I've killed papa. I am going
in now and give myself up."
Dye drove at once to the Patter
son home and seeing that Patterson
was still alive placed him in the
car and hurried him to the Sisters'
hospital. Patterson was shot both
below and above the knee of one leg
and also through the abdomen. None
of the shots, it is thought, are fatal,
but the man's condition is rendered
more serious by the fact that he is
a consumptive, coming here two
years ago for his health.
A Mexican workman was present
on the Patterson ranch' when ' the
quarrel resulting in the' shooting oc
curred. Mrs. Patterson is absent in
Missouri, visiting relatives there.

BURRO, MAN AND BOY
REACH TUCSON ON TRIP.
TUCSON, Oct. 13 Armed with a
husky burro and a stack of post
cards to sell, G. . L. Covert,, hailing
from New York, via a hand-operated
hard-rubber-tired tricycle with the
burro acting as an auxiliary engine
to push from behind, drew up be
fore the Starr office last night, and
declared he ' would be here a few
days, encamped at" Twenty-second
stree and Third avenue, and invit
ed visitors to drop in, see his pack,
his family and learn something
about the hardest way to hit the
trail for the West, when the "yen"
comes on in ;New York.
His family follow in a two-wheel
rig to which the burro is hitched in
the ordinary way. From the collar
of the little animal two shafts con

the wagon was disconnected.

SPEED COP RUN DOWN;
SHOOTS TIRES OFF AUTO!
TUCSON, Oct. 13.Reckless driv
ing by college boys out for speed
ridea was ended promptly at Third
street and Fourth Avenue last night
by Patrolman Red Osborn, who,
when two machines, loaded with
youths, failed to hault when ' he
called, and rushed down upon him,
drew his revolver and shot one
front tire as the machine rushed
past and shot a rear tire off as it
attempted to get away. Then he
arrested the driver of the car and
cited all the occupants to court.
R. B. Wilson was charged with
driving the car and H. Brisley, E.
W. Ziegler, E. A. Wood. Oscar Cook,
T. J. Feterley and E. B. Sneed with
being in the car.
Just before that Osborn arrested
Clifton E. Kelly and charged him
with reckless driving with the muf
fler open.
Early in the evening Patrolman
Osborn, proceeding up Stone avenue,
was knocked down and run over by
a third party of youths in a crowd
ed car, who shut off the lights and
speeded to safety.
Osborn picked himself up, found
his hands baily scratcdeh and cut,
but considered himself lucky to be
otherwise unhurt.
jHe continued on his post, deter
mined to put im end . to any more
reckfess driving.'' '
About 9 o'clock the machine driven
by Kelly swung in sight at Third
street and Fourth avenue. He or
dered it to stop but cited only the
driver to court.
About 11 o'clock, the car driven
by Wilson came into view.
"I stepped out and shouted for it
to stop," said Osborn last night,
"then I had to step back to get out
of the way, for the machine was
coming fast. I thought that was a
little too far andil threw down on
it and got one of the front tires.
The machine kept going and I fired
into the rear tire and . then the ma
chine began to wabble.
"T guess we better stop,' one of
the boys said. 'He's got both tires.'
"Some shot all right," another boy
said, Osborn reported.
Then Osborn took all the names
and told them to report to the po
lice court.
"Every night the boys from the
college race up anddown from the
university," said Osborn. "They
don't seem to care how near they
come to killing people. They take
it as a kind of a joke."

PUBLIC MARKET TO BE
BUILT BY COUNTY.
DOUGLAS, Oct. 13 Supervisor J.
M. Sparks stated this morning that
should the American Legion of this
city provide the site for their pro
posed market in Douglas the super
visors would put up a building to
accommodate the market. A con
tract has been let by the supervis
ors for a market building at Lowell,
which is also in charge of the
American Legion of the Warren dis
trict. The county will provide a
market building in Douglas, accord
ing to Mr. Sparks, as it is the de
sire of the supervisors tq treat all
communities alike, thus giving aid
to the farmers in the valley in mar
keting their products. The charac
ter of the building to be construct
ed is a galvanized iron structure and
this would probably be what would
be built in Douglas.
The Hiiburn post in this city has
had the , market . under consideration
during, te pHBt i week and last night
held another meeting for a further
discussion of .the proposition. Also,
is was learned this morning lhat a
meeting whs held last night at Mc-
Neal for the purpose of lending aid

Sixteen Years Ago Today In Bisbee
(From the Bisbee Daily R
Constable Billy Murphy, who was
in the city yesterday from Naco,
placed under arrest a Chinaman who
has been parading tinder the nanio
of Lee Hoo, and" had in his posses
sion at the time of his arrest a
certificate bearing that name with
an accompanying photograph.
Murphy had been on the lookout
for this particular Chink for some
days, it having become known to
the officers that he had crossed the
line from Sonora some time ago.
Murphy acted on advices received
from Chinese Inspector Charles E.
Connell. The arrest was made in
front of the Maze saloon about
noon, and the queue-wearer taken to
the county jail."

LONG LIVE KING ROBERTS
HOME ON A VISIT?
The following letter and explana
tory note, in which the attempt of
(.'hailes M. Roberts, county supervisor,
to arrogate to the county supervisors
power greater than those by a state
department la declared to be against
sober common sense, is taken from the
Tucson Citizen of Oct. 11:
That the attorney-general should not
call on the state engineer to look up
the state law with reference to the
handling of the state highway funds,
but that in all his opinions, political
or otherwise, he should hew to the
line, letting the chips fall where they
may, is the suggestion made by State
Engineer Tom Haddock to Wiley EL
Jones.
This letter was mailed today. It is
in answer to one from Jones, in which
he suggests that he is about to issue
an opinion to the county board of su
pervisors to the effect that they are
masters of the situation with refer
ence to the handling of any of the
state 75 per cent road funds, and that
the state engineer acts merely in an
advisory capacity. Before taking this
step, howeer, Jones delicately sug
gested that he would like to find out
what Maddock thought about it.
It Is evident irom Jones' letter that
he is attempting to make the path
easy for Charlie Roberts in his plan
for giving county supervisors more
power than that exercised by a state
department, a scheme which Maddock
does not hesitate to characterize as
against common sobtr sense. Jones'
present attitude is made all the more
-ridiculous by reason of the fact that
it is diametrically opposed to his
views when B. M. Atwood was state
engineer.
Maddock Tackles Job
Jones' attempt to convert the state
engineer into a lawyer is not exactly
relished by Maddock. However, he
tackles the job with thoroughness and
gives a clear outline of the legal as
pects of the road situation in his let
ter. Here it is:
"Hon. Wiley E. Jones,
"Attorney General of Arizona,
"Capitol Building,
"Phoenix, Arizona,
"Dear Sir: Your recent letter re
vived by tLis office during my ab
sence. "You deeply honor mo in asking
that I cite you the law. I also ap
preciate your kind delay in not giving
your opinion on the law until I have
notified you of my acquiescence in
your views. Perhaps it were better,
in legal matters, to "hew to the line;
let the chips fall where they may.' .
"Your suggested cpinion that the
county boards of supervisors are the
fiscal agents of the state of Arizona
in the expenditure of federal aid
funds and the state engineer is mere
ly the agent of the boards of super
visors is, fortunately, in direct vari
ance with the legal department of the
United States bureau of public roacs
which has recognized the state en
gineer as the state highway department-
of Arizona, and refuse' to trans
act business with any other parties.
Please read Section 1, Chapter XXV,
Page 24, Session Laws of 1917, where
the legislature in assenting to the fed
eral aid act of congress, constituted
the state .engineer the agent through
which the state should transact busi
ness with the federal government.
"There has never been any belief
in this department, that I know of,
that the state engineer was more than
equal to the board of supervisors in
the expenditure of the 75 per cent
stale road fund on construction not
involving federal aid, unless it was oc
casioned by your letter of June 4,
1918, to the state auditor, in which,
speaking of the state engineer, you
stated 'he has ful authority over the
control of the state highways in act
ing with county authorities on behalf
of the state', or your letter of June 1,
1918, to Mr. B. M. Atwood, former
state engineer, and member of your
political party, in which I find the fol
lowing paragraph:
" 'It is evident from all the law
above referred to, that the state en
gineer does not have control over the
county roads prescribed in Chapter 13,
Title 10, Revised Statutes, and the
county roads dealt with in Chapter 31,
Laws of 1917, authorizing the creation
of county highway commissioners, to
expend moneys from county bonds
upon county highways; but it seems
to be a proper construction of the law,
lo hold that the state engineer should
exercise control over all state high
ways in order to carry out and ac
complish the purport and Intent of
said Chapter 7, providing for state
highways and bridges which are con
structed, improved and maintained un
der the supervision of the state en
gineer acting Jointly with the bodies
above mentioned.'
Please Read Law
"My only comment on this is 'the
law for the goose will do for the gan
der.' Please re-pursue the paragraphs
of the law upon which you formulated
these above opinions.
' "In regard to'the 25 per cent fund
I do not agree with you that the state
engineer is a state institution, any
more than the state land commissioner
or any other state officer. Please
note Section 21, Chapter 89, Page 133
R. S-, third legilature, which in abol
ishing the board ci control, placed
many institutions under the commis
sion of state institutions, but did not
mention the state engineer or the high
way department. Certainly Sections
13, 20, 21 and 23, Chapter 64, Page 95
R. S., fourth legislature, 1918, do not
indicate that the state engineer is a
Btate institution. All the paragraphs
quoted have become law subsequent to
Paragraph E124 Revised Statutes 1913,
that-you have mention, the last three
sections having been passed by the
legislature after your famous contro
versy with a previous state engineer.
I think your opinion that the state
engineer is a state institution is alo
not common, sober sense.
"Now, Mr. Jones, our department
considering federal air, federal equip
ment, special and regular state ap
propriations, is trying to look after ex
nnditures and equipment totaling
over i6.000.000. This is more than the
entire cost of running the state of
Arizona, every county, .city and town,
and road and school district In the
year 1914. We have many engineers,
foremen, timekeepers, inspectors, me
chanics and laborers in our depart
ment, but no lawyers. I am busy try--
ing to secure the most roads for the
least money under the adverse condi
tions of th high cost of living. If you.
are going to give any more opinions,
political or otherwise, do so, but please
do not ask for my time to look up the
sovereign law of the state of Arizona.
"Accept, Sir, the renewed assurance
of my highest consideration.

motion of trade relations between Cen

ject discussed at a luncheon given in
"Montreal by Marcus E. Reisch, Com

"Slovak Republic, to a large number of
prominent business and financial men
of Montreal. Mr. Reisch gave a de
tailed account of trade onditions and
possibilities for trade development in
Czecho-Slovakia and Central Europe
generally at the present time and in
timated tbat there was much more
money and greater opportunities for
development in those countries than
was nonularly supposed. Farm mar
cliinery was particularly in demand
and Canada should secure at least 25
per cent of this business. '
Mr. Reisch suggested that the bank
ers and manufacturers of Canada get
together to make arrangements for
Credits for the furtherance of this
trade, and that a convention be soon
field to take the matter up immedi
ately with the heads of the various
sections of the Canadian Manufactur

cal post in uniform, headed, if pos
sible, by a large detachment of Unit
ed States regulars from Douglas; an
aeroplane escort flying low over
