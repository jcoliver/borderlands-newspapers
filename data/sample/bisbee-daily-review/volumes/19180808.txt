(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 7. Destruc
tion by a submarine off Diamond
Shoals Lightship number 71, a help
less cra't anchored off Cape Hatteras
to warn shipping from the treacherous
shoals forming the "grave yard of tha
Atlantic coast," confirms the belief of
caval officials that German sea wolves
sent to this side of the Atlantic are
under orders to handicap commerce in
all ways possible without exposing
themselves to formidable opponents.
News of the shelling' and sinking of
the light ship came to the navy depart
ment today, clearing up the mystery of
earlier reports from coast guaid sta
tions on the North Carolina coast that
heavy shelling was heard at spa yes
terday afternoon. The crew of 12
men on the ligst vessel escaped in the
small boat and rowed the ten or twelve
miles to shore.
Subsequently the submarine ap
peared within half a mile of the land
which projects for out from the main
coast of North Carolina. So far ns
has been reported no nttnek was made
on any villages or other objects.
Secretary Daniels said that undoubt
edly the purpose of the submarine 'n
destroying the light ship was to hinder
commerce. ' Great volumes of both
coastwise and overseas commerce pass
Cape Hatteras and the German prob
ably believes vessels might be wrecked

THAT MALVY'S SENTENCE TO
FIVE YEARS' BANISHMENT FOR
MALFEASANCE IN OFFICE
(By Review leased Wire)
PARIS. Aug. 7. (Havas Agency.)
Commenting upon the verdict in the
case of Louis J. Malvy, former minis
ter of the interior who was found
guilty of malfeasance in office yester
day, the newspapers of Paris appeal to
all sincere Frenchmen to agree with
the judgment of the high court.
M. Malvy was sentenced yesterday
by the French senate, sitting as the
high court, to banishment for five
years, after having been convicted ot
holding communication with the en
emy. Before taking this action the
court went through the formality of
dismissing the charge of treason or
complicity in treason. This action hav
ing been reported in press dispatches
to the Associated Press on August 2.
Another press association yesterday,
apparently confused by the formal con
firmation by the high couVt of the pro
vious action by the prosecutor, in re
porting that M. Malvy had been ac-
quitted on the charge of treason gavo
I the impression that the entire rase
had been decided in his favor. The
! actual decision was not reached until
j several hours later and was carried
exclusively and correctly by the Assu
I riated Press.

Against Terrific Obstacles
Raised by Germans
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY ON
THK A1SNK-MARNE FRONT. Aug. 7
!By The Associated Press). Under an
inferno of shrapnel and machine gun
fire and waves of gas the Americans
forced their way over the Vesle river
last night and early this morning while
rain varying at times from a drizzle
to a downpour drenched the battle
field.
French troops already have gained
positions on the American left and the
joint movement has straightened out
the line from a-point west of Bazoches
to Fistnes.""
The Germans lost considerably in
casualties. Prisoners' stories tended
to corroborate the opinion of those
previously taken that the Germans ex
pect to continue their retreat until the
Aisne Is reached.
The attack began between 4 and 5
o'clock Tuesday afternoon. By mid
night thos on the right had reached
their objectives, the main highway
east and west extending along the
foothills hat rise north of the river
and become a series of terraces to the
Aisne.
The left wing was delayed, but it
also reached the line shortly before 8
o'clock this morning:
The artillery on both sides is still
fighting duels and the Germans con
tinue small arm resistance. But every
hour the positions of the French 'and
Americans are more secure.
Under cover of a barrage the en
gineers threw light bridges over the
stream, while the officers placed their
men in position, working them down
ward toward the bridges. The chal
lenges were acceiKed by tha German
artillery and in a few minutes the in
termittent reports of the guns which
had been heard all day were merged
into one great roar.
The clouds, which had lifted slight
ly, reappeared just before the attack
was launched and the action was con
ducted without much advantage in ob
servation by aircraft.
When the order for the advance was

It had been Btated previously that
Captain Wheeled would be certain to
be here, but when he was called by
telephone last night to learn whether
he would fill the date, he said there
were two elements ct doubt. The
chief one would be whether army of

Captain Wheeler said he intends to

favorable, he will be here.

LONDON, Aug. 7. David Lloyd

to what had been accomplished in the

Marshal Foch's counter offensive as
I "the most brilliant in the annals of

Reverting to peace, Lloyd George
said the people who had made the

'until all the allies were defeated at
' sea Germany could never triumph.
When England decided to throw her
whole weight into tiie war. he con
tinued, she did so because of nn out
rage on international rights. Had she
not taken this decision, the whole
course of the war would have been
different. He pictured the part the
navies have played In the war and
said he did not think that many per
sons realized that if the allies were
defeated on the water the war would
Iv over.
"When the war began," Mid Lloyd
George, "the Britsh navy, t.'ien the
largest in the world, represented a
tonnage of two and a half million.
New, including the-auxiliary fleet, it
is eight million. Were it not for this
Increase the seas might be barred for
the commerce of the world. Every
trade route of the world is patrolled
by its Bhips. ' 1
"During June alone, British naval
ships steamed 8,000,000 miles. To this
must be added the efforts of the mer
cantile marine wliich is now a branch
of the British navy and whose men
face the same dangers carrying for
the allies,, as well as for themselves
most of the American troops that have
so valiantly acquitted themselves in
recent ccmbats.
"1 wonder how many people under
stand the number of men required to
man and maintain the British navy
and mercantile marine. There are
'at least 1X00,000. probably" 800,000 or
900.000 of whom are of military age
' There was an Attempt io coma out
, some of these men, but it was found
impossible, to. do so would be letting
down the British fleet and to let down
the British fleet is to let down the
allies.
"I wish to point to the necessity
of not impairing in the slightest de-
grce the-' efficiency, strength .and
growth of the British navy and mer-
, cantile marine. During the last two
. years Germany has -made two distinct
attempts to force a decision one on
the land and one on the sea. The land
, offensive would have been final. If
the submarines had succeeded, our
1 armies in France would have withered
away. No Americans could have come
' over to asist us and the French troops.
, Ammunition could not have been
1 shipped and we could not have sent
the necessary coal and material to en-
able France and Italy to manufacture
munitions.
"The American naval mission which
' came over recently saw a great deal
of effort of the British navy and was
immensely struck with the vastness
, cf the work which is being done. It
was especially anxious that steps be
taken to make known, not only here,
but in America, the gigantic character
cf the task we are doing.
"Unless the allies had been com
pletely triumphant at sea from the
outset of the war no effort on the land
could have saved them. The British
fleet has been mainly responsible for
that complete triumph which-could Cor
have been secured and maintained
without ligamic efforts in- nieir awtfr
material. Any distribution of re--sources
which "would lmpafr in the
least the effort would be ruinous to
the forces of the allies.
"I would like to point out In deal
ing with the army and its growth that
the maintenance of the navy and the
mercantile marine is the first charge
on the resources of the country. Our
military effort has been subject to the
demands of those obligations on our
resources ia men and material, yet.
since August, 1914, Including those
already) with the colors, Ijigland alone
lias raised ,for -the army and navy
6.230,000 men. for the most part vol
untarily. The dominions contributed
1.C00.000 and India 1.250,000.
"If America were to call to the col
ors, the same number of men as Eng
land in proportion to population, it
would mean nearly 15.000.0(10 men.
"On the western front, after the en- j
emy had been relieved of all appre
hension on the eastern front because
of the Brest-Litovsk peace, the Ger
mans brought all their best divisions
against us and our allies. Therelore,
when the German offensive began
March 21, the allies were confronted
by the flower of the German army,
who had rested and made preparations
especially for the great blow while
the French and the British were tired
by the prolonged offensive on our part
under the most exhausting condi
tions. "Considerable American forces had
been expected to reach the battle front
by spring, but as a matter of fact on
the 21st of March there was only one
American division in the line although
there were three or four divisions be
hind the line which were brought ua
utter the attack began.
"The weather conditions were the
most favorable that the enemy could
have chosen. Our united command was
not yet an accomplished fact in spite
of all endeavors to achieve it, and each
geneial was mainly concerned over
the perils of his own fronts when the
blow came the reserves of the allied
armies were not available to meet it
where it fell.
"These were the conditions under
which the long prepared and carefully
planned blow of the picked troops of
Germany fell upon the British army.
The enemy's object was to obtain a
military decision this year before the
American army could come up, first
of all by severing the two armies and
then attacking the separated French
and British forces.
"We must understand the enem;
plan in order to realize what the valor
of the British army achieved. If the
two objects had been obtained, the
American forces could not have ar
rived in time to save'the French army.
That was the German calculation. Let
us not forget inthe light of what hap
pened afterward that it was not such
an impossible effort.
"How did the German plans pros
per? There had been four and a half
months of such fighting as never be
fore was seen on the face cf the globe.
What happened? At first the German
army achieved considerable success
and we had anxious moments very
anxious moments. Those who knew
most about the situation were th-3
most anxious. Our losses were con
siderable in men, in material and also
in prisoners. -
"The second German blow might
very well have overwhelmed the Bri
tish army, but before the battle was
over, in a fortnight's time, 26O.0O0
men were thrown across the channel
and, in a month's time 355.000. Every
gun lost had been put back and every
machine gun replaced. Not merely
had the deficiency been supplied but
the number had been increased.
"At that moment, there were more
guns and more machine guns with the
army in France than ever before. It
wits the first German miscalculation.
"TTiey calculated that we could not
do it.
"We owe a debt of gratitude to a
section of the press for misleading the
enemy. They led the Germans to be
lieve that we hadn't even been able to
make up the deficiency, and the Ger
mans made their plans accordingly.
"They hit here, they hit in the south,
in the center and jn the north wnere
they thought they were destroying the
British army with nothing behind it.

that the next Liberty loan, and any

and the victorious troops of the en
emy. But no veterans ever fought
with greater steadlastness than these
lads who helped to save the cause of
the allies frcm disaster.
"After the enemy's experience in
that six weeks 01 -fighting, although wc
kuow what the plan was, the British
army was not attacked for three or
four months. The Germans may come
again, but that will be because they
have failed elsewhere.
"1 wish to give warm recognition to
the assistance that the French gave in
those operations. After May 1 the Ger
mans turned off and attacked ine
French. They won a preliminary suc
cess on a considerable scale but not
merely have they been forced to a
standstill by Marshal Foch, but his
counter stroke the most brilliant in
the annals of the war has driven back
the enemy. The danger is not yet
over, but he would be a sanguine
inau on the German general staff who
now would predict that Germany could
obtain a military decision this year."

given the men, for the most part,
swept forward in open formation. The
Germans launched a counter attack
without success.
The men on the American Tight
fought their way along the chosen
routes. Some of them floundered
across through the water, while others
used the bridges that still were stand
ing. One detachpient of Germans, some
what more than a company, moved for
ward into the open. Here the Amer
ican machine guns caught them, and,
sweeping them with bullets, destroyed
them almost totally.
The Germans attempted to strike
the Americans a disconcerting coun
ter blow with a considerable force by
plunging down a ravine leading to the
river. Their path had been cleared by
their artillery , and they might have
succeeded in reaching the Americans,
but the movement had been reported
to the artillery stations south of the
Vesle and from them there swept into
the advancing column 6uch a mass
of shells that the formation was very
quickly broken. i
At another point a detachment of
Germans stood until the Americans
were upon them. Then it became a
' hand-to-hand conflict, the only one of
the kind during the, battle. In- the
mud and in darknes where the com
batants were barely able to distinguish
each other they fought it out.
The Americans won.
The Americans on the left failed to
reach their objectives until they had
called for a second barrage. Under
its. cover they rallied and struggled
forward to the chosen positions.
The Germans, in attempting to re
pulse the attack, used guns of 77 an
103 calibre and minnenwerfers. They
had them on the higher ground, con
siderably to the rear of the battle line
The American guns did excellent work
not only in covering the advance but
in breaking up foimations, especially
one large assemblage of infantry.

this could only be done by internation

be necessary to concentrate the su

whether an announcement of the size

A PESSIMISTIC BROTHER OF THE
PRESS
E. A. Rcdgers, editor of the Prescott.
Courier, when in a particularly gloomy
mocd, deposed as follows:
Ncr::i.iu Jic.Vi'.'an, representing U. G. Dunn & Co.,
called this wet k to look iti!; ti-p standing of th;
( ourier. lie found its democracy standing straight
and undented, its tribute tc the Hed Cross paid up
to date, its meal ticket paid for with only half the
numbers punched out, a pood supply of gas masks
to protect against the poison thrown out by the
sen cuts cf the snake dens of the rentile press, six
bits in real money and uite a stack of I. O. U.S.
He pulled out his pad with a lock that was sad,
and writ our rating without inflating.
Indeed, and it is true the way of the
newspaper man is hard these war days
when the government controls everything
and asks for page upon page of pure read
ing matter and advertises not, and the Pres
cctt brother has plenty of company in news
paper circles, but his pessimistic view of
his brother editors is surely without foun
dation. His haste to brand all newspaper
offices of hij own state as snake dens and
their editors as serpents becomes him ill.
The Prescott Courier is a well printed, good
looking and lively sheet, and the fact that
its editor differs from this column in sociol
ogical matters does not prevent this column
from overlooking the serpent's tooth in the
Prescott brother'3 lament and saying so.
"SMILER" NOT THE LEAST OF THE
WAR'S HEROES
Every dog lover, and his name is legion,
will appreciate this story of "Smiler," told
by a special correspondent on the western
battle front:
"There is one other story 1 must tell. It
is the story o Smiler, 'a lurcher,' and a
London stray. It was related to me by a
corporal who, 'in happier days,' was a
huntsman to a famous southern pack a
thorough doggy man.
"Smiler was a wonderful dog, 'the pride
of his unit,' and renowned throughout the
division. No matter what the country or
the conditions, Smiler could be relied upon
to find 'home' even if it were six or ,seven
miles away. One day the brigadier, 'who
set much store on Smiler," took him to the
outpost line and sent him back to head
quarters, a matter of three miles, with im
portant instructions to his staff. Smiler
was longer than usual, for somewhere on
the way a shell burst near him. He crawled
into headquarters an hour later, his lower
jaw shattered and hanging by the skin. ;
" 'Of course he knew, sir, that he must
get that message back before he died,' said
the corporal, and after what I have seen
at the school for British war dogs I beliaye
him.
"Smiler lies in a soldier's grave on the
western front, but the last message carried
a blood-stained and honored relic, the proud
proof of a dog's devotion to duty, proudly
shown to those who visit the battalion of
British war dogs."
LO, THE POOR INDIAN
The native American, the first Amer
ican, the Indian, to be exact, is winning
bright laurels in the great war for his coun
try. In the language of the old Kansas
Populist, he is in a class by itself in the
war game when it comes to "per capita"
comparisons and proportions with his white
masters and lords of his native soil.
The total Indian population of the United
States is only 335,998. Of these just about
half ate citizens, 50,000 still wear skinj
and blankets, while only 30 per cent read
and write English. There are les3 than
33,000 male Indians of military age. Yet
there are more than 6000 Indians in the
United States army, 85 per cent of them
volunteers, and several hundred more in
the navy, every one a full citizen.
Fourteen tribes are represented in the
service and when young enough the chiefs
themselves have enlisted. In rank our In
dian fcol'iicrs scale down from major to
private and almost every branch has lured
some Indians. One Indian helps run a flock
of balloons and there are many in the avia
tion corps. Some have become proficient
in wireless telegraphy and there are others
scattered through various technical divi
sions of the army. A large percentage of
the civilized Indians have received military
training at the government schools and so
enter the army with a certain advantage
over raw recruits.
The Tucson Citizen goes to bat for the
Tucson Y. M. C. A., and in a most able
editorial urges the citizens of that commun
ity to come forward to the support of this
most important of American institutions
of this day. The Citizen declares that the
war has drawn heavily upon the personnel
of the Y membership in the Old Pueblo
city, and goes to say that, notwithstanding
the activities and benefits wrought by the
Y in the war zone, its foundations and vital
strength lie at home. It seems that the chief
difficulty with the Tucson Y is lack of
funds as a result of losing so many mem
bers who have gone to war. Thanks to the
well knewn partiality of the Phelps Dodge
corporation for all forms of Y work, and
its generosity to back its feeling inthe mat
ter the Y. M. C. A. in both Bisbee and
Douglas are stronger and more effective
than ever in spite of the war. The good
these institutions have done for their ccm
munities and for the men who comprise
their membership cannot be estimated.
Their membership is maintained in spite
cf the war, for there is scarcely a man or
boy in this camp who does not know of a
certainty how much he and his friencta have
been helped in so many, real ways by the
big, broad, sensible, practical Y work plan
here.
Those who are inclined to complain here
in Bisbee because they cannot get new
telephones installed upon demand may be
somewhat mollified when it is learned that
even a rich and progressive metropolis like
Kansas City it has been decided, both by
the Bell and Home companies there, under
government control, not to install any more
residence telephones, or even make changes
or improvements in the service until after
the war. The main difficulty in the way
of the telephone man in the matter of new
service right now is the scarcity of copper
wire.- No more is available because of the
demands of the war for copper. In fact,
the government has commandeered all the
No. I 7 copper wire, which is the size used
exclusively for telephone installations.
After noting this fact about copper wire,
it is not hard to understand why the work
men and operators are speeding up cop
per production day and night and holidays
to the highest point posiible.
It seems that the crown prince has elected
to defend the Vesle, at least until his army
has time to prepare the line along the Aisne
or the Chemin des Dames. It is a safe guess
that the Vesle line will soon be passed" by
the allies, and they may1 well pass the
Aisne. But the Chemin des Dames line
offers formidable obstacles, even without
German preparation. The military critics
expect Foch to strike from Soissons, either
to the right against the northern edge of the
crown prince's beaten army, or to the left
against the southern end of the Amiens
salient held by Prince Rupprecht. With the
British army fresh since last April and re
inforced heavily by fresh levies and hence
well ready to strike down on the Amiens
salient from .the north, the allied world is
hoping and watching for Foch 'to strike
with might and main to the left. If he does
the German defeat of the Marne may' well
be turned to the disaster of the Amiens
sector.
It is said that Admiral Sims, ranking
American naval officer in European waters,
has refused knighthood at the hands of
King George of England. Well, he has a
precedent or two of note for his declination.
There is the great George of England,
Lloyd-George, who has declined all titles
whatever, and Gladstone, who made Iord3
and knights by the score, refused a title.
A Kansas editor utters the following
wise and true maxim: "Whenever I get a
letter with the prefix 'Hon. before my
name, I know whom it is from; it is from
a candidate."
From the New York Mail: The French
said at Verdun: "They shall not pas." The
Americans said on the Marne: "They
shall not stay."
Revised motto as conceived by Ding, the
cartoonist: "Hew to the Rhine, let the
Fritz fall where they may!"

sector, which represents the junction
point of the armies of the German
crown prince and of Crown Prince
Rupprecht of Bvarla.
It remained for the British to deliver
the hardest blow against the Germans
Wednesday. Following up a previous
advance In the Lys sector northwest
of La Bassee, they pushed their line
over a front of nearly five miles to
depth of a thousand yards between the
J Uwe and Clarence rivers. The details
of this advance are not yet in hand,
but the maneuver doubtless will go a
far way toward lessening the point of
the nasty salient that has stood as a
menace for mouths to tha British line
north and south of it..
Next in importance Is the further
gaining of footings by the French and
Americans across the Vesle where the
pressure against the Germans toward
the Aisne can be resumed when furtn
er troops ford the stream, but the gain
of ground by the French in the rail
way triangle north of Rheims also
mu.it be looked upon as a move of
great strategic value.
From their positions the French now
are able to 'dominate with their guns
the railway line over wiiich the Ger
mans have been bringing stores from
the northeast through the tewn of
Rethel and that line running north
westward across the Aisne toward
Laon. which undoubtedly has use since
the retreat began for the removal or
guns and supplies out of the threaten
ed zone.
David Lloyd George, the Pritish
prime minister addressing the house o
commons, spoke optimistically cf the
status of the war, from the allied stand
point. He characterized the present
offensive on the Aisne-Marne front as
the nibs.t brilliant in the annals of the
war and praised the part taken in it
bv the American troops. More than
ir0 submarines had been destroyed
since the war began, and the subma
rine menace had failed, he added.

NE WYORK, Aug. 7. The intense
heat, which reduced attendance to a
minimum and caused partial suspen -
sion of operations at industrial cen -
ters. the war casualty list and the
further erratic movements of special
ties, contributed to today's nominal
stack market.
Leaders were slugpish from the out
set. The few conspicuous changes
included General Motors, which re
acted S points and rallied five, and
tobaccos in which extreme recessions
ranged from 2 to 5 points.
United States steel rose and fell
within fractional limits, ending very
unchanged. Kindred shares fluctated
in the same restricted manner.
Metals were motionless until the
last hour, when some slight reaction
ensued on announcement that the war j
industries board had declined to grajit i
an increase in the current price of
copper. Sales amounted to 158,000
shares.
Bonds were mixed on light dealings,
French issues showing moderate j
strength. Liberty 3rd 3Vs made a

To Our Subscribers
Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it necej
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
CJ This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient as mistakes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory bcth to the
subscriber and the paper.
j Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
2 Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of time will be dis
continued. f We will appreciate your cooperation in our effortj to ive you the
very best possible sersice and conserve at the same time.

declared war on Get many a year ago
she has speeded up her teak produc

tries, and today there is not an allied
warship in the making that lacks for
this most valuable of ail naval lum

Not for Profit '
But Siam entered the war not on ac
count ol what she could do for Che
allies in a material way, nor, indeed,
for what they could do for her. Siam
had certain grievances against Ger
many Teuton agents, for instance,
were extremely active within her ter
ritories. I3ut the war to her was large
ly a moral issue and her entry wn
primarily an answer of conscience to
President Wilson's circular r.ppeal ad
dressed to the neutral nations of the
world.
The basis for Siam's gallant action
were these three considerations: Ger
many's flagrant contempt for all prin
ciples of humanity and for the rights
of small powers, her barbarous meth
ods of conducting war and the fact
that neutrality was neither feasible
nor desirable for Siam when the peace
of the world was involved. 'As King
Rama VI put it in his proclamation
"done on the 22d day of July in the
year of Our Lord Ruddha 24 CO:
"It is the duty of Siam, as one of
the family of nations, to uphold the
sanctity of international law."
Yet.-like other unselfish acts, this
began to have a wide effect. There
can be no doubt that Siam's declara
tion of war influenced China to aban
don her neutrality in favor of the al
lies. The example of the well govern
ed little nation to the south was nrecd
upon China most forcefully during the
legislative debate which led to hei
belligerency and swayed the' vote tor
war.
And Siam also finding herself at
war. began to find ways in which she
could help win it. The country is as
large as Germany, and King Rama has
12,000,000 subjects who display as thor
. oughly modern tendencies as any peo
ple of the East, not excepting the .fap
anese. Siam took part jn the allied
conference at Versailles last Novem

Seized German Ships
Her first act of war was the seizure
of nine Genr.an steamships interned in
her ports. Th se have row been re
paired and are in the service of the
allies. She next proceeded to stump
out Cermun propaganda and enemy
plots.
Siam. was conveniently situated be
tween British possessions on Hit, one
side ai'd French colonies on the other
fnr German underground operations
both in Jndia and in Indo-China. To
day there is not a pro-Geiman who
dares to raise his head in Siam and
even the 2'oo-:nile coast line is care
fully patrolej to prevent the opera
tions of German raiders or "political
ships" Jound for India. As for Ger
man born Germans, the- several hun
dred who found their way to Siam be
fore the war have had their activities
restricted to internment camps for n
year, with release in sight only when
the great peace pact is signed.
Siam is essentially an agricultural
country, and the government during
the year has wisely extended her irri
gation systems and rail lines to simu
late production to the utmost. Millions
of tons of rice are exported every sea
son and great quantities of sun-dried
lruit. snicked and salted fish, and
fresh beef from Siam help to reducfe
the universal food shortage.
In the last ten years Siam has been
successfully growing rubber of a su
perior quality, and today this compara
tively new industry is making rapid
progress under the pressure of an in
satiable demand. Siamese lead and tin
are also being worked into American
munitions on,a large scale and several
other lesser known metals of high
value in warfare are exported through
Bangkok and the Straits Settlements.
In times of peace Siam maintains an
army of 5,000. On a war basis this
army expands to 300.000 without diffi
culty. Though it is built up alons
modern linos, it is hardly likely that it
will be needed in Europe, or even in
the Near East. But that Siam is very
keen for representation on the battle
front appears from the fact that she
has already sent to France an aviation
unit of 500 men. Her flying men were
trained in Europe and in turn trained
others of their fellow countrymen un
til, it might be said, Siam now mas
ters the air of the East.
Siam. however, is no Oriental David
challenging the Teutonic Goliath. It
is not expected that she will sling the
shot which will finish Germany. Her
aid is chiefly moral. One of the most
progressive nations of the East, she.
stands leagued with the free peoples
cf the earth against military barbar
ism. Her act of war was as bold as
ours and, in its degree, as potent.
DESPONDENT WOMEN
Nature intends every woman to be

they must knew that the department
does not countenance such action, and
that whenever the proper proofs are

in collecting all that is due in cases of

Mr. Speaker, I would like to Jiave

nection. Mangum, Okla., July 9, 1918.
Hon. Jim McClintic,
'Washington, D. C.
Dear Sir: I am enclosing herewith a
paper which explains itself. In so far
as any back pay or claim of any kind,
money due my son, Alexander P. Gar
rett, for his services and fighting for
his country and world democracy. I
do not care for the money individually.
You will see from the enclosed copy
of the- paper I am sending you that it
appears that beneficiaries who are en
titled to receive any money for servic
es rendered by their sons must em
ploy an attorney to secure the same.
In a circular letter from the Treas
ury Department some time ago it was
declared that no attorney was neces
sary to collect any moneys due a sol
dier who had been killed and who ad
vanced money to buy liberty bonds or
had any back pay coming to him. But.
from the inclosed document, I take it
that some one in the department is
helping or aiding Edward J. Redmond
to fleece benegiciaries. I am loyal to
my government but I am not loyal to
graft. And if it is a fact that it is
necessary to employ an attorney to ob-

Simultaneous with furthering pacifist

At the Very time that they were

PANCAKES ARE VERY POPULAR WITH OUR
BOYS, BUT QUEEN MARY, WHEN SHE TRIED THEM,
WAS NOT VERY STRONG FOR THIS DISH
(Correspondent-
nee of The Associated
Press.)
LONDON, July 20. When the queen
uf England, on the occasion of the
royal visit to the American Eagle hut
a few days ago, sampled the Aniericau
1 pancakes, she left part of her portion
on the plate. A soldier, after their
Imaiestipa had denarted. finwhod it
! ami went around boasti n "I'm h-
3s'jman that ate the queen's pancake!"
The Eagle hut boasts three attrac-
tions so typically American that they
are almost a curiosity in London.
They are an American barber's chair,
an American bootblack htand and a
pancake griddle
The barber's chaii"' was discovered
"somewhere in England" after a long,
patient search and was bonght for $5u.
When the Y. M. C. A. people hear the
American soldier, as he stretches out
in it, say "Ali-h, that's the stuff!''
they know they made a good invest
ment. The English barber chairs are
iOUly an itinerant sidewalk knight oi
the shoebrush equipped with a small

I American shoe company presented the
1 EaB'e hut with an American stand
i wnicn nas a marine luy piece ami is
surmounted by one of those comiait-
able armchairs in which a soldier cau
repose luxuriously.
The pancake griddle was the hardest
nut of all to crack. The problem was
to abtain a metal plate large enuugh
to accommodate batter for all tne
cakes the hunghy soldiers craved. Lon
don was searcned from end to end and
at last a plate was found. But aiter
the cooker had been constructed, an
other problem presented itfelf. Wna
were the cakes to be made of; Enter
the w heat rations question. The Y. M.
C. A. cooks had one idea as to the
amount of wheat that should be used
tor the batter; the British government
had another one quite diflereut. The
cooks had to capitulate to war's neces
sities and they mixed enough corn
meal and potato flour with the.wneat
to conform to the government's
views.
To be "in on the first batch" c:
cakes, soldiers formed a queue in the
hut canteen extending-all around the
room. They ate so many cakes tiie
first week that according to one oi
the hut's secretaries, they useu up
all the maple syrup in England. A
big supply of syrup is now ou the way
troni home; also a consignment of
buckwheat, the arrival oi winch wiu
mean other queues.
The introduction at the hut recently
of what is eupnuistically kno.wn as ice
cream caused the quick formation of
a line even longer than the pancake
queue. The average afternoon con
sumption of this lavorite American
dish now amounts to eighty quarts.
One of the seven secretaries of the
American Eagle hut here was snatch
ing a moment's rest in his cubicle on
a recent Sunday afternoon when a tall
American soldier looked in at the open
door. It wag evident that the solaier
had a request to make, but he hesitat-
ed and stammered considerably betore
ne got up the courage to say he wani-
ea to borrow a suit of underwear.
I hate to trouble you for anything
like that, sir," he apologized, "but this
being Sunday the stores are closed,
and I've beon asked out to dinner, so
you see-
The secretary found he had a suit
tii Fnare. A little later, passing
through the bath room, he saw the big
I fellow splashing unuer a shower.

lieve you can get anything here if you
ask for it."
The soldiers and sailors ask for all
kinds of things at' the Eagle hut, and
rarely are tliey disappolhted

American makes a beelinu . for tne
Eagle hut. and there he geti his bear
ing and ready answers to the hundred
and one questions he invariably a;-ks.
There he finds food, entertainment
and companionship.
In the roomy, comfortable lounge
he registers by writing his name on
a marker which sticks into the "fiag-your-own-town"
map of the U. S. A.
Through the good ottices of those lit

little later, in the words of the song,
"Gee, but It's good to meet a pal from
your home town,"' for the flags have
been the means of reviving old-time
friendships between men who hail lost
sight of each other for years. In one
instance they enabled a father to finrf
Ms son.
The visitor notices also in th
lounge a counter filled with Amer
ican magazines, reading and writing
tables, and a big English billiard table.
Just off the lounge is a 'quiet room"
for reading anJ writing .

success that, judging b the iaut'liter

no regret. Most of the girls who taKe

The hut contains sleeping a-com

are four dormitories known respec
tively as the "Dixie," "Blue," "Green.''
and "Red" rooms. The "Dixie" room
is reserve! for sailors. As a largo
proportion of American sailors hail
from the southern states, this dormi
tory quickly found its name.
PLAY BIG GAME
LONDON, July 20. "The moth ann
the flame" is a little game of hide and
seek which is played over Londan at
night and then, the moth beitig an
aviator of the city's defense forces and
the flame a searchlight designed to
dazzle the German Golhas when they
come in droves to bombard Uie me
tropolis. These "rehearsals" take place at in
tervals, the director of searchlights
being notified in advance that an Hi
lled machine is to ascend, but neither
the time nor the locality are given.
Then the game of the flame is to fin 1
the moth, and keep the rays of the
searchlight fastened upon the flying
machine.
To Londoners, the airplane appears
like a great moth, or a white speck in
the sky, and the searchlight's ray re
minds one ot a groat w hite ribbon ex
tending from the earth to the airplane
and beyond.
And the moth dives and darts and
flutters about and some times man
ages to dodge the flame, but not for
long. Down below Londoners .are
craning their necks and enjoying the
game to the fullest extent.

Loaded Dice" was scenaroiJied by
Gilson Willetts from the novel by r
lery A. Clark. It is a powerful drama
affording the tar probably the strong
est role he has ever had. He is snp
pr.rted by a big cast, including Klor-
n e Piiiings. The ti pliness of tne
story is shown by the fact that it
deals with food profiteering.
The character created by Mr. Kee
nan is that of nn unscrupulous, un
principled man, whose one law is "Sue
ii'ss and let nothing stand in its way,"
who says: "God is a Myth." Through
t lie intensely dramatic story he almost
1'iovfs his point; always he seems
arable of winning. "For when one
plays for hiifh stakes, when one Must
win, he nlays with loaded dice," he
says. Then at last Is a seen, the
gripping power of which cannot be
described, he dies with these words
on his lips: "I lose; there is a God."

' eyer, if the military man should find
them physically fit. there is no doubt
that the three lawyers, severally and
collectively, could argue their way
into the camp.
Mr. Casey, who has been visiting
Mr. Pickett at Douglas, accompanied
him here yesterday, and while here
called upon Mr. Wright. When inter
viewed, the three expressed the desire
to invest in the person of one Uncle
Samuel, all rights, title and freehold
in themselves, their persons, their
live3, future estate, regardless of con
ditions of servitude imposed. Further,
deponent saith, all were willing to pass
through the travail of the training
camp, running their risk of emerging
with no higher rank than that of col
one! and each doubtless will be satis
fied to return to his home community
with no higher rank than that of ma
jor general when the war shall have
ended.
While here Mr. Casey was greeted
warmly by many friends made during
his residence in Bis!ee while in the

IN THE NAVY.
W. L. Williams, recruiting officer
for the navy, reports the following
who have enlisted in the navy and
will leave this week: W. Long, J. T.
Kin sella. P. S. Mutler, J. C. Delmasso,
and W. Velh. as seamen; F. P. Black
more, electrician; C. A. Stervm and
M F. Macauly, machinists; B. E. Kane,
and J. D. Lowrey, carpenters, and C.
E. Archulate, yeoman.
DaviJ F. Johnson, jr.. son o state
treasurer Johnson, formerly a Doug
las lad, is now in the United States
navy having enlisted when but seven
teen years old. Young Johnson was
assigned to the cruiser St. Louis and
before his eighteenth birthday made
three trips across, his boat acting as
convoy to a large fleet of- transports.
Fred, as he is known to his Douglas
friends, was. at one time a carrier on
the Daily International and carried the.
route lying across the border during
the troublous days of the Jted Lopez!
capture of Agua Prieta and he only
missed -delivering his paper one even
ing during that time, says the Douglas
Daily International.
He wjiteg of many thrilling experi
ences to his father. Among them the
sighting of submarines on one of his
trips and the rapid darting back and
forth of his boat among the transports,
in throwing smoke bombs' which com
p'etcly covered the fleet with a pall
of smoke in a very short time, thus
biding them from the enemy.
Young Johnson has the same spirit
as of all our boys in the the army and
navy and that is the desire to ''swat
the kaiser."
His address- is V. S. S. St. Louis,
care of postmaster New York City and
he would be pleased to hear from any
of his Douglas friends.

A definite program for sugar savin;;
in the households of Arizona during
the present serious sugar shortage,
was issued yesterday by Thomas A.
Riurdan, federal fjod administrator
for Arizona. If. these restrictions arc
followed out the housewife will find
that the new two-pound per person al
lowance, effective August 1. will ue
sufficient for all her ordinary table
and cooking needs, it was stated.
.1. IX) not use more than one level
teaspoonful of sugar or its equivalent
in lump form for all purposes for each
adult member of the household fcr
each meal.
2. Do not allow children to help
themselves; serve them just enuurh
to sweeten their fruits or cereals.
3. Substitute honey, syrups and
molasses in cooking and baking.
4. Use Liberty candies made of .'
syrups, glucose, and honey instead of
the more expensive sweet3 and Lon
bons. '
Watch Sugar Bowl
"Unless the sugar bowl is carefully
watched during the next few months,"
said Mr Riordan, "the great American
sugar barrel will be empty before new
stocks can arrive."
"It is necessary to conserve sugar
during these canning months," he ad
ded, for the following reasons:
"We need the ships which bring su
gar from a distance to this countryfor
carrying men and supplies to Europe.
" Some of the countries closest to
us raising sugar have a small yield
this year.
"Our own -domestic sugar crop is
smaller than usual.
"The submarines have sunk 50,000,
000 pounds of sugar during the last
few weeks.
"The available supply of sugar until
the tirst of the 'year has been figured
and the two-pound allowance is based
on this figure, with the exception
that there will be a slight surplus fcr
canning."
The food administration again call
ed attention to the fact that dealers
are not permitted to sell sugar for
canning purposes except on permits
issued by the county food adminis
tration or his authorized deputy.
