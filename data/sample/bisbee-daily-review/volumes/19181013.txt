BASEL, Oct. 12. lie trend of
feeling in certain quarters in Ber
lin is indicated by articles ap
pearing in the Lokal Anzeiger and
the Deutsche Tages Zeitung. Both
these papers assert that Germany
is in nowise disposed to evacuate
conquered territory without com
pensation. UNDATED WAR LEAD. (By the
Associated Press.) uermany de
clares itself ready to comply with
the propositions of the president of
the United States, with respect to the
evacuation of occupied territory, and
in this associates itself with Austria.
Dr. W. Solf, the newly appointed
foreign secretary, in replying to Pres
ident Wilson's recent note, accepts
the terms laid down by President
Wil6on in his recent addresses "on
the foundation of a pertuanent peace
of Justice." Future discussions, the
reply asserts, would be for the pur
pose of agreeing upon the application
of these terms.
The resent German government, it
gays, assumes the responsibility for
this step tftward peace and has the
support of the great majority .of the
" reichstag.
t The imperial chancellor, declares
the note, spe-.xks in the name of the
German eovemment and of the Ger
man peonle. The president of the
United States, it is suggested, may
occasion a meeting cf a mixed com
mission to make arrangements for
the evacuation.
The Anelo-American forces on the
southerly s'de of the great wedge that
has been thrust into the lines south
east of Valenciennes are halting mo
mentarily before an extemporized
German defense line running from
Valenciennes to the Oise.
Both t the north and south of this

FORE EYES OF PUBLIC
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK. Oct. 12. President
Wilson, commander-in-chief of the
American army and navy, marched
today at the head of the American
forces in the Columbus-Liberty day
parade, one of the most impres
sive and inspiring spectacles New
York has ever seen.
Under a canopy formed by the
flags cf the 22 nations arrayed
against autocracy and with squadrons
of American airplanes hovering over
head, the president strode with 25.00H
fighting men from five continents and
islands in every sea, over the entire
three-mile line of march along the
"Avenue of the Allies." Then, at the
foot of Fifth avenudj, beside the
Washington arch, he took his place
in an automobile and reviewed the
long column.
The spectators, whose number the
police estimated at more than a mil
lion, never ceased cheering. From
the minute they caught slsht of the
shining silk bat which proclaimed the
approach of the nation's chief execu
tive until they lost sight of it in the
distance, the men and women who
lined the avenue and sought a van
tage point on every housetop hardly
paused for breath: It seemed as if
the city had gone mad.
In according Mr. Wilson with what
probably was the greatest ovation a
president of the United States had
ever received men threw their hats
into the air and yelled themselves
hoarse, while babies were hoisted on
their father's shoulders that they
might tell, in the years hence, of the
day they saw the president march.
Women clapped their hands frantical
ly and embraced strange men in an
exuberance of joy, while small boys
broke through the police lines to get
a better view of the nation's leader.
It was the second time the presi
dent had marched in a parade down
Fifth avenue, but when he opened
the last Red Cross campaign he head
ed a great army of mercy, while to
day he led a grim legion of fighting
men and behind them, dragged by
motor trucks and tractors, great guns
wrested from the Germans. It wag a
stern procession, typifying '"force to
the utmost."
At the head of the line were de
tachments of fighting men represent
ing 22 nationalities. They came from
countries that are fighting to retain

Publication of the German reply to 1
the president's inquiries as to its will

viously enunciated and to evacuate all
occupied territory came ag a complete
surprise. The way in which the wire

all diplomatic precedents.
The text reached New York only a

The natural assumption was that it
previously had been communicated to
the president. As a measure of precau

house an inquiry to Secretary Tu-

been informed of the German reply.
Mr. Tumulty showed plainly his
amazement and replied that Mr. Wil

The reply was sent immediately to
the box where the president was seat
ed with Colonel E. M. House, his close
friend and trusted advisor. It was
read with most intense interest. Soon
thereafter Secretary Tumulty disap-
peared and it was assumed he was lu !

dent faced the stage and looked down
upon the audience.
As the party took their seats tho
splendid orchestra played the "Star

the audience, and the great auditorium

If the president was stirred by the

BRITISH NOT
IMPRESSED BY
PEACE NOTE
REPLY REACHES LONDON
LONDON, Oct. 12. The reply of
the German government to President
Wilson's note was forwarded to Wash
ington at noon today. The text was
made public here this evening.
In brief, Germany accepts the terms
laid down by President Wilson for the '
foundation of a permanent peace of
justice. It declares itself ready to!
comply with the president's proposals ,
for the evaluation of occupied terri j
tory. I
It suggests that the president mayi
occasion a meeting of a mixed com-'
mission to make arrangements for the'
evacuation, and says that the present!
government which has the support of,
the majority of the reichstag, has un-'
dertaken responsibility for this step;
towards peace. j
The text of the German note as !
given out In London is identical with !
that given cut at Washington.
In the south. General Petain's
armies and the Americans under Gen
eral Pershing have struck renewed
heavy blows apainst the German left
in the great pocket formed by the
German posiiicus from Verdun
around the Laon curve to the sea.
The Chemin Des Dames no longer
stands as a bulwark for Laon in the
Aisne region and to the east in the
Champagne the French, by a swift
advance of from three to four miles
in a day. have entered Vouziers and
carried their line so far north that
the communications between the Ger
man northern armies and those east
of the Champagne bid fair to be cut.
On the extreme allied right in the
active battle area the American first
srmv Is keeping up its hammering
tactics and daily gaining more of the
most valuable ground remaining to
the Germans in northern France
that protecting their communicating
lines from the home soil through the
Met7 and Montmedy regions.
But the Germans, although they are
in general on the retreat, by no
means are yet in a state of broken
resistance. This is shown by the
desperate fight they are giving the
Americans from the Argonne to the
Meuse. by the Mand they appear to
he about to make before Field Mar
shal Fcch's army south of Valencien
nes and by the persistence with which
they are clinging to their positions
around Lacn. although doubtless
aware of the peril to which thy are
exposing their large forces in this
area bv so doing.
Douai and perhaps Lille, they seem
to have prepared themselves to give
up. Hut they are still holding on to
most of Belgium as well as to the
Laon pocket and are throwing every
thing they can possibly mass into the
effort to keep their vital left Hank
north of the Verdun area protected.

advanced some four miles and 'made sub
stantial gains. The Hun still holds Douai
and Laon in spite of the threat cf being
caught in a pocket, and he is resisting fur
ther r.dvances of the allies east of Cambrai
and St. Quentin. This procession that
some people fondly think is on the way to
Berlin is only on advance of some ten miles,
all teld.
American soldiers fought three weeks to
advance two miles west, between the Meuse
and the Arg'onne, and they face a hotter
fire and a harder line than ever now. But
will they lie down and quit? Will they?
Has Prince Max hypnotized them? He
has not. But the American people, facing
the fourth Liberty loan, seem to lag and lin
ger and loiter on the way. THIS WAR IS.
YET TO WIN, and every Yank on the bat
tle line knows it. This entire nation has
six months more of terrible effort and sac
rifice to make before it will have an army
in the field cf France strong enough to really
smash the Germans and follow up a victory
with a strcke that shall bring disaster. Thu
is true as gospel writ. Oh, that short
sighted, thoughtless, careless, easily over
wrought people could be brought to see it.
Any man who closely studies a war mar'
along with the daily dispatches in his hand
knows it well. Unless we can yet bring
disaster to the Ludendorff forces before
winter, we will have to drive against at
least two million men in arms under this
' keen, resourceful and most able commander
next spring. Better face this fact now and
strive now, if you wish to win next year.
Some people are inclined not to take the
epidemic of influenza that is now ravaging
the country at large seriously enough, while
others take it too seriously. In other words,
there are some who are careless and indif
ferent of this disease, failing to take even
ordinary precautions against it, while others
are so nervous and frightened about it that
they get into a mental condition wherein
they are liable to fall an easy victim. There
is the middle ground of common sense and
practical precaution. This epidemic is not
to be taken lightly. It has swept from the
Atlantic to the Pacific coast in an incredibly
short time, claiming a quarter of a million
victims and a death toll of more than ten
thousand. Strong young men with the best
care and medical attendance in the best
hospitals in the land have died from this
disease. On the other hand, probably eighty
per cent of the cases have been light and
easily and quickly yielded to treatment. The
disease is now raging in Arizona, especi
ally in the northern part cf the state. The
head of our state board of health wires to
he Bbbee city physician from Winslow,
where twenty deaths have resulted from
some two hundred cases, urging him to
take every precaution and to urge upon the
people cf the district their earnest co-operation
to check this malady. Only by the
aid and intelligent effort of every one can
the disease be checked. Care, courage and
caution are three mighty fine preventatives.
S
That Roulers sector up in Belgium has
been quiet for ten days. It is here that the
next great blow is sure to fall, for Foch
will never allow the big gain into the enemy
lines at this point to go for nothing. It is
from Roulers and Menin southeast that
allied bayonets will drive the Germans from
the Lille line, where it is reported they will
try to hold for the winter. Again, only by
the development of the Roulers success will
the allies be able to close up the Belgian
submarine bases for the winter. The sub
marine has been very troublesome lately.
Big ships are being sunk with heavy loss of
lite these days with monotonous regularity.
The Belgian submarine bases MUST be
taken this'fall. Thus will the Hun have to
depend upon his frozen North Sea ports
alone for U-boat activities all winter. Con
sider, therefore, the Belgian sector, for it
is the most important on the long battle
line right now. .
Again this column would call attention
to the false impression created by the head
lines and bulletins that continually an
nounce the foe "in full retreat all along the
line." Turning to its big map Saturday
morning, this column found about a half
mile gain in all the Cambrai front to cover
this grand march of the allies eastward.
Further souih. in the Champn-zn? secto",
it found that General Gouraud had really
Has the German imperial policy changed
any under pressure, desertion and defeat?
Is the Hun repentant as he asks for peace?
Consider the murder of some hundreds of
t Americans on board that torpedoed 'ship
' rriis last week as an answer. The shiD was
sinking and .these men and women were
turning to life rafts and beats for safety and
they wei e murdered by shrapnel fire as they
fled. Consider also the burning of every
French village and city and farmhouse as
'the Hun is forced back in France. Con
sider the robbers retreating, laden with
every species of plunder and spoil from a
candlestick taken from a church altar to
a little girl's doll cradle and dresses. Con
sider the driving of Belgian and French citi
zens like cattle, away from their homes and
into German slavery. Same Hun! In fact,
he is worse. It is feared by allied leaders
who are in touch with the battle front that
he will commit worse and greater crimes of
murder, destruction and loot than ever he
has committed before. And so our work
is yet to do. We have still to smite this
beast Jiard enough and long enough o
make him loosen his clutch on the best
things that humanity holds dear today.
Those Americans of the "Lost Battalion"
in the Argonne forest began to eat oak
leaves cn the third day, but they still held
out and replied to German demands to
surrender with the well known, emphatic
and for from polite American expression,
"Go to h 1!" These Americans of the
tewns end farms of the United States are
eating three "squares" every day and hold
in?: cut agairnst the fourth Liberty loan
salesmen and salesladies, thus making a
far different reply to the German demand
to give up- the war half won by letting the
loan drag and die. How do you suppose
those gallant boys of that "Lost Battalion '
would feel if the 'word were sent to them
that the folks at home fai.ed on -the loan.
Why should they eat oak leaves and fight
to the end against any edds for usr It is
high time we, too, ate oak leaves, figur
atively speaking, in a final effort to carry
through the Fourth Loan.
Prince Max seeks peace and blandly
swallows all the fourteen conditions laid
down by President Wilson. That is, all ex
cept the voluntary evacuation of any con
quered soil and the giving up of Alsace
Lorraine. Bear this in mind always when
considering the machinations of this kaiser's
clerk. America is pledged heart and soul to
fight until Alsace-Lorraine are restored to
France and every German bayonet clear of
their borders. Whether it be a month or
a year or two years hence, we are pledged
to fight to this fulfillment. Prince Max
has been chancellor only a few days but he
has already emitted more piffle than any
of his many predecessors had been able to
spread in as many months. Beware of this
Prince Max. He was named chancellor to
carry out a specific part. He is to be the
"fence" for stolen goods. To take him seri
ously is to err and to fall into a German
pit.
Germany says she will accept Wilson's
fourteen conditions. Well every one ex
pected her to say this, but WILL she fulfill
iKem Ah. there s the rub. Mow are me
lliVllIf
allies to know? Will she give up Alsace-
Lorraine. Prince Max and the German
papers and officials have declared since the
last German note was sent that they would
not. Nor that they would not leave Russia
and Poland. This exchange of notes with
such a power is dangerous, foolish and full
of complications. Unconditional surrender
is the first, last and only word to Germany.
The Dallas district, of which we are a
part, has raised about one-third of her quota
of the fourth bond issue. Two-thirds of the
way to go yet and half of the time allow

YX'l.v tKfrp is or.lv one." We must double

Life is love, supreme, divine.
In every atom it does fehine
From sands upon the desert plain
To growing gra.- and waving rain
From wonderous world and shining

To sun in b'.;u:uiIoss ether far.
From infant lulled tc sweetest rest
Upon the mother's gentle breast
i.'p to the great Mysterious Cause
T'lut regulates all nature's laws,
All lire is ljve and leve is life.
It soothes to rest all sorrow,' strife.
From highest Heaven and deepest
Hell
And in the human heart to dwell
This wonderous life of love we lind
Frcm tiny bird to human kind.
Life is as eternal as the skies.
And leve, the deathless, never dies.
" 'Till deaih us psrt," we speat it los
Hand clasped in hand and eyes ai-'low.
Oh! words with little nieanini; fraught
Strantce contradiction in the thought!

We will lind no other life save this.
And when we're crossed SeHth's

And cla.-p anuin our loved one's handj.

Stick to Your Trench
Remember, you 've got to stick to your trench
Yes, stick like glue to your trench.
You dig while it's dark, and you work while it's light.
And then there's the "listening post" at night.
Though you're soaked to the skin and chilled to the bone;
Though your hands are like ice, and ycur feet like stone;
Though your watch is long, and your rest is brief,
And you pray like hell for the next relief;
Though the wind may howl, and the rain may drench,
Remember you 've got to stick to your trench
Yes, stick like mud to your trench.
Perhaps a bullet may find-its mark,
And then there's a funeral after dark;
And you say, as you lay him beneath the sod,
A sportsman's soul has gone to his God.
Behind the trench, in the open ground,
Th ere's a little cross and a little mound;
And if at your heart-strings you feel a wrench,
Remember, he died for his blooming trench
Yes, he died like, a man for his trench.
There's a rush and a dash, and they're at your wire,
And you open the hell of a rapid fire;
The Alaxims rattle, the rifles flash,
And the bombs explode with a sickening crash.
You give them lead, and you give them steel,
'Til at last they waver, and turn, and reel.
You've done your job there was never a blench
You've given them Hell, and you've saved your trench;
BY GOD YOU'VE STUCK TO YOUR TRENCH!

into defeats? :no Pershing has the
Germans on the run and we are going
to lash the backs of the fleeing enemy
until the victory is complete.
"Pershing needs locomotives and
rails to follow up our victories, and
a part of the money of the fourth Lib
erty loan will be used to send them
to him. It takes American locomo
tives now to keep up with the fleeing
Germans. Let us see to it at home that
the necessary locomotives are provid
ed for the chase. We may as well send
our American soldiers in first clasi
or-.trams to Berlin instead of leavin,
000,000 makes it necessary for us to
consider some of the specific things
that must be done to win success.
Many families, lor instance, think they
have done their full duty when the
head of the family subscribes for
bonds, but the head of the faintly has
not done his full duty unless he has
bought all of the bonds he can pa
for immediately and in the near fu
hut he was not around. They invited
us to have pancakes, which we ac
ceptedthey are the first I have hau
since leaving home.
"I don't believe it is possible to con
ceive what a 20.000 bed hospital
! means. We furnish bicycles to tue
I nurses, because the distances are so
1 great and it saves them many steps.
: The Red Cross established carreers,
' recreation huts and other comforts for
! the patients, and help the doctors and
! nurses in getting conveniences which
i they wculd otherwise be obliged to f o
without.
j "You have no idea of the difficulty
! in making progress when everything
1 is so hard to get. Stenographers and
chauffeurs are scarce. At present
th?re are plenty of Ford automobiles,
, but not enough men to set them up. It
I is hard to get em ugh typewriters for
! the stenographers.
"We cannot purchase iscre than 50..
francs worth at a time without getting
permission of the A. E. F., and if i:
is 10 JO francs we also have to get pi
mission from the French authouties
j and it takes time sometimes two oi

tthem to do more. They are just as pa
triotic as any other class cf our peo
ple, but they must give a practical
demonstration of It in the fourth Lib
erty loan. Why should the well to do
and rich men and corporations hesi
i tate to buy bonds on the installment
j plan, if they have not the ready cash,
I when people or small means are do
ing so.
"A few days ago I took the sub
scription or thet president of the
United States for $20X00 of Liberty
bonds on the installment plau. The
resident, the commander-in-chief of
he army and navy, doFs 1ut feel d'!
neaned by buying liberty bonds on
he installment p;an. He knows the
.-".portance of dr.in;r it and he knows
'.hat this war cannot be financed un
'ess people use their credit as well as
"heir savings. The president is go
'ng to pay for his Liberty bonds out
if his salary" as it comes to him
monthly, and every ether man anl
woman and every corprn.tion in the
United StatCM should buy all the Lin
rty bonds taey car. just as the presi
ient has done and pay for them out
of their salaries or their incomes on
the instalment plan.
"Counties, cities and school dis
tricts throughout the country must
realize that it is in the. highest de
cree a duty t.f patriotism as well as
a matter of intelligent self-interest, to
invest their funds in Liberty bonds.
Great sums of money are accumu
'ated in this country for sinking
'unds.
"The same thing must be said or
"states and trust runds generally.
Let every trustevj or such runds
awaken to his duty and promptly in
vest the funds under his control in
he' bonds of the fourth Liberty loa;i.
"When the third Liberty loan was
offered, the Germans had pushed
heir lines in a great circle westward,
so that they were in shelling distance
if t!ie city of Paris. Never were the
"berties of the world in such peril
as at that time. But ss soon as we
--ansformed those Liberty bonds into
fighting Americans on the front and
:nto the munitions and supplies those
fighting men nee Jed, we began to
make dents in the German circle, and
now we are pushing in eastward to
ward Berlin instead of tho Germans
pushing in westward toward Paris.

condition s here from influenza makes
me say, take every precaution, close
all meetings, schools and churches

yards, ponds and outhouses, investi
gate dairies and water supply.
"I recommend strictly personal
cleanliness.
"I recommend spraying nose and
throat twice daily with some oil anti
septic.
"Treatment of influenza vaccine in
three cases appeared effective.
"I recommend patients stay in bed
absolutely until thoroughly well, as
pneumonia cornea with relapse, and
nearly 60 per cent of pneumonia cases
here proved fatal. Eighteen deaths

Globe Record Remarks Pertinently Upon the Heavy Increase
Made in the Assessment This Year by the State Tax Com
. mission, Which Does Not Represent Wholly the Growth of
the Industry; Figures Show Increase Made of More Than
Ninety Millions From Last Year on Producing Properties
(From the Globe Record)
The assessed valuation of Arizona's producing mines for the fiscal year
1918-1919, as fixed by the state tax commission, amounts to $421,903,854, an
increase of more than $90,000,000 over the valuation of the preceding year.
These figures may be taken as indicating the growth of the mining industry,
but this in fact is but partially true. In their larger significance they show
conclusively a determination on the part of the state taxing power, and
which apparently has become a fixed policy, to compel the mining industry
to contribute a larger and ever-increasing proportion of the revenues for
the support of state and county governments.
The figures above quoted cover only the valuation of the producing mines
In the state. To arrive at the total valuation of all properties classed under
the head of the mining industry, there must be added the valuations for taxa
tion plated upon non-producing mines and other properties, which are directly
connected with those mines, including mining supplies, etc., which largely
increase the total.
A striking presentation of figures representing the total valuation or the
property of the mines and mining industry of Arizona for the six years from
and including 1912-13 to 1917-1S. in pyramid form, was given in a late num
ber of the Arizona Tax Payers' Magazine. Briefly, it shows that the valua
tion of mining property of all descriptions which in 1912-13 was $43.145,0S4.49
had in 1917-18 become $393,421,536.60. an increase since Arizona became a
state of 873 per cent. In 1912-13 Uie valuation, for taxation of all mining
property was 31.7 per cent of the total valuation of all property of every de
scription in the state, while last year the mining industry was called upon to
pay 56 per cent of the total.
'We are not iu' lined to be as charitable as the Taxpayers' Magazine, when
it says: "It is not with the intention of raising any question as to the fairness
of action by the assessing officers that any comparison as between different
classes of property is made, or suggested. The most that is intended to bring
to the minds of our readers is the ultimate fact which is shown by the actual
figures given. The ultimate fact is the actual important place which the
mining industry of the state of Arizona has in the financial affairs of the
State.

Late last week it was learned that
on the 10th the Grand Island had
just put a full shift to work and within

Directors at Recent Meeting in
Prescott Decide on Import
ant Extentions in Equip
ment
Following is a list of forty-five mining stocks and Uie investment return
on the present market prices and current dividend rates, together with the
amount earned per share, etc As is to be expected the market prices of the
leading copper issues show a return on the Investment with a variation of ap
proximately 2 per cent, says the Boston Financial Review.
Anaconda at 6S shows a return of the investment of 117, ; Utah Copper.
12r; ; American Smelting. 12'i ; Calumet & Arizona. 11.S7 ; Copper Range.

13.2Cr:-Cranby, 13'; ; Old Dominion, 9.5';; United States Smelting. 12.2',. and
Allouez. 12';.
All these companies may be rated as Investment coppers with dividends
assured for the indefinite future. Then there is another class of cfDDTs
whose current market prices indicate expectation of better developments in
I the not distant future and are selling at prices returning a lower yield than
the companies whose rutures are known wore definitely. Among these is
Isle Royale, which at 26 shows a return of 7.7r on a $2 annua basis, although
recently the company paid 50 cents extra, so that the actual yield is just over
S';. North Butte also sells at the low yield of 6.6'; on the expectation that
tJie dividends will be increased this fall. United Verde Extension also shows
a low yield of 7.5r; on the belief that the future of this company is a bright
one and that the new smelter will result In materially larger dividends.
Another class of coppers sells at a very high return on current distribu-
I tions either because the mines are considered to have the end of their life
(in sight or because of uncertainties. Wolverine, whose life is considered not
a long one. shows a return of 22 2r' ; Greene Cananea. with the uncertain
ties of Mexico, siiows a return of 1S.6'", ; Mohawk, of which there Is some un-
i certainty regarding life shows a, return or 13.S'; ; Arizona Commercial, he
! cause of the development stage, shows a yield of 14. 3. and Utah Consolidated,
j the company which reiwrts small ore "reserves in sight each year but con
! tinues to pay dividends, shows a return on the Investment of 20T-.
Inspiration, selling at 35 and showing a return of 14.5r on an $8 divi
dend basis .seems to be selling out of line with the possibilities of the mine
jand dividends.' Willi lar?e ere reserves in siahtand one of the lowest cost
! producers in the. country, thrre is every reason to believe that this coni
I pany will maintain th $S pr annum rate as long as Ana,conda and the 1
payment of the Utah Copper. Yet the stock sells on an income basis
higher than the latter and 2.7'; higher than the former. As compared with
Anaronda the current price of Inspiration seems to be too low and in fact too
low as compared with any of the other leading copper stocks, Uie list of which

from the previous month, was iu allji
respects satisfactory in view of the tin- i
settled conditions. In Auuust Miami;
shattered all monthly outpuls with a I
total of 5.379,000 pounds, so that the I
decrease last month does not loom up
so larsse. This niakes the faurth month
this year that the company h:is pro
duced more than S.ono.iiiiO pounds,
with the other five running substan
tially ahead of 4.000.000.
Compared with the corresponding
month of last ypar. September shows
an incre?so of more than 3.1'io.ono
pounds. This abnormal gain was di
rectly due to the fact, that Miami was i
only beginning to iii(rei.s its output l-, . pi rpi .
after the disastrous sirik? which start- Comparison Shows 1 hat in
ed in Jure, and which was not settled
until the latter part of August.
For the nine months of the current
year Miami has produced a total of
44.27S.O0O pounds as compared with
approximately 32.000.000 pounds in
the same period of 1917, an increase
of more than 12.000 oo. Should the
compr.ny be able to manufateore the
average monthly output for the last
three months as in the first nine,
which seems probable, total produc
tion for the full year should run over
59.000,000 pounds, and incidentally
would be a new hih mark for Mituni.
This would compare with slightly
more than 43.0'io.ono pounds vtnortcd
for 1917. an Increase of approximately
16.000.000.
This ' Increased production comes
at a most opportune time as operating
costs have, been sharply increased sis a
result of increased wages to employes,
and abnormal csts for materials and
supplies. Last year it cost th com
pany 8.54 cents a pound to produce its

KING MAN. Ariz.. Oct. 12 J. M.
Crowther of the Arizona Imtte Min
ing company, arrived from the east
Tuesday niht. where he had been in
conferet ce with the people having the
financing of the company in rand.
He reports that the work of getting
the finances of the corporation in
shape to becin the driving of the tun
nel under the gridiron of veins is so
far advanced that work will be re
sumed as soon as the necessary sup
plies can be forwarded to the camp.
The driving of this big tunnel
means much to Kinsman and to
I ble the employment of many hun
i dreds of miners and tributers. The
draining of the area will aid in the
opening of the other properties and
allow of shipment of gold, silver, cop
per, lead and zinc ores to the smelt
ers. Stockton Hill has always been
one of the richest sections of the Wal
lapai district, but the sinking of
shafts below the water level has made
the extraction of ore an expensive
proposition. With the tunnel carried
into the mineralized area and cross
cutting of the country all the rich
veins will be available to the miner
and costs will be cut in two. TWO
THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY, OCTOBER 13, 1918.
COPPER CONFERENCE
MAY BE CALLED IN
WASHINGTON SOON
IMPRESSION ABROAD IN TRADE
THAT MEETING BETWEEN COk
PER INTERESTS AND PRICE
FIXING COMMITTEE WILL TAKE
PLACE THIS WEEK
Although no date has "oeeu set as
yet for the meeting which is to take
place between copper interests and
the price fixing committee of the war
industries board at Washington, it is
the general impression in the trade
that the conference will be called for
some time between the 15th and 20th
of this month, says the Boston Fin
ancial News.
At this meeting the question of the
price to be fixed for sales of the metal
after November 1 will be decided. The
present twenty-six cents per pound
quotation expires on the date men
tioned, and as heretofore just prior to
the time when the question of prices
was to come up, there are many of the
smaller trade Interests who are talk
ing of a higher figure.
Those who are to attend the meet
ing in Washington are already arrang
ing the details which are necessary
prior to their departure, but it cannot
be said that all the copper interests
are agreed that an advance in the quo
tation should be asked for, and it is
definitely known that at least one of
the important trade interests is of the
opinion that there will be no change
in price after November I.
While it is admitted that some ci
the smaller producing companies
could stand an advance at present
because of the increasing costs in ex
penses of operating, it is pointed out
that many of the leading companies
are doing fairly well under the 'War
circumstances. However, it is likely
that 'representatives of the high cost
producers 'iH attend the Washington
conference and put up their argu
ments in favor of additional relief.
The buying of copper for war pur
poses continues on a large scale, and
is absorbing the entire supply now in
the hands of the dealers. As a mat
ter of fact some additional orders have
been placed for delivery during No
vember and December, with the price
to be paid being left open until an
announcement is made from Washing
ton late this month as to the new
figure.
It is stated in the trade, however,
that the future business of the past
week was not as large as previously,
probably to the fact that those who
were anxious to cover their require
ments had been satisfied, and the oth
ers are willing to wait until later be
fore making contracts for their needs.
As heretofore no refined copper is
available for cutside consumers, and
the sellers are cot taking any con
tracts except those having priority j
rights of requisitions from the proper
government authorities. These priority"!
orders and requisitions can oniy be ob
tained by those doing war work.
Production figures which have come
to hand thus far for September have
shown decreases from the August
totals. The Anaconda Copper Mining
company, the Miami Copper company
and the Phelps Dodge Corporation
combined recorded a Iofs of about
5,000.000 pounds. The greater part
of this drop is attributed to the labor J
situation, the loss of 3,100,000 pounds
by the Anaconda alone being due to a
strike which was called by the I. W. I
V. but which has since been set-1
tied. j

patriotic motives play a considerable
pat; otherwise a period of nearer
normal prices for the quantities of
supplies required would be awaited.
The policy of going ahead under the
eyisting circumstances, however, cor
respond with the attitude that has
been maintained since the war by
copper producers generally in the
state in their endeavor to do all pos
sible not only to supply Immediate
metal needs for war purposes but
also to advance reserves of ore as
far as possible against emergency re
quirements that may come up.
Mr. Cole said today that the fi

the only question involved at the
Prescott meeting. While he did not

he intimated very strongly that it had

W. D. GRANNIS IS OPENING
RICH MOLYBDENITE MINES
KINGMAN, Ariz., Oct. 12. W. D.
Grannis and Portirio Noli returned the
first ot the week from the molybdenite
mines in Deluge Wash, where they,
completed the kinking of a fifty foot
winze on one of the Grannis group.
They brought with them samples of
molybdenite and copper ore that look
ed exceptionally good. From appear
ance of the samples we would judge
that another fifty feet would bring the
winze into a much better grade of ore,
as the samples show considerable
leaching.
The group of claims, which were re
cently bonded to California people, is
in one of the best mineralized sections
of Cedar valley district and develop
ment ought to bring in some good pro
ducers. The ore carries values in
molybdenite and copper, and is similar
to all the ores along the big Copper
ville dike.

TREATMENT OF
OUNDS TREATED
OF BY EXPERT
Safety Engineer Dickinson
Tells How Injuries Under
ground Should Be Handled
by Men
(By S. C. DICKINSON, Safety Engi
neer V. S. D. M.)
Injuries in which the skin is pierce-'
cr broken are called wounds. Wounds
may be large or small, deep and shal
low, clean and Rharp, or ragged and
dirty, all depending upon the force and
instrument which which they have
beten produced. In every would there
lies the possibilities of infaction by
pus germs, which means that inflama
tion will follow, more or less matter
will form and there will be some ab
sorption of poison from the wound,
which may result in the more severe
forms of blood-poisoning, and almost
inevitable death.
External Germ Infection
These infections are caused by dis
ease germs which get Into the would
from outside sources, such as from
the hands, clothing, rock ore, dust,
etc., or in fact, from any that comet
in contact with the wound.
There are more 'different and origi
nal treatments for wounds than tliere
are types. Some of the wound treat
ments advanced by laymen are very
dangerous. Infection, is caused by
germs which exist on everything and
in everything, tout ithe air exlcept '
when they have been killed by an
antiseptic or by the heat and the fol
lowing are septic, rather than asep
tic. Washing Wounds Dangerous
1. It was a practice in olden times,
and even until recent date, to imme
diately wash wounds with a solution
containing carbolic acid or corrosive
sublimate (bichloride of mercury), or
some antiseptic agent. The idea was,
t!iat in washing the wound it was
cleansed and in the application of a
dilute antiseptic, the germs are usual
ly not strong enough to kill the germs,
and if they were they would also de
stroy the cells of the body, which help
dispose of the pus germs. Experience
has proven that instead of cleansing
the wound, washing more often carries
germs into it. Water is dangerous
as it contains many pus germs.
Menace of Peroxicj
2. Peroxide of hydrogen, common
ly called "peroxide" is especially dan
gerous, as it washes germs into in
fected parts of a wound. Peroxide is
not strong enough to kill the germs
and its use sJiould be strongly con
demned. 3. Cobwebs, chewing tobacco and
waste should never be used, due to the
fact that they contain many pus
germs.
4. The use of plaster must be abso
lutely condemned, for not only does
the plaster seal the wound so that any
germs within will be in most favorable
position to increase in numbers, but
is, itself most likely to be covered
with pus germs.
o. Germs have no chance to escape
when the wound has been sealed with
collodian, therefore it should not be
used.
Cloth is Taboo
6. Covering a wound with any piece
of cloth is not the proper treatment.
7. A cut finger should not be put
into the mouth as the would will then
be subject to contamination.
Exposure to the air is much safer
than the application of anything which
is not surgically clean or antiseptic.
Nature Is Chief Physician
Treatment of open wounds is simple,
but must be done with some intelli
gence. Nature is the chief physician
whose aid never fails if due attention
is paid to her laws. When a wound
is made blood immediately makes its
appearance, and in this blood, or ser
um, is nature's first application of an
antiseptic. The living blood has a
certain resistance to infectious germs.

but the dying blood, such as that
which escapes from a wound and clots
upon the surface, is many times more
destructive of germ life, than the liv
ing; the escaping blood also rids the
wound of germs by washing them out,
and the cells of the body are able to
destroy many others. We should con
clude then, that every wound is not
infected by pus germs and must use
every care not to infect it with our
hands, by water, dressings, or any
thing else. '2(L&
The ProDer Treatment
The first aid treatment of a wound
consists of the following:
A. Place the patient in a safe and
comfortable position.
B. Remove the necessary clothing
in order to inspect the wound.
C. Control the flow of blood, either
by pressure or position. In ninety
nine cases out of a hundred, exposure
to the air, or the pressure of the
dressing is all that is necessary to stop
bleeding. '
D. If the wound contains grease,
flush out with a solution of one part
iodine to nine parts benzine or gaso
line. Use Dry Dressing
E. Apply a dry, antiseptic or sterile
dressing, being very careful not to
touch any part of the dressing that
is going to touch the wound, and hold
it in place with a. triangular bandage.
If iodine can be obtained (3Vs per
cent solution) apply it to the injury
and surrounding skin, allow to dry,
then put on the dressing. Do not soak
the dressing with iodine. Iodine is
100 per cent efficient if used within
thirty minutes after a wounded is re
ceived. F. Treat shock.
G. Send the patient to a doctor.
Trivial Injuries Subtle Danger
The severe injury nearly always re
ceives immediate surgical attention;
it la the small injury nothing but a
scratch which usually causes infec
tion, and causes Uie pathicnt tempor
ary disability or the loss of a limb,
cr even lite. Seventy-eight per cent
of all the cases of infection result from
seemingly trivial injuries.
JOHN WOLF TELLS
HOW HE SHATTERED
ALL FORMER RECORDS
VETERAN SHIPBUILDER AND
CHAMPION GENERAL FOREMAN
RIVETER OF WORLD TELLS HIS
METHODS OF PROCEDURE IN
GREAT CONTEST
"Before the American troops over
yanler make a drive on the Ilun they
make careful preparations days in ad
vance. I follow the same principle in
getting ready for a riveting drive."
So spoke John Wolf, veteran ship
builder, and champion general fore
man riveter of the world, who on Fri
day, September 13th, swept all past
riveting records into the discard at
the Hog Island shipyard. .
The record for the entire yard on
that day wa 192,242 rivets in eight
hours; or thirty-eight rivets per houi
per production gang. But the record
of Wolf and his forty-three produc
tion gangs in yards No. 7 and 8, tower
ed over the work of all other gangs in
the mammoth shipbuilding plant.
His gangs drove 19.037 rivets, or an
average per hour of fifty-five rivets
Wolf also has supervision over two
school gangs who drove 503 rivets or
an average per hour per gang o!
thirty-one rivets.
Wolfs achievement is considered of
vital importance to every shipyard in
the United States. In all yards speed
is one of the prime esentials in the
building of ships. The faster ships
are turned out, the quicker will the
allies bring the war to a victoriaus con
clusion. In the Hog Island yard Wolf
has been confronted with conditions
which are prevalent in every yard in
the country. He has swept aside all
handicaps and whipped into shape the
speediest riveting gang in the world.
There is a feeling that his methods
could be adopted with splendid results
by every yard in the country.

' his time he has had a hand In the
building of between seventy and eighty
i steel-riveted ships, many of them have

! nels of ocean commerce for a score
! or more of years. He is a small dark
! complexioned man with face leathered
j by years of work in the open, but his
j brown eyes burn imperishable fires
I of energy. He began as a heater boy
I when fourteen years old in the famous
j shipyard of John Roach at Chester, Pa.
He became successively driller, ream
! er, and riveter, and during his last
' twelve years at the yard he was in
entire charge of the ways,
j. In 190S he went to the Boston Navy
Yard where he served as a quarter
I man for more than ten years. While
I'oston he built fuel ships, target boats
and coal barges for the United States
Government, and did a lot of repair
work.
When this country entered the big
war and Uncle Sam needed a great
merchanth marine in the shortest kind
of notice. Wolf became one of the
most prized men in the United States.
He knows most everything there is to
know about building ships. He is ad
mittedly one of the great shipyard's
powerful driving forces. In addition
to being a competent shipbuilder, he
is a natural leader of men.
"Riveters," he said, "were as scarce
as monkey wrenches in a parlor when
Uncle Sam opened the ball in the ship
building game. We've had to make
'cm, that's all.
"Every one of my forty-three gangs
of riveters were as green as fresh
pine only a short time ago. I got 'em
frcm the training schol which has been
established in the yard by the indus
trial relations group. United States

and I want to say right now there are
no better .working ; buddies in the
world. Any time of day or night 111
stack my huskies against the cream of I
the famous . Scottish yards on the
Clyde.
"What is the secret of the success
of my gangs? Well it's as simple as
the nose on your face. The first thing
I do is to put my huskies next to the
big idea In the shipbuilding game. I
'lammer it into their heads that every
rivet they drive is equal to a stout
nail into the coffin of that arch child
murder, the kaiser. In other words.
I make their part in this war game
so real that they pound rivets like'
the boys over across pump machine
guns.
"To hit the hull's eye in a riveting
drive, you've got to prepare for it like
the Y'anks arrange for a drive asainst
the Huns on the western front. When
General Pershing gets it into his head
that he wants to give the Hun a good
hard bump he takes a few thousand
, Yank huskies back of the line, and
I puts them through a stiff course of
sprouts in the way of intensive train
ing. When the boys have completed
the course they are as hard as steel
nails and they can made through any
thing. "I lined things up for my drive in
much the same way. When things op
ened op I had the holes all reamed and
the proper tools all in place. So when
the drive started we had a whirlwind
start, and the way we walked away
from the other gangs was good to see.
"According to my way of figuring
this thing called morale is blamed im
portant in any game. I don't care a
rap whether it's soldiering or driving
rivets, you've got to have the boys
mentally and physically up to snnff. I
aim to keep my huskies standing right
up on their toes most of the time. In
the respect of keeping the boys in a
fighting mood, I am aided by my boss
riveter, Joe Diamond, who has been
in the game for more than twenty
years, and has worked in shipyards ail
lover the country. How about it Joe?"
. Wolf turned to a stockily-built mar.
in soiled overalls and jumpers who
stood nearby.
Joe shifted bashfully from one fcto
to another, and said:
I "I try to do my bit, boss," he said,
i "but all of us would go to 11 for you,

j Wolf grinned pridefully.
j "You see the spirit of my huskies,
don't you?" he said. "Why when the
drive was the hottest even our super
intendent, Walter Blandford, got the
fever. He chucked off his coat, grab

rivets. My hoskies have the spunk

in Bisbee fully recovered after the
war.
Mr. Shirck, physical director of the'
"Y," has been busy helping install
equipment in the Junior high at War
ren, during the quarantine.
Messrs. Philbrook, Flynn, Potter,
Bowles. Hatter, Safford, Blohm, Hahn
and Shirck of the "Y" and public
schoois are off for a well earned rest
and a hunting trip, while the quar
antine is on. While some of them can
shoot at deer, others of them, not be
ing citizens of Arizona, must be con
tent with shooting at cotton-tails or
jack-rabbits.

in making candy represents a very
small fraction Indeed of the total
sugar supply.
Sugar is a fuel. All human beings
require a certain amount of carbo
hydrates. It is a necessity to children
and a valuable food to those who do
hard physical work. The army's de-1
maud for candy is prompted by a '
sound physiological impulse. Good !
candies, manufactured with rummer-j
cial honesty, contain many ingredients
of a hU'h food value, among them Til
ing milk, nuts, fruit, etc.
The food administration has cut
down the use of sugar by candy mak
ers to a minimum, a very, very small
portion of the whole supply, and has
gone about as far in that direction as
economic conditions warrant. We think
work in the bowling alleys is nearing
j completion. Several men have been
j working strenuously on the bowling
: alleys to get them in shape to be
1 used a3 soon as the quarantine Is
1 raised. It is expected that they will
: be made in the very best possible con-
dition. and as far as equipment is con
cerned, will be unequaled by no other
bowling alley in this country. Men
who are interested in bowling, may
look forward with pleasure to the re
i stiniption of that very interesting
game in the very near future,
Owing to the quarantine, the boys'
department is open only one hour each
day from 5 to 6, in order thai the
boys may take their daily bath.
Owing to the quarantine, the activ
ities of the association are somewhat
on a standstill, but the work in all
departments will be taken up lmme-
1 diately after the quarantine. Improve-
I ments in ail departments is under way
and there will be nothing to prevent
the usual program of activities.
Eight boy8 of the boys' department
went out Tuesday night to Lewis
j Springs to enjoy a few days' camping
trip during the quarantine. This num
ber has gradually increased, until now
there are twenty boys at the camp, en
joying country life. It is the desire of
all boys who are there to remain in
Lewis Springs until the quarantine is
raised.
Our friend R. O. Owen has returned
from a hunting trip, and reports that
he bagged all the deer the law allows.
We know he had a good time.
The sympathy of the entire mem
bership of the association is extended
to W. W. Gidley, member of our board
of directors, and a much esteemed and
enthusiastic worker, in the loss of his
brother, who is located in the east.

(By Review Leased Wire)
DALLAS, Tex., Oct. 12. A day or
two ago I was talking to Major Gid
dings of Connecticut, who has seen
much of Europe as a representative
of the United States government and
he told me how he had seem in the
city of Glasgow, Scotland, a long line
of people waiting in two feet of snow
to be the first to offer their subscrip
tion to a British war loan. He spoke
of women standing in this line with
shawls over their beads and babies In
their arms. The very next day there
came to my desk the story of five wo
men half clad and almost starving
who had walked from West Texas to
the east, had found work and out of
gratitude and unalloyed patriotism
had met our war relic train at Victoria
and all five purchased Liberty bonds.
The next day I learned that in one
section the organizer had marshalled
together the war mothers, that Is to
say all those women who have sons
I In the war, and in those cases where
wealthy men flatly refused to do their I
duty by the loan he proposed to sena
committees of these war mothers to
wait upon these men and shame the
subscription from them. This last
piece of information made me shud
der and I asked myself whether it
was possible that in this district cf
ours, which I believe I know so well,
such measures would be necessary.
The conclusion I came to was that
there is no part of this district, and
there is probably not a single indi-
vidual in this district, to whom such I
methods are applicable or necessary. that this new method is designed to

Death a Boon to Czarina and Daughters;
Bolshevik Leaders Inflicted Most Brutal
Torture Previous to Murdering Then
As announced on another page, in-
formation received in this country
leaves no doubt that the ex-czarina of
Russia and her daughters, the Grand
Duchesses Olga, Tatiana. Marie and
Anastasie, have been murdered at
Ekaterinburg, in the Urals, by their

Bolshevist government. It is well
known that the czar was removed and
shot without even the formality of a
trial. It is not so widely known that
scarcely any humiliation was spared
his family.
For weeks before the end the czar
ina, her four daughters, for a time her
son, and two other women, her ladies-in-waiting,
were imprisoned in one
small room.
Day and night they were under the
eyes of their ruffianly keepers, and
only on alternate days were they giv
en just sufficient food to keep them;
alive. The jailers of Mane Antoin
ette in the Conciergerie. who have suf
fered an everlasting infamy for their
brutality, were kindly compared with
these inhuman Bolsheviki.
Over the details of this horrible
crime we cannot linger. Only is there
room for a very deep feeling of thank
fulness that at last the day came when
the longed for death arrived, and the
lifeless bodies of the five Romanoff
women defied forever the cruelty
of the Bolsheviki.
It is difficult to estimate the respon
sibility that" must in part attach itself
to the empress for the troubles both
of her country and herself. We shall
not recall here the steps by which her i
nervous anxiety had been misinter-1

read the worst construction into her !
acts and words. There was a side to
it that should be remembered. The in-;

Consider
WO
Your Compensation to Start
FOURTEEN DAYS
AFTER INJURY or
Four Thousand Dollars or
Half Pay
HALF OF YOUR MONEY
Taken up in Court Costs
and Lawyer's Fees
Amendment Number' 100 will start your compensation seven days after you are injured, instead of fourteen
days as under the present law; will provide a maximum of $8000 for death instead of $4000 under the present
law; will pay you two-thirds of your wages during injury instead of one-half wages under the present law,
and will pay you all of your compensation instead of forcing you to split fifty-fifty with a lawyer.
THINK THESE THINGS OVER. LOOK INTO THE MOTIVES OF
THOSE WHO OPPOSE THE P, ASSAGE OF THE LAW AND YOU WILL
Vote Yes on Amendment 100

Contractor Wouldn't Take
Five Hundred Dollars for
Good Tanlac Did Him
"I just want to say right now that
I wouldn't take $500 for the good that
the first bottle of Tanlac did me, for 1
feel like it has given me a new lease
on life," said C. E. Nelson, a contract- j
ing carpenter living at 7728 63d ave-,
nue. Southeast, Portland, Ore., recent-1
iy.
"Following a serious accident four
mouths ago," he continued, "which
laid me up for eight or nine weeks, I
lost my appetite, and my stomach got
all out of order. What little I did
manage to eat would sour and form
gas, which would cramp and pain me
until 1 could hardly stand it. Then my
kidneys went back on me, and my
back hurt so bad I couldn't tind a
comfortable position. They said I had
rheumatism or lumbago,' then my
right leg, below the knee, got to hurt-
Ling me, and At times I couldn't stand
on my feet or get up when down. I
was constipated all the time and suf
fered a great deal with headache. No
body knows how I really did Euffer,
because I just can't describe it, and
as nothing seemed to do me any good
I had become discouraged about my
condition.
"I finally sent down and got a bot
tle of Tanlac, as I had read so much
about it, and it was about the best in
vestment I ever made. My appetite
came bounding back after my first few
doses, and by the time my second bot
tle was gone, my stomach trouble was
almost gone, too. I am now eating any
and everything I want and it don't
hurt me the least bit, and my kidneys
and back are greatly improved. At
the time I started on Tanlac I had to
use crutches in'order to get about, but
1 don't need them now at all, and have
thrown them aside. I have gained
several pounds in weight, and can just
feel myself getting stronger every day.
I have gone back to work already, and
I never lose an opportunity to speak
a good word for Tanlac."

HALF OF BIG PATRIOTIC BOOST
FOR UNCLE SAM IN THIS FED
ERAL DISTRICT
DALLAS, Tex., Oct. 12. Pvt Ray
mond Jolly of Alabama never made a
speech in iiis life until he went out
with the Liberty loan train. Now he
he has developed into a regular "over
the top" orator with pep and punch
that gets 'em wild. Waving the stump
of an arm, showing the fresh wound
received lit the battle of Chateau
Thierry, Just two months ago, he tells
them how he got the boys over. "The
more boys from your own town will
come back. . I'm going back just as
scon as I help finish this job," he
shouts,' I knew Ive got a bum wing,
but the kaiser's got one too, and I'm
a damned sight better man that he is."
Sst. 1-rank Haley, New York Irish
man, wounded seven times at Cam
paign orator from Waco, tells of
Ualeys remarkable deeds of daring;
of how the Germans took a railroad
away from the American engineers
and how Haley and other Americans
went out in the open in front of Cam
brai and took it back.
"But Haley has never explained how
he got shot twice in the back," says
net"' and Haley comes back with an
honest to goodness explanation of how
an American soldier can get shot in
the back with honor.
"He tells you that I was shot twice
in the back," flashes back Haley in
his rich Irish brogue "but he doesn't
tell 1 was snot live times in iront ai
the same time. Now under them con
ditions I leave it up to you whether
I I was coming or going when that
r.iar.y of t'aem big digs comes at you.
j "Time aud again little school girls
I will pass by and jolly us and th n
I hurry away to hide. A little girl when
j asked why she was crying, said: "I
was thinking aixutt the hoys of our
1 town who will come hack all shot up
1 like Haley and Jolly are. ch, won't
1 people lend the money to stop it all."

(Tn: follow inT article by Siep!iinv
Lausanne, nien'.lier ' French High
t'ommisiton to the I'nitfil States ai:d
editor cf Lc Matin, is froia thf NVw
Yolk Times ) :
Gen. Fiaiuln t UTspcrey, coin man 1-er-in-chitf
of the allied armies in the
Ba'kans. is a happy man. Fortune has
never yi-t ceased to Ftnile on him.
At Charleroi, wh-re I'm French and
Knulish were beaten, he was tho only
a!lie;i gt-neral who won a vutory. He
was then in command of the first army
corps, made up for the greater part of .
men from Liiie and Flanders. August
21 and 22, while the battle was ragine, ,
he was holding the bridges of the
Mcuse at no great distance from Na-1
mur, and it was only touirJ the ev- '
enin? of the 2:?d that his troops
charged. The i.sue ot the battle, how-'
ever, was already decided, and several
allied corps, which 1i;m1 h;id a bad j
start and v.ere in an inferior position j
both as to numbers :':id equipment. ;
were forced back. I
It was left to General Frar.chet j
d'Esperey and to the first army" corps;
to protect the right flank of tiiw ;
Franco-British army, and he achieved j
that formidable task with extraordi-j
nary dash,. Attacking the S.xons,
who were pressing closely upon tiiui, j
he threw them into disorder ad drove
back to the Med.-e a:i enemy division j
wuicn naa sucttccieu in awiug u.e
river. So furious an attack, so va
liant an altitude, were not to be with
stood by the Saxons; they stood as if
hypnotized, and during the night of
the 2:5d and all of the day of the 2ith
allowed the entire French forces to
pass on anmclested, net daring to in
terfere. The enemy commander had to pay a
heavy price for the brilliant work 01
the French general. Yon Hausen, one
of the most famous generals of the
r.ini'.iii litct hid ffmtmnm! nnrl !
some few weeks later was crossed off
the list of that army, the following
reason being Riven :
It was only on August 23 that
Von Hansen's Saxon army crossed
the Meuse. If better plans had
been laid, the crossing of the river
could have taken place much more
quickly. The delay was a contri
butory cause to the failure of the
German army in the beginning of
September, and the German forces $
marching to aid Paris had to be
grouped differently. i
KIRCI1EISEN. !
On the other hand, tho operation 1
brought well deserved promotion to i
Gen. Franchet d'Esperey, sole victor !
of the Charleroi engagements. Foch I
immediately intrusted him with the
command of an entire army the fifth j
made up of the lSih. Zi. 1st and
lOth corps, and a cavalry corps. '
On the Marne. where French and
English were victorious, Kranciiei
d'Esperey, still the favored of fortune,
was the first to via new laurels. He
was holding the line to the north of
Prcvins as far as Sezanne, between
French and Foch. As early as the
morning of September 6, when Joffre
gave his famous order to attack, he
thew himself with extraordinary fury
on tha left wing of Von Kluck's army
and the right wing of Von i'.uelow's
army, which were both facing him. He
pried a wedge between the two armies,
took Esternay at the point of the bay-
-onet, threw into disorder everything
on his passage, and on the Sth entered
Montmirall over a mountain of Ger
man dead. The morning of the 9th his
aviation service signaled that Kluck
and Buelow were retreating. From !
that time all he had to do was to push j
forward. I
To him belongs the glory of having I
been the firt to m:;ke a breach in the
enemy wall. And to him. among all
the illustrious heroes of thr.t immortal
battle, is due the title of first victor.
After this Gen. Franchet d'Esperey
reached the command of army group3
only, that is, he occupied the same
rank as men I ke Foch, C'astelnau.
Fay.-ille. His name is associated with
ail the great operations of the treat
war Summe. Champagne, Aisue.
Fi'.-.aily. in June last, he received a
new command, that of the armies of
the Orient in the Balkans, and eight
short weeks after he landed cl Salon
iki he again covered his name v.iiH
glory, and the victor of the Meiise, the
victor of .Montiiiirali. became the vic
tor of Vardar. He is the first general
to have gained a great victory in the
Balkan theater cf the war, where so
much blood has been shed and where
it almost seemed as though some evil
genius refused to allow the allies a
single success. Hut the charm has
been brtkeu.
So much good fortune is certainly
not the result of pure chance. Gen.
Frar.chet d'Esperey wins victories be
cause he deserves to win them. He
has learned the secret of making the
gods of war smile on him. He is a
tremendous worker and knows how to
make others work. It will doubtless
be related some day how the battle
that has just been won was fought
on the hardest, the most difficult sec
tor of the front a sector where there
are no roads, no depots of equipment,
no heavy artillery; a sector said by
the Bulgarians to le impregnable so
much so that they only maintained a
handful of troops there. In eight weeks
Gen. Franchet d'Esperey has had
roads made, depots installed, heavy
artillery placed in position, and he
has organized the system of communi
cations. September 14 he threw his
Senegalian and colonial battalicns to
the assault of the mountains of Bul
garia, just as he had thrown his regi
ments to the assault of the forests of
Montmirail; he im-de his breach and
through this breach led the allied
forces that for three years had been
marking time on the same mud, con
demned to the same inaction.
Gen. Franchet d'Esperey does not
enly know hew to deal with earth and
cannon; he also Knows how to deal
with men. He can ma!;e his soldiers do
an thing,- because he knows how to
talk to them; he has the ready word
that wins the heart of the trooper and
today it is with the heart as much as
with muscle that battles are won.
There are few chiefs as popular a.i
he i. His men love him, and the
feeling is returned.
For a long time he was a command
ing officer in Algeria, that corner of
Africa which has given such glorious
names to the French army of today
Gouraud, Mangin, Lyautey, Degouttes
and which is at the same time the
cradle of the famous Foreign Legion.
Finally, to all this may be added
that Gen. Franchet d'Esperey is still
young. So fortune is not through with
him yet there are other victories
ahead for him.
