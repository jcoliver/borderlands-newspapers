(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 3.Plans for a
great national service reserve made
up of men not subject to draft into
the army and of women, already ap
proved by the war department, were
submitted to the council of national
defense today at a conference of the
council with state governors and rep
resentatives of state defense councils.
Members of the reserve would be
available for any service they could
perform for the government.
The plans were presented by Geo.
Whaton Pepper, a representative of
the Pennsylvania state defense coun
cil and chairman of a national com
mittee of patriotic and defense socie
ties. Nine Big Men at Head
The reserve would be headed by a
board of nine nationally known men,
which would operate through a na
tional committee of members from all
.-tbe-etates. Under the national com
mittee there would be state and dia
V trict committees, and in Washington
a permanent headquarters committee
would sit to carry on administrative
work.
Membership of the board of
nine has been tentatively accept
ed, it was stated, by former
President Taft, Major General
George W. Goethals and Henry
L. Stlmson, former secretary of
war.
Purpose Most Worthy
..The purpose of the organization
would be to furnish any military or
civil service which could not be per
formed by enlisted men, to aid in re
cruiting, to work under any private
employer engaged on government con
tracts, or on farms and to supply the
army and navy.
When not in active service, reserve
members could aid in borne defense.
They would be given compensation
for time spent in government ser
vice. Real Jobs For All
The defense council today gave
the governors and state repre
sentatives an outline for state
service in the war. They were
told that the state defense coun
cils could do these things:
Promote patriotic spirit and ed
ucate the people to the magni
tude of the task ahead; aid In
resulting the national guard;
assist in carrying out enrollment
for the new army and in deter
m'ning exemptions from draft;
maintain labor standards; estab
lish labor clearing house; assist
in getting workers to use their
"broken time" on the farms; as
sist in getting idle men and boys
to the farms; afford facilities in
aiding the government to collect
revenues; help float the "liberty
loan;" organize central food pro
duction committees to work with
the state defense councils; sup
ply their own food requirements
wherever possible, and reduce
Kiite in the household.
What U. S. is Doing
Members of the federal council's
organization outlined at length to the
governors steps the government is
taking to put the country in a state
of preparedness.
Daniel Willard, chairman of the
council committee on transportation,
described the work of the general
railroad committee, which is now op
erating the country's railroad lines as
one central system. Howard CofTin,
chairman of the committee on muni
tions told of efforts to find facilities
for an adequate supply of guns and
ammuniticn.

Conferees of House and Sen
ate Agree On Regular Army
ADDroDiiation. But Yet
Differ On War Army Meas
ure. (By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, May 3. Senate and
house conferees agreed tonight on
the army appropriation bill carrying
about $280,000,000 for the support of
the regular establishment for the fis
cal year ending June 30 and the mili
tary academy bill. Tomorrow they
will take up the war army draft bill.
The enly serious difference between
the conferees on the appropriation
measure was over a senate amend
ment authorizing an increase in the
army general staff from 50 to 91 and
permitting all members to be assign
ed to duty in Washington. Under ex
isting law only half the staff can be
stationed here. The house conferees
accepted the section with a proviso
that it should be effective only during
the period of the emergency.
There has been no discussion of
the draft bill age provisions and mem
bers are ,not predicting the outcome
on disputed points. Every effort,
however, will be made to have the
bill in President Wilson's hands by
Saturday night
Storm of Protests
Meet Bill Designed
For Muzzling Press
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, May 3. Sentiment
against the censorship provision of the
espionage bill became so sU'ong in the
house today that its leading opponents
confidently declared tonight that the
section would be stricken out before
final passage of the measure. A vote
may be peached tomorrow.
Speaker Clark, Republican Leader
Mann, Representative Kahn of Cali
fornia, Representative McCVirmick of
Illinois, and o dozen other representa
tives today attacked the section de
claring inequivocally that they were
opposed to any proposal to muzzle the
press, particularly at the outset of
America's entry into the war. Repre
sentative Wood tof Indiana even In
sisted that England as an ally be
asked to raise its press cenosrshlp.
Representative Webb, in charge of
the bill, amended the language of the
section during the day, but its oppo
nents insisted that substantially no
change had been made.
CANADA AND U. S.
TO JOIN IN REDUCING
PRICE OF WHEAT
OTTAWA, Ont.. May 3. An
nouncement was made in par

White, the minister of finance,
that plans are under way for
joint action by Canada and the
United States to reduce the
price of wheat.
Sir Thomas said the price
of flour, wheat or any other
necessity could not be regulat
ed by the Canadian govern
ment alone. To establish the
regulation of the food prices,
the simultaneous action of the
United States and Canada was
necessary, he said.
British Line Surges
On In Withering Fire
(By Review Leased Wire).
Another period of intensive fighting
the fourth since the spring toffen
sive began is in progress between
the British and Germans over a front
of about 12 miles in the region from
the east of Vimy southward to the
west of Queant.
After their customary terrific artil
lery preparation, the British along the
entire front surged forward early this
morning, and throughout Thursday
were at grips with the enemy.
Nightfall found the British well in
possession of several points of vant
age, which they bad captured in the
face of most stubborn resistance and
held with a withering fire of machine
guns and rifles.
Berlin asserts that the British at

sent a telegram which said in

"Will you kindly convey to the
members of the clearing house
my appreciation of the tender of
services I have received from
them and beg them to cooperate
heartily with the federal reserve
bank of your district in securing
subscriptions to the $2,000,000,

local committees to assist the
federal authorities would be ap
propriate. Bankers Can Aid Much
"The amount of the initial loan has
been determined by the needs of the
government and not arbitrarily. The
enthusiastic and patriotic cooperation
of the banks and bankers of the coun
try will guarantee the success of the
undertaking."
Everybody is Buying
The result of the first announce
ment of the loan has been a del
uge of subscriptions, aggregating
many millions. Most of these
came in by wire. to the treasury.
Virtually every large city and ev
ery state in the union was repre
sented by message.
Italy Gets 100 Millions
Negotiations continued today with
representatives of the nations to

ambassador received the full amount
of the first $100,000,000 loan made by
this government to Italy.
Subscriptions to the second offer

north and south of the village on a

was further shown to have nushed
back the German line four mile3 since

of having cut their way through the

The Germans suffered severe losses

Small bands of Villa followers have

Martin Mulrte, a young miner, was

accidents in the history of the dis
trict Mulroe was working In a drift be
tween the 300 and 400 foot levels, a
lead set had been put in the day be
fore and Mulroe was detailed to put
in a bridging. Contrary to Uie usual
methods of miners while doing bridg
ing work, Mulroe climbed on top ot
the timbers with his bridging and
started to work wit'i his pick and
pickey-poke, crouching witn one leg
under him and the other stretched out
toward the entrance of the drift. Both
sides of the drift were solid but, above
Mulroe, was an eighteen-inrh s'.rip o
silicious ore. As Mulroe storied work
ing this started t'j run. The lower part
of the miner's body was pinned to the
timbers and he was rendered helpless.
The first run of the sundy ore oc
curred at 10:10 yesterday morning.
A rescue crew immediately started to
work, under the impression that Mul
roe had been cauht under the tim
ber, no one suspeet'n j that he haa
crawled on top of the timber to work.
After several hours wjrk' the rescue,
crew came within a few feet of the
imprisoned man and only then learned
that he had climbed on top of the
lead set to work. A nuw method of
work was then started, and, at tel.
minutes to three, two of the crew got
under the timbering at the breast of
the drift and started to carry Mulroe
out. only to find that one of his legs
was held fast by a boulder.
Twenty minutes later, before the
boulder could be removed, the tandy
ore started to run sgain and in a fe
seconds Mulroe smothered to death
within a few yards of hid helpless com
rades. All during the day, while :he

doubts but what he would be taken

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, May 3. Absolute
authority to regulate in Its discretion
the piOduction. distribution and prices
of food and other necessities during
the war was asked of congress today
by the administration.
In a sweeping bill introduced by
Representative Lever, the chairman of
the house agricultural committee, it is
proposed to empower the President
during the war to take these meas
ures whenever in his opinion the na
tional emergency shall require:
TO RULE ALL NECESSITIES
To fix maximum and minimum
prices for food, clothing, fuel and
other necessities, and the articles
required for their production.
To prescribe regulations to gov
ern the production of the commo
dities and if necessary to requisi
tion the producing factories, mines
or other establishments.
TO PREVENT "CORNERS'"
To compel holders of neces
saries to release them in amounts
insuring equitable distribution.
To regulate exchanges in such
a way as to eliminate rtarket man
ipulation. To compel railroads to give pref
erence to the m ovement of neces
saries. TO FIX TARIFFS
To levy such Importation duties
as he finds necessary to prevent
excessive "dumping" of foreign
products, and;
TO CHERISH GRAINS
To impose limitations or prohi
bitions on the use of grain in th
manufacture of liquor.
STANDARDIZE FOODS
In addition the secretary of agri
culture would be empowered to
establish standard food grades, to
license and control the manurac
' ture, storage and distribution of
foods; to prescribe the percentage
of flour to be milled from wheat,
and to regulate the mixing of
wheat flour with other flour in
the making of bread and other
food.
Business Protected
In a statement tonight Mr. Lever de
clared there was nothing in the mea.

mere conferring of the more extreme

40 GOLD
NET SET TO ENSHAftE
H1GHGRADERS ALL OVER
T
(By Review Leased Wire).
DENVER, May 3. Between thirty,
five and forty more arrests are to be
made within two weeks in me alleged
interstate stolen geld conspiracy un
covered last nig lit by the arrest of five
men in Cheyenne, Wyoming, and jne
each in Cripple Creek, Colorado, San
Francisco, and Denver, according to
an official of the secret service branch
of the treasury department here to
day. This officer, who has been at the
center of toe work of running down
the conspiracy since it was undertaken
by the government last December, said
it 'originally had been planned to make
no arrests until the 'matter had been
submitted to the federal grand jur
soon to meet at Cheyenne. He said,
however, that Tuesday Toney Cuase,
arrested yesterday in San Francisco,
took steps which interfered seriously
with this plan.
Cuase offered $15,000 in bullion at
the mint Tuesday, the secret service
man said, saying, "I'm Joe Nex, a
mining man from Nevada. I've got
15,000 worth of gold I want fa sell,"
to which the mint officials said "all
right; come back tomorrow."
Cuase agreed to this, the secret ser
vice man said, and the mint officials
telegraphed him of the incident. While
reluctant to change plans so far ad
vanced, the officials said it "seemed
too bad to let Toney get away with
$15,000 in Cripple Creek fold." Plans
were changed hastily and yesterday's
arrests followed. Some of the persons
connected with the affair have not
been under close surveillance recently,
the officer said, but general surveil
lance over all its ramifications has
been in effect for some time.
She officer first declined to say
whether the arrests to be made in
cluded any prominent people, but later
qualified this by saying none were tVm-te-nplated
in Denver as yet.
The conspirators, he said, have been
getting away with upward of $300,000
yearly in gold ore, mainly from mines
in the Cripple Creek district, and
thefts bad been going on for over two
years.
The government's attention first
was attracted to the case by the num
ber and size of express shipments of
gold made from Cheyenne, the officer
said, who pointed out that shipments
were being made to distant points
when the gold could have been sold to
the Denver mint as readily if condi
tions were n'jrmal.
As told by, the officer, the affair
seems to have centered in Cripple
Creek where an assayer is said to
have received the high grade gold ore
from miners, melted it down and for
warded the result, which ran from 990
to 1000 fine, to agents elsewhere, prob
ably in Cheyenne, which appears to
have been a distributing point for it,
some one in Cheyenne apparently sent
it 'on to agents in ( Philadelphia. San
j Francisco or New York, who sold it
to the mints of assay offices.
I The interest of the government in
the case is explained as due to the
fact that sales of stolen metal to the
j government departments put it in the
; position of receiving stolen g'oods.
SAN FRANCISCO, May 3. Joe Nex
arrested simultaneously with several
other men in Cheyenne, Denver and
j Victor, Colorado, on charges of con
; spiracy to defraud the government
! through the sale of g'old ore allegeo
to have been stolen, will be returned
jto Cheyenne for trial, federal officers
said today.
Nex was arrested last night when
he appeared at the San Francisco mint
with $15,00 worth of gold bullion which
he offered for sale.
CRIPPLE CREEK. May 3. The
sheriff today searched the office or
Frank Cochrane, arrested here last
night in connection with an alleged
interstate stolen gold conspiracy and
found approximately $7000 in gold con
centrates, which were seized.
Cochrane is to be taken to Denver
tomorrow by a federal officer, it was
learned tonight.

DESMOND AGAIN IN
MINISTERIAL HOLE
Popular Triangle Stars Re-appear
Tonight In "A Gambl.-;
In Souls" At The Orpheum
Theatre.
Whether it is because he is pecu
Hatly adaptable type or because
fate's conspiracy has so ordained, is
diffi.-'i't to decid", but William Des
mond of the Triangle forces seems to
he most happily cast in the role of a
Minister of the gospd.
Desmond's first assignment after
oinin'.; Triangle's play-rs was the
")lo of "the ni-enister" in support of
IT'i'lie Puthe in 'Peggy." His success
P'-s wi'l b" remembered, was instan
taneous. He invested the part with
"!ttctity and grace, and though the
Til:y was of a serio-comic nature, he
did not burlesoue the character.
Possibly in mind and possibly not;
at any ra'e. when J. G. Hawks sub
mitted his manuscript. "Waifs," it
was with the suggestion that Des
mond be cast in the role of the young
minister. The suggestion was adopt
ed by Ince without f'irther ado. and
the actor won still more followers.
Now Desmond is seen in his third
ministerial role. He has the part of
a clergyman in "A Gamble in Souls."
which plays again today at the Or
pheum. the "TTtenpte-Ksy Rp? play by
Lanier PanleM. in which he appears
as co-star with Dorothy Drlton. It is
a part that demands of him more pow
er and force than did either of his
other like characterizations.

Jessie Stevens, who plays Eve Les
lie's mother in "Envy," one of Mo
Clure's Seven Deadly Sins, starring
Ann Murdock. which is to be shown
at the Lyric theatre today, was one of
the most famous "Topsys" that ever
toured in "I'ncle Tom's Cabin." She
thrived on th; part. It agreed with
her so r.mch that as she grew older
she found that she was too plump to
play leading parts.
So she joined a stock company. Re
hearsing a new play every week,
working morning, afternoon and at
nicht. she rapidly reached the pound
ape that she sotttxht and soon she was
touring the country- at the head of
her own company, tipping the scales
at 120 pounds. .
Throughout the middle west they
still talk about Jessie Stevens' plays.
For forty years she has been on the
stare. Now she confines herself to
character roles. Her film experiences
include engagements with Selig. Es
sannay and Edison. She's the cheeri
est person in pictures and she carries
her happy personality into the films.

'SPECIALLY POTATOES.
The chief danger that a nation Jias of eating Itself to
death is that it put Into its stomach what ought to be
put into the ground, says the Chicago Tribune. At
present every potato eaten is a potato which ought to be
used as the mother of a family.
Potato eating is cradle robbing. It is worse than cradle
robbing. Every potato on the market ouht to me an
ancestor, not a food. The potato eyes are the providers
for next year and we have so diminished the supply that
unless we cease eating potatoes now we shall not know
anything of potatoes next year.
The potato is life'3 most nutritious tuber, bad for fat
folks to eat but sustaining for the human race to have.
It had a difficult time establishing itself in Europe and
there is a ceremonial in France connected with the mem
ory of the man who added this tuber to the sustenance of
a nation.
Next to wheat it is the mainstay of human sustenance,
and when what ought to go into the gronnd goes into the
stomach there are likely to be empty stomachs later.
Volunteers for potato saving may now spring to the
table. We doubt the validity of springing to arms, but
springing to diets may be effective.
This does not require much heroism and gets ho brass
bands. It is a commonplace bit of untheatric self-denial,
important to the sustenance and therefore to the secu.'
ity of the nation.
Thrift is needed for the security of ne republic, and,
especially, just now, in potatoes. Patriotism may be in
different to so little an incident in the economy of the
nation. But if it is indifferent it is not patriotism.
A potato saved now may mean those full meals earned
next October. This war may be decided by national
capacity to supply the most meals. Nations may be abl
to keep on producing high explosive shells and fail in
producing the three squares upon which nations live and
flourish.
Men cannot eat explosive shells and they may be un
able to fire them unless the potato be ready for their sus
tenance, the potato or some other main sustaining food
which will keep life alive while it is destroying life.
The war may not be decided by destnicticn but by pro
duction. Destruction end production are twin sister?,
workingby ryemingly opposing fiathods to the same end.
A seed potato saved is as powerful as a three inch shell.
Therefore save, especially potatoes because they now
are needed,, ior seed and not for pot roasts and salad.
Patriots ffc'Ul not eat potatoes. Potatoes must go back into
the ground. They are needed as ancestors, not as provender.
OUR CENSORSHIP.
The government censorship plans appear to be genu
inely American. There is to be no censorship of the
European sort.
The Prussian method, by which the press prints what
ever the authorities direct, and nothing else, is naturally
tabooed. There is to be far less control than is exercised
in England, where the government while lacking positive
control of editorial policies, wields a blue pencil over
every piece of news that it printed. There has been a
vast amount of dissatisfaction in England over this
negative but relentless reign of Tensors, and there would
be more dissatisfaction in America. We have the freest
press in the world, and editors and readers alike would
object to any extreme limitation of news or comment.
The so-called censorship bureau arranged by the joiut
action of the state, war and navy departments is really
a publicity bureau. An experienced newspaper man is at
the head of it. He will have experienced newspapermen
as assistants. He will not be a dictator. He will a- t
as intermediary between the government and the press.
He will see that whatever information the government
has to give out from day to day will reach the various
news agencies in a safe and accurate form.
Beyond that, the activities of the bureau will be chiefly
advisory. The government is making a set of regula
tions by means of which editors are to be expected to
govern themselves. The press is presumed to have both
brains and patriotism. Every editor will, from dHy to
day, act as his own censor, withholding from publication
any facts he may have which for any reason lie judges it
unwise to print. There will lie no absurd attempt to
conctal things that everybody fcnovs. The war new:,
will be printed far more fully than it is in any other bel
ligerent country.
The government, the press and the public will be linked.
more than ever before, in a great partnership. And that
is as it should be. Public opinion, the force which wins'
or loses were, In order to be effective must be well in
formed as well as patriotic. We shall not wage this, war
in ignorance. '
OUR UNKNOWN NEIGHBORS.
The entrance of Bolivia into the limelight the other
day as a new recruit to the ranks of those who repudiate
methods and German theories was probably the first c.c
casion on which most Americans had ever given a thought
to that little American republic. In fact, it is to be
doubted if there were many of us who had .more than a
very hazy idea as to where Bolivia was, and not more
than a handful who knew more about it than its gee
graphical position. The war has taught us a good do::l
about our European neighbors, but Americans as a rule
remain lamentably ignorant about that most important
and gigantic section of the world South America.
We are fond of talking about the insular prejudices o'
the English, and yet there is no reproach which could be
more justly levelled against ourselves. How many Amer
icans realize that in South America there is an old and
widespread culture, equal in many respects to that exist
ing in any other part of the earth; that South America Is
the home of a fine and idealistic literature, a flourishing
art and rapidly growing schools of science.
It is true that there is much disorder and government?!
lavity among our sister republics to the south, and that
the ignorance and poverty of the masses of the people
are deplorable in almost every state, but that is merelv
one side of the picture. On the brighter side there is one
fact in particular that stands out sharply: Almost uni
versally throughout the southern half of the continent
there is a spirit of idealism which isr unique in the per
sistence of its expression and the dominance of its in
fluence. South Americans really believe in democracy;
and if they seldom find the way to put their beliefs into
practice, they never abandon the struggle.
It is easy to dismiss the almost endless Latin-America"
revolutions as the struggles of sordid, selfish or corrupt
men for power, but such an explanation is neither true
nor sensible. Many cf the men who head these revolu
tions are both selfish and corrupt, but if they gull their
followers, they do it with the bait of liberty and demo
cracy.
Through bloodshed, misery and suffering the Scut'i
Americans are striving toward the goal. They are per
petually deceived and betrayed, but the fact that their
faith never falters has in it something sublime. Their
ways are not our ways, and their thoughts are not our
thoughts; but their eyes are fixed on the same bright
star, and it is sympahhy and understanding they need,
not hostile or jeering criticism.

FOOD VS. LIQUOR.
Alcohol has met a new enemy. The "more food" pro
paganda now at its height in this country has Inevitable
called attention to the immense quantities of foodstuffs
ordinarily used as raw material for making intoxicating
liquors.
"Why urge housewives to conserve food and plant back
yard vegetable plcts when millions of bushels of grain
are going to the manufacturer of intoxicants?" the women
inquire. The Cleveland Federation of Women's Clubs ha
not only asked the question, but has answered it. in the
form of a resolution demanding national prehibitton.
The women's argument gains frcm the internal revenue
report, which indicates that 136.000.000 bushels of grain
were used last year to make whisky and beer. It poes
without saying, of course, that that quantity of grain
would go farther toward nourishing the nation if turned
into edible food products. And all, that is quite aside
from the usual moral arguments against drink.
The war has dealt the "Demon Hum" severe blows in
every belligerent country. It would be strange if tin-
United States should prove to be an exception. We shall
hardly see national prohibition inaugurated all at ow",
in spite of war's demands for economy and efficiency, bi:t
there is certain to be a great curtailment of the produc
tion and consumption of alcoholic beverages.
CONVICTS TO RAISE FOOD.
While we're figuring out methods to increase our food
production this year, why not follow Canada's rxanipl"
and draft able-bodied convicts for that purpose?
A representative of the Dominion government has been
touring all the penitentiaries in Canada, making a per
sonal inspection of the prisoners, and discussing with
wardens ways and means of putting them at farm work
during the summer. It is believed that the greater part
of the prison population can be used in this manner.
It's a wise and justifiable thing for the community to
do, and it's an excellent thing for the prisoners them
selves. The open-air exercise and sunshine quickly sub
stitute a healthful glow for the prison pallor, an erect
nd self-respecting posture for the prison stoop mil
shuffle. And as far as the public, is concerned, it's vastly
better than making brushes or any other perfunctory
work to which convicts are so often driven merely to
keep them busy. Let them be made genuinely productive
creating the one thing that the country needs most.

WASHINGTON. May 3. Comple
tion of a central purchasing commit
tee in Washington for all supplies
bought in the United Statesc for the
allied governments was forecast here
today by Sir Hardman Lever, finan
cial expert of the British war mission.
Sir Hardman was careful to say
that negotiations to this end still
were incomplete, but he pointed out
hy a joint directing bureau would
be essential to secure the most econ
omical administration of the huge
credits authorized by this country and
the fairest distribution of supplies
imong the various governments. The
United Stntes is preparing to do its
"Krt toward seeing that the allies get
their money's worth for every dollar
'pent here.
Bankrupt Germany
Dis"ursin!r the world financial sit
uation the British expert expressed
;he opinion that Getmany would be
practically bankrupt in the credit
Tirrkets after the war.
"Our enemies." he said, "for all
their boasted efficiency, have never
had the con'age to face their finan
"ial problems, with the result that
when the war is over they will be
hard put to it.
German Debts Staoqering
"The Teutonic governments having
nyra'Jiided one international loan on
"nothcr will find that the interest
charges will be so grest that the gov
ernment will either have to repudiate
. Inrse part of their debt, which in
it?e'f would be disastrous, or face in
obii'ty to buy the enormous quanti
fies of materiil they would need for
-e-consf ruction."
He predicted that the end of the
war would find the allies in good
h?pe financially, despite their enor
mous debts.
Hardman said the -financial aid
of the United States had relieved
Great Britain of a load of anxiety.
"The burden which we have carried
for ourselves and our allies has been
i severe one and the relief is propor
tionate. The assistance which you
-re going to render us in this sphere
is fo real and must have been so ful
:v comprehended and apprehended by
'he kaiser's financial advisors that I
'nke it to be one of thp clearest signs
f Germany's desperation, that, know
ing what this help mepns. she still de
rided on a course which was bound
to bring the United States into the
!ist3 aeainst her. The dollar was nev
r so almighty for good."'
Some of the members of the British
mission today held breakfast confer
ences with American oiffcials. To
night Mr. Balfour entertained at din

JOIN US IN A NATIONAL SERVICE
We cannot all go to war, we are not all the right age limit and
with the rugged physical standards demanded of the warrior, yet we
can all do a service by engaging in the production of a national, in
ternational life necessity, in the production of more OIL.
The consumption of oil is 200,000 barrels per day more than the
production and urls3 more oil is produced in the immediate future
we will have a United States Oil Dictator.
The auto owners and other consumers would be told by their gov
j' rer day or per week or per month they
might consume. Last week Roosevelt advocated the limitation on the
consumption of gasoline.
Developing oil properties is the greatest profit-paying business in
the world today.
