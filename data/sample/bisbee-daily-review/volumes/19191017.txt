PITTSBURGH. Oct. 16. Labor
leaders conducting the steel workers'
strike in the Pittsburgh district con
tinued their preparations today to
make a legal attack against local and
county authorities in Allegheny coun
ty on the question of free speech
and free assemblage, -which the strik
ers allege have been denied them.
Papers in the contemplated court
proceedings have been prepared, and
it is expected injunctions will be ap
plied for tomorrow.
Mayor E. V. Babcock today issued
a statement in reply to a warning
Bent him yesterday by counsel for
the strikers that legal action would
be taken if there was any further un
lawful interference with union meet
ings. The mayor said:
Mayor Explains.
"That all may clearly understand
my position in the controversy raised
by Attorney W. B. Rubin, represent
ing, among others, John Fitzpatrick,
Chicago, chairman, and Wm. Z. Fos
ter, secretary-treasurer of the nation
al committee for organizing steel
workers, over holding meetings In
the city of PittsburgTi, I desire to say
that I deem it for the best interest
of the city that no meetings be held
in the strike zone. I have given
orders to that effect.
"Peace and order In the city must
be maintained. The fact that Mr.
Foster is continually in the city and
had the reputation of starting trou
ble in other places causes me to plan
to be ultra-safe and conservative in
the interests of the city of Pitts
burgh and all the people inside of
its confines. There is no objection,
whatever, to public meetings outside
a strike zone in the city limits."
The mayor said the police depart
ment is maintaining order with a
firm hand, "but not with a rough or
inhuman hand."
Strikers Satisfied.
"The general situation is excel
lent," said Secretary Foster tonight,
"with prospects of gains in small
communities to which we have been
unable to give more attention here
tofore. Only the successful outcome
of the legal proceedings under way to
Becure free speech is necessary to
closo up the places in the immediate
vicinity of Pittsburgh which are now
crippled to a less degree than mills
elsewhere."

LT. HARD HELD AT OMAHA
Sec. Wilson Has
No Definite Plan
To Offer Strikers
WASHINGTON. Oct. 16. Secre
tary Wilson, it was said today at the
department of labor, will have no
special plan to offer as to adjustment
of the controversies between bitumin
ous coal miners and operators tomor
row, when John L. Lewis, acting
president of the United Mine Workers
of America, and Thomas J. Brewster,
president of the Coal Operators' as
sociation, meet with him here in an
effort to avoid the strike called for
November 1 in the central competi
tive fields. The policy of the labor
secretary, It was said, will be to
bring the leaders of the two opposing
factions together through "concilia
tion of their disagreements as devel
oped during the conference. Based
on successes in adjusting disputes
between miners and operators in the
past, officials said today, there was
a well grounded belief that the strike
would be averted through the confer
ence. As a basis for their belief they
cited the threatened strikes in the
central Pennsylvania fields and in
Alabama in 1917 as showing the suc
cess of the secretary of labor's meth
od of bringing miners and operators
together. In the case of the Penn
sylvania miners the strike was avert
ed by what was known as the "Wash
ington agreement.

received further attetion today in
congress.
Several bills having for their pur
pose deportation of foreign agitators
and aliens who fail to become citizens

in the country, were offered in the
senate and house, while the latter

passport restrictions for one year. This
bill, recommended by the state depart
ment and designed, to keep dangerous
aliens out of the country, now goes to
the senate.
Hearings on appropriations for nat
uralization work were continued be
fore the house immigration commit
tee. Raymond F. Crist, deputy com
missioner of naturalization, told the
committee 11,000,000 foreign born per
sons in the country were not citizens
and that the presence of such a large
undigested population" created "an
alarming situation."
The senate labor committee, which
has been investigating the steel strike
decided today to hear witnesses Mon
day and Tuesday as to the activity of
radical aliens in that strike. It also
voted to close its inquiry by the mid
dle of next week so as to get to work
on naturalization, which It proposes to

Neither Maynard nor his companion

lost time as soon as I can again take

WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 The long
debated Shantung amendment to the
peace. treaty, presented by Senator
Lodge and approved by the foreign
relations committee, finally was re
jected in the senate today with a ma
jority of an even score against it. .
In the vote of 35 to 55, fourteen
Republicans swung over to the pro
treaty forces, while three Democrats
lined up with those supporting the
proposal. Of the six senators absent,
two Republicans were put on record
as in favor of the amendment and one
Republican and three Democrats as
opposing it.
The roll call, which came at the end
of another six and a half hours of
sharp debate, in reality swept away
six amendments instead of one, each
change in the treaty text having been
numbered separately by the commit
tee in its decision to strike out the
word "Japan" and substitute the word
"China" throughout the sections re
lating to the province of Shantung.
By unanimous consent, however, the
six changes were debated and voted
on as one.
- Only three of the committee's 45
amendments now remain to be acted
on by the senate, 36 previously hav
ing been rejected. Of those remain
ing one relates to American represen
tation on the reparations commission
and two to equalization of voting
power in the league of nations as

against it by Senators Phelan of
California, a Democrat, and McCum

Senator Williams, Democrat, Missis

bitter denunciation of the attitude of

After the roll call a few minutes
was devoted to the formal reading of

Senator Gerry, j Democrat, Rhode

WASHINGTON, Oct. 16 Recogni
tion of the right of collective bar
gaining came to the floor of the na
tional industrial conference today,
and was debated for three hours, but
a vote was impossible as the confer
ence had to adjourn at 5:30 o'clock
under its rules. Virtual notice was
given by members of the labor group
that should the representatives of
capital succeed in their attempt to
send the resolution back to the com
mittee of 15, the labor delegation
would withdraw.
The collective bargaining resolu
tion, providing for an endorsement
of the fight of wage earners to nego
tiate .with employers through "repre
sentatives of their own choosing,"
was reported to the conference, when
it met at 2:30 o'clock this afternoon
with the approval of all of the public
and labor delegate's in the committee
but opposed by representatives of
capital.
Dissolution Faced.
Realizing that the conference faced
the likelihood of dissolution unless
an agreement should be reached on
the issue of collective bargaining,
members of the public group directed
eloquent appeals to the employers in
an effort to win them over to the
resolution. Leading In, this effort
was John D. Rockefeller, Jr., repre
sentative of one of the nation's great
est industrial organizations, who
pleaded for a "new spirit" in indus

"the right of representation" by
workers, who, he added, really
sought, "not higher wages, but recog

PITTSBURGH, Oct. 16 Sheriff
Wm. S. Haddock, of Allegheny coun

of the senate committee investigat

he practically charges that the body
of Fannie Sellins, an organizer for
the United Mine Workers, who was
shot and killed August 26 at West
Natrona, where there was a strike
of miners, had been deliberately mu
tilated after the official autopsy to
make it appear she was shot in the
back.
The death of the woman has at
tracted much attention because of
charges made by labor union men
that she was murdered by deputy
sheriffs. The coroner's verdict de

The miners charge she was shot to
death while protecting children from
the sheriffs deputies. The body was
exhumed last Monday at the instance
of a relative and yesterday labor men
sent to Chairman Kenyon an affida
vit signed by two physicians averring
that there was a gunshot wound in
the back. The coroner's finding
made no mention of such wound.

The preamble to the note declares
that the open enmity of the Bolshe

Conflicting Stories
Told of Shooting
Conflicting stories concerningJLhfi
cause for his action surround. 'the
arrest of Q. E. Franklin, city gar
bage collector, who was taken into
custody by the sheriff's office last
night and lodged in the local jail,
following the shooting of Teodore
Bujanda, a Mexican, who is said to
be a burro packer.
The shooting took place' in Low
ell, the bullet taking effect in the
right leg, just below the knee. The
Injured mai was taken to the C. &
A. hospital at Warren, where he
was attended by Dr. E. Darragh,
who said late last night that the
wound was . not serious.
Dr. Darragh said last evening that
Franklin had told him that he was
shooting at a dog, and that the
Mexican was struck unintentionally.
At the jail Franklin is said to have
made the declaration that he had
shot Bujanda because the latter was
stealing from him. Another story,
coming from friends of the Mexi
can, was to the effect that Franklin
had shot him after he had made an
attempt to get some monew from
Franklin which the latter "owed him
as wages. .
An investigation v will be-conducted
today.
In the escape of two Mexican boys
yesterday from the custody of the
sheriffs office at Lowell Just a few
hours prior to the time when they
were to appear as witnesses against
B. F. Faust and one, Nikolosky who
were charged with receiving stolen
goods from the youths, not only was
the case against the accused men
broken down, but what is described
as a glarfng example of negligence
in the performance of duty record
ed against the sheriff's office.
In addition to the abortive con
clusion that waB brought to the case
against Faust by the escape of the
youths, the fact that the United
States immigration service was anx
ious to examine them before their
release, is declared to make the neg
ligence of the sheriffs department
the mote noticeable.
The complete story, as gathered
last evening is as follows:
On October 7 Faust, Nikolosky
and the two boys were arrested in
connection with the theft of a quan
tity of copper wire from the power
line running between Douglas " and
the new concentrator. Twenty-four
pounds of this, according to offi
cials of the company, were sold by
the boys - to Faust, and a greater
quantity was recovered before any
sale could be made.
When the arrests were made,
Faust, Nikolosky and the two boys
were taken by the sheriffs depart
ment to the Bisbee jail, where they
were placed in the same cell. Those
interested in the case protested
against this on the following day,
knowing that there could not but be
collusion between Faust and the
chief witnesses against him. The
boys were thereupon placed in cells,
but as Faust had the run of the
main department, he was,' according
to the witnesses, in as close touch
with the youths as he had been
before.
Faust and Nikolosky subsequently
made bond, and were released, while
the boys were taken to the jail at
Lowell. The case against Faust had
been set for Wednesday, but, ow
ing to some technicality, it was-
postponed until yesterday.
In the morning, according to the
company official who had worked
up the . case against Faust for : the
purchase ,pf the" stolen material,
Frank E". Thdrnas, clerk of the court
at Lowell,: asked Deputy Sheriff
Rahnifalk, who was in charge of the
boys at the jail, to have them clean
out the court room and the jail.
Bahmfalk said that he was going to
Bisbee, and upon the request bein
made several times, he allowed them
to go in the custody of Thomas, it
is said.
In the meantime, all preparations
for the trial of Faust had been
made. About three hours, it is said.
had elapsed since the prisoners had
been placed under the charge of
Thomas, and when the time came to
produce the witnesses, they had dis
appeared. Without the boys, who
had confessed, it is declared, to their
part in the transaction with Faust,
there was nothing to do but find
the defendant not guilty, which the
jury promptly did.
According to Clerk Thomas, he had
the boys sweeping out the office
and when they started on the stairs
leading to the street. When they
reached the thoroughfare, Thomas
says that they simply disappeared.
Efforts to find them yesterday aft
ernoon and evening were fruitless.
The case is aggravated, it was de
clared last night, by the fact that
the sheriff's office had kept the
youths, who are minors, in the same
cells as adults, which i3 specifically
forbidden by the Juvenile court law.
Faust is also under bond to the
United States government for viola
tion of the food conservation laws
in connection with the illicit manu
facture of liquor. He was to have
appeared before J. D. Taylor, Unit
ed States commissioner, yesterday
afternoon to answer to the charge,
but his counsel appealed for. a con
tinuance until October 30, which was
granted. Faust did not appear.

Corporations had little to give out
today regarding conditions in their

Strike headquarters gave out what
was said to be a report of actual con

the Homestead works of the Carnegie

to give the number of men found in

CHAPTER XT I Find' a Ileal Sing
ing Teacher.
My sister Carmella Is very sensi
tive. When I expressed small con
cern in iroing with her to the sing
ing teacher who had spoken ro
favorably of our voices after having
heard us in a .ew York vaudeville
theatre, Carmella looked dis
appointed. "But he spoke of you, A3 well,"
she reminded.
Our friend the young man with
the fine, tenor voice who was study
ing with this maestro, end who tiad
brought us the message, rather in
sisted. "Come, too, Rosa," he said, "you
don't obligate yourself."
I yielded. '
The interview was one not to be
forgotten. 1 confess to having been
impressed with the man. He seemed
thoroughly to understand his pro
fession. I liked the quiet and the
complete way with which he liter
ally turned Carmella's voice "Inside
out." I think he almost took it out
and laid it before him, to uncom
promisingly inspect. And he made
no extravagant promises.
I did, not wonder that" CarmcHa
went away enthusiastic. If I had
been willing to- talk I . would have
confessed to some similar feeling:
Carmella took 'a few days before
making up her, mind. Then she
returned to the teacher for another
talk. : , ,
I gathered that they had omitted
nothing, when my sister returned to
our temporary home. Her serious
ness, and surprisingly lengthy ab
sence slje had said she wouldn't
be gone an hour were significant.
"Rosa," she announced, with the
tenseness of one wishing to spea!c
quickly of an unpleasant thing, "I'm
going to give up vaudeville at
least," she added, "for a time."
I was not sure I had heard aright.
,rWhat!" I ejaculated, "you're not
serlOGS?"
She explained, quickly, almost
feverishly. The maestro had told
her she, could not make satisfactory
progress unless she stopped all sing
ing in public. And she had declined
to take the chance. More than that,
she insisted that it was the thing,
r'.iewise, for me to do.
"It's our opportunity," said Car
mella, almost dramatically.
The decision upset me. I was in
a. daze. "But can you arrange?
Won't it inconvenience the vaude
ville management?" Carmella had
already made inquiries as to that;
she had been busy, before returning
home, it appeared.
The turn was rather sudden. It
tcok several days before I could
bring myself to conclusive reoJiza
tlcn of the fact. And I was a bit
miffy. I van't interested lit sing
ing teachers. Yet, in my heart of -hearts,
I probably was.
"YVe finished our New York engage
ment, during which Carmella per
sisted In her effort to win me to a
less antagonfstfc attitude toward
singing teachers in general.
"This teacher is different," as
sured my sister.
"No doubt," I retorted, romewhat
testily; I was annoyed. "But let'B
wait and see." '
I did see, very shortly. Less than '
three weeks after she began study
ing I commenced to attune my hear
ing when Carmella practiced her ex
ercises. Her voice had been pro
nounced a mezzo-soprano, and it re
sponded so quickly to the training
(especially after we ceased our
auleville appearances) that its
quality improved at an amazing rate.
Little defects began to disappear.
And Carmella was so happy that her
enthusiasm began to be infectious. .
"Let's go see your old teacher,"
I ' said, grudgingly one '" morning
X though be wasn't old, in the least)
Carmella laughed 'delightedlv,. 'at
that, and we set out.
But it proved to be less easy a
matter than I had so thoughtlessly
assumed. The maestro didn't ap
prove of teaching two members of
one family. . Then my voice had
more defects than Carmella's. No,
ho wasn't particular about accept
ing me. Eventually we persuaded
him, though it took some time.
That first lesson was a revelation.
Ilis ways were so simple. He made
no fuss in what he did, nor did he
attempt to mystify the pupil. He
explained certain vocal .essentials
and worked with me for an hour.
I left' with- my head in the clouds.
I was a dramatic soprano not a
mezzo and at that initial lesson I
had accomplished certain things with
my voice which amazed me.
'. On my way back to our rooms I
passed the theatre where the sing
ing teacher had first heard me. I
stopped, bowed toward the door
way, and said: "Thank you; you did
me a good turn."

STATE VS. PRIVATE CREDIT j
Bankers can do all that it is possible for the government to
do in relieving shortage of dwellings, and , small improved farms,
says R. Ingall, director of research in Bankers' Statistics corpora
tion of New York, before savings bank section of American Bank
ers association. He says: "The constitution of nearly every state
has a clause restricting to public and general uses any funds
raised by taxation or credit. Nevertheless, taxing and appropria
tion powers are being exercised again to give special favors to
sections,' localities and classes. Nationalization of banking and
land the socialists first aim has made remarka'ble headway.
"United States Housing corporation, federal farm loan system
and United States reclamation service were created to embark the
government in the real estate and long-term credit business; they
naturally become the chief precedents for having the government
compete with any private person or concern that has a dwelling
or farm for sale or rent, or a dollar to lend on such property.
"The federal building loan bill pending is an even more serious
attempt to put the government into the real estate business.
"In the United States there are 7,484 building and loan asso
ciations with 4,011.401 members and $1,898,344,346 of assets. The
outcry against destructive designs on this magnificent system ought
to be nation-wide. But good judgment has been warned by prom
ise of cheap loans and tax exemptions.
"Federal farm loan act, like the Nolan bill, promised 'unquali
fied good without burdening the government. The system has is
sued $321,255,000 tax-exempted bonds and is adding millions every
month, to great impairment of the government's credit.
"Enhancement of farm values, caused by this easy money has
brought the greatest land speculation in history. It has made ag
ricultural development more expensive, and is a factor in high cost
of living.
"Federal building loan bill is backed by the weakest of argu
ments, but will be hard to defeat. The radicals seeking to put

BEETS SAVE THE DAY
Because of lack of developments which would tend to clear
away the uncertainties now befogging the sugar situation, incident
to- slow progress being made in process of de-control, the domestic
beet sugar industry never faced a more critical situation than ex
ists today.
With the cane refined supply in sight up to the end of the
year totally inadequate to care for normal requirements, the bur
den of supplying the needs of the greater part of the country au
tomatically faills on the beet producers.
Recent estimates indicate that roundly 500,000 ton's of beet
sugir are needed from this source to insure a supply that will ap
proximate the probable demand to th end of the year. The move
ment of such a large proportion of the crop, roundly 60 per cent,
is far in excess of any previous distribution for this early period.
Taking Into consideration the difficulties which may possibly de
velop later from unfavorable weather conditions, labor disturbances,
car shortages, or traffic congestion, the likelihood of the greater
proportion of these; factors remaining continually favorable if far
from bright.
And right here stop and figure the great advantages the do
mestic beet sugar crop is to this nation. It has been developed
in the face of many discouragements, but it has survived' and pre
vented a sugar famine during the war and will avert the same ca
tastrophe this year.
Xo stronger argument could be advanced to show the vital need
of stabilizing and encouraging this western industry as one of the
safeguards of the nation's welfare.
AN EQUITABLE SYSTEM
Insurance companies have some remarkable experiences, one
of which is that risks on farm property are extremely unprofit
able, there being $1.25 loss on every $1.00 of receipts.
If rates were based on actual losses in farming communi
ties having fruit driers, hop driers, wooden grain warehouses,
elevators, etc., the cost would 'be prohibitive, so the insurance
companies increase the rates on brick buildings in surrounding
towns which profit by and owe their existence to the growth
of the Biirrounding farm country. This fact is not generally
known and explains why rates in towns in farming communi
ties are sometimes not. as low as would seem justified.
The rates are based on a system of averages to produce the
most equitable distribution of the cost of protection.
It would be unfair to make the rural districts which can
not get 'adequate fire protection stand the whole burden of the
fire risk when the adjoining cities and towns derive their
growth and prosperity from the farming community.
Thi's is an equitable system which should be more gener
ally understood.
After the conference In Washington decides what men should do,
the next step will be to find somebdy who isn't opposed to doing
what he should do.
The old fashioned consumer of John Barleycorn has a hunch
that all this disorder is occasioned by the effoit to deprive a man
of his natural bererage.

ARIZONA COTTON MEN
TO RECEIVE ASSISTANCE
MESA, Oct. 18. Arizona cotton
growers are to receive profitable as
sistance in the marketing of Pima
cotton at eastern buying points
through a consignment service es
tablished by banks and cotton men
in Los Angeles. ''
Announcement is made that grow
ers availing themselves of this ser
vice will be assured of receiving the
privilege of borrowing the major
portion of the value of their cotton

eastern points.
Save on Insurance
Further advantage to growers in
consigning their cotton is a saving
n insurance, is is claimed. The in- j
suranc9 rate is approximately 37 I
cents per bale per year as against!
four cents a day at the various yards
in the Salt River valley. Storage
charges in the east are stated at 35
cents a month with full protection
against weather and other conditions,
which is the principal factor in keep
ing the insurance rate down.
Ample warehouse space is said to
have been secured at various east

Edward M. Fowler & company, is
reported to have obtained space for
15,000 bales at South Providence, R.
I., alone. .

Monday night and asked that the
town aid them in rebuilding a flume
over the wash east of town which

PLAN TO CARE FOR
VISITORS TO FAIR
PHOENIX. Oct. 16. At a very well
attended meeting at the chamber of
commerce Tuesday morning definite
plans were put under way for caring
for the crowds of visitors who will be
in Phoenix during fair week. Several
committees were appointed and duties
assigned to them which they will re
prot onat another meeting to be held
next Saturday morning at 10 o'clock.
The matter of providing a camping
place for auto parties who will be in
the city during the fair was one of the
first matters to come up for considera
tion. H. S. Prince and II. M. Daven
port were asked to select others to
join them ii; forming a committtee
who will interview the management of
Riverside park in regard to securing
th park for such purposes.
The possibility of securing a large
hall and equipping itwlth cots is to be
ihvestigaOd by II. cirinstfT and
Leigh Ford was askea" to find out how
many cots, blankets and other bedding
are available for such use in the fuh
nitute store and other places In the
city. C. W. Feaersor: will investigate
as to what material of this kind can
h obtained from the reserve stock
which is owned by the county.
B. A. Gillespie, J. F. Tracy and J.
O. Sexson were appointed a committee
on organization. They will lay out a
general plan for handling the crowds,
such as providing a room listing bu
reau, a general headquarters for the
visitors, and arranging methods of no
tifying them in regard to possible accommodations.
ATTORNEY GENERAL SUBMITS
OPINION ON RUBBER STAMP
PHOENIX, Oct. IS. The opinion
of Attorney General Wiley E. Jones,
which will be handed to the gover
nor on his return from the Snow flake
fair, in regard to the use of the rub
ber stamp, was signed Saturday
morning'by the attorney general.
The attorney general states that
exactly what constitutes a signature
never has been accurately defined,
but it has usually been regarded that
whatever is intended as a signature
is valid signing; therefore, if the gov
ernor would use a rubber stamp fac
simile of his proper hand writing,
accompanied by a mark, or, as the
governor suggested, his initials, af
fixed by himself, as a token of ac
knowledgment or approval, it would
constitute such a signature as is re
quired by the terms of the statute;
if the governor will authorize such a
method and adopt it as his signature
for a stated purpose.
It was suggested by the attorney
general that the governor sign his
initials before the warrants are de
livered to the person having charge
of the rubber stamp in order to au
thorize such person to affix the stamp
signature to the warrant. He also
suggests that the banks be notified
as to the manner of affixing the rub
ber stamp and the initials which the
eovernor mav adept as his official
signature.
THE CASHIER
Demure and fair, she sits alone.
Behind the lacquered rail,.
As sweetly out of place as if
An angel went to jail.
She smiles at me when I come in,
And speaks quite soft and low.
And charms me with the little acts
That pretty women know.
But though she is a dimpled dear,
And treats me handsomely,
She never does forget to charge
The highest rates that be
And though she's sweet as sugar drops,
And willowy and thin,
She never lets a chance pass by
To rake my money in.

he might have taken mine, but no regrets. Also saw many officers of the

somewhat out of countenance that I'was not noticed much myself Back to

SPOR1 NEWS FOR WARREN DISTRICT FANS
FIGURES DO NOT SHOW HOW BAD
CINCINNATI BEAT CHICAGO SOX
BY FRED TURBYVILLE,
N. E. A. Sports Writer.
The figures in the world series,
while giving the Reds' a big edge over
the Sox in every department of the
game, do net emphasize the superi
ority of Moran's men. The Reds far
outclassed the White Sox. After the
Reds had lost the sixth and seventh
games to the Sox the majority of ex
STILL GOOD FRIENDS
perts, woh had picked the Six to win
the series and at last believed their
dope was coming true, announced to
their readers that the ! Reds , had
cracked and that the Sox weer in
showed great dags. In the sixth and
seventh games he fall down poorly.
Buck was one of the real heroes of
the Sox.
In the outfield Eddie Roush was
the star of nil. Time and again he
pulled off sensational catches and
saved the Red pitchers. In exeey
game played he has a wonderful catch
or two to his credit. One of the
backers of the Reds presented Eddie
; with a handsome gold watch valued
at more than $500 for his great work
in the series. His. batting was not
as good as his fielding. He hit .214,
while. Xeale hit .357, and"' Duncan .269
Both Nealo and Duncan ' performed
tnat; miraculously at times, f The trio out
won the American league flag. Thefsnone the Sjx jn tne field every day
Sox were in their true form all right, 0f lne series
but the Reds proved they naani
their old-time form the I form
cracked when they murderously as
saulted the Sox and won by a 10 to
5 count.
The writer picked out the Reds
: atfer seeing them work many times
during the National league season.
There was a certain something about
them that, made one feel confident
they would win out against any team
in baseball. They went about their
work with a dash and determination.
They were never flashy and perhaps
did look mediocre In their fielding
and hitting at times, but they nearly
always won.
But. the one winning factor the
pitching staff was why I picked
them to beat the Sox and that pitch
ing staff delivered true to form.
There were some well pitched
games in the series. Cicotte pitched
two. I expected that. Ruether
pitched a great game opening day.
Hod Eller performed twice in grand
shape and old Slim Sallee marked up
a victory. Jimmy Ring, who I
thought might be a dark horse, turned
in one of the best pitched games of
the series. Claude Williams didn't
come up to my expectations but Dicky
Kerr "surprised all of us. '
Outside the pitching the Reds out
classed the Sox with about three
excetpions. Ray Schalk was not out
classed. Neither .was Buck Weaver
or Joe Jackson. The others were
The mighty Eddie Collins was out
classed by Morris Rath, a White Sox
castoff. Rath outhit Eddie .226 to
.219. He scored five runs to Eddie's
two. Both made two errors and a
bad nlav or two. Collins showed
poorly. Rath outdid himself.
In figures Gandil looks equal to
Daubert, but the fans who saw the
series know that old Jake pulled
some miraculous fielding stunts
around the initial sack. Jake batted
.241 to Gandil's .233. Jake had two
errors and Gandil one. Among the
hits each had a triple.
Kopf far outclassed Risberg, both
in fielding and hitting. He cut down
some almost sure hits. Risberg was
an easy target. Kopf had one error,
Ribberg four. Kopf batted .222 and
Risberg only .080.
Buck Weaver showed better at
third. Heinie Groh had several .er
rors and mi&plays chalked against
him. He also failed to bat. Hia bat
ting mark was .172, while Duck hit
the ball at a .321 clip. Heinie had
two errors and Weaver none. In the
first few games of the series Heinie
covered the ground wonderfully and
EVERETT TRUE
Joe Jackson wielded a hefty bat.
He clouted at a .375 'clip. Felsch dis
appointed Sox fans by hitting only
.185. John Collins hit .250 and Nemo.
Leibold .56.
For the series the Reds batted .255
and the Sox .224.
For the season the Reds batted .268
and the Sox .282.
Doesn't that prove the superiority
of National league pitching this year?
The Reds outfielded the Sox in the
series .966 to .965.
The Reds hit for 87 bases and the
Sox for 58. The Reds made 35 runs
and the Sox 20.
The Reds made seven double plays,
the Sox nine.
The Sox had 45 men left on bases
and the Reds had 37.
The Reds stole six bases off Schalk
and Lyynn, and the Sox stole four off
Rariden and Wingo.
The Reds made eleven sacrifice
hits and the Sox six.
The Reds had two sacrifice flies
and the Sox one.
Two of the games, the first ana
last, were routs. Two other Red vic
tories were shutouts.
The best team won.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW
FRIDAY, OCTOBER 17, 1919'.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 16. The money
market was the one factor of para
mount importance on th stock ex
change today, all other considerations
being subordinated to the more rigid
tendencies manifested in that quarter.
For the first time in many months call
money opened at 10 per cent, with an
eager inquiry for time funds at 7 per
cent and little available at that figure.
The cull rate held at 10 per cent
throughout the session, but greater
care was exercised respecting the
character of the collateral.
Financial interests streesed the fact
that brokers' loan9 were again at the
high peak of the midsummer, while
last Saturday's clearing house state
ment disclosed a new high record for
actual loans and discounts at $ 5,433,
000,000. Stocks were firm to strong at the
outset, but fell back at the first indi
cation of tighter money, the market
lapsing into dullness during the inter
mediate period.
Heavy selling, which bore the marks
of bear pressure, occurred in the last
hour, leaders being forced to lowest
levels of the day, but a brisk rally en
sued on the further activity and
tfi riisnlavpd bv various special
ties, final quotations in many in
stances showing rallies of 2 to 5
points.!
Several speculative issues achieved
the distinction, of scoring new maxi
mums, notably Bethlehem,' Chandler,
Pierce Arrow and Republic Motors,
Remington Typewriter and American
Ship and Commerce, a newcomer on
the board. Extreme gains in these
stocks ranged from- 4 to 12 points.
Sales 1,400,000 shares.
Foreign exchange continued to
move against London and continen
tal centers, a new low record being rt
ported for Austrian remittances.
. Liberty 3's again featured Uie
bond market on their further advance
to 101, the year's best price. Foreign
issues were steady, but the general
domestic list eased. Total sales, par
value $14,750,000. Old United States
were unchanged on call.
THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 16. Corn tended up
ward in value today as a result of
wet weather and scantiness of rural
offerings. The market closed firm, c
to c net higher with December
$1.22 to $1.22 and May $1.21.
Oats gained to c. In provisions
the outcome varied from 10c decline
to 45c advance.
Rains put fresh Btrength Into the
corn market at the outset, but soon af
terward the effect was temporarily
counterbalanced by an official fore
cast of clear skies and lower tempera
tures. Weakness of foreign exchange
and of quotations on hogs counted
also In a transient way against higher
prices for corn. Later, however, the
attention of the trade focussed more
and more on . reports that farmers
were showing an evident bias toward
a holiday policy and were putting
stress on the relative high cost of
other commodities than grain. Cover
ing by shorts ensued and the market
was bulging somewhat at the last in
the absence of any pressure to sell.
Buying by houses with seaboard
connections helped to strengthen the
oats market. In oats, as well as In
corn, the country was not selling
freely.
Provisions averaged higher chiefly
on account of the semi-monthly state
ment of warehouse stocks was bullish.

That Is the way McCoy Says His
Rheumatism Made Him Feel.
"Tanlac put me back on the job
again and I'm ten pounds heavier
than when I started taking it," said
H. McCoy, a well known plasterer, liv
ing at 50b Sixth avenue, South Seattle,
Wash.
"Stomach trouble and rheumatism
had kept after me for six years until
I had to quit my work entirely," he
continued. "From the back of my
neck down into my arms and shoul
ders the pains would strike me and
it seemed that all my muscles were
tied in knots. I couldn't lift my hand
to my head, and instead of getting
relief I got worse all the time. In
my right hip the rheumatism settled
and I got so I couldn't move without
being in such pain that big beads of
sweat would form on my forehead.
I would take a catch in my neck and
for days I wouldn't be able to turn
my head, and whenever I had to look
to one side or the other, I would have
to turn my whole body. My stomach
was in a terrible shape. After every
meal, my food would sour and form
gas which crowded up into my throat
and choked me until I couldn't get a
deep breath and my heart would skip
and flutter until I was afraid I had
heart trouble. I was dizzy all the
time and my head would swim until
I couldn't walk along the street with
out holding onto something. I was
half starved because I couldn't eat
anything to build me up and was go
ing down hill all the time.
"I actually believe Tanlac has saved
my, life, for I couldn't have kept up
much longer like I was. I saw Tanlac
advertised in the papers and started
taking it and commenced to improve
before I had finished the first bottle.
I have taken eight bottles so far and
am back on the job feeling fine. I
can do more work' In a day now than
I have been able to for years, and am
just like a new man. My meals are
a pleasure to me for I can eat any
thing I. want and I sure want, for mji
appetite has come back In full force.
The fluttering spells with my heart
have disappeared, gas does not form
In my stomach, and I haven't a pain
left. I can almost run up a ladder
when I am at work, for my arms and
legs are as good as new since the
rheumatism has gone. I can swing
my arms In a circle like a school boy
at play and never feel a catch or a
tinge of pain, ana am just simply a
well man, so It's no wonder I . praise
Tanlac, for it's the only medicine that
has ever helped me."

WILL SEE FAST
GO OCT. 24
Tweniy-six rounds of fisticuffs will
make up the fiffht card to be staged
under the direction of O. S. French
at the Grand t,heater on the evening
of October 24, according to the sched
ule completed yesterday. Three of
the four bouts which have been ar
ranged have all the complexion of
majn events gos, while the curtain
raiser will be more than satisfactory,
both boys having put up a good slug
fest here before.
In the main event Johnny Celmars,
of Los Angeles, and Frank Loughery,
Philadelphia Bearcat, will step 10
rounds. Both men have been fighting
regularly, and are In th epink of condi-1
tion. Loughery la working out twice
a day at the Knights of Columbus
hall, while Celmars has been boxing
steadily and will be In Bisbee next
Monday to put on the finishing
touches for his go with the Bisbee
pride.
The semi-final will be between
Johnnie Meyers of Bisbee and Kid
Muscovie of El Paso, who was rec
ommended to Manager French by
'Jack McDonald, the El Paso referee,
who said in his telegram that French
should put on the best he has for the
El Paso stepper. In a subsequent
telephone' communication with
French, McDonald said that Muscovie
was exceptionally fast, a hard hitter,
end in every respect worthy of the
consideration of Warren district fans.
This bout will go six rounds.
Mauch and Collins, both willing
Bcrappers, will tangle in the second
preliminary, which win also go six
rounds. It is believed that this bout
and the Meyers-Muscovie mixup will
closely approach the main event in
interest. Mauch and Collins went
four rounds to a draw at Douglas a
few weeks ago.
The curtain raiser will . be four
rounds between Higgins and Gatjens,
local boys.
After Monday, according to Man
ager French, the fans will have an
opportunity to see all the .fighters in
their workouts and to judge for them
selves the quality of boxing which
he is endeavoring to offer Bisbee
fight fiends.

Plans for the solicitation of funds
during the week of October 19-26 with
which to "assist in the erection of a
memorial to Theodore Roosevelt have
been started by the Roosevelt Memo
rial association, and the working
committee for Cochise county, under
J. C. Ryan, county chairman, was
chosen yesterday. T. A. Egan is sec
retary. The county chairmen are as
follows: Ira B. Jerolaman, Warren;
W. II. Webster, Douglas; J. N. Gaines?,
Tombstone; A. G. Smith, Benson; H.
A. Morgan, Willcox; C. M. Renault,
Pearce; John Penberthy, Gleeson; J.
A. Jaque, Howie; J- H. Chamberlain,
San Simon; Arthur Heney, Fair
banks; William Goodman, St. David;
John Towner, Naco; Wm. Johnson,
Hereford; G. J. McCabe, Garces;
Wm. Riggs, Dos Cabezos. Miss Elsie
Toles, county school director.
The state executive committee in
cludes , the following: Thomas E.
Campbell, state chairman, Phoenix;
James H. McClintock, campaign di
rector, Phoenix; Dwight B. Heard,
Phoenix; Allen H. Ware, Kingman J
John C. Greenway, Warren; James S.
Douglas, Douglas; E. S. Clark, Pres-cott;.W-
C. Foster, state treasurer.
. The memorial movement is abso
lutely non-partisan, and has attracted
much interest in Arizona, in which
state Roosevelt was always intensely
Interested. The national committee
was created by a resolution of the
Republican national national com
mittee, -with CoL William Boyce
Thompson as chairman, who selected
a number of close friends and asso
ciates of Roosevelt to assist him in
the work.
Every cent collected by the Memo
rial association will be spent upon
the monument, the expenses of col
lection and administration being cov
ered by gifts from personal friends
of the former president.
The following extracts from a com
munication from James H. McClin
tock, state director of the movement,
will be particularly interesting to
citizens of Cochise county:
It is a matter of especial gratifica
tion to State unector McClintock
that the very first direct subscrip
tion to reach his office for the
Roosevelt memorial fund came from
a Rough Rider, a member of the regi
ment commanded by Roosevelt in the
war with Spain. It came from H. A.
Lusk of Chiricahua, Cochise county,;
Arizona, the subscriber proudly sign-!
ing himself, "Private Troop D, First!
U. S. Volunteer Cavalry," which sig-
nifies that he was in the Oklahoma j
troop of Rough Riders in 1898. The;
check has been .forwarded to County
Chairman J. C. Ryan at Bisbee, forj
inclusion within the Cochise, county
quota.
Also of interest is the fact that the
very first membership in Arizona
was demanded by Phoenix camp,
United Spanish War Veterans, which
voted $25 of its funds for the pur-j
pose. . ' I
