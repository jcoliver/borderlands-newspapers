SI THE BISEEE DAILY REVIEW, SATURDAY, MARCH 1, 1919.
THREE
PAVIKG ELECTION
REGISTRATION LOW
But eleven mnrp dava remain in
which to register to rote on the elec
tion on tne question of issuing bonds
for the paring of streets in Bis bee.
Owing to the fact that many are ot
the impression that they are already
reeistereJ. the reristration is not nrtv
pressing as rapidly as the friends of
tne issue deire.
Voting at this election, which will
be held on March 24 will be on an en
tirely new registration- In order to
register the voter must hare all the
qualifications of an elector for a reg
ular election. In addition hia name
must appear on the city tax rolls for
115. only qualified electors, who are
taxpayers are permitted to register.
Registration books were opened on
February 21 at the office of the city
clerk In the city hall and the office
of Hogan Seed. Under the ordi
nance providing for the election wid
registration, the books wCl be open
for registration tp to and Including
March 13.
The question calling for the issu
ance or per cent bonds In the
amount of $200,000, is one of the most
important that has been presented to
the. voters of the city. The apathy
shown up to the present in the mat
ter of registration comes as a surprise
to those who are manifesting Interest
In the ftnprovement of the city. There
is but slight opposition heard to the
proposition, but it Is realized that it
will be necessary for the friends of
civic Improvement to show their in
terest by registering and going to the
polls on the day of election.
It is pointed out by city officials that
more than one half of the bond issue
will fall upon the corporations within
the city and that the Individual tax
payers will have less than 50 per cent
of the increased taxation to meet.
The question to be submitted to the
voters calls for the grading, paving,
curbing and guttering of the following
streets: Main street and a portion of
Tombstone canyon running west to
the city limits; Lower Naco road from
East city limits to foot of Slag Dump
till; Brewery Gulch, Quarry Canyon
from Loretto school south for 750 feet;
Subway street. Upper Naco road from
City Hall to Phelps Dodge .office lot.

HIS BRIDAL NIGHT
Margaret Mayo's delightful musim
comedy, "His Bridal Night." will be'
the offering at the Grand theater on 1
Wednesday night. The piece possesses j
what most musical shows lack a sus-
tained story. It presents a compiica-j
tion of farcical situations resultm ,
from a bridegroom's mistake regard-:
tag twin sisters, one cf whom he his '
j At married. The plot is based on the j
substitution of the sister he did not I
marry. Of course the substitution is
discovered, but not until the audience j
has been treated to a series of situa-1
tions that bring the laughs at a fast j
and furious pace. "His Bridal Night." '
originally presented as a straight !
farce, has been given the additional '
advantage of an attractive chorus, j
and there have been interpolated nam-:
erous catchy songs and choruses by '
Frederick V. Bowers. Altogether it is
a very pleasing show and never fails '
to win the economioms of theater-1
goers. Prominent in the strong com
pany of fun-makers are John Roberts,

SEEKING SALVAGE
The Red Cross salvage and shop
department is establishing a record
for conservation throughout the coun

in normal life as was developed in
time of stress. It is said that "every
thing from a rusty pan to a new loco
motive and from a cannon to a canary
bird" comes to salvage and shop.
The local branch of the Red Cross
has issued the following appeal:
"In your spring clean-up cannot you
send to the Red Cross shop, in the
Hughes block, opposite the Y. M. C. A.,
some of your books, bedding, clothing
and shoes for men, women and chil
dren, household furnishings, or some
other articles you can spare? If you
cannot bring it to the shop, telephone

fBv Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz Feb. 23. Senasoi
Winsor threw a bomb at the house
land bill today when he brought in a
minerity report from the senate land
committee recommending that the bill
do not pass, and branding it as a flag
rant violation of the state constitu
tion. The majority report of the com
mittee favored the bill. Winsor's pro
test said:
"A minority of the committee on
public lands begs leave to report that
we have examined house bill 60, relat
ing to the removal of restrictions on
the leasing of state lands and recom
mend that it do not pass for the fol
lowing reasons:
Removes Safeguards
"Because it removes every safe
guard with which the law has hereto
fore surrounded the lands belonging
to the people of the state of Arizona.
"Because certain of its terms are
in conflict with provisions of the en
abling act and therefore could not
legally be carried into effect.
"Became it is a most flagrant vio
lation of the state constitution in that,
although by no stretch of imagina
tion can it be considered an emerg
ency measure, it nevertheless carried
an emergency clause which would
deny the right of the people, who al
ready have disapproved its provisions,
to exercise the right of referendum."
Has Stormy Record "
The bill under fire had 'a stormy
career in the house, where it wau the
object of close watch by both the cat
tlemen and the homesteaders. It pro
vides for the removal of the regulation
limiting an individual to one section
of leased lands and extends the life
of a lease from five to 20 years with
provision for readjustment of rentals
at the end of each, five years. It also
carries a clause to give homesteaders
preference in leasing adjacent lands.
During one of the debates in the
house Land Commissioner Moeur was
before the committee of the whole and
declared himself in favor of the bill.
On the other hand, representatives of
the homesteaders appeared to fight
the measure, asserting it was no im
provement on what they called the
present "dummy system" of leasing.
STATE TO ASSIST
BUILDING BRIDGE
(Ft Review r&se? TYlre)
FHOENTX. Ariz., Feb. 2S. The
house passed and sent to the governor
today the senate bill providing for the
building of a bridge across the Colo
rado river in Mohave county. Orig
inally this bill required the bridge to
be built at the mouth of the Grand
wash, but this provision was taken out
anJ it is left to the state engineer and
the county supervisors to choose the
location. The appropriation is $40,000,
to be matched by an equal amount
from Mohave county.
The senate made some minor chang
es in the house bill providing for the
holding of courts at Ajo, which were
approved by the house. This bill as
altered passed the senate finally and
was sent to the governor.

Register Early
Registration books of the city of Bisbee have been open for the past
ten dajB. To date few citizens have availed themselves of the oppor
tunity of enrolling their names. The registration is for the purpose
of holding an election to vote bonds for the paving of Bisbee's main
streets. Qualifications of roters are those of the general election plus
enrollment on the city tax books for 191S.
City officials.the councilmen, the engineer and the attorney have
worked untiringly to place this question before the citizens at the
earliest possible moment and have succeeded in establishing a record
for the 6tate in preparing to vote street improvement bonds. They
have acted because the work proposed is important to Bisbee and neces
sary, not alone to Bisbee, but the district and the county.
Paving of the streets will mean a better, cleaner city. It will mean
a more attractive district. It will mean more modern highways, better
flood control and less mud. And, it will mean new work lots of it
for unemployed residents of Bisbee.
Little opposition to the bonds has been offered. Everyone realizes
their importance, and practically everyone is in favor of their issu-
ance -
xl this does not mean the citizens should not vote."A"heavy vote
in favor of the improvement is as necessary as the paving itself. It is a
decided factor in promoting the sale of bonds.
If the vote is exceedingly small, buyers might question the legality
or desirability of the bonds. If it is large, this problem is minimized to
the limit.
Registration is necessary; voting equally as necessary.
As a good citizen, get busy!
Desirable Legislation
Erection of a monument to Arizona's sons and heroes in the war is
proper and fitting.
Compilation of the war records of Arizonans is equally important.
The latter demands time; the first should occupy time, for without
the latter the erection of some suitable memorial would be practically
impossible.
Senate Bill 114 provides for a full record of Arizona's soldiers.
Senate Bill 119 provides for the erection of a memorial.
The former would create a war service registrar; the latter a com
mission to determine on and recommend a suitable monument.
Tota should go hand in hand ; it might be desirable even to incorpor
ate the two measures in one, making the registrar chairman of the
commission.
Several tills providing for erection of a state memorial have been
put forward in each branch of the legislature. Each, however, except
Senate Bill 115, has had the same fault the provision of the manu
zaent at once. Haste in honoring Arizona's soldiers will prove fatal.
Time will provide a suitable monument, erected to all Arizonans in the
war, and embodying merit. . ,
At the close of the Spanish- American war, every city and village in
the Ltuea States reared some monument to the memory of heroes. Of
the Uiousands erected, but one or two were of artistic or economic
vaiue. The rest were so much iron or bronze cast up and sold like
country fair pottery.
Arizona does not want any cheap makeshift or hastily chosen and
pcorly designed monument.
Our Business Government
Postmaster General Burleson has announced that where telephone
exchanges do not pay expenses and a fair dividend they will be closed,
as it is not the policy of the government to do a losing business. It may
be presumed that such exchanges were not doing a losing business
before the government took them over, otherwise their -private owners
would have discontinued them. So the closing of them would be regarded
as a retiection upon the government's capacity for doing business.
But dismissing that matter, we are sure that the postmaster general
is in error in stating that it is not the policy of the government to
continue a losing business. From a financial point of view, every func
tion of the government is a losing business. If they were all paying
businesses there would be no taxes; we would all live and thrive on the
profits accruing from the operations of the government. We would all
be dividend-receivers instead of taxpayers.
The postoffice itself for many years was a steadily losing business
and we suppose that if the truth were known and the bookkeeping of
the postal department was like any other bookkeeping on earth, it would
be shown that it is still a losing business. The railroads have been a
heavily losing business under the management of the government. Every
thing the government touches becomes a losing business.
The government is the worst business director in the whole world.
It knows nothing about business. If a peanut stand was conducted with
so little regard for the ordinary rules of business It would not last a.
week. Arizona Repubican.
Military Punishments
Xo civilian can be convinced that a soldier leaving camp without
permission, to visit his sick wife and child, deserves fifteen years' im
prisonment; that a raw recruit deserves forty years imprisonment for
telling an arrogant officer to "go to hell," or that a soldier who re
fused to drill when he was tired and sick deserves a death sentence.
In these and many similar cases there may have been a lamentable lack
of respect or tact or common sense on the part of the privates concerned ;
but there was still more obviously a lack of justice on the part of the
military courts that sat in judgment.
Brigadier General Ansell deserves the gratitude of the nation for
bringing such abuses to public notice. It appears that the United
States army, despite it essential democracy in nearly all other respects,
has the most tyrannous system of discipline found in any of the big
allied military establishments. This is not Prussia. There is no appar
ent reason why military offenses should be punished far more, severely
in America than in France or England.
The war department has taken up the matter. So ias congress.
It may be hoped that the rigorous system which has so long existed in
our army without the public being aware of it will now bo modified to
accord with American ideas of justice, and that large numbers of soldiers
condemned to excessive punishment for trivial offenses will have their
cases reviewed and their sentences cut down. Arizona Star.
Being Human
Wcodrow Wilson once wrote a book called 'On Being Human." There
are so many men like cigar store Indians "and so many women like
style shop waxworkers that we now say a person is "human" if he or
she acts like he or she feels. The point is brought out in a story the
European papers are printing about President Wilson.
He was walking to a golf course one morning hen a small boy on
the road stuck out his tongue at the president of the United States. A
friend said the boy ought to be corrected."
"I corrected liim.' all : right," said the president. "How was that?"
aked the friend. "You said nothing." "No." replied the president,
"but 1 made a worse face at him."
Lt it be said to the everlasting crcait of our boj6 in Russia that
they fought as well as if they had known why they were there.

FROM U. S. FIDS
Bureau of Public Highways
Sends Statement to Arizona
Legislature Outlining Allot
ment for Next Three Years
(By Eeview Leased 'Wire'
PHOEXIX. Ariz Feb. 2S. The bu
reau of public roads of the United
States department of egriculture sent
through the land commission to the
legislature a letter with the informa
tion that 53.767.799 represented the
grand total which would be "allotted to
Arizona for road buildine during the
years 1919-20 and 1921 if the bill now
before congress becomes law.
The bureau's engineer explainer
that the estimate was forwarded at
this time so that the Arizona legis
lature, if it wished, might pattern its
new road acts to co-operate with fed
eral aid.
Debated Bill. Hidden
The much debated senate bill 17.
the highway measure which already
has started two heated partisan de
bates in the house, failed to come ou
of the enrolling and engrossing com
mittee today, but senate bill 116. an
other road bill to provide $100,000 to
meet federal aid requirements, did
make its appearance.'1 This bill is
similar to the house bill which was
incorporated .in the senate highway
measure and it was laid over till Mon
day, the understanding befcig that if
senate bill 17 is passed there will be
no need for the other, and if 17 fails
the other can be brought forward.
One of the first bills introduced
this session, that to give labor liens
first place over other claims on con
tract work, came up in committee of
the whole and was laid over till Mon
day. The committee of the whole favor
ably recommended the bill to estab
lish a tuberculosis sanitorium in the
state.
School Bill Fails
The jeducational bill, providing for a
county unit system of schooles to cor
respond to the matter of another
house measure, failed to gain suffici
ent support and was recommended for
indefinite postponement.
The proposed legislation against
fraudulent conveyances advanced an
other step and was recommended for
passage. This measure is drafted aft
er the form of similar legislation pass
ed in other states at the instance of
the judiciary committee of the Amer
ican Bar association, and is aimed at
those who would seek to avoid the
payment of just debts by means of
fraudulent conveyances.
Among the bills passed by the house
were the following:
House bill 50, known ?s the educa
tional code bill, which aims tu reorgan
ize the system of the date. This cow
goes to the senate.
House bill 116. appropriating $63.0u
for a bridge over the Gila-river on
the Globe-Solomonviile highway in
Graham county, and for rtpuirt- to tn,t
San Carlos bridge.
House bill 11. to complete the col
lection, preservation aud publication
of Arizona historical data.
Settlement Bill Passes
House bill 51. providing for co-opt ra
iti'ii bitwt i u the f-tatt " aiA ttiL' fcricr;il
authorities in the settlement of rc-
House bill 100, to appropriate $200
to defray the cost of painting the por
turned fichting men on Arizona lands,
traits of the president of the senate
and the speaker of the house.
Two new bills were brought dowr
in the house. Waters introduced a
measure requiring that the corpora
tion commission "shall see that all
the laws respecting the production and
distribution of films for moving pic
tures are faithfully executed and sn
have the sole power to issue certifi
cates of incorporatiou to producing
and distributing companies organized
under the laws of this state, and to is
sue licenses to such companies to do
business in this state." The bill bars
members and employes of the corpora
tion commission from connection with
any film company. A fine up to $5000
and revocation- of license is provided
for general infractions of the proposed
law.
Coleman fathered a bill to appropri
ate 515.000 to pay for the drilling of
an experimental artesian well in the
Casa Grande. valley, Pinal county, by
the agricultural experimental depart
ment of the state university.

sport followers were busy today
circulating a petition to be pre
sented to, the present state legisla

a law legalizing 20-round boxing
exhibitions in this state. An or
ganization was formed to boost
the fight law and make a bid tor

fight game in this city promise
to make an attractive offer to Tex

8Y REVIEW
NEW YORK. Feb. 2S. Pools and
the professional element as a whole
continued in absolute control of the
stock market today, but the shifting
course of prices made considerable
uncertainty throughout the session.
Steels, oils, motors and various un
classified specialties were under con
stant pressure, while shippings, leath
ers, distilling shares and an unusual
assortment of equipments feature the
long account.
A five point drop in General Motors
created unsettlement soon after the
opening, numerous automobile issues
and allied stocks losing 1 to 4 points.
Other recent favorites reacted 1 to 3
points, but the movement was checked
by aggressiveness of the entire ship
ping, list.
American Car, American Locomo
tive, Central Leather, Hide and Leath
er. United Cigars, Industrial Alcohol,
American Zinc, Butte and Superior
Mining and Pacific Telephone yielded
some of their 2 to 4 point gains.
The reaction of the last hour was
caused by heavy selling of Royal
Dutch and Mexican Petroleum, Rails
and United States Steel also giving
way. Steel was irregular at best de

conditions, and closed a point down

Liberty bonds rallied after earlv ;

advace of the last few days. Other
domestic issues, rails as well as in
dustrials, were steady and foreigns
held firm. Total sales, par value, ag

States bonds were unchanged on call.

BRADSTREET'S REVIEW
NEW YORK. Feb. 2S- Bradstreets
tomorrow will say:
While the trade and industrial pace
Is stiil of a cautious character, evi
dences of moderate improvement in
distribution are now too numerous to
be denied. Certain influences, that,
compared with a month ago, there are
i fewer poor reports and a resume of
both wholesale and retail trade of in
djstml conditions and of collections
reveals the general trend to be rather
above than below fair. Stormy weather
and a return of winter temperatures
in the northen half of the country
with a natural effect on country roads
have not been altogether favorable.
The general trade movement has been
fairly well maintained throughout the
month. A survey still further back
reveals that business has come
through the winter in better shape
than even some sanguine, ones had
predicted.
