Brit'sh Forces Penetrate the German Lines and Capture Com

Wing and Push Bosch Forces Back Over a Mile In Depth. '
Flood Conditions Are Nearly Insurmountable.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
The big fight it on again in Flanders, and the Germans are being ham
mered hard. Field Marshal Haig is battering away on the sector east and
northe?stf Ypres, while French troops have joined with the British left wing
to the couth of Dixmude in an effort to bring that section of the line even with
the sharp wedge that has been driven into the German front by Haig east of
Broodseinde.
ATTACK TOGETHER.
Launching their attacks simultaneously Tuesday morning, both, armies
had made considerable gains before nightfall, in addition to inflicting heavy
casualties on the Germans and taking many prisoners. Prior to the announce
ment of the commencement of the attack there had been no intimation that
the Frenchmen were ready for an advance. In fact, it had been rather ex
pected that even the British commander-in-chief would delay taking the ag-;
gressive again for several days owing to the terrible condition of the ground!
he is in quest of a veritable marsh owing to the heavy rains of Sunday and!
Monday. !
FLOODED RIVERS CROSSED. I
With apparent ease the Frenchmen crossed the flooded Broenbeke and:
Jansbeek rivers and captured the villages of St. Jean de Mangelare and Veld-j
hoek, together with numerous blockhouses and took prisoner several hundred;
Germans. Ths French advance was over a front of more than a mile and they i
penetrated the German line to a depth of one and a quarter miles. j
HAIG'S OFFENSIVE.
Haig's principal offensive centered on the portions of the Passchendaele-.
Gheluvelt ridge still held by the Germans, being directed eastward from ;
Poelcapelle which was captured and northeastward from Broodseinde toward'
Passchendaele, the ultimate objective still being the Ostend-Lille road. Taken j
as a whole, the joint operation makes more apparent tne crowning aesire or,
the allies in this region the forcing back of the Germans to points where!
their evacuation of Ostend and Zeebrugge, naval and submarine bases on the:
North Sea, will become necessary. j
SHARP CONTESTS. " j
At several points Haig's advance was sharply contested by the Germans
particularly north of Broodseinde, the nearest approach to the railway
line, and near the Folderhoet' Chateau.. Nowhere, hqwever, were the Ger-
mans able to stoD the advance. exceDt near the Polderhoek Chateau where-
the terrific fire of their machine quns

for the regular army will be enough
to keep that branch of the nation's
forces filled up to strength without
transferring men to it from this first

Plot Discovered
in German Navy
by the Officers
(By Review Leased Wire)
COPENHAGEN. Oct. 9 Vice Ad
miral von Cappeile, German minister
of marine, announced in the reichstag
today that a plot had been discovered
in hte navy to form a committee of
delegates on the Russian model, and
to paralyze the fleet so as to force
the government to make peace. The
guilty parties have been arrested and
have reecived their just deserts, the
minister added.
Admiral von Cappeile attempted lo
link (he radical socialists with the
plot. He said the ringleader had dis
cussed the plot with Deputies llaase
and Vogtherr in the radical socialist
conference in the reichstag building.
The deputies had called attention to
the dangerous nature of the plot and
had advised the greatest caution, but
had agreed to furnibh propaganda ma
terial.
Socialist depu'ies interrupted the
speakers with cries or dissent. Dep
uty David of the majority socialists
demanded the government produce
proof and that the reichstag should
suspend judgmnt in the meantime.
The disclosures in connection with
the radical socialists, if they are true,
came most opportunely to help the
government out of its embarrassment
over the Interpellation regarding pan-
German propaganda.

Prisoners have been brought back
In large numbers. The battle opened
at 5:20 under a clear sky, but the
ground had been turned into a morass
in many places by the recent heavy
rains. It was especially difficult for
operations along the northern section
of the attack, where there are many
little rivers bordered with hiMrshy
ground.
The gunfire from both the British
and French artillery was terrific at
the hour of attack and the preliminary
bombardment had been intense for
days.
The German artillery was replying
weakly this morning at most places.
British Official
LONDON. Oct. 9. The British
troops have effected the complete cap
ture of Poelcapelle and have advanced
nearly two miles to the northwest of
the village in their drive in Flanders
today.
According to the report from Field
Marshal Haig tonight, the British op
erations were very successful. All ob
jectives have been gained and the
numbtr of prisoners alieady exceeds
1000.
The text of the communication fol

Poilus Overrun
Belgian Terrain
(Continued From Page One.)
Germans were changing the troops
occupying their front lines. A Ger
man division was just handing over
the lines to a fresh division recently
arrived from the Russian front. The
French with wonderful dash were
upon them before they realized the
situation and killed many of them.
There was a short respite before
the next forward movement was un
dertaken in co-operation with the
British, who were advancing simulta
neously on the French right. Slither
ing along over the broken and muddy
ground, the French troops made their
way quickly toward Manselaere, whihe
soon fell int otheir possession.
The whole scheme of operations for
the day had been carried out long be
fore noon. The infantry's advance
wps greatly assisted by the daring of
the aviators, who would not permit
the weather conditions to interfere
with their work. They flew low over
the German lines, taking capital pho
tographs, and then returned in a fear
ful gale to their bases to turn in their
reports.
Meanwhile not a single German air
plane was seen in the air.
The result of the day's figh ing. in
audition to the men and material cap
tured. Is that the forest of Huolthoulst,
which comprises five or six miles of
thickly wooded ground, now is virtu
ally flanked on both sides. As far as
can' be learned, the wood contains
considerable artillery and large num
bers of machine guns, but the Ger
mans must find extraordinary diffi
culty in keeping them supplied.
For the moment the French troops
are occupied in consolidating the
ground wno. which, although small in
extent, represents an invaluable grin,
as it deprives the Germans of their
points of observation.
PARIS OFFICIAL STATEMENT.
PARIS, Oct. 9. The capture of the
villages of St. Jean de Mangelaere

THREE
Heavy Rain Causes Change of
Date for First New York Game
Between Leaders of Leagues
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Oct. 9. Heavy rein
which began shortly before noon,
caused a postponement until tomor
ro of the third world's series ganie:
scheduled for today between the Chi
cago White Sox and the New York
Giants. Rain fell during the night ,
and early morning but there was ev-,
ery indication that the game would
be played until the beginning of the
heavy downpour that lasted all after- j
pion. The forecast for tomorrow is ,
fair and warmer. Rain today was ac- j
companied by a decided drop in temp-,
erature. There was evidence that the j
game would have been attended by ai
capacity crowd for fully 15,000 Fpecta-(
tors were In the Polo Grounds stands
when the official announcement of the
postponement was made. The lines ,
in front of the gates extended for sev ;
eral blocks when the 'ticket boxes!
were opened early in the forenoon ;
and the men and boys, many of whom '
.had Mood in line all night, fild in-
to the grounds. i
Every Ticket Sold. j
As usual every ticket sold today
had a rain check attached which will
be good only for the third game cf
the series. Many of these found their,
way into the hands of speculators.
In most cases the rain checks were
sold at a profit to the holders.
When the first squall came the dia-,
mond was uncovered and the playing
surface hard and fat, but so quickly !
did the rain fall that the base paths!
were heavy before the groundkeeper
and his helpers could spread the j
waterproof mats. Tonight there was
every indication that opening game;
here would be played under much the ;
same surface conditions as prevailed
last Saturday at Chicago. !
Remain In New York. I
Under the ruling of the national '
commission the teams must remain
in this city until two games have been
played. If the clubs are able to re-i
sume their struggle here tomorrow
and the Giants wen one r both con-1
tests, the teams will return to Chica-;
go for a single game there next Sat-1
urday, instead of Friday as originally ,
scheduled. If a sixth game is neces
sary to decide the series, the teams ,
will leave Chicago Saturday night and !
take up the play again at the Polo ,
Grounds the. following Monday.
Giant May Improve. j
Many close followers of baseball
and the adherents in particular, ex-1
pressed the opinion that the delay of
a day or two would improve the
chances of the National league rep
resentatives. It was figured that the
White Sox, because of their double
victory have got the jumps on the
Giants and that a break in the succes
sion of games would afford the New '
York players a chance to show to bet
ter advantage and steady down. The
New York fans are pulling hard for
their favorites to win two straight on
the home grounds. Many of them con
tend that if this does happen the Xa
ticnals will go to t.he front and win'
the series. ,
Rain Is Disappointment.
The postponement proved a severe
disappointment to thousands of base-,
ball enthusiasts who had come from
distant points to witness the battle.
Almost every city and town through
out New England and middle Atlantic
states was represented by delegations
large and small. Many had arranged
to be absent from their business for
only one day and there was a rush of
telegrams and long distance telephone
calls as soon as it was definitely
known that the national commission
had decided to postpone the opening
game ?iere until tomorrow.
There was quiet rejoicing among
the hotel proprietors and theatre
managements, however, for the post
ponement meant an additional harvest
of currency from the fans who were
obliged to add another day to their
visit in this city If they wished to
see the contest.
Rooms at Premium.
Rooms at all the hotels throughout
the central belt of Manhattan Island
were at a premium long before night
fall and many mans tramped miles
in the rain, bags in hand, before they
were able to get accommodations.
There was also a rush for theatre
tickets and the box offices were soon
sold cut leaving the visitors to the
mercy of the ticket speculators who
quickly raised the price of their paste
boards, forcing the more economical
of the fans to the moving picture
places.
The postponement also furnished a
new topic of discussion for all those
directly and indirectly interested in
the world's series. Weather reports
were in great demand and there were
many allusions to the famous 1911
series between the New York Na
tionals and the Philadelphia Ameri
cans. Big Talk.
Close followers of baseball and
world's series play in general recall
ed that in that series there was a full
lapse of six days between the third
and fourth games. Heavy an continu
ous rain caused the commission re
peatedly to call off the scheduled
game until many fans, tired of delay,
sold their tickets to the speculators
for a fraction of their face value and
returned to their home towns. Since
that date the series has been played
each year without a postponement oj
break, except where a Sunday inter
vened, until today.
The consensus of opinion tonight
was that Cicotte would pitr'i for Chi
cago tomorrow and that he would b".
opposed by Sallee c-f New York. The
probable batting order:

Had Rheumatism So Bad She
I Couldn't Walk About House
I After Taking Tanlac
Walks Miles With Ease.
One of the strongest and most con
vincing evidences of the wonderful re
sults being accomplished by Tanlac
throughout the south is the large num
ber of letters that are being received
daily from scores of well known men
and women who have been benefitted
by its use.
Among the large number that have
ben received in the past few days.
none are more in( resting than the'
following letter from L. C. Ackerman, j
of the Rison Drug company. Ri.n, I
Ark., which is self-explanatory.
"Rison, Arkansas.
C. F. Willis, Atlanta. Ga.
Dear Sir: I am enclosing herewith
a statement I obtained from one of my
good Tanlac customers this morning.
The case that Frank Cuthbertson. of
Clio, Ark., reports tf his mother is a
very remarkable one. as she had not
been able to do anything to speak of
for several years, while now she can
walk a mile with little inconvenience.
There are anumber of remarkable cas
es in my locality. One of my best
friends has used seven bottles of Tan
lac and shows a gain of 22 p'junds and
has a very extravagant appetite.
Yours truly,
(Signed) L. C. Ackrman."
Mr. Cuthbertson's statement regard
ing his mother's experience with Tan
lac is as follows:
"My mother has taken five bottles of
Tanlac and has gained 20 pounds. I
never saw such a change in anybody in
all my life as Tanlac has made in her.
About three years ago, she happened
to a hard fall, which left her all run
down and very weak. She suffered 1
with rheumatism most all the time and
her feet would swell and hurt her so
she wasn't able to get about, not even j
to walk around the house. I think i
her troubles were all "caused by the
tall and she just suffered nearly all
the time and kept losing weight until
she got to taking Tanlac.
"Why mother commenced to show
Improvement almost as soon as she !
started on Tanlac. Her appetite got
better and she began t pick up in
weight and get stronger. She is 60
years old now, and it certainly is won
derful what Tanlac has done for her.
She can walk any reasonable distance
by herself now, and she's in better
health than I have seen her in six
years. I simply can't tell you how
proud we all are of Tanlac, and how
we appreciate what it has done for
mother."
"Tanlac is sold in Bisbee by J. M.
Bll. in Do'j;;las by Douglas Drug Co.,
n Paradise by G. A. Walker, in Rowio
bv Bowie Drug Store, in San Simon
t y J. B. Cooke, and in Willcox by A.

Are Preparing to
Leave Douglas
"For the next two weeks I will be
in Douglas packing up our belongings
and disposing of some of them not
desired to move. Then Mrs. French
and I are going to California for a
visit of some length. During my ab
sence in the east I became much inter
ested in the vast amount of work to
be done in supporting our armies and
giving them assistance in the great
war. I met several personal friends
who are engaged in Red Cross work,
and I have signified my willingness
to volunteetjny services to any duty
which it is thought I can perform to
the benefit of my country. I hope
that I may be assigned to some de
partment of the war work in the near
future and will await any command
that may come."
Thus spoke S. W. Frnech Monday
morning when he was called over the
telephone and asked as to bis future
intentions now that he has resigned
from bis position in the Phelps Dodge
corporation organization. Mr. and
Mrg. French arrived home Monday
night from the east, where they had
been during the summer. Mr. French
left Douglas early in June, Mrs. French
following about the middle of July.
It was announced in this paper two
weeks ago that Mr. French had re
tired from his position with the min
ing company and quite naturally there
has been speculation as to what would
be his future plans. His friends here
will be pleased to know that he has
offered his services to his country, as
they regard him as one of the very
able business men of the county and
one that would strengthen any depart
ment of the war service to which he
msy be assigned. Douglas International.

Wednesday Morning, October 10, 1917.
When the German government broke irrevocably with
the United States some five months ago on account of
ruthless U-boat warfare, the German chancellor declared
that his country was playing its last card. The other
day insurance rates were cut twenty-five per cent. If
Germany has no more cards up its sleeve it would seem
that the game is nearly over.
"Deep wells prove that a vast body of water under
lies the City of 1 Paso." is a startling headline in the
Herald of that city. And pray, good people of Bisbee,
if pure water underlies El Paso with its sandy wastes
and ring of mountains and plateu formation, why not
this place? Bisbee needs a "vast body of pure water"
bad enough to dig a deep well for it even if the chances
are against the strike. Many a town has gone dry for
years just because it never dug down deeper than for
a cistern to hold rain water, and then found water just
because some man or set of men who were called cranks,
dug down and kept on digging.
Judging from the premium list and general announce
ments made from Phoenix the State Fair, which will be
held the week of November 12-17, gives promise of be
ing the greatest ever this year. Livestock and mining
exhibits and racing will be the three great features, but
the agricultural products from the fertile valleys and Ir
rigated lands of the state will also make a splendid show
ing at the big fair, according to the officials. Phoenix
is wonderful in the fall. The state will be there, or all
of it except a few sentries left behind on the old home
walls. A great state fair is a great asset to any state.
It stirs pride and quickens competition and improves
products. It also gets folks acquainted with each other.
The Review is strong for the State Fair.
Germany had a corruption fund for every purpose
under the sun. She spend money by the hundreds of
thousands in Prussian propagandas in this country and
in Mexico and in Russia, but no one believed it until
the last expose, that she was" foolish enough to spend it
in France. With the fairest lands of France ravished ana
the Rheims cathedral in ruins and French blood flowing
in a stream from the forests of Arragone to the sea, it
seems inconceivable that the German government could
have hoped to influence French opinion with money.
The Prussian has a way all his own, and thoughts and
methods of analysis all his own. He has overrated his
own powers and underrated those of his enemies. But
his worst mistake of all was that he took no thought
of the ideals of other nations.
Rain has saved the Germans again, according to the
last dispatches from the western front. The field of
Flanders is a quagmire, say the correspondents with the
British army. There is not a shadow of a doubt but that
Haig's last blow had the German line reeling, and an
other offensive this week might well have resulted in the
greatest victory of the war. Rain also saved the New
York Giants yesterday. The victorious White Sox of
Chicago were sweeping on. The psychology of success
was theirs. At rest of two days may rally the slipping
hosts of New York and give them a chance to make a
harder fight for the baseball championship. Rain does
lots of harm in the world. It spoils picnic parties and
takes the creases out of Reginald's trousers and ruins
parades and cuts roads to pieces and floods the lowland
and makes folks sad and gloomy. But it also paints the
fields a living green and gives the red blush to the rose.
The people who are waiting most anxiously for Halg to
smash Hindenburg will be given rain checks, just the
same as those who bought tickets for the game yester
day in New York. The pleasure will be deferred, that
is all. - It is maddening to think that the Hunnish host
are rallying behind the cloudbanks and the morasses
But later, next week, next month, next year, some time,
sure an fate, the Hun will have to fight straight through
to a finish on the high ground in both sunshine and in
rain and the end will be written when the fight is done.
NEAR THE CENTER OF THE KAISER'S PLOTTING
(New York World).
The revelations of Bolo Pasha's deviously operated
fund of nearly $1,700,000 in German Government money
can produce no novel sensation In America beyond the
amount involved. Count von BernstorfTs $50,000 for use
in influencing Congress "as on other occasions" implied
for similar uses some multiple of that sum which could
only be guessed. But Bolo Pasha's fund gives some
definite notion of what the Kaiser was spending and was
willing to spend in operations centering in the United
States to corrupt governmental agencies and poison pub
lic opinion and blow up ships and munition plants. It
was not tens of thousands of dollars but millions that
flowed out of the Spandau war-chest for these purposes.
Thus little by little the ramifications of this German
war of world conquest by intrigue and bedevilment are
uncovered until the central structure and agencies of it
all begin to stand out in clear outline and name. Ever
since Dr. Albert dropped bis bundle of incriminating
papers while trundling around New York it has been one
disclosure after another, one explosion and then another.
Some of the Kaiser's carefully planted bombs against
life and property have exploded with material damage.
But his bombs intended to blow up public opinion and
drive the fragments his way have exploded and continue
to explode, with nothing to show save a loss of his money
and the revelation to the world of the duplicity and
treachery and murderous determination of his own Im
perial Government
And all at the hands of the "blodsinnige Yankees!"
Nothing ever was or could be so very sly and so devilish
ly artful and clever as German efficiency in statecraft
and diplomacy, as in everything else, and here it is made
the joke of tbe world and the sardonic merriment of the
gods by a little effort on the part of von Papen's dis
covered order of organized Imbecility.
OUR AIRPLANE PROGRAM UP TO SCHEDULE.
Secretary of War Baker has made the following an
nouncement regarding tf.e aviation program about which
the department has been flooded with requests from the
press and the public:
"Contracts have been let and work is in progress on
practically the entire number of airplanes and motors
for which provision was made in the $640,000,000 Aviation
Bill passed by Congress In July. This programme called
for more than 20,000 airplanes.
"The types of airplanes now in process of manufac
ture cover the entire range of training machines, light
high speed fighting machines and powerful battle and
bombing planes of the heaviest design. Our contracts
call for an ample number of training machines and em
brace as well giant battle planes capable of the work of
of the Caproni, tbe Handley-Page and similar types.
"The comprehensive plan is that when motors are
ready there shall be ready also the planes necessary, and
when the motors and planes are ready aviators and ma
chine guns shall be available. Co-ordination has been
developed in every branch of the aviation section.
"Within a reasonable time, considering the period for
preparation, this country will send its first airplane to
Europe. This airplane, from the tip of its propellers to
the engine, machine gun and camera, will have been
made in the United States."
War economy is a good thing for families who are
able to stand the expense attached thereto. But in the
general run it costs money.
A wiseacre says, don't trust a girl who will not look
you full in the face. Don't know about that; she may
have a fine profile and know it.
It Is well to use good judgment even in religious mat
ters. It would never do to pray for rain, for instance,
when there was a rising barometer.
The demand for cooks in tbe army is being met, and
after the war it will never be necessary for wifey to get
up in the morning to get the breakfast.
The results before the exemption boards induce the
feeling that the doctors are more needed at home than
in the army. There are a lot of deficient men.
The Department of Agriculture says there is an abund
ance of jars. We should think as much, in reading over
the daily filings of divorce suits in our local courts.
There really ought to be an extra price paid for ac
commodations in an apartment house where a young
woman insists upon practicing "Oh, Promise Me" at all
hours of the day or night
A retail coal dealer writes In to The Review to de
clare that the increase in coal production has only been
9 per cent over last year, while the increase in demand
has been 100 per cent. He wants to know the answer.
A shiver. The Review would say.
One of the duties of our posterity will also be to prac
tice economy. The debt being created just now by leaps
and bounds will bring safety and democracy to the world
and it ill be worth all it costs. We can get no valuable
thing without making an investment.

CLANCY AT VIMY RIDGE.
W. C. Clancy, a Texas lad who had
enlisted with the Canadians, on learn
ing that the United States had declar
ed war on Germany, tied a flag to his
bayonet and charged up Vimy Ridge
with his command. He fell, wounded,
but not fatally.
They charged the roe up Vimy Ridge
that sun scorched day.
And though the flag of France fiew
free
Where all the battling hosts could see.
Yet up the reddening slope of death
Old Glory led the way.
A Texas lad heard our decree: "We
fight with France."
"Then leads this in the van." he cried.
And to his bayonet's point he tied
The Stars and Siripes, as knight of old
might wreathe bis lance.
And up the slipperyslope he sprang
no stay or stop.
Though foeman's shells rained thick
and fast.
And all 'of hell was in the blast
And he was blind with wounds and
blood, he reached the top!
His comrades cheered; but higher ye:,
above the shell fire's glow.
There watched, as from Frame's sen
try post
Another band that splendid host
That held, on Texas's deathless day,
the Alamo!
They crowded from the vast Unknown
heroes of long told story
To witness where the war gods strive.
How Texas Clancy kept alive the
flame of Texas's glory!

According to word received from
Clilton the smelter of the Arizona
Copper company for the present will
be operated as a custom plant. The
mines in the district have been sealed
following the refusal of the men to re
turn l'j work. There is no ore com
ing from the Arizona Copper company
mines and this has led to the determi
nation to operate as a custom smelter.

Though the principal crop of the
Salt River Valley is alfalfa, and
though upon the pasture are about 60,-1
000 cows, mainly of high grade s:ock,
the demand for milk and butter are
mounting, already at the highest points
ever known here. The cause ot high
prices is laid directly to the war. Hay
and feed are being drained from the
valley for the army camps and dairy
men are refusing to Increase their
herds on the ground that fodder may
rise to prohibitive prices. The most
potent cause of the rise of dairy pro
ducts in price is the consumption of
milk by a factory at Tempe, which now
' is filling an order for 20,000 cases for
, army camps and which has sent much
j of its products to the army in France.

Fighting Never Ceases.
"This is because the fighting on the
western fi'onl, as a matter of fact, prac
tically never ceases. Whether in the
! Grench sectors of Verdun or the Aisne
for selectine Liberty loan teams. The r " the BrUish sectors of Arras and
district is to be divided into 33 sec- Ypres, the fighting is only discontinu
tions. and each section is to have a ed at e Point o be taken up at an-
man captain and a woman captain.
They will select their assistants.
Gaines will prepare a set of instruc
tions for these section teams, and
they will be published shortly.
The selling campaign begins Mon

Winter Stops Activities.
'This constant activity, coinciding
with the weakness and inaction of the
Russians, also explains why the Ger

times larger forces on the French front

winter practically puts a stop to all
active operations and that the reac

on the eastern front has allowed Ger
many to consider it during four
months as a veritable reserve for the
western front.
Huns Fear Future.
"It clearly appears at present that

I Not content with declining to give bat

SPECIAL COUNCIL
A special meeting of the city coun-l

pose of accepting bids for an air com-1
pressor. This compressor will be
used in sinking the city well.
There were only two bids, the first j
from the Ingersoll Rand company,
whose bid was for $3,175. Don A.
Carpenter of El Paso submitted a bid j
from the Chicago Pneumatic Tool!
company at $2,850. The latter bid
.was accepted, me new machine is
of th? same type as that used by the

Defensive Moves.
I "They have then exchanged their
i picked troops of the eastern front for
i their inferior one of the landv.ehr.
"Finally once the battle began, in or
i der to hold out they have successive
ly replaced, number for number, ex
, hausted divisions from the French
front by divisions from the eastern
front.
-However, in spite of using all these
methods, where the latter have only
been possible this year, due to the
trouble made by the Russian revolu
tion, Germany has made her supreme
military effort.
"This is evidenced by the two follow
ing statements which should be c'jm-
tvtal strength is diminishing, Germany
finds herself obliged to increase her re
serves on the French front to forty di
visions with the sole aim of providing
relay and resistance. Therefore, just
as the offensive strength of the Ger
mans has been broken in the opinion
of the field marshals at Yser and the
trench warfare at Verdun the facilities
for maneuvering, that is to say, the
posibility. of transporting valuable re
serves from one front to another is
prevented at present by the continuity
and intensity of Anglo-French attack.
Germany has still strong powers of re
sistance which will for allied forces to
break. She is still capable of execut
ing very vigorous local offensives. But
her resources are diminishing at the
very moment when the military si cau
tion requires that they should Increase.
"That is the principal point
Allies' Full Strength.
"On the other hand British and
French armies have reached their full
streng:h in men and material and are
capable, with help of America of main
taining the enormous strength which
they have gained to the end of the war.
To this strength will be added the
great American army which will ar
rive as quickly as possible, as three
years of war has demonstrated the
value of time and the advantage of
each day gained.
"This shows the decisive character
attending the operations of 1918 when
the great democracies England, France
and America, will unite their entire
strength in attacking the enemy in con.
formity to the only sound principal of

head of that organization. As the
president of the progressive union he
still continued negotiations with that
portion of the Knights of Labor, Na

refused to go into the combination
creating the progressive union. These
negotiations resulted in the conven
tion of the two organizations in 1SS9,
when they were amalgamated under
the title of United Mine Workers of
America. He was second president
of that organization, a position he
held when he was elected president of
the American Federation of Labor for

"His heart was big, his sympathies
were wide; he had a broad experience
and because of these facts when
trouble arose in the state to which he
had moved from Ohio, and when these
troubles seemed to require the roedia

with a warm heart in his bosom, I se
lected Judge McBride for the work,"
said Secretary Wilson today.
Meeting Adjourned..
Out of respect to his memory, the
meeting of the commission was ad
journed today and all flags in the dis
trict were drouped to half-mast. Judge
McBride was .62 years old and is sur
vived by a widow and a son, the lat
ter secretary to Chief .Justice Cunning
ham of the state supreme court. Both
reside in Phoenix. The body will be
shipped to Wayne county, Ohio, for
burial.

STOCKHOLM, Oct. 8. In response
to the king's appeal for unity, the
leaders of all parties, conservatives,

plies that all agree to the absolute
necessity of the new government ob

regardless of consequences. The con

of maintaining commercial relations

The liberals and conservatives are
favorable to coalation ministery,

ferred to the National Guard, and
Camp Jackson, there will be formed
a national army divisions made up
of surplus white men drawn from
Camps. Sherman, Custer, Grant, .Tay
lor. Dodge, Funston and Travis.
Plan Different
"This plna. though somewhat dif
ferent from the one originally adopt
ed by the war department of forming
a complete national army division
composed exclusively of men from
each of the 16 national army areas.
is in full compliance with the spirit
of the law of May 18, because under
it each white national army division
still represents a distinct geograph
ical area, the one at Camp Jackson
being made up entirely from the
white men of the extreme southern
states, the one at Camp Gordon be
ing made up entirely from the surplus
white men of the extreme eastern
states, and the one at Camp Pie be
ing made up entirely from the sur
plus white men from the middle west
ern section. On the other band, the
colored division will be made up of
representatives from every part of the
nation and will be a truly national
division.
"Also under this plan it is possible
to fill each National Guard division
with men drawn from the same geo
graphical area from which the Na
tional Guard division is drawn."
New Division Added
The new plan adds a division to the
national army organization, making
17 divisoins in that force to supple
ment the 17 national guard divisions.
The negro division probably will be :
designated as the 92d division, na-1
tional army. It will be mobilised as j
a division only when ordered to
.France for duty. The force will be j
the largest fighting unit of negro
troops in the army, and the majority
of its officers will come from the ne
gro officers' training camp at Des
Moines, la.
The division will take in nearly 30.
000 of the 83.000 negroes registered
under the draft law. There will ba
organized in addition, however, serv- j
ice units for work behind the lines. !
Orders were published today author
izing 21 of these, to be raised by vol
untary transfer of drafted men or vol
untary enlistment from civil life. It
has been stated that 250.000 men i
must be sent abroad for this purpose.
Summary of Orders
Supplementing General Bliss' expla-1
nation, the department issued a sum
mary of orders governing the allot
ment of quotas of negro drafted men j
to the cantonments. With the excep- j
tion of Camps Jackson, Gordon, Pike
and Travis, each cantonment will ac
commodate all of the negro quotas
from the states from which its white
troops are drawn. Supplemental as
signments of colored contingents to
these camps have been made as fol
lows:
Supplemental Assignments

own quota supplemented by Porto

BY
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, md
at a reasonable cost for gas.

GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Oct. 9. Possibilities of
government action to curtail prices of
corn and bogs had a bearish effect
today on grain and provisions, espe
cially pork and lard. Corn closed un
settled, 1 to 1 net lower at
1.18 to 1.18 December, and 1.14
for May. Oats finished to to c
off. Latest quotations for pork, lard
ribs ranged from 12c to 1.75 down, as
compared with 24 hours before.
Downward swings of corn prices be
gan at the opening with interest cen
tered chiefly on the government crop
showing a yield much in excess of
what dealers had expected. Atten
tion later turned more and more to
gossip of a likelihood of federal ef
forts to bring about a lowered ratio
of values, approximately .corn $1 a
bushel and hogs $10 per 100 pounds.
Assertions that new peace offer woufll
be made by Germany counted also
against the bulls. A moderate recov
ery at the last was ascribed to profit
taking by shorts.
Seaboard demand prevented any
radical decline in oats. Announce
ments that the cotton oil seed market
had been closed to the public led to
considerable unloading of provisions,
and in the absence of any free buying
pork and lard broke severely, owing
to current talk of further drastic steps
toward more rigid food control.

NEW YORK. OcL 9. The market
was weaker all around. Liquidation
and speculative selling persisted and
overwhelmed rather substantial buy
ing particularly in Steel. Weakness
of the old Liberty bonds and the re
ports to the effect that subscriptions
to the new issue were not up to ex
pectations were depressing Influences.
In addition, the street is at sea and
does not know clearly how to analyze
the various peace rumors which are
circulated from time to time. A while
ago peace was considered by many as
bullish factor, but opinions now
vary greatly. It seems to be no long
er a matter of values in tne siock
market. As long as liquidation con-
tinuse to overshadow the investment
lnqnlry and the supporting orders.
the downward tendency will probably
be conspicuous. It has been said quite
freely of late that efforts would be
made by substantial interests to pro
mote a steady, if not buoyant .market.
but so far efforts in that direction
have apparently not met with much
success. LOGAN & BRYAN.

Staple Foods to
Be Under Control
(Continued From Page One)
conferences have been held at which
were planned regulations and construc
tive meihods of control.
"It has been the desire of the food
administration," the announcement
continued, "to secuie the co-operation
of all patriot !c men In the various
trades so as to eliminate speculation,
hoarding, unreasonable profits, waste
ful practices, etc.. In the great distribu
tion system of the country.
Licensing Provision.
"The licensing provision in the food
bill is limited In operation to the
channels of trading which lie between
the farmer, on the one hand and the
retailer on the other, except as it ex
tends to those few retailers who do an
annual business of more than $100,000.
Twenty Foods Liable.
"The food administration selected
about twenty basic commodities and
their products as forming the prime
basis of life and has limited its licens
ing control to these commodities, and
also, insofar as practicable, eliminated
the smallest units of business in these
staples.
"It is the purpose of the food admin
istration to effect conservation in the
commercial use of these commodities
and to keep them flowing toward the
consumer in direct lines through the
channels of tdae in as economical a
manner as possible. The administra
tion does not wish to disturb the. nor
mal and necessary activities of busi
ness and no business factor who is
performing a useful function will be
expected to surrender that function.
Several Duties.
"The administration is, however,
charged with several duties.
"The producers must have a free
outlet and a ready market
"There must be no monopolization
or speculation in fods.
"There must be no hoarding of fods.
"Unfair or unreasonable profits
must be eliminated.
"Discriminatory and deceptive and
wasteful practices which in any wiy
restrict supplies or distribution must
be stopped.
Provisions of Law.
"These are provisions of the food
food law. The licensing system
which was authorized by the law pro
vides a more effective machinery for
it a enforcement. It must not be
thought that these operations become

A letter was received yesterdaj
from one of the boys at Camp Funs
ton which states that they had now
been supplied with plenty of blankets'
and clothing and that the cold weath

also stated that they were now com
fortably settled in their new quarters
and that there would be no more mov
ing around for the present.

pleased with his place, desiring to Ih
out in the field, but like a good so!
dier, he was obeying orders.
Another Bisbee boy who went witl
the first contingent, L. J. Hall, ha
been promoted and made a sergeant
Hall, it will be remembered, was as
sociated with the New York Life In
surance company, and made his head
quarters at the local Y. M. C. A
The letter also stated that there wa?
a chance for other of the Bisbee boyt

"I am as well as could be expected
I took the physical examination yester
day anj passed O. K. We were inoeu
l?.ted for typhoid yesterday and I hav
been pretty sick from the effects. W
were also vaccinated the same day.
Lots of the boys fainted from the in
oculation. Lots of them were pretty
sick. Some would keel over while the j
dere drilling. Bennett Hammer faint
ed and we had to pick him up.
"This is a great camp. All we cai
see is soldiers and they have been
coming in ever since we have been
here.
We took our first hike this morning
It was about a four-mile hike. It sure
got a lot of the boys from the cities.
They could hardly stand it. Some
of them would say, 'We have a steady
jcb for a dollar a day,' hut if Uncle
Som would tell them they could go
home, they would leave In the morn
ing. ;
"I was amused at a Mexican in our
regiment He ent to our captain and
said he wanted his time as he didn't
like his job.
"They sure are drilling us. We
have to get up about 5 a. m. and we
get through about 6 p. m.
"There are about 200 soldiers here
at the Y. M. C. A. writing letters. We
have 1C of the Y. M. C. A.'s In
this camp. Have not been allowed to
leave the camp since we came.
"I saw Dorris Conger the other day.
He iy chauffeur for the headquarter?
or the 3l0tn r . A. We certainly have
a fine bunch of officers in our battery,
the best in the regiment.
"You don't know how one appre
ciates letters from home. I want you
glad totestify j
Says Watoga Lady. "As To YyTuI
Cardui Has Done For Me, io
As To Help Otiers."
Watoga, W. Va Mrs. S. W. Glad weft,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
ind my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and 1 began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... I gained, and was well
ina strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
f I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
jthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
tilments so common to women, why not
jive Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.
