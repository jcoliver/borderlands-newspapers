Present Cases, Re-opening j
Questions Thought Settled
(Hy Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 25 Officials
of the state department have begun a
study of the order of the government
of Mexico to punish foreign companies
and individuals for drilling wells or
doing other petroleum development
work without permission of the fed
eral government, it was learned auth
oritatively today. The order, which
was made public by the state depart
ment yesterday, re-opens the Mexican
oil question which was believed to
have been left to the Mexican courts
and the extra session of the Mexican
congress to decide without further
action either by the oil men or the
Mexican government. British and
French oil companies, as well as
American, are interested in the recent
deevlopments.

ing Acting Secretary of State Polk
during the absence of Secretary Lansing-
in Paris xTin f prrr-il tndflv with

companies position was laid Deiore

Trouble Is Old One.
The feature of the oil trouble in
volved in the circular order issued in
Mexico City last Saturday is said to
date back to January, 1915, when -Ca-arranza
was first chief and Vas beset
with enemies on every .side. At the
time he decreed that all development
work should stop immediately and that
no new work should be undertaken
without permission. Representatives
of the British, French and American
oil companies protested against this
order, but were assured by Carranza
government officials ana the diplomat
ic representative of the United States
in Vera Cruz that the sole purpose of
this decree was to exercise the proper
police power and to prevent unsafe
drilling and building operations. Upon
thi3 assurance the oil men of the
three countries agreed to seek per
mission for development work, al
though' it was pointed here today,
they had by this action bound them
selves to ask for licenses or permits
to do what they had a perfect right to
do without permits because of their
property rights.
' Refused Permits.
In 191", when the new constitution
wa.i put into effect, the Mexican gov
ernment began to refuse permits for
such work, according to authoritative

as such had no right to receive a
concession to develop oil. This was
the first effort made by the Mexican
government to establis hthe govern
ment ownership of all mineral deposits
as defined by the new constitution.
On the company's protest that this
ruling abridged its legal rights, the
Mexican government granted a pro
visional permit to complete the oper
ations in question.

AMENDMENT TO LEAGUE OF NATIONS PACT
IS AGREED ON BY AMERICAN DELEGATES
HUNGARIAN
Grave Apprehension Felt at
Paris and Washington as
Bolsheviki Move Growing
Attempt to Recover Part of
Austrian Adriatic Fleet Is
Now Believed Probable
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 25. Reports j
of an increasing seriousness of the j
situation in Hungary led to an opin-1
j ion expressed today by an official of j
I the state department that "the time '
had come for the allied nations repre-;
sented at Paris to take a definite and
firm stand against bolshevism." Lit-j
tie news of an official nature was re-j
ceived at the state department during
the day, but dispatches from Paris in
dicated that grave apprehension was
felt there as well as in Washington
over the situation.
Representatives of the United States
in Vienna reported that the food ad
ministration had one or two agents in
Budapest, and it was stated that there
might be other American there
These
advices said there was no ill feeling
,., -a-,-.- . .- ri ,
toward Americans or British in Buda-
. ,- v
nest, but a strong feeling of hostility
French. This, it is believed here, is
due to the occupation by French
troops of the neutral zones between
Czecho-Slovakia, Hungary and Ru
mania and Hungary. It is believed
here that pr0DaDiy prencn mem
bers of the intetf-aliiea mission in
Budapest have been interned as has
been reported in news dispatches from
Vienna, but doubt was expressed as to
the inclusion of Americans or British
in the internment order.
Adriatic Move Predicted.
It was said by officials that if the
Hungarians actually have declared
war upon the entente powers, as was
threatened in state department ad
vices made public yesterday, it would
be a natural move for the Hungarians
to attempt to reach the Adriatic and
recover a portion of the Austrian navy
now in the hands of the Jueo-Slavs.

age to he gained by striking imme
i diately toward the Adriatic before the
i authorities in Paris had time to act.
! The question as to whether Hun
gary's acceptance of bo'shevism had
i its inspiration from German Sources
is considered doubtful by state de-
Parmtent officials, although it was
. .
said it would be an experiment of
great interest to Germany as it would
at once put the allies to the test as
to their attitude toward bolshevism.
Peasantry on i-nce.
Advices to the department indicated
that the peasantry of Hungary thus
far had not accepted the new regime
to any great extent, but it was pointed
out that in no case has bolshevisnj
got its start by a general rising of the
proletariat. Rather it has been started
by a small clique of officials and grad
ually has spread and been instilled
into the minds of tn proletariat.
Such was the case in Russia, it was
said, and undoubtedly i3 the way in
which the "disease," as it was called
by one official today, may spread
throughout Hungary.
PARIS, March 23. (By the Asso
ciated Pre.ss.) The proclamation of
the Hungarian revolutionists dec-lares
that the action of the peace confer-
ence is one of the chief causes of j
unrest. Thus far the conference has
taken no specific, action regarding
Hungary, but the rHrommendations of
the commission cleariy forceshadow

Many Questions

Lloyd George and Clemenceau confer
red at the war office at 3 o'clock this
afternoon. The meeting lasted an hour
and a half.
There also was a meeting this morn
ins. The president and the premiers are
to meet daily to solve important ques
tions which will lead to a rapid conclu
sion of the peace treaty. In American
and British circles the belief is ex
pressed that these conferences will
have the desired result. Agreement
was reached today on most ot the
points surrounding reparation for war
damages, the amount of which the su
preme council will fix as the indem
nity Germany shall paj-.
It is expected that the conferees
probably will examine into the revolu
tion in Hungary and reports relating
to disorder in southeast Europe and
then will determine the problem em
braced in the Franco-German frontier,
w hich it is desired to bring to a quick
conclusion. Nevertheless important
drafting work will remain to be ac
complished after the settlement of tbe
principal questions.
The drafting of the articles of the
pact of the league of nations is pro
ceeding along parallel lines as the
amended pact will necessitate the
eloboration of a new text.

DOCTRINE IS
PROTECTED
Amendment Provides That
Agreements of Covenant
Shall Not Alter Old "Policy
Favorable Action on Change
Believed Certain, as Wilson
Conferred With Others
PARIS. March 25. (Iv the Asso
ciated Press.) The American peace
delegation, it is understood, has defi
nitely agreed" upon the amendment it
will offer to artkle X of the cove
nant of the League of Nations, to
safeguard the Monroe doctrine.
Tie amendment provides that agree
ments under the covenant shall not
be construe as an infringement upon
the principles of international policies
heretofore recognized.
President Wilson would have of
fered the amendment at the meeting
of the League of Nations commission
last night, but discovered a slight
imperfection in the text and reserved
the right to submit it later.
Appendix to Article.
As framed, the amendment will be
an appendix to the article ' pledging
members of the league to respect and
preserve against external aggression j
to . territorial integrity and existing:
political independence of members.
Mention of the Monroe doctrine by
name is avoided purposejy.
Ina'smuch as President Wilson and
Colonel House "on several occasions
have discussed the subject with Pre-1
miers Lloyd George. Clemenceau and!
Orlando, it is assumed that the presi-j.
dent assured himself of favorable ac-
lion in aavance or tne suDmission oi,
I
the amendment to the commission.
Other changes in the covenant made
at last night's meeting and which are,1
regarded by the American delegates
of great importance was calculated to;
tut--l jrM mil aiiu uojceiiuiis rma-1
natmg from America. They include
a substitute for the phrase
states
members of the league" in article X
and elsewhere in the covenant, thus
meeting objections that the latter
term created membership.
Revision Provided.
Provision also was made for the
revision of the covenant itself from
time to time, thus meeting the objec
tion that it is inflexible. The admis-
j sion of other states was provided for,
but it was agreed that any change in
numbers must be with due regard ot
the proportion between the represen
tation of the large and small powers
on the executive council as defined in
the articles creating the council.
Many changes in the text of the
covenant were made with the special
purpose of clarification and remov
ing ambiguities to which attention had
been called by speakers tn the United . DOth houses of the next legislature be
States. Some doubt is entertained in j fore it can be submitted to popular
some quarters as to the wisdom of J vote,
amendments affirming absolute con- j
trol of countries over their Internal)
affairs, as possibly prohibiting the
extension of outside aid to put down
revolutions and it is possible this'lan
guage may be further modified.
One amendment to be submitted
adopts a provision that powers which
are not specifically delegated to the
league are reserved to individual
members. Nothing has yet been done
to affirmatively state the right of a
nation with regard to its withdrawal
from the league, nor has the Japa'nese
amendment regarding racial discrimi
nations been reached. This latter,
however, has been modified so as sim
ply declare for the right of "Just"
treatment and is likely to be accept
ed. A French amendment providing for

"What Became of $5000 Paid
You?" One of Questions
Asked Attorney
(By Review Leased Wire)
DES MOINES, March 25 Georje
Clark, an Ida Grove attorney, testi
fied at the Iowa house judiciary com
mittee investigation of the Rathbun
pardon case late today that when he
received $5,000 from William Rathbun
for obtaining the pardon of his son.
Ernest, "nothing was said about what
he was to do with the money." I
Clark testified that after young
Rathbun's conviction for criminal as
sault and sentence to life imprison
ment ,the youth's father came to bim
and asked what could be done.
"I told them I would take care of
an appeal and try to get a pardon for
the boy," Clark continued. '"1 said
it would not "cost more than $5,000.
That was agreeable to them. I want
ed in payment $3,000 before I started
and at the expiration of six months
or so I would expect the other $2,000
.Nothing wa said -about what I was
to do with the money as that was not
a question in the case."
H. W. fivers'; special counsel for
the committee, asked if -there wasn't
some talk about you wanting the
money in currency," to which Clark
-replied:
"I didn't mention it. Uathbun's fa
ther told me be wanted to pay it in
cash so the banks wouudn't know
just how much it was costing him."
Clark was . questioned regarding
"certain parties" he participated in at
Ida Grove, which friends of the gov
ernor say explain what. became of pafrt
of the money collected' as' attorney
fees in the Rathbun case.
Harding to Be Called.
"Well, they were social, affairs, not
an exclusive gambling game," Clark
explained. ' "You see ,tue boys would
go hunting and return with some game
and the women would fix up the food
and we would have a little sociable
game afterwards."
In answer to questions. Clark
"guessed he didn't lose xny more mon
ey than the rest," and that his losses
during a certain week last October
were "no .quite so much"" as the
$1,000 Byers suggested, although he
could not remember the exact amount.
Thaddeus W. Sell, another" Ida
Grove attorney ,told the committee
that a check for $1,433.33, given by
Clark, was for professional services
not unrelated to the Rathbun case,
and a "personal debt" of $500, which
Clark admitted was one of the "social
debts" resulting from the "parties."
The testimony of Snell concerned
mainly a meeting and conversation
he had with Governor Harding in
Chicago two days before the pardon
was granted last November, but dur
ing their conversation, Snell testified,
only sacual mention was made of the
Rathbun case. Snell is to testify fur
ther tomorrow.
Governor Harding, it was said to
night, probably will be called as a
witness tomorrow.

Mrs. Catt's Proposal for Or

Adopted

ST. LOC1S, March 25. A league of
women voters is to be organized by
the National American Woman Suf
frage association, delegates to the
jubiless convention in session here
having voted unanimously late this
afternoon to adopt the recommenda
tion of the executive council that the
organization be formed. Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt, president, proposed
the league in her address Monday
night as fitting memorial to the pio
neer workers on suffrage.
That the league is to be non-partisan
is assured by the adoption of an
other recommendation which embod
ied a resolution defining non-partisanship,
and in which it was stated that
the national association "shall not af
filiate with any political party nor en
dorse the platform of any party nor
support or oppose any national can
didates until such action shall be rec
ommended by the board of directors."
The resolution, however, does not
limit the liberty of action of any mem
ber of officer of the association, to
join or serve the party of her choice
in any capacity as an individual.

association "continue to support and
endorse the federal amendment which

LEAGUE'S OPPONENTS FLAYED
FORT WAYNE, ind, March 25. It
Is cowardly for anyone to criticize the
League of Nations and the work of
the peace conference when they have
nothing to offer as a substitute, de
clared Rabbi Stephen. S- Wice, in an
address here tonight. Continuing, he
said: : p
"President Wilson is the foremost!
man in the world. He did not draw t
up the League of Nations, but he is at- j
temuting to put it through for thej
future peace and happiness of' the,
world. The people of Europe are in
accord with him and they cannot un
derstand why his own people in Amer
ica oppose him. Those who do so
are actuated for the most part by j
politics and I am sorry to know thatj
politics has crept into this great
American and world question."

Baltimore FecTeral League'
Club's Suit Declares
Monopoly Exists
I
T!v Review I ."a "Wire)
WASHIXUTOX, March 25. Profes
sional baseball as organized since
1903 was attacked as an absolute mon
opoly and a violation of the Sherman
anti trust act by counsel for the Balti
more Federal League club in begin
ning the club's suit for ?&uO,UOO dam
ages against National and American
lea.srue clubs and certain officials of
the defunct Federal league. The. case
, is being heard by a jury in the su
preme court of the District of Colum
bia. "Combinations among the various
leagues and clubs described as organ
ized baseball," asserted William L.
Marbury, attorney for the prosecution,
"is and has been since 1903 an abso
lute and complete monopoly and the
maintenance thereof is ia violation of
the Sherman anti-trust law. Conduct
of organized baseball under regula
tions of the national commission con
stitute a monopolization of trade ana
commerce in ba'sebalL"
Betrayal Charged
Mr? Marbury contended that after in
vesting -more than 200,000 in equip
ment, the stockholders of the club
"had been betrayed" by three officials
of the former Federal league. These
officials he named as James A. Gil
more, president of the Federal league;
Charles M. Weeghman, president of
the Chicago Federal league club, and
Harry Sinclair, president of the
league's Newark club, all of whom are
defendants in the case.
Although officials of the Baltimore
club were present atThe meeting in
Cincinnati in December ,1915, when
the "peace pact? with the National
and American leagues was signed, Mr.
Marbury contended that the agree
ment entered into was not sanctioned
by the Baltimore club representatives.
He also charged that in the final set
tlement, all of the Federal league
clubs received more favorable con
sideration from ne old league than
the Baltimore club did.
$3CO,C0O Total Loss
The total amount lost by the Balti
more club, he said, was about $300,000
and the suit for $900,000 was brought
on the grounds that triple damages
could be claimed for violation of the
Sherman anti-trust act.
The only witness appearing today
was L. Edwin Goidman, a director of j
the Baltimore club. He was on the
stand only a short time and will re
same hi3 testimony tomorrow.
Baseball officials present at the
trial today included Ban Johnson,
president of the American league;
John A. Heydler, president of the Na
tional league, and August Herrmann,
chairman of the national commission.
Court officials tonight said that the
trial probably would continue at least
two weeks and possibly a month.

Perfect Feet Taken as Sign of Aristocracy in Europe; Shoes

First of all, buy shoes that fit.
Of all the ills that women en

vanity, tight shoes are the worst.
No woman ought to know that
she has feet. If her shoes fits, sue
will not know it.
Narrow Shoes Harmful
They must be neither, too short,
nor too tight. The very narrow
sole is as harmful as the too
pointed toe. The feet must be able
to "breathe." The sole of the siioe
should be broad enough and the
heel broad enough and not too
high. The object is to have the
toes straight and shapely as na

on both sides were choked with hu

seats were filled with wounded sol-.

ofiicials, governors of this and other
states, members of the legislature,
mayors and official delegations from
upstate cities.
Just below the Arch of Victory
which spans the avenue at Madison

Where the Alen Fail
As a reminder to the men of Phoenix, the Arizona Gazette, of Phoenix,
prints a call to the assistance cf the Y. W. C. A. The call is timely.
While it may not apply locally in all its phases, the grounds set forth in
behalf of the Y. W. C. A. work decs touch local conditions. In fact, we
doubt if Phoenix has in the entire year the one-half girls problems of
this district handled through respective Y. W. C. A. organizations. The
Gazette says:
"America's womanhood is the standard of irs citizenship. The
latter attain no higher in honor, rectitude, differentiation between right
and wrong, sympathy and tolerance, sunshine, than itB women, its
mothers and sweethearts, life it to. No man can fail of aiding" tne
opportunities of women for bettering the condition of their sex, lead
ing Its' Sternberg into the right paths, without failing himself and more,
failinghis mother and his sisters. ,
"Men are few, if any, too, who do not owe help to all women because
of some careless deed or word, in the lightest of the list of offenses,
that has made the path or some woman harder in the world.
"The Y. W. C. A. is acknowledged as a harbor lor women and girls,
an institution through which hundreds of thousands have been gently
assisted and set firmly upon right paths, turbulent characters molded
to ways of gentleness and good purpose, , heedless eyes opened
to the pitfalls and miseries of caieless ways, weak hands' lifted up and
made strong by contact with wcrk suitable to them. V.
"The organization is in no way experimental. It long since passed
that phase. It moves systematically, with coordination throughout
the country- Its growth, inueed. is in itself all sufficient proof of its
worth and usefulness. Above other organizations dealing with wo
men it is fitted to do the most and do it best. . -
"Here in Phoenix the association is asking a comparatively small
amount for its year's work. During the week it has received the
public recommendations and subscriptions of Vice-President Marshall
and former Secretary of the Treasury "William G. McAdoo. Women
cf Phoenix have come spienuidly forward with contributions and work
within their means. Men have failed of grasping the spirit with quite as
much enthusiasm as they owe. It is to them that final recourse falls.
H.YOU have not subscribed be quite sure you send in your check today.
It re not a work Phoenix can afford to falter in."
Replace Uncertainty With Confidence
If you want to stimulate business inject confidence into the buying
public. Do it not only once but keep It 'going, and to do this every com
munity has the right tonic if applied.
Never in the history of America was there more need of applying the
remedy than right now, and each locality has the remedy. While there
is hovering over a community the dread of hard times, and uncertainty as
to what the future holds in store, the average housewife as well as the
head of the family, plans curtailment.. If the great industries that go to
make up the industrial world, would act jointly and publicly declare that
during the ensuing twelve months wages would not be cut, you would find
a helthy response from the buying public. Confidence would be instilled,
and that is the greatest factor to bridge over a period of uncertainty.
Business is good, and if the whole United States from Maine to Cali
fornia, and from Canda to Mexico would issue a statement that wages
were not to be cut, it would replace uncertainty with confidence, and this
country we dare say would enter upon an era of prosperity unequalled
even during war times.
Let a man think he is ill, because he has some little ache or pain
and if he broods over it long enough he will be a mighty sick man. Not
only does it effect him, but the family circle as well. Let the menufac
turer assure labor that wages will not be cut during the coming twelve
months and we venture to say that instead of an atmosphere of uncer
tainty we will have confidence, the real asset as a business getter and a
business builder.
Discontent
Here's a fairy tale for grown folks. Once upon a time a son was
born to the king and queen of a powerful country. All the good fairies
came to the christening to bestow some quality upon the little prince.
Finally there came a fairy who wished to endow the future ruler
with "'discontent.'' This made the king very angry and he had her ban
ished from the palce.
The young prince grew Into manhood a promising ruler. But upon,
ascension to the throne, his country began to lag behind. A search for
the reason showed that the cause lay in the absolute satisfaction of the
young ruler with present methods and ways of doing things. He never
reached out for improvements because things suited him as they were.
The good fairy banished from the palace by the father took with her
the son's greatest asset discontent.
Dissatisfaction is the greatest trait one can possess provided it is
directed into constructive improvements. A man .will stay young and
active just so long as he is never enftrely content with his place in life,
and strives through honest, honorable means to better it.

Y
Loans
to Firms Being Prepared
by War Board
(By Review Ieasefl Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 25 The
government's billion dollar fund for
financing foreign trade soon will be
opened to American exporters through
loans from the war finance corpora
tion. Regulations now being prepared
by the corporation to cover advances
will provide for the lending of sums
up to $50,000,000 to any individual
firm, corporation or export associa
tion, probably at 5 per cent for a
maximum of five years, on adequate
collarteral.
Reports indicate that exporters are
planning to make extensive use of the
government's foreign trade fund as
soon as the regulations are complet
ed and the corporation is ready to
accept formal applications.
This is caused by taree principal!
influences.
First European countries which
will need great quantities of American
materials during the next year or two
for reconstruction and to make up for
lack of constructive nterprises in the
war, have neither the gold nor the
credits to pay for their purchases in
this country and their inability will
be increased when at the end of the
war the United States government
stops making loans to the allies.

I feel that it would be helping out

me," said Rev. A. J. Vallory, living at
821 Chelsea avenue, Memphis, Tenn.
"About three years ago," he contin
ued, "I had a general breakdown that
made me very nervous. I had a sour
stomach and would s"pit up undigested
food. The pains in my stomach hurt
so at times that I thought they would
kill me. I also suffered with rheum
atic pains in my joints and my kidneys
were in bad shape, my sleep was poor
and I felt so tired all the time that 1
could not do my work.
'"Since taking Tanlac I have been re
lieved of indigestion and those pains
aro all gone. My kidneys don't trcuhle
nie any, I am not nerxous like 1 was
and I can sleep fine every night. My
strength ' and energy have been re

Introducing "Biz" B. Phan, "Just! an Ol Fogey Who's

In the future no local shipments of
household furniture can be shipped
to Ranger, Texas, -without first obtain
ing permission from the chairman of
the Chamber of Commerce at Ranger.
This move was decided on by that
body on account of the enormous num
ber of men with families going to
Ranger in the hope that it will prove
to be their eldorado. As it is, thert,
are many without houses at Ranger
and still people who hae no concep
tion of the conditions continue to pour
in.
The local freight agent said yester
day that no less than 25 shipments of
furniture were shipped to Ranger from
Bisbee. He said the action taken by
the Ranger Chamber of Commerce is
to let the public know the conditions
before they incur the expense of mov
ing to Ranger only to find it over
crowded. Men returning from Ranger say that
exceptionally high prices are being
paid every night for tents and living
and other conditions are abnormal be
cause of the present oil boom.

KANSAS CITY, Mo.. March 23.
Amendments to the proposed constitu
tion of the leasue of nations put for
ward in Paris during the last twenty
Jour hours vindicate critics of the
present draft of the covenant. United
State sSenator Ja'nes A. Heed of yiU
couri declared in an address here, to
night. .
"If the framters of the covenant now
stand confessing that they overlooked
two preat principles, then all the reft
of the work surely needs investiga
tion," he asserted.
"The papers slate- that article 10,
which bids us to protect the frontiers
cf Japan, Great Britain and every"
other member of the league, is to be
amended so that it will not constitute
'an infringement upon the principles
of international policies heretofore
recosnized.' The attempt of the!
American delegate Vo incorporate!
such an amen.inn h-is their solemn
confession that ct itics are right
and that artk-fe'fcu ia a dangerous
abandonment of our nationa lsover- i
egnity. It is also stated that the i
delegate saer fighting hard to amend
the covenant so as to save the Mon
roe doctrine.
'If the critics have saved these car
dinal doctrines," Senator Reed de
clared, "then they are entitled to the
thanks of the world."
"They tell us the league will prevent
wars. Yet ,as I stand here speaking,
the chain of new republics we are
about to set up are cutting each oth
er throats."
Senator Reed's address was heard
by a large audience and the speaker
was frequently interrupted by ap
plause. Quoting from addresses by President
Wilson in 1914 and 131t in which, the
president expressed the belief that
America should hold aloof from Eu
ropean altercations, Senator Reed re
iterated his opposition to the proposed
league of nations, and, declared that
"once the American people understand
what is involved in the league as now
proposed, they will reject it almo&t
unanimously."
Senator Reed used the president's
words, he said, to show tha tthe doc
trine of Washington is not old and
should not be discarded.
"This is not a political question,"
he. declared." "It jrrows directly out
"? tLe war. The war was not political.
A proposition which involves the sov
ereignty of the United States, the in
tegrity of the Monroe doctrine, the
violation of tbe constitution, and the
life o ft'--? republic is not political, it
is national."

was what the allies were going to de
mand. But had the Germans agreed
to it, was there any chance of their
'agreeing to it, if the allies divested
themselves of all their forces at the
presentation?
"The government," said the secre
try, "have to face the real facts. If we
squandered our forces at the present
, time before our terms are secured,
with European conditions of great
gravity and perplexity, then we should
throw away with both hands all the
results gained by the sacrifices cf mil
lions of our men during four years."
The liberal opposition had proposed
a series of amendments to the military
service bill which Mr. Churchill de
clared were intended to wreck the bin.
There was no truth in the accusation
that the government had not tried the
voluntary system. The government
had tried and would try every means
under the voluntary system.
Objection was taken to men being
invited to re-enlist for as long as two,
three or four years. But unless men
were secured for these periods it
would be impossible to relieve territor
ial and other troops in India and else
where who ought to have effective re
lief, lie thoroughly agreed that the
government must "do everything pos
sible to recreate a voluntary army at
the earliest possible moment.

rounding -what remains of the old ter
ritory. Official Explains.
This, while not yet approached by
the conference, doubtless reached the
Hungarian leaders and gave impetus
to the overthrow of the Karolyi gov-
, ernment. One of the officials who is
taking a chief part. in the readjust
ment of territory in that quarter of
Europe has explained the situation as
follows:
"Bohemia has been detached from
the northwest of old Hungary. The
adjoining country of the Slovaks has
also been detached. The Bohemians
are Czechs, and, with the Slovaks,
form the new Czecho-Slovak nation,
both parts being detached from Hun
gary. The Ruthenians form the wedge
netx to the Slovaks, and this territory
has also been taken from Hungary.
"Next to the Ruthenians comes
Transylvania which likewise has been
detched from old Hungary and given
to "Rumania. Next to Transylvania
come3 the Banat region, which has
been detached from Austria and given
to Rumania nearly to the Temes river,
the remainder of Banat going to Ser
bia. ,
New Jungo-Slav Stat.
"Further west, the new Jugo slav
state takes in that part of Hungary
up to the River Drav. These changes
lorm an almost complete circle, leav
ing new Hungary only a compact cen
ter occupying the rich Danubian
plain."
All the foregoing recommendations,
it is pointed out, were justified by the
principle of nationality and self-determination
as enunciated by Tresident
Wilson, Bohemians, Slovaks, Ruthen
ians ond Transylvanians, as well as
the inhabitants of Banat, are racially
Slavic or Rumanian and have no eth
nological connection with the Hunga
Ians and Transylvanians. as well as
surrounding territory only through
the powerful political influence of the
Hungarian Maevars.

Company Contests Law.
One America ncompany immediately
began a contest of the constitutional
ity of the law by a suit of "amparo"
brought when the company was re
fused permission to drili an oil well.
The Mexican government, in this suit,
gave as one reason for refusing the
permit that the company was a for
eign, corporation and as such could
receive no "concession" to develop
petroleum in Mexico. The point made
by the three governments interested
has been consistently that the com
panies did not tieed permits to operate
because tbey had acquired their lands
in good faith by purchase or lease in
accordance with the existing laws of
Mexico.
Whether any action will be taken
by this government in the present
case has not yet been desided, it was
said today, but tbe feeling prevails in
official circles that this order of the
departmen of industry in Mexico City
is a means of forcing the companies
to accept the confiscatory features of
decrees which have been the subject
of protests by this country, Great Bri

Turkish Reservists
LOXDOX, March 1. (Corres
pondence of the Associated Press)
Information received here from
Datum indicates that, despite the
surrender of the Turkish forces,
the position of ine Greeks south
of the Black sea and in the Cau
casus is tragic.
It is alleged that outrages are
being committed by the demobil
ized but still armed Turkish re
servists and that the Young Turk
commander. Gen. Halid Tasha, has
been puresuing a policy of system
atic extermination of Christians.
This officer, who is a friend of
Enver Pasha, is said to be supply
ing arms to Turkish irregulars in
the Russian territories evacuated
by the Turkish army. Lately he
received from Turkish sources 200
carloads of amis and munitions.
It is charged that these reserv-
ists and irregulars loot and mas
sacre the Greek population.
The flourishing Greek town of
Sanda, near Trebizond. with a
population of about SOuO is report
ed besieged by Turkish reserv
ists. The Greeks, profiting by the
naturally strong positions of the
town, are offering heroic resist
ance. AMERICAN APPETITES

American breakfast upset all calcula
tions in the French hotel accustomed
to supplying guests with rolls and
coffee as an early morning meal. Wild
calls for ham and eggs, beefsteaks,
chops, oatmeal nd hot cakes surprised
the French cocks, who, after weeks
of catering to the hungry Americans,
have net become reconciled to the
American breakfast menu.
The American fondness for hors
d'eeuvres also caused consternation, j
Great dishes of beet pickle, potato

Venizelos' approach is always her- j

The Cretans who escort the Greek
statesman are all more than six feet !

Perhaps the most startling uniform I

of white tights bound by tsssclle I i
