L BILL IS
Chairman Sims, of Interstate
Commerce Committee, De
clares President Is Respon
sible to Owners.
(By Review Leased "Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 9. In report
ing the administration railroad bill to
the Jiouse today. Chairman Sims said
the house interstate commerce com
mittee had amended the measure so
as to Test final rate making authority
in the president because under the
present law the interstate commerce
commission could not make such
necessary changes in rates as unified
was control detnandB. To amend the
statutes so as to provide a non-competitive
rate making sy?tem. the re
port said, would .be putting on con
gress an -impossible burden."
The bill as amended gives shippers
an dccnsignees all the protection that
they now have, the report continued,
as tiie interstate commerce commis
sion upon their complaint shall hold
hearings to discuss fully the justice,
reasonableness and fairness of any
rate in the light of war conditions.
After these hearings the commission
will report its conclusions to the pres
idents icr such action as he may deem
necessary "in public interests."
President Responsible.
To allow the interstate commerce
commission to over-ride the president
in the exercise of war powers, orof'
any powers for that matter, would be
most "tin seemly," the repot said.
"It should not be overlooked," it
added, "that the president is respon
sible for the financial results of the
operation of the government carrier
systems with gross revenues approxi
mating 14,000,000,000. The president
must be given powers commensurate
with Ms responsibility. The bill,
therefore leaves rates and rate mak
ing undisturbed, except as the presi
dent otherwise orders."
Is Emergency Legislation.
The report discussed each Bertion
of the measure and pointed out that
it was distinctly war emergency leg
islation intended to meet the essential
needs growing out of federal control
and that it should not be regarded as
a bill either for ownership or contro'
of railroads.
The main purpose of the measure,
the report said, are to provide a
method of just compensation, "as
probably will result in an agreement
between the roads and the govern
ment determinative of all rights." and
to confer authority for financing dur
federal control.
Before filing the report. Chairman
Sims submitted it to Interstate Com
merce Commissioner Anderson, who
as the representative of Director Gen
eral McAdoo. gave It his approval.
Chairman Sims plans to bring up
the bill in the house Monday and
hopes to secure prompt consideration
A similar plan has been determined
npoa by Chairman Smith of the sen
ate interstate commerce committee,
in respect to the draft of the bill re
cently reported to the senate.

Naval Consulting Beard De-!
dares Honeycombed Air
tight Cells Solve Problem.
(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Feb. 9. Means
have been found to make trans
ports unsinkable by submarine,
according to a statement made to
night by William ( Saunders,
vice chairman of the naval con
sulting board in an add res sat a
dinner of the University of Penn
sylvania alumni in this city.
Mr. Saunders said one of the
'hips recently commandeered by
( the government "now lies at an
Atlantic port and in such shape
that she cannot be sunk by an ex
ploding torpedo."
"I can conceive of no reason
why this information should be
withheld," he added. "On the con
trary, I believe it is well that the
enemy may come to realize that
the time has been reached when
American transports are ready
for transportation of our troops
which that enemy cannot sink.
This ship may have a hole thirty
or forty feet in diameter blown in
here side, and &he will - remain
afloat. Such a hole would water
log but one-tenth of the honey-
combed airtight cells." j
Mr. Saunders described in detail the i
plan to keep ships afloat after they '
had -been torpedoed, and the manner
in which it had been developed by
William S. Donnelly, a New York mar- j
ine engineer, working under authorira-!
tion of the naval consulting board. j
"Af ro a It will fata .nnii) tlmo in I
equip similarly the large number of
transports we have, continued
Mr. '
Saunders. "It is my belief, however,
that nothing will be left undone by the
administration to safeguard the lives
of large troop contingents to be moved
across the Atlantic"
Mr. Saunders, in a statement credit
ed to him last May, asserted that a so
lution of the submarine problem had
probably been found by the board and
in the opinion of the board members
the scheme as approved would put an
end to the submarine menace.
He did not ented into details. Oth-
er members of the board, including :
Thomas Robins, its secretary nd I
rraiK j. aprague. a memoer oi iu
committee on submarines took issue
with Mr. Saunders that the solution of
the U-boat menace had been reached.

It was foresight and straight information from the
largest manufacturers that made us purchase our spring
stock early last year; it wasn't a luck buy, or a small lot
bought cheap. We KNEW that prevailing conditions
would send market prices sky-high, and it did. We knew
that the ladies of the Warren District were depending on
us to supply their coming wants at prices they were used
to paying and so we left no stone unturned to get nothing
but the finest and most up-to-date of 1918 fashion's new
creation at 1917 prices.

These are the prettiest little dresses that you would

over-skirts of Georgette Crepe, some silks in the new
shades of the season, trimmed with hand embroidery and
beads, with such charming collars that just fit the styles
of each little dress so well. There are serges, too, that al
ways wear so well and look so fresh; in all sizes $16.50

Views of the War
Are Conflicting
This editor sat up most of last night with newspapers,
magazines and maps piled high around him trying to
find out something about the war. He read the views
of military experts and special correspondents and wise
professors and learned historians from all the allied na
tions fighting Germany end he pondered deeply over
"their information and deductions. He studied the maps
and considered the prophecies and weighed the fears
of the printed page. He turned back into the history
of other wars for contrast and comparison. And the
further he went into the matter the more muddled and
mixed and doubtful became his state. Long past mid
night this tired editor summed up his findings and he
presents them herewith to his readers with all frank
ness for just what they are worth:
Wilson has a weak cabinet excepting McAdoo and
Lane.
America has accomplished wonders since entering the
war, and Baker is a good man and his critics are too
harsh.
It is a losing war of attrition. The allies are killing
or disabling Germans at the rate of 700.000 a year and
500.000 young men are available every year to take their
places. Hence enly 200.000 a year Is the total German
losses and it will take twenty years to win.
It is a winning war of attrition. The allies are kil
ling and disabling Germans at the rate of more than a
million a year and they cannot make up these losses
except from the new clasf.es coming on each year. Two
years more will witness the sure collapse of the pre
sent German battle line in the west.
Germany is starving.
Germany has food supplies that will last only until
April 1 of this year.
Germany has enough ictual food necessities to see her
through the war.
Italy Is starving.
Italy has plenty of food but needs coal and munitions.
Torpedoes for the submarines are scarce.
It is almost impossible to secure crews for the sub
marines. The submarine war on transports will be redoubled.
The Bolsheviki outfit is a joke and will soon collapse.
The Bolsheviki will become a world menace.
The airplane program is far behind.
The airplane program is being speeded up and will
win the war.
Our failure to build ships and make cannon fast enough
is caubing great worry and depression in allied capitals.
The allies look to American ships and engineers and
fighters and food to turn the scale nexl summer. The
allies have plenty of artillery and will furnish guns.
Strikes and industrial unrest are seething In Germany
and thryten to put Austria entirely out of the war.
Germany has put down all strikes wttn an iron hand.
Austria will send troops to "the western front
Lloyd-George says England win fight to a, finish.
Clemenceau says France will fight to a finish.
And there you are. It is a muddle and a contradic
tion down to the last three lines. They save the day.
They will win the war.
Sunday Morning Sermon
"In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's
hand, and wrote over against the candlesticks upon
the plaster of the wall of the king's palace; and
the king saw part of the hand that wro:e." Daniel
5-5.
No repast since Esau sold his birthright for a mess of
pottage has been so celebrated in picture, song and
story as the feast of Belbhazzar. where the hand wrot
upon the wall and Daniel came and read the king's doom
from the writing thereon. The ancient kingdom of
Babylon was then at the zenith of its wealth and power
and glory, and Belshazzar, the great king, had drawn
upon the entire resources of his kingdom for a feast
that must have surpassed all entertainment of its kind
for rich sumptuousness and splendor that the world has
known before or since that night. His marble halls were
ablaze with lights and a thousand slaves played upon
the sackbut and the zi'.her and served him and his
nobles from vessels of gold. Here was power unsurpas
red and beauty unrivaled and revelry at its heieht.
when a hand appeared and wrote upon the wall.
Then did the wine flush upon this imperious king's
Lace change to ashen gray and his fat hands clenched the
carvings of his throne and terror and consternation shone
in the eye that glared at these strange characters npon
his palace wall. The instruments of the slaves became
dumb and the nobles shrank tremblingly rrom that gilded
board. Never so great a feast; never so great a doom.
And they sent for Daniel, the wise Hebrew prophet
who had Interpreted the dreams and read the riddles that
had haunted Nebuchadnezzar, father of the present king.
And Daniel came, pale and austere in his simple mantle
of white and frowned upon those godless revelers and
with Inspired glance read the mystic writing upon the
walL That kingdom's days were numbered; that king
had been weighed and found wanting and his kingdom
was to be divided between the Mede and the Persian
who were even then at Babylon's gates.
And Belshazzar's feasts, upon a smaller scale and in
a simpler way, are common with most of us to this day.
We gain or have given to us wealth or places of power
and forthwith we forget our old simple standards and
the humbleness and modesty and good fortune and the
blessing of hard work that brought us these things' and
gained for us these friends, and proceed, like Belshazzy,
to set a sumptuous feast, and. like this same Babylonian
king, we send for the cups of gold from the Hebrew
temple, which is to say, we mock our past, are heedless
of the future and live only for the present. Then comes
a hand and writes upon the wall and our palace of pride
falls about our ears and we are sore arraid.
The trouble with us is, we 'seem to think we shall live
for a thousand years, when in fact, like Belshazzar, our
days are numbered. We think we are fine and perfect,
when we have already been weighed in the balances and
found wanting. We think our little reign or sway or
place is secure, when it has, in fact, been divided among
those who are to succeed us.
Belshazzar was not destroyed just because he was a
king, or rich, or powerful, or gay. It was His overwhelm
ing arrogance that marked him. and it was his mockery
of God's holy vessels from the temples that brought the
hand that split the walls of his palace and traced trie
fateful characters upon his walls. The s:mple, kindly,
reverent, merciful heart can be happier still with wealth
at its command and fame to make its light shine bright
er before the world.
To be a king we do not need to be a Belshazzar. We

before his friends and intimates and escape the hand
that writes his doom upon the wall.
Belshazzar's feast! For many thounds of years it
has stood high before us in painted glory and stirring
verse and swelling song and fascinating story as the acme
of earthly pleasure or earthly folly, depending upon with
what eyes we looked to see. With riches comes the de
sire to give one; with power comes the ambition to
emulate this old Babylonian king; with pride comes the
temptation to repeat bis boasts and mimic his mock
eries. Belshazzar feast3 have snared many young feet
and turned many old heads. We seem to be able to seo
only the glitter of the king's banquet hall and are blind
to the true and enduring greatness of the modest, simple,
steadfast Daniel, who is really the great and shining
figure of that banquet hall, and notthe king.
In the same hour came forth the fingers of a hand and
wrote upon the wall. It came in the hour of greatest
joy and pride. Came without warning, and nothing could
stay it until the writing was done. Days numbered;
weighed and found wanting; kingdom divided and given
away. Ah. that hand! From heaven it came. The words

DREAMS.
"One dreams of a hearth and a home to be ;
One sees but a golden store ;
Tiile the burdened toiler dreams of rest
When toil shall be no more."
Another dreams of the dance under lights
In the arms of a lover true;
One for social fame and power fights
Leaving love to me and you.
Then others dream of a world of peace;
One of wisdom, delving in lore;
Those who have suffered, that suffering will cease
And heart aches be no more.
"So, ever it is, in some sweet guise.
Hope hangeth the lantern high ; .
Oh, the DREAMS ahead are the golden stars
That help us to live or die."

THE WAIL OF THE BOOTLEGGER.
By Ned White of Bisbee.
We started for Rodeo
Along about two-thirty
One frosty winter morning:
With a load of booze we started.
With a load of good red liquor
For the thirsty ones in. Bisbee,
For the thirsty population
In the canyons of Mule Mountains.
As we sped along the highway
We watched for Percy Bowden
A terror to bootleggers!
Is that the Bowden person
In his car the Yellow Devil?
Oftentimes bootleggers meet him
On the highways and the byways.
Oftentimes the crafty Percy
Lies in wait in lonesome places.
As we sped along that morning.
Feeling lucky and elated,
(We had passed the danger point
And our fears had most abated;)
When bang! We ran righ: into something.
And the flivver groaned and halted.
There he stood beside the roadway,
Happy as a goat in clover.
For he knew the goods were on us.
And we knew the game was over.
With a grin he up and told us
How our little game was blasted
By the putty-faced stool-pigeon
Who gave us our bum steer;
(For he said the road was open
To the line of Arizona.
And from there on down to Douglas
Everything was clear.)
So beware of Percy Bowden!
. All you hop-heads ard bootleggers;
Soon or late he's going to ct you
His plans are all well "laid;
There will be a trip to Tombstone,
A little hard-luck story.
And a little six-month sentence
To work out on the grade.

j J. C. Henderson Reminded of Epidemic of Fifteen Years
Ago in Bisbee When the Drunkard Stayed on the
Job it Pest House and Mexican Nurse Fled
Humor and pathos somehow go hand
in hand, and where there is suffering
and hrad?hips there, too. will be found,
purple passages to lighten the burden
of the unfortunates or to bring a smile
to lips that have been tight drawn and
lessen the burden of some one's cross, j
James R. Henderson recites a story
of the smallpox scare of fifteen years
ago in Bisbee which carries with it a1
touch of humor which misht weil be
retold at this time, when' Pisbee is
again feeling the weighty hand of a
smallpox scare clamped upon her
business life.
"Smallpox was not as weil known
by the doctors fifteen years aco." says
Mr. Henderson. "The disease had
not been the subject of such a thor
ough study as in later years, and. too.!
the city was smaller and did not boast
of such highly competent members of
the medical profession as Drs. Hunt.
Brown, Shine and the other doctoral
lights of today."
In those days the disease was feared
more than today, and in. fact it was
more dangerous, because effective
means of stamping it out were not so
well known. Also it was a difficult
matter to secure nurses to care for
those attacked by the disease. Women
nurses were practically unheard of
in Bisbee fifteen years ago. for wom
en were srHre here then.
Therefore, when the disease broke
out and patients were being taken to
the pest house daily, the only nurse
who would stay on the job was the
town drunkard. Mexicans had been
tried, but always their fear of small
pox got the best of them and they
quit. So as a last resort the pleas c?
the town drunkard, that he be per
mitted to minister to the wants and
needs ot the sick, were taken serious
ly and he went on the job.
In those days it was the general
belief that liberal use of whisky, in
ternally, was the best possible means
of combatting the disease, and this of
course was what caused the town
drunkard to apply for the nursing job.
since it is a well-known fact that what
is good for the patient must be good
for the nurse. Then, too, the town
drunkard was down on his luck and
whisky had become hard to get. so he
smothered his fear of smallpox in his
craving for whisky and became fhe
pest house nurse.
All went well for a time at t'ie pest
house, then located down the valley
at a point near the present site of the
town ci Warren, for the town drunk
ard had all the whisky he could stow
away and was happy, and being a
man of appreciation, he cared for the
Mek as well as might be expected,
while he treated the patients liberally
with whisky, since the supply fur
nished the pest house was plentiful.
Then, one night a new patient was
discovered up one of the canyons, and
the town drunkard came up fro.n the
pest house to drive the sick man
down there in a rig. Also he came up
to renew the supply of whisky at the
hospital, as was his custom every
few days.
Th? patient was secured and placeJ

-That the American neni re i
equally prepared to make every effort
to bring about this result is the surest
guarantee that the cause is just and
the aim is righteous," the statement
concluded.
The party was met here by a num
ber of British consular, military and
naval officials. The statement issued
, by Earl Reading follows:
Offers Sympathy
"My first thought upon arrival is ot
the loss of life on the Tuscania, report
ed to us whilst we were at sea. May
I pay my very respectful tribute ot
honor to the gallant men who have
made the supreme sacrifice for their
country's sake and express my pro
found sympathy with their relatives.
"I am indeed glad to find myself
once again, and for tbe third time
. since the beginning ot the war, in Am
erica. It is barely three months ago
since I sailed for England and I return
this time charged with many and va-
1 ried duties, which I should scarcely
have had the courage to undertake
had I not known from past experience
that my government could implicitly
rely npon the cordial good will of the
American people and their complete
co-operation with tbe allies in all the
, measures necessary for th vigorous
prosecution oi the war.
"I am sure you will fully understand
that I cannot make any statement in
; my official capacity until I have been
I received by your president. Moreover.
I I am not yet acquainted with what has
happened since I left England on Feb
ruary 1. I may. nevertheless, be per
mitted to say that the recent pro-
1 nouncements upon war aims of your
j president and of the British prime
; minister, which are substantially In
, accord and are accepted by the allies,
i have been received with complete un
i animity by the British people. You
' know how vastly the answers made by
the German government have differed
from their professions When entering
: into the negotiations at Brest-Litovsk.
But these utterances have now left no
shadow of doubt that the German gov
ernment is waging this war for con
quest of nations and territory and for
military domination of the world.
But One Answer
"There can be but one answer for
tbe free and democratic nations unit
ed In the struggle against the common
enemy. It is to continue to put forth
all their powers and to employ all of
their resources to resist t his attempt
at military despotism and finally to
bring about a just and lasting peace.
Such a peace alone will give security
against wanton aggression and the vio
; lations of treaties and w ill ensure lib
' erty and justice tor all nations.
"Let me impress upon you that when
I left England the determination to
carry tbe war through to the end was
as fixed as ever. The British people
are ready to face the critical months
before us. perhaps the most critical
of the war, with grim tenacity. They
are prepared to endure whatever suf
i fering or privation or sacrifice may be
mecesairv to obtain the. only posiblfl i
j conclusion of this war. That the Am-!
i make every effort to 1 ring alout this j
'result is the surest guarantee thai the)
1 cause is just and the aim is righieous.

YOUNG BISBEE MAN
FINDS OUT PERSON
WHO PUT THE LID ON
When He Did, However, He
Changed His Mind About
Wishing the State Health
Officer Any Bad Luck.
Waiting for the train Friday night
the crowd w as one young man. a chauf
fear, who was very bitter In his denun-
ciations of Dr. Sweek for quarantining
I'd like to catch the blanket v blank-
ety-blank who closed up the district."
he said in tones that were just quiet
enough so that they would not reach
to Major Frances E. Shine, who was
standing short distance away.
Possibly it would be best to tell the
rest of the story in the young man's
own words, as he related it yesterday
" Bisbee.
I hadn t more than got those words
out than a quiet man who was not
very large, and appeared to be rather
young', stepped up and said:
'Dr. Sweek is my name, I guess
that I'm responsible.'
."I felt like a two-bit piece with a
hole in it and couldn't say anything
for several seconds. Finally I caught
my breath and said. Aw, hell!
"Dr. Sweek laughed and said. 'It is
pretty tough, alright, but it is for the
best and we will lift the quarantine
just as soon as possible.'
I was planning on going to Tomb- j
stone Saturday night to a dance, if I
had to slip through the guards to get j
there, I had a letter from the nicest
little girl you ever saw. asking me to i
come over. But it's all off now. After
tne V- Sweek acted when I made
that break I havent got the heart to:
try and put anything over on him. He
struck me as being so square that I
wouldn't feel right if I got past the j
guards unnoticed so I'm passing up a j
pertectiy good dance ana a date witn
my honest to goodness girl just be
cause he acted so nice to me when he
had provocation enough to knock my
block off."

who is acting as a deputy sheriff to
catch bootleggers and who was caught

useful in-carying away things from
the supply house of the'Copper Queen

pertly. He then secured hold of the
pass book of a fellow workman and
endorsed time thereon and thereby
secured two suits or clothes and had
them charged to this Mexican. He
was caught and will be charged with
obtaining goods under false pretense

Review of tbe mining situation in the state at large this month indicates
more satisfactory conditions, in point of development and mining than since
last summer. The principal retarding feature is la slow delivery of supplies
Organization in the fuel oil division has helped materially and that depart
ment if let alone bids fair to come through safely, which is more than could
be said a few months ago. The labor situation is asy in point of men
available for work, except In the mechanical departments, from which there
have been large losses to government shir-yards work because of higher
pay on government contracts. The government will apparently lave to aid
in the correction of this if it requires maximum copper output.) Provisions
which wOI enable the mechanical departments of mines, mills and smelters
to compete with government wage schedules will have to be made by the
Federal authorities, presumably through higher metal prices. At Globe
maximum forces are now at work, and also at Miami copper. Inspiration
is about filled up and will show material gain in output this month.
Agitation is not lacking in the state at large and a walkout of machinists
at Hayden smelter occurred on Thursday. They ask a 55 ct. increase over
the $5.35 a day they are receiving. It Is expected the difference will be ad
justed. At Jerome, Administrator Myers has announced that he does not
see justification for the demand for increase of $1 the day and other changes
asked by the union. The radicals in the district are talking about withdraw
ing from the agreement tbey made with the government. Headway with

New Cornelia, development is adding materially to the ore of Ajo Con,
taken over by Cornelia in the fall. Work of Copper Queen in preparing
Sacramento Hill for low grade steam shovel production is going on well. At
Jerome the United Verde has put construction work on the railroad exten
sion from Clarkdale up to the 30S level of the mine under rush orders, which
means that it will also hurry its plans for the beginning of steam shovel
operations on the hill back of the old smelter site and from which they will
extract upwards of seven million tons of direct smelting ore. United Verde
Extension smelter construction goes on rapidly except in the fine division,
where lack of brick is delaying them. Otherwise they would be able to
(ire up the first furnaces within 60 days.
Verde Extension Profits.
United Verde Extension Mining Co, is estimated to have made profits
of under $7,000,000 in 1917. which, if
in costs than had been expected.
The

profit in 1917 would have exceeded
ourse ngurea ior isw aue to tne increased wage scale, war costa of
plies, the strike at Jerome, new development, and interrupted transport. A
profit of $7,000,000 would indicate costa around ISc or slightly higher in 1917
versus Be in 191C. Tbe difference is sufficiently marked to attract conspicu
ous attention. It is not clear whether the $7,000,00 profit is after war-taxee.
nor is it clear how much if any expense of the new tunnel, new railroad and
smelter was included in 1917 costs. The company paid $2,992,600 in dividends
In 1917. In 1918 it is starting with 75c quarterly and a special dividend of
$1.50, indicating at least $4.50 for the year, or $4,725,000. If no further extras
be ordered. Production in 1918 is expectei at close to 70.000,000 pounds,
possibly a little more if the smelter begins operation in the early summer
as expected. Even with 13c cost, there Is an indicated operating profit of
$7,350,000 on 23Vc copper for this year, or enough to pay the $4.50 dividend,
pay war taxes, pay some of the new construction expense, and leave the huge
surplus substantially untouched.

SUIT FILED IN NEW YORK COURT DISCLOSES
METHOD OF FINANCING MONSTER CHIEF AT
JEROME, BY PROMOTER GEORGE GRAHAM RICE
Clvde Hovt. the well known ensi-
neer of the Verde district, has brought
suit in the supreme court of New
York couniy to recover from George
Graham Rice $13,450. which he al
leges rs due on a promissory note
given in part payment for the Mon
ster Chief property.
The details of Hoyt s suit, as given
by the New York Cub. are published
below:
A new chapter on high and low
finance, applied to the flotation of an
unproven copper "prospect" in Yava
pai county. Arizona, by George Gra
ham Rice which would constitute a
worthy addition to that financial lit
erature's great work. "My Adventures
With Your Money" is likely to be
writt?n into the court records at the
trial of a suit begun this week against
the redoubtable "G. G.' by a mining
engineer who sold to him the property
of which the "Copper Chief Mining
company" la composed.
Among other details in this episode
on Rite's financing and unload ins of
the Copper Chief prospect which are
expected to be laid bare at the trial
of thU rase- will be the sensational
fact that, although Rice has sold be
tween 800.000 and 900.000 shares of
th "ownershin" or "auasl-Dlunder"
stock of this Monster Chief Copper
Mining company, at an estimatea proi
it of $500,000, neither he nor his as
sociates In that concern's manage
ment have even so much as attempted
doing any development work on Its
property, despite numerous promises
that siKh work was about to be begun
on their own initiative or through an
alleged working agreement with the
Green Monster Mining company.
Merely Prospect
The suit against George Graham
Rice which is thus counted upon to
bring forth these sensational revela
tions on the Rice methods applied to
the financing and marketing of tbe
Monster Chief has been brousht in
rha siinrem court in New York
county by a mining engineer of Je
rome. Ant., named Josepn iyue
Hoyt. who obtained for and sold to
Rtrw the 19 original claims and some
additional claims which now make
up this Rice copper "prospect n
Arizona, whose one best attraction
for investors to date has been found
in its widely advertised adjacency to
the Green Monster Mining company's
fnirlr established claims, and to the
Jerome-Portland property.
Hoyt Has oegun mis sun against
Rice tor the recovery of the balance
amounting to 813.450. Still unpaid
and owing by Rice on a promissory
note for $25,000 gtven by u. m
part payment for the claims constitut
ing Monster Chief Drooerty. which
was due and payable on October 15.
last. Hoyt acknowledges receipt oi
$11,550 from Rice on this $25,000 note
hut in suine for the 813.450 still due
thereon, with interest from October
15. together with the costs ot tne.
action.
The note on which Hoyt's suit was
thus based was drawn and tendered
br Rice on October 27. 191S. It reaiss:
"On October 15. 1916. after date. I
promise to pay to the order of Joseph
Clyde Hoyt. twenty-five thousand
($25,000) dollars at my ornce. u
liam street. New York city. Value re
ceived. "This note Is given pursuant to
the terms of an agreement between
Joseph Clyde Hoyt and George Gra
ham Rice bearing date October 27.
1915. and the payment herein provid
ed is subject to the terms and condi
tions of the said agrement.
(Signed.)
"GEORGE GRAHAM RICE.
The agreement thus referred to.
which was also dated October 27.
1916. gave Rice the privilege of buy
ing from Hoyt. and through that min
ing engineer, as agent for others. 19
claims, six options on claims and a
notice of "location" of a fractional
mining claim all for the relatively
small sum of $75,000.
Of this purchase price. Rice was
permitted by the terms of the agree
ment to pay all except $14,000 in
notes. This agreement also stipulated
that he should organize the Monster
Chief Mining company with a capital
of 200,000.000 shares, having a par
value of $1. and lay aside 1.050.000
shares for himself as "ownership"
stock, to be held in escrow temporari
ly, but obtainable by him upon pay
ment of the $14,000 in cash and upon
the taking up of three notes, one foz
$11,000. and two for $25,000 each. The
remaining 950.000 shares of the stock,
according to this agreement, were to
remain in the company's treasury.
Tale of High Finance
Th? terms of this agreement were
thereafter changed slightly by donat
ing 50.000 shares of the "ownership
stock to Hoyt. who later sold them
back to Rice for $5000. which was
then used to compensate a certain E.
W. Carroll for the 19 claims on which
Hoyt had secured a purchase option.
The 1.000.000 shares of ownership"'
stock thus placed in escrow, but avail
able for Rice, as he raid for same,
was held temporarily by Hoyt's attor
ney. John J. Lawrence. It was Mr
ther stipulated that none of the 950.
000 shares of the treasury stock
should be marketed except at a rate
ot one such treasury share to every
three share of Rice's "ownership
-
stock. As a matter of fact, virtually
none of this treasury stork has ever
been sold.
Rice began his flotation of the
Monster Chief Mining company stock
in November. 1916. after having incor
porated a company under that title,
with an authorized and "issued" capi
tal of 2.000.0i0 shares, having a par
value of $1.. He opened hi3 campaign
by offering the shares at 50 cents.
Within a brief period he had run the
; price of this stork up to SO cents and
jeven to $1 a share. At these levels
many investors bought eagerly, on
rRice'a representations that the prop
j erty w as certain to produce big thines.
because located in the very heart of
(the rich copper zone near Jerome.
I Big Clean Up
Rice sold the stock freely, obtaining
as many shares as he thus sold, with
: which to make deliveries, from Hoyt's
attorney, Lawrence, by paying an av-

FINISHING TOUCHES
RAY HERCULES MILL
ARE BEING APPLIED
RAY. Feb. 9 President Frank
Armstrong of the Ray Hercules Cop
per company is a busy man these
days superintending the finishing
touches on the initial mill unit whk-h
is being whipped into shape and is
expected to begin operations beTore
the winter is over up tere in the
north. Mr. Armstrong is in Arizona
and will supervise the work at the
mines at Ray. and the new mill and
power works at Ray Junction, until
the wheels begin to turn. It is esti
mated that the first mill unit, when
attuned, will produce at the rate of
15.000.000 pounds of copper per an
num. and that the first mill unit will
be followed by one or more additional
units. This copper will be turned out
at absut the same cost, it is expected,
as at Ray. Although Ray Consolidat
ed handles a larger tonnage. Ray Her
cules ore w-ill average little hithet
grade, especially as mined. A produc
tion of 15.000.0o0 pounds per annum
in the first mill unit is based on hand
ling 1500 tons daily of 1.8 per cent
ore and 23 per rent losses In milling
and smelting. The miil will have a
rated capacity of 120 to 1S0O tons,
the latter at forced draught. It Is be
lieved that 1500 tons can conveniently
and efficiently "be handled. As to 1
per cent ore. Ray Hercules can draw
on over 3.000.000 tons averaging 2!,
per cent copper should it be desira
ble to force production at first on
hisber grade ore. The entire 9.500.
000 tons of developed are average
about 1.77 per cent copper.. The mill
ing and smelting losses are expected
to be within 25 per rent, which would
mean approximately SO per cent mill
recoveries. If Ray Hercules can pro
duce 15.000.000 pounds yearly in the
present mill unit at 12c cost, it woui
earn $1.50 a share on 234c copper.
It may materially better the produc
tion record as regards better output
and lower costs if higher grade ore
be hauled for the first year or so.

No privately controlled industry can
have the detailed knowledge of war
needs or control of all its supplies aim
markets to- be able to effect the adjust
ment of its activities necessary for
war purposes. Knon shortages of
essential minerals confront us unless
immediate steps are taken to stimu
late and develop the mining activities
needed. To authorize this necessary
governmental activity the committer
has drawn a bill w hich has been pre
sented to the mines committee in both
houses of congress, and to the various
war boards interested in the matter.
It is believed that the control of the
mineral and allied industries provided
must be authorized either by the pas
sage of this bill, or by incorporating it
in some broader piece of legislation,
if the industries concerned are to be
enabled to bring their full energies to
bear on the winning of the war.
The bill is modeled on the Food Con
trol Act and extends its provisions to
cover the mineral industry and those
industries whose materials come from
it. The sections of the bill are briefly
outlined and explained in the follow
ing statement.
Section 1. This gives the President
power to carry out any or all of the '
provisions of the bill whenever it is
rieressarv, in his judgment, for the
winnin? of the war. Defines "neces
sary" as ores and minerals, products
derived from them, and chemicals.
Section 2. The President is empow
ered to create and use the organiza
tions necessary for carrying out the
provisions of the bill.
Section. 3. This section is exactly
like that in the Food Control Act.
which forbids any person carrying out
the provisions o" the bill from being
pecuniarily interested in any contracts
made under it.
Section 4. This section makes it un
lawful to destroy or willfully waste
"necessities' or to hoard, or monaio
lira, or to limit distribution or produc
tion of such articles.
Section 5. The President is em
powered to license the importation,
mining, manufacturing, storage, or dis
tribution of the articles covered in the
bill: and to regulate the licenses as
may be r.eceRsary. This section is the
one undr which mu' li of the coordi
nation neided would be effected. It
would not entail government operation
but would leave the business in the
owners' hands, and would not neces
sarily go further than to direct his ac
tivities in a way most effective for
winning the war. It is necessary to
hive 'his authority in order ti make
possible the curtailment of the waste
of labor and material in the produc
tion of unnecessary luxuries.
Section 6. This section forbids the
hoarding of products of the mineral
and allied industries and defines hoard '
ing as the accumulation of supplies
(a l not reasonably needed for the bus- f
iness of the owner. Or b for the pur- -pose
of maintaining prices.
Section 7. This section givei the
President power to condemn and sell
hoird1 ar'icles.
Section 8 & 9. Penalty clauses. Ex
actly as in Food Control Act.
Section !. The President is em
powered to requisition such articles
as are covered by the bill, and pro
vides he means for justly compensat
ing the owner. Tbj ni-cessity for this
sectioi lies in the fact that unwise or
unpatriotic persons otherwise might
be able to insf.'.t upon directing their
prnduc s to rrnessenfial uses.
Section Jl This section provides
num in jewelry, to limit the use of
steel in building if necessity demands,
and to stop the use of tin for contain
er of dry substances.
Section 18. Imposes penalty for re
sisting an officer enforcing this law.

papers, and the Outro Rossi (Morn
of Russia) of November 21. a copy of
which has just reached this country.
Erst printed a summary of events,
day by day, from November 7 to No
vember IT. from which a picture or
the revolution in the second Russian j
capital can be obtained- I
The news of the Bolshevikl revolu-i
tin ana th nwrt.hrow of the Dro-I
visional government in Petrograc
reached Moscow November 7. Depu
ties of the workmen and soldiers (the
Bolsheviki faction) and representa
tives of the municipal duma. under
whose banner the anti-Bolsheviki
forces rallied, each immediately took
steps to form an organization to seize j
the helm to Moscow, the represents I
tives of those two hostile powers gaih-1
ering respectively in the palace of thej
governor general and the building 01 1
the municipal council. Both sides fek I
distinctly the inevitable approach oti
a sanguinary encounter.
The Bolsbeviki element in control
of the council of workmen's and sol
diers' deputies put through by a
large majority a resolution to appoint
a military revolutionary committee to
act in harmony with the new Bolshe
vikl regime. The committee at once
issued an order calling upon the Mos
cow garrison to be ready for action
at any moment and to obey only or
ders of the military revolutionary com
mittee. The rival body gathered in
the duma, though admittedly lacking
physical power to oppose the troops
of the revolutionary military commit
tee, organized a committee of public
safety and by proclamation called
upon citizens and soldiers to obey
only this authority and disregard all
mandates and regulations emanating
from the military revolutionary com
mittee. Representatives of various
political parties, professional and
clasa corporations and some military
units called to offer to the committee
of pubilc safety their full support and
if necessary, their lives.
While this preliminary interchange
of proclamations was going on the
Bolsheviki forces had adopted a poli
cy of action and had on November 7
and 8 succeeded fa occupying the
Kremlin, the post and telegraph of
fices and had made an armed attack
on the guard at the municipal duma.
The real fighting, however, bad not
yet begun. " Both sides were gathering
their forces for battle.
The following morning the comman
der of the Moscow miDtary district,
who iiad sided with the anti-Bolsheviki
committee of public safety, pro
claimed Moscow in a state of siege,
and ordered ail troops true to tne
revolution and to the provisional gov
ernment to hurry to the rescue of Mos
cow, and at 7 that evening presented
to the military revolutionary commit
tee an ultimatum ordering the imme
diate dissolution of the committee
and the withdrawal from the Kremlin
of the Bolsheviki military units which
had occupied it- This ultimatum was
disregarded by the Bolsheviki, who
had during the day looted the arsenal
and gun&hops and distributed the
arms among their followers.
. That night the first blood Sowed, a
Bolsheviki detachment firing from
ambush upon guards protecting the
municipal dama building. The civil
war now inaugurated was to last for
days and to cost thousands of lives.
During the whole night of the 9th
skirmishing was going on between Bol
sheviki troop' and those of the tom
uittee of public safety. Heavy gun
lire was beard in the Arbat region;
the cannonade increased toward morn
ing and continued heavy during the
entire day of the 10th, growing in in
tensity toward noon.
The streets of the town were trans
formed into military camps and filled
with armed patrols, barricades were
erected and trenches dug in various
places. A general strike, proclaimed
by the Bolsheviki committee, par
alyzed business and economic life, af
fected all factories and shops, stopped
the street car service and closed every
store, including bakeries and grocer
ies. Normal street life of course
ceased entirely.
The Kremlin was stormed during
the day by the cadets and loyal gov
ernment troops and the Bolsheviki
surrendered. Other Bolsheviki troops
scattered over the whole city and con
tinued fighting. That evening encour
aging news was received from the
front by the committee of public
safety, the commander-in-chief tele
graphing that be was sending to aid
in suppressing the Bolsheviki mutiny
a brigade of the guards with artillery,
which would reach Moscow November
12. while the commander-in-chief of
the western front wired that cavalry
were approaching Moscow to aid
against the Bolsheviki.
The capture by government troops
of the Kremlin and their successful
activity in other parts of the town in
duced the Bolsheviki to start peace
pourparlers with the committee of pub
lic safety. This submitted demands
for the surrender of the entire military
revolutionary committee, court-martial
of the members of the committee and
participants in the uprising and sur
render of all arms by the council of
workmen's delegates. The question of
the dissolution of the Bolsheviki regi
ments should be decided by the mili
tary staff; arrangements for an
armistice should be conducted by the
military authorities; the Bolsheviki
leaders should recognize that the

; duma. Announcing this to the popula-
i tion tne committee of public safety
declared that it would continue fipht-
j ing with all energy against the Bol
shevik! insurrectionists, and mat
troops from the front were approach-
in e Moscow to suppress the mutiny
These reinforcements, however, failed
to arrive and the advantage during
the day was with the Bolsheviki
troops, who seized the powder factory.
the railway stations and the post tele-
eranh offices, and who by evening
again approached the center of the
city.
The fierce fighting during the day,
which resulted in a great number of
casualties and tne destruction oi a
large number of houses, brought
about successful negotiations for an
armistice of 24 hours, to expire at
midnight of the 13th. Both the revo
lutionary committee and the commit
tee of public safety were to be dis
solved, the red and white guards to
be disbanded - and the garrison at
Moscow placed under the authority
or tne commander of the Moscow mO-
ilarT district, assisted by a military
consul.
lt aooa appeared, however, that the
Bolshevikl had used the time or the
pourparlers tQ bring up reinforce-
. d munitjons, and hostilities
were resumed most vigorously, to last
until the afternoon of November 15.
After a period of intense fighting, in
which the Alexeieff military school,
the telephone office and the building
of the military staff, as the chjaj
centers of resistance, were under con
tinuous bombardment by heavy artil
lery, the Bolshevikl succeeded by the
afternoon of Nov. 14 in occupying
the first two buildings and had the
upper hand in other districts of the
city as well.
The number of dead and wounded
was appalling, a great number of
houses were burning and looting was
going on in various parts of the city.
At midnight of the 14th a meeting
of party organisations was held, which
offered its mediation to both sides. Its
efforts resulted io an agreement, vir
tually recognizing the supremacy of
the Bolshevik military revolutionary
committee, the committee of public
safety ceasing to exist and its armed
white guard disbanding and surren
dering its arms, and at 7 o'clock on
the evening of the 15th hostilities for
mally ceased and the civil war in
Moscow was over. Two days later the
military revolutionary committee put
the seal upon its assumption of power ,
by an edict dissolving the municipal
duma for its activities against the
committee of workmen's and soldiers' j
delegates. j
The newspaper account concludes
with an extended review of the dam-!
age and destruction of public build
ings and private houses in various'
parts of the city. The historical
building of the municipal duma,
though not wrecked entirely, had suf
fered severely under the bombard
ment; the musical academy; the
Kamernl theatre and the Girls' School
of Bess were almost completely de
stroyed 'and the old church of Boris
and Gleb had lost its steeples. In the
National hotel, headquarters of the
French and English artillery officers,
from the roof of which the American,
English and French flags floated dur
ing the week of civil war, the interior
was completely devastated. The Iver
skala chapel, seat of the venerated
miracle-working ikon of the Iver
skaia Virgin, had been bombarded, but
the interior had suffered only a lit-
! tie.
The famed Kremlin of Moscow had
been the center of pitiless fighting
and had suffered severely. The beau
tiful Beklemisheff tower, which had
been the target for many shells, was
a ghastly sight, only a heap of broken
stone marking the aite of the tower.
Little was left of the Spassky tower.
A third twore. the Koutafia. was se
verely damaged. The Nikolski Gates
were on the verge of collapse and the
great ikon on top of them had been
destroyed.
HAVE YOU AN ORPHAN

Have you an orphan? A French or

have. It doesn't matter whether you
are old or young, married or single,

want to know what you look like and
how you dress and how you live. They
want to get acquainted with their god

As soon as you receive the name

and our family; your age and your
school work, anything that would nat

picture postcards of Arizona, a snap
shot of yourself, of your house, school,
child friends, dog or anything of per

dolls or toys to France; the shipping
facilities are too limited. Send a little
money instead; they can buy the toys
at home, helping the French shop
keepers at the same time.
Be sure to put enough stamps on

MAJOR KELLY TELLS
DOUGLAS OF GREAT
ADVANCEMENT HERE
The following appeared in the
Douglas International's editorial col
umns several weeks ago, and deals
with matters of interest to the people
of the Warren district. It was writ
ten by Maj. George H. Kelly:
Wednesday morning I left the stage
of the Motor Transit company at Low
ell with the purpose of visiting with
James Brophy. that well known pio
neer prince of the Warren district,
Douglas and the Sulphur Springs val
ley. He was In California. Brophy
at one time got the idea that Califor
nia was a better place to live than
Arizona and went to San Diego and
into a livery stable business. He bad
Dan Ming, now of Douglas, as a part
ner. Though an expert horse trailer,
both Brophy and Ming were unable to
cope with the sharks around San
Diego, so the business was soon di.
posed of and they hiked back. Brophy
to the Warren district and Ming to a
cattle ranch in the Aravaipa canyon.
I found a few old-timers yet in
Lowell who helped to make that town
famous. Mr. Ritter of the Lowell
Drug company, said that business Is
good and the up-to-date appearance of
his store surely indicated prosperity.
I found Scott Whaley at the "old
stand" where once gathered hundreds
every evening to see the rbulet wheel
roll, the faro tables in action and the
trap game inviting play. Now Bevo is
the only beverage and panglngue the
only game. The old place is filled
with pool tables and the Ions mahog
any bar has disappeared.
Two doors toward Bisbee Emil
Marks, once the leading tonsorial ar
tist in Bisbee before Lowell was dis
covered, is in the lumber business.
During the boom of the early nineties
Marks sold some claims to some Mich
igan people and they were put into
Marquette Copper company. Marks
was general manager of the company,
but before any considerable ore was
discovered work was discontinued.
Last yar Marks and some of his Bis
bee friends sold some land in one ot
the Oklahoma oil bflts; considerable
money has been spent on this prop
erty and it is the belief that it will
yet prove a source of good fortune for
those interesed in it.
In Bisbee I ran on to J. J. Bowen.
Jim Henderson and Senator C M.
Roberts eating lunch in the anti
wobbly joint known as the English
Kitchen owned by Bill Truax and his
son William. The sight of these three
gentlemen suggested politics and the
reminder that C. M. Roberts is known
to be an aspirant for governor, await
ing a favorable opportunity to slip
into the executive' chair. It U Be
lieved by a good many that Roberts
has the strongest call for the influ
ence of Governor Hunt and his polit
ical mrchine in the coming guberna
torial race should he enter it. though
a good many believe that Senator Fred
Colter has already been assured of the
Hunt favor, though it is conceded that
Roberts has been always loyal to the
governor, though perhaps not approv
ing of all his policies.
Thinking of Roberts and his buz
zing gubernatorial bee reminded me
that Judge Fred Sutter of Bisbee Is
also being urged strongly by the dem
ocrats of Bisbee to enter the race
this year for governor. I did not find
any one that would say that Judge
Sutter had consented to make the
race, but about all tile prominent dem

ocrats in the Warren district are wil
ing t- back Sutter against the field.
Tliey claim that sin-- ihe entering
wedge began to split and weaken the
democratic party, Sutter has been
busy with his law practice and lias not
been aligned prominently with eitiier
party faction. While in 1914 he an
nounced for Governor Hunt as the
party nominee for governor as against
Dr. Hughes of Phoenix, that was
about the extent of his support, and
while he can be classed as a conser
vative democrat he has always pre
served his loyalty to his party by
supporting the democratic ticket. So
unanimous U the democratic senti
ment in Bisbee for Judge Sutter t.at
any one opposing him would have Tit
ficulty in getting a political "toe holJ"
in the Warren district.
M. A. Peterson, at one time in
charge of the purchasing department
of the Calumet c Arizona Mining com
pany, has been in the Warren district
lor several days. Peterson left Ari
zona several years ago. but returned
to Jercme about a year ago and since
has been employed in buying material
for the new smelter now being con

the first blast of this new furnace can
be put into service in April, but
that it might be longer, depending on

Brit sh forces In Palestine which took
Jerusalem, has given him a remark
able prestige in the east, according to
a statement told by military men re
turning from Palestine.
For many generations, it Is said,
there l,as been a poetic prophecy cur
rent among the Arabs and other non
Turkish tribes of the east that "he
ho shall save Jerusalem and exalt
her among the nations will enter tb
city a'oot. and his name will be God
the Prophet."
General Allenby entered Jerusalem
by the Joppa Gate on toot, and now.
it seems, his name is being interpret
ed by the tribesmen as Allah Nab!,
the former word meaning "God" and
the latter "Prophet." Therefore his
triumph over the Turks has been ac
cepted as a direct divine interposi
tion. HOLLAND YOUTH IS
