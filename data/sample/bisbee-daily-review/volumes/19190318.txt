NEW YORK, March 17. Announce
ment of the intention of the Lager
Brewers board of trade to secure toe
government's definition of non-intoxicants
was made today following unan
imous adoption of a resolution advo
cating legal action to test validity of
the presidential proclamations and in
ternal reveneu rulings based on the
food conservation laws of August 10,
1917, and November 21, 1918. The lat
ter act, providing for war-time prohibi
tion, already has been challenged as
to its constitutionality In a stock
holders' suit filed here in the' federal
court.

Kooi-ouuirie opinion, ana mat in case ;

missioner of internal revenue, the de-'
fendants at once communicate with
the board, "so that there may be har
mony and consistency on the conduct
of legal proceedings to protect the
rights of the brewers."
2 3-4 Per Cent Planned
The opinion was addressed to Chris
tian W. Feigenspan of Newark, N. J.,
president of the United States Brew
ers' association, with which the New
York board is associated.
Elihu Root and William D. Guthrie,
counsel for the brewers, based their
opinion, it was stated, upon an assur
ance by their clients that "malt
liquors which contain not to exceed
2.75 per cent of alcohol by weight, or
3.3 per cent by volume, are not intoxi-
catine" and that this could be "estab-1
lished by the evidence of experts and'
other competent witnesses." j

i Supreme Court Ruling
In reference to the suggested in-
junction against government interfer
ence with the brewers' announced plan
of action, their counsel advised that
"the supreme court of the United
States had clearly decided that a suit
may be thus brought against a federal
officer acting or threatening to act in
excess of his authority or under valid
ity made authority- It seems to us
reasonable, that if such a suit were
pending, the government would not
proceed summarily by way of seizure
or arrest, but would co-operate to
bring about a speedy determination by
the courts of the grave questions in
volved.'

Truth Concerning Civil Serv

Eringing with him the complete rec

seivice bill,-known as senate bill No.

a finaiiv nut th Kenate on record
as to individuals and their stand on
the measure.
A vote of record on the bill was not
forced until the last day of the legis
lature, mainly, declares Mr. Hughes,
because opposition had developed to
the will which doomed it to defeat.
By holding off the vote, the senator
states, he hoped a rally of sufficient
strength to rush it through In the
final hours. 'When at last he forced
the vote, eight senators voted for
the bill and eleven opposed it. The
vote stood:

'I'M THROUGH SAYS
HENRY STARR, NOTED
FOR BANK ROBBERIES
Daylight Raider Paroled by
McKinley Again Freed
From Prison
(By Review Leased "Wire)
OKLAHOMA CITY. Okla.. March 17.
Henry Starr, bank bandit, arrived in
Oklahoma City tcxiay, paroled from the
state penitentiary at McAlester by
Governor Robertson.
Starr had been in prison since 1915,
when he was captured after a series
of robberies in Oklahoma. Kansas
that were marked by extreme bold
ness.
The capture of Starr was effected at
Stroud, Okla.. in March. 1915. when
Paul Curry. 16 years old. shot Starr in
the hip. while the bank robber and
his men were escaping after robbing
a bunk. -
Starr pleaded guilty and was sen
tenced to 25 years in prison, with the
agreement. . Governor Robertson said
today, that he would be paroled within
five years. The parole, the governor
explained today, is merely carrying
out the terms of the agreement enter
ed into by the prosecution at the time
of the trial.
Starr's robberies were daylight bank
raids and for months he and his men
seemed to lead charmed lives.
Before coming to Oklahoma Starr
served one term in . the Ohio state
penitentiary. He was sentenced for a
life term for robbing a bank but was
paroled' by President McKmler and
restored to citizenship by President
Roosevelt. He is a highly educated
Cherokee Indian and his relatives ar
said to be wealthy. Starr is 48 years
old. ... - .
I'm through," he said today, "if
for no other reason than I know the
game can't be beaten. I'm going to
prove to 'my son that 1 can go
straight."
"Romantic Marriage
The story of Starr's jnarriage to the
woman whose untiring efforts for his
freedom have been rewarded, is one of
the most romantic spots in his career.
In 1902 when a train was held up
Pf;ar Pry or Creek, Okla., a girl passen
ger, crazed by fear, ried into the dark
ness. Starr found her and took her
on his horse to the robber camp. He
then put her on a train to continue her
journey. Afterward he went to Joplin,
Mo- and married her.

This is the first instance of definite
mention being made of the arrest of
independent socialists and ii is be
lieved to be probable that the report
was given out owing to a desire by the
the government to expose the connec
tion of the independents with the Spar

dependent leaders have stoutly denied.

"Many of the men feel that they;

said. '"I feel that this ambition should
be encouraged. However, during the I
period of readjustment these men I
should resume their old employment!

GAY PARTIES ENDED
AS SHERIFFS RAID
ALLEGED 'LOVE NEST'
Midnight Revelry Meets its
Doom When Law Swoops
Down and Spoils Party

The "Love Nest" is no more. Gay
parties in the wee small hours of the
morning, just before.
"Down the dark and silent street.
Dawn, with her silver-sandled feet,
"Creeps, like a frightened girl"
have come to an end. Not that those
who wish to see "Dawn creep down
th street" won't be allowed to do so
far from it, if they have any legitimate
reason for keeping late hours. But
midnight revelry, continuing until
morning, is another thing, according
to those officers to whom is entrusted
the duty of keeping the Warren dis
trict's peace.
Tales of wine, women and song, and.
more often than not, war women and
song, have been whispered about the
district for four weeks,- following the
occupation by newcomers of a certain
house on Dodson road, known to those
in on the "secret "as the "Love Nest."
Information given in "secret." "not to
be whispered to a soul" you know
recounted paw parties with music,
dancing, women, liquor, and all the ac

' But, as frequently happens, resi

to being kept awake all night 'while
the revelry continued. And. as is us

Accordingly Deputy Sheriffs Tom

THIN PEOPLE
SHOULD TAKE
PHOSPHATE
Nothing Like Plain Bitro-Phosphate to
Put on Firm, Healthy Flesh and :
to Increase Strength, Vigor
and Nerve Porce.
. Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty
there are evidently thousands of men
and women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed in modern foods.' Physicians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic phos
phate known among druggists as.bitro
phosphate, which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball of Bisbee and all
druggists under a guarantee of satis
faction or money back. By feeding the
nerves directly and by supplying the
body cells with the necessary phos
phoric food elements, hitro-phosphate
quickly produces u welcome transfor
mation in the appearance; ! the in
crease in weight frequently being
astonishing. ' .
This increase in weight also carries
with" it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thinness, soon
disappear, "dull eyes-Jbecome bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom
of perfect health. -'
CAUTION: Although bitro-phos-phate
is unsurpassed for- relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and general
weakness, it should not, owing to its
remarkable flesh-growing properties,
be used by anyone who does not de
sire to put on flesh. Adv.

No need exists for an extra session of the state legislature, because
there is no need for additional or further road legislation. The state and
the fourteen counties of the state are amply provided with funds ar ma
chinery for obtaining funds. Failure of some measures In the legislature
just closed has not Interfered with proposed highway construction or
plans.
In the first place, counties of the state are provided with machinery
through the county highway law and amendments, passed by the present
legislature which will raise ample funds within a shorter period than any
of the proposed, but unpassed laws of the legislature.
In the second place the state, through the old one mill levy will re
ceive about $800,000, augmented by $G00,000 passed by the legislature and
by federal moneys, which will bring the state engineer nearly three
millions of dollars for road construction during the present year. .
The county machinery is based on the county highway commission
law of 1917. Under Senate bill 22 of the past legislature the commission,
which is already supplied in Cochise county, may proceed immediately
to select roads ror improvement under section 3 of the law of 1917.
Under paragraph 5269, of the revised statutes of 1913, the hoard of super
visors may order an election at any time after receiving the report of
the county highway commission, as provided in the 1917 law for reports.
These elections are to be called not less than 30 nor more than 60
days from the date of the board's order, and if authorized by the election,
bonds can be sold upon 30 days' notice, under paragraph 5276, revised
statutes of 1913. Under this provision the bonds could be authorized and
Bold by July 1.
Under any tax levy which could be made, the rolls could not be com
pleted nor the levy rate fixed until the third Monday in August. Funds
under this levy could not be made available until the collection of regular
county taxes in November.
Machinery at hand now leaves a simple method of procedure open
to the boards of supervisors of the state for securing funds within 60 days
at the most. Passage of senate bill 143 makes this period even shorter
-under certain conditions, and in this county little more than six. weeks
need elapse' before funds can be provided by a direct voice of the people.
Supervisors can request highway commissions to prepare reports at once
and as soon as these reports are received, they can call an election. If
the people of the county favor the issuance of bonds, they can be sold
at once. In this manner funds will be available in known quantities fixed
Iby the board and highway commission to 1)e expended on defined high
ways. In the Taising of large levies for road work or other public improve
ment, several questions naturally arise.
First: Do all the people wish the highways?
The machinery at hand provides that the people shall say through a
special election, whether they wish the highways.
Second: Where shall the highways be built?
Machinery at hand provides the election ballot 6hall state definitely
the roads to be built, and the amounts to be expended on each section.
Third: Who will have the -spending of the moneys?
Machinery at hand provides that a capable body of highway experts,
headed by a highway engineer, the highway commission, shall have charge
of the spending of the moneys. j
Every possible end sought through the laws which failed in the legis
lature just closed is fully covered and the public is fully protected
through the existing legislation.
There Is no need for a levy of five mills as proposed by one of the
measures, because the machinery at hand offers a better, more equitable
and more personal means of securing as large a fund.
There is no need for the other measures, because the state Is amply
supplied with moneys for the coming year.
There is - no need for an extra highway-discussion and - legislation
session of the state legislature!
Time Well Spent
Of course, the fiction books in a public library are in constant cir
culationy but it is seldom that the personality of the readers is impressed
upon their pages.
Seldom is It that anything on the margins or between the pages of
such books catches the attention or arouses interest.
But when an inspection is made of the books in the reference depart
ment, what interesting discoveries we make and what astonishing
glimpses we get into the minds of those people who have poured over
them.
What a forlorn outlook on life has the man who upon the margin
of a page in "The Riddle of the Universe" penciled this comment: "There
is no hereafter, I know it absolutely!"
And what a straightforward, confident attitude toward life and death
has the ypung woman who in the firm optimistic lines of youth wrote
upon the margin of a Bible Commentary page "God is good to me!"
What sort of a down and outer was he whose grimy bands soiled the
pages of a bound volume of The Yale Review?.
Was he a college graduate who had gone'wrong or failed in the game
of life, or a poor toiler thwarted in his dreams of education and ad
vancement? What sort of a person left three voilets between the pages of "The
Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire" a woman who had muddled into the
tomes by mistage. an aged, prof essor interested both in botany and history,
or a college girl combining sentiment and study?
And who was the saddening, aging spinster who in the prim, precise
lines of a school teacher wrote in a pathetically drooping .hand upon the
margin of a page in an encyclopaedia dealing with "Marriage" these soul
revealing words:" "I wish I was married"?
If you would get new, surprising slants at human character, spend
a half hour turning the iges of reference books in a public library and
looking fcr things like these.
Whoever Heard of a Fish Sitting Down?
We know a man who says it's unnatural to sit down.
It sterns he says we've passed through several forms of life,
stages of existence. For argument's sake he started with the crustacean
period. So our mind might glimpse better, he declared we were once
fishes!
That we granted, for some of us are jet known as sharks, eels, crabs
and beg pardon skates. We bade him continue so far we still had our
head above water.
Then he shot over the death blow "whoever heard of a fish sitting
down?"
Noxt. we wero reptiles.
Again the knockout "can you imagine a snake seated?"
The gentleman now has us beroozlcd. and at his mercy. He said
ekphauts only sat in n'reutcs. that monkeys never had till tlicy aped,
their oldr brother, man!
Then he commenced to pitch wild. He said we-were at one time
trees. We held that it was doubtless because we'd stood all the ways down
the eras that the relaxation of sitting was discovered to us in this lire.
He still stood stoutly by his theory the past proved it unnatural
that we sit down. ? .

There Was Nothing So Good
for Congestion and Colds
as Mustard
But the old-fashioned mustard-nlaster
burned and blistered while it acted. Get
the relief and help that mustard
plasters gave, without the plaster and
without the blister.
Musterole does it. It is a clean, white
ointment, made with oil of mustard. It is
scientifically prepared, so that it works
wonders, and yet does not blister the
tenderest skin.
Just massage Musterole in with the finger-tips
gently. See how quickly it brings
relief how speedily the pain disappears.
Use Musterole for sore throat, bron
chitis, tonsilitis. croup, stiff neck, asthma,
neuralgia, headache, congestion, pleurisv,
rheumatism, lumbago, pains and aches of
the back or joints, sprains, sore muscles,
bruises, chilblains, frosted feet, coids of
the chest (it often prevents pneumonia),

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, March 17. Over
whelming endorsement of a universal
military training system, coupled with
equally strong support for the existing
disciplinary relationship between offic
ers and men of the army, was express
ed by a representative group ot the
selective service men of the 12th di
vision. Camp Devens, Mass., just be
fore the organization was demobilized
last January. The opinions of the men
numbering 1330, with an average
length of service of 10.7 months, vere
obtained through a carefully arrangea
questionnaire system with every safe
guard provided to insure' absolutely
free expression of opinion and wita
such distribution in the division as to
make the answers representative.
The report on the inquiry was made
public today at the war department.
It is headed:
' Our military system as it appeared
to America's citizen soldiers."
Half Dissatisfied
Although half of the questioned
rated as dissatisfied with military life.
the reports show that 89.5 per cent of
the replies expressed the soldiers' be
lief that he personally had benefitted
by his army liie, 79 per cent were glad
of their training aside from fee:ings
of patriotism and 88 per cent favored
universal military training as a na
tional policy. A substantial majority
agreed that the existing .relationship
between officers and men was neces
sary and disapproved the social mix
ing of the rank and file.
The largest number of suggestions
as to improvements in the service re
ceived had to do with better fitting
uniforms or changes in mess arrange
ments.
There were more than 20,000 in the
12th division, at the time of the in
quiry, representing 47 states. The or
ganization was awaiting orders for
France when the armistice was signed.
It then suffered more than two months
of wait in e for demobilization before
the questionnaires were sent out and
the officers who devised and super
vised the inquiry point out that it was
thus calculated to reflect army morale
at its low ebb.
All Views Given
Every provision was mad to ascer
tain the views of discontented men
in order that the results might have
real value to the army.
Ten questions were submitted each
respecting impressions tc be gained
from the service. As to the disciplin
ary relations, 787 men answered it was
necessary against 135 who held it un
necessary; 295 said it was harsh
acainst 140 of opposite view; 27S said
' . . 1 ITT 41..-
it was democratic auu io
posite, and 193 held that it depended
on the officer. In the individual ans
wers was found material which
prompts the report to state that
"many criticisms were directed
against the overbearing manner seen
in some young officers." One soldier
said: "It all depends on how much
brains God gave the officer," and an
other said: "We have to have dis-
XEW YORK. March 17. The stock
market today entered upon its fifth
consecutive week of speculative activ-J
ity, the extensive operations being ac
companied by developments helpful
in the main to the long account.
All the news was not of an en
couraging character, however, as dem
onstrated by a sensational break in
exchange on Paris and the adverse an
nual report of the American Smelting
Company, together with some state
ments submitted by some other im
portant industrial corporation.
Oils eclipsed all other issues, their
strength probably resulting largely
from Mexican advices which are cal
culated to make for greater stability
of foreign concessions. Mexican Pe
troleum, Texas Company and Sinclair
Oil made extreme gains of 5 to SM
points, the latter leading the entire
market in point of activity.
United States steel followed its
course of the past fortnight, reacting
sharply, making full recovery and fall
ing back again later.
Rails and shippings developed a re
actionary tone and tobaccos and leath
ers displayed little of their recent
strength. Sales amounted to 1,150,000
shares.
Reflecting the weakness of Paris
Exchange, French municipal bonds re
acted fractionally. Liberty issues
eased slightly and the general bond
list was irregular. Total sales, par
value, aggregated siu.suu.uuu. uia
United States coupon 4's gained

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, March 17. Highest
prices yet this season resulted In the
corn market today chiefly from wet
weather hindrances to farm work and
to the crop movement. The close was
strong at 2c to 5?4c net advance,
with May $1.42 to $1.42Vi and July
Sl.So to $1.35.2. Oats gained 4c
to lc and provisions 60c to $1. !
Nearby deliveries of corn showed ,
the greater strength, as heavy rains
throughout the belt had rendered the
roads impassable in most sections. Un
der such circumstances the outlook
was that there would be no adequate
supply of corn available for delivery.
on May contracts. At the same time
the meagerness of the stocks on Band
was greatly emphasized by the pros
pect of large purchases of food stuffs
for Germany. A mroad demand en
sued, but owing to profit-taking sales
the top prices reached were not held.
Additional buying of Argentine corn
that was reported did not lead appar
ently to any reselling of domestic
corn.
Unfavorable weather for plowing
and seeding had a bullish effect on
oats. Besides Eastern stocks were
said to be light.
Provisions scored maximum gains
all around. The impetus came from
grain strength and from likelohood of
increased European orders. The mar
ket, however, was only moderately active;

the shooting of Dr. Wolff was pre

A statement which Deputy Sheriff
Hiram Brown testifed Dr. Ishida had
given him was admitted in evidence
for the State and was in part as fol
lows: "Dr. Wolff tried to make people in
the hospital believe that I am a spy
while I am a doctor, and he succeeded
in getting a girL a woman I liked, to
believe that I am a spy, which wa3
discovered. He is jealous of me about
this girl, and after he exhausted his
tricks to let her misunderstand me,
at last assaulted her against her will.
So I made this act for the honor of
both nations and the girt"
Dr. T. Matsumator, sent by the Jap
anese government to Phipps clinic of
Johns Hopkins hospital testifed that
Dr. Ishida was married and had a
wife and two children in Japan. On
cross examination Dr. Matsumator
said Dr. Ishida visited him four days
before tne shooting, tnat he com
plained of being persecuted by Dr.
Wolff, but that Dr. Wolff would soon

Spy Charge Resented
Dr. Edward Brush, superintendent
of the Sheppard-Pratt hospital, in his
testimony told of taking the revolver
from Ishida after the shooting and of
tne accused saying he had shot Dr.
Wolff because he had called him a
spy. Dr. Brush further stated that
Ishida had complained to him that
Wolff watched and stared at him.
Asked if Ishida had ever spoken of
Dr. Wolff assaulting a nurse Dr.
Brush said that he positively had not.
He said he would have sent the Jap

such an accusation for he knew Dr.
Wolff to be a gentleman In every re

HIGH SCHOOL PLAY TONIGHT.
The indications are that the high

Truth is stranger than fiction, al-!
though the old English statement that j
"the law shall take its course," oft-1

of some unfortunate prisoner. and with
detriment to the other poor unfortun

the men, however, told the officers
that all their funds had been stolen
by two robbers who had entered their

This set the polite ' to thinking, and
they realized that if the robbers were
arrested it would take strong evidence
to convict them. Local authorities
talked it over with county authorities
and it was agreed unanimously to let
the poker players go free if they would
promise to testify against the robbers.
Consequently the robbers were or
