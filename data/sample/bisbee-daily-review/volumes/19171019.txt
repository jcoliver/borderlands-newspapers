Fuel Administrator Garfield
and President White of
Miners Confer On the Situa
tion. Order is Delayed.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct 18. Both Fu
el Administrator Garfield and Presi
dent John P. Whi:e, of the United
Mine Workers, expressed confidence
today that the strike Of coal miners
in the central competitive field of Ohio
Illinois, Indiana and Pennsylvania
would be settled within a short time.
President White left tonight for his
headquarters in Indianapolis where he
will continue his efforts to induce the
men to return to work. ,
White Optimistic.
Despite reports indicating a spread
of strike sentiment among the men,
Mr. White was optimistic when he
left Washington. At the fuel admin
istration it was said that he viewed
the strike movement as sporadic and
believed the trouble w'ould be adjust
ed within a few days by an appeal to
the patriotism of the men not to per
mit the nation's coal supply to be dim
inished. Should Mr. White's efforts fail. It is
understood that the fuel administra
tion is prepared to lay before Presi
dent Wilson a drastic plan for making
certain an adequate coal supply.
Coal Horded.
When Informed today of reports
from points in the middle west that
manufacturers and others were board
ing coal, officials at the fuel adminis
tration said every effort would be
made to prevent hoarding and that
whenever a case was found the coal
would be seized and distributed. No
'official reports of hoarding however,
had reached the administration.
STRIKE HELD UP.
' KANSAS CITY, Mo., Oct. 18. Nego
tiations for a settlement of the differ
ences of the 35,000 coal miners of the
southwest fields and the Southwest
Coal operator's association were begun
late today. The district presidents of
the United Mine Workers of America
earlier in the ay 'after conferences
with the operators, deferred the walk
out which was to have taken place to
morrow morning.
Resume Negotiations.
The postponement came after both
sides agreed to disregard points of dif
ferences which led to the strike ferder
and resume negotiations where they
had been broken. Alexander Howat,
president of the Kansas Mine Workers
John Wilkinson, president of the Okla
homa division and D. A. Frampton,
president of the Missouri miners, how
ever, declare they will not agree to
the insertion of a "penalty" clause in
the contract, a point which led to the
strike order
Warning Counts.
The, action of the miners came after
telegrams had been received by the
miners and operators from John P.
Whi:e. president of the national or
ganization of the mines and Dr. H. A.
Garfield, federal fuel administrator,
asking that the strike be deferred and
negotiating resumed.
The union presidents declared they
were desirous of effecting a settlement
without the necessity of calling a
strike.
John Wilkinson, president of District
21, which is comprised of Oklahoma,
Arkansas and a portion of Northern
Texas, said that only the two former
states w'juld be affected by the post
ponement oi the strike and that a
meeting with the Texas operators
would be held next Tuesday.
. BELIEVE STRIKE SETTLED.

only with the imperial German gov-',
eminent that has sought to impose
the power of militarism upon the pen
pl'j of the world, rather than the will
of the majority." !
Secretary Wilson referred to the
declaration by some that this is a
capitalists war. j
Whoso War.
"I wonder," he asked, "if these pee;
pie have stopped to examine the poli-j
cy pursued by the government .sr,ie
war " as declar-j and before it wgs i
iteclfred, before they made utteran-e
of this kind. If this is a capitalists''
war it follows that the admin'stration j
at Washington, congress and the presi-j
dent have beejn dominated by capital- j
i.--nt and if thty were dominate-1, by
capitalism in declaring war li would ,
follow that they w uld be dominated!
by capitalism in pursuing the war. My
friends, this is a war of the people j
of the United tSates for the preserve '
tion of their institutions and for the
purpose of preserving those institu- j
tions, we are gathering together arm-i
ies. We are sending the flower of our
youth to the training camps and over
the seas to France to protect those;
who remain at home.
Ancient Methods.
He referred to ancient methods of
warfare whereby an army might travel
through an enemeis' country and sus
tain itself while it marched receiving
a small amount of needed muintions
fro mthe employment of a small num
ber at home, but today, he said, this
has changed and we need not only
the fighting forces at the front, jiot
only the boys in the trenches, but the
organization of the forces at home for
the production of material for their
defeu3. The secretary referred proud
ly to the fact that he has three sons
and eight nephews today under the
colors and that if loss or injury conies
to them In the course of the regular
struggle where they are supplied by
all munitions and where they can be
taken care of as they should be, then
his grief will be mingled with pride
that those of his family made the sac
rifice necessary for the maintenance
of the institutions.
Appeals to All.
"In conclusion," he said, "let me
appeal to you in the name of the pres
ident of the United States, in the name
of the country, to gather into your
bosom that spirit of self sacrifice o
our boys going to the front and I have
no doubt that as a lesult of that spirit
or self sacrifice, your troubles in this
district where '.you . have had labor
troubles will be overcome. You will
be adding to the material needed for
the welfare of your government and
you will be building for yourselves a
reputation as beina patriotic citizens,
looking not to your own self interests,
out to ine weeiare ui your country a,si
a whole. Make the sacdifice, adjust
your difficulties ana in addition buy
a bond."
Spangler Talks.
Col. J. H. Spangler, another member
of the industrial commission here look
ing into the labor troubles, made a
brief humorous and patriotic ad
dress. I
"I'vs been a German back in the'
seventeenth centruy," he said, "ij
speak the language and read it. I!
have no other blood in me. But I have
been 150 years over here and I thank
lod my ancestor in 1749 landed in
Pennsylvania and hadn't been the
?oun'ry 20 years till he enlisted in tht

If You're Under Fifteen,
Read On; If Over, Sigh!
Whee-e-e-e, kids!
How would you like to win tickets
to the Al. G. Barnes Big Four Ring
Wild Animal Circus, the most marvel
ous circus in the world, where lions
and bears and tigers and leopards, and
the funniest little monkeys and dogs
ride horses?
Of course you want to win some
tickets, and The Review Is going to
help you do it.
Now, read this carefully, every word
of it, and then get your pencil, ask
Papa Or Mamma or Teacher to help
you and get busy.
The Barnes Circus, with wild and
domestic animals doing all the things
that people are seen doing in other
circuses, is coming to Bisbee on Octo
ber 26. It will come into town on two
railroad trains of double lejigth cars.
It will unload hundreds "of the most
beautiful animal cages, band wagons,
caliopes and banners, and at 10:30
o'clock a. m. it will give the most glit
tering parade, two miles long, that was
ever seen in Bisbee.
Then folks will have time to g
home and eat a good dinner, after
which they' may go to the show
grounds at 1 o'clock and see a most
death-defying high dive by a dare-devil
who is willing to risk his life each
day to thrill you. This will be free
for everybody.
Then will come an hour of band
music, and the Barnes Circus carries
fix concert and military bands. The
doors of the circus open at 1 o'clock
at which time every boy and girl at
tending the afternoon performance
may have free, a personally conducted
tour of the immense animal tents. Mr.
Jaques, an explorer, lecturer and hung
er of wild animals, will tell you the
history cf each and every animal, how
it was captured and educated by Mr.
Barnes, the big animal wizard, to do
the wonderful things they are seen do
ing each afternoon and evening.
The seats provided for you are new,
clean, and have backs and loot rests.
Electric light and electric fans mak
ing the big tent as brilliant and as
comfortable as a huge theatie.
At 2 o'clock the circus opens with
the grand pageant in which the 1.000
animals, 150 trainers, 506 attendants,
6 bands, the 40 clown animals, includ
ing the cutest little baby elephant and
his proud mamma; "Holy Moses", the
rare black camel, the 20 funny pigs,
the 550 beautiful, prancing pOnies and
marching horses will participate.
Following this will come 65 of the
most amazing, death-defying, science
upsetting, side-splitting, heart-thrilling
I acts and features by wild animals
handled by handsome men and beau
tiful women you ever saw in your life,
or will ever see so long as circuses are.
No fakirs or "grafters" are allowed
in or about the circus or the giOunds,
all the sideshow features, the happy
' spirit, the playing bands and funny
clowns are there. It is a real old-time
circus, made modern and wonderful.
Human clowns are funny, but just
think of pics being clowns, and dogs,
, and elephants, and mules, and even
. b ars0
Then, in the evening, the circus
1 doors will open at 7 o'clock and the
, circus will begin at 8. And. mark you,
you just see as much circus in the ev
! ening as you do in the afternoon. No
j tearing down of seats or tents or mov
ing of wagons while the show is going
on. Mr. Barnes' men are there to en
i tertain you, his wonderful animals are
i there to thrill and instruct you, and
not a seat falls, not a wagon moves,
nothing is done but look after your
pleasure and your comfort until the
i last complete event of the entire pro
gram is over.
Everything is clean, wholesome,
moral, elevating and refined.
ot a word, not an act, not an inci
dent that is not of the most fastidious
refinement.
Now, just think, for a whole day this
. fairyland of animals is going to be
here.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. Austria's
army has been so worn down that it
has been necessary to draw upon the
landstrum for men for first line duty, :
according to cables today from Berne.
These reports quote proceedings in the
Austrian reichsj-ath recently when
the Austrian minister of national de
fense replying to assertions from the
plilitary committee that the Old men
called out of the landstrum were unfit
for service, said the wearing down of
the Austrian military forces made it
absolutely necessary to call for auxil
iary service with the shortest possible
delay, even thought it had brought out
large number of men unfit for service.

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

THE FARMER AND HIS WHEAT.
To people living in the highly industrialized state of
Arizona where copper reigns supreme and wheat is
merely a word used to conjure with, the attitude of the
farmers of the middle west seems peculiar, to say the
least. To those who live from a daily wage paid by
copper producing companies, where the price of copper
is stated, these men appear to be attempting to trade
places with what is known as profiteers.
Products of the- farm are indispensible to the lives
of all American. Copper, iron, tin, lead and thousands
of other products are also Indispensible. Mythology rec
ords a period of time when food, alone, was necessary.
That time passed before gunpowder was invented. Both
food and metals are needed and badly. By agreement.
or otherwise, many of the products of American farms
and factories and mines have been priced by the gov
ernment. There is some complaint. A little has been
heard from copper producers. A little has emanated from
other industrial circles. But the greatest wail comes fron.
the farmer whose wheat for 1917 must be sold at $2.20 a
bushel.
Poor Mr. Farmer!
Pampered, petted, abused, cajoled and bilked, the form
er of the United States wears a perpetual chip on his
shoulder. When the nation decided to knock that piece
of wood from its resting place, the governmental agency
took a healthy blow and returned a big price for wheat.
The farmer is either parochial In his instincts or is con
genital to an infinite degree. He is perhaps a modifies
tion of the two.
Time was when dollar wheat gave the farmer his
notes back from the bank, an automobile, a tractor en
. gine, the best food .in the world home grown and
money in the bank, with which to educate his children
and replace any part of his house which he may have
whittled away in his leisure moments. Wheat now brings
the farmer $2.20. Yet he cries. Let it be acknowledged
that the prices of everything those used by the farmers
included have soared until, to see the top, it is neces
sary to crane the neck and stretch the pocketbook. The
farmer is getting over one hundred per cent more for his
grain today than he did over a given average of years.
The copper producers, on the other hand, get a stated
price of approximately sixty-five per cent increase above
the average of ten years. There is no hue and outcry,
however, from the copper producers. They are mobiliz
ing their sons, their wealth and their industries. They,
in other words, are not parochial.
Support of the war, from every possible angle, is ab
solutely necessary. The farmers are needed. Their prod
uct is essential to a successful prosecution of the war.
More than any other class,' they can protect themselves
from the increased cost of living. They substitute sup
port for bickerings, however, and refuse aid and comfort
to their country, thereby giving the enemy what they
should be extending at home.
It is to be hoped the farmer will come to his senses.
He must help the present Liberty Loan as other classes
are helping.
E. D. Hulbert, a Chicago banker, in discusing the lack
of interest in the loan throughout the middle west pene
trated the crux of the question:
"The one weak spot in the situation is the attitude
of the farmers. They will neither buy Liberty Bonds, pay
taxes, sell their produce or fight. I have asked many
out of town callers here about farmers paying taxes and
I have heard of only one instance of a fanner paying an
income tax. They have profited throughout the period of
the war, but are unwilling to help the government In any
of the four ways mentioned. .The farmers have been
hampered by politicians until they seem to feel they are
a privileged class.
Heretofore, the American farmer has been the back
bone of the nation. Let it not be said that in the present
extremity he did not do his duty.
iever look a gift horse In the mouth. No look him
in the eye!
THE FIRST HIT.
An American destroyer, cruising in the. European war
zone, has been struck by a torpedo. One man was killed
and five injured. It is the first time a Yankee warship
has been hit by a German submarine's most effective
weapon. It will not be the last
Complacency, is one of the greatest faults of the
American people. Before last April the nation dozed
in its own inimitable way; slept late of a busy morning
and woke to find the housebreaker on the stairs. Ameri
ca's army, by many, was considered all sufficient for any
contingency. Even people living on the Arizona border.
harassed as it has been for nearly seven years, consider
ed the affair a side-show and did not attempt to seek the
solution.
Such complacency has been largely done away with
by the American people. But a full realization of the
great task at hand has not struck home.
well, I see an American ship was torpedoed, says
a blandly innocuous individual to his neighbor. "Too bad.
ain't itr
Tes, it is too bad. It is terrible. And the most terri
ble part of the whole thing is the failure of the American
people to realize that this is not a sham battle, that
the United States is not dealing with a pompous Central
American republic. America is destined to count its
sacrifices on the altar of freedom in thousands. When
the casualty lists begin, involving every state from Maine
to California, and from Michigan td Arizona .then and
only then will the mas3 of America come to the stern
realization that there is work to be done.
The first hit is merely indicative of what will follow.
America, the favored son of the world, must take its
medicine. It is necessary and will cleanse the ulcerous
growth of Prussianism from the face of the earth. One
thing is necessary, however. America must learn to
suffer.
THE PATRIOTIC LOBSTER.
Broadway's apprehension as to the future of its lobster
palaces under a policy of food conservation in war-time
is relieved by the news from Washington of their official
indorsement. Not only is there to be no interference
with their activities but they are to be encouraged on the
theory that the consumption of luxurious food will tend
to conserve necessary food.
From being temples of gluttony, the lobster-houses
and supper-rooms are now recognized as a national asset
fn conservation, a first-line food defense in war! It is a
curious example of the reappraisal of economic values. So.
on with the consumption of lobster a la Newburg, crab-
flake mayonnaise and "terrapin in individual chafing-
dishes !" The more trencher work of this kind after the
play and in the small hours the more beef and mutton
will be left for a populace oppressed by the high cost of
war-time living. '
No doubt the theory is a sound one. New York's "ap
ply of lobster, salmon and canvas-back and venison and of
the birds that go with small bottles is always ample. Anil
If to consume it will effect the conservation of an equal
amount of plain food, Broadway may be expected to un
dertake the patriotic service with zest. It may be count
ed on to "do its bit" without conscription. But what a
moral transformation is made by war in a process which
was rated in days of excise reform as puzzling and
gormandizing! New York World.

One of the most interesting and re
markable statements yet made in con
nection with Tanlac, the medicine that
is accomplishing such surprising and
gratifying results, was given by Mrs.
Martha Allen when the Tanlac repre
sentative called by special invitation
at her residence, 1820 NorOi Pearl
street, Dallas, recently. In relating
her experience with Tanlac, Mrs. Al
len said:
"When I began taking Tanlac last
July a year ago, I had been suffering
: for some time with an attack of rheu
matism which involved both my lower
limbs and feet. The pain was so in
tense I just can't describe it, I could
scarcely walk and had just to hobble
around. I was ex:remely nervous and
suffered so I could hardly sleep at all
and many a night I would roll and tum
ble all night long. Liniment and med
icines failed to do me any good, I lost
flesh until I weighed only a little more
than a hundred pounds and suffered
almost continually.
"I then bought Tanlac, as I had
been reading abVmt it for some time,
and after taking a few bottles regular
ly, every sign of the rheumatism left
me. Tanlac not only restored my
health, but when I weighed I was de
lighted to find that I had gained thirty-three
pounds which put me back to
my regular weight. That was a year
and a half ago and I have been perfect
ly sound and well ever since until this
past January whea I had an attack of
groppe. I lost my appetite, became
very nervous and also fell off some in
weight.
"Well, I bought Tanlac again and af
ter using it a few days, my grippe, in
digestion and nervousness were all
gbne and I also regained the little
weight I had lost. I eat anything I
want now, I can enjoy a large steak
without it hurting me a particle and I
don't suffer from the gas or any other
bad feelings after my meals. - I sleep
fine and restful and I believe I feel
better now than I have ever felt. I
will always praise Tanlac, and why
shouldn't I? I tried everything else
and found no relief until I took it and
my case shows Tanlac not only brings
relief but its work is lasting. Now, I
don't like publicity, but I feel that I
am 'only doing my duty to suffering
humanity in making this statement, j
My phone number is Main 3089 and it
anyone will call me, I will take pleas
ore in telling them about what a grand
medicine I have found Tanlac to be
and the good health I have enjoyed ev
er since I took it."

Ball, in Douglas by Douglas Drug Co.,
in Paradise by G. A: Walker, in Bowie

J. B. Cooke, and in Wilcox by A. A.

MUCH ENCOURAGEMENT
GIVEN NEWSBOYS IN
SUBSCRIPTION GAME
Bargain Offer of The Review
is Meeting With Success
Throughout the Warren
District
People in this district who have not
heretofore been subscribers to the Re
view are offering great encouragement
to the contestants for the Review cash
prizes. These prizes, ranging down
from the grand prize of $50, are a re
ward for which the boys are eagerjy
striving. They get credit for new sub
scribers only. As a special offer, the
Review will be delivered to new sub
scribers for three months on the pay
ment of $2.
The boys not only have a chance at
the $50, but each boy gets an attrac
tive percentage of all money collected,
forming no small item in itself.
However, all those subscribing be
tween now and the 26th will practical
ly do a double service to the contest
ants. For on October 26 Al G. Barnes'
circus "arrives in town." It's the flrst
circus that has been in Bisbee for a
year. It is predicted that all the pent
up longing of circus lovers will break
forth on this one glorious day.
And of all circus lovers the small
boy is supreme. He is always there
usually making his entrance by a dif
ferent but equally efficient method
than the main portal. .
But because of their enviable and
important positions, the paper boys
employed by the Review will be es
corted in state through the main en
trance, and will se the whole show
from one end to the other. But even
then, they will need spending money,
and then some.
On this account . all commissions
earned up to noon a week from today
will be paid to the lads in cash, in
stead of postponing payment until thJ
end of the contest.
Again that wise injunction, "Do it
NOW."

The following communication was

The boys of Battery ','C" had a heat
ed debate last night and were still in
the midst of it when "lights out" was
sounded. Subject, "Why is a cigar".
Lefty t'Jok the negative and had a
down hill pull all the way through,
however it is to be continued tonight
after retreat
"Lefty" Wilson says while it's true
that he is no first-gunner yet, he won
ders why the top-sergeant always
"picks" on him when there is any
"snipe shooting" to be done around the
barracks. He says "dern if I see
where they get 'em have not seen a
smoke since I left good ld Bisbee if
I only had one of those common gar
den variety. Manila-de-ropos, would
poke out my chest and make the can
tain appear like a scare-crow." And
the boys don't ti'jubt it in the least.
Karl Lippert is not saying a dickens
of a lot but he's not crazy over his
bunk. Accused his "bunkie" of steal
ing his lone feather from his mattress
last night Got peeved the other day
when the lieutenant made him take the
"rope" from his mouth when standing
reveille. He had been thinking very
seriously all last week of taking a
shave, but since has decided to wait
till after pay day. We all hope that
that day slAiws up soon.
"Shorty" Waite was bawled out the
first day for talking to the captain and
all he said was, "Say Capt you sure
have plenty of grass-hoppers down
here, have you got the makings?" We
don't see much of Shorty in drill but
we know he's there on account of his
tenor voice.
"Tex" Beemer's right arm is jn the
blink from saluting officers and every
other thing on two legs his sole am
bition is to be assigned corporal so
when some of the phifters show up
later, he can tell 'em where to head in.
He is making the best of it and main
tains that "It's an ill wind that blows
nobody's skirts." We have n guns
here at present but we can shoot with
out 'em one of the boys said last
night, that he could shoot seven, right
along and he is not kidding either.
Going to Jiave practice in gas attacks
tomorrow, but let 'er gv, most of us are
used to it got plenty in the stopes.
John Jeurk says, Sherman was right,
lie accused Barrett of stealing his gar

latter never uses them.

From Washington city to Washington

AN Olt OPPORTUNITY
MILLIONS IN OIL
The newspapers of the land are filled
with stories of fortunes made from small
investments in piclahoma oil. Just rt
:ently one oil company owning properties
in Oklahoma paid a cash dividend of $6,
000,000. Just a few weeks ago one of
the big producing companies of Oklahoma
sold its properties for $12,000,000 cash.
The McFarlands and the Chapmans went
into the oil business a few years ago with
a few hundred dollars capital. Now their
properties are conservatively valued at
$25,000,000. Ten years ago H. F. Sin
clair was a drug clerk in a small Kansas
town. Now he is at the head of a $70,
000,000 oil corporation and his personal
wealth is estimated to be from $7,000,000
to $10,000,000.-
A year or so ago a few men were given
an opportunity to get in on the ground
floor organization of the Coline Oil Com
pany. The property of the Coline Com
pany was sold a few months ago at a price
which netted $3,000 cash to each man
who had invested $175 only a little more
than a year previous.
One well in Oklahoma is reported to
have made it owner, Frank A. Gillespie,
almost a million dollars in 60 days. One
80-acre lease in the Stone Bluff pool of
Oklahoma is said to have netted its ownei
$ 1 ,000,000 in five months.
A Kansas City man is said to have in
vested $250 in purchasing shares in an
Oklahoma oil company for which he re
ceived $20,000 in cash within a year after
his investment.
Another investor put $300 into a small
oil lease proposition and cleared $10,000
in eight months.
The above items are taken from various
newspaper reports but we not only be
lieve that these reports are absolutely true,
but we believe there are hundreds and
thousands of other stories that might be
related where enormous profits have been
quickly realized from small investments
in Oklahoma oil.
ENORMOUS PROFITS
The Apple & Franklin Oil Co., which
owns a lease of 100 acres in section 9-4-3
has sold to the Sinclair Oil & Gas Co., at .
$600. The gauge has been completed and
the production is near the 600 barrel mark.
On account of shrinkage, due it is alleged
to cold weather, a small matter between
the sellers and buyers must be compromis
ed before the money is paid over. S. A.
Apple, Wirt Franklin and J. W. Rarreld
paid $25 for the lease. They have sdld
enough oil to pay all operating expenses
and when they have received their money
they will have made a greater percentage
of profit than probably any other com
pany at Healdton. For each dollar invest
ed they are taking out in clear profit more
than $10,000 Oil & Gas Journal, Nov
30, 1916.
One Oklahoma City oil company sold
an oil lease on 400 acres for ONE MIL
LION DOLARS CASH. Another com
pany here has paid 500r cash dividends
in 44 months. We have leases in 1 2 dif
ferent counties in Oklahoma. We have
leases in counties which already have
hundreds of oil wells. We are going to
drill for oil. We have reason to believe
we will get oil.
Mr. Wm. Dunn, living in Oklahoma,
called at our office and after investigating
our proposition bought 4,000 shares.
A FLYER IN OIL
Thousands of men today count their
wealth, from a competence up into the
millions, as the result of perhaps only a
modest "flyci" in oil. They were the for
tunate one who got in on good proposi
tions rifjht at the beginning of their ex
perience in oil or were able to "stay with
the game" until they did hit it big.

at the birth of the town twenty - eight

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, OCTOBER 19, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
Y AEVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Oct. 18. Stocks moved
forward in a convincing fashion to
day despite further weakness shown
by isolated issues, notably coppers.
Much of the activity centered
around the war group.- particularly
steels at extreme gains of 2 to 7
points.
The advance was materially aided
not only hv extensive short covering,
but also by heavy buying from com
mission houses, which were reported
t obe acting for western interests.
There were vague rumors of early
developments at Washington which,
are expected to rebound to the ad
vantage of several of the munitions
companies now fulfilling large .con
tracts for the home government and
its allies.
Rails shared in the rise, though less
substantially than industrials and
eouipments.
Low grade or reorganized transpor
tation issues were more prominent
than usual.
United States Steel did not get into
the general stride until the latter part
of the session, when it rose to 105,
and closed at 104, a net gain of
2 points. Bethlehem Steels were
next in favor, the new stock rising 7
to 804 on a very large turnover and
the old issue advancing 6 to 80.
. Utah Copper's further decline to
774. with a later recovery, acted as
a drag on the metals, but shippings,
tobacco, oils, motors and sugars reg
istered net advances of 2 to 5 points.
Motors and sugars registered net
advances of f. to 5 points.
Total sales amounted to 780,000
shares.
Bonds were Irregular on lighter of
ferings. Liberty bonds VA's changing
hands at 99.70 to 99.74. Total sales,
par value, were $4,525,000.
United States bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call, coupon 3's
losing 1 per cent on one sale'.
GRAIN, MARKET.
CHICAGO. Oct. 18. Bullish con
struction put on announcement from
the food administrator' touching corn
and hog values rallied the corn" and
provisions markets today afteV early
declines. Corn closed firm,10-4
5-8 net higher, with December
115 to 115. and May 11 to 111',.
Oats gained i to . Tha
finish in provisions ranged from 52c
setback to a rise of 15c.
Predictions of a cold wave tonight
were chiefly responsible for tempora
ry downturns, which corn prices un
derwent. The low temperatures prom
ised .seemed to imply that the crop
would be more quickly put into good
condition for shipment than was like
ly in the event of a continuance of
moist, warm weather. When atten
tion was directed to statements of the
food administrator denying that gov
ernment officials were planning a re
duction of hog values to 110 a hun
dredweight corn began to ascend. The
main reason appeared to be that the
untrue reports of a $10 standard for
hogs had been coupled with talk of
an accompanying probable slash of
corn prices to Jl a bushel.
Export demand lifted oats.
Sharp declines in the hog market
weakened provisions at first. Later
demand broadened from packers and
seaboard interests influenced appar
ently by the published views of the
food administrator.

SUPERVISORS TO MEET ! SHE'S A DOG-GONE
TO SET DATE FOR
BOND ELECTION
Chairman Vance Johnson of the
board of supervisors yesterday slated
I the board of supervisors would meet
! on October 29th for the special purpose
of ordering an election for the propos
ed road bond issue in this county. It
is now agreed that the election will
be called for December 4th v.liich date j
comes on Tuesday.
road commissi appointed under thel
law in connection with the bond issue.
accompanied by the county engineer,
made a tour of the county for the pur
pose of deciding on what road work
should be done with the money to be
authorized if the election results in
favor of road improvement.
The first and niost pressing work
found to be necessary, in the opinion
of all who went on this trip was the
paving of the road between Bisbee and
Douglas. It was a greed that the
road from Willcox to Pearce and
Courtland should be put in substantial
condition. A road will also be built
from Pearce to connect with the cen-
tral highway going north through the
Sulphur Springs valley. This will'
give the citizen coming south from the
north end of the county the option of )
turning at Uearce either to Bisbee or
Douglas, or Tombstone. The bond
money is also expected to be utilized
in putting the road from Tombstone
to Benson and on the Pima county
line in excellent condition.

The proposition carried before the
people at the December election will
be for the issuance of one million dol
lars in bonds and with this amount it
is expected that Cochise county will
be provided with better roads than any
other county in the state.
After the election. If it endorses the
issue then the bonds will be offered
for sale. After that the work will
start and be hurried to completion as
fast as possible.

Poisonous matter clogged in the in
