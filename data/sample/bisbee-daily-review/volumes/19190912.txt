There were cries of "you are right,

should immediately be brought back
from Russia. He was frequently in

When he asked the crowd if It

ENGLE POST OF AMERICAN LEGION
TO CELEBRATE ARMISTICE DAY
At the executive meeting of L. A.
Engle Post of the American Legion
held Wednesday evening, several
committees were appointed and plans
laid for a celebration to be held un
der the auspices of the local post on
November 11 to commemorate the
signing of the armistice. A real big
time ' cslebration is to be put over
by the post' and plans are to be ma
tured in the next few weeks. It is
hoped to make this a yearly affair.
Another committee was appointed
to be known as the athletic commit
tee of the post. Football, baseball and
allied sports are to come under their
jurisdiction and it is hoped that a
keen interest and competition can be
arranged between the various teams
made up from the local members of
the post.
A big membership drive is to be
inaugurated commencing at the next
meeting there are a score of new

ARSHIRflM JOHNSON
TIE H.C.L,
Senator. Johnson declared that if
responsibility for the high cost of
living rests upon any agency or man,
it rests upon the present national ad
ministration and Woodrow Wilson.
"President Wilson adds to his
fearsome harsh names, appeals to
our material interests, and even
taxes the two months that the league
and treaty have been before the
American people and senate with the
high cost of living," said Senator
Johnson. "He conveniently iorgets

fect the high cost of living. If any
single individual can be charged with
resDonsibility for the high cost of
living that man is Woodrow Wilson
The living costs in December and
January last were substantially what
thev are today. Mr. Wilson then had
exactly the same laws he now in
vokes. He had neither time nor in-
clinitation to deal with a problem
then practically as acute as it is now.
He never even touched the subject,
except patronizingly and as an
aphemeral ill of no consequence or
importance. He makes its solution
depend now upon the immediate rati
fication of his treaty. He would
frighten us by a cheap and specious
statement, devoid of economic logic.

military district. Ten military police
men took Sudenberg to his corner af
ter the attack on the referee.
Fight fans in Bisbee yesterday were
of the opinion that the attempted sup
pression of full publicity regarding

point out that clean sport is wanted,
and that expose of such lack of sports

less sportsmanlike managers or pro

Canion Co. Is Still Solvent
and With Good Prospects
Rumors that the Canion Air
Brake company of Baltimore had
gone upon the rocks were denied
by local stockholders yesterday and
a partial explanation made. Mem
bers of a committee to represent
the local Investors recently return
ed from Baltimore where, after a
complete investigation, they claim
to have found the company a little
worse for wear, but still solvent.
O. W. Wolf, who, with Howard
Barkell and George Bunker, made
the Baltimore trip, express them
selves as satisfied with the general
outlook for the future stability of
the company. According to Wolf,
who was appointed chairman of the
committee, records of the Canion
Air Brake company were thorough
ly gone over by thai Bisbee men
It was discovered that outside of
the fact that the concern was a
little wobbly on its legs, there was
noting to indicate that It would
ground on the rocks of financial
disaster.
In the main offices the commit
tee were shown letters from prom
inent railroad men which highly
recommended the air brake. Other
railroad men who had investigated
the brake were personally inter
viewed and, according to the com
mittee, state, that no better valve
air brake invention has been plac
ed on the market.
During the last 18 months the
company has raised $40,000, a great
amount of which came from this
section of the country. This en

SIGN TREATY,
SENATE URGED
I MINORITY
Administration Supporters on
Foreign Relations Committee
See Huns Restored to Power
If Treaty Is Mot Ratified
WASHINGTON, 'Sept. 11. With
submission of the foreign relations
committee minority report, the peace
treaty, with its covenant for a league
of nations, was made ready today
for the ratification battle to be waged
about it in the senate. By general
agreement this will not begin until
Monday- Meanwhile however, Re
publicans, claiming enough votes to
prevent ratification without reserva
tions, were urged by Chairman Lodge
of the foreign relations committee to
stay on the job until final disposi
tion is made of the treaty, weeks
hence perhaps.
With as little formality as that at
tending the presentation yesterday
of the majority report. Senator
Hitchcock, leader of the administra
tion forces, today submitted the
minority report signed by all Demo
cratic members of the committee ex
cept Senator Shields of Tennessee,
who stood out for reservations.
Without attempting specifically to
answer majority charges against cer
tain provisions of the covenant as
brought back from Paris by Presi
dent Wilson, the minority urged
speedy adoption without modification
or in precisely the form laid before
the senate two months ago. Rejec
tion or change, the report declared,
meant loss to this country of all
concessions obtained from the enemy
by a dictated peace, including Ger
many's acknowledgement of respons
ibility for the war.
The report declared that Germany,
once having signed the treaty,
might not be disposed to sign it
again.
The minority at the outset charged
that the treaty could have been re
ported out long a go . by the commit
tee, which was trying to destroy it
by reservations. No reference was
made to Republican attacks on the
award of Shantung province to
Japan or the inequality of the voting
power in the league for the United
States as compared with Great Eri-
tain. The report set forth a defense
and explanation of the league cove
nant, described as the best hope of
the world, "even if like all human
instumentalities it be not divinely
perfect in every detail."
Deploring delay to which the docu
ment had been subjected, the report
asserted that the industrial world
was in ferment, the financial world in
doubt and this was caused "by the
majority of a committee known to be
out of harmony with the majority of
the senate and the majority of the
people."
Formal reporting of majority and
minority views waa of secondary in
terest, however, to continuation of
private conferences by Republicans
in efforts to agree npon a comprom
ise reservation program. Senators
active in the negotiations said com
plete agreement was near one
which would insure support of all 49
Republicans and probably a number
of Democrats. This program does not
contemplate formal or informal an
nouncement of a compromise in the
near future and probably will not
until the close of discussion of the
treaty, when reservations will be In
order.
That the valiant stand made by
the United States marines in the
Chateau Thierry sector in June. 1918,
marked the turning point in the war,
was the declaration of Capt. C. Z.
Lescher, University of Arizona grad
uate, who spoke at the Warren Dis
trict Luncheon club meeting yester
day noon. Up until this time the
Germans were the aggressors, the
speaker said, but when the Hun
hordes were turned back by the army
that had never been taught the mean
ing of retreat, the tide of battle
changed and from then until the end
of the war the allies took the bit in
their teeth and remained on the of
fensive. Many interesting stories of the
great war were told by Captain
Lescher. In one battle his company
entered with 185 men and when the
Germans had been driven back, all
but 13 had giveu the supreme sacri
fice. Captain Lescher emphasized the
fact that with the war over America
still has a great work ahead in
stamping out the Bolshevism, which
is first cousin to the I. W. W. element".

lEfflFPOLICY
Oil King Doheney Admits He
Paid Tribute to Rebel Chief
But Says Was Told to Do
So By Wilson Lieutenants
WASHINGTON, Sept. 11. The ro
mance of the Mexican oil fields, to
gether with vicissitudes of the' oil
prospectors resulting from bandit at-
tacKs ana obnoxious decrees and
laws or me uarranza government,
was aescrmed today to the senate
foreign relations' sub-committee in
vestigating the Mexican situation by
is.. Lt. uoneney, head of the Mexican
Petroleum company, limited.
Incidentally, the committee was
told that Dr. Henry Alleri Tupper,
now pastor of the First Baptist'
cnurcn or Washington, D. C, former
ly active in obtaining recognition for
the Carranza government by the
United States, had received a draft
for $3,466 from the treasurer general
of Mexico. It was indicated that the
committee would call Dr. Tupper to
explain for what the draft was in
payment.
Wilson Advisors .Suggested Tribute
In the course of his description of
the development of the Mexican oil
fields, largely by American capital,
Mr. Doheney admitted his company
had paid Manuel Palaez, the rebel
leader, for protection, but declared
that the payment was made on the
advice of Eliseo Arrendondo and also
that the course was in line with sug
gestions of John Lind and J. R. Silli
man, personal representatives of
President Wilson in Mexico.
To the charge of Finance Minister
Cabrera of the Mexican cabinet, that-.
his company was fostering rebellion
by furnishing arms and ammunition
to Palaez, Doheney submitted a
memorandum addressed to the Amer
ican state department declaring that
Lind and Silliman had advised pay
ment of taxes to whichever faction
happened to be . in control, but denied
that munitions were ever furnished
Palaez. .
Carranza Paid For Support. Hinted
Doheney had completed his testi
mony, which had taken almost two
days to give, when Senator Fall ask
ed him if he ever had known of any
of those who had been active in their
work in behalf of Carranza receiving
any remuneration. His answer was
the presentation of a draft which had
been made out by the Huasteca Pe
troleum company in favor of the
treasurer general of Mexico, and by
him made payable to the order of
Dr. Tupper for "value received."
After payment the check found its
way back to the Huasteca company.
Mr. Doheney did not pretend to
know the nature of the indicated
"value" of Dr. Tupper's work for
Carranza and his government but in
timated it was done as the agent of
the "national peace forum."
PLANT WILD TURKEY
PHOENIX, Ariz.. Sept. 11. The
state game warden, Joe V. Prochas
ka, has received seven young wild
turkeys from the White mountains,
and is expecting a large shipment of
mature birds trapped in the White
mountains. '
They are to be planted in the Cata
lina and other' southern mountains so
that in a few years wild turkey hunt
ing will be available to the sports,
men of that district.

President Makes Skillful Local Appeal on Montana Soil, Bring
ing Up Subject of Labor Unrest for First Time in His Trip
Across the Continent and Winding Up -By Offering the
Usual Panacea of Unqualified Nation League Acceptance
HELENA, Mont., Sept. 11. In two
addresses in Montana today Presi
dent Wilson asked that the peace
treaty be ratified without delay so
that the spirit of universal unrest
spreading from Russia may be quiet
ed. Saying he had been told, the west
was pervaded by "what Is called
radicalism," the president declared
the only way to keep men from ag
itating against grievances was to
remove the grievances. As long as
"things are wrong," he said, he did
not intend to ask that men stop ag
itating, begging only that they use
orderly methods.
He said radicalism meant "cut
ting up by the roots" a process that
would be rendered unnecessary if
"noxious growths were removed."
When the president was intro
duced by Governor Sam Stuart at
his night address here, the crowd
stood up and cheered.
Task of Fighters But Half Done
With all its complexities, Mr. Wil
son said, the Issue after all was
whether the sacrifices of the war
would be in vain. The task of
those who fought was only half done
he declared, for if the treaty were
not put into effect, "men like these
will have to die again."
The United States, said the pres
ident, "did not go Into this war
willingly and the nation had tried
to convince itself that the Euro
pean business was not our business."
"But presently," he continued, "it
became apparent that civilization it
self. "We fought. Germany," he con
tinued, "that the world might be a
fit place to live in. And the world
will not be a fit place to live in as
long as any great power can do
what Germany did."
U. S. Guilty of Net War
Under the league, asserted Mr.
Wilson, there would be no opportuni
ty for a people to be thrown into
war without their consent. But if
the league failed, he declared, the
United States would be deliberately
guilty "of preparing a situation that
would bring on the final war."
- That the United . States should be
"trustee for the peace of the world"
the president declared, was inevita
ble. Development of American pow
er had ben viewed with dismay, he
said, until it was seen that she ful
filled her pledge to Cuba. Then the
world knew, he added, that it could
repose its confidence In the United
States.
Differs With William Allen White
This confidence, said Mr. Wilson,
has been shown in the fullest meas
ure at Versailles and in consequence
the pease had been drawn on Amer
ican specifications.
Declaring the treaty could not be
carried out without the league, the
president cited the territorial ad
justments of mid-Europe as an ex
ample of the sort of tasks which he
asserted only a concert of nations
could
accomplish. The league was

MIAMI. Fla., Sept 11. Nine survi

Bahama channel Tuesday morning
during the hurricane, were brought
top ort today in a weakened condition
from being buffeted in a life boat by

Shortly after the survivors of the
Corydon landed, an unverified report
was received that the British auvil
iary schooner Mystwry J. was sunk
and the 19 persons on board perished
near Bimini .an island off the Baha
ma group. The vessel, commanded by
Captain Allan I. Jotuson, left here
to be the last instrumentality, he
said, "by which the goods are to be
delivered to the people to whom thev
belong." in territories of disputed
sovereignty.
The league, too, would be a step
toward world democracy, the presi
dent said, because for the first time
it would place the small and weak
nations on a footing of equality with
the great and powerful.
BISBEE PLEDGE
SENT EL PASO
So confident are the members of
the Warren District Automobile club

last night's meeting, automobile men
of Bisbee will be naested to take
the initiative in raising the prize

have the money in the hands of the
committee before October 20, it was
suggested that the subscription com
mittee start work immediately and a
meeting to appoint teams for this pur
pose was called for next Tuesday
night at the Commercial club.
R. H. Rhinehardt of El Paso, will
leave that city next week tq select a
route for the 500 mile race. If the
various cities suggested agree to raise
$1000 the route will be as follows:
El Paso to Rodeo, thence to Douglas
Florence and Phoenix.
Dr. N. C. Bledsoe has been request

Like the lillies of the field.- they
toil not, neither do they spin, yet
the leisure class of Bisbee seem to
nave fallen unto evil days in their
carefree and non-working existence
during the last week. The second
"idler" to have his carefree exist
ence curbed and to be relegated from
his sinecure by the assistance of the
local police from living off the fat of
the land at the expense of the Tel
low workers" was one C. E. Miitfon,
who was found guilty ot vagrancy
by Tolice Judge -Hdgan yesterday!
morning.
"Vag" Minton talked himself into
the charge of guilty through his at
tempts to be humorous, without the
extra help of his score of witnesses
who seemed to disagree as to just
What Minton did for a living when
called upon by Minton totestify in his
behalf.

That competition between the var
ious I. W.' W. organizers. Socialist
moor parties and other kindred aa
sociatibns is keen was shown by Min

he quit workine for the T w to
a few months ago was because he
nna tney could not agree on just how
.much he should retain as his share
from the money collected. Then
came along the S. L. P. with the
highest bid so Minton has been with
them ever since. He testified , that
the present party which . he repre
sented did not pay any benefits but
that all the money he could obtain
from new "suckers" he got a cut on.
The "vag" .then further testified
that he was for confiscation by the
government of all li les of business,
that he believed as all good I. W. W.
that there was nothi ne in rommnn
between the. employers and the em-

THEY H TO
END FOR
HER ITHEB
Mrs. Gist Suffered Complete Break
down Gains 33 Pounds taking
Tanlac.
"When I began taking Tanlac I
weighed Just one .hundred' pounds,
and after finishing four bottles of
this medicine I now weigh one
hundred and thirty-three," said Mrs.
Myrtle L. Gist, residing at 326
Chestnut Ave., South Pasadena, Los
Angeles, Cal. Mrs. Gist is the wife
of a well known member of the
Los Angeles police force, and her
improvement since taking Tanlac
has created a good , deal of favor
able comment among her neigh
bors and friends.
But making me gain thirty-three
pounds isn t all Tanlac did for me,'
continued Mrs. Gist, as she told of
the wonderful change. "I had been
in a dreadfully run down condi
tion for three years and finally suf
fered a complete physical break
down. I had not appetite and the
little I ate didn't agree with me.
I was so dreadfully nervous I could
get no restful sleep and would oft
en lie awake all night long wor
rying over my condition. Practic
ally all my strength left me and
I lost weight until I was almost a
shadow.
My condition finally got so bad
they sent for my mother in Ore
gon to come here and stay with
me and when she got -here I was
down. I had no appetite and the
my head from the pillow. Mother
said she had several friends in
Oregon who had taken Tanlac with
wonderful results and she got me
a bottle of the . medicine. It seem
ed to nelp me from the very" start
and In a few days I started to get
hungry. Then I began eating nour
ishing food and could feel my
strength returning. I began to
sleep soundly and would wake up
in the mornings feeling rested and
refreshed and I soon was able to
walk about the house. I improved
every day and now I feel simply
fine, have a splendid appetite and
can eat just anything I want and
enjoy it without any bad after ef
fects. As I said before, I have
actually gained thirty-three pounds
and for the first time in many
months I am able to do my own
housework without any trouble. I
now feel so happy over my won
derful improvement that I just get
out in the yard with my two chil
dren and romp and play with them
and enjoy it thoroughly. I will
never- cease praising Tanlac for
the wonderful change it has
brought in my life."

WILSON LOSING GROUND
THE PRESIDENT went upon his speaking tour to win the West
for the convenant of the League of Nations. He was coldly re
ceived at Columbus. At Indianapolis the audience warmed up
to him a trifle. At St. Louis his hearers showed a touch of en
thusiasm. But his friend and political champion, David Lawrence,
writes that the welcome to the President in these American cities did
not begin to approach that which he received in Great Britain,
France and Italy. ,
But even assuming that he is- making converts along the way he
is losing them in the United States Senate. It is evident that the
Senators are not greatly impressed with the results of the trip thus
far if their attitude upon the treaty is any criterion. While Presi
dent Wilson was appealing to Ohioans to get behind him, Senator
Shields, a Democrat from Tennessee and a member of the foreign
relations committee, deserted his banner and announced his inten
tion to vote for the resolution of ratification with reservations
framed .by the Republican majority. Let the New York World, the
President's most ardent champion in the East, tell the effect of this
decision upon his colleagues in the committee:
"The action of Senator Shields In co-operating with the
Republicans occasioned the chief sensation, of the committee
meeting and caused excitement throughout the Senate.
The situation became dramatic when Senator Shields arose
and referred to his statement to the people of Tennessee an
nouncing that he inclined to the belief that some reserva
tions must be adopted. He declared that the emphatic con
clusion had been reached by him that the treaty must not be
ratified without appropriate reservations.. He desired, he
Baid, to supplement his Tennessee statement by saying he
would vote not only in committee for three of the pending
resolutions, but also on the floor of the Senate."
The World correspondent goes on to state how Senator Williams,
who is somewhat hard of hearing, placed his hand to his ear and
listened to the senator from Tennessee until he got the drift of the
remarks, "when he turned his back upon him and did not again
glance in his direction." Republican members of the committee, were
"delighted" and "their jubilation knew no bounds." "They ap
plauded his course and welcomed him to the fellowship of those
who oppose the treaty."
It is now admitted that the addition of Shields to the Republican
fold makes five of the number of Democrats who are classed as co
operating with the Republicans in their efforts to obtain reserva
tions. The other four are Reed of Missouri, where J.he President
spoke yesterday and today, Gore of Oklahoma, Thomas of Colorado
and Walsh of Massachusetts. And the prospect is that this number
will be materially increased before the President gets back to Wash
ington. All cf which would seem to indicate that the "swing around
the circle" of Mr. Wilson is not netting him votes in the United
States Senate for his peace pact as he thinks it ought to be ratified.
i Buffalo Commercial.
THE SAEM OLD GERMAN HONOR
THE GERMAN government has made a fine show of dismay
and indignation over the "sabotaging" of the Zeppelin fleet
which, according to the peace agreement, was to be turned
over to 'the allies. It denies all responsibility for the ac
tion of the naval officers in charge of the airship by those whose
orders they were wrecked.
Very likely that officer will be slapped on the wrist, metaphor
ically speaking. He will be officially lectured, and the lecture put
on record for the benefit of t,he wronged allies Whether or not he
will receive thereafter some surrptious reward, it is, of course, im
possible for a mere American to say.
At any rate, here we have precisely the same situation as that at
Scapa Flow. The destruction of the baby-killing Zeppelins was a
less costly and less spectacular feat than the scuttling of the sea
flviet by the German officers in charge of them, but in principle it
is just as reprehensive from the standpoint of normal decency and
honor. In each case German officers betrayed their trust and did,
in the name of their country, what they and their country alike were
bound in honor not to do. And whether or not the government
authorities had, technically, anything to do with either offense, it i
plain that the government has condoned both and the German pub
lic applauded both.
"German honor," once respected, was sadly dragged through
the mire by German conduct during the war. Is there to be no re
novation of it in time of peace?
COOL TO THE PRESIDENT
THE COOLNESS of the reception to the President in Kansas
City Saturday was in marked contrast to the welcome he
received on his "preparedness" tour before the war. The
sidewalks were not thronged in the usual way and the lack
of applause was noticeable. Convention Hall was tilled, as it al
ways is on such an occasion. But the audience was polite and re
spectful, not demonstrative. ,
It is not recalled that any President within a generation has re
coived so mild a greeting to speak conservatively as Mr. Wilson.
The reason is apparent. The people in this part of the country
do not look with favor on the proposal to bring America into all the
quarrels of Europe and Asia. The freedom of action which their
fathers handed down to them they propose to hand down to their
children. Sentiment here has set strongly against the League of
Nations. Kansas City Star.
The outward movement of gold, say experts, will help reduce
the cost of living. We haven't seen any gold In a long time, but
the outward movement of silver and greenbacks from our pockets
doesn't seem to bring any such happy result.
Upwards of 325.000 members of the United Brotherhood of

Doctors, lawyeis and editors are barred from "the coming revo

OR SCHOOLS STAY CLOSED
Phoenix, Sept. 11. Unless a large

in Arizona from parts unknown
there are going to be several
schools in Arizona at the start of
the coining season minus instruc

state superintendent of instruction,
especially applies to country
schools.
It was stated at Mr. Case's of
fice yesterday that calls had been
made from practically every coun
ty in the state for teachers for
rural schools. Several of the re
quests for teachers stated that un
less instructors were secured short

Mr. Case said yesterday that if
there are any teachers in the city
who desire positions he could place

CARRANZA MAKING FACES:
New York Times.
From the American point of view
there is a good deal of surplusage in
the ' elaborate address of the Presi
dent to the Mexican Congress, but it
will be viewed with an indulgent
spirit. There are national suscepti
bilities to be smoothed aut, tradi
tional antipathies to be considered.
What is said about Mexico's refusal
to recognize the Monroe Doctrine
would justify the belief that Presi
dent Carranza had not read the orig
inal doctrine and its interpretation

and by Secretaries of State. The
Monroe Doctrine is, incidentally, a
shield to Mexico, not an instrument
of menace. Making faces at it is
amusing.

Hail Quartette and
White Mule Supply
In Raid Upon Park
With a half dozen bottles of
"white mule," containing a kick as
vicious as its namesake and a quan
tity of brass fittings, said to have
been stolen from the Sacramento
hill works, in his possession, Ben
jamin Franklin Faust was arrested
yesterday morning at Midway park
and with three, companions is be
ing held in the Lowell jail with
out bail. .The other three men
gave their names as Emll Nichol
owski, John Doe and Richard Roe.
The arrests were made by Sheriff
Tom Foster on warrants Issued by
Judge Wheeler.
Early yesterday morning Foster
visited Midway park with warrants
calling fpr the arrest of Faust,
Nicholowski and two unidentified
men. That Faust has been freely
dispensing liquor when the proper
password was spoken was well
known to the authorities, accord
ing to Foster, but the recovery of
the brass fittings was unexpected.
Several weeks ago the loss of six
injector valve nozzles, made es
pecially for the steam shovels on
Sacramento hill, was reported to
the Lowell police department. Each
was valued at approximately $150.
The four recovered at Midway park
were yesterday identified as the
Sacramento hill property.

The gossip in sporting circles Is
that Corbett, who has touted Cowler
as a comer In the heavyweight divi
sion had it "framed" for a knockout
by Cowler, but that the smoke re
fused to sign tip to the deal and the
bout was .called off.
Cowler, who has been in scores ot
battles but has not annexed any
thing in the way of a title on the
big time is anxious to come to Bis
bee for a match with some local
heavyweight and has asked Loughrey
to find a good prospect and match
