WASHINGTON, May 16.
In beginning considera
tion today of the $3,390,-
000,000 war budget the sen
ate devoted the entire session
to sweeping criticism of the
executive branch of the gov
ernment. Seldom has the sen

such 1 vehement attacks con
tinued for five hours behind
closed doors and renewed after
the doors were opened.
No progress was made on

WASHINGTON, May 16. Official
confirmation of the withdrawal from
the Russian provisional government of
Foreign Minister Milukoff, following
on the heels of the resignation of War
Minister Guchkoff and three Vf the
highest army generals, failed to
weaken the belief here that Russian
democracy would find a way out.
Proof of the confidence of the Ameri
can government as well as of its de
termination "K lend unstinted aid. was
given today in the form of $100,000,
000 loan to Russia.
Inquiries during the day among both
American and allied officials and dip
lomats, including three officials who
have recently been in Russia, revealed
an almost unanimous opinion that the
etorni now beating will n'jt be fatal,
though its climax probably has no:
been reached.
News received in this country is felt
to be unduly disquieting, because it
all originates from the German-infested
center of Petrograd.
American officials hope that the im
mediate evidence of American aid and
sympathy will steady the more redica,
elements to a practical course.

HUGE SUM PLACED
AT DISPOSAL OF
BELGIUM BY U. S.
(By "Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 16 The Unit
ed States, lent Russia $100,000,000 to
day. The money was lent to be spent
as needed, without stipulated or un
derstanding of any sort further than
that Russia stands back of the obli
gation, will make it good and will
spend the money in thTs country, un
der the supervision of a representa
tive of the treasury department or a
commission to be named by the Am
erican government.
The latter stipulation was made in
a spirit of co-operation without in
tending to embarrass the Russian
government, or to curtail its purchas
ing power, but with the end in view
that Russia will secure the maximum
result top the money she is to spend.
In this respect, Russia stands on
en equal footing with other entente
governments to which the United
States is making loans, the only dis
tinction being that in application of
the program Russia heads the list.

ROOSEVELT MAY TAKE
COMMISSION IN NEW
YORK STATE MILITIA
(By Review Leased Wire).
ALBANY, N. Y.. May 16. At the
conclusion of a two hours' confer
ence today with Governor Whitman,
Colonel Theodore Roosevelt an
nounced that he would accept the
governor s oner of a major general s
commission In the state service if
the federal army bill were passed
without the nrnvisian to Derm It him;
to go to Europe with an expeditionary
force.
After Colonel Roosevelt left town,
Governor Whitman explained that the
state constitution gave him authority
to appoint, without confirmation by
the senate, a major general of the
state militia at any time during a war
emergency when the legislature was
not In session.- The governor was
careful to emphasize that if Mr.
Roosevelt was given a commission as
major general it would not be in the
national guard but In the state mil
itia, which is authorized by both fed
eral and state constitutions.
"I think," said the governor, "that
the offer of a commission as major
general Is the very least that New
York state could make to a man who,
formerly, as governor, was command
er in chief of the state's military or
ganization, who a president, vcom
manded the land and naval forces of
the country, and who, besides. Is a
real soldier."

American torpedo boat destroyers has safely crossed the

The American navy's actual entry into the war zone al
ready has been productive of a brush between a destroyer and
a German under-water boat, according to an announcement
by the British admiralty, but the result of it has not been made
public.
The destroyer squadron arrived in Queenstown after ar
uneventful voyage across the Atlantic, but almost immediate

British Cheer As Tiny
A crowd of several hundred persons,
some of them' carrying tiny American
flags, lined the water front and
cheered the destroyers from the m
ment they fight sighted the flotilla un
til it reached the dock. The crowd
cheered again when, a few minutes
later, the American senior officer
came b shore to greet the British se
nior officer and Wesley Frost, the
American consul, who had come down
to the duck to welcome the flotilla. Ev
erything was done in a simple, business-like
manner. There was an en
tire absence of formality.
"We're Ready Now."
The commander or the British flo-j
tilla was waiting on board his ship
and sent wireless greetings to the
American units s soon as they hove
in sight, steaming in a long line into
the harbor.
After, the exchange of shore greet-
ings and the British commander had
congratulated the American officers
on their safe voyage, he asked:
"When will you be ready for busi
ness?" '
"We can start at once," the Amer
ican commander replied promptly.
This response, so characteristically
American, surprised the British com
mander, who said he had not expectea
the Americans would be ready to begin
work on this side so soon after their
long voyage. Wlen be had recov
ered .from his surprise, he made a
short tour of the destiyers and ad
mitted that the American tars looked
prepared. '
British Impressed.
"Yes," replied the American com
mander, "we made preparations on the
way over. That is why we are ready."
The equipment on board the destroy

It was said by the British of

Winter Wheat Is Making
Good Growth, According
To National Bulletin Issued
Yesterday.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 16. More
seasonable weather conditions dur
ing the week just ended caused
crops to make excellent progress
in the western half of the country,
but in eastern districts extreme
cold was decidedly unfavorable.
The .national weather and crop
bulletin today said t'jaon and coin
end some garden truck were not
only retjrJed but considerably
damaged by the continued cold
, weather. The week was more fa
vorable for farm work, nowever,
and good progress was made in all
sections.
Winter wheat generally is mak
ing good growth except in Okla
homa. Corn is being planted in
much of the atcdoned winter
wheat acreage in N'vjpraska. Spring
wheat is making excellent grow th
in the southern and cential Mates
of the belt end on the Pa:-if;e
coast. Cool weather in central and
eastern" districts was unfuvor-'
able fjr t'orn and in p!uces much ,
will need to be replanted.
In the southern states cutton
was unfavorably affected. and corn
made slow growth.
There -are many reports of in
creased acreage for potatoes.
WILL NOT ATTEST
TO BRING ABOUT A
CENSORSHIP BILL
(Br Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON; May 16. The ad
ministration probably will mal e no
further efforts at present to hae con
gress enact a press censorship law.
r.'or is it expected to in?ist that sen;
ate and house corferees on th espion
age bill will be urged to retain the
censorship provision written into the
meabhire by the house.
For the present, the executive
branch of the .government, it was saioT
tonight, was content Xo- permit t! e
newspapers to continue under the ra:
jlutions voluntarily accepted -by them
governing publication of military in
formation. If there are developments
in the next few months that indicate
that self-imposed restrictions are not
effective and that information of value
to the enemy is being published, the
fight l'jr censorship laws will be re
newed. Many administration officials do not
.believe that such a step will be neces
sary.
If the conferees on the bill acree to
a cen;or.hip section and both houses
approve, there will be no ohjetticn
from the executive: but it was said cn
authority tonight that no pressure is
to be brought to bear to bring aboul
such action.' Conferees on the espion

FOURTH OF.JULY.
Members .of the Warren District Business Men's As
sociation and the Warren District Commercial Clubs are,
already and quite properly, looking forward to the Fourth
of July, 1917. This year, more than any other sine the
memorable occasion in 1898 when this country had sol
diers in the field, should receive the earnest attention of
our people in an effort to commemorate the occasion
fittingly.
Bisbee, annually, entertains thousands of its own peo
ple and many from outside of the Warren District with
its Fourth of July celebration. Under the control of a
centralized committee the occasion has meant much
to the greatest anniversary in American history in this
community. The people have always enjoyed themselves
immensely and the result has been immeasurably good.
This year, we would urge, one of the chief objects of
the committee in charge should be a celebration with
dignity and economy. In the past the principal reason
fcr the success of the celebrations has been tha large
amount of funds secured for the purpose from the local
mining companies., business houses and public spirited
citizens. This year the situation is different and, we
hope, everyone looks forward to the Fourth of July with
something greater, bigger and more important in view.
Unfdrtunately, in the past. Fourth pf July celebrations
have smelled, strongly, of commercialism. With the ex
ception of the committee men, who worked and toiled for
days without pay, nearly all qf the other participants
profited in large or in small part. The same committee
men and citizens of the Warren District are," undoubted
ly, willing to contribute their services this yea and work
to the end that the celebration will be a success. In
view of that it would seem to us that others, who share
the responsibilities of the occasion and who may be held
responsible for its success, should also shoulder their
part.
On the Fourth of July the United States will be cele
brating an occasion which has meant more to democracy
and to liberty than any other event of all history. This
country will also be celebrating another venture, in the
same cause, liberty of thought and action ; the freeing of
an enslaved race and prospective races from an autocracy
which has threatened the safety of the world at larga
for years.
In 177G one of our present allies was our opporessor.
Another of our present comrades-in-arms was our salva
tion. That is past, however, and the feeling then en
gendered has long been forgotten in the splendid actions
of both nations wjth and to the United States of America.
AH of the Entente countries pan well join with Uncle
Sam this year on July 4 all would be celebrating for the
same cause.
There is another thing to be considered,
selection, is to be from 21 to 31 years of age.
It is the duty of every young man leaving high school
this June to prepare himself for the work that will fit
him to serve best the nation, and that will not be accomp
lished by his going directly into industrial service, but
into the universities of the country.
The age of
The average
age of the graduate from the high school is 17 yean'
leaving a period of four years between graduation from
high school and selection for the army. This is just time
enough to complete a .college course and prepare him
self to serve his country to the-best advantage, to train
him for officer's work, to train him for leadership, rather
than for work in the ranks. Leaders are needed in the
present day, and will be more necessary in the next few
years to come.
It is regarded by the national authorities as a seribus
situation, and it is urged that every effort be made to
put the young men into the place where he may be best
trained for the largest possible service.
PREPAREDNESS AND EDUCATION.
Dr. Von Klein Snjid, President of the University of
Arizona, has just returned from the east where he has
been attending a meeting of University presidents, and he
returns with the news that we are facing one of the
greatest crisises in our preparedness and efficiency pro
gram. '
The Federal Department of Education believe that the
colleges of the country will see a dearth of students next
fall, and that the students being graduated from the high
schools this June will not prepare thmselves for the
work that is coming upon them. It will be recalled that
the first demand that our allies made upon us was for
engineers. They could not supply engineers for their
own work, and because of the fact that they had to call
all of their young men to the service, they could not
train engineers. There are practically no engineers be
ing turned out of the colleges of Europe, and it will be up
to the United States to furnish engineers not only for
war times, but for the long period of reconstruction fol
lowing. We hear the cry of more food, and by creating a suffi
cient enthusiasm on this subject, we can in one year
change our conditions, plant more acreage, and meet the
food situation, but we cannot do this without engineers. It
takes several years to train men for this work. If tlio
young men of Hie country do not go into college work,
they are" not going to prepare themselves for the greatest
service that they can render to their country and to the
world. A shorage of engineers tbree-or four years hence
would be a most terious condition.
OUR EAGLE OR WILHELM'S.
One of two birds is to have dust on its back and lose
a great many feathers. It will be the German eagle or
the American eagle. One of the other will be on1ts
back, and it is a bit early in the young life of the Amer
ican eagle for it to wave its talons Impotently and in
defrated defeat, declares the Chicago Tribune.
This eagle has' had some narrow escapes, but it al
sys has been able to scream after the event, and we
think that it has a scream or so remaining for utterance.
We have an idea that the American eagle intends, de
termines, and wills to win.
We cannot think of the United States in the collapse
of defeat Can any reader of this editorial conceive of
the United States paying a great indemnity which would
tax this and other generations because the United States
had been defeated in war?
It does not sound plausible. It does not have the ap-
Dearance of nossibilitr or the aspect of rationality. . We
are not tribute payers. We have had many shameful and
disgraceful experiences, but we hope yet to know what
the yoke Is like.. We have not been dragged at any na
tion's chariot wheel. Nearly every other large nation in
the world's history has known what it is to have the con-
querer come breaking down the gate and demanding pay
ment in lives and money.
We have bad humiliation, but we have not had this
humiliation, and it seems unreasonable that at this pre
cise time, when we are larger, richer, and strongerthan
we ever were before, that we should accept unnecessary
experiences. ...
For such reasons as these we have an idea that the
American nation will not accept defeat, and that it is
not necessary for it to accept defeat.
Wcyhave an idea that the American eagle will be the
bird with strength enough to scream at the end of the
combat The German bird will have to pick itself up out
of the dust.
We know that such an idea would be regarded in Ger
many as preposterous, but we are convinced that it is
as true as the word of God. There can be no defeat for
the American republic. Some day, when it is ivy grown
and crumbling, it may accept the pains of the vanquished
and the taxes of the conquered, but that time has not
come yet, and shall not come for centuries, shall not
be brought about by any breed the human race has pro
duced yet not by a durned sight!. If that be slang,
make the most of it.

WOMEN FOR THE FARMS.
While the cry goes up calling for more war gardens
and urging the farmer to do more this year than ever
before, the farm labor shortage increases in seriousness.
Bureaus organized to supply farm labor have more calls
for workers than they have men and women to fill the
positions.
School boys and college men are gping to the farms in
many places. But the supply still lags far behind the
demand.
Columbia University has sent out a call to its own
women graduates and to any other women who will, to
enter the field of agricultural Service. The woman who
has scientific agricultural knowledge, of course, woul'l
have a large opportunity for usefulness. In directing
groups of unskilled arm laborers. But such women are
rare. It is to the woman with little or no agricultural
knowledge that the appeal is made to do the simpler and
lighter tasks on the farm that will release men for heavier
work. '
Women who know how to handle horses would be par-
iim.i.rh ,.cofni in ririvlnir farm machinery. There are GILA COUNTY CATTLE ;i
calls for women in dairy work, and many opportunitiesjPROSPER EXCEEDINGLY.

PAPAGO INDIANS WILL

When one hundred and seventy-five
applicantions for laborers, made to
the state council of defense several
days ago, were turned down because
of the absence cf such help it was
decided to seek some ot.'ier source
of supply. Accordingly Superintend
ent Sleeker, of tl.e San Carlos reser
vation was asked whether or not he
would aliff" the Indians under his
charge to go to the Salt River Valley
and work on the farms. He decide.!
that, if the pi;y was adeijuato, hi
would allow them to go. There itr -ncarly
S0'. Indians cn the reservation
and it is expected that aiout one

A ntmbcr of Papagoes from the reset -vation
near Tucson have also been
secured for this class of service.
for valuable service in the chicken business.
The school teacher who has three months' vacation
ahead of her might find this just the kind of patriotic
service she can do. Three months on the farm, under
proper conditions, should go far toward sweeping school

HOUSEHOLD ECONOMY
DURING WAR TIMES
(By Review Leased Wire)
BERKELEY. May 16. Miss Ethel
I Moore a member of the California
j State Council of Defense, has issued
I the followins seven suscestions to
, hosewives for fo0)J conservation:
cost. Study food values to learn bow
ta substitute cheaper for more expen
sive foods.
2. Select things which are in sea
son, and therefore favorable In price.
3. Poor preparation reduces food
value. Prepare your food with a view
to getting all of its value on the ta
ble. 4. Don't throw away any good food
that might be used on taking a little
thought.
5. Care for the food that comes in
to the house. Study methods of pre
servation. 6. Eliminate the extravagant ex
pense of delivery to the home. Don't
require delivery of small orders twice
a day.
7. Plan menus to conserve fuel.
For instance, if meat is being cooked
in the gas oven, most of the other
dishes for the meal should be also
baked. Bad construction of oven and
lack of sufficient flow of air through
the gas burners also cause waste.
