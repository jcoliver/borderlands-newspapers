companions on the history-making voy

' speed with which the fog bank spread.
' Naval (officers were somewhat in j
doubt as to Commander Reed's plans
for continuing the flight to Lisbon.
One message from the Columbia at
Horta said the NC-4 would not attempt
to proceed to Ponta Delgada until
tomorrow. A later report from, the
latter place, however, said the weath
ed was clearing shortly after noon and
Commander Reed may have decided to
push on. A delay of five or six hours
in transmission of cable messages
from the Azores left
there in doubt
Eager for Lisbon Start
It was generally believed that Com
mander Reed would start for Lisbon at
his earliest opportunity. Horta to Lis
bon direct would add 150 miles to the
journey, making it possible that the
airship would be forced to make a
landing after dark should it attempt
to catch up tomorrow.
There Is also a possibility that Reed
would delay as long as possible to let
his companions rejoin liiw. They wait
ed for him at Trcpassey and he may
feel bound to take the same course.
But the prime purpose of the whole
trip is to put an American seajjlane

his brother officers will take any ac
tion that might by any chance imperil
that enterprise. Too much effort and
expense has been lavished upon this
effort, officers said, to permit ques
tions of sentiment to endanger it.
The only disturbing feature of the
delay to the NC-3 is the silence of
Towers' boat after the message say
ing she was off her course between
station ship 17 and IS, at 5:15 a. m.,
Washington time. Officers believed,
however, that limited communication
by radio while on the surface and pos
sibly failure to send or to catch an
OS when a landing was decided
upon accounted for this lack of infor
mation as to the XC-3's siuation. :

Something for Dempsey to Look Out for
Jess Willard doesn't boast of his
knockout punches. He just believes
he is so big and powerful that no ordi
nary man can stand up before him
any great length of time.
He confidently expects to dispose
of Jack Dempsey, challenger, and then
go right on with his business until an
other challenger is developed.
He has met Jack Dempsey and he
likes the looks of the youngster who
is to meet him for the championship
July 4. '
"He's a likeable looking boy," said
Jess.
, But outside of taking one good look
at Dempsey when the two met recent
ly in Chicago, Jess hasn't worried
over his rival for heavyweight honors.
He turned a deaf ear on an invitations
to stop of fat Kansas City, en route
to California, and sit at the ringside
while Dempsey boxed an exhibition.
The only time he has seen him box
was in a Chicago gymnasium, where
Jack was lmbering up for the edifica
tion of the Chicago sport fans and
writers.
Jess started boxing late In life and
he's not worn out He hasn't fought
many battles and still figures him
self in his prime. -
He has no idea of giving up the title
and that means he has no ida of be
ing whipped by Dempsey.
"What'll you use on Dempsey?" he
was asked.
"Everything I've got," he Bald, and
that means a right upper cut, a left
jab, 240 pounds of super physique and
indomitable spirit.

UNITED STATES III
NATIONS LEAGUE
Five Ton Boulder Crashes Thru Bed
. John Dawson Left 5 Seconds Before
Majority Think Senate Can
Safely Ratify Without
, Referendum Vote
With congress meeting in special
session tomorrow and with prospects
ol the issue on the league of nations
becoming revived and made the sub
ject of strenuous debate, the para
mount question before American citi
zens today are: "Will the American
Congress ratify the covenant of the
league of nations as championed by
President Wilson, or will they alter
the covenant or reject it is its en
tirety? Should the league of nations
be submitted to a vote of the people?
. While the senate will soon, be hearing
arguments both for and against, here
are the opinions of Governor Campbell
pf Arizona and some of the 'promi
nent men and women of Bisbee on the
question as compiled by The Review:
Governor Thomas E. Campbell "I
bm a great believer in the value of the
league of nations.. . However, I am not
lully prepared to answer your ques
tions right now, since I have not read
and studied fully the text of the cove
nant aa.lt now stands. The question
of submitting it to a vote of the peo
ple, however, is a little far fetched,
Since there is no provision of law
whereby the people may vote on this
matter, and sinco it would require
cumbersome legislation and many
months in time. Such a rote, as the
constitution of the Uhited States now
reads, could not be held, since power
to ratify treaties rests only with the
United States senate. In spite of re
ports of Republican opposition and ob
jections, I am personally Inclined to
believe that when the treaty and
' league covenant is presented, it will
be ratified by the senate."
.Arthur Notman. Supt. of Mines, P.-D.
company "The question of whether
we are to be members of the league
would be a good thing for the refer
endum, but I doubt if such a coarse
could be applicable in accordance
with the constitution, if it could be
worked out to a decision of "yes" or
"no" by the peorle and then let the
senate work on the necessary amend
ments, it would be a good thing. 1
am fully satisfied that the pepple want
the league as it will be a guaranty
against future wars; that is it will
make war only by the decision of the
people and not by any individual. The
senate will ratify the president's
course by an overwhelming majiroty."
W. H. Maxey, manager Woolworth
Store "It is a hard question to an
swer. In the first place the U. S. sen
ate ratified in advance the actions
that Wilson might take. The senate
though, is composed of a majority of
one party whose views might be en
tirely different. Some members, of
the senate have been antagonistic to
ward the administration all through
the war. Ixdge and Borah for in
stance. Wilson should be allowed to
carry out what he has promised hu
manity. The league will broaden and
enlighten the world and make future
wais almost Impossible."
Miss Eleanor Jack, Teacher of Eng
lish, public schools "I think the sen
ate wholly capable of deciding on the
ratification of the treaty with its
amendments. If it is brought to a pop
ular vote there would be a great num
ber of people who don't know the
first principle of the league, men who
haven't had time to study it, would
vote and if their votes were against
or for it would kill the vote of the
man who has made a study of the
league and Its principles. By all means
it shculd.be left to the senate."
Judge Hogan "The league of na
tions appears to me td be vital for
the peace of the world. It is a big
question to decide; one which would
require thorough thought and sound
judgement. However, the Monroe doc
trine must remain inviolate and it
should bn made part of the covenant
of the league to that effect."
Mins J. D. Storie, Greenway school
"A popular vote of the people on the
membership of the United States in
the league of nations would be un
fair to the'senute and unfair to the
president because. of the great num
ber of men and women who haven't
bad the time to inako a study of its
principles and who might vote agalnbt
It just because they don't like the
present administration or becnuse
they don't understand its fundamental
principles which make future wars al
most impossible. The world is sick
and tired of war and the sacrifice has
been great enough to bring it to our
very doors, and we should now unite
to make the world a safer and better
place in which to dwell."

Judge J. L. Winters "I believe it is
a subject that should be referred to
the American people for their answer.
I am in favor of the referendum. If
the issue could be a non-partisan one,
I believe the senate would be capable
of acting for the people as the people

crowds on Naco road hurrying for
shelter. No sooner had Johnson
gained the edge of the street when
two large boulders, one weighing
three tons and the other five tons,
crushed their way through his
home at No. 222-A Naco road, de
molishing the roof and other fur
nishings. The bed in which Daw
son bad been slumbering in a few
moments previous was crushed be
neath the weight of the rock that
made its entrance through his bed
room. The other rock, a big five
ton nugget, passed through the
kitchen, making a hole -about 20
feet In diameter and lodged itself
against a frame house just in
front of the Dawson home.
A few doors away the largest
boulder of the trio, an Immense
rock standing 14 feet high and
measuring eight feet across the
center tore through the home oc
cupied by Charles Owen and wife
and O. Dawson and his wife. No
body was in this house which is at
No. 220-A Naco road. Both build
ings were of frame roofs and
adobe walls. Mrs. Owen and Mrs.
Dawson were working in Warren
at the time while their husbands
were up in Bisbee. The damage
sustained to both homes, both per
sonal and real,-was large.
The accident happened in view
of hundreds and caused great ex
citement all along Naco road. The
big blasts occur each afternoon
at 3 o'clock and everybody has
been warned to leave their homes
during the period specified. Street
cars are halted and all traffic is
suspended. A few weeks ago an
other small rock came down the
mountain side but the damage
was slight.
COCHISE HIGHWAYS
TO GET STATE HELP
SAYS GOV. CAMPBELL
Executive, .After Inspection
Trip, Say8 Local Roads
Second to None
The state of Arizona, through the
highways department, will assist Co
chise county with state and county
funds toward the early completion of
the Douglas-Bisbee concrete highway,
and it was for the purpose of inspect
ing his highway that Governor
Thomas E. Campbell, of Arizona, visit
ed yesterday in the Warren district.
He motored here with J. C.' Ryan,
county highway engineer, from Doug
las, he remained a few hours yester
day, and left during the afternoon for
inspections of the highways between
Bisbee and Tucson.
"The highways of this county are
among the best I have ever seen," de
clared the governor when he-had com
pleted the inspection of the Bisbee-
Douglas road., "When this road is
completed it will be the finest boule
vard in the entire southwest, and the
people of Cochise county may well be
proud of their latest good roads ac
quisition. The engineering work on
the highway is as good as I have ever
seen, some of the features of con
struction are superior to those of any
district of the United States, and
never have I seen work so thoroughly
done as it has been done on this road.
"I am making this trip in the inter
est of the state engineering depart
ment, since the state is preparing to
assist the county in completing the
construction of section 2, for which
funds in the bond issue are not avail
able. County funds in the state's
road funds will be used under the
supervision of the state engineer in
building the remainder of this sec
tion and we have been determining
j to what extent we will have to assist
l and how soon we will have to begin
our share of the work."
In the .Warren district Governor
Campbell was met by State Division
engineer I. P. Frazer, in charge of
state work near Tombstone and for
this part of Arizona, and with Mr.
Frazer he made the trip to Tomb
stone. He will remain in the county
seat tonight, leaving in the morning
for Benson to inspect the new county
highway commission road through
the San Pedro valley.
From Benson Governor Campbell
will return to Tombstone and make
a speedy survey of the borderland
highway by way of Empire Ranch to
Tucson

RELIEF 'ASSOCIATIONS
REPORT FOR QUARTER
SHOWS MANY HELPED
Warren District Ass'n. Great
Asset During Recent
Influenza Epidemic
At a meeting of the board of con
trol of the Warren District Relief as
sociation held on Monday, May 12, a
financial statement and report of the
work for the past three months, Feb
ruary, March and April, were given
by the general secretary, Miss Esther
Cummings.
This statement showed an expendi
ture of $1018.35 for all purposes in
connection with the work of the as
scciation for the three months men
tioned, during which time forty-one
different families had received aid,
whi included more than one hun
dred children. T4ie general secretary
stated in the report that this was a
larger number of families than would
have required aid under crdinary cir
cumstances, as much distress was
first brought about by the result of
the influenza, and then later by the
scarcity of work, chiefly among the
Mexican families, as 23 out of 43 fam
ilies nentioned were Mexican.
There were in all 34 cases of illness
given attention by tho W. D. Relief
association since February 1, o fwhich
14 were influenza cases. . In all the
influenza cases the Red Cross chap
ter of the Warren district has re-em-bursed'
the association . for the
amounts expended to . date, which
amounted to $441.0S for the three
months. The widows' pension was
also granted by the countyfin a num
ber of the cases where the father was
an American citizen or American born
and where the families were left des-titute-and
were entitled to aid from
that sourcee, besides which the coun
ty has given more or less help to
other families in the district who were
in need, working with the Warren Dis
trict Relief , association in that way.
Much of the clothing donated to
the association has been given out
to the school children in these poor
families, although the purchase of
shoes alone has been a considerable
expense. The Red Cross chapter Hav
ing donated several bolts of new
gobds to the association has been a
great help in the local work.
Transportation was furnished in
five case3 during the past there
months, four of which were on ac
count of illness, the general secretary
stating that the district is seldom
without some tubercular sufferec who
has come here for the benefit of the
climate and is compelled to leave
again on account of the high altitude.
Some weeks aso th epupils-of Miss
Kathleen Hail gave a recital at the
high school auditorium, the pro
ceeds of which, amounting to $S4.70,
were turned over to the association
for the benefit of one particular fami
ly where the father lias been ill for
many months. The general secretary
was asked to write Miss Hail a letter
of appreciation from the board for
this donation. Professor Philbrook
making mention of the fact that the
high school auditorium could be ob
tained for recitals at any time when
the proceeds were used for charitable
purposes. Some months previous to
Miss Hail's recital, the pupils of Mrs.
Esther Maye Thomason English also
gave a recital at the high school audi
torium, the proceeds of which were
donated to the relief association.
A letter having, been received by
the general secretary from Governor
Campbell, appointing her a delegate
to represent the state of Arizona at
the 'national conference of Social
Work to Ihj held at Atlantic City June
1-8.. Was left in abeyance for the pre
sent, on account of the expense in

AMERICANIZATION IN ARIZONA
Tonisht at 8:30 at the Y. W. C. A.
tennis court the Hi-Y girls and boys
will gather, for community singing un
der the direction of Mr. Kuhn.
The spontaneous results that Mr.
Kuhn has obtained since his arrival
in Bisbee have been most gratifying
j to him, he says and he intends to
i push the work here to the utmost un
til his departure on next Thursday.
On Wednesday evening last Mr.
Kuhn appeared before the men from
the mines who gather at the Y. M. C.
A. to discuss shop and in a few min
utes he had them singing "I'm Al
ways Chasing Rainbows." It is said
that there is a mine at the end of
each rainbow so the song was quite
fitting fcr the men who moil for
metals.
During the morning Mr. Kuhn ap
pears at the P. D. store and every
body knocks off work for ten mliutes
and airs his voice. As a result every
body feels happier during the day and
better results are obtained. Grouchy
clerks don't pay, so the P. D. company,
not that they have anp grouchy
clerks, have decided to keep their
workers in good spirits at all times
and it looks as if community singing
has come to Bisbee to stay.

Four Arizona mining companies and

forced to pass up a"hy distribution oT
earnings of April of this year. Tile
Magma, Superior, the Iron Cap and
the Arizona Commercial of Globe, and
the United Verde failed to declare
April dividends, as well as the North

But five copper mining companies
made dividend distributions during:
April, payments aggregating $2,664,657, j
compared with a total of $4,361,644 in
the corresponding month of last year

"Its production was 60.000,000 barrels

was 100,000,000 barrels. Shipments are

How did they take them down
there? It was a big job. When
the need for mules became urgent
in the underground shafts, they
just naturally tied their legs to;

them on their haunches in a 6x4
cage and as they sat upright in the
cage they were lowered to their

SILVER PRODUCER
PLAYING IN LUCK
AS PRICE SOARS
Silver One of Few Articles
of Commerce Which
Was Stabilized
WASHINGTON, May 17. Silver is
one of the few articles o fcommerce
stabilized by war conditions and great
credit is due to Senator Pittman of Ne
vada and Hon. Ray Baker .director of
the U. S. mint, in this connection. The
threatened action of the government
which two years ago proposed to fix
the price of silver at 86 cents ; per
ounce, resulted in conventions at Salt
Lake and Denver, called by the west
ern chapters of the American mining
congress. A big delegation from silver
producing states was 'appointed. Gov.
Emmett D. Boyle of Nevada, who per
sonally headed the Nevada delegation
in Washington acting as chairman. It
was shown that it cost as high as $1
to produce an ounce of silver bullion
in the mines and districts where sil
ver was the chief, product. The ad
ministration had no desire to close
down American silver camps and en
dorsed a bill introduced by Hon. Key
Pittman authorizing the director of
the mint to purchase 300,000,000
ounces of silver bullion at $1 per
ounce. The 'passage of this legislation
prevented disaster to the silver indus
try. New that war is over and em
bargoes have been removed, silver is
selling in the open market in excess
of $1.04 and some private export con
tracts have gone to $1.11. Silver can
not go below $1, while Director Baker
has an appropriation left under the
Pittman bill.
SILVER PRICE RAISE
UNLOCKS ROY MINE
E. T. Barnett, manager o fthe Roy
mine in the Clnco de Mayo district,
Mexico, was in Douglas several days
last week conferring with the .owner,
Hon. B. A. Packard, who fell heir to
! the property severadl years ago. when
the price of silver reached 49 cents
per ounce, and stopped operation on
the mine. Mr. Barnett has been in
charge of the property for three
months and during that time has
installed a 50 ton flotation mill and
said this morning that he expected
to begin production during the next
30 days.
On the old dumps are now about
25,000 tons of ore ready for the mill
and besides there are probably 10,
000 tons of second class ore in
the mine which was piled away dur
ing the production of the higher grade
during production In the past.
At the mill are employed now about
16 men and In the mine are some
40 men at work taking out ore
on a leasing plan. All this ore will
be milled as soon as the plant is ready
for operation and with silver now
worth about $1.20 per ounce the out
look for prosperity at the Roy mine
is looking exceedlnly well.
Mr. Barnett is returning to the prop
erty today, having come to Douglas
for supplies, including some stationery
which wa3 provided by the Daily In

will be started upon this at an early
date. The new change rooms are equipped
with hot and cold shower baths, and
have lockers where each workman has I
a place to leave his valuables and his j
cnange oi cioines m security.
The change rooms are made as sani

the miners are hung up close to the

Galvanized iron partitions hang
from the roof to prevent the clothes
of the various men from touching
each other. ' ,
Ample window openings around the
walls in the upper half of the build

temperature for changing.
safety First plan is
NOW MEETING WITH
WIDESPREAD APPROVAL
Safety First! That was the slogan
that wa3 begun not so very long ago.
Since it was first introduced to the
miners by the Phelps-Dodge corpora
tion .through W. W. Gidley, -safety
first expert through . diligent worlc
and untiring efforts on the part of the
mine bosses and foremen the word
Safety First has come to mean a great
deal to the average miner. It has set
him to thinking before a fatal acci
dent occurred and it has made it pos
sible for him to go to wofk in the
morning with full knowledge that he
will go back home alive when the
day has ended, provided he observes
the rules of caution. The best safety
device, he has been taught, is a care
ful man. and as a result everybody
has benefitted. The accidents for the
past two years have been trifling and
only minor injuries have resulted.
An illustration of some of the
Safety First Cautions now posted con
spicuously in the various Copper
Queen mines is the following:
"Be Careful. '
"There are no round trip tickets to
the graveyard.
"Your body is a big part of your
capital Don't invest it in the 'Bank
of Careless Habits.'
"Short cuts often result in sharp
cuts at the hospital.
"The Bank of Safety pays 100 per
cent and never fails."
The results have been astonishing.
It has set the men to thinking of
themselves and others. Safety First
is preached by the shift bosses, the
mine bosses and everyone else until
at last the danger that lurks beneath
the ground has been defeated by men
who think for themselves.

TO NEW ORE RATE
CLASSIFICATIONS
Present Method Declared to
Be Invaled, New Burden
Put on Shippers
An order just asked for by the Den
ver district freight traffic committee
would, if put into effect, eventually
revolutionize the established system of
handling and collecting for the move
ment of all raw materials.
Under the proposed rulings, the
present method of ' "declaring valua
tion" is declared to be a violation ot,
the Cummins act and ores are to be
charged at actual valuation as dis
closed by the smelter or sales reports
the rate to be the present rate up
to 100 value per ton and 1 per cent ot
value in excess1 of $100 value per net
ton. This the established practice ot
releasing all values on shipments un
der a declaration of value in order to
receive the benefits of a reasonably
low tonnage rate is to be eliminated
and the railroad administration or its
successor, the railroad companies, will
be given access to the Ifnanclal trans
actions In connection with production
or sales of ores or concentrates.
The mining industry of the west is
already overburdened and threatened
with collapse and formal protests have I
been filled by the American mining
congress, with both the western
freight traffic association and the in -
terstate commerce commission against
the adoption of the ruling. A hearing
has been announced' in Chicago Maj
13. but ore producers of the west are
aroused and. haev asked for a post,
ponement to June 13, at which time
the evils and impractical features of
the proposhed ruling may be dis
cussed. It is stated that the effort to se
cure the promulgation of such a revo
lutionary regulation through a local
district request is the beginning of a
plan to secure closer vision into the
financial transactions and to Increase
the railroad revenue from all raw ma-
J terials.

and I had lived among them and had
learned to understand and appreciate
the bigness of their hearts. But the
men who mined for the bronzed metal
were to me an unknown quantity.
Arriving at the head of the Sacra
mento shaft that lies on the south
eastern slope of Sacramento Hill I
stopped and I gazed. It was a silent
look into an immense working that
bewildered. It was quite different
from the coal fields of the anthracite
region. There was an absence of the
dirt that stifles, but there was an
abundance of the type of men that
make up the great melting pot in the
industrial world. They were com
moners a broad type of democracy
that makes breathing in America not
as difficult as in other countries I
have been in. I felt perfectly at home.
My ignorance of the copper industry
was readily appreciated, and Jack
Radcliffe, the congenial English fore-
man, made me feel as though 1 would
like o live among men of his typt.
Mule Is Index to Efficiency
As I stood at the head of the five
compartment shaft that leads down
into the secrets that are hidden in the
intestines of the earth, my eyes could
not help but fall upon a small sized
mule that was towing some Iron cars
laden with waste to the eastern slope
of the hill. The efficiency which that
mule exhibited as he sidestepped to
let the cars coast by was truly ad
mirable. The way that animal handled
his job would have made a slacker fill
out a questionnaire.
"Some mule,' 'I informed the Mexi
can that was handling him. "Yes,"
he retorted, "Charlies' a pretty good
sort of ah animal. lie's been with the
company 15 years."
Fifteen years with the compuny. I
wondered how Charlie managed to
keep up with his work and still retain
his robust appearance. I soon found
out. It was the pleasant surroundings
and the excellent working facilities.
An efficiency system that would be
hard to duplicate Is found in the Sac
ramento shaft and surface workings.
Eight hours is the .working shift, but
an. allowance is made for going into
the shaft and returning and as a re
sult only seven hours constitute a
day's work with a scale of wages that
are in accord with the fluctuating
price of copper. Complete harmony
reigns even to the innermost and dif
ficult workings of the underground.
The men are contented. I got it from
the lips of many of them. Even the
mules' uhat make their home in a
stable where daynight never pene
trates are satisfied. If they weren't
they wouldn't maintain the wonderful
broadened shoulders' and plump hips.
A finer set of animals one could find
nowhere. And some of them have been
below the surface for years. If they
could speak they would utter only
words of praise for the treatment
they get. ' f
Is Five-Compartment Shaft,
The Sacramento shafts has the most
elaborate and ingenious system for
mixing and loading ore to be found at
any copper mine" in the country. It is
of five compartments. The ore Is
hoisted from the levels in 3-ton skips
and then dumped automatically Into
a hopper and conveyed to the foot
of the hill about 150 feet away on u
Stephetis-Adamson belt conveyer. This
belt carries the ore to the railroad
cars switched into a loading shed 4 J
xSOO feet. The big belt keeps revolv
ing and travels at a rate of 210 feet a
minute. The skips arrive at the liop-
j P" about ever other minute and as
j the ore passes through the hopper
1 every i8 feet of belt is registered as
it passes over an ingenious seal. It
is a marvelous piece of machinery.
Herbert Kinney, who has charge of
the conveyer has been with th.e com
pany for nearly 30 years and Is soon
to be retired and will reap the bene
fits of the Thelps-Dodge liberal Ten
sion system.
Load Several Cars at Once
The belts run lengthwise after they
reach the loading shed and approxi
mately 20 cars can be loaded at a
time. Last week 436 skips were
hauled to the surface in a single day,
making a total of 1706 tons handled

Skilled farmers will be placed on
small leases or freeholds, partly skill

in other vays will get .cottages with
half an acre to four acres and un
skilled men will get a chance on co

are to be arranged about a central

to be at the disposal of the small
farmer. To speed food production,
more than 1000 incompetent farmers
were evicted during the war and the

" Farming With Ultra-Violet Rays
Talzan Tsuji, Japanese scientist, has been making fascinating ex
periments with the ultra-violet ray, that first-cousin of light, sound and
wireless.
These rays, vibrating 750 trillion times per second, exi3t in the sun
light but are largely absorbed by the gases of our atmosphere, at the ex
pense of plant life which they stimulate greatly.
Dr. Tsuji , grew pineapples riper, larger, sweeter and juicer by ex
posing the rows 40 minutes each morning to the ultra-violet rays from a
mercury vapor lamp. Similar results were obtained with sugar cane and
etiolated bananas. Tsuji predicts that, as soon as the rays can be pro
duced cheaply, sugar cane will require only half of the present time be
tween planting and harvesting, and that bananas will be picked green,
shipped to market and ripened when needed.
Asiatics, as result of necessity arising from dense population, lead
the world in intensive farming. Chinese coolies, whose labor made
possible the construction of the first trans-continental railroads, and who
flocked to the pnining camps as cooks back in '49, gave California its
wonderful fruit industry.
Even more expert in farming are the Japanese, who support half
the population of the United States on a territory smaller than the state
of California and only 14.37 per cent of which is cultivatable.
Electricity, another new Crop stimulant. Dr. A. B. Macallum, British
government scientist, has achieved important results by stringing high
tension wires in a network with 30-foot meshes about five feet above
.ground. This process is established in England and now being used on
a large scale. Fields thus electrified have crop yields of wheat, barley
and oats increased from 25 to 30 per cent. The quality of the grain like
wise benefits more weight, less chaff and more flour per bushel.
Seeds that have been electrified in laboratories are also more pro
ductive, but must be sown promptly, as fhe effect lasts only about one
month. A crop grown from electrified corn is less susceptible to wire
worm and fungus diseases.
This application of electricity to farming throws entirely new light
on the possibilities that will open up when our country's water power
is harnessed and made to turn giant generators.
Picture a farmer counteracting a late season by merely throwing on
a master-switch!
Curiously enough Fry, the electrician who has made most progress
in the new field, knew little about agriculture. Outsiders frequently
make for most progress within an industry they come with a fresh
viewpoint and see the obvious. Spinning was revolutionized by a bar
ber, weaving by a minister, and despite the teakettle story Watt was a
manufacturer of delicate scientific instruments when he invented the
steam engine.
Advertising Reduces The Cost of Goods
There are economists of standing who say that advertising is the
cause for the increased cost of goods.
This is not true.
Advertising actually reduces the cost of goods.
To dispense with advertising in order to reduce the cost of goods
would be like going back to the flour and flail in threshing! in order
to reduce the cost of grain. - ,
Advertising is the time and effort saving device in the sale of goods
the same as. power and machinery in the production of goods.
. All goods, including new and unknown goods, would sell themselves
if given time enough one satisfied customer might tell another.
But time is an important factor in the cost of goods, carrying
charges in the way of interest and rent, from the time of production to
final sale.
The speed with which goods are sold determines their price and in
another larger way than reducing the carrying charges.
The faster a stock of goods is sold the smaller, the lower the margin
of profit the manufacturer or merchant is compelled to charge the con
sumer. The profit from doing business is not in the large profit on each
sale, but rather the number of profits from many sales.
Many small profits from each sale make one large profit.
This principle is technically known as "turnover," and is the num
ber of times a merchant sells his complete stock in a year turns the
stock into money.
Say for instance- a candy store makes four per cent net profit on a
dollar of sales.
But say it "turn," sells the stock completely once a week, 52 times
a year. Is not this merchant making 52 times four per cent, equalling
208 per cent annual profit?
Jt seems paradoxical that a customer should pay only one-half cent
profit on ten cents worth of candy to enable the merchant to make 208
per cent, but It will be understood in considering the fact that the in
vestment is in one week's supply only. . ,
Both the manufacturer and merchant use advertising to speed the
sale of goods increase the "turnover."
If they are able to sell at less individual profit they are thus able
to reduce the price increase the market by making the goods iwithin
the price range of more persons.
Advertising is the speed lever, the high gear of sales.
It is not only an educational factor to more and better goods, but at
a lower price to the consumer by enabling the product and merchant to
live and prosper at a lower margin of individual profit.

ALLIANCE MOVEMENT
ST. LOUIS, May 16. After several
hours' debate, delegates to the 131st
general assembly of the Presbyterian
church have postponed until later
sessions the question of whether the
church should enter the inter-church
world movement.
Paragraphs of the New Era report
pertaining to the movement finally
were deleted and the report adopted
for five years With the understand
ing that the question would be brought
before the assembly later. Alliance
of all Protestant, churches is the
foundation of the Inter-curch world
movement.
The New Era report, as . adopted,'
urges that arrangements be made for
the. caring for the returning soldiers
and sailors, and that positions be
found for returning ministers who
served in the war. The report advo
cates that a greater brotherhood be
tween emnlover and employe as a
means of eradicating Bolshevism and
I. W. W.'ism be brought about and
states that the church is the most in
fluential society to bring this about,
The report also advocates sex equality
in church matters.
In the report of the evangelism com
mission, closer co-operation of the va
rious presbyteries was urged as a
means of making the work of the
church more concrete.

Included in the ceremonies for Decoration day iii Cleveland will be
the dedication of Liberty Row a row oO trees to be planted along a
parkway, one tree for each Cleveland man who gave his life in this war.
They are getting the row ready now. The trees are being planted,
and in every case where H la possible, the mother of the lost lad, or his
nearest of kin after his mother, plants the tree.
There will be 695 trees in that row.
A good deal has been written already about the desirability of plant
ing trees as memorials for the, boys. Tim added touoh of personality In
the planting adds point and dignity to the plan. The great total of
deaths in the army may be a glorious impersonal sacrifice upon the altar
of freedom, but every individual soldier who died meant keen and lasting
sorrow in Individual hearts, which no ceremony should bo too general
to take Into account. Though the final dedicatiou may be a great public
affair, there is something singularly appropriate in this private planting
of the trees by the people who, when all Is said and done, tare more than
anybody else. Arizona star.

DOUGLAS, May 17. The band of
outlaws under Jose Mana Suarez
which on last Friday terrorized Can

DEMPSEY ARRIVES TO
TRAIN FOR WILLARD
TOLEDO, May 17. With the ar
rival Friday of Jack Dempsey, chal
lenger for the world's heavyweight
championship, manager Jack Kearns
announced complete plans for "his pro
tege's trainging iprogipm for his
championship battle with Jess Wil
lard at Eay View Park July 4.
Kearns said that Dempsey would
work one week, and loaf the next,
so as to avoid going stale. He will
do all of his training out of doors,
inasmuch a3 the battle is to be fought
in the open, and proposes to do only
light work for the first week. The
main effort will be to increase Demp
sey's speed and to bring his endur
ance up to the highest possible
pitch.
Dempsey was in high spirits after
finishing his motor trip from Chica
go. He and Kearns spent the after
noon looking over the sites for a
training camp but no deal was closed.
It is likely the challenger will estab
lish quarters at the beach at Lake
Erie.
NEW MEXICO OUPTUT

compared with 83,339,782 pounds in
1917. The Burro Mountain Copper
company's operations at Tyrone were
continuous. This company's concen
tration mill began operations at full
capacity June 1, 1916. During the year
a flotation plant was set in operation
at the Eighty-Five mine. Shipments
of copper ore from the Magdalena dis
trict, Socorro county, which had been
large in 1916, were less in 1917. The
Apache mine, at Hachita; the Oro
giande district, in Otero county; and
the Carocito district near Scholle, also
contributed some copper.
Lead ores were shipped from the
Central and Steeplerock districts.
Grant county, and the Cooks Peak and
Victorio districts, Luna county. Con
siderable quantities of lead carbonate
and lead zinc carbonate ores contin
ued to be sh'ipped from Kelly, Socorro
county, and during a part' of the year
lead was shipped from the Organ
Mountain district, Dona Ana county.
The lead smelter at Deming, destroyed
by fire in October, 1917, was not re
built. DoeVeased shipments of zinc, car
bonate and zinc sulphide ores were
made in 1918. At Kelly, Socorro
county, the principal producing mines
were the Kelly, Graphic and Juanita.
The Ozark mill was operated steadily,
but the Kelly mill was not in opera
tion. At Hanover zinc carbonate ores
were shipped from the Empire zine
mines and others, and zinc Sulphide
concentrates were Bliippod from the
Hanover magnetic separation mill.
' The Cleveland magnetic separation
mill, at Vinos Altos, was operated
titeadily, but at a reduced ylejd. In
September the Carlisle mill, in the
Stoeplerock district. Grant county,
was again net in operation and the
load concentrates were shipped, but
Sulphide ores in considerable quan
tities were thlpied from the Republic
minte, at Hanover, and several lots of
zinc sulphide concentrates were ship
ped from the Jlocky Mountain mill,
at Cerrillos. Zinc carbonate ores were
shipped iroiit the .Majdalena, Han

zinc ore and 'concentrates shipped
from mines in ll'lS amounted to 4j.
USL' tons of "3 per cent grade, com
pared with 61..r3: tons of 31 per cent

He was making a neat after-supper
speech, and quoted Bobbie Burns:
"She is a winsome wee thing,
"She is a handsome wee thing,
"She is a bonny wee thing,
"This sweet wee wife o mine."
(But he got all mixed up and said
"boney" instead of "bonny" in the
third line, and his wife heard about
it)
. (Pause) m .
What a Wife Worth.
"In Africa a wife is worth $15. In
America she often is worth less than
that."
The author of that idea is George
Agnew Chamberlain, writer of novels,
who goes on to say:
"A woman's market price is in di
rect ratio to what she is worth. The
highest bids are made for the most
useless women, the daughters ofthe
rich who cannot even keep house oi
supervise their servants. And the
men with the least money marry the
sensibly trained, efficient girls.
"I believed civilized man is becom
ing convinced that in the marriage of
today he does not get value receivedJ
Unless our women want marriage to
go out altogether they had better
study its basic principles ,as under
stood and practiced by African slaves.

"A good wife is heaven's last, best
gift to man his gem of many virtues,
his casket of jewels, her voice is sweet
music, her smiles his brightest day,
her. kiss the -guardian of his inno
cence, her arms the pale of his safety,
her industry his surest wealth, her
economy his safest Stewart, her lips

Suchislife in l Angeles
LOS ANGELES. Cal. The
safety mirrors on cars of the
Angeles railway company have
attacked by the fair sex of the city,
and already a number of protests
against the mirrors have been lodged
with officials of the company.
Fashion, which has decreed the
tight skirt, is the Teal cause of the
complaint, and the women declare
they are embarrassed "by the stare
of the motormen aa they climb aboard
the cars. -
On tire other hand, official of the
railway company have filed a counter
complaint, charging that the tight
skirts cause undue delay of the cars.
In addition, they say the motormen
merely do their duty in watching the
mirrors to make certain passengers
are on the cars before starting. (The
only ones not complaining are the
motormen: they keep their mirrors
nicely polished these days).

SONORA ELECTION IS
VOID; CALLES WILL
CONTINUE GOVERNOR
DOUGLAS, May 17. The elec
tion held in Sonora April 27 to
choose a governor for the state,
was void under the provisions of
the constitution of Mexico, ac
cording to a semi-official an
nouncement reaching Agua Prieta
today from Hermocillo, the state
capital. Adolfo de la Huerta, the
leading candidate, lacked 1500
votes of having the necessary ma
jority over his three opponents.'
As the constitution clearly
specifies that the members ofl
the chambers of deputies, sjate
and national, governors and presi
dents must receive a majority bf
all votes cast at the election, it
has been decided that no one was
elected in the recent balloting.
, De la Huerta' 8 vote was 18,523;
Gen. Ygnacio Pesquiera received
10,079; Conrado Gaxiola, 6785;
Gen. Miguel Samaniego, 3152.
The total ot de la Huerta's three
opponents was 20,016 and de la
Huerta lacked approximately 1500
votes of surpassing them.
Under the constitution ,the pres
ent governor, Gen. P. Elias Calles,
will hold office until the state con
gress can call another election.
This probably, will bg done in the .
near future.

$2,000,000.00 was paid for the Burk
Waggoner well less than ten days ago.
Each, stockholder received $3,500 for every $100 invested in this Co.
A few wise men in Arizona and New Mexico invested their money in this
stock: the possibilities of Burk-Waggoner then were no -greater than
PARAMOUNT is now. Just assure as Burk-Waggoner was thebuy of the

Capital only, $100000
Statement From Paramount Co. To Robert Weiller
Just think what that means. FIFTY-THREE acres all in the
Burkburnett field. Our TEN acre tract in Block 46 could be
sold for from $.7,000 to $10,000 per acre. Sounds some
what different from $90,000 capitalization on 2J acres, or
$500,000 on 40 acres. ' There is a reason for this. We are
NOT STOCK JOBBERS. Our leases represent actual val
ue they go in the company for just what we paid for them
and they are worth many times our capitalization now. We
could sell out today and pay a nice dividend. But- the
PARAMOUNT OIL COMPANY is going after the oil. We
haven't an acre of ground that we would sell for every
acre is PROVEN OIL LAND and we're going to develop
our entire holdings.

The Robert Weiller Company was indeed fortun
ate securing the remaining block of Paramount

Paramount didn't wait until after all the stock had been sold to begin drill

one of the most successful drillers in the Burkburnett field, a man who has
brought in GUSHER after GUSHErt whose latest big well was the BURK
WAGGONER to begin DRILLING. This man is a brother of H. B. Myers,
general manager of Paramount,' and he is already down 900 feet on Para

Your Opportunity
Opportunity is knocking now. I am on
ly afraid that those .who most need to
accept it will not do so. I wish it were
possible to meet every one in the South
west and carefully explain what PARA
MOUNT will mean to them. I would
to PROVE to you that I, am far more
interested in your making some money
than in the little profit I will make in
selling you this stock.
I have told you that my real motive in
ebing in the brokerage business today is
to gain FAME there is positively no
doubt of the wonderful wealth to bo
made from oil investments. It is only a
question of buying the RIGHT stock.
And here is where I am in a position to
scatter wealth and gladness and sun-,
shine. Here is my opportunity to cause
the name of ROBERT WEILLER to be
worshipped in every home. For Robert
Weiller KNOWS stock I KNOW how to
make money in the oil business. I HAVE
MADE MONEY in the oil business and
I'm now trying to get you to let me
make some money for you.
Some people migh object to my frank,
straightforward method of advertising
I'm not egotistical BUT 1 KNOW
WHAT I CAN DO nd I'm not ashamed
to pat my plans and hopes and ambi
tions down on paper my whole life is
an open book I've never done, and I'll
never do anything to be ashamed of.
1 believe that hundreds of families
who buy stock in PARAMOUNT upon
my advice and who will become weal
thy from this investment will look upon
me as an ideal man and I shouldn't be
surprised but what ROBERT will be
come a more popular name in these
families. '
Stay with me and I'll tell you when
to quit.

P. S. Several of my clients misun
derstood my advertisement in Monday's

Don't think for one minute that there is no chance of the companywith the little acreage not
paying dividends. Numbers of Burkburnett" companies with from a few town lots to an acreage
have proved an excellent investment. The Burk-Waggoner, for instance, had only one well
when they sold out a few days ago for two million dollars. But here' is the point IF THE

r
Sacramento shaft Is a model that
would furnish on exhaustive supply of
color for a literary brain, versed In
minerals and mining. It la too rduch
for the writer to do It justice.
Every precaution has been taken to
safeguard the men below the surface
In event of a fire breaking out inthe
shaft or in one of the levels. V.y
means fr a lateral air valve th bulk
head doors in the ariaus working- are
controlled from the surface and in
event of a fire one door could be clos
ed "at a time or they couTd be auto
matically closed by the manipulation
of the air valve. On the different lev
els, however .one could close any cer
tain bulkhead door without the aid of
the surface valve. Provisions have
been made for each level to take care
of Its own 'area.
"Change Room" Popular Feature
In line with the company's policy to
make the working conditions as pleas
ant as possible is an outstanding fea
ture that might well be copied even by
;other industrial concerns that have no
connection with the mining industry.
It is the "change room," where a man
can repair after a day's work and
clean himself and remove his mining
clothes in exchange for street clothes.
It is one of the most popular features
of the mines. It contains more than
500 lockers and is modern in every re-1
spect. The structure is of concrete
with cement flooring end is quite spa
cious. The men's clothes are drawn to
the ceiling by means of chains and
pulleys, operating from the inside of
the lockers .thus making it impossible
to lower the clothes without having ac
cess t the lockers. Each individual
has his own key.
In another large room just off the
change room Is the shower bath room
containing 28 shower heads that draw
both hot and cold water. At the east
ern end of the room a portion of the
building has been partitioned off for
the Mexican help, containing shower
, baths, lockers and other equipment. A
caretaker Is on duty on each shift and
. the room is spotlessly clean, making
working conditions extremely popular
and pleasant.
In the matter of. obtaining supplies,
everything is centralized even the
ialr. The powder ,of which there is a
huge amount required for the carry
ing on o fthe work, is haidle dfrom a
central supply depot and is stored in
one great magazine and each day it is
allotted according to the requirements
as called for on requisition from the
bosses of the different levels and
workings.
"When the powder arrives at the sur

a powder monkey, a licensed handler
of explosives, who must pa?s a rigid
examination before falling heir to the
job. There- are powder monkeys on
each, level., and it is one of, hi3 duties
to keep account of every . stick of dyna
mite, fuse and cap that goes below the
surfice. The size of the - dynamite
Bticks.vary from' of an inch to an
inch " and a quarter and would rock
the rpek of Gibraltar. All of the pow
der monkeys are old, experienced and
trusted employes, and when they are
not dishing out small earthquakes they
plod through the underground work
ings In search of samples which are
sent to the surface for an assay. The
returns are sent back
to the mine department so that the
grade, of ore can be kep up to Its
standard. 1
Haulage by Electricity
The five compartments in the Sac
ramento shafts handle all the ores
from the Queen mines which is
brought by underground electric haul
age except the ore from the Southwest
mine. As the ore comes up in-the
skips and is dumped into the hopper
a sampler takes a portion of each
skip load and it Is then sent to the
assay office for analysis.
Leaving the surface the ride to the
400-foot level is like a tossing in, a
motor boat to a landlubber, devoid,
of course ,of the sea sickness of which
so many people declare while it gtips
them that they are going to die. On
the 400 foot level a big ore pocket
handles the ore from the Czar and
Hoi brook shafts. The ore is hauled to
the pocket by means of tram cars.
drawn, Dy electric locomotives. As a.
matter of fact the electric tram line
is . the artery of the "mine, it is the
connecting link of a great belt of min
' eral wealth.. As the ore is brought to
the 400 foot lever it Is dumped down
the pocket to the 500 foot level, where
men load it into the skips and it is
hoisted to the surface. The tram
trains are composed of 20 or more iron
cars with side dumping device and the
. locomotive is operated on the same
principle as street cars, with overhead
trolley. Along the right of way green
lights denote places of safety and with
the approach of the train which can
be seen for a considerable distance
through the glare of a powerful head
light one can seek shelter In the
numerous manholes until it passes.
At present some work is being done
on the 300 and 400 foot. levels. This
is a low grade concentrating ore and
about 15c; tons are bt-ing removed
daily aid conveyed to a concentrator,
where a milling test is being conduct-
ed. This low grade ore is practically
the same grade of ore that will be
handled from Sacramento Hill as soon
as the immense quantity of waste is
removed. ' Last month 176,000 cubic
two in the district that boasts a all
concrete shaft in the five compaht
ments, the other being the Junction
shaft of the C. and A. While this
mammoth task was being performed
down to the 1700 level the shafts con
tinued their workinngs removing daily
from 1)00 to 1700 tons ot ore. It was
made possible to work the mines dur
lug ihe concrete work on the shaft
by arranging the shifts so that they
would not interfere with the working
time allotted to the concree workers.
On the 400 foot level a raise is in pro
gress and it is now going upward for
considerable distance in search of con
centrating ore that will pay. The men
on this job are working on the com
paries bonus system. At present they
have made proress amounting to near
ly 80 feet. If they exceed the com
pany's expectations they are given a
bonus for each additional fraction i
above the requirement of a fair day's
work. The bonus decision has had a
very stimulating effect and 'is bring
ing out of the. men the very best that
is in taera. Consequently both the
company and the men are profiting.
Pure Air in Remotest Corners
The ventilation system, which at
present it is contempulated to enlarge,
is of the bfghest type and even in the
remote corners of the underground
the air is free and refreshing even to
one who is not accustomed ito the
closeness of the underground. The
big ventilator is of an immense
throwing capacity and its circulation
is guided throughout the mine by
means of air doors. Another one of
these fans in installed and in opera
tion on the 1400 foot level. When the
proposed additional improvements
have been realized Sacramento shaft
wilr be one of the best and most up-to-date
ventilated mines in the coun
try. To Connect With Dallas Shaft
An interesting task has already be
gun on the 1600 foot level which has
for its ultimate purpose the connect
ing up of the Sacramento working
with those of the Dallas shaft. Work
is now progressing on the tunneling
through the mountain Tor a distance
of 1837 feet and it will require a long
time to complete the job. At present
about five feet prograss is made each
day and' when the work has been fin
ished the Dallas shaft will be the
main hoisting shaft and the ores from
the Sacramento workings will be
hauled to the Dallas shaft by means of
the tram electric system. In the drill
ing of this tunnel a self-fed No. 18,
liner air drilling machine is being used
and about 15 holes are dring drilled J
each day in which, are placed about j
50 sticks of dynamite that loosen up
the entrance. Fred Murphy la on this
job, and he says he's going to stick
with until the day when the Sacramen
to mine will invade the Dallas shaft.
He said he liked the job.
Work is also under way from the
1C00 foot level in the sinking of a
winze, from which the 1700 and 1S00
levels will be driven to the Dallas
shaft. The work has progressed very
faborably toward the 1500 foot level
and as soon as the timber bracing
work has been installed drilling will
them be centered on the downward
drive. In this level a number of stopes

Classes in F'rst Aid
In addition to a vast safety first sys

number of accidents Bince it has been
installed, classes are held in first aid
work to the injured.
Mobile latrines are found on each
level and they are kept in sanitary
condition at all times.

To tell of all the interesting work
that is going on in the various levels
would fill a book. On all the levels I
found the men in excellent spirits.
feacamento Mine is one of the most
modern to be found anywhere in the
country, and the feeling that appar
ently exists between the mine bosies
and the men is the kind that will
bring about a better understanding
between the men who moil for the
metal and the men who direct its af
fairs from the surface. It left an in
delible impres-bion with me that capi
tal and labor in America is beginning
to understand each other. A human
understanding of a corporation with
a heart as big as its holdings.

BISBEE V.W.C1 HAS RECORD YEAR OF

BOTH IN WAR AND
While Answering to Every War Call at Home and at Front
During Most Strenuous Year of Conflict for America,
Local Y. W. Has Doubled Membership, Provided Girls
By Hundred With Employment and Happiness
I i -
,Prouldy perched by Itself at tbe
head of Howell street like a giant
sentinel there stands a memorial to
Mrs. Grace Dodge that will live after
her through the sands of time. It is
a home that Is near to the heart of
the working girl and the professional
girl. To the girl that finds iier way
around a great big world, sometimes
unsympathetic, it is home.
At the head of Howell street Is the
Y. W. C- A. In 1914 the foundation
was laid and since its completion it
has been a home to hundreds of girls.
It is the only home some of them can
claim. And when a day has been end
ed the trail that leads to it takes
them home.
Has Fine War Record
Although the last two years have
proved difficult ones, with the entire
nation struggling at the great wheels
of war, the work performed by the
local Y. M. C. A. has beeTi doubly
crowned with glowing success both
In home duties and the concentration
of efforts to the winning of the war.
With the dawning now of peace
and a new era of covilization a new
great work confronts the Y. W. C. A.
It will be for the uplifting of the mor
ale of the young men and boys
through the training of the girls along
a higher plane of thought and living.
A review of the work accomplished
during the past year i3 illuminating.
The President, Mrs. Allen, together
with the members of the boar'', of di
rectors of the Bisbee Y. W. C? A. have
very faithfully and conscientiously
carried out the duties entrusted td i
. . T . . . ' 1 . I
id em oesiues cneenuiiy acceding at
all times to the many demands upon
their time and energies ' for ' War
Work. Their devotion to their duty
has been an inspiration that could
only foreshadow the crowning suc
cess of a year filled with work-and
action.
Big Factor in Church Work
During the year the Religious De
partment planned several vesper ser
vices which were held during the first
part of last year. when special speak
ers gave interesting talks along lines
" of spiritual and practical work. The
records show that 15 business meet
ings, socials and teas have been .held
by the different church at the Y. W.
C. A. during theyear. Through the
keeping of a' membership file a num
ber of strangers have been Introduc
ed into the various churches. In the
community a need is felt for a great
er spiritual uplift arid power for good
and during the next year It is the
plan of the association to unite their
efforts for consecrated service.
Education Debarment Busy i
, The Educational Department with
Miss Cregg as chairman has been
active during the year. Spanish was
taught by Senor Avila, Physical Cul
ture -was prominent also under the
supervision of Mrs. J. B. Morley. A
millinery class was likewise conduct
ed by Mrs. C. S. Wilson and the
funds derived from the millinery work
was turned over to the United War
Work fund. In music t and . art Miss
Hale's Folk Dancing' Class and' the
Choral Club under the direction of
Mrs. Charlotte Gill added to the
years' social activities.
During: last fall a great deal of
work which was planned the as
sociation had to be posponed owing
to the influenza epidemic and it was
unable to organize extra classes due
to the quarantine and, war work ac
tivities. Interesting-Speakers During Year
The association heard a number of
speakers during the year sent out by
the government in the interest of bet
ter community training along moral
and social lines. Among the speak
ers were Mrs. Lockwood and Miss
Sporleder in the interest of govern
men conservation work; Lieut. Fred
erick T. Fahlem, who spoke along
lines of greater social service work.
Dr. Kenyon, supervisor of lectures
from Lyceum Bureau Training Camp

Anti-Tuberculosis association who
spoke In the Interest of public health.
Last spring the City Secretary, Pa

Find Work for Hundreds
The Employment Department has
been of invaluable service to the
community throughout the' year, con
tinuing the policy of receiving mem
berships into the association ' when
ever possible in return for services
rendered. A great number of women
'.and girls have been placed In posi
tions while many employers have had
their needs filled time and again. The
magnificant work performed by the
department of employment can well
be understood by a glance at the fig

, Entertainment for Soldiers '
In the Social Service Department
the'year has "been an active one with
Mrs. Richard Thomas as its chair
man. At the beginning of the war
it was decided by the board of di
rectors to make the Y. W. C. A. a
Community center for army men dur
ing the duration of the war. Social
environment for the men In the army
camps was decided to be "absolutely i
necessary. Special invitations were
extended to the soldiers through their
commanding officers stationed in
Douglas, Ft. Huachuca, Naco and
Lowell. Five large social affairs were
planned and given the boys during the
year. The girls of the home proved
most admidable hostesses frequently
entertaining the many who took ad
tan tage of the privilege afforded
them. Many expressions from army
men told of the great Influence that
it actually meant to them during the
camp life. These boys went to their
many homes recently in all parts of
the United States and they carried
with them a kindly feeling for Bis

in the
Love is tbe oldest and the newest
thing in the world. "AH the world
loves a lover," is an old saying, but
every girl in the springtime of her
life finds it is a new saying for her.
Of all the types -of lovers that my
varied experience in playing heroine
parts has brought me into contact
with, ' the hero type is perhaps my
favorite. If it ,seems strange that an
actress should be interested in the
men. who play the part of lover op
posite her, it must be remembered that
to do good work the actor must actual
ly "feel" the part they "are playing.
Because of this, I think L know how
vyious types of men make love.
The hero lover is the considerate
lover. A brave man is gentle to the
woman he loves. The hero lover, who
In battle or the struggle of life is the
"strong man" is to the woman to
whom he makes love rather afraid of
himself. The more a man is capable
of fijrbting the battles of the world
or of rife, the more afraid he is of the
women he loves. He is afraid of not
winning her.
We have four million heroes Coming
home to us now. and the girls to whom :
they will propose should not be sur-'
prised if the men who have done deeds '
of valor on the battlefield, or twno
were ready and anxious to do them if
called upon, are cowards when it
comes to asking for the "only girls."
If you have a hero lover and you
.know he wants to ask you "the ques
tion" this spring, don't -be too coy to
help him out a bit if you really want
him. Don't be too slow about, giv
ing him your hand if you see he really
wants to put the little gold band on
it. Remember that a hero is very
very human, and he may be very much
afraid of. just little YOU. That's my
impression of the hero lover as. he has
made love to me. '

latter at the home is not always as

cupants 140 transient roomers were
accommodated during the year. 132

Dormitory Opened Last June
The dormitory was opened for oc
cupancy in June before completion
and even with the Inconveniences
these quarters were quite popular
and there continued to be an aver
age from 12 to 20 girls during the
summer months. Since the renewal
of activities after the ilfing of the
influenza quarantine the occupants of
the dormitory have steadily increased.
Mrs. Walter Douglas made a visit
to the city last February while she
was representing a. branch of War

!been interested in the Bisbee asso
ciation and has never failed during
her visits to look into the welfare
of the local association. At the time
of her visit there was a great need
for more housing facilities for wom
en and girls. Mrs. Douglas immedi
ately become alive talb.enepds and
was quick to respond. Her splendid
plan was carried out to the letter
and as a result delightful sleeping
porches have been installed accom
modating about twenty-four girls. Tn
connection with these porches there
is a large, cheerful dressing room,
containing all the modern conven
iences, such as steam heat, with built
in dressers, leckers and huge mir
rors and a good sized lavatory with
hot and cold water. Only lately two
modern shower baths have been in
stalled and the dormitory and sleep
ing porches are the most modern in
the state. i
Reading, Waiting and Rest Room
Last week a small room upon the
top floor near the dormitory was fit-
tej: up with elegant furnishings andt
converted into a reading, writing andj
rest room. This filled a long felt
void as there seemed to be" a great
demand for such space among the
numben of girls not having the pri
vacy oi single rooms.
The finance department out of a
$34,000 budget only found it neces
sary to solicit a litle over $1000.00
from the business men of the city.
This, together with the regular
monthly rent from the cafeteria, the
membership fees and the home pay
ing, into the association amount aver
aging $64.10 per month over the sink
ing fund of $200, has enabled the de
partment to make the association
self-sustaining. The funds now avail
able from those sources are now. be
ing used to complete the necessary
furnishings for the new floor. Work
was comemnced on the new floor in
March, 1918, and it is now being com
pleted with the necessary furnish
ings. A year ago the association adopted
the slogan "A thousand members for
the Bisbee association and all help
toward this end." The membership
committee, Mrs. Cummings chairman,
planned three ; of four membership
campaigns but owing to the numerous
drives in conection with war worK
the campaign for members had to be
abandoned with only partial success
that covers only a small portion of
the district. The employment depart
ment has been a means of interesting
a great number of business men In
the work of the association.
Membership Doubles in Year '
In 1917 the association had but
300 members while to date the fig
ures might creep slightly over the 600
mark or just double the number had
in 1917. The membership committee
feels that every woman and girl in'
the district should become members i
of the Y. W. C. A. as the moral sup
port from such an army would mean
much toward carrying on a greater j
work than the association is iow
unable to accomplish without their
help. I

AVERAGE YANK GAINS
14 POUNDS OVERSEAS
EREST. May 17. The long, lean,
lank American .doughboy ubo went
'overseas took on 14 pounds physical
weight from the time of the first draft
until now. An officer of high rank
in the Amerldan arjny medical corps
says comparisons of average weight of
American soldiers in September, 1917,
and March, 1919, show many got hard,
some got fat 'and the.grand average
lay-on of muscle and flesh was 14
ponds.
This is on the basis of physical ex
aminations of hundreds of thousands'
of men. Husky outdoor life, lots of
exercise, plenty work, regular rations
of pure food sent from the United
State9, tells the story.
The same officer says French soldiers-
on the average gained weight
during the four years of war. Records
show the average poilu today weighs
six pounds more than the average
doughboy.
The Eclipse!
The big figure in tie eixthy-sixth
congress, after the sixthy-eixth really
gets under a full head of steam, will
be Frederiek Huntington Gillet of
Massachusetts, speaker of the house.
t
But for the present the limelight will
shine on Henry Cabot Lodge- of Mas
sachusetts, chairman of the senate
foreign relations committee, due to
take up the peace treaty and League
pf Nations Immediately after conven
ing. Public gaze will center on this
important senate committee and will
not be "detracted until the thing has
been threshed out and some recom
mendation made to the senate. The
house does rt pass ton the peace
treaty. Henry Cabot Lodge opposed
President Wilson's first draft of the
League of Nations. Where he and the
Republican majority will stand on the

the League of Nations, to come imme

Northern Part of Duke Field Gets Important Wells
, N . Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Friday, May 9, 1919
Our first well will start drilling May 26th, right in the heart of the biggest developments in the Texas oil fields,
and with producing wells jiear by on all sides it isn't a question of "Will e get oil" in this location it's merely
a matter of "How big a well can we expect?" Judging by the wells surrounding our lease we can confidently look
forward to from 1000 to 4000 barrels daily production while a gusher of the 10,000 barrel class is not at all un
likely. "
There are a few thousand shares of Texas Duke Stock left but the demand has become "so lively, due to the
sensational developments in the field and our own drilling activity, that we expect to go "over the top" any day.
Stock is now selling at $1 par but-will positively advance- when our well starts down on the 26th. From present in
dications there may be no stock left at that time.

62 ACRES IN THE WONDERFUL RANGER FIELD
Look at the map study it carefully with the Davis Well right
next to our 10-acre tract on the west, the Foote Well on the north, the
Harrington but a short distance southeast, with the Duke Extension,
the famous Duke, Knowles and a number of other BIG ONES to the
south and the new Moore Head to the southwest we caa say most em
phatically, that there's no question in our nilnds that WE'RE GOING
TO GET OIU
Not onlV are the wells in this field BIG ONES, but they produce
the highest gravity oil in Texas selling at S3.65 per barrel. Some ot
the well3 in this territory are making practically pure gasoline.
, Remember that ONE PRODUCING WELL, Is a FORTUNE MAK

Gaby Deslvs. wrio Has gained in
ternational fame &i a creator of beau
tiful and striking dances, and who is
now achieving distinction as an emo
tional actress, has for years aspired
to interpret the role of Juliet. This
may seem strange to those who have
seen Gaby when she popularized -her
self in America as the star of "Stop!
Look! Listen!" the New York suc
cess from the Globe theater, in which
she appeared from coast to coast with
Harry Pilcher; but, nevertheless, even
before she began her stage career.
she was fascinated by Shakespeare's
immortal creation.
I have read the most beautiful of
love tragedies over and over again,"
said Gaby recently, "and I have ,wet
the pages with my tears. In all of
the great kramas of youth, tof love.
and of exquisitely beautiful senti
ments, there is none to approach this
not even the work of any of our
great masters of French fiction.
Juliet was a dreaming child and
a profoundly loving woman in one
character the universal ideal. Ana
let me tell you, though some of my
friends banter
thinks she herself possesses. f
"That I am not selfish in claiming
all of these things myBelf I will say
that Juliet, the eternal, is. the. em
bodiment of every woman but every
woman is not the embodiment of
Juliet"
It may be that Gaby Deslys is well
on the road to the realization of her
ambition, for, she has the strongest
emotional part of her career in the '
latest Patne Special Feature, In
fatuation," a screen rendition of Mar
cel L'Herbier's delightful romance,
produced in France by- the Eclipse
company and directed by Louis Mer
canton. It will be shown at the
Grand theater.
To Gaby's developed emotional
power Mr. Mercanton bears enthus
iastic testimony and he speaks with
the highest authority, for it. was h

Thus far it has been definitely de

are other features contemplated.
During Governor Campbell's brief

Mr. Egan made an attempt to get the
governor to come here for the celebra
tion and give a speech of welcome to
the boys but the governor had made
previous arrangements to speak in
Prescott on the Fourth and as a result
some other speaker of state-wide
prominence will be sought to deliver

This has been demonstrated over and over again in
the history of the BURKBURNETT FIELD it
keepa a man busy to keep track of the successes
oi; the new wells that are coming in of the stock
offerings that are oversubscribed in a few hours.
This office has been identified with MANY of the
successes with no failures. Our clients have seen
1 00 per cent profits and from that to several hun
dred per cent profits. , ,
An illustration of the immense , prof its which can
be made is demonstrated by the OFFERING thru
our office of PENNSYLVANIA OIL & GAS in
Block 819 we made an offering of this stock one
day by wire at $45.00 every share that we offer
ed was .snapped up and PENNSYLVANIA was
oversubscribed at Wichita and today is selling at
$200 one of our clients sold and received $200
for his stock.
We sold our clients BANNER at $10 and those
who received as high a$ $40 for their stock.
We employ a salaried representative in the Burk
burnett field and in Fort Worth and we keep in
closest possible touch with . the market and can
inform our clients of the best offerings by wire
and we receive wire orders COLLECT.
In this BOOM the greatest in the history of
booms even wire commuication is tqo slow for
illustration we tried to get an offering of BLUE
BELL for our clients, but it was oversold before
our wire orders could be executed and it is selling
at 3 to 1. Our Wichita correspondent advises us
to put our clients into RED, BALL OIL at $1.50
par value $1.00 and capitalized for $75,000 he
wires us that it is being bought because of its lo"
cation in BLOCK 564within a quarter of a mile
from the "HAEMFA" well which has just come
in with an approximate production of 3000 barrels.
Their property lies within three quarters of a mile
of HUMBLE No. 1, HUMBLE No.2 and HUM
BLE No. 3 which have a total production of over
500 barrels. The property lies among the BIG
ONES. BURK-TEX OIL COMPANY is in the
same block with RED BALL they are .down 1400
feet and from wire today they have promise of a
fine well the well is actually gassing and the
drill Is on the oil sand is capitalized for $38,000
par value $25.00 and. selling around $100 a
share.
These surrounding properties make RED BALL
OIL at $1.50 a good buy it ought to climb.
JAGGERS-WALLACE OIL
At last we have got a communication from the company
through our salaried man at Fort. Worth the have promised
ns that they will make a dividend announcement by JMday of
this week they have stated to us positively that this dividend
that will be declared will -be one of the biggest ever declared
by a Texas oil company. They are paying 20 per cent now
their lust well brought in a few days ago brines their produc
tion up to 3,000 barrels daily 3,000 barrels at J2.00 net means
$6,000 net daily. Thirty days th net income would be $180,000
12 months on this basis would be $2,160,000 NET from oil
from the present five wells which are producing this would
enable them to pay a 200 per cent dividend.
JAGGEItS-WALLACK OIL' COMPANY is made up of progres
sive men and they guarantee to drill three wells more in North
west Burkburnett one in Block 86 and two in Block 71
they are also planning to drill two other wells in the Hanger
field, where they already have production.
We have given this company the closest possible investigation
we have spent a great deal of money through our repre
sentative in making a perrtonal" examination taking photo
graphsand in checking up their properties. Our last wire

STOCKS AND BONDS '
NEW YORK. May 17. Shippins
and rails were the outstanding fea
tures o ftoday's short but active stock
market session recovering gains of 1
to 5 ponts and retaining much oftheir
advance, despite week-end selling for
profits. ' x ;
Mercantile Marine common, ind .pre
ferred led the list in expectatldn of an
early announcement " rfayorable to
share holders and American Interna
tionals, which has large Marine hold
ings, was not. far behind. ".-
Yesterday's general advance in, rails
was continued in moderate degree.
Oils, motors and metals followed,
but United States steel pursued its
recent uncertain course, holding with
in fractional'' limits. Related issues
were less prominent. Sales amounted
to 750,000 shares.
General market news included fur
ther firmness in the metal market, en
couraging views of the mercantile
agencies and prospects of additional
capital issues in the coming wee.
The bank statement failed to re
flect to any extent the week's heavy
operations in stocks, actual loans, for
example, showing only a nominal de
crease, with a gain of about $14,600,
000 in excess reserves.
Bonds were firm, the Liberty group
developing greater strength on a fur
ther rise in Liberty 3's to $99.60..
Total sales, par value .aggregated
$6,650,000. Old United States fours
coupon rose per cent on call dur
ing the week."
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW .YORK, May 17. Propelled by
the broadest speculative inquiry Sirica
the beginning of the world war and
in many resjects without parallel in
trie country's histcry, the stock mar
ket this week ascended to new Iieights
seemingly without strain in any finan
cial quarter. There is ample evidence
that borowings have expanded enor
mously, especiall brokers' oans and
the absence of contro or supervision
of the money market by any constitut
ed authority has excited misgivings in
conservative "circles.
On the surface the only monetary
disturbance was caused by a belated
midweek demand for call money with
a resultant advance of 7z per cent,
but normal conditions were almost im
mediately restored. Even the com
plete collapse of foreign exchange on
France and Italy failed to arouse more
than languid interest except among
international bankers who, unable to
offer any reasons for thi sadverse
movement other than the long recog
nized economic conditions.
Bullish literature which circulated
the length and breadth of the land
emphasized such favorable factors as
the peace treaty terms, crop prospects,
the unqualified success of the Victory
loan and the coming session of con
gress. Conditions in the leading industries,
especially oils, shippings, leathers and
textiles, showed marked improvement,
but the full effect of an open market
for steel and iron is yet to be deter
mined. THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, May 17. Government
measures to curb large speculative op
erations in the corn market had a de
cided bearish effect today on values!
In the end, the market was unsettled
at 1 to 2 cents net decline, with
July $1.58 to $1.59 and September
$1.53 to fl.53. Oats finished to
1 cent down, and provisions varying
from 95 cents to 10 cents advance.
At first the weakness in the corn
market was only moderate, but during
the last hour selling became general,
and support was almost entirely lack
ing. Announcement that war time re
straints on, trading were again in or
der dominated sentiment from the out
set;, and made liolders increasingly
nervous, whereas sellers grew more
and .more aggressive. -
Oats ranged lower with corn, favor
able crop reports more than offsetting
seaboard inquiry.
Provisions were finally carried
down by the breaks in the grain mar
ket. Higher prices on hogs stimulat
ed, some buying, but then were lost
sight of.
WEEKLY BANK CLEARINGS
. NEW -YORK, May 17. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and

that they hold $49,717,820 reserve in

PICTURKMETEORIC
Harold Lockwood, who achieves the
greatest success ofl his brilliant
career in Screen Classics, Inc.s' big
super feature, "Pals First," ?s one of
the most popular actors of the screen.
His rapid rise to fame is unequalled
in the motion picture world. He ex
cels both as a comedian and a player
of romantic parts, and his versaltility
in this line has earned him an en
viable position in the motion picture
world. "Pals First," which Is a screen
version of the famoms Broadway stage
hit will be at the Eagle theater today
and tomorrow.
He was born in Brooklyn, N. Y.,
and later moved to Newark, New
Jersey, where his father owned and
managed a large stock farm and
raised and trained blooded horses.
But this life did not appeal to young
Harold and as soon as he graduated
from school he decided to become an
actor. He tried , the dramatic stage
for some time' but the screen proved
alluring. Adv.
