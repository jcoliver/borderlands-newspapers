this morning were battling their way toward less than three miles west of j
Cambrai after breaking into the enemy's last defense line at Annex andi
Cantaing yesterday. They were drawing in on Bourlon wood which dominates i
the entire section, including Cambrai.
British cavalry, tanks and infantry were today operating along a line
running from west of Cambrai to the south ol that town.
Meanwhile, the offensive had been successfully prosecuted on the left,
and in the region of Bullecourt the German line had been pushed back con
siderably, thereby widening the salient which the British have driven Into
the enemy territory to the south and southwest of Cambrai. The attack
around Bullecourt was a "complete success and something like 700 prisoners
were captured here."
Sanguinary hand-to-hand fighting has taken place at many points. During
the night three German counter attacks in Noyelle and Rumllly were
beaten off and another thrust by the enemy near Bullecourt was smashed.

Large Audience
Hears Singers
An audience of 400 people were
present at the second number of tbo
Warren district Lyceum course, given
at the hlpa school auditorium last
night by the Montague Light Opera
Singers. During the first part a num
ber of selections were rendered from
the latest light operas. As its name
Indicates, the company excels in the
class of entertainment it is present
ing. In the intermission between the first
and the second parts. Miss Altha Mon
tague gave a reading of Maeterlinck's
"Bluebird." The second and conclud
ing part was an especially written
Japanese "romance," presented to
give the Montague Singers an oppor
tunity to render acme of the best se
lections from "Mme. Butterfly" and
"The Mikado." It might be here re
marked that when these plays first
came out considerable criticism was
made of their portrayal of oriental
cuioms, dress, etc. However, the pur
pose was not dramatic, and anything
lacking in this line was of course
excused by the audience, who were
in attendance for the primary purpose
of hearing the musical repertoire of
the company and this was more than
pleasing, as the repeated encores
showed.

Sanguinary battles are In progress

armies of the Teutonic allies, greatly
superior in numbers, are arriving toj
break through the hill country to the

in them the Italians seemingly are
holding their own and inflicting severe
losses on the invaders.

capture of Monte Fontana and Monte

where a few advanced Italian lines
were reached the enemy everywhere
has been repulsed. Along the Piave

TOLD SHE'D BETTER
MAKE OUT HER WILL
Takes Tanlas and Now Feels
Like a New Woman Can
Do Her Own Housework
The remarkable results being ob
tained by the use of Tanlac Is further
evidenced in the case of Mrs. M. F.
Cunningha.it of 341S Humboldt street,
Denver, Col., who in recently telling
the sttiry of her recovery from a se
rious complication of troubles said:
"A little over two years ago I began
to have trouble with my stomach and
I would get so tired and fagged out 1
couldn't get through with my little
housework without having to stop and
lie down five or six times during the
day. I could nt touch meat nor
drink either tea or coffee, and was
put on a diet of the lightest kind of
food. After eating I felt like there
was a burning fire right in my cim
and I suffered agonies for hours. My
food soured in my stomach and rorm
ed gas and my heart would palpitate
like it would jump out of my body,
My blood pressure went up to an
alarming point and my heart acted -o
strangely I was told I had better make
out my will. I was so nervous I could
hardly sleep and many a time 1 lay
awake all night Kng suffering and
worrying about my condition. I vas
getting so thin and peaked my neigh
bors were all talking about it and ask
ing what in the world was 'he matter
with me.
"I had tried many other meiicine3
without getting any relief, and after
Tanlac was put on sale in Denver and
everybody got to talking about it, I
decided to try it, too. I noticed a de
cided improvement soon after I started
on it and after my second bottle I act
ually felt like a new person. I have
taken four bottles now and I can eat
most anything I want. I have been
relieved of that burning sensation I
had in my chest, gas has stopped form
ing, and the pressure has been relieved
so my heart does not palpitate like it
did. My nerves are quiet and my
sleep la delightfully refreshing. I am
so much better and stronger I can now
do my own' housework without getting
all .tired-out and having to stop to rest
and I am now convinced that all my
suffering was caused by my disordered
stomach. Tanlac has done me more
good than anything I have ever taken
and my relief is due to nothing else
but this great medicine."

A Keen Criticism
Arthur Scbultz, of the Topeka State Journal, one of
the most astute and able political writers in the west,
interviewed Congressman Phil Campbell of Kansas on
governmental conditions generally and like Lord North
cliffe, has much fault to find with certain things, whirb
he sets forth in the following fashion in his paper:
Flattery of the national administration, paid press
agents, incompetent and seventh rate cabinet members
will never win the war for the United States. That was
the criticism of the existing war policy of the govern
ment today by Congressman Phil P. Campbell of the
Third Kansas district The Third district congressman
declared the war would not be won by accident and that
debating societies must be dismissed from government
service and the best brains of the nation employed to
direct the war program and make use of the men and
materials at the disposal of the administration for the
best results.
Congressman Campbell's indictment of the national
program is the first direct attack on the war program by
a member of the Kansas congressional delegation. His
criticism was directed against the four cabinet members
directly in charge of the war program the secretary of
war, secretary of the navy, secretary of state and attor
ney general.
"The best brains of the nation must be employed to
win this war," said Campbell. "This isn't a time for re
taining political favorites in places of great responsibility
they are not fit to fill. We must have the best the nation
has, just as Germany for forty years before the war en
listed her greatest and most able men to perform the
service of which they are most capable.
"It is time for the people of this country and tht
press of the country to get away from soft toned flattery
of the national administration and to look conditions
6quarely in theace. We must bury the theory that the
king can do no wrong. It is time to get rid of highly
paid press agents who laud the president and the cabinet
with praise. This war affords no time or place for flat
tery. What this nation needs today and must have is
results."
- Commenting on cabinet members. Congressman Camp
bell declared a reorganization of the four important
cabinet places was absolutely necessary. Of Attorney
General Gregory, the Kansan declared:
"The president has for his attorney general a seventh
rate lawyer. We can't afford to retain political favorites.
We need big men, the biggest men the country has to
offrr. Ocr sous and our brothers are In the war, and
mutit fight to win. They ought to have the best that can
be made. And this couutry is entitled to know something
of the facts.
"It is high time to dit-perse the debating societies and
discharge (be press agents. It is time to know how
many ships are building and when they will be ready
to sail. It is time to know how many aeroplanes ar
buildiDg and wheu they will fly. It is time to know how
much ammunition we have available and when we will
have more. It is time to know the number of trucks
under construction and when they will be delivered. It
Is time to know something of the arms being manufac
tured and, when our boys will be equipped. The country
has a right to know the results -which are being ob
tained. Asked concerning the length of the war. Congressman
Campbell declined to venture a prediction.
"I have no idea how long the war will last." said
Congressman Campbell. "We are in this war, and we
will stay in until it is won."
"Thfs'war won't be won by accident," said Campbell.
"It will be won through a definite program and by tho
efforts of the best men of our nation. Of all the inven
tions railed before the attention of that special com-ri'Ut-o,
I do not rard one of tbem as of sufficient im
portance of value to give more than passiug concern."

letter, you'll waste the paper and a 3-cent stamp; don't
send them anything to eat, they might get the stomach
ache; don't tell them you admire their spirit, it might
make them vain; above all. don't send them any tobacco.
Not more than ninety-nine out of every one hundred use
tobacco and they don't amount to much. Save your
money and buy another farm. Little acts of kindness
never helped anybody anyway.

Gabriele D'Annunzio, Italy's famous author, dramatist
and writer, has failed to return from a recent flight over
the enemy lines in northern Italy, and is undoubtedly
lost D'Annunzio has been known aa one of Italy's great
est fighting aviators. If D'Annunzio is dead his friends,
frenziedly seeking word from the war office, will regard
his sacrifice as a fitting climax to his career. They
pointed out that D'Annunzio, always the poet, the artist
and lover of the beautiful, has been fighting to save
Venice, the art jewel of the world. They believed thj t
D'Annunzio himself, if he could have chosen a death,
would have preferred thus to perish in defense of that
city. He did as much, if not more than any one man.
to bring Italy into the war on the side of the allies.
When the Austro-German hosts that had chased the
Italians from beyond Bainsizza plateau clear to the Piave

they paused. And they are still motionliess. The Prus

work the big guns. There is a disgusting accuracy about
their fire that stays his forward 'eet. He is a great
jaan, is the Prussian, in the eastern and southern and
central portions of Europe, but in the west he Is just s
Prussian. For two thousand years the British have been
known as the pluckiest blood in Europe and the French
as the most war-like. The Prussian is a corking good
fighting man, no mistake about that, but his Invinci
bility is mere piffle before the glare of French eyes and
the unwavering glance of the Britisher, the Scotchman
and the Irish.

THRIFT AS WAR'S BY-PRODUCT
The president writes to the chairman of the War
Savings committee that he supposes we have, as a nation,
wasted more than we are about to spend in the war, and
that if the war teaches us thrift it will be worth the
cost on a calculation of money alone, says the New
York Times. As we are spending billions, that sounds
extravagant until two things are considered. War is
temporary, and there is an end to its costs. Thrift is a
matter of character, and descends from generation to
generation. And the lesson of thrift is to be taught to
so many millions that trifling sums saved by each of
them make billions for all of them quickly. Already
there are 10,000,000 bondholders among us. If the num
ber should be doubled at the next loan offering, that
would be smaller increase than from less than one in a
hundred of us as investors to one in ten. When the
savers run up to 20,000,000 or more, a mere $50 apiece
gives a billion, and the saving of $50 shows how to
save in larger sums.
r
It has been thought thrifty for children to put. rents
into a bank. But the cents in a bank are idle, and the
cents put into war savings certificates will earn at the
rate received and appreciated by millionaires. The sums
saved are small individually, but they tneau more even
to the individual than the large total means to the nation.
Good savers are careful spenders. That is where the
thrift comes in. The saver of cents fs a spender ot
dollars, and the spending will be grudged if it starves
the saving.
The president confined his suggestion, to money con
siderations because he was writiug in connection with
the war savings certificates, but it is possible to remark
an added attraction in the bale of these rertilh'ates.
WJioeer holds them will he a better ritiicu. more ap
preciative of what the government docs for him and
more zealous in its defense agaiiiht attacks. Before
the war we had been thiiiklng more of profits than'of
savings, and bad not been thinking enough of the gov
ernment By turning our thoughts in another direction
there are more byproducts than the president mentioned,
aqd their valuo is greater than that of the certificates
which tanked hi j remarks.

l Our President, recognizing a time-honored custom, has named Thurs-
; day, November 29, as a day of thanksgiving and prayer and invites the
people of our broad and prosperous land to abstain! on that day, from
J their labors and draw closer, in a spirit of humility and re-dedication of
service to our God and our Nation.
J The fearful conflict now raging throughout the civilized world is
about to witness the fourth anniversary of Thanksgiving Day, hallowed
by our Pilgrim Fathers at Plymouth. This year finds our country in the
throes of the same struggle, involving the destiny of Liberty. We are
chastened and quickened in our love for our fellow men; possessed of a
lew and more vigorous outlook on humanity and rendered more rea
sonable and human by the beacon light of Duty shed upon us by sacrifices
at home and from battlefields afar.
Wherefore, I, Thomas E. Campbell, Governor of Arizona, do hereby
proclaim Thursday, the 29th day of November, 1917, as a day of thanks
and prayer for God's blessing on our arms in America and overseas.
And particularly on this day, let us not forget the families whose
beards are desolated by the absence of loved ones, called to war. May
we not invite them to partake in our share of the bounteous harvests of
this yea and join In our solemn vows te Almighty God, our King, to live
righteous, abstemious lives, whereby the end of this strife may be brought
nearer, that we may soon again enjoy the blessings of peace and re-united
families at the hearthsides of the American Nation. Let us take them to
our hearts and give them substantial proofs of our love, obligation and
comradeship.
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the great
seal of the State of Arizona to be affixed.
Done at Phoenix, the Capital, this 20th day of November, 1917.

to cross the river near that place, on
his way home from the home of a
neighbor a few nights ago, fell from
a high bank of the river, a height of
about 25 feet, and was badly bruised
and shaken up. He lost the trail in
the darkness and where he was at
tempting to cross the river was al
most perpendicular, except for a ledge
half way between the top and bottom,
which broke the fall to some extent
and probably saved his life. The place
where the accident happened was
about a quarter -! a mile from his

Any good cook can' make a first rate cake with

Yet there is a way to make perfectly delicious cake

Use rich, pure Cottolene. Keep to your recipe.
But instead of using butter, use Cottolene one-third
less than you would ordinarily use of butter.

who have found that Cottolene because of its greater
richness goes farther than other shortenings which
they had been using.
See if you don't make a cake that you are proud of.
If you could taste the delicious cakes, flaky pies
and pastries, crisp biscuits, tender muffins and -digestible
fried things that rich Cottolene makes, we
are quite sure you would use Cottolene in all your
frying and in all your baking.
Wholesome Cottolene produces perfectly delici
ous results. It combines true economy with better
cooking.
Try it in any familiar recipe and sec. Cottolene
is sold by grocers in tins of convenient sizes.

Eases Quickly When You Apply
a Little Musterole.
And Musterole won't blister like the
oU-iashioned mustard plaster. Just
cpread it on with your fintyrs. It pene
trates to the sore spot with a gentle
ihle, loosens the congestion and draws
out the soreness and pain.
Musterole is a clean, white ointment
v.zde with oil of mustard. It is fine fcr
ruick relief from sore throat, bronchitis,
toncilitis, croup, stiff neck, asthma, neu-
riia, headache, congestion, pleurisy,
rheumatism, lumbago, pains and aches of
the back cr joints, sprains, sore muscles,
bruises, chilblains, frosted feet colds on
the chest (it often prevents pneumonia).
Nothing like Musterole for croupy chil
dren. Keep it handy for instant use.
