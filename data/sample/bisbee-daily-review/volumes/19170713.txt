COLUMBUS, N. M., July 12. Near

today arrived here about 9 o'clock to
night F. B. King, division superin
tendent of the El Paso & Southwest
era raili'oad, was in charge, and was
arrested by the local authorities for
bringing in the deportees. He was
later released.
Local authorities refused to permit
the men to be unloaded here. The
army officer in command here, who
had not Issued any orders up to the
time o ftheir arrival, threw out a
strong guard about the military es
tablishment
The house bill as amended and pend
ing in the senate and greatly restrict
ed substitute prepared Dy senator
Gore as a compromise were discussed
at leneth and the president agreed to
study both measures in detail and re
port his conclusions. It Is understood
he was told that the pending bill as
amended to extend government con
trol over iron, steel .copper, cotton
and other products in addition to food
pnd fuel must be materially changed
if It is to have a chance of passaee.
Prohibition was not discussed at
leneth with the president except as it
incidentally affects federal revenues
and the war tax bill. It was predict
ed that no action would be taken by
the president on that feature and that
the prohibition compromise probably
would be developed in conference.
More Leaders Arrested
GLOBE. July 12. Eight more strike
leaders were arrested here late today
and tonight on the blanket warrant
charging' 83 strikers with rioting on
July 2. Six of the strikers were in jail
tonight and the remainder released
on bonds. These latter included Rod-
; ger S. Culver, Miami agitaflbr for I. w.
W., and George Smith, secretary or
the local miners' union. -
Fear. Jhat a round up of I. W W.
leaders and sympathizers would he
made caused much uneasiness here
tonight especially among the strik
ers. It was reported that another
wholesale deportation might occur
here at any time and that arrest of the
15 strike leaders was thought to be
the beginning of this round up, but
everything was quiet tonight and no
further arrests had been made by the
sheriffs department However,- a
number of strike leaders are expected
to be placed in jail during the night
ami tomorrow.
The Loyalty league Issued a state

ASHINGTONJuly 12. The fed
eral government is watching
closely the Industrial Workers
of the World disorders In Ari
zona and other wester nstates but of
ficials here expect no far-reaching con
sequences. Department commanders
of the army have been instructed to
take all steps necessary and there la
entire confidence here that they will
sneedily do so.
Apparently little credence has been
given reports' that a concerted upris
ing by the organization was to be at
tempted. The first official word reaching the
federal government from the disturb
ed sections came tonight in a request
fiOm Governor Campbell of Ariiona
asking for the assistance of federal
troops in maintaining order. The re
quest was referred back to Brigadier
General Parker, commanding UnJ
southern division.
At a late hour eneral Parker had not
reported any troop movements.
At the labOr department no word
had been received late tonight from
the federal mediators sent to the
states affected to attempt settlement
of strike troubles. Press reports say
ing that they had recoramenceit ac
tion by the federal government to
prevent Industrial paralysis led to the
belief that tomonOw might see somi
more drastic step by officials here
It was declared every resource of
the government would be used if nec
essary to quell the disturbances.

Governor Campbell's telegram to tho
president Included a full report of the
proceedines at Bisbee during the last
thirty-six hours. After stating that the
situation was sufficiently critical as to
call for federal intervention at Bisbee,
Clifton. Morenci. Ray, Humboldt, Je
rome, and Ajo the governor said:
"With not less than 5.000 members
of the I. W. W. scattered throughout
the state fomenting their propacanda,
to bring about the recognition of their
organization, 75 per cent of the metal
production of the state is at a stand
sill, the situation is sufficiently ser
ious to call for federal investlatlon
and firm action. Without state troops
st my command, local communities
are dependent upon themselves for
protection and without federal assist
ance we may look for action similar
to that at Jerome and Bisbee."
What action the rovernor will take
will depend upon the reply of the
president which as yet has not been
received. With the national guard in
the federsl service, the governor could
not enforce martial law except
through a posse comitatus and there

THE BI5BEE DAILY REVIEW, FRIDAY MORNING, JULY 13, 1917.
here is method
TO BE USED FOR
DRAFT DRAWING
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 12. Draw ng
of lots for the selective draft not only
will determine what men are to be
called to the colors in the first war
army but will show in what order the
others registered will be liable for ser
vice when later armies are organized.
It was revealed tonight that a plan
of drawing will be followed under
wh ch a definite place in the waiting
lists will be given every one of the
millions who registered. Those stand
ing at the head of the list in each coun
ty tor city district will be called first
before the exemption boards and then
the obligat on will pass on down the
line as long as men are needed.
Feature Outlined
This does not mean that a separate
name or number will be drawn for
every one of the country's 9,000,000
registrants. ' In fact, every number
drawn until the theory of the plan will
represent more than 000, one ?or
each registration district. Details of
the system have not been made pub
lic but an outl ne of its principal feat
ures follow:
Every registration board has num
bered the cars in its possession in red
ink, beginning at number one and
continuing o a number corresponding
w th the total in the district.
In this drawing numbers will be
used from number one to the total in
the largest district.
Drawing to Be Public
The first number will determine
what man in each district 8 to be
taken first. If the card is number
10 it indicates that the man in each
district holding olcal card number 10
will be called for examination before
any of the other men in that district.
In that second number drawn will de
termine what man in each district
and so on es men are needed.
The drawing will be public and eacD
number will be announced as it is
drawn. Whenever a number beyond
the total in any given district comes
out it will Operate as a blank for that
district.
.The drawing probably will be held
during the week of July 23 in the big
Reception room of the war depart
ment adjoining Secrerary Baker's of

NEW YORK, July 12. Stocka re
ceived a severe jolt at the opening of
today's market, leading issues falling
two to almost six points on President
"Wilson's warning that fair prices must
prevail during the war. Rallies ensu
ed almost immediately on anounce
ment that equitable arrangements had
been effected between the government
and the chief industrial interests of
the country.
Call loans rose to 4 per cent from
the opening quotation of 2 per cent.
Time money was not effected; if any
thing, an easier tendency was noted.
Shippings suffered more than any
other shares in the early selling which
came mainly from professional quar
ters. United States Steel broke 24 to 125
and affiliated stocks declined 1 to 3
points, but in this division substantial
improvement soon set in, other equip
ments, including motors, oils, sugars
and fertilizers sharing in the rise.
Rails were steady to strong through
out, though gains were nominal for
the most part. Low grade carriers, es
pecially Missouri Pacific, Wabash and
Texas Pacific were in demand and
Rock Islands were not effected by re
ports of renewal of Internal dissen
sion. ,
Total sales, 890,000 shares.
Firmness ruled in the general bond
market, but the Liberty issue fell at
a new low quotation the price ranging
from par to 99 450 for regular lots
and 99 44-50 for an odd lot. Total
sales, par value, $2,880,000.

the topmost figure ever known, 1934
a bushel. The market as a whole clos

and December to 116U.
Wheat gained one cent net, finishing
easy, 204 for July and 1924 for Sep

and provisions varying from 12 decline
to a rise of 40 cents.
Estimates that the North Dakota
crop of wheat this season would be

bullish effect on the wheat market.

NEW YORK, July 12. A few spec
ialty issues recorded betterment to
day but the average of the standard
issues, especially in - the industrial
section showed depreciation in value
compared with yesterday's finals. The
financial district was somewhat ex
ercised over the president's appeal to
business interests along the lines of
his intimations that exhorbitant profits
growing out of the traffic in the vital
necesities of life would not be tolerat
ed during the war period. Naturally
business interests interpret this de
velopment to mean that a price fixing
program may be Inaugurated, which
in the final analysis, will impair to a
probable material extent net returns
of corporate enterprises.
In conjunction with a proceedure of
this kind, one must not forget that a
heavier impost on excess profits will
also be levied. Therefore it is logical
to venture the opinion that In the fu
ture, lessened prosperity in other
i words smaller earnings will be more
the rule.

Friday Morning, July 13, 1917.
Never, since the mountains raised their heads to
look down in this pleasant valley, have they seen such
a display of patriotism and high-minded public spirit
St they witnessed in the dawning of Wednesday morn
ing when the 3,000 armed citizens marched forward in
'defense of their town, it industries, its business, its
homes and its honor word to the nation.
Led by Harry C. Wheeler, sheriff of Cochise county,
and his lieutenants picked from every walk' of life in this
community, and ayJed by 1.OC0 good men and true from
our sister city of Douglas, these citizens arose in their
just wrath and their righteous might and, at one stroke,
in one hour, broke the power of the I. W. W, the "wob
blier" the agitators, the idlers, the wreckers and the
open sympathizers and abettors of this scum in the War
ren District forever.
The time had come to strike or be stricken, and
the Bisbee citizens who had been watching the situation,
hour by hour, since it started, knew it. Every induce
ment, plea and promise of protection possible had been
made to the men to go back to work. Every man had I
been drawn from the bad and dangerous company he had
elected to keep that could be induced to come. It was no
longer a question of patience, or of loss of money, or of
a desire to exhaust every honest effort, IT WAS A QUES
TION OF BEATING THESE FOREIGN TERRORISTS
AND PROFESSIONAL AGITATORS AND STRIKERS
TO IT.
The time had conje to bruise the head of) the serpent.
The policies of peace had failed. The Mexicans were
beginning to parade by the hundred. The "wobblies"
were beginning to show their teeth. Their dupes were
beginning to get hungry. And the citizens, who were
watching every move of their enemy, every mood, every
turn, every ripple, KNEW THAT THEY MUST STRIKE
QUICKLY AND HARD1
And never was there such a blow with all the power
of unity and concerted action behind it.
Douglao and Bisbee walking hand in hand to sweep
their streets and brush their hearthstones.
Out of the dawn marched these citizens, like phan
toms in the shadows cast by the mountains. The "wob
bly" pickets had just gone on duty. "Forward, men!" was
the cry of the officers; and lo, they were upon them, like
a storm, from five different training camps.
The surprise was as complete as though these depu
ties had descended from the heavens. The "wobblies'
reeled like drunken men. They were more than sur
prised; they were dazed. They threw up their hands
at command and held them aloft while they were
searched. They were herded in throngs and held there
by hundreds who hemmed them in with rifles. They
cheered a little, but it was a weak cheer and soon died

VUgh Job of it. If these terrorists
wanted war, W were to have it. If these vermin
wanted idleness, they were tohave it in box cars and not
upon the public streets of Bisbee.
A few "wobblies" resisted with their hands and were
punished by hands. One "wobbly" resisted with a weapon
and he died by a weapon. One deputy, O. P. McRae
and his name will be honored upon this townsite as long
as it stands gave up his life in defense of his country
and his home.
Only the united, dominant, resolute, resistleus bear
ing of the deputies prevented heavy loss of life upon our
streets yesterday. The "wobblies" heading this strike,
most of them, had records for violence. They did not
lack either the brute courage or desperation of outlawry.
The surprise up-jet and dismayed them, and the num
bers and spirit of the deputies overawed them. They re

march to Warren for deportation to jibe a ilttle and

jeer a little. .But it was only a little, and their former
strident tones were low.
It was the greatest morning's work since a pick was
frist struck in this canyon.
It was a blow at traitons, spies and anarchists that
will make this clique tremble everywhere west of the
Rocky Mountains.
The marching feet of these 3,000 men in Bisbee yes
terday sounded the death knell of "wobblyiam" and the
I. W. W. in Arizona. It was a deportation upon a stag
gering scale. It was Bisbee's answer to the impudent,
arrogant effort of a lawless lot of outcasts to dictate her
industrial and business affairsthe greatest copper city
in the world to the blackest and most infamous organl
zation in the world. And, long withheld, it could only
be one kind of an answer one that would be heard a
far as copper is mined between these oceans.
And how can we name properly or praise properly
tnese men who came forward, at the risk of their lives
to clean their city these merchants, miners, doctors, law
yers, bankers, clerks, office men, professional and la
boring men ' young men and old men, who left their
families by darkness and their work and their business
by daylight, to advance upon and arrest and deport nearly
1,200 desperate, lawless, defiant men; these men who
were called at that hour in the morning when, even
brave soldiers declare, their courage is at the lowest.
and who failed not; these minute men of 1917?
July 12 will stand always as a big day for Bisbee.
It is osly two days removed from the French liberty day,
for July 14 the Bastile fell. The baatile of labor unrest
without a just grievance fell in this southwest country
yesterday. And it will never be built again by the shak
ing, unclean hands of the I. W. W. and their crew.
And for Harry C. Wheeler, the sheriff of Cochise
county, the man who was responsible for and led the
drive that resulted in the greatest number of arrests
ever made in one day by any sheriff, high or low, in this
country or the old to him goes the honor and recogni
tion of all who love their homes and respect high-minded,
courageous officials. Yes, and more than this, the quiet,
genial, modest, soft-spoken little sheriff has won the ad
miration of men who are hard judges of manhood. No
one can properly appreciate the great responsibility this
sheriff unflinchingly assumed when he decided that the
drive should be made last night. No one could foresee
what the dawn was to usher in. It required more than
mere courage to make this decision and carry it through
with such success, firmness and skill. It required force
of character and cool, sound Judgment and leadership
and resolution ' and firm faith in the principles upon
which he based his action.
It takes a great deal to rouse a city until it will pour
the bulk of its citizens down streets of danger with
weapons in their hands, seeking a horde of fierce men.
Those from a distance will likely both praise and blame;
according to their lights, their leanings and their know!
edge, they will think we were harsh and they will think
we were patriotic But we who have lived in the midst
of this unrest eince the first of the year, and who know
its origin and its flimsy pretexts and its despicable and
dangerous methods, know that we were too patient in
the first place, and we know that we took the only means
possible to deal with our intolerable situation. . And in
the end we know, and this is the finest thought of all,
that if we were firm we were aso humane, and that if
we took extreme measures, we took them in a way true
to the best traditions of American citizenhood. .. v. ...
Notes On the
Big Drive
THE DEATH SENTENCE
The "Wobblies." all unsuspecting
bad an unusually heavy picket in front
of the postotfice the fateful morning
of the twelfth. With the deputies
first rush on this line the battle in
Bisbee proper was won. Encouraged
by their maiden success here, these
raw and undisciplined levies began
unconsciously tt assume a more soldier-like
air. They were invincible by
the time the march to the loading sta
tions started.
An old time Arizonan was looking on
at the busiest down town corner.
"Wonder if I better get my gun?" he
half questioned a deputy standing
near.
"Sure," said the deputy.
"Alright. 111 get old Betsy," replied
the man, and he went away and scAn
returned with a Colt's pistol two feet
long that looked to carry a ball the
size of a walnut
Speaking of heroes, we do not want
the Review newsboys overlooked.
These youngsters, ranging in age from
10 years to 13, were on the job before
daylight. And when the Review came
out with Sheriff Wheeler's proclama
tion at 6:30 on the dot .these boys
were straining like hounds on the leash
to get on the dangerous streets with
their wares. It was with difficulty
they were held back to less danger
ous ground.
"Bill' Cleary, local attorney, was
among those deported. He chose an
open work car in which to ride and
64 "Wobblies" were placed with him
for fear he would get lonesome. They
were due for en oratorical treat be
fore that car reached its destination
It was remarkable there was not a
hitch in such & big program planned
so suddenly and executed so quickly
and successfully.
Brewery Gulch is not what it used
to be.
Bisbee's claim that the I. W. W. out
fit are undesirable citizens is being
borne out by the loud and violent pro
tests' from other communities and from
sister states against the reception of
this interesting colony.
If a man prefers a box car to a good home it Is bis
own business. Every one to his hobby. And yet there
are some men who prefer to work.
t Pretty big contract to eat 1,600 reds of the I. W. W.
for breakfast on a summer morning, but Bisbee did it,
and never had a more satisfactory meal in her life.
The "martyrs to the cause of labor" are now on their
way. They no longer infest our streets and sidewalks
and corners, nor do they intimidate our workingmen with
their threats.
And the women who stayed at home, bravely and
uncomplainingly, yet with white, anxious faces, what of
them? After aJL the women play both the braver and
the greater part. Man goes forth to kill or be killed with
the eyes of the world upon him and stirred to heights by
marching feet and cheers. But the woman sits alone
and wrestles with her grief and fears in a darkened
room. She has only her sublime faith to sustain her
as she waits to bear the best or the worst from those
she loves. Waiting saps courage and multiplies fear.
But she waits, and her courage fails not. The praise
goes to the men who venture forth in a great cause, but
th, women at borne play the harder part.
It looked easy, that job of yesterday morning, but it
wasn't. It was all In the way it was done. Courage wai
necessary to make the decision, careful organization was
necessary alone; and sound judgment and dash and in
itiative just at the right time. It looked easy because
the "wobblies" milled like sheep under the threatening
muzzles of hundreds of rifles that encircled them. Bui
make no mistake, if there had been any marked indeci
sion or confusion or desertions from the- ranks, these
fellows would have started a reign or terror in the heart
of the city as quick as a wink. No set of men who will
fly in the face of a community and defy the United States
government are to be despised in a street riot. And
another thing that must not be overlooked in consider
ing the cheapness and comparative ease with which the
victory was won; to get that ring of rifles at the right
spot at the right time was the big thing. Once this Is
done, almost any battle is over before it is started. "Ikt
unto the other fellow what be would like to do to you,
only do it first." said David Ha rum.
Talking it over was the order 'of the
evening. But it was noticeable there
was do vain boasting anywhere by
anyone. Men just rubbed their hands
and grinned over a good job well done.
Eleven hundred and ninetv-two is a
good round number.
The detachment that made the raid
through the Gulch claimed their sec
tor was the most dangerous but the
troops on the Lowell sector took issue
with them. Looks like a draw.
V Those old Krags got awful heavy
before the 'marchers reached Warren.
"Mine weighed 40 pounds," declared
a young deputy.
Some moving picture man missed
the film of his life on the street yes
terday morning in front of the post
office. Three or four hundred "Wob
blies huddled there guarded by depu
ties from the street and from the
mountain side. Batches of prisoners
coming in every few moments. Pa
trols moving to and fro. Reserves in
line. It was a thriller.

Striking Miner
Is Nabbed for
Cursing Nation
mm mm
(By Review Leased Wire).
GALLUP, N. M., July 12. Repre?
sentatives of the Gallup-American
Fuel company, in conference with fed
eral Mediator II. II. Seldomridge of
Colorado Springs, today refused to
grant either recognition to contract re
lations to the meniber3 of the United
Mine Workers formerly employed in
their mines here, who recently went on
strike.
One of the strikers, said to be a
German, was bound ovpr to the fed
eral grand jury today ivr cursing the
United States and President Wilson.
When reprimanded the man is said to
bave drawn a knife and to have been
subdued only by a considerable show
of force.
Mr. Seldomridge announced his pur
pose here was to gather information
on the cause of the strike and on local
conditions for the department of labor.
A number of men returned to work to
day, oflicials of the company said. The
first shipment of coal sent out since
the strike was called was delivered
today.
. The strike was called as a result,
miners say, of abrogation by the pres
ent owners of a contract wun me
United Mine Workers made by the
Victor-American Fuel company, whicu
formerly owned th,e mines. The pres
ent owners took possession only a
short time ago.
The annual ruArt of the German
American Petroleum company of Ham
burg for 1916 shows net profits of
150,500, compared w ith $451,500 In Hie
previous year, causing reduction in
dividend to 1 1-2 per cent from 20 per
reat.
More cattle for the range and more
range for the cattle is the latest order
of the forestry department, in connec
tion with the national defense coun
cil's plans to increase the beef supply.
The grazing areas of the forests will
be extended to the narrowest margin
of conservation and if possible room
made for more than double the head
of cattle now feeding in the forest preserves.
Hitherto the forestry department
following the government's forestry
policy of conservation, have held back
a certain margin of the grazing areas
from the grazing permits in order to
conserve them for the future. No cat
tle have been entered on these reser
vations while the open areas have been
more than ample for the herds entered.
Under the new plan nearly every bit
of the grazing areas will be opened
in the national forests after a careful
investigation and preparation is made
to see that none of the areas are over
crowded and none would be perman
ently damaged by the cattle. A mar
gin of conservation will be maintained
but it will be much narrower than
heretofore.
From the district forest office at Al
buquerque four experts will leave
shortly for the nortuern Arizona and
New Mexico forests and work over all
the grazing land in the forests and
to lay out a plan for the intensive use
'jf the areas.
They will make a rapid but thor
ough investigation and report upon
the possibility of placing more rattle
in these areas. The experts are II ill.
Roberts, Talbot and Bryan.
Hugh Bryan of the quartet has just :
completed a special grazing study of
the Santa Ritas and Huachucas, cover
ing the entire range itself, tracing out
the relations of every rancher to the
great service and every detail Kit graz
ing areas which lie put into a com
prehensive plan for grazing in these
mountains fur the next nve years.
Mr. Bryan will start this week for
the Santa Fe national forest to devel
op a similar plan and, to carry on the
new work under the national delen.se
program.

: as called yesterday afternoon to dis
I cuss the best ways and means of find-
ing and relieving the distressed fam
i lies who have been left in the dis

j the recent strike.
j It was decided to make a fhorougb

! to report all cases to the Warren Dis
trict Relief Association when their
!?ctual necessities will be supplied. It
is the special wish of the Mining
; Companies that cone of these families
I shall suffer, and any cases that are re- j
! ported to the association will have tne I
best cf attention. '
I Father Mandin, Mrs. Nora Budd and
j Mrs. Fred Juliff have already begun
! investigating the cases of need among
I the Mexican residents of the District.
I The association maintains office
j hours between 8 a. m. and 5 p. m. Red
i Cross workers are asked to aid in the
relief work. They ran offer their ser
vices at the office of the association
in the Central school or by telephon- j
ing 443. Any fairly good clothing
would be appreciated by the associa
tion. Arrangements have been completed
for the provisioning of needy families
in the District and delivery will be
made direct once the status of the
case is shown.

I this way: Strain through a fine cloth
;the juice of two fresh lemons into a

of orchard white, then shake well and
you have a whole quarter pint of skin
and complexion lotion at ab'out the

into the bottle, then this lotion will

BiSCREDITED ARMY

j Entire Austrian Line May Be
Forced to Retire as Result
of Successful Drive cf the
! Russians.
(By Review Leased Wire).
PETROGRAD, July 12. In the cap
ture of Halicz the Russian revolu
tionary army, so' discredited during
the last few months, has reached in a
single move the objective fought Tor
so stubbornly but without success by
General Brussiloff's triumphant forces
of last summer in a long and arduous
campaign. This fact means the defi
nite piercing of the Austro-German
lines on a broad front, and not mere
ly a local penetration, which was ac
complished by the first Russian vic
tory we.st of Tarnopol.
Th activity of the Russian armies
has spread from Tarnopol to the Car
pathians and they are steadily push
ing forward on a continuous front
more than 100 miles long.
Lemberg is now open to attack from
Haliez. It is also likely that the Aus
trian line, which has long been based
on the Gnila Lipa river, will be forced
to retire, and as the Russian move
ment develops in the direction of Lem
berg it is sure to have an effect from
the situation In the Kovel-Vladimir-1
Yolyns region.
