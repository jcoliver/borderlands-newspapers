Germany Making Efforts p
Show Bankruptcy, Says
Chairman of Budget Com
mission in Chamber
Recommends Investigation to
Be Followed by Fixing Size
of Installments to Be Asked
of Defeated Nation
PARIS. Feb. 6. (By the Associated
Press.) Germany is making utmost
efforts to have the allies believe that
she is nearing bankruptcy, declared
Raoul Peret, chairman of the budget
commission of the chamber of depu
ties and former minister of justice, in
discussing today the financial prob
lems facing the peace conference.
The first measures of the conference
along financial lines, he added, should
be to, take measures to prevent Ger
many from declaring herself an in
solvent debtor or & bankrupt state.
Then." Peret continued, "we should
immediately fix the amount of our ac
count against Germany which she
must be made to pay to the full limit
of Iter financial ability without con
sideration for her feelings. It will
be time enough then to decide about
the method of payment. She may pay
either in capital immediately or in
yearly installments.
Must Have Guarantee.
I do not believe that Germany at
the present time is in a position to
pay a large amount in cash. We must
not demand from her too heavy pay
ment now, so as not to place her in
a position where she might argue that
we are strangling her and killing .the
goose that is to lay the golden eggs.
"Whether the installments we shall
demand from Germany be 20, 30 or 40
billions of francs yearly depends en
tirely on our decision, after an in
vestigation as to what amount Ger
many will be able to pay. These pay
ments would, be guaranteed by cus
toms tariffs decided on at the con
ference, reserving for ourselves the
right to raise such tariffs should Ger
many fail to meet her obligations
"This would act as a means of co
ercion because I do not believe that
we 6hould occupv Germany with a
military force until her debt is paid
It is my opinion that once our armies
of occupation return from Germany
all measures should be taken to make
re-occupation unnecessary.
Fighting for Neutrals.
"1 believe in the creation of a finan
cial society of nations and that all ex
penses incurred by each nation should
. be put in a common and an interna
tional tax levied upon all until such
debts' are paid. Neutrals should be
included in this financial society of
cations, especially those neutrals who
profited by the war.
"As a matter of fact, we are fight
tag for the neutrals as well as for
ourselves, for had the German pan
Cennaniet dream been realized it
would not have been long before Hol
land. Sweden. Norway, Denmark,!
Switzerland and other neutrals would
have felt the weight of Germany's
iron fist."
Discussing the question whether
Germany should be permitted to im
port raw material so as to enable her
to resume her manufacturing indus
try. M. Peret said:
"I do not believe that all importa
tions of raw materia! to the Germans
should be forbidden, because their in
dustry would then be at a standstill
and they would be unable to pay.
Neither do I believe that they should
be permitted to Import without limi
tation because with their lower wages,
longer working hours and undepleted
supplies of machinery they would be
able to undersell any other country
on the market which would be quite
as great a calamity as being unable to
pay. However, it will be a long time
before any European country can ex
port any raw material and the ques
tion mainly interests America.

WAGES III UTAH
! TO BE CUT
Decline in Copper Price Brings
75 Cent Reduction in
Pay to Workers
(By Review Least-d AVirel
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, Feb. b.-.
The Utah Copper company today an
nounced a reduction in wages of min- i
ers and mul men approximating 75
cents a day, effective tomorrow.
The announcement was posted at
the company's mines at Bingham and
at the mills at Garfield late this a.icr-
noon. Company officials said it was
in line with similar reductions an
nounced or to be announced by all big
topper producers.
The new scale of wages is based
upon the selling price of copper. With
copper below 22 cents and as low a IS
cents, employes and the mines who re
ceive a bare wage in excess of $4.15
per diem, will be reduced at the rate
of 12 1-2 cents for each one cent de
crease in copper price, but all other
employes will be reduced at the rate
of 10 cents for each one cent decrease, i
The scale is subiect to levision ud-
ward whenever the metal increases in !
price, or whenever increases in the 1
living cost justifies such revision.
The mill men receiving a base wage I
of $3.55 per diem will be reduced at
the 6ame rate as the men at the mines.
further decreases in the price in cop
per to cause reduced wage rates of
seven and one-half cents a day instead
of ten cents, however. The company i
employs about 5000 men.
Profit-Sharing Plan
Near, Says Report
BUTTE, Mont, Feb. 6. Reports1
that the--Anaconda Copper Mining
company contemplated the establish
ment of profit sharing plan patterned
after the Ford plan were current here
today. Anaconda officials refused
either to affirm or deny the report,
stating, however; that no change in
system could be made until the cop
per market clarifies sufficiently to
enable 'them to know whether or not
sale of the metal can be resumed.
REBELLION BREAKS
OUT IN MAGDEBURG
PARIS, Feb. 6. (Ha vas.) Serious
disorders have occurred in Magdeburg,
capital of the Province of Saxony, ac
cording to Berlin advices. Soldiers
and sailors, armed with grenades-and
machine guns, broke down the doors
of the court house, liberated 160 pris
oners, smashed shop windows, pillaged
shops and trained machine guns on
the inhabitants. The government
troops are vigorously attacking the
revolutionists.
Madgeburg lies on the Elbe. 76 miles
southwest of Berlin. It is considered
one of the strongest fortresses of the
German empire, consisting of a cita
del, redoubts and a circle of detached
forts. Before the war the city had
a population of nearly 300.000.

in the making, had been passed ouce
by the house, and had been revised
twice to meet the transitions fi'om

"dry" nation.
Representative Kitchin. democratic
leader, expects the house to approve
the measure agreed to by senate and
j house conferees before adjournment
' j Saturday night and Senator Simmons,
! chairman of ' the senate finance com
mittee, will present it in the senate
as soon as the house has acted. Ap
proval by both houses is confidently
expected by leaders of both parties.
The completed measure will not be
sent to France unless the president's
departure for home is delayed veil
b?yond the date now set for liis sail
ing. The president is expected to
sign the bill soon after his arrival
here. In the meantime, the internal
revenue bureau is proceeding with
preparations for collecting 1919 taxes
on the basis of the schedules as con
tained in the measure reported by the
conferees.

Yield Over Ten Bi'lions.
Estimates of the exact revenue re
turns in prospect vary. Unofficial

yield at about S,086.OO0.000 this year,
and $4,150,000,000 in 1920. Estimates

pared with about $4.370,OOO,00o from
existing tax laws will be made public

The $6,070,000,000 for this year is
based on prospective taxes for the
fiscal year ending July .1 next, includ
ing six months' revenues from intoxi

With the government given absolute
control of the wheat market in the
United States, members of the commit-
tee said it would be difficult to deter-1
mine what the price would be if the
usual law of supply and demand were
in operation, but they thought it
would be based largely on the world
market price. Some witnesses who
have testified at hearings before the
committee have predicted a world
price of $1.25 a bushel.
On the basis of such a price th
government would stand a loss ot
about $1 a bushel, but committee mem-;

to Germany so "as to enable her to
keep her machinery working without
enabling her to undersell.
The financial problem is the most
momentous one before the peace con
ference and I am greatly surprised
that it has not .been considered before
this. The first thing usually done
when a society is founded is to elect
a treasurer. Thus, if a society of na
tions is formed, a treasurer should at
once be appointed by the creation of
a financial society of nations. The
solution of the problem, to my mind,
is the foundation of a financial so
ciety of nations in which the ex
penses of every belligerent opposed to
Germany should then be made and
she should be made to pay by every
mark she can get together. Then
there should be international taxation, I
including the neutrals, to make up i
the balance." i

MAY REVISE ARMY PENALTIES
(By Review leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6. Revision
of army legal procedure may result
from the work of two Var department
agencies which are reviewing the sub
ject of military discipline for the pur
pose not only of establishing a model
system of prison administration bnt
also of ironing out inequalities and
resultant unfairness in war time sen
tences. It was explained today that the re
cent prisoners strike at Leavenworth
barracks had terminated in an armis
tice, the prisoners committee being
anxious that Col. Sedgswick Rice,
commandant, should come to Washing
ton for the prison conference and had
pledged good order during his ab
sence. The basis of the strike. Colonel Rice
indicated, was the inequality of war
time sentences and also a feeling
among other offenders that they were
equally entitled to the clemency which
they claimed conscientious objectors
were receiving.'

"The commission on the league of

night. Appreciable progress was made
in the consideration of the draft. It
wag further unanimously agreed. In
accordance with the decision of the
conference at the Qual d'Orsay yester
day, that representatives of Czecho

should be associated with the commis

"In their second and third sessions
the commission have covered practi

have discussed those articles which
deal with the motives behind the for
mation of a league of nations and the
objects which would safeguard the
constitution of its chief organs and
the qualifications for membership in
the league.
"While the decisions of the commis

provisional, many apparent difficulties
have already been resolved and a gen

the principles which underlie the
whole draft. It is therefore to be ex
pected that the remaining articles will

PLAN TO JOIN BOLSHEVIKI
VLADIVOSTOK. Feb. 6. (Canadian

inauguration of a movement having
for its purpose the union of the radical

constitute a majority in the elements

that a government secured in this way

E APPROVES SENATE INDORSES
M SCHOOL BILL
Protect Arizona's Funds
With the reading of a report of the state commission of Institu
tions by Governor Campbell before the state legislature "Wednesday,
and with the recommendation at the same time read, that almost half
million dollars be provided by the legislature to sustain the state insti
tutions until the close of the present fiscal year, a deplorable condi
tion from the standpoint of the taxpayer has been disclosed. Arizona's
funds hare been wasted, spent without regard for the safeguards pro
Tided by the legislature.
"Deficits are the rule rather than the exception." declared gov
ernor in referring to the condition of finances or the Tarlous state
institutions. "The state has been run in an extravagant and reckless
fashion, and without thought of confining expenditures to the appropria
tions made by the legislature of 1917."
In considering the financial conditions of the state institutions, let
us for the moment forget that the governor is not of the same political
faith as the members of the commission, and that members of the com
mission were named by a preceding governor. The facts stand in the
report of the commission to the governor, the commission requests the
appropriation of half-million, and the governor recommends that the
apprpriation be made. It is self evident that politics had nothing to
do with the deficit or with the request for additional funds.
The fault lies with the system, not with the commission, nor with
the governor, nor the former governor, nor the institutions, nor any
other department of the state. The system under which the expenditures
are made and which permits of state institutions spending more than
is allowed them for sustenance, and this system alone, is the reason
for the present deplorable condition, and similar conditions which in the
past have existed.
New rroblems come to the legislature with the reading of the
commission's report and the message from the governor. These prob
lems devolve into responsibilities to safeguard the people's money to
provide some means of protecting the state from a recurrence of simi
lar deficits in years to come. And. these responsibilities do not end
with the reconstruction of the state commission of Institutions or with
the revival of the old board of control.
Several plans have been advanced for safeguarding the state from
this haxzard to its funds. Curbing of the powers of the institutional body
has been proposed. The budget system for institutions offers hope.
Separate control of each institution, while cumbersome, has some ad
vantages. Governor Campbell recommends the passage of a budget law,
to be preceded by a complete audit.
Regardless of politics, regardless of personnel, regardless of the
plans adopted, the facts stGl remain that the legislature is faced with
the problem and responsibility of safeguarding the state's funds that
some slipshod, irresponsible commission similar to past governing bodies x
will not hereafter be entrusted with finances which it cannot properly
handle.

Introducing Grand Canyon County
One suggestion of particular merit for-Use remedying of complaints
and for the disposition of that strip of land north of the Grand Canyon
which Ttah would secure from Arizona through purchase or trade, has
been put forward. The plan offers relief for what now is a puzzling
and perilous proposition. It offers satisfaction to the residents of the
strip; and it does away fully with-Utah's claim for. the strip. It 4s put
forward by W. R. Ashurst, resident of the state for many years, formerly
resident of the northern district, now United States employment agent
at Bisbee.
Mr. Ashurst in a letter to the Review published yesterday morning,
outlines conditions in the strip. The greatest complaint, he declares,
is that the country north of the canyon is not properly administered
by Arizona and that if Utah "had it she could give the citizens of the
strip better protection from outlaws, tramp sheep and cattlemen and
such."
The remedy which Mr. Ashurst suggests is the adatCoii iu Ari
zona of a new county by segregating the strip from existing counties and
setting up of Grand Canyon county.
"The country is rich and large enough to support a county govern
ment." says Mr. Ashurst, "and while population is rather sparce, there
are plenty of ieople to run and support a strong county. Besides, this
would be an impetus to business and settlement and soon there would
be good towns scattered over the country."
Mr. Ashnrst's suggestion would solve the entire problem. Utaii
would no longer have argument for purchasing the strip if Arteona could
administer efficiently the affairs of that district. Residents of the
strip find their only complaint when they" are forced to travel through
California to reach their county seats.
Sale of the strip to Utah would be a disaster to this state. No amount
of money could ever repay Arizona for its loss of timber lands and
grazing ranges thrqugh the transaction. Imagination cannot divide the
Grand Canyon of the Colorado with the nothern neighbor, a proposition
which savors of dividing a rich, heritage with & stranger.
If residents of the strip demand some remedy, if conditions are not
such cow that they are satisfied to live under Arizona administration,
let some suggestion similar lo that of Mr. Ashurst be put Into effect.
Arizona is amply able to take care of her own problems without,
handing them over to a neighbor state for solution.

The Newest Weapon
. A western inventor has announced the abolition 0 gun-powder- "
His argument sounds as reasonable as it does revolutionary.
His rifle utilizes gasoline instead of powder for ita explosion as
so ha says shoots seven timea harder than the stoutest powder-propelled
bullet ever did.
Gasoline, it seems, has seven times the explosive force or powder,.
The future rifle, therefore, will use a spark-plug instead or a percus
sion cap. , JC"3
It win carry enough ammunition for hundreds of rounds In the
stock, and the cost of killing a hundred men win be so slight that no
murderer need be deterred; if he can buy a pint of gasoline and six
ten-penny nails he can go forth and decimate all his pet enemies.
No expensive bras3 shells, no caps, no speedily-deteriorating, costly
powder.
Just a squirt of gasoline behind the bullet, a spark through the
'park plug, and bang!
No. not even a bang, juot a seven times multiplied force turned
loose without noise or fuss or expense. ,
At that rate a gallon of gasoline would sufHce.to bombard London '
and a barrel would conduct a couple of South American revolutions.
Maybe our future armies would be recruited solely trora the ranks
of the taxi drivers, and spark plugs will cettle the destinies of cations.
A few more inventions like this, and war will become so automatic
that we can keep our armies at home and wage war with tanks, sky
nquadrons. scout cruisers and automatic artillery directed by wireless,

NEW YORK. Feb. . Further un
! se:tloment in the metal industry, as
i evidenced by reported sales of copper
1 at lSa cents and the lower miners
wage schedule, served again to de
press prices on the stock exchange to
day. Extreme losses in coppers and al
lied metals ran from 1 to 2 points for
American Smelting, Anaconda, In
spiration and Kennecott, Utah losing
3 points in consequence of rumors
that the dividend is to be cut at the
next meeting.
United States Steel held compara
tively steady .until the final hour,
when it yielded an extreme of Hi
points, rails and utilities weakening
at the same time,' while forenoon
gains in oils and various specialties
were altogether effaced, tobaccos al
most alone retaining Cieir early ad
vantage.
Sales amounted to 450.000 shares.
Call money followed its course of
the previous day, advancing to 5 per
cent at the close. Time funds were
linn with a reduction of supply.
Trading in bonds was less diversi
fied and somewhat mixed in the in
ternational group, French nationals
advancing, municipals easing. Lib
erty issues also reacted moderately.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $11,
S75.000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call. ,

According to the gossip current in
.he corn pit, the Argentine export
ninimum had been lifted to So cents
i bushel from 74 VI . Although the
crada was in general disposed to
doubt that such a radical change had
been made, most of the houses with
Argentine connections bought, and
this fact tended to emphasize bullish
sentiment.
Oats merely followed the trend of
corn.

He is an Armenian this little Vsrtzn. He is well
and strong now. But.in his eyes you still can reid some
thing of the frightful agony that is "overwhelming the
Near East.
The story of any one of these poor little refugees is
the story of alL Hungry always; always tired. Shoeless,
almost clothesless. Resting never. Only shuddering
fear, ceaseless tramping, consent fleeing from death.
It is estimated that millions of people were rnassa
cred, and that four millions, mostly women and children,
are homeless, starving, crying to this great, country for
aid. The orphans of tender years alone are numbered
at 400,000.
As your little ones run joyously, safely around in
free and happy homes, won't you hear the cry of these
poor, helpless children in the stricken land of Armenia,
Syria, Greece and Persia? You are part of the great
sympathetic heart of America. They are relying on
YOU. Do your share.

TWO BAND CONCERTS
, EACH SUNDAY. PLAN
I -
Band concerts twice each Sunday,
one in the Bisbee City park, and the
other in the Warren Vista park, will
probably be inaugurated this summer
it waa learned yesterday with the ar
rival of Frank R. Todhunter, leader
of the band, who has been in his
home in Ohio for the past three
months. "Mr. Todhunter will " again
resume" his duties iwith the band,
which' he topes to increase largely tu
the near future.
Plans for the ban.l for this summer
have not been completed, declared the
leader, but the two-concert program
for Bisbee and Warren is practically
decided on. It is also definitely de
cided, that the band will continue its
at the Vista park during the
aammer.

cording to Mrs. Alta T. Edgar, who is
in charge of it. The eight voune wo
men who are doing the actual work.
eaca bearing proper credentials, are
Tisiting the homes of the residents
of Bisbee and making aearchin? in
quiry into the amount of pay received
in relation to the expenses Incurred.
' The work of taking this financial
census is necessarily slow as ques
tionnaires must be filled out at each
home visited.
It ia hoced by Mrs. Edxar to obtain
all data necessary to coTer this indus
trial center in Bisbee so that a can
vas of the other centers of population
in the district will not be found neces
sary. However, she is convinced that
at least two more weeks will be re
quired before the campaign can be
completed.

. These Durable Soles Cut

"For use around cement plants and
similar places where rough materials
grind down soles quickly, I recommend
Neslia Soles. They resist wear sur
prisingly. After working around the
clinker department long enough to
wear out to pairs of ordinary soles,
my NeoUn Soles are still as good as
new," writes A. F. Miller, superintend
ent of The Peninsular Portland Cement
Company plant in Jackson. Michigan.
It is rcnarkable ho tough and dur
able Neolin Soks are. They are made
so by Science comfortable and water
proof, too. They come on new shoes
in many styks for men, women, and
children, and are available everywhere
for re-soling. Wear them, and cut
your shoe tUls don.
Neslin Soles are made by The Good
