WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
IN FRANCE, June 20, (By the As
sociated Press). At dawn this
morning American troops stormed
German trenches and machine guu
nests in front of Cantigny, in the
Montdidier sector. Those of the
German garrison who remained to
fight and carry out their orders
to hold the positions were killed
by rifle fire and machine gun fire
and bayonet.
The Americans also took prison
ers. The enemy artillery has been
more active .on the Toul sector
since the heavy gassing to which
the Americans subjected them yes
terday. The infantry action has
been confined, however, to an at
tempted raid, in which only sixty
men took part, in spite of the Ger
man official statement, which said
they had penetrated the American
lihes at Seicheprey.
The Germans have thrown
about 6000 shells along the Amer
ican front in the Woevre.
The American artillery put down
a heavy box barrage on the rear
of the enemy positions. A few
minutes later the infantry swarm
ed over the top and rushed the
trenches. Some of the Germans
had tried to escape through the
barrage, crossing to their rear, but
few of them got through, for num
erous German dead were found
later.
Prisoners captured declare that
they had orders to hold on at all
costs, and this was apparent by
the desperate manner in which
they fought. The battle was short
but deadly, for the enemy posi
tions were swept clean cf Ger
mans. The official report says
that a great many Germans were
killed.
One machine gun nest contain
ing eight men which had been
sprinkling Cantigny for some days,
was blown up by a direct hit from
a trench mortar bomb.
AUSTRIAN ATTACKS FAIL
To all outward appearances the Au
strian offensive in the Italian theater
thus far has met with failure all along
the front from the Venetian Alps to
the Adriatic sea.
In the hill region additional ground
has been recaptured from the invaders,
while along the Piave river, where
intensive fighting is In progress, at
some points with fluctuating results,
the balance seems to sway in favor of
the Italians.
Southan d east of Asiago the French
and Italians have retaken Pennar,
Bertigo and Costalunga, past which
the Austrians had hoped to push their
front and gain the Astiago river val
ley which leads to Vicenza on th?
plains below.

"Arizona led the United States
in per capital subscription to the
Liberty loan. The Warren distiict
never has lagged behind in any pa
triotic duty. We all must work to
maintain our proud record of befng
100 per cent Americans and buy
war savings stamps and thrift
stamps to the limit of our ability."
L. II. Bovee, vice county chair
man of the war savings campaign
for Cochise county.
War savings stamps will not be al
lowed to become a dead issue in Bis
bee. A hot local campaign, with the
design of insuring a total absence of
financial slackers will be conducted
throughout the Warren district, wo
steps to make this end more easily at
tainable have been taken. One is -he
pledge card campaign which starts to
day with J. C. Ryan, county chairman,
and his aides getting busy on those
who are in financial position to take
large amounts of stamps. Tli f ccond
is the formation of war savings poeie
ties, three or which already have l.een
brought Into existence in the city.
This activity la in charge of L. H.
Bovee, manager of the Woolwarth
store.
An active society already has been
organized at the Woolworth store,
with seventeen members. The club or
iginally was pledged to sell S2400
worth of W. S. S. between now and
the end of the year. However, this
record will not Batisfy its member?,
who intend far to'exceed the pledge.
In addition, societies have been
formed at the Phelps-Dodge Mercantile
company stores and the Fair store.
Each of these has been pledged to take
up specified amounts of stamps be
tween now and December 31. The
Phelps-Dodge pledge is $20,000.
The societies will not content them
selves with subscribing as individuals
or groups; the members' intend, indi
vidually and collectively to go out aft
er the elusive quarters and dollars of
store patrons, both during business
hours and afterwards. The members of
these societies will be supplied at all
times with W. S. S. and thrift stamps
and. when supplying those who have
signed pledges, a record of the name
and amovjnt of each sale will he tak
en and later forwarded to th-3 secre
tary in charge of this branch of the
work, so that the purchaser will be
credited properly against the amount
pledged.
There is keen competition between
the local clubs for per capital super

One Dead, Six
Arrested When

(By Review Leased 'Wire)
SIOUX IALLS, S. D.. June 20,
One man is dead and at least six
men who failed to register for the
draft are in the hands of the police
as a result of a "work or fight"
raid begun by the home guards
here today. In addition an enemy
alien who had not registered was
taken in charge. The dead man is
Melvin Lundy, of Sioux Falls.
When asked to show his registra
tion card, Lundy said it was in his
room a few blocks away. He came
staggering in a few minutes later
and said he "never had a card
and never would." With that he
fell over a desk and died ten min
utes later. He had taken a mix
ture of several kinds of poison.
O'LEARY TRIES

Overworked Insanity Plea is

Save Editor . of Sinn Fein
Paper ;
(Rv Review leased Wire)
NEW YORK, June 20 While shield
ing his brother, John J. O'Leary, from
charges of criminally aiding his escape
from trial last month for alleged viola
tion of the espionage act, Jeremiah A.
O'Leary, the Sinn Fein leader pictured
himself as on .the verge cf nervous
collapse when he fled to the west May
7. He was laboring under the obses
sion, he indicated, that government
agents had entered into a conspiracy
to have him sent to prison.
Deserted by his counsel, Henry A.
Wise, who had been advised by gov
ernment agents, the Sinn Feiner as
serted, not to connec: himself with
the case as it might jeopardize his
professional reputation, Jeremiah A.
O'Leary said he became convinced he
could not obtajn other advisors who
cculd defend him properly and that j
this so preyed on his mind that he'
became "tnoroughly disorganized." ,
Agalnst the advice of his brother.
the witness said, he left New York
with Arthur Lyons, an employe of his
law office, for St. Louis and there de-!
cided that he would not return "to he
persecuted." The public mind had
been so "poisoned" through "prej
udiced" newspapers, ,he declared that
his trial, had he returned, would have
been a "political hippodrome foe the
newspaper fiends."
Throughout a long cross examina
tion, O'Leary reiterated his statement
that there bad been no colusion be
tween himself, his brother and Lyons
relative to his flight. He declard John
was givn the impression that his broth
er had gone to Newburgh, N. Y., to
fish, rest and recuperate and that he
intended returning for trial.
An hour or so before train time,
O'Leary declared, he was persuaded
by Lyons not to go to Newburgh. but
to accompany Lyons to Reno, Nev.,
instead.
He had arranged, O'Leary testified,
that Lyons should represent him in the
trial of a divorce action at Reno and
this was the object of his assistant's
trip. Lyons "took the bull by the
horns' O'Leary said, bought two tick
ets for St. Louis without consuling him
and then pervalled upon him to go
west. '
The defense laid much emphasis on
testimony tending to show that
O'Leary, since his return from Sara,
Wash., Tuesday in custody of federal
officers had no opoprtunity of confer
ring with his brother, his counsel or
others interested in Iub behalf relative
to the testimony he would give today.
Then Earl B. Barnes, the assistant dis
trict attorney prosecuting the case,
elicted from the Sinn Feiner a state
ment that he had read In this morn
ing's New York American in an inter
view with T. B. Felder, attorney for
John J. O'Leary which gave Feider's
version of the testimony Jeremiah
"was expected to give" at the trial
today "if he told the truth."

D-T-uty Ilraun, a socialist. "We

on railroads and alarming juvenile
criminality. According to official
statistics between. October. 191B.

The increase of criminality demon
strates the demoralization through thp
war, which is described by fools as a
rejuvenating bath. Self sacrifice and
j patriotism perhaps are still found In
the trenches but in the invaded re
gions profiteering begins to rear its

"Everybody cheats, steals, grabs,
from jailb'rds to court chamberlains,
who cheat the needy homeworker out

tho worse it becomes.
"Added to this is the Fatherland
party's wild war bating propacanda
and refusal of equal suffrage. What
wonder that popular exasperation

Herr liraun further pilloried the ac
tivities of the police and informers
and hateful hypocritical censorship.
The prohibition of the acknowlejee
ment of sifts by soldiers to the social

purpose of withholdin? from public
knowledge the magnitude of the de

He further mercilessly indicted the
systematic discrimination against the

PEACE ADVOCATS
MERITED REBUKE
Says Great Britain at no Time
Would Fail to Consider
Reasonable Peace but Ger
many Offers None
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Juno 20 Philip Edward
Morrell, liberal, representing a small
pacifist group in the liouse of com
mons today, started a debate on the
question of peace b.v agreement, by
moving the tolloving resolution:
"That this house desires that this
government wkl lose no diplomatic op
portunity to settle the problems of the
war by agreement; and that to that
end it" expresses its opinion that sec
let treaties with allied governments
should be revised since, in their pres
ent form they are inconsistent with
the object for which this country en
tered the war and are, therefore, a
barrier to a democratic peace."
The motion was negative, without
division.
In moving his resolution Mr. Morrell
declared that there was a passionate
desire for peace in Germany, if it could
be got with security, but the Germans
believed thatt he allies were unwilling
to listen to reasonable terms.
Philip Snowden, socialist supporting
the resolution asked Secretary Baltour
to detine what he meant by " peace of
fensive." Mr. I5alfour replied tbat he meant
any effort, under the guise of seek
ing an honorable termination of tie
war, to divide the allies and discour
age individual members of the alli
ance. Mr. Balfour declared it was a fact
that Germany was pursuing her aim
of universal domination with persist
ent and elaborate care and foresight
and with a ruthless, cold blooded deter
mination which left Napoleonic tra
dition far behind. "We never rejected
proposals which we thought had the
slightest probability of producing a
reasonable peace, and there, is no evi
dence whatever that the German gov
ernment has never been serious in
niakCng such peace offers, he as
serted. Contending that Belgium remained
toe greatest blow to German honor,
the secretary asked whether Germany
had ever in any document or speech
cpenly or plainly offered to restore
Belgium to absolute political and eco
nomic independence. He knew of no
such of.'er. There had been sugges
tions but never a frank avowal.
' '-.'v." he continued, "the gov
ernments are not going to shut their
ears to anything that can be called
reasouaDle suggestions, if such sug
gestions should be made. These treat
ies were entered into by this country
with otners as means of an alliance.
By these treaties we stand. Our na
tional honor is bound up in them.
"We have the task before us of do
ing all we can to restore Russia to
full national self consciousness. Ev
erybody sympathizes with the difficul
ties in which that vast population
finds itself."
This was the very. last time, said
the secretary that the allies were like
ly to make proposals to the central
powers, or so far as he was able to
judge, that the central powers were
likely to make proposals to the allies,
except Zs: the one purpose of peace
offensive. What the central powers
apparently wanted to do was not to.
propose reasonable terms for the alli
ance as a whole, but to offer some
member of the alliance terms seem
ingly extremely favorable, if Jiat
member could consider only Its own
interest and not the interests of the
whole alliance, and thereby disinte
grate the members of the alliance,
some of which would be perfectly
helpless taken in isolation and were
strong only so long as they were
united.
He did not'"- ,s central powers
for laying such a trap, he said, but
should blame tliose who fell into the
trap, and most of all he blamed his
pacifist critics, who appeared to think
it almost criminal not to fall into
the trap.

organization and training under the

be composed of Slavs, Jugoslavs,
Czerho-Slovenes and Poles in this
country who are not subject to the

the allied forces, as the president may
determine.
Recently Senator Hitchcock of
Nebraska proposed an amendment to
the $12,000,000,000 army appropriation
providing for a Slavic legion and, after
the president had written him today
approving the plan, the amendment
was attached to the measure by the
senate military sub-committee.
A force of several thousands Slavs
recruited in this country and Canada
under the direction of Ignace Jan Paci
erewsi recently eutered the fighting
line in France.
Senator Hitchcock's amendment sets
no limit to the size of the force.

Jones buys a cotton mixed suit; pays $25 for it.
Jj It looks pretty good at first but in a week or two
it s all out of shape and wearing poorly.
Brown buys an all-wool, Hart Schaffner & Marx

Brown's suit is still stylish, good looking and is

Jones consumes nearly twice as much wool as
Brown and a great deal more labor and money.

EXPRESS RATES TO
BE RAISED WHEN
BUSINESS STARTS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 20. The con
solidated express rompan to start op
eration July 1, will increase its rates
about 10 per cent with the sanction
of the interstate commerce commis
sion, it was learned today. Many ex
ceptions to the general increase are
to be made however.
The commission is expected to an
nounce tomorrow its decision on the
express rate increase application for
which has been pending since last
fall. It is understood that although
the action will be favorable, consider
ation has been given to the suggestion
of shippers that a flat increase would
not be justified for all classes of serv
ice and localities.
Tho eommUsioR today incidentally
handed down an order denying the ap
plication of the leading express com
panies for permission to apply for lif
teen instead of ten per cent Higher
rates, and promptly withdrew this or
der when it was found that the de
cision on the 10 per cent phase of
the application did not accompany the
order.

into the hands of the allied troops.
On their part oyer the entire moun
tain region, the Austrians have re
mained quiet except when compelled
to go on the defensive and then their
efforts to hold back their antagonists
have lacked the stamania usual in
men whose hearts are in their task.
This condition bag prevailed since the
first onslaught of the enemy was sum
marily stopped by the fire of the
British, French and Italian forces
lorming the barrier to the Veneuan
plains.
More heart Is being throw n into we

from the Montello plateaai southwaia
to the region lying east of Venice.
Here he still seems, notwithstanding
nis heavy losses and numerous re
pulses on various sectors, bent on
throwing his armies across the stream
or pushing further westward with his
torce3 that already have lorded u.
Nevertheless, turther setbacks to the
Austrians have followed those of past
days on the Montello where the Ital
ians are viciously disputiug the right
of way J the plains. Likewise near
the famous zenson loop tarther down
the stream the enemy's heavy attacks
nave been held and under the impetus
of the Italian counter blows, he has
fallen back nearer the river lor re
inforcements hastily brougnt up.
Still farther south, between FossalU
and San Dona Di iave tne Italians
have further pushed back the invaders
and unofficial reports assert that they
have recaptured the village of Capb
Sile, lying on the euge of the marsn
region some twenty miles east of his
toric Venice.
It is not outside the range of possi
bility that a large number of the Au
strians are in a fair way to be taken
prisoner by the Italians for a large
number of the pontoon bridges which
they threw across the Piave over tho
fourteen and a half mile front between
the Conegliano railway bridge and the
Benson loop have been carried awiy
on the bosom of the -swollen stream,
At any rate the loss of these bridges
will necessarily seriously imped-i the
reinforcement of the Austrians on the
west bank of the stream and the re
plenishment of their supplies.
Meanwhile the food situation and
the war weariness of the people within
the dual monarchy again are making
trouble for the authorities.
Troublous times also seemingly are
in store for the German governm .
owing to the lack of bread. In Vienna
mobs are reported to have raided bak
eries and stoned the residence of tho
premier and even to have attacked one
of tho wings of tho imperial pala.:e
Troops had to be called out to restore
order. ,
Little fighting is in progress on "he
battlefields in France and lirlgHini, al
though tho artillery duels continue
I violent on various sectors. The Atm r
I icans again have forced back the Ger
I mans northwest of Chateau Thicrrv
in the Marne region, this time without

i The Americans heavily shelled a de

! w hen they had finished this and start
I ed forward they found the Germany

: icans advanced their line more than
half a mile.
The German official communication
said the Germans penetrated Anr rtcia
positions at Seicheprey. in the Toul
sector cast of St. Mihiel and inflictnl
heavy casualties. The Associated
Press correspondent with the Amer
ican army in this region says the infan
try activity has been confined to an
attempted raid, notwithstanding the

Hearst
Advertisements appearing recently in
Arizona papers, purport to narrate Hearst's
side of the question in the war that has
been waged upon him and his newspapers
by the press of the country generally, and
by many public speakers for the past year.
Now, while every man is entitled to his day
in court and to a chance for his white alley,
and, while there are always two sides to
every question, this newspaper believes
that Hearst has no white alley and but very
little side to any public question. The
Hearst news service had to be suppressed
by the British government shortly after the
war started because of its too friendly atti
tude towards German' and apparent un
fairness towards the allied cause. Hearst,
smarting under this drastic action, proceed
ed to wage bittor war on all things English
ram then on. But he soon cot into deep
waters. America went to war as England's
ally and Hearst and his publications began
to reap the whirlwind. The pro-German
and anti-English attitude had to be
abandoned. Now Hearst shouts his loyalty
from the housetops, but to thoughtful men
is sounds vain and shallow. It has too
much of the death bed repentence flavor.
Hearst is on the defensive, instead of lead
ing the van like all the other great editors
of the country have done ever since the
Lusitania crime of the ages stirred America
to her heart's depths. Hearst defends him
self by attacking Roosevelt. That is like
Hunt's attack on Bisbee as a defense of the
charge of being an I. W. W. sympathizer.
If Hearst had a tithe of Roosevelt's patriot
ism and sterling Americanism he would not
be on the defensive today. Because of his
attitude his great newspaper organization
has lost much of its standing and influence
with the American public. Hearst papers
have plenty of lip loyalty now but they
were too short on heart loyalty too long to
recover in a day the standing they lost dur
ing Hearst's prolonged attack of wild-eyed
frenzy, due mostly to a top heavy ego.
A DIAGNOSIS AND A VERDICT
(From the American Medical Journal)
To medical men who are accustomed to
study diseased bodies and minds, this state
of mind of the German government and
the German people seems like the insanity
of a whole nation. We medical men are
familiar with a horrible disease, which be
gins with an initial lesion acquired in a
debauch and which ends often, in insanity
with delusions of grandeur and magnifi
cence. It would seem as though the Ger
man nation was suffering from such a dis
ease, from such a form of insanity. It
acquired its initial lesion in the rape and
outrage of Denmark, of Austria and of
France in the decade between 1 860 and
1 870. The virus of conquest and domin
ation has coursed through its veins for more
than fifty years, and has produced now a
diseased national mind with the delusions
of egotism and grandeur that are respons
iblc for this world's war.
Vhen the German people waken from
the nightmare of the war, they must realize
the enormity of the crime they have com
mitted under the spell of the medieval
autocratic government that controlled
them. They will realize that although they
might retain with profit to themselves a
province stolen from Denmark or Poland.
France or Belgium, they can never dom
inate with force of arms with profit to
themselves for any length of time great na
tions like Russia and France, England,
Italy, Japan and America. We are in this
war, as our great president has said, "to
make the world safe for democracy'," and
whether it takes one year or ten years, we
shall continue the war until the brutal and
barbarous autocracy of Germany is de
stroyed. If the German people could have
but a brief period of freedom from their
war madness, let them ask themselves if the
few miles of Belgium and France and the
occupied provinces of stricken Russia can
compensate them for making nine-tenths
of the world their bitter enemy. And they
should be made to know that thi3 is not the
enmity of a day, the enmity that will dis
appear with a peace that they hope to com
pel by force of arms, but that it is an enmity
that will last, that will mean for Germany a .
complete severance of relations, social,
commercial and in every way from our
selves and our allies until Germany has
purged itself of guilt, and asks humbly for
a place among the nations in which the
people rule. The medical profession of
America sends this message to the medical
profession of Germany.
TO FOLLOW THE BISBEE LEAD
In his report to the mayor of New York
City schools, Arthur Somers, president of
the board of education, among other things,
urged the establishment of junior high
schools as follows:
"It may be well to add here that the prob
lem of a junior high school is one of the
most important that faces educational
authorities at the present time, and so far
there seems to have been no decision
reached as to a proper method of organiza
tion. We believe, however, that New York
City is in a position to furnish a practical
illustration of how such a school can be
conducted. The addition of the ninth yeaf,
or first high school year, to the centrally,
located schools will go far toward relieving
the congestion in the high schools. Courses
of instruction for these junior high schools
can be so devised as to guide the student
along definite lines."
Withcut either pride or boasting. The
Review would state here that Bisbee has
already adopted and placed in effect the
junior high school system referred to above
by this eminent authority. The Horace
Mann junior high school will be dedicated
here July 2 1 .
This week marks the first good news
from the battle front we have received
since the lamented General Byng hit the
Germans before Cambrai last fall. We have
held all German offensives on the Marne
and have slaughtered them by the thous
ands before Rheims without yielding a foot
and have stopped the Austrian drive dead
with losses of some hundred and fifty
thousand on the Italian front. The strength
and ferocity have oozed out of the teutonic
offensives during the past four days, while
the allied resistance seems to have taken on
renewed vigor and determination. That
half million American doughboys may
have had something to do with the change
in complexion of the war news. Who
knows? And still the stream of food and
shells and guns and men and airplanes and
copper and cotton continues to flow from
these shores to France. And our ship
building program i3 reaching gigantic pro
portions. From the central empires comes
only word of a hunger drive by Austria
and Russian riots and German doubt and
discouragement. The kaiser seems to have
used already his July and August reserves
of men and munitions and energy. As for
Foch, he has not yet touched any resources
beyond those available for May. England
and America are coming forward with the
full June supply and he may use them yet
before his American allies start in to cele
brate the Fourth. Are we dismayed ? We
are not. Cast your eye on those Americans
at Chateau Thierry, and on those French
men before Rheims, and on those Italians
at Mor.tbello and on the Piave.
The action of the Texas state convention
of bricklayers, masons and plasterers in go
ing on record as pledged not to call or allow
a strike until the war is over speaks more
loudly for patriotism than any high sound
ing phrases. And the employer that should
presume to take advantage of this pledge
will find public sentiment arrayed solidly
against him. And it is public sentiment
that determines the success or failure of
strikes and lockups in the long run, always.
Every day witnesses some new expression
by organized labor that it is in this war to
a victorious finish.
"America has arrived," announced
Bonar Law to the English parliament in
giving word of new confidence and op
timism regarding the great war. And Eng
land, with the Somme and Vimy Ridge and
Ypres as English records in heroic warfave,
should be a stern judge of whether any na
tion has arrived or not. Chateau 1 hierry,
where we shattered three crack German
divisions, was a herald, sent on in advance
to tell the allied world and Germany that
we were moving in the right direction.
Legislative Gossip
Fcr the first time in the history of
Arizona, or a3 far as the memory of
the oldest legislator runs, a sessicii
of the Arizona Legislature has ad
journed in daylight, it happened about
4:30-p. ni. in each house and was al
most devoid of ceremony. In the sen
ate, the president simply put the mo
tionand that was all. In the house
there was a bit more. Member Cook
reported that the governor advisad
the notification committee that If the
legislature had failed to pass a HoV
diers' voting bill, the executive would
have appeared before the house witn
a message. As it came out, he was
pleased with the session and wishes
the members uon voyage or words to
that effect. Mr. Cook had overcome
is natural diffidence and had de
livered an oration on the subject ol
-omen in the legislature and Mrs.
O'Neill responded with felicitous
words on behalf of herself. Mrs.
Marsh ami Mrs. McKay. Speaker
Jhns thanked the members, ataches
nrd oVen the nress, and the chaplain
asked a benediction. There had been
raised a resolution o? appreciation of
the work of Chief clerk Callahan and
his corps, which had. In the language
or the resolution, helped "in waging j
f ucccssful war against the maddened
attacks of a degenerated race."
The last day was a quiet one, save
in the room where was meeting tho
conference committee on the soldieri'
voting bill. It was one of good na
tnred expression, save when Winsor
told the senate how the house had
r? fused to listen to reason and would
have adjourned rather thin amend by
jot or tittle any feature of its nun vot
ing bill. The dairy bill, dragged from
a hou:-e grave, went through both
houses in quick time, which was even
surpassed by the speed of Claypool's
-enste bill 20. which had to do with
fnlse testimony in draft registration
cases. It had been forgotten and was
dug out of a drawer in the president's
desk. Then the president pot forget
ful and when he named the candidates
for governor on a committee to notify
the house, he sent Winsor, S'ltter and
Roberts and forgot Colter who then
sulked and refused to be a fourth mem
ber The dairy hill was resurrected by the
house without much trouble,, but had
ft narrow escape for its life' on final
passage, as the vote o' the speaker
was needed to make the exact two
tMrds for passage as on emergency
measure. Oddly, most of the opposi
tion came from Maricopa county,
whre dairying is the main Industry
end from which have come most of
the complaints of trouble with cream
eries jiileeed to be profiteering at the
expense of the milk producers. The
bill is a very lengthy one and several
members stated they voted against it
because it was not understandable. It
creates a new office, that of dairy
commissioner, at 5-'i0"0 a year, he to
appoint necessary deputies, suggest
ed for this post is Liu B. Orme, a
pioneer democrat, who mainly was in
strumental in getting the governor to
include dairv legislation in his -ail
and v ho lobbied the bill back to the
calendar aTter it had been killed in
the house. Most of the work will be
in Maricopa county, which has about
40,000 milch cows, probably four times
is manv as the rest of the state com
bined. Tempe and Glendale each has
an immense milk evaporating plan,
Phcenix has three creameries and a
condensing plant and creameries ex
's' in Yuma, Tucson and in the upper
Gila valley. This last locality now is
pending most of its milk to Camp
Cody. So great Is the demand from
.he mining camps that the .Salt River
valley now produces only about half
the butter consumed in the state.
The $25,00 appropriation lor ex
panse at the beginning of the special
session is expected to be enough, al
though exact figures cannot be had.
Many unpaid accounts are in the
bands of the commission of public in
structions, which did the legislative
contracting in advance. On the lasi
day there had to be a shifting o funds
to" the employes' account, which had
been drawn upon to the limit.
The conference committee on the
question of soldiers' voting got to
gether during the afternoon by the
simple process of adopting the house
bill. No. 3. introduced by Vanghan. as
a substitute for the much amended
Colter measure, No. 1, on the senate

"Did you ever have a good .time?" is
the question that Preston Winifred, a
young man of wealth and leisure, puU
to Linnie Randall, a sad but sweet
faced little beauty who officiates at
the perfumery counter in one of his
father's mammoth department store?.
Preston's folks as well as his aristo
cratic finance are off on a yachting
cruise, and the family mansion has
been left in charge of a discreet care
taker. So Preston offers to give Lin
nie the time of her life, asking her to
state each evening throughout he
week where she wants to go.
Will Preston be man enough to mar
ry the girl whose life he has broken
for a lark, or will he eventually mar
ry his frigid fiance, and le;-ve poor lit
tle Liniile to pay the price of a good
time? That is the problem which is
worked out in the final r.rel i f this
most original an3 intently dramatic
picture.

APAN-MEXICO
UNDER DEBATE.
BY U.S. SENATE
fBy Review Leased tV!rr)
WASHINUTOX. June 20. Japanese
intervention in Russia and activity of
German agents in Mexico in trying to
foment disturbances in this count
so as to retard prosecution of the war
were diseused in the senate today
during a debate, precipitated by Sen
ator Sherman of Illinois, republican.
Senator Sherman said Japan is anx
ious to enter Siberia because of the
menace that a Germanized Russia
would be to her, and desires Amer
ican and allied aid because she can
not undertake the expedition, alone.
"It is well understood," the senator
said, "that the United States opposes
action by Japan. Great Bri'ain an. I
France favor it. We must' trust Japan
and ask her to attack the government
that menaces her by making a drive
through Asia. The administration arAi
the seuate must take the responsi
bility for further delay."
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska,
chairman of the senate foreign rela
tions committee, in reply said:
"It is a great mistake to give out
the impression that Japan withes to
intervene"
He declared that Japan s r.o more
anxious to invade Russia than is "he
United States or any of ti.e allied
governments, and added that he riouut
ed that Japan would want to go in
even with American and allied aid.
Senator King of Utah, democrat, loir"
the senate that he kno wfrom offiical
sources that Senator Hitchcock was
correct and that "four weeks ago
Japan was opposed to sending an ex
pedition unless for her own protec
tion and that she was not then con
vinced that a military expedition
would be to her advantage."
Discussing German agents in Mex
ico, Senator Sherman said vigorous
steps should be taken against disturb
ing elements in this country who, co
operating with like groups in Mexico,
are planning violence in America at
.the instigation of German agents. Gor
man officials and military officers he
eaid, enjoy close relations with Car
ranza officials.
Warning against what he termed
more "watchful waiting" in Russia and
Mexico, Senator Sherman said he de
cided to awaken public opinion to the
necessity of opposing the effort, of the
Russian bolshevik government to re
cure recognition by the United States.
The American government he added,
may be asked within forty-eight hours
to recognize a bolshevik ambassidar
fro mRussia.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, June 20. Methods
by which contingent fee contract
agents in Washington suppressed com
petition in bidding on government war
order?,, inflated prices, manipulated
bids and even "dDublo crossed" their
own clients by representing competing
contractors, were uncovered today by
the department of justice in examining
correspondence seized in raids on the
contract brokers offices. ,
Some manufacturers paid thousands
of dollars for "purely imaginary ser
vices" of the contract agents, who
often turned over confidential informa
tion of bids to other clients or used
them to enter lower bids in theli own
names said a review of the findings
issued by Assistant Attorney General
George Huston Thompson, in charge
of the prosecutions. By representing
several competitive bidders at the
same time, agents sought to have man
ufacturers consider the brokers' offices
branches of the manufacturers' busi
ness supply the agent writh letterheads
and authority to represent the contrac
tor direct.
"Another favorite scheme was to get
quotations or options from several
manufactures who were thus elimi
nated from direct government bidding.
The agent, with the advantage of this
price knowledge, would then bid in his
own name and if awarded the contract,
proceed to fill it by exercising the
option given by the manufacturer who
quoted the lowest price to him. The
benefits of competition were thus ap
propriated by the agent instead of re
sulting in low prices to the government."

PREMIER PROGRAM IS
PROMISED FOR CAMP
The best boxing program ever seen
at Camp Harry J. Jones, at Douglas, is
promised by Lieut. W. C. Knox, ath
letic officer of the 308th cavalry, for
Friday night at the Enlisted Men's
club. Interest centers in the eight
round go between Andv Biddle. Seven
teenth cavalry, and McCarthy of the
same regiment. Biddle has knocked
out every man in camp he has been "put
up against so far and done it very
Quickly. He weighs 142 pounds.
McCarthy was a professional fighter
before joining the army, having been
in forty-five professional fights, in
cluding one with Young Sullivan. Hs
was active in the Longacre Athletic
club of New York City.
Corporal Burt, who knocked out Ben
nie Grant at the last smoker, will go
on with Frenchie Desmairis, a Pitts
bu'g boy who has never fought here
before. Desmairis will have to go a
lot if he gets Burt.
Charles Cooper, the Hawaiian cham
pion, and Eddie Diamond, who he
knocked out last time, will cross
gloves again. Diamond was not in con
dition. He is the fastest man on his
feet ever seen here and it is almost
impossible to hit him. He was once
sparring partner for Bennie Leonard
and is still very young.
The big fellow. O'Keefe. will go on

GOVERNMENT WILL
RECOMPENSE THOSE
INJURED ON ROADS
Perfect Plan Which Will Cut
Off "Ambulance Chasers"
and Prevent Anyone From
Preying on Misfortunes
Employes and passengers on the
railroads who are injured hereafter
will be compensated, witfiout the in
tervention of legal advisors, it was an
nounced yesterday at the B. P. & S. W.
railroad offices, as the result of the
rcecipt of a communication from John
Barton Payne, general counsel for tin
administration.
The announcement practically elimi
nates a larfe percentage of the incoma
of thousands of attorneys, and the en
tire income of an abundance of pr.ift.s
sional "fixers" and "witnesses," known
as "ambulance chasers," who made a
living heretofore by tipping attorneys
of the whereabouts of injured passen
gers in order to secure clients for suits
on contingent fees, in some casf
about half of the amount recovered i.i
suits.
The announcement solved the prob
lems which had been before the rail
road since the railways were taken
over, which was how was the compen
sation for Injuries to be arrived at.
since suit cannot be brought agains't
the government. The communication
from Mr. Payne declares that compen
sation will be paid after investigation
to the person injured, that none of tho
money will be permitted to pass
through the hands of attorneys, and
further, if the injured have made con
tracts with attorneys .they may bo
broken by the executive heads of the
government and the attorney awarded
by payment for services actually rend
ered. DRAFT EVADERS MAY
ALL EE INDICTED
The department of justice ha3 ad
vised Thomas Flynn. United State at
torney, that the department receives
from time to time information showing
that many citizens of the United
States have escaped to foreign coun
tries in order to avoid military duty.
Attorney General Gregory state
that it is the desire of the department
of justice that Indictments should bo
returned in every case of this charac
ter where the facts in the opinion or
the federal attorney are sufficient to
support an indictment. The attorney
general believes that the indictments
should be returned regardless c.f th
fact that there is no immediate prob
ability of apprehending the slackers
who shirks his duty.
In all cases of this type coming to
the attention of the department of jus
tice information will be forwarded to
the special agent in chajgo of that
work at Phoenix and he will make a
thoro'.:.?h .investigation of the matter.
Iu many cases the special agents will
be supplied by the department of jus
tice with information in the form of
intercepted letters and other docu
mentary proof, necessary to establish
the fact of foreign residence.
No doubt many cases of local slack
ers who have moved across the Mex
ican border since the passing of tle
draft act have come under the atten
tion of tne federal attorney and th
suggested method of returning indict
ments in these cases will In all prob
ability prevent men who have left t'n:.;
country to evade service, from ever
returning to their native land.

MADE INVASION.
A number of the citizens of Douglas
were in the city yesterday endeavoring
to secure signatures to the court hous
removal petition. They did not meet
with the success that they expected.
Thev secured the signatures of some
who did not know the condition of
the matter. They did not explain to
those whose signature they secured
that the Warren district had no chance
to get the court house with the law as
it now stands and that Douglas Is the
only town that has a chance at the
present time to take it away from
Tombstone. If they wanted to do the
square thing why do they wait until
the law has been amended and give
Warren, Lowell and some of the oth
er towns in the Warren district a
chance.
