BREST, Dec. 13 (By the
Associated Press). President
Wilson landed in France at
3:24 o'clock this afternoon,
amid a demonstration of popu
lar enthusiasm and national
sympathy such jas Irarely, if
ever, has been accorded the
head of a foreign government
visiting France. The presi
dent left Brest at 4 o'clock
this afternoon for Paris, where
the heart of France will ac
claim him tomorrow as the
nation's guest.
The landing of the president was
not only a remarkable spectacle with
notable naval pageant for its back
ground, but it also marked the first
entry of an American president into
personal contact with Europe and its .
affairs
Although the presidential fleet ar
rived at Brest shortly after noon K
was not until after 3 o'clock that
President and Mrs. Wilson debarked j
an a harbor boat and set foot on the !
soil of France. Vast crowds watch
ed the trip ashore and the fleets of
warships roared a salute as the last
stage of the journey was accomp
lished. On the harbor boat going ashore the
president was seen standing on the
upper deck with JuleB J. Jusserand,
French ambassador to the United
States, who pointed out the historic
walls and monuments of the ancient i
city. j
As the boat touched the pier the j
French and American guards of honor
presented arms and the strains of the

the cheers' of the great multitude.

WASHINGTON. Thursday, Dec. 12.
(By Wireless to the Associated Press.)
President Wilson's last night aboard
the ship that bore him to France to
attend the peace conference at er
sallies was memorable. It was marked
personnel of the Bhip which greatly
. V. .1 kin.
President Wilson and ' Mrs. Wilson
had attended a moving picture show
aboard the George Washington and
when the show had ended and they
were ready to depart a great chorus
of bluejackets, unannounced, entered
the salon and sang two verses of
"God Be With You Till We Meet
Again."
After the singing the president ex
pressed his appreciation of the sig
nificance of the words of the old
hymn, especially as coming from men
of all walks of life, many of them
former prosperous business men who
had sacrificed their interests in serv
ing their country in time of need.
At the conclusion of the singing
the orchestra burst forth with "Auld
Lang Syne," and the voices of the
whole ship's company were rased to
the tune, which must have been heard
on the decks of the torpedo boat de
stroyer convoy a quarter of a mile
off. The president bowed his ac
knowledgments to the sailors, but he
left the sajon without delivering an
address.'
Remain Two Months.
President Wilson will remain in
Europe probably two months, return- i
ing to Washington, if Indications pre
vail that his presence is necessary.
Just before the close of the present i
congress. If later he is required at
the peace table, itis said he will not
hesitate tcretufn to France. It Is
known, however, that he hopes to I
avoid this latter contingency and that
all affairs .requiring his counsel will
be disposed of before the middle of
February refreshed and invigorated
by ten days at sea. President Wilson
is In excellent physical condition for
the hard work ahead of him. From
the time the GeoYge Washington
passed out of sight of the Statue of
Liberty the American executive has
exercised consistently. He has rested
a great, deal, but still has found time
for much work in dally conferences
and with state papers. He has made
appointment, accepted resignations
and signed pardons, and conducted by
wireless, probably for the first time
in history as the head of any nation,
more work than ever before has been
accomplished in this manner. Mean
while, he has been In constant touch
with the American officials in Wash
ington and Paris.
Enjoys Voyage Greatly.
President Wilson seemingly has
thoroughly enjoyed the voyage. Noth
ing ha3 pleased him more than the
moving picture taken of him with the
cssembled crew on the forward deck,
in which the president shook hands
with every one, from the grimy fire
room gang men to the men of the
epper deck. He has spent the eve
nings at the bluejacket amateur shows
and posed generously for hundreds of
snapshot pictures by officers and
men. He has read the Bhip's daily
paper without fail and generally has
attended the nightly moving picture
shows.
President Wilson has expressed
much enjoyment at the singing of the
sailors' quartet. At target practice
and In signalling maneuvers he always
has been one of the most interested
of the spectators.
Refuses Most Invitations.
Invitations from Europe have been
coming In large numbers by wireless,
but President Wilson has been uni
form in declining them and trying to
cut down the number of official func
tions arranged for blm to a minimum.
He has summarily rejected all Invita
tions which might be liable to con
strue as meaning that he is on a
pleasure trip.
It is said that President Wilson
feels he cannot forego a visit to the
American troops at the front or a visit
to the devastated regions of France,
and that he Intends to crowd such
visits into his absences from Paris
np to January 3, when the peace con
ference gets down to business. Dur
ing the succeeding six weeks he will
conduct his daily business at the
Murat palace, the nmc as at the
white house, surrounded by his clerks,
advisers and attendants.

WASHINGTON,- Dec. 13. Tele

duced in the house by Chairman
Moon of the postoffice commit
tee. Mr. Moon said the measure
had been drafted in consultation
with Postmaster General Burle
son, who had informed him that
tho legislation was approved by
President Wilson.
The resolution was referred to the
postoffice committee which soon will
begin hearings on it.
Government control and operation
of the telegraph and telephone lines
is limited by the existing resolution
to the period of the war, but under
the measure offered , today it would
continue "until otherwise ordered by
congress." The resolution directs the
postmaster general to negotiate con
tract for the purchase of the tele
phone lines subject to the' approval
of congress and (o have an appraise!
made aa to the value of the teregraph
property.
The right of the government to
purchase the telegraph systems is
given under an existing law, accord
ing to administration officials. This
law, passed in 1866, was designed to
give government aid in the construc
tion of telegraph and provided that
the privileges of operations given the
companies were non-transferable ex
cept that the government might pur
chase the property.
Provision was made for the appoint
ment of five disinterested persons to
appraise the properties should the
government decide to purchase them.
Two of the appraisers would be named
by the postmaster general, two by
the companies and the fifth by these
four men.

a large assemblage of army officers.!
Secretary Baker laid stress upon the
fact thai it was won through elti
cient service, both in France as chief

army, and at home as chief of. staff.
Secretary Baker said H was to him
a peculiaily happy circumstance that
the recommendation that General
March be decorated had come from
the commander of the American' cx
nprtitionnrv forces. While the whole
raendhtlorl ttiat other officers who
have contributed largely to the suc

to remain in the United States, be
awarded decorations. For himself, he
took pride in the fact that the recom

come through regular ' military chan

with pleasure to what Mr. Baker had
said to him personally o( his services

General Pershing's recommendation,
which reached the war department on
December 7, was as follows:
"It is recommended that the dis

Gen. Peyton C. March, chief of staff,
U. S. A., for exceptionally meritorious

IS IMPORTANT READJUSTMENT
NEW YORK, Dec. 13. The state
ment made today in Washington that
the war department is to turn back
to Lhe trade routes 800,000 deadweight
capacity tons of shipping was viewed
in shipping circles here as one of the
most important readjustments an
nouncements that has been made
since the signing of the armistice.
Representations made recently to
Washington by the chamber of com
merce here showed that more than
170,000 tons of export freight was tied
up in New York alone and that unless
early relief from the shortage of ton
nage was granted manufacturers and
exporters would face heavy losses.
The understanding here is that the
ships designated for trade purposes
will notbe returned directly to the
owners but will be turned back by the
war department to the United States
shipping board and by that body allo
cated to various trades, principal
among which will be South and Cen
tral American commerce.
The necessity of getting the Amer
ican troops home as quickly as pos
sible and the recent decision tq use for
transports some of the larger vessels
engaged in carrying freight exclusive
ly will prevent, it is understood, the
turning to trade purposes of a con
siderable number of the larger ships
for some time to come. Work of fill
ing up a number of these freighters
with troop accommodations is now un
der way here.

Commercial Cable company in the
courts.
In discussing his appointment this
afternoon, Mr. Carlton stated emphati
cally that he did not favor govern
ment ownership of the cable system
which, he said, would give the best
service under the stimulus of private
ownership. He expressed the firm
belief, however, that consolidation
and expansion would result in an
adequate ail-American cable system
which would facilitate the efforts of
American busines firms to meet for
eign competition in export trade.
Explaining the Commercial Cable
company's attitude, Mr. Ward tonight
issued the following statement:
"The Commercial Cable company, of
course, objects to the whole procedure
of unifying the cable properties, which
is being done for purposes that have
no bearing whatsoever upon war ne

by our legal action, but I resard it

(Special to Th Rovit-wl
PHOENIX. Arix.. Dec. 13. There
will be no relaxation on the part of
fair price boards of Arizona in pre
venting profiteering and in seeing that
both the merchants and public get a
square deal, it was stoutly affirmed at
the state headquarters of the food ad
ministration today.
Timothy A. Kiordan, the federal
food administrator for Arizona, has
sent out a letter to the chairmen of
the 34 fair price boards of this state
pointing out that although the govern
ment has made the maximum margin
of profit sufficiently large to cover all
cases this does not mean that these
I margins should be taken advantage of
to the fullest extent.
"The new margins." ha says, "are
considerably higher than heretofoia
and are designed to protect those mer
chants who are located in remote dis
tricts away from the railroad and
whose cost of doing busines is natu
rally murh higuer than in the more
thickly populated communities con
venient H the railroad."
. ' We quite realize." he continues,
"that all merchants can take full ad
vantage of these margins without be
ing technically guilty of profiteering,
but morally that is preciiely hat
they would be doing."
The prime object of the fair price
boards is to prevent profiteering and
see that both the merchants.and pub
lic get a square deal, and we think you
will agree with us that it is grossly
unfair for merchants doing business
with the minimum of expense to take
advantage of the maximum margin of
profit which is iutended to apply only
to dealers who by reason of their lo
cation and lack of railroad and other
facilities are forced to charge the max
imum margins of profit in order to
carry on their business."

As long as England, France and Amer

be peace in the world, for no other com

"It was all right when a French girl,

he wanted it planted," chuckles the Ful

Holland will surrender the ex-kaiser and

very kind of Holland. And a Dutch states
man goes on to say that his country has a

time in four years Holland is getting assert
ive. She was afraid to say her soul was
her own while under the Potsdam shadow.
But now she presumes upon the well
known tolerance of the allies and their re
pugnance towards chastening small pow
ers, no matter how great their .offense.
However, Holland will do exactly what the
peace conference decides she shall do. And
she will do it quickly and completely, with
out any conversation or even a grimace.

since the Middle Ages has so large a por

to anarchy and civil strife. Every sup

THOSE GERMAN COLONIES
The London Spectator hopes that Amer
ica will take over the German colonies in
Africa. The world knows how cruel find
brutal Germany has been in the past to
these natives, and how they have been re
duced under German rule to one-third of
their former population. And the world
' will never consent- to the continuance of
German control over these tribes. But the
Spectator fears that America will not as
sume this added responsibility in the way
of the white man's burden. On this subject
it says: ....
"If we rule out internationalism, as
clearly we must, who else could undertake
the job? We are confident that the French,
even though they may, and indeed almost
certainly will, find it necessary to take over
Togoland and the Kamerun. would re
gard further African colonial possessions
as a burden and an obligation, rather than
a benefit. The only other possible power
besides ourselves is, therefore. America.
And here we may say with complete frank
ness and truth that the majority of the
British people, and we believe of the peo
ple of the dominions, would be delighted
to see the Americans take over and pro
tect and develop as large a part of the ex
colonies of Germany as they could be in
duced to accept. They are good, not bad,
neighbors, and neither Australia, nor New
Zealand, nor South Africa, nor the Colon
ial Office, as representing British East Af
rica, would do anything but welcome them
as successors to Germany. We are not,
however, going to pretend that we are un
aware of the dislike of the people of the
United States to extending their overseas
possessions. In spite of great provocation,
and not only disturbance but actual outrage
on their borders, the American people, a3
we know, absolutely refused to accept any
territorial responsibility in Mexico or in
any part of South America. We feel cer
tain that they would tell us that the burdens
which they have taken in the Philippine Is
lands and in the Isthmus of Panama afford
them not only as much external responsi
bility as they desire, but a good deal more."
"LEAVE OUR DEAD IN FRANCE"
(From the N. Y. Independent.)
On hearing that the government pro
posed to bring back for burial in this coun
try the bodies of American soldiers fallen
abroad, ex-President Roosevelt writes to
General March, chief-of-staff :
Mrs. Roosevelt and I wish to eiter a most re
spectful, but most emphatic, protest against the pro
posed course, so far as our son, Quentin, is concerned.
We have always believed that "Where the tree falls,
there let .it lie."
We know that many good persons feel entirely
different, but to us it is painful and harrowing, long
after death, 'to move the poor body, from which the
scul has fled. We greatly prefer that Quentin shall
lie on the spot where he fell in battle and where the
foeman burried him.
In reply, General March says he is in en
tire sympathy with Mr. Roosevelt's atti
tude, and that General Pershing has
authority to . pursue the same course
in cases where the relatives express a simi
lar wish. We hope that most of them will
join the ex-president in this protest, for the
transportation of corpses long distances is a
heathenish custom. We think it absurd in
the Chinese that on traveling abroad they
insist on providing for the return of their
remains to the Celestial Kingdom, in whicfy
they were born.
Our-boys, who have made the supreme
sacrifice, have earned the right to rest in
peace in the Jand they helped to free. The
idea of disinterment is equally repugnant
to sense and sentiment. The money it
would cost were better spent in saving the
lives of the starving children of Europe.
The truer feeling about this was voiced in
the sonnet written by Rupert Brooke short
ly before he sailed with the British Medi
terranean expeditionary force in February,
1915, and died in the Aegean:
If I should die, think only this of me:
That there's some corner of a foreign
field
That is for ever England. There shall be
In that rich earth a richer dust
concealed ;
A dust whom England bore, shaped, made
aware.

ways to roam, j

WASHINGTON. Dec. 13. All gov
ernment regulation affecting raw cot
ton, ended today with the dissolution
of the cotton distribution committee
of the war industries board.
While there was no announcement,
either by Chairman Charles J. Brand
of the committee, or by Chairman
Baruch, of the war industries board,
as to the consideration which led to
the decision to abolish the committee,
it was understood that officials no
longer regarded it as necessary to
control distribution, now that the
world markets have been re-opened
with the ending of the war.
The committee appointed by Presi
dent Wilson to Investigate the .gen
era! cotton situation, waB dissolved
several weeks ago, after it had re
ported to the president that there
was no necessity for fixing- a price
for the various grades of raw cotton.
Another action by the government
today, affecting cotton, was the allo
cation by the shipping boanj or two
ships of 21.200 tons for the cotton
carrying trade, ine luriue 01 uu
tons, waa ordered to Galveston, to
load cotton for England, and the Chal
leneencer. 11,800 tons, was sent to
New Orleans to load also for English
ports.
In making this announcement to
day, Bainbridge Colby of the shipping
board, said that great quantities of
cotton are awaiting transportation,
and that he is "very hopeful of being
able to follow up these allocations
shortly with additional tonnage," as it
is released from war requirements.

DONT SUFFER .
Vr
Use Soothing Musterole
When those sharp pains go shooting
through your head, when your skull
seems as if it would split, just rub a
little Musterole on your temples and
neck. It draws out the inflammation,
soothes away the pain, usually giving
quick relief.
Musterole is a dean, white ointment,
made with oil of mustard. Better than a
mustard plaster and does not blister.
Many doctors and nurses frankly rec
ommend Musterole for sore throat, bron
chitis, croup, stiff neck, asthma, neural
gia, congestion, pleurisy, rheumatism,
lumbago, pains and aches of the back or
oints, sprains, sore muscles, bruises,
chilblains, .frosted feet -- colds of the
chest (it often prevents pneumonia). It

when humanity, sympa
thizing with the misfor
tunes of others, replaces war-torn,
seared faces with new when It hides
honorable disfigurations gained In the
defense of liberty then there is
story worth while the telling.
This, then,' Is the story of "Old
Faces For New." It is a recital pa
thetic and pitiable; it Is a tale of
men's glory and woman's devotion; it
Is a song of sympathy and humanity
of practical Christianity of material

Since time began wounds received in
battle were considered badges of hon
or. Men gloried in them; women ad
mired. But that was before the com
ing of modern armament of shell and
shrapnel of mines and poison gas. In
those other, more bnmane days, scars
of battle wounds were considered sa
ced. As the late William Shakespeare
or was it Bacon? said: "He laughs
at scars who never felt a wound."
But things have changed since then.
Not that scars are not marks of re
spect, but some mutilations are so re
pulsive as to evoke horror mixed with
pity. Wounds in the face and head
leave the ugliest marks. In the pres
ent war hundreds and thousands of
fine men have been torn and mutilated
until they scarce resemble human be
ings, rhotographs received in this
country show men ' with their lower

thy was needed something which
would hide their awful scars and dis
figurations. To replace a missing arm
or leg or hand or foot is easy enough
Bnt to replace a face or the part of
one that was a real problem.
And a woman solved that problem !
It is true Oiat a mere man. Captain
Derwent Wood, an English sculptor.
conceived the idea of making masks
for the mutiles, but It remained for
Mrs. Maynard Ladd. an American
sculptor, living In Paris, to perfect the
work and to materialize masks which
would replace torn and missing tissue
so naturally that the wearer would be
able to live out his life In comparative
happiness.
Mrs. Ladd Is an artist of inlrmatlon
al repute. Born In Philadelphia, she
was educated in private schools, goin
to Paris and Rome, where for more
than twenty years she worked with
Professors Ferrari and Gallori. She
exhibited In the Paris salon. In this
country and In London. In 1913 she
exhibited forty bronzes at Gorham's
In New York and at the Corcoran Art
Gallery In Washington. She received
an honorable mention for her work at
the Panama Exposition. Incidentally
she Is an author, having published sev
eral novels.
Captain Wood's original conception
was to make a mask to fit those por
tions of the face missing. If the chin
was missing then the mask would ex
tend only over the chin. If the cheek
was missing then the scarred portion
would be covered. The question to be
solved by Mrs. Ladd was In the manu
facture of the masks. They had to be
light, yet strong, of some composition
which would not tarnish and would re
tain the color placed upon its exterior
surface.
Adjusting
THE- MASK
After considerable experimentation
Mrs. Ladd hit uron thin copper as hav
ing sufficient strength. Then she de
cided to have the bsce plated with sil
ver to give It a better finish. Next
came the method to be employed In fit
ting the masks. Consultations willi
surgeons brought to light the fact that
nothing could bo done with mr.t'.ics
until several months after their v.-oi!nr!s
had healed completely, as Uc tls.iurs
contracted ever, nfter complete cicatri

Eventually a h : led method :is
evolved. When the r.mtile ls leen

torn face. If possible she obtains a
photograph of the inutile taken before
he received the wounds.
From the photograph and the plaster
east Mrs. Ladd, guided by her sculp
tor's art, reconstructs another plaster
cast of only those parts which are mu
tilated. Then a copper mask Is made
one-sixteenth of an inch thick. Then
comes the first fitting.
If the mask so far as finished fits
properly then it Is silver plated.- Next
ccmes the question of making the mssk
cr:xar natural. If eyebrows are need
ed t'.iey arc Inserted hair h.v hair: If
eyelids are mlsm artificial eyelids
r.i!;ir:i the mask, with a hula tV.ruiish'
are missing altogether then artificial
eyes are placed In the mask.
When the mask la complete the mo
llis goes for a final fitting. Mrs. Ladd
adjusts the mask or has one of her ex
pert assistants attend to the task. The
mask Is held In place by "fake" eye
glasses and strings or by a wig, the
attaching mechanism being so camou
flaged as to be practically Invisible.
But the work Is not yet done. One
of the most Important operations In Its
manufacture. Is In the coloring. Mrs.

mask to match the complexion of the

honor. The day the armistice was
signed, he said, plants lor the manu-.
facture of the standard gases were in
operation with a manufacturing capac
ity greater than that or England and
France combined. This capacity would i
have been trebled in the case of cer-1
tain gases before the beginning of the i
new year. .
General Sibert revealed the fa,ct .
that his department had perfected a
new type of gas mask for the defense I
of te American army which was farj
superior in every respect to any masK j
used by either the enemy or tho allied
forces. He added that 400,000 of these
masks had been produced wheu the
war ended. . j
Speaking of the work done to equip'
the army with gas shells and new and
more terrible poisonous vapors, Col. j
W. II. Waiker, in charge of produc-j
tion, said that the great plant con-1
strutted at Kdgvwood, Maryland, was'
"the most deadly institution since
time iH'gati." The work in progress 1
there bus been carefully guarded .here-'
tofore, but Colonel Walker told some-;
thinn of the enormous quantities of j
poisonous gnses tliat were being turn- j
ed out mid shipped abroad when tho
lighting ended. While he gave no
figurc, lie indicated that casualties
among tile ealixted men who handled
these deadly products at the plant
"would be hard to match ou the buttle

Both vessels were given the warm

10, the sixth division was ordered
forward to reinforce the fifth, his
company had to cross a wheatfield in
broad daylight, hammered by German
artillery and faced with innumerable
machine gun nests.
"Down went our men, one after an
other," he said. "We had started at
daybreak, but it was dusk when we
reached a stream at which we were
to stop.. The Germans had a line on
that place, but under cover of dark
ness we dug ourselves in, firing only
when we saw spurts of German fire."
Marks said the wotvt firing began
when only five of his comrades were
left and that "it was useless for us
to keep on fighting against such odds
unless we could secure a machine
gun." He said that two of them,
therefore, had crawled into no man's
land and come back with three guns
which had been cast aside, by the
Germans.

PEACE ON AUSTRIA
VIENNA. Wednesday, Dec. 11, (P.y
the Associated Press! Count Czernin.
former Austro-Hungarian foreign min
ister, gave the correspondent an op
portune y today to read a copy of the
letter which he sent to Emperor
Charles in April, 1H17, in which the
minister declared that the condition
of Austria was growing desperate. In
the letter. Count Czernin told the em
peror that he did not think another
winter campaign was possible and as
sert ed'it was necessary that peace ne
gotiations should be begun.
The letter, which was referred to in
interviews Count Czernin gave the cor
respondent last week, follows:
"Ypur Majesty, it is evident our
military power is on the verge of ex
haustion, i need but instance the com
plete drying up of the sources of man
power and the despair w hich has tak
en hold of all portions of the popula
tion who are so underfed that the mis
ery of war can no longer be borne by
them.
"Though I hope that we may suc
ceed in holding out during the next
few months and in maintaining a suc
cessful defensive. I am quite con
vinced that another winter campaign
is thoroughly impossible. At all costs
the war must be brought to a conclu
sion in the summer or the early part
of the autumn. It is essential that
peace negotiations should be started
before the waning of our strength is
appreciated clearly by our enemies.
"Should we approach the entente
when conditions in the interior of the
empire leave no doubt of our imme
diate collapse, it would be futile to be
lieve that the entente would grant
conditions unless they were equivalent
to the complete annihilation of the
central powers."
Count Czernin's letter paints a dark
and gloomy picture of conditions in
the empire and continues:
"There is danger of revolution
which threatens the whole of Europe
which is supported by England and
represents her latest mode of warfare.
i "Five sovereigns have been dethron
ed under conditions which give rise to
serious thought. It is no use arguing
against this fact by saying that condi
tions in Aditria-Hungary are different,
or that the monarchial system is so
deeply rooted in Vienna and Berlin
that a similar danger does not exist
there."

FOR PRESIDENT
(Cuiilinm-d from I'mie om.-i
actually- have less baef-'age on board
the Georpe Washington than some of
the minor attaches of the peace party.
The degree to be conferred on Pres
ident Wilson by the University of
Paris will, it is said, be the first hon
orary degree to be given by this seat
of learning. Likewise, the degree to
be given the president by the Uni
versity of Rome will be unique in the
annals of that university so far as a
'foreigner is concerned.
When the George Washington
teaches France the vessel will return
at once to New York with wounded
men and others of the American
forces, both olticcrs and privates,
reaching her destination In time for
Christmas.
Will Discuss Problems.
It is said that President Wilson's
conferences with entente statesmen
during the next few days undoubtedly
will center on questions urrouudinp
the proposed league of nations and
the definition of "freedo m of the
seas," and possibly also on the ques
tion of indemnity. On the question
of the league of nations there will be
discussion, it is said, whether the
league shall be provided in the
treaties of peace or later. It is known
to be President Wilson's position that
the peace treaties should embody
agreements to create a league ot na
tions. It is also ttnown to be his con
viction that there is strong necessity
lor establishing, upon a very clear
definition, freedom of the seas.
"Freedom of Seas."
The much discussed Point Two jn
Presided Wilson's 14 essential points
of peace, on which Great Britain has
reserved decision, is said to be not
intended to specify unqualified free
dom ot the seas outside territorial
waters, but only to stipulate that no
single nation shall restrict freedom
and that when freedom is restricted
it shall be only by a concrete power
enforcing international covenants. It
is expected that the president will ap
proach what may be differences in
opinion rather than of principle and
that he will rely upon open minded
conferences ad processes which will
ot iuvolve unnecessary antagonism.
It is said to be his attitude thai
neither the United States nor the
other governments should assume the
role of master and that he believes
he - is supported by public - opinion
generally as to the agreement to be
sought for between peoples rather
than governments, as essential to a
people's war.
Disarmament Question.
The reduction of armaments pro
posed in President Wilson's 14 points
specifies reductions not below do
mestic safety, and statesmen seem to
be agreed that no reduction of do
mestic armaments without interna
tional safety is expected.
The attitude of President Wilson
witL regard to indemnity is generally
believed to be that the necessity for
the payment of a great sum will be
justified only if based on most care
ful and judicial consideration. The
president is said to agree fully with
the entente premiers as to the great
wrongs of military power, but to feel
most strongly that the ways of rlsht
ing theia r.; ist be consistent with the
objects of the war. It is asserted that
he thinks the right procedure would
be first a careful determination of
justice of demands for reparation for
damage and then the determination
of the method of payment, and the
possibility of obtaining payments.
The decisions reported to have been
reached on these vital subjects by the

$1760 NECESSARY
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Ills.. Dec. 13 William F.
Ogburn, examiner for the federal war
labor board, declared that companies
not able to pay $1760 a year to adult
employes or what he termed the
"budget of reasonable comfort and
health" should "be put out of busi
ness by the state," at the hearing be
fore Judge Samuel Alschuler, federal
arbitrator, of the department of pack
ing house employes for higher wages
and improved working conditions.
"This is not an excessive figure,"
he said, "but I know that public
opinion is not strong enough to force
these companies out of business by
boycott or similar methods. Perhaps
public opinion is not even in favor of
this figure, but living below this
budget is not living decently."
Prof. Ogburn was formerly of the
faculty of the Washington State uni
versity and testified as an expert wit
ness for the employes regarding liv
ing conditions.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Dec. 13. Operations
lu the stock market today consistently
iollowed the lines of least resistance,
average prices and the volume of trad
ing declining almost to lowest levels
of the week.
Almost 50 per cent of the nominal
turnover during the early and inter
mediate stages of the session was
represented by half a dozen issues,
all of the more speculative ariety.
Price changes until the final hour
were rather mixed, with a preponder
ance of loBes, but the entire list
broke sharply toward the end, cop
pers reflecting especial weakness on
reports of a .cut in the metal to 19
cents.
inves:ment rans wnicn were in
clined to improve after a listless fore
noon, reversed their course with ship
pers, oils, motors and fertilizers,
though rallying slightly at the close.
Utilities, notably local tractions, in
which weakness spread to bonds,
were under constant pressure, prob
ably as a result of recent unfavor
able statement of earnings. Total
sales amounted to 415.000 shares.
Call money wis offered as low as
4 per cent, but 6 per cent was the
ruling rate, with a minimum of time
funds.
Bonds were irregular, foreign issues
easing slightly and liberty bonds
steadying after early declines. Total
sales, per value, aggregated $9,400,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
A3 DUN'S SEES IT.
NEW YORK, Dec. 13. Dun's to
morrow will say:
"Not without some accompanying
inconvenience, but with little actual
unsettlement, the country has passed
through the first month of transition
to a peace basis with many of the
necessary changes already effected
While the process of readjustment,
involving a general transformation of
production and labor and process, is
yet from from completed, a more
natural situation is steadily return
ing with the lessening or elimination
of various restrictions which have
prevented the development of regu
lar commerce. The ending, with the
present year, of official supervision
of the steel trade, except as to em
bargoes, is a further important step
in the direction of restoring condi-i
tions to a pre-war footing, and leading
industries are each week - becoming
freer from arbitrary restraints and
regulations. With government work
not now monopolizing supplies of raw
materials and of labor in about every
quarter, some private projects which
have been long deferred are being
started, and there is also increasing
evidence of buying to replenish de
pleted stocks of merchandise.
"Weekly bank clearings, $5,940,400,
584." WOOL UNSETTLED.
BOSTON. Mass., Dec. 13. The Com
mercial Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"English manufacturers who will
be of government control within two
weeks, except that wopl will continue
to be rationed for some time. The
South American market has slumped
10 to 15 points within the last week,
stocks accumulating there with sales
small.
"The manufacturers here are for
the most part waiting the sales and
the goods markets are dull. Every
one appears to be waiting tq see what
me course oi tne wool auctions
will be."
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, III., Dec. 13. Increased
rural buying together with adverse
weather lifted the corn market today
to the highest prices yet this season.
The close was unsettled 2 to 2
net advance, with January $1.3S; to
$1.38 and May $1.38 to $1.38.
Oats gained Vi to IV. The outcome
in provisions ranged from 22c decline
to a rise of 45c.
Sentiment in favor of the bull side
of the corn market gathered force
almost from the outset. Buying at
first was of a scattered sort and ap
peared to be due chiefly to the fact
that mild temperatures and excessive
rain had made country roads diffi
cult for deliveries from farms, and
would tend to hamper the crop move
ment. Reports indicating that more
over the majority of producers were
inclined to seek decidedly higher
prices on account of the government
crop figures led afterward to a broad
general demand in which the country
took a conspicuous part. Profit tak
ing eased the market toward the last,
but all offering were readily ab
sorbed, j
Oats, like corn, responded to en-1
larged outside buying. Exporters,
though, were said to have withdrawn
from the market. Although weakness j
in thehog market had a temporary

KISS MAKES HIT.
June Caprice gave the audience at
the Eagle theater a good laugh yester
day when she appeared in her latest
William Fox photoplay, "A Camou
flage Kiss." The dainty June gets
mixed up in a pork and bean episode
that Just oozes with humor. Her brother-in-law,
whose pork business is bad,
combines with a bean manufacturer
who is in love with Juno. He's shy,
however, and foolishly gets another
man to steal a kiss from June in the
dark, hoping to make June believe he
did it. But the real kisser kisses June
in the daylight and then it's all of:
for the pork man because June knows
the real thing from the sample. The
Camouflage Kiss will be shown again
today.
