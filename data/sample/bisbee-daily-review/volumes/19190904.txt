RESTORATION OF
SHANTUNGBYTHE
JAPANESE IN ONE
YEAR IS PROMISED
Jap Peace Delegate, On His
Arrival In New York uity
From Paris, Says Japan To
Fulfill 'Pledae To China
TO WITHDRAW ALL OF
SOLDIERS AND POLICE
Will Give China Back Cables,
Railroads and Other German
Holdings; Is Waiting Only To
Get Papers From Germany
NEW YORK, Sept. 3. Restitution
of the province of Shantung to China
by Japan within a year was predicted
here today by Yosuke Matsuoka, sec
retary in the foreign department of
Japan, and a member of the Japanese
peace delegation. Mr. Matsuoka has
Just arrived here from Paris on his
way to Japan.
I should not be at all surprised"
he said, 'if our government opened
within a very few months, or even
a few weeks, negotiations with the
Chinese government, with a view of
settling the Shantung question in a
way satisfactory to all."
Pledge to Withdraw.
In a statement on the Shantung
question, Mr. Matsuoka said:
"To those of us who have partici
pated in the peace conference there
is not the shadow of doubt that Japan
will withdraw from Shantung at the
earliest possible moment. The peace
treaty requires Germany to hand ov
er tc Japan all the documents rela
tive to Shantung within three months
after the treaty comes into force.
"When thi3 is done, Japan will imme
diately take steps toward the restitu
tion which Japan has pledged herself
to make in favor of China.
"The terms on which Japan will
restitute Shantung are now fairly
Jtnown to the world. Briefly stated,
the main points of these terms are:
Terms of Restitution.
"First, Japan to restore Kiao Chow,
the German leased territory to China.
"Second, in returning Kiao Chow
to China, Japan in the Interest of all
nations asks only one thing, namely,
that the territory be open to interna
tional trade. It is only as a natural
corollary of this proposed measure
that Japan also desires to establish
an international, not a Japanese set
tlement in the city of Tsing Tao. In
the Chinese-Japanese agreement of
May 25, 1915, a Japanese settlement
was to have been established in addi
tion to an internal one, but Viscount
Uchida, our foreign minister, declared
on August 6, last, that Japan would
wave the right to establish a Japan
ese settlement.
Take Army From Shantung.
"Third, Japan will withdraw all her
troops not only from the railway zone '
but from Tsing Tao. After the resti
tution of Kiao Chow not a single Jap
anese soldier will be left on the soil
of Shantung. ,
"Fourth, the' Shantung railway of
270 miles will . be operated not by
Japan, but by a Chino-Japanese joint
corporation, in which both Chinese
and Japanese capital will be repre
sented. Of course China will partici
pate in the management of this rail
road. To Withdraw Jap Police.
"Fifth, Japan will withdraw her po
lice forces from along the railway and
entrust the Chinese authorities with
the policing of that region.
"Besides the matters included in
the above five categories, there are
questions of the German submarine
cables, railway loans and preferential
rights with regard to supply of capi
tal and materials and the employment
of foreigners in Shantung. 1 believe
these questions can easily be settled.
"I do .not wish to say that these
wj'l be the exact terms, but I am pre
pared to declare that our overture to
China will be along these lines. Let
me emphasize once more that these
negotiations will be entered into with
in a very rhort time. The solemn
pledge she (Janan) has given to Chi
na before the whole world will be
carried out under all circumstances.
"Japan has taken nothing from Chi
na in Shantung, but proposes to give
her much. What we have taken it
Shantung was taken from Germany,
not China. 1 This point cannot be too
strongly emphasized."

Dy united states military forces in
connection with the attack yesterday
on an army airplane, has been elimi
nated, it was indicated here tonight,
oy the admission of Mexican author!
ties today that the attack was made
by Carranza soldiers. While official
information was lacking, he impres
sion was gained in army circles that
this admission has removed the sit
uation from the hands of the military
so far as emergency action is con
cerned and placed it directly up to
Washington for proper diplomatic ac
tion.
Mexican Consul Garcia said a com
plete report had been made to Mex
ico City with a request for instruc
tions as to punishment for those
guilty.
One point of difference tonight be
tween Mexican and American reports
was the location of the airplane
when the attackers fired the opening
volley Into It. Conaul Garcia declar
ed an investigation shows it was one
kilometer inside the Mexican border,
while unofficial American reports in
sist the plane was in United States
territory at the time.
The Mexicans fired at the aviators.
Consul Garcia said, merely to cause
them to fly higher as their airplane
was frightening their horses grazing
nearby.
The consul said they did not intend
to hit the aviators or their plane.
The wound sustained by Captain D.
V. McNabb, one- of the fliers, is
healing rapidly, it was said tonight,
and no complications are expected.
His companion. Lieutenant von Deb
Johnson, was uninjured, though sev
eral bullets pierced the plane's wings.

That I.W.W. Were Deported
(Special to The Review.)
DOUGLAS, Ariz., Sept. 3. Hearing
of evidence in the case of the 200
residents of Douglas and Bisbee,
Charged with kidnaping in connection
with the deportations in the Warren
district two years ago was resumed
in Justice W. C. Jack's court in the
'""J""1' widne ima aneruouu. au
the state's witnesses but one who
h'uk me stana mis aiternoon were
residents from points without the
county. The day was the dullest
since the hearings began,
The first witness called was M. Gor
man of Miami, whose testimony was
to the effect that he had seen Sheriff
Harry Wheeler with Deputy Sheriff
"Red" Gonnon of Bisbee, in an auto
mobile during the deportations. Gor
man stated that they' had a machine
gun. The defense excused the wit
ness without cross-examination.
Thomas N. English of Florence, one
of tne men deported, took the stana
and said that he saw Deputy Sheriff
Charles R. Cross of this city, In com
pany with several other men, all
armed, at Lowell, and later in the
ball park at Warren, while they were
standing . guard over some of the
others. He further stated that he
had seen Tom Hargls with a six-
shooter and giving instructions to the
guards at Lowell. He also mentioned
several armed men who were pres-
em at tne time wnose names are.
.1 . - , . , , '
iiieuuuuea m ine Dianspc warrent on
which the present cases are being I
heard.
On being cross-examined by coun
sel for the defense English stated
that certain lodgers in the house
where he was staying at the time of
the trouble were avowed I. W. W.
members, but that he had- never had
any connection with the organization
in any way. He said that he had
had no vote in the matter of whether
or not the men should strike, but
when he learned that they had decid
ed to walk out, he decided to quit
work during the trouble. English
stated that after he was taken to
Columbus, he was guarded for seven
days by soldiers and then released.
He said he stayed there for two
months after this. English was for
merly a guard at the state peniten
tiary at Florence.
The next witness was Dominick
Cassino of Globe, who testified on
cross-examination that he had seen
John Bello with a gun standing near
the line with several other armed
men at the Bisbee station. He said
that Gerald Sherman had put him
on the street car that took him" to
Warren. Norman McKenzie, he stat
ed, was one of the guards at the ball
park. Cassino said that he was not
a citizen nor had he ever applied tor
naturalization papers. Ralph Hart
of Hereford, was next called by the
county attorney. Hart testified that
he had seen the following men during
the day of the deportation: Dr. F.
C. Bledsoe, Percy Bowden, Ed Dumas,
Oscar Gilman, Tom Hargis, Jim
Kregbaum, Gerald Sherman, Harry
Jacobs, Sheriff Harry Wheeler and
Dr. C. H. Hunt. All were armed, he
said.
During his cross-examination, Hart
was asked to go into the audience
and point out Ed Dumas, who he had
stated, hnd been the man who had
put him in line before being put
aboard the train. In spite of the fact
that the attorney for the defense in
sisted that Dumas was seated in the
house, Hart was unable even after
several minutes of close search to
recognize him and stated that Dumas
must be wearing some kind of a dis
guise. Hart, questioned as to his
nativity, said that he was born in
Kennef, Nebraska, and was "Corn
fed and mighty proud of it." He stat
ed that at one time he had been a
member of the Western Federation of
Miners. Hart said that although ho
attended several I. W. W. meetings in
the Warren district prior to the depor
tations, lie had never been connected
with the "wobblies" in any way.
Dan Weitzenfleld of Globe, who
stated that he was the first man load-
ed into the cars bound for Columbus.
N. Mex., was next called. He stated
that he had seen Dr. F. C. Pledsoe,
Red Gaunon, T. R. Kelly, R. O.
Owens, Gerald Sherman, Sheriff
Wheeler, Homer Brakeman and Don
Steton, 11 carrying arms of some
kind, on the day of the deportation.
The witness was vague regarding
dates connected with his movements
prior to the I. W. W. trouble and
was very positive as to what he saw
July 17, 1917, the day of the depor
tation. The cross-examination of
Weitzenfleld will be resumed tomor
row at 1:30 o'clock.
Bitter Debate Marks Passage
Of Bill; La Follette Charges
It Is Measure For Benefit of
The Standard! Oil Company
WASHINGTON", Srtpt. 3. Without
a record vote, the senate tonight after
a twelve-hour session, passed the bill
to make possible the leasing of pub
lice lands having deposits of oil, coal,
gas, phosphate and sodium.
In passing the measure, the senate
approved amendments offered by Sen
ator Harris, Democrat, Georgia.
which would provide tnat under the
i "? 1 a vtnn onti.f rnet ot lATuniwinn
; may ton anti-trust act oil companies
may not charge different prices in
various parts of the, country.
Another amendment, which its au
thor, Senator Harris,' said would cause
the constituent companies of the
Standard Oil company soon to become
independent in ownership in fact as
well as in name, was adopted. This
amendment would prohibit stockhold
ers of corporations producing petro
leum and its by-products from acquir
Ing stock in another corporation simi
larly engaged if both corporations
have been created in conformance
with a court dissolution decree or
for the purpose of avoiding prosecu
tion under anti-trust acts. v
With the exception of the Harris
amendments, the fate of which are
uncertain in the house, the leasing
measure a3 to important features ws
passed as reported by the public
lands committee.
Consideration of the bill was mark
ed by bitter debate during which
Senator LaFollctte, Republican, Wis-;
consin, who in the last six days has
spoken more than twenty hours, and
other senators, charged that the bill
was for the benefit of the Standard
Oil company. During the debate to
day the Wisconsin senator charged
tnat tfae Standard Oil company ana its
associates were attempting to influ
ence the senate's action upon the
German treaty and the league of na
tions. Leasing of the land under the bill
is placed under the secretary of the
interior and in the case of coal lands
the bill provides that a royalty of
not less than five cents or more than
twenty cents a ton shall be paid
Alaskan coal lands are excluded from
theb 511 and a provision authorizing
the sale of lands as proposed in the
leasing bill of last session was elimi
nated. Royalties upon oil lands would
not be less than 12 per cent or more
than 25vper cent upon production,
while for phosphates, the royalty
would be two per cent of the gross
value of production and one-eighth of
production for sodium.
The bill prohibits aliens, by stock
ownership or otherwise, from owning
any interest in leases obtained under
the bill except where discretionary
power is given the president if in his
opinion he deems it necessary to take1
over and operate the leases or to ac
quire the products of the land involv
ed. Amendments by Senator LaFollette
were approved by the senate prohib
iting employment of boys under six
teen years of age and women andl
girls without respect to age in mines
on government-leased land; requiring
lessees to dispose of their products
at reasonable prices and prohibiting
persons holding leases from engaging
in combinations in restraint of trade.
The senate tonight by a viva voce
vote defeated an amendment by Sen
ator Phelan, Democrat, of California,
authorizing the president within his
discretion to establish an export em
bargo on oil. The senate also voted
down a sub-bill by Senator King,
Democrat, Utah, providing for the
turning over by the government of
the public domain to the various
states in which it is located.

Return to 'Paternalism and
Autocratic Control' Unneeded
Say Rivals of the 'Big Five,'
Opposing Their Regulation
WASHINGTON, Sept. 3. Heads of
the two largest packing concerns in
the United States outside of the "big
five," a scattering of 6tock raisers and
meat dealers and a representative of
the Chicago board of trade were
among opponents of the Kenyon and
Kendrick bills for the regulation of
the packing industry neard today by
the senate agriculture committee.
Senator Kenyon, Republican, Iowa,
cross-examined Wr D. Reynolds and J.
H. Nail, two Fort Worth.'Txas, ranch
ers, bringing out admission that they
had been paid expenses by the pack
ers after appearing before congres
sional committees on a previous oc
casion, but both men insisted that
they did not expect reimbursement
for this trip.
L. F. Gates, for the Chicago board
of trade, gave the committee a spe
cific argument in opposition to the
bills.
."This is a law of rules and execu
tive orders," he said, rererrlng to the
Kenyon bill, "rather than a law of
specific provisions. A change of ex
ecutives means a change in the re
quirements of the law upon the citi
zen. Men cannot tel rrom day to day
what is legal, under it.
"If the theory of licensing business
operation is good, why not extend it?
If the trouble is with the five large
packers, why not treat them directly,1
instead of extending a control to an
entire industry? Is not the Sherman
law strong enough to enforce compe
tition? If not, amend and strengthen
it. Is not the federal trade law strong
enough to enforce square dealing? If
not, then strengthen it.
"There are no conditions within my
knowledge which make it seem neces
sary for the return to paternalism and
autocratic control. Legislation in time
of peace should be a serious attempt
to solve definite problems by definite
means."

Uncertainty regarding local ar

That suggestion was aban
doned after receipt of additional
information by the president to
night. At Baltimore, where the train

president a sandwich, but he
smilingly declined. He also turn

first move must be to select a Jte, and committees arc mow at
work looking over' possible locations. r
Tha transformation of slag dump into a playground, .the IJiggins
property and the tract back of the Catholic church have all been,
suggested. It is within the realms of possibility that all. three will,
be turaeci Into recreation fields certinly they would- benon too
large for the number of children la Bisbee who heietofore have had
no place to play except in the streets.
Patents are not the only ones who have recognized the need for
playgrounds, as but few houses .iere boast yards cr a lawn. Look
ing nt it from a cold-blooded, business proposition it must be ad
mitted that the playgrounds will be a good investment, an asset that
will increase in' value to the community from year tc year.
As Dr. Ferguson pointed out,, human life is not cheap; automo
bile accidents are . expensive luxuries. And just as long as the chil
dren have no place to play, they will seek their recreation in the
streeLs, where they ara in constant danger of injury.
N. apparatus in the playgrounds .seems to be the prevailing
sentiment.; Only a place to play and enjoy their healthful games
in safey; this is what the children want and should have
COUNTY STORES MIGHT. BE A BURDEN
- ;
TfJE SUGGESTION MADE in Bisbee ihis week, according to
the Bisbee Review, that the beard of supervisors m'gbt au
thorize and furnish a public market in Lowell where meat,
vegetables and fruit could be sdd to the people as a means
of reducing "the. high cost -of living ln Lowell should ivt. be carried
any further, and tt is to be hoped rhat-theTnajoTtry of the board- will
taboo tfco proposition when it is presented, says the Douglas Inter
national. If the county is going into the market bu3ines3 ibcn of course
there would be calls for these markets in every com.: unity, where
someone might want the job of running it Supervisor Adams is
alrea-.lv on record as desiring ihat all workers on the roads of the
couufv rre entitled to receive ?5.00 rer day and this would be rm
wage scale for all those working on the roads of the county had no
Supeiviior Roberts beat Adams spitting at a crack to see wnether
the :oal work scale should be $5 or $4. SO.
A market manager, according to the idea of Adams, should be
worth at least $8 per day; then would come the question of what
the winners a. .ruck gardeners shou'd be paid for Ineir products
which would constitute the stock aal trade of the county stores.
As these farmers and truck gardeners and their wives, sons and
daughters are voters there might be danger of prices being de-
mandod which would make the cost of living higher instead of lower.
If a municipality desires to establish a. market, that would be
all ri'jht, but to say that the county should undertake to provide a
market, in every neighborhood1 in' the county would not be a wise
undertaking, in our opinion.

WHAT SENATE SHOULD DO
New York Herald.
What Ihe senate of the United
States can do, and should . do, is to
make it plain that the senate, as court

the American people withhold their
approval of the obvious wrong done to
China, even though an American
president has formally sanctioned
that wrong. Perhaps that Is what the
senate will do. ; ' ' '"' v
A FRAUD THAT FAILED
New York Tribune.
A determined effort has been made
by a section of the press which has
labored to make the covenant question
a partisan one to make it appear that
it was necessary to obey the Fresi

oppose the league idea. The fraud has
failed, as it deserved to fail. Non-support

HIS SCHEME DIDN'T WORK
New York Sun.
The French regret that the cove
nant was unnecessarily interwoven in
the peace treaty. Many Americans
may regret itl - But it was interwoven
in, the treaty' by President Wilson in
the hope and expetation that possible
inconvenience arising from amend
ment of the treaty itself would deter
the senate from exercising its author
ity and performing its duty in the
premises and that thus the way of the
covenant would be made easier ia the
United Slates. The president's scheme
did not work. The senate has not been

be thrown open to the public byjne
owners, Wright & Evans, today. The
building is modern in every way. lire
proof and of excellent construction, be

was in the neighborhood of $40,000.
John P. Steffes was the contractor.
The program today and tomorrow
will be the sensational film drama,
"The Heart of Humanity," with Do

There will also be a daily change at
the Eagle theater in Bisbee, which is
also owned by Wright & Evans.
The best pictures obtainable will be

could be emptied in a few seconds.
The lobby of the theater is particu

INICIPALMARKETRASANOTUER
BIG DAY; TO OE
MADE
PERMANENT
The Municipal market at Lowell
had another busy day yesterday, with
a large increase in the amount and
variety of produce on sale. The mar
ket was particularly crowded from
9 o'clock until 11. It opened at 8
o'clock and did not close until 6. A
number of farmers and gardeners
wtre in from the Sulphur Springs
valley and from Hereford.
Hereafter the market will be held
twice a week, on Wednesdays and
Saturdajs. The two days have prov
ed such a success that it is believed
a permanent market will be estab
lished with a roofed-over building and
screened italls.
The market is being operated un
der the auspices of the city council
and the American legion. Ira B.
Jorolemon and W. S. Eeeman of the
Legion's high cost of living commit
tee were in Tombstone yesterday
and had a talk with County Super
visors I. C. E. Adams and C. M. Rob
erts. They told the Legion represen
tatives they were willing to finance
the construction of permanent quar
ters for the market.
It is expected an effort will be
made to get the financial support of
the city council in the project also.
The supervisors said they would not
expect to take any hand in the man
agement of the market, but would
leave it up to the committees which
now have the matter in hand.

'Tanlac did so much for me that

been nursing in the hospitals for the

"Last February, while nursing for
the Red Cross society, I broke my

Rhamey, "and was sent to a hospital,
where I was in bed for five weeks.
While there waiting for the bones In
my leg to knit together again, I lost
my appetite and got to where I
could hardly get a thing and, natural

ferent kinds of tonic in the hope they
would build me up, but none of them
seemed to do me a bit of good. .
"One morning I happened to be
reading the paper and saw a state

calimed she had gotten such wonder
ful benefit by taking Tanlac that I
made up my mtnd to try the medi

thing for me.. So I bought a bottle
and by the time I had finished about
half of it I was feeling so much bet

at my watch : and saw it was 11
o'clock. I remarked to one of the 'at
tendants, 'Say, J'm hungry.' and It
was the first time in months that
had actually felt like eating. From
then on I started right in to pick up
and my appetite got better and I
slept better at. night and gained in

there yam an enormous turnover at
an extreme rise of 16 points, accom
panied by gains of 3 to 10 points in
other equipments and steels, also af
filiated shares.
Less extensive gains were made by
motors and oils, these in a few in
stances being altogetner effaced in
the later dealings, despite the increas
ed dividends declared on Mexican and
Pan-American petroleums.
American woolen, Barret company,
leathers, shippings anu tobaccos par

extreme gains of 2 to 8 points, a few
unclassified specialties deriving al
most equal benefits.
Rails rallied with a show of strength
on publication of official figures fore
shadowing best earnings, wage in
creases excluded, since last Septem
ber, but this improvement was for
feited excepting among minor issues,
where the inquiry was well sustained.
Sales, 1,500,000 shares. Bonds were

States bonds were unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO. Sept. 3. Drastic new
setbacks in the value of corn took
place today largely as a result of as
sertions which received widespread
notice that the crest, of the high cost
of living had been passed and that a
consideiable drop was In prospect. Af
ter an extreme break that compared
with yesterday's finish, reaching 8
cents a bushel in some cases. The
market closed nervous 2 to 5 cents
lower with Sept $1,341 to $1.31,
and December $1.67 to $1.674. Oats
finished to cents down and pro
visions unchanged to a loss of $1.02.
New low levels for the season were
reached by the December and May
deliveries of corn. The new records
showed that prices foi the two months
named had depreciated about 25 per
cent during the last few weeks. Lack
of support rather than aggressive sell
ing was responsible for the intensi
fied weakness today. It was pointed
out in this connection that a nearly
uninterrupted advance of seven
months had preceded the recent de
cline. Although sentiment at the close
was little more mixed than has been
the case of late, the buying power
appeared on the whole to be still lim
ited to shorts, who were in a posi
tion to take profits.
Oats were held relatively steady,
oving to a moderate demand from
cash houses. ; .
Provisions, like corn, were depress
ed by current statements from influ
ential ources that foodstuffs were to
decline. . -j

Wounded Men Urged
To Get Certificates
Mrs. G. J. McCabe of the Red Cross
offices In the Copper 'Queen library
building has received a copy of the
American Red Ctobs organ contain
ing the following advice to discharg
ed men, regarding disability certifi
cates: "Tell the discharged soldier and
sailor to get his surgeon's certificate
of disability whenever entitled to it,"
is an urgent instruction from the de
partment of civilian relief to home
service workers in chapters
Home service workers are coming
m contact with returned soldiers and
Bailors' who do not feel entitled to
ask compensation, as their disability,
contracted in or aggravated by ser
vice, is not now in a condition JJiat
prevents the men from returning to
employment. It is probable, however,
that these disabilities may become ac
tive after a year or two, and cause
breakdown, and each man should be
protected by a Burgeon's certificate
of disability, which will entitle Mm
to claim compensation at any time
within five years after discharge.
A' letter addressed to the bureau of
war risk insurance stating the facts,
accompanied by properly filled out
copies of forms 504 and 626, will se
cure this certificate of disability, if
the man's condition warrants it. irre
spective of any statement as to health
on the man's discharge papers. "

On Stronger Basis; Cananea
Wants to Join Prospective
League; Secty. Egan Resigns
Bisbee's baseball team is to be re
organized and another effort made to
stablish a league for the fall season,
Including Bisbee, Lowell, the soldier
teams at Douglas and Cananea. Sec
retary Tom Egan of the Bisbee club
has resigned and a successor probably
will be chosen some time this week.
Mr! Egan is compelled to be at Doug
las every afternoon and has been forc
ed to give his attention to other mat
ters. An effort will be made to reorganize
the Bisbee team, get some new play
ers, hold regular practice and give the
"fans" of the district a deserved, if
delayed, series of good ball games.
Roy Brashear, the playing manager of
the team, is anxious to build up a team
that can represent the city adequately
and has been promised plenty of sup
port in his efforts.
The Lowell team is going along in
good shape and will play the crack

Mr. Cromwell was golfing at the
time and had left 1 his trousers
where the boy burglars rifled
them.
The search has been going on
for nearly a week, and Saturday,
with the Assistance of young Raf

prised the young bandits in a reg
ular robbers'- cave which they
had fitted up around Gold Knob,
between Solomon Springs and .

was recovered exceut a purse and
$1.20 In money. A gold watch,
which Mr. Cromwell valned highly
was recovered unharmed and re
turned to him.
An aged negro woman employed
at the country club gave the first
clew to the robbers when a boy
rode up near the Country elub on
a burro. She noticed that he re-
whn find baan iMB nc!tr tha dnh
on the day of the 'theft.- She ac
cused him of complicity in the
crime, but he denied it and told
her he thought he knew who was
responsible.
The boy then gave a- list of
names that kept Constable- Bohm
falk busy for -Beveral days, but
which proved to be fictitious.
He then enlisted young Rafferty's
aid, with the result that the rob
bers' "mountain stronghold" was
discovered.
' The boys were called before

ficer, yesterday. Their cases will
come up before Judge Lockwood
of the superior court in a day or

MEETING -TODAY
The movement among the mer
chants of Bisbee and the Warren dis
trict to open their stores at 8:30 a.
m. and close them at 5:30 p. m., in
stead of opening at 8 and closing at
as at present, will be discussed at
a meeting to be held at 10:30 o'clock
this morning t the Warren District
Commercial club in the Copper Queen
hotel building.
It has been found that tie greater
portion of the Bhopplng is done be
tween 8:30 and 5:30 and that the
hours in the past have been a need
less expense in lights and heat and
a needless burden of an hour's ex
tra work on the employes. The Fair
store announced in advertisements
yesterday that it would change its
business hours according to the new
plan beginning next Monday. It is be
lieved that most of the other stores
in the district will follow suit. -
The movement is along the lines
adopted by the large stores is the
cities, where it has been found that
the shorter hours do not result in
any loss of business and actually in
crease th? efficiency of all depart
ments. The matter was put up to a
vote of the " employes in the Fair
store and they decided in favor of the
new program.
A large attendance of the business
men of the community is desired at
today's meeting at the Commercial
club. Hit.'-

Notice to the Public!
There htm been for the past week or more
some talk amongst the employees of our estab
lishment .regarding a new schedule for opening
and closing hours.
In order to meet our employees on an
equitable basis, we have left the decision entirely
to them. A ballot was taken and a majority
decided after carefuj, consideration, after an
investigation by count, to see when the public
could best be served.
It was . shown that more people . did their
shopping between the hours of 8:30 a. m. and
5:30 p. m., than any other time, during the day,
very few trading after that hour We have
therefore decided, beginning Monday, Septem
ber 9th, to open our store at 8:30 a. m. and
close at 5:30 p. m., Saturday excepted, when
we will keep open until 6 p. m.
We hope our friends and the public will
help us and our employees to make these hours
their shopping time and ask their kind indul
gence. Very Respectfully,
v.
