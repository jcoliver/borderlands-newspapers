Director General Is Grilled by
Kellog and Cummins onj
Question of Turning Over'
Railroads to Their Owners
Give Roacb Back Immediately
or Keep Them Five Years Is
Advice of Chief; Hopes for
Best in Roads Future
CBt Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON", Jan. 3. Director
General MaAdoo, testifying today be
fore the senate interstate commerce
committee at the opening of hearings
on the future policy toward railroads,
was subjected to a fire of questions
by Senator Cummins of Iowa and Sen
ator Kellogg of Minnesota, republi
cans, intended to develop why Mr. Mc
Adoo believes it advisable to turn
back the roads to private management
as soon as possible if congress does
not extend the period of federal con
trol for five years.
Both senators argued by implication
for retention by the government of
the railroads for the full 21 months
after the declaration of peace, author
ized by the existing law, and legis
lation meanwhile by congress to pro
vide a permanent solution of the rail
road problem.
m i.AHnn aw reasons whv i
. . . " i
he does not believe in retaining con
trol of the roads for 21 months:
That railroad companies already are
challenging the authority of the rail
road administration to require them to
purchase certain equipment, and oth
erwise are not giving a full measure
of co-operation.
That some state railroad commis
sions threaten to dispute the right of
inctnto nipc in nnrmal rwam times,
and.
That the uncertainty of the future .
would cause a ferment within railroad ;
organizations particularly destructive j
to the morale of employes and offio
ers.
To Senator Cummins' comment that
he thought it "little less than a crime
to turn back the roads at an early
date. with the standards of wages, ma
terial costs and rates as they are,"
and that "unless the roads are given
more time to prepare, it will be little
short of disastrous," Mr. McAdoo re
plied: "I cannot foresee such a situation
at all unless the state commissions,
and the interstate commerce commis
sion, ignoring the necessity for main
taining wages and the rights of just
compensation, would reduce the rates
unjustly. My idea on this railroad
problem is to stabilize conditions for
five years, to play safe, and try uni
fied management for that long."
Mr. McAdoo declared that his in
clination had "always been against
public ownership," and in favor of
some sort of private ownership with
strong unified control.
Mr. McAdoo said he thought the
power to initiate rates should be re-
a t--u ft tn tha nrociHitnl i flint clir.pt I
lir.es should be included in the nation
al system.
Senator Kellogg asked whether the
railroads, if turned back to private
management without giving congress
time to enact remedial legislation
would not face bankruptcy as a result
or tne-resumption ot tne operation or
state laws and regulations providing
low interest rates.
Mr. McAdoo replied that he did not
believe state agencies would force
down rates without considering fully
the new- financial obligations of the
roads.
"Don't you think that with the rail
roads under government management
for five years, they would be at the
mercy of the officials who run them
at the end of that time, and that the
people of the United States would not
have a real chance to decide what
tbey wanted done with the railroads?"
asked Senator Kellogg.
"Decidedly not." was Mr. McAdoo's
reply. He also added, that he believed
congress bad power to take control
of railroads for 1)9 years if it wished.
Senator Kellosg will resume his ex
amination of the director general to
morrow morning.

MILITARY JUSTICE
(Bv Review L.eas3 Wire)
NEW YORK. Jan. 3. Administra
tion of military justice in the Cnited
States army will be one of the sub
jects considered at the annual meet
ing of the American Bar association.
In making the announcement Pres.
George T. Page of Peoria, Ills., gave
out a statement tonight In which he
declared that the war has demonstrat
ed "that our military laws and our
system of administering military jus
tice are unworthy of the name of law
or justice." The I'nited States, he
said, still is following rules copied
from England in 1774 but which were
abandoned long ago by Great Britain
and which were better suited "to the
armies of feudal times than to the
citizen armies of a modern republic."
Punishments are not only grofsly
harsh, as compared with the penalties,
imposed for like offenses by our crim
inal courts, he said, but they also dif
fer so widely that we find the same
offense punished in one court martial
by 25 years in the penitentiary and
in another by six months punishment
in disciplinary barracks.
"A boy overstaying his leave, or
yielding to a natural inipuise 10 go
home for Christmas is charged not
with absence without leave but with
desertion. Disobedience of orders is
seen by a zealous offi.cer as mutiny.
In neither case is there present the
intention to desert or to mutiny
against the authority of the army, but
boys have been convicted of the
graver crimes and sentenced to as
much as 25 years imprisonment.
"The accused soldier has no real
legal protection. He may, it is true,
obtain a pardon, but this leaves his
record blotted by a serious crime,
of which he never ought to have been
accused.
"The negro soldiers convicted of
shooting up a Texas town were exe
cuted within a few hours after they
were convicted and before there was
an opportunity for a review of th.
record of the trial.
"A group of non-commissioned ol
ficers. after being ordered under ar
rest by a youn3 officer, were aceuse'd
of mutiny because they refused :ii
a body to do drill duty while under
arrest. Their position was in accord
ance with army regulations. Never
theless they were court-martialed for
mutiny and sentences ranging from 15
to 25 years were imposed
"These cases were extreme in
stances but they are typical of thou
sands in which the will of the com
manding officer has been submitted
for law and justice in the punishment
of military offenses, ihe maintenance
of military discipline does not require
this harsh and arbitrary procedure.
The French army is a model of disci
pline but an accused soldier has the
protection of the law thrown around
him at every stage of his trial.
"That a soldier in our army should
have less legal protection challenges
the attention of the lawyers of the
country. The American people ne.vei
will stand for Prussian methods, even
in disciplining the army."

are friends of those people and it is
our duty as their friends to see to it
that some kind of protection is thrown
a: o. ml them.
"There is only one thiug that holds
cations together, if j-ou exclude force,
and that is friendship and good will.
Therefore, our task at Paris is to or
ganize the friendship of the world to
see to it that all the moral forces that
nvike for right and Justice and liberty
are united and are given a vital or
ganization to which the peoples of the
world will readily and gladly respond.
"in other words, our task is no less
colossal than this: To set up a new
international psychology; to have a
new, real atmosphere. 1 am happy to
say that in my dealings with the dis
tinguished gentlemen who lead your
nation and those who lead France and
England. I feel that atmosphere gath
ering, that desire to do justice, that
desire to establish friendliness, that
desire to make peace rest upon right,
and with this common purpose no
obstacles need be formidable.
"AVe know that there cannot bo
ai.other balance of power. That has
been tried and found wanting, for the
best of all reasons, that it does not
stay balanced inside itself.
"Therefore, there must be some
thing substituted for the balance of
power, and 1 am happy to find every
where in the air of these great nations
tho conception that that thing must
be a thoroughly united league of na
tions. "What men once considered theo
retical and idealistic turns out to be

the opening of a new age in which a
new statesmanship will, I am confi
dent, lift mankind la new levels of
endeavor and achievement."

ROME CELEBRATES.
ROME. Jan. 3 (Havas.) From
early morning there was lively ani
mption throughout the city. There
was a parade of troops returning from i
the front which brought forth warm
demonstrations. Particularly enthu
siastic was the greeting given the
troops from the I'iave front.
The city was gorgeously decorated
with Italian, American and allied flags.
RECEIVES NEWSPAPERMEN. ,
ROME. Jan. 3. (By the Associated
Press) Representatives of the Italian
press were received by President
Wilson at the quirinal this afternoon.
The editors-in-chief of 30 leading
uewspapers of Italy were in the
party.
In his address of greeting, Andrea
Torre, president of the Italian Press
association, emphasized the necessity
for a league of nations, and for the
settlement of all national or racial
questions.
In response, President Wilson de
clared that he was "not foolish
enough to suppose that our decisions
will be easy to. arrive at," but the
principles upon which they are to be
arrived at ought to be indisputable.
"I have the conviction," he said,
"that if we do not rise to the expecta
tions of the world and satisfy the
souls of great peoples like the people
of Italy, we shall have the most un
enviable distinction in history- He
cause what is happening now is that
the soul of one people is crying to the
soul of another, and no people in the
world with whose sentiments I am ac
quainted wants a bargaining settle
ment. They all want settlements
based upon right."

have had to make provision for dis
tribution with motor trucks.
"One of the most difficult problems
involved in the whole matter is that
of finance. Our farmers and manu
facturers must be paid for their fooJ
supplies. These liberated regions
which have been engaged in war
against Germany, such as Belgium,
Serbia and Rumania, have .been given
from time to time loans by the United
States government with which to pur
chase lood and, as a military measure,
it is vitally necessary that these popu
lations should be continuously fed in
order to save the necessity of further
military action by the United States.
These loans are being continued in
some special instances and, in fact,
amount to selling our food on credit.
Look to United States.
"On the other hand, large areas
exist such as liberated Poland, where
our governments are unable under
present legislation to make any loans.
Furthermore, in some of these areas
the governments have so disintegrat
ed that it is difticult to set up any
financial circle for lack of govern
ment. These people are all looking
with hope to the United States for
salvation from starvation. It Is a
matter beyond private charity, yet. if
they are to be saved, it becomes
either a matter of practical charity
or long-time credits from the United
States.
".At the present moment we have
foodstuffs in the neighborhood of
certain peoples who rely on America,
but we are unable to deliver (his
food, except such as we can allow
from the Jo.000,000 placed at our dis
posal from present private funds and
such other food as the allies can ad
vance from their own stocks.
There is a broad economic prob
lem involved in European feeding
during the next six or seven months,
which includes some of the allied
governments as well as the liberated
territories. It is impossible to con
ceive, considering the destruction
they have undergone, that they tan
again return to the production of com
modities which they can exchange for
our food stuffs in time to prevent
starvation. Nor have they gold or
American securities left. They must
have credit.
"Most of these as are able, are
willing to give some form of obliga
tion of future payment and it' is
hardly up to us to stand by and say
if they will not produce gold or se
curities, that we are going to allow
them tc starve when we have a suffi
cient surplus of food to prevent the
loss of life. Our merchants simply
cannot furnish credit nor give away
food in theje volumes. It is a gov
ernment function.
Relief to Prevent Anarchy.
"It is also of the greatest possible
political importance, for if we are to
prevent anarchy and if we are to se
cure establishment of governments
with which we cau make peace, we
must somehow provide a food supply.
Therefore, our financial problem in
handling relief must be resolved into
three categories:
"First We enn no doubt sell to
Germany and to some of the allies
and neutrals, who are able to and
must pay in equitable and receivable
securities for the food they require
as a commercial transaction.
"Second The liberated areas and
some df the allied countries to which
the United States can temporarily ex
tend loans under its present legisla
tion. "Third Peoples who must have
assistance in a large way from the
American people in a manner which
cannot be provided for under any of
the present available funds.
"The allied governments have ex
pressed willingness to join in the
provision of foodstuffs and financial
help for these areas, but their situa
tion depends largely upon the finance
and supplies from the United State
To Use German Ships.
"It appears to the allies and oui

SOLDIERS PAID OFF

cl'.y Review I.eaavJ Whe)
WASHINGTON, Jar. 3. Despite se
rious difficulties due to lost records
and insufficient data, payments are
being made to troops as they arrive
from overseas and "no casual or other
enlisted man from overseas who has
a legitimate claim for pay need go
without funds," said a statement to
day by the finance division of quarter
master corps. It his been charged
in congress and elsewhere that sol
diers were being returned to this coun
try and discharged without having
been given their pay.
"Finar.ce officer are available,"
said the statement, "at every port of
debarkation, at every 'cantonment,
camp and headquarters, and at every
hospital, and instructions are explicit
that if a soldier has no papers he is
to be given a partial payment on his
own statement, and final payment on
his affidavit. In all cases so far as
the record shows all discharged men
are given their travel allowances
which, with reduction in railroad fares
secured by the war department, insure
a comfortable journey to their homes,
while in most cases discharged men
receive every penny which they claim
Is due them."
The division announced that to date
a total of J1.64.114.660 has been paid
to officers, soldiers, and soldiers' de
pendents since the declaration of
war.
The quartermaster corps has expe
rienced difficulty in paying the men
in France, the statement said, be
cause the troops in most cases were
rushed to training camps near the
front while their baggage containing
enlistment records, was not available.
To meet this condition, pay cards
were issued in July and pay books
in November, but it has been found
the statement said, that few of
the casuals, wounded or sick arriving
from overseas have either cards or
books.
Orders were issued overseas, the
statement said, that no wounded or
sick soldier should be permitted to go
aboard for transportation home unless
provided with all his papers so he
might be paid upon arrival home and
upon discharge. As the men were
anxious to get home and us military
policy dictated that they should be re
turned as soon as possible, the order
was revoked.

the liberated peoples is credit and the

to learn the practical value of this

and shrev.d financial leadership.

Resolutions containir.3 the proposed
amendments were adopted by the con
ference and copies are to be sent to
their respective .congressional delega
tions by those uttendircg today's con
ference, with the urgent request that
every effort be made to have them
incorporated in the amendment act.
One proposed amendment is de
signed to change the present law re
quiring each sta'e to contribute an
amount equal to that appropriated by
the government for road work, by
placing the state's participation upon
a population basis of 100 per square
mile. The amendment provides that
those states having a population dens
itv of 100 or more per square mile
shall participate on the dollar for dol
lar basis, while in states of less dens
ity of population the participation
shall bn one-fourth per cent less than
the dollar for dollar basis, for each
person less than 100 per square mile.
The change, as indorsed by the
western commissioners, is such that
there are only two or three states in
the union which would have o par
ticipate on the dollar for dollar basis,
with practically all of the western
states running on a basis of 2a to 20
per cent. . TJiis change, the commis

federal aid is most needed tn avail

Gov. Julius ( Gunter reviewed the

TU- Review l.!ij"rt Wire)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 3. Discussion
of President Wilson's peace terms was
continued in the senate today to the
exclusion of virtually all other mat
ters. Senator Lewis of Illinois, the demo
cratic whip, and Senator Thomas of
Colorado, democratic member of the
foreisn relations committee, defended
the president and his proposals, while
Senator Lod;e of Massachusetts, the
republican leader, urged haste in con
cluding peace, declaring that "the sit
uation is perilous to the highest de
gree," The Massachusetts senator denied
charges that he and other republican
leaders were attempting to embarrass
the president abroad by recommend
ing that consideration of a league of
nations and other proposals be de
ferred until alter the peace confer
ence. "I feel that our first duty is to act
in the living present to bring peace
to the world in the year 1919 before
we are to undertake to make a peace
ful world i:i the year 20u," declared
Senator Lodge.
President Wilson's position in not
appointing any members of the senate
as peace delegates was defended by
Senator Thomas, who said he had
every confidence in "the integrity or
his aims and the measure fcf his
ability at this crisis in our diplomatic
history."
Senator lewis. in concluding an
address he began yesterday, ex
pressed a similar view and said Sena
tor Lodge was following Colonel
Roosevelt in his opinion on a league
of nations. The Illinois senator de
clared that when the president returns
from Kurope and "goes to the people
with this as he does with every im
portant question," senators who have
been opposing him will be found yield
in? to his views.
The senate adjourned until Monday,
when Senator McCumber, republican,

support of a league of nations. He
will be the first republican senator
to openly declare his approval of such
a league

(P.v Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. Jau. 3. A British offi
cer, who was a prisoner in Turkey,
gave an account today of the terrible
iiardships and cruelty inflicted upon
British prisoners by the Turks. IXj
siribing the march from Kut-el-Amara
to Bagdad, the officer says the pris
oners were driven like sheep along
the desert ways. They were denied
food, were short of water and the
Tuiks refused to allow them to rest.
They were bayonetted or clubbed if
they stopped and were struck with
rawhide whips when they faltered.
Roughly speaking, according to the
officer, from 75 to S5 per cent of the
British rank and file in Turkey died.
One battery surrendered in Knt-el-Amara
117 strong: 11 now are alive.
Other batteries are almost Ja the
same condition. One regiment marched
out of Kut-el-Amara 300 strong, of
whom only 53 are living.
The British consular guard at Bag
dad before the war consisted of two
Indian officers and 35 men. When
the war broke out they were interned
in perfect physical condition. All are
now dead.

It is a peculiar fact, that nature
reckoned without human nature, when
she created her old world.
To the people of the rolling valleys.
she gave trees, grass, flowers and
water. Verdure of the rarest beauty
is bestowed on some parts of her great
universe.
In the mountains of the Mule, she
painted the golden-hued sunset. She
gave rugged scenery, rough, hard
hills of rocks, colored beyond the
imagination, and split and shattered
by fire and shock.
To the inhabitants of the plains,
she denied the beauties of the moun
tains, the scenery of barren, rock
strewn canyon, the purple blend of
glorious sunset
Residents of Mule mountains were
denied the green fields, the tall, grace
ful trees, the flowing streams and
canals.
Here it is that nature reckoned
without human nature.
In the Mule mountains of Arizona
men wish for the beauties of the roll
ing valleys. In little yards, rock
bordered and rock bottomed, they
place rich soil, and nurse precious
grass, schrubs and flowers. They
care little for the beauties of the
mountains and the colors of the sun
sets, compared with their precious lit
tle greenery.
Now, in the Warren district, nature
is to be forced to supply a greater
portion of that which originally she
denied. Already a large start has
been made in this direction, in the
Vista Park at Warren, where two
complete blocks of grass and trees
and parks have been laid 'out and
carefully nursed into green beauty.
Within a few months these two
blocks will be doubled. Grass and
trees and small green brush, parked
and platted, will extend from the
baseball park directly through the
town.
And it will all le dedicated to the
people of the Warren district.
In a central pool, at one end of the
house, are boats, and on its edge are
rustic seats, about which are woven
English ivy. The whole scene is one
of natural beauty, not overly kept,
but rustic and charming.
The great hall into which the inter
viewer was shown is of the 1760 pe
riod. The livery, cupboards and oak
tables are of lighter and more ele
gent design. The succeeding age of
walnut, represented in the Chailes II
chairs, and Queen Ann china cabinets,
are worth examining, as against the
dark wooded chests, wall clocks, great
high-back chairs and sideboards which
compose the principal furnishings of
the room.
Mrs. Kipling received the inter
viewer. As is generally known,
she is American by birth and raising,
marrying the young Anglo-Indian ge
nius when he first left the scenes of
his early triumph in India. She re
cently entertained at tea three Amer
ican soldiers who ment to Bateman'sj
hoping to see Mr. Kipling. He was
not ajt home, but arrived before they
left, and was very cordial to them.

The snowlalls of the last lew weens

Five months in a German prison
camp have made Cpl. R. Feeney, 4th
Canadian rifles, but native of Johns
town, Pa., U. S. A., see red every
time he thinks of a Hun. The Prus
sian is a born brute, he says, and
he'll never forgive the dupes of the
Hohenzollerns as long as he lives.
His experience at Rastatt, more than
confirmed a conviction, which ex
plains why he crossed over to Canada
and enlisted, long before the United
States entered the war.
Corporal Feeney sat up in bed in
one of the big, airy dormitories at
Eagle Hut, enjoying a fine cup of
coffee that a pretty waitress had
brought him, with a stack of cakes,
like those which pleased King Gorge
so much, when he visited Eagle Hut
recently. He drew a long, contented
sigh of relief and stretched a bit. As
he did so, his shirt sleeve dropped
back, revealing to the girl some ugly
looking scars. As she shrank from
the sight, the corporal said:
"That's what you get when those
brutes of Prussian officers are put
over the prisoners of war. If ever I
meet another Hun, I'll fix him prop
erly war or no war. Hundreds of
our boys died of starvation .and neg
lect and more would have gone the
same way if it .hadn't been for the
heme relief committee and the Amer
ican Y. M. C. A., which did wonder
ful work in providing food and cloth
ing. Any one who doesn't appreciate
t'.'e V. M. C. A. now. never will, and
it's safe to say that he has never

in the last fortnight, hut t!ie records
show that there remain in German
hands 35.000 cf whom 15.000. throught
the failure of the Germans to report
their capture, and the men's failure
to communicate with friends, had
been listed as dead.

Phoenix: Two oisnops assisted in
the dedication exercises of the new
Deaconess hospital iu Phoenix. They
were J. W. Atwood, bishop of the Epis
copal diocese ot Arizona, and Auna
VY. Leonard, bishop of the Methodist
Episcopal conference ot Arizona and
southern California. The hospital
originally was planned to cost about
$30,0u0. Now it is appreciated that
$150,000 will be needed to complete
the great reinforced concrete struc
ture of which the walls and floors
nave been poured.
Phoenix: Dr. O. H. Brown, state
health officer, has issued a warning
to Arizona concerning the influenza.
His statement says: "We must not be

places where there have been epi

place to guard against this."
Phoenix: Gaining entrance through
an open window, tnieves entered tne
Model meat market at No. 325 East
Washington street Sunday night and
escaped with a quantity of merchan
dise. The theft is believed to be the
work of amateurs. The robbery was
not discovered until late Monday aft

were a ham and several cnoice cuts of
steak.
Miami: The high cost of living just

Prochaska, particularly with regard to
the maintenance of two bear cubs,
eight months old, that have been
thrust back upon him by an unappre

cost of their sustenance had risen to
$42.50 a month. During the summer
the firemen killed about enough ray
bits to provide the bears witn food,
but the rabbit supply is short and re
sort must be had to the butcher and
baker.
Phoenix: Bond brokers report large
receipts of Liberty bonds from Ray,
Ajo and other mining camps where
Mexican labor is employed. It Is told
that the Mexican miners uniformly
join, even with enthusiasm, in every
bond campaign, but seem to attach
little value to the bond once it has
come into their possession. Instances
are known where the bonds have been
offered for little more than half their
value. In every camp are men who
take tip any such bargains and then
send the bonds here tor sale at the
market price.
Globe: W. Moody of Thatcher came

months he has shipped for himself,
and other smaller breeders, 124,000

Pine street. Louis Eik returned lrom
j work at the Arizona bakery yesterday
I afternoon about 2:20 o'clock and found
his partner .seated on the edge of his
bunk and a pool of blood on the floor.
Eik rushed over to Timpe and asked
him what happened. Timpe pointed
to a bloody razor on a box near the
bed and Eik immediately summoned
aid.
Phoenix: One of the first official
acts by Sheriff John Montgomery was
the public destruction this morning of
t quantity of contraband whisky,
seized by deputies during the regime
of W. II. Wilky. The new sheriff this
morning made a "clean sweep' 'of the
whisky store room at the county jail
building. Immediately after he had
given the retiring sheriff a receipt for
the amount of "booze" given into his
custody he secured an order from
Judge R. C. Stanford to dispose of it.

II BY REVIEW LtASED WIRE
I
.W YORK, Jan. 3. Under the
: jjuid.siice of oils and rails, the latter
a. .ur.ly of the low priced or specu
'lut.ve class, today's stock market rosa
to materially higher levels on a fairly
lare volume of trading.
Sharing very actively In the general
advance were numerous specialties,
including food stocks, tobaccos, sugars,
distilling issues and utilities, the lat-
ter including local tractions, which
scored material rallies from
recent
low records.
The omy strikiug exceptions to the
sweeping upward movement were
some of the motor group and their ac-
cestor.es, even the metal division
strengthening toward the end despite
the precarious state of that industry.
United States Steel and kindred
Issues, particularly Bethlehem and
Crucible Steel, forged ahead, regard -
less of trade reviews which stressed
present uncertain conditions and
prices.
Outstanding features of the session
were Mexican Petroleum, Tidewater
Oil, Texas company, Royal Dutch and
Pan-American Petroleum common and
preferred, at extreme gains ot 3 to 8
points; Beet Sugar, United Cigars,
Corn Products, Baldwin Locomotive
and New York Airbrake at gains of
2 to 5 points and half a score of In
vestment rails at more moderate im
provements. Sales, 850,000 shares.
In the main, bonds were firm, with
especial strength in foreign issues,
notably Anglo-French 5s and Paris 6s.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $12,
500,000. Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
COMMERCIAL BULLETIN REPORT.
BOSTON, Mass., Jan. 3. The Com
mercial Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"Interest has all centered in the
opening of the second series of wool
auctions mis weeK. At tne opening
sale it was evident' that the manu -
facturcrs arc unwilling to buy any -
thing except wool for special purposes
and tn the whole are waiting for the
government to reduce its limits to a
basis they think is safer. Thus fine
Australian and Cape wools of good
staple were in good demand, but
light suppiy, and brought prices in
some instances equal to government
issue prices and from that down to
10 per cent less for the Capes. Short
inferior fine wools and crossbreds
generally were draggy and the sale
war, on the whole, very unsatisfac
tory, withdrawals being some 60 per
cent of the total offered.
ine manuiacturing situation
also marking the time except for a
little sampling and the proportion of
idle machinery is reported fairly
heavy. The foreign markets show

quotations unchanged. Stocks of wool
owned by tne government are ngureo
at 310,0'.i0,000 pounds, of which some
80 per cent is in and around Boston.
"Scoured basis: Texas, fine, 12
months, 150 to 152; fine,, eight months,
125 to 12S; territory, fine, staple, 158
to 160; half-blood combing, 162 to
160; three-eighths-blood combing, 125
to 130."
BRADSTREET'S REPORT.
NEW YORK, Jan. 3. Bradstreet's
tomorrow will say:
"At the outset of the new year, fol
lowing 12 months of record accom
plishment, buying hesitates; skeptic
ism as to the holding power of prices
prevails, especially in the iron and
steel industry, and inventorying still
occupies attention, but with all, ad
vices as to potential demands for
goods in general, at a price, of course.
are rather liberally tinctured with
optimism. In the larger lines stocks
are light, shipments on old sales, to -
gelher with those going forward to

esc oui orosen naes are quite lai e,
Lut in a bro id se;i:-e, slack-water con -
ditioiis predominate. Incidentally.
the government continues to read-
just contractual obligations, while as -
suiin.a traders that unwanted sup -
plirs will not lie thrown on the mar -
ktts, and that foreign fields are likely
to be suUicienily needy to absorb
quantities of such commodities as the
government holds. Yet the mere ex-
istence of these goods rt'in'esses buy-
ing, begets uncertainty as to future
p:ice trends and fosters hope among
waiters for bargains.

BLIZZARD TIES OP
TRAINS FROM EAST
Presumably because of the blizzard
which broke in northern Texas and
Oklahoma and swept the northwest
ern tier of states Thursday, the night
train from the west on the El Paso &
Sonthwes'ern was canceled last
night.
It is probable that traffic will be
more or less in disorder for the next
few days, even with
though the railroad companies of the
west, by making up runs with local
stubs and by other methods, will at
tempt to fol'.ew out ordinary schedules
as closely as possible.
Wire service suffered concurrently
with the railroads, this being indicat
ed by the fact that local brokers yes
terday failed to receive anything from
the east and north, while their serv
ice from the coast was slender.
Eastern mail probably will arrive all
the way from a day or two to a week
late, owing to the period of prolonga
tion of the blizzard.
