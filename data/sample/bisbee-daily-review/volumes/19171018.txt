The Treasury Department Dis
closes an Organized At
tempt to Defeat the Object
and Purposes of the Liberty
Loan.
(By Review Leased Wirei.
WASHINGTON. Oct- 17. Pro-German
agents in the United Slates, ac
cording to reports to the treasury de- j
partment, have direcied their energies j
toward defeating the Liberty loan.
Their organized propaganda has borne i
fruit, from Minnesota to Texas, it is !
ssserttd in scattered localities wnere j
efforts have been made not openly J
but by indirect methods to discourage
subscriptions.
Agents at Work
The work of the pro-Cerman agents,
officials assert, has been carried on
for more thai two weeks. Some of
the workers have had the temerity,
renorts to the treasury indicate, to '
conduct their operations here in the
national capital. (
Official recognition of the propa
ganda against the loan was voiced to
oay by Col. Herbert M. Lord, repre
senting the war department at the
war risk conference, at which de;ails
cf the new soldiers' and sailors' insur- j
ance law are being explained to offi
cers and enlisted men from the vari
ous cantonments.
An Organized Effort

enthusiasm among the delegates from
the army and navy, marine corps and
coast guards attending the conference,
500 of whom swarmed up to the plat
form following the address and signed
vrar insurance applications, all of
which except 40 were for the maxi
mum of $10,000."
From Four Channel
Assembled from various sources the
efforts of workers against the loan ap
peared to have been directed along
f r ur channels:
Attempts to discourage prospective
buyers of Liberty bonds.
Efforts - to prevent certain banks
from handling the bonds.
The publication, in certain newspa
pers and other mediums of publicity,
of editorials and articles which, while
not directly opposing loan subscrip
tions, tend to discourage buyers.
The prevention, so far as local and
sporadic efforts can prevent, of the
placing of Liberty loan posters and
advertising literature where It will be '
most beneficial.
Personal Pleas
Attempts to discourage buyers by
the personal plea method have been
moLtly confined to the east. Instances
have been brought to the attention
of officials where buyers have been
approached, apparently in a spirit of
great friendship and advised not to
buy the bonds.
Center of Activity
Efforts to prevent banks from hand
ling the bonds have centered chiefly
in Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and
South Dakota. Montana, Missouri and
Oklahoma. The president of a Wis
consin bank has advised the treasury
that his depositors, mostly German or
of German parentage, have withdrawn
many thousands of dollars from his '
bank because he aided the first Lib-!
erty loan.

Trading Withthe Enemy Act
Is Blow to German Intrigue
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. What officials believe will be a crushing
blow to German intrigue in Mexico and other Latin American countries
has been dealt by the trading with the enemy act.
AH trading, directly or indirectly, with enemies or allies of enemies
is prohibited under heavy penalties by the new law and it became known
today that at the instance of the state department the war trade board
is giving special attention to the task of seeing Uiat no licenses are issued
for the exportation of money, machinery or supplies of any kind to per
sons who may allow them to fall into the hands of German firms or
agencies in Latin-America.
Investigations by the state department have revealed that German
firms and Individuals in the western republics have been using the earn
ings of their business to conduct a propaganda against the United States
and its allies, to cause strikes in mines and oil fields, the products from
which are virtually necessary to the allies, and even to attempt to in
fluence Uie political attitudes of some of the governments.

AMSTERDAM. Oct. 17.The Weer
Zeitung (Bremen) publishes an article
by Major Hoffe of the German general ,
staff on the effect the entrance of .re
entrance of the United States will
Lave on the war. After r"vlewiaf the
difficulties of the United States in
training and transporting troops to
Europe, he declares that the American
mnitary possibilities may safely be ig-
nored by Germany
Before the War
"Before the declaration of war," he
says, "hte military resources 01 ine
measures taken to increase the army
will rtsult in the forming by spring
of an army of about 1.400,000, which
only received minimum gaining.
Transport Difficulties
"No considerable part of this army
can reach Europe before summer,
while, in any case, a large number
must be retained at home; so that
not more than 400,000 or 500,000 men
ican be sent to Europe. The trans-
and a half million "ons of shipping
will be necessary to transport and
supply 16 divisions, and the total
American shipping, even allowing for
confiscated ships and new construc
tion, will by spring be fully 4,00.000.
nf which the navy requires 2,500,000.
"Any extcrsive transport of Ameri
can troops would cause rerious diffi
culties in supplies to England and
France. It must also be remembered
that the U-boats are sinking more an
more ships daily.
Rumanian Compared
"Figuratively, the fighting value of
the American troops is not great, be
ing about equal to that of the Ru
manians, and there certainly will be
fewer of them than of the Rumanians.
So Germany will have an easy task.
In fact, it is doubtful whether the
Americans will risk the venture of
sending an army to Europe at all.
Fears Air Help
"The only American help to be seri
ously reckoned with is in the air. The

new enemy directs his efforts less j of local authorities to re-confiscate
against the nerves of the German peo- lands given to the Yaquis by the gov

WASHINGTON, Oct. 17. Neutral
nations, and particularly those in Eu

greater privations and burdens made
necessary by the war under the de
cision of the recent allied conference
at London.
Details of the conference are be

allies are determined to support their
armies in the field by cutting off as

German army from neutral sources

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Oct. 17. Eastern
railroads are preparing to place before
the Interstate Commerce Commission
a program k provide general reliet
from their financial difficulties. Ex
ecutives of the roads so notified the
commission today when they appeared
in connection with proposed increased
rates on a long list of commodities not
included in the raise granted in the
fifteen per cent rate, last June.
Wha: i'jrm the railroads progiam
will Jake was not disclosed although it
was broadly intimated that the com
mission would be asked to authorize
a general rate advance.
Notification Made.
Notification of the roads' intention
was incidental t6 a conference among
the Commission, the roads, shippers,
state railroad commissioners and oth
er interested parties at which speci
fic recommendations were made.
Long List.
"Temporary relief, the commission
was told, was desired in the form of in
creased rates on a long list of com
modities cheif 'of which are live stock,
dressed meats, petroleum, grain and
grain products, sand, stone, cement
and copper."
The proposed increases would apply
to traffic east of the Mississippi and
north of the Ohio rivers.
Only Temporary Relief.
"It is the Opinion of the gentlemen
I represent" said eGo. Stuart Patter
son, spokesman for the roads, "that
any relief which will be secured from
permitting increases in rates on these
commodities will be only temporary
relief and that it is only a question of
a short time when the needs of the
eastern carriers will be brought tto the
attention of the commission in a much
more general and more specific way
than is contemplated in these particu
lar tariffs."

EL PASO, Texas, Oct. 17. Advices

the Yaqui river coui.try in that state is
grave. Some 1,500 Lndians are on the
warpath and ranchmen and settlers,

have fled to Hermosillo. The trouble,

"Such is the new blockade formula
which must be strictly applied and
which will make it Impossible for
Germany to continue the struggle,"
said one declaration of the conference.

nation's fuel product ion.
Warning Dispatched.
This warning was given today by
Fuel Administrator Garfield, in a sharp
telegram to miners and operators in
the fields involved, reminding them of
their pledge not to allow the output
of coal to be diminished and declar
ing that any atcempt to bring pressure
I'j bear upon him to force a revision of
coal prices would lesuli In postpone
ment of a decision on that question.
Mr. Garfield was in conference during
the day with John P. White, president
of the United Mine Workers of Ameri
can, who reported that so far as the
strikes in Ohio, Indiana, Illinois and
Pennsylvania were local in character; j
tl-'jugh they were threatening to
spread. He expressed the hope that
the men could be induced to return to
work.
No Details Of Plan.
The fuel administrator did not com

about the steps he proposes to take if
it is not heeded, further than to say
that while the ctountry Is at war no in

This action was voted tonight after an all-day meeting, at which
various speakers so vigorously criticized the food administration and
the government that a federal official said tonight he would call the
attention of his superiors to their utterances and intimated an investi

j JEROME, Ariz., Oct. 17. Inquiries
have been coming here recently from
'different mining districts In the state
' as to wages being paid, several dis
j tricts having the report that $6 the
j day is the scale in this camp.
; Such report is entirely eri'oneous.
j The Verde district, including all of the
producing and developing properties of
Jerome, is paying the Miami scale,
which on the basis of 26 cent copper
means $5.15 the day. The 26 cent price
scale was authorized here at the same
time i; was adopted by other copper
camps, upon, becoming effective of the
price agreement with the government
for 23 1-2 cent Copper.
Why the report should be circulated
that Jerome is paying $5 is no more
jiangiDie man uy me report simuiu oe
current here every now and then that
j Bisbee and Globe are paying $6. In
I quiry has brought out that there is no
district In the state paying $6, and
none of thera paying more than 26
cent metal provides for the payment
of under the pi'ofit sharing, sliding
scale plan.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Oct. 17. President
Wilson, in a letter to Mrs. Carrie
Chapman Catt, president of the Na

made public here tonight expressed
the hope that Vjters would not be In
fluenced by the actions of the so-called
pickets In Washington. The letter,
dated October 13, follows:
Expresses Interest.
"My Dear Mrs. Catt: May I not ex
press to you my very deep interest in
the campaign in New York for the
adoption of woman suffrage and may
t not say that I hope nj voter will be
Influenced in his decision with regard
to the great matter by anything the so
tailed pickets may have done here in
Washington. However justly they
may have laid themselves open to ser
ious criticism, their action represents,
I am sure, so small a fraction of the
woman suffrage that it would be most
unfair and argue a narrow view fj al
low their actions to prejudice the
ckiiso itself. I am very anxious to
see the great state of New York set
a great example in this matter. .

HAVE LIBERTY
LOAN BONFIRE
Arrangements Being Made to
Have Big Fire Lit on O'Neill
Peak on Night of October
23. Fires to Be Lit All Over
United States.
Mrs. Sam Kyle, local representative
of the Woman's Publicity League, yes
terday received word from Miss Alice
Birdcall, head of the Woman's public
ity sec;ion jf the Liberty Loan work,
asking her to see that the Warren Dis
trict had its fires of patriotism lit. The
Woman's Liberty Loan committee has
telegraphed :hat on the nisht of Oc
tober 23, at 7 o'clock, in Washington, a
great bonfire will be lighted by Mrs.
W. G. McAdoo, chairman of the com
mittee, who also happens to be the
daughter of the president and wife of
the secretary of the treasury. This
fire i& to be made up of something
more than ordinary wood. ' The contri
butions of fuel of historic or symbulic
nature are asked from every local'ty.
Help is to be extended, undoubtedly
with joy, by the boys and the igrls f
;he scout organizations, whose direc
tors have approved the plan with en
thusiasm. This Washington bonfire is to be re
peated at the same hour everywhere
throughout the nation and Miss Bird
sail hag been asked t'j see thai the
blaze for liberty be lighted in Arizo
na, especially to remind the people of
their duly in purchasing liberty bonds
during the campaign that will close
October 28. Governor Campbell will
light the fire in Phoenix.
Mrs. Kyle began preparations as
soon as she received the word and it
is n'jw planned to have the fire lit on
O'Neill peak and have the big flag fly
ing so that it can be seen by the glare
of the blaze. It is planned to have
the boy soou:s and the high school
boys get together and gather all the
combustible material in the vicinity of
the top of the ridge, including brush
and cactus to which will be added a
go'jd supply of coal oil, so that the fire
can be seen for many miles from here
as well as all ever the district A band
concert by the C. & A. band may be
given on the plaza in front of the post
office in view of the libeny fire.
Just what contribution Arizona can
make to the Washington fire has not
been determined, though it might be a
stick of wood from the cliff dwellings
of ancient communal houses or a bit
from a log that went into the building
of the historic governor's mansion at
Prescott.
Supervisors Buy
Liberty Bonds
What is believed :6 have been the
best investment of the board of super
visors of this county recently was the
purchase Monday by that body of $40.
000 worth of the sei'Jnd issue of Lib
erty bonds. The money used in the
purchase was taken from the sinking
fund of Douglas school district 27.
A provision of the law permits the
supervisors to make such a purchase
upon the appi'jval of the school board.
Because of the absolute security af
forded by the Liberty bonds, the fact
that the school bonds do not become
due until 1924 and that the $40,000
will draw interest at 4 per cent led
the board to accede to the request,
aside from patriotic motives.
It is believed Liberty bonds will be
at a premium before 1924. and a good
profit will be ade from tftem.
In addition to all of these reasons
the pa.riotism of the school LOard and
the county supervisors had consider
able to do with the purchase of the
bonds. . '

A COMMITTEE.
TO JURY SOON.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
GRAND RAPIDS, Mich'.. Oct. 17.
Contrary to expectation, the case of
Adolph Germen. executive secretary
of the national socialist party, and
ten other persons, on trial in United
States district court here on charges
of conspiracy against the draft law,
did not reach the jury today. Argu
ments for the defendants were con
cluded late this afternoon and the
government will make its final argu
ment tomorrow.
REPORTED BETTER
The condition of Mrs. W. A. Swartz,
who was taken to the Copper Qeuen
hospital on Tuesday suffering from a
nervous breakdown, Is very much im
proved and she will soon be able to re
turn to her home. She became over
excited in her efforts to secure sub
scriptions to the Liberty Bonds and
had to be taken to the hospital.
GAVE BOND
J. Bedore, who was arrested in Lo
well on Monday, and taken to Douglas
by Deputy Sheriff Charles Cross, gave
bond for bis appearance in that city on
Saturday at 10 o'clock. He Is accused
by A. A. Blankenship, proprietor of
the Star livery stable in that city. Of
having leased him a ranch which he
did not own and collected the rent
money.
TAKEN TO TUCSON
Jesus M. Duarte was taken to Tuc
son last evening by Deputy United
States Marshall James McDonald,
where he will be held to await the ac
tion of the United States grand jury
for failing to register. He was in the
district at the time of registration but
failed to uO so and could give no valid
reason so he will now have a chance
to explain it to the court officials.
CAUGHT WITH WHISKY
Ole Nelson and Robert Laney were
caught early yesterday morning in the
vicinity of the Country Club with a
machine loaded with fifteen cases of
whisky that they had brought in from
Rodeo.. The men have been under
suspicion for some time and the repre
sentatives of the sheriffs office were
waiting the men when they drove in.
They both gave bond for their appear
ance in Tombstone.
MILLINERY CLASS
The first meeting of the millinery
class, now being organized by the
Twentieth Century club, will be held
Friday af ernoon at 2:30 o'clock at the
Y. W. C. A. The first lesson will brt
plven on that occasion. Members of
the club desiring to join the work aro
requested to call Mrs. Cobb, phone

AN APPEAL TO YOUR f
BEST JUDGMENT AND i
TO YOURPATRIOTISM;
The Liberty Loan Is "Goodj
Business" and it Offers ai
Chance to "Do Your Bit" ati
Home.
The business man and merchant
must double the amount he invested
n the fl:st Liberty loan. Bir.bee's sec
end loan allotment, says J. N. Gaines,
county salesman, is sure to double
the first.
Continued business prosperity de
fends upon the money the government
reels it can spend the amount ol
money you lend at 4 per cent to have
to put bu' k into your business. For it
is a fact that every industry in the
United States today is touched in
some way by war conditions.
Failure o" the second Liberiy loan
will mean additional taxation, not only
for the merchant but for the wage
earner. One tax bill has already
passed, but the government would
rather seek popular Investment than
evy additional taxes.
It is well to note the fact that you
ire the big gainer, as well as your
country, by investment in this loan.
Your money invested in 4 per cent's
is exempt from all state and local
taxes. The income derived from the
bonds , are subject only to surtaxes
when the investor has subscribed ro
an amount over $3000.
The money you invest goes to make
your business safe from submarines,
from invaders and from the deadly
form of warfare waged by Germany.
The government turns back to you,
in one form or another, the money
invested in the Liberty loan.
Don't you realize It is sound busi
ness to invest in these loans?
Wouldn't you invest from a sense of
patriotism alone?
Well, it is more than patriotism.
It's good business judgment also.
Have you invested?

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

. FOOLISH AND HURTFUL JEALOUSY.
National guard contingents and regular army units,
scattered throughout this country and in France, are
jealous of the national army soldiers and woe to those
men who may be chosen from the national army can'
tonments for transfer to fill up the guard regiments.
It is a case of hurtful and foolish jealousy which must
be eliminated, if possible.
Arizona is justly proud of its Fighting First. The
men who comprise its personnel come from every part
of the commonwealth and ALL JOINED BECAUSE
THEY WANTED TO GET INTO THE UNIT AND SERV
ICE. Stress is laid upon the foregoing phrase for one
reason. When the members of the First Arizona talked
of the receptions and farewells tendered the Cochise
county quota, prior to its departure from Bisbee, they
put great emphasis upon the expression. In derision, they
remarked, "We didn't get called by the sheriff."
Arizona's offering is no different from any other
guard regiment in its feeling toward the drafted men oi
the national army. In reality there is little difference,
if any, between the national guard men and the national
army recruits. A short service in the army would cover
any which might exist. In one case the men volunteered.
In another case the men waited for the selective draft.
In one case, however, a feature is forgotten how many
men joined the national guard and the regular army in
order to escape the draft? Everyone knows several.
It is hard to perceive any difference between joining the
colors to escape the draft and joining when called by
the draft.
Members of the First Arizona resented the fact that
the drafted men were "wined" and "dined" before their
departure. It Is a jealousy of the most insidious char
acter and one which may mean trouble in the service
at a later date and untold hardships inflicted upon those
national army men who are sent to fill up the personnels
of the guard contingents.
There is no intention on the part of this paper to
apologize to the First Arizona for not treating the regi
ment in the same manner as the .drafted men. In the
first instance, any community is jealous of its own. The
national army draft was ALL its own. All of the men
lived in either Cochise county or in Bisbee. They are
known to any number of people. Furthermore, they
left in a body or in several bodies. The First Arizona's
men come from every part of the state. Some come
from Bisbee.
The Warren District has endeavored to be as pleas
ant as possible to the national guardsmen during their
stay at Naoo. Bisbee and the entire state of Arizona
is justly proud of its great offering to the service. The
essential difference in the partings, however, is the dif
ference between losing one of family and losing a
friend. Those men who left in the national draft, from
Bisbee, were leaving a large family. The First Arizona
constituted many friends.
There is one feature of the matter which should be
investigated by the war department. That is the possi
bility of friction between volunteers and drafted men
when they are placed in the same regiments. Take the
case of the Arizona regiment and the Arizona drafts
Should national army men from this state be sent from
Camp Funston to Camp Kearney, California, to fill up
the ranks of the state regiment it Is, nearly, certain
that the new men will get the worst of the deal. It may
not come from the officers, but it will come from the
men. That spark of jealousy, made of misunderstanding
in the first place, will work a hardship on the men. An
other feature which will not aid Is the fact that many '
of the drafted men are personally known to many of
the state regiment. This will hurt and help, but, in all
probability, hurt the most.
It would appear to The Review that the best method
of assigning men would be lo take different states' na
tional army quota for other states' juard contingents.
The personal equation will be more nearly normal and
local jealousies will be forgotten.
Arizona is proud of its national army men. The
state Is also proud of the 158th regiment. The men
are all Arizonans. They are all Americans. They are
all soldiers and are fighting for a common cause. It
is to be hoped that any petty animosities, engendered
locally, may be forgotten and the big object of the entire
work will be the one dominant thought.
A LETTER FROM THE FRONT.
When men in the United States strike, at the present
time, they are jeopardizing the chances of many men in
France and the cause they represent. It is to be hoped
those who are carrying on walk-outs in national indus
ries are doing so in a mistaken zeal. Any other con
clusion would point to but one summarization near
treason.
Many appeals have been made to the men at home
by the men abroad on this very subject. England has
had its full dose of labor trouble and army reverses.
America and its people must profit by the example. A
Bisbee miner, hailing originally from England, received
a letter from his former country, which had been sent
home by a man in the trenches. It is one of the most
wholesome and applicable "letters from the front" ever
received.

1st Batt. Beds. Regt, Somewhere in France.
Dear Fred:
JuBt a line In answer to your letter. I was sorry
to hear of the trouble you are having in England
with labour. But, believe me, Fred, you
are playing in the enemies' hands by striking. Noth
ing would suit Germany better than to see England
in a labour war. My sympathies are with you in
your endeavour to get more money, but if you can
get enough to pay your way, for Heaven's sake
DO YOUR BIT.
Remember, that by keeping the ball rolling you
are helping us out here one way or another. I am
working out here for a pittance which I should
have earned at home in half a week. I have drawn
29s. since I left England. I don't mind. I am doing
it for one end.
When we come home victorious then people can
agitate. But, Fred, from me, DO YOUR BIT. Stick
to your work. .... I know what it means to
stick continually at work night and day, but I think
they are lucky to get the work to do.
Remember, it is our little boys out here that are
giving them the privilege. If the Germans could only
get Calais there would be some trouble for England.
We have lost thousands of good men keeping them
back.
We know what it means If they beat us here.
But they won't. We know what we are fighting for.
It has been a terrific struggle. You in England
don't know. Our navy is doing its utmost to keep
the sea open, and we are doing our best to keep
England out of danger. 1
If you only realised what a close one it has
been ..you never will. You have got to be
here to see. This is funny talk, Fred, but I feel
deeply on this point. Those men who have not en
listed, it's up to them to keep the flag flying not
to squabble over a paltry shilling or two while men
are dying every day so that they should have the
privilege to work at home. Your brother,

Peculiar signs in Iowa when the "dry" cause wins or

Seme officers in thi3 county, apparently, do not re
alize that it constitutes a felony to shoot at a man
sought on a misdemeanor charge, who is escaping.

German Plots In
U. S. Before War
Coming to Light
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Oct. 17. William Wilms,
a dealer in timber and lumber tn tins
city for 20 years, testified today that
he had been used as a financial agent
for Baron Kurt von Reiswitz, alleged
leader of the Hindu revolutionists.
hen he was the German consul in
Chicago. Wilms was a witness in the
trial of Gustav Jacobsen and others
on charges of conspiring in this coun-
ry to fDment a revolution in India.
To Train "Army"
Joseph Reiderer, another of the gov
ernment s witnesses, told or naving
quit his job with a switchboard com
pany in April, 1915, at the request ot
Jacobsen to serve his native country,
Germany. He was to "serve his coun
try" by drilling soldiers for a revolu
tion to be started in Siam, he said.
It was his training in the Germany
army, in which he was a reserve ofS
cer, which induced Jacobsen to use
him for this work, the witness testi
fied. Long Trip Is Bait
Max Jarrasch, a sergeant in the
field artillery" at Houston, Tex., tetsi
fied he had been offered a trip to
Germany by Jacobsen as an induce
ment for him to join the forces of the
revolutionists. He also swore it was
planned for him to go to Detroit and
and from thence into Canada to blow
up munitions plants. He was stopped,
he said, by a telegram from Jacob-
sen.
Refused Money
Asked on cross-examination if he
had not forged a check and cashed
it, he said he had forged the name
cf Jacobsen to a $20 check and passed
it on Adolph George, a liquor dealer.
"I tried to pay Jacobsen several
times," Jarrasch said, "but he refused
to take the money. He said he would
have something on me and I would
have to behave myself."

for cooperation by the state railroad

defense and the general welfare.
Weaken Railroads.
"To the extent that you fail to co
operate, he continued, "even th'jugh
you may appear to be benefiting cer
tain citizens of your state you not only
weaken the railroads, impair their ser
vice and destroy their credit, but also
menace the national authority, con
flict with lis policy and weaken the ef
fective commercial and military powei
of the country."
Newlands Talks.
Senator Newlands, chairman of the
congressional committee investigating
transportation problems, told the con
vention that the. successful prosecution
of the war depends more upon trans
portation by rail, river and ocean than
upon any 'jther one thing and ye: rail
and river transportation is the only
thing to which the engineering aid of
the government has not been giving.
Rates Vs. Expenses.
Railroad rates, he said, are station

NEW YORK. Oct. 17. The market
opened this morning on par with Tues
day's close.' but a wave of fresh liqui
dation in the copper stocks, encour
aging more aggressive efforts of those
bearishly inclined towards the general

played. Reports of more progress in
Liberty bond flotation created a more
cheerful sentiment, which was reflect

Former Aphorism
of Michaelis is j
Quoted By Many
AMSTERDAM, Netherlands, Sept.
23. (Correspondence of The Associat
el Press.) An assertion by Dr. Georg
Micuaelis, the German imperial chan
cellor, that "God has sent this fearful
war as a judgment for our sins," is.
one of his former utterances that have j
been widely cited in Germany and Uie ,
Netherlands since Dr. Michaelis was
appointed to his present high pofl

The declaration was niaue by Dr.:
Michaelis as president of the German
Christian Students' union, and was
published last year In Die Furche, the '
organ of that union. It reads:

which depreciate the serious work ol

"In the realm of foreign policy there
are a multitude of know-alls. In so
far as they undermine confidence in
the government they are sinninr
against the fatherland. Everyone
knows from his own experiwnce that
success depends on contidence. Every
one may ponder over the fate of his
pc-ople. but to do this in public with
out an understanding of things is
criminal.
"These who earnestly desire to hr
Christians must see here the warning
finger of God. Thpy know that God

NOT COMPLETELY SETTLED j
Publication of a report that the Cap
anea Consolidated Copper Company
had adjusted all the troubles that ex-j
isted between it and the Mexican g'jv-
ernment and the state of Sonora and j
that date had been fixed for resump
tion of work by the company was in-'
correct according to one of the officers '
of the tympany talked to yesterday by '
a Review reporter. However, it can
be stated on the authority of this of
liiial that the outlook is very good for
linal adjustment of the difficulties
which have kept the big plant closed
at Cunanea for four months. The te-
eul; of a recent conference hold ly
company officials and Governor Cal-es
at Magdalena was a settlement of
the controversies between the com
pany and the state of Sonora. Some
matters remain yet to be adjusted be
tween the company and the national
government' but it can he said that
these are in fair way foi settlement
and as siAju as this is detinitely ac
complished then the matter of resump
tion of opera'.lon will be taken 113 and
the work begun as soon as possible.
