night.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
G'
LOBE, July 1 4. A detach-
ment of United States
cavalry was necessary to
cuell a riot which started in
Miami tonight when the po
lice force was unable to break
up an I. W. W. meeting.
Speakers at the meeting de
fied the nolice to interfere
with them, arguing that they:
had no authority to prevent
public meetings, as an ordi-j
nance prohibiting such gather- j
ings had failed to pass at a
meeting of the town council
this week.
One of the officers attempted to pull
speaker from his improvised plat
form on top of a Nix car but was im
mediately surrounded by a great crowd
of threatening strikers who drove
back the other officers and were in ap
parent control of the situation when
the call for troops was made.
"Wobblies" Driven Back.
Soldiers with fixed bayonets order
ed the miners out of the streets and
drove them toward the edge of town.
Just outside tbe town limits they as
sembled again in the baseball park
long enough to announce that another
meeting would be held tomorrow night
in a bie hall in Miami.
Joseph Oates, one of the speakers
who announced tomorrow night's
meeting after he had been cautioned
to refrain from speaking was arrested
when he came back into town. He was
refused bail and will be held until
court convenes Monday morning.
Will Stoo Meeting.
Following the riot many I. W. W.
leaders declared that a big meeting
will Ve held tomorrow night despite
the admonitions of the local authori
ties. They assert that they cannot be
arrested In view of the fact thet
Miami has no ordinance prohibiting
public meetings.
Over seventy-five business men and
citizpns joined the newly formed loy
alty league after the riot and all prom
ised to report for duty tomorrow
night in event the striking Industrial
Workers attempted to hold their meet

RESUMING ITS
End of Strike Comes When
Majority of Men Return to
Work Trains Bringing
Many Back Into District.
w
1TH the employment offices of
the various mines in the War
ren district working overtime,
the industrial situation in the
camp has taken on a more normal as
pect and Monday will see the largest
force engaged in mining copper since
the calling of the strike by the I. W.
W. on June 26. At the present time
there is no strike. The companies are
merely building up their organizations
again with care and precision.
Yesterday in the camp was unevent
ful in the extreme. News of the move
ment of the "Wobblies" was eagerly
watched for on every hand. When it
became known that the men denorted
from th -arren district had been tak-
en from Hernlana8 t0 Columbus and
pracUcany interned there was a
manlfest satisfaction in every locality,
Deputies Still Busy
Deputy sheriffs are still busy work
ing on many cases of agitation and se
dition which have been brought to
their attention. In several Instances
the reports were found tti be Incorrect
and the men suspected were examined
and released. In other cases it was
found that the defendants were I. W.
W.'s or sympathizers of the" movement
Such men were informed that their
presence in the camp was not needed.
Most of them left on the following
train.
Last night and yesterday afternoon
the outgoing trains were agasn
crowded. This was also so of the
trains coming into the district from
the outside. It would appear as
though the news has spread through
out the southwest that Bisbee is a
camp without "Wobbly" influences at
work and a good place in which to re
side. This probably accounts,, in the
opinion of many, for the arrival of
many men.
Temper of People
The temper of the people of the
Warren district is still firm in the de
termination to forever keep the "Wob
bly" element out of the camp. The

At the six outposts to the Warren j

Better Feeling
Though fftme cases have been re
ported to various officials of Injustice
done to certain men, the aggregate
good accomplished by the drive Is con
sidered to have outweighed any dis
tress made. In cases where mistakes '
were made efforts have already been j
made to rectify them. '
"It was pointed out yesterday" that j
there was nj occasion for mistakes be-!
ing made. While the men were being ,
held at the Warren ball park every
opportunity was offered for men to j
come to tbe gate and make exnlana- j
tion of their case. Some three or four ,
hundred men. In this manner, were !
able to establish their right to remain j
and were released. All others who
may have been picked up during the
drive had the same onportunitv. Nj
blame can be attached to the men in j
the drive. It was up to the men them- j

On the whole, the feline throiieh-1

posed It. Prospects of peace were dis

of Germany is required.

Government Camp Is Be

C"
OLUMBUS. N. M, July 14. To
night the United States army is
host to Arizona's deported min
ers, mill and smelter workers
who are encamped on "the plains of
death" half way between Columbus
and the Mexican border.
A small city of canvas has sprung
up on the site of the Mexican refu
gee camp established by General
Pershing and 1,140 men are sleeping
on beds tonight for the first time j
since Wednesday at Bisbee. These I
men were rounded up and deported
from Bisbee, Lowell and other settle
ments of tbe Warren District early
Thursday morning, were brought to
Columbus, Thursday night and their
guards forced to return with them to
Hermanas. N. M.. where they were left
after the locomotive pulling the spec
ial freight train had returned to El
Paso. They returned here early today
under escort of United States Cavalry.
Army. Rations Issued. v
All afternoon the men have been in
a blistering sun setting up tent's, dig
ging pits for field kitchens, hauling
fire wood and sinking latrines. It was
declared to be the hottest day of the
summer here and many men were
forced to quit and rest In the shade
of the khaki tents which were erected
under the direction of regular soldiers
from the Columbus camp.
The first government rations were
issued to the men for their support,
consisting of canned beef, canned to
matoes and bread. They will receive
a ration of coffee for their Sunday
breakfast the first they have had
since leaving Bisbee.
Under tbe direction of the army of
ficers and soldiers, an orderly, well po
liced camp was established out of the
chaos which followed the arrival of
tbe tired and travel-stained men
shortly after noon.
Cleary Is Relieved
Lieutenant Sbekerjian, provost-marshal,
was in charge of the work of es
tablishing the camp and organizing
the refugees into a regiment composed
of battalions and companies for feed
ing and caring for the needs of the
men. He has relieved Attorney Will
lam B. Cleary in charge of the men.
The Bisbee attorney, having had a
bath, a shave and a change of linen,
was not recognized when he appeared
at the camp today.
Army officers also are in the dark
as to what the next move will be and
say they have orders to feed and care
for the wants of the men and nothing
more. They are not being treated as
prisoners, but are being guarded by
soldiers with side arms and no one is
permitted to enter the camp without
a pass.
Attorney Cleary was given the free
dom of the camn and town tonight by
military authorities. He said tonight
the original count of 1.183 deported
men probably was Incorrect as it was
made on board the crowded freight
cars.
Problem Is Puzzle.
.The exact number In the ramp Is
1.140. None have escaped and all say
they intend to remain here until a set
tlement of tbe differences are reached.
ixcai ana military authorities are
making every effort to keep "boot-leggers"
from the camp to prevent the
sale of liquor to the men.
One I. W. W. leader in camp tonight
predicted that they would be encamp
ed two weeks but gave no reasoA
for Ms disblief.
That the adjustment or the differ
ences growing out of the deportation
of the men from Bisbee, Thursday
presents one of the most difficult in
ternal problems the government has

retirement lies in the ract that the

staunch supporter of the Pan-Germans,
who are the bitterest opponents
of pence without annexations or in

RUDOLPH ON THE JOB
It is almost a year now since L. B.
Rudolph, of Upper Lowell, of the War
ren District suffered a general break
down, with a bad case of rheumatism
as the predominating trouble. He
tried several times to renew his work
but was unable to stand it After
several weeks tf this, he went to Hot
Springs, took the baths, then went to
his old home In Kentucky to recuper
ate. Late in the fall he returned and
attempted three different times to
hold down his old job but had to
give It up. After he had lost in time
and money something like $500, some
thing good happened to RutfJlph. Let
him tell it: "Boys, you can say what
you please, VITOLOX will cure the
rheumatism and straighten a man up.
I told my wife the other day If I had
found out about the stuff sooner I
might have had $500 more In my
pocket. The first thing It done was
to put my appetite on edge and stop
my back from hurting. The third bot
tle just about put tne flntsn 10 my
rheumatism and I went back to my
old job and have been at the throttle
ever since.
"I'll tell you boys. If you want to
enjoy a feeling of vitality, vigor and
vim and feel full of push, purpose and
power, ytm can get plenty of It by
using a course of Vltolox."
Before loading them In cars for de
portation they were offered an oppcr- i
tunity to remain in camp, provided
they could obtain someone to vouch
for them, and upon condition that they '
cease their treasonable utterances aid 1
acts against the government and the 1
community. Under these conditions '
many remained. Probably 90 per i
cent of those departed were strangers, I
with no place of residence in the com
munity. This is shown conclusively
by the fact that nearly 400 I. W. W.'s
were arrested in the union hall, sleep
ing on the floor. Many deported were
Austrians and alien enemies. Tne
citizens acted as deputies, and as a
part of the sheriff's posse, under his :
orders and direction. Sufficient food j
and water was placed in the c&p tv
accommodate the needs of the men do-1
ported and the train sent to Lords
burg, New Mexico.
The community is now quiet and
peaceful. Over half of the normal
number of men are now actually work
ing in the mines, and the community
is no longer terrorized and Intimated.
The deportation was prompted by no !
other spirit than one of patriotism i
and loyalty to the govern menr. of he
United States. Mines all over this
state and country have been closed by
these same I. W. W. agitator, and at
a time when all loyal citizens should
be assisting the government rather
than crippling it and paralyzing its In
dustries. The citizens and loyal vom
ers bf Bisbee, as patriotic men. in an
hour when the government needs
loyalty, felt that the time had come
when they could bvt show that pa

ORGANIZATION IS THE ANSWER.
Bisbee's brave and determined stand against the I.
W. W. menace has inspired the west. Reports from
scores of cities and towns indicate that Protective and
Loyalty Leagues are being formed, with which to either
drive away or suppress this evil influence. Sheriff
Wheeler's fine example is also being followed by sheriffs
everywhere who are taking command of these
leagues. The people of the west who have had to deal
with this lawless and fanatical swarm of loafers know
that only an organized force can cope with them
When in the majority the I. W. W. agitators are
overbearing, arrogant and ugly. But when face to face
with the real thing in the form of outraged citizens they
cringe and slink and whine and call upon that very law
they spit upon, deride and despise in other times.
Bisbee is glad that her self-sacrifice and her devo
tion and her supreme effort are bearing fruit A per
fected organization of the kind now sweeping the mining
centres of the west will solve the L W. W. question
forever. To meet them at the edge of town is much
easier than rooting them out of a town. To prevent an
epidemic of a loathesome and contagious disease is
easier than to check one, once it is started.
Texas, Utah, Montana and Michigan have all organ
ized protection leagues since the Bisbee deportation.
Arizona is organizing by counties. Eternal vigilance
alone is the price of freedom from this plague of swarm
ing idlers, agitators, baranguers and spies.
O. P. McRAE.
At noon today will be held the funeral of a man
who gave up his life while on duty for his country and
his town. They are burying O. P. McRae with ail the
honors of a soldier today. He died for a principle. He
hurried to the trenches when the call came. A lawless,
irresponsible hand caused his death. All the honors this
town can bestowe are being given by Bisbee today to
tills brave man and good citizen who gave his all for the:
common cause.
His spirit has gone to join the spirits of the many
thousands of brave men of every land and time who
have sprung to arms when the call came to serve the
right as they knew the right What a muster roll of
names that can never die. Every town has its hero who
died for some great cause. The man himself passes on
to the imperial silen-.e if the tomb; even the voices of
those that mourn shall r-sse and their tears shall be
dried by time; but the work the man did lives on and on,
and brings happiness and security and rich blessings to
those for whom he died.
The master of the mine where O. P. McRae worked
bowed his head yesterday when asked about the dead
man. Unconsciously he paid the highest tribute. "Mc
Rae worked at the mine ever since he was a boy," he
said. "He wa3 an old-timer with us, although yet young.
He was of the highest and best type of a miner and s
All the boys both loved and respected him."
This man who will be buried today from the town
plaza where the flag waves above the throng and the
mountains looks down in majesty, lived well and died
well. A city mourns his death and sings his praise. He
cannot hear the words or see the tears for his eyes are
closed in the last long sleep. But his spirit knows, and
smiles in pride, for his cause is marching on.
man.
Haywood, one or the I. W. W. limbs of the German
conspiracy, denies connection therewith. Of course he
would. No one expected him to gloat over it in public.
Federal agents would throw him in prison before the
words of admisbion were out of his mouth. But actions
speak louder than words. Haywood speaks with an
American tongue and his words smack of loyalty, but
his organization holds out a German hand for German
money and its tools strike at Amert-an Industries for the
further advancement of the German cause. Yes, the l
W. W. is loyal, and so was Von Papin, but his master is
in Berlin, not Washington.
THE SUNDAY MORNING SERMON.
"Woe to him that is alone when he falleth, and hath
not another to lift him up." Ecclesiastes 4-10.
This is a most apt thought for the Sabbath day when
men have put aside their mirth and their employments
and seek only to rest and recuperate and to worship,
each in his own way. It is at this time that we have
most need of each other. We turn more closely to our
families for comfort and to our friends for faith and in
spiration. We are so dependent upon our fellows for
every shred of happiness we can get in this world below
Solomon' says in the same chapter noted above, that
"two are better than one; if they fall one will lift up his
brother." And this does not necessarily mean a fall in
the flesh; a disaster; a calamity. It refers also to the
spirit and to the little things and big that bow us down
in depression and despair. It is then that a friend is
needed. A friend who will stop Instead of passing by. A
friend who has a brave heart and a word of comfort and
of praise.
You know, readers, how often, oh, how often, the
faith and fellowship of a friend has helped you. You
know how much good it does you, just to tell some one
you like or love about your troubles. You know how
much more you enjoy pleasure when friend or kin are
there to enjoy it with you.
This city in the pleasant valley resting so calmly this
day, under the protection of the mountains and of God, it
is an ideal place to live. Nature has given us a rich
storehouse and a mild climate; we have builded our homes
and our business houses upon a rock. But after all, we
are dependent absolutely upon each other for every com
fort and every blessing we enjoy. One man shall haul
water and another shall hew wood and a third shall dis
in a mine. One shall paint and one shall sing and one
shall pray and one shall mourn. We grope in the dark
ness of our sorrow or the. light of our joy for a nand
and it is always there. Woe to us when it is not so.
All the glitter and success of the world cannot compen
sate ua for that one hand we need, that one voice we
love.
Solomon, wisest of preachers, proclaimed woe to him
that is alone when he falleth. If his selfishness, his ar
rogance, his misdeeds, his heedlessness, his churlishnes
hath driven good friends and loving hearts from him
he is alone in spirit and no gold ever minted can hire
a slave to take their place.
A kind heart draweth a kind heart near. A sweet
voice beguileth song from other throats. Love begets
love. Gentleness and mercy becometh all of us better
than a crown. Our strength is not in ourselves but ir
others that we may be able to attract to us by our
humility and worth.
Oh, that a friend may always be near when we fall.
Our feet are wounded and weary, for the way is long.
But there are lights along the way. Faith calls us to
come. Let us arise aim go forward with a smile, sure
that we will win in spite of our weakness.
President Wilson appealed to congress for the food
control bill by July 1 at the latest But this bill, loaded
down with amendments, groggy from debate, is but little
further on its way than it was when the president, with
the cation behind him, made his call.
"Bill" Cleary has changed his tune in the last few
days. His mild, meek, martyred, sanctimonious state
ment issued Friday from Hermanas sounds vastly differ
ent from his threats, his defiance and his anarchistic
ravings here in Bisbee a few days before the big drive.
Armed power and a long ride in a box car took a lot of
virulence from the poisoned crew that held forth in
this city in open defiance of everything and everybody
during the strike. But this hypocritical meekness is
only a thin veil used under Cleary's instructions to cover
the inherent ueliness and wickedness within. No one
who knows the I. W. W. methods and habits and princi
ples will be fooled for a minute. Cowed and overawed
by determined force, the only thing that affects them,
th are mppk fnr a moment. They SDeaK softly in
Hermanas but they left Eisbee sullen and defiant with
curses and threats on their lips. It merely serves their
purpose now to be martyrs. They are frightened at the
storm they have aroused all through the west. But their
natural role is that of terrorists. ,

THEY LIKE "ANNIE LAURIE"
BEST, SAYS SOUSA
John Philip Sousa says that his nav
al band of 200 members at the Great
Lakes training station is to remain a
permanent organization. Recently no
was asked as to the kind of song the
American soldiers will make their
Tipperary .and Mr. Sousa replied :
"The song the soldiers are going to
like is the song . that does noc con
stantly remind them of their being sol
diers. No good k'oldier likes' to be
talked to about his patriotism. I
should as soon care to be asked if I
know anything about music. The fact
that a soldier wears the uniform is the
symbol that he is the guardian of pa
triotism. It is his job. As long as
he is in the service it is his life, and
when he sings he is not going to sing
about himself but something differ
ent "I found that out during my 12 years
as director of the Marine band in
Washington. On general review cuy
the men were in motion almost con
stantly from early in the mornina
till late in the afternoon. By the end
of the time they were generally hun
gry and they were always tired. The
music that brought them back home
with their heads up and their feet
swinging was not a series of patriotic
hymns, but Annie Laurie and The Old
Folks at Home."

NEW ZEALANOERS WERE
SUPER MEN AT MESSINES
Stories of the super heroism of Ney
Zealanders at the battle of Messines,
as related by Malcolm Ross, special
correspondent with the New Zealand
forces, are recounted in a dispatch
from London.
Ross tells how wounded officers and
men fought on until forcibly sent
back; how a private, single handed,
charged through the mtisn Dtrrasw
to silence a strong enemy machine
gun emplacement actually accom
plishing this remarkable feat; how a
chaplain, under the heaviest fire, con
tinuously tended wounded men from
early morning until late at night; and
how, after all a company's officers had
fallen one by one, the non-Commissioned
officers and masterful privates
continues to carry on with initiative
and gallantry.
It was thought, the dispatch says,
that the high water mark of gallantry
for this division was reached on the
Somme, but Messines exceeded all
previous standards.
A few ex-citizens of Bisbee and several hundred va

them have been training in the devil's workshop of idle
ness and dissension for years. These professional teach
ers found a few followers. And the trail led to Her
manas and thence to this stockade. No one forced them
to leave this city or to go to this stockade. They elected
to go. Their thoughts and habits and inclinations all
led them that way. Some of them sought bad company
most of them are bad company, lt'ls a man's mind alone

COL. McCLINTOCK SUMS
THEM UP AS COYOTES
That industrial conditions m -.r
zona are nothing short of a state of ac
tual rebellion against the nation, is
the frankly expressed opinion of Col;
James McCllntock, after a profeEf
sional tour bf nearly two weeks
through the copper camps of souta
eastern Arizona.
Apparently, hundreds of profession
al agitators have been sent into the
state to preach the doctrine of unrest
and to tie up mineral and agricul
tural production at a time when ev
ery pound tf copper and of grain is
necessary to the maintenance of the
war for defense of republican institu
tions. "The activity of the agitators." ob
served the t'olonel, " reminds me or
the effect on the hearer of the mm
night howl of a desert coyote, which
makes enough noise for a dozen.
There cau't be more than a few hun
dred of the real I. W. W. ort yat :

ment thousands of SJivcniuns, the Ser
bians a?one excepted, and 'hoy have
terrorized thousand o kok! work
men into leaving well p:iid joba at
which they wanted to rcniarn.
"They are opposed to the principles
of trades unionism, yet they have col
lected initiation and dues from
thousands of union men, wl.t quit
work because they didn't want to be
called 'scabs.' The leaders have no
hesitation in stating that their organi
zation will be satisfied with nothing

THE MAN WHO WINS.
The man who wins ia an average man;
Not built on any particular plan.
Not blest with any particular luck;
Just steady and earnest and full of
pluck.
When asked a question he does net
"guess"
He knows and answers "no" or "yes";
When set a task that the rest can't do.
He buckles down till he's put it
through.
So he works and waits; till one fine
day
There's a better Job with bigger pay.
And the men who shirked whenever
they could
Are bossed by the man whose work
made good.
For the man who wins is the man who
works.
Who neither labor nor trouble shirks.
Who uses his hands, his head, his
eyes;
The man who wins is the man who
tries.

This body has been dumb before the imperial will ever

The kaiser had better listen for it is the voice of his

it strikes.
Arizona's showing so far in the matter of enlistments
Is nothing to boast about. She has only 727 men in the

HAWAII FURNISHES
MORE THAN QUOTA TO
UNITED STATES ARMY
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, July 14. Explana
tions today of the quota allotment for
th selective draft, as announced yes
terday, shows that the territory of
Hawaii stands In a class by itself,
among the states and territories, hav-j
ing already furnished nearly 2.000
men in volunteers in excess of the
number required from the islands toi
mi up me first army.
Every other state or territory has
been benefitted accordingly by a re
duction in its net quota.
This accounts for the "adjustment"
factor included in the tables fixing
quotas given out yesterday.
On the basis of population Hawaii's
( gross quota was 2.403. Since April,
4 1 additional volunteers have been re-'
cruited, making the total contribution
to the army of the United States toi
June 30, 4,307. or 1,994 more than it I
was required to furnish. j
It was this situation which con
fronted officials when the allotment of
quotas came to be figured out. To
each Etate and territory in proportion1
to Its nonnlnHnn fl nnrr nf Han-nit's I
surplus was awarded.
Another development today In con
nection with the allotment of credits
that the war department has fur
nished to each governor was a full
list of war recruits enlisted in the reg
ular army since April 1 and who claim
that state as home.
Credits for enlistments in the reg
ular army were given on the basis of
the place claimed as home by the re
cruit, no matter where he enlisted.
No additional information as to the
date or exact method of the drafting
was obtainable today. The method j
probably will be announced on thej
eve of the drawing and that will follow
immediately upon receipt of official
advices that the last local board has
completed its organization work and
filed its lists of numbered registrants
with the states and territories. There,
are nearly 1,000 district boards to be
v heard from, but indications are that
aH will have reported by the middle
of -.next week.

bona fide labor demands or methods,
but we respectfully urged upon your
attention the wide-spreading and viru
lent character of the I. W. V. propa
ganda and activities. They are pi'ob

by German influence, but whether that
is true or not they are as mucn in tnc
Interest of Germany in this war as it
directly inspired and handled from
Berlin headquarters.
The deportation of undesirtb'e Ger
mans from this district on July 12
was not the work of a mob, but was
conducted by the sherifT of this coun
ty and some 1200 law-abiding citi7eus
and deputy sheriffs, am'ong whom were
at least 1000 men who have continued
to work in the mines of this district
notwithstanding the strike and the out
rages and unlawful treatment to Inch
they were subjected by the L W. W.
The whole proceeding was quiet,, or
derly and determined, and the only
bloodshed which occurred was brought
about through the action of an I. W.
W. member who killed a deputy sner
iff, firing through a door without
warning, and was himself killed by the
posse. '
The whole proceeding wa unavoid
able, unless the citizens of this district
were willing to compromise with o en
treason and seditton. Tae warren
mining district is now peaceful and
quiet. The men have returned to
work and the production of copper
has been resumed. The law-abiding
citizens of this district send this teie
gram because they are unwilling to
rest 6ilent under the Imputations r-eing
cast upon them by the I. W. W. mem

It was getting
on towards three
o'clock. The town was very quiet,
not a noise coming up from the streets
through the open windows. The click
of the Associated Press instruments
sounded loud from the next room and
one could hear the low hum of the;
linotypes down stairs. The telegraph
editor yawned. The foreman wanted
to know if the force were to be furn-
ished with guns. He seemed to be dis-
appointed when answered in the neg-
ative.
After a while the street sweepers
came on duty. They made plenty of
noise with their carts and shovels and
brooms. Surely there was nothing in
the stolid movements of these men
and their lumbering machines to pres-
age the stirring events that were soon
to come.
Occasionally an automobile sped by

became oppressed with the fear that
the affair had been abandoned.
At four o'clock came the first word
that stirring events were on foot and
it came over the telephone in a moth -
pr's tones, anxious for her boy to
come down and deliver his papers that
morning. Her husband had been mys -
f-rinnslv summoned away. A neighbor
had called to say that many men were
gathered behind the church. Upon be -
nk assured that no news boy owuld be
allowed to leave the office except in

In a little while another mother call

It was broad daylight now and the
night watchman, grizzled and gray,
knocked on the office door. He wanted
his paper. "Will there be anything
hot in the paper this morning? he
asked. "It will not be cold," was the
reply; "in fact it will not be luke
warm. ;
A man passed with a white handker
chief tied around his arm. He was a
deputy sheriff. The men of Paris on
the St. Bartholomew massacre wore
white handkerchiefs on their arms.
' The morning was like a beautiful
dream come true. The light stole
down from the skies and adorend the
homely mountain peaks with glory.
Down in the valley it was dim and
sweet and cool like the light through
stained windows. The mountains look
ed so strong in the dawning. They
seemed to be the staunch protector
of the town below them.
People began to appear on the
streets. From wltnin came me noise

The pressman threw the knife switch.

to see that all was right.
Pretty soon the wobblies began to

duty in front of th2 postomce. tney
slouched along to their places, talking
a little. There were more of them
than usual. They did not suspect a
thing. The hour had been sei ior six-
thirty. It was now six-twenty-nve. A
cook from the restaurant across the
street came out to the doorway in his
an and anron. and, raising his hands
above his head, enjoyed a big stretch
nd breath of morning air all in one.
It seemed to the overwraugm aum-
ence of one that surely his stretching
muscles would crack like a pistol shot
when his hands met behind his head.
The foreman came to the printing
office door wiping his hands on an ink
stained towel. He looked out anxtous-
y at the awakening street. What
time is it?" he asked. Witn r.is lasi

rush of man feet. And men ironi

like wolves in a trap. The leaders

to danger, intimate familiars of vio
lence.. Along the track up the mountain a
few feet away, their rifles extending
over the Iron railing that protected
the way, were fifty picked men in a
row that bad appeared as if by magic.
And then was seen a sight that no
town has witnessed outside the war
zone in Flanders where they tight
house to house for the possession of
the place. From every side street and

The captives in the plaza were in-
creased to five hundred men Inside of
five minutes. They began to mill
around. The leaders were harrangue-
ing them. The moment was critical.
Several deputies raised their rifles
threateningly and it surely looked as
though blood would run on the
streets. Hut what was this! The steady
tramp of men resounded on the
streets leading up the canyon. They
, were coming down, the reserves two
hundred strong with their rifles on
' their shoulders. The front of the line
came up to the plaza and some one
(called halt. The crash of musket butts
j on the pavement stilled the mutter-

face and a desperate man. But not a
shot was fired.
And then the march for the loading
pens was begun. Another critical mo
ment. But the reds' of the I. W. W.
the picked terrorists, had seen enough.
The expression upon the faces of
these men who had been called from
home and business before dawn to
clean their town of its enemies froze
them, and the numbers of the depu
ties overawed them.
At the sharp call of "fallin there;
MARCH!" the "wobblies" shuffled
around awkwardly enough, but eagerly
and they marched. What a study in
faces as the procession ambled by. Old
offenders with sullen brows and
smouldering eyes. Foreigners with
sullen brows and smouldering eyes.
Foreigners with heavy, stolid looks
and bearded, unwashed faces. Young
men who looked half frightened and
half ashamed . Sorrowful, slmole,
soulless faces passed by like a bad
dream.
Some of the men laughed from pure
bravado, but most of them looked very
serious. Many glanced furtively, from
time to time over their shoulder as
though they expected to see the ghosts
of old sins. Dejected looking men
marched here. Here came a man
with a bloody face and his jaw awry;
he had offered resistence. Here was a
man without a shirt; they had hauled
him out of bed. That man with his
hand to his head had not raised his
hand quickly enough a half hour be
fore and now be walked with his hand
raised to caress tenderly a big bump
raised by the but of a Colt's army pat
tern. A big man swaggered by. Behind
him marched a Dutchman smoking a
big pipe. Then came a Mexican with
a face as expressionless as a mesquite
chunk. Next was a man who looked
as though he might have been plucked
from the pirate chorus of a stage
comedy. His black whiskers reeked of
stratagems, treasons and spoils: Italy
gave him to the world and Vienna
nurtured him and Halstead street,
Chicago, educated him in every spec
ies of crime and sent him here to
serve Haywood's crew.
Every type that the old world had
to offer to the new was here. Slav
and Pole and Serb and Welch and
Maygar and Italian and Finn and Celt
and Saxon, all walked in this 111
kempt line. Chicago, Denver, Butte,
Frisco and the City of the Angels
furnished most of the rest with a
generous aid from Villa's pet province
of Sonora.
The parade wound around the de
pot and passed up the tracks and out
of sight and ken of the newspaper
man, who turned and went back to his
office, walking as one who struggled
still to awake from a strange dream
of the night.

I. W. W. Agitators Are
Slowly Losing Ground
Bisbee Produces Two-Thirds
Than Two-Thirds of Regular Working Force Ray, Ajo,
Superior and Douglas Gave Labor Outlaws Cold Wei
come Men Who Threatened Company From Picket
Lines Will Not Be Reinstated Whenever They Want to
Return to Work.
Bisbee mines are producing near two-thirds of normal ore output, with
less than two-thirds of their former force underground. Applications made at
the different shafts during the week,
raised the working shifts well over the
for work were by no manner of means
companies are reserving the privilege
the men as made themselves offensive
and in other ways. The forces ultimately operating the mines of the district
will lack the presence of probably several hundred who were found wanting
when moral courage and loyalty to country became the issue of the hour.
At Jerome the mines were bothered but two days in consequence or
the last strike call. They now have all of their former workers back except
those who were engaged In the I. W. W. walkout. Most of these were among
tie men rounded up and sent out of town. At Morenci and Clifton there
has been no change, while the mines and reduction plants continue idle at
Globe and Miami. Intimidation alone prevents resumption in these four
districts. At Globe and Miami the presence of federal troops and the up
building of loyalty leagues, together with the building up of a strong force
of deputies by the sheriff, is clearing the way for the removal of intimidation.
At Clifton and Morenci like steps are under way, but less advanced. Federal
troops are needed there to assist with the removal of the fear of violence
that has been insiduously implanted during the last several months the I.
W. W. element really has been in command of the strike movement.
At Ray, Ajo, Superior and Douglas, the I. W. W. strike makers have been
unable to gain the slightest footing. Miners, mill and smeltter workers, citi
zens and business men, effectively made known to agitators upon their first
appearance in these localities that their presence would net be tolerated,
and set them on their way. The L W. W. agitator who went there to start
things found a 100 per cent American camp, and no sympathy for anything
he had with him. Sheriff Rye Miles, of Pima county, appeared in the district
close on the heels of the agitator. The latter's stay was brief, but long enough
for him to witness a patriotic demonstration in which the entire camp took
part, headed by the sheriff on horseback, carrying an American flag that he
ould not have managed on foot. The

cated to be a matter of probably ten days more. In the Warren district it
will be much less. The slipping here has been the most marked experienced
in any of the strike-infested districts. The preponderance of solid American
citizens is in the main the explanation. All doubt that disloyalty to the gov
ernment and sympathy with Germany underlies the entire strike movement
in the state has been dissipated by the actions and talk of the strikers. No
haste has attended the making up of minds in this respect and the reaching
of decisions as to methods of procedure in combatting the evil, but deter
mination has been with every step. When the job is finished it will be of
permanent character and the L W. W. trouble-breeder and strike-maker a
minus quantity in the state. Incidentally, there is likely to be a far less
number of foreigners employed when the weeding-out process is finished, and
incidentally also the government will doubtless be m possession of many
records which will amply justify either detentions or deportations of unde
sirable aliens, made so through utterances and general conduct during the
strike period.
How much embarrassment the closing down of copper mines and ore
reduction plants to Arizona and other producing divisions of the country is
going to cause the federal government and its allies before the summer is over,
depends entirely upon how long the strikes are permitted to continue.
July 1, the refineries had on hand and in transit only about a seven-weeks'
'supply of treatable crude copper. To that time the Arizona suspensions of
production because of strikes had not entered the refinery calculations In
the east. Butte's curtailment was Just beginning to be felt, the smelter cur
tailment having been only briefly in effect.
' As of present date, Arizona has drawn down her normal copper ship
ments. 17,000.000 pounds for the first half of July. This tonnage is repre
sented in the loss of production from International smelter at Miami, the
smelters at Clifton and Morenci, and the smelter of Old Dominion at Globe.
Other smelting plants of the state are
without decrease in output. Although some of the mines upon which they
depend for ore have closed down or are operating at reduced output of ore,
there was sufficient ore bedded down at the smelters in advance of their
strike troubles to keep the plants going. All of them have from four to six
weeks' ore supplies ahead at this time,
able to make is being added daily. Resumption of operations at the mines

CURTAIU-1ENT OF

The strike among copper miners of
the country one of the most-far
reaching disturbances in the history of
the Industry has tied up or seriously
affected the production of 100.000,000
pounds of copper monthly. If long
maintained, it will have disastrous re
sults at a time when the metal will be
urgently needed for war munitions.
Complete suspension of production
has taken place in the Morenct-Clifton-Globe
districts of Arizona while cur
tailment in the Bisbee camp of the
same state has cut down output more
than 50 per cent.
The strike bad its Inception in the
Jerome camp of Arizona, where it re
stricted production at the United Ver
de and United Verde Extension
properties. It has since spread to the
Kennecot mine of Alaska, almost par
alized operations in Butte and has
worked its way around to the South
west again.

Not all of the mines affected have
been forced to entirely cease opera
tions as in the case of Calumet &
Arizona and Copper Queen, each of
which is running at about 50 per cent
of capacity. The Phelps Dodge prop
erty in the Clifton camp, has shut
down, however. The Greene shut
down was the result of Mexican
troubles.
Although Miami and Inspiration
have closed down, advices from there
indicate that the majority of the men
were not in favor of a strike, but in
view of intimidations the men have
been forced out temporarily.
The establishment of a $6 wage per

copper is one of the chief contentions
of the I. W. W. Their main effort,
however, appears to be control of the
unions in the various camps. Hereto

In the midst of the highest wages

the world, opportunity for the largest
employment in the history of Arizona,;
and the greatest demand for its prin-,
cipal output, copper, in all history, the
state is approaching the necessity of)
arranging for the largest charity
movement for the relief of its own
people that it has ever faced. I
"The men have no call upon any
body for sympathy or aid, but we can
not let women and children suffer
because of -either the lack of sense,

which are affected in the state," de-'
clared a prominent mine manager to-'
day. "Unless the situatoin Is relieved

LW.W. AGITATION
TO CAUSE COPPER
SHORTAGE IN U.S.
Best Authorities Point Out
That Strikes Will Eventual
ly Have Serious Effect on
Industries.
Some of the best authorities in the
copper trade point out that the strikes
now going on in many producing dis
tricts, while having a tendency to
check any buying of the metal, will
eventually have what might result in
a most serious effect on the indus
tries or this cotintry. That there will
be a scarcity of the metal is the con
census in the trade.
This scarcity, it is pointed out, will
not be felt until from 60 to 90 days
from now. At present the refineries
are working on the metal which was
produced months ago and therefore
the supply will ctome on the market un
interruptedly for A while. However,
probably by September 15. or later, if
the present strikes continue, there
will be a shortage of the metal and
the consumers in need will be in a
difficult position, authorities say.
"It must be remembered." said one
man, "that we have made contracts
for copper for delivery in September
and later, which in my opinion we
will have difficulty in filling. Thus far
we are receiving the metal fi'om re
fineries, but In two months or so there
will be a lull in refinery production un
less the strikes are settled soon.
U. S. Large Buyer
"The government will be a large
buyer of copper for its own account
aa well as for the allies and this fact
coupled with the 1 smaller production
because bf the labor disturbances, will
delay deliveries to such an extent that
a most serious problem might be fac
ing the producers as well as the var
ious industries using copper by the
end of September."
It can be stated on the highest
authority that the contract with the
government, entered into by the pro
ducers, specifically calls for 25c per
pound, and that there is no possibil
ity tf a readjustment of the price. One
who has taken part in all conferences
on government business, in discussing
the readjustment statement, says:
"There is no possibility of a read
justment of price on the last govern
ment order and to anyone who knows
the situation articles stating there will
be, appear most ridiculous. Th'jse who
are employing the government, or will
supply it, know that the price has
been fixed on that contract at 25 cents
per pound."

PRESCOTT, Ariz.. July 14. During
the month of June the mines of Yava
pai county produced about 13,000.000
pounds of copper of an estimated to
tal value of $4,000,000. based upon an
average price of 30 cents per pound.
Jerome, and the famous United
Verde mine, as usual, headed the list
in copper poundage and value. The
United Verde Extension mine was,
however, a close second. Upon com
pletion of its smelter at Cottonwood,
about five miles south of Jerome, the
Verde Extension will probably equal
if not exceed the monthly output of
Its noted neighbor. Following are the
copper output figures for June. Thy
are in the main correct, although a
closer checking up of late June ship
ments may alter them slightly one
way or the other:
United Verde mine. 6,800.000 pounds;
United Verde Extension mine. 5.200,
000 pounds: Arizona Binghamton
mine. 400.000 pounds; Blue Bell and
De Soto mines, 541.000 pounds; Cop
per Queen mine. 30.000 pounds; But
ternut and Henrietta mines. 100.000
pounds; Commercial mine, 12.000
pounds; Copper Hill mine. 2.000
pounds. In addition to the foregoing
the Dundee-Arizona mine at Jerome
sent out about 125 tons of copper-gold-silver
ore during June of a general
average value of $20 per ton. This
ore was mined at shallow depth in
workings other than those giving off
from the main shaft.
Increasing Output.
The Blue Bell and De Soto mines,
located to the south of the Arizona
Binehamton. near Mayer, are operated
in conjunction with the Humboldt
! smelter Their output represents
about one-third of the ore treated at
that plant The ore fiDra the Copper
Queen mine, adjoining the Arlzona
Binghamton was treated in the latter's
milL The ore from the Commercial
mine, located in Copper Basin, and
owned by the Phelps Dodge company,
was sent as a flux to the United
Verde and Humboldt smelters. A por
tion of the United Verde Extension
ore was forwarded to the Humboldt
smelter, but the greater portion was
shipped to the Phelos Dodge smelters
at outside points. The Henrietta and
Butternut ores were reduced at the
smelter at Mayer. The Copper Hill
ore was shipped to the sampler at
Wickenburg. The ore from the Cop
per Hill runs high in molybdenite and
is being mined and shipped at a gen
erous profit.
A noteworthy feature attaching to
the output of copper from Yavapai
county is the increasing poundage
contributed by mines located along the
belt of mineralized schist which Dr.
Walter Harvey Weed. J. H. Shockley
and other noted geologists have pro
nounced to be the south extension of
the famous Verde copper belt. An
equally noteworthy feature is the num
ber of copper properties in this belt
that are in the partialljproductive
and nearly-productive stages of de
velopment. " Taken in rotation from
Jerome southward the list of such
properties reads as follows:
Blue Monster, Copper Lode Mines.
Loroa Verde Copper, Big Reef Copper
and Arizona Copper Queen any or
all of these properties possess copper
yielding possibilities similar to prop
erties in a like stage of development
at Jerome, while the roster of produc
ing mines exceeds In number the list

property to the south of Jerome; de

OATMAN. Aril., July 14. What con-,
servative mining engineers have pro-,
nounced the greatest strike in the
Oatman district since the drills cut
into the great United Eastern rein,'
two years ago, occurred at the Tel-'
luride property last Saturday, July 7.
In many respects this strike is his
toric in the Oatman district. It was
made almost two years to a day after;
the main strike on the 'United East- j
era occurred, and it was made by J.i
L. Mclver, one of the men who dorvcl

In addition to having charge of a;

in the southern part of Arizona. They
have worked harder during the pajti
two years Cian they ever did while
running a drill or sinking shafts on
contract or competing for champion-1
ship honors against the best jack
drillers, in the world. j
Of late, they found it necessary toj
divide up their activities. Long at-;

faith in the property that led inves
tors all over the country to buy stocH

was exhausted, Mclver demonstrated
his own confidence in Telluride by
financing the development work him

the length of three and one-half claims,
or over one mile.
A shaft 535 feet deep was sunk on
the Telluride by Long and Mclver and
crosscuts run to the vein at the 475
and the 533-foot levels. No discovery
of importance was made on the 475
foot level, though the vein was ex
plored for 200 or 300 feet but the
existence of quartz in place of good
width convinced Jack Mclver that
proper depth would bring values and
good ones. In fact, he freely predict
ed that the Telluride would be one of
the biggest mines in the country as
soo nas the development work on the
upper levels was completed.
This preditcion is justified in a
measure today. The discovery was
made in the northwest drift, about 60U
feet from the point where the vein
crosses from Telluride into Tom Reed
ground.
Ticking up a piece of rock. Jack Mc
lver noted that it was shot full of
free gold. Assays of the day before
had revealed no values other than the
usual $3 and 4 that had been found
all the way from' the shaft. To be
sure, some higher values had oc
curred in spots, but the general aver
age was low with the vein matter
shattered and uneven.
But investigation proved that the
last round of holes has blasted into
a veritable nest of high grade. A
winze was at once started, as it was
evidence that the streak of pure hard
quartz had been opened at the top
and that it would probably widen out
with depth.
This assumption proved true, and
the winze is all in rich ore assaying
between $100 and $200 per ton, with
some assays running much higher.
While- the body of ore has not yet
been proved to be of sufficient extent
to call it a mine, yet the formation
is so regular and the vein is so uni
form that conservative mining men
all agree that the Telluride has en
tered the ranks of the genuine mines.
General SupL J. A. Burgess, of the
United Eastern, after a careful exam
ination, sampling and assaying, pro
nounced the discovery at the Telluride
a discovery of first-rate importance,
the greatest since the find at the
United Eastern. As there is no more
careful and conservative mining engi
neer anywhere than Mr. Burgess, this
statement is regarded as conveying
unusual significance.
Instead of staying here to follow up
his great discovery, it is characteristic
of Mr. Mclver that he left the next day
for a long-cherished ambition to see
the Grand Canyon of Arizona. He
took the strike as a matter of course;
in fact, he was so sure of it that it
caused him no thrill of excitement
when the expected happened.
The Telluride discovery revives in
terest in the adjoining property, the
Sunnyside, where drifting is now in
Drogress on the same vein and the
Tom Reerf, where this branch of the
vein system has never been explored.

WEEKLY NEWS LETTER YOUNG
MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
Some tired hunch of patriots that
returned from the excursion guarding
the wobblies down to Columbus. N.
M., and no place looked more inviting
than the good old shower baths, and
the plunge simply restored the almost
dead crowd of "refugees."
Secretaries of the Y. M. C. A. are
becoming scarcer daily, due to the
growing demand of the army Y. M.
C. A. work, and the fact that so many
of the secretaries have joined the reg
ular army forces. Mr. Richardson is
now asked to supply two experienced
men for service In the training camps
for the southwest, but is unable to re
spond to the request as he can't ev n
supply sufficient men for manning the
forces for the local associations.
Geo. R. Seals, chauffeur to Dr. Ricli
etts. Is a new arrival In the district,
and the first day he made his way to
the association building and took a
membership. While it is true, due to
his duties with Dr. Ricketts, which
will take him out of the district, still
Seals recognizes the universal privi
leges allowed by the ownership of the
Bisbee membership card, so it will be
used to good advantage throughout
the whole continent
The Duck Pin tournament is coming
along nicely. We will be ready to
wallop Douglas In a short time our
boys are making better average scores
with the Duck Pins than were made
with the ten pins.
The men in the district are cer
tainly looking upon the Y as "home,
sweet home," for In the evenings the
lobby Is over-crowded and if the at
tendance continues to increase It will
be necessary in some way to make
more room.
Chas. McQuay, of the recorder's of
fice in Tombstone, was in Bisbee yes
terday on one of his bi-weekly visits.
Two weeks seems to be Charles limit
of endurance at the county seat, after
which he comes back to the city for
some excitement, which is easily found
lately.
Percy Jones leaves soon for a com
bined business trip and vacation to
New Mexico.
A manger recently asked whidi
building was the Y. M. C. A. which
the Y. W. C. A. We sometimes think
while looking at Miss Moyer's veran
da she has more Y. W. boys than girls.
Perhaps on more needed work Is
being done at the Y. M. C. A. at the
present time than that of organizing
and training of the Ambulance Com
pany, under the efficient direction and
supervision of Major Bowker. who has
undetraken to supply a full complo
ment of 119 men for government serv
ice in the Ambulance Corps. This
company started with' a membership
of eleven, about a week ago, and at
the present time 85 men have en
rolled. Several more are giving con
sideration to the matter, and the
doctor is quite confident he will be
able to supply the necessary men and
equipment for this trip to "somewhere
in France" by August 1. Anyone giv
ing 'thought to enrolling In the Ambu
lance Company should either see Ma
jor Bowker, or Secretary Richardson
at the "Y," within the next few days.
More than 10,000 Testaments have
been given enlisted men at Fort Slo
cum by the Y. M. C. A. A copy fell
Into the hands of a recruit who had
put three years into a university, and
joined the army to study law during
his leisure hours. Sixty days after
having the book and reading it he
asked the secretary to show him how
to become a minister. Later he grad-'
uated from Princeton, became a min
ister and a moderator if his church.
In one month 1.593 Testaments were
given out 401 to Inquirers and as a
result one soldier has a Bible class,
another has helped in paying the rent
of the shack Just off the reservation
in which gospel meetings are held.
Numerous circulars are being re
ceived at the local association, an
nouncing the summer school for Y.
M. C. A. workers, and thsoe who may
be interested in entering association
work of the Estes Park conference.
Not only is Estes Park Y. M. C. A.
plant used for school purposes, but is
also becoming to be quite a summer
vacation point
Estes Park Is one of Colorado's
most popular summer playgrounds. It
is located at the foot of grim, scarred
Long's Peak. Here the continental di
vide, the main range of the Rockier:,
stretches out a spur like a crooked
arm. Within its circle nestles a nat-
ural amphitheater of a hundred thou
sand acres. This is Estes Park, car
peted with thousands of acres of mea
dow land and walled by 15 snow peaks
wiiicii rise sheer from three sides.
Within this wonderland the lover
of nature will find her in a thousand
moods and dressed In a hunderd ways.
If he is a fisherman, a dozen trout
streams and a score of mountain lakes
tempt him.
One hundred and fifty mileB of
splendidly built and kept roads make
motoring a delight, and as many ad
ditional miles of well-built trails are
1 accessible to horseback riders.
And tiien there are tramps and pic
nics and excursions to some of the sev
eral glaciers through mighty forests
or lon the canons. For Uiose who
prefer more domestic sports there are
tennis, baseball and gcif.
In this wonderful park, the Estes
Park conference has its beautiful
grounds of 500 acres. I'pward of 100
buildings provide substantial, attract
ive end commodious accommodations
for the conference guests. These iiv
elude 75 cottages, in which are pro
vided sleeping accommodations for
more than 500 people, the administra
tion building, with office, class itoms,
general store, barber shop, baths and
toilets, and social corridor; the Dym
naslum and assembly hall; the dining
hall, with complete culinary facilities
in the rear, and class rooms. In ad
dition, there are six tennis courts,
baseball diamond and athletic field.
Water is supplied from a pure cold
mountain spring.
The most recent development in the
way of entertainment of the member
ship of the association, and also for
those of the community who are in
terested, is the Sunday night movies
at the "Y." Recently sne association
purchased an entirely new equipment
and a new motor driven Simplex i
chine, though modern in all of its
equipments, It is reputed to be the
very best make of any machine on
the market While the nature of the
shows is quite different from those
ordinarily shown In the moving pic
ture houses, the films being shown
are either of an educational or relig
ious nature, and have proven to be a
great value to th'ose wao have had
an opportunity to see them. Regard
less of membership in the asocia-
tion, anyone and everyone is invited
to attend the Sunday night movies. Mr.
Lewis, the well known local soloist
will sing the new song( "I Love You
Arizona" tonight The author of this
sing was formerly a Bisbee girl and
the popularity of the state anthem is
well known.
Claude Smith, who has been in Bis
bee only for a few weeks, and who
had become a member ot the Y., left
this week for his home In Salt Lake
City. During Smith's brief stay In Bis
bee the Y. bad become bis favorite

Last but not least to get the tennis

James Farmer left Bisbee for San
Diego by auto and expects to have a
pretty gotod time while on the road.
Word has been received from David
Dozier at the Grand Canyon that he
sure is having some time. David has
been gone about two weeks and has
only spent $1.40 and says he has not
been hungry either. He will tell us
how he did It when he gets back In
about four or five days.
Secretary Tom Nelson, from the
Douglas Y. M. C. A., was aiming the
deputies sent up from Douglas to help
the Bisbee deputies in their bis

General Secretary A. R. Richardson
and Gustav Ziprik went to Douglas

NEW YORK, July 14. After a brief
period of hesitation at the opening of
today market bounded forward on a
broad inquiry for rails, shippings and
some of the less active specialties.
Trading became more sharply defined
with, the progress of the short session
industrials, notably the steels and
equipments, showing only moderate
strength, at best and falling away to
wards the end. United States Steel
forfetited virtually all its one point
gain and some others of the same
class finished at moderate net losses.
The movement' in rails centered
around Canadian Pacific, its sub Soo,
and Southern Pacific, New York Cen
tral and the entire coal group at ex
treme gains of lVs to four points.
Shippings were featured by an ad
vance of 3 points in American In
ternational Corporation but munitions
and associated issues were irregular
ly lower.
The general bond market was
steady, a few of the minor rails re
cording fractional advances, while in
ternational issues held firm.
Total sales, par value, $1,825,000.
On call during the week the United
Sutes and registered fours declined
one per cent with one per cent in ad
vance in registered 3's and V per
cent decline on registered 4's.
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. July 14. Corn averaged
higher in value today despite some
setbacks due largely to bearish infer
ences regarding the outlook for peace.
Scarcity of supplies available for im
mediate use formed the chief element
of strength.
The market closed unsettled at the
same as yesterday's finish to cents
up with $1.5914 for September and
$1.12"4 to Vi for December. Wheat
gained 1 cent net closing $2.04 for
July and $1.95V& for September.
Oato- were unchanged to V
higher and provisions varying from
five cents decline to a rise of 25
cents.
Business in wheat remained at nearly
the zero stage awaiting congressional
action at Washington as to the food
control bill. Meanwhile prices hard
ened a little influenced perhaps ty
current bullish crop reports from Can
ada and North Dakota and by a gov
ernment decree lifting quotations in
France to $3.05 a bushel.
Oats duplicated the action of corn.
Some reduction in the visible supply
of oats was expected to be shown in
the weekly statement on Monday.
Demand for lard was stimulated by
peace talk. Other provisions shared
more or less in the attendant advance.

WEEKLY MARKET REVIEW
NEW YORK, July 14. Uncertainty
respecting the attitude of the federal
authorities towards the countries lead
ing industries, recucrrence of high call
money rates, peace reports and signs
of partial check in important branch
es of trade furnished the short in
terest with plenty of ammunition dur
ing the week.
Trading in stocks was on a larg
er and broader basis, but the expan
sion was affected almost entirely at
the expense of quoted values. ' War
shares suffered the greatest shrink
age and specialties which follow in
their train also were unsettled.
Growing realization of the advant
ages accruing to the transportation
companies in the rate decision and
the more promising crop outlook were
of distinct benefit to railroad shares.
including many of the low priced is
sues. Steamship stocks were unaf
fected by the president's allusion to
prevailing high ocean freight rates,
their course pointing to substantial
absorption.
Remittances to foreign centers were
less favorable to this market, sterling
advancing slightly over its fixed quo
tations of many months, with a stiffen-;
ing of francs, rubles and lires.

NEW YORK, July 14. As we have
been advising for some time we still
see nothing to encourage taking an
aggressive stand on the long side of
the stock market, especially on the
industrials and especially on those
that have advanced to present levels
on past handsome profits on foreign
and domestic trade. The fears of I
price fixing and the more hopeful news
of peace has told the story of the past
few days weakness and unless some- t
thing positive soon comes from Wash
ington to indicate greater encourage
ment to corporations , etc., as to sell
ing prices, we still fear liquidation will
be in order by many holders of se
curities who have felt that while low
prices would be made to our govern

price was to be named to all. The un-
