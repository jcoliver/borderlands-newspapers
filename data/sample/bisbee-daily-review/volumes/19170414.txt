International War Council '
Next Week Will Also Take
Up Discussion of Terms of
Peace At War's End.
(Ry Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. April 13. The
international war council to assemble
here within the next 'week and to
which Great Britain and France are
sending eniiniuent statesmen, soldiers
?nd sailors, was stated officially today
to have very largely fur its purpose
enabling the United States to avoid
the mistakes and diUirulties whicu be
set the allies when they entered the
war. .
American ofiicials in all departments
will have the opportunity, it was stat
ed, to meet the foreign commissioners
personally, discuss with them the les
sens tauuht by the war, and consider
the broad principles whereby the
I'nited States can marshal its forces
for the sreat strangle with the mini
mum of waste and delay. j
It is realized everywuere that this
country faces a stupenduous task in j
converting itself, almost overnight, i
from a peace basi:i to a universal mil
itary, naval, industrial and agricul
tural mobilization. The problem is
to fill all these separate and unex
pected demands with'jut having each
cripple the other.
Closelv allied to this rhase of tne
conference will be the information i
gained at first hand as to now Araet-j
ica's resources can lie best distribiiied j
against the common enemy. Study ,
will be made as to how this country's
power can be dovetailed into thai Vf
the entente, is that the United States ,
will be free so dedicate itself only to '
the essentials and save duplication of i
effort. j
There will be some discussion in ;
the conference of the attitude of tne !
United States toward the ultimate
peace terms. It is thought the en
tente powers intend to agree to such
terms as will warrant the United
St3tes in fighting unreservedly with
them.
The highest l.'.mors that the United
States can offer are planned for t'ie
British and French commissioners.
The chiefs of ihe commissions. Includ
ing Foreign Secretary Balbour and
others of the English group and Min
ister of Justice Viviani and Field
Marshal Joffre of the French, will be
welcomed by the highest otlicials of
the government and entertained as
guests "jf the nation.

Saturday Morning, April 14, 1917.
IT WILL BE A REAL WAR.
It must have dawned on most of us by this time tliat
in entering the war "we are entering upon a tremendously
serious business.
We shall not find the war any child's game. We shall
not find it a mere stage drama on which we may look as
thrilled but remote spectators. We shall not find it a
summer's sport. We' shall not be able to wage war as
a skilled speculator plays the stock-market. We shall
not be able, with all our wealth and our imagined re
moteness from the scene of conflict, to buy substitute
fighters or purchase immunity from suffering.
Of course, we need not expect to suffer as the Belgians,
the Serbians, the Poles, the French, have suffered. In
vasion of our soil is, still unthinkable. We may not
be obliged to put millions cf our young men into the
trenches as cannon fodder. We shall hardly feel the
sorrows of bereavement or the pinch of hunger or the
burdensome taxation and financial exhaustion of the
nations that have borne the brunt of the battle for nearly
three years. But we shall probably be chastened, never
theless, before we get through, by grief and loss ar.d
hardship and disappointment.
The sinking of a few ships since Germany entered i.p
on the ruthless policy that drove us to armed defense
has been but a mild beginning. We shall have msny
ships sunk. We may lose half our shipping. We may
lose a large part of our war fleet. We may find the prob
lem of getting munitions and supplies across the water
10 our associates-in-war increasingly difficult. We may
fin our commerce menaced and limited cn our own
coast. We may see our seaports bombarded. We may
see "our ships and factories blown up by enemies In our
midst. " We mayuffer from food scarcity more than we
think. We may have war with Mexico, with all the ePort
and loss that such a struggle would entail. We may
lose thousands of sailors from our navy and our mer
chant fleet We may lose tens of thousands of soldiers.
We may grow sad at heart as the war drags on and the
end and we seek recedes like the end of the rainbow.
To take our task lightly and cheerily would be to
sport with tragedy and Invite disaster. We must set to
. vork with a grim consciousness of what this great ad
venture means. We must determine that, whatever
cemes, we shall see It through. We mrst f;ce the Mp
that the burden might, eventually, fall upon us alone,
i.nd agree that we shall not flinch in our purpose even
if all the other nations seeking to subdue the Prussian
menace should weaken and yield.
We know that we shall win. Ii ts inconceiveable that
so great and powerful a people should not win In so
just and noble a cause, but we shall win the more easily
and quickly if we magnify our task rather than mini
mize it, and set to work with the feeling that we are
more responsible than France or Russia or Great Britain,
or all of them together, for putting down this monster
that threatens the world's freedom and civilization.
We rather think in the light of later developments that
they did. Not directly, of course, but effectively. They
stole forty-seven votes from Governor Campbell and
though they were not allowed to keep them, the voles
were not returned to him. Their failure to make a
"clean getaway" also furnished the reason and the only
reason why Snowflake precinct was attacked, resulting
in the loss to Governor Campbell of 11S votes, and the
disfranchisement of an honorable, law-abiding commun
ity. Altogether we think the corrupto's of the ballot at
Douglas appear to have executed a very successful Lit
of thievery.

THE YOUNG MEN WILL COME.
The slowness of recruiting to date is no sign of lack
of patriotism or courage in our young men, says the Chi-
CRgo Tribune. The country is not in danger of invasion,
hence the greatest stimulas to enlistment is entirely ;
lacking, and while the navy Is far short of the number J
nf mon nppf1p1 fnf liuttlo tfio alliart Raata am Kawaa,, it
and the enemy.
America has no latention of fighting aladies' war.
America is going to fight, and when America gets started
it is going to fight with more originality, more initiative,
and more savagery than any nation in the trenches.
Our fightng men are not backward. They are settling
their private affairs prior to enlistment or are detennin-
ing individually whether this duty is their j
To all well men of military age The Tribune has no
hesitancy in saying that their duty is to enlist unless !
they have some other duty which, in the present stage j
of the war, is superior. For instance, the family man I
whose family Is dependent upon his dally labor for support
should not join the army or navy at this t'ire. Every
other young man should enlist. Duty to the nation in
war is paramount to personal safety, to an easy life,
to a comfortable salary, even in the propitious beginning
of a promising career. The obligation to enlist Is cn
every well young man who has not a family dependent j
upon him. Every such man who fails to enlist makes a
public acknowledgement of either a lack of patriotism or
a lack of courage. j
The duty rests upon them all, but it does not rest with 1
equal weight. The obligation to enlist for the war is
greater upon rich young men than upon poor young men.
The nation has dene more for the rich young men than Two Others Are Released,

HOLDS FIVE GERMANS
IS CRIME TO GO UNPUNISHED?
What steps, if any, have Deen taken toward the pro
secution of the men engaged in the election fraud in
Douglas precinct No. 1?, says the Arizona Republican.
It was suggested at the time a month ago when this mat
ter was fresh in the public mind and the guilty parties
were endeavoring to secure the fruits of the frauds by
perjury, that the federal government should take it up
since the election of congressmen were affected by the !
frauds. But last Monday the United States supreme '
court, In the Rhode Island conspiracy cases, handed
i
down a decision which, while not declaring that the fed
eral government is without jurisdiction in matters aris
ing out of general state elections, greatly restricts it in
such cases.
Therefore, unless those frauds, which were of the
grossest characters are not left to go unpunished, action
must be taken by the state. If the state takes no action,
and any citizen can initiate proceedings, no Arizonian
can complain with good grace if the same thing should
be attempted two years hence.
The forbearance or Hie state would be an incentive
f to Renewed attempts since it would appear that those who
corrupt the. ballot "have nothing to his? anil something to
gain. That In the Douglas incident they did not "get
away with it" is no sign that they will not succeed the
next time.
But. .in it true tliat tliev did not "get away with it?"
it has done for the poor young men. Again, the success
ful outcome of the war is of even greater consequent
to rich young men than it is to poor young men.
greater argument is that the inseparable deprivation of
active service weighs less than upon rich young men
han upon poor young men.
From the experience of the past, American soldiers ex
pect neglect from their government and from the estab
lished eleemosynary institutions which work under gov
eminent regulation. Poor young men in the army are
entirely dependent upon the management of the aut'.ict
ities. Rich young men in the service are, to a large
extent, beyond it. They can buy their own clothes and
furnish their own food. r ,
The risks of war are equal, but the injury done to
the wounded and the permanently sick is not equal. The
poor man returning with a leg or an arm gone or with
a shattered constitution has a handicap throughout life
which the govrenment can never equalize with a pension.
A private fortune will not furnish a lost limb or restore
a shattered constitution, but it will ameliorate the suffer
ing resulting therefrom.
The poor young man supporting a wife and family can
not go to war, because upon him devolves the support
of this wife and family, but the rich young man or the
young man with a rich wife is not needed at heme to
support a famly. His duty to go to war is as great, as
the duty of any bachelor. If the rich young wife !s
bereft it is a tragedy, but a less tragedy than many trr,'.:
edies the war must produce. . j
The war has come, but it has net yet come iiome to
us. It is only beginning to come home. Each day mere
young men will see their duty. The rich young men
who indeed can be most easily spared will see it f5rtt.
This summer on the golf links and polo field and tennis
courts there will be only women and middle aged men.
By July a putter or a polo mallet or a tennis raequet in
& young man's hand will be equivalent to a white feather.
There is a virility In our young manhood that all the
pacifist propaganda has not been able to decay. It will
be seen in the eyes of the young men as they leave the l
softness of peace for the training camps. And the
women left behind will be proud in discovering it.

THESE WONDERFUL CORRESPONDENTS.
We have read an article in the Engineering & Mining
Journal on the Ajo mining district of Arizona, in which
the writer says that section Is infested wth ants, scorp
ions, tarantulas and Gila monsters, says George A. New
ett in Iron Ore. This will all be news to the residents
of that particular section of country. We were told
while at Ajo, recently that only one Gila monster had
been captured in that place during the last two yars
so far as the inhabitants knew. At that the Gila monster
i3 a very sluggish sort of lizard that interferes with no
one, and even if it docs bite when much provoked, it
is said there's no poison in it. As far the other insects
this mining writer speaks about, they are seldom seen
any trouble only a little. The Lake Superior mosquito,
during the season in which he is doing business, is mm h
more active and annoying. Some of these eastern chaps
have a lot to learn concerning the animal and insect
i . . I ;
life of the far southwest. It is apparent that the gentie- (
man who wrote l.'ie recent account of these things in
Ajo uiiist have been an easy mark for some local juki'r.
Writers on mining subjects who are not familiar with
i
the insects of Arizona should not attempt their desi-np- '
tion as it rather detracts from the mineral presentativej. I

up and" tagged him on the forehead
during the third inning. The ball
bounced from the Count's head and
struck Honus Pnkard's glove and re

ed with loud cheers. The cheering
was so loud, in fact, that the outfield

conclusion of the game Mr. Lavel)p

nay was "not like the wav up used

cording to reports last night'. Amos
Demilo Newman, official water carri

the last half of the ninth when they

Known In District On Friday
the Thirteenth; Many Suffer
llO-ho-hum: (denoting a long sigh
of relief!.
Yesterday wan Friday, the Thir
teenth and, in spite of predictions
that the world would never live thru
it. here it is the fourteenth and the
ol' worid is still rolling gaily around
between Jupiter. Mars, Halley's Com
et and other elements that might have
crashed into us if Friday the Thir
teenth had turned out like some peo
ple thought it would.
There may be no foundation for the
belief that Friday the Thirteenth is
any more unlucky than any other day.
but it must be admitted that certain
things happened yesterday in peculiar
ways. Here are a few of them:
.Trouble Starts Early
At 2:13 yesterday morning fire was
discovered in a barber shop on Main
street. Fire Chief Barney Norton
rode thirteen blocks 'from his home,
and with his firemen and thirteen vol
unteers put the fire out in thirteen
minutes. At thirteen mniutes after
one. while Barney was walking up the
stairs of the city hall, he thought he
heard an alarm come in from Box 1.1.
In his eagerness to get down stairs
he slipped on the thirteenth step and
rolled thirten feet to the bottom.
When he clambered to his feet, he
found that 13 cents had fallen on;, of
bis pocket and disappeared th'.ough
a crack in the floor thirteen inches
'on?. Barney is sure Friday the
Thirteenth is unlucky.
Piccolo Explodes

waver of the Orpheum symphony or

that the instrument was thirteen inch

JACK STANDING IS !
FEATURED AT EAGLEi
"One Touch of Sin," Fox Fea
ture, To Be Presented At
Main Street House Today.
It's very convenient for Jack Stand
in? that he livus near the William Fox
studio in California. )
Jack must tub every morning. He's
English, but has learned American
ways enoueh to feel sure that the day
is not complete without the matuti
nal bath. That' what pives him the
fresh appearance that distinauishes
his work in "One Touch of Sin." This
feature appears today and Sunday at
the Kas!e theatre.
The trouble wit'i California tubbing
is that the hot and cold water pines
are so close toeether that they often
pet mixed. One doesn't obieet to bav
in? cold hot water: but hot cold wat
er is another thin?. Jack Standing
c?nnot bathe in it.
In the actor's buncalow. this state
of thinas exists. Consequently it is
nothine uncommon to see a ficure
clad in a Ion? robe ran hastily across
the street, on a warm mornin?. and
disappear within the door of the Fox
studio'.
There Jack finds the tank of cooling:
water waitin? for him. He is always
early enough not to disturb anyone
else about the place. And he tubs to
his heart's content.

Northeast of St. Quentin the Brit
ish advanced on a line between Har
picourt and Met7-on-Couture, captur
inc two woods, the Sart farm and the
village or Gouzencourt. This advance
enlarged the salient in the German
lines between St. Quentin and Cam
brai and outflanked the Havreineourt
wood on the south.
French troops are hotly ensaped
with the Germans south of St. Quen
tin between the Somme river and the
St. Quentin railway. The latest of
ficial statement from Paris says the
battle continues in front of the posi
tion captured by the French. The
Germans resisted desperately but the
French carried several lines of trench
es between the river and the railway.
Aftillery actions are reported be
tween the Somme and the Oise and in
Champaigne.
German thrusts. Rerlin says, counter-balanced
firitish attacks on An
gres and Givenchy-en-Gohelle and
near the Searpe British attacks are
reported to have been repulsed with
losses. Berlin reports only minor en
gagements north of St. Quentin and
savs that French attacks failed on
both banks of the Somme south of St.
Quentin.
On the eastern front there has been
some activity in Galicia near Sokai
and near the Bystrleza river. At the
latter place. Petroprad says. Austrian
soldiers, who were advancing toward
the Russian trenches with white flaps
were shelled and dispersed by Aus-tro-German
puns. On the Austro-Ital-ian
front and in .Macedonia there has
teen only artillery duels and minor
raids.
Two British hospital ships, the Sal
ts and the Cloucester Castle have
been sunk. The Salta struck a mine
with the loss of 52 lives and the Glou
cester Castle was torpedoed without
warning by a submarine. All the
wounded on the Gloucester Castle
were saved.
Quite by chance, his work came to
the attention of the' Balboa Company
and he went to work at their Ixing
Beach studio. Soon his ability be
came apparent and he was given a
chance to try out some of his ideas
about direction. His success was immediate.

extended down the west end of the
Nevsky Prospect. V?ien the Asso

he found the crowd trying to stonii
the railway station to which were ad

deputation from the ministry of jus

At the suggestion of Minister of
Justice Kerensky, the welcoming of
Madame Breshkovskaya took place in
the gorgeous suite In the railway sta
tion called the imperial reception
rooms, which, under the ol.'. regime,
were used only for the reception of
royal personages.
The large drawing room in this
suite which had been the scene of
meetings of the world"s most power
ful tnonarchs was now the gathering
place of the world's most xtreme
democrats, republicans and socialists.
Around the room were scores of bas
kets and wreathes of flowers, the scar

fair to become the floral enib!eni of
the new Russia.
Among the revolutionary veterans
the correspondent found Mme. Vera
Figner who spent twenty yeare in jail.
Beside her stood Mile. Za3sulicb.

despotic governor of Petrograd, in
vengeance for his reputed torturing of
political prisoners. By mi irony of
the revolution. General Trepoft's son.
former premier TrepofT. is today a

Concersing with Mile. Zassi'lith
was M. Panuch, who was sentenrcd
to death on a trumped up choree of
conspiracy to murder Emperor Nich

Petrograd in chains.
