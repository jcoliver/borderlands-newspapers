Clothe and Feed Armies,
Says Houston.
SAYS DONT DISCARD
CLOTHING FOR WHIM
"Make Saving Rather Than
Spending Your Social
Standard," Make Economy
Fashionable, Urges Expert
(By Review Leased Wire). ,
WASHINGTON, May 5 In an ap
peal today "to the women of the Un
ited States," Secretary Houston de
clared that they can do their bit most
effectually in the national emergency
by practicing effective thrift in their
households.
The appeal was prompted by ques
tions as to the service women can
render the nation in producing and
conserving agricultural products.
Thrift Urged at Slogan
"Every woman can render import-
ant service to the nation in its pres
ent emergency," said the appeal.
"She need not leave her home or aban
don her home duties to help the arm
ed forces. She can help to feed and
clothe our armies and help supply
food to those beyond the seas by
practicing, effective thrift. ,
Dont Waste an Ounce
"Every ounce of food the house
wife saves from being wasted in her
home all food which she or her chil
dren produce in the garden and can
or preserve every garment which
care and skillful repair make it un
necessary to replace all lessen that
which households draft on the alrea
dy insufficient world supplies.
Plan Your Meal
"To save food the housewife must
learn to plan economical and properly
balanced meals which, while nourish
ing each member of the family prop
erly, do net encourage over-eating or
offer excessive and wasteful , variety.
It is her duty to use all effective
methods to protect food from spoil
age by heat, dirt, mice or insects.
She must acquire the culinary ability
to utilize every bit of edible food that
comes into her home. She must learn
to use such foods as vegetables, beans
peas and milk products as partial
substitutes for meat She must make
it her business to see that nothing nu
tritious is thrown away or wasted.
National Waste
"Waste in any individual household
may seem insignificant, but if only a
single ounce of edible food, on the av
erage, is allowed to spoil or be
thrown away in each of our 20,000,000
homes, over 1.300,000 pounds of ma
terial would be wasted each day. It
takes the fruit of many acres and the
work of many people to raise, prepare
and distribute 464.000,000 pounds of
food a year. Every cunce of food
thrown away, therefore, tends also to
waste the labor of an army of busy
citizens.
Cherish Your Clothing
"Clothing is largely an agricultural
product and represents the results of
labor on the sheep ranges, in cotton
fields, and in mills and factories.
Whenever a useful garment is dis
carded needlessly, material needed to
keep some one warm or dry may be
consumed merely to gratify a passing
fancy. Women would do well to look
upon clothing at this time particular
ly from the utilitarian point of view.
Wear Your Old Shoes
"Leather, too, is scarce and the
proper shoeing of armies calls for
great supplies of this material. There
are only so many pairs of shoes in
each hide, and there is a shortage of
animals for leather as well as for
meat. Anything that can be done io
encourage adults or children to take
care cf their shoes and make them
last longer means more leather made
available for other purposes.
"Employed women, especially those
engaged in the manufacture of food
or clothing, also directly serve, their
country and should put into their
tasks the enthusiasm and the energy
the importance of their product de
serves. Honor Women at Front
"Over all honor Is due to the wom

Germany's Strength

Premier of France
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PARIS. May 5. Alexandre Ribot,
the French premier, in addressing to
day representatives of British, French
and Italian parliaments attending an
international congress gathered here
from countries representing liberal
ideas 8nd expressed hope the United
States, Russia, and other, entente al
lies soon would join in the manifes
tations of the allies' solidarity.
Referring to the war. he said:
"While the war is unfinished, it is
approaching its denouement. The en
emy still is struggling desperately
but we can feel his gradual exhaus
tion and discouragement. It is no
longer they, but we, who are attack
ing. "This famous Hindenburg line has
already been broken.
"More than 40,000 prisoners and
500 cannon taken in the last few
weeks attest the magnitude of our
success.
"After victory we shall call to our
aid not vengeance but justice alone."
FIRE DESTROYS
HIGK III
SHAFT HOUSE
Early Morning BIze, of Jn
I discovered Origin, Destroys
Thousands of Dollars Worth
of Mechanical Equipment
FIRE
Fire of undiscovered origin early
this morning completely destroyed
the shaft house, boiler room and the
change room at the. Higgins mine.
The fire was discovered about 12:40
a. m. and was still burning at three
o'clock. Thousands of dollars worth
of machinery was totally destroyed.
Owing to the lack of water pressure
and fire-fighting apparatus, the night
crew at the plant was able to do noth
ing but pour a feeble stream of water
on the burning walls and prevent
some of the machinery in the build
ing close to the walls from being com
pletely destroyed. The condition of
the road to the mine made it impos
sible for the city fire department to
get near the scene.
It was impossible to estimate the
loss this morning, but, as the walls
crashed in. it was seen that all of the
mechanical equipment in the building
was almost a complete loss. The
hoisting machinery, it is believed,
may be repaired, but the entire length
of cable was ruined. Miners on the
night shift were unaware of the fire
until they came off shift at 1:30
o'clock this morning and found the
chance room reduced to a mass of
smouldering ruins. The compressors
in nearby buildings, were not damag
ed by the fire, and no inconvenience
was caused to the men working un
derground. Little work has been done
in the main shaft for some time, op
erations being confined to the tunnel
in the property west of the shaft.

several subscriptions being re

The arproval of the new national

All persons within the age limits pre
scribed will be required to present
themselves for registration at t ie cus
tomary voting places in the voting
precincts in which they Lave tUeir

President will announce. The proba
bility is that from ten to fifteen days
will elapse between approval of the
bill and registration day.
Local Officials to Act
"The governor of each state will he
the chief of registration therein. Tl:e
machinery of registration in each
county is to be in charge of the sher
iff, the county clerk and the county
physician acting cx-otiieio, unless a

VIVIAN MARTIN AT
THE LYRIC TODAY
The World Film Corporation is pre
senting "The Little Mademoiselle" in
which Vivian Martaiu is starred and
which will be shown at the Lyric thea
tre today, presents a filmy story which
is typical of the winsome little film
star who plays the leading role of
"Lili Breval."
Lili is a young French miss, who
almost immediately upon her arrival
in this country finds herself suddenly
di'opped in the middle of a railroad
track watching the train on which her
uncle and aunt are riding speed away
in the distance, through no fault of
hers.
Lili speaks not a word of English
and has not a penny with her. To
make matters worse the first two Am
ericans who try to make her acquaint
ance are tramps. Lili decides she does
not care to know these gentlemen and
starts cross-lots t'o escape them. Her
fright lands her in a small New Eng
land village where the inhabitants are
as ignorant of French as the girl is
of English.
Lili arrives in the village just in
time to witness the end of a fight and
the winner, she finally learns, is the
one person in the town with whom
she can converse. Her young rescuer
however, is as bad off financially as
she, and the trials and tribulations ot
the young couple in their eft'jrts to
reach Boston and Lili's relatives, fur
nish the plot for a delightful blend
ing of pathos and humor which affords
Miss Martin a role in which she is
most admirable.
As it turns out Lili finds a hand
some American husband as well as a
rescuer.

Nazimova, Famous Russian
Actress, Plays Lead In Ex
traordinary Photoplay.
Herbert Bren'on's first production
since becoming a producer for Selz
nickmova as the star, and it will be
seen at the Orpheum theatre thi
week. The scenario is from Marion
Craig Wentworth'a play, in which Naz
imova scored her greatest success.
The story deals with the war brides
incidents which took place in ceriain
European countries at the outset ot
the present war, but the play deals
less with war than with the effects o!
war upon the l.'jnies and the loved ones
left behind. Mr. Lrenon, who is tht
only man beside D. W. Griffith who has
achieved a national reputation as a di
rector, says that this is unquestiona
bly an advance over any of his pre
vious work.
Under the sponsorship of Lewis J.
Selznick and director, Herbert Brenon
the eminent Russian tragedienne, Naz
imova, has made her debut in moving
pictures. Her first and only appear
ance this year will be. "War Brides,"
which will be shown at the Orpheum
theatre. When she had completed this
photo-drama. Nazimova resumed her
plans for her winter season on the
stage, so this will be the only oppor
tunity of seeing her in the movies for
at least a year.

,8I THE LIBERTY LOAN.
Not the least important part of the United States
Bisbee promises to go into one of the front ranks in
the matter of subscriptions to the Liberty Loan. The
appeal of the secretary of the treasury, William A.
McAdoo, has met with instant success here and, in time,
every person in the Warren District who has patriotism
and some money, will be, able to give documentary proof
of their interest in the great cause upon which the coun
try has embarked.
Local banks have been importuned by the secretary
of the treasury and have responded in kind. It is not
what amount of bonds will be taken here. Certain it is.
however, that the amount will not be small.
The people of the Warren District have now had nearly
two years of unexpected prosperity. If there is a man
or woman in the community who is 'broke' it is because
they have ignored the sign of the times and did not
lay something by for a time of need. There has been
money to spare in this camp for months. Many have
profited to a large extent by the nation's prosperity.
Others have merely saved. Now comes the1 time when
those savings may be of great service to the country.
It is a time of need. If money has been saved it is to
good purpose. Moreover, it is safe. - The Liberty Loan
can be looked upon from two angles, either one of -which
is sufficient cause to induce everyone to invest.
In the first place the country the United States of
America has embarked upon the sea of war. With the
example of the European nations behind us we are as
sured that our largest contribution will be of money. It
Is the need of the moment. Because we have no war on
American soil. It is no sign that the need for the maximum
of preparedness is not at hand. One item of that pre
paredness must be in the matter of dollars and cents.
America is overflowing with money. It is one of the
few things in the country of which there is a plenty
In large part the Liberty Loan will remain in this coun
try. It is merely a credit which the nation is extending
to itself and to its allies. The nation needs the money.
Without the nation our money is of no value. The pros
perity of the country, the very life of its people, is pre
dieted upon the success of our present undertaking
It is a patriotic act to buy a Liberty Bond.
In the second instance a Liberty Bond is one of the
best forms of investment obtainable. The credit of the
United States is unexcelled. There is no question about
the ability of the people of this country to shoulder the
burden. The bonds will return three and one half per
cent. They are free from taxation, except at the death
of the owner. They are better than the gold behind them.
There can be no reason why the Liberty Loan nor an;
other loan, which the United Slates may float, should
meet with anything but a spontaneous response.
Let Bisbee do its share!
MOTHER HUBBARD AND ESAU.
It was, as you will remember, bare. Mother Hubbard
probahly-.had gone the long route from soup to nuts with
six kinds of vegetables and seven kinds of bread, with
flesh, fowl, and good red herring, and the cupboard
couldn't support a dog.
Mother Hubbard alto is associated with a garment in
which very brave or lazy women accomodated the burden
of flesh they would have been happier and healthier
without.
There might have 'been more in the cupboard and less
on Mother Hubbard if she had eaten fewer potatoes and
less pastry, less meat fats and less sugar.
We'll be coming to the bare cupboard soon if we do
not trim down the family rationing, and if we do trim
down the rations there may be fewer persons going to
the physicians with bad kidneys and fewer persons avoid
ing the scales as the plague.
Esau's belly was his god and he lost bis inheritance.
We may do as Esau did and eat ourselves out of house
and home. Esau and Mother Hubbard are not safe
housekeepers for these times, not even in this rich natiou
which has not yet received the first blow to make it
flinch.?
The blow is coming and the work is coming. If we an?
defeated in our appetites and ruined by our bellies it will
be the sordidest fall of a republic known to history. T!i6
Roman empire came nearly eating itself to death. What
might be our disaster is not without precedent.
It would be unpleasant to think that a nation which
had Its real birth in starvation found its end in overeat
ing. From the handful of parched corn of the Puritan lo
the Lucullian feasts of a sybaritic republic dying in its
own fat would be a sad march for history to take.
We can eat ourselves to death. We can seat up the
subsistence which must be preserved to sustain the
muscles and courage of our allies and of our own fighting
men, when we get any. Some one is going to be starved
out In this war. Britain and Germany have their hands
on each other's gullets. The nation' that can keep the
dinner table supplied longest will win.
It is not a case of getting there fustiest with the most
est men, but a case of staying there longest with the
mostst pork chops and corn bread.
Part of this war will be won on American farms and in
American gardens. Another part will be won in Ameri
can kitchens. Kitchen fighting is open to almost every
one's volunteer efforts.
' We do not want to sell ourselves out as Esau did or
find ourselves in the fix of Mother Hubbard. Chicago

ANOTHER LINE PIERCED
"JOHNNY SUN FLOW ERSE ED."
Most of us have heard of "Johnny Appleseed." Few,
however, know who he was and what he did. He was a
kindly vagrant who, two or three generations ago, wan
dered about Ohio living on a diet consisting chiefly of
apples, and carefully planting the seeds.
Loving apples himself, he figured that he owed some
thing to posterity for every apple he enjoyed. He planteJ
seeds alongside the highways, and when there were no
roads he planted them beside paths and trails. How
many thousands since have profited, unknowing, from his
simple benefaction!
The Springfield (Mass.) Republican now proposes to
organize a volunteer army of modern Johnny Appleseed?,
as part of the present campaign for increasing the na
tion's food supply. But it isn't to be appleseeds now.
We haven't time to wait for apples. It's sunflowerseeds.
The1 sunflower is not only an attractive roadside orna
ment, but an extremely useful plant because of the value
of its seeds for poultry feed. A plentiful crop of sun
flowers would presumably increase and cheapen the
supply of poultry and eggs. So the Republican proposes
that the automobilists of the country shall conduct them
selves as itinerant Johnny Sunflowerseeds, carrying a
supply of the seeds with them and planting them along
the highway whenever they happen to stop for any
reason.
Once planted, the sunflowers will take care of them
selves. In the fall, it is expected, somebody who keeps
chickens will come along and gather the seed, and in
due time the automobilist's good deed will come back tr
him and his neighbors in the form of fresh eggs and
fried chicken. . ,
It sounds rather quixotic, to be sure. But isn't it a
kindly, wholesome, human thing to do? And automohil-
ists, who are mostly a kindly, generous lot, with a touch
of imagination, are just the sort of people to do it.
After repulsing German counter at
tacks from Fresnoy soutjaarj to the
southern corner 'jf the Hindenburg
line at Laon and farther eastward to
ward the Champagne district, the
British and French troops in France
are holding the majority of the posi
tions gained last week and are mak
ing some progress against desperate
resistance.
Some of the German attacks were
broken up by artillery and others were
driven off after hand to hand infantry
fighting. One tf the most violent Ger
man attacks was an assault on Cra
onne and the positions near it, taken
by the French on the previous day,
but the assault broke down with great
losses. Progress was made by the
French east of Mont Carnillet and by
the British north of Havincourt waad.
Bullecourt continues a center of
most intense battle with alternate ad
vance and retirement tin both sides.
South of that point the British have
bombed their way into German
trenches of the Hindenburg switch
toward Queant. This penetration is
regarded as of great tactical strength. J
Artillery fighting is intensive along
the Aisne front.
The outcome of the contradictory
situation in Russia where mobs have
denounced members "of the provisional
government, remains puzzling. Chief
developments in Petrograd Saturday
were the adoption by the Council of
Workmen's and Soldiers' delegates ot
a vote of confidence in the govern
ment and the forbidding of all meet
ings or armed demonstrations lor twe
days. The troops in . Petrograd were
ordered to remain in their barracks, i
Premier Lvoff and Foreign Secretary
Milukoff have declared that the gov
ernment will resign rather than recall
the note sent May Day to the entente
governments assuring them Russia
would prosecute the war vigorously.
The German chancellor will make
within a l'jrtnight a plainer declara
tion of Germany's peace conditions, (
according to an announcement by Dr.
Karl Helffrich, the German vice-chancellor.

THE LATEST FASHION.
The most amazing of fashions is now upon us. It is
fashionable to economize.
One of the countless organizations which have sprung
up in response to needs occasioned by the war, the Na
tional Special Aid Society, mentions there interesting
illustrations of the new style:
It is good form to dress plainly.'
It is good form to live frugally.
It is good form to give simple presents.
It is good form to plant vegetables instead of Cowers.
It is good form to avoid extravagance of every kind.
It is bad form to set an elaborate table.
It is bad form to wear jewelry in public.
It Is bad form to give costly presents or expensive
entertainments.
These items are enough to indicate the trend of th.)
style. Any man or woman may easily figure out further
applications.
It's all very sensible, considering that we're now a:
war, facing the prospects of enormous national expendi
tures that all of us will have to share in one "way or an
other, and the more serious prospect of actual scarcity of
food and other necessities of life. But that's the most
remarkable thing about it Who would ever have thought
it would be fashionable to be sensible?
MILWAUKEE'S CITY GARDEN.
The city of Milwaukee itself has gone into the war
garden business in a way that other cities might well
follow. City teams will be used in plowing vacant landi
donated for gardening. The city council has appropriated
$500 to be used in plowing and seeding these lands. The
plan is to sell the produce to the poor of the city at
cost.
The Milwaukee plan is a slight variation from most
of the garden movements in the country. And it sounds
like a wise one. It will not interfere at all with the gar
dens of individual citizens. But in every community
there are probably many people who are unable for one
reason or another to do gardcuing. And there are also
vacant lots that may go unworked in spite of the growing
enthusiasm for gardens. In Milwaukee those lots will he
taken care of. They will be worked scientifically ami
systematically. The results should be good.
Selling the products to the poor of tile city at cost It
an excellent part of the plan. The very Pr are apt to
be the ones who lark either time' or strength to make
garde us. They are also the ones who suffer most from
food, scarcity and high prices. The city gardens will be
a boon to them, and through them to the whole community.

LEGAL VICTORY ISV
AGAIN SCORED BY
COUNSEL FOR C. & A.
TOMBSTONE. May 5. Late .this
afternoon the jury returned a verdict
for $1,000 in favor of the plaintiff in
the case of Robert Balich vs. the Cal
umet & Arizona Mining Company.
Balich was suing for $15,000 for in
juries he claimed to have sustained
while working in the smelter of the
company, which injuries resulted In a
hernia.
The testimony showed that Balich
was engaged in the work of a convert
or puncher when the alleged accident
happened some time in April, 1916.
The company, while not admitting
liability, made an offer of settlement
to Balich and his attorney in an
amount considerably larger than the
verdict of $1,000 returned by the ju
ry. It is not known whether an appeal
will be taken to Supreme Court by
the company: Balich was represent
ed by Attorney Robert French of
Douglas, while the Calumet & Arizo
na Mining Company was represented
by Cleon T. Knapp, of Bisbee, and
James P. Boyle, of Douglas.

GREAT BUSINESS FOR
LENGTH OF WAR SAYS
NEW YORK VISITOR
J. E. Thompson, Former Resi
dent of Bisbee, Here on
Visit and Tells of Future
Possibilities. Guest A t
Luncheon.
That general business conditions,
throughout the United States, should
I be excellent during the great war and
that expert . opinion differed on the
same question, granting a declaration
of peace between the belligerent na
1 tions, is the opinion of J. E. Thomp-
; son, of New York. Mr. Thompson ar
j rived in Bisbee Friday night from
Douglas, with Mrs. Thompson and ton
1 and will remain here several days,
seeing old friends and getting better
acquainted with copper producing con
ditions in this region of the South
west Mr. Thompson is the head of the
banking and brokerage house of
Thompson, Sohnnard and Company 0
' Vow V1r i,n ri rf tf,A T ZJ a il ' ,1 rr Vnncaa
on the New York stock exchange. This
is the visitor's first trip to Bisbee since
he left, about eleven years ago.
Thirteen years ago J. K. Thompson
arrived in Bisbee from Clifton where
he had been located for aboit two
years. Once in thij city he conceived
the idea of a real estate promotion,
firmly believing that Bisbee would
grow. Accordingly, as he himselt
states, it with but little enthusiasm,
he promoted the Johnson Addition.
. As an exponent in advertising the
Warren District has never seen Mr.
Thompson's peer. He believed in dis
playing his wares; in telling the peo
ple about his proposition and, to that
end, his catch word, J. E. T.. s:on be
came a household word in this region
of the state. In the newspapers on
rocks, on poles on billboards a id in
fact on every available vacant spot,
his initials were painted.
The result was, Of course, success.
Thompson made money in Bisbee and
went to New York. He became asso
ciated in the brokerage business with
his brother and is now at the head of
the business and one of the leading
business men on Wall Street. He is
heavily interested in many Arizona
copper properties and deals exten
sively in those securities for his
clients in the east.
Mr. Thompson has been a keen stu
dent of affairs in Arizona. He has
never forgotten the state and its as
sociations. Its politics, its industrial
progress and its latent resources have
given him much cause for study.
'I am mighty. . glad,", said Mr.
Thompson yesterday, "That the people
of the state of Arizona have decides
to have a portion of sanity in theii
government of tiae state.
"Money has no sentiment, whatever.
Accordingly, conditions must be pro
pitious in order to induce capital to
enter the state. Arizona has enjoyed
a wonderful era of prosperity during
the last two years every copper pro
ducing region has enjoyed the same
prosperity. The most adverse condi
tions would not have retarded pros
perity which we have witnessed here
of late.
"What Arizona needs, however, is
railroad capital and other money witii
which to develop other resources than
mining. When capital investigates
Arizona, with that end in view, it has
run up against adverse political con
ditions and nothing has been done, a.
a consequence. I am sincerely hoping
that present conditions will continue
and that Arizona may see much pro
gress in the next few years."
Thompson Tendered Luncheon
Yesterday Mr. Thompson was given
a luncheon by Jesse Yoakum, one' ot
his oldest friends in the statae of Ari
zona, at the Copper Queen hotel. Nine
teen men sat down to the table.
They were: J. E. Thompson, V. H.

PLANT A GARDEN IS
ADVICE OF MINISTER
The Rev. Charles W. Harshman of
fers the following suggestions as to
how residents of the Warren District
can help rrevent a food shortage:
"Unless the United States makes an
extraordinary effort to increase its
food supply, the world will be hungry
next year.
"Some crops were short last year.
It is estimated that the winter wheat
crop this year will be 50,000,000 bush
els short in the United States. 125,
000.001) million bushels short in
France and 250.00,000 in other allied
countries.

Anne Therses Devault read "Polly of
the Circus," in a most convincing man
ner that aroused genuine enthusiasm
of a high degree in Loth the children
and older peaple of her audience. The
story of "Polly" is cne of heart warm

by all the "kiddies" a general romp
and many dances all around the big
tent. This exceptional young woman
has brought, during the pa3t week
much happiness to the young people
as they testified by show of great
loathing at the tiiought of her depar
ture. The superb baritone, James God
dard offered a concert in the evening
of varied selections from different
operas that will remain for many a
day as an exceedingly happy memory
in the hearts of all who were able to
hear him. Mr. Goddard's voice is of
wonderful, deep, sonorous, resonance
that registers the utmost in vocal and
histronic art. Robert Yale Smith and
Ruth Ray, the two artists who assist

W. H. Brophy was agreeably sur

Frank, who came to Bisbee to spend
several days from Catifonra. . Frank
Brophy has. but recently, left New
Haven for San Francisco and will re

Typical of the Arizona product,
Frank Brophy, who was concluding his
collegiate training at Yale this year,
became impatient at the manner In
which the students applications for
admittance into the training camps
were handled. Accordingly, he secured
the applications of about twenty men,
who desired to do their work at the
Presidio, and took the train for San
Francisco. v
There he was able to see the officer
in charge and to take the matter of
the applications directly up with him
and success attended his efforts.
Frank Brophy served with the Yale
battery last year in Pennsylvania for
several months and will not be a re
cruit at the big training camp when
it meets. He will remain here, visit

DYNAMITE THROWN
OUT WITH RUBBISH
CAUSES NEAR PANIC
Dynamite!
That is the word that spread rapid
ly over the neighborhood of the old
opera house yesterday afternoon and
almost caused a panic.
The excitement started when a re
port was circulated that a laborer
had discovered a cache of dynamite
in back of the old opera house while
digging a ditch. A call was sent for
pclice, and Officer Leon H. Rice,
chief explosive expert of the depart
ment, made a record-breaking dash
to the scene. Instead of finding a box
of bombs with sputtering fuses, as he
had anticipated. Rice found only
about half a dozen sticks of dynamite
which had been thrown away with
some rubbish.
Rice put the explosive in a sack
and hailed a passing "jitney." When
half way back to the station he warn
ed the driver to be careful, advising
him of the dynamite in the sack. The
driver became so nervous when he

GUILTY OF
11
Slayer of Colonel Butler Is
Sentenced To Five Years
Imprisonment New Trial
Or Appeal To Be Brought
(By Review Leased Wire).
COLEMAN, Tex., May 5. A ver
dict of guilty of murder was returned
tonicht by the Jury in the case of Har
ry J. Spannell, chcrged with the kill
ing of Lieut Colonel M. C. Butler,
and punishment was fixed at five
years imprisonment.
Spannell almost collapsed when the
verdict was read. Counsel for the de-1
fense announced a motion for a new i
trial would be filed immediately and
if not granted, an appeal would be ;
taken. The plea for reversal, they i
said, would be based specifically up- i
on the refusal of the court to sustain !
the defense's plea of "former acquit- i
tal."
Spannell was indicted for killing;
his wife and Lieut Colonel Butler at !
Alpine, July 20, 1916. The charge of '
killing his wife, Mrs. Crystal Holland
Spannell. was tried at San Angelo
last February on a change of venue.
Spannel was acquitted and the case
against him for killing Butler was
brought to Coleman county. The tri
al began Monday, April 23.
Testifying in his own behalf, Span
nell said Butler showed undue atten
tion to Mrs. Spannell, despite several
warnings and promises to cease these
attentions. On the evening of the
double shooting, Spannell testified.
Butler insulted MVs. Spannell in a
bath room of the Hotel at Alpine. He
tcok Butler into an automobile with
his wife and after a short trip de
manded an explanation. In the en
suing altercation several shots were
fired by both Butler and Spannell.
The shot that killed his wife, Span
nell declared, was fired by Butler.
Spannell declared be fired in self
defense, Butler being the aggressor.

(By Review Leased Wire).
NEW YORK, May 5, The A. B. F.
B. Permanent Blind Relief War Fund
for Soldiers and Sailors is the first
organization of the kind to receive
the distinguished patronage of the
President of the United States who
has Just consented to head the Amer
ican Section of the Fund. Governor
Whitman and Mayor Mitchell . have
consented to serve In the capacity of
Honorary Vice Presidents.
The finance committee of the fund
consists of Messrs. Otto H. Kahn,
George A. Kessler, Edmund L. Bay
lies ajid Frank A. Vanderlip and they
recently cabled the French Commit
tee a guarantee of 200,000 francs an
nually for the next five years and ex
pressed the hope that the fund might
be able to increase the annual allow
ance and to extend the guarantee for
an additional five or ten years.
Writing to Mr. George A. Kessler,
chairman of the American committee.
M. Eugene Brieux, president of the
French committee, says:
"I have just received your cable and
it gives me much pleasure to note the
decisions of the American committee.
I am delighted at the idea that you
will soon come to France for I am
convinced that we will understand
each other very will and we shall rap
idly start the good work.- I shall do
my utmost to realize as soon as pos
sible all the good for our blind which
you have made possible by your ini
tiative and by American generosity. I
have been much touched by the sacri
fice you have made In putting at our
disposal your house in the Avenue
Raphael. We are now preparing to
install ourselves there. I ask your
secretary to profit by his Easter vaca
tion to go and see a soldier who is
particularly worthy of our interest.
He is blind, both fore arms amputat
ed; he is married and has three chil
dren. He lives near Bordeaux in a
little village where the family has a
house which has great need of repairs
We are going to repair it and buy for
this family a cow or two which will
permit them to live. We will keep
you au courant."
Recently fifty thousand dollars
were sent to St. Dunstan's. Sir Arthur
Pearson, the blind publisher and chair
man of the British committee of the
fund writes:
"This is to acknowledge with grate
ful thanks the most generous gift or
the Permanent Blind Relief War
Fund of L10.000 for which receipt is
enclosed. .This money will be devot
ed to the very important work of the
after-care of the blinded soldier.
em very happy indeed tc be able to
tell your executive committee that the
men who have been trained at St
Dunstan's and have been settled in
their own homes, are, practically
without exception, happily and suc
cessfully at work. But this state of
pffairs fs mainly dependent upon the
adequacy of the after-care system.
Inscribed in the enclosed particulars
The L10.000 which we are adding to
our permanent fund for ibis purpose,
will be of most satisfactory assist
ance, and will enable us to place this
work upon a more satisfactory basis
tban would otherwise have been pos
sible." Appreciative letters have been re
ceived by the fund's honorary secre
taries, Mrs. George A. Kessler and
Mrs. R. Valentine Webster from ma
ny eminent men of England and from
France, among them the Rt. Hon. Dav
id Lloyd-George, The Lord Mayor of
London. ThP Rt Hon. Arthur J. Bal
Tour. The Rt. Hon. Reginald McKen
na. M. Poul Cambon, the French min
ister to Great Britain, the Grand Rab
bi of France, and others.
The Hon. Arthur James Balfour
writes: "I beg to send you one line
in acknowledgement of your letter of
the 15th anil its enclosures. I need
not say that I learn cf the contribu
tion you mention with the utmost sat
isfaction, and beg to congratulate all
those who have been responsible for
so successful an effort."
The Lord Mayor of Londou writes:
"I gather that from your fund, the
splendidly generous contribution of
J50.000 has been voted to the work
for Blind Soldiers and Sailors con
ducted by Sir Arthur Pearson at St.
Dunstan's. I feel sure that this gen
erous munificence will be gratefully
appreciated by all classes of my fol
low citizens who will observe- with
sjmpathetic pleasure the steps which
American friends are taking to alle
viate the 'miseries associated with
the war."
Sir Edward H. Holden. chairman
of the London City and Midland Bank
and honorary treasurer of the fund
in England writes: "I have read
with great pleasure the copy of the
Minti'es of your general meeting of
March 2nd. from which I note that
the mastiinceiit sum of $.".0.oi0 was
voted to Sir Arthur Pearson for his
work at St. Dunstan's. This, togeth
er with the remittance of francs, 750,
(io already made to M. Pallain. gov
ernor of the Bank of France, is in
deed a wonderful achievement."

TUCSON. May 5. Relics which tend
to prove the theory that the ancient
Hopi Indian tribe of Awatobi and
SityakI in northern Arizona, were
closely related to the pueblo dwellers
of the Salt River and Casa Grande
valleys; have been added to the his

Setting Stiff Pace
In Efficiency Game
All of The Producing Mines In The State of Arizona Are
Rushing Production To a Remarkable Point This Great
State, During The Present Year, Promises To Better The
Record Established Last Year In The Number of Pounds
of Copper Mined. ,
New Properties Entering The Producing List At a Rapid Rate.
Mining And Milling Methods Are Bettering Each Month.
Entry of New Cornelia Promises To Raise Amount of
Copper To a Great Degree. Industry Is Flourishing Be
yond Fondest Hope.
With conservation and higher efficiency the dominating cry of the hour,
the world over, the copper mining organizations of Arizona are setting a pace
that is being equaled in no other industry in the country. At the aame time
the copper producers of the state are of their own volition paying the largest
increase In wages to their employees that has come about in any industry in
the country. Atop of this they are getting the highest results In Increase
In conservation of values and In gain in output of product that is being at
tained in any industry.
GREAT METAL OUTPUT GIVES PROOF.
In proof of these statements, the Arizona Chapter of the A. M. C. in a
current report points to the fact that Arizona copper output has nearly doubled
since 1914. with but one important new producer of the metal added since that
time, albeit it is a big one. Inspiration with its 12,000,000 pounds the month
at the present period. The rest of the gain has been made by producers with
established mines prior to 1914, United Verde Extension and Magma, with
about 6,000,000 pounds the month excepted.
MILLIONS SPENT FOR EFFICIENCY.
These producers have accomplished their gain through the expenditure
of upwards of $20,000,000 in new construction and equipment work. They are
still busy with expenditures for bettermentB and expansion steps. One
property alone will spend 1750,000 this year in completing steps which it has
underway. Reference is made to Miami Copper. Of course, Miami will earn
this money back quickly, is earning it back now as installation goes on, the in
genuity of the management providing for the remodeling work without in
terrupting the operation of the plant as established. But every day they are
just the same getting a little additional gain In efficiency and earning by
reason of the new equipment they are installing.
OTHER MILLIONS IN NEW PLANTS.
Beside large sums which are being expended this year on new construc
tion and equipment by the established producers with operating mines, mills
and smelters, including Ray, Miami, Copper Queen, C. & A United Verde
and others, with these millions being earned back almost as rapidly as put
In and turned Into larger employment of labor and the payment of dividends
to thousands of people in Arizona and other thousands all over the country.
there are other millions going into the plants of mines which are erecting
works for the treatment of their own ores, to the end of large contsructlon
of values and greater earnings. United Verde Extension leads in this list with
expenditure of probable upwards of $3,000,000 now begun for the erection of its
own smelter. Ray Hercules has several hundred thousand dollars worth of
mill equipment ordered for the treatment of ore resources which it has de
veloped and is adding to with further exploration. This Is all aside from mil
lions of dollars being expended in new plant equipment in the smaller copper,
gold and lead-silver districts and in the putting up of operating plants on
many developing properties, a total investment reaching astonishing propor
tions and very rapidly distributed in labor, tax and trade channels. Its con
templation quickly explains the great prosperity which abounds everywhere In
Arizona and which is unprecedented in its annals to any such general extent
as now prevails. The cotton acreage brought in during the last few years
and some gain in the agricultural area helps, but these factors are negligible
in looking the state over as a whole in comparison with the enormous gain
that metal mnling has brought about and which in fact has made the neces
sary money available for the development of the lands of the state. To such
money the mining industry is adding constantly and without stint Those
who would farm can get money in plenty from the mining community banks,
which have always loaned freely of their funds to the farmers, even when
the latter could not get money from their own banks. Nor have the banks
of the mining centers ever lost money on their farm loans.
VAST STRIDES MADE AND MAKING.
The management of the big copper producing mines of Arizona have made
wonderful advance in both the mining and metallurgical divisions in the last
several years, and they are still at It It may be that they will not accomp
lish as much in the next year or two as they hare since 1914, but they are
nevertheless going to accomplish a great deal. That much is now assured.
In the laboratory of no single producer operating reduction plants in the state
is there idleness. From top to bottom the staffs of these organizations are
striving for more efficiency, more recovery of values, the utilization of more
material. All of them are succeeding; all are bringing forward new ideas,
new applications which are receiving test In practice. Copper Queen, C. &
A., Shannon, Ray, Arizona Copper, Detroit Copper, Old Dominion. Miami,
Arizona Commercial, Magma, United Verde and of course United Verde Ex
tension, are all at It
A WONDERFUL PLANT.
Even Inspiration is busy, althought it has today mine and mill equipment
and operating methods which are conceded to be the very height of scientific
and mechanical attainment to this time. The mine is daily sending more than

While no end of interest is being
manifested Just now In the activities
at the properties of the United States
Vanadium Development company, near
Kelvin, and reports of finds of rich
ore are being received almost daily,
attention is being directed to the
various uses of vanadium, it has been
generally understood that vanadium
finds general usage in the making of
armor plate, automobile and machin
ery wearing parts and other purposes
where particularly hard steel is re
quired. In this connection the following arti
cle from tiie Mining and Scientific
Press, under the heading, "Vanadium
for Aeroplanes," is of especial inter
est: "Vanadium has been in great de
mand since the outbreak of the war
for steel parts of aeroplanes, sub
marines, and in armour plate for war
ships and armored motor truck. Light
machine guns and aerial artillery are
almost wholly constructed of vana

essential to reduce weight witnout
sacrifice of strength, and especiallv
where great resistance of shock is re
quired, this alloy is employed. The
growth of the vanadium industry has
been phenomenal. In 1905 only 1000
fjns of vanadium steel was produced.
This was used for high speed tool
steel. The present consumption of

For Silver And Gold Value
To Show Copper At Depth
Again Confirmed.
(By William P. De Wold)
PRESCOTT. Ariz.. May 5. An in
teresting phase of the vivified mining
activity everywhere arrarent through
out Yavapai county is the tendency
of the ores in mines hitherto recog
nized as precious metal producers
solely, to at depth change their min
eral contents from silver and gold to
copper. This metmorphose opens a
vista of copper ore yielding possibili

mining men that the ores of Yavapai

says: "I was bothered with eye strain
caused by overworked, tired eye3 which
induced fierce headaches. I have worn
glasses for several years, both for dis
tance and work, and without them I
could not read my own name on an
envelope or the typewriting oa the
machine before me. 1 can do both now,
and have discarded my long- distance
glasses altogether. I can count the
fluttering leaves on the trees across the
street now, which for several years
have looked like a dim green blur to
me. I cannot express my joy at what
it has done for me."
It is believed that thousands who
wear glasses can now discard them in
a reasonable time, and multitudes more
will be able to strengthen their eyfs
so as to be spared the trouble and ex
pense of ever getting glasses.

We cannot all go to war. We are not all the right age limit and with the rugged
physical standards demanded of the warrior, yet we can all do a service by engaging in
the production of a national, international life necessity in the production of more OIL.
The consumption of oil is 200,000 barrels per day more than the production and
unless more oil is produced in the immediate future we will have a United States Oil Dic
tator. The auto owners and other consumers would be told by their government how
many gallons per day or per week or per month they might consume. Last week
Roosevelt advocated the limitation on the consumption of gasoline.

that the pay copper ore bodies of Ya

in the Binghampton. The following

feet of ore that sampled an average
of 6 percent copper per ton. Further

posit is or not a continuation of No.
102 ore body from which, at other
points, ore is being regularly mined,
and sent to mill, is problematical.
Mineralogical evidences bear out,
however, the theory of General Man
ager Johnson and Superintendent Tul
loch that it is separate and distinct
from any other deposit opened in the
mine. The crosscut west in this de
posit shows 3 feet of 3.20 percent cop
per ore. The breast of each of the
three openings is filled with chalco
pyrite and gray copper. Taken in
connection with the fact that p?v ore
is opened elsewhere in the mine fro.n
the 100-foot level to a depth of 600
feet, the recent discoveries may be
accepted as proof positive of the pres
ent and future worth of the Arizona

Binghampton estate.
New F'nd on the 6th Level
On the 600-foot level the drive
south has exposed 11 feet of 4.16 per
cent copper ore similar in character
to No. 91 deposit. The latter shows
pay ore In tonnage from the 6th level
to approximately 40 feet above the
100-foot level, but is not being drawn
upon for mill tonnape at this time.
Such ore extracted from it as has
been milled gave a return at the head
of 3. percent copper. It is the plan of
the management to hold So. 91 ore
body in reserve until such time as the
company's mill has been increased to
300 tons capacity, and to supply its
present milling demarrtl from No. 102
ore body. The lattr is opened on the
various levels to a depth cf 600 feet.
The steps on the 200-foot level in
No. 101 ore body shows 10 feet of pay
rock with neither wall in sight. At
present the stope has a perpendicular
length of 25 feet Superintendent
Tulioch reports the ore to carry from
6 to 8 percent copper per ton. All of
the ore now going to mill, save that
being broken in the stope in No. 101
deposit, is mined during the ordinary
course of eacli day's work. , Whicr
means that while the mine Is beinr.
prospected and opened it is supplying
the company's mill with 100 tons of
lore per day.
j Murphy O. K's Property
t James S. Murphy, of Cripple Creek,
Co'orado. who superintended the sink-
in? of the shaft to its present depth
of 600 feet, and the development work
I on the various levels prior to installa-
tion of the company's flotation 'mill,
i and who inspected the nine in late
April, states that the result cf recent
! development work proves the mine
! and assures its future. He pronounc
j es the showing to be one of the most
promising he has viewed during his
many years experience as a mine sup
i erintendent and mine operator.
I During the month of April the com
I pany shipped 500 tons of concentrates

i centrates had an average copper con-
I tent of 22 per cent and a copper con
j tent range from 20 to '24 per cent,
j Big Reef Developments
At the property of the Big Reef
I Copper company, located on the same
j mineralized belf as the Copper Lode
i and Arizona Binghampton estates,
j two shifts of miners are employed in
sinking the main shaft. As depth is
! gained copper indications are becom
i ing more pronounced :and are in gen
eral of a character which confirms the
i favorable report submitted to the di
j rertoratfl by Mr. J. II. Shockloy, an
: engineer of acknowledged standing.
! The shaft is being equipped with a
I 40-acre power gas hoist. 600 feet of
i cable, buckets, etc; a 10x10 compres
: sor and three air-drills. The mine
! machinery and gallows-frame are prac
tically in place and within a few days
will aid materially in the work of
gaining depth in the shaft. A black
smith shop equipped with a complete
lin of tools has been erected, and the
work of erecting the .necessary build
ings for housing the miners is well
advanced.
The property carries a continuous
outrrip of copper-bearing schists for
a distance of more than 25f0 feet
which in places shows a breadth of
150 feet. The oxidized copper ores
azurite. malachite, chryscolla and cu
prite impregnate the schists in vein
lets and disseminations, accompanied
with considerable ralcite, and iron ox
! ide. The ore Is not a continuous vein
on the surface, but for the distance of
2500 feet before mentioned, a series
of twenty or more pits, cuts and
i shafts have exposed a most encourag-
ing copper showing. The manage
j ment is therefore of the belief that
i commercial copper ore in large ton
' nape will be found at the underlying
I water levels. This conclusion is sub
stantiated by similar surface show
jng on neighboring mines where d
velotmient at depth has disclosed bod
ies of pay copper ore.

handling, of low grade ores Is the niOi'.
interesting and important phase of re
cent and present work in the state,
and it Is to be said that in this It is
leading all others, as it is in tonnage of
copper production. At Clifton the
Shannon management has . accomp
lished very much of general benefit In
finding the way to successfully treat
tailings with copper content of around
1 per cent. At Ray, the Ray Consoli
dated management Is bringing to com
pletion the working out of intrica,e
problems which it has had to solve,
and which have compelled the em
ployment of much time, patience and
deep study, for all of which there is
ample reward near at hand for every
body concerned. At Miami there - Is
being brought to final proof some very
highly important endeavor which will
result in general benefits in associa
tion with the treatment of ores of pe
culiar character but common occur
rence, and which will make a one
per cent grade available as a profit
able commodity, of this one per cent
there are large quantities awaiting
treatment in not only that district but
In others. Miami Copper and Inter
national smelter managements are
both engaged on problems somewhat
akin in this respect. At Ajo the prob
lems which. New Cornelia has solved
and will shortly give proof of in the
output of copper from its new plant 3
will have wide reaching influence and
benefit. At Chloride there have been
important gains in the handling of
zic. It is to be added that acids are
playing bigger part than ever in tho
recovery of values from Arizona ores
and are destined to come into f;ir
greater prominence. At Douglas the
C. & A. has tarried its sulphuric acid
plant construction and operation to
highly successful issue, opening a new
line of conservation in the state, while
in both the C. & A. and Coppen Queen
smelting plants at Douglas there has
been much accomplished in Improved
practice, with further important steps
underway. Jerome smelting practices
have likewise received much benefit
from the application by United Verde
management of excellently directed
endeavors.
All of which culminates in simply
this: Plants which five years ago
were considered the highest in at

GREEN MONSTER IS .
NOW SINKING ON A
BIG COPPER SHOWING
Hopes of Director Centered
In Gorge Tunnel; Shaft In
Schist Is Averaging One
And One-Half Per Cent
Copper.
JEROME, May 5. Little Is heard
from the Green Monster these days,
as the directors have adopted a pol
icy of reticence. They admit, how
ever; that they hope before long to
be able to make a positive statement
that will startle the district. Mining
men who have visited the property In
the last few weeks are more strongly
impressed than ever with its possibil
ities. The hopes of the Green Monster
people are now centered In the Gorge
tunnel, on the Cliff claim. It Is there
that the principal work Is now going
for-ar. Work is being continued on
the Revenue claim, where the showing
is also hisrhly encouraging,1" but it is
now b-Iieved that the first Green
j Mont-tor production will be from the
j emerge.
I Two shifts are cutting a station in
he Gorge tunnel, preparatory to the
r'rting of a shaft. Above that point
I a hole, 4x6 feet in size, is being sunk
to provide ventilation. This hole must
be driven about 250 feet to reach the
station, tl Is now down about 60
feet.
Nothing will be hoisted through the
hole, of course. The waste and ore
from the shaft will be hoisted to the
tunnel station and trammed out to
the dump.
The tunnel has passed through 70
feet of schist, shot through with chal

STUDYING PROPERTY
H. F. Widdecombe, Connect
ed With The Lewissohn Or

JEROME, May 5. The Calumet &
Jerome now has a resident engineer,
H. F. Widdeccmbe of Salt Lake, who
is connected with the Lewissohn or
ganization. He arrived Monday night
and will be on the ground permanent
ly. He is now engaged in making a.
complete geological map of the prop
erty. This does not presage any change
in the plan of development or opera
tion. Engineer Widdecombe will sim
ply be on the ground all the time to
give the superintendent and company
officers the benefit of his advice.
Benjamin Gillies, another Lewir
sohn engineer, has been making fre
quent examinations of the Calumet
ever since the Lewissohn and Charls
M. Schwab became interested in that
property. His visits will continue. In
his latest report Engineer Gillies
stated:
"The engineers concur in the opin
ion that the property contains ?11 the
formations and showings indicative of
the presence of the large ore bodies
which have been frequently men
tioned. They also agree that it will
not be necessary to sink the three
compartment shaft below the 500-foot
level, where the Yavapai schist forma
tion will probably be found. This
formation has been the ore contain
ing ground of the United Verde and
the United Verde Extension. The
engineers have advised the immedi
ate crosscutting from the present level
(about 400 feet) also crosscutting at
the 400-foot and 500-foot levels. This
development should be sufficient to
thoroughly open the property up. and
any further development at depth can
be made in the future- after the pro
duction stage has been reached.

SSalO WiO
IN THE MILLION DOLLAR CIRCLE' OF AMERICA'S GREATEST
COPPER DISTRICT.
We make the unqualified assertion that there is no undeveloped
mining property in the Jerome District now being offered to the pub
lic, which will compare with the MICHIGAN-VERDE in its relative
location to the big mines of that district.
The MICHIGAN-VERDE today stands supreme as the most pro
mising, the most logical, the closest-in undeveloped property in the
Jerome District. .
It lies about a stone's threw from the famous United Verde
"Glory Hole," from which Senator Clark has taken millions and mil
lions of dollars worth. of gold, silver, and copper ore.
It lies just across the hill from where the United Verde is now pre
paring to use steam shovels with which to take out the enormous ore
deposits.
It was selected by the Western Copper Syndicate for financing,
out of more than forty that were offered and investigated selected
because of its location, because cf the formation and because the geo
logist who reported on the property stated that the great ere bodies
of the United Verde and the United Verde Extension DIP TOWARD
THE PROPERTY OF THE MICHIGAN VERDE.
Is it not common sense to believe that when a man is working
underground in a mine, he should know what trend the ore body on
which he is working takes? The underground workings of the United
Verde extend into the hill toward the Michigan-Verde property, and
men working in these northwest stcpes of the United Verde, state, most
positvely that the ore is headed tcward the Michigan-Verde. Unless
Mother Nature built some kind of a wall in this hilt to stop the ore,
what can keep it from extending on into the MICHIGAN-VERDE?
If these same miners working in the United Verde stopes did not
have confidence in their own ability to judge where the ore was go
ing, WHY DID THEY BUY STOCK IN THE MICHIGAN-VERDE COP
PER COMPANY? Ninety per cent of the MICHiGAN-VERDE stock
that has been sold to date was bought by Jerome miners men who
KNOW what ttiey are doing when they back their judgment of a min
ing property with their money, it wasn't necessary to sell stock to
these men when it was offered fcr sale they came and BOUGHT.it
and they bought it when the MICHIGAN-VERDE COPPER COM
PANY controlled only little more than HALF the property they now
OWN OUTRIGHT. . .
NOTE THE MICHiGAN-VERDE IN THE CREAM OF THE
DISTRICT.
Stock in the MICHIGAN-VERDE is being offered strictly on its
merits, as the best buy in Arizona as a logical, conservative invest
ment that promises rich returns.
The company has a small capitalization, when you consider the
holdings of 535 acres. OWNED OUTRIGHT. But two million shares
with a par value of 50 cents. It is worthy of note that SIXTY PER
CENT CF THIS STOCK IS IN THE TREASURY for development pur
poses, instead of the usual fifty per cent, and it is worthy of your most
earnest consideration that absolutely NO PROMOTION STOCK OR
POOL RIGHTS ARE BEING OFFERED FOR SALE AT ANY PRICE.
The men behind the MICHIGAN-VERDE mustmake their money by
DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION.
With its low capitalization, and with the clean, straightforward
manner in which the preposition is being handled, MICHIGAN
VERDE has probabilities of from $50.00 to $100.00 per share, with de
velopment. Frankly, we can see no reason why MICHIGAN-VERDE
should not make as great profits as have been' made by those who
invested in United Verde Extension, when it was selling at a low price,
and we believe that right today, MICHIGAN-VERDE is a more logical
buy than United Verde Extension EVER WAS, before they struck ore.
It isn't going to take long to finance this property the stock is
growing in popularity every day and once development is started It
will not be possible to buy MICHIGAN-VERDE for less than $1.00
per share. We believe every practical mining man in Arizona wi!l
agree with us that at the present price of 35 cents, it is selling for
less than it is actually worth on LOCATION ALONE. -
THE PRICE OF MICHIGAN-VERDE STOCK WILL POSITIVELY
BE RAISED TO FIFTY CENTS PER SHARE DURING THE CUR
RENT MONTH. The 35-cent allotment is limited and you should place
your order TODAY before the rise which will certainly come.

Review Want Ads Bring Results
(By Review Leased Wire).
JEROME, May 5. Everything that
has come out this week in regard to
the Jerome Verde strike tends to
show that it is the real thing and fiat
the Jerome Verde will be the third
big mine of the camp.
Samples of the drill cuts seen in
Jerome show that the drill passeu
through the glance horizontally.
Therefore the ore shoot is two fe?t
and a half wide.
Assays show that the ore runs all
the way from 26 to 32 per cent cop
per. The story that one assay ran as
high as 40 per cent cannot be confirmed.
! When the d-M Mt the ore it wa-
! in 420 feet. It had passed throug'i
1S5 feet of quartz. The ore is in a
ledge of porphyry about 25 feet wide.
Quartz was entered again on the other
side.
I Drill To Be !ovcd.
This drill hole is being continued.
! As the capacity of the drill is only
700 feet, the drill will probably b"
moved in a few days.
From all that can be learned, an
other flat hele will be drilled from
the same crosscut to intersect the ore
at a point about 100 feet north of the
first strike. If it can be proven that
the ore extends for 100 feet it will
have been demonstrated beyond the
shadow of a doubt that Jerome Verde
is a mine.
It will take about 30 days to drill
the proposed hole. Then a hole w:!l
be driven on an angle half way be
tween the two, to determine if the
ore goes down.
Little doubt is felt here that both
tJ-ese holes will crosscut the same ore
body. It is generally believed that
the Jerome Verde has the north con
tinuation of the United Verde Exten
sion ore body. :
New Shaft Planned. . ' .
It is probable that before any ore
is extracted, the Jerome Verde' will
hare to sink another shait near the
foot of the hill under which the strike
was made. It will have to be as deep
as the U. WExtension's Edith shaft.
What is commonly spoken of as
the 1400-foot level of the Extension
is really the 1200-foot level of the
Edith shaft, for the Extension peopl"
count from the collar of the old Daisy
shaft, 200 feet above.
The Jerome Verde drill is operating
from a crosscut driven into Jerome
ground from the 1400-foot level, which
is actually only 1200 feet from the
surface.
Even if the crosscut is driven over
to the ore, there will be no way of
getting the ore to the surface except
through the Edith shaft. The Edith
is now loaded to full capacity and an
other hoisting shaft is being sunk by
the Extension only a few feet to the
east. That second shaft will not be in
use before November. It has been
suggested that the Jerome Verde
might wait until that time and then
make arrangements with the Exten
sion or the hoisting fcf its ore t!irousi
one of its shafts.
Strike Is Possible.
Another suggestion is that the Jer
ome Verde might give the Extension
permission to run a crosscut over
from the south end of its ore body to
j the Columbia shaft and hoist through
I that in return for permission to use
: the Edith. These, however, are mere-
ly suggestions from outsiders. It is
I possible that a strike will be made i"
i the crosscut east from The Columbia.
started this week, and the Jerome
j Verde company will itself need the
I Columbia for hoisting,
j The station was practically com
j pleted Wednesday and the first round
. of shots fired in the crosscut that
j night. In a day or two three shifts
I will be working in the crosscut, which
I is being driven eastward to intersect
the "great dike of magnetic iron cut
by the shaft at 960 feet.
Stock Issue Planned.
It is apparent that the Jerome Ver
de company is taking extraordinary
precautions to prevent information
about the strike becoming public.
This secretive attitude of the com
pany, together with the fact that a
special stockholders' meeting is to b?
held in Phoenix May 17 for the pur
pose of considering increasing! the
capitalization from $5,000,000 to $5,
500.000, is keeping down the price of
Jerome Verde shares.
Though 500.000 shares are to be
added to the company's capitaliza
tion, if the present plan is carried out.
the officers' expect to sell only enough
to raise $100,000. Their tentative
plan, it is understood on good au
thority, is to pro-rate the 50.000 shares
among the stockholders at $2. But
the pro-rating is to be among stock
holders of record April 2. Hundreds
of persons who were holding Jerome
Verde certificates on that date but
had not had them transferred, and
those who have bought certificates
since, vill not participate.
Eftorts are being made by local
stockholders, tluough the bauks, to
have tUis bitualiuu remedied. 1

Once again the district around Hay
den is booming. Recently a nugget
valued at $3,000 was discovered on
one tf the properties there and that,
together with recent developments of
war conditions, has caused considera
ble attention to be attracted that way,
resulting in the reopening of a num
ber of mines that heretofore have
temporarily been closed, and the stim
ulating of present workings.
Since the increase in consumption
of copper and other metals which are
so necessary in carrying on the great
European struggle, all eyes have been
turned on Arltona, and large eastern

and investing heavily in this state,
with the result that among other

)eople had gathered, and a couple of
ough-coated motorcar stood wuit

lats; and from one of the motorcars

thought was dispelled by a smile and
laugh of joyful recognition.
"Rodman Pillsbury!" she exclaimed
and gave him both her hands.
He took them awkwardly, shaking a

"I donf know you at all, rat," he
mid. "I was waiting for a little girl
a freckled, long-legged tomboy who

'most every way. And here you're

"Yon needn't," she told him gayly.
'You've grown up every whit as much

Swiftly she made Pillsbury known

answered.

party for the hacienda, had spurred

s he felt secure from observation, ar
rived in the early evening at a strag
gling row of adobe huts which figured
as the nearest Mexican village.
Twilight was still bright when he
Jropped from bis fagged animal and
sought one of the dwellings which
wore a slightly less unkempt appear
ance than its fellows.
In the doorway of this hut, some
what contemptuously watching the
evolutions of a squad of Ustless Mexi
can Infantry in the village plaza, stood
a gentleman in the field uniform of
an officer of the Japanese army.
Hearing the thud of hurried foot
steps in the deep dust of the street,
the Japanese turned toward the ap
proaching horse an expe nt eye.
"Well, Gomez?" he said ?u Spanish.
"Excellency, I have to report that
lie Channing girl, with Captain Parr
sd a small company of friends ar
rived from the East this afternoon." j
The Japanese nodded gently. "Many
thanks," he said in an indifferent
voice. ' "You wUl be duly rewarded for

passageway.

"Oh. dear!" she complaiaed. "It's

. .With this she turned and scurried
out of the patio ; and Donald filled and
lighted his pipe, smiling tenderly to
himself as .he heard the drumming of
her horse's hoofs die ont in the dis
tance. Something like a quarter of an hour
later a heavy and confused roll of
hoofs roused him from the idlest and
"pleasantest of daydreams. Knocking
out. his pipe against the sill of the pa
tio well, he sauntered curiously
through the passageway and saw
that which startled him out of his
talse feeling of security in the twink-
Hng of an eyelash.
A small squad of the border patrol
was bearing down upon the hacienda
at a dead run, desperate haste and
anxious purpose written plainly on the
face of each man,
: Reining in and dismounting in the
nme breath, the officer commanding
the patrol turned and waved half of
uls men away.
"Get on !" he cried. "Rouse the boys

Ht the entrance to the patio.
His men followed him without an
Instant's hesitation, leaving their
mounts to run free; and then Donald,
obliged to concede the impossibility of
facing that charge in the hope of
breaking through and satisfying his
rautic solicitude for Patria, was
driven into the patio by a veritable
nail of bullets.
Stout wooden doors, strapped heav
ily with Iron, closed the inside end of
cue passage; and these were hastily
barred by the troopers, while Donald
ran to find himself a weapon and the
household wakened to find Itself be
sieged. Following the disappearance of Don
ald there was a brief lull, during
which no shots were fired by the raid
ers. Then, as Donald ran out from his
room to the gallery, a rifle in hand, a
frightful detonation rocked the hucien
da on its foundations and the dyna
mited gates of the patio were blown
in, hopelessly shattered and splintered.
A cloud of smoke momentarily filled
the passage; as the draught drew it
outward, bullets began to rain Inward.

! courtyard unlnjnred. and Urine fast,
j immediately the defeuse of the ha
cienda resolved Itself into a series ol
I hand-to-hand encounter. Parr, croucn
j ing behind the well sill, had two troop
I ers shot down at his side before he was
nveloped in a rush, borne bodily from
his feet, disarmed nnd man-handled.
Fighting as he had never fought be
fore, he struggled clear for an Instant
flung off the raiders who clung to
him like wolves to the flanks of a stag,
and found his feet again, half his cloth
ing ripped from bis body, his hands
pinritT
In that abbreviated breathing speU
he saw the patio as a panorama of ln-
' ferno, a pit of smoke and flame where
in men weltered and writhed like rep
tiles In a furnace. High above nim
he. caught a glimps of Bess Morgan,
kneeling before her bedchamber door,
on the gallery, and defending the
stairs, a revolver In either hand, dead
ly determination In her look.
Then Parr was assailed from be
hind. A clubbed rifle descended on
his skull with murderous force. He
rocked blindly for an Instant, then
pitched forward into unconscious night.
That proved the culmination of the
attack. With Captain Parr insensible
and a' prisoner, the leader of the raid
ing party ordered a retreat In good
time to escape the charge of the Chan
ning cowpunchers through the rose
garden. LOVERS' LEAP.
Pelting across country at a round
pace, joying in the free swing of the
unjaded animal beneath her, drinking
In delight with every deep-drawn res
piration of the clean, cool air of early
morning, Patria swung a wide arc
through trackless fields before, some
twenty minutes after leaving the ha
cienda, she drew rein to rest and
breathe her horse.
It was then that a sound of distant
firing was carried to her on the wings
of the wind which was moving from
the quarter wherein lay the hacienda.
Definitely frightened, she swung her
horse's head about and spurred bim
down the main road, but a hun
dred yards or so short of the Junction
with the road to the bridge at the bor
der checked the animal again and sat
still, Ustenlng to the growing rumble
of many hoofs.
Fearing lest she be caught In this
rush of horsemen, she jumped down
and led her mount Into the shelter of
the roadside trees, then scouted on
afoot for a Uttle distance to a point
whence she commanded a view of the
fork in the roads.
There she saw, first, an oxcart,
counterpart of that which she bad
passed in her motorcar the previous
afternoon, stalled by an accident to
Mie of the wheels, which the Mexican
Iriver had just succeeded in repairing.
An Instant later a cloud of Mexican
horsemen swept up the road from the
hacienda and paused at the fork. The
leader, a burly ruffian, stopped long
enough beside the cart to admonish
the driver in accents that carried
clearly to the girl familiar as she
was with Spanish:
"Hurry that ammunition across the
river before the Grlngoes get here If
you set any value on your skin!"
That was all; but the sight of the'
captive lying unconscious across the
horse ridden by one of the Mexicans
a figure all too readily identified by
the girl as that of her betrothed was
enough to decide Patria's course of aS
lion.
The raiding party swung on at top
speed for the bridge. The driver of
the oxcart picked up his goad and
prodded his beasts to the best pace
they could make. Patria ran back to
her horse, fumbling in the pockets of
her riding coat and finding there the
envelope of an old letter.
With the soft-nosed bullet of a loaded-cartridge
for a pencil, using the
saddle for a desk, she contrived to
scrawl a simple message on the back
if the envelope:
Mexicans with CapL Parr prisoner
crossing border by bridge afe and
trailing them rush help P. C.
Folding and tucking the envelope In
to the bridle, Patria turned the horse's
head homeward and slapped its side
nith the flat of her hand. Surprised
and Indignant, the animal snorted and
scurried off. Without giving it an
other thought the girl set off after the
ixcart.
She was somewhat surprised to find
that it had made such progress;
ibliged to overtake it ere it came with
ji sight of the bridge, or else give up
ler foolhardy scheme, she succeeded
n the nick of time, with none to spare,
an Instant before the cart, lumbering
!n a haze of dust, left the shelter of
the woods that cloaked the road, the
rirl labored up behind It and. unseen
iy the terrified driver, climbed aboard
ind buried herself in the mass of
straw that hid the cases of ammuni
tion. Then, half-choked with dust and
suffocating with lack of air and hent,
is the sun beat down upon the straw,
she resigned herself to enforced luac
ion that endured for many hours.
The cart had successfully negotiated
iie passage of the bridge and won to
i considerable distance beyond it
a hen a fusillade in the rear embol
lened the girl to Uft up her head, be
leath the straw, and gasp in a few
ireaths of clean air while reconnolter
ng. The cart was then on rising ground,
rhe bridge across the arroyo lay be
leath it and some distance back. She
wuld see the main body of the Mexi
cans which ambushed the Channing
wwpunchers.
A few fell in the charge. Her heart
)led for them, but her grief on their
fifttmnt was trifle compared With her
inxlety for Donald. He was already
'ar ahead of the oxcart, escorted by
Zelnya and a picked gnu id. So mucn
he had gathered from a conference
at the bridge, when the cart paused "
for further instructions; and more, she
had then learned that theart was to
proceed with all speed to a receiving
depot in the hills where Zelaya was to
wait with his prisoner UU joined by
the men he had left to guard the
bridge.
It was high noon when at length the
cart lurched its last lurch and came to
a dead stop.
The complaint of its greaselesa
wheels had barely ceased when Patria,
moveless beneath the straw, heard a
I voice she knew only too welL It was
Hurokl's, ordering the driver to hasten
' Instantly to a nearby village and find
Zelaya, to advise him that It seemed
best to remove the prisoner Instantly
to a safer place; he Hurokl wanted
horses and a guard for this purpose
I without delay.
I When the driver had gone, grum
. bllng, Huroki spoke briefly with an
other Mexican, ordering him to stand
guard over the prisoner pending the
arrival of the horses and the guard,
when he was to summon Huroki from
some observation point at no great dis
tance. I There followed three minutes of
quiet. Then the girl took her Ufe in

the straw.
