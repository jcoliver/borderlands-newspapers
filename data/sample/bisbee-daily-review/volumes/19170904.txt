STUMBLING
IN SENATE TO
BE WAR TAX
Fight Between High War Pro
fits Tax Advocates and
Those Favoring Moderate
Rate Rages During Long
Holiday.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON'.- Sept. 3. The Sen
ate spent today's holiday in the sharp
er t clases of its fight over war pro
fits taxation and again decisively de
feated proposals of the high tax advo
cates. Final Vcte Wednesday.
The final vote on the war profits
section is to be taken Wednesday. The
bill's provision as n'ow written for an
increase of about one-third or $1,060,
00O.0OU is expected to stand.
But three recruits were gained in
today's voting by the high tax advo
cates. In addition to the seventeen
who voted Saturday for Senator John
son's maximum proposal of an SO
per cent tax. Senators King, McKcl
lar and Tramniell voted for both of
the proposals.
Corporations Taxed Half.
Senators Simmons declared that un
der the bill as it now stands at least
one-half of the corporations of mo
country would be taxed more than half,
the tax alone of the U. S. Steel corpor
ation amounting to $183,734,000 this
year, while the tax to be paid by thei
Dupont Powder company will be ten
millions' nAire, and that of the General
Motors $1,500,000. The next increase
to be paid by the twenty other leading
corporations of the country would
amount to $21,136,0000, he said. Sen
ator Frelinghuysen said it was fraught
with great danger to both interests.
Would Impair Industry.
"To impose such unfair taxes and
impair industry," he said, "w'ould
practically insure the victory of Ger
many." Citing the increasing war expense
items cf Secretary McAdoo, Senator
Eorah said he believed they ultimately
would reach between $22,000,000,000
and $23,000,000,000 and possibly $25,
000.000,000 for the first year, including
loans to ihe allies.
The Final Provision.
"This bill p robably will finally pro
vide $2,500,000,000 in taxes," he con
tinued. "There is no record In his
tory of such a shrinking from duty by
a legislative body.
"Is $2,5000000,000 In taxes the stand
ard of patriotism that men of wealth
are willing to contribute to the war?
I do not believe it."
England la Cited.
Senator Borah cited England's 80
per cent levy on war taxes after two
years of war and asked:
"Are we not better able IV meet an
80 per cent tax at the beginning of
the war than England after two years
of it? On what theory can it be said
that we would break business or make
the war unpopular if business makes
20 per cent more out of war than in
peace? What a pity it is that dollars
and cents are not flesh and blood that
we might lay the conscripting hand of
the government upon them and bring
them i'j the support of the war.
Protect Business Efficiency.
"After business efficiency is pro
tected, I would take every dollar over
$10,000 of the income of every man In
the United States.
The Idaho senator presented statis
tics regarding the amount of profits,
based upon last year's earnings, that
big business concerns would retain,
even if a GO per cent war profits rale
was adopted. He said the Dupont
1 "jwder interests would have $35,000,
000 left over.
Simmons' Statement Recalled.
Senator Johnson called attention to
the fact that Chairman Simmons made
the statement that profits of the Steel
corporation this year would be $490,
000,000, and that the tax proposed to
be levied on that 'organization would
amount to but $183,000,000.

In Vain
(By Review Leased Wire).
PARIS, Sept. 3. "It is a pity
that so much blood has been shed
S in vain."
A German officer taken prisoner
in the recent French advance north
of Verdun, is thus quoted by the
Echo de la Rochelle and a staff of
i ficer who interrogated the German
is given as authority for the inter
vic w.
The Germans paid homage to the
heroic courage of the French sol
diers, but tried to discourage the
idea that help would be forthcom
ing from the United States, declar
ing President Wilson was fooling
the allies.
To convince him, the German
was taken before General Pershing,
when tears rolled down his cheeks,
and he remarked sadly:
"Since that is the case. It is all
over. We are lost."
OF BAD SHELLS
VERY PROBABLE
Head of Ordnance Depart
merit Says that Presence of
Brorriide in Cartridges
Makes Many of Them
Very Dangerous.
'By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, SepL 3. Stepa
looking Vo investigation of the supply
ing of defective cartridges to American
officers in France, were taken today
by Brigadier General Crozier, com
manding the ordnanec department and
the senate military sub-committee.
. Board May Be Uamed.
General Crozier asked that a board
o finquiry be named. He said a small
quantity of bromide, which retards
fire for a fraction of a sectmd had
been used in about 20 per cent of the
army's cartridges. Confidence was ex
pressed by the general that the board
would find that the defect was una
voidable and not due to negligence
either on the part of the manufactur
ers who supplied the chemicals or to
ordnance department inspectors.
Secretary Baker Called.
The senate committee decided to
call Secretary of War Baker In explan
ation' and will then decide whether to
pursue an investigation of its own.
Whether the inquiry suggested by
General Crozier will be made, will te
decided by Secretary Baker when the
request reaches him tomorrow.
Loss Is Considerable.
Any defective ammunition which
may have been supplied the navy by
the war department ordnance bureau
will be traced and returned for re-man-ufaAure.
While the faulty cartridges
compose about two per cent of the
army's stock. General Crozier said
about ten per cent will have to be re
printed since the slow firing cartridges
are mixed with others turned out from
the Frankfort arsenal during a certain
period last spring. New primers will
be attached to all still in this coun
try and the quantity held by the expe
ditionary force will be used for target
practice.
Easy ot Trace.
Since each cartridge and each box
bears the adte of manufacture it has
been easy to locate the stores turned
out during the period when the im
perfect chemical is known to have
been used.
The danger attached to the us ot
this ammunition Is that if the cart
ridge does not explode promptly and a
soldier opens the rifle magazine tt as
certain the trouble it may explode in
his face. Soldiers have instructions
not to open the magazine for several
second if no explosion occurs.
Bromide Not Detected.
The bromide in the potassium chlor
ide of the primers, General Crozier ex
plained, was not detected in sufficient
quantity by the tests made at the arse
nal to indicate the possible danger.

ROSSI

Troops of New Republic
Show the White Feather
and Commanding Officers
Are Forced to Evacuate
Big Seaport.
i"3y Review Leased W'lrs)
Riga, Russia's big port on the Gulf
of Riga, is in the hands of the Ger
mans and its garrison and the civilian
population are on retreat eastward.
Following up rapidly the advant
age they gained in driving tbe Rus
sians across the Dvina river on both
sides of Uxkull last Saturday the Ger
mans threw bridges across this stream
and soon were on the heels of the
former defenders, some of whom offer
ed resistance, but others of whom
showed the white feather, giving the
invaders no trouble in marching up
the eastern bank of the Dvina toward
Riga 15 miles .distant. Seeing the
disaffection and the inability to stem
the tide of the advance, the Russian
commander ordered an evacuation.
Russians In Danger.
With the falling back of the Rus
sians from the city, proper and the ad
vance of the Germans northward
along both sides of the stream, the
Russians still defending the western
bank around Dahlen seemingly are in
danger of being caught by the two
fast moving bodies of the enemy and
made prisoner.
Behind them the Russians in their
flight from Riga are lying the country
waste, burning villages and farms.
Gain Not limportant.
Aside from the strategic value of
controlling the Gulf of Riga and of
a base nearer the mouth of the Gulf
of Finland,-at the head of 'which Pet
rograd is situated, for the moment
it is impossible to see the importance
of the German gain, especially with
the near approach of winter, when
military operations in this northern
region are almost impossimle.
Italians Still Active.
On none of the other fronts have
there operations of great moment ex
cept in the Austro-Italian theatre
where the Italians have made further
progress on the Bainsizza plateau and
in the Brestovizza valley and at var
ious points along tbe line have repuls
ed fresh counter-attacks launched by
the Austrians. Violent artillery duels
are in progress from Tolniino to the
sea.
Austrians Lose Heavily.
Advices to the Italian embassy in
Washington are to the effect that the
Austrians have lost more than 128,
000 men in the present offensive. Re
ports from Udine, Itttly, give the Aus
trian losses as one-third of the first
line army.
Haig's Batteries Active.
The batteries of Field-Marshal Haig
are still pouring an incessant fire
agains the German trenches in Flan
ders, but as yet the anticipated new
dash by his men to capture them has
not started.
Artillery duels which are somewhat
violent in the Verdun region ,are tak
ing place along the French front. No
infantry actions of importance have
occurred.
German Air Raid.
German air raiders Monday night
again paid a visit to England, the
second time in as many days, drop
ping bombs. No casualties are report
ed. Russ Advance Started Saturday.
PETROGRAD, Sept. 3 The German
offensive on the Riga front began Sat
urday with an attack on the Russian
Uzkull position, following artillery
preparation which lasted several
hours. The Russian troops defend
ing the Dvina river withdrew and the
Germans succeeded in throwing two
bridges across the Dvina and passing
to the eastern bank.
The Russian infantry in spite of the
brilliant action of the artillery which
destroyed one of the enemy's bridges,
could not stop the German thrust
and the enemy, taking advantage of
this, rapidly developed his success and
began an advance northward. Rus
sian counter attacks against him wer
unsuccessful.
Petrograd Threatened.
LONDON, Sept. 3. The evacuation
of Riga by the Russians recalls the
statement of General Kornloff, com
mander in chief of the Russian armies
at ihe Moscow conference: "If our
army does not help us to hold the
shore of the Gulf of Riga, the road to
Petrograd will be opened wide.
While few believe that the Germans
will undertake to penetrate to the Rus
sian capital over an Inhospitable road

Soldiers of the National Army Are
Welcomed Into Service by President
WASHINGTON, D. C. Sept. 4 Soldiers of the national army weie
welcomed into the nation's service today by President Wilson with a
message and a prayer to God to keep and guide them. Everything

deepest solicitude of the whole country and the eyes of the world will
be upon them because they are "in some special sense the soldiers of
freedom."
The first soldiers for the army raised under the draft law start

ident asks them as brothers and comrades in the great war to keep
straight and fit by a standard so high that living up to it will add a
new laurel to the crown of America.
The message follows:
"The White House, Washington:
"To the soldiers of the National Army: You are undertaking a
great duty. The heart of the whole country is with you. Everything
that you do will be watched with tbe deepest interest and with the
deepest solicitude not only by those who are near and dear to you,
but by the whole nation besides. For this great war draws us all
together, makes us all comrades and brothers, as all true Americans
felt themselves to be when we first made good our national independ
ence. The eyes of all the world will be upon you because you arc in
some special sense the soldiers of freedom. Let it be your pride,
therefore to show all men everywhere not only what great soldiers
you are but also what good men you are, keeping yourselves fit and
straight in everything and pure and clean through and through. Let
us set for ourselves a standard so high that it will be a glory to live
up to it and then let us live up to and add a new laurel to the crown
of America. My affectionate confideuce goes with you in every battle
and every test. God keep and guide you.

oroved a willing party in the gruelling
mixing and in the second round evi
dently convinced Morris his energies
were wasted, for from that time on
Morris began tVt tax the patience ot
the referee.
Crowd Hoots.
The crowd hooted and jeered but re
served a cheer for Refer Hinkle
when the latter asserted htjj authority.
Hinkle did everything in his power
to force Morris to live up to :hs rules,
even stopping a few blows bi'dsclf in
an effort to give the ci'owd what it ex
pected. As he left the rlaj Morris
swung at a jeering spectator Quick
intervention of soldiers and 4 e police
prevented a riot.

work was conveyed to them that they 1

at hotels where the delegates are
quartered.
Speeches Prohibited.
Some Of the pacifists attended a
large picnic, having perviously an
nounced they would make speeches
there if permitted to do so. None
made addresses. A force of deputy
sheriffs was sent to the picnic ground
by Sheriff Treager who had been co

what instructions had been given to
the deputies, adding that he was co
operating with Adjutant General Dick
son and would be governed by in
structions from the commander of the
state troops. The troops were held
in readiness throughout the day at the
First Regiment Armory.
Mayor Criticised.
Mayor Thompson, by whose instruc
tions the meeting of pacifists was held
yesterday under police protection was
in seclusion throughout the day. Mem
bers of the state council of defense
discussed possibilities of action against
the mayor for what was re
garded as his illegal action in permit
ting the pacifist meeting to be held in
defiance of Governor Lowden's orders.
A number of delegates to the peace
conference left tonight.
The report of the resolutions com
mittee as given Out tonight contained
the following:
Nc Democracy, Said.
"The events of the last few days

and Governor Lowden of Illinois in
forbidding the peaceful aud law-abiding

taken against the vigorous protest of
the labor organizations in each state,
who now see clearly what lies behind
the attempt ti stifle free assemblage,
for labor is to be the next victim.
"We urge the people ot the United
States to repudiate this violent as

Governor Louden
Brands Pacifists
As Conspirators
(By Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO, Sept. 3. "So far as I
am concerned, I purpose to put it to
the test, that those who are not for
the government are against it," said
Governor Frank Lowden tonight in a
statement made after conference with
Attorney-General E. J. Brundage in re
gard to the peoples' council for de
mocracy and peace held under orders
'roni Mayor Thompson before the gov
ernor could get troops to Chicago to
prevent the meeting. The statement
said:
"The fact is that. the antecedents,
the personnel and the propaganda of
;he so-called national council of Amer
ica for democracy and peace make it
a treasonable conspiracy. Such a
conspiracy ought not, when the nation
is battling for its life, to find shelter
under a claim of freedom of speech.
"If we lose this war, real free speech
will be lost, and this society which
now claims privilege will contribute to
that end.
"I shall employ the full power ot
the state in suppressing the meetings
of this society. What I have said of
this campaign applies equally to oth
ers which may seek to obstruct the
government in the prosecution of this
war . Freedom of speech will be re
spected, but in Illinois it will not be
permitted as a cloak of treason. Time
has to find those who are for the gov
ernment and who are against it. This
is the only classification which mat
ters at the present time. If, as some
suggest, the people generally are dis
loyal to their government, let us know
it now."
The governor would not say wheth
er he contemplated any further action
in regard to Mayor Thompson for over
riding the orders forbidding the me t
ings of the peace council. The gover
nor tonight reiterated his orders to
Adjutant-General Dickson to prevent
all meetings similar to that of the
peace council. The troops sent to
Chicago by the governor on Sunday
will remain for the time being to carry
out these orders.
CHICAGO PEOPLE MAY
OUST THEIR MAYOR.
CHICAGO, Sept. 3. It was announc
ed tonight by officers of the National
Security League that a meeting of the
executive committee would be held to
morrow to consider plans for placing
charges against Mayor Thompson be
fore a grand jury as a result of bis
granting permission to the Peoples'
Council to hold a peace meeting after
it bad been forbidden by Governor
Lowden. H. H. Merrick, president of
the Security League, said it was the
purpose of the league to seek the co
operation of the state council of de
fense, the city council and the Citi
zens' war board to carry out such
steps "as will be necessary to bring
about - the removal of the .mayor.'
Resolutions, thanking Governor
Lowden for his efforts to prevent
peace meetings, were prepared by Al
dermen for presentation to the city-
council tomorrow. Friends of the;
mayor in the council said they would
be rady to explain the action of the
mayor and defend him against what
they termed political attacks.
County Judge Scully In a statement
today, declared that "Mayor Thomp
son is a menace to Chicago by inviting
throught his acts the coming to this
city o fenemy element, said that he
would call a meeting of representa
tives citizens to demand explanation of
the mayor's action.

Labor Day to Bisbee will long be
remembered as the day of days. It
stands for the beginning and ending
of many hopes. It stands as a mem

sons of Americans, go forth to begin
their work which will go long distanc

safer place in which to live.
From early morning to late at night,
thousands of people from every part
of Cochise county gathered to pay
homage. They came to laugh and to
pray. They came to bid a last fare
well to the men, the youth of the
county, who will carry its flag and its
spirit far into no-man's land, where
death and danger are co-partners and
where the safety sign is the god of
chance.

Tuesday Morning, September 4, 1917.
I am not ashamed nor afraid to say, with all the
strength that is in me, that I hate Prussianism. I am
not yet ready to try to erase from my mind and my
heart the memory of its sins.
If you love Right, you must abhor Wrong. You
cannot hedge. You cannot be a fifty-fifty thinker in
this war.
THE FALL OF RIGA.
The world at large had thought that the cowardice of
any nation had reached its limit when the Russians fell
back all along the line in Galicia and Bukowina this sum
mer before a thin fringe of German troops after winning
considerable victories. But the dispatches of this morn
ing carry a tale of dishonor and weakness that has no
parallel in the history of nations.
Riga, the great Russian seaport, was surrendered to
the Germans after the panicky and disgraceful flight of
Its defenders, and it is probable that there is worse news
yet to come.
If there is any obstacle between the Germans and ret
rograde it is not now apparent. And the worst feature
of the news, to the allies, is the effect it will have to
hearten up the German people and thus strengthen the
Prussian junkers in their prosecution of the war.
This complete collapse of the Russian defense means
that much more for Uncle Sam to do in the winning of
the World War.
German ruthlessness and Russian cowardice will re
main as stigmas upon these nations as long as the World
War is talked about and read by mankind.

"Unless the members of the people's council of
America preach good Americanism they will not be per
mitted to continue their conference at Hudson," said
Governor Philipp when informed of the selection of Hud
son for holding the conference, September 2. '
The number of artillery men employed in the recent
operations in the Verdun region was greater than the
number of infantry men put into the battle line. The
correspondent adds the object of the artillery is less di
rected to the destroying enemy guns than to forcing the
German gunners to suspend service and seek shelter. For
this purpose, he says, gas shells are largely employed.
According to the Omaha News plans are being dis
cussed by citizens of Omaha and will soon be presented
to the county commissioners to put all idlers and vagrants
and loafers to work building a military road through the
country. A state law of Nebraska gives the county com
missioners this authority to deal with the undesirables
and the drones. It is a grand idea, but it is not original.
I. W. Wallace of Bisbee proposed about such, a plan to
the Review some weeks ago as a most effective way to
deal with the Wobblies and at the same time secure a
much needed military road across Arizona.
According to the Enterprise, the social event of the
season in Bowie was the charavari of a newly married
couple in that town. Every town, big and little, east
and west, has its own particular hobby and custom. And,
strange to relate, they are all along the same line. As
David Harum sagely said: "There's about as much human
nature in some people as there is In others." In New
York the social event of the season is the same as it is
in Bowie. . You smile? Listen! The biggest social
headlines in the great city of masks and maelstroms go
to the wedding of the richest couple, who are charavied
by a forty thousand dollar orchestra Instead of by a few
too friendly and exuberous citizens.
ARE WE BECOMING TOO TOLERANT?
Charles Hanson Towne .of the Vigilantes writes as fol
lows on a vital subject:
"It seems to be the fashion in these cataclysmic days
to be over-tolerent It is supposed to be a sign of
strength and character to say that the German people
are not to be blamed for any part they have played in
this terrible game. One is said to be open-minded who
listens patiently while a pro-German street speaker con
demns our Allies and all their works.
"Peaceterms that are projected by well-meaning but
misguided people never fail to suggest that of indemni
ties there be none. It is thought that the world may be
readjusted, just as if nothing had occurred; that stricken
Belgium may rise from its pathetic position; that the
Lusitania may be forgotten; that Germany, the cause of
the world's greatest sorrow, may serenely resume her
way in the affairs' of nations. There must be no recrim
inations, no ill-feeling, no honest horror of all that has
unhappily happened. We must "forgive and forget." Wa
must "live and let live." We must feel no righteous
wrath at the wrong the world has suffered. We must
not blame the German people. We must blame only
Prussianism and Kaiserism.
"And how, then, are we to voice our blame if not by
open and loud protest? Why is it not as healthy and
honest to hate Wrong as it is to love Right? If we are
to deplore nothing; if, after this carnage, we are to sit
in friendly council with the fiends who have destroyed all
that made life beautiful; if we are to say that vandals
and outlaws are to be loved as much as are friends and
lovers, then what has it all been for? What processes of
peace of lasting peace can be brought about on such a
basis?
"Too much tolerance I the result of weakness. It is
the way of the pacifist the expedient way out of present
and immediate trouble. It Is the fool's part to forgive
and forget utterly a wrong that should never have been
committed a wrong that it will take year, perhaps cen
turies, to right.
"If they knew not what they did! But God knows they
knew; and if, with such knowledge, they fought this fight
against civilization, then civilization must bring the Prus
sians to their senses. If, after it is all over, they are to
be taken to our bosoms as tired children are, the effort to
bring realization home to them has gone for naught, and
we are Just where we started."
DEGENERATE APACHES.
How have the ferocious children of the super-ferocious
Goronimo fallen when I. W. W. agitators can start them
on the rampage. The Apaches of earlier times were far
from admirable Indians their treacheries out-did those
of the Hurons in the East and the Sioux in the West
but submission to despicable leadership was not among
their vices. The spectacle of the first generation in de
scent from the Indian braves of the southwest being led
to the warpath by the followers of Bill Haywood and
armed with hatchets dug up by tatterdemalion loafers
from Europe violates border history.
The same degenerate Apaches can be led by the same
scurvy tempters to make war in behalf of the draft re
sistance, yet the Indians of Gen. Miles' time would have
scalped the I. W. W. first of all comers, and not a Won':
Worker but would have put 500 miles of mesa and prairie
between himself and the southwest after his first intro
duction to them. Firewater and civilization have made
inroads into the few virtues the old Apaches possessed
Pawtucket, Rhode Island, Times.
It was a fine day! The sun never shone brighter op
the valley than it did yesterday when the first strains of
the marching music started the big parade swinging down
the street from Castle Rock on Its way to Warren. The
stars and stripes streamed out in a glorious breeze, the
sunlight glinted on the bronzed eagles of the flagstaff's,
the crowds lined up all along the way cheered and cheer
ed, the tramp of many marching feet resounded upon the
pavement. All in all, it was a great day.
Down in Warren the Vista was crowded all day long
and far into the night with cheerful citizens and smiling
women and laughing children. The literary program
was given with splendid spirit and appreciated to a
marked degree by all these pleasure seekers. The bar
becued beef was eaten by the ton and pronounced fit for
the gods.
Business was suspended for the day. No one worked
but the cooks and the waiters and the band.
The Cochise quota for the great nationalist army were
the guests of honor of the day, and surely they will long
remember their farewell from the district.
Well done, Bisbee! Now to bind on our sandals and
gird up our loins and walk forward to the fall business
and work. Every one will be able to work the hardpr
and do all the better work for the big play day the third
day of September, A. D. Nienteen-seventeen.
England is struggling desperately with American slang
Introduced by the United States troops. Ponderous Lon
don dailies are perturbed over "ishkabibble." One sol
emnly hazards it means "what's the odds," or "my luck
again." Another suggests it is of Hindustani origin and
cant imagine where the Americans got it." A third writer
remarks, "Many learned men have exhausted their learn
ing on the subeet. I think, however, that tliis
valuable phrase does not in itself mean anything at all."
One daily threw open its columns to contributors who
might explain it. An invalided sergeant, who h;id heard
Americans in France, finally gave the true meaning.

j (By WALT MASON.)
LOOKING FORWARD.
The world will be a better pla'-e
when kaiserism meets it doom, for
then the well known human race will
see true liberty in bloom. For years
the kaiser's been a threat, e'en when
he talked of peace the most; he made
the whole world go in debt for ships
and guns and armored host: If some
one lives next door to me, of whom I ,
live in constant fear, I may be nonii- j
nany iree, dui ireeuom or iiiai son is,
dear. I have to keep a bulldog pup,
a loaded shotgun and a creese, a large
stuffed club to beat him up, if he at
tempts to break the peace: I never j
know when he may come, on some ex
cuse, all fuil of fight, to knock my
plexus out of plumb, and so I cannot
sleep at night. It's vain to tell me
I am free, that laws protect me, and;
police; while that man lives next doori
to me, ail empty is your bloom of
peace. Thus to the world has Kaiser
Bill a menace been, a nightmare
threat; while talking peace he yearned
to kill, and soak the globe in carnage
wet. Because of him the nations bore
a load that sapped their strength
away, and manufactured tools of gore.
instead of tools for baling hay. When
kaiserism is suppressed, when it goes j
down with sirk'ni'ng thud, the world J
will have a long sweet rest from all j
this talk of war and blood. j

A WOMAN'S VOCATION
One of our modern writers has said,
"a woman is as efficient in business
as a man when she is."
The reason why sometimes she is
not so efficient is that her health may
fall. But the wise business woman
knows now what to do when attacked
by the ailments peculiar to the so
called "weaker sex." That greatest
of all remedies for woman's ills, Lydia
E. Pinkham's Vegetable Compound,
has been freeing women from such
ailments for forty years. Try it, if
you suffer from such an ailment, and
insure your competency and efficiency
in the business world. Adv.

WATER HEATING
b li.
BY
GAS
""l"
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

DRAMATIC FEATURE -AT
THEJAGLE TODAY
One of the best pictures of the sea
son from a purely dramatic stand
point is "The Tides of Barnegat," be
ing shown today at the Eagle Theater.
The picture stars Blanche Sweet in
an adaptation of F. Hopkinson Smith's
famous story. In this picture, Miss
Sweet portrays the role of a school
teacher who bears the blame of her
sister's shame, sacrificing even the
love of her own sweetheart, and U
about to be driven from the village in
order that her own flesh and blood
may be protected. In this role of deep
sympathy and human understanding,
she adequately fulfills all that this
h'jted part demands. "The Tides of
Barnegat" is by far the greatest novel
contributed by Mr. Smith and the film
version is well worth seeing.

Time! Tlie mellower
of friendship and tobacco
You meet a man. You like
him. You see much of him.
Years pass and you find that
Father Time has mellowed
your acquaintance into true
friendship.
Mellow tobacco is much the
same. The mellow OWL Cigar is
much the same.
We buy selected tobacco. We
'cure it for long months under the
watchful eyes of curing experts.
Finally it reaches the "peak" point
in mellow fragrance. Only then is
OWL leaf carefully made into fra
grant OWL Cigars.
To so time-cure OWL leaf re
quires that we keep constantly on
hand a supply of reserve leaf worth
always $1,000,000. And often more.
That's why your fragrant OWL Cigar
is called the "Million Dollar Cigar."
Try an OWL, friend, and see
what a fragrant, mellow smoke
Father Time has cured for you.
