Michaelis Answered
David Lloyd-George, the British pre
mier, made a speech in London yes
terday which was in effect a reply to
the recent rechstag address of Chan
cellor Michaelis That address, declar
ed the British statesman, showed Ger
many in military power and domnat
ed by autocratc ideals. The entente
could not make peace with a Germany
so dominated, he declared, and would
fight to the end, "until full liberty has
been established." He predicted a
speech in a different tone from the
German chancellor before long.
Britain's Ability Shown (
In connection with England's ability
to hold out the premier declared the
nation's food supply for the 1917-18
period already had been secured and
that through the cultivation program
the supply for the following year would
be secured ev.en if shipping losses in

SENATE ENDS
CONTEST OVER
FOOD MEASURE
By Vote of 81 to 6, Upper
House of Congress Passes
Revamped Bill It Now
Goes to Conference.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 21. The ad
ministration food control bill,
virtually re-wrftten after five
weeks' bitter contest, was pass
ed today by the senate, 81 to 6. Con-!
ferees frpra house and senate will be
gin work early next week and leaders
are hopeful the measure may' be in
the president's hands In 10 days. ;
President's Powers !
As revamped, the bill gives the presi- (
dent brOad authority over roods, teeus
and fuel, the altter including kerosene
and gasoline; provides for administra
tion by a food board of three members
instead of an Individual, authorizes
federal fixing" of coal prices, requisi
tioning and operation Of mines and
authorizes a minimum guaranteed
price of not less than 2 per bushel for
wheat at primary markets.
Distilled Spirits Banned
. The senate prohibition section, pro
hibiting manufacture of distilled bev
erages during the war and directing
the president to buy all distilled spir
its in bond, was substituted for the
house "bOne-dry" provision and will
be one subject of difficulty in confer
ence. Senators voting against the bill
were: France, Marylandffl Hard wick.
Georgia; Penrose, Pennsylvania; Reed,
Missouri; Sherman, Illinois, and Suth
erland, West Virginia.
Many Amendments Offered
Scores of amendments were dispos
ed of today but the principal features
were the incorporation of the amend
ment authorizing, the minimum wheat
price and another by Senator Pomer
ene greatly broadening the govern
ment's power to hand the coal situa
tion. The government guarantee for
"wheat will be payable at all principal
interior primary markets until July 1,
1915. The senate rejected 46 to 31 an
amendment by Senator Morris to have
the food board instead of congress fix
the minimum prices.
' Joint Committee Voted"
Another important senate addition
to the bill provides for a joint con
gressional committee to supervise;
war expenditures. It was proposed by
Senator Owen, a Democrat and incor-!
porated by a. vote of 63 to 31, several
Other Democrats voting with the solid
Republican membership.
' The senate also added provisions'
against hoarding of foodstuffs and for
regulation of grairn exchanges, auth

COLUMBUS, N. M., July 21.
The 1,168 men deported from
Bisbee, Ariz., who have been
detained in the military camp
here, voted unanimously tonight
to remain in the camp pending
further action by the federal gov

after the army officer in charge
of the camp had announced to the
men they were free to go whenever
they desired.
In Military Formation.
The men were drawn up in mili
tary formation and the announce
ment that they were at liberty
was read to each of the eight com
panies into which they have been
divided. They were informed that
instructions had been received
from Washington that they were

north of Torreon, which was occu

General Francisco Murguia ha3
moved .his headquarters there from

El
Delegation From Bisbee Goes
to Phoenix to Talk to Camp
bell Reports Denied That
Unions Are Tabooed.
Five men, representing the Work

Protective league, Wave this evening
on the Golden State Limited for Phoe
nix, where they will present the facts
to the governor of the recent depor
tation of the I. W. W.'s from the War
ren District and subsequent activities
in this county. Governor Campbell
wired last evening that he would be
pleased to receive the delegation on
Monday morning.
Many rumors and reports have gone
out of Bisbee or have been circulated
by men and women who have left the
district, which have been very far
from the truth. In some instances,
coast and other papers have given
space to reports which have lacked
even the basis of truth. It is in view
of this and other questions of public
welfare that the local committee goes
to the state capital for a conference
with the chief executive.
Deny Reports.
Last evening Miles Merrill, presi
dent of the Workmen's Loyalty league,
and J. R. Henderson, president of the
Citizens' Protective league, authorized
the statement that neither of the local!
organizations desired or planned the!
disruption of any of the craft unions
now in existence in the Warren Dis
trict. Thl3 statement was made in view of

Cleary Against Leaving.
William B. Cleary, the Bisbee
attorney who was deported with
the alleged Industrial Workers of
the World members and sympa
thizers, addressed the men and
advised them against leaving the
camp pending further develop
ments. Mr. Cleary pointed out that
it would be inadvisable to flock
over the country in a disorganized

where the people had treated them
kindly and should be shown by
the men's restraint that this treat
ment was appreciated.
The Bisbee attorney urged the
continuation of the organization

For the First Time in Camp's

(Rv Review Lnaseo Wire
m EADVILLE, Colo., July 21. For
Lthe first time in its history, not
a pound of 'ore was hoisted from
the mines of'the Leadville dis
trict today, and not a single carload
was broken underground. Approxi
mately 2.000 -miners, engineers and
pumpmen, organized and unorganized,
failed to appear at the mines this
morning, and it was with considerable
difficulty that the pumps on several
of the large plants were manned. A
few pickets were stationed on the
roads leading to the mines, and they
informed men coming to work that
the strike was called.
Fifty Producers Affected.
The strike, which was called by the
International Union of Mine. Mill and
Smeltermen, an organization which be
gan the work of unionizing the camp
some months ago. directly affects fifty
producing properties and a number of
small leases.
Will Meet Own Men.
A statement Issued at the Mine Own
ers' association today said: "Th
fact that the operators have refused
to deal with the union has been delib
erately misconstrued to imply that
they will not meet their men. The
managers have at all times been will
ing to confer with their own employes
and adjust any differences which may
arise."
Minimum Scale Just
Attention was called to the fact that
the State Industrial commission, at
the solicitation of the union, had come
to Leadvilel and investigated condi
tions here with the result that it was
decided that there was no justifica
tion for increasing the minimum
scale.
Pernicious Influences.
"The manner in which this strike
was called by discouraging pump men
from remaining at their duties, with
the evident intention of abandoning
the pumps and permitting tbe work
ings to become flooded, shows clearly
the pernicious influence behind this
movement," the statement continues.
"Such a course is not pursued in tlfe
Interest of the miners themselves or
the community."

OF CHANCELLOR
British Premier Calls Ger
many's Bluff and Reminds
Teutons of England's Un
prepared Entry Into the
Great War.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. July 21. The British
prime minister, David Lloyd-George,
speaking at a great patriotic demon
stration in Queen's Hall this after
noon in commemoration of "Belgian
Independence Day," characterized the
speech of the German chancellor. Dr.
Georg Fichaelis, as a mere sham and
declared tha the did not want the GerV
mans "to harbor any delusions that
they are going to put Great Britain
out of this fight until liberty has been
re-established throughout the world."
No Peace With Autocracy
Great Britain could make peace with
a' free Germany but with a Germany
dominated by autocracy, declared the
premier, there never could be peace.
The Germans, said the premier, were
making the same mistake in under
standing America's efforts in the war
as they had made about Great Britain
at the beginning.
Mistake About America
"They said that we would not fight,"
continued Mr. Lloyd-George, "and i
we did, we could not We had no army
and couldn't raise one and they need
not worry about Britain. I think they
have discovered their mistake about
us and they are now just going
through the same process with Amer
ica, "I want to put this to them: Great
Britain, not a very large country, while
she is maintaining and equippin gand
even building up equipment for an
army of millions afield and then re
serve in full fighting array; while she
is maintaining the largest navy in the
world, can organize in the third year
6t an exhausting war to turn out mil
lions Of tons of new shipping; is
America, with twice tbe population of
this country, with endless national re
sources, going to be beaten merely be
cause she puts forth no effort? The
man who talks like that knows not
America, otherwise he Oul dnot say
at Sneer
Referring directly to the German
chancellor's sneering remark that
America has no ships and no army and
that when America has an army it will
have no ships to bring them across
the sea, the premier said: "He knows
America just as little as the Germans
knew Great Britain."
Food Supply Secured
Far from being starved by the U
boats, Mr. Lloyd-George declares that
Great Britain's food supply for 1917-15
was already secured; production was
already increasing and losses at sea
were diminishing. He had sought in
the chancellor's speech for something
which he could hope for the ending
of the bloody struggle.
Declares Speech Sham
"But." he declared, "I see in It a
shaw Independence for Belgium, a
sham democracy iOr Germany, a sham
peace for Europe, and I say that Eur
ope has not sacrificed millions of her
gallant sons to set up a sanctuary for
sham."
Mr. Lloyd-George asked what hope
there was in the chancellor's 'Speech
Of peace.
"I mean an honorable peace, which
Is the only possible peace," he said,
it is a dangerous speech, a facing-all-ways
speech. There are praises for
those who earnestly desire peace,
many of them, but there are phrases
which the military powers of Germany
will understand, phrases about mak
ing the frontiers of Germany secure1.

spite the fact that officers and
clerks of the provost marshal
General Crowder"s office worked ,
all last night to complete the
drawing that fixed the order of
military liability of 10,0K).OOO reg
istrants, the tally sheets have been
compared and corrected before
dark tonight and the master list
was in the hands of the printers.
Copies will be mailed to local ex
emption boards beginning not lat
er than Tuesday and tbe summon
ing of the first draft of 6S7.OO0
men can begin.
General Crowder tonight issued
the following statement:
Drawing Complete.
"The drawing is complete and
has been apparently successful.
The official tally sheets have been
compared, sent to the printer and
" the proof is being received. Final
copies will be ready for distribu
tion not. later than Tuesday.
The Next Step.
"The next step will be the cer
tification of tbe results of the
drawing to 4,557 local boards and
the application by each board of
its chart to its serially numbered
list. This needs to consume but
little time and when done, the
order of priority of the neraly ten
million registrant sto report for
examination will be revealed.
Such additional drafts as may be
ordered by the president will be
filled by calling men In tbe order
of. this established priority and
no further drawing will ever be
necessary. Each local board,
upon receipt of its chart and upon
modification by the governor of
the quota to be raised by it. may
proceed at once, under regulations
already promulgated to summon
men for examination.
Thank the Press.
"We have now reached the stase
lnthe execution of the selective ser
vice act when we must have concert
of action by the states.
"I cannot let this opportunity pass
without advehting to the very great
value of the assistance which has
been so earnestly and efficiently ren
dered by the press.
Newspapers Generous.
"Without the systematic campaign
of public information that prepared
the country for the registration, the
enrollment of ten million men on the
fifth day of June, would have been im
possible. The generous support of t It
newspapers throughout the period
since registration day is appreciated
and only the most thorough efficiency
could have placed upon the street,
within a few hours after the first
number was drawn, lists for each reg
istration district, showing the names
of peYsons who would be summoned
for examination until first call of the
local boards."
General Crowder also made public
the text of the registrants for their
applications wihch will accompany
the mast lists.
New Features Revealed.
The only new feature shown is the
plan for handling cards that are found
to have duplicate numbers or are
otherwise confused, and also of deal
ing with those received July 10. when
the local boards closed their lists to
begin numbering.
By the plan worked out. these ad

oftheir own by lot and then will be
added to the lists of the districts from
which they come and be affected by
the drawing precisely as though they
had been received and numbered be
fore the board lists wer eclosed.
Where several cards bear the same
serial number, one will be drawn from

TAKING PICTURES.
Asher Jones, a movie picture op
erator representing the Ilearst-Patbe
service was in the city yesterday tak
ing pictures of different parts of the
district that were prominent in the
recernt Wobb'V round-up. He took
several pictures of the warning no
tices that are posted around and also
took pictures of the different guard
camps. He had already been at Co
lumbus and Hermanos and took pic
tures of Bisbee's former residents.
COCHISE PATIENTS INJURED.
John Solo, an inmate of the state
asylum for the insane, became sud
denly violent on Thursday night and
tearing an iron wash basin from the
wall attacked his fellow inmates in
the ward with him. He killed a man
name L. D. Dillon and seriously
wounded Harry Douglas and Wm. Cun
ningham. Harry Douglas was sent op
in December, 1910, and Cunningham
was sent up from Yuma county a few
years ago. He formerly was a resi
dent of the Warren District and lived
at Don Luis.
MUCH WORK AHEAD.
Mrs. Nora Budd who was recently
appointed as truant officer for the
Warren District schools, has a large
task before her. The board has de
cided to try and keep the Mexican
children in school for twelve months
during the year and she has been
given the task of rounding up the d
linquent ones. Her work requires her
to go to all parts of the district and
she should be provided with a jitney
at least, by the board to help her in
her work. She could then bring in the
truants by her self.

'FOOLISH QUESTION'
RECORDS ARE BROKEN
AT TRAINING GAMP
SAN FRANCISCO, July 21. Despite
the fact that the regulations mean as
much to the rookies at the Reserve
Officers' Training Camp here as,the
K'oran means to the Mohammedan,
there is much speculation as to how
these regulations can be followed in
certain emergencies. As a conse
quence. Lieutenant Colonel Fred W.
Eladcn is having more questions to
answer than a railroad intelligence
bureau.
One rookie wanted to know if he
should keep right on marching if his
shoestrings came I'oose. Another
wanted to know if it was against the
rules to chew tobacco on a forced
march. A third wanted advice as to
whether he could hang his hanker
t h'ef out to dry on a musket stack.
Other inquiries asked what they
should do if their hats blew off dur
ing a charge, or if the mess call came
while they were tangled up in a band
.a hand affair with the enemy.
Wrist watches have caused all sorts j
of perturbation. The rookies seek ad
vice on whether they can carry these'
into action. Some have even asked if
EMBARGO IN EFFECT.
A copy of the proclamation issued
by the president stating that all ex
port shipping must be done under fed-
eral license has been received at
Naco. The proclamation went into
effect last Sunday. Applications for
licenses may be made out at the cus
tom houses at the ports of exports.
From there they will be filed with the
department of licenses bureau of do
mestic and foreign commerce. The
applications must, state quantity and
contents. Mexico is included in the
railroad license territory.
MRS. GRIFFIN GRIEVING.
Mrs. Zella Griffin, wife of Tom Grif
fin who was an agent for the Occident
al Life and Accident Insurance Com
pany of Bisbee. is receiving no end
of publicity in Los Angeles and San
Francisco. Mrs. Griflin, more lately,1
has broken into print in the San Fran-,
Cisco Daily News. Her picture bedects
the article and the "copy" itself would
do credit to the most gorgeous imag
ination. It fcas been suggested by sev
eral that Mrs. Griflin return to the
Warren District and make a more thor
ough investigation of the entire affair.
It is hardly probable, however, that
the woman will come back into this
locality.
ALL DRAWN.
All of those who registered In Co
chise county on June 0th had their
numbers drawn on yesterday. They
will be required to appear before the
examining board in the way in which
their numbers were drawn, starting
with the first number on the list and
on down so that each one by watching
the posting of the numbers by the
board will be able to judge about
when he will have to appear before
the board. According to advices re
ceived from Tombstone the first two
hundred numbers will be required to
appear about August first. Full in

He is pleased to see the regulations

Toward this end the men are'gradu -

"The Man Without a Country" he who opposes or
seeks to evade the draft.
The U-boat war on commerce goes on. So does con
gressional debate; also the contsoversy over the details
of the shipbuilding plan.
. William J. Bryan will view with alarm and read
with sorrow the news that the Los Angeles Chautauqua
was forced to cancel a week's session after three days
of poor business.
The Review is in receipt of the annual announce
ment of the Northern Arizona normal school at Flagstaff
for the term 1917-18. The school will open August 14
and close May 16 of next year. There is every indica
tion, from the enrollment and the announced course of
study, that the coming term will be one of the most
successful in the history of the school.
In administering the food control bill in Germany
they use the club and the bayonet and the prison cell
with which to exact implicit obedience. Mr. Hoover, in
outlining his plans for making the food control bill ef
fective in this country, depends principally upon the
American word of honor.' Quite a difference in metb
ods. But it has been found that by placing Americans
upon their word of honor better results can be gained
than by any other means. This, of course, does not apply
to food speculators and those who seek to juggle and
manipulate prices. They will pass under the stern hand
of the law at once. But in the matter of general food
conservation, of economy, of development of food re
sources, in these things Americans are appealed to, not
driven with club and bayonet in the Prusisan way.
All is not gold that glitters; neither is complete and
unalloyed happiness to be found on the golden beaches
and in the golden sunshine of Long Beach, California.
It is declared that the mosquitoes are leading the sum
mer colony there a dog's life. We have no ocean at Bis
bee, neither do we have sheltering palms and nodding
roses by the million and a wealth of pepper trees. AND,
we do not have the mosquitoes. The fang of a mosquito
can spoil the sea breeze, the perfume of the flowers, the
song of the surf, the glitter of the beach and the music
of the band. Yea, it can quench the light in love's young
eyes. Bisbee has never spent any money advertising it
self to the world as a summer resort and yet it is prob
ably the only one in the world that really has cool
weather to Uuly and August without the accompanying
cross of mosquitoes. ,
IN THE ENEMY'S SERVICE.
Eastern papers, almost without exception, not only
commend the Bisbee deportation hut they demand stern
and stringent dealings by the government with the I. VV.
W. menace against industry and society. The Ne
York World has been conducting a regular campaign on
its editorial page against the wobbly horde. Here is iU
last utterance on the subject:
"Germany has fine-toothed the whole earth for
traitors. It has gone with men and money into places
in which defection wis unbelievable. Where it could
not buy treason it has purchased crime. What it could
not accomplish in the way of secret betrayal it has sought
to bring about by terror resulting from open violence.
For years the I. W. W. has boldly advertised Its dis
loyalty. Its placards have been displayed in our faces.
What more natural than that Germany should accept its
Invitation and do business with it.
"Troublesome as they may be, the rank and file of
this organization are not the chief concern of government.
Most of the members of the I. W. W. are deluded men,
in need of restraint probably, but nevertheless deserving
Instruction and sympathy. It is different with their lead
ers, some of whom are deliberate lawbreakers who exploit
lawlessness for notoriety and profit.
"All the powers of the department of Justice should
be centred upon these men at once. Whether they are
in the pay of the enemy or not, they are doing enemy
work, and l:"gal proof of the fact ought not to be difficult."
EDIT SECOND COLUMN
SUNDAY MORNING SERMON.
"Whoso keepeth his 'mouth and his tongue, keepeth
his soul from troubles." Proverb's 21:23.
Most of our troubles are caused by our tongue. Our
eyes we use constantly to see dangers ahead of us, and
our ears are strained to hear the warning that usually
precedes disaster. Our sense of toucb is instinctive with
caution and our taste protects us from poison. But our
tongue, ah, that is our reckless and irresponsible mem
ber. "His tongue hangs loose like the clapper of a bell,"
declared an old philosopher in supreme disgust with some
politician of his period. And that is the trouble with
most of us. Our tongues are loose and we speak before
we think. A hasty and heedless word can no more be
recalled than can the dead and buried yesterdays be
brought back to live again. Words wound more people
than do all the high explosives ever made. And words
of repentence cannot neal the wounds caused by words
of anger or of scorn.
Always people have talked too much. That was the
reason the most high God sent upon us the curse of many
tongues. You remember that all mankind spoke in one
tongue until they begun to build the tower of Babel.
It was their boasting and loud talk that sent the curse of
babel upon them as much as it was their pride of spirit.
We tell our secrets to people and expect them to
keep them better than we have done. We talk too
much to our customers and we talk too sharply to those
who seek to sell to us. We talk too much to our sweet
hearts, our wives and our friends, w ben we are in a
good humor we are loquacious and when we are angry
we scold. When we ascend the platform we talk too
long. When we are successful we talk too loud.
The world is full of words. They ascend to the skies.
these words, articulated in every language and jargon
and whine and gutteral of the tongues of earth. And
most of them had better have been left unspoken. The
soft accent of the hypocrite, the profane exclamation of
the drunkard, the boast of the braggart, the lie of. the
Philistine, the threat of the violent, the scorn of the
cruel,' the gossip of the thoughtless, the betrayal of the
traitor, the jibe and jeer of the gentile and the indiffer
ence of the'haugbty, all these wounds are inflicted with
words. The world groans today because tongues arc
loose and sharp.
Kind words are too few and cruel words are toe
many.
Silent men always are given credit for too much
wisdom and talkative men for too little. We undo our
selves with words. They fly back at us and bruise our
flesh and injure our reputations and take money from
our purse and friends from our hearts.
A lie cannot be floated in silence. Only men'.
tongues can bear(it aloft and carry it on and on in its
errand of woe. A tight shut lip and a serene spirit are
twins. They walk hand in hand down the pathway of
the world. The greatest poems and sermons and speeches
. . - -
and declarations are the shortest. Silent men are the
strongest because they store up their energy. Talk and
trouble are always linked together.
The stars are the glory of the skies and they are
silent. The mountains are -the pillars of the earth and
they never speak. . Let us look upward with silent lips
and learn a great lesson. Let us sit in the shelter of the
hills without speaking. Thus, unconsciously, we will be
drawn closer to God, our thoughts will be deepened and
widened, and when we are moved to speech our words
will contain wisdom and be attuned to kindness and
bring happiness both to ourselves and others.
Gems From the
News Field
DOUGLAS GIRL BRIDE
GOES TO FRANCE AS A SOLDIER
Somewhere in France Is a sergeant
in the American army who was mar
ried just before he left the United
States and took his bride with him
on the transport which carried his
regiment overseas. She went as a sol
dier, dressed in regulation khaki and
with her hair cut short.
Today she returned from France,
her effort to pose as a "Sammy" hav
ing failed. Her husband was in a reg
iment formerly stationed in Arizona.
The bride is Mrs. John Carter and
formerly lived at Douglas with her
grandfather. H. Clark, 737 Eighteenth
street.
ity of affections. Henry denied the
allegations, affirming that he had too
many serious and important things to
consider without indulging in oscula
;ory exercises with a woman, whom,
after all, was nothing but bis wife."
This enraged the wife, who proceed
ed to tell Henry Just what she thought
of him. Henry opened hostilities
with a dishpan.
AS MAN TO MAN
THIS WOMAN IS A MIRACLE.
Dispatches from Berlin today declare that, in taking
the census of the conquered country of Poland, was found
a woman who is 119 years old. Church records of her
village attest and confirm her age.
This woman was a girl of ten when Napoleon's grand
army invaded Russia and took Moscow and afterwards
made that most disastrous retreat across the wastes of
snow. She herself saw the great emperor and his legions.
She saw Marshal Ney, the bravest of the brave, and Soult
and Murat and Besseriers and the other famous mar
shals who carried the eagles of France further than they
had ever been carried before or since. It had not been
thought that there was a person living in the world to
day who had seen Napoleon at the head of his armies.
Waterloo, his last battle, was fought more than one hun
dred years ago.
This Polish woman was born in the twilight of one
century, lived throughout a second one, and still lives
to witness the pale dawn of a third change to the bright
light of a full morning. She is indifferent to time and
defies the tomb. She is a living relic of a dead pant.
Her hold upon life and the hold of slavery upon her un
happy country are equally tenacious.
Will she, who has seen poland bowed down under
the oppressor for more than a century, live to see Po
land free? Another year or two, added to her long span,
may well see this dark lamp lighted in the halls of
earth. ' .
Irussian power is only exceeded by Prussian pride-.
Following reports from Germany of rebellion in the
reichstag against a war of conquest and indemnity and
the murmurs of the people against any kind of war at
all, comes the declaration from the new chancellor that
Germany will be satisfied only wjth a peace with victory.
The junkers have dropped their mask. The peace they
talked of last winter was only a subterfuge to confu.se
neutrals and deceive the allies. Assuredly the kaiser
has his subjects umler iron control and has plenty of
food and munitions and man power with which to prose
cute the war. At least a year, and possibly two years, of
desperate and deadly struggle is ahead of us before the
blessings of peace may again be enjoyed.
TEUTON SUPPLY OF TORPEDOES
IS WEAKENING.
"The German torpedo supply is
weakening; the torpedo has lost near
ly ten knots in its speed since the out
set of the war and hence the determi
nation in accuracy of Are," declares a
statement issued today by the navy
league of the United States, after a
close study of the situation by its tech
nical experts.
Germany in this one essential, was
not prepared for the war, the experts
maintain. She had not a sufficient
stock of torpedoes ;she made great
sacrifices of her torpedo supply to
gratify the folly of the crown prince
in his vain efforts to take Verdun.
It takes normally six months to
construct a torpedo and it costs many
thousands of dollars.
KORNILOFF, RUSSIAN HERO,
WAS A PEASANT -HIS CAREER.
Few careers could be more inspir
ing than that of Lieut. Gen. I. G.
Korniloff, the victor of Galicia and ex
ponent of the renewed spirt and ef
ficiency in the Russian army.
He is forty-six years old.' He was a
son in the large family of a wretched
ly poor village clerk, a Cossack of
Western Siberia, and his home was a
log cabin. In his earliest boyhood he
did rought forest work. At thirteen,
by almost entirely self-directed study
be qualified to enter the Siberian Ca
dets' Corps, which custom had made
exclusively for rich men's sons.
Korniloff became an officer of the
Guards in Turkestan, and won the
rank of colonel and the St. George
Cross in the Japanese War. His prin
cipal feat was covering the retreat
from Mukden of one of Gen. Kuro-
patkin's beaten armies.
Afterward he travelled in Turke
stan, Caucasus and Europe, and wrote
books on Turkestan and other coun
tries of Central Asia. He speaks all
European languages, also Persian, Chi
nese and the dialects of Centr.il Asia.
He was placed in command of the
Forty-eighth Division at the beginning
oi the present war, and In 1915, cover
ing a month's retreat" of the main forc
es from uallcla, was wounded ana
captured. The enemy honered him
signally by the return of his sword.
He succeeded in a daring flight from
an Austrian prison ar.d finally reached
the Russian lines. He afterward re
ceived command of tho E'ghth Army,
which has just performed so brilliant
ly in Galicia.
AMERICANISM AND
PRUSSIANISM COMPARED.
Americanism and Prussianistn are
contrasted by comparing the followi
ng expressions of national ideals.
"The foundations of our national
policy will be laid in the pure and im
mutable principles of private moral
ity. There exists fn the course of na
ture an indissoluble union between
virtue and happiness, between duty
and advantage, between honest policy
and public felicity, and the propitious
smiles of heaven can never be ex
pected on a union or government that
disregards the eternal rules of order
and right, which heaven (tself has or
dained." George Washington's First
Inaugural Address.
"We are now in a state of necessity
and necessity knows no law. Our
troops have occupied neutral Luxem
burg and perhaps already have enter
ed Belgium territory. Gentlemen, this
is a breach of international law. The
wrong I speak openly the wrong we
hereby commit we will try to make
good as soon as our military aims have
been attained. He who is menaced as
we are, and is fighting for his highest
possession, can only consider how he
is to hack his way through." Chancel
lor Bethmann-Hollweg addressing the
Reichstag, August 4, 1914.
COURT ORDERS HUBBY TO
GIVE 2 KISSES TO WIFE DAILY.
Charged with falure to love his wife
a young nuDny or isasiivme, lenn.,
haled before City Judge R. P. Williams
was sentenced to kiss her twice daily.
"From the testimony of neighbors,
who, as is often the case, seemed to
know more about the affair than did
the principals themselves, it seemed
that 'tempermental incompatibility",
as it has been termed in higher
courts, 'pure cussedness,' as it Is
known locally, was the cause of the
trouble," says Judne Williams.
"You see Henry would go home 'n
the afternoon.' and not bein? of a
particularly affectionate nature, failed
to geet his wife with a kiss. Now she,
being in love with he r husband, want
ed to be kissed. After frequent fail
ures of th's kind on his part she
charged Henry with an extreme triid-
ANOTHER YEAR OF FIGHTING
BEFORE THE TEUTON "CAVES IN"
"We must expect to see the Ger
mans bold out at least another year,"
declares De Auguers, former Cuban
minister to Berlin for many years.
"The coming spring, that wiil be
the great and last hope of the German
people. They are convinced that
their armies will be able to hold out
until then against the pressure of the
p.llies, possibly not victoriously, but
honorably (?) giving up the least pos
sible territory. And they hope that
by the end of the campaign of 191S
that the losses of the allies will have
been so much heavier than theirs and
that their armies will be In such a de
moralized state that the German army
will be able to effect a powerful coun
ter offensive, which will show to all
the allies the vitality and force of Ger
many, and consequently the allies will
''mplore them for peace.
"And what if their hope is not real
ized? "It is very possible that the Ger
man people will begin to discover that
Lhey have been deceived. And when
that time comes they will lose confi
dence in the infallibility of their staff
officers and In the ability of their gov
ernment The German government
has promised the people that, during
the campaign of the coming year, the
German military plans 'will bear their
fruits, one fatal blow will be given the
enemy. They live on this hope. If
they are deceived no one knows what
will happen. ,
"The German mind has in fact two
aspects: The German has a strong
will, a great tenacity; he suffers with
out complaining; he holds up his heal
through everything. He bears up
against suffering and misfortune with
out the outsider being able to see in
him any symptoms of weakening. It
is because he is upheld by his hopes.
But when these begin to break down,
when the confidence has gone, there
will be a 'caving in." He will have no
tenacity in defeat; when he sees much
is lost he will say that it is useless to
resist longer, and be will resign him
self to fate. He will refuse to suffer
longer, even if Hindenburg demands it.
"The G Jrman government knows
this, and that is why It deceives its
people."

THE LAND WE LOVE.
j State News j
CATTLE IN ARIZONA
In Arizona, New Mexico and West
Texas there are thousands of acres of
good grazing land that can be develop
ed into first class cattle ranches. Much
jf the land is lying idle because some
one doesn't put down wells and de
velop water. There are lots of small
holdings that can be bought and en
larged; many of these small places are
held by people who haven't sufficient
funds to properly develop and stock
them. They are willing to sell 'Jut to
those who can improve them and will
sell at reasonable prices. There is
room in this country for many hun
dred thousand more cattle by develop

serve the feed.
THE FIGHTING BALE FAMILY
Five brothers in the army and un

"Abie" has just received word that his

in the Spanish-American war.
Two of the brothers now in the army
also fought against Spain. "Abie"
was desirous of upholding the reputa

Every man has a cross to bear. The
newspaper man's particular cross at
this time is a pair of white shoes.
They must have been made by the
devil, these shoes, just to destroy one
man's happiness in this world below
and his hope of salvation in the world
hereafter. But listen:
The newspaper man bought these
shoes in a large city befoie he came
to Bisbee. They were as white as
sno.v and looked as pure and innocent
of evil as a lamb in the fold. The
shoe dealer swore that no better pair
of shoes ever came from the cunning
hands of the maker. So the newspa
per man bought them and carried
them away with much pride.
On his way to Bisbee he stopped to
attend a reception given in his honor.
It was a hot night, and therefore ap
propriate for palm beach clothes, Pan
ama hat and white shoes. Arrayed
thu3, like another Solomon in all his
glory, the humble newspaper man

as he walked across the floors of the
chambers of the mighty those white
shoes began to get in their deadly
work.
They squeaked
Yea. they squealed. The newspaper
man blushed and began to tiptoe, but
still these devil's own shoes sang their
sad, weird song in the night. The rest
of the evening was ruined for this
guest. Every time he moved these
white shoes heralded his coming like
a brass band marching beiore a pa

On the train coming to Bisbee, every
time the newspaper man walked down
the aisle of a Pullman the porter came
a running to see what was wanted
and the rear end brakeman got his
red lantern ready for emergency use.
The steward in the dining car could
hear those shoes coming the fourth
car back and always had the meal
served by the time the wearer of the
khoes arrived. ,
Arrived in Bisbee, these shoes took
on renewed zest from the bracing
mountain air. They whined like a dry
axle. After two days of determined
effort the newspaper man's nerves be

he took counsel as to what he had
best do. Some one advised soaking

To the shining stand went the man

Regarding the
German Cause
WASHINGTON, July 21. Quite dif

view expressed by the new German
chancellor in his speech to the reich

tions and outlook in the central empires.

is second-hand, state department
agents are careful to forward only sucJi

reports is the statement that Germany

the population through the middle of

gathered.
The harvest also is Tery poor in

NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS
GIVE MORE DETAILS
COPENHAGEN, July 21. Berlin
newspapers containing the speech of
Imperial Chancellor Michaelis and the
debate in the relchstag have not
reached Denmark, for some reason,
but arriving Hamburg papers give
more extensive reports of the speeches
in the reichstag than were transmitted
by the Wolff agency.
Phillip Scheidemnnn, leader of the
majority Socialists, particularly at
tacked the submarine warfare. Its
adoption, he declared, was a triumph
of unscrupulous demagoguery, with
Count von Reventlow and the
Deutsches Tages Zeitung playing lead
ing roles. The censorship had pre
vented effective opposition to the war
fare by the press. Scheidemann re
called the prophecy made some weeks
ago by Herr von Heidebrandt, the con
servative leader, that the war would
be won in two months through the
submarine, and evoked merriment in
the house by adding:
"Herr Heidebrandt, your submarine
watch has run down."
As a weapon to end the war this
summer, the illusion of the submarine,
the speaker added, had broken down
as was inevitable.
Friedrich von Payer said that the
new chancellor took the same position
on ths peace question as his predeces
sor, and that the next two weeks
would show what measure of deter
mination Michaelis was ready to ap
ply to give effect to the program laid
down in the reichstag.
Hmt Haase, the radical Socialist,
made one of the longest speeches of
the day. He attacked the govern
ment's home and foreign policy and
demanded immediate peace negotia
tions, atonement for wrongs commit
ted and the establishment of a Social
ist republic. His speech is dismissed
with a paragraph. Herr Haase de
manded the release of Dr. Liebknecht,
and cries from the floor that the pris
on authorities were starving Lieb
knecht caused a tumult in the house.
In the roll call the conservatives
and national liberals voted solidly
against the resolutien of the majority.
Five numbers of the Centre party also
voted in the negative. .
SENATE PASSES
AVIATION BILL BY
A RECORD. VOTE
WASHINGTON, July 21. The house
bill appropriating $640,000,000 for the
aviation service was passed late today
by the senate without amendment or a
record vote and with less than an
hour's debate. It now goes to the
president.
One Amendment Lost
The senate's only dispute, with
many members expressing a desire to
pass the bill immediately, was over an
amendment of Senator Hardwick of
Georgia to strike out a clause author
izing draft of the men for the aerial
service. The amendment was De
jected, 66 to 12, after Senator La Toi
lette and Senator Gronna made brief
speeches opposing the draft.
Details Withheld.
Details of plans for expending the
huge sum appropriated have been
withheld, but it is known that it pro
vides for about 22,000 airplanes and
nearly 100,000 men.
The president is expected to sign
the bill Monday and the work of build
ing one of the greatest air fleets the
world has seen will be pushed with
vigor.
Would Draft Aliens.
Senator Calder offered as an amend
ment the resolution of Senator Cham
berlain chairman of the military
committee, proposing to amend the
army draft law to make aliens subject
to conscription, excepting subjects of
Germany or those exempted by treaty.
He said of the ten million men regis
tered over 1,000,000 are aliens, Arizo
na alone having forty per cent of aliens.
Senators Wadsworth, Stone, Brande-
gee. Lodge and others also urged leg
islative action to subject aliens . to
yesterday's draft as well as future
calls.
The amendment 'was finWy with

Resolutions of thanks and ap

The resolutions were adopted
with a cheer.

Mr. Cleary, and, tonight no at

to leave the camp.

on Columbus of the order of the
military authorities releasing the
men fomr military control. Mayor
R. W. Elliott said:
."The people of Columbus are
entirely satisfied with the order
of the military authorities releas
ing the striking miners.
"We feel safe and are sure that
there is no cause for alarm in thus
reelasing these men, who, judging
from their behavior so far, are
law-abiding citizens and working
men. Since the order for their re
lease was received by the men no
attempt has been made by them to
come to town or to cause any dis
turbance .whatever, they even hav

is no cause to apprehend that
these men will become a burden

We are on top cf the great
est copper market the worLU
has ever known. Noother
class of investment is in as
strong a position.
Government willingness "to buy 25
cents par pound confirms the cla'rn
that "250XM.C00 pounds of present
output is costing close to that fig
ure.
Other buyers are paying 34c cr
rucre, with forty-cent copper in
sight. War or no war, there is lit
tle chance of low prices for years.
What this means to mines that can
produce copper for TEN CENTS,
or less, is shown by the monthly
profits of $50O,0CO to $1,000.00 by
the United Verde and United Verde
Extension mines' at Jerome.
Their remarkable record is center,
ing about them the greatest activ
ity ever known in the copper world.
Great .Verde
Extension
Is in the very midst of this activity.
I
Surrounding it are United Verde
Extension, Calumet & Arizona's
Gadsden, Calumet & Jerome,' Jer
ome Verde, Dundee-Arizona, Jerome
Si-perior, Jerome-Del Monte, Verde
Combination, and othens.
They are spending ft)m $200,000 to
$1,CCO,000 in new development. The
basis of their soending is the re
cently demonstrated theory of the
"eastern" trend of the Jerome ore
bodies.
Great Verde
Extension
Is "next In line" for the ore, being
cTrectly EAST of. and almost sur
rounded by United Verde Exten
sion, the richest copper mine in ex
istence. Further, United Verde Extension is
now sinking a new six hundred foot
rhaft withn a few hundred feet of
the Great Verde Extension line, in
a direct line "east" from its own
"Edith shaft."
Every foot of their work is adding
rapidly to the value of Great Verde
Extension shares.
Great Verde
Extension
Cffeps the greatest legitimate oo
pcrtunity for huge profits on a
small investment ot any copper
stock in the market
Finding the ore by any one of the
ten surrounding companies (which
is bound to occur almost any day),
will send these shares jumping.
They are in far better position than
were the shares of United Verde
Extension three years ago, when
they could be bought at 40c and
less.
Bought now .at 50c, these shares
have these advantages: the pres
ence of wondrously rich ore bodies
is now proven: great copper oo era
tors are expending $5,000,000 in the
belief that thev extend entirely
pround Great Verde Extension,
AND, traces of pper are already
chewing in its own shaft at a depth
of only
TWENTY-EIGHT FEET
Officers and directors are well
known, reliable and practical men,
piving personal attention In nlaking
this property a mine with all pos
sible dispatch.
Now is the time to buy. See our

WEEKLY FINANCIAL REVIEW.
NEW YORK, July 21. The extent
to which business is likely to be af
fected by war time reputation engaeeil
the attention of Wall Street this
week. Little relief from present mo
mentous market conditions is expect
ed until the program of taxation and
taxes has been determined. Further
'price shrinkage was experienced by
many industrials and equipments. Au
tomobile stocks were at a Treat dis
advantage. It was regarded as significant cf
conditions' in the steel industry that a
fortnight has elapsed without effert-
ing any change either way in prices(the impression has gained currency
of finished products. The steel trade,-that as a result of the prolonged par
authorities declare, is simplv awaiting j ley with respect to the price fixing
the outcome of events at Washington.
Increased pressure against coppers
and other materials, despite the hich
record for silver was ascribed pri
marily to labor troubles.
Rumors of a cut in the St. Paul div
idends later semiofficially denied,
contriluted more than any other fac
tor to the moderate reactions in rails.
Call money's temporary rise to the
maximum of the year was brought
about' mainly by last week's technical
ly poor hank statement
CHICAGO GRAIN.
CHICAGO, July 21. Assumed cer
tainty of the enactment of minimum
wheat price- guaranteed by the feder
al government had a bullish effect to
day on the wheat market here. An
advance of 5 to 9si cents net took
place and the close was strong witH
July at 255 and September at 227.
Corn finished heavy, unchansed to
1 lower ff? l3i at 163'i September
and 1167 to 11SH, December. Tiie
outcome in oats was off to up
and provisions an advance of 5 to 32
cents.
Wheat started upward almost as
soon as the market opened and there
was at no time any important setback.
Week-end profit-taking by holders
finally turned the corn market down
grade after a display of surprising
strength.
New high price levels were reached
for oats.
Provisions rose with hogs.
NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK. July 21. Traders took
a more optimistic view of the Wash
ington situation today and engaged in
further covering of short contracts.
Commission houses also circulated re
ports of an early solution of the prob
lems attaching to war prices and tax
es. " '
Industrials of most descriptions, par
ticularly those comprehended in the
war groups, rose one to seven points.
Shippings were also in favor. Cop
pers were' irregular at the outset but
later gained 1 to points. Rails
were active throughout the session.
Total sales of stocks amounted to 332,-
000 shares.
The bank statement was true to
forecast, actual excess reserve expand
ing by almost $108,000,000 and bring
ing the total for that item up to $144,
000.000 against last week's low record
of a little more than $36,000,000.
Reserves of clearing bouse banks in
the local federal reserve institution
increased by almost $92,000,000 and
actual loans, discounts and invest
ments contracted by $125,000,000. AH
these unusual changes represent a
rectification of last week's technically
unfavorable exhibit. The bond market
was firm with Liberty 3V4's at par to
99.4C. Total sales of bonds, par value,
aggregated $1,000,000. Panama cou
pon 3's rose five per cent on call dur
ing the week.
COTTON MARKET.
NEW YORK. July 21. The cotton
market today closed irregular at a net
loss of 37 to 50 points.
CLEARING HOUSE BANKS.
NEW YORK, July 21. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies tor the week shows
that they hold $144,045,170 reserve in
excess of legal requirements. This is

It goes without saying that huge rev
enues cannot be raised on the basis
contemplated if profits are impaired
too much, which fact Is" craduaMy he

"AS STRONG AS GIBRALTAR" j
IS NOT VERY STRONG NOW. :
The old saying ahout the impregna-'
Ulitv of the Tfnr-V of Gihrnltar is ant'
to go into the discard, because Gibral-
tar isn't impregnable any longer. c
cording to some military experts. Eng
lish newspapers recently have devoted
space to a discussion of the possibil-
ilies of nn attack upon Gibraltar
should Spain throw its lot with the
Teutonic powers. It is generally
agreed that ordinance of the powerful
type now being used in warfare wouH
reduce Gibraltar to an untentable sta'e
in no very great time.
The colossal Krupps and Skodas
used by the Prussians would batter
Gibraltar's fortifications to pieces
quite as readily as they did those of
Liege or Mnuheuce. according to
many who have entered the discussion.
It is curious to recall that when
Gibraltar first came into the posses
sion of the English it was stipulated
that they should own all the lnd
within two cannon shot around if.
That inertly meant several hund'vd
yards, because cannon had little car
rying power in those days. Today two
cannon shot might mean fifty niil":t.

Show of Strength Seen at Ajo Last Fall, Jerome Second
In view of the recent notable and probably far-reaching action of Sheriff
Harry W.heeler. of Cochise county. Arizona, agisted by 2,500 citizens of the
Warren district. Bisbee, in removing 1.192 disturbers of peace cond.tions
from Bisbee and the state, a proceeding probably without precedent in the

the celerity and thoroughness with which the work was accomplished, and

also a proceeding which is certain 01 occasiunu.5
ment together with much exaggeration and perversion of facts from soni
quarters, the following statement has been issued by the Arizona Chapter of
the American Mining Congress after careful investigation:
The Bisbee strike was the culmination of several months of I. W. W.
organization, in the course of which its membership gained control of the
Western Federation of Miners local. Two weeks of intensive agitation, in
which public meetings were held daily and the utmost endeavor made In
speeches to align workers against captial. which was alleged to be responsible
for the war, and to make resentment against the war. preceded the calling
of a general strike in the district by the I. W. W. organization, effective on
June 27. The order was made without the formality of a ballot or even a
meeting of the men. by a committee of five, appointed at a meeting of about
200 L W. W. on the 23rd. This meeting delegated power to act to the commit
tee as it saw fit. Many of the men of the district knew nothing of the strike
call until they were turned back by pickets on the morning of the 27U,.
More than half of the underground forces of the mines left their employment.
The strike call was irregular and Illegal under all rules and laws govern
ing recognized union labor organizations ar.a was subsequently denounced
und disavowed by the Western Federation of Miners, the American Federa
tion of Labor and other organiza' Ions of recognized union standing.
During several weeks prior to the strike call, many new men came into
the Warren district and affiliated with the I. W. W These men were par
ticul.irlv active in spreading I. W. W. doctrines and stories of alleged I. W. W.
violence. Many of them had criminal records and were pointed out by their
fellows to emv.oyes of the mining companies, with attendance of open dec
laration that;' when these men got into action in the Warren district no mine
would be safe to work in and no home or business house free from the
possibilities of dynamite.
A hiig'h state of intimidation was brought about well in advance of Issue
of the Sitrike call, women and children having been reached as. well as the
men. anjd the entire district put in terror.
Picketing during the first two days of the strike was conducted with much
braggadocio and heightened the general fear felt in the homes of the work
iiiKmen of the district, to many of which I. W. W. delegates, particularly Aus
trKans and Finns, went with their threats. Sheriff Wheeler at this time took
personal command of the situation, on the second day of the strike, and on
the third swore In 250 deputies selected from business men and established
ritifcens of the district, many of whom were union miners, but with no sym-
pe."fhy for L W. W. These deputie s reduced disorder and threats by their
iere presence with authority of law and arms. A protective association
formed a year ago by the business men further assisted the situation by as
suring all residents that the business

COPPER PRICE
TOCOVERHNT
STILL IN AIR
Copper Producers Feel That
the Government Is Not Of
fering a Great Enough Price
for Huge Order.
BOSTON, July 21. Complications
have arisen in connection with the
60-million pound sale of copper to the
government at 25 cents per pouad
which the copper producers had reason
to believe had been accepted by au
thorities in the war department com
petent to close the negotiations.
In any event the all-important mat
ter of price has not been adjusted, al
though it was thought it had been.
It is understood that John l. I'yaii,
who has charge of the negotiations on
behalf of the copper producers, is "'n
Washington in conference with the
war department in an effort to reach a
settlement with the government as to
price.
It Is more than probable that the
secretary of war is trying to drive a
trade with the copper producers at
considerably less than the 25-ceut
price at least tentatively agreed on
several days aj;o, especially in view of
the fact that on Its previous order tor
45.000.000 pounds the producers nam
ed a figure of 16 2-3 cfnts the aver
age selling price of the past ten years.
We understand that it was specific
ally stated by the producers at the
time this 16 2-3 cent price was agreed
to that the price must not serve as a
precedent to govern later transactions
that until the cotton producers of
the south and the wheat producers of
the west showed a disposition to furn
ish the products of the plantation and
the farm at a figure relatively as close
to cost as was the 16 2-3 cent price
for copper, the copper miner must no!
be singled out as the victim of unfair
governmental discriminations.
Unlike the self-reproducing qualities
of cotton and wheat, copper once tak
en from the ground can never be re
placed, and this phase of the situation
must be borne in mind the price
fixing controversy.
President Wilson goes a step further

W. m imitators from fail to train: loadin?
and in an appeal to business men he
argues that any price offered to the
government should also be made to
the public. He says:
"The publis is now as much a part
of the government as are the army
and navy themselves; the whole peo
ple In all their activities are now mob
ilized and in service for the accom
plishment of the nation's task in this
wark; it is in such circumstances im
possibly justly to distinguish be
tween industrial purchases made by
the government and industrial pur
chases made by the managers of indi
vidual industries; and it Is just as
much our duty to sustain the indus
tries of the country, all the Industries
that contribute to its life, as it is to
sustain our forces in the field and on
the sea. We must make the prices to
the public the same as the prices to
the government.
This throws a new element of con
sternation into the whole situation.
The copper producers have evidenced j
a willingness in the present crisis to:
make a special price to the govern
ment for war purposes, but have con-1
tended that the natural operation of!
the law of supply and demand should J
govern the price to the public. j
But President Wilson also says: i
"A just price must, of course, be ,
paid for everything the government'
buys. Ity a just price I mean a price ;
which will sustain the Industries con-j
cerned in a high state of efficiency,,
provide a living for those who conduct i
them, enable them to pay good wages,
and make possible the expansion of
their enterprises, which will from
time to time become necessary as the
stupendous undertakings of this great
war develop.
"We could not wisely or reasonably
do less than pay such prices. They
are necessary for the maintenance and
development of industry, and the
maintenance and development of in
dustry are necessary for the great task
we have in hand."
This is just the argument of tho
copper producers. It so happens that
at the present time the wages paid to
copper miners are based on a sliding
scale whereby the higher the price of
copper the higher the wage to the op
eratives. Notwithstanding wages of
$."., r.O per day are paid to Arizona min
ers for seven hours' actual work, the
copper producing industry of that
state is paralyzed because of the de
mands of the I. W. W. agitators for
$1 a day pay for six hours' work.
What would happen should there lie
an attempt to reduce wages in line
with reduced copper prices in the
present labor crisis it is difficult to
conceive.

MEDIATORS ARE
USELESS TO HELP
IN SETTLEMENTS
Action of Jerome Miners, Soon
After Settlement, Proves
That Federal Mediators Do
No Good Against I. W. W.
Jerome, with 65 per cent of the op
eratives of its producing mines out on
strike under call of the I. W. W and
practically all of its developing prop
erties closed down, presents absolute
proof of the worthlessness of agree
ments that may be reached in the set
tlement of strikes through federal me
diators in Arizona under the existing
war conditions.
This statement occurs in a summary
of the situation in the copper produc
ing districts of the state issued by the
Arizona Mining Congress today. It
show3 the monthly production of cop
per in Arizona to have been cut by
the strikes brought in the last twoi
weeks to the extent of 54.000.000
pounds. Adding the loss at Cananea
of 7,000,000 pounds monthly produc-
tion, in which the I. W. W. movement
is also a factor, the total loss is
brought to Gl.000,000 pounds from nor
mal production in the southwest. The
total North and South American pro
duction under normal conditions of,
April was approximately 210,000.009
pounds. To the loss accounted for
above must be added Butte and Ken
necotl, with their total of 36.000.000
pounds the month, making a total of
97,000,000 pounds, or nearly half of the
North and South American entire
monthly output of copper shut off

MAYER, Ariz.. July 21. Undoubt
edly the best bit of mining news from
this section for a long time is the an
nouncement by the Arizona Bingham
ton Copper company of the finding of
ore in rour places on the 600-foot level.
There has been a large amount of spec
ulation on the part of the best mining
men of the camp as to whether or not
the ore bodies would continue from
the 400 to the 600. If they did and it
the high grade values kept up It Would
make one of the richest copper mines
In the state.
There are 11 separate lenses of cop
per ore In the mine which have been
opened on the 400 and the upper lev
els. The largest vein furnishes a stope
2 feet wide on the 400 from which
most of the milling and high grade
ore comes. From the new Vre bodies
on the 600 about 20 per cent of the
daily output is now being taken. Ev
ery round of holes enlarges the size
of the new ore shoots on the 600 and
there is nV question but that the ex
tension of all of the ore bodies will be
encountered on this lower level.
Perhaps there is no set of big min
ing men in the state more pleased over
finding ore in new lower levels In a
mine than those at Jerome whv have
the direction of the United Verde and
the United Verde Extension. When,
in May, a small block of the Arizona
Binghampton Copper company stock
was offered for sale to the public by
Senator Reynolds at par value, the Jer
ome men visited the mine and later
bought stock and advised their friends
to get in so there is a considerable
amount of the stock held by these big
operators and at Jerome, Prescott and
Phoenix. That ws before much w'jrk
had ncfi cone on the 600. The re
port that the fame high grade ore has
been encountered on the lower level
has set these Hi operators on edge.
It is .known iuat a cash price of par
value was but recently made to Sen
ator Reynolds for all of the stock
which would give a purchase prlc of
$1,700,000, but the proposition was
turned down.
It would be difficult to find a mine
with a cleaner record of production
since a regular output began. A flota
tion mill designed by H. KenV)n
Burch after the Inspiration type and
built under he supervision of C. B.
Glyne was put Into commission August
24 of last year and it has been in con
tinuous operation ever since. The
first day showed an extraction of 95
per cent. This has since been reduced
for economic purposes to 85 to 90 per
cent. For the month of May an out
put of 300,000 pounds of copper was
made with a net value of $33,000.
In addition to the mill returns
there has been shipped considerable
high grade ore averaging 13 to 14 per
cent copper. The concentration aver
age about 20 per cent copper.
The mill has run over capacity up
to 125 tons dally. A second unit has
Just been completed which will give a
daily tonnage or 250 to 300, which
should produce approximately 500,000
pounds of copper per month.
The present management of this
mine is greatly responsible for the ex
cellent showing that has been made
for the past year. The general man
aged Is Geo. W. Johnson, a former
banker of New York, who gives his
personal attention U the development
of the property. The mine superin
tendent Is S. E. Chaney, who came
from one of the big mines at Ray.
Thos. H. Tullock Is the mill superin
tendent who has had charge of the
plant since it started.
The strike of the ore on the 600
fbot level in this mine means that
another large section of the great
schist belt from Jerome southward 85
miles has been proven. The mine Is
only 16 miles south of the two big Jer
ome mines.
Geologically, ore On the 600-foot lev
el of the Arizona Binghampton would
be equal to the 1300-foot level or the
United Verde Extension mine. These
Jerome mining men are confident that
greater depth will find a uniform in
crease in the size and value Of the ore
bodies In this neighboring mine.
The announcement has been made
by Claude Ferguson, superintendent or
the Arizona Copper Queen company,
which has a big developed copper mine
adjoining and parallel to the Arizona
Binghampton, that construction work

One of the Earliest Gold Dis
tricts in State Witnesses
Preparations for Much Ac
tive Development.
(By William P. De Wolf)
PRESCOTT, July 21. Mining ac
tivity in the Weaver district, scene of
the richest and earliest discoveries of
gold in this section or Arizona, Is tak
ing on the proportions or a mining ren
aissance and is attended by more fav
orable conditions in underground
workings than at any other time since
the Rich Hill placers and the stored
treasures of the Vulture, Congress and
Octave mines were first unearthed.
The history of the Weaver district
dates back to the early '60s, when
Peeples and Weaver, two trappers
who had pushed westward from the
White River country in advance of the
frontier posts of civilization, discover
ed gold in the beds or two streams
which they named Antelope and Weav
er creeks. These streams run paral
lel with a gigantic uplift of porphyry
and schist, and their auriferous gravels
received enrichment from the treas
ure the elements eroded from its pre
cipitous slopes. From then until now
the Weaver district, named, as was
Weaver creek, in honor of one of the
original discoverers of gold there, has
produced millions of dollars worth of
placer and lode gOld. A number of
old-time Hassayampans place the gold
production of the Weaver district at
.1100,000,0.00..
Be that as it may, the section has
been and is one of very unusual gold
enrichment. So rich, in fact, the min
ing history or Yavapai county records

or its mining achievement. Some
years ago, in conversation with a party
of fellow mining engineers, the late
Colonel "Bill" Parish of Virginia City.
Deadwood and other out-of-the-way
corners of the world pronounced the
Weaver district to be the richest gold
producing section ever discovered. Col

therein of about 14 miles that com
prises Rich Hill and its atteadant
streams Antelope antd Weaver creeks
the Vulture, Octove and Congress
mines, and the "Andy". Peterson hold
ings, the last mentioned being now
owned by the Beehive Gold ocmpany.
El Paso and other Texas capital Is
interested in the development or the
seven patented claims held by the Bee
hive company. The estate adjoins the
famous Octave mine, with a produc
tion record of J2.500.0O0 worth of gold,
and will doubtless be the most noted
gold mine of the Weaver district Five
of the Beehive claims carry the con
tinuation or the Little Joker lode or
the Octave estate, while the remaining
two claims carry a spur thereor. The
Joker and parallel ledges have for
many years been piOlific gold-yielders
within the boundaries of the Octave.
The latter Is being operated by Los
Angeles people under the direction of
J. Nelson Nevius. mining engineer of
that city. Development work Is at this
time confined to the upper levels or
the mine as the lower workings are
flooded.
Charles Zeiger, a well known busi
ness and mining man or El Paso, is
president and general manager of the
Beehive Gold company. Mr. Zeiner
brings to the development of the group
a mining knowledge of the Weaver
district or 20 years standing. Under
his supervision the necessary camp
buildings have been erected, machin
ery and air-drills Installed and the
property brought to the stage or d
velopment where production is assur

leveled threats at the mayor. The sit-
uation was plainly passing out of hand
rapidly.
In a conference of city and county
officers, two days before, the city au
thorities had expressed their entire
willingness that Sheriff Wheeler
should command the situation both in
Bisbee and the Warren district. In
consequence Sheriff Wheeler on Wed
nesday night formulated a proclama
tion and decided upon taking the
final steps which he believed would I
break the trouble, and which he had j
held in reserve for use only in the last j
exthemity. These steps included thel
calling to his aid in deputyship ca-i
pacities of every member of the Loy-j
alty league and the Business Men's!
association. AH members had been '
advised days in advance by the sheriff;
that should he need their services they!
would be called by telephone . and'
should immediately report to desig-i
nated assemblage places, armed, pro-;
vided they had weapons. Men with j
telephones were desginated to call
neighbors personally who might not
have Wlephones but belonged to one
or the other of the organizations. '
Phone calls were started at 4 a. m. j
July 12. Fifteen hundred men sur-j
rounded the I. W. W. pickets at 5:30,
taking them completely by surprise.!
The sheriff was in direct command
and remained so throughout the day.
His proclamation, published in the
Bisbee Review the morning of -the call
and issued on the streets at 6 o'clock,
set forth, the entire cause of action,
embraced briefly in the fact that
throughout the district from the be
ginning the alleged strike had been
recognized as in reality and solely a
part of the confessed anti-war, government-opposition
propaganda of the
I. W. W. The proclamation follows:
"Bisbee, July 12. 1917.
"I J-ave formed a Sheriffs' Posse of
1,200 men in Bisbee and 1,000 in
Douglas, all loyal Americans, for the
purpose of arresting, on charges of
vagrancy, treason, and of being dis
turbers of the peace of Cochise coun
ty, all those strange men who have
congregated here from other parts and !
sections for the purpose of harassing!
and intimidating all men who desire to
pursue their daily M)il. I am contin-j
uauy iota oi threats ana insults
heaped upon the working men of this
district by so-called strikers, who are
strange to these parts, yet who pre
sume to dictate Vie manner of life of
the people of this district.
"Appeals to patriotism do not move
them, nor do appeals to reason. At a
time when our country needs her ev
ery resource, these strangers persist
in keeping from her the precious
metal productoin of this entire dis
trict. "Today I heard threats to the effect
that homes would be destroyed be
cause the heads of families instated
upon their rights as Americans to
work for themselves, their families
and their country.
"Other threats have and are being
daily made. Men have been assaulted
and brutally beaten, ,and only today I
heard the Mayor of Bisbee threatened
and his requests ignored.
"We cannot longer stand or tolerate
such conditions! This is no labor

States.
"I therefore call upon all loyal
Americans to aid me in peaceably ar

be quickly and effectively overcome. !
"HARRY C. WHEELER, j
"Sheriff Cochise County, Aria."
Tiie men answering the call of the;
sheriff had been imposed upon to the;
last degree. They felt with him that:
the hour had arrived in which they
must remove fie menace from the dis-1
trict, or be removed, for in their oy-'
alty to country they could not accede1
to the strike demands of the I. W. W., j
which the speakers of the latter open-j
ly admitted to be mere subterfuge, for
the concealment of the real object of j
the movement, the crippling of tlie:
government, and the glinting of which;
would not terminate the trouble but!
simply make way for the presentation!
of further demands under which the;
so-called strike would continue.
Nr (withstanding ,-.11 of this, the deep!
utics went about their business un-
der self restraint. No abuse of any1
character was practiced at any tiui!
during the day. No ribald jests passed.!
No taunting occurred. Commands;
were in few words, stern and to thel
point. As the several groups of dep-
titles came to the convergmg point
they picked up all men they met on
the way who were not at work, and
these were ordered among the pickets
as the latter were gathered in a circle
of armed guards. Later, details of
deputies went about the streets and
roads of the city and district and
picked up other men, known I. W. W..
known sympathizers and all men who
could not give clean account of them
selves. Other squads were detailed
to rooming ami boarding houses and
gathered from these a number of men.
It was upon one such expedition that
the oi'ly tragedy of the day occurred.
James Brew firing through a door up
on a group of five deputies and kill
ing Orson P. McRae. The latter was
unarmed. As Brew continued to
shoot, one of the deputies lifted his
gun and instantly killed him. Brew's
mind is believed to have become un
balanced through brooding over the
situation in the district. He was an
I. W. W. but had not been among the
strikers. He fired before the deputies
keuw of his presence in the house.
Ota Sunday, July 15, the people ol
Bisbee and the Warren district turned
out en masse to pay last honors to Or
son P. McRae. The body lay in state
in the public 6quare. Attorney ('has.
T. Knapp pronounced over the body
that it was a sacrifice to the country
as noble and courageous as any ever
given upon battlefield, and that it
marked Arizona's first extension of
life in the conduct of the present war.
Ten thousand people of the district,
more than 7,000 of these being men
on foot, marched three miles with the
body to the cemetery. Popular sub
scription to raise a monument to the
fallen patriot in the public square fol
lowed on .Monday.
From time to time during the morn
ing and early afternoon groups of de
tained men were marched by guards
over the four miles of road between
Bisbee and the Warren ball park,
wherein the men were held. Armed
guards kept watch over the park,
wherein the men were held. Armed
guards kept watch over the park. En
trance to- the latter was accorded all
citizens who made request for the pur
pose of going among the crowd and
finding men who could be responsibly
vouched for as innocent of I. W. W.
participation or sympathy and who
desired to be released to go to work.
Every man held within the park was
accorded the privilege of calling for
any person who could clear his name.
Later the opportunity of release was
broadened, every man announcing that
he wished to return to work and that
he would account for himself reliably
being privileged to leave the ranks of
the detained.
At 11:30 o'clock the morning the
ball p.'irk gates were opened and jthe
men still inside were ordered to
march out and into box and cattle cars
which had been placed on a siding. Of
total detentions during the day to the
number of nearly 2,000 there were
1,192 who went aboard the cars. Tites..
wcre pulled out as soon as loaded,
about 12:30, and started for Columbus.
N. M., where it was the intention of
turning the men o-ver to the federal
army commandant at that point for
detention as enemies of the country.
Water and food were in each car.
Where stops were made by the train
to change crews, at Lee's station, be
yond Douglas, and to take siding for
other trains, the detained men were
permitted to leave the cars by the
guards mounted on each, but promptly
put back in when the train was ready
to resume. At Columbus the officer
in command declined to receive the
men until he had specific orders from
Washington. The train wa3 taken back
to Hermanas, 23 miles, remaining
there until the morning of the 14th,
when Sheriff Simpson, of Luna coun
ty, N. M., who took charge of the men
on the 1.1th, when the Bisbee guards
returned home, conducted the train
to Columbus and turned the men over
to the federal army camp, which
through the efforts of Governor Lind
sey, of New Mexico, had received in
structions to take charge of the men,
the governor having successfully taken
the position that the problem raised by
the I. W. W. was a national and not
a state issue. In the interim food was
forwarded to the train camp.
The detained men, from the time
of being taken into custody in Bisbee,
were urged by the I. W. W. leaders to
resist all efforts to get them to leave
the ranks of the radical crowd, wheth
er by members of their families, if
they had such, by friends, acquaint
ances or entirely unprejudiced persons.
Many women, wives and relatives oi
detained men, went to the bull park.
These were worked upon by women
radicals of the I. W. W. outside of the
park and a condition of hysteria cre
ated in which many of the women, in
violent language, urged the men to go
on the train, and denounced lriends
who offered to intercede and get men
out. The efforts of the I. W. W.
women radicals outside the park were
in concert with those of the men in
pide and culminated in the men bank
ing themselves against a wall of the
park with the declaration that they
would refuse to be marched upon the
deportation train. This attitude was
maintained until a few minut-s before
the train was lea ly to receive them,
when they gave up the pretense of re
sistance l ftire the determined guards,
who notified them to get ready to
march out.
Three women who had been on the
picket lines and most violent in their
language while so engaged, and who
for days had' been busy spreading
threats and intimidation among women
and children in various neighborhoods
of the district were among the de
tained in the morning, but were not
placed aboard the deportation train.
The women were under surveillance
after departure of the train and con
tinue to be watched, along with all
about whom there is any doubt. A
number more men were ' gathered in
after the train left and others con
tinue to be picked up, many deputy
sheriffs being assigned to keep watch
and investigate all reports sent in to
the Protective association. Work
men's loyalty league or the sheriff's
headquarters direct, as to suspicious
characters or threats heard. The spir
it dominating the movement in the
beginning is none abated and is ex
pressed in determination that the city
and district shall be restored to entire
freedom from intimidation and of all
disloyalty to country, by word of
mouth or in any other way.
That no grievance existed among
the employes of the mining companies
of the Warren District, who have al
ways paid the highest wages In Ari
zona, and during the last two years
the highest wages paid to miners in
large bodies in any mining division of
the world, and who have provided im
proved working conditions and facili
ties regardless of expense as fast as
science has shown the way to these,
appears to be amply proven by the
fact that the moment intimidation
was removed in the district hundreds
of men who had not been working dur
ing the alleged strike period, and who
had not been taken in custody, rushed
to the mines to put in their applica
tions for re-employnient. These men
were not out in sympathy with any of
the demands made upon the com
panies by the I. W. W., which were as
follows:
First: Abolition of the physical ex
amination. ' Second: Two men to
work on machines. Third: To dis
continue all blasting during the shift.
Fourth: Two men to work together
in all raises. Fifth: The abolition of
all bonus and contract work. Sixth:
To abolish the sliding scale. All
men underground a minimum flat rate
of $6 per shift. Top men $5.50 per
shift. Seventh: No discrimination
against members of any organization.
Upon the issuance of these demands,
managers of the mining companies of
the district published statements that
the demands represented subterfuge;
that they would not be given consid
eration coming from the I. W. V.;
that the grievance committees of the
men at work for the companies would
be heard at any time with any sug
guestion or request, as had always
been the rule.
As previously stated, I. W. W. pub
lic speakers in advance of the strike
call and thereafter made no conceal
ment of the fact that they did not in
tend to abide by any settlement of the
strike that might be made, even
should all of the demands be granted,
but to immediately follow any set
tlement that might occur with anoth
er strike call, to be enforced under
continued intimidation, carried to any
extent that might be necessary. That
this attitude was earnest,, finds proof
in the course followed at Jerome,
where settlement of strike secured on
June 3 was followed less than a
month later by another I. W. W. strike
call. The first settlement was brought
about through the mediation of Judge
John McHride, acting for the federal
government. Its terms were of, posi
tive character in provision that the
settlement should have life during the
balance of the t war period. Its viola
tion was accepted throughout Arizona
as proof positive that no agreement
negotiated by the federal government
would be binding upon the I. W. W.,
as, indeed, it had itself proclaimed.
The second strike call at Jerome was
settled by deportation of the I. W. W.
ringleaders by aroused and indig
nant authorities and citizens, many of
the latter miners, who refused to long
er tolerate intimidation at the expense
of national and community welfare.
The same spirit prevailed that later
actuated the Bisbee movement, which;
in fact received encouragement from
the Jerome action.
The effort for statewide paralysis of
'.he copper industry in Arizona which
reached its climax in resul's with so
called labor strikes prevalent in June
in Jerome, Bisbee, Globe. Miami, Clif
ton and Morenci, was started in No
vember last with a strike under snap
call at Ajo of the same kind as prac
ticed by the I. W. W. in Bisbee. Je
rome. Miami and Globe. In Clifton
and Morenci there was a vote, but an
answer that had been made by the
mining companies and that might have
been satisfactory to the men in set
tlement of the demands they had
made, was withheld from them by the
agitators and strike organizers. Tho
Ajo strike was continued for 60 days
with the attendance of I. W. W. in
timidation practices. This effort was
so thoroughly broken in the end that
attempts in June to get another strike
were utterly unavailing. From Ajo
the professional I. W. W. strike mak
ers were moved to Jerome in January.
They worked there as they did in Ajo
and a they have in other districts as
abettors' of Western Federation and
Arizona Federation of I,abor agita
tors. In between the Ajo strike find
the strike ultimately obtained at Je
rome they attempted to break, up the
cotton Industry, another war essential,
in the Salt River valley. Immediately
they had the first Jerome strike going
they turned attention actively to Kit-!'f-e.
where the state head of the I.
W. W. went from Jerome and was
soon joined by his first lieutenant from
the Globe-Miami district. When they
had the Bisbee campaign well started
they turned attention to Clifton and
Morenci, where they gave assistance
to the state federation hepd who had
been handling these districts and who
had also been prominent in the Je
rome strike organization and in Mi
ami. Subsequently they went to Mi
ami and Globe and in the week pre
vious to calling of the strikes there
they were foremost In bringing pre
liminary steps to conclusion. Fol
lowing this they made endeavors to
reach the districts of Ray and Super
ior and to cain entry to Douglas with
view of tieing up the smelters. In
these efforts they were frustrated by
Indignant authorities and citizens who
declared that any interference with
the copper industry during time of
war meant interference with the na
tion to the point of treason. This atti
tude has been taken by loyal citizens
throughout the state, they finding jus
tification for it in the fact that in
none of the mining districts attacked
by the agitators have there been con
ditions of wages or employment which
were not the best in their several
classes existing anywhere and with
which the men had no fault until the
disturbers among them became active
with intimidation.
Briefly, careful investigation and an
alysis of the situation in Arizona
makes it clear that a group of agita
tors who have been active for several
years In association with several la
bor organizations have secretly co
operated under the general direction
and influence of the I. W. W. in Ari
zona since last November; that their
only attainments have been embar
rassment of the production of a war
essential and demoralization of men
and business in Arizona; that they
have resorted to much deception and
treachery among the rank and file of
their organizations and to all manner
of intimidation and false pretense be
fore the general public, even to the
length of attempted intimidation of
the governor of the state and false
representations to the president and
departments at Washington; that their
continued efforts have not been pos
sible without large money resources
which must have come from outside
and which no one would have inter
est in furnishing under existing con
ditions of national stress except a for
eign foe; that their continued free
dom to plot and excute steps interfer
ing with an essential war metal is dis
tinctly menacing and justifies many
letters and telegrams which depart
ments at Washington will find in their
files declaring the need of federal in
vestigation and protective action in
Arizona, embracing the detention of
these ring leaders, one of whom is
how the spokesman among the men
deported from the Warren District,
and justifying a large amount of news
paper comment In Arizona, which dur
ing more than three months has rep
resented a constant appeal for feder
al help in the state in order that mu
nitions crippling strikes and such cul
minations as those of Jerome and Bis
bee might be forestalled and averted.
EDITOR'S NOTE There has been
criticism of the fact that until the ev
ening of July 12, a strict censorship
prevailed over the telegraph office? in
Bisbee and Douglas, news of the pro
ceedings under way in the Warren
District during that day being refused
transmission. Editors and all others
conversant with the general situation
in Arizona mining districts on that
day will fully justify the censorship In
the light of the fact that the necessity
for action in Bisbee came so abruptly
that there was no time to give ad
vance warning to the authorities in
other counties where I. W. W.'s were
assebled and ready to precipitate des
perate actions. Had the word got to
them before the authorities were well
advised there is no doubt but much
blood would have been spilled.
TRUAX MINE SHIPS
THREE GARS OF ORE
Recent Strike on Juniper Flats
Gives Much Encourage
ment to That Region.
The Truax mine at Juniper Flats, a
few miles out on the road to Tomb
stone, shipped three cars of high
grade ore this week from the strike
recently made. A S0-fiAt shaft gives
entry to the ore, which was opened on
the surface. The deep shaft on the
property is a little to one side of the
strike. Preparations are now being
made to reach for the ore from the
Wittom of the deep shaft. This prop- j
erty has had a remarkable career. It i
has been shipping intermittently dur
ing the last three years, always with i
ore on hand of high grade. A dozen
times trench work has opened sensa- j
tional values, occasioning excitements. 1
W'm. Truax, owner of the. control, has;
kept constantly at development, ovt
(jtning a!l discouragements. Tho
present outlook at the property is con
sidered the best for the development
of a commercial body of ore of pertna- ,
nent character that has to this time
been entertaineal. Should the property
make g'xid it will give the district
probably a big low grade enterprise In
which the principal value will be gold,
with copper, lead and silver attending.
SMALL OPERATORS
NEAR GLOBE SHIP
ORE THROUGH STATE
Smelters' Closing in Globe
Miami District Cause Leas
ers and Small Mine Opera
tors to Ship to Other Reduc
tion Works.
CI-OItE, Ariz., July 21. While the
smelters of this district are closed
down the smaller pioducing properties
of the lt3ser companies and of leasers
in this and surrounding districts which
have continued operations are doing
much in keeping operating smelters
in other narts of the state going. This
Is true not only of the smaller opera
tors of mining properties here but all
over Arizona.
For many of these small operators
the situation is nothing short of a
bonanza windfall. For more than two
years they could edge in with their j
ores only now and then at the smelters i
because of the fact that the plants
were crowded to the limit with the
ores of their own mines and those of;
concerns for which they were doing
work und"r contracts. Ore buyers.
dodged the small producers. If they
shipped it was largely on chance. But
since the first of June the ore buyers
again find them of much interest and
their shipments go through without
delay. They are experiencing the
novelty, indeed, of pressure for ship
ments and are getting their ore out
with all the speed they can. The hay
makjng season is with them. Every
indication is that it will last until late
in the fall, and possibly well through
the winter. At the very best it is go
ing to be months before the big pr
ducers can get back to normal produc
tion and once more work their own
plants to fullest capacity on their own I
ores. There arc mining forces to re-1
construct, workings to bring back in'oj
efficient production form and an end;
less amount of small detail to pick up
and whip into line before the normal
can again be attained. The dropping
of a monkey-wrench in the mechanism
of a big mining organization is a ser
ious matter. Meantime the little fel
lows are alone in reaping benefits, no
other interests profiting a dollar. How-j
ever, with pressure put upon them ?:r' !
I he means thereby afforded them.!
through smelter returns, to push their
development as well as their produc
tion, some of the Hi tie ones are put
in excellent way to make big ones. It
!s an ill wind that blows no good.

WEEKLY NEWS LETTER YOUNG
HEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
Men's Department
Colonel Roosevelt in his character
istic vigorous manner, in a recent ad
dress' endorsing the work of the asso
ciation in their war work, said in part:
"The soldier Is a man of flesh and
bltood like ourselves and he has the
right to ask and expect that those of
us Vt home should do all that is in
our power for him when at the front.
There ought to be some agency which
would look after his recreational and
moral life when he is relieved from
the terrific strain of the trenches and
comes back from the fighting front for
a few days' rest and I am glad to
know that the Young Men's Christian
association is tackling this problem
and successfully meeting the needs of
the men at these times when they are
thrown in contact with tremendous
temptations. Tour association in its
usual wise and tactful way Is perform
ing a great patriotic duty in the cause
of humanity: and I believe it will be
a strong moral force in this great
world war. My chief interest, of
course, ntow is to see that the fighting
men get to the front. Real wisdom
lies in prompt action. I know that the
men of your organization are enlisting
in large numbers. It is the duty of
every man who Is fit and I am glad
to say that everyone tof my four sons
has enlisted."
The "Good Old Summer Days' is
the name of the latest publicity folder
just issued by the association and it is
surely a. work of art- The mechanical
work was done at the Review job of
fice and does credit to that department.
Free copies may be had at the busi
ness office. .

He wished to be remembered to his
many friends in the distrkt, who will
be glad to reciprocate his kindly
greetings.
The general secretary has just re
ceived a ctopy of the Columbus, N. M.,
weekly, forwarded by a friend, and
the following statement appears in
bold type at the top of the page:
' Striking miners are more welcome
than would be 1200 Cochise county,
Arizona, corporation deputies." Tt
columns of the paper takes occasion
to roast the Warren district citizens
and upholds the action of the departed
I. W. W.'s. It is the first paper thus
far to take such a view of the situation.
The McRae monument list of con
tributions is growing. One member of
the association subscribed not only for
himself but his wife and for each tof
his three children. The latest con
tribution was forwarded to the associa
tion yesterday by "Jack," the famous
Rhode Island Jew from Fort Huachuca.
Mrs. Richardson, wife of the general
secretary, has left Long Beach, where
she and young A. B. have been for the
past month, and gone to Pocaterro,
Idaho, the former home of the secre
tary They will remain their visiting
relatives and friends for several
weeks.
In spite of a world war, rumors of
war, focal adversities, etc., the asso
ciation breaks all previous records of
membership enrollment the roster
showing 1611 for the first day or July.

Tje Y. members are mighty glad to
see Mr. E. Hawes of Warren out on
the street again after a prolonged ill
ness of eight months. Here's to your
health. Mr. Hawes.
The two members of the association

Now that the strike trouble is over we
will be able to go over to Czar field
on Saturdays and have some 'real"
games.
Ntow is the time thatj will see who
has the real class. If you have not
signed up for any of the championship
tournaments "get in the game." There
will be competition in all sports so no
one will be left out. The most popular
thing in the tournament is the one in
swimming but the feeling is running
nigh about the tennis and billiards.
A certain "Gang" has been complain

being made in the schedules.
The following schedule for gymnas

force from now on until later notice:
Juniors Monday, Wednesday and

one hour in the gymnasium and 30
minutes in the big plunge.
Intermediate Tuesday, Thursday
and Saturday, from 3 to 4:30 p. m.,
:ie hour on the Czar ball fiield or in
the gymnasium and 30 minutes in the
plunge.
Seniors High school and employed
btoys may have access to the gymnss
ium at specified times, and will be en
titled to the use of gymnasium every
evening from 7 to 8 o'clock and the
swimming pool will be reserved for
their use from 8 to 8:30 each evening.
Something doing every minutes oi
the day is the new slogan of the btoys'
department under the leadership and
direction of the acting director, M.
Debenhand, and this loudly seconded
by "Happy" Adams, the jolly assistant.
Mr. Debenhand is holding down the
position pending the securing of a
new department head. Secretary
Richardson has several applications
for the place, under consideration but
wishes to try the men before employ

When he stooped down he could

felt any symptoms of the trouble

Vitolox is certainly a valuable
remedy when it comui to toning
up the system and making folks

IS KERENSKY TOLSTOY'S "STRONG MAN
FROM THE NORTH" WHO IS TO END WAR?
' Alcxs-'k-r lU'rensky.
Is Alexander Kerensky, Rus
sia's firey young chancellor,
the "new Napoleon" of Tolstoy's
famous prophecy, who is to end
the war and hold Europe in his
grip until 1925?
That- Kerensky is the figure
those coming was foretold by the
grjeat Russian novelist seven years
ago is the opinion of increasing
numbers of Russians. They point
to the tremendous achievements
of the young war minister, whose
impassioned speeches at the front
resulted in the launching of a big
offensive against the Austro-Ger-mans.
Count Tolstoy uttered his proph
ecy in 1910. He foresaw the sort
of a war that has overwhelmed
the world, and believed that it
would start in the Balkans, where
thelast war was fought in 1912.
A part of his prophecy follows:
"The great conflagration will
start about 1912, set by the torch
of war in the countries of south
eastern Europe. It will result in
a destructive calamity in 1913.
"In that year I see all Europe
in flames and bleeding. I hear
the lamentations of hugs battle
fields. But about the year 1915
a strange figure from the north
a new Napoleon enters the stage
of the bloody drama.
"He is a man of little military
training, a writer or a jurnalist,
but in his grip the most of Eu
rope will remain until 1925. The
end of the great .calamjty will
mark a new political era for the
Old World.
"There will be left no empires''
and kingdoms, but the world will
form a federation of the United
States of Nations. There will re
main only four great giants the
Anglo-Saxons, the Latins, the
Slavs, and the Mbngolians."
Those who maintain that Ke
rensky is the man of Tolstoy's
prophecy are not swayed from
this position by the fact that Tol
stoy's hero was to appear on the
the stage, "about. 1915". Tol
stoy missed a year or so in fixing
the date for the war's beginning.
It was very early in 1917 that
Kerensky assumed the reins of
power in Petrograd. Like Tol
stoy's promised deliverer, Keren
sky has had little military train
ing. "Kerenslcy Is the Lloyd-George
of the Russian revolution and
when I say that I say everything,"
declared Isaac F, Marcosson, the
American journalist, who was here
during the weeks when the revo
lutionary movement was at its
height. "If ever an individual in
a great crisis was a man of des
tiny, Kerensky is that man.
"A week before the revolution
broke out bis name was scarcely
known in Petrograd. Four days
after the city had ridden the red
tides of revolution his name was
on every tongue.
"To look at the man you would
imagine him to be a physical
wreck. His great eyes blaze out
of the setting of his sunken, pal
lid cheeks; he lives on his fervor
and on his nerves, collapsing like
a wet rag after every speech he
makes."
Boy Scouts Doing Splendid
Service In the Great War
The army of 251,1$) Boy Scouts ot
America, thoroughly organized and
disciplined, trained to obey orders
cheerfully and hardened to biking and
outdoor life and the physical exeri?jn
that comes in the soldier's life, has
already been called on by Uncle Sam
to take part in several campaigns.
Those that have not already ieea
brilliantly won are being driven for
ward successfully.
The first of these is the gardening
campaign under the battle-cry, "Every
Scout toFeed a Soldier." Thousands
bf Boy Scouts in thousands or Back
yards and vacant lots and on country
acres are nursing skyward the bean
stalks that will later on enable the
American army in France to enter the
"tight fed on the good old American
bean. The perishable articles of the
garden that the scouts will raise for
home consumption will release thou
sands of tons of grain for the soldiers
of the allies.
The Liberty loan campaign was an
other four-day battle pursued with
magnificent strategy and persistence.
So far, $18,661,000 in bond signatures
is recorded at national headquarters
as having been captured for Uncle
Sam. The Red Cross has had a faith
ful and efficient ally from the first in
the Boy Scout; and while no national
campaign hai been carried on by the
Boy Scouts' far tnis purpose, in hun
dreds of cities and t'jwns the country
over the troops have collected money
and have put up pound packages of
concentrated food and have parked
cases and have done other hard work '
brdinarily done by the men.
Fourth Campaign I the Hardest
The latest bugle call for service hus
been sounded by Mr. Herbert C.
Hoover, who now announces plans for
enrolling the women of the country in
the fc'jd administration, asking that
all rearrange their household metaoos
of living. The Boy acouls are askett
to assist in tabulating and checking
up all the homes, each house to make
a pledge and exhibit a window card
that it is following "jut the adminis
tration program.
All of this wonderful service cheer
fully performed by the Boy Scouts of
America will bring in a new vision
of scouting on the part l the general
public. It will mean further increased
responsibility on the part of scout
leaders to maintain the ideals of scout
ing as the membership of the organiza
tion increases by reaton of its broader
appeal. Registrations are now coming
in at an average rate of 1250 a day.
There are now 251,189 scouts, an in
crease since January 1 of over 50,000.

for 12 years Mr. Anderson was elected

He had occupied this office only a short
time when the sheriff of Harris county
died. Mr. Anderson's friends persuad

was easily elected. He was honored
with re-election seven different times
and served the people in this import

Four years ago Mr. Anderson declined
re-election and retired to private life.
He cast bis l'ot among the people of
Houston and is a large property own

"I was in a run-down condition,"
continued Mr. Anderson, "and had no

Buy your car as you would buy your home
tOOK at the buying of your car as you would look at
the buying of your home. You can find a house at
u almost any price you would care to pay. But there
are certain necessities you must have if that house is to be
a home. You wouldn't, for example, try to get along in
tiny, cramped up, uncomfortable rooms. Neither would
you live in a house with cheap plumbing, inferior wood
work, ill-fitting doors and rattling windows.
Without going into luxuries, there are certain neces
sities you must have to justify your calling your house a
home a place you will be proud to own.
It is the same with your car. It must have a certain
amount of size, roominess and wheel-base to make it
really comfortable and free you from the need of constant
apologies. It must have materials of a certain quality to
insure its lusting the proper time to justifyyour investment
in it. It irr.-rt have the proper weight to make it hold
the road. It must seat all its passengers in comfort.
You wouldn't buy a house that lacked the real neces
sities because it cost a few dollars less. Even so it is false
economy to buy a car that lacks the essentials of motoring
satisfaction because it is cheap to buy.
In the Series 18 Studebaker Cars you get all the
needed essentials of complete motoring satisfaction at the
lowest possible price. f
When you realize that Studebaker, one of the largest
producers of cars in the world, enjoying all the economies
of great production and great resources, makes a smaller
percentage of profit per car than the small car manufac- '
turers, it is obvious that Studebaker includes in its cars
those features that small cars must curtail; and quality,
both of material and workmanship, that you cannot
reasonably expect to find in small cars at their prices.
What is a small initial saving compared to a great sac
rifice? Be wise before you decide what car to buy see
the Studebaker. . i
Nearly every automobile manufacturer has made an
increase in prices, but Studebaker prices still remain the
same as they 'were last Spring. This further increases the
value of Studebaker cars in comparison with all others.
There will Ve no chane in Studebaker models thi3 year, but the ir r- ;so,i cost of materials
and labor may force Studebaker to make an advance in prices ?.t : . i :c. without notice.

cated about 1500 feet beyond its
resent face. The intervening country
as been prosieeted and proven by
leans of a number of vertical and in
line shafts and by several tunnels.
All Vf these workings are in ore hav
ing a value of from -8 to $14 gold per
ton. Where the spur and main ledges
join there is an ore shoot of really
phenomenal size. Samples taken
along the strike of this shoot at an ap
proximate depth of 100 feet gave a
gold content as high as J5fi0 per ton,
J with a minimum of $48.70 per ton.
Near-by the tunnel in which the sam
ples referred to were taken is the com
pany's nugget shaft. Some of the rich
est free gold float ever found in the
Weaver district was picked up below
this shaft. During the period when
"Andy" Peterson owned the gi'iund
he shipped approximately ' $12,000
worth of this rich float, and prior to
his ownership, away back in the '60s,
two Montana miners "high-graded"
the surface successfully until driven
out by the Apaches.
The Vulture mine has produced
about $30,000,000 worth of gold from
high grade ore bodies $50 per ton or
better and contains an enormous
tonnage of low grade ore that samples
from $8 to $14 per ton. Modem min
ing and milling processes have given
this ore a commercial value it did not
have during the dayB of expensive ex
traction and reduction methods. Rail
road facilities have likewise assisted
in cheapening the cost of ore produc
tion as against the hi;h cost at one
time attaching it 'he long and labor
ious freight haul across the desert by
mule team. AH of the important min
ing properties in the Weaver district
are connected by wagon rtad with the
Santa Fe, Prescott & Thoenix railway
at Congress Junction and thereby have
rapid transit freight facilities to the
smelters near Prescott, 40 miles dis
tant: to sampler at Wickenburs, 12
miles distant, and to Phoenix, 60 miles
distant
To illustrate the mining prosperity
at this time prevalent throughout the
Weaver district and elsewhere in
Yavapai county, the statement is
made that the business jf the Santa
Fe, Prescott &. Phoenix railway has
increased more than 50 per cent dur
ing the last 18 months. This road,
built by the late Frank M. Muhpry of
Prescott, with the object of affording
an ore outlet from the Con cress mine,
has since become an important factor
of the Santa Fe system, with which it
connects at Ash Fork on the north
and at Wickenburg on the south. By
means of this railroad or by other rail
transportation lin-s built by Mr. Mur
phy, all of the important mining dis
tricts of Yavapai county are brought
into direct toitcht with Prescott, the
county seat and business center.
The Congress mine is one of Mr.
Murphy's many notable achievements
in Arizona. With the financial aid of
the litfe "Damond J'Je" Reynolds he
developed it from a prospect into one
of the state's richest gold mines. It
has a production record of about $6,
000,000 worth of Vre and is yet con
sidered one of the most valuable gold
properties in the southwest There is
a largey tonnage of vari-grade ore
blocked out on the several levels.
Plans for the handling of this Vre and
for further development of the mine
were well advanced when the death of
Mr. Murphy in late June brought
them to a standstill. Just what dis
position will be made of the Congress
mine by the executors of his estate
has not as yet been announced. The
mine Is. however, too valuable long to
remain idle. Under new management
it is probable the property will be de
veloped to better purpose han Mr.
Murphy's failing health permitted.

supply data for an unique chapter in
the chronicle of Weaver district min
ing events. Although the beds of An
telnpe and Weaver reeks are highly
Buriferous, the summit of Rich Hill,
towering a thousand feet above them,
has yielded millions of dollars worth
of placer gold in nugget form. Many
of the nuggets found there have ! val
ue of $100 each, and in one instance
a nugget having a value in excess of
$ti00 was picked up on the highest
point of the hill. Many theories have
I been advanced as to how placer gold
' came to be deposited at so lofty an
' elevation, but the only tangible con
clusion the average person can glean
from them is that the gold is there be

There is sure to be a big movement
