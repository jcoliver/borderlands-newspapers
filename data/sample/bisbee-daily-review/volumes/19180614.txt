SENATE REFUSES
TO LIMIT DEBATE
,
WASHINGTON, June 13. The sen-
ate today refused to limit its debate
during the war.
After receiving Information that the
president had not urged its adoption,
the senate voted down. 41 to 34. a rule
proposed by Senator Underwood of
Alabama, to cut down senators'
speeches.
It spite f determined opposition
manifested during discussion, support -
- f h i had w confident nf
Its adoption. When the vote was tak-
lato todav hnwpvpr ripn I
en late today, however, a dozen demo-:
cratic senators unexpectedly joined the
majority of republicans opposing the
measure.
Defeat of the resolution leaves in
full force the cloture rule adopted a
year ago after the famous filibuster
on the armed ship bill. That rule pro
vides for restriction of debate if the
senate approves by a two-thirds vote !
a petition signed by sixteen members.
Before the final vote today, the sen
ate adopted.. 40 to 35, an amendment
by Senator Fall of New Mexico, repub
lican, providing that except by unan
imous consent the rule would not be
invoked during discussion of legisla
tion which had been considered by a
partisan caucus or conference of yie
majority in control cf the senate.
Various reasons were assigned to
night for the defeat of the resolution.
Prospective discussion of nation-wide'
prohibition and the application of tlui
rule t0 treaties as well as to legislation
were said to have been factors. Some I
members, however, believed that Sen-.
ator Underwood's explanation of the i
president's position was the deciding
influence. j
Mr. Underwood told the senate that i
the president had not urged the adop-1
tion of the rule taking the position that
he should not, interfere with the sen
ate's procedure. However, Mr. Wilson
did say, according to Senator Under
wood, (hat he believed adoption of thj
rule advisable should the senate view
the situation in the same light. Tha
votes follows: '

I WASHINGTON, June 13. Realign- !

which offered unpleasant possibilities. !j

garded with satisfaction. !
The movement, however, i3 viewed j
as marking a further step toward k i

believed to be the German purpose in

it is believed here the Germans will
not attempt to capture Comuiegene if

ent phase of operations will come to j
an end shortly unless thev make bet-
ter progress in the Montdidier-Autheiul I
sector and can flank the defenders out
of the whole Compiegene salient.
The stubborn French resistance to
the northwest is blocking flanking
operations on Compiegene from thu
direction while the check encountered j
northwest of Chateau Thierry where I
American marines have hit hard re-
pealedly and have stopped the enemy
in his tracks thus far has prevented an j
even greater flanking movement from
the' south that might have dislodged
the French defenders of Villers Cot
terets forest.
This southern movement is believed
to be of wider significance than the
operations the enemy was pressing to
day north of Villers Cotterets wood. If
it should berenewed successfully tne
fall of Compiegene and readjustment
of the whole line from Montdidier to
theregion of Chateau Thierry woul-I
rollow. in a long slow curve winmi;
the Picardy and Aisne theatres into

If observers here are correct in re-
gard to this as the real German pur-
pose, underlying both the Aisne of -
fensive and later developments around
the Compiegene salient, it is to be as -
sumed, it is said, that their further
conclusion that the main attack would 1
then be renewed, probably on the J
Montdidier-AIbert-Arras front, also Is ,
well founded.

During the day Mr. Ford had conferred with Senator William Alden

The Case of Finland
But few people have any idea of the real
state of affairs in Finland today or of the
events leading up to them. We read of the
White Guards and the Red Guards and of
how Finland bowed without resistance to
the German yoke. Now comes Santeri
Nuorteva, representative in the U. S. of the
; first Popple's Republic established in Fin
land after the Russian revolution, and
writes a most interesting and instructive ar
ticle for The Workingman, a Finnish paper
published in Wisconsin, in which he sets
forth the average Finn's side of the story.
G. Carlson, of Bisbee, who takes this paper,
called the Review's attention to the article
In the first place this Finnish narrator
declares that the workingmen's movement
had gained great headway in Finland, even
before the great war. They had organized
and forced universal suffrage and a gov
erning body in which the people should
have a part. The feud in Finland as far
back as te"'n years ago was b-tter between
the nobility and the middle classes. Ger
many's influence at that time was manifest
in Finland. The nobility were trained in
the German army and had Berlin leanings.
Well, when the revolution came the people
secured complete control of the govern
ment and the wealth of Finland and organ
ized the People's Republic 'above referred
to and sent this Santeri Nuorteva to this
country as its accredited representative.
Then the reaction resulted in the Bolshevik
uprising against the revolutionists in Rus
sia, and with this same movement came the
revolt of the autocracy and German-trained
army officers of Finland against the peo
ple's government. This opposition, accord
ing to the narrator, had no appreciable ef
fect at first. It organized the White Guard
and harrassed the country side, fleeing be
fore armed force.
Then the Germans took a hand. They
sent forty thousand men of the Prussian
war machine to Finland and, joining with
the White Guard, beat the People's Repub
lic armies in battle and siezed the govern
ment of Finland.
The deposed government then organ
ized the Red Guard and played about such
a part as the White Guard had played be
fore the Prussian grenadiers came with
their heavy artillery to enslaveanother na
tion. The narrator declares that all of the au
tocracy of Finland preferred German rule
under an imperial government to democ
racy under their own people. He declares
that the workers and middle classes gener
ally do not acept the German rule passiv
ely, but as a matter of necessity. "Our gov
ernment has been temporarily defeated,"
he says, "by the Finnish aristocracy in con
junction with the German army. But the
"fight is not ended. The great majority of
the Finnish people await the first oppor
tunity to drive out the German invaders,
and the day of reckoning will come soon."
Of course all this may be merely one side
of the question, but it gives a clear and ap
parently dispassionate, and certainly an
able Finnish view point of conditions in
this distracted land at this time. It may
well apply for all Russia. Certainly the
peoples of this once great and old empire
do not bow in complete resignation to the
German yoke. . Discontent, revolt and re
bellion surely seethes in every portion of
this torn and ravished land, ready to break
into flame at the least encouragement, or
under proper leadership.
But if Germany is allowed to remain in
control long enough she may be depended
upon to bend nad break and destroy all
nationa'l and race resistance to her sway.
A match might start a flame now, but in a
little while a torchlight procession could
not burn a cabin without suffering massa
cre at the hands of German troops.
Germany holds these Russian provinces,
and, in fact, all her conquests, much as Na
poleon held Spain and Portugal and the
German provinces of his day, which is to
say, by armed force, and the population re
belled against him at every opportunity
and harassed him constantly by means of
guerilla warfare.
It is now estimated that the United States
furnishes almost three-fourths of the ;Corn
crop of the world of 3,950,000 bushels, or
seventy-one percent, to be exact. Argen
tine comes next with only six percent, and
then Mexico and Austria with five each.
Neither Germany, France or England raise
enough corn to be mentioned in a table of
corn producing nations that give figures
down to as low as three percent in Italy.
Now, corn is next to wheat as the great food
product of the world for either man or
beast, hence America's fremendous power
as an ally, which Germany seems to have
eliminated entirely from her official calcu
ations cn our part in this war. Corn will
place a battery in action by furnishing pow
er to the artillery horses. Corn makes the
allied transport service move via the army
mule, who plays his part still, even though
gasoline has assumed so much of the bur
den. Corn bread will carry a soldier man
about as far and as strong as bacon or
wheat. Yes, and corn makes bacon. Now
at least half of our corn crop will go to our
army and our- allies. Half of this crop
would save Germany, from most of her
worries about food for man and provender
for beast. In fact, American cotton, corn,
copper and wheat each weigh in the scales
against the Prussian with the weight of an
army each in the great war. And next year
they will weigh heavier than they do now.
Cantigny, Chateau Thierry, Torcy and
Bouresches, these four names mark an
epoch in world affairs and will have a page
in history a thousand years hence ' all to
themselves. By these four glorious, crim
son doors did America enter the world con
flict in Europe. The new republic coming
back to save the mother countries from a
ruthless domination. The taking of these
four French towns from the Germans by
American troops is only the beginning. It
is not the numbers engaged or the magni
tude of the success, that makes the import
ance of these four names, but they form
the Boston tea party of the beginning. They,
serve to show American valor, speed and
efficiency in modern war when pitted
against the kaiser's best. They formed the
first test. Larger towns taken by and by;
greater victories gained, will not compare
to Cantigny and Chateau Thierry in the
importance of their bearing cn the great
war, for the great question, "What can the
Americans do?" has already been answered
at these four little villages, and the entire
world heard the answer and all posterity
will cherish it.
An eminent French admiral, writing for
a Paris publication upon the present phase
of the war, declares that "A formidable war
demands the cohesion of all elements, au
dacity, untiring activity, the boldest initi
ative, all this into one spirit of offensive."
He urges a bold attack by the allied navies
upon the submarine bases and a continu
ation of these attacks. Many allied mili
tary authorities are convinced that the only
way to combat the German offensive is to
launch a counter offensive somewhere
along the line upon a gigantic scale. There
is not the slightest doubt but that Germany
is holding many sectors with only a fringe
of men, drawing all the others away to
points where she elects to strike, and this
with supreme confidence that the allies will
not dare or cannot strike at these thinly
held points of the German line. So far this
reasoning has been correct. But this col
umn is convinced that Foch will yet strike.
Germany's idea of grim and deadly hu
mor is to -turn two submarines loose along
a coast line and sink some fifteen ships and
then declare That coast a danger zone and
warn neutral shipping. For Germany there
is no neutral shipping and never has been
since she perfected the submarine. Not a
nation in the world with a prow upon the
ocean but that has had ships sunk by
U-boats in disregard of all neutral rights
and precedents. It was this ruthless dis
regard of the rights of neutrals upon the
high seas that brought America into the
war. And now Germany would warn neu
trals that the Atlantic coast of America is
a danger zone. It is a colossal bluff, de
livered with the same Ud imperialistic
bluster.
Alaska is appealing to the states for help
in the way of labor for its mines, fisheries
and forests. Out of a white population of
sixty thousand it is said that six thousand
have gone to war.
Legislative Gossip
ISnecfnl r Th Rfvlowi
The house lias had a struggle with
the oerute council of defense hill
which il seems unwilling to accept
thought It , is a bit more considerate
of the governor than house bill
wuicn seems now the favorite, after
considerable amendment. The senate
provides for nine members of the ex
eciitive council, they are to be aoDoint
ed by the governor, no more than two
from any one county. The house meas
ure creates a small legislature of four
teen, to be appointed by the governor
after nomination of one from each of
the county boards of supervisors. Ten
members must have,such approval and
appointment before the council can
organize. The governor's coterie did
what they could to throw control of
the body into his hands, but made
small headway, except in the consump
tion of time. Mrs. McKay, harking
hack to Disbee, expressed a degree cf
horror over the nomination of a mem
ber by the chairman of the board of
supervisors now under indictment by
a leaeral grand jury and, incidentally
dared the enemies of the governor to
try the recall on him. Walton took
possibly a half hour in imploring the
house to "'cut out this monkeydoodel-
ing and get down to business" and per
tinently observed, " hy chew tne ra
over things that are not worth a hill
cf beans?" Mr. Walton insisted that
Governor Hunt had been elected by a
majority of the votes of Arizona, and
therefore should have no curtailmen
of his authority. Finally the measure
was given favorable report in commit
tee of the whole. A move to kill the
Horser administration council cf de
fense bill failed to carry, however.
Much of the day in the senate was
spent on the dairy bill, while the ren
ators drifted into a committee room
where their fortunes were told by a
( lever clerk, who discovered much in
Sutter's lfTe he had believed hidden.
The house also consumed a hour or
f-o on a similar bill, the. longest pre
sented this session. The matter may
te unloaded on the council of defense.
Lamar Cobb, former state engineer
and now candidate for the democratic.
poitr'naticn for governor, is on the trail
cf the statu. board of public institutions
and cf the att jrny general, held joint
ly liable for the manner in which the
engineer's office lofct its independence,
something that ir". to Cobb's resigna
tion and to the , -writing of a number
of caustic communications, addressed
to the t.overncr and attorney general
and to the c-oniiHiFsion. Now Cobb
has added another letter, this time ad
:lrssing the special session of the leg-
.-slature and suggesting the impeach
ment of Wiley E. Jones, who, he says,
"has been masquerading as attorney
general of Arizona for the past three
and one-half years." Cobb refers to
the Jones' opinion that followed ap
peal from the commission's decision
as one of "ridiculous absurdity." It
is alleged that the attorney general
not only refused to institute quo war
ranto proceedings against the commis
sion, but threatened the prosecution of
Cobb's lawyer or any other attorney
who might institute such a suit, Cobb
commenting that he feared judicial
review "for the truth of my indictment
tiiat he prostituted his high office to
purchase political favor and vent per
sonal spleen is too evident."
In a following paragraph, referring
to certain papers inclosed, Cobb avers,
"You will find contained therein a jug
gling with and a perversion of the law
by the attorney general that Is a dis
grace to the state, to the party that
nominated him and to the good people
who have been deceived by him.' It
is alleged that the stte department
are practically helpless to secure legal
assistance from the attorney general
and have been compelled to employ
other attorneys at additional public ex
pens?. Protest, therefore, is made
against the plan of naming him as a
member of the new ocunril of defense,
on which it is declared he would Ije as
useful as a vermiform appendix.
It is told that the attorney genersl
has announced his intention of using
physical violence upon Cobb, who an
nounces that such bluffs will not deter
him from bringing Jones' "before
gome bar of justice." In closing there
is expression of pride in the highway
organization built up by the former
engineer and of regret that his labors
have come to naught, "the department
disorganized and turned over to an in
experienced (to say the least) commis
sion with no proiessional pride in its
work, which will inevitable lead to
s'lupndering the road fund for political
uses, what Wiley E. Jones" public ca
reer may be prolonged."
For several days there has been in
timation that the commission of pu'-Ik-institutions
may strike back at Cobb
for .his irreverent handling of the com
mission's dignity- It may come in the
shape of an inquiry concerning Co!b's
action in drawing a check for 200
uptn the "enforced account" of the
highway division of the slate en
gineer's office, payable to Thos. W.
Nealon, a local attorney who repre
sented Cobb in the tight that is be-
ing continued against the commission.
This check, not denied by Cobb or
Nealon. was drawn a few days belonj
Cobb lett the state engineer's oft ic e.
The practice lias been to cover such
emergency chocks by means of a war
rant audiied on the general road fund.
This warrant has not been approved
by the commission ad there is intim
ation that it will not be. Cobb defends
his action as a legal and oflitial one
and cites the instance where a lawyer's
fee of Jl.iiliO was paid from several
ft?te funds, several years ago, when
a number of,stato officials employed
Geo. J. Stoneman to prosecute their
claims against the state, when the
auditor hesitated because the legisla
ture had lailed to pass an impropria
tion bill before adournment. Cobl)
states ho wlir welcome a judicial re
view, as affording him an opportunity
in court with the commistion.
There is a likelihood that the people
will be called upon this tall to vote
again on the initialed law now in tvicft
prohibiting the lotting of contrai ls on
public works, something passed wit.i
the Kiipiuirt of the liilnir interests. The
I matter new is of keener interest in
I view of the pending construction of

lol If t!.e addition is elected hy day

Ifiank adat.-sinn that the tress cast
w ill be very luuch over the sum set.
A member of the commission of public
institutions is to be quoted as statins
that this "force account" work costs
at least ,30 per cent more than under
contract, and for no better work. A
job at the state insane asylum for
which a Phoenix firm bid $21.ii0, with
expectation of good profit, is said to
liave cost $36.0(10 under the day labor
system. There Is criticism of the way
that costs are piling up in the new
construction work at the normal school
at Tempe. Some figures are being col
lected to show that this socialistic ex
periment has been very expensive to
the taxpayers and has really militated
against the construction of public
buildings, at least leading to smaller
buildings or poorer construction, to
keep within specific appropriations. A
bill for a referendum now is ready for
submission to the legislature, bur, with
the cpi.osition of the solid minority in
each house, can hardly expect passage
if the session last no longer than a
week.
Frony the attorney general's office
has come a definition of the difference
between tweedledum and tweedledee.
It is affirmed that the legislature un
der the governor's call may consider
nothing outside of the call except in
the way of referendums of constitu
tional amendments. Initiation ct bills
for submission is not covered. But a
late derision of Wiley Jones seems to
leave the matter rather in the air, in
ferring that legality of any si;ch legis
lative action would have to be sub
mitted to the courts, anyway.
The attorney general's office has de
cided that it will do no harm for the
legislature to initiate a popular bill
for submission of the capital puniso
icent question. Tlio capital punish
ment petition was circulated in the lob
bies and received many signatur-s. Ac
tion suggested by the legislature, on
the lines of a bill that has passed the
house already, simply will complete
the necessary action, according to the
attorney general, making everything
rnmnlete without necessity lor con
sideration by the regular legislative
session next winter. It will be all
right for the electors to vote for both
measures on the ballot. It is notable
that little opposition to the measuie
has appeared. The senate ki'ucd iu
capital nunishnient bill merely because
it was not considered within tae pur
view of the call.

tion on the Marsh patriotic resolution.

Airs. Mann is the mother of fourteen
children and altnougn sixty-one years
of age, she Bays she teels many years
younger now. Continuing, sh said:
"I commenced Buttering witn stom
ach troume sixteen years ago and grad
ually kept getting worse until seven
or eight years ago, when I had a sped
that laid me up ior nine or ten weeks.
I simply suffered agony trom then on.
I began having such terrible pains in
.i i ,n rf v iilnino rY at t f i ti u I h.1 f
iTould hardly stand it. I wou!d get !
in all kinds of positions trying to get
some ease, but the only way I could
get any relief was to lay bard on my
stomach, and for two weeks I never
slept two hours a nighf. I was under
treatment several times, and tried all
kinds ot medicines, and still got no
relief and when they told me 1 could
never get well without an operation I
felt that my trouble must be very se
rious
I used to weigh one hundred and :
seventy-five pounds but I kept falling j
off until I got to be very thin. When
. . l
months ago I just weighed one hu:i-
died and twenty-five pounds, but now j
I weigh one hundred and fifty have j
gained twenty-five pounds and am
stil gaining. I can eat most anything
I want without it hurting me and I
seldom ever have a pain of any kind.
I feel almost like a girl again and
while I am sixty-one years of age I can
do as much house work as lots of wo-1
men who are much younger than I am.
I certainly do give Tanlac all credit
for my wonderful improvement and am
willing to tell evorybody what I think
of it."

THE WEATHER.
Citizens of the Warren district have
been complaining of the heat during
the present week but they really have
nothing to complain of in comparison
to what it has been in other parts of
Arizona. The maximum reached so
far this summer was yesterday after
noon when it reached 97. Wednesday
it was 95 and Monday and Tuesday it
was 94. At Phoenix on two days the
present week it reached J14. Needles
reported 122. Tucson 105. Douglas
101. There has not been a day so far
but what there has been a breeze,
blowing so that it made it much better
than a close sultry day. Rain clouds
have been gathering the past few days
and it begins to look as though we
would get a shower, which means a
lowering of the temperature.

The Phelps Dodge Mercantile com-

I their methods of soliciting and charg
ing orders. h .
, In many places the practice of send
i ing out solicitors to take grocery or
ders, has been entirely discontinued. '
but the Phelps Dodge Mercantile com
'pany will not do this unless obliged to

I Because of the hilly nature of the
j Warren mining district and the fact
that only about one-twelfth of the fam
ilies have telephonies a real hardship
I would be imposed on many people if
i they were obliged to gfi to the store
j to place their orders personally, but ,
! by ordering a little more three times a
jweek Instead of small quantities six

i solicitors will not be necessary for the
present.
The custom of "First of the month" I
orders is an old one and peculiar only
