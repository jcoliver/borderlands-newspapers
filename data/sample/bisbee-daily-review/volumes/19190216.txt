("Br Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 President
Wilson today cabled a request to the
foreign relations committee of con
gress to defer debate on tbe constitu
tion of the proposed league of nations
until be had an opportunity to go over
it "article by article" with the mem
bers. "There la a good and sufficient rea
son for the phraseology and substance
of each article," declared the presi
dent in "his message transmitted i
through Secretary Tumulty.
Members of the senate and house
committees will dine at the White
House 6n February 26, the day after
the president Is expected to land at
Boston. This early meeting was inter
preted as of the president's determi
nation to get the details of the new
world federation for peace before con
gress as quickly as possible.
No Date Named
The cabled invitation did not name
a date for the conference but almost
immediately the time was announced
and this was taken to mean that the
president would proceed here direct
from Boston after an address in that
city.
The president's message, datec
Paris, February 14, follows:
"Last night the committee ot the
conference charged with the duty of
drafting a constitution for a league
of nations concluded its work and
this afternoon before leaving for the
United States, it is to be my privilege
and duty to read to a plenary session
of the conference the text of the 26
articles agreed upon by the commit
tee. "The committee which drafted
these articles was fairly representa
tive of the world. Besides the repre
sentatives of the United States, Great
Britain, France, Italy and Japan, rep
resentatives of Belgium, Serbia,
China, Greece. Rumania, Czecbo-Slo-vakia,
Poland, Brazil, Portugal, active
ly participated in the debate and as
sisted materially in the drafting of
this constitution. Each article was
passed only after the most careful
examination by each member of the
committee. There is a good and suf
ficient reason for the phraseology and
substance of each-article. I request
that I be permitted to go over with
you article by article the constitution
before this part of the work of the
conference is made the subject of de
bate of congress. With this in view
I request that you dine with me at
the White House as soon after I arrive
In United States as my engagements
permit."
Senator Lauds Plan
Chairman Hitchcock of the senate
foreign relations committee, expressed
much gratification when advised to
night of President Wilson's plans for
consultation with the senate and
house committee.
"In this manner, both democratic
and republican members of the com-J
mittee will be able to exchange views ;
with the president." said Mr. Hitch-!
cock. "He will come fresh from the
scene, with impressions and, very
probably, information which will be of
Immense value in a consideration of
the league's constitution. I think the
conferences will be of great value."

ATTACK LAUNCHED
Poindexter Assails Constitu
tion, Making 4 Articles
His Target '
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15. Vigorous j
attack on four articles of the league' of
nations' constitution those providing
for disarmament, arbitration, supervi
sion of the munitions trade and for
mandatories of foreign countries was
made by Senator Poindexter, of Wash
ington, Republican, in a statement to
night. He declared the disarmament
and munitions trade paragraphs were
unconstitutional, the arbitration pro
vision "unconscionable," and the
clause for mandatories and others ab
horrent. Regarding the eighth article of the
constitution on disarmament Senator
Poindexter said:
"This provision transfers to the
league the sovereignty prerogatives of
the individual nations. The provision
is unconstitutional and an impairment
if the sovereignty and independence
of this country. There is no power in
the preside, nor in the senate, nor in
congress itself, nor in all combined,
to transfer in this" way the sovereign
power of the nation."
Referring to press reports of adop
tion by Germany of an army conscrip- j
tion policy. Senator Poindexter de
plored disarmament while Germany
was taking military measures of her
own.
Article 12 of the constitution pro
viding for arbitration and suspension
of war for three montns aHer the
league acts. Senator Poindexter de
clared, "would put under control of
foreign powers every question which
might affect our independence, safety,
honor or existence."
"It is unconscionable and the Amer
ican people will never understanding
ly ratify it." he said, "and if ratified
it would never be and could never
be kept in the face of an attack upon
our vital interests."
Declaring unconstitutional article 18
for supervision of nations' munitions
trade. Senator Poindexter said:
."Furthermore, it is abhorrent to the
aelf-respect of the United States anfi
a surrender of our sovereignty. It
cannot be supposed that the United
States has reached such a condition of
imbecility that it must have a guard
ian appointed for it to control its in-
ternational and domestic affairs. It is
curious that such a proposition should
even receive consideration."
Article 19 providing for mandator
ies over foreign countries, Senator
Poindexter said, would require use
of American naval and' military force
in various parts of the world at enorm
ous expense and possible loss of life'.

ON BOARD THE U. S. S. GEORGE
WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (By wireless
to the Associated Press). President
Wilson has nominated Hugh C. Wall
ace of Seattle, ambassador to France,
to fill the vacancy causer by the res
ignation of William Graves Sharp.
This was the first official act of the
president on his homeward journey.
The president also dispatched tele
gram'3 arranging for brief ceremonies
in connection with the speech which
he expects to make at Boston on Feb
ruary 24.
President Wilson spent the day rest
ing from the strenuous exertions
which marked his last few days in
Paris.
The steamer Ss heading for the
southern route in fair weather. The
escorting French warships signalled
farewell soon after leaving Erest, and
the United States dreadnaught New
Mexico and" several destroyers will
be the escort of the George Wash
ington until the Azores are reached.
At the Azores the ship will be net by
numerous American destroyers and
convoyed home.
Despite the hard work which he
will engage in during his brief stay
in the United States, the president is
already planning to begin his return
journy to France immediately after
the adjournment of congress. It is
expected that he will select a succes
sor to Thomas WT. Gregory in the at
torney generalship of the United
States, before the ship reaches home
waters.
Wallace Is Close
Friend of Wilson
WASHINGTON'. Feb. 15. The wire
less dispatch tonight from the George
Washington was the first public in
timation that Hugh C. Wallace had
been selected by President Wilson as
ambassador to France. It is under
stood that officials knew the appoint
ment was probable, but Mr. Wallace's
name was never mentioned during all
the speculation as to Ambassador
Sharp's successor. In some quarters
it had been accepted as certain that
Vance McCormick, former chairman of
the democratic national committee,
would he named.
Mr. Wallace, who spends much ot
his time here, is a close friend of
President Wilson and often has par
ticipated in confidential conferences
at the White House. Soon after this
country entered the war he was sent
to London by the president on a
personal mission, and it is known that
the president has the utmost confi
dence in his judgment and ability in
handling important and delicate mat
ters.
Except as a member of the demo
cratic national committee and an ac
tive worker in a number of presi
dential campaigns, Mr. Wallace has
not taken an active hand in politics.
The only public office he ever held
was receiver of public moneys for
Utah by appointment of President
Cleveland, 18S5-86. He was a delegate
at large from the state of Washington
to the Baltimore convention which
nominated President Wilson and has
since been one of the president's most
ardent supporters.
Mr. Wallace, a native of Lexington,
Mo., celebrated his 56 birthday this
week. His wife is a daughter of the
late chief Justice Melville W. Fuller
of the supreme court and for a num
ber of years they have maintained
homes here and in Tacoma, Wash.

Parliamentary Tactics to Be

(Bv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Feb. 15. Defeat
through parliamentary tactics of pro
; posed legislation of the house military
committee authorizing organization of
' a temporary army of a half million
; men for the year beginning next July,
,'was indicated tonight in. the house.
Representative Humphreys of Mis
sissippi, Democrat, gave notice that he
would make a point of order against
the army organization provision on the
ground that it is legislation and has
no place in an appropriation bill. Ex-
' pecting the defeat through this move,
a Republican member of the military
corftmjttee, submitted a substitute pro-
; poa'al, which hf said, had the approval
1 of several members of 4the military
committee.
The fight on army reorganization
will come before the house next week
when work on the military bill is ret
sumed late Monday or Tuesday after
completion of the unanimous consent
During consideration of the bill to
night the house adopted without ob
jection an amendment proposed by the
military committee appropriating $4,-

bers for. attending drills. Other pro-.
visions relating to the guard, includ
ing that contemplating organization of
a force of 105,000 guardsmen under
the national defense act of 1916 and
appropriations aggregating $10,163,000
in addition to the amount added for
drill pay were approved without dis
sent. Efforts by Representative Frearf

of the appropriation items reduced be

were voted down, with the exception
of cutting iry half the $4,000,00 appro
priation for maintenance of barracs
and quarters of the Coast Artillery.
Various provisions permitting building
construction by various war depart
ment bureaus also were eliminated. An
amendment was adopted requiring the
use of the army automooiles only for
business purposes.
Representative Johnson of South
Dakota, Republican, who served as an
lofficer with the American forces
abroad, condemned the court martial
system and sought to have the house
adopt as a rider to the appropriation
measure the proposal of Senator
Chamberlain, providing for the revi
sion of court martial procedure.
Represenative Gordon of Ohio, a
j Democratic member of the military
committee, defeated Mr. Johnson's
proposal on a point of order.

"The administration will never
get through hearing about the
refusal to allow congress to
censider this amendment, design
to protect men in the army,"
declared Mr. Johnson when the point
of order was made against his pro

Leon Bourgeois, on Behalf of France, Expresses Gratitude
to Wilson for His Guidance
(l-y K view Leaned Wire)
PARIS, Feb. 15. In presenting the j
views at- France regarding the cove- j
nant of the league'of nations at- yes-1
terday's plenary session of the peace
m r 1 . . : v. '
representative .on the . commission
which framed the covenant, spoke as
follows: . -
"I rise to express the deep satisfac
tion of all, and of France more -than j
any other country, because she-is ;
among the countries who have most!
suffered, to see the unity of our will3 j
add of our hearts in a passionate ad
hesion to the principles of the league
of nations. That act of faith we shall
do in a spirit of cordiality and .good
will that has been that of the commit- i
tee. Under the eminent chairman-;
fhip of President Wilson the commit-!
tee has worked with all their beaits:
to attain- this preat object . . . . 1
We have established a certain number '
of judicial principles and Internation-'
al organizations binding the states to
gether, binding them to a common (
work and binding them to a true; '
without which their common develop-
-' merit -would be impossible. : . -i
. The foundation now is laid and we j
are certain that the organization 'willj
be multiplied and will help humanity
more and more to attain its common ;
aims.
"We have been unanimous in pro
claiming these principles and we have ;
felt the force of these principles so J
much that we have no doubt that a i
strong light win penetrate even intoj
the darkest parts, that the light radi-1
ating from those principles will find j
its way into -lands that seem to be!
the least open to it.
Plan Simple and Clear . j
' But it is not enough to proclaim
such great principles. We must or j
gtn:ze a system of guarantee and a
system of action, both judicial and i
practical. The plan laid dovrn is a j
clear and simple one. There Is a coun
cil, where all the states are repre-!
seined equally, each having only one j
vote, and-there is an. executive com-j
mittce, which is constituted on a dif-1
ferent principle. But even in this cae, j
where it has been found necessary for'
purposes of action to give five votes
to the larger powers, the principle of'
equality has been secured by giving as
much as Tour votes to the smaller I
states. Respect for the decision given !
by that body was assured by definite I
lules. the violation of which shall be
considered as an act of war asainst
all the . contracting- states. If one
state it may be smallest and most Ye-j
mote of all the statesj is attacrd I
without justification, then the whole!
of the leasue of nations is being at-!
tacked, and will resist.
"But we must go further. In order !
to net-are the execution of internation-!
al sentences there niusl be a limita-!
lion of armaments. This has been the !
wish of the world foe a great many
years. What was formerly so difficult
has today become possible. Our vic
tory has made it possible. lxrano it
has enabled us to disarm the barbaric
force that was in the way of such an !
improvement. I
Armament Limitations i
"That limitation must be such that j
"u ciu oc capaDie or prevailing!
asl"!i- me win ot tne law of nations,
but at the same time each state should
1; strong enough to contribute to the
force that w ill enable the league of
nations to Impose its will. There has
been unanimity upon all these Dnint
"There are one or two Doints unnn
which I wish particularly to insist.'
wcauhe mey are connected with dan
gers that miy be of special moment to
some of us. dangers that may arise
not equal for all.
"There are special dangers for coun
tries like France. Belgium. Serhhi nnH
the new states that are in the stage of j
formation in central Europe.: It is j
necessary to give them special guar-j
- an tees and this has been recognized
, by the committee, when it states that!
special account should be taken of the
that have given occasion for important
observation should be mentioned.
. Proposed Amendment .
" "Here is a second point. Take a
state that violates the international
covenant. That state is supposed to
be in a state of war against all the
members of the league, and-all are
prepared , to compel it to execute its
obligations. But-war is not something
that ean proceed at once; especially
when the question is how to bring together;-forces
belonging to . states
which are very , different from, each
other and may be at the four corners
of the world. Each nation will have-to
wait In-order-to act until a certain
procedure is gone through and until
for each, particular-nation a vote has
been taken by. its parliament and 60
on. This means time and delay.
"And, supposing that there is on
the. part of the aggressor a will to
precipitate a situation, then we mast
provide for the possibility." For this
purpose it would be desirable to haye
all the means of. resistance studied,
and concerted action prepared -before
the occasion arises. This would be he
best check against any iil-design. ' '
"If the would-be aggressor Xnows
that .- resistance is fully prepared
against anjr action such as he contem
plates, then he will be restrained.
WTiere, on the other hand, he knows
that no such preparation exists and
that sudden action on his part would
encounter "no- "prepared and well
thoutht-out resistance, perhaps ;he
would" not be restrained; and it would
be extremely dangerous. ' .
"If; yon do not wish. to see the ter
rible ordeal through, which the world
has passed renewed in the future, we
ought to have a. permanent organiza
tion to prepare the military and naval
means, of execution and make them
ready in case of emergency.
Act With One Heart
"This has been objected to by some
of the members of the committee, be
cause it involved some difficult con
stitutional problems. This is why we
have agreed to the text without that
amendment, but we think the prin
ciple of that proposed amendment
ought to be put before public opinion
at the, same time as the scheme to
which -we have agreed. "
"I hope that no one, either here or
anywhere- in the world, will be mistak
en about my intention. I will not say,
and I have not said, a word that could
weaken the feeling of our complete
and hearty unanimity. We have acted
with one heart for the" triumph of the
cause .which is that of our conference,
the .cause of right against violence,
the cause of right against might. We
believe that this scheme that is now
before us is an excellent one. We be
lieve in Its virtues" and its possibili
ties. - The observation we have made
on some point's will, we hope, be cf
some value' in the further discussions,
since we are at the beginning of the
examination of the whole plan.
"Now we must, at the end, express
our deep gartitude toward our col
leagues, and our deep gratitude to
ward President Wilson, who presided
over our labors in such a competent
way and with .such high spirit, and
we wish still more to express the sin
cere with of France to see that the
great pact becomes, possibly with
some improvement on the -two points I
have mentioned, the law of nations."

Business at Washington
President Wilson, as sorely as he may be needed in Europe, is
needed even more urgently right at home. Ever since he departed, on
his mission in France, congress has evidenced a' lack of leadership.
Concerted action has been a negligible quantity in. both houses, and
little more than debate and partisian politics have resulted from their
deliberations since the departure of the president.
Past indifference to needed legislation and to matters of pressing
importance culminated in the greatest farce of the present session of
congress yesterday on the floor of tha senate, when partisan lines were
drawn to prevent the discussion of reconstruction problems and to force
consideration of the rivers and harbors measure with proposed appropri
ations of four hillions. "
Congress has conducted itself similarly before in the past two years.
On several occasions it has been necessary for the president to assume
the whip and bring the members back into the traces. But in none
of Its deliberations has it paid so little attention to matters of import
ance and so much to matters of triteness as during the past six weeks.
Perhaps their attitude explains opposition by some senators to the
president's trip to Europe they may have foreseen just this difficulty.
At any rate, congress needs a leader now as never before.
Who Says So?
v
'e quote from Senate Joint Memorial No. 5, introduced in the state
senate by Senator Claypool, (at the request of the Phoenix Central Labor
Council).
"It is well known that during the management of said railroads by
the government, officials of said railroads have insidiously abused the
confidence reposed in -them by Intentionally giving inefficient service
and deliberately creating the misapprehension in the mind of the public
that such inefficiency is due to public ownership . . .
The memorial is addressed to the congress of the United States, and
urges the government to take over and permanently control railroads of
the country- ,
But, by whom is it well known that these conditions exist?
Who says so?
Not the retired director general of the railroads, William Gibbs
McAdoo.' His testimony in his annual report in every public utterance
has been that the railroad officials have given the utmost co-operation
and assistance to the government in, making service as good as pos
sible. Not Director General Hines, Mr. McAdoo's successor, who has uttered
praise of the railroad, managements for co-operation and efficiency simi
lar in tone and character to Mr. McAdoo's.
Not the railroad managers; nor any authoritative representative of
the United States Railroad administration or the government
Who knows that these conditions exist?
We ail know the old woman gossip, who starts her tale with "They
say . . . and so forth."
Meet the same gossip again, in new raiment and costume.

I beg to add another voice to echo
the congratulatory speeches that have
been made on the presentation of a
document which is. perhaps, the most
important document that has been
compiled by men. Great leaders with

great movement, a movement involv
ing intricate problems of divers na
nations, and they deserve the grati
tude of their fellow men for success

most effective instrument for the
maintenance of the peace of the world.
Their names will be written indelib

will be the grateful acknowledgement
of humanity for their labor.
"As I understand it there is to te
no discussion of the project before us.
I will limit myself to these few re
marks., ob.servins that at a later stage
in the discussion of this project I
will have the privilege of addressing
certain propositions which I hope will

sideration from the distinguished ino.i

FOUR-TEAM BASEBALL
LEAGUE FOR WARREN
IS BELIEVED ASSURED
Games Each Saturday and
Sunday Planned; Douglas
to Have Nine
Ti.ai the four team league for the
Warren district, with games each Sat
urday and Sunday will become a fact,
is rumored among baseball fans of this
district. Douglas and Cananea. and.
according to retorts reaching Bisbee
during the past week from the Smelter
City and the Sonora camp, arrange
ments are already on foot in these
camps for fast and permanent nines.
Local fans at tae same time are work
in? for the formation of the local
teams.
Plans for the leagce include two
teams from this district, one from
liouslas and one from Cananea.
The Phelps Dodsre corporation and the
Calumet and Arizona are expected to
organize the Warren District nines.
In the Border city it is expected the
nine will be organized from men re
cruited ia the two smelters. In Can
anea employes of the various mines,
offices and other departments are
planning gathering together their tal
ent to get into the circuit.
Reports which reached Bisbee dur
ing last week from Douglas indicate
that already several good players have
signed and that the two smelters are
gathering in some of the best men
now at liberty both in Texas and Cali
fornia. From Cananea comes word
that several baseball players have re
cently been recruited from Class C
organizations and will soon report for
the season. Members of the last year
organizations in Bisbee and this dis
trict are fast getting together for
their participation n the games.
Meantime interest Is "added to the
organization of mines by the an
nouncement that a team composed of
players now in the district will prob
ably meet the Chicago White Sox
when that organization makes its
spring tour through this part of the
country. The Sox have already signed
with Tucson, where they play two
games with, the University of Arizona.
Douglas is making arrangements for
an exhibition with the champs, and de
tails looking toward a date for this
district are now being worked out.
Anticipation that Tucson might or
ganize one or two teams to take part
in the proposed league for the south
ern tier of the state, have in mate
rialized. Friends of the sport in the
Oil Pueblo, who had undertaken to
arouse interest in the league, have not
met with huge success, and it is now
felt that Tucson may be counted out
of the final circuit.

In marked contrast with conditions
prevailing during the previous year,
the copper indatry of Arizona was
practically free from labor disturb
ances in ISIS. This most desirable
result vas to a large extent due to the
able and intelligent control and super
vision exercised by Hyweil Davies and

The production in Arizona for 1918
(the month of December being esti
mated) will probably attain the . high
figure of 760,000.000 pounds or ap
proximately 100,000,000 pounds more
than in the previous year.
The 23 Vx cent price agreed upon
between the copper producers and the
price fixing committee on September
21, 1917, remained in force until Jury,
19 IS, when an increase of 2 cents
per pound was permitted, to take care
of Increased costs created by the
raise in freight rates and higher tolls
demanded by the refiners. A wage
Increase, amounting to 75 cents per
day, was also at that time granted to
all classes of labor in the industry, as
a compensation for the increased cost
of living. The average copper quota
tion for the year, will, therefore, ap
proximate 24 cents per pound less
than In 1917; though the cost or pro
- auction, owing to the aboTe factors,
together with marked decrease in la
bor efficiency. Increased greatly.
Strikes Retarded Output
The most notable contributors to
the grand total for the year are the
Ne Cornelia, which completed its
first calendar year of regular opera
tion; the Inspiration; the United
Verde, the Miami and the Phelps
Dodge corporation, all of which were
retarded in 1917 by strikes which pre
vented their attaining maximum out
put. Certain other large producers
showed small decreases, due to local
conditions which did not affect the
industry as a whole. The new smelt
ery of the United Verde in the Je
rome district, was placed in operation
in July, and thereafter that company
treated all its own ores and ceased
shipments to the customs smelters.
Development Work Postponed
For the first time in many years it
is not possible to report new additions
to the number of the larger mines,
nor is there immediate prospects of
any accessions to the list of important
copper producers in the state.
For the last four years every prop
erty has been pushed to its capacity
to get out the maximum tonnage of ore
and thus has been compelled to neg
lect or postpone its development and
exploratory work os that it is prob
able that with, the pressure removed
the metal production in 1919 will show
a very material decrease. Inability to
obtain material for construction or re-
pairs has seriously affected the effi
ciency of the plants, and it will prob
ably take at least six months or a
year of heavy expenditures of capital
and labor to restore their physical
conditionto that of the pre-war period,
both above and below ground.
Good Demand Expected
With the prospect of arecord
breaking demand for the red metal
within the next few months, or when
satisfactory financing has been ar
ranged, the present situation is ideal
to bring operating conditions to a
standardw hich will permit of maxi
mum output within a reasonable time.
Producing, tse he United States does
nearly 80 per cent of the copper sup
ply of the world, the country will be
called upon to furnish the require
ments not only of the domestic mar
ket, but of the large tonnage which
will be needed for the rehabilitation of
the industrial sections of northern
France and Belgium, if. as is estimat
ed. 80 per cent of the copper produc
tion in the last three years has en
tered into ten manufacture of essen
tially war material, the majority 'of
whlc has been only 20 per cent appli
cable to the peace industries of the
world. It is obvious therefore, that to
furnish the necessary supply for nor
mal industrial requirements, replace
ments and deferred extensions, the
mines of the world can be called upon
in the near future for an output that
will be inadequate to meet the bs
mand. With an Improved labor supply and
a reasonable time in which to pre
pare. Arizona mines can be confident
ly counted upon for an increased out
put of copper for many years.
LARGER FORGE AT
Kill SHAFT
Considerable Development
and Exploration Work
Is Planned
Further laying off of men in large
numbers by the Calumet & Arizona
Mining company, is not expected at
this time. On the other hand, work at
the Junction and Briggs shaft 3 of the
company will be concentrated upon
with forces slightly larger than at
present. This will be particularly the
case at the Junction where consider
able development and exploration
work has been mapped out.
The 1400 level at the Junction has
passed through the oxidized zone, but
evidence of existence or an ore body
between the east side of the crosscut
and the west line of the Denn-Arizona
mine is abundant and this will be de
veloped in course of the next few
months.

MEET TOMORROW
International co-operation in mining
In North America will be one of the
principal topics to be discussed at the
119th meeting of the American Insti
tute of Mining Engineers, to be held
in New York February 17 to 20. In
the course of the convention two joint
sessions with the Canadian Mining In
stitute and one joint session with the
American Institute of Electrical Engi
neers Will be held. A number of
prominent members of the Canadian
institute will be present.
Improving the relations of canital
and labor and the possibility of a pni
form mining law for North America
will be among the principal subjects
which the Canadian engineers will dis
cuss with the American institute.
Many of these topics will deal with
after-thewar problems of great signifi
cance to American business. Three of
the four days of the convention will
be devoted to business and technical
sessions with entertainment features
in the evenings, and the fourth day
will be given over to an excursion to
the federal shipyards at Newark bay,
where the first electric-welded ship is
being built. The subject of electric
welding is one of the principal ones
to be taken up by the American Insti
tute of Electrical Engineers in joint
session with the mining engineers on
Wednesday, February 19.
Some of the features of this year's
meetings will be: An evening enter
tainment; visit to the Metropolitan
Museum of Art and Senator Clark's
art gallery; a matinee, a reception of
the president and the annual banquet.
The committee in charge of arrange
ments for the 119th meeting include
the following: Allen H. Rodgers,

Altogether there are now 25 houses
under course of construction in the
Third addition to Warren, and plans
and specifications are being drawnip
to erect many more. Most of the
buildings will be occupied by miners
who selected the lots and then have
the house built by the company un
der the terms of the contract.
The frame work on six houses has
been completed and these will be oc
cupied by the following men: S. P.
Jones, Chas. Mlrriel. J. S. Hughes,

THIS IS LABOR PROGRAM
BEFORE PEACE CONFERENCE
By H. E. BECTOL
European Manager of N. E. A.
PARIS. France, Feb. S Delegates of
the five big nations which dominate
the peace congress are thoroughly
awake to the necessity for putting
through a broad international labor
program.
The committee which has been as
signed to this phase of the work of
the peace congress is confident that
the peace treaty will contain these
declarations:
For eight-hour day.
Free assemblage and free speech.
The right o organize.
That human labor is not an article
of commerce.
Seamen's right to leave vessels.
Against child labor.
They expect the congress will call

Can you imagine how happy you
would be if you had been- told that
somebody you loved had died, and
then learned that if was not true; that
he wag alive? -
WelL that is the happiness which
has come to many an American home
recently, for boys who have been re
ported dead "over there" are showing
up alive.
They weren't killed at all. Merely
mistaken identity. Wrong identifica
tion numbers cabled across, or some
other horrible mistake made in the
report.
The other day, while I was comb
ing the war department to find out if
a man reported "dead of wounds re
ceived in action" really was dead, for
he had been seen and heard from since
the war ended, I ran across instances
of similar reports which had saddened
lives of loved ones and had proven
untrue,
Pvt. August Heusser went over from
Kensington, Pa., last June, Some
weeks ago Mrs. Heusser received a
communication from the war depart
ment which told her her husband had
been killed in action September 26.
Last week the telephone rang in
the Heusser home. Mrs. Heusser took
down the receiver. It was a long-distance
call.
Is that you, Audria?" asked a voice
which thrilled her and startled her.
"It's L August."
"Oh, Tm so glad, for I was noti
fied that you had been killed. Pri
vate Heusser was speaking from Camp
Dix, where he had just arrived from
France.
Pvt. Wilbur Pestell came to Walter !
Reed hospital: He Is rapidly getting
over wounds. The happiest person in
the world was his mother when she
came to his cot. She had been noti
fied by the war department that her
son had been killed in action. And
she came to the hospital In her mourn
ing, which she isn't wearing now!
"I thought he was dead," the happy
mother said, unable to hide the tears
of joy, "and now I find him alive.
Why. I can't say another word
Sgt. George Schifferer. marine, sur
prised his friends in Baltimore last
week by walking in on them. He had
MINERS' HOSPITAL TO
GET ANOTHER CHANCE
Although defeated in the first round
of the fight for its passage in the
house of the' Arizona legislature, the
miners hospital bill probably will be
resurrected in the near future -and
reconsideration ot the former action
sought. . This information was con
tained in a letter from Representative
William Delbridge to John Twomey
of Tammany hall.
Mr. Delbridge explained that the
measure had lost in the house by .a
vote of 16. to 15. At this point he
and Waters of Mohave county changed
their votes.. This was done, he said,
that they might ask for reconsidera
tion later.
The miners hospital bill apparently
is quite popular locally. It was in
troduced by Representative Harry
Sealey of Lowell.

sented which will work out solutions
of international labor questions,

gress or not. and write the interna
tional labor conventions.
They propose the establishment of
a permanent labor bureau within the
league of nations, with inspectors and
courts to expose, and perhaps penalize
through the league every violation of
me conventions.
The plan presupposes the responsi
bility of each nation for any violation
by an employer or worker subject to
that nation.
British laborites are emphasizing
the permanent bureau idea and are
busy on a constitution.
The Gompers delegation is stress
ing the necessity for a declaration of
! labor principles in the treaty
: The world-wide restlessness of labor
has roused tie peace delegates to the
j urgency of the situation
just returned from France and had
been reported killed in action.
The war department doesn't know
how these mistakes were made, nor
does it know how- other similar mis
takes unnecessarily 'saddened home
folks. .
I was told in the adjutant general's
office that wounded : men have been
known to cable home to relatives say
ing they were well, and that some of
them afterward died; and that some
of them had friends write home telling
that they were veil when, really, they
lay at the point of de&th in hospitals.
This is why, in some instances, reports
of "good health" 00 me from the loved
one "over there" almost at the time
when report of death came officially
from the war department.
The war department doesn't think
mistakes were made in cabling identi-

WASHINGTON. Ifeb. 15. The great
museum proposed by Congressman
Hicks &s a memorial . to Colonel
Roosevelt in the bill introduced by
him in the house of representatives.
January 29. is designed to be a mu
seum of history and the arts illus
trating the history and renius of
j Americans two subjects with which
.Mr. Koosevelt .was vitally concerned.
Wasiiinston. the nation's capital
and the focusinsr place for all Ameri
can people, is the logical location for
the memorial to this great American.
Such a memorial, while as perma
nent as bronze, would be a living and
enduring tribute that would serve for
ail time as a real force in the educa
tion of all classes f Americans.
It would contain the vast collections
already in the national museum of
relics and mementoes of illustrious
patriots of our country and of the
events conspicuous in its history.
These ccsrrn not only celebrated
warriors and statesmen and important
military incidents, but also scientists
and inventors and the epoch-makiny
discoveries and inventions produced
by their genius, which have advanced
the cause of civilization and added
luster to our national fame.
The jrreat collection relating to the
'worid war. now being gathered, would
! also be installed within its walls.
1 It would house the national gallery
! cf art. in the development of which
President Roosevelt took an effective
and timely interest. The collections
of the national gallery now approxi
mating $1,000,000 .in value, will rap
idlv grow, as soon as Its adequate in
3ta'lation is iusnred. It is now shown
araid unappropriate surroundings i in
; cne of the halls of the Natural History
i building.
j In it also would be huns the nJ-
tional portrait gallery collection of
j portraits of distinguished personages
j connected with American historv.
Inhibits relating to arts and Indus
tries would be here, too. showing the
development of he electric telegraph
and telephone, the rhonom
trie lighting, transportation, by land.'

illustrating and bookmaking; ores and!

Sweeping changes in the present
Arizona dairy law and the elimina
tion of the dairy commissioner's
power to promulgate new regu
lations from time to time are con
templated, in the concerted action
of the Maricopa Dairy association,
the dairymen of Mesa and Gilbert
and representatives of the cream
ery and ice cream industries, ac cording
to Dairy Commissioner
Barr.
"If . the proposals being ad
vanced by these organizations and
individuals are enacted into law,"
said Commissioner Barr today, "it
will take the teeth out of the regu
lations." "
According to Barr, the Maricopa
Dairy association officials, with
dairymen from the Mesa-Gilbert
district, at ' their meeting to ask
for the amendment'of section sev
en of the present law, making re
peated violations of the law one
offence instead of. constituting
each day's ' offence a separate
charge.' Another change to be
asked, said the commissioner, is
in section 20, which provides mini
mum and juaximum fines and jail
. sentecces for infractions of the
law. . Here the alteration said to
have been suggested is that the
minimum penalties be dropped
and that no prison term be im
posed in any conviction, it being"
left to the judge to set a fine only
and it not to exceed $200.

Road Question Will Be
Taken Up Soon -
(By Review Leased Wire)
Improvement of the roads leading
to the various resorts in the Huachuca
and Chiricahua mountains, would
mean that hundreds of Arizonans who
now spend their summers and many
thousands of dollars in California each
year, would journey to the mountains
instead, and this money be put in cir
culation in the state, in the opinion of
I. C. E. Adams, chairman of the board
of supervisors of Cochise county.
"To many people a movement on the
part of the supervisors to improve the
mountain roads would not appear, be
cause it would appear that the county
was improving roads for the benefit of
the individual resorts." said Mr. Ad
ams. "I am convinced that in the end
this would be the best economy and
would result in "keeping more money
in Arizona annually than the initial
cost of the roads would amount to.
"In Berner canyon of the Huachuca
mountains there is a very pleasant re
sort, visited during the summer by
hundreds of Bisbee people and resi
dents of other parts of the county. In
the Chiricahua mountains there are
several canyons which are popular as
camping places.
"The only trouble with any' of the
present resorts is their inaccessibility.
I -oelieve that the supervisors would
be justified in repairing the roads
leading to them, putting them in first

"Don't put ail your es in one
market basket," is a time worn
cckpe. but its wisdom is beisg
denonstrcted today by the farmers
of Western Canada who are going in
for diversified farming.
The first settlers on these fertile
prairies were cattle ranchers. They
taw unbounded possibilities m these
lim"t!ess grazing grounds and soon
cowboys guarded mighty herds
'.vhere formerly roamed wild buf
faloes. After the cattle barons came
the wheat kings. Their dream was
to make of the prairie provinces a
vast wheat field. The consummation
of their crcam3 has been sung in
ar.d told in story.
History repeats itself and the lean i
vrrrs come with the fat years.'
Drought and frost are ungovernable!
forces. To stake one's all on a single '
crop that may L ruined by un-'
propitious weather is a'gamble that
, the wise farmer will not take. In
! stead he follows the old wives'-ad-,
vice and puts his market eggs in
several baskets. He sows his broad
acres with wheat, and rye and oats
i and alfalfa and other grains. He
I raises beef cattle, dairy cattle, pigs,
, sheep and horses. He is even going
! in for market gardening on a !
gigantie scale. I
His dairy cattle insure a weekly
pay check from the co-operative
creameries that are the go-betweens'
of suburban supply and urban want. I
His pigs give him a semi-annual re-i
turn; the young pigs may be market--ed
at six weeks or held for six
months, as best suits the farmer's '
purse and pleasure. The sheep give I
him an annual income from the wool j
clip and another from the sale ofj
lambs. Beef cattle and horses are!
; a slower source of income, tut yidu
j larger returns when marketed,
j Experience is proving that almost
: every vegetable, grain and fruit can
I be raised successfully in Alberta. A
profitable experiment in raising to
' matoes on a large scale has just
been carried through nearLethbriJge,
Alberta. Two acres of old pasture
! which had been sown to alfalfa was
1 used. It is protected by a wind
break of trees on the western side,
is of rich loam, has a southern slope
and is, of course, irrigated. The
plants were raised under glass and
set out first week in June. The first
ripe fruit was gathered about the
middle of July. During August the
daily yield was from five to six hun
dred pounds and a conservative esti
mate places the total yield st about
35,000 pounds. The crop found a
ready market in Lethbridge.

PHOEXEX, Ariz., Keb. 15. All obso

of which is estimated to be close to
10,0uy will be done away with if Gov
ernor Campbell signs house bill 34,
already passed in that branch of the
legislature and which was approved
by the senate today.
The measure provides for the re
cording of all brands in use in the
state, the result of which will be the
dropping of dead ones and any others
in use which are not fully listed.
State officials and cattlemen de
clare the bill will materially simplify
the brand question, which has grown
to be a vexed one.
A stiff fight developed at the morn

to the measure grew so determined
that its author asked it to be with
drawn. Early in the afternoon session
it was brought up again and. to the
surprise of the galleries, the commit

that it pass without debate or a dis
senting vote.
The amendment to the present Jaw,
creating highway commissioners and
outlining their powers, went safely
through the senate and was ent along
to the house. The bill would allow
counties to co-operate with the federal
govern menu in road building.
Three bills were introduced in the
senate today, the first. 102. sponsored

the second providing a special volun

requiring an accounting of the fund in
cities of over Sow population where
such fire brigades exit.
M. P. Cosby of Benson, recently
appointed deputy game warden for
Cochise. Pima and Santa Cruz
counties, paid his first official
visit to Bisbee yesterday. He said
it is the intention of the Game

to look, after the interests of
the real hunters and fishermen,
and that the department will en
courage those who have suitable
ponds to raise fish.
TThings look good in the Ben

farmers under the Benson canal
north and east of Benson are very -active,
which raeacs that more
acres will be under cultivation
this season than ever before."
The canal company has installed
a pumping plant at the bend . and
intends to increase the summer
supply by several thousand inches
of water.

bell. I realize that this is a serious
step." said Baumert. ..especially at
this time of industrial unrest, but till
the legislature acts on our request for
emergency appropriations we must
cease work. I sent a wire today to
Supt. J. T. Mahoney to stop work ou
the northern Arizona normal school at
Flagstaff and also to Tucson to hold
up censtruction on the girls' dormi

Simliar instructions have been issued
with regard to the state hospital for

early action on the request for the

said he had been given to understand
that thrs matter could not be gone

Tex Barton is in $10.
C. H. Wilson is in jail.
Likewise Tex Barton is wearing

It all happened like this.
On January 2S C. H. Wilson was
fined $10 in Justice of the Peace
Jimmy Allison's court for speed
ing. Claiming to be temporarily
embarrassed financially Wilson
imposed on Tex Barton's good
nature and asked the upholder of
the law to stand good for the

The next day Wilson was out of
town.
Tex Barton was out $10.
After wearing out two pairs of
shoes and spending sundry dimes
and other small change for jitnev
hire Tex at last located Wilson
in Lowell and slipped him the
glad information that free lodging
for the evening awaited him.
Today Senor Wilson will have a
chance to pungle np $10 which
will be handed over to Tex Barton

pressed people in their former homes on

more blessed to give than receive". and to

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Feb. 13. What in sub -
: stance amounted to a very disastrous
! rout of the short interests marked the
rcurse cf today's brief but livelv ses
sioa of the stock exchange.
Prices were little more than firm
at the outset, but the general list soon
strengthened under the impetus of a
buoyant demand for oils, shippings
and some of the motors and popular
equipments.
Rails were hesitant for a time.
Later, however, transcontinental and
coalers joined the upwarc movement,
at gains of 1 to 2 points.
Buying of oils, at materially higher
levels soon spread to the automobile
division.
United States Stel was steadily ac
cumulated in the final half hour, ad
vancing iss to 91'sc, allied issues ris
ing 1 to 2s points. Marine preferred
again led the shippings. Sales amount
ed to 425.000 shares.
Bonds were active and steady in
the main. speculative issues making
little response to the activity of
stocks. Sale, par value, aggregated
6.675.000. Old coupon and registered
United States fours rose i or 1 per
cent on call during the week.
BANK REPORT
NEW YORK. Feb. 15. The actual!
j condition of clearing houses, banks
I and trust companies for the week (five
days) shows that thew hold 552.415.4S0
reserve in excess of legal require
ments. That is an increase of $15
013,760 from last week.

found an incentive for advancing oils,
shippings and kindred shares in lat -
est developments, such as more hope -
and prospects of early action by
Washington regarding marine ton
nage. Chaotic conditions in the transpor
tation situation continued to check
any movement in rails, steel and iron
equipments were halted by prospects

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Feb. 15. Sharp ad
vances in the corn market today re
sulted from persistent buying on the
part cf houses with eastern connec
tions. The close, although unsettled,
was 2 to 3-Sj net higher, with Mav
$1.238 to $1.23"i. and July $1.19 t'o
?1.197s- Oats gained ls to l?sc and
provisions 17 to S5ci
Much of the ardor to. buy corn ap
peared to spring from the strength
cf the New York stock market and
from an advance in foreign bonds.
The pressure, however, was not of a
decided character and the subsequent
upturn had no serious check until the
last half hour. Th?n the aggressive
ness of the bulls was overcome in a
measure by unverified reports that the
s-'.iikes in Argentine were over.-
Oats followed closely the changes in
com. Trade was of liberal volume.
Provisions again jumped as high as
the rules would permit. Lower prices
on hogs exercised only a transient de
pressing influence. Packers bought.
METAL MARKET
NEW YORK. Feb. 13. The feature
in the copper market during the past
i week has been the continued absence
of demand on any general or import
ant scale. Some business has been
reported at 17.00 for electrolytic, but
the larger producers are said to be
