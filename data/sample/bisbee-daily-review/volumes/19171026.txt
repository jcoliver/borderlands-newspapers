Food Administrator Declares
That America Must Supply
Needs of Allies in Food
stuffs to Beat the Sub

WASHINGTON, Oct. 25. In a
statement tonight reviewing the world

Hoover said the fight against the sub

States and Canada could stimulate
production and effect economies so 'as
to feed the allies from this continent

Ships, wheat and hogs are the great
needs emphasized by Mr. Hoover.
Situation of Pork
He said deepest concern hod been
! caused by the fact that In suite of
price this country's pork consump-
tion had increased during the war un
til production had been outstripped, a
situation that must be changed.
"If we discontinue exports." said
Mr. Hoover, "we will move the Ger
man line from France to the Atlantic
seaboard. Pork production will have
an influence in the present world sit
uation wider th-n one would ordina
rily attribute to it. The human body
must have a certain amount of fat;
we must increase production of hogs
if we are to answer the world's crav
ing. "Every pound of fat is as sure of
service as every bullet, and every hog
is of greater value to the winning of
this war than i sheW ,
As to Wheat
As to wheat, the administrator said
the. allies' deficiency of production is
196,000,000 bushels, with imports of
577.7O0.0O0 bushels required to main-j
tain normal consumption. He esti
mated the aggregate American, Ca
nadian, Australian, Indian and Ar
gentine export surplus at 770,000,000
bushels, but pointed out that lack of
shipping made it necessary for "this'
country and Canada to bear this bur-1
den of meeting the allies' deficiency.
Problem of Ships
'The problem is thus simply one of
ships," he said.
"If ample shipping existed there
would be no need for saving or in
creased production of wheat on the
part of the American people. Hut if
we can produce economies ana stimu-,
late production in the United btates
and Canada as will enable us to feed
the allies absolutely from this conti
nent, and thus enable them to livrl
without sending a ship farther afield
than our Atlantic seaboard, we can
resist the submarine indefinitely."
Placing the the United States wheat
export surplus from this year's crop
at 80.000.000 bushels and Canada's at
150.000.000 bushels. Mr. Hoover urged
domestic economies to increase this
country's surplus to 150.000.000 bush

Addressing a delegation of 100 lead
ers of the New York state women
suffrage party who called at the.
White House to obtain an expression
in support of the campaign in that
state, the president, in emphatic
terms declared that, woman suffrage
is one of the fundamentals of de

determined by the issues of the war.

vision of American women in tha

Retirement May

(By Review Leased Wire.)
COPENHAGEN. Oct. 25 The Ger
mans, under pressure of the French
victory on the Aisne, may endeavor to
effect a general retirement to a new
Hindenburg line well in the rear of
their present positions. Various bints
from German sources of late have in
dicated that the German experts, rec
ognizing the menace, particularly to
the exposed salient south-southwest
of Laon, were preparing a new forti
fied line somewhere between Laon
and their former front, to which they
?xptcted to effect an orderly retire
ment akin to their spring withdrawal,
as soon as the menace became press
ing. The French attacks seems to have
anticipated this strategy, and the Ger
man withdrawal, if made now under
the hammering of a victorious oppo
nent, is likely to be quite a different
operation from that planned.

I was down for six wteks. I alsj had

misery I couldn't sleep and many a
night I would sit up in a chair nearly
all night long.
"After I got down in bed I sent fori

Brisk competition for the scanty ar

increased from the outset the anxiety
of shorts, who were endeavoring to
escape further risk on outstanding
contracts. No sign of hurry te sell

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev

perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of h?t water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

A Morning In a German
School
The German nation, all that part of It nof in the
trenches on the battle line, has been called to early morn
ing classroom. The shopkeepers, the gardeners, the
workers In wood and iron, the women and children, the
doctors and the old men and the wounded soldiers, the
farmers and editors and lawyers and burghers and all
are there. And now comes the teacher, sent especially
from the general staff. Is he not a great teacher, chil
dren? Salute him! All wisdom and kultur and glittering
success are bottled up In him and bul?e out at his brows.
Listen! He is goingf to speak. Do not lose a precious
word of what he is saying.
"Poof!" says this wonderful teacher, blowing 6ut his
cheeks. "America is in the war, but you do not need
to fear. Remember Roumania. America is weaker than
she. She will not be able to" place as many men In the
field against us. And these few men she sends, poof,
they cannot fight any better than those Roumanians. I
spit upon them. See.
"They are trying to raise an army over there in that
country of pigs and merchants and millionaires. They
will never do it Mexico threatens them. They do not
dare to take any troops from their southern borders. And
if they should raise an army, how could they equip these
soldiers and send them across the seas? They have no
guns or ships. And if they had ships our noble subma
rines would destroy them. Poof.
"Are you listening, children? Well, listen closer now.
Do not worry about America; be glad, rather, that she
was bamboozled into entering this war. We willed It
that way. In our wisdom and in our care for you and
the fatherland, we forced her to declare war. Why not?
some one must pay. .She is rich and therefore she must
pay.
"Listen still closer. The people over there are not
behind their government. They do not want to fight us.
Four million Germans over there are heart and soul for
the kaiser. In their very congress we have friends who
do not fear to speak boldly for us and vote for us. We
have friends who bomb their puny plants where they
make arms. We have friends who call strikes. They
are paralyzed now by the far reaching hand of the great
German government. Their President Wilson, who
pushed them Into this whirlpool, will be mobbed some
fine day and driven from Washington. Remember that
it is I who am telling you this, and I am or the general
staff. Others guess, but we know.
"We are winning victories everywhere. Look at the
Gulf of Riga. Petrograd is ours when we will it. The
great crown prince still threatens Paris. The English
are starving, as our noble submarines keep the ocean
for the kaiser. But we are as kind as we are great We
still offer them peace, but their mad rulers will not let
them make peace. Wait a little. Have patience. The
great Hindenburg will lure those mad English forward
a little further and then be will crubh them and take
all the channel ports and drive them into the sea. T!ie
time is set for this. We merely wait.
"You should thank God and the kaiser every day that
America is in the war. Her money shall be used to re
plenish our treasury and build up Belgium for us and
all that part of Franre we desire to keep. We will levy
a tribute on those rich pigs that will make them gasp
and dig, oh, ever so deeply. We will place their cities
under the guns of our fleet and threaten them. We have
a way that will make them pay, as Belgium well knows.
"Well, you have been a good class today, and I wfll
i
tell you more tomorrow. You are hungry, you say? Poof,
that is nothing! You will feast by and by. Be patten.
Pay a little niore. Give more of your sons. We are
winning. Another year will see Germany triumphant.
God figlits for us and therefore we cannot be heaten.
This is all. More good news tomorrow."
The staff officer blows out his cheeks once more and
leaves the schoolroom aaiidbt cLeers and haudclappiug.
Ah, that school, that foolish school and more foolish
pupils. Were they not told at the beginning of the war
by that same staff officer, speaking for the government,
that their soldiers should be in Paris in six months?
And yet for three years pest they have not gained a foot
of ground In France that they have held, and for a year
past they have been pounded back with frightful losse3
by a superior artillery and heavier reserves of men.
Were they not told by that same staff officer that
England would not fight? And yet today three million
English soldiers are pounding the flower of the Prussian
armies to pieces in Flanders and the English fleet has
wiped German commerce from the seas and bottled the
great German fleet up in Kiel canal.
Were they not told that Russia had been betrayed by
her rulers and would make a separate peace? And ye
today Russia, blind with folly, liberty and license, still
struggles on and is farther from a separate peace than
she was when her armies were mobilized in the sum
mer of 1914.
Were they not told that America would not dare to de
clare war at all? And yet today America has a million
men mobilized and has authorized the expenditure of
eight billions for the allied cause.
After all this misinformation, this senseless bluster
and brag, this deliberate falsehood, this distortion of facts,
this false prophecy, this dreaming and delusion and devia
tion, the school still holds its sessions and the pupils
come and listen and learn and go away satisfied. When
will it all end? When will the scales fall from their
eyes? Do they not have an occasional doubt? Do they
not know black from white; phantasma from reality?
And today they are told that America counts for noth
ing. America, with her one hundred millions of skilled
and enlightened and determined people. America, with
her untold wealth and natural resources and genius for
organization and invention. America, with her splendid
traditions, her unselfishness and her pride. The German
general staff know better. They know that we are the
most dangerous and deadly antagonist of them all. They
know that two years hence we will have an army and
a fleet and an air service that will be able alone to de
stroy Germany. But they are playing the desperate game
out to the end. As long as the foolish pupils listen there
is a staff officer to come and stuff them full of foolish
lies. It is incomprehensible, it is ridiculous, and it is
also pathetic and tragic, this German school with its
pompous teacher . and docile pupils, who must pay so
much and so dearly to learn.
Senator Smith
Carrying his three score years and ten like a gallant
young man, Senator Mark Smith of Arizona thrilled and
inspired a Bisbee audience a night or two ago with his
earnest, sincere, patriotic address on why we are at war
with Germany. It was good to hear this white-headed
man speak plain English straight from the shoulder on
the causes and the justice of this great war. He did not
philander and talk piffle and analyze and deduct and
indulge in persiflage. He talked the southwestern
language. He made himself clear. And when he had
finished every man in his audience knew something
about the congressional viewpoint and manner and
method of dealing with the Hun.
In a cold, hard, stern, accusing array the facts and
causes of war with Germany came and stood before his
audience as the senator proceeded wtih his address. The
ship sinkings, the plots and counter-plots, the lies, the
subterfuge, the defiance, the shocking cruelty, the wild
war and blood lust, the passion and folly of the German
imperial government were revealed with a plainness and
a sincerity and a single honesty of purpose that carried
conviction with every word and every accent and every
gesture as, from time to time, the aged senator pushed
his gray locks back from his forehead and looked with
glowing eyes and tense face and indomitable purpose at
his enthusiastic and loyal audience.
Senator Smith is a member of the foreign relations
committee of the senate, the most important committee
in congress right now. He has been informed from the
inside. He has been behind the scenes. during the prog
ress of the world drama." And with his heart and soul
in his voice he calls aloud with all his might for the
prosecution of this war until the Hun .shall be beaten to
his knees.
His arraignment of the pacifists and traitors and phil
anderers and obstructors and strikers and plotters and
special pleaders for Germany was more effective than
anything ever read In cold type, because the man's soul
thrilled in his voice in an indignant, terrible accusation
that carried home and spared not.
When a man comes home from a war congress and
renders such an account of his stewardship to his people
there is uo question or cavil of doubting. Well done!
is the unanimous verdict "I voted for war," lie declared,
"and I spoke for war upon the floor of the senate." No
apology here, but pride r.hining in his face and ryes. As
a member of the appropriations committee he declared
that he had voted eight billions Tor the war. No ifs or
ands about this statement either. Just plain, potent,
patriotic facts.
Would that all members of the last congress could
come home with such a record and such a speech. It) a
few stales certain senators and congressmen will he
hooted and hissed and cursed from any stage they may
ascend to tell of their stewardship. In many states these
stewards of the people can tell only of half-hearted sup
port of the nation's war policy as outlined and curried
out by the president.
But Senator Smith's message rings true. The Review
editor hopes and trusts tha he will be able to deliver it
in every city and town m Arizona.

the amount subscribed will be $10,000,

J. X. Gaines Thursday announcement,
has taken bonds to the amount of $2.

Death Overtakes
Prominent Man ofj
Warren District
for his sterling integrity ; which has .
manifested itself, oftlmes. in the face;
of peril. During his late years he has I
served on the ci y council of Bisbee !
making a record for his activity and ;
interest in the welfare of the cominun-l
ity. ;
Charles P. Cunningham, for over
thirty-five years a resident of Bisbee
I ani ranked among the Warren Dis
trict's most prominent citizens, died
at his home, this morning at 12:30
b'clock. Mr. Cunningham suffered a
stroke of paralysis about a week ago.
Complications set in, resulting in the
congestion of his lef; lung. No ar
rangements have been made for his in
terment. Surviving Mr. Cunningham are; one
brother, now in Philadelphia, and
two sisters, both of whom were at the
bedside when the end came. They
are Miss Lizzie Cunningham and Mrs.
Annie Connors.
In the death of Charlie Cunningham
the city of Bisbee loses one V)f its best
known and most loved men. For thirty-five
years he has been a resident of
the camp, seeing it first when It was
in its infancy and still striving for its
betterment when it bad grown to the
community it now is. For many years
he has been the proprietor of the
Philadelphia h'Jtel.

State of War is
Declared Between
Brazil and Huns
(By Review Leased Wire.)
RIO JANEIRO. Oct 2o. The presi
dent of the republic, Dr. Wenceslso
Braz. has sent a message to the con
gress declaring that it is impossible
'jo avoid noting the state 'of war which
Germany has imposed on Brazil. He
proposes the seizure of a German war
ship now in the port ofRahia.
The majority leader of the chamber
discussed the relations between Bra
zil and Germany and counseled the
chamber to approve the presidential
message.
The parliamentary diplomatic com
mittee also discussed the message
which it Is considered the chamber
will adopt. .
The torpedoing of the Brazilian ship
Macau is causing considerable com
ment. The Jomal de Commercio
says:
"Brazil does no! look for war and
does not want war, but Germany is
driving us Info the whirl. We shall
go wi.h the serenity of those for
whom honor is above all."
According to the declarations of var
ious members before the chamber of
deputies a declara'ion of war would be
the only satisfactory solution and the
diplomatic committee should not again
come before the chamber without a
declaration of war. Some of the mem
bers said there la not one Brazilian
who did not espouse the cause of the
government.
Brazil reOked her neu'rality be
tween the allies and Germany last
June. The trouble between Brazil and
Germany reached a climax In April
when' the Brazilian steamer Parana
was torpedoed. The German minister
received his passports and anti Ger
man riots broke out in several cities. A
large number of German ships in Bra
zilian ports were seized.
Recent dispatches from Buenos
Aires reported disclosures of German
intrigues to bring about a conflict be
tween Brazil. Argentina and I'rutruar.

cWhat is the
most economical
cooking fat ?
When you step into your grocer's you find
different shortenings quoted at different prices.
You may want to know which is the truly eco
nomical shortening.
The prices don't tell.
Some shortenings will o much farther than
others.
For instance :
Many careful housekeepers have found that
Cottolene goes very much farther than other
shortenings which they had been using.
The reason ?
It is very much richer.
' Cottolene contains no water. It is always
uniform in quality.
You will find, too, .that pure, economical
Cottolene gives to biscuits, cakes, pies r.nd fried
tid-bits a delicate flavor that even expensive
butter might well be proud of.
The unusual richness of wholesome Cottolene
makes its economy a true economy.
In baking, use one-third less of Cottolene than
you have ordinarily used of other shortenings.
Remember that the next time ycu order from
your grocer. Remember, too, that he can supply
Cottolene in tins of convenient sizes.
Recipe for
BAKING POWDER BISCUIT
Into two cups of sifted pastry flour
sift and mix one level teaspoon salt
and two rounded teaspoonr. baking
powder; chop in one level tablespoon
chilled Cottolene. Wet to stilt douph
with H cup half water and half nnik.
