VIA MEXICO
IS DISCI
Department Justice Informed
That Radicals Underground
Line Existe From Soviet
to America by Way of Mex.
WASHINGTON. Nov. 14. Disclos
ures of Jarge orders for arms and
ammunition placed by Mexico in Eu
rope were followed today by revela
tions tending to show that the "reds
underground line" from Soviet Rus
sia to the United States runs by way
of Mexico.
It became known' that the immi
gration service and the department
of justice both are concerned at the
influx of Russian radicals and other
aliens of "red" tendencies over the
Mexican border. Furthermore, gov
ernment agents have traced much
"red" propaganda over the Mexican
line.
A letter written October 23 by Ra
mon P. De Nigri. Mexican consul
general in New York, to Flavia Bor
quez, a Mexican senator, endorsing
the principle of "nationalization" has
come into the hands of the govern
. ment" and already has been called to
the attention of the state department
by at least two senators as showing
De Nigrl's association with "radical
socialists" in the United States.
In the opinion of officials here the
publication of De Nigrl's letter may
lead to an embarrassing situation. It
'is known that the senators who had
railed attention of Secretary Lan
sing to it recommended cancellation
of the consul general's exaquator.
Government investigators have re
ported that radicals seemed to have
been first attracted to Mexico by
certain -so-called "ultra-modern" pro
visions of the new constitution. De
Nigri in his letter writes that "only
Russia by nationalizing lands has
gone further than we fcave."
De Nigrl's letter, as it comes to !
the government's hands, says in its
principal parts:
"It would not only be sad, but
even criminal, that we should abdi
cate our nationalization policy
through the threats of Wall Street
' capitalists. I believe this is an ideal
time in which to assure Mexican
petroleum once for all, since it means
nothing less than our greatest wealth,
so coveted by foreign interests.
"You are probably familiar with
the statements made by George
Creel to our good friend, Manuel
Carpio, on President Wilson's view
with regard to the nationalization of
petroleum in Mexico.
"Steps are at present being taken
in the United States by the working
classes, radical socialists, honest in
tellectuals, etc., with a view not only
to nationalizing natural ' resources,
but to socializing industries in gen
eral. For your satisfaction and that
of the members of the constitutional
assembly,, I must say that ,you set
the example; I can testify to this
for I have been on the scene of ac
tion sine 1914.
"In 1917 I was In Washington in
charge of our embassy when you
took the transcendental step' of na
tionalization. From that moment I
made up my mind to engage in pro
paganda favdrable to us by having
our constitution printed in English.
I have talked with prominent sociol
ogists of the United States, Eng
lahd and Russia and they have all
informed me that our constitution is
read with enthusiasm in those coun

German Students in
Berlin Refused To
Permit Hindenburg
To Give Testimony
BERLN, Nov. 14. (By the Associ
ated Press.) Pan German students
today refused to permit Field Mar
shal von Hindenburg to enter the
Reiehstae buildine to testify before
the sub-committee which is investi
gating war responsibilities, and
torced the field marshal's chauffeur
to return with the former commander
in chief to his home.
The demonstration occurred this
morning as the field marshal's auto
mobile was being driven toward the
Reichstag building. The student
surrounded it and declared their un
willingness to allow him to be ques
tioned by a sub committee.
Von Hindenburg begged the stu
dents, who clung to the running
board of the machine, to allow the
automobile to pass, as he was due at
the Reichstag.
The students, however, replied by
ordering the street closed, declaring
that they were unwilling to allow the
sub-committee to interrogate him.
Again von Hindenburg protested, but
he was unable to quell the demqnstra
tion. It was a Nationalist demonstration
for both von Hindenburg and General
Ludendorff and for a time it assumed
serious proportions. The crowd
which gathered consisted mostly or
students of both sexes, who carried
with them an old German flag.
Another ConfractoV
Charged With Theft
of Sacks of Cement
PHOENIX, Ariz. Nov. J4. As a
new development in the state's effort
to put a stop to an alleged practice
of individuals and firms borrowing
materials or equipment from the

full official authorization, it was an
nounced today that preliminary hear
ing of the case of William Springer,
charged with the theft of 1200 sacks
of Portland cement from the state
highway department had been set for
December 5.
A " charge similar to that against
Harry Hurley, now pending in the
superior court, was made against
Springer, who is alleged to have
taken 1200 sacks of cement belong
ing to the highway department from
freight cars on the siding at Tempe.
Sprirger gave himself up voluntarily
and was released, following his ar
raignment, on $2000 bond. The com
plainant against him was V. T. Bled

the union's plan won by large ma
jorities. First, by a vote of 151 to

THREE PUNS "
TO COAL
Labor Secretary Tells Confer
ees That Both Must Be
Willing to Listen to Reason
To Obtain Good Results
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14. De
mands of coal miners for a 30-hour
week and a 60 per cent increase in
wages and an unyielding position by
the operators were declared "impos
sible" by Secretary Wilson in open
ing today tije conference called to
bring peace to the bituminous coal
fields of the nation. To obtain this
peace the secretary proposed threa
plans cf p P.m:'u' e.
Declaring that the Washington
wage agreement still is legally in
force, Mr. Wilson told the operators
and miners that the people of the
United States were not "Shylocks"
and do not want to exact "the tech
nical conditions of a bond when the
conditions under which the bond was
made have changed."
He added "that any great change
made in the contracts the people of
the United States are the ones who
will have to pay," and throughout his
remarks emphasized the public in
terest in the coal settlement.
The three proposals expected to
aid the two factions in arranging the
new wage agreement, were sot forth
by the secretary as follows:
First, negotiations through joint
wage scale committees representing
all districts; second, agreement
through concurrent sessions of com
mittees from the various districts,
and third, negotiation first cf an
agreement in the central competitive
field and then of agreements in the
other fields with that of the central
fields as a base..
After hearing Secretary Tilson the
conference adjourn! imtil 10 o'clock
tomorrow to permit the n.iners and
operators to discuss separately the
plan which would be most accepta
ble to each.
Indication of a conflict on the
scope of the agreemuit to be nego
tiated Involving the question of rec
ognition of non-union workers de
veloped at the outset of the con
ference and became mors apparent
in the two group meetings which
followed.

CLOTURE RULE
T
WASHINGTON, Nov. 14. Success
for the movement to shut down the
peace treaty debate by a cloture
seemed likely tonight to remain in
doubt until the senate votes tomor
row on the question.
Thirty Republicans signed the peti
tion for cloture and party leaders
declared that more would vote for it.
There was no doubt, leaders assert
ed, that the Republican side of the
chamber wt a.'d ot:itrtute more
its share f.r the two-UiiriiS nr.jcri'.y
necessary to invoke the cloture tu'.e.
Among the Democrats, however,
there was more uncertainty, growing
out of a question of policy involv
ing the whole administration program
of parliamentary action on the treaty.
Democratic Leader Hitchcock was ui
derstood to incline away from the
cloture proposal and although some
Democratic Leader Hitchcock was un
low him, a far greater cimber re
served their decision.

Prohibition Worker
Popular Because of
Hazing By Students
LONDON, Nov. 14 (By Associat
ed Press.) William E. ("Pussyfoot")
Johnson, the American prohibitionist
whose campaign in England was
rudely interrupted Thursday by a
band of students, today as a result of
his attitude toward tne adventure, is
one of the most talked of and popular
figures of the day. He commanded
the biggest headlines in today's
newspapers, and the general verdict
of the headlines written is that he is
a- "good sport."
Mr. Johnson could not have desired
a ! better advertisement than Thurs
day's incident for his campaign
against the liquor traffic and his
future public appearance likely will
command attention by reason of the
fact that he has announced himself
as considering the hazing he under
went a good joke. The students who
marched about with him yesterday
now propose to tender Mr. Johnson
a banquet and present to him their
tributes of respect.

is considered a top' price for leases
was made the other day when Gerard

its attitude and pledges his con:in

organization."
The action of the Mesa post c:unc
in the form cf (he following resolu
tion, which was prepared upon the
receipt of news concerning the hap
pening in the stute of Washington:
"Whereas, During the period o;'
the world war, and immediately t,ub
sequent thereto, there has developed
in America an undesirable element in
our population represented by the 1.
W. W.s and other radicals opposed 10
government and pledged to its over
throw and destruction; and,
"Whereas, Since the termination of
the world war, and the relaxation of
war measures for the curbing of such
element, the aforesaid radicals have
been super-active in our midst; and,
"Whereas, The public press on this
morning, following the first anniver
sary of the Armistice Day, bring3
news of the dastardly and cowardly
attack on Centralia, Wash., by such
radical elements upon (he lawfully
and peacefully conducted parade of
our fellow veterans of the world war; ;
and,
"Whereas, No extenuating circum
stances can be advanced in connec
tion with this infamous act upon
public manifestation of loyalty to
our government; and,
"Whereas, The clement of our
population perpetrating the outrage
in question is opposed to the prin
ciples of organized go'.'ernment and
committed to the destruction of or
ganised society;
"Now, therefore. The Id era post of
the American Legion condemns the
action of the radical elements in the
state of Washington, as well as all
other such actions of this radical ele
ment during the continuance, and
since the end of the world war, and
demand that merited punishment be
speedily ' enforced. We pledge our
unqualified support to the move
mem 3 and measures initiated and
sponsored by the national convention
of the American Legion, and to the
department of justice of our federal
government, now engaged in protect
ing society from such unlawlul ele
ment, and we demand like unquali

state to the end that1 such radical
elements within the state of Arizona
may bo ousted therefrom, and busi
ness and society made safe, and to
that purpose we dedicate anew our
services."

tries, especially those portions deal
ing with labor and with article 27;
only Russia by nationalizing lands
has gone farther than we have. This
is what we lack to assure our eco
nomic independence, the basis of the
sovereignty of all peoples. You will
have seen in the press that
England has nationalized its coal
mines and that similar steps are be
ing taken in France.
"The social movement in the Unit
ed States is of such importance at
the present time that from one mo
ment to another there may be a
change in the general order of things.
There is a terrible dislocation be
tween capital and labor. The con
ciliation conference fcetween indus
trials and workingmen have failed.
Throughout the United States there
is a clamor for the socialization of
industries. It would be sad if we,
who initiated the movement, should
abandon it through a weakening of
principles or through unfounded fears.
I believe you should uphold the prin

light, as he is going up against ptr
hips the toughest proposition he has
e-er faced in the ring. His battle
with George at Albuquerque several
weeks ago is declared to have been
the most hotly contested ring contest
eve'- slaved in New Mexico, ami
while Caldwell got the decision on a
tetLJical knockout in the fifteenth
lound. he did not come out of the
battle villi his own laurels un
barred. Now George is after a re
versal of that defeat, and is leaving
r.o stone unturned to prepare him
reif to the utmost for his opponent.
George, is t raining with Bob Col

battles here ended in knockouts of
his opponents in the second round in
each case. Both men are working

them yesterday declared that they

hard rounds yesterday with Collins,
bag punching, rope skipping, wrest

is in superb condition now, and
promises that he will be absolutely
in the best of shape when the gong

Lou Collins of San Francisco, who
has been acquainted with Fred (Kid)
George for many years, and who has
been associated with him in several
big ring battles, is now in charge or
his training.
Eddie Hughes, the rugged pride of

was announced yesterday, although
definite arrangements for this have
not been completed.
It is probable alo that Al Mauch
will train with George and Collins,
which will give zn opportunity for
each of them to get the beet there
is in the line of conditioning. Mauch
meets Frank Ford, whose teeth have
all become solid again since his en
counter with Collins, and whose jaw
is such that he eats now without
difficulty, while his stomach has re

all these in shape, he declares that
he is prepared to give Mauch the lit

who meet in the curtain raiser, are I

Following the announcement of

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"We sometimes had those little rubs which Providence sends
to enhance the value of its favors." Goldsmith.
CORPORATION BAITING
THE program for development in this valley, as announced by
the San Joaquin Light & Power corporation, reminds us that
corporation bailing is not as popular as some demagogues
think it is. But it may be added that it is more popular than
it should be, the welfare of the communities affected taken into con
sideration. Just now 2000 valley applicants are waiting for power, and their
one immediate hope lies in the perfection of the plans of the corpora
tion that contemplates the expenditure of $50,000,000 to develop
what the formers of the valley are eagerly seeking.
With that power available the productivity of thousands of acres
of land will be largely increased, their ability to maintain additional
population enhanced, and along with that, the prosperity of every
center of business will be enormously increased.
Individuals cannpt create a quantity (Commodity like power.
Aggregations of individuals might, but they are not likely to. The
valley calls for electrical energy, and a corporation is seeking to
respond.
The sane community these days is the one that encourages
capital to invest in development work and that discourages the dem
agogues who peek popularity by appealing to prejudice against capi
tal. Baker-field Califorman.
The case of the San Joaquin Light & Power company is typical
of public utilities. These community servants have been hounded
and pounded by legislation and regulation until the wonder is that
they can operate at alL
The public i3 changing its viewpoint, however, as it begins to
realize that no community can grow without a prosperous utility
as its working center. Local citizens must take pride in their utility
companies and be as proud of their success as they are of the growth
of their substantial banking institutions.
With a constructive public sentiment behind a utility program,
money for extensions and betterments will be readily obtainable by
these companies as rapidly as community needs require, for the
investor will feel that his interests are safe.
HIGH TIME FOR ACTION
THE firing by the I. W. W., premeditated as it proves to be, on
the Armistice Day parade in a northwest town, is sympto
matic of a condition which this languorous nation must prepare
to meet. The only aspect in which this outbreak can be viewed
is as that of a larger and more sinister meaning than one mere spo
radic incident.
There is in this nation today a determined, violent, dangerous,
reckless element of astbnishingly large numbers which is anarchistic
in its nature and determined to smash the government of the United
States if it can.
It has in it all the menace of fanaticism. It has the determina
tion of all reds and radicals everywhere in history. Killing a few or
lynching4 a few will not act as a deterrent. The whole power of the
federal and state governments and of decent public opinion must be .
welded into a consolidated weapon to undo this thing and undo it
now !
It will not die out of inanition with ony an occasional flare. It
is basically ground into hundreds of thousands of foreign immigrants
who are not naturalized, who have no conception of a republic, who
have been with criminal negligence permitted to come into this
country. It is led. unfortunately, largely by renegade Americans,
who, because of their very apostasy, from their birthright, are more
to be feared than those who come by seditious views naturally.
There must be no leniency with the I. W. W., with radicalism,
with the one big union idea, with industrial disorder, with scant
reverence for the flag and the government any longer.
That is true everywhere. It must be Uue in Arizona, where,
after some years in the wilderness, there is a state administration
which is alien to any thought of even temporizing with the wobblies.
In this crisis, for it is not iess than mat, let the law-abiding, nation
loving citizens of the state, , regardless of previous party affiliations,
see to it now in their intent, and next year by their votes, that no
man on whose skirts there is the slightest smear of friendship for
or association with wobblies. reds, radicals and that unholy ilk. can
even hope to come within sight of the starting post in the race for
either governor or senator so far as the hope of victory goes.
Tucson Citizen.
CLAMP IT ON TIGHT
ONE of the most hopeful signs which has come out or the United
States senate since the weary, impotent debate on i lie peace,
treaty and the league of nations began, is the movement to
damp on si cloture ruin in the face of what appears to be the
beginning of a filibuster against ratification of the treaty.
The peace terms and the league of nations have been discussed
at length, over and over again, by orators, politicians and private
citizens from one end of the nation to the other. Every citizen has
his or her opinion of the matter an opinion not to be changed at ihis
late hour by senatorial verbosity.
Any senator who cannot, tell his reasons Tor being against the
league of nations within an hour the speech limit suggested lor the
proposed cloture rule is the victim of a woefully vacillating mind,
even for a senator.
If the senate wants the league of nations, let it say so. If it
does not want the league, let it say so. One way or the other, let
us have a vote on the matter at once.
Clamp the cloture lid on tight.
If citizens have the right to vote for or against an increase in
street car fare, why haven't they the right to make a similar decision
concerning the price of sirloin steak and coal?
H may be that we have adopted the liabil of scolding one an
other 'bccau:-c we can no longer blame everything on the kaiser or
the flu.

The story that 55 senators have -agreed on a set of reservations
Is encouraging. We were beginning to think it impossible for a
majority In America to agree on anything.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE

last. so that it seemed to me as I walked along that never wa:; the sunshine
so bright, tho pretty faces sa attractive or the shapely ankles no trim. So
to my young ladies of the cigar store, from whom I bought a cigrr, and
thence to the Annex, where I met Mr. Phillipowhkl, whoe name, I think, I
have spel'.od wrong, but who is a most plecsant g'-ntkindn, and who. being
court reporter at Tombstone, promised to give some news, for which I was
thankful. And there also I heard a humorous remark from a bcxer, who,
when asked why the women were fighting ever him, replied that he did not
know, but that he would rather that they would fight over him than with
him. To Mr. Angius, who told a little about the Red Cross drive, and I glad
'o hear that we are reaching the quota, being averse to giving Douglas the
chance to laugh at us, although, in God's truth, it would be a sour laugh,
we having handed her so many packages in the past. Heard, also, while
talking of Douglas, that there is quite a controversy there about the prob
able date of Christmas, and also whether they shall celebrate Thanksgiving,
which some of them, they say, have taken for some sort of Mexican saint's
day. Which made me glad that I live in the United States. My good
rumor, which had begun when 1 arose from my crackling bed (crackling
because of the newspapers over the mattress), was increased when I went
to Lowell, because there was a bevy of beautiful women on the car, and
one o fthem seemed to smile at me, although of this I am not sure. The
supposition, however, was sufficient to help me over an otherwise prosaic
day. To Judge Allen English, who told me he was very busy, but not what
it was about, and I did not inquire, although how lawyers can be busy always
and yet not millionaires has been a continual mystery to me. Perhaps they
are all married. . To the office, where there was a letter from a woman
who loves burros, and who does not want them impounded, and this helped
me out with the news. To bed early, still mightily 'content, especially since
I found that my wife has substituted pajamas for my night-gown, which
helps' much should the newspapers tear.

Compared with other animal foods j
milk is cheap even at 12 and 15 1
According to statistics recently ; cents a qua: t, and should enter f ree-:
puoiished by the National Dairy As- j ly into thi dietary. I
sociation, it has been found that in i Skim milk is also valuable as a
the United States, as the population j f00d. jt has lost the fat, so when 1
has increased annually, the number ' given to children that fat should be
of dairy cows has decreased. This
decrease has been so great that nu
trition experts are taking an active
interest in promoting the use of milk
by both young and old.
Since milk contains the five food
principles necessary to keep the hu
man body going (proteins, mineral
salts, carbahydrates, fats and water)
it is considered a perfect food. It
is the only food in nature designed
expressly for the nourishment of the
joung.
Nutritious Value.
Milk is a high protein food. In
infancy it furnishes the nitrogen nec
essary for the formation of new cells
while throughout the growing period
it furnishes the most valuable source
of proteins, as it is non-stimulating
and less liable to putrefaction in the
alimentary tract than meat proteins.
Given a quart of milk and an egg
each da)-, a child under eight years
of age on a suitable diet of proper
fuel value, will have sufficient pro
teins for ell body needs. Dr. Mc-
Calluni, one of our foremost experts
on nutrition, has discovered that milk
contains the fat soluble (A) and
water soluble (B), which are neces
sary for the growth of Infants and
for maintaining the health of the
adult. Children who do not have
these two elements in sufficient
quantities in their diet are 'apt to
have "rickets" no reserve energy,
and are more susceptible to disease
than those who have been trained
from infancy to take one quart of
milk a day. This quart can be so
divided that part can be used in the
preparation of the child's food, as in
milk soup, custards, junket, etc., and
Hip rpmainrlor a hpvprapp. I
Value cf Milk As Fcod
Many people have regarded milk 1
as a beverage rather than a food.
One quart of milk is equivalent in j
food value to half a lof of bread ,
replaced in the form of butter on ;
bread. Powdered milk is not ltc
ommended for children, as that prod- j
uct, duiing condensation from the j
liquid to the powder, has :ost the
vitamines or growth producing suD- j
stance so necessary to children. How-,
ever, if one is living on a desert j
isle, stranded with a can of powder
ed milk, and some leafy vegetables
growing near, then by all means di
lute the powder and eat the vegeta
ble greens, as leaves of spinach, let
tuce, etc., contain some of the vi
tamines which are InCKing In pow
dered milk.

First
When you buy meat, make the butcher show
you the U. S. Government Inspector's stamp
and rest assured that you are not eating a
steer that had tuberculosis, or a hog that died
of cholera.
The rancher who slaughters a few cattle and
sells them to your local butcher is not a vet
erinary and is not posted on the methods ot
telling if an animal is diseased.
We have a U. S. Government Inspector at
our Packing House at Tovreaville (near Don
Luis) an expert veterinary who carefully
examines every animal killed and who puts
the U. S. stamp of approval on only those
found to be sound, healthy and fit for human
food.
Safety first! Your health is the best asset
you have. Don't run the risk of ruining it
by eating infected meat.

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
THE GREAT AMERICAN HOME
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK.Nov. 14. Stocks made
further substantial recoveries today
from their severe declines of the mid
week although there were signs that
the market had not adjusted itself.
The most noteworthy and hopeful
feature was the activity and strength
of rail3, accompanied by favorable ad
vices from Washington and the confi
dent accumulation of other standard
issus, as reported by commission
houses.
Temporary reversals of relatively
minor proportions succeeded the
strong opening, these oeng Rscnned
mainly to realizing for quick profits.
Another setback followed the publica
tion of the first call money rate of
14 per cent, the latter figure ruling
until the last hour, when successive
offerings forced the rate down to 8
per cent.
The condition of the time money
market was the one serious drawback
of the session. Virtually no funds
were obtainable at the 8 per cent bid,
even for renewals.
Transcontinental led the rails,
with Union Pacific in the foreground
at an extreme advance of 5 points.
C rangers and coalers were not far be
hind, with "cotton carriers, with many
secondary transportations, were high
er by 1 to 4 points.
General Motors fluctuated in a 20
point radius and closed at a loss of
about 8 points. Related shares, also
oils, steels and equipments eased at
the end.
tcliiefly for the half blood .una fine
grades. Prices for the finer grades
! ait I'O to 23 per cent higher, while
mexhum wools are generally steady
and the lower grades, from good quar
ter .bloods down, are 15 to 20 per cent
lower compared with June.
'""The manufacturing situation is
very strong and the tendency is for
higher prices to be named oa the
finished product."

FINANCIAL REPORT
NEW YORK, Nov. 14. Duns to
morrow will say: Readjustment of
an overextended speculative position
has made for more wholesome condi
tions in the securities markets and
the rescinding of tne coal strike or
der has strengthened business pros
pects. No widespread or serious In
terruption of manufacturing or trans
portation has resulted from the walk
out among the miners, and the grad
ual resumption of operations m the
bituminous fields has allayed appre
hension of a general industrial set
back through lack of fuel. Yet dif
ferent branches of enterprise ape still
greatly inconvenienced by labor
troubles that limit outputs at a time
when the fullest possible employment
at mills and factories is essential, and
a rise in Dun's index number of com
modity prices to a level closely ap
proximating the high record Tt,; the
summer reflects the growing shortage
of supplies of many necessaries. Re
ports of cancellations of merchants
commitments are less an indication of
diminished purchasing power than of
inability to have requirements ' satis
fied, and some interests with order
books already congested, have with
drawn salesmen from the road and
are rejecting offers of profitable con
tracts from new cttomers.

THE PRICE iS NOT
THE MOST
important consideration of an automobile, but VALUE
IS. This sums up the -policy of the Dort Motor Com
pany in perfecting the DORT CAR. The price of the
DORT is not PROHIBITIVE, but it is sufficient to
include important features that cheaper cars do not
have. At the same time it is much lower in price than
other cars which possess those features. It will, there
fore, satisfy the purchaser- who has paid more for a
car in the past, wnile to him who has paid less it will
prove an unexpected revelation. '
A VISIT TO THE BISBEE AUTO COMPANY
to inspect the newly arrived DORT CARS will well
repay the prospective automobile purchaser.

This declaration was made ester

With this idea, the campaign is to
be extended, ajid memberships may
now be obtained from Mrs. McVahe.

The following letter was received

outlined by law:
"Von received from the federal
board of vocational education a few

every handicapped veteran entitled

For your information and thnt of

"The federal board for vocational

The duties and ' limitations of the

"The federal board can:

their return to their old jobs.
"2. Provide . maintenance for such

"3. Provide allowance for families

I "Shift" Is Name of
New Step Invented
By Cananea Cancer
Of interest to those of either
sex, young or old, cripple or whole,
who indulge in the jiggling one
step and the sliding fox-trot, the
announcement that Mr. Truttman,
nf Cananea ' who accompanied Bob-
by Hale, leader or the Cananea
orchestra, to Risbee on Armistice
day, has perfected a new dance
which he calls the "shift." It is
said by those who have seen the
dance exemplified, that it has the
shimmy backed off the boards
when it comes to real artistry
and that it is live enough to sat
isfy the most of us.
'Only the pipneer can appreciate
what this lowly, patient little ani
mal meant in this country's devel
opment. Without him it certainly
wouldn't be what it is today. I
have always thought that the coat
of arms of Arizona should be em
blazoned wi'h the three things that
were instrumental, more than any
others, in making her the most
wonderful of the states, viz., the
Chinese cook, the tin can and the
burro. A wild combination, per
haps, but one which stood the acid
test, and never failed man in those
hard days of a country's making,
beforo the advent of woman cooks,
refrieerator cars, and 'flivvers.'
"Please be tolerant, you newcom
ers, to our four-footed mocking

PHELPS DODGE
! PRESIDENT TO
VISIT BISBEE
Walter Douglas, president of the
Phelps Dodge corporation, accompan
ied by Arthur James, vice president
and director, arrived in Cochise coun
ty yesterday afternoon and spent the
remainder of the day in Douglas.
Mr. Douglas and Mr. James 6topped
at Dawson, N. M., while en route to
Douglas, where they Inspected coal
mines owned there by the corpora-
Mon. While the officials found no
strike there, they , discovered that
many of the foreign-born miners had
I nnit working beinsr unwilling to labor
while a strike is on. ,
Speaking of the copper situation
Mr. Douglas had nothing of an en
couraging nature to give out. In fact,
he was decidedly pessimistic pf the
future until such time as the peace
treaty shall be ratified by all nations.
"There has been practically no sales
of copper for three months," said he.
"and until Germany and Austria are
allowed to make purchases, there is
little hope thnt sales will amount to
anything like "what is being produced,
which is perhaps around fifty per cent
of the normal output. As soon as the
peace treaty is made a real fact, I ex
pect to see improved conditions in
the copper market, and surely a much
greater demand in Europe for the red
metal."
Mr. Douglas and Mr. James win re
main in Arizona for several weeks for
the purpose of visiting and inspecting
j all the camps where their company
has interests, including Tyrone, New
i Mexico, Bisbee, Globe and Morenci,
I and Nacozari, Mexico. Mr. Douglas
has not been in Arizona for five
months, and Mr. James remarked that
he was last in Douglas just one year
ago today.
Mrs. Waller Douglas accompanied
her husband from New York and is
going on tonight to Santa Barbara,
Cal., to pay a short visit to friends
there, and to look over her home
property in Montecito, suburb of the
coast.
