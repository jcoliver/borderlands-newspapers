Day Before Uncle Sam's Fleet Steamed In; Vigilance
Redoubled.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. May 24. Four days before the American
destroyer flotilla arrived abroad, Berlin knew it was on
the way and to what port it was going, and the day be
fore the vessels steamed into Queenstown, German submar
ines had strewn mines about the harbor entranc.
This startling information revealing that German spies
not only are at work in this country but that they have a swift
and sure means of communicating America's war secrets to
the fatherland, came to the navy department today in a cable
gram from Rear-Admiral Sims at London.
The admiral said his information was positive. His dis
patch was not made public and for obvious reasons nothing
will be given out concerning how the news came into his pos
session nor about the precautions which defeated the German
plans and enabled the flotilla to speed safely through the mine
fields.' , m . - "v-
Immediate publicity was given the salient fact, however,
the department making certain that its purpose was to let the
people know of the activity and success of Teutonic spies and
to emphasize the necessity for absolute secrecy of conection
with naval operations or shipping movements.

May 16. KVw long they were in cross
ing the Atlantic or from what port they
sailed never has been announced, and
until word of the arrival came only a
few people in the United States knew
of it
No official would comment tonigni
on the possible means by which the
news was conveyed to Germany. If it
did not gb from a secret wireless plant,
it must have been carried in some dis
patch that the allied cable censers
passed as Innocent.
The result will be to redouble the
vigilance of the censors and of every
agency for the government engaged in
routing out the spy system.
Every German known to have been
connected with the espionage system
tf his government already is under ar
rest or under surveillance.
In announcing Admiral Sims' dm
patch, the navy department, through
the committee of public information,
said :
"The department calls attention to
the fact as proof that the German spy
systrm is still at work in this coun

Sfnkings Denied.
.WASHINGTON, May 25. A categor
ical denial that any American naval
vessels have been sunk in the war was
issued tonight by Secretary Daniels to
counteract a "camapign of vicious ru
mors that is being carried on so indus
triously by persons unknown."
It was the first official notice to be
taken of a flood bf reports of naval dls-
asters that started almost as soon as it
was known that American destroyers
were in the .war rone.
"It is with deep regret," the secre
tary said, "that I note the daily stream
of false reports of the sinking of
American ships. Brokerage wires are
a particular source for those baseles
rumors that cannot but be the cause t
anxiety to all the country, as well as
to the mothers and fathers of the na
tion who have sons at sea.
"The department has given repeated
assurances that its policy is to be one
of absolute frankness with respect to
disaster. If it should be that ships
are sunk, full information will be given
officially and quickly.
"The reason for these false rumors
cannot be ascertained. The one hope
is that the press will refuse to aid this
campaign of vicious rumor that is be
ing carried on so industriously by per
sons unknown."
FOR RED CROSS
ident Wilson issued a proclamation
designating the week of June 18 to
25 as Red Cross Week, during which
the people, of the United States will
be called upon to give generously and
in a spirit of patriotic sacrifice for
the support nd maintenance of this
work of national need.
Mr. Davidson, who at the Presi
dent's request became chairman! of
the war council, declared the $100,
000,000 fund which it is proposed to
raise quickly would only be a begin
ning. "We will respond in a way that will
electrify the world. The people of this
country are not only going to supply

Cabinet Members And Others
Engaged In Conduct of!
Struggle, Explain Needs of.
Nation To Editors. i
(By Review Leased Wire). '
WASHINGTON, May 25. Members 1
of the cabinet and others actively en- j
gaged in the conduct of the war out-.
lined war aims and needs today to '
a meeting of editors of the country's j
technical and trade publications. All j
emphasized the magnitude of the task I
facing the nation and urged the pub- j
Ushers to support the government in ;
the change from peace to war condl j
tions in industry.
The cabinet . of ficers and represen-i
tatives of the Council of National De- ,
fense told in detail of what the coun-;
cil is doing toward war preparations.
The food situaton was presented by j
Herbert C. Hoover, who will be named i
food administrator. The country, he
said, faces a war that probably will
last from two to five years.
That Allies' grain needs this year,
Mr. Hoover said, will amount to
about 1,000,000.000 bushels. America
and Canada with good crops can fur
nish 60 per cent of this without de
privation, but the Allies must haVe,
he declared, at, least 80 per cent of
their needs to : keep their efflciency
at the highest point.
Food Prices Too High
?"That means some deprivation for
us," said he, "but we must fill their
needs."
food prices in the United States
are too bigh, and if they continue at
the present level, he declared, wage
re-adjustments must come or the
working man cannot live. The first
thing for the administration to ac
complish, Mr. Hoover, added, is price
stability, not only for this country but
for the Allies.
Secretary Lane in setting forth the
purposes of the United States in en
tering the war said:
"We are fighting feudalism. The
German ruler is willing to'go to any
length to see a feudalistic system es
tablished. Our interest as a nation
and as a democratic people is involv
ed in the war. The power that would
do t hints that have been done, would,
if England were conquered, demand
Canada and we would live in haunt
ing fear the rest of our lives.
Allies Hard Pressed
"Put It In your editorials that Am
erica is fighting, for something real,
that we do not want to go back to
where one man can enforce his will
on a hundred million people."
Secretary Baker declared the out
come of this war would show wheth
er the world is really progressing.
"We are fighting." he said, "against
an Impossible philosophy which has
been founded on Industrial ambition
and aspiration. The imperial mind
has been so obsessed with the idea
of industrial supremacy that it has
lost its sense of moral standardism."
Every resource of the Allies. Mr.
Baker said; would be nearly exhaust
ed when the United States enters the
war. There is no wav to establish
permanent peaceSie declareK except
through exercise of the superior force
of the United States.
Criticism Welcomed

WASHINGTON. May 25. The size
of the nation's tax burden for the

senate finance committee today with

members are said, however, to re
gard material reductions of the house
revenue measure's $1,800,000,000 total
as necessary and certain.
Concensus of opinion in, apparently
favors an appropriation between $1.

eral tentative plans are under debate.
Among them la reduction or the sub

house levy of five per cent on the au

mittee sentiment Is said to be strong
ly against what has been termed the
house taxation of special industries.

upon by the committee. The rates

TIMELY FILM ADDED
TO
"Our Fighting Forces" Is Ad'
ded Feature At The Orph
eum Theatre This Evening.
The theme ,of "The Painted Lie,"
which plays at the Orpheum tonight
and Sunday, was suggested to Crane
Wilbur by the pathetic story told by
a girl who came to the studio seekjng
work. ' She admitted she was the
daughter of a well-to-do family well
known in the east. She was study
ing to be an artist and because, of
her beauty often posed in different
studios.
One of the 'members of the artist
colony, a sculptor, had asked her a
number of times to pose for him for
a statue but she did not care to pose
in the nude. He was angered by her
refusal and told her that either she
would- pose for him as he desired or
he would ruin her career as an artist.
When she still refused he turned a
Lust of her which he had been mod
eling into a full length nude figurd
and invited all the members of the
artist colony, her family and her
friends to his exhibition and at that
time did all he could to ruin the rep
utation of the young girl in the eyes
cf her friends.
Feeling the stigma attached to her
name this girl went west and sought
work in the pictures. Mr. Wilbur
not only engaged the girl, and she
appears in one of the small parts of
this production, but he utilized her
story as the basic theme of his pho
todrama, "The Painted Lie."
In addition the Orpheum, this even
ing and Sunday will show a recent
Pathe release entitled "Our Fighting
Forces." This film depicts1 various
phases of the United States army ser
vice and is interesting and instruc
tive throughout

AT THE STAR TODAY
The inimitable Charlie Chaplin in
"Love Pangs," and a thrilling west

the big double attraction to be shown
today at the Star theatre. Chaplin
cuts up some cf his craziest capers

movie comedian should be able to
laugh themselves into hysterics at the

"The Valley of Lost Hope." is just

many thrilling scenes. In one a com
plete train was wrecked tp front of
the camera to get the desired real
istic effect, and' in another a huge

many others almost equally as' spec

complicated and not too melo-drama-tic,
but carries just enough pathos,
humor and thrills to make It one that
should appeal to every movie fan.
Western pictures have. In some in
stances, been overdone, but the "Val

"All the way the road was littered

IS IT A JOKER?
Under the heading "The Joker," the Tombstone Pros
pector presents a new side to the county seat removal
controversy; and one which has received but little atten
tion from the average man In the Warren District In
the law, enabling counties to move their courthouses,
the Prospector alleges there is a 'joker.' According to
some well-versed attorneys, the allegation made by tho
Tombstone paper is correct. In any event it is exceed
ingly interesting to note the close call had by Bisbee and
the Warren District.
"Tie innocent looking5 little words, "CONVENIENT
NEAR" but meaning an awful lot and fraught with" dan
ger appear fn the County Seat Removal law. When
Douglas slipped those two deceptive words into the pres
ent county seat removal law they put one over our good
friends in Bisbee and at the same time harpooned War
ren, the city beautiful, for those two little words put in
by the Douglas real 'estate crowd crimped Bisbee, since
Bisbee had no site in her city limits and they knew that
Warren would have to incorporate before she could qual
ify. We don't blame Bisbee and Warren for feeling sore
at the Douglas crowd. Strange to say the Douglas crowd
is claiming that the Bisbeeites hare double crossed
them. Tombstoneites don't think that the Douglasites
should be peeved at the Bisbeeites because they would
not stay in the game after they discovered wherein they
were having their "appendix" cut out. It's no fun to have
the knife slipped into you and having the "slipper" look
you in the face and say "We know it hurts you Bisbee,
but be good and say you like it." So Bisbee and Warren
refused to stay, under , the anesthetic, woke up and stop
ped signing the petitions which would have landed tlia
court house in Douglas IF IT WAS MOVED AT ALU
and The Prospector wants to say to all that Douglas is
not "CONVENIENTLY NEAR" the great mining camp
if Bisbee."
A REFORM OF THE REFERENDUM.
A bad use is being made of the referendum, which lends
itself too easily to a bad use. It has seldom been in
voked in this state for a good, honest use. It has been
employed, says the Arizona Republican, in not all but
nearly all cases, to postpone the operation of laws which
it was evident the people would ratify when they could
no longer be denied the opportunity to ratify them. But
for so long, or for two years, the will of the people could
be thwarted. '
The referendum is now being invoked against several
lawt enacted by the last legislature, the law creating
highway commissions, the anti-gambling law and the
- redlight abatement law. The first named had the sup
port in the legislature of every progressive citizen; what
opposition was developed was traced to small 'politicians
and to those chronically opposed to expenditures for
public improvement. Every vicious element In the state
opposed the anti-gambling law and the redlight abate
ment law. They did what they coiild against them in
the legislature. Decent men and women supported them
and we all know that decency, when active and awake,
is .in the mapority in Arizona.
The opponents of these three laws know that they
will be overwhelmingly ratified when they are submitted
to the people, but they cannot be submitted before No
vember of next year. So, the effect of the referendum
will be to give nearly two years of grace to narrow-minded",
unprogressive citizens, to the- gamblers, the bawdy
and roadhouse keepers and to suc'i property owners as
wish to lease their property for immoral purposes.
We are not attacking the principle of the referendum;
it is a good one. All laws enacted by legislatures are not
good and it is right that the voters should be given a
chance to pass upon them and to prevent bad and vic
ious laws from becoming operative. The trouble liesp
the machinery of the referendum, which was set up in the
first place by visionary, chimerical, dreamy, impractical
men. Lie tlC rfst of the machinery of the popular rule
system it was! Intended for communities where all the
people are honest, unselfish, alert, intelligent and jeaiui
of their privileges and duties, and especially of the priv
ilege and duty of voting. Of course, there Is no such
conimunify, and until the millennium comes there will
never be such a community. But In such an imaginary
community the operation of the popular rule machinery
should be made as easy and convenient as possible. Thus

tary McAdoor told an audience a.
'Kansas City, Kan3., late today. His
remark came while he was speaking of
the fact that new inventions, princi
pally the undersea craft and the air
plane, had destroyed American isola
tion and made possible attack from
overseas.
j The remark was unexplained and he
made no further reference to it, either
in his speech or in private talks later.
The Kansas City, Kan., gathering
was the second the secretary ad
dressed while here. He followed J. vv.
,Goebel. of that city, who is president
of the American Bankers' Association,
and who. although born in Germany,
i made a plea for all persons in this
i country to support the govenrment anil
to subscribe to the roan.
Announcement yesterday of thei
program for the Red Cross benefit
entertainment to be given in this city
under the auspices of the local Red
Cross chapter, indicates, that the af
fair will prove one of the most en
joyable given here in many months.
The dates for the entertainment have
been tentatively set for next Thurs
day and Friday nights. On both the
nights the program will be given in
the Orpheum theatre, which Manager
Al Detloff has donated to the local
chapter. As soon as it is learned
when the big flve-reel patriotic film,
which will be a feature of the enter
tainment, can be obtained, the defi
nite dates of the entertainment will
be announced. ' .
The second part of the entertain
ment will consist of a series of pan
tomimes. The first will be in the form
of an animated cartoon representing
history-making events in Europe dur
ing the past three years. The char
acters will be portrayed by local high
school girls. An interpretive' dance,
"Day and Night," will follow, after
which a series of numbers will be pre
sented by the younger children of the
district The next pantomime will de
pict a soldiers' charge on a European
battlefield and the semi-final will por
tray a scene at' a" Red" Cross hospital
in the rear of the fighting line. Prom
inent young girls and matrons will
appear in the roles of Red Cross
nurses and members' bf the infantry
camp at Lowell have volunteered to
appear to add the final touch of mar
tial life to the scene. The program
will probably be concluded with a
grand tableaux, representing a vision
of the glorification of the Red Cross.
Descrjptlve music will be furnish
ed throughout the pantomime by the
Orpheum orchestra, under the direc
tion of Herbert Cribble. Admission
to the entertainments will be 50 cents

PERSHING CHEERED
DURING PLEA FOR
REDCROSS WORK
(Continued From Page One)
to supply a great deal more."
Describing the pitiable condition of
Northern France, Mr. Hoover said
that here alone was room for work
of rehabilitation that would cost $1.
R00.000.000. The duty of the United
States in that field Is clear, he de
clared. ."For France is sacificing her
men on a pyre devoted to liberty and
a pyre devoted to our protection."
A plea for France also was made
by General Pershing whose speech
was interrupted by cheers for the
man who is to be, the first to lead
American troops to the relief of the
French soil. He also declared tht
United States was not awake to the
meaning of the war,' and urged that
the Red Cross aid in bringing home
a realization that the situation is one
of "very grave seriousness."
Mr. Taft paid a tribute to the war
society and to President Wilson say
ing the nation had begun the war
rightly by calling a large army and
this step was largely due to the sec
retary of war and President of this
administration.
SAYS WAR TO LAST
FROM NO 5 YEARS
(Continued from pege one.l
that it is a crime to make more out
of the way than a normal profit." Thes
spirit of the administration, he said.
Is that comment and criticism are
the very life of a democracy. "
The purpose of exportation limita
tions and trading with the enemy
bills were explained by Secretary
Red field, who said the measures were
necessary as a protection for the
country's protection and resources.
What the general munitions boards
are doing was told by Frank Scott, its
chairman.
Dr. F. H. Martin, of the General
Medical Board, told of sending physi
cians to England and France. In both
countries, he said, war had denleted
the medical staffs. Howard Elliott,
of the general railroad board, said the.
railroads were overtaxed, but hoped
by discontinuing passenger schedules
and the expediting of the loading and
unloading of cars to give the country
better service.

PIN THIS UPON
WIFE'S DRESSER
Warns women against cutting
' corns and says they lift
right out.
Because style decrees that women
crowd and buckle up their tender toes
in high heel footwear they suffer from
corns, then they cut and trim at these
painful posts which merely makes the
corn grow bard. This suicidal habit
uay cause lockjaw and women are
earned to stop it
A few drops of a drug called freez
)ne applied directly upon a sore corn
;ives quick relief and soon the entire
?orn, ijot and all, lifts out without
pain. Ask the drug store man for a
quarter of an ounce of freezone, which
costs very little but is sufficient to re
move every hard or soft corn or callus
from one's feet
This drug is gummy but it dries In
a moment and simply shrivels up the
corn without inflaming or ever irri
tating the surrounding tissue or skin.
