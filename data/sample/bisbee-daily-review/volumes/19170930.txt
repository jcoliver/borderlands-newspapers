SOVEREIGNTY
OF CHINA THE!
PLEDGE GIVEN
Viscount Ishii, Head of Japan
ese Mission to United
States, Pledges Japan's
Friendship for this Country.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Sept. 29. Japan not
only will seek not to as.sail the in
tegrity or the soveriegnty of China
but eventually will be prepared to de
' fend Chinese independence against
any aggressor, Viscount Ishii, head of
the Japanese imperial mission to the
United States, tonight declared in pro
claiming a Monroe Doctrine of the far
east in an address at a banquet in
honor of the envoys as a culminating
event of their visit to New York.
Viscount Ishii's address was regard
ed as the most important he has de
livered since the arrival of the mission
in the United States. He discussed
frankly his country's aspirations and
desires as they relate to China and
denounced as propaganda of ill-will,
"the persistent cry of the closed door."
He did not hesitate to assert that in
seeking the trade of China his coun
try possessed natural advantages in
trade by means of which it was bound
to succeed in china, "unless we are
very stupid or very inactive." In
leading up to the discussion of the
open door, he said:
- Thankt New York.
"It is with no light appreciation of
the honor you have done us and the
nation I represent no lack of know
ledge of my own shortcomings that
I acknowledge your courtesy and hos
pitality throughout our visit to the city
of New York. I cannot hope to meet
the obligation or to find words fitting
the occasion. I can olny hope that
as time goes on other opportunities
may come to me and to my country
men to demonstrate our appreciation
in some small degree. Let me. assure
you that our door is open and while
we cannot offer you an opportunity
equal to this, the latch string hangs
outside always for the man from New
York and the man from America.
Door Always Open.
"The door is always open. It has
been always opened; it always must
remain open, not only to the guest
who comes to trot around our little is
land for a round of pleasure but to the
representatives of these vast commer
cial Interests represented so well in
C this great commonwealth.
A Natural Advantage.
"In spite of all the effort to make
you believe that Japan, as she grew
stronger, . was always trying to close
the doors, I tell you that there never
bas been an hour when our common
sense or our sense of our own respon
sibility failed us. Why close our door
In vain of our pledges or endeavor
to close our neighbor's doors, when
we are in honor bound to protect it?
The opportunity for you to trade in
Japan or China has never been an
m equal opportunity in its literal sense.
As you went far afield and brought
us knowledge of the west, taught us
how to grow and how to trade, so we,
as we gained wisdom, knowledge and
strength .went into other fields to
trade and learn. We went to China
where the door was open to us as to
you and we have always realized that
there nature gave us an advantage.
There was no need there is no need
to close that door on you because
we welcome your fair and honest
competition in the markets every-
JT where. We are trading there where
we have a natural advantage and
where, unless we are very stupid or
very inactive, we are bound to succeed
and we are trading .here where your
advantage is equally and natuarlly as
great.
No Closed Door.
"I am persuaded that the grumb
lings and the whisperings about a
door closed in China by the Japanese
against America did not come from
the broad and generous heart of the
enterprising American in New York
or elsewhere but is the result of 10
years of an enemy's effort to create
prejudice and distrust. Gentlemen, I
assure you that a closed door in China
has never been and never will be the
policy of my government. The door
is open, the field is there. We wel
i come co-operation and competition all

HIS COUNTRY
FINAL DECISION
REACHED ON THE
IWARTAX MEASURE
House and Senate Conferees
Adopt Final Report on Bill.
Excess Profits and Incomes
Remain as in Senate Bill.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 29. Final
agreement on the $2,700,000,000 war
tax bill was reached late today by
senate and house conferees, and the
report will be presented to the house
Monday. Levies of approximately $1,
000,000,000,000 on war excess profits
and $842,000,000 on incomes were left
unchanged, but a new system of cal
culating excess profits was adopted.
Invested Capital
The conference report provides that
the graduate tax of from 20 to 60 per
cent on excess profits of corporations,
partnerships and individuals shall be
levied on a basis of invested capital
compared with invested capital of the
three the pre-war years, 1911-12-13.
This is a substitute for the excess
war taxes from 12 to 60 per cent,
based upon a similar comparison of
pre-war and present profits.
Income Tax
The Income tax section was virtu
ally unchanged, except for re-arranse-ment
of sur taxes on incomes bet ween
$15,000 and $40,000. The graduated
sur taxes of from 1 to 50 per cent on
incomes from $.runo to those $1,000,000
and over were approved.
The senate increase of from ? to 4
r?r cent of the income tax on cor
porations, jo'uw stuck companies iir.d
Insurance companies was approved,
with the new normal individual t:ix
of 2 per cent on incomes of unnmniod
persons in excess t;f $10,000 and on
married of more 1'ian $2000.
Graduated Profits
The graduated excess profits rates
are 20 per cent of the excess profits
not in excess of 15 per cent of the
invested capital for the taxable year;
25 per cent in excess of 15 per cent
and not over 20 per cent of such capi
tal; 35 per cent on excess over 20
and under 25 per cent of capital; 45
per cent on excess over 25 per cent,
and 33 per cent of capital and a maxi
mum of 60 per cent on profits in ex
cess of 33 per cent of such capital.

Papal Proposal
for Peace Called
2 Very Courageous
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BERLIN. Sept. 29. (Via London.)
(British Admiralty per Wireless
Press.) The eGrman secre'ary for for
eign affairs. Dr. von Kuehlmann, be
fore the reichstag main committee said
he could not venture to say what
would be the immediate outcome of
the papal steps toward peace.
"This courageous initiative of the
pope," said the secretary, "will mark
an epoch In history. The p'ope threw
the word 'peace' into the turmoil of
battle when events threatened to
transform Europe into bloodstained
ruins.
Welcome Initiative.
"The German people and govern
ment, wh'ose consciousness of their
strength always made it easy for them
to emphasize their willingness to con
clude honorable peace, welcome the In
itiative of the Curia, which made it
possible for them to set forth again
their national policy in a clear, un
ambiguous manner. I say intent.'jn
ally. 'national policy as the reply of
the German government embodies the
desires, embodies the majority opinion
in Germany.
"For our purely German develop
ment, the note is also a landmark. It
is the first result 'Jf collaboration be
tween all the factors of the govern
ment. That has been attempted here
for the first time."
Perfect Confidence.
This collaboration added the secre
tary, is of a kind which statesmen hav
ing the German foreign policy at heart
might regard with perfect confidence.
He denied there is in Germany one pol
icy of the (,'jvernmeut and another ot
the people.
Dr. von Kuehlmann denied there
was divergence of opinion and aim
anions the leading men or between the
imperial administration and the field
marshals. The chancellor continued:
Government Supported.
"I believe f can say with full right
that all attempts of the enemy to drive
a wedge between the German people
and the German government by prop
agation of the fiction that the German
people does not stand behind the kais
er will be repulsed in crushing man
ner by the support given this docu
ment." JAPS VISIT WEST POINT.

Crops Hurt
As the storm swept inland it damag

had diminished greatly later today and
had passed out fever the south Atlantic

Reports tonight from Biloxi Miss.,
stated anxiety was felt for the safety
of the crews of four schooners and a
power boat which had not reported.
CONFEREES FAR APART.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 29. A wide
dlvLson developed today between coal
operators and miners of the central
competitive field over readjustment
of wage scales. The miners demand
ed an immediate tentative raise await
ing the fuel administrations report
toward revision of prices. The opera
tors refused and proposed a 10-day
suspension of negotiations.
Dr. H. A. Garfield, fuel administra
tor, will take up proposed coal price
revisions next week.
GERMAN INTERNED.
DOUGLAS. Sept. 29. Charles W.
Roggenbusch, arrested here September
22 as a German spy. was ordered to
day by department of justice officials
Interned for the period of the war.
He was taken in custody while dis
tributing alleged diaries of French
soldiers In which the rutblessness of
German fighting methods was empha
sized. Papers taken on the person of
Roggenbusch indicated that he bad
served in the French army during the
present war.
j Press Ban Still
Holds News from
! Flanders Battle
(By Review Leased Wire).
At a late hour the ban on press dis
patches from the Franco-Belgian front
apparently had not beeii raised and
the world was left to guess the rea
for it.
Field Marshal Haig's report in the
forenoon was of routine .character.
: merely announcing reciprocal artil
j lery fighting. The Berlin statement
was similarly unilluminating.
From the French front violent artil
j lery activity was reported east of the
Meu.se in the Verdun region.
Cadorna Troaoi Active.
I The offlcaI 8tatement frora RotnP
shows General Cadorna giving his tn
fantry rein again, with the result that
an important gain was effected in the
Monte San Gabriele region northeast
of Gorizia. iA surprise attack carried
out with complete success gave the
Italians a line rectified to their ad
vantage between Zella di dol and the
northern slopes of Monte San Gab
riele, 224 prisoners and a few machine
guns being captured in the operation.
The new line was solidly maintained
against violent infantry counter at
' tacks. The Italian air operations were
again of importance, the airmen once
more sweeping the Austrian naval
: base at Pola, where the arsenal and
submarine base were bombed by a
big squadron. Austrian military es
tablishments In the Carso zone were
also successfully, attacked.
September Casualties.
How heavy the fighting was on the
I British front In Flanders and north
' ern France during September, despite
the absence of attacks on a large
scale made its closing days, was Indi
cated by the figures of casualties re
ported during the month, showing a
total of 104.59S of which the killed
comprised 1S.93S. These figures com
pare with total casualties of 59,811
for August and 119.549 for September
a year ago, the third month of the
Somm battle.
Costly to Germans.
Friday night's German aid raid on
England, was an abrotive affair, and !
costly for the Germans, resulting In
negligible material damage and no
casualties as far as reported. Tha
airmen were unable to reach London,
the alert and effective work of British
anti-aircraft guns and air forres set
ting up a barrier which was not
pierced, while two ot the German ma
chines were shot down on the coast.

lish Capital Again. Is Third
Incursion During the Pres

(By Review Leased Wtrei.
LONDON, Sept. 29. Hostile air
plane raided London again tonight.
An official announcement says:
From Southeast.
"Hostile airplanes crossed the
coasts pf Kent and Essex in gdoups be
twen ight and nine o'clock. Several
attacks were made upon London and
some bombs were dropped in the
northeast and southeastern districts.
Bombs were also dropped at various
places in Kent and Essex. No reports
of casualties have yet been received."
Warning Given.
London's warning of an impending
raid was given quickly by policemen
riding through the streets with "take
cover" signs on their breasts and ev.
eryone hurried to sheltered places.
Soon the distant roar of guns was
j heard. Then the explosions of guns
! and the crack of shrapnel bursting in
the air came nearer. The flash of the
bursting shells in the night was inces
sant. Fitrn all directions the defense
guns boomed.
Bombs Dropped.
Mingled with the sound of the guns
the whirring of gothas was heard over
head. Bombs began to drop. The fire
of anti-aircraft guns seemed heavier
than on previous raids and it was oo
v?jus that barrages were being thrown
up to defeat the raiders. At this time
it appears that the barrages at least
prevented the raiders from having
their own way.
Fight In Air.
During the raid the staccato rattle
of machine-guns high in the air was
evidence that the raiders were being
hotly engaged by the British .Tiers. In
the brilliant moonlight civilians who
ventured to look up were unable to
see anything of the machines although
they could hear directly overhead the
! whirr of the engines. In another hour
the guns were roaring in the distance
and then they ceased entirely.
"All Clear."
When the signal "all clear" was giv
en all London came out of its shelters
and went home to bed. The mc'Jn
was still brilliant although a fog
which was favorable to the raiders,
began to set in. Some cautious per
sons remained near she:er. fearing an
other raid might occur before uArning.
Beirut Is Bombed.
LONDON. Sept. 29. An official
statement tonight says:
"Naval aircraft made a bombing raid
Thursday on storehouses, etc.. on the
southwestern side of Beirut harbor
(Syria). Many direct hi is were rib
served and fires were started. AH our
machines returned safely. The store
house of the Mole was afterwards
shelled by a cruiser and set afire."
Successes In Africa.
LONDON. Sept 29. The war office
tonight announced a further success
against German forces in German East
Africa where British troops occupied
an important supply-base of the enemy
82 miles south of Kilwa.
May Retaliate.
LONDON. Sept. 29. There are the
best of reasons for believing that the
continued German airplane attacks on
England with tne plain purpose of kill
ing civilians will not pass without re
taliation. The idea of killing women
and children is repugnant to the Brit
ish mind, but Just as the army ws
forced t use poisonous gas axainst
the German soldiers, or be in the posi
tion of fighting win one hand tied be
hind its back so the British will be
compelled to tight the eGrmans in the
air by bombing Ge-man cities, accord
ing to belief n"ow renerally held here.
They have the necessary machines,
and better aviators, but heretofoie pre
ferred to use them solely against the
fighting men.
Defenses Good.
The defenses of England against at
tack have proved to be almost as ef
fective against airplanes as they were
against Zeppelins, which have practic
ally been eliminated since the death
oftheir inventor. But the fact that air
planes can scatter and present such a,
small target makes them more difficult
to deal with.
This is shown by the experience of
one British squadron tn France, which

"But this propaganda of ill-will has
by no means stopped with the persist
ent cry of "clotted door.' Much has
been written about Japan's policy to
ward China as being one that sought
only the aggrandizement of Japan and
the confusion, disruption or oppres
sion of China. Here again let me as
sure you. The policy of Japan with
regard to China has always been the
same. We want good government,
which means peace, security and de
velopment of opportunity in China.

Immediately reacts upon Japan. Our

The entire affair was given undev
the direction of A. J. Radzwill, one of
the most popular members of th reg

ally well designed and executed. The
recreation room was a mass of gay
colors. Stacks of rifles, with bayo

Get-togther Banquet
The Methodist banquet at Y. M. C.
A. Thursday evening was one of the
most successful and enjoyable social
occasions ever enjoyed by that con
gregation. One hundred and twenty
five guests were present, so that the
banquet hall overflowed into the north
room, but alj came together for the
program which followed the dinner.
The dinner Itself was most excellent
in menu and in preparation. A. O.
Friedel gave a talk on "the business
end of the church work." and said
that many years of service as financial
secretary enabled him to say that
this one had been the most success
ful, financially, in the history of the
church. This he attributed to better
business methods. Miss Stimpson in
a very happy and original way spoke
on "Our Young People,"' and Miss
Moyer responded to the toast "The
Ladies' Aid Society." Mrs. Teufert
and Mrs. May Thomas English gave
read'ngs that in each case called fortli
earnest encores. A. B. Richardson, an
invited guest, gave a very witty talk
and congratulated the church on the
success of the occasion. It was stated
by the toastmaster that about fifteen
young men have already gone from
this congregation to the war, and two
more, who were present, would leave
I with the next contingent next Tues
day. These are Charles Cole and Eric
Nelson. Both men responded with
short talks. "America" was sung and
the meeting adjourned.

Sunday Morning, September 30, 1917.
When the British took the little Belgium village of
Zonebeke last Wednesday and held it against all counter
attacks they wiped out a bitter blot on the island's flag.
In the"' spring of 1915 the Prussians, with the aid of artil
lery, drove the British from this town with terrible losses.
Retreating foot by foot, opposing the German artillery
with rifle fire, the most famous regiments of the Britisii.
army, were forced far back into the Ypres salient to the
west. Now this salient thrusts its crimson edges far
eastward and the dominant ridges of Zonnebeke are
held by the English, Australian and Scottish troops
against alt that the Prussian can do. The German slaugh
ter here was the most terrible of the war. The reverse
of 1915 has been more than avenged.
The price of fame was never more strongly emphasized
than in the career of the great aviators of the present
war. Germany had two, Immelman and Boelke, who bad
brought down some thiny odd allied planes apiece, sure
ly enough for any hero to retire on and wear his laurels
with pride. But the fame of these two doubled their
dangers and the demands made upon them by their coun
trymen. Now Guynemer, the 4rilliant French flier, with
over fiftey Boche machines to his credit, has
paid the price of fame with his life. Fifty times a hero
and his danger increased at every exploit. All the Ger
man fliers were laying for him. His reputation was such
that he could never refuse combat no matter how terri
ble the odds against him. He died in a fight against five
enemy planes where a lesser light might well have been
expected to have sought safety in flight. Every one is
expected -to live up to his or her reputation, and the
greater their exploits in the past the greater they must
continue to be. There are no yesterdays in the intense
struggle for a place in the limelight of today.
Reports are consistent that union labor is fighting Bis
bee and urging its members not to come here. Why
Because of the I. W. W. deportations? It can be nothing
else, for conditions here are better and wages higher
than in mines elsewhere. Then if this is the reason,
union labor is perilously close to the I. W. W. in the lat
ter's fight to criple the copper industries of the nation.
Bisbee is not a union camp, neither is it a non-union
camp. It ie simply a copper camp where there is plenty
of work at the highest wages. The government is clap
ping I. W. W. leaders in Jail. UDion labor seems to
have taken up the fight against Bisbee where the wob
biles left off when they were cast beyond the pale. It
is dangerous ground when the nation is at war. Recent
strikes have aroused public sentiment against strikers in
union strongholds where it was never known before. War
time may be a good time to strike, in one way, but it is
a mighty bad time in another way. Public sentiment is
the mightiest force in this country, and public sentiment
is against strikes during the period of the war.
In her note to the pope on the peace proposition Ger
many offers to contribute "a share of the compensation
to be paid Belgium. What does the Prussian mean by
"a share." This is a part and parcel of the Hun diplomacy.
"A share" might well be a hundredth part. Nothing
specific has ever appeared in a Berlin peace proposal
What the Kaiser really means in his peace overtures
will not be brought out until a truce is called and the
negotiations begin. Then it will be too late. The war
will be to fight again with Germany replenished Just that
much by the interval of the truce. Fortunately the allied
governments understand this subterranean style of di
plomacy, .'laving gained the knowledge at a costly price.
Germany perpetrates her little joke at the end of the note
by demanding a guaranty of Belgium "That any such
menace as that which threatened Germany in 1914 would
in future be excluded." It is a tragic joke. Belgium's
menace to Germanyln 1914 was only the little kingdom's
refusal to allow the Hun to violate her territory. Bel
gium's menace was the eftort of her little army to stein
the tide of the green gray hosts that swept over her and
enslaved her aud s-polled Iier and all but destroyed her.
SUNDAY (MORNING SERMON.
Turn you to the stronghold, ye prisoners of hope;
even today do I declare that I will render double unto
you." Zechariah 9-9.
Few greater verses than the above can be found in the
scriptures. They are well calculated to help a broken
pilgrim upon his way. Every mortal Is a prisoner of
hope. The skein of his life is wrapped upon a spool and
the strand comes off in colors that are both sombre and
gay. We sit in doors today and Depression and Dis
couragement are our only guests. We know not which
way to turn or what to do "Turn you to the stronghold,"
urged the old prophet
What stronghold, you ask? Away back deep in your
heart and soul, further than the old Chief Cochise ever
penetrated to his stronghold in the mountains to the
north of us, lies a citadel that can never be taken unless
you voluntarily surrender it yourself. It is called Hope,
and God Himself placed it there when He closed the
gates of Eden to His first children.
The man who hopes is never lost; is never beaten.
For from Hope are born those shining children. Patience,
Courage and Endeavor. "I will render double unto ye,"
promised the prophet But you must turn to the strong
bold. You must do your part You must love if you
would be loved. You must weep over the sorrows of
others if you would have tears shed for you to restore
your soul. You must sow kindness to reap in kind. You
must cast bread upon the waters if you wish to flood the
tide to bring your treasure ship from over the sea. You
must hope for things; hope to do them, if you would have
them, would do them.
The singer is mute and he grieves over his lost voice
but his song lives on in the iiearts of those who heard
it The dreamer sits repining, but his dream, which he
told to a friend, inspired another arm to strike and move
the world. The lips that smiled are set now to suffer
ing, but that smile of long ago shines still like a lamp of
heaven before the eyes of a loved one.
Look to the stronghold of hope and you shall have
double. It will come to you from what you have done.
If your body is broken your mind may be the greater for
it. If your mind is slow and dull, yet your hands may be
the stronger and the more kindly as a recompense.
The tree died and men who passed that way said that
was its end. But a shoot sprung up beside it, 6ap of its
sap and wood of its wood, and grew larger still and
leaved and spread its shade for a hundred seasons.
When it is darkest, look to the stronghold; there is
always a light there. When Dismay binds you and
beckons to his terrible son. Despair, to come into your
house, look to the stronghold of which the prophet prom
ised so much. If you look that way no evil can enter
your door that is too great for you to bear.
"Prisoners of Hope." And she is a dear mistress. She
has sent men westward ever since Japhct left Asia to
t
his brother Shem and crossed the eastern fringe of Eu
rope. Ever westward to something new. Hope leads
us on and on. We hope to do better, bigger work tomor
row. We hope for a better job, more pay. We hope to
be cured of our sickness of today. Tomorrow our wounds
will heal and our friends come back and our true love
relent and smile again.
Today we look with heavy eyes at the waves of the
sad and solemn sea. Yet down deep in our heart is the
hope that tomorrow the sails of our long past due treas
ure ship will loom white and grand against the sky.
It is all a part of a most wise and immutable plan that
we must toil today and endure the grind aud bear the
burdens and bend our backs at the sowing without any
word of what tomorrow will bring. Our span of life is
but a day. Let us smile a little and work a little and
play a little and pray 3 little and look to the stronghoM
like brave prisoners of hope, for did not the prophet
promise that double should be rendered unto us on some
other day, whether in this world or the next, he did not
specify. And what does it matter, just so it comes to us?
Be sure it will come when it is needed most. And it will
come only to fill empty hands that have toiled and rested
lightly and with gentleness upon a brother's bowed head
It will come only to hearts that held on to hope to the
last It will come to gladden only those eyes that have
looked up from the earthly fields of toil and pleasure and
sighs and laughter to the stronghold of those Thrc-3
Graces, Faith, Hope and Charity.

Plans for the addition to the state
capitol have recently been started by
Consulting Architect John 1. Lyman
of Tucson. Actual construction work
on the addition will not commence for
several weeks, it was staied. The
plans now being drawn are for a com
pleted capitol rather than lor that
portion of the addition which can be
erected with the $125,000 appropria
tion. Work on the completed build
ing will be carried along as far as
the $125,000 appropriation will permit.
the remainder to be done when other
appropriations are made by the legis
lature. The third Arizona contingent ( of
drafted men to entrain October 3 for
Camp Funston will be composed of
1389 men, the same number that com
prised the second contingent. While
no official schedule has yet been an
nounced, it is expected that the plans
made for the entrainement of the sec
tingent will be followed out October
3. The fourth and final contingent
of 15 per cent will be comprised of
517 men. according to figures an
nounced in the office of Colonel Fred
S. Breen Friday morning. No date
for the entrainment of these men has
been announced.. It is expected, how
ever, that about two weeks will elapse
between the entrainment of the third
and fourth contingents. This will de
pend entirely on the progress made
at the training camps In examining
and fitting the men of the third contingent.
County Briefs
O. Barnwell has been temporarily
transferred from Benson to Bowie as
agent of the Southern Pacific, pending
the appointment of a regular agent to
succeed W. H. Lawrence, deceased.
Rudolph Castaneda was a recent vis
itor to relatives in Benson. Mr. Cas
taneda, who is a civil engineer in the
employ of the Southern Pacific Vf Mex
ico, was enroute to his headquarters
at Guadalajara.
The E. P. & S. W. has reopened the
station at Courtland on account of the
increase shipment of ore from that
place and J. R. Price who has been
telegraph operator at Tombstone, has
been appointed as agent
A broken man stood at the bar ot
the federal district court Friday when
Walter D. Coakley was called, to plead
to the indictment found at Prescott
several months ago, charging him with
the embezzlement of $10,000 while ac
!ng as a registry clerk in the Phoenix
postoffice. There was no one in the
court room, as it had not been known
that Coakley was to plead. Coakley
was without a lawyer. John T. Hughes,
who happened to be in the court room,
was appointed to represent him. The
embezzler pleaded guilty and took, the
stand to tell the story, now generally
known. It wrenched .his emotions to
tell of the theft, but when he came
to the alleged episodes with waitress
es, that had been reported and which
were said to have led to his arrest,
he became hysterical in declaring his
loyalty to Mrs. Coakley. To end the
scene, painful to the court as to the
defendant. Judge Sawjtelle suggested
gently that the statement be made in
writing and filed with the court. Sat
urady was set for passing sentence.
C. M. Zander, chairman of the state
tax commission; Charles R. Howe and
Rudolph Kuchler, members of the com
mission, have been appointed by Gov

the National Tax association at At
lanta, Ga., November 13-16. C. E. Gen
try, assessor of Yavapai county; E.
A. Hughes, assessor of Cochise coun
ty, and James H. Kirby, assessor of
Greenlee county, have been named as
alternates. An initial move is to be
made at this confei?i:fce for a ruode!
system of taxation which it Is hoped
that the various states may be led to
draw upon from lime to time, thus
carrying out a much-needed co-operation
toward uniformity of taxation and
an abandonment of conflict due to
overlapping jurisdiction. A compre
hensive discussion of the problems of
securing efficiency and care in the
making of local assessments will be
considered by a group of the most ex
perienced tax administrators in the
country. The present decided trend
toward income taxation by the states
will be thoroughly discussed by the
leading experts in that particular field.
First Lieutenant Fred J. Wright has

With silver climbing daily, it be
gins to look as if Tombstone is soon to
experience a boom of nj sma''. pr
portion. Men fro n over tho couutry
are making inquiries regarding both
silver and manganese properties or
which there are many for sale ana tor
lease. There are several very g'ood
maganese properties available that
carry lots of silver. The Old Guard
will soon be running on manganese
ores.
The Bunker Hill Mines Company, a
Phelps Dodge subsidiary, is making
quite a number of leases where cnio-
rides are taking nit some very high
grade silver lead ores. It is said some
jf the chlorides are making big clean
ups. The company itself is concentre
ting its efforts on manganese ores and
is said to be shipping 500 tons of high
grade manganese monthly to eastern
buyers and shipping 100 carloads of
manganese tailings for silver recovery
at Douglas. This is in addition to
other ores shipped from their, various
properties.
What a change in the standing of the I. W. W. since
May of this year! Then the agents of this detestabl3
organization boldly entered a community and stood on
the street corners and the platforms of union halls and
started a strike and it carried it on with an impudence
that amounted to arrogant assumption of power. No
citizen or' property owner or official dared to make a
move to check them. Their red cards were the only
pass word and their pickets held the streets of many
towns. Then came the Bisbee blow. It was a fatal
stroke. It showed the rent of the nation what could be
done against this menace. It shook the confidence of tho
rank and file in their leaders. It stirred Haywood aud
others to wild speech and wilder threats. It ended yes
terday in the action of the government in establishing
their status as traitors under the law. Blanket warrant:?
authorized another raid against the Chicago headquarters
and landed Haywood himself in jail, along with 150 -f
his followers. Grand jury action with federal comnii.i
8 i oners striking the blow marked the end. Five short
mouths ago this order was supreme in its own field. To- I
dav it is an outlaw without standing and its leaders Iik
hind bars. The L'ireats it shrieked only a few weeks ngo j
while smarting under the success of the Bisbee deporta- j
Hon brought its cud quickly. Commissioner Fitts finish
ed what Sheriff Wheeler began. A splendid start aud a
fine fiuis-U.
Vice President and Mrs. Marshall

i urge upon all those firms, companies, 1

burden, to subscribe as liberally as
possible to the second issue of Liberty
Bonds of the United States which is
offered to the public, beginning Octo

regard thereto:
We are in this war; we must win
and to do it, the money must be found.
The more the government will al
low you to loan to it, the less you will
be taxed; ease taxation by buying a
Liberty Bond. ,
Money is wasted on unnecessaries
in our country which, if loaned to it,!
might turn the scale to victory and
save thousands of precious lives.
Economize and save. Extravagance
must stop.
When you buy a Liberty Bond, you
have what is as good as money, to
borrow on or to sell and it pays good

Taxes are a dead expense; they
never come back; they pay not inter

not buy!

COURIER FOR MILES
IN GERINIMO FIGHT
DIES IN THE NORTH
A. D. Whaley, Old Timer In
State and Courier for Gen
eral Miles During Apache
Troubles, Succumbs to Illness.
Word has been received in the War
ren District of the death, in the Pio
neer's Home at Prescott, of A. D.
Whaley, a prominent old time of the
state. He died on Wednesday after
a lingering illness.
This valiant old - timer broe a con
spicuous name during the Geronimo
Indian troubles, and his gallantry was
such that he was chosen by General
Nelson A. Miles as his courier during
that campaign, when the Apache
chieftain was finally subdued. Mr.
Whaley performed a dangerous duty,
at times even invading the domain
where this Indian loitered, as well did
he carry dispatches to scattered com
mands which extended into the Sierra
Mcdre wilderness of Mexico. In some
of his exploits he was shot at several
times, and in one instance was badly
wounded, but he invariably returnej
to headquarters, earning the name of
an intrepid man.
The deceased was a miner by voca
tion, and first came to Arizona, arriv
ing at Prescott in 1869, leaving later
for the old Vulture mining camp near
Wickenburg, where he worked for a
rew years. When the Wickenburg In
dian massacre occurred in 1S72, he
was in this county, and offered his
services to take the field in pursuit
of the Apache. There is one matter
of exceptional interest to be linked
to this man in his keen boservation of
any locality, wherein he remembered
every landmark, and there is not a
region In the south but what at one
time or another he had not visited.
He knew every water hole along the
boundary, and in one instance it is
reported, saved the lives of a scouting
party as they were preparing to drink
.'rem a poisoned pool.
Mr. Whaley finally located in Co
chise county, acquiring a large acre
age and a few head of. cattle. Later
he left this county and returned to
Prescott where he has lived for many
years.
The deceased had reached the ripe
Tee of 83 years, and was born in Ru
dolph county, Georgia. Not a mem
ber of his family survives. He was
the first born and the last to go.

TOMBSTONE'S OLD
TOMBSTONES RiCH
E ROMANCE
Cemetery On the St David
Road Contains Many Rough
Pine Boards Marking
Graves of Pioneers.
A mile out of Tombstone, on the S
David road, is a cemetery. Behind a
plain iron fence, it lies like a thous
and other little cities of the dead. And
like a thousand other little cities of
the dead, it has its aristocracy. Granite
shafts and marble stones rise above
some of the graves in impressive, oft
times haughty, grandeur.
But in a far corner lies the poorer
section of this little city. There plain
wooden slabs mark the final resting
places of paupers and "old-times"
alike. Perhaps if some of these could
speak, stories for richer in romance
than we have in books would be torn,
perhaps the great tragedy would he
voiced.
It is a question when the first burial
there took place, although it was prob
ably a miner a' man lured from his
home by gold and the dream of riches,
and a man who met his end in an ab
rupt manner. Death came suddenly
to many back in the days when Tomb
stone was rich in gilded richness and
gay in gaudy gayness. Among the first
scores of rough markers to rise in that
cemetery, half doubtless, were carved
crudely with a name, and "born, ;
died, ; Shot, ". Indeed there
must have been many cases where the
date of birth was unknown, and some
cases where the name itself was un
known; but each pine board carried
something across its face if nothing
more than the terse "R. I. P."
In all Cochise county there is noth
ing quite as fascinating as this quaint
Did burial ground. New in years al
most presumingly new it seems cen
turies older than the burial grounds of
the Pilgrim fathers in New England;
which, with their well kept grass and
their deep carved stones, bring those
who lie below almost near to us. But
these people men, women, and chil
dren who are buried under these
wooden slabs in Tombstone seem a
fanciful part of the past. Nature has
tatcen a hand and obliterated whatever
trace of realism there was about them
by wiping clean from those slabs what
little remained of their history. Per
haps the shadows of the men if one
cares to believe in shadows still
haunt the "Crystal Palace" and the
"Bird Cage." but like the "Crystal Pal
ace" and the "Bird Cape" they are a
part of that which is dead and which
is soon to be forgotten. A new
Tombstone slowly rises to take the
place of the old; a substantial western
city gradually replaces the famous
mining camp and what has been ios
in the wealth and population of the
Tombstone of yore, is made up in a
new quality which assays one hundred
per cent pure. The new Tombstone
has the right spirit, and the new Tomb
stone will go ahead.
And the little cemetery on the St.
Dsvid road? That will exist. There
that which is old and that which is
new sleep fJKether It is the one link
that binds the present with the past.

Executive of "Show Me' State
Writes to Local People Ask
ing Information Regarding
. . System in Vogue in County.
Governor Gardner, of Missouri, con
sequent upon wide publicity received
upon the recent proposal that all Ari
zona prisoners be removed from the
jails and put upon cross-sta'.e highway
improvement, has written here lr fur
ther information concerning the plan.
Governor Gardner states that he has
decided to put all prisoners in Missouri
on road work and endorses the Arizona
idea. He has decided upon impiOve
nient of the Old Trails transcontinen
tal automobile highway division from
Kansas City to St Louis and until this
stretch of road across the state is
hard surfaced, all prisoners will be em
ployed upon it. Later the prisoners
will be turned upon laterals from the
main highway to the more important
centers of population and industry.
Governor Gardner proposes as an in
centive to prisoners to make good ou
the work that one day will be dropped
from each sentence for every three
weeks of work in conformity with
camp rules.
Boards of supervisors and county en
gineers in Arizona are responding to
newspaper attention which has been
given to the proposal that the prisons
be emptied and the remainder of sent
ences be served in placing a highway
across the northern part of the state
and another across the southern end in
such condition that they can efficient
ly handle automoble trucks with what
ever manner of supplies war time
emergencies might dictate from state
.ine to state line.
In counties where the experiment of
using prison labor On road work has
been tried without the success that
lias been attained in Cochise, where it
base been found that all costs attend
ing the employment failed to bring it
up to the cost of free labor, there is
now being considered the fact that
free labor is too much needed in the
mines, agricultural sectipns and lum
ber districts to permit of its being
made use of on road work, at least so
long as any other labor is available.
It is also being considered that regard
less of cOst in some counties above
the cost of free labor as developed in
the past, any labor gained from prison
ers is entirely profit for the tax payers,
who otherwise get nothing back for
the food, shelter and attendance which
they provide prisoners so long as they
are serving jail sentences.

Fixing of the price of copper for the next tour months by the government
at 23 cents has had stabilizing effoet throughout the state, according to
reports received Jiere, except In Jerome. In that district agitators, follow
ing the lead of an outside labor disturber who .has advanced the proposal
that inasmuch as silver is now high and- copper low. the copper operators
should be compelled to base their wages upon the price of silver instead
of their chief product, are endeavoring to bring about a demand for a basin
wage of $5 the day, with copper at 13 cents and an advance of 25 cents
the day for every cent of advance in the price of copper. With copper fixed
at 23 cents, the wage, under the plan of the Jerome agitators, would bo
$7.50 the day for miners, or $1.50 more than the highest wage paid In the
state at the top of the copper metal market, above 30 cents.
Poy on Twenty-Five Cent Basis.
Copper producers have announced that they will pay the 25 cent metal
wage scale to all employes, notwithstanding the factthat producers will
receive but 23 cents in New York, whicn means that Arizona producers
get for their copper less than 22 cents, after deducting freight charges to
New York and selling commission. Decreases in the price of 6teel is tho
only effect they have so far been given the advantage of in their production
costs department. Operatives, while sustaining no reduction in pay from
the rate prevalent prior to the agreement with the government, represent
ing above $5 the Cay for all copper miners in Arizona, have the gain of
lower prices for potatoes, onions, beef and seme other necessities in all of
the camps, with promise of more to come.
Miner Appear Satisfied.
Except at Jerome, miners appear well satisfied with the situation, the
maintenance of wages mord than was expected, while business interests
have occasion for satisfaction and are encouraged to new enterprises by rea
son of the removal of doubt for the four-month period, which will include
the holiday season, as to what operatives will have to spend. They agree
that a $5 a day wage leaves abundant room for easy money conditions and
abundant trade. Reports are general of the development of much increased
buying since the announcement of copper price and wages. Many who held
v
back from purchase of all but the barest necessities pending the settlement
ot price and wage conditions, have been liberal buyers during the present
week and have given much stimulus to trade conditions in all of the
ropper producing centers.
New Work Rushed.
Vigor with which new construction worV and the insta'lation of in-proved
eiuip-iiut to the end of arper output and increased efficiency has been
picked up with the resumption of operation in the several recent strike
districts is one of the most marked features of the present period In the
Arizona copper industry.
The Warren district leads in this character of work at the present time,
with Jerome second, Ray third and Globe-Miami a strong fourth. At Cliftou
and Morenci plans are in abeyance pending the possibility of resumption
of work which will add a large amount of activity to the construction and
development division in the state, as well as make much available in new
metal resources.
New Shattuck Mill.
Ground was broken in the Warren district this week for the new mill to
be erected by the Shattuck-Arizona Cppper company for the treatment of
more than one million tons of lead carbonates running well In silver, which
the company has demonstrated and which, under a new process of treatment
that has been worked out, will return fair profit. The extent of the lead
carbonate zone in this property will undoubtedly be extended as development
is carried ou and means a large gain to its metal resources, in which cop
per predominates. The treatment process worked out by the Shattuck for
its lead carbonates applies with equal efficiency to a tonnage of double
the extent in Copper Queen mines and for the treatment of which its new
mill will be equipped, as well as for handling of the low grade copper ores
which the steam shovels will mine from Sacramento hill. Adding of the lead
carbonate work to the mill will mean ultimately a considerably greater plant j
than was contemplated in original plans. j
Queen Will Work Soon.
Breaking of ground for the Copper Queen concentrator Is probably close
ahead. The start has been delayed, pending determination upon a site for
the plant, in the selection of which water resources play an important part
Tests for a sufficient water supply have been under way and it is under
stood that recent results have been very satisfactory and will enable e".rly
beginning of construction of the plant. In association with building of the
latter there will be the establishment of a townsite convenient to the mill
and the carrying out of considerable bouse construction. The character of
building will be modern and desirable and afford housing facilities for all
employes in the concentrator division. Meantime work is crowding ahead
with fine results in the steam shovel division on Sacramento hill, where
they are rapidly getting the ground in shape for the extraction of ore.

coming down with them day by day until it has disappeared. The gigantic
work on the surface that this job represents, however, is small in compari
son with the total of operation beneath the surface in the district, where
there are hundreds of miles of drifts, raises and other openings in the solid
rock, and where the transportation service represents more steel track over
which, cars operate than there is railroad and street railway mileage in all
of Arizona. Hundreds of miles of copper wire are there to cArry the cur
rent which pulls the cars, laden with ore, to the outside to be turned into
more copper wire. ' Steel, cars and copper employed in this comparatively
small division of mine operation may give some idea of the enormously in
creased expense to which higher cost of these supplies during the last sev
eral years has meant to the mine operators.
Derm Development Interests.
In the development division in the Warren district there is largest in
terest centered at the immediate time i'i tne Denn Arizona. A million dol
lars is being s-pent on tiiis work, resumed a few months as under appro
priation of that sum. It is teing crowded slcr? with good speed and satis
factory resu'.ts. Shipments of ore are going forward to tin shelter as the
development ! carri'.d alons in the ore.
Gallows Frame Up.
The great new Campbell shaft of the Calumet & Arizona has its gallows
frame up and will be ready for the employment of miners at sinking as soon
as diversion can be made from forces more importantly employed at this
time on production. Recent manner of increase in labor in the district In
dicates that this will not be long. More miners are now coming in and
going to work than at any previous time since the strike period. Meantime
the Campbell shaft is not idle, for they are raising from the bottom level.
Wolverine development is going along well in the new ore body they
are opening on the south side. In the same neighborhood several leasers
are making excellent progress. Leasing in the district is coming much stron
ger, promising to come into more prominence than ever before, there being
additional incentive in the prices for silver and lead. Among organizations
with promising lead silver ground opened which expect to get into action at
an early' date is the Louisiana Arizona, In the Tombstone canyon country.
They are now awaiting equipment which has been ordered.
Give and Take.
There is no disposition in copper circles to quarrel with the government
over the 23-cent copper price which has been fixed to all comers for a
period of four months. This figure will permit of every good profits to th
low cost producers, and should not stifle high cost output
To be sure, costs of production have risen at an extraordinary pace during
the jast 12 months. The stockholder has also to bear in mind that his
company must pay heavy tribute from net earnings as its proportion of the
war tax levy.
In the table below a list of 36 copper producers is presented, the amount
of their production in 1916 and their reported costs per pound. These costs
are made up in a variety of ways. Some of the companies make an allow
ance for plant depreciation, others do not. Practically all of them have
credited against their copper costs all revenues received from gold and sil
ver and interest and dividend on treasury securities of various kinds.
The table is interesting, however, as showing the companies which will
reap the largest benefit based upon the government's price of 23 4 cents for
copper, bearing in mind, of course, that the companies making the largest
profits must pay the heaviest war tax. The table follows:

I want to Impress upon each dep

for extreme self-control, cool, calm
judgment and patience. Avoid all
display of weapons. Remember,
you are deputized for protection of
self and property and the mainten
ance of peace. You are subject to
my call, a call which will be made
when necessary.
Let no act of yours tend to de
feat the object for which you were
deputized, namely the preservation
of peace. I hold each man respon
sible for any illegal act or excess of
lis authority and this applies to ev
iry man in this district.

NOTRE DAME DU CAMOUFLAGE.
Concealed behind complete disguise,
Be-powdered to her very eyes,
Her naturally tinted nose
Is whitened like the Alpine snows.
Cheeks that should wear a fleeting
flush
Are daubed Into a fleeting blush.
Eyebrows, bereft of normal shades.
She pencils black as ace of spades,
Her hair, the crowning gift of God,
Is touched to match the goldenrod.
Outwitting Nature with her art.
She so transforms her facial chart.
We decorate her with this badge
"Our Lady of the Camouflage."

HOY-JACKSON.
Miss Catherine Hoy, of this city,
and Mr. Lawrence Jackson, of Tomb
stone, were married at seven o'clock
Thursday evening in the beautifully
decorated home of the bride's mother,
Mrs. A. T. Hoy, on Castle Hill A
profusion of chrysanthemums, which
were sent from Tucson by Miss Hoy's
sorority sisters, added a pleasing
touch to the green and white of the
other floral decorations. Otily im-
mediate relatives of the young cou
pie and a few close friends witnessed
the ceremony which was performed
by Rev. John E. Frye. Mrs. Frank
Salmon played the wedding march.
The bride, who wore the white satin
gown and the bridal veil in which
her mother was married, carried a
bouquet of white carnations and ferns.
Mrs. A. T. Hoy was matron of honor
and Theodore Hoy, brother of tho
bride, was groomsman.
The out-of-town guests were Miss
Dorothy Jackson, sister of the bride
groom and a student in the state uni
versity, and J. L. Hastings, a mining
engineer of Tombstone.
The br'de graduated in the class
of 1916 at the state university with
high honors. She is a charter mem
ber of the Beta Delta Chapter of
Kappa Alpha Theta fraternity, and
popular with her classmates and the
members of the faculty. The young
couple left after the ceremony on the
Golden State Limited for the coast,
where they will spend their honey-
moon. While on their trip they will
visit the parents of the bridegroom ;
at Santa Monica. They will remain
in California until the Christmas hol -
idays.

Mrs. Erma Hanscom and son have
lert on an overland trip through Ar-
ter collections. The plums this yeari
are, for the most part, long and lean.
We find now and again a high waisted
row, trim and rather severe. We
draw out, from the fartherest corners,
plums in the shape of tunics and
cape-cloaks of rare comeliness. We
find fur trimmed frocks of cachemire
d'Inde, of velours de lain, all the
new velvety jerseys, and all the va
rieties of bure. We find velvets of
silk and cotton, mousseline de sole
embroidered with metal thread, plush
and panne velvet. We see skunk,
leopard, rabbit fox, fisher, otter and
marmot. We are shown girdles of
taupe, waist coats of ermine and
muffs of duvetyn and velvet trimmed
with fur of various kinds.
And when we have seen It all, we
realize once more that in order to
wear the frocks of 1917 we must be
very thin. And, thin, doubtless, we
shall be. War rations are admirably
adapted to present fashions. Our
frocks will do no more than drip
from our shoulders before many weeks
are past. We shall be mere shadows
in chic attire but we shall be smart!
Some of the new skirts measure
zona and California. The son will
enter a boarding school in the latter
state, after which Mrs. Hanscon will
return to Tucson to make her future
home.

HARD-TIMES DANCE.
Elks may celebrate hard times with
"hard-times" dances but! the name
' belies the fact. The dance held at

dressed in shabby clothes, but it was
anything but that, in reality. In fact
the dance was a symbol of good times
in every sense of the word and the
hundred couples proved the oft-stated
truism that the Elks make excellent
hosts at most any kind of entertain-
ment.

lordly more than a metre at the hem.
One of these is simply a piece of
straight tissue folded about the fig
ure with the edges overlapping for
several inches in the back; the "play"
thus privided supplies the width need
ed for walking. Another in scantily
pleated at intervals from a shallow
yoke. Another is adorned with two
panels which are tucked three times
crosswise and fall, one over each hip,
almost to the skirtedge, where they
are weighted with fur bands. The
skirt of a one piece frock is attached
to the top section at the hip, and the
top thus forms a shallow yoke below
the narrow belt The belt is rather
closely drawn about the figure and
the tesulting silhouette is very smart.
Here and there we see a straight
leather belt rather tightly adjusted
at the normal waist line. This belt
may be an inch or two inches in width
and is made of black or tan varnished
leather. A frock of Scotch plaid In
dark colors is thus belted with black
while a frock of gray design is oddly
belted and bound with beige leather.
A tendency to tighten the silhou-
ette at the waist is observed in cer-
tain quarters, but the tight belt will
surely not be featured extensively at
the openings. However, since we look
in vain for a real change in silhou
ette, it is likely that at the openings
we shall see many variations of the
expected straight silhouette.
Any one who has ever followed the
vagaries of French coats will want.
this year, to go on following. But be
fore starting, there is no law against
knowing where one Is going. Coats
are running to great lengths three
quarters or longer; they are often full,
even slightly circular, but they do
their best to fall straight, sometimes
from the shoulder without a belt,
sometimes belted only in front, some
times belted only behind. It is even
muttered that some of the tailored
coats are to have Japanese bows be
hind. But we don't see how Paris
is going to get away with that. How
ever, Paris has surprised us before,
and we like to be surprised, we frank
ly confess.
Silk embroidery decorates a num
ber of the dressy suit models. The
suit is developed in blue velour, the
skirt is quite full and short enough
to afford a glimpse of the spats. The
coat is an attractive belted affair with
novel'y pockets. Silk embroidery in
self-color affords attractive and ap
propriate trimming. The color is of
nuiskrat fur. A large, dressy sailor
completes the outfit.
An ideal dance frock for autumn
wear is in rose tulle and trimmed with
costly silver metal lace. Simplicity
is the keynote for the lines are
straight, except for the slight sugges
tion of the barrel line on the sides.
This is obtained by the arrangement
of the lace. The double tunic effect
falls over a foundation skirt of rose
satin. Of particular interest is the
bodice with "V" neck and elbow
length sleeves. For the young girl
there is nothing so becoming and ap
propriate as the soft tulle sleeves.
It is safe to predict that fur will
prove the predominant item in the
way of trimming this fall. Judging
from the new models shown it would
seem to indicate that this form of
trimming is to be the thing. The coat
in French blue broadcloth fashioned
on straight lines, the only break be
ing in the line formed by the pouch
pockets. A broad belt of self-material
is held in place by two large fur
buttons. The deep roll collar and
cuffs are of seal. Button boots and
a large ribbon trimmed velvet hat
complete the outfit.
The Applique so noticeable on au
tumn hats has extended its sphere of
Influence. The black design is em
broidered with ivory and rose silk to
gold tulle sleeves and a tunic of gold
tissue lined with red tissue. A pet
ticoat of rose tulle with Ivory beads.
The cape-coat model which origin
ated last year seems destined to con
tinued favor in this winter of super
latively warm costumes. A sumptu
ous development of a model in black
velvet, liberally trimmed with gray
rabbit which again finds favor with
the Parisienne. v
It would seem a fixed persuasion
of a designer that sashes end at the
sides. The severity of a red satin
evening frock is softened by silver
embroidered silver tulle, but nothing
interferes with the new and unex
pected severity of the sleeves. 1
To be black and white in Paris Is
still a certain means to the end of
being . smart. Black chantilly and
white satin are the materials of a
model for evening wear and a band of
kolinsky divides the one from the oth
er by a narrow line.
Among the few fashions which can
even momentarily distract the design
er"s attention from Jersey cloth is
satin, particularly satin in the dark
colors and an afternoon frock of mar-
ron satin gains a touch of Oriental
ism from cashmere embroidery in red
black and beige.
' Aubusson is a trimming material
made in several widths and colors.
The high tam-o'shanter crown of an
afternoon hat of brown velvet is made
in sections united by brown velvet
cords and around it is a band of biege
grosgrain ribbon which forms a bow
at the back. On the brim is a band
of beige colored goose feathers with
strands of beige ostrich springing
from it. With this hat are worn a
scarf and muff of silver fox. The
scarf is made of the whole animal
and unlined. The muff is small and
'round.
V. W. CA. Notes
Mrs C. S. Thompson, president of
the board of directors of the local
association, returned this week from
Long Beach, where she has been
spending the summer. She will be
most heartily welcomed at her post,
as her enthusiasm and keen Insight
into association work has been great
ly missed.
Thursday evening, October 4, the
annual reception for the teachers of
the city will be held. This large group
of young people should be better
known among the towns-folk, and the
public is most cordially invited to
come and meet them at this time.
Some of them come fresh from col
lege and are daily giving their best
to the children of the community.
Miss Hazelle Rowe. of the High
school, and Misses Fiers, Gallagher
and Fitzgerald have identified them
selves with the association.
Miss Bernice Vivian McCurdy, of
-Pasadena, Cal., who arrives this morn
ing, completes the secretarial force
for this year. She will do girls' and
extension work. A class in English
for Mexican young women will be one
of the first things done. Miss Mc
Curdy majored in Spanish In her col
lege work and is well qualified for
this phase of the work.
This afternoon at 5 o'clock there
will be a social sing. New song books
have just been received which con
tain some of the newer hymns of ser
vice as well as those that never grow
old. Miss McCall will lead the music
and tea will be served after the sing.
The Wednesday afternoon "At
Home," which has been a time of
acquaintance for new women in the
city, has a new purpose for their ac
tivity. Mrs. Frantzen. who is secur
ing clothing for the French women
and children, spoke last Wednesday
of their terrible need, and from now
on this group of women will devote
their energy to this.
A military class will be started
soon, the course to consist of six les
sons. Mrs. C. S. Wilson is the In
structor. Registrations will be re
ceived at the office at any time.
"Knitting socks for soldiers" has
penetrated the walls of the Y. W. C.
A. and each Monday evening a group
of young women struggle to conquer
and master the shiny steel needles.
Always room for more and teachers
at hand.
The employment bureai of the Y.
W. C. A. is striving hard to find and
meet the needs of the community.
Calls for domestic help have come re
peatedly to our office that we could
not supply, so letters have been writ
ten to agencies in nearby places in
order to devise some cooperative
plan. The results from some of these
replies are summarized as follows
El Paso informs that Mexicans could
possibly be secured if transportation
was forwarded. Los Angeles Y. W.
C. A. has 400 applications which can
not be filled, owing to the lack of
girls. Phoenix at present could not
furnish help of any kind, 'end they
also have many applications for help
on file. Douglas is struggling witn
the same problems. There is a will
ingness shown in all the letters to co
operate in every possible way.
During this week the business men
will be visited by representatives of
our bureau to ascertain what the
needs, present and probable, are and
how the Y. W. C. A. may best servo
them.
Mrs. A. W. Colton, one of the newly
elected secretaries, is in charge of
this work and calls should be made
direct to her.

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

bands from par to the new high pre
mium of 100.30, at which a few bonds
sold for cash. The general market
was irregular, total sales, par value,
aggregating $2,745,000.
United States bonds, old Issues,
were unchanged on call during the
week. The weekly bank statement
presented no features of especial in
terest, the actual of local institutions
showing an expansion of $46,000,000
in loans and a contraction of about
$5,750,000 in excess reserves.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 29. Unexpected
cool weather with frost indications for
tonight encouraged corn buyers today.
Largely as a result prices at the close
although unsettled were 34 to 1 to
1 net higher at 1.18 to 1.18 for
December and 1.14 to 1,14 for
May.
Oats finished unchanged to higher,
and provisions 12c declines to a rise
of 7c.
Investors who appeared to have
been giving considerable attention to
the feeding value of corn, compared
with prices for livestock, took prompt
notice of the chance that the prevail
ing wave of lower temperature might
bright about eleventh-hour damage to
the corn crop. The country sold al
most no corn; offerings everywhere
were lighL Oats hardened in response
to continued demand from export in
terests. Owing to the recent sharp advances,
provisions encountered a decided lull.

NEW YORK. Sept 28. The mar
ket had a better tone in today's short
session and prices were advanced in
all directions.
While the element seemed bearish
ly inclined and may make a little
more progress on the selling side, still
signs are not lacking of a keen de
sire on the part of prominent financial
interests to endeavor to stabilize
things pending the flotation of the
government loan. Accordingly we an
ticipate that the market will meet a
rather fair sort of support on down

The above remarkable statement

"For twenty years," Mrs. Spears
continued, "I suffered with a bad form

called it gall stones. I don't know

misery would begin in my back
and then work up Into my chest

to death. Many a night I have stayed
awake and cried with pain and misery
and I have even hobbled out of bed
to sit on the doorstep, trying to get re

the mornings. I couldn't walk.
"I had no strength at all and fre

get up for it. My husband spent a
small fortune trying to get me well
but nothing helped me, t'o it was de

I was so despondent that I felt I
wouldn't live through it and refused to
allow it.

the latest arrivals to come to us from the
