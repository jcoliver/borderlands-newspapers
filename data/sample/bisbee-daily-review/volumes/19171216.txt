Mud and Christmas
MAN
Being An Interview With An Invalided Veteran of the Great War,
Now Recruiting Officer In Bisbee, Who Complained More of Mud In
England Than of Death In France.
"Tell met Christmas story, ser -
t eant." urged the newspaper man of.
Sergeant Blinman of the Canadian
army, who Is in Bisbee at this time
seeking British suhlects as recruits
for the British forces. "We simply
have to have one for our Christmas is -

The sergeant, trim built sandy com
plexioned, blue eyed, modest and a
hardened veteran of the great war.
smiled. "I don't kmw any Christmas
stories," he said.
"Where did yon spend last Christ
mas?" asked the newspaper man.
"la the hospital.'' was tbe laconic
reply, spoken with a smile.
"And the Christmas before?"
"sniping Germans." And Sergeant
Blinman smiled again.
"And the Christmas before that?"
"In the trenches at the training
camp in Salisbury Plain. England:
that was the worst of alt" And this
time tbe sergeant did not smile.
"Why the worst?"
"Mud." was the simple, brief, but
expressive reply.
Here was a man who had spent the
three preceding Christmas days in
camp, field and hospital and held the
English mud to be worse than tne
Boches or the surgeon's knife or tbe
bed tf pain. And yet he did not
know any Christmas stories. Te gods!
The newspaper man pet certain
adroit and subtle and leading ques
tions and pretty soon the sergeant
vanned up a little and began to talk,
laughing like .a boy when he spoke
of tbe stern and terrible drama in
which he had played a part for nearly
three years.
Trained at Salisbury
He trained at Salisbury Plain with
the first of the Canadian contingents;
was In the first battle of Tprcs when
the English held the Germans with
rifles and courage alone and were
gassed for the first time; was in the
great Somme offensive and carried a
German bullet tout of that place of
death in his body; was in the Messines:
Kidge battle. ,
"We had a good Christmas dinner )
at the Salisbury Plains camp." said ;
the sergeant reflectively, "bat the
bloody mud spoiled the day. Tbe Eng- J
Ueh folka vere mighty nice to us all t
the time we were over there. No. 1 1
don't remember anything particular !
about that Christmas except the mud j
and the big dinner.
Hunting Sniper on Xmas S
"The next Christmas I was in Kent-1
mel. a little town in Belgium where we !
had jiut taken some trenches from :
Fritz and were consolidating them
right up under his irase. I remember
we had beans and bacon for breakfast
that day and beef stew for dinner. We
dug trenches all morning and hunted
German snipers all afternoon. We
didn't get our Christmas dinner until i

a pretty tough present from the Hun. '
Now. if it had gone on through I might!
have been all right." I
Sergeant Blinman was a member of
the 29th battalion or a Canadian regl-'
ment known as "Tobin's Tigers.-!
They went into the war 1100 strong!
and now tbe sergeant is one xf tbe 70;
men of the original number left'
alive. ;
Lively on the 5omm
"Yes, we had a pretty lively time 'on
tbe Somme." admitted tbe sergeant
when pressed closely. "The Dutch
fought there mighty hard at first be
fore we had pounded tbe fight out of
them. We had to fight a day ror a
fojt of ground there in the begin
ning. Our regiment came down there
from the north and they put -as right
to work. We took every trench we
set ont to. and we held them. too. it
was easy com oared to that first scrap
at Tpres. Why. we had no artillery
there at all to speak of. and then they
gassed ns there tor the first rime. Our j
boys were piled np so hieh it was I
hard to climb over them. We had to j STOCKHOLM. Elaborate plans tor,

he muttered with a set glare as the
memorv of this horror came before
him. "They called ns 'The Tigers'
over there. Why not? They had cru-
1 cified our wounded comrades. TTie
! Prussians did this. They are the
worst of the lot. The Saxon a ant! the
j RUlnelanders and Bavarians are iAt
: so bad. Why. once, when we were
facing a Saxon regiment onlr 30 or
1 yards away across the shel. holes
and tbe barbed wire, they caned
out to us one evening and said. "The
Fourth Prussian guards are coming to
relieve us tomorrow; give ihem hell.'
We did.
Fighting Fools
"There were srme wonderful men
among those British officers on the
Somme. We Canadians were pretty
proud of our officers and our regi
ments, but the finest thing I saw on
tbe Somme was the colonel of the Mid
dlesex regiment charging across No
Man's Land at the head tf his men
and dribbling a football before him.
Fact! And he kicked it right into the
Hun trenches and followed after and
got the balL Those Middlesexers are
devils. And the Scotch! Say, they!
are fighters. They are bard! They
never quit: never give way;
never lose. Tou can't kill them. A
Scotchman will march right on into a

kill three Boches before be keeis over.
And the Irish. I want R te'l you that

that the Huns will never forget. They
took Gulllemont, I think it was. with (
the bayonet and they mado the Prus-i
sians look like children in ma:
melee, and then after fighting all day
against the Dutch they fought with
each other in camp that night. They
are fighting fools.
j Returns With Gun
I braTest single piece of work 1
: saw in the Somme campaign was by a
j tftjy of my own battalion. He was my
corporal. We had taken an advanced
trench and were being raked by a ma
chine gun in a pillbox a little ways off.
and this corporal wanted me to msn ;
the gun. But 1 wouldn't do it. i w vs I
in charge of that detachment and I did
not want to get raked over the coals!
foT losing men. You have f3 account
for every man you have, yon hot.
Bat the corporal wanted that gun and
he was Ware because it had raked our
line and taken heavy toll. So he
chTT.bed over tbe top and disappeared
in the direction of the pilbox. I
never expected to see him again, but
pretty soon he came back carrying
that gun with him. I asked him how
he took it and he merely paid there
were three Germans working it and
that he bad surprised them and shot
one and bayoneted tbe other two.
"The government sent that can
back to the boy's home town in Van
couver, as a trophy, and it is there
now.

hefj of the great war. laughed again
like a boy and walked am ay with
erect carriage and jaunty step, in
spite of the fact that he is carrying
a fair sized chunk of German lead in

If he stays in Bisbee he will have

NEUTRALS SHOULD BE
DRAFTED SWEDISH '
NEWSPAPERS CLAIM
CHRISTIAMA. Newspapers find
little or no ground for criticism in the
proposal originating in the last
session of the American congress that
alien neutrals living in the United
States should be subject to draft in
the American army. On the contrary,
tbe papers here find it quite natural
that the I'nited States should call ev
ery available able-bodied man of the
neutral nations into the ranks, and say
it would not be sensible for the Amer
ican government to permit naturalized
foreigners to remain in that country
enjoying its privileges while naUve
Americans are sent t'j the front to
fight in their defense.

Out of the mist comes the bugle call rouse ye up from your dreaming;
Leap to the drum's roll, one and all up where the heights are glecming;
Now is the moment to do and dare peasant or prince or rover
On to the walls, ye stalwarts there on to the walls and over.
What care ye if the path is steep! What if the Maxims rattle?
There's never a time to wait or weep in the whirl of the gory battle;
There's never a time for a one to quail or dream of life in the clover;
On to the walls through the morning pale on to the walls and over.
Grimly the black-mouthed cannon stand grimly the guns are aiming.
One more rush and it's hand-to-hand killing and cutting and maiming;
Such is life "till the tale is done, monarch or pr iest or drover
On to the walls through the noonday sun on to the walls and over! -
Deep the trenches, but now the flash on through the shrapnel's raining;
On and up in a mad, wild dash quick for the day is waning;
Up where the red glare shows the way out from the fields of clover
On to the walls through the twilight gray on to the walls and over!
Thinner and thinner the long line grows; think of this on the morrow;
Death alone is tho red, red rose life but a thorn of sorrow;
Look ye neither to left or right peasant or prince or drover
On to the walls through the depths of night on to the walls and over.
On, wher; the mangled clog the way; on, where the dead are lying;
There's never a time in the gory fray to stop for the merely dying;
On to the line 'till our final hosts sleep in the crimson clover:
On to the walls, though we char re with ghosts on to the walls and ov.

DID NOT KNOW OF
GREAT WORLD WAR
BUTTE. Mont.. Dec. S Joseph
Sandle has just learned that the
world is at war. For four years, while
the most momentous events In history
have been transpiring, he has been
out of touch with civilization, on a
prospecting expedition In the Artie.
He has just returned, and stopped
here enroute to his former home in
Arizona. A gold strike In Alaska
which lie was forced to abandon 20
years ago on account of failing health
has proven of little value, he said.
Saiulle said he left Seattle in the
spring of 1913. secured ssuplies anil
ammunition enough to last him about
to years, and made his way to his
old shack In the interior which he had
left in 1S97.
"Everything was just as I had left

it." he said. "Not a thing had been
disturbed. Even the same grease was
still in the frying pan in which I had
cooked my last breakfast there in
1S97. and I was surprised to find a
liberal quantity of supplies on hand,
still in a good state of preservation."
He spent the summer months in kill
and preserving a supply of game for
the winter, he said, and thus he spent
live winters and four summers there,
j He made four trips south and traded
j gold and furs to the Indians for more
l supplies. He met a band of white
men in 1913, but they were going "out"
I and knew less than he did about the
j outside world.
"When I left for the north, the
1 papers were discussing world wide
i peace." he said. "It did not seem
possible that I would ever aeain hear
of a war of any importance. I learn
' ed of the war in Seattle a week ao."
He has purchared quantity of
: literature on the war and is busy
j porln over back files of newspapers,
endeavoring to inform himself.

clared Ben. the star mechanician of a
certain Bisbee garage, to tiie news

was walling to have some energy in

balky and sullen flivver.
"Cut loose," urped the newspa-'

"Well, it was this way." said Ben.
with a sorrowful sih that came yrom
deep down in his "innards." "A few

ALL TO ANSWER
INJEW DRAFT
Regulations Went Into Force
December Fifteenth. Every
Man of Selective Age Must
Respond. -
The regulations t.-jvernlng the new
elective draft system went Into eflect
on December IS. The queslionaires
were mailed about December ti. and
every man in Blsbee between tbe ages
of 21 and 31. whether he has been
called or not by the first drait, wii;
receive one of the documents, which
are in booklet form and contain 16
pages.
These questionaires must be filled
out and returned to the local exemp
tion board, at which the man re
ceiving it is registered, within seven
days from the date stamped on the
face of the booklet. Failure to com
ply with this order, which is strictly;
mandatory, is punishable by fine or
imprisonment. j
The que8tionaire provides a series j
of questions for men who, by reas&n
of their personal qualifications, or
lack of qualifications, physical, men
tal, moral, industrial or otherwise,
will fall into one of the five classes
provided for all registrants. ,
It must be understood by all regis
istered men that all previous exemp
tions granted by either the local or
district exemption boards are re
voked and every man stands in the
position of being called for service in
the order in which his qualifications
fit him. Many men -who were ex
empted by the - local and district
boards under the first draft, will
by reason of the aew regulations,
fall naturally intoi, the first class and
will be subject to immediate call to
service, and other men. who would
naturally have been selected by the
old system. had -their numbers
been called, will, under the new
rules, fall into the second or pos
sibly the third class...
Only men falling into the first class
will be physically examined at this
time. Men falling into other classes,
except class five, will' be called for
physical examination, only wnen the
men in the class ahead of them are
all called tor service.
The first step for the registrant tt
take upon receipt ' of his question
aire is to call en' the legal advisory
committee and sect. re, free of charge,
assistance in the proper filling out of
the blank forms in the quetionaire.
which relate specifically to his case.
This step must not be put off. Men
should K-i immediately to this board,
and if a man's case cannot be at
tended to on the spot, the board will
fix a day and hour on which to take
up the matter. Thia is vitally impor
tant and cannot be . too strongly em
phasized. Another point .made clear is
this: Every man .y should answer
every question in fall and truthful
ly, for the answers are under oath
and a false statement may Operate
to deprive the registrant ' of his full
rights under the rules. When the
questionaire is . complete, it must be
promptly returned to the local
'board, and when the board finally '
i decides in to what class the res-is-'
tram falls, his number will be posted
in a conspicuous place at the board s
headquarters.
The boards are under no obligation
to nottfiy the reels; rant personally as
to hat class he ha? been asiKncd. H
is his duty to call ct the ofrioe of the
board and examine the numbers placed
in the different classes. If hs num
ber appears in class No. 1. he must
hold himself in readiness to answer
any call affecting his class. Pt-ini;
classified in class No. 2. or any sub
sequent class, will operate as a tem
porary exemption from service, ex
cepting class Vj. 5. which is eQuivalon:
to a permanent discharge front military
service, but not from other sotvice of
a semi-military nature, to which the
government may later call those in
that class.

country last year for randy.
We have learned to talk and
think in billions. But one
cent can buy enough iodine
to dii:i'Vct a wound and
the disinfection of that
wound mav save a human
life.
And, after experience with
the wounded, there comes
the time when one sees in .he
horror of the shattered fiesh.
the leauty of the spirit.
IT is a strange holiday for
us Americans, with our
new excitements and our new
emotions; cur new soldiers
in cantonments or foreign
trenches, and our new sailors
in mined seas; reports of
our first dead, and our letters
from the front; our fears and
our elations; and the occas
ional flash of vision of hun
dreds of thousands of boys
and men in khaki in miles
uion miles of army barracks.
Many of them, too, are
aching with new tenderness.
It is the time of times, in
our new puzzlement' and
need, to sing the Christmas
carols of glad prophecy. The
city chimes and village or
gans, singers going from
door to door, will chime and
peal and carol as they never
have before, the Christmas
message of good tidings and
great joy which shall he t;
all people.
We owe it to our men to
sing it with full hearts, so
that the spirit of it will reach
their battleships and their
camps. They must never
forget the happiness of this
Christmas, the, last, doubt
less, before they go across to
offer all they have.
The Red Cross is trying,
and e.ects to send every
man in training a Christmas
parcel of Christmassy things
as a symbol to show him how
much we care, and the things
we cannot say in words. The
boys in their barracks will be
celebrating, swapping pres-'
cnts, joking and singing,
adding a Christmas song to
the familiar round of swing
ing choruses. But before an
other Christmas perhaps a
million more young soldiers
will have followed them over
seas. SOME of them, until the
day the' put on the uni
form, knew only school fun
and home love. Their stock
ings were darned, their favor
ite things to eat were cooked,
every minute of their holi
days planned, their young
hopes regarded with yearn
ing eagerness by their fam
ilies. Some of them were
born seemingly to be knock
ed around, and have the hard
and lonely end of things.
Both are going abroad to
gether now, serving the col
ors, tlef ending our lives with
the offer of their own.
There will be a day when
one of these boys will be hurt.
Suddenly his strong young
body will be quite helpless.
He will be far away in a dif-

just a thimbleful of the day's
harvest of wounded only two or

sion seems so long it seems sc un
endingly long. The faces are like
the facrs of our men at home
here like our father here like the
man who lives across the street
and here slender boy whose eyes
we think we cannot stand to see.
It is all so quiet as the stretchers
file by. The French officer of high
rank with many medals, the peas

the garbage, the black man from
Africa who docs not know why he

grievously hurt.
Perhaps it is the presrncv of God
there here so many men arc close
to death thai makes the old scales
drop from our eyes. For among
these mutilated that is what hap
pens to us the old values, the old
conventions drop away forever.
Each crushed or broken body be
comes so infinitely precious, as we
see it dominated by spirit. Tliis
black man, this blind boy have
lifted us up. With a new sense we
know that the things which sre
seen are temporal, but ths things
which are not seen are eternal.
And lifting up our eyes from the
stretchers, we see the Red Cross.
We see it on the arm of the sur
geon, giving his skill. On the arm
of. the nurse, iriving her youth. On
the insignia of the ambulance men,
civing their careers. We knew that
it was painted an the cases carry
ing 'these surgical supplies and
these healing drugs. We know
that it will wave above the hospita
to which these men are goin to
have their chance of life.
From this minute the Red Cross
becomes a part of o. and we be
come part of the Red Cross.
WHILE we do our Christmas
shopping this year, while
we live these days of new

that are like draughts of the richest
wine of life now, before we suffer,
Red Crosses will setm to be every

There is a tnothei who works in
her home and her church for the
Red Cross who said that the high
fst points of her life, and her deep
est happiness were the times her
son, a new young second lieutenant
home on furlough, talked with her
as they washed the dishes together
at the kitchen sink.
How it is these humble things,
and not the dramatic ones, that
bind us together and thrill as now!
How to those whom the war has
touched, people are not so much
Generals or Colonels, or Presidents
or servants or ice-men or tailors or
scrubwomen or Kings, as fellow-haman-beings;
and how the hope of
carrying on what thousands of
radiant youths have 'died and are
to die for, centers upon the little
children.
THIS is thinking in Red Cross
ways. For the ideal of the
Red Cross Treaty uigned in
Geneva by the delegates of nations,
is merely this: that every, suffering
human being in war, whether be
longing to friend or enemy, shall be
sacred to the Red Cross. Yet the
symbol of that treaty is so gTeat,
that it is the meeting-ground of the
most conflicting race, and the most
conflicting creeds ; of men and wom
en and children: of black and white
and yellow and red ; of rich and
jhw; of Jew and Gentile; of Catho
lic and Protestant; of Buddhist and
Gonfucian; of artist andartisan;
of materialist and idealist; of sol
dier and civilian; of general and,
private; of Foe atd Adversary
die Red Cross!
So we put candles in our win
dows this Christmas Eve, that the
flickering point of light shining
through the Red Cross on the window-pane
may say to the way
farer and the soldier and the
sailor, things too great for words.
They will understand. For in this
overwhelming trouble we have be
r;n to be simple of heart together.
The poor and the rich have begun
to understand the other sacri
fices. nd so we can sing Christmas
c.wol and not le !iypocrj:es; for

LAEOR CONSCRIPTION
MAY BE NECESSARY,
SECTY. WILSON SAYS
WASHINGTON. Conscription of Ta
bor, Secretary Wilson told congress in
his annual report today, is not likely
to be necessary for the winning of the
war. but be suggest that should it be
came necessary for tne government to
conscript labor, it should at the same
time conscript the industries on which
they are engaged.
"Almost insvpe-rabl obstacles
arise." says the secretary of labor,
"when lattr dispute occur under cir
cumstance in which employers permit
organization by their workmen only
on pain of dismissal. Bine In such
cases the workmen have no respon
sible business representatives, only
one party to controversies can be
conveniently or satisfactorily beard.
Such cases, also, the workers, being
prevented by their employers from or
ganizing on a business basis, stand to
fall away from the pacifying influ
ences of conservative, cons tractive
and responsible labor organizations
and to come under that of irresponsi
ble revolutionists. As most labor law-i
leseness is traceable to this cause, re-:
sptmsibUity for it can not be wholly .

fair and impracticable. They are also
widely regarded, and not without rea
son, as unpatriotic. It Is enough to
say of them here that in t he view of
this department public sentiment can
not be expected Rj tolerate conscrip

sponsible representatives of disputing
employers are willing to negotiate con
siderately with representatives of con
servative labor organizations which
represent their disputing employes In
the spirit in which they would nego
tiate with business competitors, labor
disputes can be settled speedily, effee-j
tively, and without friction, through
the mediation of service of the depart
ment of labor. By simple and fair sys
tems of collective bargaining between
the government, labor Organizations,
and business organizations all labor
disputes prejudicial to an effective
prosecution of the war can be prompt
ly eliminated from war problems. Not
only can this be done, but it can be
done to the satisfaction of all con
cerned and in harmtmy with every pat
riotic purpose.
"Our greatest need to the spirit of
self-sacrifice for the common good
a sacrifice of our pride, sacrifice of our
prejudices, sacrifice of our suspic
ions against each other, sacrifice of
our material comforts, sacrifice t our
lives, if need be to carry on unim
paired the democratic institutions
handed down to us by our fathers.'
The report makes an announcement
on the much discussed pay and privi
leges being Uowed to the interned
German civilians in the camps con
trolled by the departmen of labor.
"It was agreed by the department to
remunerate those of the interned
aliens who should perform labor of any
kind In connection with the construc
tion or management of the internment
camp at the rate of f 20 a month ; those
who served in the capacity of foremen,
etc to receive $25 a month. The in
terned officers, hbwever, have been
allowed to receive from any source
only 20 a month and the seamen $5
a month, receipts in excess of these
amounts being placed in the postal
savings bank to the credit of the in
terested parties, or otherwise dispos-
ed of as desired.

The department's work in mediating
in wage disputes, enormously increas
ed by war activities, has effected a
million men and has been eminently
successful.
"The number of labor disputes call

Conditions After
the World's War
AMSTERDAM. (Correspondence of
of the Associated Press.) The United
States assumes an astonishing promi
nence in all German discussions of in
dustrial and economic conditions after
the war. Seldom, if ever, before in
European history has an outside power
been so unanimously conceded a place
as a determining factor in European
affairs. Thus, an article by Professor
Frftnz Eulenburg in the Review Welt
handel. although dealing solely with
probable commercial conditions in
Germany after the war, finds them
largely bound up with the possibilities
of American workers, and the article
to filled with references to the United
States and its commercial future as
vitally threatening Germany .
Professor Eulenburg believes t&at
the privations and hardships which the
German people have endured and the
discipline which they have learned,
have created In them a capacity for
economy and hard work which will be
their greatest asset in the rebuilding
of Germany after the war, and will be
their greatest advantage over "lets
well-disciplined pevples" like the Eng
lish and the American. Discipline and
rigid economy, he declares, will be the
chief requisites in the great world task
of restoring prices to normal levels.
"One of the greatest problems after
the war will be that of prices." be
says. "For Germany It will be a ques
tion of life and death that prices shall
tall asain from the dizzy height which
they have now attained."

WILL OF SUBJECTS
BERNE, Switzerland. vCorrespond
ence of the Associated Press) De
tails, hitherto unpublished, concern
ing the abdication i-f King Constantine
are Contained in on interview publish
ed by the Berner InteiligenzOla.t. with
an unnamed Greek persouage. cow res
ident in Switzerland.
This prominent Greek relates that
he was with the then Premier Zaimia,
when the French senator, Charles C.
A. Jonnart submitted an ultimatum
wi.h the demand that he be presented
to the king immediately. Zairuts slow
ly read through the document, but de
clared that he would not venture to
show It to the king. The speaker, how
ever, urged its presentation and both
men thereupon sought an audience
with the king.
"Something serious?" asked King
CoKstantine as soon as be saw tbe ex
pression on the premier's face.
"Very serious, majesty," replied Zal
mia. Give it to me." demande-i the king,
pointing to the document in t!ie pre
mier's hand.
Tbe king then began to read the
document aloud, hesitating when he
came to the word "abdicat.on" but
only for a moment. Then he continu
ed reading quietly, clearly until the
end. After a moment's hesitation he
made up his mind.
' I shall do it," he declared, despite
the premier's suggestion that a meet
ing of tbe crown council should be
summoned first. The king finally
agreed to summon the council, but an
nounced that he had already decided
that it would be best for Greece It he
relinquish the crown. The council
strongly opposed the proposed action,
but the king could not be moved from
his determination to abdicate, even
though, according to ye statesmen,
there was a strong mapority in Greece
against his leaving.

death by starvation.
"This remnant of the Arnen:an peo
ple In Asia Minor." says the statement
of these neutrals, "Is a starving, beg
ging people, consisting In the main of
old men. and women and children.
The number of children who, separated
from their relative, lie along the car
avan routes or w ander a'Vut the towns
like dogs, runs into tens of thousands.
It is scarcely credible that in the
twentieth century the extermination
of almost an em ire people under such
terrible circumstances was possible.
But entirely trustworthy evidence of
neutral consular officials, of German
and Swedish missnariee and teach
ers, is available and ruts the matter
beyond all doubt." THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SUNDAY MORNING, DECEMBER 16, 1917.

Interesting Light on Silver Costs is Provided by Tonopah
Figures That District "Best Equipped In 'Southwest for
Mining the White Metal Arizona Cannot Compete With
it In Costs What the Latter Have Recently Been.
Data hastily gathered indicates that price fixation on silver will directly
affect several hundred metal producers In Arizona and probacy 5.000 work
men. Practically every small producer of ore In Arizona depends to soma
extent open toe silver contents of Us output to carry a considerable part oi
his costs of mining and ore treatment.
The- large number or small shippers affected by silver price fixation are
also in most part vitally Interested in price fixed for copper. The number
of small producers engaged In the production and shipping of straight silver
ores or silver lead ores, fc distinctly a minority. Nearly all place more
or less dependence in copper contents to pull them through. With reduction
in price of either silver or copper by the government, most of them will
have to cease shipping; with reduction in the price of both metals, practically
all of them will be pat out of business.
In the Chirfcahua. Hcachoca, Dragoon, Quljotoa. Harquahala. Mohawk
and numerous other ranges In the south, in the Mogollon, Vulture and other
ranges of the central part of the state, and m the Tvapai and other northern
ranges of Arizona, are scores of small camps where from three to SO men
find employment In getting cot and shipping ore. They are mostly Isolated,
away from main lines of travel and their total number and total output of
'metal TSttle realized by tb public at Urge, or even by the larger mining
Interests until effort ia made to get at detail, wlwo their Importance sud
denly comes to the fore. Beya-e of their isolation and Independent opera
tions, these camps seldom make themselves heaxdytn any organized way
calculated or possible of attracting attention to them aa a factor, but just
now they ypear to be coming awake In a manner that will get for them both
prominence in larger extent than ever before, and consideration.
The occasion is found In the threatened reduction of both silver and
copper prices, plus income tax law and powder restriction privileges. AH
of these factors have larger bearing upon the small producer than upon
others. They are vital to htm, meaning that he will either be able to con
tinue business or most close down, and in the latter event carry into the
future the name for his property of being unable to operate at a profit except
on an exceedingly high priced market. Of course, the latter reputation may
be wholly without Justice, because of exceptional operating conditions im
posed by emergency circumstances ot.gr times, but it is hard to satisfac
torily explain these things.
All small producers have been urged to write to Arizona's senators and
representatives at Washington, to the smelters to whom they ship, and to
the Arizona Chapter A. 3tf. C. at Bifibee, setting forth their situations. This
done, organized effort can be made to assist them.
Concerning costs of silver production and demonstrating the futility of
attempt to mine small silver properties in Arizona under any reduction In
price of the metal, the following is taken from the Xew Tofk Commercial
on Tonopah costs. Tonopah Is the best equipped camp in the west to get
out silver at low price. Arizona costs are much higher. The Commercial
ays:
Sixty cents an ounce for silver would have bean considered a very good
price at any time tor 13 years before the war. And any silver mine te the
world that could have looked ahead and figured Its supposed future earnings
on a basis of 60c per ounce for sQver would have considered Itself en Easy
street. Today many of the most important silver mines tn the most Import
ant aiirer mining district in the United States, Tonopah, Nevada, would hare
to shut down if silver sold as low aa 70c ia ounce, or else they would have
to pay Irish dividends" to keep going paying Irish dividends being the
euphonious expression for levying assessments. That Is why the governor of
the state of Xeiada, with a delegation of silver mine operators of Nevada,
an also delegations from the states of Idaho, Colorado. Utah and Arizona have
gone to Washington to protest against the United States government fixing
a price of SSc for all silver production In this country. The Nevada and
western silver producers point out that acme of the biggest silver mines
of the country earn less money en $ silver than wheft silver sold below
COc two years ago.

is found in the plain and evidently

to bring the smaller producer, the op

underlying sincerity could not have

The big gain in the eyes of an onlook

a body of men practically of both
large and small units - of the state's
greatest and practically only industry
could come together and find it pos
sible to talk openly and frankly with
the assurance that the majority of the
citizenship of the state all but a few
radicals, chronic disturbers and pro
German professionals would under
stand and welcome frankness. The
broader thought and co-operation thus
put in the way of coming about far
more than offsets any harm that may

twist and misinterpret frankness Into

The site tf the initial drilling opera

Mr. Edwards, and he is banking his
reputation that the first drill will

Parent Teachers
To Meet Tuesday
Report of the worh or the Parent
Teachers association of Central
school: .
The Parent-Teachers' association of
Central schcfol has held three meetings
this term and has taken up subjects
for discussion which should be of In
terest to all parents of children in the
district .such s the enforcement of
the curfew law in this city, motion pic
tures for the children, lighting of the
playgrounds at Central school, and the
placing of a woman on the police '
t'orce of the city.
The association appointed a commit
tee to wait upon the city council and
the committee was received very cor
dially and was told that the council ,
would be glad to co-operate with the
parents of the city in keeping the .
children oft of the streets at night, '
and that the curfew would be rung on
time and that the police force would
co-operate in enforcing the law.
The council also said they had
thought of the good that might be ac
complished by the right kind ot a wo
man on the force and that they would
take that under advisement In the
near future.
The only good that can come from
any good ordinance or through the.
work of any organisation must meet
with the support of the people whom
it affects, consequently we hope that
the parents of the children of the Cen
tral school will earnestly Co-operate .
with the officers In charge.
On next Tuesday evening is our De-;
cember meeting of the association and
the subject for consideration is of
special Interest to all parents of the
children of the upper grades. It is the
work ot the junior high school, which
will begin on the 2nd of January.
1J18. Mr. Snyder, supervising prin
cipal of the high school work in the
district will explain the work ss far as
It Is now worked out. All parents are
urgently requested to be present.

The secretary pays tribute to the 11 J Th,Ue r nelSn"
You realize all this, but perhaps
you are not clear as to exactly what
you should do to help.
If you own farm land, see that it
is used for the purpose God intended
it for the raising of crops. Yju will
be providing food for our armies and
making profits for yourself.
If you manufacture goods, econo
mize in time, labor and material . in
your factory or shop. Work harder
and more efficiently. Above all. stop
waste. Again, see that you secure the1
business of your home town in your I
line of goods. This leaves the eastern j
manufacturer free to make goods fori
j the army, and for our allies, and cuts,
'out needless transportation expenses.'
1 Incidentally, all these things will bring;
: you greater profit.
! If you are a clerk in an office or
1 a store, work harder it will bring you
j more pay. Cut out some foolish ex-!
i travagance. and so save money. I
! It you are a housewife, follow out

the possibility ot an international navy
to keep the world peace. Such an
agreement cannot be cherished now.
he says, that all the world is at war.
"But if this condition could not be
reached in time of peace." he adds,
"may we not believe that it will be
one of the compensations for the ter
rible tragedy of war?"
Each naval power should asign units
to the international force in propor
tion to its wealth and population, the!
secretary suggests, adding:
"To such a police of the sea this
country will be ready to make Ml
contribution, and to that end the ex
pansion that now crowds all the old
and new shipbuilding resources will
soon place this country from any other
country. It would be a lasting calami
ty If, when tills war ends, there should
linger as a burden upon a pea pie, al
ready hevally taxed by war. a com
petitive program of costly naval con
struction. This country will, no doubt
take its proper place in bringing about
such provisions in the peace treaties
as will never again constrain any na
tion to adapt its naval program to the
program of some other nation from
which there Is the compelling menace
of possible and unprovoked attack.
Such compulsion is the very negative
ot natural and orderly naval develop
ment. It means the tyranny of a pro
gram dictated by apprehension rather
than the free choice of a standard sug
gested by national needs and support
ed by national ideals. An internation
al navy, on the contrary, will make
possible such naval development as
each nation doeras fitting for ita own
people It will also serve "the parlia
ment of man" by providing a naval
force ample enough to give validity to
International decrees and strong
enough to keep inviolate the peace of
the world."

A Different Kind of
Christmas
Gift giving this year is going to
sbe a most practical affair. We
must avoid extravagance and all
waste. Useful, sensible gifts are
the thing. What more practical,
.lasting and worth while a gift t'-an
Something
Electrical .
Electrical gifts are far more than
just remembrances for the time be
ing; they are enduring, lasting re
minders of the giver; they bestow
comfort . and convenience. As a
suggestion, we mention Percola
tor, Flat Iron , Sewing Machine
Motor or Electric Sewing Machine
complete. Toaster, Tea Pot. Chaf
ing Dish, Warming Pad. Curling
Iron, Hair Drying Comb, Washing
and Wringing Machines all of
them socket appliances.
The Gas Range
Another Useful Gift
Along the line of useful gifts, don't
overlook the
Reliable
Gas Range
In many "cases, nothing would
be more appropriate and nothing
would receive a warmer welcome
in the home,
. For many a "Mother" a more
suitable gift could not be thought
of, and through years to come, it
would be a comfort and conveni
ence, therefore, a pleasing remind
er of Christmas, 1917.
