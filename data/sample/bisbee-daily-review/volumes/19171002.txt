Strongest Air Attack o f
Months Is Made Against
English Metropolis. Extent
of Casualties as Yet Un
known.
LONDON, Oct 1. The strongest
air attack yet attempted on London
and the coast towns by the Germans
was carried out tonight by fonr
groups of hostile airplanes. Some of
the machines got through to London
and bombarded the southwestern dis
trict
A terrific barrage was sent up from
the defense guns and the roar of bat
tle lasted intermittently for two and
a half hours.
Coast Towns Bombed.
The Germans bombed coast towns
as they passed over and proceeded to
ward London. Two of the groups suc
ceeded in getting a number of ma
chines through the sky barrage. Nu
merous bombs were dropped on the
southwestern district which is thick
ly populated with the homes of the
upper and middle classes. . The fire
from the defending guns was longer
and louder than ever before. A rain
of shrapnel fell in all sections of the
town and the streets were virtually
deserted.
Weather Inviting.
The weather was perfect for air
operations as there was a bright, full
I moon w't!i no clouds or wind. The
people of London expected a raid and
were waiting for signals. Soon after
7 fc'clcck motors of the volunteer
corps sped through the streets blow
ing their sirens and, displaying an il
luminated notice "take cover," and
other measures were put into action
to inform the populace.
Theater Continue.
Many of the theaters are continuing
their performances nightly. At the
conclusion of the performance in one
of the' leading theaters tonight the
manager came to the stage and in
vited the audience and stage hands

the night performances. All voted in
favor of carrying the mon as usual.

night's raid:
"A group of hostile airplanes cross-

"This group of machines was fol
lowed at about a quarter of an hour's
Interval by a second group which
pursued the same course.
"The first attack on London was
delivered from the northeast about
7:30 p. m.- Most of the raiders were
turned back, but one or more ma
chines penetrated the defense and
dropped bombs In the southwestern

district "About 8:15 p. m. the sec
ond group of raiders attempted to
cross the defenses at various points
in northeast and north London, butj
without success, until shortly after 9 1
o'clock, when a fe of the machines!
passed across London and bombs
were again dropped in the southwest
ern district
"Meanwhile a third group of raid
ers crossed the Essex coast at 8:40
p. m. and proceeded toward London
which was approached shortly before
10 o'clock. They did not penetrate
farther than the eastern outskirts of
London, where some bombs were re
ported to have been dropped.
"No reports of casualties or dam
age have yet been received.
Aerial Barrage
While a tterriflc barrage was kept
up with the bursting, of shrapnel, fur
nishing one of the greatest pyrotechni
cal displays London ever saw, a thirl
ling battle in the air took place be
tween enemy aircraft and British avia
tors in the northern district, according
to special constables, who said they
witnessed it by means of powerful
binoculars. Although the machines
were thousands of feet in the air, the
fire of the machine guns could be
heard distinctly below. When the,
echoes of this fight died ayay the
enti-aricraft gunfire in the city ceased,

Eighty Jailed at Clifton for
Inciting Riots; Town Is Quiet
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX, Oct. 1. With eighty Mexicans and Spaniards undr
arrest in the county Jail at Clifton charged with inciting riot. Sher
iff A. H. Slaughter tonight announced that he believed be had the
situation well in hand following the attempt of 250 armed strikers
to march from Morenci to Clifton early this morning determined to
"clean up on the whites." Over 300 hundred armed citizens are in
readiness to respond to a call from the sheriff, should an attempt
be made to reorganize be made by the strikers. '
The Mexicans are miners who had been told that they could re
turn to work In Clifton today. There has been no settlement of
the differences between the strikers and mine operators in the Clif
ton district and should there be, it will require several weeks before
operations can be resumed, as the mines have become flooded to
some extent during the strike.
When told last night that they had been misinformed, a num
ber of agitators mounted boxes on street corners and harangued the
idle miners.
REITERATION
GIVEN OE JAP
BIG QUESTION
Viscount Ishii Claims That Ja
pan's Pledge Is Not an Ori
ental Monroe Doctrine. He
Shows the Difference.
(By Review Leased Wire.
NEW YORK, Oct. 1. Japan's pledge
to China that she will not violate her
political Independence or territorial
integrity was reiterated and given
especial emphasis tonight by Viscount
Ishii, head of the imperial Japanese
mission, at a dinner given by Oswald
G. Villard. The distinguished guest
explained that his original utterance
had been improperly termed a "Mon
roe Doctrine in Asia." He requested
that his words tonight be "transmitted
to the people of this country."
"I want to make it very clear to
you," said Viscount Ishii, "that the
application of the term Monroe Doc
trine to this policy and principle, vol
untarily outlined and pledged by me,
is inaccurate.
The Difference
"There is this fundamental differ
ence, between the Monroe Doctrine of
the Un ted States as to Central and
South America and the enunciation
of Japan's attitude toward China. In
the first place, there is on the part
of the United States no engagement
or promise, wbile in the other Japan
voluntarily announces that Japan will
herself engage not to violate, the po
litical or territorial integrity of her
neighbor and to observe the principles
cf the open door and equal oppor
tunity, asking at the same time other
nations to respect these principles.
"I ask you to note this with no sug
gestion that I can, or any one does,
question the policy or attitude of your
country, which we well know will al
ways deal fairly and honorably with
other nations.
German Intrigue Cited
"As you must have noticed," be con
tinued, "I have persistently strucl!)
one note every time I have spoken. It
has been the note of warning against
German intrigue in America and in
Japan intrigue which has extended
over a period of more than ten years.
I am not going to weary you with a
repetition of this squalid story of
plots, conceived and fostered by the
agents of Germany, but I solemnly re
peat the warning here."
Confident of Future
Viscount Ishii declared he is confi
dent that Japan and the United States
"from this time forward will be able
effectively to co-operate in all matters
tending to secure a victory in this
and that throughout all tho
years to come differences of opinion
or difficulties arising between our two
countries will be settled, as all such
questions and difficulties can be set
tled, by close friends and partners."
Ambassador Speaks
Ambassador Sato, another speaker,
asserted that the "real significance
of the Ishii mission is its effect upon
the morrow, upon the things that are
to come," and that the visit of the
mission was "a promise and prophecy
of the coming of a saner day, when
there shall be no east and no west
in the wider vision of international
peace."
Good Neighbors
"We are gathering here," he said,
"for a modest bit of work which is
nothing short of wiping the Pacific
ocean from the map of spiritual and

north of the' Ypres and east of Poly

communication from British head
quarters tonight. AH the attacks were
I repulsed with heavy casualties, ex

"At 5:30 o'clock this morning the
enemy launched a powerful attack
on a front of more than a miles

Aerial Activity.
j (By Review Leased Wire.)
J LONDON, Oct. 1. The following of
ficial communication dealing with the
' aerial branch of the army on the
western front, was issued tonight:
"The visibility' improved Sunday
and a great deal of artillery and pho
tographic work was accomplished by
our airplanes. Bombing continued
without respite day and night More
than eleven tons of bombs were
dropped on enemy airdromes at Con
trod e and hostile billets and commun
ications In the battle area and on a
dump and the headquarters near Cam
bra I. The enemy also carried out
many raids during the night, but did
little damage of military importance.
Damage Photograph.
"A photograph taken of the results
of oir bombing at the Controde air
drome shews that Saturday night one
shed of the airdrome was bit and
three large German machines were ly

"The enemy aircraft were not very
active yesterday but a few large for

man machines were downed and eight
driven down out of control. Five of
our airplanes are missing."

Skimmed The Top.
In obtaining indictments against 166
alleged ringleadergs of the conspiracy
the department of justice has simply
skimmed the cream of the investiga
tion. Documents In its possession are
understood to show extensive and far
reaching minor plans, confined to par
ticular localities and designed to af
fect local situations, through which
those named in the indictments and
many others are believed by the au
thorities to have taught to hamper the
government by methods, some or
which have not yet been disclosed to
the public.
The Link Missing.
' Contrary to the general belief no di
rect connection has been shown thus
far between the leaders of the conspi
racy and the huge German corruntion
fund believed to have been operating
in wis country since America's entry
into the war. Many indications noint
strongly to the connection which offii-
ciais nope to establish but none, it Is
reported, is absolutely confirmatory.
This development has led the offici
als to believe that the full scope of the
conspiracy's operations has not yet
been revealed. So far as yet determ
ined, there was no master spy, no sig
nal controlling head, which directed
the activities of the anti-war work
ers. '
Many In Charge.
A gi'jup of fairly generous propor
tions, the evidence indicates, has been
in charge of the entire program of
propangada and outrages from the
spreading of alleged seditious litera
ture to the burning of crops and the
arming of farmers and others to resist
the draft law.
Thet likelihood of another general
Investigation by a single federal grand
Jury Into the scope of the entire con
spiracy is remote, In the opinion of of
ficials but indications are that a num
ber of grand juries, sitting at New
York, Chicago, St Louis. Detroit, Clev
eland and other cities in the east and
middel west will consider local phases
of the program.
Prepare flor Trial.
Preparations for the trial of the 166
persons Indicted at Chicago the larg
est number indicted at one time on one
charge by a single grand jury within
the recollection of officials here are
yet to be made. The immense amount
of work Involved in the preparation of.
evidence wUl require time and It is re
garded as unlikely that the trial will be
held at an aerly date.
Various phases or the investigation
were discussed today at a conference
amOng Attorney General Gregory, As
sistant Attorney General Fitts, who
directed the work of federal officers

More than half of the indicted men,

Members of the organization began
a campaign to raise 1500.000 for a de

Treasury Department Makes
Apportionment for Second
Liberty Loan In the Country
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, October 1. Treasury officials tonight announced the ap
portionment of the second Liberty Loan issue among the federal reserve dis
tricts. Virtually two-thirds of the loan Is expected to be raised by the New
York, Boston, Cleveland and Chicago districts.
Apportionments indicate only what each district is expected to do, and
may be entirely upset, as in the case of the first loan. In making the appor
tionments, officials used two bases of subscriptions, the minimum of $3,000,
000,000 and an "expected amount" of $5,000,000,000.
Apparently in offering the second issue, officials hope to realize a $5,000
000,000 response. Here is the apportionment:

In each case the announcement reads,
the percentage basis and while1 the banking resources of each district tha'
is, total resources of national banks, state banks and trust companies have
been given large consideration. Other factors have been taken into account
such as the income tax, the assessed value of property, subscriptions received
from each district to the first Liberty Loan and amount of bonds allotted on
subscriptions, capital available in each district and its population."
In the first Liberty Loan the banking resources of each federal reserve
district were the sole basis of calculation. Apportionment by States, easy of
compution In the first issue, cannot be determined except by treasury experts
in the second offering. It Is likely such apportionments will be announced
shortly.

Haig has in immediate view.
Bombardment.
Along the coast in Belgium and
around Ypres extremely heavy reci
procal bombardments are taking place.
Nothing is contained in either the
British or German communications to
show that the troops of either side
have left their trenches even for
forays.
Along the iMeuse.
Along both sides of the Meuse river
in the Verdun sector the French and
the Germans are engaged in another
terrific duel. Twice the Germans
launched infantry attacks in an ef
fort to capture positions but on both
occasions they were stopped short by
the French fire.
Demand Reprisal.
While in England the demands of
the ppople for reprisal against the
Germans for air attacks on open
towns continue to grow in volume, the
French fliers have revenged them
selves for a raid on Bar-le-Duc by
heavily bombarding the German town
of Stnttgart from the air. In all a
half ton of explosives was dropped.
Both the British and French fliers
are keeping up their excursions over
German positions in Belgium and
northern France, blowing up air
dromes and military works.
On the Italian Front.
In the Austro-Italian theater the
Austrians have delivered several hea
vy counter-attacks against the new po
sition of the Italians on the Bainsizza
plateau but have been repulsed.
Rubs Activity.
Against the Russians, through an
attack in the Riga region have forced
the Germans to give ground, this time
for a depth of from 800 to 1,000 yards.
Russian airmen to the south have
dropped large quantities of explosives
on enemy camps situated near Kovel.
On the other fronts Uiere is little
activity except in the nature of ar
tillery duels.

Four Groups Raid
City of London
(Continued From Page One.)
driven off under a heavy bombard
ment. Loses His Way
According to a report from an Essex
district, a heavy mist which came up
while the raid was in progress caused
one raider to lose his way while go
ing back to the coast. The German
flew very low and could be seen clear
ly and appeared to be enveloped in
a ring of bursting shells. Seemingly
trapped, the airman began a series of
dips and other hair-raising stunts. He
succeeded in breaking through the
shellfire and made for sea, pursued
by a streak of gunfire.
Safe Places Crowded
As soon as the signal was given in
London that all was clear the streets,
tubes, restaurants and hotels resem
bled New York on election night.
There were great crowds everywhere
laughing and joking and many were
singing. Others were searching in the
bright moonlight for fragments of
shrapnel for souvenirs.
Defenses Effective
Although details were slow in com
ing in, it was apparent that the bar
rage of the anti-craft guns again was
effective in thwarting the German ef
forts. As on other nights, the guns
made it so hot for the raiders that
they dropped bombs in open places,
their one concern being apparently
to unload and get away.
London Fearless
The growing confidence of Ixindon
in the ability of the anti-aircraft guns
to keep the raiders at bay was shown
by the fearlessness " and good be
havior of the crowds. The tactics of
the Germans are so. well known that
they cause spirited betting among
sportsmen as to the tinie of the prob
able raids.
It Is pointed out in this connection
that the Germans work like automa
tons and are not yet able to deceive
anybody but themselves.
Want Reprisals
Early editions of the morning news
papers, which were sought eagerly by
the crpwd which remained up late,
point to the fearless of the German
boast to "burn up London." They also
call attention to "Germany's! lying
claims" regarding "bombs dropped on
military buildings in inner. London
and numerous fires." The newspapers
publish accounts of the thrills given
to London in the last week and com
ment on the fine behavior of the popu
lace.
They print maps showing German
towns within bombing distance of
France and urge "bomb Germanj
now." HIGH SCHOOL CADETS

All of them are fast getting out of tho

work on which to build. In spite of
this, however, excellent progress is
reported by the leader
When the unit gets further along
the promotions will be made. It is
necessary that the captain and the
two lieutenants must be made from
the two upper classes and in good
standing In their school work. Non
commissioned officers can be chosen
from any class, though the freshmen
will. In practically every case, spend

Precautions Taken.
"Many precautions were taken in
case of disaster. The life boats were
filled with boxes of biscuits and kegs
of water and they were then swung
ready for lowering. All the air-tight
compartments were closed and life
belts were in abundance all over the

"We sailed on one or the largest

Two United States destroyers sailed

Charm to Old Homesteads
- fragrance to Cigars
(both lent hy time)

i
Mount Vernon, the home of Wash
ington, owes much of its charm to
the softening, mellowing influence
of Father Time.
The OWL and other mellow Cigars
owe much of their fragrance to the
same mellowing influence of time.
In fact, careful time-curing of
selected tobaccos is the big secret
behind OWL Cigar fragrance.
And to guarantee every OWL a
fragrant OWL requires that a reserve
supply of leaf worth $1,000,000 or
more be constantly curing. For no
leaf must go into the OWL Cigar
until OWL curing experts have pro
nounced it "ready" in OWL mellow
fragrance. And it " takes Mother
Nature and Father Time long months
to get OWL leaf to this "ready-point"
Why don't you try an OWL Cigar
and see how well it keeps for you

LIBERTY LOAN SERVES DOUBLE PURPOSE.
"I knock unbidden once on every door.
If sleeping, wake! If feasting, rise!
It is the hour of fate. . ."
John Gaines, head of the Liberty loan drive for Co
chise county, declares that it is the plan to organize
this second campaign for bonds in such a manner that
a request will be made at every door in the county to
buy a Liberty bond. The drive will start in about ten
days. It is a big undertaking, and business men and
leaders in every walk of life are giving their time and
effort to put the second Liberty loan across.
The fundamental and outstanding principle of a LI
berty loan is the fact that the government and leaders
of thought and action everywhere are out on a campaign
to try to induce the average citizen to make a wise, safe
and patriotic investment and at the same time save a
part of his earnings.
The final fruits of the Liberty bond issue will extend
beyond the defeat of German pride and ambition; they
will be manifest years hence in savings accounts and
nest eggs in homes where the money is needed the most.
To shift from the habit of spending to the habit of sav
ing is always a wrench. The Liberty loan pressure will
win many householders from the spend-it-all path.
Mr. Gaines is sure Cochise will raise its quota on
time.
China has offered to Bend three hundred thousand
soldiers to France if America will eqdip them. What's
the Joke, Ah Sid? America is straining her rigging to
the breaking point to provide equipment for half of the
men she has mobilized right now. This country can
send plenty of men to Europe; she has the men and the
ships to carry them, but to keep them in food and
clothes and ammunition, ah, there's the rub. For every
man sent to France must be required ship tonnage for
about 180 pounds; for his upkeep in bread, bullets, to
bacco and bacon, must be required ship tonnage of
about ten tons; some authorities put it as high as twenty
tons.
And now cometh the milkman and speaks of twenty
cents a quart as compensation for his milk. When chided
by the harrassed householder at the steepness of the
prices, the cowman responds that the price of bran has
mounted to such a height h that he must sell his milk
by the drop or lose money. Bran is now, according to
this husky and honest milkman, ninety dollars a ton.
By the ghost of Adam's off ox! but that is an awful
price to have to pay for bran. Time was, not so long
ago, when bran was high at thirty dollars a ton. Boy,
page Hoover before it is too late.
In Gila valley is a three-acre tract of land that has
just produced a crop of sweet potatoes that sold in thef
market for $1,800. This is a most wonderful news item
and should be proclaimed throughout Arizona from every
school house, pulpit, store counter and street corner.
A new mine strike always means great activity in that
section and the sale of thousands of shares of stock in
new companies. Here is a strike that means millions
and there are no blanks to be drawn by the investor
who sows with judgment and tends with diligence and
harvests with a smile.
The censor moves In mysterious ways his wonders
to perform. No news now from the British front in
Flanders for four days. Does it presage a victory or a
defeat? No one seems 1o kn:iw. It may well indicate
a re-alignment of the Entente forces, and it may mean
German retirement. The Germans have all the word
of it on ground and pot it ions in Flanders now, a com
plete reversal from conditions when the spring fighting
began.
FOR A SQUARE DEAL.
(From the Las Cruces, N. M., Citizen.)
When the so-called "legal" means at hand fail the
American citizen goes after his gun, and he is nearly
always right When the laws of England failed to .give
Americans relief from unjust tax burdens, the. Americans
pulled off the little Boston tea party, and got results
In spreading civilization, law and order over this great
western empire, oftentimes the "legal" methods were un
availing and got nowhere, so the vigilantes took things in
hand, with results; and when it was found that the United
States government was either helpless or too slow to pro
tect its people at Bisbee from the effects of the German
propaganda, the American citizen got his little gun, and
also got results.
Now Mr. Gompers, the head of certain labor unions,
has caused a committee of Investigation to be appointed
by the President for the one purpose, according to the
press dispatches, of ascertaining whether or not any mem
bers of his anions were deported from Bisbee.
The Americans of Bisbee and Douglas will admit rigrt
now that members of the Gompers' unions were deported
because they were as undesirable as the I. W. W. agita
tors, but they were not deported because they did belong
to any unions. Mr. Gompers may not know that hun
dreds, perhaps thousands, of I. W. W. members belon
to his anions, and are secretly working to break up his
organizations and float tiieir, red flag over all unions.
It must be understood all the time that the Americans of
the right type belonging to the onions represented by
Mr. Gompers were not deported, but assisted other Amer
icans to deport the members of the other unions who
were of the I. W. W. type.
Everybody concerned is warned, right now, that the
sheriff over at Tombstone, and the Americans of Bisbee
and Douglas, will stand pat on their record for their
Flag and their country, and the Americans of this great
Southwest are going to see to it that they get a square
deal, too. No one is going to be' made a "goat," either.
This must be an American square deal all the way
through.
TAKE THE SHIPS.
(Los Angeles Times.)
Eighty Dutch ships and twenty Scandinavian ships,
loaded with cargoes of grain and fodder that were placed
on board before July 15, when the embargo became ef
fective, are at anchor in Atlantic ports waiting for ex
port licenses which will not be given them, for it is be
yond question that the nltimate destination of their car
goes is Germany. The grain is rotting and the owners
of the ships refuse to unload it.
Under international law our government has a right
to take these vessels, making proper payment for them.
The Times is of opinion that it should do so and put
them at work in our coastwise trade In place of Ameri
can ships commandeered for government service.
Otto H. Kahn, the well known New York banker, in
an address delivered at Harrisburg, Pa., the other day,
said: "The difference in the degree of guilt as between
the German people and their Prussian or Prussianized
rulers and leaders for the monstrous crime of this war
and the atrocious barbarism of its conduct, is the dif
ference between the man who, acting under the influ
ence of a poisonous drug, runs amuck in mad frenzy and
the unspeakable malefactor who administered that drug,
well knowing and fully intending the ghastly conse
quences which were bound to follow. The world fer
vently longs for peace. But there can be no peace ans
wering to the true meaning of the word, no peace per
mitting the nations of the earth, great and small, to
walk unarmed and unafraid, until the teaching and the
leadership of the apostles of an outlaw creed shall have
decome discredited and hateful in the sight of the Ger
man people, until that people shall have awakened to a
consciousness of the unfathomable guilt of those whom
they have followed into calamity and shame, until a
mood of penitence and cf a decent respect for the opin
ions of mankind shall have supplanted the sway of what
President Wilson has so trenchantly termed 'truculence
and treachery.' "

WAR TALK
I leave my work to roast the kaiser
throughout the neighborhood; my
wife remarks that I'd be wiser if I
saw some wood. She says I ought
to feed the cattle and dig spuds with
a spade, while I am planning siege
and battle, retreat and ambuscade.
Tis ever thus with wives, my masters,
great things they do not heed they
care no hoot for war's disasters, if
there are cows to feed. To plan great
wars I'm amply able, and wish to. but
wife begs that I will crawl beneath
the stable and gather all the
eggs. Qh, there are times when
I'm disgusted because I have
no chance to point out all the
punk, dingbusted boneheads they've
pulled in France. I know just why
the war goes slowly, and I could tell
them how to put an end to strife un
holy, and break the Germans now.
But when I start my explanation, my
wife gets on my trail and drags met
from my congregation, to pack a wa
ter pail. She doesn't care to hear
of trenches, or of the German slump;
she says I ought to take some
wrenches and fix the kitchen pump.
She doesn't care about the navy that
sails the dark blue sea she says I'll
have to stir the gravy while she is
brewing tea. And thus the patriot's
rewarded, who loves the rag to chew;
theres always something punk and
sordid that he is billed to do.

Mexican Representative in

That Boards Are Deliber

Status.
A British leader declares against any peace with un
repentant Germans. What is an unrepentant German?
He is an unbeaten German. Enough said.
It may well have been better for Russia had Korn
flover thrown Kerensky in attempted revolt a few day?
ago. The soldier had some pretty well defined ideas
about stopping cowardice before the enemy that the ci
vilian shrinks from carrying out even if he really has
them. If this be treason, make the most of it.
For the first time since last October the war will
have to take a back seat for a few days until America
settles the baseball championship. Eddie Collins, of the
White Sox, will bat for General ITaig and Clcotte will
relieve the brave Canadians before Lens. The New
York Giants will try to take the U-boat bases in Belgium
and the big date lines will read from the Polo grounds
and Comiskey's park. All hail to the national game.
(Ey Review Leased vV'ire.)
NEW YORK. Oct: 1. More than 100
Mexicans have been illegally drafted
for service in the national army by
boards in this city and many subjects
of Mexico are being secreted here to
prevent their arrest by military author
ities, according to Juan T. Burns, Mex
ican consul-general who tonight de
clared he would "go to any extreme
ii) protect the rights of Mexicans re
siding here."
Knowing his official status mem
bers of a local draft beard have cer
tified for service Jesus Martinez, Mex
ican vice consul in :he draft army, Mr.
Burns said.
Arbitrary Action.
He said he did not know what his
country proposed doing through diplo
matic channels in reference to the im
pression "jf Mexican subjects into the
service of the United States' but de
clared he felt obliged to protes:
against "this arbitrary action commit
ted in a most absurd way."
Mr. Burns asserted that numbers of
Mexicans have been sent to their na
tive country because of the "persecu
tion" of their countrymen here in the
administration of the draft law.
Forced Into Army.
"Mexican citizens have been forced
into the army here without regard to
their nationality," said Mr. Burns.
The men in charge of local draft
boards show such stupidity and such
ignorance of the rights of men that
they can only be compared to the sav
age hordes of Villa, in 'our internal
struggle, who acted without consider
ation and either of humanity or the
legal rights of citizens. .
Situation Abnormal.
"The climax of this abnormal Bi:ua
tion is the lack of responsibility that
the board's assume when they commit
such unjustifiable acts. The case has
been more astonishing because of their
apparent disregard of alien's rights
when they attempt to recruot even con
sular agents with full knowledge of
latter's status.
Boards Criticised.

aim of these boards in forming an
army of foreigners ia light for this
country for what they have no affec

them, unless to create a foreign legion.

Merchants Will
Abide by Wishes
of Citifs People
Twenty-one business houses of the
Warren district were represented last
evening at a meeting held tn Bisbee at
the Phelps Dodge Mercantile com
pany's club room to consider the fu
ture of the 6 o'clock closing. It was
decided to determine, in every way
possible, the wishes of the people ot
the entire community before a final
decision is made. I
To this end George W. Ludwig, who
was mad chairman of the meeting,
appointed a committee of five to de
vice ways and means to get as near
as possible to the exact belief in the
premises by the people. The commit
tee named is M. G. Koby, F. E. Coles,
L. H. Bovee, H. Xathanson, Joe L.
Dick stein.
It developed last evening at the
meeting of the business men that
there is some difference of opinion
on the matter of closing all stores at
6 o'clock every Saturday, and in or
der that harmony might result and
that all of the business houses follow
the same rule it was determined that
some means be developed whereby
the people could decide the matter.
It will be remembered that, the dis
trict, and particularly those of Bis
bee, petitioned the merchants to try
the 6 o'clock closing for a month. This
was September 1. ThouRh it was ap
parent that a majority desired the
trial to become a future rule, it was
in consideration of the majority that
the decision was reached to investi
gate further.
Part of the plan to secure the peo
ple's views include a canvass of the
members of the various organizations
which signed the petitions at the out
set. These organizations include the
Loyalty league. Citizens' Protective
league, the Woman's Loyalty league,
the Warren district chapter of the
American Red Cross, the Young Wom
en's Christian association, the Young
lien's Christian association and the
Warren District Commercial club.
It is proposed that the organizations
mentioned heretofore send to each of
their members some kind of a card
on which to express a "yes" or a "no"
regarding the closing. It may also be
determined to put petitions in many
of the local stores where a resident
may vote his or her preference in the
matter.
The committee appointed last even
ing will meet further and determine
on some plan or plans to get at the
consensus of opinion in Bisbee. Until
that is concluded it appears that the
fate of the 6 o'clock closing will be
held in abeyance.

"What's Wrong With the World?"
usually act as a boomerang, is proved
again. This time G. W. F. Hunt wrote
to a "Wobbly" in Miami. The I. W.
W. fell by the wayside and a curious
"bull" in Southern California "frisked'
him.
But let the Los Angeles Times tell
the story as it appeared in that pa
per's editorial columns under the
head ng, "A Pickled Pilgrim and a
Preposterous Governor":
In a border California railroad town,
in a lot otherwise vacant, was found
the recumbent form of one James
O'Day. Asleep, James afforded a grand
example of things that are not as they
seem. The constable who haled him
away to the calaboose declared him
"beastly drunk" and to be "as dirty
and disreputable a bum as we have
had to handle in quite a while.". But
the constable was basty in his judg
ment. Surrounding the muck of the
gutter, possibly mixed with the reek
of the booze, was an aurora of great
ness that the rude officer failed to
appreciate, if he saw it at all.
When the somnolent individual, so
erroneously listed as a drunken bum,
was "frisked" by the officer, as was
the latter's duty, upon the prisoner
was found evidence that he had mixed
with the mighty and that, of right, he
should be ranked as one of the true
defenders of the common people. In
evidence he bore a little red card
that showed him a member of the
Miami (Ariz.) section of the I. W. W.
But still more firmly establishing his
position as one of the western lead
ers of modern liberal thought there
as a letter from ex-Governor George
W. P. Hunt inclosing the negative of
a photograph in which Hunt and the
misunderstood and alcoholic tourist
stood in affectionate comradeship.
The letter itself is a gem, worthy
of rank with a Ring Lardner master
piece, of diction rare and of high
philosophy; in tone familiar, yet dig
nified, evidencing knowledge of poesy
and showing some of the arts of the
orator. It is felt that it should be
seen in the light of day, just as it
came to O'Day. Verbatim ad lit it
follows, however strange it be to an
editorial column:
Globe, Ariz., Aug. 15, 1917.
My Dear Friend:
Not knowing how long I shall re
main or whether I will get the oppor
tunity of seeing you again.
I want to express my appreciation
;n meeting you. j
I am enclosing you two kodaks pic
tures and the negative, so that if you
care you can have more printed at any :
time. I some times tremble for the fu
ture of my country, when such out
rages as were perpetrated as was pull
ed off in Bisbee on the 12th of July.
Reason and justice seem to have tem
porarily left her throne, but this morn
ing the lines of Tennyson came to me
and when he says:
"When the common sense of most will
hold a fretful realm in awe
And the kindly earth will slumber
wrapted in universal law."
The onward sweep of demoracy for
it is raging the world over, will sweep
away the tangled webs that now beset
us and the new day the Brotherhood
cf man will arrive and we will live in
the sunshine of hope and the dark
clouds that now beset us will only be
a disagreeable dream.
Faithfully yours,
GEO. W. P. HUNT.
Mr. James O'Day,
Globe, Ariz.
There seems no doubt of the authen
ticity or the letter. Its writer (the
signature is an exact replica of that
of Geo. W. P. Hunt on olficial docu
ments) for five years was governor of
Arizona, in that office assumed to rep
resent the character of the population
of a great state. Twice he was elect
ed. A third term was denied by the
voters, who, at the same time, by a
plurality of many thousands for Wil
son, reaffirmed their allegiance to the
democratic party to which Hunt as
serts he belongs. Governor Hunt ap
pealed from the verdict of the people.
He lost in the lower court. The case
now is before the state supreme court
on allegations of eiror largely tech
nical in character.
Throughout his gubernatorial career
Hunt maile it more than clear that he
wished to be coiibiilored the champion
of the comiiiuu people, with especial
emphasis on "common." His interest
rceiiied to lie wholly in lh "submerg
ed tenth." The unsuhmerged niue
tcntlis appeared to concern him very
little. He visited the penitentiary often
and sought renown as a prison re
former, with little or no reference o
the reform of the "untortuuates. . for
whom prisons have to be built and
maintained. Hunt's official messasei;
and public utterances were filled wilh
soapbox phrases. Alvas he was

Big Quota Meets
Today In Smelter
City Draft Army
Two hundred and seventy Cochise
county men and a considerable num
ber of alternates will appear at Doug
las this morning at 7:30 o'clock in
answer to the third call for men for
the National army. They will leave
for Camp Funston, Kan., Wednesday
evening on a special train.
Douglas' Y. M. C. A. will w ill be the
gathering place for the men and the
time will be early. Captain Harry C.
Wheeler, sheriff of Cochise county and
chairman of the exemption board, will
be there to meet the men and take
charge of their first days' two work
in the National army.
Bisbee is sending a large number
of men for the occasion. Last even
ing was one of handshaking and of
saying "good-byes" in the Warreif;
district.
People of Douglas, notably the wom
en, are preparing to give the men a
great farewell time. This evening on
Ninth street a carnival will be staged
for their benefit. The drafted men
will be honored guests. Ribbons, with
the words, "National Army, Cochise
County, Arizona," will be given to
every man. This is tantamount to a
key to the city of Douglas.
Many people from the Warren dis
trict have made arrangements to go
to the Smelter City today or tomor
row for the final meeting of the men.
and it seems certain that visitors from
all parts of the county will throng
Douglas with a similar purpose in
view.

rolls only as the owner of small per
sonal property. Realty, mines, banks.
all were abhorrent, as evidences of a
wealth necessarily predatory.
The above letter does not discredit
Hunt's well-known views. It wag just
the letter for him to w rite.
Last year in the Crifton (Ariz.) dis
trict was a long strike, backed by the
sheriff and by the governor, then in
office. Scores of men not in sympathy
with the aims of the illiterate rabble
were "run out" of the camps, many
of them beaten up in the process.
Tearing for their lives, the mine man
agers had to flee to El Paso. At Dun
can, at the expense of the mining
companies, had to be established a
refugee camp, filled with workmen
who had remained loyal or who had
incurred the displeasure of the "labor
leaders. The mines and works had to
be abandoned to the mob. Governor
Hunt sent troops to the scene, but
the militia officers were forced to re
main inactive while American citizens
were drummed past their tents, with
hooting and violence. The governor
appeared at Clifton, but only to ex
press his sympathy with the strikers
and to intimate that a "bullpen" might
be the destination of any who opposed
them.
Praise be. Hunt wa3 not In office
when the I. W. W. started their devil
try in Arizona last June. The agita
tors had, however, the backing of
many anti-capitalistic daws that had
been passed by weak-kneed legislators
at Hunt's suggestion. It happened
that the Clifton experience was ex
actly reversed at Bisbee, where the
people at large, tired of control by
foul-mouthed traitors and their foreign
dupes, rose and deported the I. W. W.
to the last man, incidentally adding
the the other riff-raff of the communi
ty. Thi. however, was done quietly,
without the Clifton accompaniment of
tin cans and curses.
Hunt appeared again in the lime
light three months ago, appointed
"mediator" in the Arizona strikes, an
nounced as "personal representative
of the president." He doesn't appear
to have bad much luck in the way of
mediation. Bisbee, "where reason and
justice seems to have temporarily left
her throne," has solved her own eco
nomic questions very well indeed. The
Columbus refugee camp is vacant, for
its rations were cut off. In Jerome
the I. W. W. were run out by union
men. In Miami and Globe, where
Hunt found companionship with the
I. W. W., both union and non-union
men are at work, protected by federal
cavalry from the fury of I he mob.
Arizona is "finding herself" slowly.
Just as surely as the kaiser cult has
led to bloodshed in Europe, just so
surely Huntism has been responsible
for the miserable and disloyal dis
turbances Arizona has knowu for five
cars past. The man has led. delib
erately, in setting class against class
and in stirring up antagonism th:it
never may be lived down and that
must be bitter for years to come.
Even when out of state office, wheil
honored by the president of (he na
tion, he has shown his prejudices, as j
well as his caliber, in the letter writ-1
ten to his friend. O'Day, the pickled 1
pilgrim. It is told that Hunt still has
much political strength in the Sun
Kissed state. God save Arizona!

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

well conceded that after the Liberty
loan offering is out of the way that
there will be distinct hardening in
money rates. As it is now, 6 per cent

probable that corporations, which will
need funds for the first half of the
next year, will have to ray rates in a
degree, may necessitate rcu?'!on In

SHELL GAME HOOKS
BISBEE MINER AND
LANDS HIM IN JAIL
Matt Eppich, of This City, Is
Sadder and Wiser and
Poorer. There Are Still
Suckeis in the World.
Matt Eppich, a Bisbee miner, who is
frugal and saving, realizes, now, the
worth of the saying, "you can't get
something for nothing." With a Los
Angeles "con" man he inhabits a part
of the Los Angeles city jail; Eppich
being churned with attempted murder
and the "con" man with various
crimes, known to le practiced by his
craft.
Leaving Bisbee with $800, Eppioh
decided he Vuld go to Los Angeles
for his vacation. He arrived in the
Angel city and believed all he heard
and much of what he saw.
Shortly after his arrival he met a
man; a prepossessing man. His ac
quaintance knew Los Angeles and was
a nice companion. He apparently,
had money to spend and enjoyed Ep
pieb's company. He also knew, when
better acquainted with the Bisbee man
where, between the two, they could
win a lot of money without titouble.
Accordingly the two went to Venice.
They entered a room and the new ac
quaintance persuaded a third party to
get his "lay out" in working order.
That "lay out" consisted of a board,
three English walnut shells and a
small gutta pearcha ball.
Here the censor dilleted the manu
script. But the next heard of the af
fair was that Eppich, with his mus
tache shaved Vff, another suit of
clothes on his back, met one of his
erstwhile acquaintances and opened
fire on him with a revolver. The
shooting occurred on Spring street, Los
Angeles. Eppich was arrested and
so was the object of his poorly-directed
ammunition.
The police 'jf L03 Angeles are now
looking for the second "con" man and
Eppich's fate hangs in the balance. So
does his $800.
Negro Troops to
Train at Camps
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1. With plen
ty of room available at the national
army cantonments, due to the large?
number of men to be withdrawn to
fill up the national guard and other
branches, the war . department has
again modified its plans for training
negro troops for the national army
forces. It is now the purpose, Secre
tary Baker said today, to train a com
plete unit of negroes at each of .the
sixteen cantonments, instead of train
ing them only at cantonments to
which a considerable Teport ' The
size of the unit will depend upon the
number of negro drafted men from
the divisional area which supplies
each cantonment, but where there is
a large surplus, men will be sent to
posts with smaller numbers for con
solidation with the training units
there.
The first of the drafted negroes
will be mobilized under the call of
October 3. The number to be taken
from each division will not be uni

received from Maj'or Grayson M. P.,
Murphy Red Cross Commissioner to
France:
"The medical work for children
which the American Red Cross has un
dertaken at Toul kad its formal open

the department, two general ot tne

American flags were raised in front l
the new brick barracks given by the
Frenchr government for the children's
refuge. The perfect warmly thanked
the American Red Cross for its help
with the children.
"The new staff, consisting of several
specialists in children's diseases and
fifteen nurses and aides, are at work
under the direction of Dr. Sedgwick,

CANADIAN HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, Oct 1. (By Canadian
Press. ltd.) Report that the rank
and file of the enemy troops have a
great longing for peace is confirmed
by every prisoner captured. One of
their chief grievances is the failure
of their higher officers to take risk.
Even company commanders freely de
pute to the under officers their duty
while in the trenches and remain well
back from the front.
So Different.
This Is so different from the rela
tions between our officers and men
that it is freshly impressed upon the
minds of the Germans on every occa
sion when there is hand to hand fight
ing in which our officers invariably
lead their men, while the German of
ficers seldom do so. They are not
actuated by fear and it must be as
sumed that they are obeying order
in this hanging back. Very great
losses of the German i officer flass
early In the war may have made it
necessary to conserve their leaden.
Whatever is the reason for their fail
ure to take risks as great as those
to which their men are subjected, the
latter are deeply discontented.
