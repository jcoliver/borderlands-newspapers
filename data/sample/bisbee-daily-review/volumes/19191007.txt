basis for harmonious relations be
tween capital and labor during the
Tirpspnt ahnormal economic condi

active in directing the affairs of the

INVESTIGATION OF HELENA RACE RIOTS DIVULGES
"GET-RICH-QUICK WALLINGFORD" OF THE SOUTH
WHO MAKES WILD PROMISES AND MUCH MONEY
i
HELENA, Ark., Oct. 6. A state
ment was made today on the re
cent riots by E. M. Allen, of the
committee of seven, authorized by
local officers and Gov. Brough to
investigate the trouble, charging
that the affair was an organized
negro uprising, fostered by a
negro who preyed on "the ignor
ance and superstition of a race of
children for monetary gains."
Mr. Allen, who was one of 21
leading men marked for death,
after hearing confessions, examin
ing circulars and other evidence
procured by state and military of
ficials in connection with the
work of the committee, issued the
following statement to explain
what the committee had found to
be the situation leading to the
killing of five white men and up
wards of a score of negroes:
"The present trouble with the
negroes in Phillips county is not a
race riot. It is a deliberately
planned insurrection of the ne
groes against the whites directed
by an organization known as the
'Progressive Farmers and House
holders Union of America, estab
lished for the purpose of banding
negroes together for the killing of
white people. This union was
started by Robert L. Hill, a negro
26 years of age, of Winchester,
Ark., "who saw in it an opportunity
of making easy money. He has
been a farmer all his life but
lately had been posing as a "priv
ate detective doing work in this
and all foreign countries.'
Starts Lodge
"He started his first union work
In April of this year. He organ
ized the "Ratio Lodge In May of
this year. He told the darkies
that he was an agent of .the gov
ernment and because the senators
and representatives In Washing
ton were white men and in sym
pathy with th& white men of the
jouth,it was Impossible for the
negroes to get thertgrits"that had
been promised them for service in
the army and so the government
had called Into existence this or
ganization which would be sup
ported by the government In de
fense of the negroes against the
white people. He told them it was '
necessary for all members of the
anion to arm themselves In pre
paration for the day when they
should be called upon to attack
their white oppressors.
"The slogan of the organization
Is We Battle for Our Rights.' The
password of all the negroes was
We Have Just Begun.'

"Negro men were charged $1.50
entrance fee and negro women 50
cents. At the second or third
meeting, he would bring Dr. V. E.
Powell of Winchester with him
who was purported to be the ex
amining physician for the govern
ment in its work of registering the
negroes in defense of their rights.
A certificate was. filled out and
signed by the doctor and given to
each nesrro upon payment of 50
cents. This certificate was sup

ment. ; Those negroes who were '
possessed of funds . in amounts
from $5 to $25 were enrolled in an
' advanced section of the union and
upon payment of whatever sum he
(Hill) could procure In excess of
$S a certificate was given en
titling the holder , to attend the
congresses of the union at Win
chester and speak, on the floor of
the meeting regarding any ques

keeping the constitution of the
United States from being ques
tioned. "Another form of exortation was
to sell shares of $10 each to the
negroes In a proposed building to
be erected by the union at Win
chester. Hill had so planned his
campaign that any negro possess

'an opportunity to Invest In some

ate Said About to Act; All
Parties Desire Vote Soon
WASHINGTON, Oct. 6. Considera
tion of the peace treaty In the senate
today did not reach the reading of the
printed text leading up to the Shan
tung provision on which the next
fight will be made. The day's pro
gram comprised four speeches, with
a small attendance and listless inter
est In the proceedings.
The principal speech was by Sena
tor McCumber of North Dakota, Re
publican member of the foreign rela
tions committee, who declined to sign
the majority report recommending
amendments and reservations to the
treaty and the league of nations cov
enant. Other speakers were Sena
tors McCormick. Illinois, and Lenroot,
Wisconsin, Republicans, and Walsh,
Democrat, Montana. The discussion
related to much ground heretofore
covered although Senator McCormick
deyoted some attention to the British
Persian treaty.
Some senators anxious to speed up
the treaty had Indicated that it might
be possible to jump right into discus
sion of the Shantung question, with
prospects of a vote within the next
few days.- There was scarcely a ref-'
erence to it, however, and as the de
bate was general, no effort was made
to resume the reading so as to bring
the senate up to the Shantung amend
ment, next on the list for a vote.
' Ready for Action.
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska,
leading the Democratic fight for. un
amended ratification, objected today
to a move to set aside the treaty tem
porarily to consider another matter,
and in doing so insisted that the sen
ate should begin work on the pact
earlier than 2 o'clock, the. usual hour
at which it has been called up.
Members of both houses of congress
are counting on a recess about the
first of next month, and s this de
pends, of course, upon final disposi
tion of the treaty, the suggestion has
been made by some senators, it was
said, that the two parties endeavor
at separate conferences to figure on
how much actual talking time will be
required by both sides. As it seejns
to be admitted that every senator
knows now how he will vote, regard
less of future discussion, there is still
a growing disposition in some quar
ters not to prolong the proceedings
by speeches although Democratic and
Republican leaders unite In declaring
that attempts to shut off speeches
will not be tolerated. What they seek,
it is said, is a voluntary agreement,
called to hasten a vote.
Denies Unequal Vote.
Senator McCumber, in his speech
today, sharply denied the argument
that Great Britain would have six
votes against one for the United
States in the league, and contended
that the United States would be the
dominant power.
Leonard Wood, command of the cen
tral department of the army, took over
control of the situation at Gary to
night, following an appeal for aid to
General Wood from Governor Good
rich of Indiana. Upon arrival of the
federal troops, the state units, which
have been distributed over the In
diana strike district, were withdrawn
from Gary and concentrated in -Indiana
Harbor and East Chicago.
There was no disorder in either of
the strike centers today, but at Gary,
where the mayor had forbidden par
ades or mass meetings, two thousand
strike sympathizers, headed by L'Ou
former slldlers in uniform paraile.t
through the main streets of the town
and held a meeting in East Side park.
tSate troops on duty in the town made
no effort to interfere with the parad-i

SITUATION N
TURKEY SAID
Tl
PARIS, Oct. 6. (By The Associ
ated Press.) The new 'situation in
Turkey which' has arisen through
the resignation of the cabinet is
regarded in French circles as con
fronting the peace conference with
another grave and urgent problem.
Tno downfall of the government is
attributed to the occupation of Ko
nish by iationalist forces under Mus
tapha Kemad, who, according to
some estimates, has 300,000 men.
The press generally considers that
Asia Minor has entirely escaped
from the control of Constantinople
and that . the young Turks are re
gaining the upper hand. Some of
.ih'? newspapers point put that there
is no force available to deal with
th refractory elements; others auk
wiit'lher the entente powers are suf-
f iclently uaited and. inclined to ' the
" necessary " powerful intervention.
French official circles direct at--'
v tehtiorf f b " ' the 4 fact : tiat ' DJemal
Pasha, the new war minister, is tho
political, ally of -'Mustapha". Kemad,
and the Vench generally are bf the
opinion that the change in the cabi
net may result in stablizing the
government and jextending its , au
thority over geat) territories.
The sultan's decree, according to
the advices received, by the French
authorities, outlines a policy which
appears to embody an endeavor to
reach an understanding with the
nationalists.

MELS AT
NIAGARA FALLS
BUFFALO, N. Y., Oct. 6. The
queen of the Belgians was enthralled
today by the mighty, cataract of Ni
agara. The cordial semi-military
greeting given the Belgian rulers by
Buffalo was delightful to them, but
it was the memory of the great falls
her majesty will carry with her long
est and of which she exclaimed most
often to those in her entourage. King
Albert, his consort, and the duke of
i?rabant, their son, came as near to
playing this morning as royalty can
come and they reveled in the demo
cratic freedom of the pilgrimage to
Niagara Falls. They overstayed by
two hours the time alloted to them
there, and even then were reluctant
to leave. His majesty was seeing the
falls for the second time, but he was
manifestly happy at being able to
show them to his wife.
As for the crown prince, he seemed
to be having the time of his life. He
lagged behind the servants of the
household and the king's valet who
were trailing at a respectful distance
and then skipped out of the path, to
run past them over the rock without a
thought of royal precedent.
The royal party saw all there was
to see, and saw it thoroughly. To
get in a more comprethensive view
of the American side, they crossed
ahead into Canada for half an hour
us the guests of the Dominion gov
ernment. As a courtesy to the Cana-;
dians, the American officers attached 1
to the Belgians stopped in the middle
of the international bridge, where the
Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack ;
waved side by side.

Everything that falsely encourages
unrest also encourages bolshevism.
Misunderstanding of American indus
trial organization, and of its benefits to
mankind, leads to unrest, dissatisfaction,
and radicalism. .
For example, the Federal Trade Com
mission tells the public that the large
packers had an agreed price for lard '
substitute (made of cotton-Seed oil.)
It reproduces letters taken from the
files of one of the packers, showing
that such agreed price existed.
But it failed to mention that the agreed
price was determined at the request of
and in co-operation with the Food
Administration!
Even the Department of Justice, in its unjust
attempt to create prejudice against the packers, has
made public these same letters, with no explanation.
How long must this kind of misrepresentation
continue? In so far as it is believed, it not only breeds
discontent, but results in injustice to our industry.

By U. S. Submarine
NEW YORK, Oct. 6. The steamer
Lexington, bound for Providence, R.
I., with several hundred passengers,
was rammed by a submarine tonight
in Hell Gate. The passenger steam
er headed immediately for the Astoria
shore of the East river. Persons on
the shore could not tell at first how
badly the steamer was disabled. A
score of launches and rowboats im
mediately put out to her.
The Lexington, which is owned by
the Colonial Navigation ' company,
reached the Astoria shore and docked
there.
JAEL SUSPECT
I T
NEW YORK, Oct. 6. Quick action
on the part of the crew in closing the
water tight "collision bulkheads" of
the steamer Lexington tonight pre
vented a possible loss of life when the
craft was rammed by the United
States submarine 0-7, in the treacher
ous waters of the Hell Gate channel
in the upper East River.
The Lexington, a colonial line
steamer, was bound for 'Providence
with 400 passengers, when, according
to passengers, the submarine which
had been maneuvering on the surface,
suddenly headed across her bow. Many
of the passengers were thrown off
their feet by the impact.
A jagged semi-circular hole of 15
foot radius was torn in the bow of
the Lexington. The submarine was
not damaged.
Ensign J. Boyce, who piloted the
submarine ,was the only man injured
His arm was crushed badly.

dier who hold up and robbed three
Albanians, Malmet Asian, Sols Als and
I. W. Tell, in their room over the
Los Angeles grocery store Saturday
night, Charles II., Berry was arrested
early Sunday morning arter being
identified by the men who say he
robbed them.
As soon as the robbery was reported
Chief Kempton went out on the trail
of the man with Tell, who said the
soldier had taken $235 from him. Tell
pointed out Berry standing on a street
corner.
In the jail Berry was lined up with
six other soldiers in uniform and he
was readily identified by the two oth
er men who had been' robbed. He had
$129 in his pocket book, Including five
520 bills which was the form the
money was in which he is charged
with having taken.
Berry is a private in the air service.
He was turned over to the military
authorities for trial. The provost mar
shall of Camp Jones said that he had
been in similar trouble before.
Double Guards in
German Strike Area
COBLENZ, Germany, Oct 6. The
American soldier guara through the
area occupied by the American army

the German socialists is due within a
few days. Soldiers with machine
guns guard the approaches to all
bridges over the Rhine and Moselle
and are stationed at railroad division
al points and various other places
where trouble might break out.
In a proclamation issued today the
mayor of Coblenz warns all civilians
to take cover, preferably at their
homes, when the steam siren is sound
ed in case of an outbreak.

structed to assemble and fall in un
der arms at the headquarters of their
unit should the siren be heard. ,

THE NEW STAR
Oh, where is Walter Johnson,
The mighty man of yore;
And where is Alexander,
And Mathewson and Shore?
No more their glories glisten,
No more their records shine,
Since Eller, mighty Eller.
Took Chicago down the line.
Now Ruth is in the discard.
And Marquard's up the spout,
While Coombes has been forgotten.
And Williams is shut out.
A new star has arisen
To gleam with luster fine,
Since Eller, mighty Eller,
Took Chicago down the line.

THE BRITISH RAILWAY STRIKE j
THE STRIKE of the railway workers in Great Britain is not a
strike for wages or for better working conditions, but, accord
ing to Premier LJoyd George, "was engineered for some time
by a small body of men who have wrought tirelessly and in
sidiously to exploit the labor organizations of this country for sub
versive ends." .
So it appears that the strike is not unlike that which now in-,
volves the steel industry of the United States. In both countries
advantage has been taken of the condition of general unrest and
uneasiness on the part of labor to stir up to action, although as a
matter of fact the men themselves have little or nothing to gain in
case of success. , -
What we see going on everywhere is a movement engineered by
labor agitators and radicals to gain political and economic power.
Here the -initiative blow was struck in the basic industry of the na
tion as offering the best chance of winning. The labor leaders did
not dare try at this time to involve the brotherhoods in a railroad
strike, although they made threats. On the other side, however,
the British labor party has long been preparing to carry out its
program for the nationalization of the railroads, which means nothing
less than destruction of the capital and wage systems. This pro
gram is frankly admitted by such men as Arthur Henderson and
Robert Smilie.
"Down with the wage system!" is the slogan of the strikers.
The time is ripe in the minds of their leaders for a revolution that
shall spell the downfall of capital and the enthronement of labor.
But King Labor marches to power while her votaries sing "The
Red Flag." They applaud Lenine and Trotsky and hunger for the
Russian system of a government by the Bolshevists and for the Bol
shevists. If this 6trike in Great Britain were' merely confined to the rail
way workers the government would easily find indeed, has found
a Way tc (,Vv,rcome it, through water wrelght, motor usn-jport and
airplane. But if all the transport workers join in the fight England's
situation might in the course of a very short time become critical.
It now seems to be a question of whether the strikers can starve
the people into submission. At this time is seems impossible. The
great majority of the people are not with tho - strikers JThe gov
ernment of Lloyd George, which seemed about to fall through its
own inefficiency, has been immeasurably strengthened by its iesolve
not to allow the railroads to become the prey and tht propsrty of the ,
operatives!
WANTED A WATCH DOG
(URING the period of the war many new boards, commissions,
bureaus and officials were created. The time was propitious
for putting anything over which by any stretch of the imagina
tion might seem calculated to help win the war. Although we
had formerly been accustomed to calculate public expenditures in
terms of millions, we quickly adjusted our sights and acquired the
habit of talking and thinking in billions.
Now that the war appears to have been won, thoughtful citi
zens are wondering just how many of those war boards, commissions
and bureaus will be abolished, how many 'will be continued under
their original titles and how many will be permanently fastened upon
the overburdened taxpayers under new names. It is unfortunately
true that Congress does not like to let go any of the perquisites of
federal patronage. ' '
We note that a bill has been introduced in the Senate "to regu
late the manufacture, sale, purchase and use of explosives." It reads
very much like the war-lime explosives act which has provided
places for innumerable Inspectors, deputy inspectors, officials large
dna orficial3 small, and which also has pestered patient citizens be
yond measure. Doubtless that army of patriotic experts hates to be
demobilized. Having wdn the war, they yearn for the appreciation
which might be evidenced by retaining them on the payroll.
In times past, various distinguished Senators and Representa
tives, by dint of conscientious public service, have earned the nick
name of watchdog of the treasury. Who is the watchdog now. 'How
welcome would his honest bark sound at this time when the voice
of economy seems lost in a wilderness of public expenditures!
Instead of perpetuating the explosives act it might be wiser for.
Congress to give more thought to a real explosion which will occur,
one of these days unless the overburdened taxpayer is given neces
sary relief. When tax monies pour into the public coffers in billions
they almost cease to look like money. But the taxpayer who con-,
tributes his mite to that golden flood has no hallucinations on the
subject. He knows (hat his contribution consists .of hard-won dol
lars and cents, real money, coin of .the realm. He also knows, which
many statesmen do not, that money does not grow on bushes or
descend manna-like from heaven Tucson Star.
A KING AND A QUEEN
J
AMONG all our distinguished visitors of this port war period
there are none more deserving of a cordial welcoma and an
ever vigilant hospitality t-han King Albert and Queen Elizabnh
of Belgiur. The socialist mayor of our Milwaukees may rant
and tear to their dear hearts' content and turn their ill-mannered
backs on the coming of this royal pair, but it will not lessen in the
slightest degree the feeling which all decent , Americans have for
this brace man and woman.
For it is not Albert, "king by divine right" whom we welcome
to these shores, nor is it Elizabeth, raised to the dignity of a queea's
position by marriage, although in paying homage in our American
way to them we honor the brave little country over which they rule.
But it Is the brave man and the good soldier whom we greet, the
royal leader of his little flock who stood out against the German
invasion in August, 1914, and gave France and Great Britain time
to get set for the shock, even at the sacrifice of Belgian men and
Belgian lands and properties; and it la the able consort of this heroic
figure whom we are proud to welcome, the kindly, self-sacrificing
mother of hep people who by word and deed did a noble. Work in.re-V

the Belgium of old seemed to have been drowned in blood and tears.

As I lay, half awake, my thoughts
drifted backward to the early days
of my singing start In. my Meriden.
Connecticut, home. At 9 I remem
ber to have sung, as most children
will; and later, I be,gan studying the
piano with Miss Anna Ryan, or
ganist of the church of Our Lady of
Mount Carmel.
Turing the ensuing years until I
was about twelve I sans whenever 1
found a chance, and by degrees the
Meriden people came to believe I
had an unusual voice. Father and
Mother, who were musical, took my
inging as matter of course for my
elder sister, Carmella. had a voice.
My piano lessons went on, ' because
my parents felt a knowledge of music
to be reeded by everya who has
musical talent.
I was about twelve. I think, when
Carmella took me one Sunday to
the choir loft In our church, the one
I mention where Miss Ryan was or
ganist. I sang with her and the others
that day; and that flred my Ambi
tions, and I continued for s' t
years, never missing a service.
By the time I reached my . I
never missed . a . chance to do so
when asked. Then one day the pro
prietor of a Meriden motion picture j
theatre offered me a position. Ha j
said he would pay me twelve dollars
a week If I would play the piano and
sing a few songs while the pictures ,
were being shown. j
Mother has said often that I waa
excited when I came to her for per
mission to accept this chance to earn ;
a fortune, and that for days after-,
ward I seemed in a sort of unnatural '
exhilaration. Then came the after
noon of my first appearance in tb
motion picture theatre, which was the
most important moment of my life.
After that experience I began to '
think, as much as a fifteen-year-old
child is capable of thinking, mora
seriously of music. It was several
months after my engagement that
an Incident occurred that made a ca
reer, in some form, a more definite
thingthe Incident being an offer
from the owner of the rival Meriden
motion picture theatre to appear in
his place of amusement. As he of
fered ma fifteen ooHts a week I
accepted.
Very shortly this nan won my
mother's permission to allow me to
sing twice a week In a theatre he
had in a nearby town, and enter
ing upon my duties there I not only
found my experience Increasing but
my earnings as .well. . ,
And the months slipped by, with
my voice gaining In strength and
quality. i
The public applause I received,
and the personally given compli
ments, began in course of time to
have their Influence. It gradually
dawned upon my comprehension that
my singing gave pleasure and that
I liked to sing better thtr anything
else.
, Beginning, about this tline. to find
my small reputation traveling to
other towns near Meriden, I received
different offers to sing in other mo
tion picture theatres, all of which I
refused. But one day when I wn

to sing in the dally musical programs

pfclrfry befng several times what I!

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 6. Laid late, after a poor n ight's sleep, which made me feel illy
all during the day, although toward the evening an unexpected glass of wine
cheered me somewhat and strengthened me for the night's work. To the
Coaper Queen hospital, where I visited the cashier, who has had tonsilitis,
and did find him recovering rapidly, although still weak. Did meet Miss Kan
dolph, the matron, who did show me through the edifice, and I marveled
hugely at its cleanliness and orderliness, which made me think that being
ick in Bisbee, with such a hospital and such a nurse, could not be an ex
ceeding evil. She did talk interestingly, too. of her work and of the details
of such an institution, and of this conversation I took good notes. To the
orfice, where I found the telegraph editor back from a Sunday at Douglas,
which he spent with some school teachers there. And he is loath to come
back to Bisbee, although I hear there are many teachers here, of which fact,
however, I have not certain knowledge. But I hope so ror the editor's sake.
To the police station, where Chief Kempton did tell me a mighty interesting
tale of the death of his brother, while doing his duty by the government and
his own soul. Word during the day from Tombstone that the supervisors
had a fiery meeting, at which Roberts and Adams were accused of slipping
something over, but could not get the details. Much money lost this day
in the town through the baseball game, and men swearing because Cincinnati
has so upset the dope. Did read an Arizona weekly, which, it seemed to me,
although a stranger, to be such a publication as exists only for evil; the
blessing of which is a reproach and the curse of which is impotent; which,
like a snail, lives only to spread its trail of slime across the sun-kissed flow
ers, and which men hesitate to crush lest they defile the very ground on
which it crawls. To the office, where I did work without much ambition,
thinking all the time about another glass of wine but diffident about asking
about it. Thence to bed, taking one of my landlady's sleeping tablets, which
I pray God will do me some good.

CHICAGO, Oct. 6. Pat Moran tele
graphed this evening to have the big
staff in Redland park measured for
one of the latest style world cham
pionship flags. The Reds today won
the fifth game of the world series,
defeating the Chicago White Sox, 5
to 0, in a contest that developed sen
sational pitching, sharp fielding, one
sided batsmanship and very nearly
deprived the Sox of their last glim
mer of hope.
The National league champions
have now won four games and need
only one more to clinch the bunting.
By the same token the Sox can annex
the major share of the money only
by winning four straight games.
The teams left for Cincinnati to
night for two games, if that many
are required.
"Hod" Eller, a White Sox castoff
of four years ago, gratified the dear
est wish of his heart by attaining
the victory. He held his former team
mates practically helpless through
out. He allowed them only, three
widely separated hits, gave but one
pass and established a record for con
secutive strikeouts in a world series
game; In the second and third in
ning he fanned six batsmen in a row,
aad in the fourth he was going so
strong that the first two Sox who
faced him dribbled the ball to him
for easv outs at first, and the third
man struck out. He delivered twot
more doses of the same medicine be-
fore the game was over, a iuuu ui
nine strike outs for the game.
Williams Comes Back.
Claude Williams, wiio was defeated
in the second game of the series at
Cincinnati, hurled for the Sox, and
did about all that a pitcher could to
win. He walked but two men and
did not allow a hit until the fifth
Inning. iThe Reds got only 'three
more hits oft his delivery, but these,
after the world's series fashion of
the Reds, were forthcoming In the one
Inning in which they were most need
ed. In this instance, the avalanche
descended in the sixth round. The
air was fairly foggy with hits, inten
sified by a walk and an error, and
when the air cleared the score board
Ehowed that four Red Legs had
readied the countin gstation. It was

retired to allow Murphy to appear
in the role of a pinch hitter, but he

the mound for the Sox. His wildness

PHOSPHATE
A French scientist has discovered
an organic phosphate which should be
a very effective remedy for weak
nerves, sleeplessness, ihinnes3 and
lack of strength, energy and vigor.
Its substance is described by spe
cialists as identical in composition
with certain vital elements naturally
found in brain and nerve cells and
one which when taken into the hu
man system is quickly converted Into
healthy living tissue.
This phosphate is already widely
known among druggists in this coun
try as Bitro-I'hosphate and some phy
sicians claim that through its use
strength, energy, vigor and nerve
force are frequently increased in two
weeks time.
Dr. Frederick Kolle, Editor of New
York rhysicians' "Who's WTho," says
it should be prescribed by every doc
tor, and used in every hospital in the
United States. As there are a great
variety of so-called phosphates, those
who wish to test this substance

was partly responsible for the final
run with which the visitors capped
their score.
Schalk, premier catcher of the
American league, or any other league,
according to his admirers, came for
ward as the first player to be Phased
by an umpire during the series. It
was in the sixth, when most every
thing happened, that this occurred.
Oroh had slid to the plate, accumu
lating large holdings of base line real
estate on the facade of his anatomy
and Schalk claimed that he touched
the runner before the latter had
plowed his way to the plate. In his
excitement he jumped up at Umpire!

jolted the judicial hair there impound
ed. Rigler pointed to the coop and
Schalk, mumbling things that the
late Noah Webster never encountered
in hi3 researches, made way for
Lynn, who caught the remainder of
the same for the Sox.
' Fld Excellent.
The field was in excellent condi
tion despite the fain of yesterday,
and 34,379 persons paid to witness
the exhibition. The sun shone bright
ly and the temperature was to the
liking of players and spectators alike.
In the first round Rath reached
first on free transportation, and was
sacrificed to second, but neither Groh
nor Roush could deliver and he got
no farther. In their half the Sox did
a little better. Liebold, the first man
up, waited for four wide oues, took
second on an infield out and reached
third on Weaver's single, which was
checked but not captured by Eller.
The partisan local crowd called long
and loud for a' run, but Jackson, de
spite a new set of "lucky"' hairpins,
went out on a pop fly to Groh and
Felsch flew out to left.
In the second and third, the crowd
was treated to the remarkable exhi
bition in which Gandil, Risberg,
Schalk, Williams, Liebold and Ed
Collins struck out. In the Reds' haif
of the second Duncan and Neale
fanned and Kopf interposed a foul out
to Schalk, and in the third the Reds
did but little better, going out in ro
tation on infield hits. In the fourth,
after Daubert and Groh had flied out
to Felsch, Roush was safe on Ris
berg's juggle and stole second, but
Duncan left him there with a fly to
Jackson. In the fifth Kopf singled
but was forced a moment later by
Neale, who himself was caught steal
ing, while Rariden flied out to center.
In their half, with two down, Schalk
singled, but Williams whiffed and
again the Sox failed to threaten. y
Eller Hits Two Bagger.
. Nothing could have appeared less
suspicious than Eller when he came
to the plate at the beginning of ibe
sixth round.' As a pitcher, nothing
was expected of him, and among
those in this frame of mind was
Claude, alias "Lefty" Williams. Even
the organization of Red fanatics, who
brought a brass band up here, were
not looking for what happened and
started out of their seats when Eller
connected with one in the groove and
it started off due north. Jackson,
whose mind appeared to be puzzling
over the jinx that had settled on Ms;
hairpins, was slow in starting for ;
it, and Felsch, who was sparking onj
all ' six cylinders, was too far away. ;
The net result was a double, which,
surprised none more than El!er. The
ball was wearying. of its roll when
Jackson and Felsch came up to it at
the left field fence. Felsch seized it
and hove in the general direction of
the diamond, dimly visible in the dis
tance. Eller took a chance and land
ed safely on third. The Sox infield, j
scenting troubv, crew in. Rath poled
one to short left, whlth would have'
been safe no matter where the infield1
played, and Eller trotted home with
the first run. Ratb was advanced to
second by Daubert's perfect bunt to
ward third, although Daubert was
out at first. Droll's patience was re
warded by a pass, at which stage of
the proceedings Schalk and Williams
addressed a peppery collection of re
marks to Rigler to the effect that
the umpire was not calling strikes
when Wiliams cut the corners. It
was the forerunner of Schalk's im
pending expulsion.
Roush Hits.
Roush, who had but one hit to his
credit to date in the series, declared
himself in on the onslaught at this
juncture and recorded his seeond hit
in left center, a triple, and Rath and
Groh counted. The play at the plate
was close on Groh and it waa here

tary led to his banishments It wasJ

in a world's series that a player was
ever expelled. .FranW Chance, the
old Cub leader, was said to have been
the first. Lynn took up the. work
behind the plate and Duncan flied to
Jackson. It was a. pretty, catch by
Jackson, but his. throw to, the. plate
was a little wide.. Lynn got the ball
but Roush crossed the plate. Will
iams steadied wonderfully in the sev
enth and eighth, retiring the side in
rotation. He was taken out in the
Sox half of tno eighth to allow Mur
phy to bat and Mayer succeeded him
as pitcher.'
The final run of the game was made
off Mayer, a former National league
twirler. He sent one to Roush, which
the' Reds outfielder tapped toward
Ed Collins, v The Chicago captain
fumbled the ball and Roush was given
a life. Mayer was unsteady and Dun
can drew a free ticket to first. Kopf
came along with a perfect bunt to

retired at first Roush reached third.
Neale grounded to Risberg and on

Ed Collins retired the side by throw

There were two down in the ninth
when Weaver poled a triple to far

thing to Eller. who at this point faced

Jackson swung mightily, but dribbled
one to Groh, who threw him out at

From beginning to end every process in the manufacture of
Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid is carried out by The Paraffine Com
panies, Inc. Certain plants are devoted to collecting raw mate-
rials. Rags, which are the basis of the felt, are assembled and
cleaned and made into the strong felt. Crude oil is refined to pro
duce the exact quality of asphalt necessary for bes results. The
felt is saturated withhe water-proofing asphalt and is coated with
a special compound to give it an extremely long life, all under the
constant supervision of experts. From first to last the greatest
care is exercised in the complicated processes. Samples' of every
run of roofing are subjected to various tests to see that every roll
of Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid comes up to the high standard which
has been set. This constant inspection and precision of manu
facture make certain that the finished Ru-ber-oid or Malthoid
is the best ready roofing that it is possible to produce.
Its World-wide Use
Everybody on Vne Pacific Coast who knows anything about building con
struction knows that Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid Roofings are pre-eminently
the ready roofings of highest quality. In foreign countries, too, from Alaska
to Australia, from Siberia to Peru, Rurber-cid and Malthoid have become
the standard. Their world-wide use is a guarantee of their dependability.
' The Dependable Product of a Dependable Company
The responsibility of The Paraffine Companies does not end with the
production of Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid. Representatives are always at the
service of any purchaser to advise and to answer any questions which may
arise as to the application of roofing. Its service extends to the small farmer
who buys one or two rolls of roofing, as well as to the jobbers, dealers and
big industrial corporations.
From the raw material to their final application The Paraffine Companies,

NEW YORK, Oct. 6. Developments
over the week end and those which
followed contributed measurably to
the expansive trading and many sub
stantial gains registered la. the course
of today's active stock market.
Reassuring advices rega--ng Presi
dent Wilson's condition, settlement of
the British railroad strike and reports
from the principal steel centers were
viewed with favor by professional in
terests and others committed to the
Ions account.
The one discordant note was sound
ed by the finance market, call loans
advancing from the opening rate of 6
per cent to 12 per cent in the last
hour, and falling back again before
belated requirements had been met.
Motors and oils of the lush priced
varieties featured the session. Equip
ments were led by Worthington Pump
at 13 points gain. Crucible Steel as
Biimed some of its recent prominence
bv a further recovery of 13 points,"
half of which was later forfeited.
Sails and shippings strengthened
on the demand for transcontinental!,
grangers and coalers. Leathers, tex
tiles, tobacco and food shares offered
better resistance to pressure.
Sales amounted to 1,300,000 shares.
Bo-ds were firm, the Liberty divi

CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 6. Predictions of a

bullish effect of tie settlement of the
British railway strike. Prices closed

$1.24 and May $1.22 to $1.22. Oats
closed unchanged to cxdown. In
provisions there -were net gains vary
ing from 32c to $1.45.
It was not until after mid-day that
the bulls lost their advantage In the
corn market. Before that they show
ed great tenaedty, and put chief
stress on the beneficial results to be
looked for from the strike settlement
in Great Britain. , Higher quotations
on hogs counted as a strengthening
factor, and so likewise did the heavy
rains of Saturday and Sunday. To
ward the last, however, selling broad

that overbidding of Chicago in the

Damage Claims
Against Mexico to

WASHINGTON. Oct. 0. Damage
claims against the Carranza govern

more than $25,000,000, the senate

Carranza to install an efficiency sys
tem for his administration.
Lill was doubtful if claims present
ed for damages incurred during the

since Huerta never was recognized

hama all the great ports of the world are they
Only places on the map to you or are they ports
where you've gone sailing in from the high seas with
every eye along the shore turned admiringly on your
big ship your ship !
Are the great world ports nothing to you but little
red spots in your, school geography, or are they real
towns whose funny streets you've walked whose
strange sights you've seen whose magnificence you've
. admired towns in which you've greeted the world's
' tailor men from the Seven Seas?
Make each port you visit mean another big experi
ence. Curious spots, beautiful spots, ugly spots,
' famous spots, and every one of them more interesting
to see than anything you ever read about in all your
life. Every ocean has a United States fchip sailing for
tome port worth seeing.
If you've any call in you for a full life join, and
color all your years ahead with memories of things
worth seeing with knowledge worth having with
an inexhaustible fund of sea tales and adventureo
picked up ashore and afloat that will make you a
welcome man in any company.
Compare such a personality with that of men who
are content to just stick around all their days and
see nothing. Boy!
Work? sure, andja man's work it is, among men.
' , Play? well, rather, with a bunch of men who know
how to play. These comrades of yours' carry in
their ears the sounds of great world cities, pf boom
ingjjuns, of swashing seas sounds you will snare with
them and that will never die away.
And when you come home, you'll face life ashore
with level eyes for Uncle Sam trains in self-reliance
as well as self-respect. The Navy builds straight men
no mollycoddles. .
Enlist for two years. Excellent opportunities for advancement. Four weeks holidays with pay each year.
Shore leave to see inland sights at ports visited. Men always learning. Good food and first uniform outfit
free. Pay begins the day you enlist. Get full information from your nearest recruiting station. If you do
nor know where the nearest recruiting station is, ask your postmaster. He knows.

Order a Case for Your Home
A speech against the League of Na
tions delivered by Maj. janies R. Page
of Missouri, who spoke in place of
Senator Reod, was heard last night by
an audience that filled tJie Grand
I theatre. Major Page speaks under the
auspices oi' the League for the pre
servation of American Independence
of which Henry' Watterson is presi
dent. The purpose of this league is given
as to establish "Freedom to defend a
right; freedom to refuse to fight;
! freedom to mind cur own business."
j Major Page's talk did not take the
t form of a violent tirade against tne
' League of Nations. He made it a
point to take up the articles of the
league one by one and to point out
the provisions with which they would
bind the pnited States, and to let the
audience draw its own conclusions. He
spent two years' in the army during
the war, eight months of which he
was overseas. , i
The speaker was introduced by E.
J. Flanigan, who said in part:
"We have before us for discussion
and for pur eni:aatnnt the most mo
mentous problem that has ever de
volved upon us as American citizens
to solve. We know that as patriotic
citizens it is for us to determine
whether the president is right or
wrong; whether 'the proposed league
should be affirmed or denied. We
have with us tonight a representative
of the negative side of that question
who is well qualified to present these
issues."
Saw Service
Major Page said in part:
"I am not a war hero but have spent
eight months on the other side and
have seen our boys lying mangled in
No Man's land. You who stayed at
home and made many sacririces for
that boy did so because you could no:
be there. But you did it for the sake
of America and for humanity at large.
If anyone had told you that you were
doing this that we might have a league
of nations what would you have said
"Those of you who- have read the
league raise your hands," requested
the speaker. Very few in the 'audi
ence were able to comply.
"All you know about it is what some
one has ' told ou," continued the
major. "You have been told that it
would prevent war. I would be for it
too, if I believed that. Show me any
thing that will prevent war or that
looks, like it will and I will be with
you.
"Why is it that, those who say you
should be for the league never tell
you what is in it? Has anyone ever
told you what it was framed for, ex
cept that it Vould prevent war?
No Alliances
"I declare that the United States is
the greatest nation in all the world.
Why? Is it because for the last 100
years we have had entangling al
liances with other nations?
("Because we have minded our own
business," someone in the audience
replied.)
"Then why should be change the
plan, and supplant that which has
caused us to become this, with the
league. Why should we accept this
new. scheme?"
"What thing has made Is great?
The constitution is the foundation of
our greatness."
Here Major Page read the preamble
to the constitution . of the United
States, comparing its purpose as given
for the promotion of American inter
ests with the purpose as given in the
preamble to the league of nations
which reads as follows:
Reads Preamble
"The high contracting parties, in or
der to promote international co-operation,
and to achieve international
peace and security r-"
"What doe sit mean to 'promote in
ternational co-operation'," continued
the major. "Does it mean interna
tional trade? Does it mean interna
tional finance or immigration? I can't
tell you and I don't know of anyone
who can."
The major then pointed out that
the proposed league was in effect an
amendment to the constitution of the
United States.
"You women," he said, "obtained
your right to vote through an amend-

ment to the constitution but it was
amended in the manner that is pro
vided for within itself, not by four
men sitting in the Hotel de Crillon in
gay Paris.
"I challenge anyone to deny that if
you can amend any part of the con
stitution by a league or nations you
can amend any other part or abolish
the whole."
Major Page then proceeded with a
discussion of the various articles of
the constitution pointing out what he
considered to be the defects in each.
Major Page pointed out that of 32
nations who would be In the proposed
league, 15 are of the colored racet two
of the yellow and 15 white. This
means that there are 811,425,500 peo
ple of colored races represented as
against 289,428,000 people of the white
race. Such small nations of the col
ored race as Liberia, Haiti, Hedjaa
and Siam, have equal voting power
with the United States.
