UNDATED WAR LEAD, (By
the Associated Press) The terms
on which Germany may have
peace have been delivered. The
element of softness is absent from
them. Like the peace given Austria-Hungary,
Turkey, and Bul
garia the price Germany will have
to pay is virtually the price of
absolute surrender.
The claws of the great military
machine of Germany are to be
drawn; invaded territory must b 1
evacuated and compensation must j
be made for all damage done to
the civilian populations in attacks
by land and sea and from th; air.
Impotency by Germany again to
take the field is to be insisted
on.
Meanwhile the German armicj in
Belgium and France are being defeat
ed. Nowhere are they able to stay
the attacks of the allied forces.
Ground is given over wide area in
Belg'1121 and France from the Belgian
border to east of the Meuse river.
Tiie British and Belgian in Flan
ders have dug deeply into enemy held
territory and the enemy is reeling un
der the assaults. From Valenciennes
to the Aisn-3 the British and French
are driving, the enemy in what seems
utter disorder backward toward his
the other strokes, however, ij that
of the Americans and French in the
Meuse river region north and north
west of Verdun wheie fast strides
are being made northward over a wide
front which threatens to cut cff the
enemy's retreat and bring about a de
feat of the Germans on fie battle
field.
From Belgium to the Meus) the
Germans are in jeopardy. Especial
ly critical is the situation for them in
the great sack from Belgium to the
north of Rheims, for with the advance
of the Americans and French north
ward and with the important lines of
communication under fire it seems
probable that large numbers of tuein
are destined to be cut off and forced
to surrender.
Likewise the crossing of the Meuse
river by the Americans places in peril
the large enemy forces in Lorraine
south of the Metz. There ara indica
tions that operations with a view to
overwhelming the enemy in this re
gion are in the making. The German
official communication of Tuesday an
nounced that the Americans made
"partial thrusts west of the Moselle
river which runs through Met.
Large numbers of towns have been
reclaimed by the allied troops through
out the entire fighting zone, many
thousands of . Germans have been
made prisoner and large numbers of
guns and enormous quantities of
stores have been captured. Ia addi
tion the enemy has suffered terrible
losses in men killed or wounded.
Judging the situation from the mili
tary map. the crisis on the battle field
Is at hand. The Germans have come
to the realization that the Foch mili
tary machine is tile master "of the
German machine. Therefore, they are
giving ground everywhere before it
seeking their border line in order to
prevent being crushed.

WITH THE FRENC HARMY IN
FRANCE, Nov. 5, (By the Associated

the region of the Oise with the loss of,
4000 men made prisoner and 60 can
non captured, the Germans began a
general retreat over entire front or
the first army this morning. General
Deber.ey's men entered Guise at 6:30
o'clock and pushed on six miles furth

rear guard.
HUN ARTILLERY REACTS
WITH THE GRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Nov. S, (By the Associated
Press, 11 p. m.) The German artil
lery began a strong reaction upon, the
French positions southwest of the
Eoly-Seraincourt road at 3 o'clock this
afternoon and tonight it continued
very active along the Aisne between
Rethel and Attigny.
WITH THE FRENCH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Nov. 6, 2:30 p. m., (By the
Associated Press.) The Franco
American operations west of the
Meuse since November 1 have shaken
the pivot upon which the entire Ger
man retreat turns. The Germans are
still making a stout resistance with
out modifying the salient feature of
the situation which is that their arm
ies west of thejMeuBe are practically
cut off from direct communication
with Metz. The main reliance of the
Germans now is on the line of the
Meuse, which they appear determined
to defend while west of the river their
principal resistance Is along the Ard
nenes canal. French troops have
reached this obstacle from Rllry-Aux-Oies,
at the bend of the Aisne to the
river Bar. Here they have encounter
ed sustained artillery machine gun
and musketry fire.
The Germans are still holding along
the Aisne between Rethel and Chateau
Porclen. while further west Indica
tions of a retreat were noticed last
evening. The French in pursuit main
tained contact with the enemy's rear
guards, and this morning reached Her
py and. the region east of Recouvrance
and Bannogne. as well as height 98,
southeast of Montlgny Le Sourt.
East of the Olse river, French
troops, on the heels of the retreat

WILSON S PLANS
SAYSCMNCEAU
Amid Wild Cheers Aged Pre
mier Reads Terms of Aus-tola-Hungary's
Armistice to
Deputies
PARIS, Nov. 5. M. Clemenceau,
the premier, was accorded a wonderful
ovation in. the chamber of deputies to
day as he read to the deputies the
terms of the armistice with Austria
Hungary. He also said terms had
been submitted to Germany.
"The terms to Germany," said the
premier, "are what President Wilson
himself recommended to us for the se
curity of our troops, the maintenance
of our military superiority and the dis
armament of the enemy, inso far as
that it is necessary to prevent a re
sumption of hostilities."
M. Clemenceau declared that peace
might not be so near as some might
think but that he could, however, as
sure the chamber that. "the fate of the
peoples henceforth was fixed." There
was prolonged cheering when the pre
mier announced that the allies had ob
tained the use of all means of trans
port in Austria-Hungaria.
M. Clemenceau Mas bailed; as the
"father of victory as he mounted the
tribune to announce the terms of Xfle
Austrian armistice. The deputies all
stood. The ovation lasted several
minutes.
During an address following read
ing of the armistice terms there was
Intermittent cheering especially when
the premier spoke of the approach of
full victory, the defeat of Austria
Hungary and the complete glory of
France. The .usual socialist interrup
tions occurred, but the aged premier
remained unperturbed defiantly
smothering the taunts of the opposi
tion. The chamber passed a resolu
tion providing that the speech of M.
Clemenceau should be posted through
out France.
"What I have done," said M. Clem
enceau, "it is France that has done
it I have only made the best use I
could of the instruments France has
given me. The superior council at
Versailles has drawn up the terms of
an armistice with Germany. These
were sent yesterday o President vVil
son, who, if he approves them, will
make them known to the imperial and
democratic government."
At this point the house burst into
laughter.
"It will .then be time enough for
Germany to address herself to Foch,"
the premier added.
It was here that the premier de
clared that the terms to Germany
were Inspired, as were those imposed
upon Austria, to prevent a resump
tion of hostilities in case Germany
should break her word.

(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Nov. 5. Mar
shal Foch has the terms of armis
tice for Germany and awaits ap
plication for them by the German
military command in the field.
The government at Berlin is so
informed in a note which Secre
tary Lansing handed to Minister
Sulzer of Switzerland tonight,
announcing that the allies have
declared their willingness to make t
peace on the cables.- In 24 hours'
it should be in tbe hands of tho
Germans; in 4S hours the world
may know whether an immediate
end of the war is at hand.
Publication of details of the armis
tice terms still is withheld. Thoy may
not be made known until tho Germans
have accepted or rejected them as
was the course' followed by the allies
in dealing with Bulgaria, Turkey and
Austria. Only the details are in doubt,
however, and no one questions that
acceptance means abject surrender.
The statement has been authorized
that the drastic conditions under
which Austria passed out of the "war
have been followed closely, and in
answer to queries for further informa
tion officials said tonight the state
ment of Premier Clemenceau. cablod
from Paris by the Associated Prcjs,
told the story.
"The terms," said M. Clemenceau.
"are what President Wilson himself
recommended us for the security of
our troops, the maintenance of our su
periority and the disarmament oi tne
enemy insofar as that is necessary to
prevent a resumption of, hostilities."
Secretary Lansing's note gives the
first hint of what has been going on
at the momentous conference at Paris
between Colonel House and the allied
premiers.
It quotes a "memorandum of obser
vations" by the allied governments on
the president's correspondence with
the German authorities disclosing the
nnnrnval of the president's peace pro
gram, with reservation of freedom of
action in the peace conference on me
moot question of freedom of the seas
nni a anprific statement that by re
storation is meant that Germany must
make compensation for all damage
done to civilian population and their
property "by land, by sea and from
the air."
This last in which President Wilson
nnriira. means German payment for
towns and cities destroyed and coun
try side devastated. Tor snips suns Dy
submarines and raiders.
It means German payment of dam
mrpi to the families and dependents
of civilians killed or carried off in
violation of the rules of war.
Tliua much of the real work of a
peace conference has been done in
advance. The spokesmen of Germany
hivo accented the Dresident's terms;
now they must accept the allied quali
fications if they want to stop tne aa
vance of the allied and American
armies. The guarantee that final peace
conditions will be dictateu unaer in
terpretation of principles by the vic
tor, without undue areument by the
vanquished is provided in the armis
tice terms.
in nlnrine the matter of. an armis
tice in Marshal Fochs hands and at
the same time informing the Germans
President Wilson, the Associ
ated nations have strlctlv observed
the diplomatic amenities while main
taining the purpose to make tne
armlaticA a nnrelv military measure
which should afford no possibility of a
misunderstanding or tne ract tnat it is
offered to a defeated army.

(By Review Leased Wire
NEW YORK. Nov. 5 At midnight
the congressional election returns
were a little more than half in, and
on tht figures then at band, shewed
again of eight seats in the house and
at least three in tbe senate for tbe
republicans.
Up to that hour Acting Chairman
Cummings of the democratic national
committee has issued a statement
claiming democratic gains in both
houses of congress.
Chairman Hays of the republican
national committee had nut issued a
statement, but said he felt sure the
republicans would control the bouse.
The turnovers came in New York,
Kentncky, Illinois. Pennsylvania. Kan
sas and Maryland, but so closely was
a democratic defeat in one district
neutralized by a republican defeat in
another that the net results were very
close.
The democratic leaders in congress.
Senator Simmons of North Carolina
and Representative Kilchin of North
Carolina were re-elected as were the
house republican leader. Representa
tiv Mann, of Illinois, and the acting
I republican leader. Representative
Gillette of , Massachusetts. Former
Speaker Carmon of Illinois was re
elected to what will be his 22nd term
in congress, a record of Service inter
rupted by only two defeats.'
Meyer London, the only socialist in
tbe house, was defeated by Henry M.
Goldfogle. a democrat runnning with
republican support, buf the socialists
retained representation by electing
Victor Berber from Wisconsin, a for-
mer member of the house, now under
j Indictment under charges of violating
4 the espionage law. Other socialist
candidates were defeated, among
! them Morris Hillqult. candidate for
mayor of New York a year ago.
The only complete governorship re
turns at hand at midnight showed tbe
republican tickets elected in Pennsyl
vania and Connecticut and Governor
Whitman of New York coming down
state with a heavy plurality which
promised to wipe out the advantage
of Alfred E. Smith, the democratic
candidate in Greater New York.
Senator Thompson of Kansas, dem

Capper, republican; Senator Lewis of
Illinois had been beaten bv ReDresen-

been beaten by former Senator Bell,
republican.
The re-election of Senator Weeks,

Austria's Elimination Is
Expected to Stop Shipment
Of Fuel Oil to Germany
(By Rpvlew Lessea Wire)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 5. One
effect of the elimination of Aus
tria from the war. the fuel ad
ministration announced tonight,
will be the cutting off of Ger
many's supplies of fuel oil and
gasoline.
Germany has been obtaining
fuel and gasoline from Galatla
and Rumania and was planning to
import extensively from the Cau
casus the announcement said, but
under the tortus of the Austrian
armistice, all traffic between Ger
many and her former ally must
stop.
Within the Germany borders
there are no supplies of fuel oil
and information possessed by the
fuel administration is that Oer$
many has been using benzol a
derivative of coal tar for lubri
cating oil. This latter source, it
was said, will not supply German
needs.
MAYOR ERICKSON
PROCLAIMS NEED
FOR WAR FUNDS
(Continued from Page On)
mayor declares the organizations have
accepted and discharged their trust in
the building of morale in a manner
which has commended admiration of
the world. He declares that it is a
privilege to give to a cause so worthy,
and finally he appeals to pastors to
read the proclamation from their pul
pits, to teachers to acquaint the chil
dren with the drive and engender in
them enthusiasm, and to presiding of
ficers at other public assemblages to
lend their assistance in every way pos
sible. .
The proclamation follows:
"It has come about that the people
of the United States find themselves
compelled to take arms against the foe
that threatens the liberties of the peo
ples of the world; the lives of women
and children, particularly, and of all
free men. To help establish a free
dom from this oppression that the
world demands, it is necessary' that
millions of the best young manhood
and young -womanhood of America
must go overseas and separate them
selves from their accustomed voca
tions and domestic influences. This
naturally means a mental and spirit
ual hunger for those ties of family so
ciety and church that are dear to the
hearts and close to the deepest feel
ings of every American. To supply
this void in the lives of our millions
of soldiers, the United States govern
ment has authorized these seven or
ganizations to look after the welfare
of the men in the service:
"Young Men's Christian associa
tion. "i'oung. Women's Christian associa
tion. "National Catholic War Council.
Knights of Columbus.
"Jewish Welfare Board.
"War Camp Community Service.
"American Library association.
"Salvation Army.
"These seven organizations have ac
cepted and discharged this trust in a
manner that has commanded the ad
miration of the world, and the eternal
gratitude of every man under the ser
vice of the flag.
"And, whereas, the privilege of giv
ing moral and financial support to this
wonderful work, so -clearly interwoven
with the lives of the men in service,
has been given not to an institutional
government, but to every individual
man, woman and child in the United
States.
"Now, therefore, I. Jacob Erickson,
mayor of the city of Bisbee, do hereby
proclaim to the .citizens of the city of
Bisbee that, during the week begin
ning Sunday, November the tenth.
1918, they bestow attention, lend ef
fort and strength, and give liberally
to the fullest extent of their means,
to the appeal for funds that shall be
made by the united war work cam
paign for $l70.rm,ono, to 'carry on'
this wonderful work so auspiciously
bei;un. During the next year, which
is. undoubtedly to be the most critical
year in the war, our men in service
must, experience no interruption cr
modification of the extent to which
that morale-making work has entered
into their lives and brouglA happiness
and courage. To see that this does
not happen is the part of those of us
whom our boys have left at home.
"And, I further request that this
proclamation shall be read aloud from
every pulpit in the city of Bisbee on
Sunday, November tenth, 1913, and on
the following day in every school and
public assemblage, that the children
also, to the extPnt of their interest
and effort. Join in this vital work of
the war.
"Signed by me at Bisbee, Arizona,
on the fifth day of November, 1918.

"Mayor of the City of Bisbee."

I'HOKNIX. Ariz., Nov. 5. There
was a light vote in Arizona today.
Hardly more than half the registered

den spread of influenza in this city
within the last two days kept many
of the voters, especially the women,
at home. Complete returns have been
received from only one rural pre
cinct: Campbell, republican. 48; Col
ter, democrat, 4", for governor. The
precinct is democratic. So far as the
count haa proceeded in other pre
cincts, Campbell is leading.
Colter Claims Election
In a telephone message to John
Twomey, early this morning, Fred T.
Colter, democratic candidate for gov
ernor, said he was confident he had
been elected over Tom Campbell. Col
ter's figures quoted to Twomey show
ed that he claimed to have carried Ya
vapai county by 300, Graham by 400,
Greenlee by 500, Pinal by 175, Yuma
by 300. Santa Cruz by 150 and Cochise
by 1000. He gave Campbell Pima by
600, Mavajo by 200 ana Maricopa by
between 1200 and 1500. He estimated
his majoritny at from 2500 to 3000.
However, figures from all parts of the
state are coming in so slowly that
Colter's confidence apparently is
based more largely on belief than actuality.
HUN MUST SEE
FOCH FOR TERMS
(Continued from rage on)
that the German high command has
been desperately anbtious to avoid ad
misison of the complete defeat of the
Carman arms, hoping instead to make
it appear when the inevitable collapse
came that the army was still in being,
formidable and able to fight on in
definitely, and that it ceased the
struggle, not at the demand of its en
emies on the front, but solely because
of orders to do so from the civil gov
ernment now at least nominally In
control.
For this reason the Americaa and
allied leaders determined that to con
vince the German people themselves
that their idolized and feared military
machine had been crushed, the mili
tary leaders must be forced to capitu
late on the field or battle.
The important reservation by the
allies as to the freedom of the seas
is said here to be due largely to a de
sire to avoid a later protest of decep
tion. - Alsaca Lorraine is not mentioned
in the allied memorancum. The en
tente governments know, however,
and it is assumed that the Germans
understand, that by "righting the
wrong" done to France, President
Wilson meant iu the term accepted
by Germany, the return of the aX
provinces to France.

LANSING SENDS MESSAGE.
iHv Review Leased Vtr
WASHINGTON. Nov. 5. Marshal
Foch has been authorized by the
United States and the allies to re-
! ceive representatives of the German
j government and to communicate to
them the terms of an armistice.
The German government is so in
formed in a note handed to the Swiss
minister here today by Secretary
Lansing.
Tn text orsecretary Lansing's note
follows:
"I have the honor to request you to
transmit the following communication
to the German government:
"'In my note of October 23. 1918.
I advised you that the president had
; transmitted his correspondence with
i the German authorities to the govern
enti with which the government of
the United States is associated as
a belligerent, with the suggestion that
if those governments were disposed
to accept peace upon the terms and
principles indicated, their military ad
visers and the military advisers of
the United States be asked to submit
to the governments associated against
Germany the necessary terms of such
an armistica as would fully protect
the interests of the peoples involved
and insure to the associated govern
ments the unrestricted power to safe
guard and enforce the details of the
peace to which the government had
agreed, provided they deem such an
armistice possible from the military
point of view.
" 'The president is now In receipt
of a memorandum of observations by
i the allied governments on this cor
respondence, which Is as follows:
" 'The allied governments have
Riven careful consideration to the
correspondence which has passed be
tween the president of the United
States and the German government.
Subject to the qualifications which
follow they declare their willingness
to make peace with the government
of Germany on the terms of peace laid
down in the president's address to
congress of January 8, 191S, and the
principles of settlement enunciated in
this subsequent address. They must
point out, however, that Clause 2, re
lating to what is usually described as
'the freedom of tho seas. Is open to

therefore, reserve to themselves com

they enter the peace conference.
" 'Further, in the conditions of

congress of January 8, 191S, the presi
dent declared that invaded territories
must b; restored as wel as evacuated
and freed, the allied governments
leel that no doubt ought to be allowed

many for all damage done to- the

Germany by land, by sea and from

"I am instructed by the president
to, say that lie is in agreement with
the interpretation set forth in the last
tarairaph of the memorandum above
qucted. I am further instructed by
the president to request you to notify
the German government that Marshal
Foch has been authorized by the gov

'Tis not in mortals to command success, "
But we'll do more, Sempronious,
We'll deserve It.
CATO.
Thus emereth the fifth week of the local
quarantine for the influenza epidemic. It
is a stubborn, as well as a deadly scourge,
and has been relentless in its siege of every
community upon which it has made an at
tack. But the peak has been passed here,
and conditions are reported as much better
all over the state, even in the north, where
the disease was at its worst. Boards of
health in the west have generally been
slow to lift the quarantine. In the east
where the disease was many times worse
than in the west, quarantine was lifted
promptly with the passing of the peak. Far
be it from this column to try to even argue
with any board of health, much less tell
these learned medical gentlemen what to
do, but to a man up a tree ; to a spokesman
for a community closed and dull, it would
urge the lifting of the ban and the lower
ing of the bars as soon as may be. This
quarantine is a most severe hardship upon
many business men and people of the com
munity. Its usefulness has been served.
Some announcement should surely be
made soon, as to the date of its suspension.
The grippe and the pneumonia we have
with us all winter long, and have always
had these twin plagues. But when the
sickness passes the epidemic stage, a quar
antine is little short of tyranny.
Italy
No one who has not read of Italy's strug
gles fir freedom from the Austrian yoke,
off and on, for thepast 80-years or so, can
fully appreciate Italy's joy and pride and
deep thanksgiving this day. For years ani
years her ancient and beautiful and famous
cities along the rivers and on the Lombardy
plains were garrisoned by Austrian troops
and oppressed by Austrian rule. Venice,
Florence, Verona, Padua and even Milan
were at the mercy of the hated whitecoats,
as the Austrian troops were designated by
the Italian patriots of those days. And the '
redshirts, which is to say, the vinedressers
and tinkers and princes and peasants andf
singers and poets of that fair land, fought"
often against odds and died by the thou
sands under Garibaldi and others for free
dom. They won back a part, but never all.
Italian blood and Italian land were held by
Austria until yesterday. And Italian spriit
and pride could never be satisfied entirely
until the house of Hapsburg fell. This col
umn has never been able to get excited
over the fighting qualities of the Italians
in this, or any war, since Rome fell and the
old legionaries exchanged their short
swords and short tunics for the shroud and
the ton.b. But at that, Italy has been a
tower of help to the allied cause ever sincc
the flaming voices of her poets and her
peasants and her princes brought her in'o
the war. She has been through dark day3.
Her coal and munition supplies failed. She
was defeated by treachery after a year of
toil and s-acrifice in taking mountain fast
nesses. But, sustained by some lingering
flashes of that spirit of old Rome, she came
back in morale and held the line of the
Piave and sustained the worst that Aus
tria could do last summer, and then, when
Foch gave the word, she struck right home "
at the Austrian forces like the lightning
blast and gained the quickest and most .
spectacular victory of , the entire war.
It is true that she had only Austrian
troops to beat, but, with the collapse of
Russia she was the sole allied dependence
outside of the western battle front. She
had suffered much and sacrificed in the
war, but' great has been her reward. Never
again will she have Austria to fear. Her
national spirit and unity of interest and
pride of achievement will bear her on to
a finer place than she has held among the
nations since the days of her ancient great
ness. Her loyalty and devotion to the al
lied cause will never be forgotten in the
great nations of England, France and
America. Consider; with Germany hum
bled, Russia in a state of chaos and Aus
tria dismembered. Italy passes from her
humble place a third-rate nation to be
first in southern and eastern Europe.
Henceforth she will be the good mother of
those old little states, Greece and Rumania
and Serbia and Montenegro, and those new
little states, Bohemia, Poland and the other
Slav commonwealths. Their vicious step
mothers, Russia and Austria and Germany,
will trouble them no more, nor shall they
be oppressed and torn and racked and en
slaved. Belgrade, Sofia and Buchrest, long
connected with St. Petersburg and Berlin
fcy a devil's wire of dissention and intrigue,
'will henceforth, let us hope, be bound to
. Italy by a silver cord of concord, peace and
happiness. Again has that old mother,
Rome, a fine part t5 play in European af
fairs. She has earned it with her treasure
and her blood. She has herself known the
tyrant's lash. Her big brothers. England,
America and France, will warrant fair play.
Long live Italy.
Friendships
And little King Karl, the young man
who only recently ascended to the ancient
Austrian throne, what of him? There is
no word of him in the surrender terms
His armies have been taken captive and his
domains divided into many separate states
What will he do with this brand new
crown? Wherever this little man is, he is
doubtless thinking of the old adage about
evil companions. He was the devil's dupe.
The stronger mind at Berlin ruled the
weaker mind , at Vienna. Karl talked
mighty fine when he ascended to the Haps
burg throne, but Wilhelm flattered him in
one breath and threatened him in the next,
as only a Hohenzollern can do, and he de
clared undying friendship and aljegiance to
the Prussian power. In the life of kings
as well as common men, friendships make
or break. The boy in school may be known
by his friendships. The young man in col
lege also. The business man and the la
borer, all are known by their intimacies
with other men. They are known by their
acts, their frame of mind, their path, their
, thoughts . and fancies. Always a man's
friendships and associations lift and help
and strengthen him, much or little along
his way, or they drag him down or hamper
or weaken him, much or little, in all his
work or play. Consider your friends and
your own life, and its success or failuresf
happiness or misery, and youwill know
how much of truth there is in this little
monograph.
The British Navy
The British navy made Waterloo pos
sible, and therefore kept Napoleon from
conquering England long years before the
fateful Belgium battle. But it had to fight
two terrible sea engagements, the one at
the Nile and the other at Trafalgar, before
its supremacy was 'assured. But in this
war the British Navy brought about Ger
many's defeat without it being necessary
to fight any real battle at sea. It's suprem
acy has never been questioned. In the Jut
land 7fight only a small part of the British
fleet was engaged, the German navy seek
ing safety- in flight before Admiral Jelli
coe's eager bulldogs of the sea could reach
the scene of the battle. From the first day
of the war up to this time, not a single
German keel, excepting a raider or two,
which were soon destroyed, hag appeared,
upon the seas. The British grand fleet ha3
more completely commanded the high seas
than .ever they were commanded before in
war between maritime powers. And in
spite of ihe German under sett boats, Brit
ish control 6f the seas for all purposes has
never even been imperiled. Who won the
war? An admiring world points to France
and her heroism in bearing the brunt for
the first two years. Ye3, France did bear
the brunt" and save the day, but Germany
would have taken Paris but for the British
fleet. Who won the war? Many think
that American men and material decided
it. Yes, but without the British fleet not
a man from America or a pound of food
could have been transported to France.
Who won the war? Many thoughtful per
sons believe that British valor and staying
qualities and bulldog pluck saved the day.
But without the British fleet to bridge the
channel, British valor would have rusted at
home awaiting the Hunnish invasion.
Doubt it not; the British fleet was the
mightiest factor in the winning'of the war.
For four long, terrible years Germany far
excelled all allied effort upon land, but
never for an hour of that period did she
even attempt to dispute, the allied posses
sion of the sea. And no greaf nation since
the world was made ever won a great war
with closed ports.

B. H. Hines, for a number of years
a prominent resident of Douglas, died
last week in San Francisco, according
to a letter received by friends here.
Mr. Hines was a victim of influenza,
followed by pneumonia and was only
sick a few days. About a year ago Mr.
and Mrs. Hines left Douglas for San
Francisco, where he took a position
on a transport as engineer. He had
been engaged in the automobile busi
ness bere. The funeral was held on
Friday and interment at San Fran
cisco.'
The grammar school grades at
Douglas opened this morning and as
the quarantine still on, the sessions
are held out of doors. Each teacher
has divided ber classes into groups
of eight or ten students and holds
brief sessions In the open. A portable
blackboard is used and the classes are
grouped around the campus and in the
parks. The plan was instigated in
order that the children will not get
so far behind the schedule of the
year's work that they can not make it
up and pass their grades at the close
of the school year. The brief session,
with the groups are for the teachers to
give necessary instructions in the
work, and to give the students plenty
of home work. One teacher said to
day, "this is not a very convenient
way to work but it is much better to
have it this way, than to try to cram
the children during the rest of the
year, or to teach on Saturdays and
have no vacations."

STATEMENTS have recently been made in the Warren District by Wm. R.
Cole, who operates for hire cars bet ween Lowell and Warren, to the effect
that "the Arizona Mutual Auto Insurance Company, Home Office, Phoenix,
Arizona, refused to pay a claim, namely, repairs to a Hudson car which was dam
aged by being driven over a steep emban kment while in the hands of a thief, Her
bert Caviness; that this Insurance Company is no good; that this Company has no
money, therefore caynot pay its claims, etc."
FOR THE INFORMATION OF THE PUBLIC: the Arizona Mutual Auto In
surance Company wishes to make the following statement: At the time the car was
damaged it was in the hands of Herbert Caviness who lost his life in the acci
dent. This Hudson car was covered by a fire and theft policy, issued by us to
Wm. R. Cole and the Bisbee Auto Company, through our Bisbee Agent, Mr.
Bruce Perley, this being a standard policy the same as is issued by all insurance
companies, and which does not protect the insured if the car is taken by an em
ployee cr any person or persons in the insured's household, whether during hours
of service or not.
OUR CLAIM AGENT, Mr. L. W. Sadler, went to Bisbee to investigate the loss
claimed by Mr. Cole, and after a careful examination, established the following
facts: That Herbert Caviness. who was driving the car at the timi of the accident,
was a trusted employee of Mr. Cole and had been living with Mr. Cole thirty
days prior to the accident, the drivers of his cars cashing in to the boj' at the end of
.their day 'a run. On the evening of the accident, Mr. Cole had sent the boy to in
form the driver of this car that he wanted the car. The boy, knowing this, took
the car when the driver left it to enter an eating house at Lowell, and started to
drive the car to Mr. Cole's home. He had only gone a short.distance when the ac
cident happened. Mr. Cole proceeded to have the car repaired, filing claim with
the Insurance Company for the cost of repairs, at the same time forwarding to the
Company a sworn affidavit, signed by the insured, to the effect that the car had
been stolen by Herbert Caviness. The Arizona Mutual Auto Insurance Com
pany was not liable; therefore, Mr. Sadler denied the claim.
THIS COMPANY also wishes to state th'at all of its policie ? issued to Mr. Cole
were cancelled by the Company and not by Mr. Cole. This Company carries the
complete auto insurance for the State of Arizona, City of Phoenix, City of Mesa,
the Roosevelt Irrigation Project, Pacific Gas & Electric Company of Phoenix, and
practically every large line in the State, and we are adjusting claims more
promptly than any company we know of; and, furthermore, we are always lib
eral in our settlements, and have never denied any claim that has come before us,
with the exception of the above.'

ALLIES PLAN TO
SAVE STARVING
E
FORMER
Conferees at Paris Decide
They Will Send All Neces-i
sary Supplies- to Those Who j
Surrendered j
(By Review Leased Wire) f j
WASHINGTON. Nov. 5. The :
allies and America are planning to J ,
co-operate in making available as j!
far as possible food and' other sup- j
plies necessary for the lives of the
demoralized civilian populations in !l
once enemy countries.
This became known tonisht through
the publication of a message from Col.
E. M. House at Tarls to President
AVIlson,- saying the suprerae war coun
cil at Versailles had a'toptea a reso
lution announcing their uesire to co
operate with Austria,. Bulgaria and
Turkey in furnishing tht necessities
of life for the suffering peoples of
those nations.
"At the conclusion of the meeting
of the supreme war council yester
day," said Colonel House's message to
the president concerning the armis
tice, terms, "I proposed a resolution
in the following sense and the same
was adopted: .
" 'The supreme war council in ses
sion at Versailles desires to co
operate with Austria, Turkey and
Bulgaria in the making available as
far as possible of food and other sup
plies necessary for the lives of the
civilian population of those coun
tries." . , .
This announcement is expected to
have a far-reaching effect in Germany,
where, from all accounts, the food
situation is only a little less serious
than it was tn the countries , until re
cently allied with Germany. Condi
tions are represented as particularly
serious in Austria-Hungary where food
riots have been frequent srnd where
there had been intense suffering not
alone from the want of food, but cloth
ing and other necessities.
Food Administrator Hoover, it was
said, tonight is working put new food
conservation plans to assure supplies
not only to the peoples of the na
tions that have been eliminated from
the war, but also the literated popu
lations oft Belgium and northern
France and even German? when that
country has accepted armistice terms
RHEUMATIC PAINS
Quickly Eased By Penetrating
Hamlin's Wizard Oil
A safe and harmless preparariotf
to relieve the pains of Rheumatism,
Sciatica, Lame Back and Lumbago is
Hamlin's Wizard Oil It penetrates
quickly, drives out soreness, and
limbers up stiff aching joints and
muscles.
You will find almost dally uses for
it in cases of sudden mishaps or ac
cidents such as sprains, bruises, cuts,
burns, bites and stings. Just as re
liable, too, for earache, toothache,
croup and colic
Get it from druggists for 30 cents.
If not satisfied return the bottle and
get your money back.
Ever constipated or have sick
headache? lust try Wizard Liver.
'Whips, pleasant little pink pills, 30.
cents. Guaranteed. !
no' iu the hands of Marshal Foch.
It is understood that the plan con
plnted by Mr. Hoover, but which the
president is not known to have ap
proved, provides for a rationing sys
tem similar to that, employed in Bel
gium by the commission for relief in
Belgium which was worked out on the
basis of the required number of
calories necessary for each indi
vidual. Supervision of this rationing, it was
said, would be in charge of represen
tatives of the allied and American
governments. All available food sup
plies in the central powers would first
be rationed, including the reserves, if
any. held for armies,-it was said.
A survey is now being made by the
food administration to determine the
world's food supply. Pending its
completion the new food conservation
plan for the America public is held
up. Officials of the food administra
tion are said to believe that investi
gation will disclose food supplies
.which have heretofore not been avail
able cwiag to dissension between the
Teutonic allies.
With Austria flefinitely out of the
war the opening of the Mediterranean
and the India route as well as the so
called short Australian route will re
lease vast' grain supplies and other
foodstuffs in that pan of the world.
Austrian merchant ships, it was said,
may be used to transport these sup
plies. The food program worked out by
the inter-allied food council, of which
lood Administrator Hoover is a mem
ber, calls upon America to ship to
th allies 17.500,000 tons of foodstuffs
the coming year. With the necessity
of assisting in feeding civilians of
middle Kurope it is roughly estimated
tTiat a minimum of 5.000,000 tons will
have to be added to that figure,
though the ending of the war neces
sarily wfll make possible increased
production throughout Europe nest
year.

V.'ith all of the larger precincts in
Cochise county incomplete as yet, the
entire democratic ticket, state and
county, except W. B. Fbnda will re
ceive Iargs majorities. Miss Elsie
Teles, republican, apparently will re
ceive a good majority.
Chief interest centers around the
gubernatorial contest, between Fred
T. Cclter, democrat" and Thomas E.
Campbell, republican. Or. the face of
returns complete to date. Colter has
a lead, but not a large one. The
county will be far closer, judging by
the figures from sixteen precincts
complete, out cf sixty, and partial re
turns from others, than had been an
ticipated Colter is leading Campbell in some
of the precincts of the Warren dis
trict, while Campbell leads others.
Warren also is giving Campbell a
lead. Lowell No. 3, which is com
plete, is given in the table, which ap
pears in another part of thfci issue.
Col'er carried this.
Telephone reports from Douglas
last night were to the effect that the
two candidates were running close.
Campbell was carrying the fourth
and fifth wards by heavy majorities,
while Colter was evening up the score
in some of the others.
The election of Jimmie McDonald
for sheriff appears certain, his major
ity growing heavily all over the coun
ty. Lorenzo Wright, republican can-

The local republican candidataj,

ONLY ONE CORN

Stop Corn Pains; See Corn Peel Off
It is just when a corn 'hurts that
you want to feel surest -about get
ting rid of it. Why take chances
of keeping the corn and having the
pain grow worse? You'll use "Gets-
Tb. Only P.Ut-0 W U 'C-U."
It' 'anyhow, sooner or later; might
as well use it sooner. Then you are
absolutely sure that the corn will
loosen from your toe so that you
can peel the whole thing off pain
lessly with your fingers, in one com
plete piece just like peeling a ba
nana. It takes a second or two to
apply "Gets-It." There's no fussing
or puttering. Corn-paing will van
ish that'll keep .you sweet while
the "Gets It" does the rest. 'Nothing
new for corns has been discovered
since "Gets-It" was born. Follow
the judgment of the millions; use
"Gets-It" and be sure to be corn
and pain free! You'll say it's magic.
- "Gets-It", the guaranteed, money
back corn-remover, the only sure
way, costs but a trifle at any drug
store. MTd by E. Lawrence & Co.,

MAY BE CALLED SOON
The following statement printed in
the Sunday Issue of the Phoenix Re
publican will be of interest to the
many citizens of the W arren "district
that recently sent in their applica
tions to join the -Motor Reserve corps
that is being organized at El Paso and
who have been anxiously awaiting the
call to go:
"Some of the men who recently en
listed in the Motor Reserve corps are
likely to be called this week, accord
ing to R. A. Kirk, who has been in
charge in Phoenix of the enrollment
headquarters.
" 'From all the information that I
was able to secure in El Paso, tiro
district headquarters.' said Mr. Kirk
last night, "I am led to believe that
the local men will be called soon,
probably part of them this week, and
the rest as fast as the examinations
are concluded. Five or six squaJs
have already left Kl Paso, each squad
numbering 35 men, and all bound di
rectly for France.
'"Tomorrow (Monday) will be the
last day the headquarters for enlist
ment will be maintained here," con
tinued Mr. Kirk, "though the enlist
ments will be received up to Novem
ber 14. After Monday applications
will be made direct to W. G. Roe,
Sheldon hotel. El Paso. The enlist
ments here have been away beyond
expectations, and highly creditable to
the city, and a large measure of the
credit is due to the local newspapers
for the loyal support and advertising
they gave the matter.' "
FOOD COUPON GONE
(By Review Leased Wire)
(LONDON, Nov. 5. London wait
ers have been added to the long list
of war profiteers and their medium
for gouging is the food coupon. Un
less one carefully watches his coupon
book he will lose enough of the preci
ous tickets at one meal to last him for
a week.
Most restaurant managements have
a rule that the waiter cannot remove
a meat coupon it must be done by
the cashier and. the coupons will not
be accepted if clipped by the custom
er. Very few cashiers take too many
coupons but they disappear during the
trip of -the waiters from the custom
er to the cashier.
The stolen coupons are used to ex
tract good tips from strangers who
have not been in town long enough to
get a coupon book. Meat is ordered by
the stranger, the coupons demanded. :
the lack of coupons explained and :
then comes a hint that it may be ar
ranged without the coupon. If the tip
is satisfactory, the meat is produced

Mrs. Emerich Tells of Activ
ities and Conditions on the
Fighting Fronts of Europe
Today
Mrs. R. S. Emerich for ten years in
Masopotamia with Dr. R. S. Emerich,
as missionaries for the American Con
gregational Board of Foreign Missions.
Their home in Mesopotamia was at
Mardin, just at the head of the Meso
potamian plain.
In 1915 she returned from Mesopo
tamia with her three children and has
since been one of the national speak
ers for the Armenian and Syrian relief
fund. Released by them for six months
to go on this special work, visited
Fiance in the interest of the Y. W. C.
A. to investigate and report on work
over there and has, since her return,
been engaged in speaking on behalf of
the united war work campaign.
So direct from the desolated land of
France Mrs. Emerich brings a mes
sage to the people of the Warren dis
trict. Her appreciative audience sat
spellbound listening eagerly to each
word as it fell from her lips, Monday
afternoon at the Y. V. C. A. Clearly
and to the point so that all could
understand who had the privilege of
being present.
Only one who has been there and
heard the big guns and witnesed with
their own eyes the misery and woe
can really understand and know what
suffering means," she says. "But they
never falter or swerve from the aim
in life; to win. For the first time
in the history of the world men and
women are working side by sjde,
shoulder to shoulder with men. In the
munition factories the burden resting
upon the shoulders of slender, unform
ed girls and aged women makes one
stop and wonder if the women of
America really know what the word
sacrifice means and if after all we
aren't just substituting instead of sac
rificing. Most of the hours out of
the 24 are put in hard work, laboring,
covered with grease and face ana
hands yellow from the picric acid.
With nothing to look forward to but
toil and suffering, figures bowed with
weariness, beauty gone, never to fill
the woman's place in life to be moth
ers. Life was very barren for these
women of France until the women
of America became interested in their
welfare. Now the Y "huts" Beem a
Mecca indeed. A place to rest body
and mind before going back into the
blackness of the factory. A new Inter
est in life, good cheer and clean
amusements have wrought -a great
change. The thought that women in
far off America are thinking of them
and suffering with them makes easier
the task of making ammunition for a
great army fighting in the trenches.
They are looking towards America to
save the world after four years of war
the time has about come for them to
turn their burden over to other, hands
that will not fail them.
Mrs. Emerich saw the Americans
leave for Chateau Thierry. "Never
have I seen such courage, such good
cheer as pervaded these lads. Some
never to return; but on they went
laughing and singing. With the little
white beds in the hospitals waiting to

be occupied. Nothing is more pitiful
than to ste an empty hospital and to
know that soon the sobs of the wound
ed will tail upon the still air. So out
they went, with the people of France
saying with white lips and hope dead,
"The Germans will take Paris today."
It eeniPd as though no human power
could stay them, too, and it .was no
j human power but the grace of God in
me torm of marines, those brave sol
diers that turned the tide of war.
After the battle was over and the
wounded had been brought in, a Red
Cross nurse b-nt over a boy who had
been shot to pieces and said "Do you
suffer much?" He looked up, with his
lips stiff from pain and said, "Don't
you know the marines don't suffer?"
Such a tine spirit as that is bound lo
win out in the end.
"There are not enough nurses in
France, and there is no service great
er. The few that are there must work
until their faces become gray with
weariness and the roost wonderful
thing about it is they will not ac
knowledge to doing one thing unusual.
When the boys are brought in from
the trenches wounded and dying they
feel as though they are doing very
little. The doctors too are worked day
and night and often drop from utter
weariness, only sorry that the flesh
is so weak that they cannot continue
on and on without sleep or rest.
Story after story was told to me,
pitiful cries from broken hearted wo
men. Children murdered, daughters
dishonored, a great many not repeat
able. It made- me realize more fully
just why our boys fought so valiantly,
that the women of America should be
savid from a like fate. For always the
boys are determined to go to Berlin.
Mrs. Emerich told one soldier that she
had to come to France to get some
wheat bread. He walked up to her
very menacingly and demanded an ex
planation. She told him because we
were conserving ' wheat in America
that they over there might have it. He
was completely mollified by this an
swer and said, "Gee, but we'll sure
fight for them."
An English lady of noble birth said
to Mrs. Emerich, "I fhlnk the women
of America are wonderful, they have
so much more than we have, advant
ages and the men put them on a pede
stal and worship them, but you must
be very careful that the pedestal does
not become a shelf, and all the battles
and events pass beneath without tak
ing part heart and soul." So we won't
dare to forget for one minute the
things that are being done there, the
suffering of the women steeped in the
yellow picric acid, and our boys in the
mud of the trenches. , We are not out
for money when we set out to raise
$170,000,000 but for the souls of men
and women," says Mrs. Emerich.

ELECTION DAY IS
VOTES CAST HERE
Election day pased off quietly. It
was the most peaceful election ever
held in the Warren district. People
representing the different candidates
were r.umerous, and vied with each
other in passing out cards and an
nouncements. They were good na
tured in their efforts and there were
no fights or trouble. Women work
ers were numerous in all of the wards
of the district. Douglas sent some
workers up to try and do some good
for the cause of the county seat re
moval, but they were offest by a;
heavy Tombstone contingent. A num
ber of Warren district citizens took a
hand in the matter and were -working
against the removal but voting
for Bisbee. The voters were late in
getting out and at the noon hour it
looked as though there would not be
50 per cent of the vote polled. Dur
ing the afternoon the voters came out
much more lively and over 60 per
cent of the registered vote was cast

ward 25S out of 5S9; in the third ward
408 out of 636; in the fourth ward
2S2 out of 409; in the fifth ward 468
out of 718; in the sixth ward 244 out
