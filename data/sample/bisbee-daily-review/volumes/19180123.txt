BURIED A BLOOD-RED HATCHET.
Just to give the iie to Senator Gumshoe Stone's
chart es of partisanship, the Kansas republicans, regulars
and progressives, three hundred strong, got together the
other day on Henry Allen for governor and buried the
bitterness of twelve years of civil strife in the needs
and demands of the war. A Kansas political writer, de
scribing the meeting, said in part:
Then came the most dramatic incident of Kansas
politics. Morton Albaugh for years leader of the "old
guard" of the republican regulars in the stateuok the
piatform and said:
"You all know my political relations of tie past I
have been the "regular in politics. Bat now .there is no
past. There is only i'nt one issue 'a Kansas -the w.r.
Kansas must do her part in the great conflict For that
we must Lave tie .-igbi kind of leadership. We all turn
to Henry Allen as that leader. Here I set aside all past
differences with any Kanean, and take my stand only for
the man and measures that will make Kansas the most
efficient in support of the war.
"I want every man here who will take this stand
with me. and who is for Henry Allen and will work for
him to stand aP-"t
Every person in the room stood up and cheered.
Just as every one expected. President Wilson has
rushed to tie defense of Secretary Baker. Too bad
Wilson's state papers and messages during this war
have been masterpieces. Not the bitterest partisan has
assailed the president ar his high ideals and motives
and his able efforts to carry on the war. But the weak
ness and incompetency of his subordinates have been too
apparent for them to escape both criticism and censure.
There has been less partisanship in all this than any one
dared to hope for at the beginning of the war. Great
statesmanship would readily see the justice and wisdom
of giving the great republican party a place In the war
cabinet and national councils. Baker's weakness has
been so marked, so glaring so pathetic, from the very
beginning, that the president's defense of his appointee,
confidant and friend merely weakens the executive with
out helping Baker in the least Out of all the warnings
and boastings; the optimism and pessimism with which
we have been flooded by orators and writers since
America entered the war, one thing is coming to be
pretty well believed and understood, and that is. that this
nation is far behind its promises and the expectations
and hopes of its allies and its friends so far as its war
schedule is concerned. The government's own optimism
and confidence in itself is the worst sign of alL There
is hope for a man who recognises his errors and his
weakness, but there is nc Lope at all for the blatant and
placid and egotistical and sardonic Baker, secretary of
war.
Out of the chaos and confusion and conflagration of
Austria comes a brand new name, worse than any that
have come before; worse than the Russian "skis" and
"vitches;" worse than the German atrocities. It is
"Toggenburg," and there is a von before it of course.
Count von Tog. looms up as a mediator of the strikes
and the demonstrations the workmen and socialists re
calling on the government The situation must be pretty
serious or Von Tog. would "not have emerged from the
former dense ohscuri'y carrying this name as a handicap-
That Gumshoe Bill Stone of all men should speak for
the administration in time of war is a preposterous as
though Captain Boy-ed should he railed to the cabinet.
Stone opposed the war; opposed the draft; opposed ev
erything that loyal Americans stood for at the stormy be
ginning of last year. He was denounced by President Wil
son as one of "those wilful men." Now he comes for
ward with a carefully prepared denunciation of Theodore
Roosevelt and the republican party generally for criticism
of this same president and these same policies he op- I
posed so stubbornly a few months ago. In fact Stone, the j
promoter of discord today, is more dangerous and dis
loyal than the Stone who opposed the war yesterday.
Pro-German then, he is siiil more effectively p-o-Cerman j
now. His attack upon Roosevelt is the venomous lunge
of the serpent at the lion. What-ver the colonel's faults
and his friends as well as his enemies know they are
many, no one has ever doubted his patriotism, his energy
and his courage. But his traducer has a record that in
dicts him upon all three ot these counts. Even adminis
tration leaders, to their credit be it said, tried to get

THRIFT STAMPS.
(Dallas News.)
Cochise county. Arizona, which nearly trebled
campaign, acocrding to word received by the war loan
department of the federal reserve bank of Dallas. One
bank in Bisbee sent a telegram to the federal reserve
bank yesterday, ordering 5.000 thrift cards. Other banks
In Bisbee have not yet been heard from.
Thrift and war savings stamps have already been sent
to about SQ0 banks in the eleventh federal reserve dis
trict Sam R. Lawder, assistant cashier of the war loan
department of the federal reserve bank, said yestercay.
There are about 1,950 banks in the district
Practically all red tape has been removed on the sale
of stamps to the banks. The stamps can now be obtained
from the federal reserve bank for cash or on consignment
and any amount desired will be sent Those banks taking
the stamps on a cash basis do not have to make any re
ports. This applies to ail banks, whether members of
the reserve system or not
Two of the largest railroads in Texas are considering
being made agents for the sale of thrift and war savings
stamps, Mr. Lawder said, and are planning to put them
on sale at every ticket window. Any railroad or ether
corporation or responsible business hous- can get an ap
pointment as agent and handle thrift and war savngs
stamps.
This fellow. Krylenko. a sergeant in the Russian
army yesterday; commander-in-chief of the Bolsheviki
armies today, he speaks frankly at least of his masters'
policies and aims. He would, using armed power wipe
away both the rich and the middle classes, delivering
the land to the peasant and the 'soldier. All very fine.
But the middle class is the strength and glory cf every i
nation in the world, and has always been so through all
the ages. But a sergeant who has 'been advanced in a
day to be commander-in-chief of armies is apt to be
dazzled by his own power and become dangerous alike
to himself, his masters, his cause and all causes and oeo
ples within his unhapny land. But Krylenko like the
cunning Trotzky and the knavish Lenine, has spoken
right out and told of his party's aims. Recent events in
Russia prove his words. The Bolsheviki. outnumbered
in the constituent assembly, dissolved that body Tith
bayonets, and are still rushing on headlong to a rule and
ruin of the peasant and a final mastery by the PresMan
spider who weaves and waits.
