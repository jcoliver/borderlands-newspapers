SOUTH SIDE OF SECTOR BEING MADE WHILE CAV
ALRY OUTSTRIPS INFANTRY IN PURSUIT OF FLEE-INGHUNS
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. American troops operating
in the St. Mihiel sector made considerable gains today, Gen
eral Pershing reported in his communique to the war depart
ment late tonight. Already 8000 prisoners have been count
ed and the movement still is in progress.
The statement follows:
"Headquarters American Expeditionary Forces, Sept. 12,
1918.
"Section A This morning, our troops, operating in the
St. Mihiel sector made considerable gains. Assisted by French
units, they broke the enemy resistance and .advanced at some
points to a depth of five miles. We have counted 8000 pris
oners up to the present. The operation is still in progress."
UNDATED WAR LEAD, (By the Associated Press).
The American first army under command of General Persh
ing, is in action against the Germans on a twenty-mile front,
on the famous St. Mihiel salient in Lorraine, which ha3-stood
a short wedge in the rrench line southeast of Verdun since
the commencement of the war.
In the preliminary thrust, ground was gained on both sides
of the triangle and also at its apex at St. Mihiel, and at last ac
counts, the Americans, with whom some French troops are
brigaded, were fast sweeping across the salient in an effort to
close the mouth of the big pocket before the Germans can ex
tricate themselves from the perilous position they are in, as a
result of the suddenness of the blow and the element of sur
prise it carried with it.
Although the advance of the Americans was swift and
sure and gains in excess of four miles on the southern side of
the battle area were made, the cavalry far outstripped the
tanks and footmen, and was last reported operating along the
railroad near Vigneulles, almost in the center of the salient
and some ten miles northeast of St. Mihiel and also northwest
of Pont-A-Mousson, through the forests and along the rail
way line running northward to Metz, the great German fort
ress, the southrn outer fortifications of which are less than ten
miles distant.
Thiacourt, Bouillouville, Pannes and several other towns
in the south were captured in the initial dash, while on the
west, at the northern edge of the pocket, the village of Com
bres was captured and the environs of Dommartin La Mon
tagne were reached. To the south, everywhere the Americans
penetrated into the heights of the Muse and the French fought
their way into the outskirts of St. Mihiel. Unofficial reports
are to the effect that the town has been recaptured by the
French.
The fighting front at the commence- r
ment of the battle aggregated twentj
miles eight miles on the western '
side and twelve miles on the southern
side. The fighting was preceded by an
extremely heavy artillery bombard
ment and the troops and tank Ad
vanced under barrage, which was car
ried out with mathematical precision.
From the war mans It would seem al
most impossible for the Germans' to)
evacite the salieni as they apparent-,,
ly are trying to do without huge losses

DOWN AND UP AGAIN
WASHINGTON, Sept. 12. A report
of the downfall and subsequent re-!
seating of the Tschaikovsky govern- j
ment at Archangel was received today !
by the state department. Officials ;
here said that until the government!
of all Russia is established, such
events were to be expected as the peo
ple are ardent politicians, with differ
ent factions seeking control.
Tschaikovsky and five or six other
members of the government were
overthrown by a rival faction at Arch
angel on September 8. They were
turned over to a group of the late
soviet members who are occupying an
island off Archangel. This was done.
It was believed here, more to keep
them out of the way than to do them
personal injury, for this remnant of
the soviet government is regarded as
entirely inocuous.
After the arrests a report was made
to the representatives of the entente
nations at Archangel. The victors of
this political skirmish, it is under
stood here, were not hostile to the en
tente or to Russia's welfare, but simp
ly wanted control of the government.
They are anti-German and antl-Bolsbe-viki
and have their own plan for the
rehabilitation of Russia.
The representatives of the allies at
Archangel, believing, however, thai
the Tschaikovsky government was
best equipped and organized to aid in
the saving of Russia, demanded that
Tschaikovsky and his colleagues be
restored to power. As this has been
done, the incident is regarded as
closed.

German prisoners have been sent

Because of the elevation of this ridge,
however, the ground was not in a very
bad condition. The operation was a
local one, restricted to the capture of
positions of the Havrlncourt-Trescault
sector. This was the only important
action reported on the British front
today.
The main interest here centered In
the American drive, news of which
spread quickly this morning. Officers
throughout the British army are
watching the battle eagerly. A meager
report received this afternoon that
things were going well for the Amer
icans was received with the greatest
enthusiasm and expressions of heart

One Lamp Is Extinguished
No better illustration of the depth and
breadth and lasting effects of the Hunnish
crime against Rheims cathedral can be
found in all the world of letters and history
and human imagination, perhaps, than
from a reading of John Ruskin's "Seven
Lamps of Architecture," and then , turning
to contemplate the shattered, crumbling
glory of Rheims. Our hot hatred for the
Hun turns slowly but surely to a cold.,
calm, fixed and changeless bitterness that
only the most complete expiation and a cen
tury or more of time can divert or soften.
Here is a passage from the Ruskin master
' piece that particularly applies to that dear,
grand and vanished' Rheims :
"For indeed, the greatest glory of a build
ing is not in its stones, nor in its gold. It3
glory is in its Age, and in that deep sense of
voicefulness, of stern watching, of mysteri
ous sympathy, nay, even of approval or
condemnation, which we feel in walls that
have long been washed by the passing
waves of humanity. It is in their lasting
witness against men, in their quiet con
trast with the transitional character of all
things, in the strength which, through the
lapse of seasons and times, and the decline
and birth of dynasties, and the changing
of the face of the earth, and of the limits of
the sea, maintains it3 sculptured shapeliness
for a time insuperable, connects forgotten
and following ages with each other, and
half constitutes the identity, as it concen
trates the sympathy, oLnations; it is in that
golden stain of time that we are to look for
rel light, and color, and preciousness of
architecture; and it is not until a building
has essumed this character, till it has been
intrusted with the fame, and hallowed by
the deeds of men, till its walls hnve been
witnesses of suffering, and its pillars rise
out of the shadows of death, that its ex
istence, more lasting as it is than that of the
natural objects of the world around it, can
be gifted with even so much as these pos
sess, of language of life."
We hear so much about war work now
days and all have so much of it to do or
to help with our dollars, that we are prone
to lose sight of the work that must be done
at home for the home folks. Take the
Y. M. C. A., for instance. The Y is doing
a great work in France and at the army
camps all over this country, but it is im
perative that the Y be kept strong and un
impaired in the home town. Its work at
home for the home workers is just as es
sential as it ever was before the war, if
not more so. Bisbee has one of the strong
est and most practical and beneficial Y. M.
C. A. homes and organizations in the coun
try. It is maintained solely by its member
ship fees and the aid extended by the min
ing companies of the district. With so many
of its active members gone to war the bur
den upon those at home is naturally greater.
Its expenses are higher, too. Nearly every
business man in the district is a member,
more or less active, but every business man
knows well the practical good done by the
Y here in a score of different ways and few
but that derive personal benefit in one way
or another from this institution. From
many cities, large and small,-over the coun
try, the call for help has been sounded for
the Y because of the war. Not for Y war
work, but for the home Y and it3 home
work. The Warren district, and especially
the business menwho are members, can
not afford to have the Bisbee Y lag for a
moment in its fine work for the district at
large and for the working men and busi
ness and professional men generally for
iack of support in both friendliness and
money.
At this time every neutral capital in
Europe is pouring forth a flood of slu"!
about ti e terrors ind ebbing morale of the
German people and of the mutinous state
of the German soldiers. The effects of all
this have not been noticable on the battle
front the past ten days where the Germans
are fighting with the same savage resolu
tion and the same skill they havn rlwa3rs
shown. All this stuff about German weak
ness should be regarded as strictly bunk
until the results begin to show in the battle
line.
GERMAN PEOPLE "HOPELESS'
(From the Outlook.)
Dr. Frank Bohn, an American of Ger
man ancestry, who has written many illum
inating articles interpreting the spirit and
design of the Pan-Germanists, published in
the New York Times recently a striking
article in which he reports the views of
some intimate friends of his who, although
Germans, are now expatriated and living in
Switzerland. All four of these men agree
in saying that the only salvation for Ger
many lies in her military defeat. The first
of these friends has been, says Doctor
Bohn, for many years a distinguished leader
in the industrial life of Germany. He is
quoted as saying;
"The number of people in Germany that
respects anything but force is utterly neg
ligible. For twenty years I have wished to
join a democratic party in Germany, and
work toward disarmament, anti-imperialism
and republican institutions, but there
was no such party for me to join. I would
have joined even the smallest group. But
there was no group which had the courage
to organize. ... I am hopeless, ut
terly hopeless about Germany. Only com
plete defeat can give her a new beginning.
THE PRIDE OF AMERICA
"You tell the American people that their
soldiers are admirable," said Marshal Foch
the other day to a correspondent of the As
sociated Prep?.
"They ask nothing better than to go to
their death. They can be reproached only
with rushing ahead too fast it is necessary
to hold them back."
Nothing better could be said of the Amer
ican soldiers. No greater tribute will ever
be paid to them.
If the British would only take Lens ! Or,
it may be more proper to say. if the British
could only take Lens! It is probably th;
most important to the allies of any city in
northern France within the German lines.
Not so much for its forts or hills or strategic
importance or its name, and these are great,
but for its COAL! France needs coal more
than anything else this fall. And the Ler.s
coal fields are the greatest in Europe. For
nearly two years the British troops have
been on the border of Lens and have made
no move against this most important place
for fifteen months. It is one of the strange
and inexplicable things of the war to a lay
man's! eye. Reports came recently that
Lens had been taken, but they proved
groundless. It had not even been attacked.
It is flanked from the south by the taking
of the Queant switch line, but the British
have not made a single move to develop
the advantages of that great victory. They
have simply sat down on the canal Du
Nord are waiting. Waiting for what? Foch
knows. Surely he will strike soon, either
east of Arras to make a last terrible effort
to take Lens and Douai before winter, or
for Cambrai and Laon, or just below
Rheims. The rain and not the Germans
has stopped the allied offensive after eight
continuous weeks.
Recent reports of wholesale massacres
and pillage and destruction and arson in
Moscow and Petrograd under orders of the
Bolsheviki leaders are only what might be
expected from such a rule. And you will
also notice that, while the dispatches had
Lenine and Trotzky on the run or on a
German battleship some weeks ago, they
are still in power in Russia, or what is left
of Russia. Only the allied bayonets will
ever loosen the hold of these fanatics r.d
cruel traitors from the throat of Russia.
The Russian people lack the energy and
the cohesion to accomplish this deliverance.
The ruin, riot and rapine must continue.
Conditions will grow much worse in Russia
before they will get better. This column is
not inclined to expend much sympathy
upon a people who will accept'a Trotzky
and a German half-breed like Lenine for
leaders. They are reaping where they have
sown. They threw down an organized
tyrany only to set up an unorganized tyr
any in its place. And another thing; pres
ent conditions in Russia are as little plead
ing to the Germans as they are to the allies.
Be sure of that. In the midst of this reign
of terror the Hun will get little food or ma
terial or cannon fodder from Russia.

no other country would be better situ

many was the belief expressed today
by Frederick Von Payer, the imperial
vice chancellor of Germany in a
speech delivered at Stuttgart.
Herr Von Payer was speaking on
the depression felt in Germany and
allied countries which he attributed
not only to recent military events but
to the prospect of a fifth war win

country would be belter situated as

.Herr Von Payer, "I believe I could
venture to say that Belgium could be
restored without conditions and with

BRITISHER DESCRIBES FIGHT.
H-' Review Leased Wire)
LONDON, Sept. 12. The Daily Mail
correspondent at the American front
sends the following description of the
tattle along the St. Mihiel sector:
"The first American army under the,
personal command of General Persh
ing lor the f'rst time went into action
today in the St. Mihiel salient. Never
before has there been such a large
concentration of American troops for
one operation and never before have
the Americans been in such complete
control of their operations.
"The event had long been anticipat
ed. Some people assigned to it grand
iose objectives, but in reality the at
tack is for limited objectives only.
' At 1 o'clock Thursday morning the
artillery preparation began with a roar
that could be heard many miles away
pnd a'.l night it arose and fell with
pec-liar lluctuatiuns. From all the
roads that ran parallel the flashes ef
innumerable guns told of the impend
ing assault. Towards 5 o'clock the
hour of the attack the firing became
even more rapid and its sullen tone
mingled Mrangcly with the sound
the rain.
"At dawn whole fleets of tanks,
manned by strong young Americans
end French, were to be seen moving
out of their shelters to lead the at
tack. They lumbered on, but the Ger
mans offered little opposition. The
American infantry followed in open
order, plowing through the mud. but
llicy were littles troubled by the feeble
artillery resistance.
"At out point, near Seicheprey,:
where the Americans had previously
lou.ht desperately with the Germans,
n:ai hine gun and automatic fire swept,
down upon thtt Yanks' ri-iht think, but
the tanks and artillery quickly moved
in that direction and t!iu Americaus

"At 7 o'clock the tanks had disap

' The Germans have ottered very ;

the next move of the draft machinery
will be in the numbering serially of
the registration cards. Until that
work is completed by the local boards
the drawing of the order numbers,
which will determine in a measure
the relative standing of the regis
trants, cannot be held.
In the meantime, however, question
al res will go forward to men between
19 and 21 and 32 and 36. so that they
may be classified and some of them
thus made ready for call In October,
after the national drawing is held.
Complete reports from the registra
tion today are not expected by rro
vost Marshall General Crowder before
Saturday. These will show the total
number of men registered, as well
as the proportion of this number to
the estimate in each district, and may
form the basis for activity by the
department of justice in rounding up
those who have evaded the law.

NEW YORK, Sept. 12. New York's

marched to registration centers today
voicing in all the fifty odd tongues
of the polyglot city their willingness
to join General Pershing's men over

in great groups and sang "The Star
Spangled Banner." The work went
forward swiftly and without disorder
throughout the city.
Members of the various allied mis
sions on duty in the city were per
mitted to register at the draft direct
or's office. Nearly 40U of them, many
attired in picturesque uniforms, wer
registered in the first three hours of
the morning.
Several hundred men. members of

WASHINGTON. Se-pt. 12 The im
pression, prevalent in many quarters
that members of congress are subject
to draft, was removed today by a rul
ing of General Crowder. read to the
house in answer to an inquiry by Rep
resentative Gard of Ohio. Congress
men, General Crowder's letter stated,
are "absolutely and peremptorily ex
empt by statute from the draft law
and cannot waive their exemption."
He added, however, that upon resigna
tion from congress, members would
automatically become subjen-t to the
draft, if within the age limits.
lance of the "crowding" so apparent
in the initial registration of June S,
1917. The exact number registered
will not be known until late today, ac
cording to Ray B. Krebs, last night.
Though the Cochise county supplie
tailed to arrive, the county board bor
rowed sufficient supplies from adja
cent counties of the state and there
was no shortage. For a few hours the
local boards ran out of cards, but this
soon was remedied.
Hundreds of loyal helpers turned up
at the various registration places ask
ing to be assigned work as clerks. As
a result the registration force was
ample to cover the needs of the situa
tion and no one had to wait. There
were more than 100 of these volunteer
clerks in the Warren district and over
300 In the county.
Early in the day came a rush, of
men of all nationalities anxious to get
the registration process over with u
soon as possible. As rapidly as they
arrived they were attended to. In the
entire district there was no attempt
to evade the duty of registering,
though In a lew instances, through ig
norance or misinformation, foreigner
did not believe they had to register.
An amusing Instance of this kind vu
seen in tho Lowell precinct when a
wooden legged Mexican bad to be
argued with for some time before he
could be convinced that every man,
whether whole or in pieces, iuubI reg
ister, it within the draft age. At the
same time it was explained to him
that the double circuuatancee of hie
being a foreign ciUien and a cripple
precluded his being called for service.
Another foreigner whea questioned
as to hie nearest relative, blushed
and stammered out in broken English
that be had no relatives now. hut he
bad asked the girl and hoped she
would marry him in a, few months.
An incident which aroused the ang
er of the county board as well as the
officers in Douglas took place when
Mexicans reported that they had been
tent by others of their race to the
Mexican consulate in Douglas and
there Informed that they must have
a certificate of Mexican citizenship
before they could register and for this
certificate they must pay $3. The
consulate did a thriving business in
the early hours of the day, but as soon
as this practice was discovered, a
deputy sheriff was placed at the door
to stop other Mexicans and inform
them that the certificates were in no
wise necessary. Mr. Krebs related
this incident last evening and said it
was being investigated further.
The office of the county recorder In
Tombstone will be a busy place the
remainder of this month. Additional
clerical help, including men drafted
for the work, will be engaged in sort
ing the registration cards and filing
them in the fireproof steel cabinet
provided for the purpose.
Questionnaries will be forwarded
to the registrars about October 1. It
is Mr. Krebs' present intention to
send out about 500 on that day and
to continue sending them out as rapid
ly as possible thereafter. The ques
tionnaires must be returned within
seven days to the office of the county
recorder. They will be studied and
classification of registrants will be
made.
According to present plans the class
one men will de subjected to physical
examination about October 10.
Between October 1 and the day of
the first call for physical examination,
the board probably will have winnow
ed out fairly well the foreigners, those
having dependents and .those engaged
in essential occupations.

STORY OF NUMBER 40
40 years ago an old doctor was put
ting up a medicine for diseases of the
blood, that cured the worst cases of
specific blood poison, and time proved
that the cures were permanent. After
many years I secured the perscription
(being a druggist), and took each in
gredient separately and referred to my
V. S. Dispensatory and other books on
medicine and found the medical prop
erties set down as follows: "Employed
in diseases of the glandular system, in
blood poUon. scrofula, constipation,
stomach and liver troubles, chronic
rheumatism, catarrh, in sores, ulcers,
skin eruptions, mercurial and lead
poisoning. Under its use nodes, tu
mors and scrofulous swellings that
have withstood all other treatment
disappear as if by magic" To com
memorate my fortieth year as a drug
gist I named this medicine Number 40

"I Simply Feel Like a New
Man," Says Welch After
Taking Tanlac
"To look at me now you'd hardly
think that just a little while ago my
liie was despaired of aim 1 was told
to-make my plans accordingly; but
Tanlac has fixed me up so 1 am out
in the fields every day forking hay,
and that's a strong man's job I can
tell you."
This remarkable statement was
made the other day by William Welch,
a well-known farmer who has lived all
his lile about a mile northeast of Ilea
verton, Oregon, on Route 4, Box 31,
in telling of his wonderful recovery
through the use of Tanlac.
"I had always enjoyed pretty good
health up to the first of last March,"
he continued, "when something seem
ed to go wrong and I got into such
a rundown condition that I fell off
from a hundred and fifty-five to a
hundred and thirty-two pounds, a loss
of twenty-three pounds. I was terribly
weak, and my heart would beat nnd
thump so fast that I could hardly rest
at night. I had to be very carefui
about what I would eat and for three
months I lived on the very lightest
kind of diet. My skin had a yellow
ish, sallow look like 1 didn't have any
blood in my veins, and I wasn't able
to do a lick of work on my farm. I
got mighty discouraged, for none of
the medicines I took did me any good
and 1 really thought my time hau
come.
"I was in this awful fix when I read
about the wonderful way Tan la? was
helping others, so I got me a bottle.
Well, I began to feel bi tter soon after
starting on it, and kept on improving
right along as I kept on taking it.
I have just finished my second bottle,
and I have not only gotten back all my
lost weight but am actually five
pounds heavier than I was before 1
was sick at all, that is I have gained
twenty-eight pounds since I began tak
ing Tanlac. I don't have a bit of trou
ble now and simply feei like a new
man."

CLEMENCEAU CASc TODAY.
"A Fool There Was" did much to es
tablish Miss -para's supremacy. "Cleo
patra" cinched it. "Salome," just fin
ished and soon to be produced, is de
clared to glorify her art much as a
sunset crowns a mountain prospect.
Put it is her "Clemenceau Case"
that has always been accorded fore
most rank in being typically Bar.i
esiiue, and it is because of repeated
and manifold requests that William
Fox is issuing a revised edition of
tins masterpiece. Re-taking, re
titling and general re-editing, which
has sharpened the scenes, are factors
hieh constitute the 1918 version of
"The Clemenceau Case" virtually a
new olienr.g. At the Eagle today only.

Hiuh school facultv has cintribul
eiuht of its number to th; various :
branches of the service. K. Q. Snider.
v.ho was principal of the High school,
has r-'M'.e to Fort Sill, Okla., and en-,
listed as a private in the ordnance de.
parlment. Althom-.h over the dr.ilt
age. .Mr. Pnider felt the call to arms,
and was given leave of absence from
the principalship of t'.ie High school
for the duration of the war. Harry,
Crockett, who was assistant manual
training instructor and also a gradu
ate of the institution, is in the navy,

who was instructor in the sciences, j
is in the service as are also C. W. D. ;
Chance, another science teacher, and ;
TJ. J. I.awrenson. who was the ath-:
letic coach. A. M. Shanibaugh, who
was teacher of English and history,
was commissioned a first lieutenant, ,
and he is on active duty. W. H. Mc-:

When this record of patriotic teach
ers and students and graudates is
taken into consideration, one quickly
arrives at the conclusion that the P.
H. S. is surely luO per cent American.
Some of the grade teachers are in
some branch of the service, and the
schools and pupils are doing a great
deal of war work. Mr. Phiibrook urges
all high school graduates to enlist in
the students' army training corps for,
intensive training. This Is the ys- j
tern whereby high school alumni may,
receive a crtain amount of college '
training while training for the army, ;
and carries with it the possibility of
a commission. Those v. ho are In school
