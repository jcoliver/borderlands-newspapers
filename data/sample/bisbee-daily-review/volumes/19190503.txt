MAYOR WOODMAN
JURY DECIDES EXECUTIVE DID HOT
RECEIVE MONEY TO PROTECT VICE;
Sensational Trial Lasted for
Counter Charges ofVV itness Tampering and
Police Interference Were Hurled
LOS ANGELES, May 2. Mayor
F. T. Woodman, on trial for sev
eral weeks on charges of having
accepted a bribe to protect vice
conditions, was acquitted tonight
by a jury in the superior court.
HISTORY -OF CASE
LOS ANGELES, May 2. Mayor F.
T. Woodman of Los Angeles was in
dicted March 21 by the county grand
jury on a charge of asking, receiving
and agreeing to receive a bribe to
protect vice.
It was charged that the mayor had
agreed to accept $25,000 from George
Brown and George Henderson in re
turn for allowing them what practical
ly would have been a monopoly on the
operation of certain illegal resorts in
Chinatown and other districts close
to the business section, without police
molestation.
The $25,000, it was alleged, was to
be paid ia ten monthly installments of
$2500 each. Of the $25,000, it was
leged Brown and Henderson actually
paid $2000 in January to Horace W.
Karr, a former newspaperman.' who
was accused of receiving it in behalf
of Mayor Woodman for his interest
and under his direction.
"Purity" Squad "'Fixed," Charge
As a part of the alleged conspir
acy for the protection of vice the in
dictment charges the mayor caused
the appointment of Sergeant William
Hackett as head of the so-called
"purity" squad, whose duty It was to
6uppress various forms of vice. Brown
and Henderson were indicted on a
charge of bribing Mayor Woodman
at the same time the rue bill was
voted against the official.
The indictment followed an inves
tigation by the grand jury under the
direction of Thomas Lee Woolwine,
district attorney. A number of city
officials testified.
According to the mayor the entire
affair is a political plot designed to
prevent his re-election as he had just
previously announced his. candidacy.
Mr. Woodman furnished bail in the
sum of $10,000 and employed counsel.
Pressure was brought to bear upon
him; to resign or ask to be suspended
as mayor pending the outcome of his
trial but he refused to do so. After
a spirited debate the city council
voted to allow him to discharge the
duties of his office. "
Intimidation, Say Prosecution
Mr. Woolwine charged the police
department was being used to intimi
date state witnesses and to embarass
the - prosecution. He issued an ap
peal ' to the citizens asking their co
operation in furnishing any evidence
they might have In connection with
the case.
The defense charged that the dis
trict attorney had plied certain wit
nesses with liquor and otherwise had
improperly conducted the investiga
tion which resulted in the indictment
of the mayor.
An important factor in starting the
investigation were telegrams alleged
to have been sent the mayor by Kerr
from Sacramento. The mayor after
his' arrest made two of these public.

PARIS. May 2. The naval terms to

Germany which finally have been com
pleted, do not provide for the sinking
of the larger German warships. 4he
disposition of these vessels is left to
be decided later by the allied and as

THIRD SUBSCRIBED
Must Tie- Up Credit Unless
Buying, by Individuals
Increases Pace
WASHINGTON, May 2. With only
Beven working days left, more than
two-thirds of the Victory Liberty loan
remains to be subscribed. Treasury
department figures tonight showed $1 -497,347,600,
less than one-third of the
loan quota, pledged.
Individual subscriptions in nearly
every reserve district were said to be
running far short of those in previous
loans, apparently Indicating that the
public was not awake to the necessity
for raising the full $4,500,000,00 asked
for in order to bring the men back
from 'overseas, complete demobiliza
tion and care of those wounded in the
service. Plans immediately were laid
and telegrams sent to every state or
ganization in the country to make the
last seven working days of the cam
paign productive of sufficient individ
ual subscriptions to put the loan "over
the top" without calling on the fin
ancial institutions and tying up credit.
The St. Louis federal reserve dis

scribed 59.68 per cent of its quota and
two other western districts, Chicago
ana Minneapolis, rank second
and j
third, respectively. The southwest, or
Dallas district, was at the bottom
when the latest tabulation of subscrip
tions was made.
The amounts subscribed by the fe-

was held at Central school yesterday,
it was decided to appoint sufficient
teachers to fill 17 vacancies, which at
present existed. Much business of fu
ture importance was discussed, among
which was the contemplated school
building program.
C. F. Philbrrok, superintendent of
schools, said that the board at yester
ayf s afternoon meeting authorized the
building of a new school house in the
new addition to Warren. This school
when completed will contain four
class rooms and will be equipped with
modern conveniences. Bids and esti
mates for this new school house will
be called for within the next ten days,
said Mr. Philbrrok. '
It is because of the consistent
growth in the number of students in
the Warren district that the building
program is considered an ' emergency,
therefore the school boajd decided to
hold a bond election as soon as pas
sible. Should the election carry it is
planned to erect a school on Brewery
Gulch, to be used exclusively by Mex
ican children, while another school
will be erected in Greenway.
Owing to the present crowded con
ditions, it is necessary to use every
available space in local schools. Some
classes are conducted in the base
ment while others are held in the at
tic. Further announcements with re
gard to school building plans will be
made later, it is said.

Nearly a hundred thousand dol

Bisbee is to subscribe its quota.
At last night's meeting it was urged
by Chairman Gaines that the individ

possibly can afford.
Mr. Gaines was very emphatic in
stating to the precinct workers the
urgency of making the loan to the

the remaining days.
A number of precincts, it developed,
have not yet been worked.
A shipment of buttons have arrived
and they can now be obtained by ap

It was suggested at last night's

two days of the drive be utilized in a

highly probable that his suggestion
will be carried into execution.
Mr. Gaines told the precinct work

yesterday morning and bought $700
worth of bonds stating that he now
had $2000 worth, on hand and intended
to keep them as a life insurance
policy.
"That kind of a spirit," said Mr.
Gaines, "is the kind that will keep our
nation from perishing for financial
want, but there is an apparent lack
of it." .

Paramount Star , Rollicking Girl in
"The Greatest Thing in Life."
!
To see. Miss ' Lillian Gish as Jean
ette in "The Greatest Thing dn
Life," is to see her in a role en
tirely different from any in which she
has recently appeared. The picture is
an Artcraft production by David Wark
Griffith and will be shown at the
Grand theater today and tomorrow.
It presents Miss Gish as a rollicking
girl, half hoyden, half dreamer. Her
old father, who is homesick for his
native France, keeps a little tobacco
and news-stand in New York city.
Jeanette has to tidy up the living
rooms, and attend customers.
Very happy is she with today, but
tomorrow is of reat interest, too, for
then will come -her hero, a strong,
brave man who loves the world as she
does, and likes to dream too. At first
she thought Edward Livingston might
be the man. He was an elegant New
York chap, but he called her a simp
one day, and left before she could
really express Her thoughts with the
rigorous force they deserved.
Then she went to France with
her daddy. When a young giant with
a basket of .vegetables arrived for the
daily delivery at her aunt's shop, and
found the American girl wonderful,
Jeanette had a new hero to consider.
But he would eat garlic, and Cupid
never rode to conquest on the waves
of garlic fumes,'
Livingston visited France, crossing
the ocean to deliver an apology. He
shared her delight in poetry and he
was clean and fiue, but he hated chil
dren. She knew then he could never
be her ideal, and she returned to Mon.
le Bebe.
But something unforeseen happened
and brought them together again. Adv.

Destroying the Borderland
Well defined plans for destroying the Borderland route from the
New Mexican line through Cochise county, and of establishing a new route
through the central and northern part of the county, have been set on
foot. In the same plans are menacing features, threatening to rob the
Huachuca summer resorts of a part of their popularity and patronage.
Residents of the entire county are deeply interested in the attempt and
its outcome.
The plan, which was launched several weeks ago, calls for the con
struction of a highway directly east from Pearce into the Chiricahua
mountains. The argument for the highway is that Cochise county,
especially the northern districts, need a summer! resort and that this is
the most feasible road to the best resort. It was admitted that the plan
would possibly attract away from the Huachuca mountains some summer
vacationists, but in spite of thi3 fact, residents of the southern part of
the county were inclined to favor the scheme. They knew the Huachucas
would remain popular and gain in favor by comparison.
Then suddenly it was discovered that the proposed highway into th
Chiricahuas in reality has as a purpose the destruction of the Borderland
highway. Take a map of Cochise county and lay it before you. Study it
for a moment and see how easily the scheme unfolds.
Pearce is almost in the center of the county. East from Pearce for
nearly 25 miles runs a good automobile road, through West Well, north
of Cottonwood, south of Light and into the foothills of the Chiricahuas.
Rodeo, New Mexico, on the border, is nearly half way between the
north and south boundaries of New Mexico. and Airzona. - Northwest from
Rodeo and finally west from Rodeo in Arizona, into the peaks of the
Chiricahuas, through Portal and Paradise ,for nearly 20 miles is a good
automobile road. .- This highway reaches almost to the top of the Chiri
cahua mountains.
Continue the road from Pearce east on your map with a pencil until
it eaches the top of the Chiricahuas. Here is the summer resort. Here
is the ostensible end of the highway.
But, a few miles northeast is the Rodeo road, and leading generally
in a northeasterly direction are passes through which the remaining link
could be built at a cost of a few thousands of dollars.
This is the real object of the proposed highway.
The Borderland route leaves New Mexico at Rodeo, .strikes in a
southwest direction to Douglas, and traverses the southern part of Co
chise county. It is already constructed; it is the most popular trans
continental highway. It brings hundreds of tourists each season into thos
part of the counay, through Douglas and the Warren District. It is a rec
ognized link in trans-country logs. The Borderland route should be zeal
ously protected, and should be maintained as a "part of the national
highways system as it now is constituted in this county.-
If the proposed Chiricahua highway is iconstructed traffic can be
diverted from the Borderland at Rodeo, routed through Pearce to Co
chise or Willcox, and then sent along the northern highways to Tuscon.
The entire southern section of the country would be cut off of the high
way, and the oBrderland through Cochise county would be destroyed. .
Highway matters are just now receiving much attention by the
people of this county. In considering them they should take inro ac
count this proposed, road. It is hardly possible that the residents of
the county will permit the destruction of their link in the transcontinental
highway. They have striven too long, too persistently and too ardently
to part with their gains without at least a struggle. ' .
The Great American Home
cience Is a Great Comfort
A scientist ercently declared that anything which could possibly oc
cur in the history cf worlds and their inhabitants has already occurred.
He based this assertion oa his conception of the infinity of eternity.
So many millions of years have passed into the discard, he said, that
there's been plenty of time for the development of all possible forms
of life, intellect, mechanics, science, etc., ages and ages before we were
born. In other words it's another way of saying there's nothing new
under the sun. .
It is hard for any mind, not scientific, to believe that way back
some hundreds of millions of years ago on some other worlds, there were
other human beings who had telephones, automobiles, canned soups and
all the other marvels of our modern times. It i3 hard to believe that
such worlds blew up into star dust, along with all their inhabitants ,
and inventions and that nature then set to wdrk doing the same thing
over again creating another race of human beings who could again
make gooseberry pies, barbed wire and liver pills.
Of course when you look at it from the scientist's viewpoint, he has
some foundation for his statement. The infinity of eternity is a tre
mendously long time and, with thousands of billions of years behind us
and with only a few million years required to bring the human race
to its present high plane, it does seem plausible to thing that any
thing which might happen has already happened. There sure has been
time enough for anything.
What a comfort, too, all this is to us! What a pleasing sensation
to realize that when you get a nasty crook in your neck gazing upward
at the transcontinental airplane sailing over jour town with the mail
that you are simply repeating something that someone else did some
where a half dozen billion years or so ago. It makes your neck feel so
very much better, doesn't it? What a comfort science is, to be sure!
Statesmen say that America will not enter into an alliance with
France to protect her from Germany. There may be no "scrap of
paper," but the Hun will understand the situation just the same.
Congressman Blanton of Texas rushes Into print with the assertion
that labor unionism is closely allied with bolshevism, and the newspaper
that printed his name Blatant wasn't so far wrong.
The Japs have put one of our missionaries on trial for sheltering
Koreans who were planning national independence. Boy, ask Mr. Wilson
to hurry up with that league.
The charge that Gompers and Lenine are working together breaks
down before the evident fact that Gompers represents American laborers
and Lenine represents Russian loafers.
The department of justice is willing to assume the task of enforcing
prohibition, but if there Is to be a transfer of authority, why slight
Burleson?
The government has a billion dollars to lend those who would sell
goods in foreign markets, but or course it would be outrageously social
istic to lend money to merchants who sell at home.
Virginia troops were called out to protect the court at Standardsville.
and now Inine will rejoice that the entire state of Virginia has
gone bolshevik.

JEROME. May 2. Miami is not to
have, this year, the undivided honors
of encouraging home gardens among
the workmen in her mines, for the
United Verde Extension company has
inaugurated a plan that will enable
the Verde district to make a recora
at least as good as that made by the-j
Inspiration mine last year when, from
112 plots of garden ground furnished
by the company, they took crops val
ued at $103,000.
The Extension management has se
cured sufficient arable ' land on the
old Hopkins ranch in the valley to al
lot one-eighth of an acre to every em
ploye of mine and smelter and is
preparing to encourage the cultiva
tion of the tracts by every means at its
command.
The plots are being carefully pre
pared for cultivation by farm ex
perts and water and seeds will be fur
nished free by the company 'to every
employe who undertakes the cutliva
tion of one of the eighth-acre tracts.
Of course, the produce raised will be
the property of the employe to do
with a3 he pleases.
f ; An official of our state department, name not announced expresses
the opinion that the time has come to take a firm stand against-bolshevism.
His opinion is sound enough, but about a year tardy.
The chap who is doing the most for bolshevism in America is
the one who complains that every effort to do soinethiug for the people
who work is inspired by bolshevism.

INDISCRIMINATE DEATH
FOR UNLICENSED DOGS
Apparently the street of Bisbee are
no longer a safe and peace abiding
mecca for the poor Btray dogs, for
since May 1 all dogs found on the
streets without a proper license are
caught and immediately destroyed.
Yesterday City Marshal Kempton said
that Officer Sheppard had destroyed
no less thantwenty dogs in the two
days and he will continue to destroy
the. All owner of dogs hre ordered to
keep their dogs off the streets if thoy
have not taken out licenses and even
then they are liable to have their ani
mals confiscated. Some little conster
nation exists against the police- for
killing the dogs without at first keep
lug them for at least two days to give
owners a chance to call for thctn.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 2. Buying of
"reorganized" or low grade rails on a
scale almost without parallel in sev
eral years was the interesting feature
of today's stock market and contrib
uted more than any other factor to
the turnover, which again attained
uge dimensions. -t
The demand for transportations in
cluded not only the western and south
western rails of recent prominence,
but also encompassed many Issues
which have become little more than
a memory to the average trader. Ganis
in these secondary and dormant
shares, such as Western Pacific, Den
ver and Rio Grande, Chicago and
Great Western, Chicago and Alton and
Ontario and Western, ranged from 1
to 3 points.
Dividend paying rails and allied is
sues on intrinsic value were 1 to 4
points higher.
Shippings, oils and motors and
their specialties responded to another
broad inquiry at extreme gams of 2
to 8 points. Total sales amounted to
1,650,000 shares.
Bonds were irregular, investments
making slight gains. Liberty and for
eign issues were steady to firm. To
tal sales, par value, aggregated' $13,
250,000. Old United States bonds were
unchanged on call.
PROSPERITY HERE, SAYS .DUN'S
NEW YORK, May 2. Dun's tomor
row will say: Economic aspects,
while still reflecting many contracts
of light and shade, grow steadily
brighter. Some of the dark spots, as
those fn the great iron and steel in
dustry, remain conspicuous, but that
decisive recovery from the after-war
repression has resulted in some other
leading branches is no longer to be
doubted, and best of all there has
been a further strengthening of that
confidence which is essential to sus
tained progress. It is not now a ques
tion, in short, as to whether conditions
have improved, but only as to what
lengths the commercial revival has
already carried, and as to how soon
the general peace time expansion
which seems to be clearly portended
will make its appearance. All the
traditional elements of prosperity are
present; economically, the country
has moved into a powerful position,
and but for the delay in the adjust
ment of those complex international
problems which have inevitably come
as an aftermath of the greatest war
in history, the domestice development
would probably be more far reaching
and rapid.

WOOL MARKET
BOSTON, May 2. The Commercial
Bullein tomorrow will say: ,
"The market here has shown a
slightly easier tendency this week.
The Australian wools offered by the
navy on Wednesday declined 5 to 7
per cent, except for the choicest warp
wools. Prices generally are steady,
however. In the west buying has also
stopped moie or less and the high
prices paid last week have not been
duplicated.
"As for the goods situation, the de
mand is steel keen for the finer
grades, although the mills are now
well sold ahead."

THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 2. Bullish con
structions placed on a speech at Du
luth today by Julius H. Barnes, na
tional wheat administrator, did a good
deal to bring about a material fresh
advance in the corn market here, but
later the aspects of the address re
ceived more careful study. Corn
closed nervous, 24 to 36c net higher.
with July $1.65 to $1.65" and Sep
tember $1.61 to $1.6Ufc. Oats fur
nished c off to '4c advance, and pro
visions varying from 5c decline to a
rise of 25c.
Throughout the session, dealings in
corn were, on a broad scale, with ag
gressive commision house buying
most of the time until after midday,
when the prevailing tendency swung
toward sales to realize profits. In
creased shipping demand from the
east, together with shrinkage of re
recipts from te country counted as
bullish factors, and so too, did re
ports of an outbreak of Australian
wheat disease in Illinois.
Oats weakened as a result of word
that cutting of the new crop had al
ready begun in Texas.
Provisions were lifted by the
strength of corn and hogs. Lard
touciied a new high price record.

TERRIBLY SWOLLEN
Suffering Described As Tcrture
Relieved by Black-Draught.
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, o!
this plase, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he In
jured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighefi 165 lbs., and fell off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had thr-e different
doctors, yet with all their nil dicine, his
Doweis tailed to act., fie would turnup
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and diink
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I ssnt and bought Thedford's -Black-Draught.'?
I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got re'ief and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owes, his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught."
Thedford's Black-Draught will help you
to keeo fit, ready for the day's work,
try it! NC-13?

MINNOWS PLENTIFUL
IN SALT RIVER ASSERT
RETURNING BISBEEANS
Residents of this part of the state
making the trip to Roosevelt dam for
the bass fishing in that lake, will save
themselves time and trouble if they
will stop near Phoenix on the Salt
river and catch minnows, declare
Frank Bledsoe of Bisbee and J. T.
Hood of Douglas, who returned yes
terday from a week's fishing and vaca
tion trip through Pima, Pinal, Mari
copa and Gila counties, and who spent
several days at the dam. The fishing
is good where live bait is used, but the
bass are not rising now to artificial
baits, they report.
Roads throughout the part of the
state in which Mr. and Mrs. Bledsoe
and Mr, and Mrs. Hood traveled, are
good, declared Mr. Bledsoe yesterday.
Especially ia this true of the Border
land route, from Bisbee to Tucson, and
from Tucson to Phoenix. Out of Mesa,
en route to the dam, the Roosevelt
highway is in poor shape for about 25
miles after the road goes into the hill3
beyond the government wells. Ex
cept for this stretch all of the high
ways were in excellent condition.
Central Arizona at this time of trie
year is more beautiful than he has
ever seen it, declared -Mr. Bledsoe.
"Everywhere were grass and flowers,"
he said. "I have never seen the des
erts and hills so green and verdant.
After we struck the hills we found
great patches of Mariposa lilies.
Among them was one which to us was
new a red lilly which was streaked
on the inner side of the petals witn
violet veins. We carried great bou
quets of them with us from place to
place, and were surprised at the
length of time they remained fresh."
Tourists over the state roads are
