38,000 MORE
MEN TO SOON
GO TO FRANCE
Second Contingent of Troops
Will Be Made Up of Forty
Second and Twenty-Sixth
Divisions of Guards.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. TwO army
divisions instead of one, comprising a
detail of at least 38.000 men, probably
will make up the first contingent of
the national guard to go to France.
Although no official confirmation was
Obtained there were evidences today
that the composite forty-second divi
sion, whose organization recently was
announced, will be accompanied aboard
by the twenty-sixth, made up of New
England guardsmen. No New England
states are among the twenty-six hav
ing representation in the composite
division.
The commander of the twenty-sixth
is Major General Clarence Edwards,
now acting as commander of the de
partment of the northeast, and it is
presumed he would go td Europe with
the division.' The forty-second is com
manded by Major General W. A. Mann.
Mobilization Started
A report was current today that suf
ficient shipping will be available for
forwarding two divisions within the
time fixed for the departure of the forty-second
and that the twenty-sixth
had been selected to go because it
comes from a compact area, and it is
composed, for the most part, of regi
ments of high rating.
The forty-second division is being
mobilized at Mineola, L. .1.. under the
new European standard, which re
quires that the strength of the indus
trial infantry regiments be increased
more than 50 per cent The process i
necessitates thfc addition of some units
not included in the original 'order, for
which one company of infantry, for in
stance, was to have come from any
state, two companies have been con
solidated to give the 250 men neces
sary Thus hundreds of men have
been transferred to fill up the regi
ments selected to go. All other na
tional guard divisions will go through
a similar process on their arrival at
their divisional camp.
Final Allotment
No hin has been given as- to the
probable time it will require to pro
pose the forty-second lOr embarkation.
As it is a wholly new organization, it
is logical to assume that it will take
some time to get into working shape.
The question of equipment also enters
into the fixing of a sailing date. The
same considerations apply also to the
twenty-6ixth.
The original plan for a composite
national guard expeditionary force is
nown to have provided for two divi
sions made up on the composite plan.
Approximately 40 states wOuld have
contributed guardsmen to form the
forty-second and twenty-sixth and sup
plemental divisional or army troops
might have made up an expedition that
represented every state.
The way department announced to
day the final allotment of state troops
among the national army cantonments
and made public the list of colonels
assigned to regimental commands in
the various divisions both of the na
tional army and the national guard.

mittee of their leaders to accept what

NATIONAL SECRETARY
OF SOCIALISTS IS
AGAIN ARRESTED
CHICAGO, August 17. Adolph
Germer, national secretary of the
socialist party, recently arrested
and later released, was re-arrested
today on a charge of having violat
ed the espionage law by making a
a public speech against conscrip
tion. His re-arrest is said to be the re
sult of a consideration of the case
by President Wilson and Attorney
General Gregory. The address
complained of a speech delivered
by Germer. The case was set for
hearing before Federal Judge Car
penter, next Wednesday.
The complaint against Germer
charges that he "unlawfully and
feloniously did make and convey
false reports and statements tend
ing to promote insubordination,
disloyalty, mutiny, and refusal of
duty in the United States army."
"I made no statements that could
justly be construed as promoting
disloyalty or insubordination," said
Germer. "What I said was in pur
suance of my legal rights, but I
was misquoted to give the impres
sion that I was disloyal.
He was born in East Prussia, but
that his sympathies had been with
Russia rather than Germany.
EXEMPTION APPEAL
BOARDS ARE URGED
TO SPEED UP WORK
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. Prompt
action by exemption appeal boards was
urged today by Provost Marshal Gen
eral OOwder in a telegram to the
governors declaring' delays would
mean that men with exemption claims
undecided would escape the Septemb
er 5 call to the colors at the expense
of others who have waived exemption.
Every district must furnish 30 per
cent of Us quota on the first call and
unless the calls of all belonging in this
contingent have been decided, men
further down the line making no
claims will have to be moved up into
the vacancies. The government de
sires that every man go as far as pos
sible In his proper order.
In replying today to a letter from
Senator Weeks, urging that aliens be
drafted for military service. President
Wilson said the matter of diplomatic
action to clear the way for such a step
"is already interesting the department
of state and I have no doubt that it
shall be accomplished."

"TIME IS NOT
YET RIPE FOR
PEACF'-CECIL
Allied Governments Will Dis -
cuss Pope's Proposals Joint
ly Lansing and Advisors
Continue to Study Message.
(By Review Leased Wire).
LONDON, August 17. The. allied
governments will discuss jointly the
peace proposals of Pope Benedict and
a reply will be issued in due course.
Lord Robert Cecil told the Associated
Press tonight. Whether the reply will
be a joint note or, as suggested In
some quarters, through the medium
of the United States or by some other
manner will be decided later.
When the corrsepondent entered the
office of the minister of blockade he
was seated at a desk with a package
of documents dealing with the fate of
the crew of the steamer Belgian
Prince, while another packet lying
near told the story of the American
steamer Campana.vsunk August 6, and
from which the captain and several
gunners were removed by the crew of
the Belgian Prince is not yet known.
Says Pope Is Sincere.
"It is difficult totalk of a 'condition'
remarked Lord Robert in response to
a question, regarding the papal note,
"while' reading stories like that, l
sincerely hope the American prison
ers taken from the Campana have not
suffered the fate which the pirates
meted out to our men aboard the
Belgian Prince. It, harks back to the
awful days when old time pirates by
way of reprisal made sailors walk the
plank to. certain death in the sea."
Turing to the note from the Vatican,
Lord Robert, after prefacing his re
arks with the statement that inas
much as the .matter jiow is a subject
for discussion by the allied govern
ments he could express only his own
personal views, saying: "premature
attempts at mediation are not usually
successful and I fear this is prema
ture. "I think we all realize the pope's
motives' are sincere and that he de
sires peace, ardently, as Indeed we ail
do. But the time is not yet ripe.
"The allies cannot think of con
donement until the criminals are real
ly repentant and have shown it by
word and deed." '
Proposals Considered.
WASHINGTON. August 17. That
the government is determined to give
Pope Benedict's peace proposal de
liberate and painstaking consideration
before framing a reply, was evidenced
again today by developments both at
the white house and the state depart
ment. The cabinet holding its first session
since the note arrived, avoided any
general discussion of the subject be
cause President Wilson is understood
to feel that there must be a searching
analysis of the questions raised.
Secretary Lansing and his advisors,
on whom mist of the responsibility
for making this analysis will rest,
continued their study of the pontiffs
suggestion with every Indication that
it would require several days before
any concrete decision can be reached.
Meantime, however, the under-current
of official thought manifestly
continued to trend toward a convic
tion that the grand alliance will find
some of the proposals in the Vatican
note very difficult to accept.

TEUT
ONS FIGHT
TO
LENS
i Determined Attempts of Ger
man Forces to Retake Com
manding Positions Driven
Back by Canadians.
(By Review Leaded Wire).
BRITISH FRONT IN.FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, Aug. TT.-Gernian troops
last night made a determined attempt
to recover s small section of ground
taken by the Canadians yesterday af
ternoon northeast of Lens, but three
successive counter attacks were driv
en off with heavy losses to the enemy.
The first counter attack on the Cana
dian center, made in the early even
ing, was an absolute failure. About
9 o'clock the Germans again surged
forward and succeeded in pushing back
a few advanced posts, but the Cana
dians subsequently moved forward
and re-occupied the positions. Agom
the Germans came back but they were
repulsed and appeared to be satisfied
to let matters remain as they were for
the time being.
Positions Consolidated
On the r.Orth of the salient the Ger
mans put down a heavy barrage last
night and gave indications of a coun
ter attack, but the British artillery re
plied with such a quick and effective
barrage that an infantry action fol
lowed. The same thing happened east and
southeast of Monchy early this morn
ing. The Westhoek and Frezenborg ridge
sections which had seen such hard
fighting were heavily shelled by the
Germans through the night. The
British and French were progressing
satisfactorily with the consolidation
of their positions all along the front
Evidence continue to multiply from
both the prisoners and British officers
of the wonderful efficacy of the British
barrage fire yesterday morning on the
north line of the British line, where
the advance was so successful. The
correspondent visited the casualty
clearing station of the Langemarck re
gian and talked with a British artillery
observation officer who was wounded
in the fighting near Langmarck. He
said:
Describes Attack
"I was stationed in an advance post
where I could see the full effects of
our fire on the Langemarck region.
While I directed the firing of the guns
in the rear I was amazed to see what
our gunners could not see.
"At the jumping-ofl hour, which was
4:45 O'clock, the British dropped a bar
rage in front of our infantry for the
advance. It was as though a tOHd cur
tain of steel had been dropped before
our men. It moved forward with the
mechanical precision of clockwork. All
our guns broke out with such a hur
ricane of fire that I was stunned with
the effort.
"I tried to say bOmething to a com
panion standing beside me, but could
not make him bear my loudest shouts,
so deafening was the thunder from
the breaking shells. The barrage mov
ed forward with such accuracy that
our infantry was able to keep quite
close to it without danger for there was
no wavering Of the barrage line.
Straight on over Langemarck and the
surrounding region passed the barrage
with the infantry trailing. It was not
more than 30 minutes from the start
before we were in the town itself. It
was 8 o'clock when our gun fire fin
ally rested on German positions far
to the rear and there they continued
to hammer away while the fighting
went on about Langemarck.
Guns Are Removed
"The Germans undoubtedly were
expecting out attack for their counter
bararge was diOpped back of our men
almost as Boon as our advance began. I
could Observe the whole thing and
there is absolutely no doubt of the tre
mendous superiority of our artillery
work and the preponderance of our

SENATE CLEARS WAY
FOR FINAL BATTLE
ON WAR TAX BILL
(By Kevlew Leased Wlrej
WASHINGTON, Aug. 17. Disposi
tion by the senate today Of many un
contested provisions of the $2,006,000,
000 war tax bill almost cleared the way
for the sharp fight which probably will
begin Monday over income and war
profits taxes.
Among important features disposed
of during the day were the wine and
motor vehicle .schedules. The revis
ions of the finance committee levying
between $40,000,000 and $50,000,000 on
owners of motor vehicles instead or
$68,000,000 on manufacturers as pro
posed by the house bill, were adopted
as were the increased rates on wines,
estimated to raise $21,000,000 against
$6,000,000 under the house rates.
House provisions levying a 5 per
cent tax upon gross sales of many
manufacturers and designed to raise
$118,575,000. also were eliminated, the
new automobile and other reduced
excise taxes being substituted. The
senate also accepted the finance com
mittee's action in striking out the
house provision for additional fed
eral taxation of inheritances, design
ed to raise $6,000,000.
An amendment to the automobile
section suggested by Senator Knox and
adopted, imposes a surtax of $10 for
each $500 on cars costing more than
$1000.
The tax based upon original list
price would be reduced by 10 per cent
for each year's use of the machine up
to a gross allowance of 50 per cent.

Extreme Measures, Even to
Dispatch of Federal Troops

Taken If Necessary.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. Aug. 17. Govern
mental a'gencies were placing them
selves in readiness today to meet any
situation which may develop in the
northwest and On the Pacific coast as
a result of the threatened strike of
Industrial Workers of the World Aug
ust 20 in Oregon, Washington, Mon
tana and Idaho. Extreme measures,
even to the despatch of federa ltroops
to the affected section, will be taken it
necessary.
TrcOps will be sent, it is said, only
In case of serious disorder which local
state and federal authorities may be
unable to meet adequately, of to insure
the non-iriterruption of war industries.
Officials are united, however, in the
opinion that there must be no cessa
tion of activity in such industries as
are regarded as essential to prosecu
tion of the war.
Reports from the affected districts
today showed little change in the sit
uation and officials Ijere, while not
minimizing the extent of the threat
ened disturbances, are hopeful that it
will not assume such magnitude as to
make extreme corrective measures
necessary.

GERMANS FAIL
TO RECAPTURE
LOST GROUND
French Make Further Ad
vances of Northern Wing of
Ypres Front Canadians
Continue Drive on Lens.
(By Review Leased Wire).
Their counter attacks having failed
with severe losses, the Germans in the
Ypres area Of the western front have
not resumed attempts to recapture the
ground lost to the Anglo-French
troops on Thursday.
On the northern wing of the Ypres
front the French, after repulsing
heavy German counter attacks on Fri
day made further gains near the
Steenbeke river. Elsewhere on the
front the latest reports fiOni Field
Marshal Haig says there has been
made no change. In addition to their
capture of German positions and 1800
prisoners the allied forces captured 24
guns from the Teutons.
German Report Denied
While admitting an allied gain along
the Yser canal and near Bixschoote,
where the French advanced, Berlin
claims officially that most of the Brit
ish attacks were repulsed and that
Langemarck is still in German hands.
This claim of the German general staff
is officially denied in London, which
says the British hold not only Lange
marck, but also ground beyond the vil
lage. London also officially denied
that the fighting front was 20 miles
long as Berlin declares. Field Mar
shal Haig On Thursday reported the
fighting front in the Ypres area as be
ing nine miles in length. The German
general staff reports Thursday's fight
ing was a "full victory" tor the Teu
tons, although admitting small de
feats. Between Loos and Lens the Cana
dians are plugging away toward the
capture of the last named town. They
have consolidated and made sure of
their recent gains and have made fur
ther progress west of Lens. The num
ber of prisoners taken here by the
Canadians now totals 1120.
Advance la Checked
The crown prince is not sure that
the French positions along the Aisne
front are invulnerable and his latest
attacks here have failed as did all his
previous ones. One German effort was
on a front of more than a mile In the
region Of the California Plateau. It
was stopped by the French artillery.
The French also checked a German
attack east of Cerny. The crown
prince took the initiative on the right
bank of tlft Meuse but his attacks were
broken up with losses.
The Austro-German offensive in
southwestern Goldavla apparently is
slowing down betOre the stubborn re
sistance of the Russians and Ruman
ians. The latter are still fighting des
perately in the area of Fokshani and
the Sereth river and Field Marshal
von Mackensen has made no further
appreciable advances. Petrograd re
ports the repulse of several attacks
in this area.

LOYALTY LEAGUE OF
AMERICA BRANCH IS
FOUNDED IN BISBEE
Workmen's Loyalty League
Supplanted by Larger Or
ganization Same Officers
Elected Rousing Meeting
Is Held.
Bisbee's Workmen's Loyalty league
is no 'more. Last evening at a meet
ing of the Organization, In the gym
nasium of the Y. M. C. A, it became
the Bisbee chapter of the Loyalty Lea
gue of America. Following the official
change of name the new organization
listened to several talks by prominent
members of the league.
The parent organization was formed
in Ph'oenix several weeks ago when
delegates from several cities in the
state met and perfected the Loyalty
League of America. M. W. Merrill of
Bisbee was elected president of the
state organization, and C. A. McDon
ald of Bisbee, treasurer. During the
past week branches have been put in
at Naco and at Douglas.
Merrill, who has been president of
the Workmen's Loyalty league since
its inception, was elected president 'of
the Bisbee branch of the organization.
William Tonkin was elected vice presi
dent, F. D. Lane secretary and Ben
McNelley treasurer.
Following the adoption of the dec
laration of principles of the parent or
ganization it was decided to formulate
by-laws for the Bisbee branch. It
was also decided to collect dues for
membership in the league. A commit
tee was appointed ' to supervise the
work of writing the' by-laws.
Charles McKeen of Lowell was the
first speaker to be called. Taking the
declaration of principles of the Loy
alty League of America he went inl'j
detail. Each point brought out in the
declaration McKeen explained and the
crowd of men in the ball applauded
his exposition of the document.
Captain Harry C. Wheeler, sheriff of
the county, was then asked to talk.
This he did in brief, forceful fashion;
only after he had been applauded tJ
the last point by the league. Sheriff
Wheeler expressed himself as being
thankful for the support accorded him
in the Warren district and declared
that it was but his duty. Many ex
pressions of regret were heard when
the sheriff announced that he would
endeavor to get into the army in the
next six weeks. -
Following the sheriff, William Gunn
spoke and next in order was Dr. N.
C. Bledsoe, wbft urged the Loyalty
league and its membership to be eter
nally vigilant. The Rev. W. S. peath
eridge of the Christian church pleased
his audience by some appropriate .re
marks and M. W. Merrill, president of
the league, made the final talk of the
evening.
Before adjournment was taken the
president announced that plans were
being made for a big gathering at the
city park on Sunday night He asked
for an expression as to the best time
to obld it. On a rising vote the league
decided that it should be held at 7:30
o'clock. Final arrangements arid defi
nite announcement will, be made this
evening and tomorrow morning regard
ing the meeting.

work was nil, but on the other band
Sur batteries were doing excellent ex
ecution against the enemy guns which
was indicated by the diminution of
their firing as the battle progressed.
As early as 6 o'clock I saw one big
German gun being hastily removed
from the hight north of Langemarck
and rushed to a position further back.
I know other guns were pulled back
to emplacements in the rear."
LONDON, Aug. 17. The British Of
ficial bureau tonight denies that the
Germans have recaptured Langemarck,
Belgium. Concerning a report in the

the forces of Crown Prince Rupprecht
had retaken the town, which was cap
tured by the British Thursday, the of
ficial press bureau issued this even
ing the following communication:
"The German wireless official com
munication today contains a series of
mis-statements. The right flank of
the allied attack on Thursday was on
the Ypres-Menin road. There was no
attack between this road and the River
Lys. The enemy, therefos, nearly
doubled the length of the front of at
tack. "The enemy has not recovered
Langemarck, nor did he make any at
tempt to do so. A British staff Officer
reported at 6 p. m. today that he had
just returned from Langemarck, where
he had been for five hours.
"The British troops hold not only
Langemarck but a considerable length
of the Giman offensive posit.On ouO
yards north of Langemarck.'

ELEVEN RETURN TO
BISBEE FROM CAMP
AT COLUMBUS, N M
Five Found Guilty of Va
grancy and Given Heavy
Sentences Four Take
Draft Examinations and
Two Own Property.
Eleven men, deported from Bisbee
on July 12, returned to the Warren
District, Thursday night and yesterday
morning. All were arrested on war-
rants charging - them with vagrancy.
Five were found guilty and given sent
ences of ninety days each, with the al
ternative of leaving the camp. Four
returned to take the draft examination
and two, being property owners, were
dismissed from the court.
One of the four men who returned
to take the physical examination in i
the draff tnlrl nnp of the officials, ves- !
terday, that he was through with the
I. W. W.
"I am an ex-soldier and I am going
to join the army, get away from this
locality and forget my experience with
the Wobblies which has been one
event in my life that I am thororugh
ly ashamed of said the man.
i "I was working here and when the
strike was called I, with a number of
others, went out. It was moral in
timidation which caused hie to quit
my work." I was deported to Colum
bus and, after a few days, began to
realize what kind of a crowd I had
thrown in with. I am through with
that kind and hope that the record will
not follow me into the army."
One of the men who returned had a
peculiar experience. He was a Mex
ican and employed in the Warren Dis
trict. He heard, on the morning of
the drive, that his father had been put
into the detention camp at Warren
Park. As the men were leaving the
Park for the train, the younger man
got Into the line and attempted to per
suade his father to leave it. His fath
er refused and when he attempted to
get out he found he could not and
went into one of the cars with them.
His story was substantiated to the
point that he was working to the ver
last day and the court dismissed the
charges againsta him and allowed him
to return to work.
Two other men had property in Bis
bee and the charges of vagrancy wert
dismissed against them. The other five
consisted of "floaters" and the charg
es were pressed. In each case a ver
dict of guilty was returned. The sent
ences were ninety day with the alter
native of af speedy departure' from tha
Warren District.

NEW YORK. August 17 The rather
insistent talk that the price fixing
program of the government in respect
to steel manufacturers will be along
rather reasonable lines, promoted
much short covering in the steel share
today at the same time inducing a
moderate amount of buying for long
account. The strength in this par
ticular department did not inspire
buying of consequence in other indus
trial shares and final prices in most
instances showed but slight variation
compared with .yesterday's closing
quotations. Indirect contrast to the
form displayed in the industrial
shares was that exhibited in the rail
road quarter of the list, where, in
many instances, sharp declines were
recorded, especially in the shares of
railroads obtaining much of their rev
enue from their affiliation with highly
renumerative coal properties. In the
past 18 months railroads have control
or owning large coal properties have
established large quantities though
the rather fancy prices obtained for
this product and now that the govern
ment is contemplating taking drastic
action in an eoffrt to regulate coal
prices it is only natural to believe
that considering heavy exports incur
red through the working of the Ad
amson eight hour law and other high
operating costs that net returns will
propably compare .rather unfavorably
with that of heretofore.

BRADSTREET'S REPORT. .
NEW YORK, Aug. 17. Bradstreet's
tomorrow will say:
New business which is increasing in
wholesale lines is streaked with con
servatism, but optimism as to fall
trade has not abated, the crop situa
tion is better, governmental buying is
expanding and industry, taken as
whole, continues very active.
Most reports regarding wholesale
trade while admitting lack of snap,
agree that business is good, being rel
atively better in the crop growing sec
tion than elsewhere and it is general
ly felt that fall trade will be of large
proportions.
Except where army camps are lo
cated, retail trade is not above fair.
Labor is scarce, is inefficient and the.
situation is marked by considerable un
rest while mobilization under the draft
will further reduce supplies in this re
spect ' In the iron and steel indus
tries, new. domestic buying is light

PETROGRAD, Aug. 17. Further de
tails are published concerning the re
moval of Nicholas Romanoff from the
former Imperial palace at Tsarsk'oe-
Selo. When the train which was to
carry the former emperor arrived it
bore prominent placards and contain'
ed one armored car, and on the plat
form of each car were four soldiers
with fixed bayonets. The former em
peror at the last moment, says tbe
newspaper, begged to be allowed to
reside in the Crimea, but this was re
fused. As the train pulled out the
soldiers shouted derisively at the for
mer ruler of Russia. The location of
the new prison remains a mystery, but
the Impression grows that it will be
Siberia. It is said that at tbe differ
ent Imperial palaces at Tsarskoe-Selo,
Peterbof, Gatchina, Livadia and else
where, there are 25,000 servants, near
ly all of whom have lost their means
of livelihood through the successes of
the revolution.

THE TEST THAT TELLS
Is tha Teat of Time. Many Bilbao
People Have Made This Teat. .
Years agb this Bisbee ckizen told,
in a public statement .the benefit de
rived from Doan's Kidney Pills. The
statement is now confirmed the testi
mony complete. Instances like this
are numerous. They doubly prove tno
merit of Doan's Kidney Pills. Can any
Bisbee reader demand more convinc
ing proof? It's Bisbee testimony it
may be investigated.
A. E. Crawford, tailor, 179 Temby
Ave., Bisbee, says: "I had severe
pains in my back and sharp twinges
would shoot up between my shoulders.
This made my work very hard. I used
Doan's Kidney Pills as directed and
they were just what I needed. They
entirely cured the back, trouble and I
felt better all over." (Statement given
May 9. 1913.)
On February 14. 1917 .Mr. Crawford
said: "I recommended Doan's Kidney
Pills about four years ago and I am
now glad to say that I think as much
as ever of them. They put my kld
neyi in good shape and occasional use
since has kept my kidneys in gotod
condition."

THE PRICE OF PEACE
Peace is not a gift; it must be won. This is the
stimulating rallying cry of the United States. It ani
mates the legions that are to lay the heavy hand of
force on the instigators of war. The spirit of peace
thus needs her human instruments of restoration, and
never before has her dependence and her challenge
seemed to rest bo equally upon women and men alike.
Th man with the gun and the woman with the sootli-
, ing hands symbolize the many groups of man labor and
woman labor entrusted with the great task. Crisis
brings them shoulder to shoulder. Victory will bring
them equal honors.' Peace will owe to both an equal
debt Atlanta Constitution.
To Put the Kibosh On
LaFollette
No man ever lived who loves and courts and lives
upon publicity as does LaFollette, the traitor senator and
pacifist from Wisconsin. It is the air he breathes and
the life blood of his body. Newspaper men who know
him well and who have traveled with him in campaigns
are all agreed upon this fact.
Therefore, the mo3t effective way to squelch him,
to throttle him, to let the steam out' of his boilers, is tj
ignore him.
When the senate leaders knocked him out of h3
planned four-hour speech at the end of his filibuster
against the declaration of war they hurt hlnl worse than
all the abuse of all the written or spoken words of thj
country could have done.
If the newspapers ol the country would only unite
' upon the proposition never to use his name again in their
columns they could, by that decision, hurt this iron-jawed,
pernicious windbag more than by any other human means
short of interning him along with our other enemies.
Perpetual silence; the mysterious, compelling shadows of
oblivion, these are the most terrible form of punishment
that can be employed against certain men.
pfiicers in the army who commit certain breaches
of etiquette against mess traditions are treated in this
way; compunchers in camp in the old days were also
thus placed beyond the pale. The effectiveness of this
treatment has never failed.
Henceforth the name of LaFollette is barred from the
columns of the Review, no matter in what connection
it may come to this office over the wires or by mall or by
hearsay. Only a drop in the bucket, you say? Ah, but
if every editor will make and keep this same resolve, the
fangs of this traitor senator will be effectively drawa
and his punishment be made commensurate with his
crome of betrayal of a great public trust.
Speaking of rents, and people who have to rent houses
i In the Warren district have considerable to say on that
subject, for rents here are very high. New York City
faces the problem of keeping the rents in that great me
tropolis down to figures within reason. It is estimate
that New York will have to spend one hundred and fifty
million dollars for new flat houses for two hundred and
fifty thousand persons the next year in order to hold
down rents. New Yorkers of responsibility and foresight
and faith see this problem before them dnd are preparing
to meet it. Investigations by realty boards there have
disclosed these conditions and immediate action is de
manded by these boards and by the papers. On a smaller
scale, but none the less imperative, this condition faces
the Warren district Are we going to build upon a scale
demanded by conditions, present and future, or are we
, going to let rents soar and see the 'district suffer as a
consequence?
According to the 1917 Federal Council year book there
are nearly 1S.000.000 Methodists in the United State.
The Baptists are the second among the Protestant de
nominations with a total oi 12,000,000. From this it would
seem that the war has not had a bad effect upon the
Protestant church of America.
MADE IN GERMANYl
(New York Times.) '
Treasonable attempts to aid the enemy by false rep
resentation of American public sentiment, and to sway
that sentiment by insidious means, are redoubled as Ger
many pants more feverishly for a German peace. Our
Russian mission warns us of the harm such lies may do
the cause of freedom in Petrograd. State governments
are asked to co-operate lit running skulking enemies to
earth. Britain faces in the Henderson incident a striking
proof of the danger lurking in malign or unskilful han
dling of premature peace attempts and negotiations.
And a senator of a great state, a member of the
treaty-making branch of congress, chooses this tense mo
ment of the entry of American democracy into a world
war for freedom, when there is utmost need of patriotic
and general support for prudent handling of the nation'?
foreign relations, to introduce peace resolutions which
urge the surrender of the national cause!
Mr. LaFollette's preamble is untrue; but its untruth
plays into toe blood-stained, desperate, eager hands of
the German war party in spurring the flagging spirit of
the German people to further resistance. His resolutions,
repugnant to the country, have no chance of passage; yet
they have already served their purpose; their introduc
tion, in one sense vain, is not vain to German war lords
who know bow to magnify the station and power of a
senator, and make the most of what is said here in his
behalf.
And what will be said here, and by whom? Besides
a little dwindling band of honest pacifists, the resolution
will win the praise of the pro-German Socialist faction;
of draft-dodgers and their war brides; of the I. W. W.;
of bomb-plotters-who have blown American workmen limb
from limb to cripple war industries; of all that malign
crew which has burrowed underground to aid in sinking
our ships, and murdering our citizens, and stirring up en
mity in Japan and Mexico, and signalling the movements
of American troops for the lurking torpedo. From all the
enemies of the nation, open or concealed, bought or
born so, active or inert, this counsel of confusion will have
support and from these alone.
There is in Mr. LaFollette's bad day's work a vein
of sentiment little known in modern Prussianism. For
the rest, it might have been written by Chancellor
Michaelis. If there were a statute for the declaration of
origin of ideas, as of insensate merchandise, it should r
labeled. Made in Germany!

STORIES OF BISBEE
Yuma Sun Prints Story of One
"Bogartus " Which Investi
gation Locally Fails in Any
Way to Substantiate.
(MORE OPTIMISMS
Henry Clews, the New York banker, places his prac
ticed finger upon the nation's pulse this week and pro
nounces the following:
"These are the main factors in the present business
situatio:n
"A highly profitable harvest for grain, cotton, fruits
and vegetables.
"A sound financial situation.
"Great industrial activity arising from war expendi
tures of $10,000,000,000 or more.
"Steady growth of government control over industrial
movements and prices.
. "The outlook of the market is somewhat confused by
numerous cross currents. As shown above, the agricul
tural and industrial interests of the country are sure of
a season of great prosperity, which will be reflected in
all the distributive branches of trade. The chief offsets
are government regulation of industry and trade and the
diversion of capital from new Industrial developments to
war purposes. Some Inconvenience may be felt by the
withdrawal of labor for army purposes; but this on the
other hand will be offset by various economies, by cur
tailing the production of unnecessaries and by the intro
duction of labor saving devices. ' As for government regu
lation of business, that should now be a factor of dimin
ished uncertainty. The limitations and methods of tfucb
regulation are already known. They are left largely as
the discretion of the president He may or may not exer-
else these powers.. Thus far, the administration ! has
shown a disposition to use these powers wisely and in
moderation, and to prevent excessive and unfair profits
rather than to prevent fairly liberal returns, which are
often justified by the necessities and unusual risks cre
ated by war. Midsummer quiet prevails at present, but'
before very long activity should be upon the ascending
scale.
"There are in Washington today a large number of
our ablest business men serving the country patriotically
and without profit to themselves. Their presence in
Washington should be assuring, since they wfll bring the
government in close touch with big business, thus avoid
ing misunderstandings and facilitating mutual aid and fair
play."
No better or surer wsy of judging the progress of the
war and noting which way the scales of ultimate victory
lean can be gained from a scrutiny of the values of an
English pound and a German mark in Armsterdam, a
neutral city, situated about half-way between London
and Berlin. The English pound In Amsterdam has never
shown a greater depreciation than ten per cent, and at (evident that he bruised himself either

That the I. W. W. or some of the
men who have been in' Columbus for
weeks, past, have adopted a press
agenting scheme becomes apparent
from the new stories which are to be
seen in various papers, throughout
the country and particularly in the
southwest. One of the last spurious
stories to be printed is found in the
Yuma Sun, of Yuma, Arizona.
It deals with a man by the name of
Bogartus,. initials unknown. The
story follows:
A miner named Bogartus just from
Bisbee yesterday told the officers
story that makes the blood boil, and
after doing so exhibited some of the
bruises and scares on his person re
ceived at the sands ' of the Copper
Queen thugs operating in the Kingdom
of Cochise under the guise of "Loy
alty Leaguers."
"This man said he formerly worked
in Bisbee and went there to see his
sister who is ill. He was not con
nected with the striking I. W. W.'a
and does not even belong to that or
der. He belongs to the Western Fed
eration of Miners. He said he bad in
no manner made any trouble and did
not intend to. In fact, he said be had
concluded to go to .work, there if ho
could find a clear way to do so. As
soon as he arrived in the city of Bis
bee, however, he was approached by
an armed guard and asked as to his
identity. He told them who be was
and mentioned the sad mission which
brought him to town. They searchec
him, and finding a union card on his
person, marched him out of town, fit
ing all kinds of questions at him as
they went. He declared he answered
their queries as best he could and
without acrimony, but they seemed to
be enraged that he was a union man
and pounced upon him, beat him all
up, tore the clothing nearly off his
body, -and perpetrated other outrages
such as intended to make a man, un
der favorable conditions, kill some
one. Now you get out and never
come back here. II you value your
life,' they told him. and taking them
at their word he kept going, and when
in Yuma said he was proceeding to
San Francisco.
"Thus the echoes of. that lawless
section of Arizona, where even tho
governor of the state is defied by out
laws, and being heard far and near
from the lips of men who have been
outraged beyond the power of words
to describe. By all means President
Wilson should send federal troops to
Bisbee to bring order out of existing
anarchy."
In the first place no such man as
"Bogartus" is on the I. W. W. role, en
It appeared in Bisebee. There is no
record of such a man having been de
ported or of having any connections in
the Warren District. -
Moreover, investigation has failed to
uncover any 'sick sister" referred to in
the article of the Yuma paper. The
fact that Bogartus failed to give the
paper any initials, or any other facts
other than those fancied leads
many local people to discredit even
the name. -
The Tombstone Prospector, in com
menting on the story, has the follow
ing to say:
"A recent issue (of the Yuma Daily
Sun gives a graphic account of the
hardships a man by the name of fto
partus experienced in Bisbee recent
ly. When read here the article at
once attracted attention because of
the fact that it appeared right after
Windy Bill Cleary passed through

HASSAYAMPERS HAVE
ANNUAL ROUNDUP
Hassayampan8, more than 2000
strong, form every section of Arizona
and from every walk la business and
social life, also of every age, from
Baby McCoy, two months old, to white
haired Capt Chas. A. rbntgomery, 83,
gathered at Santa Monica Saturday for
the great annual outing of Arizonans
now residents of Los Angeles.
Although Governor Thos. E. Camp
bell of Arizona could not be present
because of industrial troubles in that
state, and Charles T. Connell, presi
dent of the society, was absent on busi
ness in Alaska, the Hassayampans en
joyed the day to the fullest, hundreds
disporting in the ocean and others find
ing pleasure in the amusement places.
None of the Hassayampans had any
doubt as to the greatness of the state
of their nativity, but if they bad it
would ahve been dispelled by the efo-
quence of Charles Roy Morfoot, for
merly of Bisbee and now a Los An
geles attorney, who presided as chair-j
man of the day.
Col. R. Brown also made generous
use "of superlatives in impressing up
on the large gathering the sterling
qualities of character acquired by resi
dence in Arizona, and the richness of
the country which hag within the
boundaries of that fair state. -

POPE WILL NOT OFFER
PEACE PROPOSALS AGAIN
(By Review Leased Wire.) !
CHICAGO, Aug. 17. His first at
tempts 10 eud tile war having failed.
Pope Benedict declared he would not
again offer peace proposal until re
quested to do so by one of the bellig
erents, according to Herman H. Kohl-
saat, a former Chicago publisher, who
related today a conversation with Dr.
Francisco de la Barra, forme Mexican
ambassador to the United States.
While enroute from Europe in Febru
ary. 1916, Dr. de la Barra told Mr.
Kohlsaat he had called on the pope
and broached the subject of peace.
'The pope, according to the Mexican
ambassador, said he had suggested one
or two peace moves, but had been
treated coolly by the belligerents and
that he was through offering peace, de
claring that he would not again men
tion peace unless he was requested
to do so by one of the belligerents."
GLAD T0JEST1FY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To What
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. W. Gladwell,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till I
took three ... I gained, and was well
and strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
I am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. I am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
sthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
ailments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

NEW FAMILIES COMING IN
It is plainly evident that Bisbee is
filling up with reliable men with fami
lies from the appearance 'on the streets
daily of trucks and transfer wagons
loaded down with household goods that
have been shipped in from other parts
of the country. Houses are in great
demand, while the apartment houses
are all about filled up. There is a
great demand for furnished houses.
WHY DRUGGISYS ARE POOR
According to an authoritative article
in the current Issue of the Bulletin of
Pharmacy, exhibited by a local drug
gist today, the average increase in the
price ot drugs since the European war
began has been 503 per cent The in
creases range all the way from 33 per
cent to 300 per cent Local druggists
say retail prices have not been ad-1
vanced nearly In proportion with the1
advance in wholesale prices. This prob-1
ably explains why Bisbee druggists are
riot able to buy automobiles more ex-
pensive than Packards nor take vaca-1
ttons longer than three months a year.
FINED $300
Xamie Robertson, who has been con
ducting a place near Ft. Huachuca
and who was recently arrested by the
U. S. authorities on a charge of run
ning a disorderly house within the pro

perior court on the charge of selling

selling charge she would still be held.
Francisco Espinosa, wli'o was given
330 days for assault, was also taken
along by the officers.
BUTTONS ARE OUT
The exemption buttons made by the
government a cut of which appeared
recently in the international, have ar
rived in Bisbee. Several of the ex
empted men have put them on, after
obtaining them from the exemption
board at Tombstone. They are small,
neat and inconspicuous. They came
with the discharges. Some of the dis
charged men, however, do not like the
idea of wearing them and don't. .
A VISITOR FROM THE EAST
O. V. Bellows, a well known capi
talist and business man ot Springfield,
Mass., is in Bisbee this week looking
after his interests here and admiring
the scenery and enjoying the t'ool and
pleasant summer climate of the moun
tains. He has traveled over a greater
part of the world and is a most inter
esting talker and close observer. That
he likes our city, our courage and our
prosperity is saying n'ot a little in our
behalf.

known. In a letter to the various
