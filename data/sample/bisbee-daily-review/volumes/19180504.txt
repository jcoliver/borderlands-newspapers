Lord Robert Cecil Predicts
New Teuton Move Toward
Ending War; First Hope to
Establish Rule in East
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON. May 3 In the person il
opinion o Ijord Robert Cecil, minister
cf blockade, the failure of Germany's
"knockout offensive" on the western
front wifl result is a big peace offen
sive, directed mainly against Great
liritain and po'sRibly made in an at
tractive iorm. but which will not af
idid anv terms the al-ies can look at.
In this opinion, made in a statement
to the Associated Press, Lord Rob
ert expressed the further belfcf that
he new peace offensive would be
largely for German consumption, be
cause "the rulers of Germany know
if they have to rely on their own re
sources they cannot bold out mucn
longer.
Will Rule In Eat
"Personally," Lord Robert contin
ued, I always expected a. peace
movement as the immediate conse
quence of the western offensive. It
evidently is part ,of the enemy's plans
but I think it is mainly intended for
home consumption. It is extremely
rash to prophesy on anything con
nected with this war. but. again ex
pressing my personal opinion, I be
lieve the German general Idea Is to
continie the fighting in the west until
thev lave got ewplete commercial
hold in the east
"They hope to establish themselves
with a" Germ?opV.ile government in
Russia, and, with that country .once oa
its legs, and its resources ; behind
thetu, tbey believe there is no reason
why they should fight the world for
ever and be unconquerable."'
SIZES UP SITUATION
I-ONDON, May 3. A representative
of General Radcliffe, director of mil
itarv operations at the war office, to
day summed ud the military situation !
on the western front as follows:
"In the north while the Germans
failed in their objective they made
their right flank secure by the cap
ture of Kemmel, but we must regard
the operation from the viewpoint of
economy of men an dthey used up
five divisions from the general re
serve besides seven or eight divisions
previously employed."
"The result of the past week on the ,
whole were satisfactory because the
enemy used up a larger number of
fresh divisions than the allies, without
Btragetic result. In all he used on tne
north front 35 fresh divisions, besijes
the nine division salready there.
Have Fresh Divisions
"The effect of the operations in the
north will be to reduce materially the
number of fresh divisions the Ger
man shave available.
'As to the future, the Germans have
large numbers of divisions recovering
which can be nsed shortly. It is diffi
cult to make an exact comparison of
the staying powers of the two armies,
but the facts shown are in our favor.
If the enemy continues his offensive
in the north, he must impair his
chances of success in the south.

WASHINGTON". May 3. Shijmwn
ers and representatives of the Sca
nreu's ufion got together on many vit
al questions today at the labor con
ference, with the result that Andrew
Kuruseth. president of the I"""""
a harmonious condition as possible had
been obtained on the eve of the tre
mendous expansion of the American
merchant marine. Wage differences
have been ironed out and plans laid
for recruiting men to operate the new
ships. , i .
The only problem toward the solu
tion of which no program has ben
made is the controversy between the
unions and the lake carriers' associa
tion. The association, which sent no
representatives to the conference, was
charged today by Victor Olander of j
the Lake Seamen's union, with hinder
ing the conduct of the war by drain-,
ing the Atlantic coast of seampn by j
higher wapes and shorter hours.
Chinese crews in Pacific boats oc-1
cupied much of th afternoon discus-1
sion. Mr. Furuseth charged they were
used because they were cheop. Cap-
tain John H. Rider of the Pacific Mail j
line, replied that his company prefer
red them to Americans wno naa oeeu
displaced on some boats, -only because
they misbehaved and failed to give
service. He denied that opium rooms
and gaJiij'iing among the Chinese wen
allowed., but said that the company
maintained opium smoking rooms for
Asiastio steerage passengers.
Charges wers made by ' union of

HOSPITAL VESSELS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, May 3. German
charges that .American -aviators are
crossing to Europe as members of the
Red Cross on hospital ships were oiii
cially denied today by the state de
partment and proof of the allegation
was demanded of the German govern
ment through Spain.
The fact that thje state department
took notice of the dispatch sent out
by the 'German wireless was taken in
official quarters as an indication of the
seriousness with which the depart
ment regards the apparent intention
of the German government to pave
the way for attacking American hos
pital ships in violation of the Geneva
and Hague conventions.
In explanation of the German state
ment that an American aviator
brought down in the region of the
army of General Von Hutier carried
a pass which referred to him as a
member of the American Ambulance
service for France, it was declared
that this might be true, and at the
same time perfectly proper. Before
the United States entered the war a
.umber of young Americans went to
France and entered the hospital and
ambulance branches of the allied
armies, rendering splendid service
for which many of them received dec
orations from the French and British
governments.
After America's entrance into the
conflict some of these men joined Gen
tral Pershing's command in the ca
pacity fighting men which they had
no idea of doing at the time
they
crossed the Atlantic.

Suffering Described As Xorture
Relieved by Black-Draught.
Rossville, Ga. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, ol
this pla, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lifting, he in
jured himself with a piece of heavy ma
chinery, across the abdomen. He was
so sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 165 lbs., and fell off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had thrre different
doctors, yet with all their mc dicine, his
bowels failed toacL'.Tle would turnup
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without resuIL We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
I sant and bought Thedford's Black
Draught. I made him take a big dose,
and when it began to act he fainted, he
was in such misery, but he got reJif f and
began to mend at once. He got well,
and we both feel he owe3 his life to
Thedford's Black-Draught."
Thedford's Black-Draught will help you
to keep fit, ready for the day's work.

Germany's coercion of Holland by
means of menace and threat if the little
Dutch kingdom did not yield in the matter
of allowing Germairwar material to pass
through her territories, is but another page
turned for the world to see of the Prussian
policy of might is right. The full story of
all that Holland has had to endure from her
big neighbor has not been told, but merely
hinted at. It is declared that Holland's
ports and territory would have been seized
or violated long ago but that she has been
extremely useful to the Hun. Her ship
ments of foodstuffs into the land of the
blockaded Teuton have been enormous. In
fact, German bu'ers came right to the
Hague and outbid Dutch buyers and took
food badly needed by Holland, When the
American embargo against Holland went
into effect and food became corresponding
ly scarce, then the German mailed fist be
gan to menace Holland ih earnest. Her de
mands to violate neutrality in Germany's
favor became more frequent and unreason
able. Holland was not so useful as she
had been. Now, no one can live in peace
and happiness near the Hun unless they
bring grist to the Hunnish mill. It is also
a fact that many Dutch merchants were
guilty of most represensible profiteering
with foodstuffs sent from America in good
faith for Holland's use. Compared to Bel
gium Holland's course has been most mer
cenary all the way through. The Dutch are
staunch fighters when once they turn their
hand to war. A Dutch army of a million
men on Germany's flank might well change
the entire plan of the 1918 campaign. But
there is not much hope that Holland will -fight
unless absolutely forced into the .
war.
In the trial of the I. W. W. leaders at Chi
cago the government has presented its case
with a lash of scorpions. Disloyalty and
sabotage is alleged with the declaration that
there are abundant proofs behind to bear
out these statements. The government de
clares that these wobblies and traitors op
posed war plans, were open enemies of the
government and promoted strikes in the in
terest of this nation's enemies. Bill Cleary,
Hunt appointee, is defending these miser
able men, apparently with the sanctioned
good will, and certainly with the consent
of his patron, the governor of Arizona.
Contrast Hunt's position in this matter so
vital to America's best interests in the war
with the position Tom Campbell takes in
firing his opening gun of the 1918 guber
natorial campaign. It is enough to make
Arizona hide her head in shame, this posi
tion of her governor and leader of the Dem
ocratic party in the state. Hunt ha3 de
clared that he will dictate the next governor
of this state, and his candidates bear his
brand. And his friend and appointee, Bill
Cleary, stands before the nation as the de
fender of traitors of the most virulent and
despicable type. Can he get by with it?
This column does ntt think he will.
Great Britain has just set us an astonish
ing example of national grit and readiness
to make every sacrifice for victory by an
nouncing a budget of over $4,200,000,000.
the greatest in the history of the world.
This magnificent sum is to be raised en
tirely within Great Britain by a population
of only 48,000.000 of people. British war
expenses for the coming year are estimated
at $14,000,000,000, of which nearly one
third will be paid out of taxation. The
British debt now stands at 39 billions, in
cluding $8,000,000,000 loaned to the Al
lies. Our own expenses during the first
year of the war have been about $ 1 0,000,
000,000, nearly one-half of this represent
ing loans to our Allies. Our population is
approximately 110,000,000. This coming
year our expenses will surely be much larg
er than the sum just named, and we are
raising only about 14 per cent by taxation,
the remaining 86 per cent being provided
for by bonds. If Great Britain after nearly
four years of war with her smaller popu
lation and resources can successfully stand
such a huge strain, as .she certainly is, there
is no need to feel any anxiety concerning
the ability of the United States, which has
a much larger population, much greater re
sources and has not yet been wearied by
prolonged struggle.
THE JUNKER AND HIS CANNON
FODDER.
Over there on the Hindenburg line
there are gray-green masses of helmeted
automatons "human material" they are
designated yi terminology of the war lords
who are daily sent forth with gas and
flame and grenades and belching guns and
knives of steel to make offering of fheir
bodies for cannon fodder and to hack, hew,
mangle and exterminate other masses of
men, distinguished from them by uniforms
of a different color and helmet3 of a differ
ent make.
"Behind them," declares a writer in the
Kansas City Star, "are other more gaily
uniformed men who drive them to their
gruesome tasks with sharp cries of com
mand and hissings of scorn and contempt
if they falter or fail. And further in the
rear of the line, beyond the reach of shot or
shell, beyond even the echoes of the drum
fire, in luxurious apartments, with servants
and couriers, wines and warm baths, air
planes and motor cars ready at their beck
and call, sit other more gorgeously uni
formed men, with huge bodies and square
heads, bending over maps, writing, dictat
ing, bandying courtesies and exchanging
military pleasantries of speech. And in the
security and magnificence of his palaces
the supreme war lord holds council with
the high princes cf Junkerdom, at whose
behest the floodgates of hate and blood
were opened upon a peaceful 'world.
"And as to the why of it all? Ask the
supreme war lord and the princes in coun
cil and they will prate magniloquently of
God, kultur, the fatherland and world
power. Ask the square-headed generals
and they will .tell you of salients and sec
tors, masterly maneuvers, victory and Ger
man peace. Ask the little captains who
drive the men into the cannon mouths and
they will prate of duty, discipline, heroism
and iron crosses. But seldom does there
come a voice from those millions in gray
green. Theirs not to reason why, their3
but to do and die. And yet they have each
of them thinking minds beneath their
spiked helmets, and they must be thinking
strange and luminous thoughts, as they
march into the valley of death, linked cogs
in the kaiser's 'categorical imperative' ma-ine.
YOUNGEST LIBERTY LOAN WORKER
SELLS BONDS IN NATION'S CAPITAL
Vcung America will see no need to
worry about our relations with Holland.
For the result of the breach has resulted al
ready in an embargo on quinine.
An embargo on quinine? Oh, joy!
You'll never make Young America believe
that an embargo on quinine is a "blow."?
It is a victory for which Young America -has
been in perpetual warfare since there
was such a thing as Young America.
Now, if by some good fortune of war
an embargo should be raised by someone,
somewhere, against castor oil, Young
America would regard the fight as already
won and the world made safe for democ
racy. If the war banishes both castor oil
and quinine, you'll never make Young
America feel that there is anything left
worth fighting for. But if peace is to re
. store the free and unlimited coinage and
traffic in quinine and castor oil, then put
Young America down a convert to militar
jsm. For that part of democracy included
in Young America will never feel safe from
discord and revolution as long as it is pos
sible for an enemy doctor to prescribe
quinine or castor oil for internal complica
tions. Kansas City Star.
The good ladies of the Red Cross at
Hereford write as follows to the Review:
"Your WTite-up in the Review of April 1 4
on the Garces-Hereford Auxiliary of the
Red Cross was appreciated by the members.
It has encouraged them to renewed effort
and has been the means of bringing in new
members. We thank you for it." This edi
tor takes off his battered Stetson to these
ladies and bows low. It is both an inspira
tion and a pleasure to work with them in a
great cause.
It is said that the Bolsheviki govern
ment of Russia proposes to adopt the red
flag as the emblem of the alleged republic.
It is the proper flag for Russia as long as
she suffers her present rulers to remain in
power. The red card for the wobblies and
the red flag for the Bolsheviki; well, they
are brothers, so why not?
The German newspapers feei sorry for
Holland because they are afraid England
will violate its neutrality and thus make
it another Belgium. Solicitude like that
makes things look bad for Holland.

Here, at last, is the truly great picture of these greatest days in all history the
picture for which the whole world has been waiting. The picture that does what no
book could ever do what no stage play could do what oceans of oratory could not do
what printed stories of atrocities or photographs of battlefields and ruins could not do.
The picture for which the whole art and science of the moving picture now seemed
to have been originally designed in which they reach heights never before conceived in
character revelation.
The picture for which this and unnumbered generations to come will bless the film
because
It Strips Naked the Soul of History's

A hundred times more absorbing than ,any picture bound down to dates a hun

A Blazing Revelation of '

A picture of the secret instincts, the unholy desires of William of Hohenzollern, as
