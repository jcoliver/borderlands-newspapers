SMS TRIAL FOR
DISLOYALTY
OPEN
(By Review Leased Wire)
KANSAS CITY, Mo.. May 20. The
taking of testimony began today in the
trial of Mrs. Rse Pastor Stokes, wife
of J. U. Phelps Slokes, wealthy New
York socialist, on charges of violating
the espionage act.
In his opening address. Francis H.
Wilson, United States district attor
ney, said it would be shown that the
defendant in an address at Kansas
City, asserted that the Red Cross and
the federal food and fuel administra
tions were "war camouflage," that
American soldiers in France were
there to fight for capital, not for de
mocracy and that they had been lured
there by the slogan "make the world
safe for democracy."
" You cannot get the truth from the
press because it is controlled by profi
teers,' " the district attorney quoted
from plleged statements by Mrs.
Stokes, adding that she had asserted
that "if conditions in the United
States could be improved by a Ger
man victory, then I want Germany
to win."
Charges that the defendant had
stated there would be a revolution in
the United States before the ret in n
of the army from France and that she
had referred to the Bolshevik! govern
ment of Russia as "the only true de
mocracy." also were included in the
pi osecu tors' opening address.
Replying for the defense, Seymore
Stedman of Chicago, contended that
In expressing opposition to the gov
?rnnient. Mrs. Stokes used the words
"government" as it is used in England
not a sreferring to the state itself, but
as synonymous with "administration."
He said his client was opposed only

merit statistics to show that 33 com
panies have made $1,220,000,0(10 in div

defense are directors of these com
panies." Ralph E. Stout, managing editor of
the Kansas City Star, the paper to
which a communication on which the
indictment was based, was sent, was
the first witness called today. He
testified regarding the reecipt of the
communication and to having turned

War Summary
(By Review Leased Wire)
The allied armies are not permitting
the Germans to "get set" for a serious
blow at the western front. Here and
there along the line there have been
sudden blows at the German positions
and in all of them ground was cap
tured by the allies.
Fhe French have done most of this
work. On the front east and north
east of Locre, on the northern side
of the Lys salient in northern France
and just to the west of Kemmel, where
some of the most intense fighting pf
the war has been going on, the French
have advanced their line over a two
' mile front. Far to the south, near
Rheims, the French have advanced
into the enemy's positions as far as
the third line o ftrenches.
The Australians on the front before
Amiens have been active and . have
improved their positions.
Fighting Near Kemmel
Heavy artillery firing is reported
! from several points along the front,
it being especially severe near Han
gard and south of the Avre, 'near
Amiens. The Germans also report
heavy cannonading in the region of
Kemmel.
The American sectors have been the
scenes of fierce aerial battle. The
' Americans suffered a severe loss
when Raoul Lufbery of Wallingrord.
Conn., one of their most famous air
. fighters, went to his death in a thrill
ing encounter above the city of Toul. ;
The Germans have lost several ma- j
chines, one of which is believed to hej
the one that accounted for LufbPry.

The French troops in Macedonia '
have taken the offensive near Lake !
Oehrida and have advanced to a depth
of more than 12 miles at some points.
The object of this operation appears
to be the straightening of an awkward
salient in the line.

I TRUST WILL
NOT BE DISSOLVED
iKy Review loused wirPJ i
WASHINGTON, May 20. Through i
an opinion which some construed .is '
indicating a new attitude toward DU .
business and on which the court ai-;
vlded, four to three, the supreme court
today refused to order the dissolution
of the United Shoe Machinery coin-.
pany of Massachussetts, and its subsi-'
diaries, forming the so-called "shoe!
machinery trust." !
While admitting the magnitude of
the combination, the court declared its
growth resulted from efficient manage
ment and not oppression, and held that
the breaking up of such a concern un
der a dissolution order would be practically-
impossible.
This suit, instituted by the govern
ment in 1911. Is the first under th.?
Sherman anti-tmst act to be decided I
by the supreme court in 8 number of
years, and for the first time in recent
history a complete victory has been J
won by an organization by the govern
ment, in the proceedings the govern
ment not only sought the dissolution
of the company which it contended to
he an organization in restraint of trade
but also the abolishment of the so
called tying leases" by which tho com
pany retained control over shoe ma
chinery leased to shoe manufacturers.
The lower court decided in favor of
the company and dismissed the suit
The supreme court affirms that the
decision in the majority opinion ren
dered by Associate Justice McKenna
and concurred in by Chief Justice
White, and Associated Justice Holmes
and Vandeventer. Justices Day,
Pitney and Clark dissented, the for
mer in an opinion declaring that the
shoe machinery company does dom
inate the trade and that the tying
leases are a violation of the Sherman
law. Justices McReynoIds and Bran
deis did not participate, because of
;their previous connection with the
case, th former as attorney general.
Answering the government's conten
tion that the company is an organiza
tion in restraint of trade and should
be broken up as an unlawful trust,
the majority opinion declared "the
idea is repellent that so complete an
instrumentality should be dismantled
and its concentration and efficiency
lost,"
"The company," the opinion contin
ues, "indeed has magnitude, but it Is
at once the result and cause of effi
ciency and the charge that It has been
oppressively used is not sustained. Pa
trons are given the benefits of im
provements made by the company and
new machines are substituted for th
eld ones without proportional charge.
"These are some of the results of
the organization of the United com
pany." In dissenting. Justice Day declared
the "tying leases' tend "to prevent
the free flow of interstate commerce
and the natural course of its activi
ties at least tend to monopolize an'ini
portant trade."
In his opinion he added "the restric
tive and prohibitive clauses of tly?
leases are within the Sherman act. as
they are clearly in restraint of trade."

to the military, directly serving the '

of the risks of war.
Miss Alice Fitzgerald, R. N., the
Edith Cavell memorial nurse from
Massachusetts, after nineteen months
of work- in military hospitals in
France, wrote to her sister nurses in
the United States:
"The wounds which you will be
called upon to handle and dress are
such as you have never imagined it
possible for a human being to be a
victim of and yet live. If the man is
seriously crippled or disfigured, it
will be well to try" not to think too
much of his wife, cr his children, of
his parents, who are anxiously wait
ing for news of him 'over there.' If
the wounded man is going to die, shall
you be able to keep out cf your mind
the waiting mother or the wife to
whom tfe postman's knock will mean
the bearing of the sad news? Arj
when these thoughts are with you
most of your waking hours, and many
of your sleeping ones, ycu be?in to
wonder how it will be possible to face
another day of It.
"Fortunately, however, there is an
other side of the work which makes
it possible to face each day. There is
the man who Is getting better ami
who is happy in the near prospect of
getting home; there is the man whom
you did not expect to pull through,
who, by miracle or care, is goiiiT to
recover; there is the man whose
brave deed is immediately rewarded
by the formal presentation of a war
medal and the whole world U glad
with him and is cheered by the epi
sode; there is the man whose wife
and baby have been allowed to come
to see him, and every man in the
ward sm'les and longs to pet and
quiet it when it cries.
"If you feel that you can answer
the cail and see it through to the best
of your ability, and. in spite of all the
hardships, you will find it the most
satisfyine work that you have ever
done; and you will never regret hav
ing undertaken It."
Red Cross nurses slip off quietly to
their foreign service, like the soldiers.
Sometim"s they go singly, sometimes
in groups cf a hundred or more. Often
the city Is asleep, as our nurses, veri
table battalions of life, set sail for
France, their clear eyes turned to
ward the war, their hands steady for
the tasks that await them. They will
know what to do when the stretchers
come in; they will know what to uo
neu me ui)rruuuj ij ' v
each ether; they will know what to
do to ease agony, and bring comfort;
they will know how to give to every

ITALIAN FLOWER DAY
TO INCREASE MORALE
Distribution of flowers in the
green, red and white colors of the
Italian national emblem, in every city
of the United States on May 24, next
Friday, has been adopted by the Italian-American
society, Charles Hughes,
president, as a means of starting an
American propaganda in this country
to aid the Italians who are parrying
their full share in this war. The
Warren district will assist to the best
of its ability in this program of as
sisting or raising the Italian morale.
In a letter from Francis Markoe.
chairman of the woman's division of
the Vacation War Relief Committee.
r West Twenty-third street New
York. Mrs. V. K. M. Frantzen, of this
city, i3 urged to lend her aid and "se
cure assistance in promoting the Ital
ian flower day for Bisbee and the
Warren district. The letter says:
"Tho twenty-fourth of May has bees
chosen as Italian day and we are try
ing to arrange to distribute, all over
the country, flowers with the Italian
f-olors and have already enlisted thir
ty thousand florists.-
"I am writing you to ask if you
will he?n us in your state or city, in
Vrsonally collecting or, distributing
thpse flowers. They are to be given
away, 'not sold. It Is simply a question
rf propaganda to strengthen the Ital
ian morale."
Mrs. Frantzen.. will undertake the
collection and distribution of flowers
in this district. She will appreciate
gifts of flowers in the Italian colors,
and will personally see that every
flower obtained is worn by some per
son in tho district.

The Fifth Cycle
In these days of war, tremendous con
centrations and accomplishments, the im
portance of great historical events is apt to
be lost sight of by we who witnessed them.
Take the case of the first air mail service
installed between Philadelphia and New
York on Wednesday of last week. This is
an epoch in human affairs. It ranks with
the locomotive, the telephone and the
cable. It may well revolutionize our so
cial and business life. Air mail service!
Consider it. Speed at the rate of two hun
dred instead of sixty miles an hour. No
tracks, no roadbeds, no bridges. The first
mighty step from terra firma to the blue.
As great a contrast with the old service as
the express train was with the stage coach.
The development of the airplane in the
past three or four years has marked our
mightiest step in the past half century.
Consider, that there have been only two
real steps since the middle ages, and one
was steam and the other was- electricity.
Now comes the winning of the air. Only
three in all. All the multitude of inven
tions and innovations that have accompan
ied them have been only their children.
And if one goes back into that dim period
of the dark ages and gropes forward with
the slow and straggling procession of man
he will find only two lamps along the way.
One was the invention of printing and the
other was the mad friar's gunpowder. So,
if we have as many as seven scientific
wonders, and many learned men declare
we have not, the victory over the air surely
ranks as one of the immortal seven. Con
servative savants and psychologists assert
that we have passed through only four cy
cles of civilization and progress up to this
time, and these are, in the order named,
printing, gunpowder, steam and electricity..
Air flight makes the fifth cycle.
FITTS VERSUS F1TTS
William C. Fitts, assistant attorney gen
eral of the United States, who is in charge
of the prosecution in the cases in the U. S.
court at Tucson against certain Bisbee
residents charged with deporting I. W. W.
leaders and members and sympathizers
during the I. W. W. strike here last sum
mer, is placed by circumstances in a rather
peculiar position. In an address before the
Mississippi State Bar association, Mr. Fitts
gave the I. W. W. fits as follows:
"The I. W. W. have destroyed mining
machinery, especially in the copper mines
and in the mines where the minerals es
sential to the conduct of the war are mined
or produced. They have fired the forests,
particularly the forests of spruce; that
being the wood essential for making air
planes. They have destroyed saws in the
saw-mills by driving pieces of steel or iron
in the logs so as to break the. band saws
and unnerve the sawyers. They saw lum
ber shorter than standard lengths.
"The I. W. W. have surrounded court
houses and packed court rooms for the
purpose of putting over their plans. They
have taken possession of railroad 'trains
and assaulted and murdered the train
crews. They missend freight, misplace sig
nal lights, and put emery dust in journal
boxes on railroad cars.
"Members of the organization place
foreign substances in food in hotels and
restaurants, break crockery, dip table forks
in crude oil, use stinkpots in dining rooms
and put bedbugs in beds. They plant trees
upside down, hoe up potato vines instead
of weeds, bruise apples and other fruit in
packing. They remove units from care
fully adjusted machinery, misplace and
omit parts of copy' in printing offices and
put foreign substances in canned goods."
Mr. Fitts seems to have the I. W. W.
sized up to the full extent of all their harm
ful and vicious acts and propaganda. He
strikes straight from the shoulder. And :!
is a strange irony of fate that this same
orator should be placed in charge of a pro
z.ov
-7
iian 75 Cents.
r J J
the loyalty of
tKp state in a
secution of citizens who fought the I. W.
W. so effectively and so well. His chief
witnesses and complainants must, of ne
cessity, be I. W. V. leaders and sympathiz
ers. In fact, some of them must come from
Chicago, where they or their friends are
being tried by the government for treason,
to testify for the government in its case
against Bisbee.
It is so strange as to be almost startling,
this paradox.
HUNT DENIES
A telegraph dispatch from Phoenix last,
week says that Gov. Hunt denies most
emphatically that he ever said, "To hell
with the war," as Harold Lawrence, the
Flagstaff Normal instructor, is reported as
quoting him. Hunt also denies that he has
expressed sympathy with the Bolshevik,
although Jie does not, in this statement,
deny the many charges and hints of I. W.
W. leanings, sympathies and affiliations.
The governor is complainant in criminal
libel suits against the newspapers who used
the Lawrence statements. Lawrence, who
is in the east, ha3 been summoned back to
testify in these suits. The governor char
acterized the Lawrence statement as "a lie
without foundation" and also as "wantcn
nrinrv " Rut at that it seems as thoueh
' -
our governor was on the de
fensive in time of war instead of leading
virile and aeeressive offense.
He appears to be placed in a position where
he must deny instead of show the way to
the patriots of Arizona. This is an unfor
tunate state of affairs, both for the gover
nor and for the state, at this particuair
time. As he says, the governor may well
be falsely accused; he may well be the vic
tim of cruel and ruthless enemies, but even
so, his company and his acts, would not
seem to have been such as to lift him above
all suspicion cr to hedge him round about
with an impenetrable shield. . At least he
has been assailed, unjustly it may well be,
but assailed, nevertheless. But many men,
careless of their company and indifferent
of the streets they roam and the words
they say and the sympathies they express
and the letters they write, have been laid
open to suspicion and even to attack. Oft
en they have been proved innocent; often
guilty. But it is a fact beyond all dispute
or doubt, that public men and leaders who
have always carried themselves so as to be
far above and beyond suspicion of their
motives or loyalty, are more effective in
their leadership, especially in war times.
If a leader is assailed at home; if he must
stop to deny, he is handicapped sadly in
any effort to conduct a real offensive for
his state in the great war work of the na
tion. Lillian Gish, the famous movie star, is
in Paris, and has written a most interesting
and thrilling letter to her old home paper,
the Los Angeles Times, about her experi
ences and impressions in the queen of
cities. She visited the battlefield of the
Marne, and the scene moved this dainty
and beautiful lass to expression of senti
ment and patriotism and philosophy wor
thy of a Macauley. The sublime and the
ridiculous, slang and strong synonyms,
walk hand in hand through her letter, but
it is all the easier to understand and it
strikes all the harder against the cells of the
average mind. In her last paragraph the
fair Lillian, sitting at her desk in Paris, but
with her soul still on the battlefield of the
Marne, writes:
"But, believe me, that is as far as the
Germans will ever get, because the French
are going to keep on working, keep on
laughing, and keep on fighting: If you
will tell me how you are going to lick
people like that, whether they are in Mas
sillon, Ohio, or in France, you will tell me
something that I don't know. You just
can't do it that's all."
Marshal Ludendorf has been quoted as
declaring that he will sacrifice a million
Germans to reach the channel ports. Well,
that is fair enough. We will trade him
these ports for a million. It is a good price
for the ports. If he should take them at
this cost it would be a victory rather than
a defeat for the allies, for he could not hold
them long. Ludendorf cannot afford to
pay a million men for an advance. If he
does he will go bankrupt and the house of
Hohenzollern will come a cropper right in
the midst of its most daring speculation,
and what would it profit this house to cor
ner the market if the house itself falls into
ruin behind its own efforts. A million
indeed. Ludendorf cannot afford to lose
a half million men this summer unless in
the losing he destroys the allied armies, no
matter how far he advances his lines or
what towns or ports he may succeed in
wresting temporarily from France.
REGULTAiQNS FOR
REGISTRATION OF AiEH

Local Board Has Received In
structions Which Are Sim

Offljial regulations governing the
registration Jur.e 5, or all young men

tince June 5, 1917. have been received
at dratt headquarters in Tombstone.
The public resolution approved by
xa-jresa which provides for this reg
istrat'on contains the following pro
vision: "That during the present emerg
ency all mate persons, citizens of the
UnHed States, and all male persons
residing in the United States, who
have, since June 5, 1917, and on or
before the day set lor registration by
proclamation by the president, t
lainei the ape of III years shall be
subject to registration in accordance
w ita regulations to be prescribed by
the president, stating time and place
of such registration, it shall be the
duty o' all such persons, except such
persona es are exempt from registra
tirn under tho act of May 1, 1917, and
any act or acta amendatory thereof,
to pre.-?nt. themselves for and submit
:o registration under the provisions of
said act approved May 18, 1917. and
they shall be r?gistered in the same
manner and subject to the same re
cuPemcnts and liabilities as those
previously registered under the pro
visions of this act shall be placed at
the bottom of the ltet of those liable
fcr military service in the several
classes to which they are assigned,
under such rules and regulations as
the president may prescribe."
Tho;e who are required to register
rnd those who are exempt are de
sciifced as follows.
"Persons required to register. All
male persons, citizens of the United
States, and all male persons residing
in the United States, who have, since
June 5, 1917, and on or before the day
set for registration by the president's
proclamation, attained the age of 21
vears, must register. The only excep
tions are persons in the military or
naval service o; the United States,
which includes all officers and enlisted
men of the regular army, the navy,
the marine corps, and the national
guard and naval militia, while in the
service of the United States, and offi
cers in the officers' reserve corps anS
enlisted men in the enlisted reserve
corps while in active service.'
The place of registration is the of
fice of the local board having juris
diction of the area in which each per
son resides who is eligible to regis
tration. The time of registration is
beiween 7 o'clock a. ni. and 9 o'clock
p. m.. Wednesday, June 5, 191S.
With slight changes, ths method of
conducting the registration of next
month is practically the same as that
of the original registration last year.
That 3,5n0 young men in Arizona
have become of age since june 5,
1917. and are eligible to registration
is the opinion of officials 8t draft
headquarters in Phoenix. Deducting
the aliens and those physically unlit
and those with dependents, it is ex
pected that not more than 1,800 of the
3,500 who prabably will regiutsr, will
be placed in class 1, 3or military
service.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, TUESDAY MORNING, MAY 21, 1918.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, May 20. Stocks flue -
turned with extreme violence during
and falling several times on a farther
large volume of operations.
From a strong opening, based on
the libe'-al attitude of the administra
tion toward the railroads, the market
soon reacted. Partial rallies at mid
day were succeeded by more extensive
declines when rumors of friction be
tween the war board and steel and
producers gained currency. In point
of fact, reversals which ran from two
to six points were primarily due to
the marked change in financial condi
tions. Last week s extensive advance
afforded a foundation for fresh sell
ing of the more vulnerable issues, no
tablv industrials and equipments.
The more erratic features of these
groups included U-rted States Steel,
which made a net decline of 2Vi points
after having started with a substantial
gain. Standard rails cancelled the
greater part of their 1 to 1 point ad
vances. Sales 1,030,000 shares.
Time money was in scant supply,
but call loans were relatively easy.
Domestic bonds, including Liberty
issues, were aagin inclined to ease,
internationals also shading. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $5,650,0u0.
Unted States bonds, old issues, were
unchanged on call.

WAR SESSION OF
LEGISLATURE MAY

(Continued from Pase One)
will finally bear is now a matter of
considerable speculation.
It 1s known that the war depart
ment. Gen. Pershing and President
Wilson do not look with favor upon
any effort to hold elections at the
front or in France and this is ex
pected to have some bearing on the
provisions of the bill. Also it is now
censidered probable that most of the
Arizona men will be overseas before
even the primary is held in Septem
ber, so that there will probably be but
a small percentage of the soldier vote
cast.
I ills covering sabotage and loyalty
measures and the adoption of the pro
hibition amendment to tho federal
constitution are also being drafted by
('renin. These bills are being drafted
for various members of the legislature i
and will be introduced . by different
persons.

Listen : You feel poor. This third Liberty Loan, the high prices,

What? Then what did you mean? What's that you said about
loving your country? What did you think the word "sacrifice" means?
(Surely you didn't mean, did you, to give only what you can spare ?
What about our boys who are giving their Hves in the trenches?
Are they giving only what they can "spare' ?
How about those mothers and little "kiddies" in the shell-wrecked
towns of that war-swept hell: hungry ragged sobbing alone?
Giving up their homes, their husbands, their fathers.
While w e over here with our fun and our comforts we hold up
our head' and feel patriotic because we have given what? Sooa

I were in Tombstone yesterday as wit

WJiila the usual number of candi
dates is certain to appear in the bien
nial scramble for nominations at the
primary election, the probalities are
that th-.'re will be but few measures
to be voted on at the general election.
Up to the present time, but two acts
of the recent session of the legislature
are certain to be referred to the peo
ple for ratification and none has been
initiated.
The red light abatement act and the
act prohibiting card playing in places
of public amusement will ba referred
to the pn ple for ratification.
Of Initiative measures, no peUtions
have bee.i in general circulation up to
the present tme, and as but a short
while remains it is considered doubt
ful that any will be. Initiative peti
tions must be fited four months pre
vous to the date of the general elec
tion, which in the present instance
would mcke the final date for filing
niidnig.it of July 3.
The number of signatures to be ob
tained lor petitions for constitutional
amendment, iniative statute or refer
endum is governed by the number of
votes est for governor at the last pre
ceding general election at which a gov
ernor was elected. The total vote for
all candidates for governor at the elec
tion held here in 1916 was 58,29:5.
Constitutional amendments to be
suhmitteo" to the people require tha
signatures of 15 per cent of the vote
cast, which in this instance would be
S.744. .1 '
Initiativf- statutes require 10 per
cent, which would be 5.S.10.
Referendum requires a per cent, or
2.915.
The law requires that the primary
electioa shall be held on the eighth
Tuesday prior to the general election,
which this year fixes the date as Sep
tember 1:).
Nomination papers of candidates
shall b I led not more than 60 or less
than 20 days before the date of the
primary. Such nomination papers
shall be signed, if for a candidate for
the office of presidential elector.
