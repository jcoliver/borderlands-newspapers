MANDAMUS ARGUMENTS ARE
SUBMITTED 10 THE COURT;
G0fiir.1ITTEE TAKES ACTION
Arguments on Both Sides of
Governorship Controversy
Submitted to the Supreme
Court Decision Soon.
STATE COMMITTEE IS
STILL BEHIND HUNT
Legislature Expected to Take
Up Fight When O'Neil Res
olution Is Voted Upon
Definite Lines Expected.
(Special to the Review.)
PHOENIX. Jan. 10. Campbell's ap
plication for a writ of mandamus com
pelling Hunt to surrender the gover
nor's office was finally submitted to
the state supreme court late this after
noon following extended arguments by
attorneys for both sides. Hunt's at
torneys contended that Campbell was
not qualified to hold the office of. gov
ernor because he never tendered his
resignation from the state tax com
mission, while attorneys for Camp
bell argued that in taking the oath of
office and qualifying for governor he
abdicated his office as tax commis
sioner. The case was submitted on motion
of Campbell's attorneys to strike cer-'
tain paragraphs of Hunt's amended i
answer and the court intimated that
it would be three or four days before
a decision would be rendered.
" The question of recognizing Camp
bell as governor will be brought up in
the legislature tomorrow, . it was de
clared tonight. Campbell has enough
votes in both houses, it is claimed, to
gain recognition. .
A meeting of the Democratic state
executive committee was held here to
day to consider Hunt's action in re
fusing to surrender the office to Camp
bell. The meeting was packed' by
Hunt supporters who put through a
resolution declaring the meeting un
necessary and endorsing Hunt "as the
representative of the Democracy of the
state" in his contest for the governor
ship. The resolution was adopted by
a vote of 26 to 8.
Legislative Danger.
PHOENIX, Jan. 10. After a recess
of one day in which it was marking
time for the supreme court in the
mandamus proceedings began by T.
E. Campbell against G .W. P. Hunt, for
possession of the office of governor,
the legislature will assemble tomor
row morning at half past ten o'clock.
In the meantime there is no legisla
tive proceeding. No bills will be in
troduced and it is said tonight that
the introduction of bills will be dis
couraged until the status of the two
governors has been determined by the
court. Doubt was expressed though,
whether the legislature itself can be
held In check If there should be a long
delay on part of the court. Fears are
entertained by the leaders tonight that
an outbreak may occur at any time,
possibly tomorrow in the form of the
introduction of a resolution by Mrs.
Pauline O'Neill, Democrat, of Mari
copa county, recognizing Mr. Camp
bell. She has had such a resolution on
her desk since the opening of the ses
sion and was narrowly prevented from
offering it on Tuesday.
The mere presentation of it, it is
predicted, will start the trouble and
effect a lineup which, it Is feared, will
be maintained throughout the session
to the detriment of legislation. The
Democrats are nearly equally divided
in each house. Into Hunt and anti
Hunt factions, Bhown in the organiza
tion. It is not certain that all of -the
anti-Hunt Democrats would support
the O'Neill resolution, but there are
four Republican votes In the House
and five in the Senate that friends of
the resolution say would more than
offset any defection of the Democrats'.

Search for Thaw
Continues In Big
Cities of the East
His Whereabouts Unknown,
Though It Is Supposed He
Is at His People's Home in!
Western Pennsylvania. ' i
(By Review Leased Wire) j
NEW YORK, Jan. 10. The where
abouts of Harry K.1 Thaw, indicted
here on a charge of kidnapping and
assaulting 19-year-old Fred Gump, Jr.,
of Kansas City, Mo., remained a mys
tery today to the district attorney
and his fiy-ps of detectives who have
been searching for him although di
rectly or indirectly the police of all
cities have received notice that he
is wanted here.
Unofficially the belief was express
ed at the (prosecutor's office that
Thaw had made his way to his home
In Pittsburg and there under protec
tion of his family, undoubtedly was
being advised by competent counsel
as to what course to pursue. The au
thorities here made detailed examin
ations as to how it happened be slip
ped through their fingers when they
were "hot on his. trail." both here
and in Philadelphia.
His escape was explained by the
fact.tbey said, that since he was so
well-known they gave their chief at
tention to arresting the man known
to them as George O'Byrnes. indicted
jointly with Thaw on the kidnapping
count. While the police were wait
ing for an opportunity to catch
O'Pyrnes. Thaw escaped.
Shortly afterward a man answering
the description the Gump boy had
given of Thaw's companion, appeared
at Thaw's Philadelphia hotel and was
arrested on the assumption that he
was O'Byrnes,
He proved, however, j
to be Oliver Bower, formerly of Utica,
New York, also associated with
Thaw, but against whom there was
no indictment.
Although the arrest of Brower was
et first a disappointment, the district
attorney's men say . they found him
valuable in developing their case. A
number of documents and letters hav
ing an important bearing on Thaw's
relations with young Gump were found
in Brower's possession and some of
this evidence was presented before
the grand jury today. It was ex
nected that another indictment might
result.
Brower's movements were traced
snd it was found that subsequent to
the assault on Gump he had gone to
the hotel. Meanwhile, the authori
ties here sav O'Byrnes has disappear
ed They have no idea where he is
and no better descrlntion of him than
that given by the Gump boy to guide
them 1n the sarch.
Frank P. Walsh, counsel for Gump,
was in consultation throughout the
day with Assistant District Attorney
Wm. H. Black, who is presenting the
case to the grand jury. He refuses
to give any further details of the
information he has against Thaw,
saving that since it was inextricably
bound up with the matter now be
fore the grand jury it would be im
proper for him to say anything at
present.
On advices from Pittsburg that the
nolice there would not arrest Thaw
unless they bad a copy of the In
dictment against him, Mr.

SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 10. Franz
Bopp, German consul general here and
four of his' attaches or employes' were
found guilty tonight by a jury in the
United States district court or having
violated this country's neutrality.
"Guilty on all charges," announced
the foreman. A deep silence was
upon the room. All eyes were riveted
on Bopp to see how he would receive
the verdict.
All five defendants were accused ol
' having planned to blow up munitions
j plnnts in America and Canada, steam-
ships carrying supplies to the entente
allies, railroad bridges and military
trains.
Two actions were consolidated in
the trial. The defendants were charg
ed with a violation of the act of July
1910 by lOnspirinr to restrain inter
state and .foreign at .inmerce, by de
stroying factories, railroads and steam
ships. ; I '
The other action was for v alleged
violation of section's or V. S. 'penal
code in conspiring to set on foot and
piOvide and prepare means for a mill-
jtary enterprise to be carried on rrom
within the United States against the
territory and dominion of the king of
Great Britain and Ireland.
Besides Bopp, the defendants were

Bopp and von Schack were released
on their own recognizance. Mrs. Cor-

j quired to 'give (10.000 bonds at the
, time of their Indictment, were given
; their liberty on those bonds. The court
set Saturday to hear motions for an
appeal.
A crimson flush was the consul gen
eral's acknowledgement of the verdict
and a shrug tf the shoulders followed
by a sigh and the remark to von
Brincken
j None of the Jurymen would say how
' many ballots had been taken.
Consul General Boy said:

Herman F. Schueler, Member
of Department for 34 Years,
Succeeds Healey, Now Fac
ing Graft Prosecution.
(By Review Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, Jan. 10. Mayor Thomp
son tonight referred to a series of
questions regarding his knowledge of
alleged police grafts, 'asked of him
through the press, by State's Attor
ney Hoyne as "more slush" and said
that the answer to them was that he
had appointed Herman F. Schueler,
deputy superintendent of police, 'as
chief, to succeed Charles C. Healy,
resigned.
Schueler, a man of towering statue,
has been on the police force for 34
years. The mayor's letter of ap
pointment, which goes to the city
council for confirmation tomorrow,
stated that the chief would be solely
responsible for the enforcement of
the law.
"Clean out immediately, the corrup
tion in all branches of the depart
ment" ran the letter. "No person is
authorized to come to you, as repre
senting me. to ask for favors, nor
shall I ask any myself."
Chief Healy's resignation ante
dated his -arrest Monday night on
charges of grafting by about a
mouth.
Developments in the graft inquiry
today included, according to Mr.
Hoyne, confession by Thomas New
bold and Wm. Weinstein, owners of
questionable hotels. According to
Mr. Hoyne, Weinstein, through New
bold, paid $450 to obtain the transfer
or Captain Max Danner and Lieuten
ant Wm. Schumacher from the dis
trict where Wehisteln owns a num
ber of hotels. According to Mr. Hoyne
the money was paid to Costello. man
ager for Healy.
The chief said that his own inves
tigators were now at work; that he
was innocent and that he hoped to
unearth evidence which would put a
different aspect on the situation.

Cooperation With
Public Needed By
the Rail Interests
Railroad Executive Declares
That a Better Understand
ing Is Necessary Before
Companies Can Thrive.
(By Review Leased Wire)
LOUISVILLE, Ky.; Jan. 10. Frank
Trumbull, chairman of the railroad ex
ecutive advisory committee and chair
man or the board or directors or the
Chesapeake and Ohio Railway com
pany, at the annual dinner ot the
Louisville Transportation Club tonight
appealed for the co-operation or the
American people in solving the econo
mic problems confronting the rail
ways.
"They have," he said, "the oppor
tunity to accomplish the most import
ant piece of work since the passage
of the federal reserve banking act."
He asserted the greatest economic
problem the country faces Is in Its
transportation problem, the solution
jf which "Will require the intelligent
and unselfish co-operation of all the
many interests involved."
He declared it was the people's pro
blem, "just as vitally" as it was the
railway's problem, and that the policy
of the public of holding railroads as
system that they might properly
wring the last ounce of service at the
lowest cost has had but "one effect
which tSjday Is glaringly apparent"
"Today even after the most prosper
ous year in their history." Mr. Trum
bull said, "we find the railroads utter
ly unable to meet the demands of com
merce. Railroad efficiency has been
seriously impaired and railroad credit
injured so that the business or the
whole nation is suffering from the
lack or its fundamental need ade
quate transportation. To this state
ment doubtless the railroad critic
would reply that during 1916 the rail
roads earned over a billion dollars net
the greatest sum in their history.
This sounds impressive but it shows
a return of less than six per cent on
the railroad property devoted to the
use of the public and in fact
or a constantly rising cost or labor and
material, this margin or earnings is
bound to decrease."
Meanwhile, according to the speaker,
one motor company in 1916 had earn
ed 3.000 per cent on its capitalization
while scores or other corporations had
earned 50 per cent and more 'on their
common stock. In their investments,
he said, the American people had re
turned an obvious answer whether
they would place their money in "un
regulated private business showing
such returns or in the over-regulated
railroad business with its many un
certainties and relatively meagre re
turns. "It is the belier or the railroad ex
ecutives that if the railroads can be
relieved of the inefficient regulation
of 48 states and the federal tody and
this regulation be unified under one
head with regional sab-divisions, that
a great part of their present difficulty
will be removed. I'pon this platform
the railroads have taken their stand
and ask for the co-operation of the
people because the ' business of this
country can prosper tonly as it Is
adequately served by efficient tran
sportation." BOM BEXPLOSION.
TOLEDO. O,. Jan. 10 Four rooms
in a downtown hotel where strike
breaking linemen In the employ of the
Ohio State Telephone Company are
housed, were wrecked by a bomb to
night. The clerk at the hotel said that the
room in which the explosion occurred
was occuped by C. C. Connors, of
Cleveland, a marine engineer whose
boat is tied up here tor the winter.
Connors was uninjured. The bomb
fell into the room below which is oc
cupied by two strike-breakers who
were absent at the time. Two rooms
on the third floor and two directly
beneath them were wrecked. Doors
and windows were blown out and locks
were blown from the doors. Steam
and water pipes were broken off and
part of the hotel was flooded. Every
available policeman ln the city is now

Failure of Trepoff Cabinet Sets
Russia Wondering Where
Internal Politics of Empire
Will Finally End.
CONSERVATIVE MAN
NOW LEADS FIGHT
"Everything for War; Every
thing for Victory" Is Decla
ration of Prince Golitzine,
Latest Premier of Slavs.
By Review Leased Wire)
PETROGRAD. Jan. 10. (Via Lon
don) The political situation during
ithe last two months, for which the
word "crisis" seems entirely Inade
quate, has taken a new turn with the
resignation of Alexander Trepoff and
the appointment of a new premier.
The official announcement of this
change which has fallen upon the coun
try, continuously excited and emotion
ally exercised by the drama Ol swift
changes and climaxes, hardly created
the effect which would have been
natural under other circumstances.
This time the tide has suddenly
shifted and is running strongly in the
reverse direction. Prince Golitzine,
who succeeds Trepoff, is member of
the extreme conservative group, who
always manifested the strongest re
actionary principles, and as a member
of the imperial council, has always
shown little sympathy for the pro
gressive tendencies of the new regime.
The Ostensible reason for his replace
ment of Trepoff was the apparent in
ability of the latter to preervea
strong, united cabinet.
It has been known for some time
that there was a great divergence In
the point of view between two distinct
groups in the cabinet, in one or which
stood Trepoff and Ignatieff. and in the
other M. ProiOpopoff, the minister of
the interior. The fall of one group
or the other became essential. The
significance or this latest change in
the ministry can best be judged by
the following statements expressed by
Prince Golizine in an interview after
his appointment:
' "I have not yet had time to formu
late a program, but my watchword will
be 'everything ror the war; every
thing lOr victory.'
"Being occupied with this aim. we
cannot now think or reforms in the
interior. After victory we can begin
the reorganization or our civil lire."
The new premier said that he was
a firm believer in the responsibility of
ministery only to the will of the em
peror and that in this principle the
government must be united.
THE U-41 CASE.
BERLIN. Jan. 10. (Wireless to Say
ville) "The British admiralty." saya
an Overseas News Agency statement
today, "has declared that the German
reports regarding the destruction of
submarine U-41 and the ill-treatment
of Lieut Crompton and Jason Godau
were false. The official report of
Lieutenant Crompton. who is interned
In Switzerland, has now arrived and
fully confirms the German press re
ports.
"The attitude Of the British steamer
towards the U-41 as well as the bretal
treatment of the survivors on board
the steamer on the way to England
were even worse than previously had
been reported. The details show that
a treacherous attack wtfs made by a
British steamer which flew the Ameri
can flag while she was firing at the
submarine: they show also an at
tempt to ram a life boat with two
survivors, of whom one was seriously
wounded, the inhuman treatment of
them on board the steamer; the ef
forts made to cause the two unfortun
ate brave men to perish In order to
dispose of the last two eye witnesses
and prove that this British crime
against civilization and humanity far
eclipses even the Baralong and the
King Steven cases."
The Qrmian admiralty last fall
classed the sinking Of the U-41 as a
second BaratOng case, declaring that
a British patrol ship flying the Ameri
can colors, after destroying the sub
marine on September 24, 1915. deliber
ately ran down a life boat containing
the only two survivors. Ill treatment
of the prisoners after they "had been
finally picked up and taken on board
the steamer also was charged.

(By Review Leased Vi'lre)
AJO, Ariz.. Jan. 10. Bordering

Body Lies in State.
(By Review Leased Wire)
DENVER. Jan. 10. To add to her
measure of appreciation of what the
west owed him. the state of Colorado
will receive the body of Colonel Wm.
F. Cody (BuiTalo Bill), who did here
today, into her capitol Sunday there
to lie in state for four days.
Funeral services for the noted scout
are to be held Sunday afternoon, when
the body will be placed in a receiv
ing vault in a local cemetery, but
the burial will not take place until
next Spring, probably Decoration Day,
when the remains of Tone of the na
tion's most picturesque characters
will be interred in a tomb hewn from
a rock t the top of Lookout Moun
tain, near this city. Plans already
are afoot for the erection of a suita
ble monument at this final resting
place.
The funeral services Sunday are
to be held in the Elks Home in charge
of the Denver lodge of Elks. In ac
cordance with the wish of the dying
scout, however, all the societies to
which he belonged are to have a part
in his funeral, including Grand Army
of the Republic, the Pioneer Society
of Colorado, and the Cowboy Rangers I
of Denver, besides the Elks. The
Masons will have charge of the in
terment of the body In its tomb.-
Arrangements were made at a con
ference late today, following one with
Governor Gunter for the body to lie
in state in the capftS Sunday niorn-
ing from eight o'clock to noon,
Leaders of the House and Senate,
now in session here, attended this
conference, and agreed to secure the
nfcessary joint sessions of the leg
islature tomorrow. While the body
lies in state at the capitol, a guard
of honor, probably to be made up of
Colorado national guardsmen will be
on duty.
Federal troops will escort the re
mains from the capitol to the Elks
Home, for the service, according to
plans they are to inarch in funeral
cortege.
Less than a fortnight ago a fort of
the Old Timer Scouts, of which order
there are but four scouts in thr.
country, organized in Denver, was
named for Colonel Cody and it is
possible that this order also will par
ticipate in the funeral Sunday. After
these services, and nntil placed In
the tomb on lookout Mountain, the
body will be in custodv of the Knights
Templar here.
Telegrams ' of symnathv in large

VILLA IS EXPECTED
TO OPEN CAMPAIGN
IN NORTH CHIHUAHUA
Reports Received by Govern
ment Agents Seem to Con
firm Rumor that Rebel Will
Be Soon in the North.
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Jan. 10. Francisco Villa,
defeated by Carranza troops in the
vicinity of Jimenez and Parral, is ex
t
pected to begin a campaign against
the de facto government in northern
Chihuahua with military operations
between Chihuahua City and Juarez.
Reports received here by govern
ment, agents aim jiuiu reiUKees ar-
riving at the border from the interior j
say a column of Villa troops estimated i
at 3,000 mounted men had "ossed
1 1 1 .iit All u .,wi iiivoiT in laiuuBu
west of Chihuahua City and was mov
ing north toward Santa Clara Canyon.
This new move is believed here to
be the result of Villa's defeat by
General Francisco Murguia and of the
ldvance by General Manuel Dieguez
with a large force of de facto troops
o Torreon. General Diegnez is con
sidered one of Carranza's ablest of
ficers and has a column of 10,000
men. it was said here today. Of this
number. 3,000 are Yaqui Indians and
'2,000 Sonora Mexicans, who are
known.to be -brave fighters. His ad- i
vance northward has forced Villa to
confine bis operations to the northern '
zone and has caused the rebel leader
to decide on a campaign against Chi- j
huahua City, Juarez and the garri-1
sons between these two towns. The
''ndirg of letters on a Villa ?ty re-!
cently. offering annesty to all Car-1
rxnza soldiers and guarantees to all 1
residents of these towns, strengthened 1
the belief that Villa was planning to
advance on the state capital and bor
der port. The spy was captured on
train coming to Juarez after he had
delivered one of these letters at Chi
huahua City and said he was reroute
to Juarez to deliver the others.
General Murguia was reported late
today to have entrained and started
in pursuit of Villa on four troop
trains.

bail the same as his alleged partner
Davis and the latter under $10,OOi.
They were arrested In Oklahoma and
were brought to Arizona by Deputy
United States Marshal J. F. Dillon
or Chichasa, W. R. Highnight or Ard

This makes four of the alleged gang
of Oklahoma robbers in custody now
and two others still at large. Lulu
Cobb, the woman in the case Is said
to be a sweetheart of Davis, who was
arrested some time since and who is
now in the Yavapai county jail. All
four of those under arrest were in

in November and some of them, if
not all. have charges of train robbery
pending against them in Oklahoma,

was pulled off.
The woman. Lulu Cobb, was alleged
to have been on the train which was
robbed in Oklahoma. All the men

WIRELESS MONOPOLY.
The recommendation that the United States government
assume control of all wireless operations deserves serious
consideration. It seems inevitable that such action must
be taken sooner or later.
Events of the last two or three years haye shown the
evils of the present chaotic system. As a neutral power.
It is necessary for the United States to prevent the un
neutral use of American soil for the advantage or dis
advantage of any belligerent It has been found over and
over again that wireless plants on or near the Atlantic
coast were acting as intelligence centers and providing
one group of belligerents with valuable information to
use against Vie other. The government set up a cen
sorship in the chief wireless plants, but still there have
apparently been leaks from those plants at times, and
there have certainly been unneutral messages sent forth
from amateur plants.
This condition is a mere hint of the difficulties we
ehould face if we ourselves were Engaged in war. With
out public regulation, anybody with a wireless outfit
and there are thousands of men and boys possessing the
necessary equipment could send out messages that
would reveal the movements of our land and sea forces
and the position of merchant ships, and betray to the
enemy all sorts of military secrets.
Even if we ignore this danger, the disadvantages of un
regulated wireless operations in normal times are evident
Amateurs are always butting in where they don't belong.
giving false or mischievious information or obtaining and
using information not intended for tbem, and making all
sorts of trouble in business and personal affairs. Th.j
wireless seems almost as clearly destined for a public
monopoly as the postal business. ,
BANKERS' SALARIES.
Perhaps the banker isn't such an enviable person after
all. At least the bank director isn't. The common notion
of that functionary as an individual whose pockets fenlj
with $10 gold pieces, the same being his emolument for
the pleasant privilege of attending directors' meetings, is
rudely dissipated by a national bank report. It appears
that of 7,500 national banks, 3,708 confess that they pay
no fees at all to their directors. Of the rest, 1,800 !ay
from $1 fo Less than one bank out of seven pays $.",
and only about one out of :J0 pays $10.
It's plain that the New York financier who boasts of hav
ing given his son $800,000 collected as director's fees in
the course of a long and active life isn't typical. The
typical bank director appears in the guise of an unappre
ciated servant, who really ought to be better paid for
acting as watch-dog of the money and credit intrusted
to him.
Neither are bank employees so enviable as popular
imagination pictures them. Bankers that is to say, mea
who own and control banks have made a lot of money
in the last year or two. Hut the men who work for them
as a rule are not getting rich, even with .Christmas
bonuses. It isn't generally realized that most bank em
ployees, even those in responsible positions, are no bet
ter paid than .carpenters or masons or bricklayers. And
they're really not so well off, because they have to Iivo
more expensively. They look rich because they work up
to their ears in money,, but they get little or the money.
It's mostly fie prestige of the profession that holds them
to their jobs. Many of them pay dearly for the honor of
being called bankers.
HOTELS FOR WORKINCMEN.
Plans are being completed ia Philadelphia for the erec
tion in that city of a hotel for workinguien. The rooms
will rent for 25 cents a niglit. The men backing the pro
ject believe sucJi a hotel can lc good and at the same
time pay dividends even with such small charges.
The hotel is planned for the laboring men of that city
who arc receiving only nominal wages and who are forced
by conditions to live in cheap hoarding houses and poorly
equipped rooms. It is not in any sense a charitable
,scheuie. The "down-and-outers" are locked out for in
ofher ways. It's simply w sane plan for giving the re
spectable workingman clean and comfortable rooms with
out the marble, gill and brocade lial make living in most
!otcrs so expensive. It's a business proposition that de
serves and v ill probably revolve cutiera! -.ui'port.
THE CHILD WITH POOR EYES.
There are 20,000,000 children attending school in- the
United States. According to an article in the Medical
neviex of Reviews, written by Gordon L. Berry of the
National Committee for the Prevention of Blindness, one
fourth of these children, 5,000,000 in all, suffer from de
fects of vision. And for most of them nothing is being
done by parents,. teachers or the community.
Many of these children will become blind if their eyes
are not attended to. All will suffer physical pain and
economic loss if the defect is not remedied. Great num
bers of them will leave school, unable to stand the strain,
and often not knowing what is the matter. Great num
bers will miss success in trades or professions for which
they are fitted. Great numbers will have to endure an
old-'age uncomforted by the intellectual wealth they might
have gained. And why?
"Because some school superintendent lias thought that
a vision test required by the teachers required more of
their time than could be spared from the arithmetic hour
or the language class, or because some city council could
not, in its own blindness, see the economic significance
to the individual and the community in the expenditure
of funds to provide adequate medical ipspection, clinics,
ec., or perhaps because the parents themselves, in spite
of the warnings received where medical school inspection
is in force, are callous to tie need."
He emphasizes the value of inspection and Instruction.
Teachers should be always on the lookout for "symp
toms of defects of vision" such as spowling, squinting,
headaches, holding books at improper distance from the
eyes, sore eyes, inability to see the blackboard distinctly,
etc. And they should be careful that the seating and
lighting are such as not to aggravate eye troubles.
Much can be done, then, wiLi the children themselves,
through teaching. Even the youngest pupils can be made
to understand the fundamental facts about their eyes and
their use. And as they advance from grade to grade, they
should be instructed regarding eye-cleanliness, proper
lighting, proper reading position, ordinary eye diseases,
the use of glasses, etc. Above all, they should be im
pressed with the immense importance to their lifelong
.health, happiness and prosperity of seeing clearly and
being free from eyestrain.

U-BOAT MAIL.
Word conies from Berlin that the merchant submarine
Deutchland and several sister ships are going to be
utilized as' trans-Atlantic mail packets, carrying '"suj
marine mail" between Germany and the western hemis
phere. There would be a special charge of 50 cents per
letter.
It's a pretty high rate. Hut it w.ould doubtless be worth
it in thousands of cases to get letters safely through the
British blockade. At present, there is never any assur
a nee that even the most innocent and legitimate missive
from Germanv to America or America to Germany will
be delivered intact or delivered at all. Moreover, plenty
of people, on this side of the water at least, would will
ingly pay half a dollar for the privilege of sending or
receiving a letter by so unique a route.
It's a good use to put U-boats to. In fact, it's hard to
imagine any better use. And not only German-America'i
friendship but the material and spiritual interests of Ger
many and Austria in general would be furthered by trans
ferring their entice U-boat fleets to the ocean mail service.
All their naval operations have done the Central Empires

MAKING BOYS SOLDIERS.
Any sort' of universal military training is looked on in
this country as an evil by many. It is coming to be gen
erally accepted, however, that it is necessary, and our
only choice is to make it as mild as possible. T.'ie system
of training proposed by Col. S. M. Focte to the senate
committee on military affairs seems easier of application
than most of the proposals. .
Colonel Foote would create a reserve army entirely
through the medium of summer camps! lie would take
all our boys at the age of seventeen and have them spend
the three summer months at training camps for a period
of four years. Thus every young man would be given an
aggregate of twelve months' training, emerging at tin
age of 21 a civilian-soldier, ready for immediate service
in case of need. He would attend a training camp near
his home. The time devoted to his military education
would be merely a sort of strenuous summer vacation.
In the case of boys attending school, the time would
not be missed. It would not seriously burden boys earning
their own living, because all their living expenses Vouhl
be paid by the government. There would oven be a par
tial compensation for the earnings of those' helping ti
support their families. They would receive one-third of
the regular army pay. Lilieral exemptions would be made
in cases of physical disability, and presumably in cases
where boys were the. sole dependence of their families.
With this system once in full operation, we should liavi
about 2,000,000 young men in training every summer, and
an annual addition of half a million or so to our .army re
serve. The cost is estimated at $60,000,000 the first year,
increasing to $240,000,000 the fourth year and thereafter.
It would cost a heap of money, but we can't expect to
get military preparedness without paying for it. It's hard
to imagine a plan that would provide the desired army
reserve with less unsettling of our civil life. And if tV'
training camps were properly conducted, they would hao
a line physical and moral effect on the nation's youth,
gjiiug our boys pood physique and soldierly bearing, and
a discipline the lack of which is now one of our national
defects.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. After a
two hours' executive session late to
day the House rules committee ad
journed until tomorrow without taking
final actiVm on Representative Woods'
resolution for an investigation into
the alleged "leak" in advance of Presi
dent Wilson's peace note.
Although most of the Democratic
members favor abandoning the whole
proceeding with an adverse report on
the resolution, a sub-committee was
appointed to draft contempt charges
against Thomas W. Lawson for use in
case the committee decides to repon.
the Boston financier to the House for
contempt proceedings.
When the committee adjourned there
was pending a resolution offered by
Representative Campbell of Kansas,
Republican, designed to broaden the
scope of the Inquiry so as to meet Mr.
Lawson's objections that because the
present Investigation was preliminary
and limited to a specific "leak" he
could not give the names of men high

wanted to "call Mr. Lawson's hand."
In spite of the general belief in the
committee that nothing had happened
in all of the testimony to substantiate
any of the rumors which causpd the
inquiry, there were indications tonight
that Representative Campbell's resolu
tion or one similar might be adopted.
This would result in recalling to the
stand Mr. Lawson. who still is in
Washington subject to the committee's
orders.
Hearings were temporarily suspend
ed today after several witnesses had
been heard. The' present intention of
the committeemen is to hear nj fur

is disposed of and a decision has been

WASHINGTON. Jan. 10. A new
issue of the one and two dollar green
backs of Civil War days, discontin
ued more, than 30 years ago will be
put into circulation probably about
February 1, displacing similar United
States notes of larger denomination
to provide relief from the unprece
dented demand for small paper cur
rency. The treasury department an
nounced tonight that the issue had
been decided on because silver certifi
cates, the ordinary bills of one and
two dollar denominations, could not
be issued under th law in sufficient
quantities to meet the demand.
A limit or $:M6.6S1.016 to'the amount
of outstanding federal notes was fixed

had resulted in the birth of a new
national party, backed largely by the
farmers of the West and South. No
g-een backs have been issued since
1SS3 and the amount of, outstanding
one and two dollar notes of that vari
ety now is slightly over $3,1)00,000.
There is however. Slii2,445.2f)Q out

the departments announcement, "al
ways has been regarded by the treas

it is impossible to meet the country's

Simpson Fears Being Killed.
J. Shearer of Laundry Hill was
taken to Tombstone this morning by
Deputy Sheriff Howe where lie will
be examined as to his insanity. He
has hallucinations that several men
are stealing his clothes and that oth
ers are bothering his wife and other
members of his family. His wife and
son went over to be prssent at the
examination.
Ed Simpson was picked up by Con
stable Bert Polley last night and was
also taken over by the deputy. Simp
son is laboring under the Impression
that he is being followed by some six
teen men that want to kill him. He
stated tha( they took him' from his
house at Don Luis yesterday and took
him to Osfcorne where they were to
kill him ia a house there and then
to throw liis body on the railroad
track, but that after he- reached Os
borne he managed to escape them and
went to Naco. He gives the names of
several of the alleged men. Simp
son was in the asylum once before i ipni " wnrt work, could only
having been sent up from here about ! devote a limited time to this matter.
Sheriff Harry C. Wheeler who was
in Uisbee Tuesday, brought with him
the news that following a consulta
tion with John F. Ross, county attor
ney, his deputies would be instract
ed to destroy aH liquor found in tran
sit in Cochise county, reserving only
a small amount to be' used as evi
dence at the trial.
This course, the sheriff said, would
obiviate the difficulty of storing large
quantities of liquor with which his de
partment has had to deal in the
past.
Mr. Wheeler said that Mr. Ross is
now working on a detailed opinion in
which he will cover the handling of
cases where liquor is stored in safes
and sold from such receptacles, the
course to . be followed when large
stores of liquor were found in houses,
etc.
, He explained that the county at
torney is going into the questions in
considerable detail and as he was
two years ago.
With the committment of these by
the insanity board at Tombstone the
sheriff's office will have four patients
for the asylum. Charles Grant, a col
ored ex-soldier was examined a few
days ago arid committed and yester
day Thomas Gibbons of Douglas was
committed. The quartet will prob
ably be taken up tomorrow.
However, the opinion is advancing
and should be ready in a few days.
The county has been very quiet
from the peace officer's point of view,
the sheriff said, since the first of the
year.

(By Review Leased Wire)
PADICAH, K'.. Jan. 10. To es
cape lynching at the hands of a mob.
Circuit judge Charles Bush and Com
monwealth's Attorney Denny Smith
at Murray, Kentucky, agreed to try '
Lube Martin, a negro charged with
murder, tomorrow instead of at the
next term of court, according to re-
ports reaching here tonight. i
Martin had been held at Hopkins
viile, Kentucky, for safekeeping, and
was taken to Murray last night. Be
cause of a fear of mob violence he
was held in the court house all night
guarded by a large force of deputy
sheriffs.
This morning when his case was
called for trial counsel who had been
I appointed to defend him asked for a
continuance because of the discovery
of evidence which there had not been
an opportunity to develop. This was
granted and the negro was started
back to Hopkinsville, his departure,
being kept secret for a time.
When persons in the court room
learned of the continuance granted
Martin, and of his removal, accord-,
ing to the reports reaching here, a
large crowd immediately surrounded
the judge and commonwealth's attor
ney demanding that the nesro be
brought back for trial immediately,
threatening if this was not done to ;

CHIHUAHUA MILK FAMINE
EL PASO. Jan. 10. Because babies
were suffering for want of milk, two
hundred women made a demonstration
it the state palace in Ciiliuahua City
Saturday and demanded that the milk
venders be permitted to enter from
the surrounding country, according to
passengers arriving here.
The trouble is said to have arisen
from an order issued by the nrilitary
authorities, prohibiting the milk men
Crctn driving their burros into town
with the milk supply of the city on
their backs in bags made of skins. It
was feared that rebel spies might in
this way smuggle information from
the capital to Villa in the mountains.
After the demonstration, Governor
Arnulto Gonzales ordered the military

J Ask any of the great army of Postum users what influenced them to try this
beverage, and the reply nine times out of ten will be that they were convinced
the caffeine and tannin in tea and coffee were harmful to health.
Some imagine it is hard to give up coffee and tea. But it isn't with the de
lightful aroma and flavor of Postum at hand. This flavor somewhat resembles
that of a high-grade Java coffee, but there is no coffee in Postum only the nour
ishing goodness of wheat, skilfully processed with a small per cent of wholesome
molasses. .
J Postum comes in two forms: Postum Cereal, which has to be boiled; Instant
Postum soluble made in the cup, instantly. Some prefer one, some the .other.
Made right, they are alike delicious, and the cost per cup is about the same.

"There's a Reason'
v
the artist has painted into this pic
ture. Whereas, most paintings show
plainly that they are fashioned on a
flat surface, the Jewel Dance seems
to have real depth as well as breadth
and height. One senses strongly it's
spaces; he is convinced that there is
Jeal air and light between its fore
ground figures and those farther
back. I confess that I have searched
and Bob; many paintings vainly for the "at
mosphere" which artists talk about,
but it was not until I saw this mar
velous color composition of Mr.
Cooper's that I found it.
"I am not one of those who believes
! that Vulgarity or obscenity should be
j excused simply because it is com
I mitted in the name of art. I strongly
' maintain, however, along with all sin
i cere artists of every age, that the
nude of itself is not vulgar, and that
1 it s'lould not give reason for shame
' "Kvery clean-minded person can
judge for himself whether a nude
painting is objectionable or not sim
l ply b" trusting his instinctive re
sponse to the appeal of the painting
I If the artist is genuine, sincere and
lofty-minded the nude forms he paints
will charm but not offend; they will
' appeal to the spectator's artistic
, sense alone.
i "If, however, the artist is himself
j i vil-iiiiuded or hypocritical, he can
j not disguise his unclean soul, try as
' he may: the spectator will turn away
! ii. disgust.
"This is the (est of whether a palnt

lost. But there are hundreds of An
zonans and not a few in Bisbee who
posted money on- the result of the
gubernatorial race and who will not
be paid, in all probability, until the
courts decide.
A few bets have been paid locally,
it was understood yesterday from a
well informed source, because of the
belief on the part of the men who
had niad it that the man receiving
the certificate of election was the
one who had been elected, officially.
Many people who bet on Hunt's
chances, refuse to allow stakeholders
to surrender their money to Camp
bell's backers, holding that the cer
tificate of election had nothing to do
with the C4se and that they would
not be satisfied to lose their money
until the courts had affirmed Camp
bell's election or decided in. favor of
Hunt.
. In Bisbee alone it is estimated that
several thousand dollars is tied up
in this' sort of bets.

"Hulda from Holland" as a picture !
will delight the friends of Miss Tick- :
ford. Huida as a characterization is i
filled with charm, with the distinctive i
bits that seem to be Miss rickioru's
sole property ill spite of manifold ef- j
forts by numerous others to apptopri- j
ate them. She is always at her best
with children and w ith old :ie:i, not j
to mention young ones and in this j
picture she has as side partners three j
clever youngsters, one of them e-e i
nially so. Horal li'jllacher is Little
Yacob, and Horal makes a fine little
Dutchman.
Frank Losee is John Walton, the
"big business" man. who loses his
temper over his son's fondness for
sketching to the detriment of his law
studies. John Bowers is Allan, the
son. who berimes an artist with ill
success until he sketches Hulda and
lands a magazine cover which inci
dent figures much in the story. Russel
Bassett is the Pennsylvania Dutch
uncle of Hiilda. who refines to sell his
property just to please Walton. And
there is Antonioti the organ (.riuder.
These all give excellent support.
"Hulda from Holland" contains a
few serious moments, eu'nigh to leaven
the lighter vein that marks the story
as a whole. There is an abundance
of human interest, increased perhaps
in its scope by reason of the v ide
range in the ages of its principals, the
children, the. two lovers, the middle
aged father and the old uncle.
The story opens in Holland w ith its
little village and windmill, and shifts
to New York and the farm in Pennsyl

Principles of Progress
That the present state of
civilization of all races is the
result of an evolutionary pro
cess is today beyond question
of doubt. One of the princi
ples of this slow form of pro
gress is the inventions which
have broken the barriers of
isolation and made as ons all
the nations of earth. The rail
roads, steamships, telegraph,
etc., are prime factors, but
the public press is univer
sally recognized as one of the
greatest agents of public up
lift. It spreads the desire for
knowledge; it furnishes sub
jects for comment; it creates
an air of Independence, and it
keeps the great family of hu
manity ''in touch." No fam
ily circle is quite complete
without a daily visitation of
one or more of the leading
papers. To supply this need
for Bisbee and the Warren
District, the Review has en
stalled the latest telegrapn
system, giving you today's
news today, and keeping you
in touch with the whole world
and in "tune" with your fel
low man. Does the Daily Re
view visit your home regularly?

How much money ought a man
to pay for a suit
There are a lot of ways to answer that question ; but one
of the best answers is this: "Just enough to get good
quality;" and further, he ought to get as good quality
as he can afford. Good quality in clothes means a cer
tain standard in fabrics, in tailoring, in trimmings; and
when clothes are up to that standard, they cost a certain
amount, and they're worth it. If you pay less, you get
less; there's no other way to figure it.
Hart Schaffner & fflarx
are the largest producers of fine clothing in the world. Their clothe
are up to a certain staridaid of quality -all-wool fabrics, high grade
tailoring, correct tit. designing and the latest and mcst correct style
They're kept to that standard not to make them cost more, but to
make them worth more to the wearer. When you go below that price
which is $20 you go below that quality standard.
You don't want cheap stuff; because, usually, low priced as it is, it
isn't worth it.
ADJUDGED INSANE, y
Thomas H. Gibbons arrested in
Douglas as a lunacy suspect as a re
sult of writing a voluminous series
of "cmnk" letters to the treasury de
partment in Washington, was ad
judged insane and ordered commit
ted to the state asylum in Phoenix,
when brought before a commission in
Tombstone.- Letters written by Gib
bons in which he reiterated the state
ment that he was being pursued by
a murderous gang and demanded that
the treasury department send detec
tives to guard his life, were intro
duced. More than one of the letters
made the covert threat that he would
come to Washington and take mat
ters n his own hands unless his re
euest - was comolied with. Gibbons
will be taken to Phoenix and placed I
in the asylum this week. He is said
to maintain violently that he Is sane
but the victim of a huge conspiracy.
