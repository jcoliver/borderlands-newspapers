in the bituminous field would walk
out, to a man, unless the operators
made concessions.
"The statement of President Wil

E GOAL STRIKE
60 per cent increase in wages, time
and a half for overtime, and elimina
tion of the strike penalty clause.
In a statement issued tonight, he
said, to clear up popular misappre
hensions about exactly whatx took
place in the joint conference, Mr.
Lewis again placed responsibility for
the strike on the operators. The
statement follows:
"At the biennial convention of the
United Mine Workers of America at
Cleveland, September 9 to 23, at
tended by 2046 delegates, a wage
program and policy was outlined and
scale committees were selected which
were instructed to present demands
to the operators.
"On September 25, at Buffalo, the
miners and operators met In joint
committee: The minerB presented
their demands, and were met by a
statement that, the Washington
ffeement had not expired because
the war was not ended and peace
- t promulgated by the
president.
"No counter proposals were sub-
mitted by the operators, who seem-
tee adjourned ior a week and recon-
med in Philadelphia on October 9
where the Bame circumstances ob-
th. they wer ready ; to consider de-

alone. But consideration on this
basis was denied by the operators.
"The government in conferences
with operators and miners last week
in Washington endeavored, to secure
a reopening of negotiations. The
mtnprn fnnanntAil without reserva-
"- - - : t
"on. The operators declined except
under conditions which rendered ne-
gotiatlons impossible."
The government stood pat today on
President Wilson's ultimatum to the
Boft coal miners of the country that
the strike ordered for November 1
must not take place.
The whole federal machinery, al
ready set up for the emergency, was
ready to deal with conditions in the
mining districts unless the executive
board of the United Mine Workers
of America, meeting at Indianapolis
Wednesday, votes to rescind the
strike order.
In the face of statements by John
L. Lewis, president . of the miners'
organization, that it was too late
now to stop the walkout, there was
strong beliefe in official quarters to
night that the strike would at least
be postponed. Tlis hope of averting
industrial disaster was based largely
on the feeling that sentiment
throughout the country was over
whelmingly for peace, regardless of
how the people might view the re
ported grievances of the miners.
The fact that the miners them
selves had taken no strike vote added
to the hope i nthe minds f officials
that the workers would be duly lm-
pressed by the presidents strong
warning, and, looking at It In a new
light, willing to negotiate a new wage
agreement without reservation

Another Case of

This was told to the Review

be it was the telegraph editor.
But, in any event, it was related
by some equally truthful member
of the Review family, and is pub

It appears that a highly repu
table and well-known citizen of
Bisbee went home Saturday
night, filled - the teakettle, put
out the cat, and then turned to
the clock, as any well-trained
husband will do. He remembered
that it must be set back an hour
to catch up. with what he had
lost last summer, so dutifully he
turned it back an hour, and went
to bed. Soon his eldest son came
in, remembered that it was the
day when the clocks go back, and
he turned it another hour. Then
his wife, thinking that- her hus
band,, like all others, had for
gotten the timepiece, stepped
from her bed and turned it back
again.
And Friend Husband is angry
yet because he got the laugh
from the Bexton when he tried

SEN. JOUNSON
ABUT
IS DEFEATED
Unexpected Vote Is Taken on
Equalizing American, Brit
Reservation Advocating
ish League Voting Strength
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27. The
Johnson amendment to the peace
treaty, designed to equalize Ameri
can and British voting strength in
the league of nations, was' rejected
in the senate today by a vote of 3S
to 40.
On the roll call, which came unex
pectedly during a lull in the debate,
two Democrats Joined the Republi
cans supporting the amendment and
iiine Republicans voted with the
Democrats against it. Of 18 sena
tors absent or paired, four Republi
cans and two Democrats were record
ed as favoring it and 12 Democrats
as opposing it.
The senate then took up the Moses
amendment on the same subject, the
last surviving amendment of 47 rec
ommended by the foreign relations
committee. Over the opposition of
the administration leaders, action on
this measure was postponed, the sen
ate adopting, 43 to 36, Republican
Leader Lodge's motion for a recess
until tomorrow.
When the senate met the leaders
had not hoped for a .vote before to
morrow, but after a rambling debate
of an hour and a half, during which
nearly every current subject except
the league had been discussed, it was
decided not to wait on the senators
who had announced they would speak
on the amendment this week. When
Democratic Leader Hitchcock asked
that a time be set for a roll call dur
ing the afternoon, Mr. Lodge replied
he saw no reason why the vote
should not be taken at once.
The suddenness with which the
roll call began apparently took the
administration forces by surprise.
and although they had counted on a
majority of six or eight, so many
senators were absent that a sigh ot
relief went up from the Democratic
side when the result was announced.
It was by far the narrowest margin
by which any of the committee
amendments had been defeated.

U. S. To Demand
Return of Money
State Departments Co-operating
With Mexican Auth
orities in Investigating the
Death of Tvo Aviators
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 Official
information received from Mexico
City indicated that Carranza soldiers
unquestionably were implicated in
the kidnapping of William O. Jen
kins, the American agent at Puebla,
.who was abducted October 19 and re-
! leased only after his friends in Pueb
la had paid to the kidnappers $150,
000 in American gold.
State department officials have not
been officially notified of the implica
tion of Carranza military in the bold
est kidnapping of an American in the
history of recent years in Mexico,
but it is known that they look to the
Mexican government to reimburse
promptly the friends of Jenkins.
The American government, it was
said today at the department, does
not intend to pay any of the ransom
money either directly or indirectly.
Officials expressed their belief that
President Carranza would be- glad to
repay the friends of the consular
agent. .
The department had no news re
garding the release of -Jenkins dur
ing the day exceut a message from
the American embassy in Mexico
City saying that Third Secretary of
Embassy Hanna reported from Pueb
la that Jenkins had sent word from
within the federal lines that he was
free and was returning to Puebla.
Reports regarding Jenkins' physi
cal condition and details of his kid
napping have been asked by the de
partment and it was announced that
information regarding the case would
be made public as soo as received.
It is feared that he was mistreated
by his captors since it was reported
unoffcially that he was going to the
American hospital for treatment. The
department, however, had no infor
mation confirming the reports.
Both the state department and the
war department are co-ouerating with
Mexican authorities - in an investiga
tion of the deaths of Lieuts. C. JI.
Connolly and Fredericwk B. Water
house, army aviators, whose bodies
were found in Lower California. The
information at the disposition of the
state department, It was said today,
is not sufficient to warrant the offi
cial charge that the men were mur
dered, although that has been re
ported to the department.

The other patrons of the restau

more for dinner than the ordinary

Bill Over Veto
(Continued From Page One) '
Representative Walsh, Republican .of
Massachusetts, moved . to , table the
Volstead motion. Most of the mem
bers did not seem to know wha this
meant,- but It was evident that Mr.
Walsh was. trying to force an immed
iate vote. " ' r "
The hubbub and the wrangle kept
going while Republican Leader Mon

ahead of 60 others, who were" frying
to catch . the speaker s . finaliygot
the floor, toid. how. the prohibition
bill affected . the -welfare of all tne
people, which made it necessary that
the house have everybody present
when voting time, came. This plea
was made ' after Chairman Volstead
had asked unanimous consent to
withdraw his motion. ,
There were many motions after
that and a number of roll calls, until
the final vote was taken at 7 o'clock.
The galleries were deserted. The
crowds that used to sit through weary
hours of prohibition debate had not
heard, of course, that the final fight
was at hand and John' Barleycorn's
wake, if it was that, was unattended.
On the floor a handful of members
who had. stood up against me ory
phalanx,-hedged in a word now and
then and tried to appeal far upholding
the veto,' .but they were unable to
make themselves heard above the din.
At the end not more than a score
of hands clapped. The house: went
;bout its work with considerable
fclee, but there was no heart in the
feeble cheer thai, .followed aanounce
ment of the final vote.
If the senate also overrides the
veto, the country owill go on a one-half
of one per cent alcoholic content
beverage basis. In the only test vote
on the bill the senate gave it a five
to -ono majority and dry leaders pre
dict the next' test, would reveal a

TALKS BEFORE
HI-Y CLUB
The Hi-Y club held its regular
weekly meeting last night in the Y
M. C. A. banquet room at 7 o'clock.
After the banquet, Barrett Jeffrey,
vice president of the club, introduced
II. A. McLoughlin, former physical
director of the Y. M. C. A., who has
lately been in the aviation service
overseas. McLoughlin was a firt
lieutenant when discharged.
McLoughlin told of his experiences
since he left ELsbee about two years
ago. Soon after he left here he
joined the field artillery and was
later transferred to the aviation
corps. lie said that he was three
times reduced in rank before he
finally received his commission. The
first time he was "busted ' for run
ning into another plane in mid-air.
He managed to get in the air service
again and was sent to Mineola field,
Long Island. Here he fell from a
height of over 2000 feet and received
severe injuries
- In a short time McLoughlin was
sent overseas and here he wa3 "bust
ed" again, this time for doing a
handstand in the cockpit of his ma
chine while in mid-air, when the men
had orders not to do any "stunt"
flyir.g. , Somehow he managed to
get back into the service again and
resolved to do the handstand again,
this time having it recorded by a
camera. A friend took his picture
while he was doing this stunt in mid
air. Some time later the commander
got hold of one of these pictures and
he wa3 "busted" again, this time, to
a machine gunner on a bombing
planr He had four months' experi
ence on a bombing plane and latef
went back as a "chaser." Lieut. Mc
Laughlin has four enemy machines
to his credit.
After he received his discharge
Lieut. McLoughlin and five other
fliers went on the Pantage's vaude
ville circuit in California.
HcLoughlin will leave for El Paso
this evening. He was on his way
overland from California to his home
In San Antonio when the axle of his
machine broke. He is stopping in
Bisbee while it is being repaired.
Mr. McLoughlin will be remem
bered as the man who did a hand
stand on several tables and chairs on
top of the Orpheum theater building
about two jears ago and who has
been doing kthe same stunt on ;.'14-J
story buildings in California for the
benefit of the Red Cross.
When he reaches home, McLough
lin said, he contemplated taking up
stunt flying of the same type as that
which Lieut. Locklear is engaged in.

Exceeding its quota by $655, the
Warren district has subscribed $2,155
to the Roosevelt Memorial fund.
This amount, of which Hie greater
part Is in cash and the remainder in
pledges which will be realized upon
within the next few days, was con
sidered yesterday by the committee
in iarge, headed by Ira B. Jorale-
mon, as the greatest testimonial that
Bisbee and its suburbs could offer to
the memory of that president who
was known to millions of people as
the Great Friend, and whose t!rtii
day was yesterday.
Bisbee's quota, $1,500, ,. was sub
scribed practically on Saturday, when
all but a few dollars had been col
lected. The over-subscription was
made yesterday, when the donations
of those business firms and fraternal
organizations which had not sub
scribed before, were added to the
total. A feature of the campaign has
been the subscription of the school
children, who gave more than $200
to the fund.
The actual returns, as announced
by Chairman Jdralemon last evening,
were $1,725 In cash; $230 in pledges,
end $200 from various sources which
is yet to be collected. The import
ance of the Bisbee subscription, how
ever, does not lie in the rapidity and
generosity with which the appeal for
tJie memorial was met, but in the
fact that many towns in the county
ore reported to be behind In their
totals, which is apt to make it diffi
cult to reach the amount assessed
against the county, which is $4,000.
Bisbee, therefore, may be again the
Eavior of Cochise county.

THE MERCHANT MARINE QUESTION
VESSELS engaged in foreign trade which entered and cleared
American porta during fiscal year ended June 30, 1919. aggre
gated nearly 93,000,000 net tons, according to official figures.
Of this tonnage nearly 52,000,000 was foreign and 41,000.000
was 'American, either new or temporarily operating under our flag.
Of the American tonnage over 33,500,000 plied between the Unite;!
States and North American ports.
Total trade for fiscal year 1919 was $10,179,000,000, imports
096,000,000 and exports $7,074,000,000. Our total trade with North
America came to $2,344,000,000, of which $1,344,000,000 was hauled
by "cars and other land vehicles." leaving something like one billion
dollars' worth of our trade to be moved by 33,500,000 net tons of
American vessels.
While this was going on, the remainder of our trade with the
world, amounting to $7,835,000,000 in value, was being carried - by
something under 60.000,000 of net tonnage, of which nearly 90 per
cent was foreign, or, at a rough calculation, foreign vessels carried
gbout $7,000,000,000, or 70 per cent of our entire trade last year. Thus
while 33,500,000 net tons of American vessels were handling one
billion dollars' worth of our foreign trade within the confines of the
North American division, 52,00,000 net tons of foreign vessels were
getting paid for handling seven billion dollars' worth of our foreign
trade to and from the uttermost confines of the earth and in between.
Ton for ton, foreign tonnage showed an efficiency nearly four and
onehalf times greater than our own in getting cargoes.
For example; Japan, with an entrance and clearance in American
ports of .1,588,000 tons, handled nearly one billion dollars' worth cf
our foreign trade, or with less than one-twentieth of the tonnage we
devoted to North American trade, the Japs handled an equal TafueV
of our foreign trade. Our merchant marine' must have the fuJJ.-mip-j..
port and co operation of the government and the people ft it is fo '
succeed, and this will necessitate government aid and, ultimately,
private operation and ownership to Jnsure business efficiency and
fair returns. What we give in aid will return an hundredfold in
trade, for a ship is the best salesman in the world, and the people
must support the program for perpetuating the American flag on the
high seas.
WHEAT, HOGS AND LUMBER
A LARGE portion of the west is dependent on the lumber indus
try for its real prosperity. In the states of Oregon and Wash
ington alone this industry is responsible for the steady em-,
ployment o fsome 150,000 men at good wages, not to mention
the taxes it pays or the millions expended for equipment, etc.
Of all basic commodities, lumber in recent years has had a lower
buying power than any -of the others. Conditions which hurt the
lumber industry automatically hurt hundreds of thousands of persons
dependent on it for a living. It is therefore with a feeling of satis
faction that the public has noted improved market conditions during
recent months.
Lumber, however, is still one of the cheapest commodities.
Using the realizations of January, 1913, and July, 1919, Bradstreet's
Commodity Index shows that, as compared with 1913, lumber has a
purchasing power of 163 per cent; general commodities, 199 per cent.
In comparison to other basic commodities, , such as Bteel, cement,
brick, farm produce, leather, and clothing, lumber Is lower now than
it was in 1912.
The following table shows that in the period between 1913 and
1917, lumber actually decreased in value compared to other com
modities. The price of 1000 feet of lumber purchased in 1913 In 1917.
23.4 bushels of wheat , 12.4
35. bushels of corn . 16.3
290. pounds of hogs ISO.
201. pounds of bacon ... 109.
10. barrels of apples .-. : . 8.5
190. pounds of cotton .'. 133. ,
328. yards of cotton sheeting , 216.
1949 pounds of steel 1725.
The commodity prices continued to soar during 1918, while price
of lumber was not only held down but reduced by the government.
ADVERTISING AS ON ECONOMIC FACTOR
M
EUCHANTS know, as do a majority of readers of this news
paper, that advertising works for a lower gelling cost for
commodities just as improved manufacturing methods work
for a lower producing cost.
We could have no moderate prices for commodities unless we
had highly efficient manufacturing processes and expensive transpor
tation systems. Machinery which costs a good deal to install soon
pays for itself, and continues to yield dividends to all who use its
output. It costs money to build railroads, but it would cost im
mensely more not to build them. '
After manufacturing and transportation problems have been
solved, however, there remains the problem of distribution to the
ultimate consumer. There is a factor known as selling cost which
enters into the ultimate retail price of every article.
If the selling cost is unnecessarily high, he retail prices keeps
pace with it includes It. And thus it becomes just as vital a prob
lem to reduce selling cost as it has been to reduct manufacturing
and transportation costs.
A store, organized to carry on a large distribution of goods, may
keep the selling ccst at minimum only through doing the largest
possible volume of business. This maximum volume, Or capacity
turnover, is made possible only through adequate advertising. Ad
vertising thus becomes the final economic factor In determining
retail prices. If the advertising is not planned to match the selling
task in hand, then all else that has been to assure a minimum sell
ing price is more or less nullified. Slow and conjetsed final .distribu
tion would entail such a selling cost as would force high retail pries.
When you see a big and interesting store advertisement you may
know that the mercAhnt is safeguarding you in the price you will
pay for the thing you need-rthat he is matching economical nianufac
auring methods by economical selling methods, and that YOU will
profit by his progresslveness.
The radicals have a growing faith that they can get away with
anything. Germany had that conviction for a time. A great deal
is required to get Uncle Sam wide awake, but he is a mean customer
when he gets started.
We know that the Letts, Slavs, British, Bavarians and others
are .mixed in a seOeral scrap up about the. Baltic, but we don't know
. which sidc'is trying to make the world safe jor democracy.
. Palmer assures us that the cost or food has fallenalmost 25 per
cent. The cost to rainier may have fallen that much. The rest of
us can't see any difference. .

GOVERNMENT MAN KILLS
FIVE (MOUNTAIN LIONS
PRESCOTT, Oct 27. Killing five
mountain lions in one day is. the re
markable record made by Ramsey
Patterson, who is employed by the
government as a big game hunter.
As a one day's clean-up of these
lions, which is vouched for by cat

His tabulated account shows in the

The last bunch consisted of three

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
.. o
Oct. 27. Up early, as there was much work to be done, especially for
my wife, who much dislikes to see me idle, and who is the most handy
woman to find tasks for me that anyone could imagine. To town at the
first opportunity, and to the office, where I did find that the cashier is back
from a vacation, which has appeared to be all that, and then some. The
assistant worried me again about her ring, and what the cashier said about
it, so I cheered her eaough to make her smile a little, although it was hard
work, and I glad when it was all over. Much talk this day, as there has
teen lor several, concerning the last prize fights, and the hardiness and
courage of Mr. Loughery, who did not look this day so much a battle-scarred
victim of the Argonne Forest as he did last Friday night. Some talk also
of the road race next Sunday. I saw yesterday the Ford that is to pur
Lowell on the map, and while I think it will be a good car on the shor
turns, I do not think I will bet on It In the straight aways. To Miss Effl
Rainey, where I bought some candy, but who was too busy to talk to me,
which made me think again of my bald head and the wrinkles that are
marking my cheeks, but glad that I was shaved, which counts much with
a woman when she has to look at you much. This from my experience.
Flirted, after leaving her, with a pretty woman by the PhelpsDodge store,
and was surprised when I saw her children. But was pleased to see that
I have not lost all my tricks, which is consoling to a thin man. Think there
ere more attractive ladies in the city than before,, but this may be due to
a more appreciative eye in my own' head. To Tom Foster, who told me
some news, and who wrote with a pen which had a bad point, and he swore
he would write with chalk before he would buy one, so I counseled him
to tell the supervisors about it, and I hope he may get one. To the office,
where there was little news, but worked late. To bed at midnight, hoping
that I will not be as cold as I was Sunday evening, when I thought verily
that the wind was coming rightup through the mattress.

IN BISBEE TO
BEGIN DUTIES
J. V. McRae, new director of the
American Legicn band, arrived in
Bisbee from Marysville, Calif., on
Sunday. Mr. McRae expresses him
self as, agreeably surprised and very
favorably impressed with the Warren
district. It was found that many of
the band members had already made
the acquaintance of the new director
while at Camp Kearny, Calif., where
Mr. McRae directed a . regimental
band. These old acquaintances are
particularly glad to see him in charge
of the - local Legion band, as they
know him to be a capable director,
a musician of high "endowments and
a fine man.
The band committee is highly
gratified with the personality and
capacity of the new director. He
feels confident that, under dis direc
tion and leadership, the Legion band
of the L. A. Engel post will rapidly
be developed into one of the best
bands in the southwest; ' Mr. McRae
expressed the opinion that, with the
excellent material and skilled per
sonnc lof the band, the expectations
of the committee and the community
in this regard soon will be realized.
The first rehearsal of the band will
take place on Tuesday night at the
Y. M. C. A. band room at 7:30 o'clock.
All musicians of the district who
are Legion members and ex-service
men are urged to come and bring
their instruments. 1 The only stipula
tion to entrance to this band is that
the musicians be . willing to play
when called upon by the community
without quibbling over receipts. The
reason for this provision is that the
Legion band is organized primarily
for public services and public ser
vice is always to be placed above
private gain.
The initial appearance of the band
will be at the big Armistice day cele
bration on Nov. 11, when the boys
will appear in Vie uniforms laid
away upon their discharge.

SAVE MONEY AND MAKE FRIENDS IF YOU WOULD SUCCEED IN WORK,

i
By KITTY GORDON.
Dearest Vera:
Actors are said to be extremely
improvident. But I've found, in my
wide experience with stage and
screen folk, that exactly the opposite
is true. Actors are always thinking
about the future, laying" something
aside for old age, preparing them
selves ior advancement in their art,
and making friendships which wiH
prove profitable in business and so
'cial affairs.
Early in my career on the stage
I had a heart-to-heart talk with my
self. I said: 'Kitty, you've got to
make your own way in the world.
It's up to .you to make a living for
yourself and your daughter. Yo.u're
making quite a lot of money now and
i fyou'yield to your desires and spend
all you make on clothes and flowers
and a good time, you 11 have a great
time while it lasts, but what will
happen tomorrow if you lose out?"
So right then and there I began
the habit of saving. 1 am having a
good time every day, but I am not
living for the day alone. I am think
ing and preparing for the inevitable
future.
In the natural course of events,
Vera, you will live for a long time.
It's all right to say: "Eat, drink and
be merry for tomorrow we die," but
that's what seldom happens. Too
many of us eat and drink and are
merry with all that we have in the
world and tomorrow, instead of dy
ing, we live and are penniless and
unhappy. Too late we find out that
the wisest plan would have been to
give a thought to the morrow on
every day of our journey through
life. .
So I want to advise you, my dear,
to be provident. Save money. Don't
be penuriousu but save money -and
invest it wisely. And make friends.
Friends are the greatest asset in the
world, I believe. The humble person
who was your friend yesterday is
the: big person of tomorrow and is

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 27. Stocks today
recorded general, and in some in
stances, remarkable recoveries from
their severe reversal of last Saturday,
the big rebound being attributed to a
more hopeful view of industrial con
ditions. Unusual conditions prevailed in the
money market, call loans opening at
5 per cent, but mounting to 9 per
cent in the last hour, a 12 per cent
rate ruling at the close. Time ac
commodations eased, many sixty and
ninety-day loans being negotiated at
6'zi per cent. '
Motors and oils led today's rally,
equipments, steels and food shares
contributing in variable degrees. General-Motors
eclipsed the entire list,
rising exactly 35 points to the new
maximum of 361. j .

IF THIN AND
NERVOUS. TRY
PHOSPHATE
A French scientist has discovered
an organic phosphate which should
be a very, effective remedy for weak
nerves, sleeplessness, thinness and
lack of strength, energy and vigor.
Its substance is described by spe
cialists- as ' identical in composition
with certain vital elements naturally
found in brain and nerve, cells and
one which when taken into the hu
man system is quickly converted into
healthy living tissue.
This phosphate is already widely
known among druggists in this coun
try as Bitro-PhoBphate and some
physicians claim that through its use
strength, energy, vigor and nerve
force are frequently increased in two
weeks' time.
Dr. Frederick Kolle, editor of New
York Physicians' "Who's Who," says
it should be prescribed by every doc
tor and used in every hospital in the
United States. As there are a great
variety of sa-called phosphates, those
who wish to test this substance
should be sure to get the genuine
Bitro-Phosuhate. Adv.

READY ROOFINGS
Good ready roofings consist of felt, saturated and
coated with waterproof materials.
Sun and rain, however, are respecters of neither per
sons nor things, and the continued protection afforded by
any roofing its lasting ability depends absolutely on the
quality cf the materials that go to make it.
.That is why we maintain our own refineries for turn
ing out saturating and coating compounds of the quality
needed to make Malthoid and Ru-ber-oid Roofings Jong
lasting. '
Pictured above are some of the huge stills used for this
purpose. Crude oil is carefully distilled by a scecial
process which retains the natural life and vitality of the
asphaltic residues. These residues are then scientifically
combined into highly waterproof and sun-resisting com
pounds. Tough, long'-fibre, wool-and-cotton felt, made in our
own mill, is first saturated and then coated with these
special compounds, to make Malthoid and Ru-Dr-oid
Roofings all under the care of experts, and with the
most modern machinery.
We have been making ready roofings for
35 years. We are particular about quality
because experience shows that quality roof
ing is tne only kma that will not ret or dry
out, and that is fire resistant. Malthoid
and Ru-ber-oid are therefore economical to .
use on barns, homes, sheds, shops, garages
or factories. The price is higher but the
: cost is less. : -. v- - . -
