social ed Press I Another sector of the '
front was added to the north end of j
the new battle line today, when the
Germans attacked heavily on both :
sides of the Scarce towards Arras. I
Hitter fighting took place from Gav
lelle, on th north, to Uoyelles, belo'v j
the river, and in some sections, the
Gentians succeeded in pushing forward j
somewhat ia the face of desperate
resistance.
Whether the enemy was really niak- j

LONDON, March 2S.--The Daily
Mail's correspondent at the front
says the offensive is being direct
ed by the best of the German gen
erals, who won the successes in
the east.
"The commands are now
known." the correspondent says,
"to be held by General Von Kath
en in charge of the Peronne
group. General Otto Von Below,
in the sector east of Arras, and
by eGneral Von Hutier, south of
St. Quentin. The two first nam
ed generals are probably the
ablest commanders in the German
empire.
"General Von Kathen was at
Ypres and on the Somme and at
the battle of the Aisne in April
ltl7. Then he went to Galicia,
conducted the operations against
Tamopol and assisted in the cap
ture of Riga. General Ott Von
Below, who must not be mistaken
for General Fritz Von Below, was
in Russia during 1914-16 and did
very sound work. Then he went
to Macedonia where he is credited
with saving the situation after the
taking of Monastir. and thence
back to France. Last autumn he
went to Italy.
"General Von Hutier was the
captor of Riga and is known to
have laid bis plans very carefully
although in that event he had an
easy job. In some respects the
dispositions he made there were
adopted for the purpose of the
present offensive."

Representatives of the chambers of

El Paso, where they will seek the rout
ing of the Bankhead national military
highway throunh the southern part of
this state. In El Paso the delegates
from Arizona will center with repre

Commerce, Rotary club and Automo

will be included in the Arirnna delega

the aid of El Paso in securing the
route for this district. Later, El Paso
will be assisted by the Arizona deleg
ates in having the highway routed
from Texarkan... Texas, to El Paso
The meeting will be in the nature of
a gtt-together. and the best programs
of procedure and attack will be out

the El Paso meeting will send repre

Earlier in the n.onth it is probable that
the Arizona delegates will be called on
to attend a meeting at Texarkana.

the support of southern Arizona in
bringing the highway through E! Paso
without promising to assist in bring
ing it west by way of lKiuglas. Bishee
and Tucson. El Paso draws more
trade from this portion of Arizona than
from ail the rest of the state put to
gether, and this will be impressed
upon the Texans in a convincing war.
It is the general impression that El
Paso is lukewarun and considers that,
so long as she has a prospect of get
ting the road, she has no desire to
mix in a fight for the routing farther
west. This is a condition that th
delegation expects to change.
Kofttir.g of the highway through this
district means much to all cities in
the southern part of Arizona. While
the Horderland highway has in the
past been considered more or less a
transcontinental highway, it has not
received official recognition by high
way departments and automobile log
manufacturers of the east. Automo
bile logs issued by the organizations f
Chicago and Detroit, it is declared, do
not show the cities of El Paso. Dou
glas and Hisliee as on passable roads.
No routes are marked on these logs.
"With the building of logging of the
Hankhead highway a transcontinental
route with recognition over the entire
nation will have been assured, and
should representatives of this district
succeed in their work the largest ci
ties of Cochise county will have been
placed definitely on a transcontinental
route of highest recognition.

MUST BEJlSiiED
Must Beat Germany to Knees,
Declares Colonel in Talk to
Republicans on Peace ; Hits
at Bolsheviki.
Uv Review Leased Wire)
PORTLAND. Maine, March 2S.
There is but one way to get a right
eaus and lasting peace and that is to
beat Germany to her knees. Colonel
Roosevelt declared here today in a
"keystone address" which he deliver
ed before the Maine republican state
convention. Colonel Roosevelt laud
ed as "whole-hearted" support which
be declared the republican members
cf congress had given to the admin
istration iu Washington. He denied
"mismanagement at Washington" and
urged a policy of "permanent pre
paredness" after the war.
"War is won by brains and steel,
not by kid gloves and fine phrases,"
said toe former president in his ar
raignment of "some of the most im
portant divisions of the government
which lie said were "almost chemical
ly pure of efficient organization.
In discussing post bellum readjust
ments which he declared already have
been shown essential to the well being
of the nation, he said:
Neew New Weapons.
"We cannot afford to tolerate flint
lock methods of warfare in time of
war or flint-lock methods of govern
ment for meeting the problems of in
dustry in time of peace.' We need
new weapons, but we need the old
spirit back of the new weapons. The
simple governmental processes which
sufficed in the days of Washington
and. even in the days of Lincoln, are as
utterly inadequate today in peace as
the flint-lock of Bunker Hill and the
smooth bore muskets of Bull Run
would be in war."
Republicans iu congress since the
entry of the I'nited States into the
war "have sought to serve their party
only by making it serve America."
Colonel Roosevelt said in his intro
tuctory remarks.
"There have been very. grave fault
and shortconi'ngs and delays in gov
ernmental work. But they were not
due to the action of congress; aud
the action of the republicans In con
gress was consistently designed to
correct them.
"We are pledged to the hilt as a na
tion to put this war through without
flinching until we win the peace or
overwhelming victory. We are pledged
to secure for each well behaved na
tion the right to control its own des
tinies and to live undominated br
others so Ions.-, as it does net barn;
others.
"This Is the people's war. It is not
the president's war. It is not con
gress' war. It is the duty of the re
publican party to stand like a rock
against inefficiency, incompetence,
hesitation and delay no less than
against lukewarmness in serving 'he
I common cause of ourselves and our
'. allies. To support a public servant
! who does wrong is as profoundly un
i patriotic as to oppose a public serv
! ant who does right."
After enumerating German barbbar
ities in Belgium and the cruelties ol
Austria. Bulgaria and Turkey. Ger
many's "vassal states," Colonel Roose
velt said:
"Unless we war on Turkey, precise
ly as we war on Germany, we show
that we are insincere when we say
' that we wish to make the world safe
I for democracy."

Snw Will Help
Tonight's reports from the front
were of a checkered character. While
the British sustained a couple of set
backs ihe most encouraging new
eor.ies from sectors on the French
front, where the advance was most
threatening.
The French having brought up re
serves, hav been able on their hith
erto yielding line between Ilainevill
vers. south or Montdidier. by a fine
counter attack to drive the enem,
baric a distance of three kilometers
on a front of ten kilometers.
Coupled with this hopefulness come
reports of a sinking barometer and a
threat of snow, which would seriously
tamper Geinian operations, although
also tad for the British air service
which has hitherto done grand work
behind the German lmrf.
Retire South of Scarpe
Th British setback occurred on
the Somme and the Scarp?. The Ger
mans succeeded in crossing the
eomme from the north to- the soutn
in the neighborhood of Chipilly, com
pelling the British to fall back on the
Hamel line, bringing th Germans
nearer to their' objective. Amiens,
This will be regarded with less anx
iety here thin the new U Titian move
asainst Arras, where the British line
has hitherto held firmly. The Ger

and south of the Scarp?. The former
seems to have failed, but the south
eatn attack was successful, forcing the
British to rttira to a position nettrei
to the line they held in July. 1916.

AMERICANS GIVEN
SERVICE CROSSES
it 'i"w Virc
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY IN
PRANCE. .March 2S. (By the A. P.I
The honor of being the first men out
side the American service to receive
the distinguished service cross has
fallen upon two French officers Mi
jor Jacques Corharon, of the Frencn
mission attached to the American
forces which were at Luneville. and
Lieut. l)e La Giglais of the French ar
tillery. Both officers gare assistance
to the American troops while they t
were under heavy fire. The distiu
guished service cross has also been
awarded to the following Americans:
Colonel Douglas MacArthur. Colon.i
George E. Leach, Lieutenant Coltm-l
Win. A. Donahue, Captain Thomas T.
Handy. Captain Philip J. McAuley,
First Lieut. W. E. Word, Captain Chas.
J. Casey. Captain Lloyd D. Robs. Cap
tain Richard Smith and First Lieut. J.
P. Rosenwald of the medical corps.
All these officers distinguished
themselves in the fighting on the Lune
ville sector.
Praised by Pershing.
General Pershing has sent a special
message to the r.ext of kin of Medical
Sergeant Peterson, who was wounded
in action March 5th. and who died lat
er. Notwithstanding his wound Peter
son supervised the care of wounded
brought to the dressing station The
crosa was awarded him for his devo
tion to duty.
Major Corharon participated in an
assault on an enemy position March J
which later was occupied by the Amer
icans and the name of which it is now
permitted to give. When three lines
had been overrun. Major Corbaron vol
untarily joined an American company
which underwent a severe enemy fire
for three hours. The communication
announcing the bestowal of his cross
as sent to Washington, says:
"This officer, by his coolness and
conspicuous courage, had a marked ef
fect on the American organization un
dergoing its baptism of fire."
Helped Americans
Lieut. De La Giglais entered a quar
ry ere an American battery was tin
der a heavy fire March 5th near Pe
ronne and aided materially in encour
igin the American artillerymen.
Colonel MacArthur and Captain Han
dy participated in the March 9 en
gagement and received the same com
mendation to Vashingt6n as Major
Corbaron. Colonel Leach and Lieut
Colonel Donohue were with Lieut. i)e
La Giglais.
Captain Casey and Captain Ross com
manded companies in a dual company
recommended with the French March
5th and showed especial gallantry,
winning the commendation of their
colonel and brigade commander. Cap
tain Smith won his cross for "bold ini
tiative" and prudence in conducting
sixty-nine men. who were repairing tho
construction on communication lines
in the vicinity of Du Manonviller, to a
place of safety."
After arriving there Captain Smith
returned and brought in the. body of
a mortally wounded French'soldier fit
ter which he fell exhausted. Lieu:.
Rosenwald. while attached to an artil
lery regiment "twice entered a batter;'
position under teavy fire in order
properly to care for wounded."
Given French Cross
General Pershing has sent the fol
lowing message to the war department
at Washington:
"I request that you express my sin
cerest sympathy to the nearest rela
tive of Sergeant Peterson. Mortally
wounded, he gave instructions for the
care of wounded and made a first aid
post in order to save the lives of the
men about him. He was a gallant Sol
dier and I awarded him the distin
guished service cross."
Colonel MacArthur who was wound
ed recently, and Captain Handy wets
jmong the Americans who were award
ed the French war cross for distin
guished service on the Luneville sec
tor. There is little doubt that 191S will
'-e the banner silo building year in
Arizona.

Entered as Second Class Mail Matter at Bisbee, Arizona,
Under Act of March 8, 1879.
Just a Word In
Our Own Behalf
According to Chairman Hurley of the
shipping beard seven hundred and fifty
shipyards have been built and equipped for
the. purpose of furnishing a merchant
Major Kelly of the Douglas Internation
al announces this week in his lead editorial
a raise in his advertising rates to take ef
fect April I. "The time has arrived," de
clares the worthy major in this announce
ment, "when it becomes necessary to in
crease the advertising rates of the Interna
tional if the paper is to be kept up to its
present efficiency without an unbearable
loss to the. owners."
The Review raised its advertising rates
to take effect March I. And for the same
reason as that stated by Mojor Kelly. Most
cf our merchants accepted them in good
faith and without protest as an inevitable
result cf unusual conditions, just as this
newspaper's employes have accepted from
time to time the raise in prices of the goods
sold by our merchants.
Only one or two Bisbee firms questioned
The Review's sincerety or doubted the im
perative necessity of this step to keep its
efficiency up to the standard.
No newspaper management in its right
senses ever raises its advertising rates until
driven to the last line trenches by the hosts
of higher costs of production advancing in
massed waves.
This war has cut directly at the revenues
and profits of every newspaper in the land,
large and small, and at the same time it has
increased their expenses. TelegTaph tolls
alone have doubled, along with the price of
white paper. Major Kelly declared that he
paid three thousand dollars more for white
paper the past year than he paid the year
before.
So did The Review.
But this paper takes an eminent and
overpowering pride in carrying the flag ev
ery day of the war; in printing every cheer
ing and helpful line that it can get from near
' and distant news fields ; in striking straight
and strong for every business and indus
trial institution in this district, and in pro
claiming and inflaming the patriotism of
thi3 community.
If a business firm or a subscriber desert
a newspaper at this time of times, that can
make no difference with that newspaper.
Its duty is plain. Whether the balance
sheets show gain or loss, it must battle on.
And though its advertising rates to those
who buy and sell have been raised a trifle,
its columns are open and free to every work
and need of the war. Space valued at thou
sands of dollars has been given freely by
this newspaper (ano every other patriotic
publication in the land) to a dozen gov
ermenta! enterprises that have always been
paid for heretofore at highest rates. It has
given columns by the hundred and pages
by the score to the Liberty Loans, the Red
Cross, the enlistment campaigns and a score
of worthy and benevolent plans to help
those hurt by the war, and this is not boast
ing, either, for no paper could do less than
this plain duty and hold its head up among
its own loyal friends and supporters and
readers.
Not since Bengamin Franklin, father or
all good printers and idol of all real news
paper men, founded Poor Richard's Alma
nac, has the publisher been harder pressed
to hold his own, or needed so badly a word
of appreciation or a true friend s hand hold
ing his own while the adverse winds do
blow. You'll never miss the water. Mister

He declares further that three yards in Phii

cient to be really felt. But when we do come
in with our doughboys and our machine
guns and our airplanes and our ships and
our shells and our supplies, the tide will
turn just as surely as the tide of the sea
turns upon the beach when it has reached
its crest. No wonder the Germans have
staked all in their present drive. They dare
not wait 'till the summer wanes. The
shadow of the eagle s wing is growing larg

glanced disdainfully a few months ago at
this speck in the blue. It is hard to wait

A
RED
CROSS
WONDER
AG
What do you think, reader, has there
been too much of war in this column lately?
Yes? But what's the use of talking about
anything but the war? It is the all-abscrb-ing,
overpowering subject just now with the.
allied forces strained to the uttermost to
hold their own. The peak of the load is
upon the shoulders of our fighting men.
All other matters are pale and weak and
dim compared to this one red gleam in
Flanders. In Chicago Germans have actually
been arrested for celebrating the kaiser's
gains in France. In Wisconsin traitors and
Germans almost succeeded in nominating
a traitor for the U. S. senate. In Indiana
a woman was tarred and feathered and rid
den on a rail for starting an open German
propaganda. German success in France
means a perking up of German sympathi
zers in this country. Their lips are mute or
hypocritical only by compulsion; a reverse
for the allies and they are ready to break
forth with their true sentiments. Now is
the time to talk war and think war and act
war. Throttle the traitor in your midst.
Keep alert. Be resolute. Stand to your
guns. Be aggressive also. Speak and fear
not ; smite and fear not.
Plank suggested for the non-partisari plat
form: "We pledge ourselves to pave the
street from the depot to the south city
limits." It is to be doubted if there is a
street or road in Arizona that bears as much
travel day by day as this road down this
busy canyon, and certainly there is not a
rougher road this side of Jordan.
At last some of the Arizona boys are off to
war. Drafted men at Camp Funston have
gone, and also enlisted men from Camp
Kearney. The news in regard to this latter
contingent is especially interesting and
gratifying. The old First Arizona was in
training on the border for many a long
month before war was declared. We had
hoped that they would be called with the
famous Rainbow division, as was their
right if training and fitness were to weigh
in the balances of selection. But their time
has Come. A troop train headed eastward
early in the week bore Arizona boys cn the
first lap of the journey to the Flanders fir
ing line, 's Death! as D'Artagnan, the im
mortal swordsman, was wont to say, but
this is grand news!
Fifty of These Comfort Kits
Sent to Frisco for Soldiers
Enroute to France; News
paper Man Put in His
Thumb and Pulled Out
Enough Plums to Cover
Desk.
ERSTWHILE EASV-GOIXG SOUTH SPEEDS UP WAR
WOUK-LAUSCIIES FIRST STEEL. 1UCGEST WOOD SHIP.
Yesterday a K' Cross lady brought
j soldier's comfort kit into The Re
view office and placing it upon his
desk asked this newspaper man to
dive into it and bring forth all that it
contained, so that he might know by
sight and not by mere hearsay. And
it was a revelation. Such a small
bag. and yet so many useful things
that came out of it.
Just a flowered denim bag with a
draw string, and out of it came a pair
of wonderful homeknitted wool socks,
a heavy towel, cake of soap and shav
ing soap, pack of playing cards, pipe
and tobacco, tooth brush and paste,
envelopes, writing tablet, pencil, comb,
shoestrings, package of chewing gu-n.
handkerchief and package of post
card.i and paper pins, spool of thread
and needle.
You just put in your thumb and pull
out a plumb; that is. if you are a sol
dier boy, you do. And you are hap
pier than Jack Homer ever was with
that plumb. Every article in kit is a?
useful as the forefinger on the right
hand to a soldier boy. Every article
was weighed and considered and me i-
sured and tested before it was allowed
in that precious space. Necessity and
comfort sat as judges upon the weigh
ing and the selections. Yes, and Miss
Happiness, surely pleaded and won
space for one or two things for the sol
dier.
Fifty of these comfort kits, made,
prepared and given by the Bisbee chap
ter of the Red Cross, were sent last
evening to San Francisco for fifty sol
dier boys routed to France. That
comfort kit with all its precious in
sides upon his liesk convinces him.
He thought he knew the good the Red
Cross is doing for the army, but hon
est, he did not really know until he
put in his own hand and brought forth
all those fine and dandy things from
that small, strong, nice looking denim
bag. You have to take them out your
self, one by one. to get the hang of it
and the feeling of it that the soldier
boy will get when it conies to hand.
This newspaper belongs to the Red
Cross, Ixidy and soul, from now on.

Found Dead
In His Cabin
A man named J. Miller, was found
dead yesterday morning about nine
o'clock in his cabin. In the vicini'y of
the Copper Queen barn on Xaco road.
A coroner's jury was empannelled and
went down to. the cabin and the bosy
was found in a sitting position where
he had fallen between a stove and a
cupboard. He was in a filthy condi
tion and the odor arising from the
small room was offensive and the of
ficers and the jury could not stay in
the room but a moment at a time. It
was learned that he and a man named
Koswell who has a couple of rooms in
a hoise adjoining hud b-en celebrat
ing for the past week and were in a
drunken coiurition most of the time.
They were seen together drinking on
Wednesday night and were in the
rooms of Itoswell and their carousing
disturbed the neighbors. It is evident
that Miller went to his cabin and died
sometime during the night. He was
a man of about sixty-five years old,
and one of his eyes had been out for
sometime. There was no marks of
violence- on the body except a black
eye which he evidently obtained when
he fell from the bed and hit the
Move.
Roswell was not at home when the
officers went down there but he was
later found on the streets and was in
an intoxicated condition. He was too
drunk to get any information out of
regarding Miller, and was locked up
by Ihe officers so that he would be
sober this morning at te no'chx-k so as
to be used as a witness. He staled
that Miiler had been drinking denafir
ed alcohol for the past week ami that
he had tried to get him to quit and
bnv good whiskey like be did.
The coroner's jury will convene this
morning at Judge High's court irt teiv
o'clock to investigate the cause ef his
death. The body was taken in charge
by the Hennessy I'udertakiug compa
ny ami was buried yesterday after
noon. No papers of any kind were
found in the cabin to lead to the iden
tity of the man or whether or not he
bad any relatixes.

WHEN YOU WAKE
UP DRINK-GLASS
OF HOT WATER
Wash the poisons and toxins from Ij
system before putting more !'
food Into stomach. !
Wash yourself on the inside before
ireaktast like you do on the outside.
This is vastly more importaM because
he skin pores do not absorb impuri
ips into the blood, causing illness,
vhile tl e bowel pores do.
For every ounce of food and drink
'aken into the stomach, nearly a:i
unce of waste material must be car
ded out of the body. If this waste ma
terial is not eliminated day by day it
luickly ferments and generates poi
ions. gases and toxins which are ab
sorbed or sucked into the blood
;t ream, through the lymph ducts
vhich should suck only nourishment
o sustain the body.
A splendid health measure is tc
lrink, before breakfast each day, a
;lass of real hot water with a tea
poonful of limestone phosphate in it.
which is a harmless way to wash these
poisons. gases and toxins from file
stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels;
thus cleansing, sweetening ami ficsh
ening the entire alimentary canal be
fore putting more food into ti e stom
ach. A quarter pound of limestone phos
phate costs but very' little at the drii
store but is sufficient to make anyone
an enthusiast on inside-bathing. Aiv.
