NEW MEXICO FACES
TROUBLE IN GETTING
SHIPMENTS OF BOOZE
DENVER. Colo., August 10. A sec
tion of northwestern New Mexico will
have a good deal more difficulty in se
curing small shipments of liquor here
after as a result of a recent opinion
of the attorney general of Colorado.
The portion of New Mexico involved
is that which receives its supplies
from the outside world through Jarosa,
Colo., whence a stage line runs to Los
Pino, Costilla and other New Mexico
town. The attorney general held that
a stage line was not a common carrier
within the meaning of the statutes
permitting the transportation of liquor
within the state. Only railroads, the
attorney general held, can qualify as
carriers under this law.
FORMER ANNAPOLIS
STUDENTS MEET OLD
TEACHER IN WAR ZONE
BASE AMERICAN FLOTILLA IN
BRITISH WATERS. Aug. 10. It was
like an old home week here the other
day when an unusually large number
Of destroyers came into port and con
sequently a larger number of erst
while middies, now officers in Uncle
Sara's army, came eshore. Everybody
said hello to everybody else. A Geor
gian drawled out to a Texan, while the
man from New York and the one from
New England could easily be spotted
by their manner of speech. Many
were former navy men, who had ser
ved for a brief period after being grad
uated from Annapolis, but who re
sponded to the call when the United
States came into the war.
"They were putting up a dummy bat
tleship right under my office window
in Union Square when I decided to
come back," explained an ensign from
New York. ''Every time I rooked out
of my window I saw that ship getting
bigger. When its masts topped the
trees in the park I couldn't do any
more work, so I just closed my desk
and offered myself. And here I am,
and mighty glad of it. Hello Jack ."
An old classmate from Boston inter
rupted to lead the New YOrk ensign
back to bis schooldays.
"Reminds me of a lodge meeting,"
sang out a cheerful individual from
Atlanta as he beamed on the crowd of
familiar faces:
"It would be hard to find a more ami
able, good natured crowd of yVung men
anywhere in the world. God bless 'era,"
said one ensign. "Tomorrow they
would go cheerfully to the duty of
hunting the elusive periscope."
It is this almost boyhoVd enthusiasm
among full grown men that has en
deared the Americans to everybody
with whom they come in contact here.
"Yanks," the villagers call them in af
fectionate admiration.
One of the pleasant surprises for the
younger officers from the classes from
1906 10 1911 occurred the other day
when they met their teacher of English
and marine law at Annapolis in the
person of the American consul here.
"He's got a pretty good line on all
of us," said one of the former mid
dies; probably recalling an incident
of boyhood mischief at sctOoL The
consul winked knowingly. "Its mighty
fine to see so many of those young
sters again," mused the concul after
he had finished shaking hands all
around.

(Special to The Review.)
DOUGLAS, August 10. Venturo
Amaya, son of a wealthy rancher re
siding sear Cumpas, Ooa., was arrest
ed here yesterday by Justin C. Daspita
agent of the department of justice on
charges of white slavery preferred
against him by Marguerite R. Garcia,
the alleged woman In the case. As a
result of her testimony it is expected
that a more serious charge may ba
placed against Amaya, who, according j
to the woman, came to Douglas and
crossed into Mexico in order to avoid
appearing before military exemption
board, believing that he would be
drafted into the army. His status, in
the event of his charge being proven,
would be that of a deserted from the
army, under the recent ruling of Provost-Marshal
General Crowder. This
phase of the case now is being invest!
gated by Mr. Daspita and if substan
tiating evidence van be secured, a
charge probably will be filed against
him.
The woman became angry with
Amaya, with whom, according to her
story, she bad lived in Sacramento,
Calif., for eight months as man and
wife prior to their coming to this sec
iton. In her language, the cause of
her anger was:
"I bad $220 when I left Sacramento
with Venturo Amaya. After he had
spent all of it but $17 he said he did
not need me any more."
Amaya will be given a preliminary
hearing Monday before United States
Commissioner H. C. Buemler.
The woman told the arresting officer
that Amaya had registered for the mil
itary draft June 5, but soon began to
worry for fear he would be drafted for
military serv ice. She declares he made
her buy tickets for Duglas because
he was afraid the officers might de
tain him if he attempted to leave the
city. However, he paid $14 excess on
her three trunks . The woman claims
to be an American, a native of New
Orleans and the lawful wife of a
Tomas Garcia.
The couple arrived here about July
19, having left Sacramento on the
sixteenth. After staying one night
in Douglas they crossed the interna
tional boundary and since then have
been stopping with friends. Amaya
crossed the border here yesterday for
the first time and was picked up. He
is in Jail in default of a bond.

SEATTLE, Wash., Aug. 10. Hans

The two, with Alvo von Alvensleben,

U.S. UNDERSTANDS
SAYS DR. MEYER
Former Harvard Professor De
clares Roosevelt Warned
Him Against Kaiser Trying
to Get Into Pacific
(By Review Leased Wire).
AMSTERDAM, Aug. 10. Dr. Kuno
Meyer, the well known Berlin univer
sity professor, who resigned as ex
change professor t Harvard univer
sity in 1915 and who has spent a long
time in the United States, contributes
a notable article to the Taeglische
Rundschau entitled
Our War Aims
Enemy Eyes."
The writer says that on his return
to Germany last May nothing struck
him more forcibly than the fact that
after three years of war the people at
home still were jubbling why the whole
world was against them and still were
trying, apparently with hopes of suc
cess, to explain the German stand
point. Dr. Meyer admits that the hatred
of Germany has sunk deep Into the
souls of entire foreign nations.
"It Is a perfectly genuine feeling,"
he says, "although utterly unreason
able, and if we spOke with angels'
voices we would still be refused a
hearing."
On the other hand, the professor
continues, there is an unmistakable
fear, not unmixed with admiration, of
German strength and greatness, and
says :
America Termed Fair
"In America, any how, they haw
found no inclination to belittle our
achievements save in newspapers
which have always been hostile. It
was the fear that we may be victorious
and that the n.Oney with which Amer
ica has backed England, France and
Russia might be lost which was the
consideration that impelled America
to enter the war."
Dr. Meyer proceeds:
"If we win, our enemies naturally
will concede to us the right to impose
terms which are advantageous to us.
This much has been admitted frankly
to me personally by several person
ages belonging to enemy nations, and
by nOne more clearly and definitely
than by Colonel Roosevelt, who in
May, 1916, spontaneously told me and
my wife in conversation that an Aus-tro-Gennan
victory would entitle us to
compensation and indemnities. At
that time there was still some remote
chance of his election to the presi
dency and although he professed in
credulity at such a possibility, he
sketched out a program which he
would follow if he entered the White
House.
Roosvelt Is Quoted
"He then went on talking Of Amer
ica's participation in the peace confer
ence. He emphasized the necessity of
restoring Belgium and hoped for an in
dependent Poland. He added that the
victor would be entitled to Insist upon
securities that conditions leading to
the war would not Occur again.. Thus,
in the event of a victory by the cen
tral powers, he said, it was self-evi
dent that we would
reconstruct our!
frontiers so that invasion would not
be so easy.
"Colonel Roosevelt further spoke Of '

ABNORMAL CLIMATIC
CONDITIONS AFFECT
BACKYARD GARDENS
LEWISTON, Idaho, August 10. Ab
normal climatic conditions are respon
sible for a condition in numerous back
yard gardens in this section, planted
as the result of the food prepared
ness campaign, according to Profes
sor Q. M. Osborne, head of the agricul
ture department of the Lewiston Nor

have been perplexed and dismayed to
find upon opening their potato patches,
that the tubers are only about half de

Professor Osborne is credited with
saying there is no known remedy for
potato sprouting, and advises the
quick removal of the potatoes from
the ground, even though they are not
fully developed. He says they should
be placed in a cool cellar.

The declaration of principles adopt

Hisses, cat calls and hooting, last
ing many minutes greeted one of the
several assertions made by Mrs. Rosa
McKay before four hundred women
of the Warren District, yesterday at
the Y. M. C. A. In addition. Governor
Thomas E. Campbell and Attorney
General Wiley E. Zones were present
at the meeting.
Mrs. McKay, at the Invitation of the
chairman of the meeting. Mrs. C. H.
Hunt, spoke for some time. She re
counted, at length what she alleged
had been the barbarous method of de
poning men from Bisbee on July 12.
She declared she had advised her
nephew to accompany the deported
men out of Bisbee and acknowledge.!
he had been asked to get out of the
cars, after they were loaded.
Governor Introduced.
In speaking of the conditions In
Bisbee, Mrs. McKay aroused the ire
of the women present by stating that
troops were necessary in the Warren,
District to protect the women and chil
dren. When she made this statement
a storm of hooting, cat calls and hiss
ing broke out and only subsided when
the chairman rapped for order several
times.
After the meeting had been called
to order by Mrs. Hunt. Mr. C. F. Phil-
brook arose and in a few words intro
duced Governor Campbell to those
present. Earlier in the day the Gov
ernor bad been waited on by a commit
tee of the women and induced to ap
pear before the meeting. With the
attorney general he did so.
Governor Campbell, when introduc
ed, made a brief statement. He called
attention to conditions, past and pres
ent and declared that a man, from a
distance, must look at the general sit
uation in a broad way.
Is Here To Help.
"You can't go on as you have for
the past three weeks", said the gover
nor. "I am here to help you and see
that you are fully protected in your
rights as citizens and to bring to a
higher plane the law, which must btj
upheld."
Again numerous women made state
ments before the assembled people.
Stories were told of intimidation and
insults, heaped on both women and
men, by the I. W. W.'s before they
were eliminated from the Warren
District.
In one instance, the wife ot a de
ported miner spoke. She said she bo
lieved that wrong had been done on
both sides but added that the men i:i
Columbus had been the worst offend
ers and that conditions in His bee war
ranted the belief that the best thin?
had been done in the entire affair.
Mrs. McKay, one of those who
spoke, averred that the men were de
ported without food and water. Im
mediately following her statement Mrs.
Whit well of Warren, stated that this
was far from the truth and that ample
provisions had been placed in the tars
and orders given for an additional sup
ply to be given the men at Lee Sta
tion, some miles outside of Douglas.

STEM, ATTACKED
PUTS INTO PORT,
BACK TO SEA
LOXDOX, Aug. 10. Germany's pres
ent method of sea warfare is one of
absolute despair, declared Admiral Sir
John Jellicoe, first sea lord of the Brit
ish admiralty, in a public address the
other day. "The navy, assisted by the
other allies, is doing its best and
right well is the American navy help
ing ns," he continued. "Even the ad
miralty is doing its best, assisted by
a good dea) of criticism."
Admiral Jellicoe was speaking at a
meeting held to inaugurate a move
ment to establish a fund for sailors
to be called "King George's Fund for
Sailors," under the presidency of Act
ing Lieutenant Prince George. Pay
ing a warm tribute to the British mer
chant marine, the admiral said the
sailor never knew a moment when the
ship might not be sunk under him and
he very seldom saw the enemy which
sank him. At the best, he took to
the boats often 100 to 200 miles from
shore and often underwent terrible
experiences because the enemy shelled
the b'oats frequently after the men
got into them. The only effect of that
treatment on the British sailor was to
make him keen to get back to sea
again' to have a chance of getting his
own back again. j

Sir John gave some instances of the
spirit which he said animated the sail
ors of the mercantile marine. Among
them were the following:
The Anglo-Californian was attacked
and shelled for two and one-half hours
by a submarine. After the attack had
lasted one and one-half hours and the
ship had been hit frequently the cap
tain decided that any attempt to save
his vessel was hopeless. As she was
being abandoned he intercepted a wire
less message from a destroyer order
ing him to hold 'jn as long as possible.
The captain and ships company prompt
ly went back to their vessel. The sub
marine continued to shell the ship, the
master and eight hands were killed
and seven of the crew were wounded,
but the ship returned to port.
The steamer Fahu Beach was at
tacked by a submarine and hit in sev
eral places and two members of the
crew were injured. A young appren
tice who was wounded remained at
the wheel throughout the attack and
refused fj leave his post and the ves-j
sel was brought in in safety.
She was later armed with a gun
and sank one of two submarines which
attacked her.
In the Adriatic recently three Aus
trian cruisers came up to one of the
drifters named Gowanlee and summon
ed her to surrender. The captain, with
a six-pounder gun, engaged the cruis
ers and brought his snip away in safe
ty. One of the deck hands has his leg
shattered but continued to work and
fire his gun throughout the acti'jn.

"legally speaking it is not treason,"
answered the governor.
Immediately several women asked
what kind of treason such actions con
stituted. "This is a most extraordinary meet
ing," answered the governor, "and I
came to Bisbee to investigate; not to
be interrogated. Such a procedure
would be embarrassing to me and also
to you. I merely state this in pass
ing." And the executive sat down.
One of the interesting features of
the meeting took place when the wo
men were asked to extend a rising
vote on the question as to which kind
of unrest was desireable, that which
existed before July 12 or that which
exists at the present! time. This haJ
been called to the attention of those
present by the governor in his first
statement. The answer of the women
was unmistakable. It favored tho
present "unrest."

BY REVIEW
(By Review Leasea Wire)
NEW YORK, August 10. Loss in
some of the motor and railroad issues
growing out of a-renewed liquidation
had an unsettled effect on sentiment
today and prices in nearly all quarters
recorded depreciation. The market
displayed an appearance of strength in
the forenoon, attribuated chiefly in
realizing by shorts and as this demand
exhausted Itself the market was found
wanting for substantial buying power.
The street seems to be possessed with
the fear that the price fixing program
of the government will be more drastic
than formerly anticipated, and the
natural sequence is that holders of
shares of companies that may be ma
terially affected by same are showing
a keener willingness to reduce hold
ings. There is little doubt but that federal
supervision of prices will curtail fu
ture earning power of many of our in
dustrial concerns and while the ad
ministration apparently does not de
sire to hamper industrial expansion
still the fact that many of the indus
trial issues established at prevailing
price levels are based on present big
earnings it seems only reasonable to
assume that If net results are to be
Impaired materially in the near future,
security prices are likely to be revised
downward.

THE WOBBLY PROBLEM.
The heaviest blow ever struck at the I. W. W. men
ace was the Bisbee deportation of July 12. Every western
and northern community now afflicted by this plague of
loaferdom and intimidation is looking to Bisbee as the
one bright light in the wilderness of industrial unrest pro
moted by the men who will do everything but work. Bis
bee solved the entire question by one sudden and terrify
ing blow. She ended her copper strike and brought com
plete peace and calm to the 'entire district in a day.
But her work did not end on that eventful July morn
ing. Never for a moment since has her vigilance relaxed.
Stragglers missed by the big net had to be gathered up
one at a time and sent away. Sullen, vicious, revengeful
men by the score, all carrying red cards in their pockets
and red hate in their hearts, have had to be turned back
every day from our gates.
Bisbee is most fortunately situated in this regard.
Walled in by mountains and sheer heights, there are only
the upper and lower passes of the valley and a gulch or
two by which one from the outside may enter here. It is
'simple and practical to piard these great doors made by
nature when she ringed this camp with her battlements.
Only the avowed enemies of industry have been barred.
Only the agitators and redflaggers propagandists have
been turned away. Whosoever will but these may come.
Even men of the Columbus camp have been admitted here
and have gone back to work.
And the west is still looking to us to keep our beacou
light burning. Our bold stroke aroused public sentiment
to the unbearable tactics of these enemies of our system
of civilisation as it had never been roused before. But
even more than our swift, sudden and successful act of
the deportation has our resolute stand since then to
keep the district clean inspired honest men everywhere
to fight these disrupters to the end.
Bisbee has taken the lead in successful resistence to
the I. W. W. menace. Every industrial centre In the grip
of this serpent has taken new heart at our daring and our
resolution. The means have never been questioned by
L 11C ltrtll lUdOB Ui UIC 111.111 inivii l j . . " -" -
one cares how a snake is killed just so it is dead. And
besides, the country Is at war, and war breeds brave and
resolute hearts to meet disorders at home as well as
perils abroad. ,
No country ever entered a war but that had traitors
at home with which to deal. And no country ever won a
war that did not deal with them promptly and deter
minedly. Witness the esse of Russia since the revolu
tion. Bisbee is making a bold and persevering effort to
keep her copper mines at full capacity. Her example
is an inspiration. She is worse hated by the wobblie3
than any other city in America. Bisbee is proud of the
enemies she has made. To keep them away is still her
problem. To lead the way in a movement that will break
the power of the I. W. W. In the west is, to our mind,
a most worthy and patriotic ambition.
Governor Campbell Is here to investigate this stand
this city has taken. It is a hard situation to solve. But
then all situations arising from wobbly propagandas are
hard to solve. The wobbly has low cunning as well cs
nerve and energy and perseverence in a bad cause. He
knew that during the war was the best time to strike. He
knows that there is no special law as yet to cover his
particular and obnoxious case. He can always be de
pended upon to go as far as he dares. He will dissemble,
threaten or whine as he thinks may serve him best. He
will burn or beg, depending entirely upon the circum
stances. The governor and our citizens have only the best in
terest of this community at heart. The governor has the
law to enforce and our citizens have their community to
protect. Surely both can be done. The wobbly is o.i
mighty thin ire. He has ventured too far. It may well be
that this gubernatorial visit that he and his sympathizers
provoked in the hope of undoing all that Bisbee has done
will act as a boomerang and recoil upon his own guiltv
head.
. Sprinfgield. Illinois, has a Sheriff Wheeler, too. And
this Sheriff Wheeler also has a strike on his hands.
Troops have been called to the Illinois capital to suppress
rioting in connection with the street car strike. Evi
dently the Illinois Wheeler was not so successful in han
dling a difficult situation as the Arizona Wheeler.
GERMANY IN A NEW ROLE
After having destroyed two neutral countries and pro
voked five or six more to war, Germany now assumes the
role of their protector and their friend. The wolf guard
ing the lambs. The German press is all wrought up over
the American embargo on foodstuffs and certain merchan
dise to that group of northern neutrals that have been
feeding and supplying the Teutons for the money there
was in it "Wilson's Brutal Methods," is one of the head
lines in a German paper. "Brutal!" It is to laugh. Com
ing from the Prussian mouth this word sounds so weak
and vain. German brutalities are generally unspeakable,
indescribable. But when America decides to keep her
foodstuffs out of Germany her decision is classed as bru
tality to the neutrals.
It may be hard on Germany and upon the little clique
of Norwegian and Swedish and thrifty Holland traders,
but compared to Germany's skull and crossbones tactics
it is as kindly and humane as the action of the Good
Samaritan on his way to Jericho.
The W'eser Zeitung, the shipping and annexationist
organ, has two fervent, feverish columns on the sub
ject, saying in part:
"People thought him (Wilson) a theorist and doc
trinaire," says the Zeitung, "but one'who was neverthe
less convinced that he had the mission of protecting
International law and the rights of neutrals. This illu
sion is dissipated, for the American government is not
only fighting actively against the central powers, but is
also taking the sharpest measures against the neutral
neighbors of Germany."
The Los Angeles Times, speaking of the ego of Hin
denburg, declares that his head is so swollen that "be
has to put on his helmet with a shoehorn."
I
Congressman Johnson, of South Dakota, has a bill
ready to introduce providing that men who are exempted
from army service do not escape work of some sort. The
chairman of the committee on military affairs is studying
this measure and it may be tacked as an amendment on
the general staff bill. Hard lines for the wobblies if it
becomes a law.
Japanese envoys now enroute to this country have
Important questions to settle. Japan holds two trump
cards in the World War. She has a magnificently trained
army that is badly needed on the eastern battle front,
and she has a merchant marine that is badly needed by
both Italy and the United States to move their troops,
the one to the Greek front and the other to the French
front. Japan will play these cards If America will con
sent to an open door in China.
"Apache Indians join I. W. W.'s" is a significant and
happy headline In a great metropolitan daily of recent
date. What an appropriate union! They probably have
more things in common than any other tribes upon the
earth at this time. Neither the Indian or the wobbly
will work. Both delight in destruction. Both are but
wait? This is all a rank injustice to the Indians. The
Apaches of the old days of Geronino and the Apache Kid
might well be classed with the I. W. W. but the Indian
of today is much more peaceable and industrious than he
used to be.
Jeanette Rankin, the only woman ever elected to
congress, will, if she keeps on through her term as she
has begun, make it impossible for any other woman to be
elected to that body. Her "breaks" have been bad and
not far apart. Her particular hobby is to try to tak a
hand in things about which she knows the least. Of
course she uses a woman's privilege of changing her
mind, and of course she talks too much. But these things
would readily be forgiven her if she only had a woman's
Intuition. Only a long succession of silly and hysterical
blunders mark her official path.
The women of the Warren district, God bless them,
are playing a no less important part than the men In
holding this community up to the light as a clean and re
spectable place. Called from their homes and their work
yesterday morning with only a few hours' notice they
gathered in force at the Y. M. C. A. and showed the attor
ney general of the state the true and real state of affairs
as no man or set of men could ever have shown him.
And they repeated today with the governor. A nation la
known by its women; likewise a community. These
women are splendid in their rally to the defense of the
fair name of their city. They have already eclipsed the
exploit of their menfolks. No cause is just or risht that
cannot bring the women to its aid. With them on Its
side it is no longer a cause, it Is the enactment of history.

CONSTIPATION
And Soar Stomach Caused His
Lady Much Suffering. Black
Draught Relieved.
Meadorsville, Ky. Mrs. Pearl Pat
rick, of this place, writes: "I was
very constipated. I had sour stomach
and was so uncomfortable. I went to
the doctor. 'He gave me some pills.
They weakened me and seemed to
tear up my digestion. They would
gripe me and afterwards It seemed
I was more constipated than, before.
I beard of Black-Draught and de.
cided to try it. I found it just what I
needed. It was an easy laxative, and
not bad to swallow. My digestion soon
improved. I got well of the sour stom
ach, my bowels soon seemed normal,
no more griping, and I would take a
dose now and then, and was in good
shape.
I cannot say too much for Black
Draught for it is the finest laxative
one can use."
Thedford's Black-Draught has for
many years been found of great value
in the treatment of stomach, liver and
bowel troubles. Easy to take, gentle
and reliable in Its action. leaving no
bad after-effects, it has won the prai3e
of thousands ot people who have used
It, NC-135
Is it not strange that this most modern and terrible
of all wars should have produced more brave men and '
less great leaders than any war'in history? Never have
those historic battle plains of the western front seen such j
slaughter as reddens them this day. Heroes a many have i
fought over them but none braver than the French rank
and file at Verdun, or the English legions in the battles '
of the Somme, or the Canadians at Vimy nidge, or the
Australians at Mouchy. or the Scots at Bullecourt. or :
the Irish at Combles, or the Prussian Guard at Yprca. '
No one expected such valor in these days of inventions
and higher education. Romance was dead, the writers
told us. The sword, weapon of all heroes, is a weapon
of the past. Great statesmen and great strategists' will
arise in numbers in this war, it was foretold. But of
either political or military leaders that can compare
with the great ones of old times there have been none
at all. This Is the private's war, and the regimental offi
cers' war. If the human race has decreased In stature
and in strength, as the scientists declare, at least it ha3
not decreased In spirit. The heroes of this war are as
numberless as the sands on the seashore.

Indian Land
Sale Under
United States
Government
Supervision
Nearly one-half million acres belong
ing to the Choctaw Indians in south
eastern Oklahoma, same to be sold by
the Interior Department.
Residence on land not required, nei
ther Is it necessary to go East to ob
tain same, as a demonstration and
schooling car sent out by the McAles
ter Real Estate Exchange, of McAles
ter, Okla., is now here for the purpose
of schooling the public in the manner
and method of securing the lands,
which consist, of mixed farming, tim
ber and grazing lands, all located in
the probable oil and gas belt of Okla
homa, where drilling is now going on.
These lands can be made to bring
in a nice profit immediately after pur
chasing through the sale of timber
rights and through leasing for farm
ing and oil development, all of which
can be arranged without the owner
having to go East
The lands are near railroads and
market towns and in many cases adjoin
cultivated farms, thereby insuring a
ready market for all natural resources
and products taken from the land.
Crops on both the North and South
can be grown, which insures ample
harvest, as this section of Oklahoma
enjoys from 40 to 45 inches rainfall
per year.
The lands are appraised at prices
ranging from $2.00 to $7.00 per acre,
which merely takes into consideration
the timber value only, and was based
upon the government appraisement,
made in 1911, when timber appraisers
considered only trees which measured
11 inches at the chest line. There
fore, the timber on each tract alone
is sufficient to net a profit equal to
the cost of the land, making all profits
derived from farming and for oil pur
poses a profit over and above the ac
tual cost.
The car will be in town a few days,
and will be open from 9 a. m. to 8 p. m..
including Sundays.
Visit same and see the wonderful
exhibit of Western developments and
learn of these valuable tracts.
