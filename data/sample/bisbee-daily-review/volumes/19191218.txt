Increases in Rates Asked and
Recognition of Tuberculosis
as Disability
WASHINGTON, Doc. 17. Speedy
action was demanded of congress on
all matters affecting the govern
ment's dealing with former service
men, in resolutions adopted tonight
by national and state officers of the
American Legion at the conclusion of
a three day conference with officials
of the war risk insurance bureau.
The resolutions also warned congress
of the imperative necessity of-providing
relief for men who have met with
injustice through the inadequacy of
laws under which the present insur
ance and compensation regulations
are . administered.
At the conclusion of the discussion,
delegates summed up their views of
needs of the former service men, as
demonstrated by their study of the
situation, as follows:
"The Wasbn and Sweet bills should
bei passed by congress forthwith.
"The bureau f war, risk Insurance,
federal board for vocational educa
tion and the public health service
especially the sections of the two lat
ter agencies dealing with ex-service
men should be combined under aj
single neaa, ana one representative
of the unified agency should be
placed in -each state..
"The following modifications re
garding insurance should be adopted:
Want Lump Sum.
"Premiums should be payable
through the loal postoffices. Re
strictions based on relationship of
beneficiaries should be removed. The
amount of the insurance under both
term and converted policies should
be payable at the option of the ap
plicant in a lump sum or otherwise,
and if the applicant has exercised no
option then at the option of the bene
ficiary. A partial disability benefit
should be paid under all policies.
"That all disabled persans having
war risk insurance while in the hos
pitals, or while receiving benefits un
der the war risk insurance act, or
while receiving training, Bhould have
the payment of all insurance pre
miums remitted during the continu
ance of their disability and training.
That all forms used shall be simpli
fied so as to be made aa short and
simple as possible.
"All men receiving vocational trala
ing should have 4heir maintenance
pay in full and a vocational train
ing official should be permanently
stationed at every hospital where dis
abled ex-service persons are belirg
cared for. Immediate and adequate
steps should be taken to reach all
persons at present entitled to voca
tional training and not receiving it.
and to acquaint them fully with their
rights and to give training to all who
are entitled to it, recreational fea
tures should be added to the vocation
al training program.
"Substantial increases In all the
present rates should be granted. Im
mediate, liberal and effective action
should be taken on all claims.
"Persons suffering from tuberculos
is should be considered as 'totally
disabled' during the continuance of
the disease and as compensable ac
cordingly. -Hospital facilities at present pro
vided are Inadequate and congress
should make a far more liberal pro
vision for same."

Definite Action on Pact Is Ex
pected by Party Leaders
in January
WASHINGTON, Dec. 17. Expres
sions that seemed to point toward a
reopening of the peace treaty fight
within a few weeks, were voiced on
the senate floor today when the sub
ject bobbed up in the midst of con
sideration of the railroad bill.
The symposium or views that went
into the record during the brief de
bate, included opinions from virtual
ly all factions of the divided senate
membership, but they all struck a
note of conciliation. Differing wide
ly in their suggestions for a solution,
they stood together on the general
proposition that politics ought to be
forgotten and that the senate, acing
independently of executive opinion,
ought to do something promptly to
end suspense and establish a state of
peace.
Predict Action
The discussion reflected the trend
of negotiations which have been in
progress privately among senators for
an agreement that would get the
question finally out of the way. There
was increased activity in that direc
tion during the day and some of the
leaders predicted some formal action
early in the new year.
Senator Knox of Pennsylvania, a
leader in the "irreconcilable" Repub
lican group of treaty opponents and
a member of the foreign relations
committee, brought the subject to the
floor by another attempt to get be
fore the senate his two resolutions'
to establish a state of peace. The
effort was blocked, but he obtained
unanimous consent to send the meas
ures to the committee, where he ex
pects to rene whis requect for action.
Both Responsible
Responsibility for the delay was de
clared by Senator Smith to be about
"fifty-fifty between the two parties."
Senator Myers said both partloa
had been "making a political football
of the treaty."

Committee Requests Attor

Settlement
WASHINGTON. Doc. 17. Attorney
General Palmer will appnar before the
senate committee investigating the
coal situation Friday or Saturday.
Chairman Frclinghuysen announced
tonight. The attorney general wtu
be asked to exgl.tta. the basis of the
agreement which finally ended the
strike of bituminous miners and
caused the resignation of former Fuel
Administrator Garfield.
J. W. Dawson, an expert on coal
production and cost, who was the
only witness heard today by the seu.
ate committee, expressed the belier
that the jyresent wafifs paid miners
were sufficient, and that "any in
creases granted them must eventual
ly come from the public's pocket."
No Big Profits
"Coal operators are not making big
profits this year." Mr. Dawson said,
"and in ray opinion they cannot en
tirelv absorb the 14 per cent increase
which the government has already al
lawed. Senator Frelinfchuysen asked the
witness to suggest a method of avoid
ing nation-wide strikes such as that
just ended.
"President Wilson and Attorney
General Palmer took the best method
when they istarted out to make the
miners union obey the Lever law. and
call of the strike," Dawson replied.
"But later they reversed that posi
tion," Senator Frelinghuysen inter
jected. "Unfortunately, yes," responded
Dawson. '
The United Mine Workers union
collects annually $11,000,000 in dues.
Dawson tqld the committee, and ought
to be held responsible for contracts.
"You can't have collective bargain
ing unless both men and employers
can be made to live up to their con
tracts," he added.

the time with County Supervisor C.

chase of the trail by the government
for $77,118. The trail during thelast
five years has netted the county the
equivalent of 4 per cent on an invest

county accepted that proposition,
there would be no strings. at Uulud to
the maimer in -which it should spend

CHRISTMAS DAY
CARPEHT1ER AS I KNEW HIM '
REDS' VICTORS
Reports from Douglas, cpmbined
with local gossip among the fans
about town, presage the largest at
tendance at any boxing match yet
held in the Warren district when Kid
Palmer, welterweight champion of the
United t Sates army, and Frank
Loughrey, the Bisbee boxer, step into
the. ring in the open air arena in War
ren park on Christmas Day.
Welterweights have occupied the
pugilistic limelight in southern Ari
zona since the state boxing law was
pased, owing to the wealth of first
class material in that division. With
such boxers as Loughrey, Palmer,
Russell Chambers, Eddie Huse, Ed
die oJhnson, Johnny Meyer, oJhnny
Celmars and -others appearing in Ari
zona bouts1, the welters have filled f
a large share of the field, and welter
weight matches have alweys drawn
big houses. .
In Kid Palmer and Frank Lough-1
rey, iwnut'e ians nave me cream or,
thfl welter division in these parts.
That is one reason why the match is
attracting such widespread - Interest.
Loughrey in particular has won a big
following of Bisbee fans. He has ap
peared in four bouts here three
times against Russell Chambers and
once against oJhnny Celmars, and his
every appearance has brought a bout
filled from gong to gong with' fast
and furious action.
Palmer has big prestige owing to
his possession of the army title, and
Bisbee fans were much s impressed
with the easy way in which he dis

EDITORS NOTE Jimmy Branson
was the overseas boxing director for
the Y. M. C. A. He promoted and
refereed boxing bouts rt the famous
Palace de Grr.ce, and the Cirque de
Paris. He participated in more than
700 fights in army camps, touring
France, Germany, Italy and Belgium.
He w.is official referee for' the A. E
F. ?.nd inter-sllied tournaments. He
is one of the few men in Americ?. to
day who really knew the European
champion. It was a keen disappoint
ment to .Bronson when Carpentier's
injured ' hnid prevented him from
meeting Bob Martin, America's pride.
But he saw the' Frenchman often and
they became quite chummy. Carpen
tier has in Bronson a great admirer,
even though the American manager
feels certain some day his own fight
er, Bob Martin, will meet and beat the
Frenchman as well sts anyone else
standing between him an the title.
By JIMMY BRONSON.
The coming clash between . George3
Carpentier,.' European champion, and
Jack Dempsey. will attract the great
est throng in ring history. It will
far outdraw the big Willard-Dempsey
affair regardless of its location.
If the fight is held in America,
many thousands of French and Eng
lish from all over the United States
will be on hand to root for Carpen
tier and many more may be expected
to come overseas to cheer on their
champion.
This bout should draw close to a
million-dollar gate anywhere.
France wants the match badly be
cause they love their fighting idol
so. I do not believe any professional
champion in the world's history ever
has had such an intensely loyal and
loving following.
If the bout is staged in France no
doubt it will be held in Pershing
stadium, a great piece of American
engineering skill given to France by
our famous commander at the close
of the inter-allied gamesAjThe stad
ium was built by American engineers
after the French had failed in the
task. It was turned over to Parsh
ing through the medium of the Y. M.
C. A. Forty thousand could see the
fight there and would.
There is ho place in England now
suitable for holding the fight. In eith

would have to be erected.

- TUCSON, Ariz., Dec. 17. It was
from a sketch, according to Mrs.
Mary Austin, lecturer and writer, who
is making a sojourn of several week3
in this city, that she was enabled to
first understand the fascination of
the prize fight for the average Amer
ican man. Prior to this understand
ing, Mrs. Austin had thought of the
sport only as brutal and revolting, ap
pealing to the worst in man. but after
seeing the sketch with the bloodiness
Withheld, she was able to see the
fight in a more truthful appeal, which
is of human in action.
"The Anglo-Saxon race, from which
we are descendant, has always com
prised the greatest adherents of the
prize fight, and has also given the
greatest inventors of machinery that
the world has 'ever known. For ma
chinery in action there has existed
for the race what amounts to a pas
sion, and this action is found in a
relative way in the prize fight," she
says. i
Mrs. Austin has also discussed the
Frenchman's attitude toward the
fight. She says that he has accepted
it with a bit of bewilderment. Hav
ing no equivalent in the French lan
guage, he has termed it I e Box.
While her understanding of the
fight has made her willing to let the
American man have the sport, she
say that it has made her in no wise
willing to share in the witnessing of
it wilh him.

To drive a car, providing It's a reliable and reasonable

Dort buyers who in the past years have paid much

in Dort ownership.
Not alone because Dort up-keep and operating ex

PORTA'S CULPABILITY
THE world in general accepted the prediction of Professor Porta
that this planet would go to smash yesterday, in a spirit or
levity. As far as the absurdity of the astronomer's unscientific
contention is concerned, this is the consideration it merited. The
professor was a boon to the newspaper cartoonists ahd "colyuni" con
ductors, grown jaded with sketching and joke-making concerning the
wealthy laboring classes, congressional investigations and the high
cost of living.
But Professor Porta's "end of the world" prediction has its more
serious side a side founded in the gullibility and susceptibility to '
every new form of sensational superstition on the part of large num
bers of the unthinking. The power wielded by Professor Porta m
finding such widespread publicity for his wild assertion is dire to
contemplate in some of its consequences. What of the Mexican peons
reported to have committed suicide because of their blind faith in
the Porta prediction, and the ignorant terror engendered of that
faith? May not their blood be considered as on the head of this
misguided astronomer? What of that more or less numerous class
of the foolish who greet every senseless prediction of the end of the
world by dispossessing themselves of all their property and personal
savings, and quitting their useful occupations on the appointed day?
What of the still more numerous class of the doubting but uncritical
who spent sleepless Tuesday nights to which they will never confess?
Supposing, in, the natural course of atmospheric disturbances, a
violent electrical storm had yesterday struck" Bisbee or any other
portion of the habitable globe? Who can not easily imagine the
wild terror and panic such a storm on the date of the Porta predic
tion would create in the breasts of hundreds, believing they were
witnessing in such a storm the actual fulfillment of the predicted
world catastrophe?
The rational thinker realizes the absurdity of all such predic
tions as that of Professor Porta. He takes into account the myraid
hundreds of centuries through which organic life has functioned on
this planet, from monadic autogenesis to' the existence of man as a
species. He knows that the existence of man on the planet is but
a fleeting second in time to the existence of organic life from its
earliest forms. He knows that the entire period in which organic
life of any kind has existed on the planet is immeasurably trivial
when compared to the length of the life of -the planet itself as a
separate celestial body revolving around the sun from which it came,.
And he knows, finally, that the chances are almost infinite to one
against the world coming to a sudden .dramatic . smash during the
comparatively brief , period of a man's existence upon it.
The planets of the solar system, says common sense to the man
who is acquainted with the facts in the matter, have been acting
and reacting on each other and upon the sun for billions of years,
during which time they have evolved fiom molten masses into solid
or semi-solid forms, describing 'regular orbits around the sun, of
different but constant speeds and dimensions which bring them into
a series of juxtapositions which are constantly recurring without
perceptible change, for the size of the orbit Qf. and the speed with
which each planet moves through it, is for all practical purposes un
varying. Consequently the planets of the solar system have fre
quently before been in the same juxtaposition to each other and, the
sun and earth, as they were in yesterday, when this juxtaposition
was, according to Professor Porta, to so affect the action of the plan
ets on the sun, and, in turn, the action of the sun on the earth as
to throw this planet into chaos. Yet nothing untoward has ever re
sulted from this juxtaposition in tne past, and the rational supposi
tion is that nothing untoward is to occur on this occasion.
The rational thinker reflects on all this, and he knows that as
man has developed into his present complex form through thousands
of generations of battling with an adverse environment, while the
earth developed slowly into. a more and more habitable place for or
ganic life, so must the end of organic life on the planet come gradual
ly through more thousands of generations while the earth, finally
'completing the stages of its own enters its period of involution.
Bui the uncritical mind is sustained by no such comforting re
flection. It has neither command of the facts, nor the abstract rea
soning power to draw the right conclusions from the facts when in
formed of them. It is in the. terror which he strikes to the uncritical
mind that the culpability of Professor Porta lies. The pity is ttuft
there is no legal or moral process by which such appeals to super
stitious credulity con be muzzled, and that more "end of the world''
predictions are bound to come in the future, as they ha in the
past. Salvation from such bugaboos lies only in gradually increasing
rational intelligence of mankind in the mass.
THE COAL STRIKE'S HERITAGE
F
iIGUKES given out in Columbus, O., Tuesday, reveal that the re
cent coal strike cost the nation $126,000,000. The strikers hem-
selves, it is significant to note, were the greatest losers. The mine
operators lost $26,000,000, the railroads $40,000,000, and the loss to
the men in wages amounted to $60,000,000.
In addition to these figures, which are large enough to give the
average citizen food ior reflection in these days of high living .costs
and general money stringency, there are the intangible losses re
sulting from the coal Btrike in the suffering of miners' families
through lack of the necessities of life while their providers remained
idle, and the more general but less acute suffering of the nation at
large through lack of fuel during the cold winter weeks.
The national coal strike has cst the nation $126,000,000 in actual
money loss, with a far greater intangible loss. It has brought a num
ber of labor leaders into difficulties with the United States courts.
It has contributed in no small measure to the unfortunate influences
which are at. present disturbing the public peace of mind. The gain
from this strike must be tremendous to set up anything lige a bal
ance between debit and credit. Yet aside from a small wage increase
which will in the course of many long months bring coal miners back
to where they were fiuancially before they suffered their wage loss
while on strike, what has been gained?
At l-.i.st tho unsettled conditions in cur sister republic to the
soufh are Hearing an end. The Mexican women h ive started a deter
mined movement for equal suffrage.
If any one doubt that Arizona is the tamest growing stale in the
union, let him consider the slate banking records now being com
piled, which roveai that th" wealth of this state has increased 1400
per tent in thirteen years. No other statc'in the nation can show
such a record.
Lei us hope that it is lru that Villa has been captured bv his
own mm. Apparently there was no one cHe with nerve enough f
do the job.

NEWS NOTES
EWGLE POST
Preparations were completed yes
terday by the entertainment commit
tee of L. A. Engle, Jr.; Post of the
American Legion for the big smoker
and jollification meeting which will
be held in Maze Hall tomorrow even
ing, Friday, begining at 8 o'clock. It
is planned to make the affair the
greatest "getrtogether" lark in the
history of the local legion. With this
end in view, the committee has sev
eral surprises ia store to add to tho
general gaiety. Every one of the
more than 500 members of the local
post which is the largest post in
Arizona is asked to be there. It is
the aim of the committee to make
every man in the post informally ac
quainted with every other man, in
spite of the size of the local organiza
tion. Over their cigarettes and pipes
the boys will swap stories of their
experiences at the front and in train
ing camp. There will be both vocal
and instrumental music, various
"stunts", informal talks on the aims
and aspirations of the American Le
gion in general and Engle Post in
particular, and a feast of coffee and
hot dogs.
All service men who will not take
Christmas dinner at the family board
are urged to turn in their names at
once to Commander Dan" Angius of
L. A. Engle Post, so that reservations
may be made for them to take dinner
as the guests of the Bisbee lodge of
Elks ' on Christmas day. The local
Elks, whose brand of hospitality is
well and widely known, are arrang
ing an elaborate Yuletide repast to
which all service men in the district
who do not take dinner at home are
invited. . " '

Spectator "Yes indeed."

"Why, m-an alive, I w-asn't hissing

The members of the Legion band
held a practice with their new in
struments last evening, under the di
rection of Band Leader McRae. The
Legion is now holding two practices
a week, and is planning to give a con
cert to the public sometime early in
January. There are more than 40
pieces in the band.
Two successive nights of festivity
are in store for the local legion this
week. Following the smoker on Fri
day night, the regular weekly legion
dance will be held in Maze Hall Sat
urday night. Good music and a good
floor are features of these weekly
dances, . which have become among
the most popular of the winter social
activities in Bisbee."
MORALE WANING IN ASIA
Cleveland Yank morale in Siberia
is waning, is the report of Kenneth
D. Miller, Y. M. C. A. secretary, who
crossed northern Asia with the re
treating Czecho-Slovak army, to the
Presbyterian Union here.
"The morale of American troops in
Siberia is being impaired," he said.
"by the revolution-torn conditions of:
the country and the lack of purpose!
in their own expedition."
Mr. Miller went to Russia in 1917,
"to put morale into the Russian army"
and when revolt scattered the forces,
he joined the Czech army in Ukraine.
While in Siberia, recently, he had an!
opportunity to visit the American
troops and from conversation and ob
servation, he said he was able to dis
cern the waning of the soldiers' spirit.
CRUEL AND UNUSUAL.
An English regiment on its way to
India stopped at Aden, but noting
how arid the place looked few went
ashore. An officer observed an Irish
sergeant of his company leaning over
the ship's side, gazing intently at the
town.
"Well. Pat, and what do you think
of Aden?" the officer inquired..
"Well, sorr,' was the unexpected
answer, "what Adam an' Ave iver
saw in such a place bates me."

The Vandalia Leader puts this one up to the school of journalism:
An airplane passed over .Vandalia Monday morning about 10 o'clock

Hash is the most slandered of
dishes, due to carelessness on the
cook's part. It is Iruly economical in
that it is the most direct way to use
left-overs, it is quickly cooked sav

made.
All kinds of meat may be combined
in the same hash. Cooked or uncook
ed potatoes may be used. Most peo
ple like it moist.
Infinite care should be taken in
preparing the meat. If one bites down
on a piece of grissle. no matter how
perfectly tho hash is cooked that one
Is sure to have hard feelings toward
all hash, but that hash in particular.

have been called out to suppress the

have been inspired by Miss Ellen M.
Duffey, Hopkinton's most popular
school teacher.
Trouble began last June when Miss
Duffey advised the members of Ihe
graduating class that they should not
accept diplomas unless they were
properly signed by the school board.
As a result, the diplomas were re

graduating exercises. Mis Dully
was dismissed.

pound of brown sugar, one-quart pint
water, one-quart ounce of soda, one
half pounded of shredded almonds,

peel, cut fine, grated rinds of one
lemon.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONOS
NEW YORK, Dec. 17. Of the sev
eral developments which contributed
to the irregular strength of today's
stock market the most noteworthy
and important in its potential value
was the movement of British ex
change. Bills on London continued to rally.
The reviews of steel and iron indus
trial conditions were favorable, in
cluding higher price schedules for fab
ricated products.
Call loans were in freer supply at
7 per cent than at ann period, interior
banks offering round amounts at that
rate and later at 6 per cent. Time
money ruled firm, however, eager bids
of 8 per cent for two and three months
eliciting little response.
Shippings, tobacco, textiles, coppers'
and leathers helped to sustain the ad
vance with miscellaneous issues,- in
cluding chemical shares at extreme
gains of 1 to 5 points. The only divi
sion to hold back was the rails, which
moved within a very narrow radius,
hardening slightly at the firm close.
Sales 1,000,000 shares.
Moderate improvements in the year- '
end investment situation was reported
by banks and bond dealers. The open j
market on the exchange failed to re- j
fleet this condition, aside from a slight ,
rally in Liberty bonds and several of
the international issues. Total sales.

SENIORS TO MEET
Seniors of the high school will
meet tomorrow afternoon at 1:15
o'clock in the Presbyterian church to
carry out the program originally
planned for the final meeting of the
quarter. The newlj elected officers
will be installed, athietic letters
awarded and various school reports
submitted. The quarterly report
cards will be distributed.
Insurance adjustment ,on the Bis
bee High school, destroyed by . fire
early Tuesday morning, will be made
within the next few days, represent
atives of the insurance companies be
ing expected here today to begin in
spection of the ruins and to determ
ine the extent ot the loss.
Whether or not the walls of the
structure may be used In the recons
truction of the High school is not
known, no lnvestiagtion of the dam
age to them have been anyje.
This afternoon the board of school
trustees will meet to take up matters
concerning the reconstruction of th.e
High school, the insurance and the
accomodation of the High school stud
ents until a new building is com
pleted. Lodges, churches and various ' or
ganizations in Bisbee have offered
their. halls and rooms to the school
board for use as class rooms, but it
is believed larger quarters than any
of these places offer must be sought
because of the number of High school
students. Several buildings for a tem
porary High school are under con
sideration. ' Among them are the old
Calumet and Arizona hospital, the
army barracks and the junior high
school on Quality hill. If the latter
is used the students of both the junior
and senior grades will not be able to
get the full day in class. If the hos
pital is used it will be necessary to
tear out petitions in several of the
smaller rooms but the -wards are
large enough to accomodate the aver
age class. Should the barracks be
chosen partitions would have to be
built to separate the various classes
and a heating system Installed.
As soon as the Insurance adjust
ment is made Architect Norman F,
aMrch of oLs Angeles, won designed
the burned school and also the $40,
000 addition which was to have been
made to it, will be called upon to
draw up a design for deconstructiou
of the building.
i ne origin or tne fire has not been i
determined but it is believed the in
surancecompa ny representatives will
render an opinion as to its cause.
