ISDN'S CABINET DEADLOCKED
IN EFFORT TO SOLVE EQUITABLE
lb
E SCALE AGREEMENT WITHOUT
PLACING BUREODN THE PUBLIC
Fuel Administrator Garfield Will Attend Meeting Today
. arid Give Views on Situation, Endeavoring to Bring
the Members Together on a Definite Wage Scale;
Carter Glass Promises to Present "Some
Startling Figures He Has Compiled"
WASHNGTOX, Nov. 25. Like the
miners and operators, whose trou
bles it was tryintf to adjust, Presi
dent Wilson's cabinet tonic.ht
seemed hopelessly deadlocked on the
question of a wage increase in the
bituminous coal Industry.
After a six hour pesiton, the cabi
net, which took up the wago scale
agreement, where operators and min
ers left off last week, adjourned un
til tomorrow, when another attempt,
with the aid of Fuel Administrator
Gai field, will be made to agree upon
a pay scale that will satisfy the mine
workers and owners and the people
in all sections ofthe country who
are clamoring for normal production
of coal.
Secretary Glass said tcnlshr that
he might have "some very Interest
ing figures tomorrow," emphasizing
that they had been compiled for the
public and not for the cabinet. He
declined to say whether they were
the income tax retui-ts received by
the treasury department or excess
profits from the coal industry.
Significance was attached to this
announcement in view of the fact
that the amount of profit made by
the coal companies during the last.
HEATED DEBATE ENSUES DURING
SESSION OF NEW LABOR PARTY;
NO POSITIVE STAND IS TAKEN
CHCAGO. Nov. 25. After several
hours of heated debate, the labor
party of the United State? today, re
frained from taking a positi;r3 stand
on the piohibition question, but as a
compromise measure adopted a reso
lution providing for the appointment
of a special committee of three to
investigate the effect of the prohi
bition constitutional amendment law
and report at the next national con
vention of the party.
The delegates appeared to be about
evenly divided on the prohibition
question.
Representatives from trades unions
from cities wanted the convention to
go on record against the "dry" law,
while the party leaders and delegates
from farmers' and co-operative or
ganizations were anxious to have
the body make no declaration on the
question.

WASHINGTON, Nov. 25. The new
flare-up over the Mexican problem,
growing out of the Jenkins case,
was given serious conslderataion at
at a meeting of the president's cab
inet, There was no intiniataion as
to what this g.overnment might do
in event President Carranza refuses
to answer th note from the state
department demanding immediate re
lease of William O.. Jenkins, consular
agent at Puebla, held on a charge
of conniving with bandits who kid
naped and held him lor a $150,000
ransom.
No attempt was made to conceal
the feeling that ihe situation Yfas
.serious and that relations between
the United States and Mexico were
strained. Officials said the three
departments, state, war and navy,
were ready to meet any eventuality
and dt-Rl with any situation arising
out of more defiant attitude by
the Carranza administrataion toward
the United States.

which the opfrators might be asked
to bsarfl have been the mo bitterly
disuted points in the controversy.
The statements of former Secre
tary o fthe Treasury McAdoo, charg
ing that some of the real concerns
made enormous profits during his in
cumbency came - in for discussion at
the cabinet meeting, it wes. learned,
bat no one would say what form the
discussion took. ,
Before the meeting Attorney Cen
eral Palmer said that if th figures
given yesterday by Mr. McAdoo were
correct, it was cot likely Dr. Garfield
would permit an increased price for
coal.
n a statement bearing on this issue
the operators said:
"That conditions in 1917 were ab
normal." but that is Mr. McAdoo was
"ignorant" of conditions in 191S and
1919, his message "carries no weight
and requires no answer." The opera
tors said they welcomed an investi
gation of current tax returns and
that they had been urging a board
of arbitration or a tribunal of in
vestigation but. that the miners re
fused to agree to it.
mitted a report stating that because
of the difference of opinion it was
deemed best to make no direct dec
laration on prohibition but to ask
congress to submit it to a referen
dum vote of the people. '
Rev. Ellis d&rr of Chicago, who
led the dry faction, moved that the
committee's recommendation be ta
bled after he had expressed the opin
ion that if prohibition had caused
the revolution In Russia.it might
bring about a similar result in this
country. Joseph Broestle of Cincin
nati, representing the International
Brewery Workers, pleaded with the
convention to adopt a resolution con
demning prohibition.
"This is no Sunday school conven
tion, it is a gathering of working
men," he said. "The toilers want to
drink a glass of beer when their day's
work is over and they should be per
mitted to do it."

OUT OF
NOTE
the embassy at Mexico City, offi
cials were not inclined to put much
faith in reports ' coming by way of
Laredo, Texas, that the release of
Jenkins was momentarily expected."
There was no word to the depart
ment from the Mexican embassy
here, and while nobody seemed to
know what the next day might bring
forth, officials said . they would not
be surprised to hear that Jenkins
actually had been released.
Meanwhile the government has
checked up on the official-and pri
vate record of Jenkins and has given
him a high-class rating.
The latest report from the Ameri
can embassy showed that Jenkins
was still in the penitentiary and ill
and that bail had been refused him.
In looking into the varies features
of the consular agent's predicament,
officials pointed out today that un
der the Mexican constitution, state
courts had no Jurisdiction over cases
involving diplomatic or consular
officers. such jurisdiction being
lodged specifically in the federal
court.

Radicals at Ellis
Island Refuse
To Eat
NEW YORK, Nov. 25
A hunger strike was coupl
ed with a "silence" strike
today by 73 radicals at Ellis
island in an effort to have
removed an iron barrier
separating them from visit
ing relatives' and friends.
The barrier was erected
after discovery that several
Reds planned to escape by
exchanging clothes with
friends, and after some vis
itors had passed revolvers
to the radicals. In a letter
to the house' immigration
committee, which is in New
York investigating the im
migration and deportation
system, they reiterated that
they would not attend de
portation hearings held by
immigration inspectors, and
would go on a hunger
strike in addition. Three
summons to the dining
rooms were unanswered.
Drinking water and oratory
had been their only diet to
night for 24 hours.
About a half dozen vol
untarily attended hearings,
but refused to answer ques
tions. Byron H. Uhl, acting
commissioner at the island,
asked the advice of the
local United States district
attorney as to whether the
hearings could behejd with
out the presence of the rad
icals.' He thought mem
bers of the house corrynit
tee had been incorrect in
announcing that a supreme
court decision required their
presence.
NATION FACES
SILL OUTPUT
Only 40 Per Cent of Pre
Strike Supply Being Mined
Daily; Limit Soon Will
Be Placed on Delivery
WASHINGTON, Nov. 25 With less
than forty per cent of the normal
output of bituminous coal being pro
duced, the nation is facing its most
serious - period since the strike of
soft coal miners was ordered, ac
cording to reports received today by
the railroad administration. In
scores of cities the number of in
dustries in operation is rapidly fall
ing, while the nation's coal bin con
tinues to diminish.
Officials held out only a ray of
hope for increased production. While
last week's production showed an in
crease over the previous week, and
Indications were for a production of
about fifty per cent of normal this
week, officials said they could not
expect sufficient production to check
the drain on the national supply un
til all differences1 between the min
ers and operataors are ironed out
by the conference here.
Meanwhile, temperatures in the
northern half of the nation have
dropped and the cry for coal for
household purposes grows louder. So
ff.r, the supplies have been dealt out
rather liberally to meet this demand,
it was said, but further releases of
coal must be limited if the nation is
not to face a serious tieup of in
dustry as well ns transportation, be
fore normal production is again
reached.

Felipe Angeles and his two compan

soldier Antonio Trillo, captured near
Parral, Chihuahua, November 15, by.
Major Gabino Sandivola, were found
guilty by court martial at Chihuahua
City this morning and sentenced to be
shot at noon today, according to in
formation received by Judge Gonzales
Medina of the Mexican federal court
here this afternoon.
The sentence was not carried out,
it was said here, because the attorneys
for Angeles appealed to the federal
court at Juarez and the supreme court
of Mexico at Mexico City for a stay
of execution by applying for a writ of
habeas corpus.
The Juarez court denied the appeal,
Judge Medina holding his court had no
jurisdiction and the supreme court
was the only tribunal which could act.
i Besides the supreme court President
Carrana also could save the condemn
ed man, with a pardon.
It was said by ccjirt officials that if
the supreme court grants the applica
tion it simply means that court will
only review the proceeding of the
court martial and if no errors are
found it will mean carrying out of the
sentence unless Carranza Intervenes.
Carrana already has many petitions
seeking clemency for General Angeles.
He once saved General Obregon's life,
it is said.

Propaganda
NEW YORK, Nov. 25
Ninety thousand dollars ha3
been paid by the Russian
soviet government to Lud
wig C A. K. Martens, self
styled ambassador to the
United States,, to be used
in carrying on propagandas
in the United States, and
other expenses, Martens to
day told the legislative com
mittee investigating radi
cal propaganda. He also
testified that he had paid
Dudley Field Malone, for
mer collector of the port of
New York,- $1,000.00, for
"help in a commercial
transaction" for advice, in
trying to arrange a $9,500,
000 shipment of boots,
meats and chemicals. The
shipment was to be paid
upon delivery in Petrograd.
Martens denied he knew
that Malone had formed or
was forming a "corporation
to do business with soviet
Russia," and declared that
his "embassy" was not spe
cifically interested in such
an ' organization. He did
not know that Malone "had
been speaking in behalf of
the, soviet government of
Russia," either before or
after he paid him $1,000,
he said, and denied that he
and Malone had spoken
from the same platform in
Madison Square Garden

Malone was not regular

plans to buy and ship to
Russia $5,000,000 worth
of boots, and $4,500,000

Auditor Jesse L. Boyce this afternoon
disbursed to all counties ecept Yuma
a total of $113,152.97 and in addition
paid out $57,775.80 of special school
money to be divided among all coun

The money represents one-fourth of

forms of forest reserve income, one
fourth of the whole income reverting
to the state and one-ofourth of the re
ceipts from school sections within the
reserve recerting to the state schools.
Yuma has no forest renerve, but as
the school money goes direct to the

and financial world.
Among the numerous matters or
great Importance to the mining in
dustry that caem u pat the St. Louis
meeting was the matter of protec
tion of mines against unjust taxa
tion by the federal and state govern
ments, of .which the principal issues
brought out by Mr. McGrath, in an
address before the convention on the
matter of federal taxation were:
First. That the state and federal
government define a proven mine or
"discovery of .a mine" as the discov
ery of commercial minerals, Whether
mined or in place, of a total net
value in excess of the total amount
of the investment in mining claims,
development expense and equipment.
'Second. That the state and federal
government decide upon a definite I
method of determining the nQt value
of the ore discovered, as well as defi-j
nite methods of . ascertaining the
present worth or market value of a
mine as of a certain date.
bird. That the treasury depart
ment's regulations define income
from mines subject to the income tax
as income frctn proven mines only.
Fourth. That the treasury depart
ment's regulations define income
from mines subject to excess profit
taxes as that amount of each year's
income that is left after the average
investment in the business has
earned 8 per cent per annum for
each year of the investment; 1. e., the
yearly income from mining opera

Buffalo, Detroit, Pittsburg and St.

of an amount necessary to give an
earning of 8 pel- cent per annum of
the average investment to date.
Fifth. That to talte care or the ex
tra hazards and risks involved in
bringing the mine to the proven
stage, as well as the same risks and
hazards that must continually le
taken in order to insure the continu
ation of the business, due to the Tact
that mining is a wasting industry,
there should be granted either a

These matters, together with ttiei
points; on federal taxation, will b

by Stnator Macbetluof daho in per
son. Matters of vital importance to
mines in other states and to the Ari
zona mines, especially as to state
taxation, were also brought before
the convention by Mr. McGrath.. as
follows:
Sixth. That for the purpose of
state and county taxes there should
be a uniform grouping of mines of
each state, as follows:
; (a) Non-productive and non-in-
(b) Producing and income earning
properties.
And to divide each of these groups
into sufficient classes to enabl the
placing of a fair valuation on each
class
Seventh. That for the purpose of
state and county taxation a nominal
assessed value per acre of all non

mines, and a fair valuation of pro
ductive and Income earning mines,

not less than a rate obtained by di

is a mystery to all.
The fire was discovered by Luke

but they at once saw the utter im
possibility to check the flames.
Shortly after the fire was discovered
the floor fell in and the blaze at
once spread to all the. upper floors
and in a few minutes the flames be
gan eating their "way through the
floors to the rooms below. It was
all over in about an hour, and then
the flames had completed their work,
leaving nothing but . a pile of glow

had once held one of the best schools
in the southwest.
The loss is estimated at $50,000,

U. S. WLL PROSECUTE
PROFTEERS IN GLOBE
GLOrE, Nov. 25. E. B.' Sisk, of
the department of justice, has re
turned to this city from , Tucson,
where he attended a conference ' of
federal agents regarding the prose
cution of profiteers. United States
Attorney Flynq presided' at the meet
ing and some interesting develop
ments will probably result from the
conference. . ,
The department of justice has
taken full charge of the food control
r.nd fair price boards in the various
states and the federal agents have
been given full power to act.
Heretofore the power of the fair
price board has been limited, but.the
action of congress, as passed by the
resolution of October 28, 1919, gives
the department of justice unlimited
powers and proviJes a penalty for
violation of its edicts.
Mr. Sisk has not announced any
definite nlaas to be followed out by
the fair price board, and until suchj
time as his agents hae made a com
plete investigation of local 'condi
tions no action will be taken towards
prosecutin galleged profiteers.
The fair price board will have jur
is diction over the selling price of
shoes and,,wearing apparel as well
as the necessities of life. A fair
margin of profit will be allowed on
all sales, the margin of profits to be
set by the federal agents.
Officer Sisk will appoint his sub
ordinates immediately and an inves
tigation of local conditions will be
:nade with a view to ascertaining the
margin of profit maile by local mer
chants. "

This picture was taken before Quentin was born. Kermit is the baby,
(On his return from the war, the
youngest children hardly recognized
their father... A visitor asked, "Is your
lather at home?" "1 dont' know," said
a youthful Roosevelt, "but the colonel
is taking a bath... Fresh from war hon
ors, he was elected governor of Nef
York.- The Old Guard didn't like his
tactics. He showed no mercy to spoils
man., and., grafter... Therefore it was
"framed" that he should be sidetrack
ed politically by being nominated for
the vice presidency.' Governor Roose
velt said that he would not be made
the goat in any such plot. But mean
while his national popularity, growing
rapidly Into full bloom, forced the Is
sue and he was elected, with McKin
ley In 1900. Through his betters to his
children it will be seen that Roose
velt took care not to refer to the high
honors bestowed upon him... He was
always careful to keep them, from
false pride.
Prior to his inauguration as vice pres
ident, Roosevelt went into the west he
loved and, with the zest of a boy, hunt
ed big game. He killed a cougar with
a knife Ted had loaned him.)
A Cougar and Lynx Hunt
" T Keystone Ranch, Colo.,
January 14, 1901. .
BLESSED TED;
From the' railroad-we drove fifty
friiles to the little frontier town of
Meeker. There we were 'met by the
hunter Goff, a fine, quiet, hardy fel
low, who knows his hustness thor
oughly. Next morning we started on
horseback, while our luggage went by
wagon to Gofrs ranch. We started
soon after sunrise, and made our way,
hunting as we went, across the high
exceedingly rugged hills, until sunset.
We were hunting cougar and lynx, or.
as they called out here, "lion" and
Vat." The first cat we put up gave
the does a two hours chase, and got
away among some high cliffs. T nfhe
afternoon we put up another, and had
a very pood hour's run, the does bav
in until the elens rantr aealn to th
echoes, . as they worked hither and !
thither through the ravines. We walk
ed our ponies up and down steep, rock
strewn, and tree-clad slopes, where it
did not seem possible a horse could
climb and on the level place we got
one or two smart gallops. 'At last the
lynx went up a tree Then I saw a
really funny sight. Seven hounds had
been doing the trailing, wlille a large
brindled bloodhound and two half
breeds between collie and bull stayed
behind Goff, running so close to his
into them, which he accepted
bumped into them, which he accepted
with philosophic composure. Then
the dogs proceeded literally to climb
the tree, which was a many-forked
pinion; one of the half-breeds, named
Tony, got up certainly 16 feet, until
the lynx, which looked like a huge
and exceedingly malevolent pussy-cat,
made vicious dabe at him. I shot
the lynx low so as not to hurt his skin.
Yesterday we were in the saddle for
ten hours. The dogs ran one lynx
down and killed it among the rocks
after a vigirous scuffle. It was in a
hole and onlytwo of them could get
at it.
This morning, soon after starting
out, we struck the cold trail of a
mountain lion. The hounds puzzled
about for nearly two hours, going up
arc! '.'c-.v.i the great gorges, cniil we
sometimes absolutely lost even the
sound of the baying. Then they struck
the fresh trail, where the cougar had
killed a deer over night. In half an
hour a clamorus yelling told us they
had overtaken the quarry; for we had
been riding up the slopes and along
the crests, wherever it was possble
for the horses to get footing. As we
plunged and scrambled down towards
the noise, one of my companions,
Phil Stewart, stopped us while he
took a kodak of a rabbit which sat un
concernedly right beside our path.
Soon we saw the lion in a treetop,
with two of the dogs so high up among
the branches that he was striking at
them. lie was more afraid of us than
of the dogs, and as soon as he saw
us he took a great flying leap and was
off. the pack close behind. In a few
hundred yards they had him up an
other tree. Here I could have shot
him (Tony climbed almost up to him
and then fell 20 feet out of the tree),
but waited for Stewart to get a phoo:
and he jumped again. This time, after
a counle of hundred yards, the does
caught him. and a great flfht follow
ed. They could have killed him bv
themselves, but he bit or clnwe1 four
of them, and for fear h misrht kill orie
T ran In and ptahhod Mm behind the
shoulder, thrnstin? the knife yo"
loaned rr" rieht Into TiN hparf. T
have always wished to kil la cougar as
I did this one, with dogs and the kn'fe.
Dogs That Climb Trees
Kenstone Ranch, Jan. 18, 1901.
DARLING LITTLE ETHEL:
I have had great fun. Most of the
trip neither you nor mother nor sister
would enjoy; but you could all of you
be immensely amused with the dogs.
There are eleven all told, but really
only eight do very much hunting.
These eight are all scarred with the
wounds they have received this very
week in battling with the cougars and
lynxes, and they are always threaten
ing to fight one another; but they are
as affectionate'toward men (and espe
cially toward me, as I pet them) as
our own home dogs. At this moment
a large hound and a small half-breed
bull dog, both of whom were quite
badly wounded this morning by a cou
gar, areshoving their noses into my
lap to be petted, and humming defi
ance to one efhother. They are on ex
cellent terms with the ranch cat and
kittens. The three chief fighting dogs
who do not" follow the trail are the
most affectionate of all, and more
over, they climb trees! Yesterday we
got a big lynx in the top of a demon
tree a low, spreading kind of pine
about 30 feet tall. Turk, the blood
hound, followed him up, and after
much sprawling got to the very top,
Within a couple of feet of hira. Then,
when the lynx was shot out Lof the
tree, Turk, after a short scramble,
too 'a header down througn tne
branches, landing with a bounce on
his back. Tony, one of the half breed
bulldogs, takes such headers on an
I average at least once for every animal
we put up a tree. We have nice little
horses which climb the most extraor
dinary places you can imagine. Get
mother to show some of Gustave
Dore's trees; the trees on these moun
tains look just, like them.
The Pip Named Maud
Keystone Ranch, Jan. 29, 1901.
DARLING LITTLE ETHEL:
You would be much amused with
the animals round the ranch. The
most thorough independent and self
possessed of them is a large white
pig which we christened Maude. She
goes everywhere at her own will; she
picks up scraps from the dogs, who
bav dismallv at her. hut know they
l have no right to. kill her; and then
she eats the green alfalfa hay from
the two milch cows who live In the
biff corral with the horses. One of the
dogs has lust had a litter of pupnles:
vou would love them wilh their little
wrinkled noses and snueakv voices.

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"Whatever makes men good Christians, makes them good citi
zens." . Daniel Webster.
UNITED FRONT AGAINST THE FOE WITHIN
FRAUGHT with far-reaching consequences and with inestimable
potentiality tor stimulating good citizenship and helping put
an end to the present period of unrest, is the organization in
Bisbee ot a branch of the "United Americans," a permanent
committee for which was named at a meeting of representative citi
zens Monday. It is to be hoped that this organization will in a short
while have on its membership rolls every lcyal American citizen in
the Warren District.
The "United Americans" is the expressive name of a patriotic
society which is now being formed throughout the nation to combat
radicalism and to give to non-service men and women the same op
portunity to further the cause of true Americanism as that of which
the ex-service men, through the American Legion, are now making
such good use.
In an address before the Bisbee citizens at the meeting Monday,
Frederick Vining Fisher, noted author, lecturer and scholar, declared
that Americans will not tolerate government by radicals, by religious
bodies, by labor unions, or by- any cne set of men, but will demand
"government by all the people."
In this statement lies the crux of the entire situation. A Tact
which the .radicals, Bolshevists, I. W. W. and other forms of social
soot seem uniformly and consistently to overlook is that what they
arc advocating is rule by the minority, whereas the so-called "free
dom" of the working men, behind which they mask their gospel ot
destruction, is dependent for its wry existence on the fact that the
American government is founded on majority rule.
Rule by sectarianism, by labor union, by I. W. W., or by any other
body of men banded together for a single purpose, whether that pur
pose be good or evil, is minority rule, unless such organization be
formed of more than a majority of the entire population of the
United States.' And what organization in America (unless it be one
of the twu great political parties, who preserve a sane governmental
balance by switching majorities every so often) can boast such a
membership?
"The United Americans" is an organization which seeks to found
itself on majority rule. It fs to look beyond the labor union minority,
for instance, by including in its membership both those who belong
to" labor unions and those who do not. It will be made up of that
vast majority of the American people who have no axe to grind be
yond the right of bettering social conditions in decent, orderly fasn
ion under a constitution offering them perfect machinery for such
betterment. Working in co-operation with the American Liegion this .
latter organization comprisinglhe big .majority of the nation's mor-.
ally, mentally and physically healthy young manhood the "United
Americans" is the final thing needed by patriotic America to -present
an -unbroken front to the foe within the gate.
BISBEE A CENTER OF CULTURE
ONK wonders what Rudolph Ganz, one of the world's leading
pianists, reared and trained in an atmosphere of culture, and
moving, in his professional career, from one center of culture
to another on both sides of the Atlantic, thought when he was
booked to play in an "Arizona mining camp," and what he expected
to see when he arrived in this city. . Visions of an orchestra circle
filled with miners of rugged mein and rugged garb, or of cowboys
with "chaps" and five-gallon hats perhaps passed through his mind.
He might even have had some uncertainty as to whether such classics
as "turkey in the straw" would not be better suited to his audience
than his accustomed musical repertoire.
What Mr. Ganz found, when he alighted from his train, was that
he was taken to a hotel second to none in the Southwest, and regaled
with a cuisine which would grace the board of any metropolitan hotel
on the Pacific Coast. He found gathered to receive him in the Opera
House an audience as cultured, as erudite in matters musical, and
as appreciative as any which . greeted him in California, or in the
.cities of the East. He found a theatre filled with Bisbee men and
women who rollowed his mastery of his art with an aintelligence
which must have been gratifying even to the man accustomed to the
plaudits of the world's leading music critics in the world's leading
centers of music.
Bisbee is still a "mining camp" is still one of earth's greatest
underground treasure houses. But it is also a city of culture a city
Which in this respect need yield the palm to no other in the nation,
on a per capital basis. Belief that a mining city cannot have as high
a standard of aesthetic intelligence as any other kind of city is a
rapidly dissolving canard.
The Musical Events Club and the Bisbee women who comprise
its membership are to be congratulated on the success of the opening
program of their winter season of music. As the weeks go by and
others, of the gala-y of first-rank musical geniuses appear in this
city under their auspices, the women of the Musical Events Club
will deserve more and more the thanks of the entire district in
gaining for Bisbee a true appreciation abroad of the posh ion to whicn
this city is entitled in the cultural world.
THE STATE UNFAIR
EARLY every cne coming back from the state fair were well
III pleased with the fair, but when hotels and eating houses were
11 mentioned, they became exceedingly torrid and words were
mentioned t hat should not even be thought of within two miles
of a meet in' house. They seemed to have a "plus system in hotels
the minimum price was $H per night; if thero were more than six
in a room they added a dollar each per each.- If they found that
people were sitting up all night, they added that to their "guests"
the following day. As for eating, why a person could get a cracker
and a glass of water most any place for a couple of dollars. The
railroad accommodations were equally as good. A person could pay
his railroad fare a inor.tli in advance, walk part way and catch a
ride in a Ford the rest of the way.
The next session of the legislature should abolish the state fair
and let it stay abolished until the people of Phoenix give the people

JOBS AND POSITIONS
There was a jnan who had two sons,
And one he educated
To make him stand among the ones
In life niont compensated.
Said he: "You'll hold, above the mob,
A good position, not a job."
The other lad showed promise small.
And so the angered father
Upon his fav'rite lavished all
His cash, advice and bother.
Poor son the second had to turn
To shoveling, his bread to earn.
One holds a proud position now,
A humble job the other,
Who sighs: "I am so far below.
Who'd guess he is my brother
That I, a poor professor, sir,
Am brother to a laborer?"

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Nov. 25. Up very late, having stopped on the way home last night for
some waffles and things, which lay heavy on my stomach, but feeling good
when I arose, although my wife in a terrible pother about Thanksgiving
nd what we shall have to go with the turkey, the lack of sugar putting
cranberry sauce almost out cf the question, but when I told her that she
should rather worry about having a turkey to go with the sweet potatoes
.he calmed down a little. A very pleasant conversation last evening with
Mrs. Cundiff and her sister, who are lovers of music and the fourth estate,
gnd we chatted about Schumann-Heink, and the Paulist choir, and the
paste pot that makes the newspaper office a joy forever, so that I felt quite
icfreshed after they had left, Mrs. Cundiff having written a musical review
for the paper, which read beautifully, although too deep for me in spots. To
Mr. Curry, of the American Mining congress, who told me about the last
meeting and promised me some news about it, so that I thought the day
began fairly, seeing that the sun was also shining. My wife tells me the
lawn mower is becoming rusty, and she did advise me to sell it, but I do not
think I could make any profit after sending it 100 miles to the purchaser,
and I am content to wait until the summer time and see if I cannot make
a lawn and perhaps turn the laugh on my friends, although I still think that
the click of a lawn mower in Bisbee will be as strange a' sound as the tinkle
of ice in a highball glass in Hades. To the bazaar at St. Patrick's hall,
where I found it exceeding nice, and so I spent some money, and glad that
my wife was not with me, or she would have spent it all and me none, and
I could not have danced. To the office, where I worked rapidly ,and then
to bed, worrying about getting up early, as I have a most interesting trip
tomorrow with Mr. Massey, the mining inspector, so that I will have a
chance to write a regular story.
WE'LL SAY HE DOES
Anent an alleged man who wrote to the Chicago Tribune that liquor
iiad never touched his lips, and then boasted about it, leads Jack Lait to
say: "The he-gazelle who wrote to the Friend of the people that liquor never
touched his lips must be a comfort around the house when there's funcy
"mending to be done. We'll bet he's on some, woman's nerves""
BEAT HIM TO IT '
Mr. Gotcoin: "Now, Willie, when
your sister comes down and is com
fortably seated on the coach with me,
I want you to tiptoe in softly and turn
the gas low, will you?"
Willie: "You're tqo late. Sister told
me to come in and turn it out."
ONLY WINGS
"How do you know it was a stork
and not a stranger thai brought your
little brother?"
" 'Cause I heard pa complain about
the size of the bill, and I guesa angels
don't have bills."
A WARNING ,
. Pause, gentle reader! Pass not by, .
As thou art now, so once was I,
Sneer not at this, my rythmic text,
Doggone you, you'll be rhyming n.'ext!

Bisbee kitchens will not have a luscious and tempting odor clinging to
them about noon tomorrow. .
The U. S. state department is to continue its eight years' sleep alongside
the Mexican question.

While the world is stiil bleeding

enemy at home which annually
claims many more victims than war.
and which, unlike Germany, has not
been rendered impotent tuberculosis.
Every three minutes this scourge
claims one life in the United States.
Every year it lowers" national ef
ficiency by depriving the nation of
the services of hundreds of thou

Tuberculosis is preventable by
proper living. Taken in time, it is
curable. It is largely the ignorant
and careless who suffer, because
they are not aware that they are
victims until it ' Is too late, or if
aware, depend on patent medicines

FRENCH EXPRESSIONS IN
HOLIDAY COOKING.
As the holidays draw near most
housekeepers are more interested in
unusual and s;omewhat elaborate
dishes. As French words and phrases
are often used in recipes und menus,
the following list may he helpful to
those who have grown rusty since
their college French, or are unfa
miliar with the language. A la, and
its contractions au and aux, means
with, dressed in a certain style; as,
potatoes au gratin potatoes with
browned crumbs. Bisque means a
thick soup, also an ice cream to
which is added finely chopped nuts.
To blanch is to whiten. To do it we
scald vegetables or nuts lo remove
the skins. As in blanching almonds,
we scald the nuts and slip off the
tough skin. Compotes are. fruits
stewed in sirup and kept in original
shape. Frappe means semi-frozen.
Marions are chestnuts. A merinque
is a frosting made of the whites of
eggs whipped very stiff with pow
dered sugar and browned in a me
dium oven. A mouse is an ice cream
made with whipped cream and fro
en without stirring. And so on ad
iutiuil urn.

Don't let the milk bottle stand
about, off the ice.
Don't fail to keep the baby's food,
when prepared, on the ice.
Don't Tail to feed baby at regular
periods, day and night.
Don't let the baby use a "pacifier".
Constant sucking of a dummy teat
causes deformities and interferes

Don't permit flies to bother baby
when sleeping: use a net.
Don't fail to screen in the win
dows, particularly in the nursery,
against flies and insects.
Don't forget that babies nursed by
their mother's milk, and given plen
ty of fresh air, have three times the
advantage over others in escaping
diarrhoea, pneumonia, and children's
infections.
Don't expect a quiet, composed,
healthy baby unless you do your part
thoroughly and constantly.

The Prince of Wales Shakes Hand
JLL Bellfonta
By SERGT. CHAES. W. O'CONNOR
(Ward 65, Walter Reed Hospital)
WASHINGTON.. Nov. 22. He was
a boyish, attractive figure, in his
trim uniform, atop the steps of the
big hospital, hands clasped behind
him, red band cap at a jounty tilt.
"Comrades In arms, I'm having a
very good time in the United States,
and I hope you will be out of the
hospital soon and having a good
time, too."
Just a simple little speech it was,
earnest, clearly spoken. It struck
the hearts of the broad circle of
boys in olive drab looking up from
the foot of the steps. They grinned.
And the boy on the steps grinned,
flushed. ;
Just Boys Together During This Visit
Atsa stuff, came a rear-rank.
chorus. Then the slim, youthful
speaker saluted smartly, twirled his
cane, ran down to a big auto and
was whirled away, red cap, smile
and all.
He was the Prince of Wales, heir
to the throne of Britain and the
other boys were wounded Americans
at Walter Reed hospital, Washing
ton. Boys together they, wero for that
moment when the prince addressed
them at the great army hospital.
Here was a youth for whom life
is moving, full of color, sparkling
with activity, brought for an instant I
into the quiet routine day of the
"war holdovers." He won for him
self only admiration. No envy in
that unanimous grin of the Yanks,
just regular old fashioned "boy lan
guage" of understanding.
"Nothing Wrong With That Buddy"
"Some duds he's got," said one
doughboy, taking in the royal vis
itor's layout. Then there frank, out
spoken Americans, whose eyes were
made keen in judgment over there
under bursting shells, chimed in:
"Well, nothing wrong with that
buddy.".
"He's a good looking kid, at that."

"He's just human, like the rest of

All this, of course, in good natur

Military etiquet forbade vocal demon
strations. The prince shook hands with Her
bert Hahn of Bellefontaine, O., who
lost a leg and an arm at Chateau
Thierry, and a dozen other patients
who held the place of honor in their
wheel chairs.
He scribbled his signature in three
or four, notebooks, then visited hos

No Show of Rank Despite Insignia.
During the war, Albert Edward,
whose string of titles it wondrous

ish army. His uniform is covered
with shining insignia. But in the
presence of the men who know the
long, hard aftermath of war, who
still live in the reality of whirring
bullets, there was not show of :ank
about him.
"I am happy to see. you. I wish
you luck. Hope you're well soon,"
was what he told the ward patients.
Outside, the big crowd of hun
dreds of wound soldiers, nurses in
their spotless white, pretty aides in
"bluebird" garb, officers and men of

charge of violating the city ordi

the city of Bisbee, was found guilty
yesterday by Judge Hogan, who will
pronounce sentence this morning.
Meyers is quoted as having said
in the witness stand that he is an
Austrian, 21 years of age, and that
he has never taken any- ateps to
wards gaining American citizenship,
although he has been in thiB coun
try since he was one year old. Wh?n
he was about to be given the usual
oath before testifying, he refused it,
bat said that he would "affirm" the
truth of his declarations. His testi
mony was very contradictory.
In addition to various pieces of I.
W. W. literature which were found
upon his person at the time Of his
arrest, he carried several appeals to
atheists. When asked if he believed
the I. W. W. and irreligious doc
trines which be was carrying with
him, he replied, according to the po
lice, that ."if be did not beleye them
he would not carry' them" :;. r

BOXING CARNIVAL
I
. 'i
In presenting the boxing program
for Dec. 11, which is going to include
such hard hitters as "Happy" Woods
of Tucson, Johnnie Meyers and Bob
Collins and Curly Kirkland of Bisbee
O. S. French, manager of the Bisbee
Athletic club, declared yesterday
that he is offering to the fistic fans
of the Warren district a "knockout
card," with reference to the fact that
he is looking for decisive endings to
every bout. t . .
"Happy" Woods and Meyer, who
appear in the main event, are, both
known as sluggers. Meyer has shown
his ability to get them over with a
slam several times, while Woods is
declared to be one of the hardest
hitters of his weight now in the ring.
For several months he has ended all
his fights with a sleep-producer, and
the wise ones are saying that Meyer
will need all his cleverness and cool
ness to keep away from the Woods
haymakers when they come over. At
the same time, Meyer is confident
that he can put Woods away, and
that his position as a main event
Tighter will be secure after he has
demonstrated his superiority over
the Tucson terror.
Bob Collins is of the same cless as
Meyer and Woods. His last two
fights in Bisbee were won by the
knockout route, and this in short
time in both instances. His wallop
is getting better every day, according
to those who have been training with
him, and he is also bettering his bod
ing and defensive work. He ib going
to meet, however, a man worthy; of
the best he' has, and there is a
shrewd suspicion going the rounds
that in "Curly" Kirkland he is liable
to find his Waterloo. Kirkland has
had a wealth of experience; he is an
acknowledged hitter, and he will
weigh as much, or probably a pound
or two more than Collins. He has
offered - to fight the Briggs shaft
champion for all of the purse and a
side bet. and his friends at Sacra
mento hill are beginning to talk "real
money whenever the subject of wag
ers comes up. ' :-
Al Mauch, who meets Kid Johnsoa
of Arkansas, is another hitter. John-
eon is a stranger In fistic circles
here, but he looks good. He Is well
built, evfdenCly in good condition,
and talks as If he knew the game
from A to Izzard. The curtain raiser
will present Battling Herrera, .the
hard-hitting chap that swung a wick
ed left in his fight here on Not. 21,
and whose good showing against
Cyclone Shea won him many friends.

at times I could hardly get about,
and at night I was restless and my
sleep was broken. I had very little
appetite, and I went down hill so fast
that I lost fifteen pounds and got so
weak that I could hardly do my work.
"I knew if I kept on at this rate
that I wouldn't last long, so I decided
to try Taniad, as I had seen in the
papers where it had been helping so
many people. And sir. It proved to
be just the thing I had been needing
all the time; why, I hadn't finished
half a bottle before I was feeling a

just simply quit taking it because 'all

BY TRIS SPEAKER
Manager of the Near-criampion
Indians
One of the finest sports offered to
hitting a duck hurtling through the
air at express train speed. They're
as hard to hit as one of Walt John
son's speed balls.'
Wing shooting is a splendid help
to the batting '.eye. And hitting at. I
11'. , 1. T 1 . - . . . .
vai jumisons iasiAst ones likewise
is gooa training for the shooter.
Whether the shooting be for
ducks, grouse, quail, clay pigeon, or
some other fast flying object, it whet
tens up the keenness of eye and
makes a fellow more capable of con-j
necting with a baseball. Most of the!
batting stars in baseball are crack
wing shots. J
The average hunter who travels to
Canada in the fall of the year is in
search of bear, deer, moose or cari
bou. . In consequence, he does not
carry a -shotgun or does he have
occasion) usually to use it ' However,
if your trips can be arranged there
are certain places out of the range
of your . big game rip where duck
shooting may be indulged "in to ad
vantage. .Such was the case on our fishing
and hunting trip in Ontario. After
having such splendid luck with the
October' muskalunge I joined my
companions for a few days with the
ducks. One of the things that struck
me most forcibly in hunting duckj
around Rice .Lake and the Kawarthasi
was that, contrary to. my previous ex
periences, the calmer and quieter ehe
weather the better the shooting.
The. reason for this was that the
ducks "bedded" up at night in the
open water and in the mornings dur
ing the flight to the feetding grounds
they could more plainly see your de
coys. The shooting was done from
blinds along the various "points" of
the lake. They do not decoy as well
in the fall as in the Spring, hut dur
ing the hour or so when they are
leaving the lake one can generally
get a fair amount of sport.
One morning while cleaning . up
my gun in the cottage I heard a ter
rible bombardment for a , few min
utes down at- Margaret's island point.
I strolled down there' aha Nunamaker
and Ackerman were counting up the
ducks. They had twenty-seven, in
cluding ' bluebllls. redheads, : whistlers
and several other varieties
We got in a week of hunting of
this sort and eachVday our party
managed to have, some great' sport
some days the shooting being good
at one. of our blinds alon'g the point
and not so good in others.
But t was good enough' to, make
me forget all about the cares of a
baseball manager. ...

EPISCOPALIANS
NAME LEADERS
FOR BIG DRIVE
"Every Member" Campaign
to Be Waged Next
Month.
Vith but four weeks in which to
complete parish organization and
preparation for the "Every Xanie" nation-wide
campaign of the Protestant
Episcopal Church during the first
week of December, local Episcopa
lians are bending their efforts toward
the perfection of the machinery to
make the drive successful.
Word has just been received here
of the naming of the commission of
fifteen that will have charge of the
campaign, the purpose of which is not
so much the raising of a given sum of
money for church work, but to bring
to its fullest expression the whole
power of the Episcopal church to
meet the task confronting all churches
in the present period of world read
justment.
All Distinguished Men.
Henry P. Davison, who has been
the director of the Ameiican Hed
Cross during the w ar, has been named
as the organization executive for the
forthcoming campaign. Many notable
churchmen and laymen prominent
in Episcopal church work are included
in the commission of fifteen, the
membership of which is: Bishop
ChaTles P. Anderson, of Chlcagt;
Bishop John G. Murray, of Maryland;,
Bishop Arthur S. Lloyd, BiL.iop Fred-1
erick - F. Reese, of Georgia; Bishop
Charles fSnmner Burch, of New York;
Rev. Dr. Ernest M. Stires, of New
York; Rev. Dr. Edward S. Rousman
lers, of Massachusetts; Rev. Dr. James
E. Freeman, of Minnesota; Rev. Dr.
William H. Milton, of East Carolina;
Rev. DrI Frank H. Nelson, of Southern
Ohio; Henry P. Davison, of New
York; Arthur Woods, of New York;
George Wharton Pepper, of Philadel
phia; Burton Mansfield, of New Ha
ven, Connecticut, and Oliver J. Sands,
of Richmond, Virginia.
Campaign Is Endorsed.
At the recent meeting of the tri
ennial general convention of the
Episcopal church inDetroit, plans for
the nation-wide campaign were fully
endorsed. The campaign in its out
line follows the plan of the recent
successful Methodist Centenary Cam
paign and is a campaign in line with
the campaigns of the Baptists, Pres
byterians and other churches, to stim
ulate a greater interest In church af
fairs and to' spread the Christian doc
trine both in this country and abroad.
One of the very important ends
sought in the forthcoming .Episcopal
campaign is the recognition of the
necessity for higher salaries for the
Episcopal cleigy so the clergyman, to
quote 'the Yesolr.tion of the Detroit
convention, shall be enabled "to do
his work as a leader of the church
with efficiency and self respect."
Estimate Is Reduced.
In this connection, the joint com
mission at a meeting held in New
York City last week, fixed as the
amount necessary to the needs of the
church in its program the sum of
$42,000,000. The figure first fixed was
$62,000 but this sum was revised te
make the s program as efficient ant
reasonably economical as the pressing
needs of the organization would per
mit. Of this total the sum of $28.
000,000 is contemplated for general
work and $14,000,000 for Diocesan
activities. Of the total for general
work, the sum of $10,000,000 Is to be
devoted, to home missionary work In
the dioceses and missionary districts
of America. J The remainder is to be
used for missionary work in foreign
fields, for social service, religious ed
ucation and Americanization and
other work at home.
No difficulty is anticipated in rais
ing the full sum needed during the
closing week of the campaign. All
funds for the general work of the
church will be appropriated and dis
tributed by the duly constituted au
thority, after careful and thorough in
vestigation, with consideration to the
proper and reasonable distribution ol
funds throughout, the whole church
and to the work of the various boards
and agencies.
. In connection with the nation-wide
campaign an intensive publicity pro
gram Is being carried out with the
object of not only stirring Episco
palians to the needs of their own
church, but of showing the general
public the purposes of the Episcopal
church In the campaign which Is now
beginning.
