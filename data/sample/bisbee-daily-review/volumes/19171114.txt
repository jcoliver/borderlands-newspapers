labor until Germany has been beaten
received Its first answer today when
the building trades depaitment of the
American Federation of Labor or-
deied the discontinuance of all s'rikes
on government work under its juris
diction.
While the immediate result of the
department's movement will affect
only strikes on buildings that are be
ing erected for shipbuilding or the
manufacture of war munitions, I' was
regarded as a precedent for the ad
justment of all difficulties that might
delay the prosecution of the govern
ment's war work plans.
Today's session of the federation
convention was brief. The'usual batch
of resolutions was received and re
ferred to committees. Among them
was one calling upon the legislative
committe to obtain the enactment of
legislation that will extend the eight

Premier Painleve Resigns Fol

PARIS, Nov. 13. The ministry re-
signed tonight. ,
The resignation of the ministry foi
lowed Its defeat in the chamber of
deputies by a' vote of 277 to 186.
After the government had obtained
a restricted but sufficient majority on

former Minister of the Interior Malvy,
but Premier Painleve demanded a
postponement of the interpellations
until November 30, when the inter
allied conference would be finished.
A postponement was then made a
question of confidence, and the cham
ber, by a vote of 277 to 186, in which
the right joined the cabinet's PPo-j
nents, refused to acquiesce m me pre
mier's demand. Thereupon the min
isters left the chamber and went to
the Elysee palace and resigned.
Prof. Paul Painleve organized the
cabinet on September 14, and succeed
ed Alexandre Ribot as premier, whose
ministry resigned on September 7.
The new cabinet, which originally
consisted of fifteen titular ministers,
four mini3t,ers of state and eleven
under-secretaries, came immedia'ely
under the fire of the socialists", who
were opposed to M. Ribot as foreign
minister. This cabinet resigned on
October 22. but President Poincaire
refused to accept the resignation on
the ground that the chamber had vot
ed confidence in the ministry.
M. Ribot was then eliminated from
the cabinet, being succeeded by J
Louis Barthou as head of the foreign
office. The recons tituted government
received a vote of confidence, 2S8 to
137. The opposi'ion voters were part
ly from the socialists and partly from
the radical socialists. The vote seem
ed to Indicate hesitation on the part
of the chamber to defeat any ministry
by a direct vote during the war.

Barley a Great Grain
superior to wheat in some ways as a food grain. But
home users have been unable to get hold of much
barley flour.
This difficulty is all smoothed out when you use
Grape-Nuts
a food made of the finest malted barley and the finest
whole wheat, all ground in our own mills.
Think of it! Barley superior in protein, with a di
gestive element which not only transforms its own
grain, but the wheat berry also. In Grape-Nuts and
cream you have a delicious food, containing all the
material needed for balanced nourishment.

"I have gained Bfteen pounds since
taking Tanlac and am feeling like a
well woman for the first time in six
years," said Mrs. J. H. Smith, wife of
a well known real estate man and liv
ing at 215 Callahan, Muskogee, recent

digestion, nervousness and a general
breakdown." she continued, "and in
spite of everything I could do I kept
getting worse all the time. I had no
appetite, and for weeks at a time I
lived on raw eggs and sweet milk and
even that would sometimes disagree
wl;h me. I had dizzy spells and my
head would swim so I couldn't walk
across the room without holding on to
something. My nerves were all 'on
edge and I coulda't hardly sleep at
all for worrying about my condition
and by morning I would be so weak
and fagged out I was hardly able to
get up at all. I was fast going down
hill and I actually go so weak and list
hill and I actually got so weak and list
bed and stay there half the time.
"One day my mother came to see me
and she fold me so much about the
good Tanlac had done her that I or
dered a bottle and started taking it
and I had taken only a few doses wben
I knew 1 had at last found what 1 need
ed. I have improved right along ever
since and I can now eat anything I
want and it agrees with me. I don't
have those dizzy shells any more, my
nerves are all right again and I sleep
like a baby. I have gained so much in
every way that I am strong enough to
do all my housework and find it a
pleasure instead of a task. I have
taken many different kinds of medi
cines during the last six years but
Tanlac was the only one that really
did me any agood."
"Tanlac is sold In Bisbee by J. M.

the surprising things in connection
with the campaign is the way in which
some of the younger boys are giving.
They have been more patriotic than
many of the older boys. The boys feel
quite conQden'. that they will go 50 per
cent over the amount asked for before
the campaign is Tver. Any boy who
ha$ not been called on by one of the
committee may have the privilege oi

by calling at the boys' department of

GAS
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

SUFFRAGE ON THE WAY.
New York's enfranchisement of women, by apparent
ly more than 100,000 majority of the votes cast in Tues
day's election, clearly indicates that universal suffrage
throughout the United States is not only on the way,
but close at band. It is inevitable. .
One by one the western states during recent years
have been yielding to the never-ending bombardment
of the suffrage cohorts and falling into the votes-for-women
column; but not before has the conquest reached
beyond the Appalachians. Suffrage battles have been
wager, times innumerable, in eastern and New England
states, but not before with victory.
Prior to last Tuesday the female suffrage banner bore
thirteen stars, each star representing a conquered state.
Now it bears fourteen, and the fourteenth state to
capitulate is the greatest in point of wealth and popula
tion in the nation, and its capture is proportionately the
greatest of them all.
The prestige afforded by such a victory can hardly
be overestimated, and the nation might as well begin now
to prepare its politics and readjust its institutions in ad
vance of a general crumbling of equal suffrage opposi
tion, because it is only a question. xt time until tlie en
tire nation will succumb.
Compared with the New York victory, the suffrage
defeat in Iowa the other day, and that in Ohio last Tues
day which seems to be certains-are insignificant, and
will quickly be forgotten. And the New York victory Is
heightened by the fact that it follows an overwhelming
defeat two years ago, and it comes as a successful con
clusion of a perennial battle which began seventy years
ago.
With this added leverage, and quickened by the re
newed, revived courage which "such a victory "is bound
to instill, the crusade may be expected to go on with in
creased vigor and determination.
And that it will eventually triumph throughout the na
tion admits of no doubt.
SOCIALISM DEFEATED CADORNA.
Socialism is probably responsible for the disaster
which has befallen Italy. It has been known that Gen
eral Cadorna was aware of the German intention to at
tack him, but it, has been assumed hitherto that he was
deceived about the place. The Germans are supposed to
have struck him unexpectedly in a weak spot, taken him
by surprise. This, it now appears, was not the fact.
"Cadorna," General Maurice Informs us, "knew of the
approaching attack, its place and approximate date."
Why, then, did his troops give way before it? It
was not because of any overwhelming concentration of
Germans; General Maurice disposes of that legend too.
The Italians gave way before the same Austrian army
which they bad previously defeated, reinforced by Ger
man units whose number hag been greatly exaggerated.
Why did they give way? The Italian offirial bulletins, in
the first shock and horror of the catastrophe, ascribed
it to "cowardice" on tile part of certain units, but subse
quently eliminated the word. What was back of that
charge and Its subsequent withdrawal without retrac
tion? General Maurice says:
"It is clear that a great part of the disaster, tor It
can be called nothing else, was due to Insidious propa
ganda which has gone further than Cadorna suspected."
, But not further than Von Buelow 'suspected, not fur
ther than he positively knew. The German peace propa
ganad is a military mannuvre. conducted with the inten
tion of bringing about German victories in the field. It
brought about such a victory iu Galicia last summer.
It has brought about another in (lie Julian Alps this fall.
It intends to bring about more. A peace propaganda, a
Socialist, is doing more effective work actual military
work for the German arms than Crown Prime Freder
ick William, Hindenburg and Buelow put together.
Nor need we expect that our own armies will not be
attacked in the same manner that thowe of Italy and
Russia have been. The Gorman propagandist will do his
best to weaken their morale in the same way in whi u
he weakened those of Korniloff and Cadorna. It is time
to recognize him, not for a misguided theorist, but for
a German soldier doing military work for Ludendorff,
end for the same purpose for which Buelow is doing it
to bring about disaster to our arms. Throughout the
war socialism has worked on the side of Germany, al
ways helping the enemy of the democracies of England,
France, Russia and the United States.
CAMOUFLAGE.
That awful war word "camouflage" serves for the po
litical as well as the military operations of war.' Wit
ness the solemn declaration by Erzberger that through
the Kaiser's condescension Germany has "crossed the
Rubicon" and quietly but quickly become a democracy.
Alas, real democracy is not such a mask of political
twigs and canvas and paint as this.
It is something thus arranged from above like a
cover over a railroad or a battery. It is rooted and grods
from below. A poulticing of friction and discontent with
in a poorly powered and poorly representative Reichstag
by an imperial willingness to change chancellors, to scat
ter high sounding jobs about and to bid these function
aries act in smoother accord with the discontented fac
tions, is not genuine democracy.
This third war time chancellor with a fourth re
ported Still under cover for the days when peace bar
gaining is finally attained does not constitute the sort of
premier that real parliamentary government calls for.
Though hailing from Bavaria, he is still in title and in
effect to be linked with Prussian political domination.
Harmony is very far from responsibility; the "all high
est" still clings to the substance of his autocratic pre
rogatives. He appears to be merely throwing to the
Cerberus of opinion abroad and at home a sop that de
serves to rank with some of the "substitution" sops mas
querading as food at home.
When, by effective will of the German people, not by
haughty grace of the imperial German government, there
shall be effected a real and single responsibility to a re
constructed parliament, possessing full instead of a few
powers, nndominated by a Bundesrath and based on an
honest suffrage, it will be time to claim that a change
has been wrought in the first three letters of the old
word "autocracy." The river to be crossed to reach this
may also begin with "R" but not be the Rubicon.
In December, 1916, the power that had been infatuated
with war attempted vain camouflage as a fond devotee
of peace. Now it is evidently planning a "repetition of
the maneuver this time with the added bluff of having
met any Yankee specifications anent people and govern
ment But whatever their ingenuity in trench tricks or with
disguised U-boats, the Teutonp are still clumsy in poli
tical as well as in diplomatic camouflage.

THANKSGIVING.
President Wilson's Thanksgiving Proclamation recites
the causes of thankfulness that Americans have, their
"great blessings." They are fighting "against a tyranny
that "threatened to master and debase men everywhere."
They are defending their own rights and those of free
men throughout the world." They are united in a com
mon purpose and filled "with a new and greater national
spirit."
To many the world looks dark and Thanksgiving a
sort of mockery or a hypocrisy. They are grievousij
wTong. The United States has been roused by a momen
tous danger into heroic mood and action. America has
not deigned to eat the fat and drink the sweet, to heap
up wealth and forget courage, patience, self-sacrifice,
love of country, to slink ignobly from the supreme bat
tle for liberty and democracy, to wait, prosperous and
dishonored, until Germany, having had her will of Eu
rope, comes to chastise and dominate ne United States.
Though our sons be called to wounds and death, though
our purses be thinned, though doubtful or disastrous
days come upon us for a time, we have chosen the better
part. We shall be able to endure the worst fortune and
the bitterest. hardships. We are strong in union, in the
Justice of our cause. We have learned to be brave, to
be kind, to put by superfluities, to further by every good
means the defense and rescue of democracy.
This will be a Thanksgiving of national patriotism,
of men and women purified and strengthened by peril
and the discipline of self-denial, grateful that America
has proved her greatness of soul.

"ARCH ENEMIES OF HUMANITY."
Impressive testimony regarding two demoralizing agen
cies in human affairs comes from the Kentucky court of
appeals. It is given in the case of Little vs. Common
wealth as quoted iu the Southwestern Reporter for Oc
tober 31. The case was one iu which Brock Little had
been convicted of killing a negro, Mitchell Crawford, and
had been sentenced to life imprisonment. The testimony
showed that Little had become quarrelsome after drink
ing, and finally had shot Crawford with a revolver. In
affirming the conviction the court of appeals said:
"It seems to be a case where two arch enemies
to the peace and happiness of humanity (whisky
and a pistol) met, and co-operating, produced what
Is too often the case, a homicide. While we might
sympathize with the unfortunate defendant, be
cause of the condition into which his conduct has
brought him. we do not think that the reasons as
signed and urged for a reversal of the judgment
are sufficient for that purpose."
Luckily for us that we do not use silver for food or
fuel. The price Is still advancing.
Late in the month of August the'
merchants of Bisbee signed an agree- i
ment to close their stores at 6 o'clock;
p. ni. every week-day, including Sat-;
urday. The signers of this agreement i
included department stores, grocers.'
meat markets, specialty shops and the:
exclusive men's stores. !
This early closing seemed to work,
out to the entire satisfaction of bothj
merchant and purchaser, until onlyre-j
cen'ly, a few of the small stores on
both Main street and Brewery Gulch!
have been violating the agreement'
which they signed by keeping theiri
stores open on Saturday evening until
7 o'clock, and in some instances even!
later. - j
"Should this practice continue,"
said a local business man yesterday,''
it win eventually disrupt, tne t o ciock
closing plan, and we -will sooner or
later have to return to the old method
of keeping the stores open until 8 or
9 o'clock on Saturday nights, and
few, if any, of us want to see the
clerks have to put in this long Satur-t
day shift, simply because some of thej
small stores through greed and avar-j
ice wish to return to the old system:
of catch the last nickel. j
"Most of the merchants have ad-,
hered to the agreement steadfastly!
and unequivocally. These stores are
undoubtedly entitled to every ones
preference and patronage. And since
the majority of residents of the, War
ren district are wage earners, work
ing in some capacity or another for
'day's pay,' they should resent to their
fullest strength the effort or attempt
of any merchant r individual to work
the clerks of llisbee beyond 6 o'clock
on Saturdays.
"I would appeal to the workingmen
nf pverv other craft The clerks
" - - i
should be supported. Every one can
lend l hem this help without iucon-J
venicnce. I he stores tliat sianu nrni
for 6 o'clock Saturday closing are
marked by a diamond shaped white
card printed in blue ink. bearing this
inscription: 'Help the clerks secure
shorter hours. Trade here. We close
at 6 o'clock p. m. Shop early. In
dorsed by loyally league. Citizen's
Protective league. Women's liyalty
league. Local Red Cross chapter, Y.
M. C. A.. Y .W. C. A. and the Warren

the store in which this little card is
conspicuoously displayed, patronize it.j
and bv so doing lend your assistance
to the clerks to secure the shorter
working hours to which they are just-,
ly entitled."
Until the setlement of the labor dif
ferences between the miners and the
mine operators of the G".Obe-Mianil dis
trict has been effected and the plan
as proposed by the federal mediation
commission and accepted by the min
ers and operators has been placed in
full operation, the removal of the Unk

would be unwise, according to the rec
ommendations of Governor Thomas E.

to Giobe, where he held many confer
