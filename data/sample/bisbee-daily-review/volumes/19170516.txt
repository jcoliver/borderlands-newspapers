circulation.
Representative Young of North Da
kota said that if the government
would pay for the free advertising
given by newspapers, the papers
could afford to pay first class mail
rates.

PRESIDENT LAUNCHES LIE TO
SPEED UP WAR LEGISLATION
WASHINGTON, May 15 President
Wilson tonight began an effort to
have congress speed up war legisla
tion. Tonight at a conference with
members of the senate and house
committees he emphasized the imper
ative necessity for prompt action
upon the food control legislation the
administration believes is essential
to the conduct of the war.
No specific agreements were reach
ed but there were indications that
the committeemen went away pre
pared to undertake early enactment
of . laws to prevent speculation in
foods and to assure an equitable re
turn to the producer and a fair price
to the consumer. There were sug
gestions that there had been too
much alarmist talk about food conditions.
The president stated emphatically
that it would' be difficult to express
in parliamentary language .what
should be done with anyone who
would speculate in food products In
a situation like the present
' Secretary Houston, who was called
into the -conference, made clear the
administration's intentions concerning
price control. It 'is not intended, he
potted out, to fix minimum prices,
generally, but only in spare instances
to force the unloading of hoarded
stocks of food. Minimum prices
would be fixed generally to producers
if necessary to encourage production.
The president said that in his opin
ion the three factors that will con
trol the war situation, in the order
of their Importance, are the actual
fighting forces, control of the food
situation, and control of the trans
portation facilities of the country.

the German chancellor today bluntly refused, to enter intoa
discussion of Germany's peace aims as demanded in inter

Dr. Von Bethmann Hollweg asserted that these called
for the government's specific peace program, the announce

practical service to the nation in the present situation.
While appreciating the passionate desire of all classes to

that he would not permit himself to be swayed by pressure
from any source, and that he was not under the spell of any
party or clique.

Many scenes in "The White Raven"

Miss Barrymore has rare opportunity
for contrasts, none 'at which is neg-

In the first part of the production
Miss Barrymore, for the first time in
her career,. does a song and dance.
Never before has she been seen in
such a role and it was only because it
was absolutely essential to the 3nr

cause of her unwavering devotion t'J

THE LIBERTY LOAN.
Early indications are that the $2,000,000,000 war Issue,
given the happly title, "The Liberty Loan," will be great
ly oversubscribed by the banks of the country before the
treasury books close on June 15. The attitude of the
bankers in every section has been most encouraging.
The attitude of the public, which is depended on to ao
sorb the big issue, should be even more enthusiastic. .
It is a great popular loan for a great national purpose.
A British statesman remarked early in the war that the
victory would be determined by "the last $500,000,000."
It will probably fall to us io provide .that last decisive
loan. But before it is reached there must be many bil
lions poured into the allied war treasury. The present
issue, 2,000,000,000 "golden bullets" is but Uie beginning.
The magnitude of the sums wanted need frighten no
one. They are huge, but small compared with our na
tional resources and our individual ability to contribute.
We have been a nation of wasters. 'It is estimated that
we have used up $5,000,000,000 a year in careless manage
ment of our personal affairs, and in unnecessary xpendi
tures for indulgence and amusements. Our extrava
gance, on the whole, may have done us no great harm,
but it is no longer excusable. We have better uses for
our money now.
Wise retrenchment is a universal duty. We must "save
to win," putting our savings into war bonds. The money
will go to pay the operating expenses of the armies and
navies that are fighting the battle of world-democracy.
This is not merely a duty. It is a privilege to every
man or woman capable of patriotic inspiration. It is a
pleasure to contribute in such a cause.
But never has patriotism paid bigger material divi
dends than it will pay in this case. As the New York
Times well says: "Every dollar spent for the liberty loan
helps those working for the common'cause. Every dollar
the nation spends comes back with interest to those who
enable the nation to spend it The mone is borrowed to
spend. The spending means wages anprosperity for
the thrifty. To save a dollar and lend itto your country
or our allies Is to benefit yourself equally, and .to provide
the funds to ease life for those perhaps unable to lend
to the country. '
"There is no way of spending such sums without pro
ducing what are called good times that is, the free cir
culation of funds with rising prices. Such an outpouring
of wage funds, such a sure source of profits, was never
in sight before."
The loan will pay dividends which, thought not high,
should be satisfactory considering that they are non-taxable.
The bonds are a good investment for personal
funds because they are as good as cash for all sorts' of
financial purposes they will be accepted in payment for
almost any purchase or obligation, or as security for
loans end they are superior to cash because they draw
interest They offer the best possible investment of trust
funds, for they are absolutely the soundest securitiesln
the world.
Other forms of investment generally are quiescent just
now, taking a back seat while the Liberty Loan goes
through. They may well do so. for their turn will come.
The money isn't leaving the country. It is merely being
assembled for redistribution. These billions will soon be
flowing faster than ever through all the business arteries
and veins of the nation. And the quicker we buy Uis
bonds, the more the process will be accelerated.
INVICTUS.
The war means this: Either Germany will be defeated
or the United States will be defeated.. If Germany U
victorious it will be because the United States is con
quered. If the United States is conquered it will mean
that we pay the price which the vanquished have to pay.
We cannot admit that any such possibility is to be
considered. There is no such possibility. We are in the
war. That means that we win the war. No matter how
long the road and no matter how bloody the scroll, if
one nation is to be beaten down that nation shall not he
the United States.
The American people, entered upon an enterprise
which' they do not as yet see clearly defined, will find the
definition of it and they will be the architects of their
own fate.
We do not know now the undertaking upon which we
have feet forth. It may require pages in the newtpapers.
giving casualty lists, to make this enterprise plain and
terrible, as it will be made plain and terrible. But this
is our thought: Well get the other fellow. He shall not
get us. It is one or the other now. It Is the United
States or it is Germany. By the grace of God it shall be
Germany. '
Good Friday shall be the day when the present order
of things ended in Germany. It is either that or Good
Friday was the day when things began to be humiliatlng
ly different in the United States.
We either win, now, or we pay tribute. And millions
for defense and not a penny for tribute never had a bet
ter cause to command utterance.'
- We can and shall get the other fellow. It is beyond
thought that he should be allowed to get us. We do not j
intend to pay billions in indemnities to Germany. We
shall not, when victorious, put a tax on the German peo
ple. We desire that order shall be restored and freedom
of neonles guaranteed In the world. We desire that the
helmet give way for a while to the bowler.
We have no illusions that we are killing war for all
time by this war. We are fighting this war for the secur
ity of the United States, for Its morale and material
prospects. It must be won. It shall be won. There Is
no other answer. . ,
Germany shall regard Good Friday of 1917 as a day of
wrath. The United States shall regard it as a' day of
grace.--Chlcago Tribune.

MOTHER'S FAILINGS.
According to Dr. Effle I Lobdell, a health specialist.
Mother Is in dajiger of losing her job, as well as her ped
estal if she doesn't get busy.
"The home," she laments, "has ceded to the hospital.
and mother's milk to infant foods. Mother's cuddling has
gone down befare nursery maids and mother's helpers
(an organized anti-mother association). ,
"Mother's room is supplanted by a nursery, nad
mother's arms by an automatic cradle. Teething is pro
duced by forced feeding, and a specialist writes a spe
cific order for baby's feeding each month. Walking Is
taught by a self-walking apparatus. Talking is taught
by a phonograph. Disobedience is permitted by indol
ence and indifference of the mother, and extravagance
Is taught by continual Idulgence."
Some of the Items in this arraignment really represent
an advance in the care of children. All the substitution
of the care of servants, doctors and hospitals for the per
sonal attention of the mother doesn't look so bad when
you consider the infant mortality statistics, and find out
how much larger a proportion of babies are saved for
maturity today than there were In the generations when
mother herself did everything for her offspring.
But that's the material side of It If the physical child
is better looked after than ever before, the same thing
can't be said of the child's mind and character. That s
where personal attention is worth more than all the dele
gated attention in the world. And from certain failings
observable in the rising generation, it looks as if, along
this line. Mother -speaking in general ought to get back
on the job. ,
Equip your kitchen with a GAS RANGE and a GAS FIRED WATER HEATER and free your kitchen tasks

CLEAN, practically without effort on your part, because dust and ashes are eliminated. EFFICIENT, because

COMFORTABLE not only in a physical sense, but because of
relief from the many worries that beset the particular housekeeper who
must depend upon an uncertain coal range.
We have a complete assortment of gas ranges on display, as well
as the different types of water heater. An investigation will place you

THE "EMPTY EGG SHELL."
German newsnaners refuse to take our war-makins;
seriously. The Berlin Zeitung am Mittag, indulging m
a hroadside of heavy humor over the "mobilizing of Amer
ican millionaires," efforts to "produce ships by magic"
and the offering of loans to France and Italy to "keep
them quiet," says: . '
"We do not underestimate the American danger where
it really exists, namely after' the war in commercial
matters. But for the Entente's present needs, American
has nothing to offer but a blown egg shell."
If Berlin wants to lull itself into a sense of security of
such nonsense, "we should worry!" It was just such c
view that official and journalistic Germany 4ook of Eng
land's entrance into the war. And it's instructive just
now to see that "contemptible little British army"-hammering
Hindenburg's line to pieces in northern France,
the British fleet controlling the sea still despite the ut
most efforts of German submarines, the enemies of Ger
many kept fighting by means of British money and muni
tions, and three-fourths of the world lined up against
Germany largely by British diplomacy.
Now, as Britain begins to feel the strain of carrying
the world"-war on her shoulders, the United States comes
along to take half the load. In the end, if necessary, we
can take it all.

CHICAGO GRAINS
CHICAGO. May 15. Heavy shrink
age in the value of wheat, at one
time as much as 19 cents a bushel,
took place today owing to the pros
pect which at last became a fixed
fact that established limits on high
prices would continue indefinitely and
that meanwhile all new buying of
wheat futures was at an end. The
market closed unsettled, 7 to 17 net
lower with July at 2.42 and Septem
ber at 2.20 to 2.21. Other leading
staples, too, showed a decided set
back -orn 2 to 3. oats 2 to
ZM. and provisions 7 to 25 cents.
Bearish effects of the restraint of
purchasers were supplemented by in
creased pressure fom' holders of July
and September options who took note
of reports that millers were only buy
ing cash wheat when they could sell
flour against it as a financial counter

IN THE BILLION DOLLAR CIRCLE OF- AMERICA'S GREATEST
COPPER DISTRICT
We make the unqualified assertion that there is no undeveloped
mining property in the Jerome District now being offered to the pub
lic, which will compare with the MICHIGAN-VERDE in its relative
location to the big mines of that district.
The MICHIGAN-VERDE today stands supreme as the most pro
mising, the most logical, the closest-in undeveloped property In the
Jerome District.
It lies about a stone's throw from the famous United Verde
"Glory Hole," from which Senator Clark has taken millions and mil
lions of dollars worth of gold, silver and copper ore.
It lies just across the hill from where the United Verde Is now
preparing to use steam shovels with which to take out the enormous
ore deposits.
, . It was selected by the' Western Copper Syndicate for financing,
out of more than forty that were offered and investigated selected
because of its location, because of the formation, and because the
geologist who reported on the property stated that the great ore bodies
of the United Verde and the United Verde Extension DIP TOWARD
THE PROPERTY OF THE MICHIGAN VERDE.
Is it not common sense to believe that when a man la working
underground in a mine, he should know what trend the ore body on
which he is working takes? The underground workings of the United
Verde extend into the hill toward the Mlchlgan-Verde property, and
men working in these northwest stopes of the United Verde, state
most positively, that the ore is headed directly toward the Michigan-
Verde. Unless Mother Nature built some kind of a wall in this hill
to stop the ore, what can keep it from extending on Into the MICH-'
IGAN-VERDE?
If these same miners working in the United Verde stopes did not
have confidence In their own ability to Judge where the ore was go
ing, WHY DID THEY BUY STOCK 4N THE MICHIGAN-VERDE
COPPER COMPANY? Ninety per cent of the MICHIGAN-VERDE
stock that has been sold to date was bought by Jerome miners men
who KNOW what they are doing when they back their pudgment of
a mining property with their money. It wasn't necessary to seil stock
to these men when it was offered for sale they came and BOUGHT
it and they bought it when the MICHIGAN-VERDE COPPER COM
PANY controlled only little more than HALF the property they now
OWN OUTRIGHT.
s rf 1 jt fyA I ( ciroPATPA va j
NOTE THE MICHIGAN-VERDE IN THE CREAM
OF THE DISTRICT.
Stock in the MICHIGAN-VERDE is being offered strictly on its
merits, as the best buy in Arizona as a logical, conservative invest
ment that promises rich returns.
The company has a small capitalization, when you consider the
holdings of 525 acres. OWNED OUTRIGHT. But two million shares
with a par value of 50 cents. It is worthy of note that SIXTY PER
CENT OF THIS STOCK IS IN THE TREASURY for development pur
poses, instead of the usual fifty per cent, and It Is worhty of your
most earnest consideration that absolutely NO PROMOTION STOCK
OR POOL RIGHTS ARE BEING OFFERED FOR SALE AT ANY
PRICE. The men behind the MICHIGAN-VERDE must make their
money by DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION.
, With its low capitalization and with the clean, straightforward
manner in which the proposition is Being handled, MICHIGAN-VERDE
has probabilities of from $50.00 to $100.00 per share, with development.
Frankly, we can see no reason why MICHIGAN-VERDE should not
make as great profits as have been made by those who invested in(
United Verde Extension, when It was selling at a low price and we
believe that right today, MICHIGAN-VERDE is a more logical buy than
United Verde Extension EVER WAS, before they struck ore.
It isn't going to take long to finance this property the stock is
growing in popularity every day and once development is started it
will not be possible to buy MICHIGAN-VERDE for less than $1.00
per share. We believe every practical mining man in Arizona will
agree with us that at the present price of 35 cents, it is selling for less
than it is actually worth on LOC ATION ALONE.
THE PRICE OF MICHIGAN-VERDE STOCK WILL POSITIVE
LY BE RAISED TO FIFTY CENTS PER SHARE DURING THE
CURRENT MONTH. The 35-cent allotment is limited and you should
place your order TODAY before the rise which wwill certainly come.

GLAD T0TEST1FY
Says Watoga Lady, "As To What
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga, W. Va. Mrs. S. W. Glad well,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years
of age, I suffered greatly . . . Sometimes
would go a month or two, and I had
terrible headache, backache, and bearing
down pains, and would just drag and
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
ind my health was awful.
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I began to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till 1
took three . . I gained, and was well
and strong, and I owe it all to Cardui.
I am married now and have 3 children
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
others."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
aches, backaches, or any of the other
ailments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need. .

General apathy which characterized
the wheat pit spread over the en
tire exchange floor today. Business
In corn, oats and provisions was by
far the smallest since the outbreak
of the war. No decision as to maxi
mum prices for other commodities
than wheat had been reached up to
the time the market closed. Ac
cordingly the tone of feed grains and
also of pork lard and ribs was one
of almost " unrelieved depression

He says that a few drops of a drug
called freezone, applied directly upon
a tender, aching corn, instantly re
lieves soreness, and soon the entire
corn, root and all, lifts out without
pain.
This drug Is sticky but dries at
once and it said to simply shrivel up
the com without inflaming or even
irritating the surrounding tissue. x
It is claimed that a quarter of an
