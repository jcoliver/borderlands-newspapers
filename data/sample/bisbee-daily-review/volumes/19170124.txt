(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 23 Troop
movements preliminary to with
drawal of the American expedition
from Mexico are being carried out
at the southern extremity of the
American line under war depart
ment "orders, anad as soon as
they are complete the main body
of the expedition probably will
start north.
Admit Movement
For the first time, officials ad
mitted today that the withdrawal
of outposts from El Valle and
other points about Cnlonia Dub
Ian had more than a local sig
nificance and was being carried
jut on orders from Washington.
They made no announcement as to
the probable time when lht general
northern movement would begin, and
would not even admit that withdrawal
of Pershing's troops after 10 pionths
in Mexico was at hand. Since the ef
fort to affect an agreement, with Gen
eral Carranza ended in failure, the ad
ministration has indicated that its
next 'step ' would be madj known
through action rather than by an
n'juncement. To War For Camp
Officials are much interested, hut
apparently little concerned, over
growing evidences that a determined
struggle -for possession of the terri
tory evacuated by Pershing may be
in progress soon between I'a'rrcnza
troops and revolutionists. '' '
VILLA, ZAPATA COMBINE
Today's official dispatches said -that
Villa and Zapata, the most
conspicuous revolutionary leaders
had allied themselves for opera
tions against th de facto armies '
and that 8,000 men had best) con-'.
centrated near Chihuahua for a''.
Villa campaign in the north. Since
Carranza declined to accept the
Atlantic City protocol, officers
here have indicated that such '
problems 'a the one developed .
about Chihuahua not only would
'be left to Carranza for settlement '
bat that he would be held respon
sible by the United States govern
ment for their settlement in such
a way as to protect American In
terests. 7
Meantime raising of die embargo on
arms to Mexico and the dispatch of
Ambassador Fletcher to Mexico City
remain in abeyance. There were in
dications today that the prospec. of
sending the ambassador to his post
had been made more indefinite by two
developments construed in 3ome quar
ters as a renewal cf practices which
the Cnited States has protested re
peatedly. Carranza Peeves U. S.
"Officials are surprised and perplexed
over the drastic measures taken by the
first chief against two banks whose
metallic reserve recently was seized,
and by what some contend is a revival
of persecution of the Roman Catholic
clergy.
Seized Foreign Banks
Information reaching the 'British
embassy today from an official of the
Dunk of London and Mexico and the
National Rank of .Mexico say their
bullion and currency were taken as a
loan only. From the Rank of London
and Mexico the amount taken was val
ued at 4,000.000 pes'JB. The National
Rank's quota was 5.000,000 pesos. Re
maining in the vaults of the first are
16.00i.000 pesos and the institution's
officers fear this may also be removed.
Agents of the de facto government art
in possession of a building and the
keys to the vaults.
The problem presented by the seiz
ures has been called to the state de
partment again by representatives of
the stockholders, wh are for the
most part British and French. If rep
resentations are made by Uie Ameri
can state department they probably
will be based on the assumption that
the interests of American stockhold
ers may be injured.

EL PASO, Jan. 23. American
troops were expected to arrive in Co
lonia Dublan, Chihuahua, tonight from
El Valle (San Buena Ventura), com
pleting the first general movement of
the expeditionary forces preliminary
to their withdrawal to the border. The
Charcos outpost was reported to have
arrived at field headquarters in Co
lonia Dublan late today. If this re
port is confirmed, this will be the first
of the outpost commands to join the
main expeditionary force at field head
quarters. Charcos is thirty miles
from Colonia Dublan.
The El Valle troops, numbering ap
proximately 2500, were said to have
left there Sunday for the northern
Mormon colony. Refore leaving, the
American troops dynamited all of the
adobe houses which had been built by
the men of the outpost command to
shelter "them from the cold and from
the winds of the mountain' plains. Af
ter dynamiting the honses, the camp
sites were rolled with the heavy road
rollers, according to truck drivers
who have arrived at Columbus from
El Valle with supplies.
50O0 Citizens Flee
These truck drivers also reported
that five thousand natives and for
eigners in the zone occupied by the
punitive expedition in Mexico, were
preparing to make the trek to the bor
der behind the troops. Many were
coming in wagons, on burros and oth
ers on foot,' the drivers reported,
while others were planning to corue
out on the Mexican trains. All fear
Villa will occupy the country as soon
as it is evacuated by General Persh
ing's troops. .
All the sick soldiers in the field
hospital at Colonia Dublan and in the
smaller hospitals along the line of
communication were being sent to the
border today. The Columbus field
base hospital is crowded and many
were being sent to Fort Bliss here
where they are entered in the district
base hospital here.
Trucks were constantly arriving at
Columbus today, according to passen
gers coming in on the late trains.
Five hundred motor trucks and lor
ries are plying between the border
and headquarters and have brought
ordnance stores, supplies and equip
ment which are being stored in large
tents at Columbus until disposition
can be made of these stores.

IX.NDON, Jan. 23. President Wil
son's address (o the United States
Senate has furnished the Rritish gov
ernment and public with a surprise
as electrifying as his mediatory note
to the belligerents. With the excep
tion of the Manchester Guardian and
the Daily News, which are the, only
papers, in Great Rritain that can be
classed as pacificatory in policy, the
press gives the President's utterances
an unfriendly reception and engages
in much speculation over the meaning
which, it is considered, may be con
cealed behind certain passages.
Public men interviewed begin with
courteous tributes to the President's
good intention and end by supporting
Great Rritain's measures. While the
government cannot make any direct
reply to a communication from the
President of the United States to the
Senate there is certain to be debates
in Parliament. The usages of the
House of Lords give even greater lat
itude for addresses on any topic any
member wishes to discuss than the
American Senate, while the question
paper of the House of Commons fur
nishes an equally good opportunity
for the advancement of personal
views. It is already foreshadowed by
members of the commons that a dis
cussion will be insisted upon when
Parliament reassembles and speeches
from members of the present and late
cabinet are expected.

Congress on committing the nation to

PHOENIX, Jan. 23. The bal
ance of interest in the legislature
today was transferred to the Sen
ate which held an all day session,
passed several bills and generally
seemed to be getting ready for
the welcome of a de facto gover
nor for it was in the air all day
that the supreme court tomorrow

-the
bi'l reouii inir that all persons en -
gared in hazardous employment
should be able to understand and
speak the English language. The lab
or committee of the Senate today re
turned the bill with a favorable re
port and it was taken up in the com
mittee of the whole. The need of a
j slight correction in the language that
1 might easily have been made in the
1 committee was seized upon by the op-
ponents of the bill to re-refer it to the
committee. The friends of the bill
made a strenuous effort to bring it to
a vote but were overruled. Not only
will the correction be made but Chair
man Mahoney of the committee on
labor announced that a public hearing
would be given next Monday at two
o'clock at which employers as well as
labor advocates would be heard. It is
the belief that the Senate at present
st.-nds 10 to 9 against the bill.
Plans Salary Changes '
It was decided by the Senate today
to undertake a revision of the county
salary lists in the interest of uniform
ity. It frequently happens that one
of the lower class pays higher salar
ies than a county with a much great
er assessed valuation. Several salary
bills, applicable only to counties of
certain class have been brought in, 1
affecting the salary of, maybe, only
one or two officers. Rut this morn
ing, Mr. Maddox of Navajo, presented
a bill increasing all of the salaries in
that eleventh class county. All coun- j
ty salary hills were thereitpre referred 1
to the committee on counties and I
county affairs for the purpose of
bringing in a graded salary bill. (

(By Review Leased Wire) j
BERLIN (Monday) Jan. 22. (wire- j
less to the A. P.) Heavy snowfalls ;
followed by bitingly cold weather on
all the battle fronts, have helped j
rather than hindered the fighting, j
During the past forty-eight hours, the j
weather man seemingly has been en-1
tirely impartial for the cold snap ;
which In the northeast has enabled
the Russians to cross the swamps be- j
tween Riga and Dvinsta and to attack
the German positions also made it :
possible for the Germans in Rumania .
to approach Galatz which, ordinarily, j
is protected by swamps. j
In the west cold weather has been
accompanied only partly by a clear
atmosphere, enabling the flyers to re
sume their activity. Neither side,
however, has been specially "favored.
Artillery duels have increased at fre
quent intervals all along the line from
the coast to the Swiss border.
French to Strike
Exceptionally active patrolling by
the entente forces has not prevented
the Germans from discovering that
the French recently have withdrawn
to a large tent from their old posi
tions on the . o:nme front as far south
as Peronnc, . d that they have been
replaced by British troops, presum
ably in order to give the French di
visions an opportunity to rest in prep
aration fcr a gigantic test of strength
which is expected by everyone at the
first opportunity.
The impression from a visit to any
part of the front is that both siaes
anticipate an unprecedented offensive
before long and that artillery and pa
trol activity to which the fighting now
is limited is more or less a kind of
jockying for the start, to enable one
opponent to gain the advantage of be
ing the first to assume the offensive.
In the east, the cold weather is
holding up operations considerably,
y tut is not preventing the Russians in
the eastern Carpathians from making
despeiate efforts to save themselves
from being forced backward to such
an extent that their positions on the
upper Sereth river will be flanked and
taken.
Stories of alleged tremendous Ger
man losses in the Carpathians and in
Rumania are vigorously denied, and
it is stated that one ordinary German''
division suffered losses of only five j
hundred men in capturing more than
five hundred Russian officers and 39,
liOO soldiers.

TO PROSE BOOKS OF
N. Y. STOCK EXCHANGE
(Continued From Page One)
power to compel the members of the
exchange to produce their records.
Noble's counsel. Samuel Taylor, also
explained that the brokers were great
ly averse to submitting their records
to the committee through fear that
"many Innocent" purchasers' names
would be made public. Relations be
tween broker and client were regard
ed in Wall Street, he said, quite as
confidential as those of lawyer and
client
It was explained that it was not the
committee's desire to make public the
names of any whose transactions
would not tend to throw light on the
"leak" rumors.
An offer to receive the names in
sealed envelopes apparently appealed
to the board of governors, for in a set
of resolutions adopted at their hur
riedly called second meeting, the sug
gestion virtually was accepted.
The resolutions asked specifically
that the members furnish the chair
man of the clearing house committee
with statements showing on what
stocks customers were long and short
at the end of each day between De
cember 10 and December 23. the real
names of the customers, the stocks
they dealt in, and the number of
shares each. What clearing house
stocks were borrowed, when, and
from whom borrowed, and when re
f urned, also am to be included.
Members further are requested in
another resolution to advise the sec
retary of the exchange if they receiv
ed any cable or wireless communica
tions from abroad with reference to
the President's peace note before It
vas made public here. The request
was in keeping with a resolution
"aopted by the rules committee today.
The committee, advised by tele
phone of the action taken by the
-oard of governors at their second
v.eeting, exhibited suspicion. Not
vtihstanding the action of the board,
doubt still exists in some quarters, as
to whether the members will furnish
he desired information.
NEW YORK. Jan, 23. Mr. Whipple
expressed the view that the constitu
Mon of the exchange provided for fore
;ng the production of liooks at such
m inquiry as the present one.
Mr. Noble and Samuel F. Streit,
chairman of the New York Stock Ex
"hange clearing house committee,
Tere the only witnesses examined to
day. They were questioned by Mr.
W3:ipplf ps to the power of experi
enced speculative cliqueB to hianlpu
'ate the market by "short" selling at
the expense of "the public" and to
take advantage of "unfavorable news"
in order to depress prices and "cover"
-t a pro PL "Short sale" speculators
are alleged to have been the "lot"
eneficinries. The attorney elicited
'e information that it was the prac
tice of brokers with the consent of
their customers, to loan stocks bought
"n margin to other brokers, who in
turn used them for "short sales"
tranactions. Thus, It was alleged, the
stock of the customers who hoped to
profit by a rising market could be
come a weapon in the hands of the
"short sale" speculator, who hopes
for a falling market.
"That is," pursued Mr. Whipple,
"man may furnish the petard on
which he is hoist." v
"That is possible," Mr. Streit con
ceded. Mr. Streit defended "short", selling
as a necessary requisite to a "free
iiswket." and said that experience in
Germany and France had shown it
was inadvisable for economic reasons
to dispense wi'h it. He conceded,
however, that if "short" selling should
be aliolislicd there would not be so
tiiueii speculation.
"The short sale, then." remarked
Mr. Whipple, "is the foundation .of
speculation ?"
"I would not say that," Mr. Streit
replied. "I meant that there would
not be such a volume of speculation,
and, incidentally, the speculative risk
would be greater."
ti Turning to Mr. Noble's personal
views of the ethics of the market, Mr.
Whipple inquired diligently in many
different forms if he consideied
"short sale operations designed to ac
centuate unfavorable news in order
to depress prices and take profits
were immoral." The witness finally
conceded he saw no impropriety in
these operations, hut in resuming the
stand at his own request later in-the
day, amended his answer. He said In
had misunderstood the tenor of Mr.
Whipple's question and explained
that he did not approve of a "concert
ed action of conspiracy to depress the
market artificially."

Prof. Hertzog Praises
This Perfect Laxative
DR. CALDWELL'S SYRUP PEPSIN '
AN IDEAL REMEDY FOR
CONSTIPATION.
In every family there is more or less
occasion l'jr a laxative remery. It is
to meet this need that Dr. Caldwell's
Syrup Tepsin is prepared, and that
this combination of simple laxative
herbs with pepsin fulfills its purpose
is proven by its place in thousands of
American homes.
Prof. F. J. C. Hertzog, the well known
linguist, 2341 North Orianna St., Phila
delphia, Pa., wrote to Dr. Caldwell that '
he has used Dr. Caldwell's Syrup Pep
sin in bis household with excellent re
sults and that he and his family con
sider it indeed a friend in need, and al
ways keep a bottle of it on hand.
Constipation is the direct cause of
much serious illness and is a condition
that'should never be neglected. Harsh
cathartics and violent purgatives
should never be employed to relieve
constipation, because the very violence
of their action shocks the entire sys
tem. A mild laxathe, such as Dr.
Caldwell's Syrup Pepsin is far prefer
able, being mild and gentle in its ac
tion, without griping or other pain or
discomfort; its Irecdom from all
opiate or narcotic drugs makes it an
Ideal remedy for children.

WILSON'S PROPOSAL.
Like many of the utterances of President Wilson, his
latest suggestion of a plan for future world peace rings
with true nobility and contains thoughts which some day
may be incorporated into a working instrument to ac
complish the end sought. But that he offers even a fair
ly complete solution of a problem which has proved an
enigma to the wisest minds of all ages may not be
granted readily.
It is impossible to get away from the human equation
in dealing with world peace. If all rulers of all nations
were now and hereafter absolutely righteous men. free
from selfish motives and therefore prepared to act with
unchallenged fairness in international dealings, they
would eagerly subscribe to the Wiison program and uni
versal peace would indeed be possible of attainment.
The definite concert of power proposed by President
Wilson as assurance against a repetition of the catas
trophe of war assumes that the high character and
temper of the rulers of those nations entering into the
concert will be definite; that t.'iey will be men born
again and not subject to the human frailities which at
the present day continue to beset humanity. In the
event of occasion arising to exercise concerted power,
there would be the need of unanimity of opinion. Now.
Fresident Wilson lays down as an essential of his plan
the following dictum:
"I am proposing that the nations should with one ac
cord adopt the doctrine of President Monroe as the doc
trine of the world; that no nation should seek to extend
its policy over any other nation or people, but that every
people should be left free to determine its own policy.
Us own way of development unhindered, unthreatened,
unafraid, the little along with the great and powerful.'
This, as above, is a succint definition of the Monroe
Doctrine to which the United States alone subscribes
without reservation'. Other nations .have and .do today
challenge this doctrine. .In other words they differ in
opinion with President Wilson on a matter which he
makes fundamental to the accomplishment of his uni
versal peace plan. So if other nations continue to deny
the undisputed virtue of the doctrine, how much nearer
are we to the international millennium which President '
Wilson seeks with a thoughtfulness and . earnestness
that no man may successfully attack.
Further, President Wilson says: :
'I am proposing that all nations henceforth avoid cn
tangling alliances which would draw them into competi
tions of power, catch tlicm in a net of intrigue and sel
fish rivalry, and disturb their own affairs witli influouee
intruded from without."
President Wilson therefore beseeches the rult-rs of
nations to divorce those human weaknesses which make
for intrigue and self rivalry. But can they or will they?
We fail to believe that President Wilson's pronounce
ment is more than an inspiring sermon delivered to the
world. It is an exhortation to the rulers of nations to
conduct themselves in a manner consistent wij.li honor
and righteousness. If the, desired effect is secured; If
rulers are brought to see their transgressions of the
past, much good will have been accomplished. Other
wise, this universal peace plan contains few workable
suggestions which will be adopted and enforced I y the
nations at large.
cratic nominee having been defeated by about CO votes
by his republican opponent, Campbell. Hunt ran many
votes behind his ticket, but while the margin of defeat
was close the democrats stood for the returns savin?
they could not afford, even while they held the balance
of power in the state legislature, to go behind the re
turns. There are legislatures that would have acted
differently. And it was this same spirit that decided
the men at the New Cornelia mine to stand for law and
order and an honest presentation of things. I. W. W.
agitators came in and finally started a strike, but they
couldn't hold the men when the latter discovered the
true condition of things, nor cculd they get them to
commit an overt act, or to threaten the management of
the company in any way. On the other hand they re
sented the suggestion. These agitators are still in that
section but so far as New Cornelia is concerned they
have utterly failed in the accomp'lishment of their ob
ject, and they may meet with trouble should they de
cide to continue with their labor-wrecking game. Ari
zona is for cleanliness in all lines and stands well in the
list of states that are for law and order and an honest
presentation of things."
IMFOSING ON LABOR.
Another arch impostor, pleading at last for protection
from the law which he sought to flout in order to be
saved from the victims he had duped, has been driven
out of Arizona. The case of Strike Organizer Kd. Crouch
is similar to that of Kd. Connelly, who was driven out
of Miami by organized labor, and other destructive agi
tators whose dealings with labor were inspired bolely
by greed. Crouch, fearing an attack from his dupes,
iled from Ajo alter cujoyiug the championship of

OPERA AND CLOTHES.
The Christian Science Monitor remarks that most peo
ple who care for opera would like to see it become
"less of a social function and more of a musical occa
sion." There's n question about it. And if the dress-clothe3
I element were eliminated, great numbers of people would
care for opera who now never give it a thought.
We are not an unmusical nation. The patronage of
good concerts everywhere shows that. And there's no
reason in the nature of American life and character
why the highest form of music, which is opera, shouldn't
be as popular here as in Germany, Italy or Laiin
America. Popularity and appreciation of opera are retarded in
this country by two things the high price of admission,
and the sartorial standard established by American so
ciety folk. The price -could be reduced by employing
good American singers instead of paying enormous
salaries to foreigners with more reputation but no men:
talent. The clothes problem is probably more difficult
all matters of social usage are hard to reform. . But
that difficulty will be got over in time.
It is possible, suggests the Monitor, that in a few
years our opera may get away from its "false basis".
The community singing that is now becoming so popular
is a wholesome influence working against the notion
that fine music in a public place is necessarily associated
with decollete gowns and long-tailed coats.
SPOTTING MARRIED MEN.
Says a New Jersey motber-irt-law: "You can tell a
married man every time. They show where the harness
has rubbed."
Getting down to details, she mentions these interest
ing marks or stigmata by which any observing person
may pick out a man of matrimonial experience:
He is "an artisiic flatterer about things wives like to
he lied to about." Praising coffee, for instance, and tell
ing a woman how pretty she is when she knows she
isn't. Also praising a woman's taste, whether it's good
or bad.
He is considerate around the house, in a way that no
bachelor is. He doesn't throw his clothes on the floor
nor leave things cluttered up behind him at least, if
he's been properly married. Countless little tilings show
to the discriminating eye that the male brute has been
housebroke.
Tears, too, K'U the tale. The man-who's-never-been-married
gets excited about a woman's tears. They break
hint all up. The experienced husband, says this author
ity, takes them as a matter of course. In the particular
case that furnished her with a text, she found that
"tears rolled off that man's feelings like water off
duck."
They're valuable facts to know, especially for young
ladies to whom unknown men are paying attention, and
to newly wedded wives ignorant of their spouses' pasts.
And on the whole, they're rather creditable to- matri
mony as an institution. Marriage can't be so bad when
it "polishes a man up for domestic use" so that he never
gets over it."
UNION BALL-PLAYERS.
It needn't have surprised anybody that the Bast-hail
Players' Fraternity should ask for a charter from tin;
American Federation of Labor. Kverybodyjs doing it.
Why bother about such absurd questions as whether a
ballplayer plays or works, and whether the great na
tional game is a sport, a profession or an industry?
School teachers are joining the Federation of Labor.
The actors are joing it. The musicians joined it long
ago. Even the authors seeui to be determined to join.
The old distinction between wage and salary, trade
and profession, are breaking down. It seems established
that anybody who works for a living is a workman, be
his toil manual, pedal, mental, vocal or facial. And
everybody has a right to enlist the aid of all other
workers, in all callings, to defend him from the tyranny
and rapacity of the employing interests.
Maybe even the employers will join the Federation of
Labor alter a while. They may argue that they, too.
work lor a living and need to ally themselves with the
other workers for mutual protection.
Their proximity to the sea and all its dangers has in
duced a large num!er of Germans in Chicago to ask of

TRiM LEGISLATIVE
BILLS OF SPECIAL
SESSIOHMUST GOME
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Jan. 23 What leg-
j islation there shall be during the re
mainder of this session of congress
rests largely with the Senate Demo
cratic caucus which has been called
to meet Thursday night to consider a
j tentative program framed by the
steering committee. That it will be
j impossible to get through with all
pending legislation of importance the
steering committee has conceded. It
will propose, however, that an effort
be made to get action on railroad la
bor legislation, a corrupt practices
act, the Webb bill to permit collect
ive foreign selling agencies, a flood
control measure, the mineral land
conservation bill and a few other bills
These recommendations Ignore water
power conservation measures so long
in dispute, the Porto Rican citizen
ship bill, and various other measures
in which many senators are interest
ed. Administration leaders admit that
the program may be changed as it is
certain to provoke opposition in the
caucus. Many senators fear that It
will be impossible to complete either
railroad legislation or a corrupt prac
tices bill before March 4.
Senator Newlands tonight called a
meeting of the commerce committee
tomorrow a coin to take up railroad
legislation, including the bill to for
bid a strike or lockout pending inves
tigation. This bill was disapproved by the
committee more than a week ago. but
an effort probably will be made to
morrow to reverse that decision.
Members of the committee do not
believe a bill compelling an investi
gation of a controversy but not for
bidding strikes or, lockouts will be
satisfactory to President Wilson but
are understood to be without infor
mation as to how he will accept. The
committee will not be able to take up I
the Webb bill tomorrow. Many mem
rers favor its principles but are anx
ious to have it framed so that by al
lowing combinations of American can
cerns for foreign business, infrlnge
mentind violation of the anti-trust
laws in domestic business will not be
permitted.

i (Ey Review Leased Wire)
I AJO, Jan. 23. Asking and receiv

fearing an attack from angry Mexi
cans whom he was deserting. Strike
Organizer Ed Couch left Saturday for
an undisclosed destination. His lieu
tenants. Miller and Marrin, stole out
yesterday. Financial Secretary That
cher remains, declaring he has been
made the goat and must raise eight
hundred dollars to square the indebt
edness left by Crouch as the head ol
the strike organizations. Board bills
are included.
Thatcher expressed bitterness
against the men he termed deserters.
The attitude Vf the Mexicans has
been sullen for some days, and they
have threatened mob violence if
Crouch does not make good on sundry
impossible promises.
Crouch, it was admitted today, had
nothing for weeks upon which to base
a hope of winning the strike. His last
semblance of supi.Vrt went on Tues
day when the structural steel men de
cided to heed reneated orders from
'their headquarters and went to work
despite their district representative
working with Crouch.
'After that Crouch was in need of
escape from the men, both Annrican
and. Mexican, whom he is said to have
deceived all along and became des
perate. Some contributions are still
coming in from outside lat'jr locals
and individuals unwise to the real sit
uation here. Thatcher presumably will
remain to receive these and to appeal
lor help to the state federation to lift
the local indebtedness. The strike
leader may have got away with con
siderable surplus, although the strike
was a failure from the beginning.
Since Thursday the Cornelia company
has had full crews in all crafts and
has turned applicants away. Over a
thousand men were on the payrolls
yesterday. The official calling off of
the strike authorized today by the
local organizations gives to all card
men in the union additional right to
work for Cornelia and declare the lat
ter's standing as a fair shop.
President Farrell of United Stales
Steel Corporation estimates that not.
more than 25 percent of last year's
steel exports was for use in manufac

says, will show that shipments of

amounted to more than 6,000,000 tons,
practically double exports of any pre

morning at the county jail. Dehrin
ger stated that he had been warned by
his attorney, J. L. B. Alexander, not
to talk to anyone.
"Do you admit that the dictograph
was set up in your room?" he was
asked.
"I admit nothing but the 'fact t'..at
I am in rather uncomfortable quarters
at present and that I h'jpe soon to be
free, and then perhaps I may say
something of interest," he replied am
biguously. "If you did have a dictograph in
your room would it have been there
merely for the purpose of overhearing
a conversation regarding spur tracks
and corporation hearings?"
"Would Col. Ro'jsevclt have led his
Rough Riders up San Juan merely for
the purpose of getting a better view
of the sunset, or did Doc Cook brave
the frigid clime in search of the north
pole because he wanted the exercise?"
Behringer replied evasively, and then
refused to discuss anything but the
weather and the high cost of living.
He did, however, admit that he
came from El Paso, had lived in sev
eral cities in New MexicV), and denied
that he was in the employ of any de
tective agency or other mining com
pany. He said he merely came to
Phoenix on a business trip but ne
glected to explain on just what kind
of business. A reporter sought to re
mind him of the fact, and Behringer
immediately changed the subject by
remarking that "the price of liquor,
meats and Hour was mighty high in
the west."
President Armstrong and Attorney
William P. Maloney, counsel for the
Ray Hercules company, were holding
a conference in Armstrong's suite of
rooms with General Manager C. E.
Adams yesterday afternoon. The room
becoming too warm, one of the occu
pants started to open the transom and
discovered a fine wire running down
the cioor jam. Tracing the course of
the wire, they found a dictograph re
ceiving instrument under a bed. More
clever sleuth work followed and they
soon learned that the other end of the
wire led to room 404, adjoining the
room they were holding the conference
in. Efforts to arouse the occupant by
knocking on the door failed, and the
three men""alled the proprietor, who
opened the door with a pass key. Ju.-t
as they entered someone made a
hasty exit from 406, and rushing out
info the hall they saw Behringer
walking down the hall with two heavy
suit rases, the contents of which later
revealed a dictograph outfit.
Much against his will, Behringer
was detained until County Attorney I
M. Laney was located, who, upon be
ing informed of the circumstances. Is
sued a warranr for Behringer's arrest.
He was taken before Justice DeSoua,
who placed the bail at $1500, which
Behringer was unable to produce, au 1
he was locked up in the county jail.
Behringer immediately engaged the
services 'of Attorney Alexander, wVi
telegraphed friends in El Paso. He ex
pects to receive the required amou it
before evening.
Annsti'jng and Maloney claim that
they are at a loss to know why an;
one would desire to have their con
versation registered, claiming that
they had met to discuss the matter of
going before the corporation r)miii!s
sion in regard to compelling the rail
road to build a spur track to their
mining property. The hearing w::s
scheduled for next Monday.
An effort was made this morning to
persuade Behringer to talk, but he
answered all questions evasively. He
appears to be a young man 'of not
more than twenty-five years of age,
well dressed and well educated.
A. I.. Behringer was arraigned he
fore Judge DeSouza this forenoon an 1
his examination set for 2 o'clocK Fri
day afternoon. He was released from
the county jail after he funjis'ied $!.
Mm rash bail, sent him by El Pa.-o
friends.
F. C. Armstrong, president of II. e
Ray Hercules Copper ionipany, n;ts
offered a $100 reward for information
that will lead to the arrest and con
viction of the party or parties impli
cated in the offense charge 1 against
Behringer. The company is said to
be of the belief that ltehringer is cm
ployed as a private detective to gain

The effect or President Wilsons
policy on the status of the .Monroe
Doctrine is discussed w ith equal inter
ests. Several British publicists, nota
bly I.. J. Maxe, editor of the National
Ueiew. suggested recently that
Great Britain is entitled to a weighty
toice in any international movement
in t lie American hemisphere because
of the growing importance of Canada
as one of the foremost .nations of that
hemisphere.
The voice of the "silent masses"
upon the war was heard in the labor
party conference at Manchester today
whin it endorsed the action of the
labor members of Parliament who en
teied the war cabinet. Most of the
small substratum ol sentiment favor
ing a conciliatory policy toward the
Central Kmpires is to be found in la
bor unionists aud a small group of in
tellectuals. "Selling Allies Out"

in fillers which can only concern
the I'nited States when the time
comes for a settlement of the basis
of international peace. The extreme
opinion, which in fairness must be
stated, is that the President is selling
the allied countries to Germany. Great

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, JANUARY 24. 1917.
j Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. Jan. 2?.. Excessive
dullness was the only striking feature
of today's session. sales barely
amounting to 40.000 shares, the
. smallest of any full day since last
August. Of this total, more than for
ty percent represented the operations
of the first hour, the market thereaf
ter drifting idly with general heavi
ness at the end.
Developments in the so-called
leak investigation with tlie scene
shifted to this city, excited little in
terest. Far more attention was di
rected toward the meeting of Betlile
hem Steel board, the result of which
was not announced until long after
the close of the session.
Bethlehem Steel meanwhile fluctu
ated between 450 and 460, closing at
the latter quotation with a net loss
of a point while the preferred gained
five points. On the curb the new
Bethlehem Stock opened on the usual
"when issued" basis at 140 bid, 200
asked, but sold down to 133 later.
The decision of Bethlehem direct
ors to declare the increased rate of
dividend and the 2"0 percent stock
bonus was in line with general ex
pectations, although the non-voting
clause attaching to the new stock
caused some surprise.
Changes in other quarters of the
list were so irregular in the main as
to have no real significance.
Hails remained sluggish with few
quotations in standard issues.
Russian and Italian exchanges es
tablished new- low records, with indi
cations of liquidation in lires which
fell to 7.13. while rubles yielded to
28.35. Bonds were irregular with to
tal sales, par value, $4,060,000.
U. S. Bonds were nnchanged on
call.

a lack of any foreign demand except
from Holland led to lower prices for

Bearish sentiment regarding wheat Miam consolidated 2S

business opened. Much notice, was . y Hercules 4Ji
taken of assertions that fresiaeni
Wilson's speech apparently opened
the door anew to peace negotiations.
At the same time a decided absence
of foreign buying was evident.
Aggressive selling by houses with
eastern connections took place as the
close of the wheat market drew near
and as the effect of crop damage fears
seemed on the wane. Corn was rela
tively firm owing to reports that 75
percent of the Argentine crop had re
ceived irreparable damage. Besides
receipts of corn here were meagre,
and rural offerings small. Oats re
flected the downturns in wheat.
Highest quotations of the session In
the hog market lifted provisions.. .
(By L. J. Overlock)
NEW YORK. Jan. 23 Today's ses
sion was a rather uninteresting affair
with interests in the financial district
willing to digest the contents of Pres
ident Wilson's address witli a view of
prognosticating its effect on the im
mediate session. There is a wide di
vergence of opinion as to the proba
ble effect that it will have on some
of the belligerent countries and until
the attitude of European officialdom
towards the president's remarks is
more clearly defined the security mar
kets will probably be extremely ner
vous. Everything considered e
think it the part of wisdom to exer
cise caution on the long side.

belligerent nations would find a way
to comment formally on the situation.
Early press comment from Europe
was viewed by the administration
with the utmost Interest and that of
the French papers, which are particu
larly more general, more appreciative
and sympathetic than had been ex
pected. The French comment was con
strued as meaning that France fully
understood the President's motives
even while dubious of the immediate
practicability of his proposals. The
English press comment was disap
pointing at first glance as officials felt
there had been an undue criticism of
President Wilson himself instead of
serious study of his address.

the brawn and brain of man must
work hard to overcome physical obsta

eminent geologist and paleontologist.
Dr. Walcott sketched the life and
work of Majpr John V. r'owell and
Dr. F. V. Kayden in exploring ana
making known through writing and
publication the wonders of the great
West during the early 70's, noiing
especially the Grand Canyon explora
tion by Powell and the Yellowstone
Park expiration by Hayden.
No one is better schooled in the
lessons of hide-and-seek which Daiue
Nature plays with scientists in her
teachings than Dr. 'Walcott, wuo has
scaled some of the highest peaks and
descended the deepest canyons oi tbe
country in search of a lost geologic
formation 'or a rare fossil specimen.
Ip this connection Dr. Walcott point
ed out the value of our National
Parks as a scientilic a.set, citing .some
ot his personal experiences, lie stated
that scieniiiic explorers long ago be
gan to search tor tae "vuys" anu
"wherefores" in the Ytlfjwsione, tiie

Rockies, the Cascades, and the loresis
of great trees on our Pacilic Coast.

tracts v. as gamed but slow! ; eventu

waat Nature had preserved lor them
and they soon demanded that me

"Within these 4arKs scientific re
searches will be conducted tor genera-

".Men of science and research will be
