Warrant Against 200 Men
I. W. W. BENESIS OF LOCAL
MINE STRIKE IS PROVED
This Is the Only Noticeable
Result of Hearings So Far;
Next Move of County Atty.
. Is Watched With Interest
(Special to The review.)
DOUGLAS, Sept. 6 Tomorrow aft
ernoon's session of court here will
open what Is expected to prove the
closing week In the joint preliminary
hearing of the 200 Douglas and Bisbee
citizens charged with kidnapping for
the parts they are alleged to have
taken in the deportations of July 12,
1S17. -
It" was reported today lhat the
county attorney had but fourteen
more witnesses to call for. the state
and. at tbo rate of examination es
tablished during the two weeks that
the hearing has already been In prog
ress, these should complete their tes
timony by Thursday or Friday. It is
not believed that any witnesses will
be introduced by the defense in the
cases now under way. As soon as
the joint hearing is finished several
other individual cases will be called
including those of Harry C. Wheeler,
who, as sheriff of Cochise county, di
rected the deportations, and John J.
Bowen, prominent- auto dealer and
county highway commissioner of Bis
bee. Interect Centers In Wheeler.
Wheeler"?, hearing Is v expected to
prove one of the most interesting held
so far, as he' has repeatedly stated
that he considered hiinserf personally
responsible for the deportations and
actions of the citizens deputized on
July 12. 3917.
What the next move of the county
Attorney and the individuals who are
so vigorously urging the prosecutions
will bo after the hearings of all the
men already under bond are complet
ed i not known. The county attor
ney has stated in court during the de
portation hearings thai ?ie had the
names and evidence aeainst many
more citizens charged with participat
ing in the deportations, but it is not
known whether or not any further
complaints will be'filed until at least
some of the cases already completed
have been tried in . the superior
court.
Disappoints on Sensational Side.
So far. the big preliminary hearing
has proved a disappointment to spec
tators who have 'attended the sessions
during the last two weeks.' Predic
tions that the blanket warrant crises
would hrlncr out sensational testi
mony from witnesses for the state
have failed to come true, for the ma
jority of testimony offered . by the
county attorney's witnesses hs been
almost identical with the first 49
cases bound over to the superior
court for trial last month upon their
own reciiefct . '
Men Net In District Accused.
Foiti the number of cases dismiss
ed for lack of evidence, it would ap
pear that the men who are bo eager
to see the prosecutions pressed, filed
information against every man whom
they remembered to have seen on
July 12. J&17. And several men were
arrested who were not even in the
Wan-en district on the day of the de
portations. . Several of the state's
witnesses have testified to their be
lief that there were only two classes
of people in the entire district during
the deportations: those who were be
ing deported and those who were as
sisting in deporting them. They re
fused to admit it possible that any
man who was not aeported did not
take part In the deportations.

JOINT
EN T BLOOD
AFTER BREAKIfOPEN SAFE 0000
, Safe crackers, apparently lacking the necessary explosives
and forced to resort to crude tactics, but nevertheless leaving
evidence of their expertness a3 yeggmen, broke into the John
Treu Market in Brewery Gulchat some time between mid
night and 1 o'clock this morning and made off with approxi
mately $2000 in coin and currency, after breaking off the
heavy door of the safe and smashing open the cash register.
, Entrance was made through a rear window, the robbers
apparently leaving the same way.
The robbery was discovered by Officer C. P. Thomas, spe
cial merchant policeman, in making his regular rounds at 1
o'clock this morning. While trying doors in the alley at the rear
of the establishment, his attention was attracted to the brok
en window through which the safe crackers apparently made
entrance.
The lock on the door of the safe was neatly broken off, ap
parently with a sledge hammer. There were no evidences of
any 'soup' having been used. On the floor in front of the safe
were lying a complete burglar's 'kit,' besides several small
axes and cold chisels. This together with the fact that the
light had been left burning by the intruders leads to the belief
that the yeggmen were suddenly frightened off by the ap
proach of Officr Thomas. Vor-."' - . '
The heavy cash register had been carried from behind the
counter to the center of the floor, where it was smashed open
and emptied.
Officer Thomas immediately notified the police, who in turn
notified Mr. Treu. At 3 o'clock this morning, after a hasty in
ventory, the proprietor and his bookkeeper estimated the loss
at about $2000, though it maybe more.
Larg stains of blood were found on the door of the safe,
and blood spot led frm the safe to ;the window and -'from tho
alley down Brewery Gulch. It is believed one of the yeggmen
Gseverd'an artry in braking open the safe door.
Chief of Police Al Kempton inspected the scene of the
crime at 3 o'clock this morning! Posses of police were in
specting all rooming houses and stopping all automobiles and
belated pedestrians at that hour in the hope of finding a clue
to the yeggmen.
DELEGATES AID
WILSON STAND
UPON IRELAND
Walsh and Dunne Submit to
Senate Report of Discussion
In Which President Said to
Have Refused Peace Meet Aid
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. While
private negotiations proceeded today
between senators favoring "strong"
or "mild" reservations to the German
peace treaty, the foreign relations
committee received a report of a spir
ited discussion of the Irish question
at Paris last June between President
Wilson and Frank P. Walsh, and form
er Governor. Dunne, of Illinois, who
sought to secure a hearing before
the peace conference for the Irish
nationalists.
The report was transmitted by the
Irish'' national bureau, supplementing
recent committee' hearings. It said
Mr. Wilson declined to use his in
fluence to get a hearine for the Iris
representatives, declaring that Messrs
waish and Dunne, by intemperate
speeches in Ireland, had made it im
posible. ' Treaties in existence, the president
was also reported as having declared,
impeded his; efforts to . procure self
determination for subject peoples.
No meeting of the committee was
held today, the memorandum, made
by Walsh and Dunne after their con
ference with the president being sub
mitted informally, and there was -little
discussion of the treaty in the
senate, Senator Norris, Republican,
Nebraska, making the only address.
He called attention to the statement
of the president in his St. Louis
speech that Japan's secret treaties
with the allies were made to induce
her to enter the war. The Nebraska
senator said the treaties were made
two years later.
The group of Republican senators
advocating "mild" reservations con
ferred during the day and were said
to have agreed to oppose the commit
tee reservations, particularly that re
lating to article ten of the league of
nations covenant.
The Irish memorandum, described
as notes on the conference between
President Wilson and Messrs. Walsh
and Dunne made by the latter after.

responsible for the -attack on Ameri

when two American officers and 13
men were killed and 23 wounded. Dr.
Altendorf said that the Mexicana Who
made the attack Were short of ammuni

through the renegade, who, he claimed
smuggled $165,000 worth across 'the
border prior to the attack. ;
"Villa smuggles over 60 per cent
of his munitions Dr. Altendorf Bald.
"If that part of his supplies were .cut
off. he would be 1 forced out of busi

on the 40 per cent he buys from Car

and as they in common with other
banditti down there must now also
depend entirely upon smuggling for
supplies, doesn't the whole Mexican
situation create a somewhat erabar

same manufacturers and dealers?
The renegade American mentioned
by Dr. Altendorf, was said by him to
be an agent of Mexican Consul Garza
at Brownsville, Texas, and also to be
a confidential envoy of Carranza while
at one time he acted for von Eck

Mexico City, who was involved in the
scheme for an attack on the United
States.
Dr. Altendorf .said that there was
one big drug store in Brownsville
which received shipments of ammuni

another dodge resorted by the smug
glers was to conceal ammuntion in
watermelons so as to get it past the
customs officials. "Usually," he said,
"it doesn't seem worth while to take
so much trouble for there are such
long stretches of unguarded territory
that nothing much but laziness need
drive a smuggler to take such risks."

declared that in March of the present

one sided affair, however, according

CHARLESTON. W. Va .
C. F. Keeny, president of the United
Mine Workers of America of district
No. 17, in a telephone conversation
with Governor Cornwell, tonight
stated that the 1,500 miners encamp
ed at Danville would call off the invasion-
of Logan county and would re
turn to their homes on a special train
tomorrow. Keeny left Charleston at
noon in an automobile in an effort to
deter the miners from proceeding
further, after a conference with Gov
ernor Cornwell.
Following this information from
President Keeny, Governor Cornwell
said that he would not ask that fed
eral troops be called out. At the con
ference today the governor informed
Keeny that he had been in communi
cation with Secretary of War Baker
and MaJ. Gen. Leonard Wood, com
mander of the central department:
that he could get federal troops to
Logan before the arrival of the min
ers, and he warned that the marchers
would proceed at their own peril.
(If the miners decide to proceed
further it is probable federal troops
will be called out.
It was learned tonight that another
party of men has been proceeding into
Logan county by way of Cabin creek
and is now said to be about 12 miles
southeast of Madison in Boon county.
Efforts are beine made hv the mine-
workers officials to stop further pro
cedure of this crowd. At the end of
their's day's march, which covered
about 25 miles, the miners, unaccus
tomed to hiking, were weary and foot
sore. Many were carrying their shoes
and trudging along barefooted. They
carried their rifles on their shoulders,
while piovisioas were transported in
wagons.
PICKANINNIES;
On Board President Wilson's Spec-,
ial Train, Sept. 6. Several hundred
persons met the presidential special
at St. Joseph, Mo., where the train
stopped for three minutes.
The crowd swarmed around the ob
servation end of the president's car
and called for a speech, but acting
on the advise of Dr. Grayson, he re
frained from making one, and ex
changed friendly greetings.
A group ot women Red Cross work
ers got the president and Mrs. Wil
son to sign their roster, and Mr. Wil
son was presented with a basket of
roses.
After the train left the station it
had to stop in the railroad yards to
take on water for the engine and the
president shook hands with a number
of railroad yardmen.
Shakes Grimy Hands'
With their grimy hands they show
ed some hesitation, but the president
smilingly urged them to come for
ward and he gave each a hearty clasp.
Many children, wlilte and negroes,
were on hand, and were lifted up to
the rail so the president could shake
them by the hand also.
The president seemed to enjoy par
ticularly a tiny black picaninny and
its mammy, , who. fighting a way
through the crowd, got within reach
of the rail. fHello little one." he said,
taking hold of a chubby hand, "I am
glad to see you."
Bouquet For Mrs. Wilson
Another youngster struggled up
and presented Mrs. Wilson with a
bunch of sweet peas. Her face
wreathed in smiles, .Mrs. Wilson ex
presed her appreciation.
One of the movie men accompany
ing the presidential party got an un
expected chance for a "close-up" of
the president when Secretary Tumul
ty helped boost him over the rail to
the platform. After training his
camera on the crowd, the operator
turned and got a good picture of the
president as he stood chatting.
"Here, stop that," Mr. Wilson said
good naturedly, "you mustn't do that
behind a man's back." He then came
over and patted the movie operator
on the back.

orations were most in evidence. Onj

he would ask for two regiments ot
federal troops.
The original force was estimated at
500 men, but recruits were enlisted
all along the route, and tonight Presi
dent Keeny estimated the army to be
of an approximate strength of 1 500
men.
A force of men was gathered at
Montgomery, but dispersed after a
talk by Dave Ware, a district
official of the organization. He told
them of the governor's promise to se
that armed guards' were removed rrom
the Logan Helds if they existed there
and of his promise "to see that thw
men were granted "their constitution

"I have been in this office two and

world to this state until this scheme
popped into someone's brain and they
started putting it into operation. It

going to sift this, matter through and

war isn't over and the peato treaty

several statutes which deal severely
with agitators and perpetrators of
such outrages upon the dignity of this
state."
The miners left Oak Grove this
morning on their march across the

talked over points in his speeches

He said he was satisfied with the

U. S. Carload of Bacon Arrived
Last Night From El Paso,
Will Be Delivered Monday:
City Also to Sell Clothes
The city of Bisbee may soon go
into the clothing business to supple
ment its food handling in the high
cost of living fight Uncle Sam Is
waging.
Postmaster Bailey yesterday re
ceived word from the supply officei
at El Paso, that a large quantity of
men's underclothing was available foi
sale. The garments are to be sold
in 1.000 lots to the highest bidder.
The proposition has been put to
Mapor Jacob Erickson and it was said
yesterday that there was a possibility
that the city would put in a bid ii
enough orders coald be secured to
warrant such action.
, The 'undergarments available are
described as follows:
'Eight thousand four hundred and
twenty-two pairs drawers, summer,
cotton; sizes, 30 to 44; majority are
sizes 30 to 32, and 34. S. F. D. No.
1961 CE.
' Thirty-one thousand two hundred
and fen pairs drawers, winter; ap
proximately 23,000 garments are cot
ton and 8,000 wool.; sizes 28 to 46;
majority are sizes 32, 36 and 38. S.
F. D. No. 1962 CE.
Forty-five thousand one hundred
and eighty-nine undershirts, winter;
approximately 34,000 gaiments are
cotton and 11,000 wool; sizes 34 to
46; majority are sizes 36, 38, 40, and
42. S .F. D. 1963 CE.
Twelve thousand seven hundred and
ninety undershirts, summer, cotton;
sizes 32 to 46; majority are sizes
30, 38, and 40. S. F. D. No. 1964 CE.
Word1 was received yesterday by the
mayor that there are no blankets
available for Bisbee so that any resi
dents of the district who have ordered
these will be disappointed.
More favorable news was Teceived
in that the long awaited carload of
bacon, the larger part of which has
been ordered and paid for, had been
sent from El Paso.
This carload of foodstuffs arrived
late last night and will be distributcV
at 11 o'clock Monday morning. To
gether with the bacon the following
goods will be at the public's service:
Three cases corned beef hash; 110
cases corned beef; 45 cases peas.
The bacon order for those who have
receipts, reads: Ten cartons bacon;
350 cases bacon.
W. J. Wilbert, the old standby on
the city grocery business, said last
night that there will bo some Jjacon
left over for those who are not for
tunate enough to hold previous orders.
KIDNAP HEARING .
TO END IN WEEK
(Continued trom Page One)
during cross-examination of the
state's witnesses showing the aggra
vated conditions caused by the I. W.
W. in the Warren district. Any doubts
as to whether or not the I. W. W.
alone was responsible for the strike
that led to the deportations have
been completely dispelled by the tes
timony of many members of the I. W.
W. who have appeared as witnesses
against tho defendants.
Prosecution Aid vo aerense.
The3e witnesses testified to assist
ing the I. W. W. solely for the strike
and others have declared that they
tore up their union cards because
the Western Federation of Miners
denounced the I. W. W. action in call
ing the strike at the time when the
nation was in such dire need of cop
per with which to manufacture war
materials. Other testimony has
shown how boarding houses and res
taurants that were being operated in
sympathy with tho I. W. W.: refused
to serve food to any men who re
fused to obey the I. W. W. orders to
Quit work during the strike.
No witnesses have been introduced
by the defendants themselves in any
effort to show how crrtical conditions
wore in the Warren district during
the I. W. W. reign, but plenty of such
testimony has been given by the
state'3 own witnesses during the
cross-exa mi nation.

includes great quantities of opium.
The drug, according to the former
government agent, comes to the wet
coast of Mexico ia Japanese vessels,
and thence finds its) way across coun
try to the border. One smuggler re
Dorted by Dr. Altendorf was captured
outside Nogales with 4,500 pounds of!
opium in an automobile truck.
"Morphine and cocaine," he contin
ued, "are also " smuggled extensively.
The Germans paid special attention to
smuggling drugs into Kelly, field, the

ing the war, the idea being to break
down the American flying force,, but
It didn't work."

- By WILLIAM HOSTER.
IS the Christianity of today the
same as that of a century ago?
Fundamentally, yes; in its ex
pression and application, no.
In what condition has religion
emerged from the melting pot of the
world war ? Is there a meeting point
between the Church and the militant
civilization' of the twentieth cen
tury T Has the Church kept abreast
of the times?
In these post war days of unrest
and uncertainty, when society is not
quite sure which road to travel, has
the Church assumed the leadership it
is 1 granted it should take ? Is the
Church appreciative of the responsi
bilities and obligations of the hour?
These and questions of like import
irise to the lips , of every thoughtful
nan who views the successive religi
ous movements which have been in
augurated reoentlv, and which are
tvpifiod hv, the Episcopal Nation
Wide Cr- rTn. of which the Every
Name C?ri"ss in the Diocese of.New
?Yorkis ;ts Metropolitan handmaiden.
The fullness of time only can give
the definite answers. Meanwhile, an
iarrnv of significant facts ist piling
un for the consideration of the close
-server of the times. .
Unquestionably, all of these move
ments are the outgrowth of efforts
n the part of the churches to meet
the changed conditions which hav
resulted from the war. It is agreed
that we have entered uoon a new era
In the world's history with new
duties, new responsibilities, n revised
view-point and a clearer idea than
"even before of man's dependence
iipon his fellow-man without regnrd '
to religion or race, color orrlass dis
tinction. '
Religion Must Be Practical.
"In the new era which is upon us.,
writes George Gordon Battle, a Nw
:York lawyer who has entered with
fervor into the Every Name Cam
. paign, "relieion.-to he effective, will
have to shape itself to ' meet the
want of mankind as a whole. It
must recognize human conditions.,
needs, aspirations, weakness. ' It .
must he practical. It must be effici
ent. It must cease to bedazzle the
mind with metaphysical doctrines,
creeds, theories and dotrmas, and get
down to common level."
In what spirit the Episconnl
Church has launched its Nation
Wide Campaign of which this is a
lay interpretation, a general idea is
obtained from the official statement
that it is "A campaign inaugurated
by the Board of Missions at its .
meeting in December. 1918, and
finally approved bv the Executive
Committee in April, 1919. to bring
the compelling facts of the Churrh's 1
whole responsibility at home and
abroad to the attention of every
member of the Church. In pursuit of
this plan, every agency of the
Church, for the first time in its his
tory, is nnited in a fixed, definite pur
posethe Board of Missions, the
Genera) Doard of Religious Educa- ,

Charles W. Harshman, pastor.
Order of the Holy Cross, the Brother
hood of St. Andrew, and the Church
Periodical Club. A nation-wide cam
paign of education is to be conducted
in which is involved a personal call
upon every member of the Church
throughout the United States, in the
effort to "inform, the mind and
awaken the conscience" of the
church-goer as to the duties and re
sponsibilities of members of the
Episcopal Faith in the new era.
And what is of peculiar interest
and importance, there will be taken
simultaneously a survey of the re
sources of the Church and it3 insti
tutions in every part of the world,
their wants and their needs to the
end that when the Triennial General .
Convention of the Church meets at
Detroit in October there will be be

comprehensive picture of the entire
church establishment.
. Statesmanship Needed.
With this in hand, it is then
planned to, map out a program of
Church activity for the ensuing three
years which shall meet the spirit of
the new age and comport with the
standing of the Episcopal Church as
a National institution. Finally, a
budget system will be submitted,
and with the Reconstruction program
in hand, and a practical, business
like method of putting it into execu
tion formulated, the reawakened,
united and solidified Church will go
before the nation for co-operation
and support in its drive for national
service. ; '
It is a . movement that calls for
statesmanship of the highest order
Within the corporate bodyi of the
Episcopal Church are all of the con
fiicting elements which represent the
seethini? life of America today. Gov
erned by a body of laws closely con
forming to the Constitution of the
United State's, the utmost libertv of
thought and speech are permitted
consonant with - adherence to the
fundamental religious doctrines of
the Church; and a mass of conflict
ing views will have to be reconciled
in shaping a general program for
action upon which the Triennial Con
vention can agree to go before the
country.
It is clearly evident that the con
vention will be asked to take cogmV.
ance of the relations between capital
and labor, and if the Peace Treaty
has net been adopted befcre the con
vention assembles it will undoubted
ly be called upon to define an atti
tude toward the League of Nations.
The Saloon Substitute.
All the complex social problems
growing out of the war will demand
attention: and it is equally certain,
since one of the Episcopal Church's
great and successful activities is in
connection with the education of the
negro race, that the negro problem
will press for discussion, as will the
cuestions of the rural church, of sub
stitutes for the saloon and of the
congested population in the hi
cities.
The first stage of the campaign is
now under way, under the direction
of a National Organization, the Hon
orary Chairman of which is the fit.

Church Suffrage.
How is the Church reacting to this
drive? One of the most interesting
reflexes is the tremendous interest
which the laymen of the Church have
taken in the movement. In this de
tail, the diocese of New York, with
its Every Name Campaign, has set
the pace for the rest of the nation,
and there one of the first fruits of
the reawakening is a movement
which has been inaugurated with
great promise of success to admit
women to active participation in
church affairs, even to the extent cf
making them members of church
vestries and delegates to the dioresan
end general conventions.
Along the same lines, the activ
ties of the laymen have met with
such encouragement from the clergy
as to lend color to the belief that in

Aside from this, the noteworthy

is a progressive spirit onv the part

ENTERS ON NOVEL CrrEER
Mark Gregovich, formerly a member
of our boys' department, who recently
returned to the district after spend

navy, left Wednesday night for San

INTERESTING PROSPECTING TRIP
A'.onzo Crittenden and H. H. Corpe
returned Wednesday night from a trip
in the Patagonia and Santa Rita
mountains overland by auto. The
Santa Rita district is the oldest min
?ng district of the Pacific slope in
the United States. The Jesuit Mis
sionaries coming north from Mexico
were the pioneers in mining and civ
ilization. The town of Tubac on the
S. P. Fv. R., which they founded about
1687, Is the oldest town in Arizona.
They also founded the mission of
Tumacacori close by. They went
first to Patagonia, a well situated and
picuresque mining town, and from
there by the countrv road to th
Alto postoffice, from where they had
10 pacK as tne road ended. Their
route tooV them through the hitnn!i
Baca land grant 100,000 acres. This
i rum an appearances 13 a rich mineral
section, but companies will not come
in, fearing litigaton. A number of
striking outcrops of veins were seen
from the auto. Particularly the giant
outcrop of the Montezuma, striking
across the country in bold and up
starding manner. The Salero and Al
to mines were passed on the road,
once busy places bu- now silent and
empty like Goldsmith's Deserted Vil
lage. The Baca land grant has a ro
mantic Dd desperate past. The first
surveyors sent out were all killed off
by Indians and its entire history has
been turbulent. The an(a Tata nn1
Patagonia mountains are undoubtedly
a good mining district. The two great
est mines are the 3 R and the Flux.
The latter mine was not visited on
this trip, but according to all local
opinion (those in position to know), it
is a magnificent smeltin? nronnsitinn

TENNIS CHALLENGE RECEIVED
The tenpis tournament of the Y. M.

tennis in Bisbee in popularizing this
fino and healthful sport. On account
of the tournament, a challenge, from
Ft. Huachuca has recently came in.

movement which he heads, "that
workingmen and women alike are en
titled to safe and healthful surround
ings in their employment, to fair
working hours and a wage justly
proportioned to the profits derived
from their labor, adequate recrea
tion, proper housing and stimulating
uplifting amusements." and until
these conditions are met, he declared
it is hardly worth while looking for
a great spiritual reaction among the
workers. The efficient religion, he
said, is one which ministers to man's
material as well as his spiritual '
needs.
Former Attorney General Wicker

like declaration in support of the
Every Name Campaign, and William
C. Breed, another well known lawyer,
asserted that "the developing ten

men to regard religion as an essen

all incompatible with work-a-Jay af
fairs, is one of the reflexes or the
world war to which the Church as an
organized institution for human bet

i tention." He, too, declared for a
practical church in which the new
spirit of democracy predominated.

FIDGET OVER TREATY DELAY SAYS
BISBEE SERGEANT; MORALE LOW
The following interesting letter
from his nephew, Sam Wilner, who is
with the ?rmy service corps In France,
was received yesterday Dy H. S. Hill
man of Bisbee:
is-Sur-Tille, Fiance, Aug. 17. 1919.
Dear Uncle Well here it is getting
on 10 the shady side or August and
1 am as close to the States as i was
luot. December, r.ud abouc all that 1
know at the present time as to going
home is thai we will have to wait un
til the treaty is ratified, before the
prisoners will be turned loose. To
say that wx are all jteartily sick of
Franco and the army doesn't begin
to say it and our morale at the pres
ent time is not anything. Here of
lata the prisoners have been giving us j
a great deal of trouble in the way of I
escapes and we are keeping a pretty
careful watch on thm. We are lo
cated at the present time at what is
known as the Advance Repatriation
Point, and there are in the neighbor
hood of twenty thousand prisoners
here in three large barb-wire enclosed
stockades and though w are primar
ily supposed to be awaiting the re
patriation of these prisoners they are
being usuG for labor purposes about
the camp. i
There is really nothing of any in
terest about here, it's just the same
old thing day in and day out, and
the almost sickening monatony of
watching the' prisoners going to and
from work and the dull drab camp,
It's enough to make any one want to
take a drink.it I have been promoted
to a sergeant since I last wrote you,
auci 1 might add that 1 am not In the
infantry and consequently our pay is
much lusher, for instance a sergeant
in the infantry gets $44 a month over
here, wh'lo I get $51.20 and that
changed into francs rnaxes what the
Frenchman says "beaucoup francs."

I can saj that I have seen quite a
good bit, and wiil tell you all about it
when I return. I had my little camera
with me and took a few snaps which
I am sending you.
I suppose you -would like to know
how I spent some of my spare time
this past winter and spring, so I am
going to tell you about it. First of
all lasr winter and early in the spring
I taught school at the post where we
were fetation ed. There was a sort of
en educational wave spread over the
A.. E. I last winter after hostilities
ceased and the entire army was sent
to school. A more commendable idea
was rever conceived and I had the
honor of being seiecteff to teach
mathematics at our post school. I
had o.uite a. class and thougn the
work was interesting it was anything
dui easy. The fellows were with
very few exceptions pi-etty bright and
I think we all made quite a bit of
headway, f took the advantage of
taking a correspondence coarse in
business law and accountancy and 1
suppose that I did as well as any one
could, considering.
Well, Uncle, there is really nothing
more that I can wrice at the present
time, and at, I have not heard from
you in quite a while I can't ask any
thing of Bisbee at the present time.
Why don't you write a bit more fre-
quftiitly? I know that you are busy
and that you haven't a great deal of
time to spare, but. you can surely
iind time once in even a . great
while to pen me a few lines. How
is business at the present time and
what kind of a season are you having
with the drinks, and last but not
least how i3 the Gulch stand making
out now? All good, I sincerely hope,
i I wish it were possible to buy what
the government las over here in the
various army warehouses. There
arc all sorts of staples in can goods
and cigars, both imported Havanas
and domestics. They are sold to us
at a ridiculously low price and in
comparison with what these goods
are selling for in the States now, it
(i3 almost charity. Camels, for in
stance, at about 72 cents a carton,
Princo Albert at 7 cents a can.
White Owls at $1 a box of 25 and so
o:i Quite different from what it is
in the States, isn't it? Well Uncle, I
suppose I will have to close now for
the present, so with the . kindest of
regards to- all of the boys and your
self, I am..
Your nephew.

FATHEf-T'J ESTATE
GOES T'j CHILDREN.
PHOENIX, Sept. 6. Lillian' E:ns
tine Davis,-15, and Donald Davis, ,11,
will share the $8,500 estate of Frank
Ernest Davis, who accidentally shot
himself August 16 while packing his
belongings with the intention of mov
ing with his motherless children to
Spokane.
The will of the dead man was ad
mitted to probate by Judge Lyman
yesterday. It was a simple document
drawn the day- before he died in which
he left his life insurance, cash and
personal property to his son and
daughter. He named J. E. Horn as
executor and Mrs. Lillie Morgan as
guardian.
After the death of Mrs. Davis last
spring Mrs. Morgan occupied the po
sition of housekeeper in the Davis
home. A few weeks ago Davis de
cided to move to Washington -with his
family and while packing his trunk
came across a revolver which he pro
ceeded to unload. IV was while he
was unloading the weapon that it ex
ploded with fatal result.
I A GAME FOR GRA8. '
, New York World.
I The extent to which profiteering
; has been carried on among retail deal
; ors is scandalous. It is not a case of
a few individual tradesmen' yielding
to the temptation to charge excessive
prices.- The abuse has been wide
spread, and consumers' protests over
the counter have been without effect.
A mad desire to get rich quick by
making the most of the high cost of
living seems to have seized many
' small storekeepers and robbed them
of even an ordinary sense of caution.
; Any pretext or no pretext has been a
1 good reason for juggling prices of the
necessaries of life. It has been a
i game, of grab, with all rules off.

NBV-VORLD KNIGHTS
STRONG PEACE ARMY
K-C Growth Forms Effective
Barrier to Bolshevism and
Other Evils.
One of the reasons why the Knights
f Colnmbus were able to render such
raluable service to the men In the unl
form of the United States army, nrivy
and marines was that back of the K. of
Q. and the public support they received
was a thriving fraternal organization,
growing rapidly In all parts of the
North American continent 'William J.
MeGtnley of New "York, Supreme Sec
retary of the K. of C, In his'annunl
report to the Supreme Convention of
the K. of C, shows that the Knl;;hts
bave' had a magnificent organization

K. of C. Secretary, Who Plays Leading
Role In Great Peace Work.
with which to put into effect their vari
ous movements for the benefit of the
nation's defenders.
The K. of C. membership is now well
on the way to the 000,000 mark, and by
the end of the year, at the present rate
of growth, It is estimated the Knights
will number approximately one million.
More than 120,000 new members
were added to the K. of C. in the past
twelve months. A feature of this won
derful growth of the organization has
been tha steady increase In member
ship from the ranks of the U. S. Army
and Navy. The K. of C. made it a rigid
rule that no attempt be made on the
part -of their war workers to in any
way recruit members among the mil
lions of army and navy men enter
tained and served by the' Knights. But
tliousnnds of service men have sought
to Join the organization.
The finnnces of the Knights of Co
lumbus, Secretary McGinley's report
shows, are in an exceptionally flourish
ing condition. The present assets of
the K. of C, exclusive, of course, of
the special, war funds, are over $8,
500,000. The .influenza epidemic cost
the Knights the past year in payments
to beneficiaries of insurance members
$1,149,000. The total death benefits paid
during the year amounted to $2,175,
304.08, making a total of $13,123,040.70
since the, beginning of the order. The
total insurance In force this year in the
K. of C. amounts to $101,353,505.33.
There were 5,076 deaths in the or
ganization during the year of which
3,150 were members who had insur
ance in the order. Despite this, how
ever, there wa3 a gross . increase In
membership of 121.S9L Over 81,000
associate members joined the Knighta
during the year. Every insurance com
missioner ha3 pronounced the K. of C.
in exceptionally strong organization.
The Knights, with this vast increase
In membership, are turning their en
tire energies toward solving the prob
lems of peace after having met with
conspicuous success in aiding the na
tion during the war. The full mem
bership of the Knights is pledged to
fight Bolshevism and all expressions of
extreme radicalism. The Knights, will
also carry an offensive warfare against
economic disorders by putting Into ef
fect a nation-wide educational program
0"n immense chain of free night
schools. The 2,000 K-C councils that
are serving as employment bureaus
for returned fighting men will form the
K-C supplementary school units.
! NATIONAL EDUCATION

Loading educators of the United
States are conferring in New York
this week upon the plan of the Knights
of. Columbus to Inaugurate a untion-

tures of the great peace task of the
organization. The courses proposed
I are for the 000,000 members of the
Knights of Columbus and others rot
members of the organization who wish
to take advantage of the free instruc
tion. A system of night schools will

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS.
NEW "VORK, Sept. 6. Trading on
the stock exchange during today's
brief session was obviously restricted
by the uncertainties resulting from
labor conditions, especially as applied
to the steel industry.
. United S-.ates steel, which had
shown signs of strength prior to the
publication of the Gompers message
to President Wilson, was under inter
mittent pressure, showing an extreme
decline of almost two points. Allied
shares were firm at the outset but
yielded 1 to 3 points later with ser
oral of the more popular equipments.
motors aid rails.
Aside from Studebaker, the motor
division was firm to strong with oils,
and miscellaneous issues registered
little change. Salea amounted to
375,000 shares.
General news of the day Included
the weekly reviews of the mercantile
agencies which stressed the . more
acute industrial situation and the pub
lication cf several railroad statements
of earnings for July. Most notable
among the latter ws the Union Pa
cific report showing a heavy decrease
in net.
The mo3t interesting feature of the
bank statement was the heavy expan
sion of actual loans, attributable both
to the week's greater activity in the
stock market and September first
withdrawals.
. Trading in bonds was light, but with
a better iodc especially in investment
rails. Liberty issues and several of
the internationals eased lightly.
Total sales, par value, aggregated
$5,350,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call during the
week.
WEEKLY REVIEW.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6. Business on
tha stock exchange this week hinged
almost exclusively on the industrial
situation. The firm stand taken by
the admi-iistration in connection with
the railroF.d brotherhoods was offset
iu a measure by the ultimatum of the
steel workers tb the United States
steel corpora tion.1
Banking and general financial con
ditions yielded none of their recent
stability, aside from recurrent weak
ness in the foreign exchange market
Sterling forfeited "much of its recent
recovery with French and Italian re
mittances at new low records.
The foreign exchange situation
continues to engage the attention of
leading economists in the financial
district and there is reason to believe
that steps soon will ie taken by the
French government to rectify existing
conditions. London bankers, however,
holding aloof.
Much of the week's activity and ex
citement in the stock market was
furnished by several speculative is
sues, noiab.'y Crucible Steel and Bald
win locomotive. .
The rise and subsequent decline of
the former seemed to have its origin
in the operations of an aggressive
short interest, but the strength of
equipments and oils probably had its
basis on sound business conditions.
This found expression in the high
er rates of dividends declared br the
American Car and Foundry company.
American woolen and Mexican and
Pan-American petroleums. In the
money market, the only noteworthy
change was the" lower rates for call
loans,
wmcn dropped from .their
kc56cu quotation or six per cent to
live and even four nd one-half, hut
time funds held firm on the smaller
supply at six and one-half per cent.
WEEKLY BANK CLEARINGS.
NEW YORK, Sept. 6. The actual
conc;ition of clearing house banks and
trust conipr.mes for the week (five
days), shows that they hold $32,026,
200 reserve in excess of legal re
quirements' This- is a decrease of
$1,010,270 from last week.
THE GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 6. Uncertainty as
to tne cnaracter or the government
crop report to be issued on Monday
had a tendency to make the corn
mirket today unstable. Fluctuations,
however, although irregular and nu
merous, were not wide. The close was
icivuus, varying irom cent net
lower to 2 cents advance with
tember $1.64 to $1.64 and December
1.J1 o 1.31T8- Oats finished
3-8 to 5 8 higher and provisions at 22
cents decline to a rise of $1.75.
Notwit'irumding that privafe re
ports have suggested but little change
In the corp outlook during August,
traders on both sides of the corn mar
ket were disposed to avord any chance
ol a surprise in the government's
new figures. Besides, sentiment was
much mixed a3 to whether corn would
go further in an approacn to pi e war
levels unless accompanied to a great
er extent by other commodities than
lias beer, the caso of la.. nulls took
the position that the answer would
depend chiefly on the farmers and
would be ir the negative. On the
other ha'Jd. the fact That sterling ex
change today had fallen to a new low
record exercised at times a noticeable
contrary influence.
Improved demand fro.m eastern
shippers gave relative firmness to
oats. Frcr!')ns averaged higher i
owing more or less to packers buying, j

'Tanlac Is a Perfectly Wonder
fully Medicine Says Mrs. "
Josephine Freeman
Mrs. Josephine Freeman of 647
Towne avenue, Los Angeles, Calif., a
graduate nurse who had practiced her
profession for seventeen years, re
cently made the remarkable state
ment that she has not only been re
lieved of a case of stomach trouble
of ten years standing by the use of
Tanlac, but that she had also gained
twenty-tko pounds in weight.
When asked if she would be willing
for her experience with Tanlac to be
published, Mrs. Freeman said:
"Yes indeed, I feel that I would be
doing anyone suffering from stomach"
trouble and a rundown condition a
good turn by getting them to take
Tanlac. For ten years I have Been
having trouble with my stomach. I
could not eat anything without suffer
ing intense pains afterwards, and at
times I would bloat up so with gas
and such pains and pressure around
my heart that I would almoBt faint.
I became so nervous that I could
hardly get any sleep or rest and got
so run down and weak that I could
scarcely keep up my work as a nurse.
I, of course1, used all kinds of medi
cines and did everything possible but
could never get more than Just a lit
tle temporary Telief.
"Finally a friend of my husban.
who had been relieved of the same
trouble by taking Tanlac, advised him
tq ' have me try it and right from
the' first bottle I began to feel better.
My appetite came back, my blood cir
culation improved wonderfully, and
my nerves began to quiet down. 1
can eat just anything I want now ane
never have the least pain or trouble
afterwards. - I sleep soundly every
night and, I feel rested and refreshed
on getting up in the mornings. When
I began, taking Tanlac I was weighmt
only one hundred and thirty pounds
and was. still losing. But now I tip
the scales at one hundred and fifty
two, making an actual gain of twen
ty-two pounds on four bottles of Tan
lac. I ujst feel so strong and well
now that it's a real pleasure for me
to recommend the medicine that help
ed me so much. Tanlac is a perfectly
wonderful medicine and I am glad to
give 1 credit where it belongs."

NEW SCHOOL COURSES ADOPTED
Of STATE RESULT LARGELY OF
WORKDFGDCHiSE EDUCATORS
Extensive changes In the courses of
study in Arizona high schools and
junior high schools have been adopt
ed by the state board of education.
They will go into effect at the start
of the new fall term.
To Cochise county educators goes
a large share of the credit for the
new minimum requirement, appropri
ate electlves and suggested special
course" lists. The committee which
reported them to the board at the
meeting in Phoenix Thursday con
sisted of C. F. Philbrook, warren dis
trict superintendent of schools; Elsie
Toles, Cochise county superintendent,
and H. E. Matthews, superintendent
of Mesa schools.
Junior high school work, covering
grades from the seventh to ninth, in
clusive, is especially recognized In the
report.
The committee Teport with new
courses of study which was adopted
as a whole by the board follows:
Members of the, Board of Education,
State of Arizona.
Gentlemen:
In compliance with your authoriza
tion and direction, we, the following
members of the committee appointed
to revise and redraft a course of
Btudy for the high schools of Ari
zona which should contain the mini
mum requirements, appropriate elec
tlves and suggested special courses.
herewith beg to submit for your ap
proval our final report.
Your committee .has not been un
mindful of the- size of the task with
which it has been entrusted, nor has
it forgotten that the courses- of study
in modern high schools are in healthy
process of development and transi
tion, not only in our own country, but
throughout the world. We have rec
ognized also the difficulty involved
in formulating the mlmimum require
ments of a course of study which will
meet satisfactorily the conditions ob
taining in the various sections of Ar
izona. Numbers of suggestions have
been received, and we have been di
rected by what seems to be the con
sensus of opinion among the school
men of the state.
We have seen fit to recognize the
development of the so-called junior
high school. Although under the
laws of Arizona there does not seem
to be any authority for the organiza
tion of this type of school, yet your
committee feels there is sufficient au
thority vested in the board of educa
tion of the Btate of Arizona to per
mit the organization and stimulate
the development of the junior high
school in those communities where
this type of school may be voluntar
ily organized. We think that the ef
ficiency and economy which can be
effected thereby will more than Jus
tify the enlarged activities of this
body in such support. Consequently,
our recommendations cover the work
In the seventh,, eighth' ninth," tenth,
eleventh and twelfth grades, or what
Is known as the -junior and senior
high schools."

In the selection of. the material!
which will constitute the jninimum
requirementsifl'the course of study
for the high school students, your
committee was actuated by what it
considered really essential ia the de
velopment of the most valuable facul
ties of the boys and girls of high
school age. Realizing (helifficulty in
drawing a hard and fast line between
subject matter which should be re
quired and that which should be lettt'
as electives, we have attempted to i
stress those subjects which will en
dow our boys and girls with a founda
tion whereby they may obtain all
the sources of intelligent, independ
ent livlihood, and which will inspire
them .also to become a part of our ac
tive, responsible and intelligent citi
zenship. We feel that from our high
schools no greater contribution to
ward the future of our. nation can
be expected. ,
Your committee has not had the
opportunity to confer directly with
the officials of the Normal school and
the State University. Consequently
we are not in a position to recom
mend or even to suggest that these
proposed minimum Requirements for
the high schools of! Arizona should
be identical with orj govern the en
trance to these Institutions. .How
ever, we do feel that, in view of the
rerecent development of the several
courses organized under the Smith
Hughes act, it is the province of the
state board of education to use its
offices to the end that more liberal
entrance requirements may be ob
tained for . the ' students graduating
from these courses in our high schools
who may desire to continue their
education in our advanced institu
tions. -

This store feels that it has made a long stride toward good service in many directions Standardized Values, a liberal merchandising policy, an
intelligent sales force, plenty of light and fresh air. But we place none of these above the single item of protection of our customers' time and
money. A store is no store at all that only barters its merchandise for money, conducting its business in a drab, impersonal way. That cort
of store has passed into the limbo of forgotten things. SERVICE is our trademark. '

Incidentally, the matching , of
Loughrey and Chambers again for the

boxiug cIud in local arena. Sheriff
Jamej McDonald, one of Loughrey's
admirers, who believes that the
Philadelphia "bearcat" can whip
Chambers the next yme they meet
and who has been endeavoring for
some time to get Loughrey another
chance at iho First ca:varyman, has

Lou.?trey and Chambers met at
the Warrea parks three weeks ago in
one df the best ten-round bouts ever
seen in the arren district. Referee
Jack McDonald or Taso, gave
Chambers the decision. Loughrey
ar.d his friends have been seeking, a
return match ever -.ce and Lough
rey has offered to fight the cavalry

with a good side bet.
Loughrey and Sheriff McDonald
will go te- Douglas tomorrow to sign

detail3 of the match. Chambers has
expressed a willingness to fight
i evinced iu a return match s-.ween
j Loughrey and Chambers there will be
'a record-breaking attendance.
Williams of Douglas, probably will
I be the rtveree. He has been the third
man in the ring at all the recent
tights put on at the Enlisted Men's
club at Douglas and his decisions
have been giving universal satisfac

the maiu event and Hughes and
Myers In the preliminaries the card
will prove & winner. Hughes knock
ed out Red Vaughn in the second
round of their fight two weeks ago
and Myers disposed of Kid Lavine in

Ducky Rhodes may be picked to op
posa Myers, while Kid Conte, Koob
or Ochoa are. being discussed to bat

CONTRACT SENT
Harry Jennings yesterday received
a letter from his cousin Hughey Jen
nings, manager of the Detroit Tigers,
enclosing a contract for Ed Scoct, the
first baseman of the Bisbee baseball
team. Scott was "lamped" by G. J.
Kelly, scout for the Detroit time ago,
as big league material, and he will be
given a chance with the Tigers next
season, reporting for spring training
at their southern camp. Scott is a
full blooded Indian. He appears to be
a natural ball, player, long and ransry,
and had held down the initial sack for
Bisbee with brilliancy. His hitting
has improved greatly in recent games.
Hughey Jennings invited his cousin,
Harry Jennings, back to a big family
reunion at the yorld series in case De
troit annexes the American league
pennant this year.
Yesterday's business at the Muni
cipal market in Lowell was tho most

ket opened two weeks ago. A larger
number of farmers came in with their
j.roduoe and here wt greater var
iety of fruits and vegetables offered.
Patronage was brisk throughout the
. day, with the greatest rush in the
morning hours. A noticeable reduc
i tlon jn prices has been made by the
establishment of the- municipal mar-
I ket, of which the shoppers of the dis
trict have been quick to take advan
tage. Many of the women from
Tombstone Canyon and Warren came
in their autmobiles with baskets on
their arms and personally supervised
their shopping expeditions. Every
class was represented at the market,
down to the little , Mexican family
with a burro or an express wagon to
haul, their purchases away.
STERN CURE FOR OVERSTORAGE
New York World.
Whether food has been stored in
excess of requirements is a matter
of cold arithmetic. There seems to
be evidence that It has been. In ad
dition to the regular warehouses, the
1 firemen report that breweries and
other buildings not so used hitherto
j have been pressed into service. ' If
overstorage has been resorted to for
! purposes of price-fixing, there is a
stern cure that can be applied in mit
igation of the cost of living.

TO STATEMENTS
DF SUPERVISORS
In response to the board of super

differences with State Engineer
Thorna3 Madrtok in the expenditure
of the 75 per cent state fund, the
following statement was published
yestnrday in the Tombstone Pros
pector by the Tombstone Commercial
company and the Farvaanx Commer
cial tomyany: ' ;
.Having noticed in your paper that
the board of supervisors in their at
tack upon the state engineer, brought
in the question of cost of supplies
for the slate camp We feel in jus
tice to all involved, to answer their
wrons statement by 'saying that we
were awarded the conirac: tor sup
plies after our competitive bids were
accepted iainst all other bidders.
We are sorry that the present board
fa ignorant of the advance in prices
during , the past two j rurs.
If tho difierence i tse cost of
building the line highway from Ben
son crossing to Fair bank from Mr.
Maddock's guess of S20.000 to about
??7,000 was attributable to nothing
but the cost of supplies, we would
not bother to answer the letter pub
lished by the board of sunervlsnrs
We think and believe as everybody
in cocnite county knows that the
work was done under the most aA.
verse circumstances due to the heavy
storms that were continually hamper
ing tho workers and nianing so much

construction of the highway.

IR HERO ILL
ADDRESS BISBEE
LUNCHEON CLUB
Capt C. Zauei Lesher of the 76th
Co., Sixth marines, Second division,
will upeak before the Luncheon club
on Thursday, Sept. 11. Captain
Lesher was in the famous Second di
vision which claims so many of the
records of America's part in the war,
the division which suffered the
greatest casualties.
Captain Lesher's own company
had only 25 out of 250 of its original
members left. 'He has three Croix
de Guerre 'citations, a Fouragiere, a
diploma from Pershing and various
oilier honors. He was in France and
Germany from Septenmer, 1917, to
August, 191 E. and was In the battles
of Belleau Woods, the Marne, San
Mihiel, Mont Blanc and the Argonne.
Captain Lesher was a graduate of
the University of Arizona ana at the
beginning of the war was one, of the
three students selected by the univer
sity to enter the marine corps with a
commisison direct from his college
military work. He enlisted in the
marines in April, 1917. He, wears two
wound stripes.
It's only a coincidence, of course,
but the defeat of the hitherto un
beaten Norwegian tennis star, Molla
Bjurstedt by some of the new lights
in the feminine world of racket and
net is followed by the announcement
of the marriage of the late champion

Happenings of a Week
From Texas Oil Fields
OPTIMISM REPLACES PESSIMISM CONGESTION AT
TEXAS GLOBE OIL
AND GAS GO. IS
IK BI5E OIL STOCKHOLDERS
At the beginning of the oil excite
ment Bfsbee was in a receptive mood
and quickly developed a frame of
' mind where oil was the all obsorbing
tuple." The game was new to most
Bisbeeana and the conceptions and'
ideas foimed at that time as to what
might be expected were bound to be
over optimistic, at least in regard to
the length of time that must pass be
fore it 'was reasonable to look for re
sults. Money and time are both re
quired to develop the, best properties
and to put any company on a paying
basis. The money was given freely
but most people were Impatient and
expected quick action.
. Not being properly prepared for
even a comparatively short wait to
pee what, was to com from invest
ments, there came a -time when, the
public in some degree lost confidence
In the ultimate results and there fol-
lowed a period when oil did not look
.as 'golden as It was painted.
Recent local development in the
Burkburnett, Desdemona,' Ocean and
Itanger fields have revived the lag
ging interest and once more Bisbee is
a "live" oil town.
Hundreds of Bisbeeans are now
expecting dividends in short time or
liave held onto their stocks long
enough to see them rise to a pleasing
figure in view of the progre&s made
upon the wells in which they have
bought an interest.
Km nines are nof. a day:
the person investing in an oil proposi
tion must do so with the idea that a
wait is necessary. Sometimes it is
longer than others, but quick returns
are not possible. It takes time to
make contracts and time to drill, and
there are unaccountable delays in al
most every drilling proposition.
But things are taking on a rosier
hue for stockholders, and the pessi
mism of a few weeks ago has given
away to optimism. Heretofore it has
all been going out, but the near fu
ture promises to see a lot coming
back.-
Encouraging Signs.
The El Paso-Burkburnett Oil Com
pany has reported most encouraging
results from its operations in the
Burkburnett field and as soon as the
congested conditions now existing are
relieved, the company will be in a
position to turn into the pipe lines.
The Big Four along with the Silver
Cycle, is subject to the same delays
that all Burkburnett companies are
contending with. Pipe line facilities
are being rushed and in a short time
the available oil will be turned into
real money to the benefit of these
companies and their stockholders.
In the Ranger field Ocean and
Ranger Central are making progress
and before many days, it is anticipat
ed that there will be sensational re
ports from these properties.
The Pullman Oil & Refining com
pany has been most fortunate in its
choice of holdings in the Desdemona
pool and reports as given on the first
well on the Desdemona townsite in
dicate that when completed it will be
one of the larger wells of the field.
This news has been expected in all
confidence since the bringing in of
the big Reilly well, located some 150
feet from the Pullman. The Pullman
company is in good shape to take
care of its production, as large stor
age was provided and pipe line con
nections made. The company has-no
problem as to drill sites owing to it$
good fortune in having 61 close in
acres in the Desdemona fiejd- The
company is now drilling its second
well.
OIL FIELDS ADD
,S.
100
WEALTH
According to-Roscoe Ady, publkut
man of the Ft. Worth chamber of
commerce, in the Texas Bankers'
Journal for July, $150,000,000 a year
is the value of the oil yield of the
north central Texas oil fields and
that is 70 per cent more than the to
tal value of ihe gold produced in a
year in the entire United States, in
cluding Alaska.
In less than 20 months vast amounts
of Capital have come into the oil
business in north, central and west
Texas, Mr. Ady says, and more than
1000,000,000 has been spent on leases
alone. He puts the number of wells
drilling or producing at 1800 and the
production at 180,000 barrels daily'.
He claims that geologists predict this
production will be doubled within a
year. During the first quarter of
1919 the dry holes were only 12 per
cent of the completions and the aver
age initial flow per well of the pro
ducers was 416 barrels.
Mr. Ady claims that only 10 per
cent of the production was brought in
by the small rompanies the other 90
being the work of the big concerns.
OIL IS STRUCK
EAN WELL
V EASTLAND, - Tex., - Sept. 6. The
Ocean Oil and Refining company"s
Brooks No. 1 well has drilled three
feet into the first pay on top of the
black lime and is making about 1800
barrels of oil . from a depth of 3330
feet. ';
The drillers finished setting the
casing and started drilling on Wed
nesday morning. At 4 o'clock the
well started flowing with strong gas
prossure.a. nd by noon all thestorage
tanks were filled and the 'well shut
in to wait the pipe line pumpers tp
take care of the oil. I?
The oil is 42 gravity paraffin base,
the highest gravity oil yet found in
the field. The well has about 200
feet to go and will be completed in
about. 10 days; through the black lime
to the pay. sand.
Those - draft dodgers - who , didn't
want to face German bullets in 1917

BURK BELIEVED
EL PASO September 6. "The
congested condition of the Burk
burnett oil field Is gradually be
coLi'.n.t n .ieved and a steady routine
of devel-.ipni'iiits is taking ,tiic plac?
of the spectacular and uncertain con
ditions of the northwest pool," said
W. E. Arnold, who returned today
from several weeks' visit to the oil
fields.
"The edges of the field have been
practically defined with the exception
of the- north and west along the river
bank bordering the Oklahoma line."
Mr. Arnold stated that mere Is still
considerable speculation as to wheth
er the oil crosses the' river in Til
ing a county. The Burk-Fox well has
proven the field to almost the edge of
the witter.
-According to Mr. Arnoid an off-set
is being drilled to the holdings of the
Billie Burk Oil company property
which should determine the value of
this concern's holdings in the next few
ieek3.
"The Silver Cycle, in block 75, has
brought in a well which is estimated
at 2,U0C barrels and which has broken
loose and shot uver the derrick on
three or four occasions," Mr. Arnold
stated. "The well has a good location
and is the largest well brought in by
an El. Paso company in the northwest
poof.
"The Ranger-Burk Consolidated has
one well on the sand which should be
in next week and two drilling," Mr.
Arnold stated. "They have encoun
tered the usual difficulties growing
out of the congested conditions.
"The El Paso-Burkburnett and the
Big 4 also have two wells . which
should be in almost any day."
IN STATE
PHOENIX, Sept. 6. The final
chapter of the Texas Globe Oil and
Gas . company of pychic medium
fame was written here late Saturday
when the superior court handed down
an order permanently dissolving the
company and transferring all leases
and holdings to the newly organized
Texas World Oil and Gas company.
This action Dy the court was the
outcome of the investigation conduct
ed by the Arizona corporation com
mission in which sensational disclos
ures were made revealing methods of
high finance which would have put
Wallingford himself to shame. Thou
sands of dollars worth of stock were
sold all the way from 5 to 50 cents
a share under methods which were
branded as shady in the extreme.
One of the principal witnesses in
the original hearing was a psychic
medium who admitted that she had
assisted in the sale of stock by the
recital of a Btrange revelation, in
which it was made to appear that
she would accumulate untold wealth
through speculation. In this strange
vision the psychic was guided by the
advice of a departed spirit, who pointr
ed out a large gusher of oil which
turned to gold in her lap as it fell
to earth. The curiosity of many of
those who heard this weird tale 'from
the lips of the scholarly psychic was
naturally aroused and when they
asked for further particulars she re-
TOO MUCH OIL
AT DESDEMONA
DESDEMONA, Tex.. ; eptv. In
spite of all that can be done it seems
evident that the Desdemona pool is
about to produce more oil than can
be cared for. Piuelines are making
every effort to increase the capacity
of their lines so they can care for
the new production. It is almost im
poKsible to get any more storage
tanks to this field. There is immi
nent danger cf local over production,
due to the intensive drilling on small
sites that hitve been blocked up be
cause of the" great demand for them.
This will, of course, result in great,
wastes to the field.
The Desdemona field is one of the
greatest producing areas in the world
and the oil operators, pipe line offi
cials and railroad commissioners are
greatly concerned at the present out
look forthe pool. The proven area
covers 'about 3200 acres and, outside
of the area ' in every direction are
numerous wells producing from 50 to
400 barrels of oil daily.
This once small country town now
has a populaticn of 10,000 people and
is increasing fast.
Machinery is .being transported
from the railroad station to tha dif
ferent localities by trucks and wagons
at a very rapid rate, owing to the
few weeks of dry weather that have
kept the roads in condition.
With the exception of the 38 acres
which is restricted from drilling, the
townsite is practically covered with
derricks and rigs, and on account of
the large amount of gas in the air
there is great danger of fire.
It may develop that the Desdemona
pool within a short time will surpass
the Ranger district. The wells of
this district have a greater lasting
quality thai! those of the Ranger field.
It ia evident that the deep sand re
gions of this state will be making
large production for the next 20 years.
It is true, some wells which v have
come in in the Ranger field as large
producers have slowly dwindled down
until now they are producing but lit
tle, but on the other hand, some wells
in the deep sand territories have in
creased their production. Considering
the possibilities for additional pools
and extensive inside drilling on big
leases, it is easy to understand that
the oil fields of Texas are likely to
hold out for a number of years.

ILL REOPEN
INDEPENDENCE
WALKER MINE
PRESCOTT.. Sept. 6. The Victor
Mining company, through Mark Brad
ley, general manager, has closed a
deal for the Independence claim, near
alker, Amos Swigert selling. This
deal means that for the first time In
its history the property is to be op
erated on a large scale and with im
proved facilities, the original method
of handling its product being by an
arastra in the early 60's, when Its
surface ore were free milling.
Mr. Bradley states he has nearly
completed a two-mile long wagon
road from the Eureka to his camp
for hauling in a hoist, engine, com'
pressor and other equipment, when
large operations are to start.
The early day history of ' this par
ticular mine is interesting. Origin
ally it was located by a member ot
the Walker party, in about the year
1S65, to celebrate Independence day.
It paid from the grass roots until the
base ore condition was reached when
it was abandoned, no known method
in yiat far-away day beting known by
wnicn its values could be recovered.
W. A. Rowe held ownership for many
years and finally the seller acquired
the property. A depth of about 300
feet was reached and It Is due to
the attractive mineral showing deter
mined that Mr. Bradley has closed
the deal for his company. The old
shaft is being retimbered and the
property is again ready for action.
The values are copper, gold and sil
ver, and the reviving of this particu
lar property is causing favorable
comment as one of the most import
ant mining movements for that field
in many years.

CITIZENS OF BISBEE DEVELOPING
PROMISING MINING DISTRICT IN
' NEIGHBORHOOD OF DON LUIS
i
Down below Don Luis there Is
being developed what promises
to become one of the best group
of mines in . the Warren district.
Proporties now being worked and
which give every promise of be
coming big producers are the
Boas, the Night Hawk, the White
Tail Deer and the Wolverine.
Two years' of hard and often
discouraging work on the Boas
promise to bring an early reward
to the men who have backed thefr
judgment in the property. It is
controlled by a group of 18 men,
all residents of the Warren dis
trict. E. A. Tovrea is president,
Postmaster Lee R. Bailey, vice
president, and J. J. Bowen, secre
tary and treasurer.
Mr. Bailey is the practical min
ing man of the group and a visit
paid to the property Friday with
him disclosed the extensive andd
successful work that has beenx
done. M. J. Elsing, the Warrea
mining engineer, has become in
terested in the property and is
now directing operations.
The main shaft has just been
. sunk 100 feet to the 400 level.
The shaft was driven by J. A.
Roper in what is believed to be
record time, Mr. Roper complet
ing the 100 feet in 19 days. The
price of the contract was $25
a foot.
A drift from the 300-foot level
has struck a big body of rich cop
per ore, running ,as high as 40
per cent. From the 400-foot level
a drift will be run to cut under
this body. Some high-grade silica
ore, containing high values of sil
ver and gold, was struck on the
,300 level. Five cars of this were
shipped from one pocket.
While the extensive develop
ment work has been in progress,
considerable ore has been ship
ped to the Douglas smelter, and
shipments will be resumed at
once.
The Night Hawk, which adjoins
the Boas, also is showing up well.
These mines will add another big
producing district to the Warren
properties.
VERDE COMBINE
; LOOKING GOOD
, Verde Combination is apparently
right on the verge of making a mine.
The northwest drift on the 1080-foot
level is now all In ledge matter with
three or four feet of ore right in the
center. This ore is a quartz-schist
with chalcopyrite and white iron shot
through the mass. Experts estimate
that the copper content is around
four per cent.-, ;
This drift has been following the
ledge for some time and in the last
few days it has been widening ma
terially. This morning the walls were
ten feet apart. Superintendent Os
car Engelder, who is in charge dur
ing the absence of Manager Dave
Dave Morgan, immediately decided to
drift along both walls.
Onj the hanging wall the quartz
seems to predominate. Throughout

an exploration program is being pro

not as yet been assayed, rich values
are ' to be plainly discerned in the
samples.
The vela is a continuation of the
smaller of three ledges encountered
in the cross-cutting operations " from
the main shaft in the earlier period
of operations at the mine. It was
found about SO feet from the point
at which the second hole started
i nis noie is Demg run from a can
yon, across the mineralized zone, at
an angle of 60 degrees to determine
the extent and value of the entire
area:
Striking the ledge at this point has
confirmed the calculations of the
president. The dip of the veins and
thejr approximate location were as
certained before the work began, and
the first ledge was found within three
feet of the depth ' at which it was
figured the ore would be struck.
It Is anticipated that the second
ledge will be struck In the course ot
a few more feet. The hole has now
reached a depth of approximately
177 feet. Progress in the drilling is
rapid, each shaft averaging about 20
feet.
The second ledge," when found In
the cross-cutting operations, ' was
richer than the first, and consider.
ably larger. The third and largest
vein will not he found, short of 600
feet. This is the largest apd richest
of the three : known ledges though
It Is believed at least one othef big
ger body underlies the three that

Flotation Plant at
New Cornelia Co. Is
Ready for Working
AJO, Ariz., Sept. 6. Assistant Su
perintendent W. I. DuMoulin made
the announcement that the new ex
perimental flotation plant recently
completed by the New Cornelia Cop
per company, may be considered on
a regular operating basis today, the
preliminary try-outs having been
made the last few days.
This plant, which will greatly In
crease the New Cornelia production.
Is not to be considered an experiment
of the flotation process with this ore.
but for the purpose of ascertaining
the most economical grinding equip
ment.
, After this question has been thor
oughly worked out, which may re-
quire six months or a year, it is the
intention of the New Cornelia to put
up a flotation plant of much greater
capacity. - ;
"After all," said Vice president
Marshall at a church forum Sunday
night, "the problem of American life
must be solved by the Ten Command
ments." Tut, tut. brother. "Tell It
not in Cath; publish it not in the

drift being run to pick up this same
ore is almost dry.
Though the Combination Is not to
the point where it can be pronounced
with certainty a big new mine, it is
confidently believed that the ore. body
will widen and become richer with
every round of shots. For the next
few days the property will be watch
ed with breathless interest. The con
ditions are nothing less than ideal
for making ore.

late, unlamented German officialdom
all telling how it happened we may
yet get the facts regarding the Ger
man method of starting a big war.
'Arizona Globe Co.
Force Is Increased
The Arizona Copper company re
cently increased its force of miners
in order to hasten the development
of its fine property, 14 miles south
west of Globe. There is already up
wards of 50,000 tons of commercial
ore proven up on the property which
the company very conservatively es
timates to average better than 3 per
cent copper. The development work
planned and now being vigorously
prosecuted should add very largely
to the known ore tonnage. By ar

as the Arizona-Globe company builds

Consolidated Ariz.
Report for August
The Consolidated Arizona JSmelt-
ing company reports the following
concerning its operations for the
month of August, 1919.
From the Blue Bell and De Soto
mines of this company a total of
12,000 tons of ore was shipped to the
Humboldt reduction works; the con
centrator handled 8.450 tons of ma
terial, while the smelter proper treat
ed 7,000 tons of new metal bearing
ores and concentrates t. during . that
month..' In August the company ship
month. In August the company made
shipments of 650,000 pounds - of. the
copper in bullion to the eastern refin
eries, the mr joiity of which was de
rived from domestic material.
The railroad administration has
signed another contract with the Pull
man compny. The fact that this
would have been a good time to re
name some of the fancifully desig
nated cars seems to have been over
looked.
The famous Hassayampa district,
which has long been noted in Ari
zona mining history as one of 'the
producers of ores of mixed values,
is now coming to be recognized as a
possible silver-lead district.'1 Work
which has been going on at the Ruby
silver camp for the past several years,
under the management of A. C. Gil
more, is showing up some excellent
silver ore, which has just been cut
in the face of a drift tunnel being
run on the vein. This property is
on the north extension of the NC4
silver mine and bids fair to soon joia
the shipping class.
The NC4 property is soon to be
equipped with a complete hoisting
plant and sinking done on the famous
vein from which leasers of 1894 took
out their stakes. After depth is reach
ed crosscutting will be done to open
ore shoots believed to exist on three
big parallel veins lying in close jux
taposition to the famous old producer.
When the crosscutting is started a
compressor plant and air drills will
be put in, as the country rock be
tween veins is too hard for rapid
work, while the main veins are ideal
for easy working by hand. In fact,
one miner said the job does not mean
mining as much as mucking, as two
or three good holes will3reak enough
country for a husky mucker to work
a whole shift.
Recent visitors to the Ruby Silver
and NC4 camps come back joining in
words of praise for the outlook for
an - early producing district, which
will . reflect the good judgment of
many Prescott people who have in
vested their money to aid these camps
in getting a start toward success.

BEATING THE H.C.LIN BISBEE j
THROUGH common sense and practical methods, the Warren
district is pointing the way for other communities to deal
with the high cost of living problem. Three notable achieve
ments! must be marked up within a month to the credit of
those who have taken the initiative in settling the local food question)
ThesVare: 1
Purchase of two carloads of surplus food supplies.
Establishment of a municipal' market.
Reduction In cost of beef to the scale of seven years ago.
The city council, the Central Labor Union and the American Le
gion pushed through the purchase of the -army food. To the Ameri
can Legion and city council belong the credit for the municipal mar
ket. The reduction iri the price of beef was made by the local pack
ing concern, an "independent." by the way, which furnishes 90 per
cent of the meat consumed in Cochise county. Without assuming a
"holier than thou" attitude, it must be admitted that Bisbee has not
been afflicted with the profiteering evil as have other cities in the
southwest. Phices here have maintained a fairly reasonable ratio to
wages. . ,
Now that beef is down to the pre-war scale and a municipal mar
ket has been established where the shopper can purchase vegetables
and fruit direct from the producer, it looks as if the Warren district
would be the first in the country to put living rates back on a normal
peace-time basis. The reduction in beef prices will inevitably bring -Hnu-n
thft mat nt other foodstuffs. The municipal market has cut out
the profits of the middleman and reduced the expense of handling,
produce to a minimum. ,
Not only hAs the price for food been brought down, but rents
in Bisbee are lower than in any other place in the state. With a
climate second to none, Bisbee never has qualified as a resort city
and the scale of rents set to accommodate the prosperous tourist from
the east is unknown here. ' v ,
The homeseeker and wage earner who is looking for a place to
live where the cost of necessities has not outrun the pay scale could
do no better than to look into Bisbee's advantages.
j CONSIDERATIONS' FOR THE SHOPMEN
THE railroad shopmen have a responsibility to the American
public which they may or may not be disposed to consider.
But they also have a responsibility to themselves and their
vailing in so many industries at this time., says the Chicago
Tribune. The president has approved for the shopmen, not the very
large wage advance demanded, but enough to equalize their pay with
that of other railroad workers of similar service. To give more, he
declares, would be to Justify if not to increase wages to 2,000,000 more
employes of the railroad. This would skyrocket the cost of transpor-
tation and therefore the cost of living, adding directly to the burdens. ,
of every wage earner and every man, woman and child in the country
The shopmen cannot claim that their wage is so inadequate as to
justify casting this fresh burden on the public or precipitating the
tremendous misfortune of a national railway strike from which every
one would suffer severely and which would bring about a situation
next winter nothing less than tragic. We are confident, therefore,
a strike would be deeply resented by the whole country and would
not only lack the support of the public but of the men's own con
sciences. We think the strike would fail after great loss to the
country, but even if some advance over the president's offer were
won, if it compelled increases to all other railway employes, the total
net result to the shopmen might prove a deficit.
But there is still another consideration, and it is this: We do
not think the American public will submit to the possession by any
minority of a power great enough to strangle the business of the
nation and create widespread suffering and loss. If railway employes
when organized show a disposition to use unlimited force to compel
payment ot wage advances not required by urgent need, the nation
will certainly assert its paramount authority and the rights of rail
way organizations will be sharply restricted by law.

MEXICAN MOBBED FOR
SLIGHT TO U. S. FLAG.
PRESCOTT, Sept. 5 When a Mex
ican employe of the S." F. & P. in this
city refused to stand and. uncover as
the band played the national air on
fiiindav afternoon on the Dlaza. a
tragedy was only averted by. Judge
Chas. H. McLane appearing oh the
scene and . rescuing this supposedly
disloyal resident from the hands of
a large number of loyal men.
The trouble started when many
hundred people, obeyed the custom of
the day by respectfully paying jtnis
tribute to the flag, when it was seen
there was only the Mexican who fal
tered. He was remonstrated with in
a courteous manner by a workman.
Refusing to heed the warning and
vehemently protesting against ex
pressing such respect, the two men
became involved in a nsi iigm,
In a few seconds a score of Ameri
cans were in the melee. The Mex
ican was thrown to the ground ana
THE present attitude of the railroad unions, as indicated by
Btatement from their representatives, is admirable. A dis
position toward hasty, ill-considered action has been over
come. :
The executive officers of the shop workers, the group from whom
rash action was most feared, have urged them to be content for the
present and see how the government's program works out.
"it is our honest judgment," they say, "that a fatal mistake would
be made by our members to assume the responisbility of tying up the
railroads at this time, when the president is evidently doing all possi
ble to reduce the high cost of living."
They add the very practical comment that if the shop workers
should strike now, they would be bearing, alone, the burden and crit
icism resulting from a general tie-up and fighting the battle of the
whole remaining 78 per cent ot railroad men who have shown no dis
position to strike at this time. Inasmuch as the same treatment is
being accorded all railroad workers by the government, it is simple
common sense for them to hang together, whether they stick to their
jobs or strike.
The men concerned have evidently been much impressed with
this view. They are also influenced by the fact that the 4 per cent
raise grantod them is really larger than it looks because it Is based
on ten-hour pay for an eight-hour day.
If this determined effort to lower the cost of living should fail,
it is understood that all the railroad men will demand higher pay,
and will consider themselves justified in striking, it need be, to get
it. Meanwhile, they are to be commended for their patience, patriot
ism and good sense in co-operating with the public authorities and
trying to square living expenses with present wage standards instead
of resorting to the old. futile method of jacking up wages in hopeless
competition, with prices.

About the quickest way to find out how to make American lives

Mr. Ryan stopped his car when he

other in care of the camp. Deputy

NEW CRIMINAL CODE
A "spooner" who was caught

BITING THE HAND, ETC.
The Communist party at Chi

or "profits". This bars the "par

Pastor Stokes. William Bross
Lloyd and the bondsmen who got
''Bill" Haywood and hia I. W. W.

as if nobody.'not evn the Reds,'

LITTLE UNEMPLOYMENT.
New York World.
Of unemployment since the signing
of the armistice there has been far
less than was to be anticipated. The
United States has come through the
last ten months more easily than anv
other nation. The most general cause
of unemployment in this country has
been the restlessness of labor. It
has checked enterprise, slowed down
production and held up industry in
its normal development. Exorbitant
demands have created an atmosphere
of uncertainty and suspense. An epi
demic of strikes, like the railroad
shopmen's, reacts in every direction.
WHEN THE TRUTH IS KNOWN.
New York Times.
When the community perceives
that it is necessary either that labor
should earn its wages or else that
the '-community must make, up the de
ficiency or go without., the worst will
have ben passed. Then it will only
remain to impress that couviction
uiKn organized labor as a class apart
from the community. The President's
letter opens a larger subject than
railway wage payments or profits,
closed by votes either at the polls or
by labor unions. Economics discus
sions are best conducted dispassion
ately, even appealingly in the Presi
dents manner, but within the velvet
glove there should be a firm hand.

In Phoenix; Kelly's' Decision
Against Wolgast Is Upheld
Some additional . inside "dope" on
the fight at Phoenix Labor day be
tween Ad Wolgast and Young France
would Indicate that the decision In
favor of France, rendered by G. J.
(Scout) Kelly, the referee, was en
tirely justified and that the sporting
writers of the capital who frothed at
the mouth and showed other signs of
hydrophobia over the ruling were
' barking' up the ' vrong : tree. Some
' of the ring followers who know a fight
when they see one. have just returned
' to Los Angeles and throw a new light
on the match which would indicate
: that as sporting writers, some of the
ruueuu scriues uugiii 10 ub cover
ing" church Bocials, instead of box
ing matches. I
Cliff Jordan, who scored a 6-round
knockout over Kid Green on the day
France bested Wolgast, speaks as fol
lows through "Beany" Walker of the
Los Angeles Examiner:
"The France-Wolgast fight was a
humdinger, and I'll to say that there
was close to $10,000 bet on the con
test. The Phoenix newspapers did
not like Referee Kelly's decision. They
all thought that the worst Wolgast
should-have had was a draw, but I
do not look at It in that light.
"France boxed in grand style. He
had been coached as to just how Wol
gast would go after him and instead
of mixing it with the old champion
he stepped around and outpointed him
all the way. Wolgast Is far from
being a 'has been.' There's many a
fight left inthat boy. He and Fiance
fought themselves into great favor
down there and both can have Phoe
nix dates whenever they want them."
Wolgast and Manager Dougherty
confirmed all that Jordan had said of
the treatment accorded them in Ari
zona. Eut the little fighting man
ninimo tYihi tVio wnfct Vi Khmilrl have
had was a draw.
"We were treated like a lot of
champions," said Jordon. "This new
promoter, Cecil D. boyce, not only
gave us all he promised but more.
You'll hear France and Wolgast and
all the rest of the boys three-cheering
the Arizona sportsmen when they get
back here.
"They sure are backing the boxing
game down in Phoenix. The only bad
break, to my way of thinking, was
that both the Phoenix boxing clubs
staged their shows on the same night.
In this way they split up the crowd.
The club inside the city limits played
to capacity, which was 1700. Boyce's
club is four to five miles from the
c;ty limits and he played to 3000 or
more. Had they only held one con
test on the afternoon of Labor Day
and one in the evening Boyce prot
ably would have had five or six hun
dred more around his ring.
"The new arena built by Boyce and
his associates is closely patterned
after Jack Doyle's Vernon pavilion
and is modern from front steps to the
center of the ring. They are fig
uring on holding one or two shows
.every month and will go arter all -the
stars in the game. Just before I left
Boyce. had a wire from Billy Gibson
offering to send Lightweight Cham
pion Benny Leonard out for aa early

GREATEST DRUNK IN HISTORY OF ,: s
ALGOHDLISIVISTAGED BY PAPAGDS
"What is said to have been the
biggest drunk, the most comprehen
sive jag in the history of alcoholism
in the United States has just been
pulled off in the Papago country in
Arizona. The whole tribe was lit
' up. That was probably what gave
the impression of the northern lights
or the Aurora Borealis a few days
ago. But it was only a drunk and
the extraordinary dimensions of it
was due to a miscalculation .techni
cally called a miseue. The drunk it
self was preordained. It had its roots
in religion and superstition. It was
an annual rite. It will be repeated
'in spite of all the prohibition legisla
tion in Arizona. .
- The drunk happened" and consider
ing the size of it and all the circum
stances, the use of "happened" is ad
vised, on the Papago reservation, at
one of the central villages about 40
miles south of Casa Grande. That
vast stretch of country is a terra
incognita. It is the only frontier left
in the United States. It abounds in
mystery. Those who stay there a
short time are evercome by nervous
ness which soon gives place to dread
which becomes more and" more defi
nite and 'dread ripens into a panic
and a getaway. 4 "
There are strange things there; for
instance, a cave whose walls are cov
ered with hieroglyphics unlike any
other seen In North America.: There
are many skeletons there in strange
dresses. There is one, that of a wo
man with long yellow hair. The In
dians say their fathers and their fa
thers' know no more about these peo-,
pie than they do themselves; the heir
oglphics and the skeletons were there
generations ago. . Ethnologists have
found a resemblance of trie
skulls in that cave to. those of east
ern Asiatics.
But nothing" herein has anything
to. do with the big drunk which re
cently marred the reign of Arizona
law and wartime prohibition. Per
haps the Pagados did not kpow about
the Arizona law.' If they had ever
heard of the war and war-time pro
hibition that . they might have had
reason to suppose, that the war was
over, that the army had been demo
bilized. But perhaps they did not
care a tinker's "continental. They
'FUE-CLDTTT LOWERS COSTUF WRAPS
would not anyhow let the foolishness
of the whites interfere with their re
ligious ceremonies and in that they
seemed to have the sanction of the
United States constitution, though
they did not . really need it.
The Papagos have a fiesta every
year. The rites prescribe that it shah
be closed with a drunk; just a mod
erate drunk, though. The liquor used
is a kind of wine made from the beau
tiful red fruit that grows on top of
the giant cactus. Usually only
enough wine is made for a decent
tribal jag. The rites require thaf
all of the wine shall be drunk dur
ing the closing night. That is an ob
viously wise provision.
This year they made entirely too
much wine and that was the miscal
culation to which reference has been
made.' But the rite was complied
with; not a drop remained the morn
ing after the closing night. And in
the morning and long into the next
day the landscape for miles and
miles was dotted with prostrate Pa.
pagos. The only animate human be
ing was the trader at the central vil
lage. As he looked over the scene
cf desolation he was never before
so lonely. It- was as if the human
race had vanished all but him. He
was inclined to throw up his pob
with all the opportunities it offered
for profiteering.
The Indiana lay thickest aljout the
trading post in the immediate vicinity
of the automobile of the trader. They!
had removed the cushions to the
ground and were using them tor head
tests, their legs radiating to all
points of the compass like the rays
of the Japanese flag or the state
flag of Arizona. Every inch of space
on the cushions was occupied by a
swelled head or one that later would
be swollen.
The snoring in the vicinity was
stertorous and tumultous. Farther
on in the distance here and there
was the outstretched body of a sleep
ing Indian. The place was dotted
with them thinner, as tar as the amaz
ed gaze of the trader reached.
The man is going to close out his
business now and visit the Grand

NATIONALIZATION "ALAPLUMB"
PROVES FAILURE MP0DE5
Under the head of "Nationalization
Fails," the New York Times of Aug.
22nd editorially speaks at length re
garding the trial given "nationaliza
tion" in New Zealand and Australia.
It seems certain union-dominated
English newspapers were backing the
program of the English miners who
a la Plumb, were seeking control of
England's mining industry, but when
the coal commissioner began hearing?
on the question and called expert wit
nesses to describe the effects of "na
tionalization" in the Antipodes these
papers did the ostrich act.
The editorial follows:
Scant space was given by those
English newspapers which, with
"ear to the ground," were eager to
make a case for the nationalizat
ion of coal mines, then erroneous
ly supposed to be popular, to the
testimony of a witness before the
coal commission in regard to na
tionalization in New Zealand and
Australia. It was shown that in
dustries there nationalized were
made inefficient by that political
control which is inevitable to na
tionalization. The workmen had
no reason to be industrious. They
manifested no energy. They didn't
have to. They lost the power of
initiative. Jobs crept into the
management. The government was
in a permanent state of gooseflesh.
When a decision was absolutely
necessary it didn't dare to make it.
In his book on Australian "Pro
blems find Prospects," Sir Charles
G. Wade, agent general for New
.South Wales and sometimes its
prime minister, gives first hand
(evidence to the same effect. It
might has been supposed that the
working of the famous, or once fa
mous, Industrial Arbitration act in
that state would have been suffi
ciently instructive as to the result
of labor in politics and the govern
ment bedeviled by labor. The court
established to compose labor con
troversies under the act held that
: union laborers must be preferred
bv it to non-union laborers. Of
course, the non-union men swarm
ed into the unions, and the unions
forced their members to vote the
labor party ticket. Decisions
against employers could be en
forced. Decisions against employes
could not. Such is the case, for
that matter, in Great Britain, since
. tho. passage of the trade disputes
act of 1906 made it impossible to
get any satisfaction from the .trade
unions by damages Or in tort.
' The industrial- arbitration act
railing. Wage Boards of employers
and employes, with an impartial
chairman, were tried. According
to Sir Charles, the union men
would take all -that the boards
could be persuaded to give them
and then strike to force the dispute
and grant their demands. "The
penalty imposed for firmness on
the" part , of the government was
severe," says Sir Charles. Strikes
were numerous. The law was
scorned and the peace broken.
What can you expect when govern
ment caters to a class?
The result of government inter
vention in labor disputes in New
South Wales tell us what was to be
expected of tire government essays
in various industries. ViStm 1911
to 1917 there were sixteen of these.
They must have, been on a mall
scale,- for the government seems to
have been only some 4100,000 out of
pocket by them; but the causes of
the i failure are significant. The
management was incompetent; be
cause, though the managers were
efficient, political influence was
continually going over their heads.
Unfit, men were, foisted upon. the
various establishments. It was
useless to discharge them because
they were sure to be . brought back
by. the politicians.. Discipline broke
down. . Cost increased. Strikes
occurred . as in private concerns.
"Experience shows," writes Sir
Char-les, "that if a : strike takes
place in a government establish
ment, ministerial intervention is en
forced and a concession made to
the strikers. The government posi
tion is always ' difficult.' If the
ministry resists the demands, votes
may be imperiled; if they yield, dis
cipline may be threatened. Where
the state is the largest employer of
labor and the franchise is adult,
any action of the government whia
displeases the . employe might be
resisted not only through the

Are Hot on Trail
Of Doc' Matthes
Doc W.'II. Matthes, guardian of the
Y. M. V. A. fish pond, was remaining
under water yesterday lest some keen
eyed high school baseball player spy
him. The high school . ten were
keeping open season on "Doc."
Friday afternoon Brownlie's team
licked the Horace Mann Junior inne
in the final game of the indoor base
ball series, 12-9. Matthes, as press
agent, announced, the win, for the
Horace Mann crowd. ,
That's why the genial "Doc" was

after him.
Loughrey and Myers
Bout Sought In Ray
Frank Loughrey yesterday received
a letter from W. R. Conneman at
Ray, asking Loughrey's terms for a
teu-round fight with some good boy
at Ray. Mr. Conneman stated that
the Ray district, ineradlng llayden
and Winkloman, has been stung by
tub 'fi.?ht bug" and they intend to
put on some good matches. "There
are any number of boxing enthusiasts
in these hustling camps and good
crowds aro assured. It is" possible
that Loughrey and Johnny - Myers
may get au engagement there. ;
Only a few of the strikers at the
Rochester optical works are still out,
and it is reliably reported that they
can see their finish, t
weapon of the strike: Immediately,
but punished at the ballot box
when the general election takes
place." Sir Charles is very prbud
of Australia, it is the freest
and most democratic country innhe
world to him. Yet his . own testi
mony proves that a state whych
owns or controls industry even a
state which is an intervener, and a
necessarily or unusually vole-regarding
and biased intervener) in
industrial controversies, promotes
a class, strays from democracy, in
jures industrial efficiency, increas
es cost, and diminishes production.
The United States and Great
Britain should heed the lesson
from the Antipodes.

Helpful Thoughts .

Useless Quarrels.
All quarrels are useless, but some
are more useless than others. It Is
easy to start a quarrel and often hard
to end It. No benefit to anyone is de
rived from the exchange of heated
words, and there are ; many distinct
disadvantages. Many homicides start
ed with a quarrel over a trilling inci
dent and even where the end is not so
tragic the harm done 13 quite definite.
The habit of quarreling is one that
grows. It is comparatively easy to
reach the stage where the most inno
cent remark can serve as a basis for
sharp words that will lead to still
sharper words, and thus all-tempers
will be ruffled. And a distinct Injury
Is done when one loses one's temper.
It Is a nervous shock that uses up en
ergy more rapidly tlian physical or
mental exertion.
If everyone realized that' a quarrel
demands its price and that the price
must be paid there would be less quar
reling. Harsh words can Injure the
same as blows. Courts have held that
an assault can be verbal as well as
physical. . Speak crossly to a dog and
see the sensitive creature cringe. Can
there be any doubt that the dog has
suffered? Isn't It certain that what will
hurt a dog will hurt a human being?
When tempted to use words that
will hurt ask yourself "What's the
use?" What good will it do yoa or
anyone else to say something that is
merely smart or that seems clever7
One seldom makes a mistake In re
maining silent, and when the alterna
tive is to say something that is Intend
ed to ruffle the feelings of another
then it Is always best to say nothing.
The habit of snarling, of fault find
ing, of complaining about trivialities,
Is one of easy growth, and many per
sons who have It are absolutely un
aware of their affliction, for it is an
affliction, not only to themselves, but
to all their associates. If you have the
habit resolve to drop it, and begin at
once. Think before you speak, and if
what you are about to say might do
harm and can't possibly do good don't
speak. -

IF FATHER HAD TO COOK
By Our Own Tame Poet. -
If father had to cook the meals, as mother does each day, and make the
beds and sweep the floors, he'd have much less to say about the easy time she
has. The family, too,, would learn that food unwatclled upon the stove will very
quickly burn, that even boiling eggs require a certain skillful knack, that manv
dishes can be spoiled the while one turns his back. - A woman's work-may not be
hard or need a giant's strength, but It keeps your mind right on the Job, and the
nervous strain at length will get upon a person's nerves and make him want to
go some place where nothing's ever rushed and everything is slow. That father
doesn't have to cook is a splendid thing for dad and the family, too, for If he
cooked our digestions would be bad.
KITCHEN KINKS.
Vinegar will replace lemon Juice In

A teaspoonful of orange marmalade
replaces sugar In the teacup.
Poultry fat, when clarified, may be

Bake sponge cake In the smallest of
gem pans and frost with milk icing.
A gelatin dessert can be made in

The Nursem
Feeding the Child.
Many children are always teasing
for articles of food which they ought
not to have. The reason Is that they
have been badly brought up and have
been given "tastes" of things. Conse
quently they do not see why they
should not have a taste of everything
and eat everything. . The child that
has been pioperly reared and has nev
er been given a taste of anything ex
cept of Its own food does not expect
to have anything else to eat and will
therefore never ask for other food. He
will be perfectly contented with his
own food, and 1t will never occur to
him that he can eat anything else.
On this account it is bad for a child
to begin to sit at the fattiily table too
early, the parents being too soft heart
ed or weak minded to resist their chil
dren's requests. In any case a young
child should eat its supper alone. The
child will not be dissatisfied with a
routine diet provided it has never had
anything else. .

CARE OF THE HANDS.
PLANT PEONIES NOW
' , FOR NEXT SUMMER.
Nothing "dresses up" a garden like
gorgeous peonies, and the best of peo
nies is that -once started they grow
handsomer each year and require very
little attention except for digging
around the roots occasionally and cut
ting back to the ground when autumn
comes. This is the time to plant a
hedge of peonies, or even two or three
single plants. Peonies planted now
will blossom next year and still more
abundantly the year after, each year
Increasing In beauty as the plants
grow and flourish. If you wait until
spring to plant your peonies you will
have only green leaves until the sec
ond season comes around.
Even without their gorgeous blos
soms, however, peotoy plants are an
ornament to the garden. The leaves
always have such a clean look, and In
the spring the rosy tips of peony
shoots peeping through the dark soil
are something Jo watch for when you
push aside the blanket of last year's
dead leaves to see the new growing
things coming up.
Golden coreopsis may also be planted
now for next summer's blossoming,
and now is the time to look after your
hollyhock pods. As the blossoms go to
seed bend down the pods so that the
black seeds may scatter themselves
around the foot of the growing plants,
and next summer your row of tall hol
lyhocks will be richer In color and
more luxuriant In growth.

Pretty hands
are an Important
feature of femi
nine beauty, and
one that can often
times be consid
erably enhanced
by means of care
ful treatment The
nails should be
regularly mani
cured, and if this
is - done at home
one or two points
are worth remembering. Never use a
sharp-pointed article when cleaning
the nails. Cutting 'should he done with
a nail scissors not u knife every ten
days or so. In washing the hands a
soft brush Is the best to use.
"' Sometimes the hands become rough
or red from housework or outdoor use.
In that case they may be softened and
whitened by using a paste made as
follows .
White wax (pure) 2 ounces .
Oil of sweet al
monds 4 ounces
Otto of roses 6 drops

thoroughly, pounding in a mortar;
then, add the otto of roses, drop by
drop. Spread a small quantity of this
paste evenly on the .Inside of ah. rid

places. Wear the gloves occasionally
at night and they will do wonders In
making the bands white and dainty. !
Young girls and delicate women are
often annoyed by abnormal perspira
tion of the hands which are moist and
clammy. A simple remedy is to bathe
them several times a day with the fol

In addition, powdered orris root or
violet talcum powder will be found
helpful, or the following powder may
be used:
This lotion can also be used for
edying undue greasiness of the faea.
