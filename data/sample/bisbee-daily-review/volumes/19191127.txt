14 PER GEHT WAGE ADVANCE FOR
ALL MINERS
CONTROL OF PRICE, CONCLUSION
FUEL ADMINISTRATOR GARFIELD
John L. Lewis, Acting President of United Mine Workers
of America, Declared When the Meeting Broke Up
That the Miners Would Not Accept a 14 Per
Cent Increase; One Official Character
ized It As An "Insult"
WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 A wage
advance of 14 per cent for all mine
workers, maintenance of government
control over coal prices, and no in
crease in prices at this time, were
the conclusions of Fuel Administra
tor Garfield, announced tonight to
the operataors' and miners' wage
scale committees. .
Dr. Garfield said Jhat Mr. Wilson
made his proposal as a mediator tc
facilitate negotiations, and that Mr.
Wilson told him today it was the
duty of the fuel administration to
fix prices, and that it was not the
functions of the secretary of labor.
"The cabinet has decided f'.tit the
basis I have auestert lr. sound and
richt," Dr. GarMeii sail.
Dr. Garfield declared that the
miners, without the proposed in
crease of 14 per cent, were better
off than other classes or employ
ment. A permanent body, with
purely advisory powers, consisting of
the secretary of the interior as chair
man and of an equal number of rep
resentatives of operators and miners
was recommended by Dr. Garfield.
This board would continue to ap
ply the principles announced by the
fuel administration to unsettled

The morning session adjourned at

WASHINGTON, Nov. 26 Some of
ficials expressed belief today that
the Mexican government's delay in
replying to the American note, snt
more than a week ago, demanding
release of Wm. O. Jenkins, consular
agent at PueMa, was part of a deli
berate plan to still further antagon
ize the United States.
This belief was based largely u).on
official information from Mexico
City that officials there were en
deavoring to spread the report that
this country was on the verge of a
revolution and that by holding up
the reply Mexicans could offer sub
stantial aid to the "revolutionists."
Mexican agents in the United
States, the udvices said, had been

conditions.
John L. Lewis, acting president of
the United Mine Workers of Amer

Dr. Garfield broke up, that "the
miners will not accept a 14 per cent
wage increase."
A number of miners attempted to
jeer the new wage scale. Alexander
Howat, president of the Kansas 'Min
ers' association, characterized it aa
an "insult" and said "we are ready
to go home and fight it out."
In the midst of a sharp cross fire
of questions, Frank Farrington, pres
ident of the Illinois district of United
Mine Workers, asked Dr. Garfield if
the miners would be regarded as
"outlaws" if they did not return to
work.
The government never has at
tempted to compel men to work
against their will, but every protec
tion will be offered miners willing
to return to the mines. Dr. Garfield
replied.
Farrington replied that he did not
think this would be necessary for
miners in Illinois, as he did not be

STEAMER WRECKED

IT LIKELY
that this was an error and that only
a motion to vote on it was adopted.
When the conference reassembled
this afternoon the director general's
offer was again taken up. Many
amendments were offered by the dele
gates and further requests were sent
to Washington for xplanatlon of its
workings with the elimination of ar
bitrages and allowances, as stipulat
ed by the derictor general.
It was learned from an authoritative
source tonight that the delegates are
opposed to accepting the proposition
if all the arbitraries and allowances
existing in many schedules at present
are eliminated, figuring that the loss
of these arbitraries and allowances is
nearly equal to the amount gained by
the overtime offer.

There was no report from the em

anything to those received hereto

$150,000 from his after he had been
kidnapped. One dispatch from Mex
ico City said the Mexican senate had
decided to ask President Carranza
for full information on the Jenkins

that no reply might be expocted un

Homer S. Cummings,
chairman of the Democratic
national committee, in a
statement tonight, arraign
ed congress for its failure
to enact at the extraordi
nary session the reconstruc

Republican leaders.
Mr. Cummings s&id the
house had "frittered" away
its time in "futile investiga

that the record in the sen-
ate was even "more dis
creditable," as it had occu
pied six months in "sterile"
debate without being able
to say yes or ' no to

State Auditor Jesse L. Boyce that
he had restored to the use of the na

$91,533.14, following advices from the
office of State's Attorney General

E. J. K. McBride, assistant attor

appropriations by the 1915 and 1917
legislatures for armories and arsen
als continued available, as no time
limit had been made for the return
of unused amounts to . the 'general
fund.
The original appropriations amount
ed to about $93,000. a small amount
thereof being used for repairing cer

The remaining amount, $91,533.14,
is at the disposition of Adjutant Gen

The lectures are conducted every j
Wednesday in the Y. M. C. A. at II

Bisbee teachers played a prominent
part in the sessions of the Cochise
County Teachers' institute, which con
cluded its three days' sessions in
Douglas last evening, in time to 'give
all the visiting teachers an opportun
ity to get back to their homes in var
ious parts of the county in time for
Thanksgiving dinner.
The singing of Miss Chaiiitte Ander
son, music supervisor of the Bisbee
school, and her .piano selections, were
a pleasurable feature of the sessions.
Mr. K." R. Umfleet of Bisbee also con
tributed to the program with vocal se
lections. Miss Louise Sporleder of Bisbee,
county home economics demonstration
agent, gave practical demonstrations
before the institute, including how to
prepare "Hot School Lunch."
Superintendent C. F. Philbrook of
the local schools gave an address ex
plaining the new course of study for
high schools, recently put in vogue by
the state board of education.
Miss Dorothy I. Greeg, primary su
pervisor in the Bisbee schools, ad
dressed the grade section at the in
stitute. Principal E. Q. Snider of the Bisbee
high schoo;, olossometf forth in a
role which drew forth hearty laughter
from the assembled teachers, with a
humorous impersonation of one Bill
Adams, describing "How the Duke of
Wellington and Me Won the Battle of
Waterloo."
The Bisbee summer scTiool came in
for its meed of commendation when
Dr. H. II. Foster, head of the educa
tional department of the University of
Arizona told of the excellent work
done at the school, and of its benefit
to teachers throughout the state. Dr.
Foster was in charge of the high
school department work at the insti
tute. Returning Bisbee teachers declare
the institute, which was called by
County Superintendent of Schools
Miss Elsie Toles, was one of the most
instructive and profitable ever held in
the county, with new and interesting
features at every session.
More than 300 Cochise county teach
ers attended the institute. The prin
cipal speakers were Proressor Rugh
of the high school department of the
University of California, ana Miss
McCrickett of the faculty of the state
normal school at Ypsilianti. Michigan.
The sessions were held in the Douglas
high school auditorium.

BLESSED TED:
It was the greatest fun seeing you,
and I really had a satisfactory time
with you, and came away feeling
that you were doing well. I am en
tirely satisfied with your standing,
both in your studies and in athletics.
I want you to do well in your sports,
and I want even more to have you
do well with your books; but I do
not expect you to stand first in eith
er, if to to stand would cause you
orerwork and hurt jour health. I
always believe in going harj at
everything, whether it is Latin or
mathematics, boxing or football, but
at the same time I want to keep
the Bense of proportion. It is never
worth , while to absolutely exhaust
one's self or to take big chances un
less for an adequate object. I want
you to keep in training the faculties
which would make you, if the need
arose, able to put your last ounce of
pluck and strength into a contest.
But I do not want you to squander
these qualities. To have you play
football as well as you do, and make
a good name in boxing and wrestling,
and be cox of your second crew, and
stand second or third in your class
in the studies, it's all right. I should
be rather sorry to see you drop too
near the middle of your class, be
cause, ai you connot enter college
until you are nineteen, and will
therefore be a year later in enter
ing life, I want you to be prepared
in the best possible way, so as to
make up for the delay. But I know
that all you can do you will do to
keep substantially 'the position 5 in
the class that you have so far kept,
and I have entire trust in you, for
you have always deserved it.
The weather has been lovely here.
The cherry trees are in full bloom,
the peach trees just opening, while
the apples will not be out for ten
days. The May flowers and blood
rot have gone, the anemonies and
bellwort have come and the violets
are coming. All the birds are here,
pretty much, and the warblers troop
through the woods.;
To my delight, yesterday Kermit,
vhen tried him on 'Diamond, did ek
cellently. 'He' has evidently turned
the corner 'in his riding, and was
just as much at home as possible,
although he was on my saddle with
1 his feet thrust in the leathers jabove
the stirrup. Poor mother has had a
haid time with Vagenka, for she
rubbed her back, and as she sadly
needs exercise and I could not have
a saddle put upon her, I took her
out bareback yesterday.' Her gaits
are so easy that it is really more
comfortable to ride her without a
saddle than to ride Te::p.s with one.
and I gave her three miles sharp
cantering and trotting.

Kermit taking out Dewey Sr. and

fellow imaginable. He is always
thinking of you. He has now struck
up a" great friendship wich Nicholas,
rather to Maine's (the nurse's) re
gret, as Mame would like to keep
him purely for Quentin. The last-
named small boisterous person was j
in reariul disgrace this morning,
havnf fluig a block at his mother's
head. It was done in sheer playful
nert;. bu of course could not be
passedover lightly, and after the
enormity of the crime had been
brought fully home to him, he fled
with howls of anguish to me and lay
in an abandon of yellow-headed grief
in my arms. Ethel is earning money
for the purchase of the Art Magazine
by industriously hoeing up the weeds
in the walk. Alice is going to ride
Yagenka bareback this afternoon,
while I try to teach Ethel on Dia
mond, after Kermit has had his ride.
Yesterday at dinner we were talk
ing of how badly poor Mrs. Blank
looked, and Kermit suddenly observ
ed in an aside to Ethel, entirely un
conscious that we were listening:
"Oh, Effel, I'll tell you what Mrs.
Blank looks like: Like Davh? hen dat
died you know, de one dat couldn't
hop up on de perch." Naturally,
this is yurely a private anecdote.
Archie and Quentin
Oyster Bay, May 7. 1901.
BLESSED ED:
Recently I have gone in to play
with Archie and Quentin after they
have gone to bed, and they have
grown to expect me, jumping up,
very soft and warm in their tom
mies, expecting me to roll them over
on the bed and tickle and "grabble"
in them. However, it has proved
lather too exciting, and an edict has
gone forth that hereafter I must play
bear with them before supper, and
give up the play when they have
gone to bed. Today was Archie's
birthday, and Quentin resented
Archie's having presents while he
(Quentin) had none. With the ap
palling frankness of three years old
he remarked with great sincerity
that "it made him miserable," and
when taken to task for his lack of
altruistic spirit he expressed an ob
viously perfunctory repentance and
said:- "Well, boys must lend boys
things, at any rate!"

meeting at w hich women and men of
the Wan-en district are urged to at
tend, will be held at 3:30 o'clock" the
same afternoon.
Miss Sawyer is known's eh excel

derful story to tell, but asin previous
lectures will draw from her limitless
store of funny sayings and experiences
of our neighbors in the far east, mak
ing the lecture both instructive and

During her visit here she will ad

We very much wished for you
while we were at the (San Francis
co) Exposition. By night it was es
pecially beautiful. Alice and I also
wished that you could have been
with us when we were out riding at
Genesea. Major Wadsworth put me
on a splendid big horse called Triton,
and sister on a thoroughbred mare.
They would jump anything. It was
lister's first experience, but she did
splendidly and rode at any fence at
which I would first put Triton. I
did not try anything very high, but
still some of the posts and rails were
about four feet high, and it was
enough to test sister's seat. Of course
all we had to do was to stick on as
the horses jumped perfectly and en
joyed it quite as much as wa did.
The first four or five fences th:tt I
went over I should be ashamed to
say how far I bounced out of the
saddle, but after a while I Degan to
get into my seat again. It ha3 b;en
a good many years since I have
jumped a fence.
Mother stopped off at Albany while
sister went on to Boston, and I came
on here alone Tuesday afternoon.
St. Gaudens, the sculptor, and Dunne
(Mr. Dooley) were on the train and
took lunch with us. It was great
fun meeting them. and I liked them
both. Kermit met me in high feath
er, although I did not reach the
house until ten o'clock, and he sat
by me and we exchanged anecdotes
while I took my supper. Ethel had
put an alarm clock under her head
so as to he sure and waiti1 up, but
although it went off she continued
to slumber profoundly, as di 1 Quen
tin. Archie waked up sufficiently to
tell me that he had fou.vl another
turtle just as small as :he already
existing treasure of the same kind.
This morning Quentin and Blnck
Jack have neither of ihoni been will
ing to leave me for any length of
time. Black Jack simply lies curled
up in a chair, but as Quentin is most
conversational, he has edded an ele
ment of harassing difficulty to my
effort to answer my accumilated
c-oiiespondence.
Archie announced that ha had seen
"the Baltimore orioles catching
fish!" This seemed to warrant in
vestigation; but it turn.vl out he

A THOUGHT FOR THE DAY
"No Thanksgiving is complete without its generous thought of
those who are not so favored as we are."
LET US GIVE THANKS FOR OUR
AMERICANISM
W2 EACH OK US have many good and sufficient reasons for
oeing thankful this Thanksgiving Day. And not the least of these
that we are Americans
Americanism, planted on the virgin soil of a new land, an
unbroken wilderness or savages and waste, shaped and guarded iJy
the lifeblood of men noble and brave, is ours by Inheritance and ours
by acceptance. Through the hands of American patriots. In days
of peace and war, it has come to us. It is indefinable, without limit,
and comes alike to the old and the young, the rich and the poor,
the man and Hie woman, ihc native and the forcign-born vvho will
accept it. ;
It is the Americanism which stands so solidly against the enemy
of civilization, the foe of humanity, the Red plotter of anarchy. It
is the Americanism in our breasta which makes of Americans a
people united' when the time-honored principles cf freedom and
democracy are attacked. It. is the same Americanism which so
stoutly withstands the onslaughts of the foreign agitator and his
co-conspirator, the native born, discontented advocate of minority
rule. ,
Just as this spirit of Americanism made it possible for the peo
ple of the United States to throw the weight of the mightiest na
tion on earth into the scales of war when right and justice was
sorely tried so will Americanism save the land from the internal
chaos toward which the extremists on our shores would hurl America
in their mad endeavor to make of our government what the small
handful of citizens desire ar.d what the vast majority fear most
earnestly and with reason.
"When we have the rule Russia now has," exclaimed one l-'ol-shevik
sympathizer recently, "you'll hear no more of 'Americanism.'
What is 'Americanism,' anyhow?" he screamed. .
Americanism, wo would like to explain to this individual, is gov
ernment by the majority, not by the minority. It is government by
ballot, not by bullet. It is government by law, not by license.
And this is why we Americans give thanks for our Americanism.
He was right when he insisted that Americanism would become
extinct wwith the advent in American of Russianism. Nothing more
true was ever spoken. Americanism pnd Russianism could not live,,
in the same land. Before Russianism could triumph here American
ism must die. Some there are who believe Americanism can be
killed in American hearts. They are those who believe Rus.sianism
can rear its ugly head in the now world. We don't believe it. Some
ninety million other Americans do not believe Americanism will
cease to exist. Notnmg in all the world is more alive, nor stronger,
than this Americanism for which we Americans give thanks this day.
War's reaction the period of social unrest and economic dis
turbancehas not weakened the spirit that dwells in the hearts of
Americans, the spirit that took of a new world and made it the
greatest, richest, most democratic country on earth. A year of
peace has made us better Americans than ever, stronger Americans,
more democratic Americans, more ardently wedded to the American

COMPLIMENTS OF SOVIET RUSSIA IN U. S.
Impressing into service our own Uncle Sam, through his ef
ficient mail system, to transport its ill-smelling contents, there
comes to the Review editor's desk a copy of "SOVIET RUSSIA", a
magazine printed weekly at 110 West 40th Street, New York City,
and described by itself as "the official organ of the Russian Soviet
Government Bureau."
To crown the insult (were insult from such a morally sub
merged source thinkable) "Soviet Russia" encloses for the Review
editor an application blank, which the editor is supposeU to fill with,
a request that "Soviet Russia" put the Review on its mailing list.
The magazine, together with the application blank, will be in
Bisbee's garbage dump by the time this is read. Meanwhile there
is food for thought in the fact that "Soviet Russia" is circulating
througli the mails, and boldly seeking subscribers through the mails.
MECHANICAL AGE COMING
Since the armistice was signed, the copper, lead and zinc in
dustry of the west has suffered cue to unsettled world conditions
while many less basic industries have prospered.
The day is coming, however, when the western industry will
aga'in hit its stride t'or the world demand for these metals will be
greater than ever, due to the requirements it the mechanical age
which we are just entering.
The automobile, the tractor, the flying machine, the gas burning
marine engines and last and greatest, the electrification of industry
and railroads, is going to call for quantities. of copper, zinc and
lead never before dreamed of.
The proposal made Monday at Chicago to organize a national
labor party will undoubtedly meet with the whole-hearted opposition
of the I. W. W. and others of that ilk. Battle for one's cause in
orderly fashion at the polls, through the bloodless and law-abiding
medium of the ballot? What I. W. W. may be expected to listen to
such a proposal as long as there remain crops to destroy, factories
to burn, government officials to dynamiU: or patriotic members of
the American Lii gion to murder?

They've sent U3 through the passing year,
I sometimes think my gifts so lew.
That I should pass the feast day by,
And look upon the joyous world
With all cynic's jaundiced eye.
But when the festive day arrives,
I always find my mood to change,
As often as I chance to pass
Along the red-hot kitchen range,
And so I always lift my voice,
With that of every other sinner,
And list a song of heart-felt thanks
That I have got a turkey dinner!

With the technical knockout which
"Happy" Woods, the hard-hitting
welterweight who fights Johnnie
Myer here on Dec. 11. scored last
night at Tucson over Frenchie Des
marias, interest in the Woods-Myer
battle increased perceptibly in every
place in the city which received the
news. The long, sieep-proaucing
swings of Wood.s which have won
him every fight in his career, im
mediately became the one topic of
discussion among fans, with an ac
companying speculation as to
whether Myer. can stand up under
the attacks of a man of the fight
ing ability and hitting ability of
Woods. Those who have watched
Myers climb the ladder, however,
were of the opinion that in him
Woods is going to find another kind
of boxer than those to whom he has
been accustomed.
Myer Is one of the coolest men
in the ring in Arizona today. He
has ah iron nerve, and he never
loses control of himself. He is be
coming a. better boxer every day,
and he has a fighting heart. He
can also take a clip on the jaw
without flinching, and for these rea
sons his friends are saying that

ranks in this fight is going to keep
his place by showing up Wood3.

which has been srranged for Dec.
11 under the auspices of the Bisbee
Athletic club are training regularly,
although each is taking things com
paratively easy until after today,
when they will take up the job of
conditioning in real earnest. This
card, more than any other which has
been presented by the club, is being
known as a "knockout" . card, with
the wise ones figuring that there is
going to be much upsetting of the
dope, and -there is a consequent
interest in" the program which al
ready argues for perhaps the largest
attendance in the history of the club

Arizona Varsity's last football
game of 1919 will be played on the
University athletic field in Tucson
Thanksgiving afternocn at three
o'clock, with Occidental. So far, this
year, the University of Aiizona has
won eve.-y game that she played,
with Ihe rclc exception of the game
that v.j.s lost to Pomona college
Novc-.-.ber 8th.
Last Saturday Pomona beat Occi
dental by a score of 20 to 7. When
Pomona boat Arizona the score was
19 to 7. When "Oxy" comes on the
field here next Thursday she will be
playing a team that has been beat
en by nearly the same score as she
herself lost to Pomona. This should
make the Arizona-Occidental game
the hardest fought, and closest game
of the season, played on Arizona's
field.
It is the opinion of the Arizona
football experts that Pomona is not
really as much better than Occidental
as lust Saturday's score would seem
to show and the Varsity is expecting
the hardest scrap that they have had
to contend with this season.
CHET NEFF CATCHES TARTAR
"Neff was called to Seattle by the
illness of a relative" but Chester
stopped off at Vernon for a little tilt
with Allie Nack Friday evening, says
the Globe Record. And again we
might state that Chet is certainly
game but on this occasion he wasn't
discrete. Beany Walker says: "Ailie
Nack knocked all the loose sand out
or Chet Neff's famous Arizona rec
ord in the main event at Vernon
laat nisht. Allie doesn't hit too hard
for Chet, but he doc3 hit too clean
and too often. While Nack won well
out in front, there wasn't a second
that he didn't know he had company
in the ring. Neff kept boring in and
wanted to tight, but he just couldn't
keep ail those boxing gloves out of
his face." Chet will probably return
to Aiizona in the near future.
FOOTBALL IN PHOENIX TODAY.
Phoenix, Nov. 26. The classic
football evefft of the 1919 gridiron
season in the Salt River valley will
be played on the new high school
athletic, field Thanksgiving Day
when the Phoenix Indian school
eleven and the Coyote squad meet
in their annual Turkey day struggle.
Two teams carefully primed for a
gsuelling battle will take the field
when the referee's whistle sounds
tomorrow afternoon, calling the
squads io the center, of the field for
the to?s of the coin. Never in the
history of local athletics have these
teams been more tirelessly drilled
than this year.
An excellent brand of football will
be dished out by both teams. That
much is certain after a visit at the
respective training camps, where the
TUCSON, Nov. 26. Happy Woods
of this city scored a feeunicat knock
out over Frenchy Des Marias of Den
ver in the tenth round or their fight
here tonight. The bout was even un
til the eighth, when Woods' manager
sent him with instructions to finish
the match. Woods had been trying
from the start to land one of his ter
rific swings to the body or an upper
cut to the jaw, but Des Marias had
successfully avoided them. In the
opening of the tenth, however, Woods
landed the first blow of the round to
Des Marias' jaw. Des Marias went
down, but was up at the count of nine,
apparently groggy. He went down and
took -the count of seven a few seconds
later and when he came up was again
floored with a blow to the jaw. He
sprang up after the count or ten and
said he did not hear the last count.
Ringside fans, however, were or tbe
opinion that the bout was unquestion
ably Woods. Woods has been fight
ing but a few months, but has never
been defeated.
Freddy McManus of this city and
Eddie Connell, military instructor at
the University of Arizona, fought six
fast rounds to a draw. Although out
weighed seven pounds, Connell held
his own throughout the bout and sev
eral times seemed to have McManus
puzzled.
coaches are working overtime in
polishing off the iought edies of the
team play. Two well nigh perfect
machines, perfectly oiled and lubri
cated, with reserve power in abund
ance in trick plays and freak forma
tions, are these ancient rivals.
"LET BOXING LIVE"
Press reports state that Governor
Campbell has declared himself as be
ing against boxing and promises to
u.-e his influence to the end that the
Arizona boxing law will be repealed.
If the governor has been influenced
by the conduct of the boxing game
in the capital city we dont' blame
him for getting peeved but there
are other towns in this state besides
Phoenix, and it should be remember
ed that Gila county went 'strong' on
the petitions to the state legislature
when the boxing bill was under con
sideration,, urges the Globe Record.
"Somebody's Always Taking the Joy
out of Life" Here's hoping the
legislature improves the present bill;
but let boxing live in Arizona!

building and the Presbyterian eliuich
several times last night by the ac-
of young nun v.ho are de-
s hoodlums, and who have
robbed premises, Chet Moon would
never have . been arrested for the
crime. The story of the arrest, as
detailed by these men yesterday, is
Js follows:
When the premises were examined
on the morning of the robbery, a piece
of human skin was found, leading the
police to belief that the man who had
taken the money from the market
would show a wound on the hand. Gil
pin, it is declared, saw Moon at the
E. P. & S. W. depot with his hand In
his pocket and then, after going close
to him. saw that his hand was injur
ed, that the appearance of the skin
of his hand was the same as that of
trie piece of epidermis which had been
found in the market. He then told of
this to Sheriff McDonald. It is said,
who refused to believe ii until he, too,
had seen the injured" hand. The evi
dence it is declared, was so striking
that the sheriff then placed Mocn un
der arrest. But had not Gilpin acted
orf hfs hunch, according to the belief
of the police, the Treu robbery would
still be an unsolved mystery.
If Mr. Gilpin will call at the Review
office, the check for $25 will be given
to him.

Chief Kempton Has .
Ponndmaster ; Burro
Trouble Is At End
Wearing the broadest smile that
has distinguished his features for
months, and radiating a spirit of
geniality and kindliness that trans
formed police headquarters yesterday
into a real Thanksgiving day refuge,
Chief J. E. Kempton announced yes
terday that he has discovered a
poundmaster and that the burro
problem in Bisbee has come to a
sudden and blissful ending.
Bennie Herman, according to the
chief, has been given the coveted
position, and the roundup of the
burro tribe has started already. The
animals are to be placed in the city
corral, where they are to be kept
for the owners for a few days, and,
should no claimants appear, are to
be killed. Herman has been given
a huge lock by the chief to insure
that the burros will stay in the cor
ral after they are herded in, and io
insure that they will not. crawl
through holes in the fence where
several boards have been ripped off.
he has been given also a clawham
mer and several spikes, so that the
asinine prowlers who have raised
Cain heretofore with the promising
gardens of Bisbee will no longer
distract the housewife or affrighht
the husband homeward bound after
a hard night at the club.
been making night hideaus lately in
that neighlioi'iiood, C. N. Thomas, j
night watchman, announced that he
is going to take particular pains to
round up the young men of Bisbee
who have the habit of raising small
riots after midnight. His decision, i
which is also' the decision of ihe i
police department, is made panic j
ulirly of moment because of the j
fact that a number of petty rob- ;
beries have been committeed lately,
and suspicions characters are to be I

mail your Christmas gifts to thiin so
that they will reach Hobvken, N. Y.,

warning issued to Bisbeeans yesterday
by Assistant Postmaster Presley. Ow
ing to the vast congestion of Christ
mas mail, both first-class and parcel
post, this minimum of time is required
to insure the American figh'ors still
left on the other side getting (heir re
membrances, both letters ctnd par

some days for the mail to cross the
continent to New York, all Bisbeeans
intending to send gifts to soldiers are
urged to act at once.
