READY TO ACT
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8. After
three days spent In organization, the
industrial conference called by Presi
dent Wilson will come to a show
down tomorrow on the business to be
transacted.
Only a brief session. "Was held to
day, adjournment being taken to per
mit the groups representing capital,
labor and the public to formulate
such suggestions and proposals as
they wish to submit for consideration.
None was ready for submission today
except the preamble of a resolution
to be Introduced by Charles S. Barrett
of Georgia, representing the Farmers'
Union. The resolution will demand
a comprehensive national agricultural)
policy. The preamble asserted the
farmer were not being given due con
sideration 1 nthe present conference
and the failure of any attempt to set
tle national questions without the
consent of the agricultural element
of the population was predicted.
Apparently with an agreed unan
imity o faction not otherwise char
acterizing the deliberations, the three
groups refused to discuss specifically
what was under discussion or what
would be presented to the conference.
Each group was understood to be
ready with definite proposals on in
dustrial problems affecting domestic
peace, the labor group especially hav
ing a complete program already for
mulated, it was reported, but each
seemingly was waiting to see what
the others were going to do before
showing its own hand.
From the public group came the
authoritative intimation that the
members representing the "innocent
bystands" in the war between capital
and labor were prepared to abandon
the attitude of watchful waiting and
benevolent neutrality which they at
first thought was their best policy.
Not only were several concrete prOi
posals said to be in the making, but
the group sent to the shipping board
for documents dealing with the Amer
ican and English shipyards arrange
ments for adjusting wages and fore
stalling strikes by means of perma
nent committees constantly consider
ing grievances likely to cause indus
trial disruption. The opinion ia grow
ing that the public group, led by Ber
nard M. Baruch as chairman, will not
rest until the right and left divisions
of the conference accept some forward-looking
proposal to allay unrest
and maintain steady production.

INDUSTRIAL
CONFERENCE
OPPONENTS
OF
TREATY BLOCK
ALL PROGRESS
WSHINGTON. Oct. 8. Opponents
of the peace treaty today blocked all
attempts to bring the Shantung
amendment to a "vote in the senate
this week, and then refused to accede
to a joint request by Republican and
Democratic leaders for its considera
tion one week hence.
In the half hour' wrangle that fol
lowed the suggestion of Chairman
Lodge of the foreign relations com
mittee that the senate could speed
up the treaty by reading the printed
. . ,., ,,,.. . ,
icai v uiic ocuatui o nuc yi cpai tug
speeches on the Shantung provision,
the charge was made and denied that
a full-fledged filibuster soon might
envelo pthe pact and delay final ac
tion on It.
Earlier in the day Democratic lead
ers had declared that there was no
hope of a vote this week on Shantung
because Senator Borah, Republican,
of Idaho, had let it be known that he
would not give unanimous consent to
such a move before Senator Johnson,
Republican, of California, had re
turned from his western speaking
tour against the league of nations.
Taking account, therefore, of this
opposition,- and realizing that many
senators, including himself, wanted
to be heard, Senator Lodge said that
consideration would be expedited by
putting all spare time' on the job of
reading, a four day task at best, with
reading clerks working In relays.
Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska,
floor leader of the administration
forces, said the plan suited him, ex
cept that he would prefer a vote next
Wednesday or earlier on the amend
ments, which. Senator Lodge frankly
admitted was quiti Impossible.
Declaring thafbotS the country and
the senate were desirous of having
the treaty disposed of. Senator Un
derwood of Alabama declared that
the senate should not wait until next
week to vote on the Shantung amend
ment, when every senator knew now
how he would vote on the amendment
and the treaty itself.
It looked as if the senate was in
for a whirlwind fight, and while SenJ
ator Lodge had announced that he
would withdraw his request for unan
imous consent to call up the Shan
tung amendment next week. Senator
France, Republican, of Maryland,
standing directly behind him and
waiting to start a thirty-five thousand
word speech, shouted his objection.
This abruptly ended the discussion
and Senator France proceeded to
speak.
when the senate adjourned at 5
o'clock however the Maryland sena-i
tor had not concluded his address, the
rest of which will be delivered to
morrow. After the smoke of the little skir
mish had cleared away, leaders took
stock and found that for the next
week or ten days treaty consideration
would consist of set speeches and the
monotonous drone of the reading
clerks plowing through the printed
text.

CHICAGO, Oct. 8. Further activ
ity against radicals in Gary, the clos

trict. Military intelligence officers
rnd agents of the department of jus
tice held a conference today relative

inflammatory literature.
Federal troops in control at Gary
were exuected to remain an indefi
nite period and Col. W. S. Mapes in

bition against outdoor mass meetings,
said no interference with strikers' in
door meetings need be expected as
long as they were orderly.
Operations at Gary, South Chicago,
Indiana Harbor and Waukegan were
said to have been increased today, of
ficials reporting greater production.
Union leaders denied that production
had been advanced or that more
strikers had returned to work.

TOKIO, Oct. 8. (By The . Associ
ated Press!) Negotiations are under
way between the governments of the
United States and Japan concerning
the administration o fthe trans-Siberian
railroad. This has been made
necessary, it is said In high diplo
matic quarters, because of the fact
that interallied control of the railway
under the supervision of John F.
Stevens, head of the American rail
way commission to Russia, recently
has encountered many obstacles.
Following an official protest of sev
eral months ago by representatives
of the allies at Vladivostok against
Interference by General Semenoff. the
anti-Bolshevik leader in Siberia, there
apparently have developed frequent
misunderstandings between the Amer
ican and Japanese authorities and
troops concerning the conception of
what inter-allied management means.
Engineers under Mr. Stevens claim
that In the sector patrolled by the
Japanese forces they have not re
ceived the protection and co-operation
for which the original agreement provided.

WAGE, Fl PROFIT TO
E
UNREST, MINING GLASS TOLD
A talk on "Company Policies" was
delivered last night to the mining
class at the Y. M. C. A. by G. H. Dow
ell, manager of the Copper Queen
branch of the Phelps-Dodge corpora
tion. An audience that filled the au
ditorium, composed mostly of Copper
Queen employes, listened with inter
est to the outline given by their man
ager of the relations which the cor
poration desires to maintain with
those who work for it.
Mr. Dowell said that the talk would
apply particularly to the Copper
Queen branch of the Phelps-Dodge
I corporation. He aid in part: j
"The question of policies of the!
company, as I will discuss K, means
rule of action. It will be well to j
bear in mind the purpose for which'
industry is conducted; that is, tor'
profit. Shareholders have a right to
profits. It is a matter of common
knowledge that the more hazardous
the investment the higher the profits
should be." : Mining industries are
classed as hazardous investments and
should therefor return higher rates
of interest than the general run, .of
commercial enterprises. j
"No business enteprise, however,
is entitled to profits wfthoutconsid
eration of the welfare of its workers.
Profits should be figured only -with
due consideration for human wel
fare." !
The speaker announced that he
would discuss the company policies
from two points of view: (a) as af
fecting the community in general, and
(b) as affecting company employes.
' ' Community Welfare.
With regard to the first question
he said that the company had clearly
demonstrated its intention of assist-,
ine in every possible manner the wel
fare of the community. He pointed
' out thAt a considerable part of its
profits is expanded to this ena.
Mr. Dowell discussed the policies
of the company as affecting its em
ployes on five premises as follows:
1. The interests of the employes
and of the company are mutual.
2. A living wage anC a regular pay
check are essential.
3. For an employe to be satisfied
with his work he must have an op
portunity of self expression.
4. There ia a moral obligation on
the part of the company to provide
compensation for the.xest of tie life
of such employes as are incapaci
tated in its service. '
5. Every employe is entitled to a
square deal from the company, and,
vice vrsa, the company is entitled to
a square deal Trom each employe. ;
Speaking from the first premise,'
Mr. Dowell said: ' j
"If the interests of the company
and the employes are mutual, then
what affects one affects the other.
This raises an issue with radical la
bor, with the I. W. W. They say cap
ital and labor have nothing in com
mon. I say this is wrong and leave
it to the working man to decide. j
Keep Employe.
"Here, as the income of the com
pany increases, bo does that of the
employes. It is a big expense for the
company to break in new men. Also,
it is expensive for men to travel
about the country from place to place
in search of work. It is to eliminate
mitt waste mi&i iuc -vif"J
every effort to retain its men. ( j
nomic loss here and in other coun
tries is the instability of labor. It is
to avoid this waste that the company
gives a substantial bonus based on
length of service: Py the e;id .of tne
nii- it u.111 urnhuhlv . have naid
. bonuses to well over 1000 men. '
, i. ... . i .. i
The company mages .. suosiaiiuat
contributions, to the Employes Bene
fit association. The association paid
out $50,000 in death benefits and
S21.000 in sick benefits during the in-'
fluenza epidemic. This left the asso-'
elation with a deficit of $35,000, which
the company gladly made good. !
"During the first eight months of
this year $62,600 were lost in wages
by employes from sickness; $36,700 j
were lost in wages due to accidents
and
$92,700 through - misoelliuieous
couses." " . j
Speaking or the eiiects .or me com
pany to assist its employes to own
their own homes, Mr. Dowell said:
"For an employe to be most effi
cient he must be contented and hap
py. This Is impossible, particularly
for a married man, when he is sub
ject to the whim3 of a landlord. It
Is to the interest of both the company
and the employe that the latter
should own his own home. It is for
this reason that the company has
evolved a scheme whereby employes
may purchase homes on easy pay
ments." ' '
Wage and Living. -
Taking up the question of wages,
the second premises, Mr. Dowell said:
"The cost of living (should be given
consideration in - determining waprs.
The company is now paying $1.25 a
day over tlie original sliding scale
due to the increase in the coul of
living.
"I do not feel that thU covers the
increased cost of living, but you muut
remember that the co&t of pioduttioa.
, SOLUTION TO LABOR :
has also greatly increased and the
present wage scale represents a great
er percentage in the profits of the
company than formerly."
Speaking of the right of expression
and of individual achievement, Mr.
Dowell said:
"The pay check alone does not sat
isfy. Men cannot be treated as ma
chines. Every man is born with a
creative instinct and will not be sat
isfied without finding some expres
sion for it. To this end the company
gives extra pay for extra work on the
bonus plan. I feared at first that
this plan would -defeat its own ends,
that men would overwork. I found
that the same thing is accomplished
by a more intelligent application to
work rather than to greater physical
effort. There is a right way to do a
thing and a wrong way, and when it
is to his advantage a man is willing
to learn the right way.
'.'The same principle has been ap
plied to individual groups of men, as
on .team -shovel work. It can be ex:
tended to economy in supplies. There
is much waste that can be saved if
men are shown where they will get a
share in the saving. I hope this may
be worked out to apply to all under
ground work, but this is a complicated
problem.
"The tendency now is to give the
employe more and more say in the
-conduct of the business."
Pension Plan.
Speaking of the old age and disabil
ity pension, Mr. Dowell aid: "There
is no question of the obligation of the
employer to give some sort of recom
pense to disabled employes. This
gave rise to the present pension plan,
which I know is not perfect and which
may be improved upon in the future."
The matter of greatest importance
in the policy of the company ,l in the
opinion of Mr. Dowell, is that of what
the company terms the "Square Deal."
"It is necessary for every foreman
and boss to understand," said Mr.
Dowell, "that it is quite out of -the
question in so large an organization
for the manager to meet each fore
man daily. He must therefore rely
largely upon the foreman. The com
pany is judged by the treatment given
by its foremen to its men, so it is up
to thosd !n authority to administer
their authority with justice." It is
Often difficult to do jutice because all
the material facts cannot be obtained.
If a foreman is influenced by per
sonal motives he can't do justice any
way." Square Deal.
Mr. Dowell then outlined some of,
the qualifications which he consid-J
ered to be essential in foremen and
bosses if they are to carry out the
company's policy of a Bquare deal.'
Only 50 per cent, he aid, is allowed
for theoretical and practical knowl
edge l. considering -applicants for
positions as bosses. The other 50 per
cent is for ability to treat men in ac
cordance with the principle of the
square deal.
"So the men themselves may assist
in carrying out the idea of the square
deal the grievance committee has !
been formed."
In conclusion, Mr. Dowell said that
itis coming to be recognized more
and more that if the employes are to
be held responsible they must be
given a greater say, a greater repre
sentation in the industry.' He point
ed out that1 if this plan is successful
ia eastern concerns where a large
percentage of foreign speaking labor
is employed, that it should be practi
cal here. Even the man of radical
ideas, he said, if placed in a position
of authority would soon tend to be
come a conservative man. What the
final result of this tendency would be
he hesitated to predict.
Horse Sold English
Deserts to U. S.
DENVER, Colo., Oct. 8. James
Johnson, a former soldier, back to
his ranch at Granby, Colo., discover
ed while in service that, after all,
the world is just one big range.
When Johnson enlisted he was sent
to a remount station in California.
One day he came across a horse
lie had raised on his Colorado ranch
and sold in 1915 to a British army
buyer for shipment to Canada and
from there overseas. How the horse
got in Uncle Sam's army was some
thing Johnson could not understand.
Investigation disclosed that the horsy
had failed to pass inspection and
had been sent to the Pacific coast,
where it finally came into jwsses
sion of the California national
guard. It had served on the bor
der during the Mexican trouble in
1916 and a year later it was with
I lie California guard whenjt went
into the service to help win the
world war.
"It was like meeting a member of
fine's own family after long separa
tion." Johnson told a bunch of men
it the stockyards while here this
v.e&k with a bhipuient of llvebtook.
TAG, YOU'RE IT
"Tag, you're it," seems 10 be the
motto in the game the supervisors are
following in the appointing of a new
highway commission ,to succeed the
former one (which noiieirs &
Adams are trying to oust, but the old
commission are refusing to be ouestei
by the aforesaid gentlemen.
Among those, who it is said, have
refused to be second choice in the mat
ter of being highway commissioners,
are the former political henchmen and
supporters of Adams & Roberts, name
ly, Messrs. Tony Downs, O. S. French,
Johnny Hart of Douglas, and W. B.
Robinson. All of these gentlemen re
fuse to 'take office, it is said, on two
grounds : Firstly, because they are see
on choice by Robert and Adams, and
secondly because they do not like to
take an office that has a string at
tached to it,as they claim that any
one who accepts the position must be
bound by a promise to do certain
things. Even the ex-political supporters
do not like to be told "Thumbs Down"
and "TLumbs Up" by the supervisors,
after they are appointed And supposed
to he an independently functioning
body.
So the chase goes merrily on and
who will be "It", is still undecided, and
Roberts and Adams continue the hunt,
so far unsuccessfully. . Their efforts to
re-estabjish themselves in the good
graces of their erstwhile friends by
offers of appointment are to no avail
and the offers., it is said, have been
scorned. In the meantime while hunt
ing for1 new board, Adams & Roberts
apparently will have their hands full
in relegating the former board .to the
discard as legal talent has ueen em
ployed and the matter will be aired
in the courts. It is not at all likely
that Adams and Roberts will find one
too many boards on their hands after
the smoke of the battle has cleared
away.

When the United States transport
Pocahontas, formerly the German
liner Prinzesse Irene, sailed a few
nights ago for Rotterdam she cai
ried 1731 German prisoners of war,
spies, agents, officers and sailors who
had been interned in prison camps.
Sixty-five wives and children of the
men returned voluntarily, and eight
een "mental , cases," due to the mo
notony o fcamp life, were with the
party.
They had arrived at Hoboken in
Pullman cars, cheering and singing
German songs. On the cars were
chalked such mottoes as "Heim" and.
"To Hell With the. Kaiser," and one
large picture of a foaming stein was
labeled "Auf Weidersehen." Almost
every car bore reference to beer.
More than three hundred New, York
Germans, friends of prisoners, had
come to the reception pavilion, where
they were allowed to meet their
frieads, an army guard being present.
They brought great bundles of cakes,
candy, cigars and soap- adding to the
tore seach man already carried.
Pretty girls stood outside the iron
railings of the incloure and talked in
flowing German to the prisoners, . 25
feet away. Many swapped names
and addresses, and Hans Mannbeiiu
of Nuremberg threw out his photo
graph and address to one of the girls.

Captain Zuckschwerdt of the Como

two being E. von Carlshausen, Ger
man naval lieutenants, and Emit
Italiener of Brooklyn, formerly a re
porter on the New York Staats-Zei-tung.
Both men were interned as
spies.
"I have been in Camp Douglas,
Utah, for two years," said Italiener.
"I am a loyal American and hope to
return to this country next spring.
Many of the prisoners, you know,
have been forbidden to return, but
they say I can come back.

'JAPAN NEVER
IILL RETURN
SHANTUNG'
TACOMA, Wn.. Oct. 8. China's
chances of regaining: the Shantung
peninsula through future action of
the league of nations, if ' adopted as
now drawn, would be remote, United
States Senator Hiram W. Johnson told
a crowd which Tiiled Tacoma's largest
theater today.
The very four nations which took
Shantung from China, the California
senator asserted, would vote on the
question of its return. . T
PresMent Wilson's signature to the
peace treaty in Taris marks the first
time the United States ever despoiled
another country or broke its word to
a friend, he declared.
Japan took more of China's rights
in Shantung1 than Germany ever
thought of taking, he insisted, and
pointed out that the single vote of
Japan could block the return of the
peninsula to its former owner.
"Do you 'think Japan will vote to
give It up?" the senator asked and was
answered by laughter from the aud
ience. Introducing Senator Johnson at the
theater, Mrs. Emma Smith Devoe de
clared Senator Johnson was lifting the
ideals of the nation to a loftier con
ception of Americanism and hailed
him as "the next president."
The senator declared that the
American people had approved when
the president went to Paris, but later
were grieved to see "the flabbiness of
his good intentions yield to the cyni
cism of European diplomacy."
The United States, he declared, was
forced to yield to the distributions of
lands and peoples agreed upon by our
European co-belligerents before this
country ever entered the war.
. "What we rebel against and what
we say shall not be," asserted the sen
ator, "is that your blood and my blood
shall guarantee to the British and Jap
anese empires for all time the posses
sions they have gained from past treat
ies" from the war!"
"This is not a league of nations; it
doeB not touch the people, but forms
an oligarchy of power to make this na
tion bear the . burdens of all those
other nations which profited by the
war. My position is that this country
ought not to go to war except at the
behest of the American congress and
the American people. .
"Last week in Omaha I saw a re
cruiting siga stating that 50,000 sold
iers were wanted for service in Eu
rope. That's the league of nations for
you; taking khaki-clad boys across the
sea. You're not going to Americanize.
Europe by sending soldiers there. You
are going to Europeanize America.
When they talk to you about disarma
ment under the league they do not
mean disarmament tor this country.
They mean that the United States will
supply, the deficiency of all the other
nations."';
Just !one nation, Senator Johnson
declared, 'was not represented, "except
perhaps by men - with misty concep
tions of internationalism."
"We ; were there," he declared,
"with "beautiful pnrases, eloquently
pieced together. The others knew just
what they wanted and when it was all
over we' had still our eloquent phrases
and they had just exactly what they
wanted.
"I have observed recently that those
who talk most of the fatherhood of
God and the brotherhood of man, are
most intolerant of those who talk just
plain pure Americanism." '
Senator Johnson left for Seattle,
where he is to speak tonight.
Before departing for Seattle, Sena
tor Johnson said:
"When I was told back In Wash
ington that people out here were in
favor of ratification without reserva
tions or amendments, I could not be

these reports were untrue. There is
the same underlying sentiment in all
parts of, the country.
"We all agree with the lofty senti
ments expressed by our president and
with his splendid idealism," the sena
tor later declared to the press. "The
difference' is, however, that out here
on the Pacific coast we have written
our ideals into laws."
Persons of all shades of political be
liefs were among those to extend to
the senator his first welcome to Wash
ington. .
SEATTLE, .Wash., Oct. 8. Two Se
attle audiences tonight heard Senator
Hiram W. Johnson explain his objec
tions to the ratification of the league
of nations covenant without reserva
tion or amendment.
' They heard the senator explain that
his, proposed amendment to the
league covenant would not deprive
the colonies of Great Britain of their
six votes but would give America an
equal voice in the assembly of the
league and they cheered his declar
tion that "The United States senate
is going to stand up and be counted"
when this amendment comes, to a
vote. -
The senator praised the foresight
and cleverness of Premier Lloyd
George in gaining additional territory
and population for his nation out of
the war, and declared England first
had tied up the United States with
alliances and then had "tied up
the league of nations for all time" by
securing representation and voice for
each of the colonies as an Individual
unit.
Senator Johnson made the trip from
Tacoma during the afternoon on the
yacht of Samuel Perkins, Republican
national committeeman.
Dr. Harry Suzzalo, president of the
University of Washington, introduced
Senator Johnson tonight at the meet
ins held at the arena. At the second,
or over flow meeting, at a nearby the
ater, the senator was introduced by
Harry Dentoa Moore, president of
the local League for the Preservation
of American Independence. It was
estimated that the capacity of the two
meeting places was between nine and
ten thousand.

SAFETY OF "UNION" AT STAKE
THE .STEEL strike has thrown, 400,000 men out of work.
The point at issae is the refusal of the steel company to
recognize the union in preference to any other honest Ameii
can workman..
The fight is on for the closed shop whereby a free man in
America must join a class organization before he can work and
an employer is denied the right of hiring a competent workman
who does not belong to such an organization.
This is not a fight on union ideas, it is a fight for the pre
servation of freedom of the individual in America.
If by superior arguments all the steel workers can be in
duced to join the union, there is no reasonable grounds for com
plaint and if the union and the steel company fail to settle griev
ances the union members have the American privilege of striking.
But when the union says to the steel company "you must hire
none but members of, our union," it is going too far, as it thereby
attempts to set aside the very rights guaranteed by our consti
tution to every man, woman and child in this nation.
Labor organizations have had the sympathy of the public in
their endeavor to better living, working and. wage conditions but
these organizations have become drunk on their own power1 until
today if their slightest demands are not granted, they do not hesi
tate to jeopardise the very safety of the nation to gain then
point. Thepu blic has seen the danger in the threatened rail
road strike when our country was at war, it has) seen it in the
shipyard strikes during the war and in countless other strikes to
enforce arbitrary demands during the nation's peril. It has seen
the menace growing and has now witnessed the workmen in the
steel industry reject even the President's request that they with
hold action until after the conference called to assemble in W'asn
ington early In October to try and establish a basis of conciliation
for all industrial disputes.
The nation as a whole is face to face with a radical labor
autocracy which threatens to crush and destroy with as ruthless a
hand as did ever German military autocracy.
. If labor unions cannot exist without denying the right of
working, to a man who does not belong to some particular union,
oi without demanding that an employer hire none but certain
specified union members, it is time this class of unions were
eliminated else they will destroy, the very foundation principles of
this government.
If a man can" be forced to join a certain union or class or
ganization before an employer is allowed to hire him, it is only
a step farther until he can be forced to join a designated church
or political party as a condition precedent to getting a job.
Ours is a government for all the people, not for any class, or
priviliged few.
When a handful of labor dictators demand the right to tell
a man where and when he can work and an employer whom he
may employ, it is time that honest laboring men as well as every
other citizen with the best interest of his country at heart, ex
press his disapproval of such acts.
The Boston police strike showed to what lengths these labor
dictators would go and the public received its first real taste of
what to expect if such policies go unreckoned.
The issue is clean cut in this case. If the U. S. Steel Co. can
be forced to hire none but employes of certain union, it will' be
but a short time before every workman in this nation must
swear allegiance to some particular organization before he can
get a job and his allegiance to that union would have to como
before his allegiance to the Union of the United States, as has
been clearly proved in the management of the railroad unions,
the shipbuilders' unions, the attempted police union and numerous
others during and since the war.
One thing is suret the unions are ignoring the greatest force
in the world, the "force of public opinion.
Menaces of general strikes .industrial tie-ups, helplessness to
thuggery, do not make us afraid; they make us angry.
The Kaiser learned his lesson; the unions must learni theirs.
I. W. W. PROGRAM IN THE WEST
NSIDE information goes to show that fifteen hundred "dele-
1 gates", or I. W. W. organizers are to be concentrated in Cal
ifornia and next spring sent north.
The following is copy of an excerpt from a letter writteu
by J. A. Billings, one of the I. W. W. leaders, to Otto Eisner, an
I. W. W. prisoner confined in Leavenworth Penitentiary who was
sent up from Sacramento last year. This will give an insight as
to what the I. W. W.'s contemplate doing.
"I am of the opinion that the only way to win Cali
fornia is to "bunch our hits". That is, to place 1300 or
1500 delegates into that state, let them have a chance to
organize themselves into a system and work together un
derstanding. Thus covering the whole state simultaneous
ly and thoroughly organized at the start, so they can work
it under a thorough and sweeping system.
"After harvest is over in the long straw belt, all the
A. W. O. and most the delegates of other unions could
be moved enmasse to California, work there until spring,
then move the whole bunch to the lumber woods of the
Northwest until June, then back into the long straw belt,
and thus bunch our working force instead of working with
a scattered force. That force, so centralized, would work .
i . in unison and lwith mure harmony because their numbers
. would be encouraging them to go ahead freely, do up the work as
quickly as possible, and then get out of that state, before they, (the
dicks) can have time to realize what is being done in other words.
Mass action pure and simple.

Here and There in Arizona
NEW ARIZONA NATIONAL"
GUARD TO BE ORGANIZED
PHOENIX, Oct. &. Organization, of
the new national guard of Arizona
is expected to be effected, it was
stated here today by Governor Camp
bell, j
The goven.or received a letter i
j from Major General J. M. Carter, an
nouncing the national guard of this
state, would consist of a squadron of
cavalry and a battalion of field ar
tillery. The guns will be horse
drawn. Governor Campbell was noti
fied that he should make arrange
ments ' direct with the commanding
officer of the Southern department,
Fort Sam Houston, Texas, as to the
federal inspection of the guard
units necessary before they can ob
tain federal recognition.
The old-fashioned man who used to think about "putting 'em on
about this time is piob-ibly ouly postponing it for a while.
EXPERTS MOBILIZE TO
FIGHT BOLL WEEVIL.
TUCSON, Oct. 8. The possibility
that the federal government might
quarantine all cotton production in
this part of Pima county, because of
boll weevil discovered in the wild
cotton in the Santa Rita and Cata
lina mountains, stirred the board of
Supervisors yesterday at the month
ly meeting.
The supervisors appropriated $1000
to fight the weevil in its present
environment, the state horticultural
board promised $500 for the work,
and Governor Campbell, over thi
lbng distance telephone from Phoe
nix pledged to secure a contribution
of $1,000 from the state contingent
fund, if he and the attorney gen
eral could find a way to get it. Tha
Phoenix Cotton Growers' association
pledged one dollar for every two
dollars Pima spent.
The possibility of Pinal county cot
ton growers aiding in the extermina
tion of the weevil, in its first ap
pearance in the state as a menace
to the latest cotton acreage, was
discussed by Governor Campbellv with
Supervisor Nathan. The latter was
of the opinion that the county would
aid in the fight which must be made
if Pima county is to develop cotton.
The presence of the boll weevil in
the tiburon' weed, in the Santa Rita
as well as in the Catalina moun
tains, has been known for several
months. The facts came before the
supervisors yesterday for the first
time, when Dean Working headed a
delegation from the University and
members of the state horticultural '
boird.
various phases of the situation.
The latest letter from the war de
partment to Adjutant General In
galls contains"-several points of in
terest to those who are following
the course of events along th. line.
in the first place authorisation is
extended for the organization of na
tional guard units to consist of one
squadron of cavalry inade up of four
troops and one battalion of field
artillery consisting of three batteries.
The field artillery battalian will
consist of field artillery and will be
horse drawn, and will be equiDped
with 75 m.m. guns, according to the
letter which adds a request that the
adjutant general arrange for the
necessary inspection for federal rec
ognition, direct . with the command
ing general of the southern depart
ment at Fort Sam Houston, Texas.
According to tentative plans the
cavalry troops will be assigned to
Yuma, Phoenix, Safford and Tucson,
and the batteries to Phoenix, Flag
staff and Tucson.

A bargain was struck' for the re

A few minutes after the man left

missing out of his window display.
A- little later he saw his customer
on the other side of the street,
"Come over to the store and give
me that gun you took out of my
window," demanded Shusher.
The man protested but followed
Shusher into his store.
"You put down $22 for that gun "
demanded Shusher, "or you go to

The man put the money on tha
desk. 1
"Do I get the money when I brin?

"Sure you do," 'said Shusher.
At a late hour the stranger had

"I don't care," said Shusher. "I

want it. I got his money."

VICTORY YESTERDAY MADE
ROUS CONTENDERS
THEM DANGE
FOR WORLD'S SERIES PENNANT
CINCINNATI, Oct. 8. Winning to
day's game against Cincinnati 4 to 1,
the recently dejected and all but hope
less White Sox now consider them
selves real contenders for the world's
baseball championship.
The series now stands four games
for Cincinnati and three for the Chi
cago White Sox. Tomorrow, weather
permitting, they play in Chicago. The
athletes of the pallid hose took the
train i tonight jubilant at the manner
in which they have snatched a chance
of victory from what seemed certain
and Roush hit to Collins, who threw
to Weaver, forcing Rath.
Reds Threaten.
In the second the Sox were bowled
over in short order, without getting
a man to first. The Reds did a little
better, for after Duncan had flied out
to center, Kopf singled, but was
caught - stealing on Schalk's perfect
throw. Neale fouled out to Weaver.
Cincinnati, by virtue of a single, and
It was not until the fifth inning that
a base on balls, got a man safely to
second. The Sox. however, got an-
defeat, and were determined that the j other run in the thlrd Johany Collins
eigntn contest, piayea on tneir own
familiar real estate and cheered by
their loyal following will see the
series tied up.
The serio-comic affair of yesterday t
was succeeded today by real baseball.
The Sox earned two of thoir tallies
by conscientious workmanhip, and
this was enough to win, while the
other two counts canie partly 'by
grace of Red errors. Four misdeeds
weer charged against the Cincinnati
team, and but one against the Comis
key entry.
Cincinnati trotted out piach hitters
and pinch runners in a desperate en
deavor to come up from behind, as
the Sox did yesterday, but all to no
avail. The Reds used three pitchers
Sallee, Fisher and Luque and an
other pitcher, Ruether, appeared as an
emergency batsman. Despite the ar
ray of hurlers the Sox accumulated
ten hits, while the National leaguers
were, able to pole out but even. i
Cicotte Comes Back
Kddie Cicotte, who was driven from
the box in the first game of the se
ries, and lost his second game be
cause his teammates couldn't hit any
thing, came into his own in this after
noon's attraction. He exhibited con
trol, speed and, judgment, and his
comrades played with a confidence,
properly tempered and qualified by j
recent severe lessons, and a dash
that reminded their clientele of their
best mid-season form.'1
The narrowing ot Cincinnati's mar
gin of victories caused serious consid
eration of the possibility of a ninth
game. Cincinnati won the toss taken
immediately after today's engagement j
ar.u tile deciding contest, if Chicago
evens things up tomorrow, will bo
played here next Friday. , President
John A. Hedler of the National
league, tossed the coin and Mr. Herr
mann guessed it would be tails,- and
tails it was.
For the first time in the series
many seats were vacant, due, it was
said, to the general belief, that seats
would be difficult to obtain. Every
body expected that everybody else
would be ahead ot them and the re
sult was a half crowd in the left field
bleachers, many vacancies in those in
the right and little unpopulated1
patches even in the grand stands.
Usually the official attendance figures
are ready during the game, but a
half hour after the last out today
none were at hand, and it was an
nounced that they would not be ready
for an hour. Just what went wrong
was not stated, ' but it was not be
cause the crowd came too fast to be
counted.
Stiff Wind Blowing.
A stiff wind was blowing from cen
ter across the plate during the strug
gle. When the Sox came on the field
the band, which on the Red grouncs
always has some little musical sar
casm at hand, played "She May Have
Seen Uelter Days," and "Pltase Go
Way and Let Me Sleep."
This did not impair the buoyancy
of the slandered athletes, wno retali
ated without delay by putting a run
over in the first inning. It was John
Collins, the first batter up, wJio made
the count. He singled to center and
went to second on a sacrifice by Ed
Collins. Weaver slammed the ball
against the wind for an out to center,
but Joe Jackson, who was desperate
at having found no new lucky'omens
in the way of hairpins, singled to left,
scoring j. Collins. "Happy" Felsch
also delivered a single, on which
Jackson took second, but Felsch was
forced at second by Gandil's bounder,
ending the asault for the moment.
In their half the home team took
heart whi-n Ed Collins juggled Rath's
sizzling grounder. The crowd, which
was less vociferous than usual, yelled
for the aviator to come and meet the
Sox going up, but it was a vain
prayer, for Collins redefined himself
by going way nack and taking Dau
bert's fly, the mighty Groh struck out
again making the count.
Collins, who played center ro;
Fel3ch while Felsch went to rlgtit
field, whore the sMn is not to trouble
some, was the first man up. He de
livered his second single as if he
were playing billiards. The bari
slipped off Sallee'8 mitt, caromed off
Kopf and finally got to Rath too be
lated for a play at first. Ed Collins,
who was unable to deliver a hit in
similar circumstances in the first,
now hit sharply to center, sending his
namesake to second. Weaver sent a
grounder to Kopf, who threw it to
Rath for a forced out of Ed Collins.
Rath claimed that the runner inter
fered with his throw to first for a
double and Weaver was called out for
the interference. J. Collins mean
while reached third and scored on
Jackson's hit.
In the fourth Schalk sandwiched
a single in between the outs but nevei
got further tha nfirst. In the fif:n
the Sox registered their final brace of
tallies. Sallee in this round was
driven fro mthe box and the remain
ing two-thirds of the inning was
pitched by Fisher.
Wingo Walks Again.
J. Collins started unau.spiciously by
flying out to right. Captain Collins
again singled. Weaver rolled one to
Groh, who let it get through him and
Weaver reached first and Collins sec;
ond. Groh's error and that whica 101
lowed by Rath were costly. Jackson
drove a bounder to the Red seconu
and the bases were filled. In this ex--baseman,
who made a fumble or rt
citing crisis, Felsch, who Is frequently
called upon to sacrifice, was orcered
to hit. He singled to center and Ed
ollins and Weaver scored. Gancrt re-,
lieved the strain on the Reds by going
out. Fisher to Daubert.
In their half of this round Cincinnati
contrived to get a man on second for
the first time. Kopf, the first man
at the plate, flied out to Jackson.
Neale singled and walked to second
when Wingo was given a walk. Win
go became quite a pedestrian. during
the contest, as he was given free pas
sage three times and he attained a
batting average of 1000 by delivering
a hit . in the ninth. Confronted for
the first time with men on first and
second, Cicotte tightened. Ruether
made a brief appearance as a pinch
hitter for Fisher and fouled out to
Weaver. Rath 6hot a grounder at
Weaver and was thrown out at first.
Tiie sixth inning produced the one
lone tally accumulated by the Reds.
Daubert struck out, but Groh, smart
ing in self accusation because of his
recent record of error, whaled the
ball over the temporary fence in left,
but, because of ground rules, what
would have been a triple or a homer,
went for a double. Cicotte threw
Roush out at first, Groh going to
third. Duncan singled to center and
Groh scored. Duncan was forced at
second by Kopf's grounder..
In their half of this round, J. Collins
doubled after two were down, but the
Cuban, Luque, now pitching for Cin
cinnati, struck out Captain Collins
and the chance went glimmering.
The Cuban, in the seventh, fanned
Weaver and Felsch, while Jackson
died on an infield smash.
In the eighth and ninth the Cuban
pitched splendid ball, striking out
Cicotte and retiring the batsmen, one,
two, three, with little apparent ef
fort. Cicotte was not menaced again un
til the ninth. Kopf and Neale had
been retired on flies when Wingo
ingled to right. Sherwood Mage-1
batted for Luque and alto singled. If
Rath, the next batter, could have!
poled out a home run it would have
tied the score, but his attempt in this i
line went no farther than Felsch'si
mitt.
It was not until the crowd had
worked its way from the grounds'
back to town that It learned how,
small the attendance really was,;
namely, 13,923, which was less than;

STOCKS AND BONDS.
NEW YORK, Oct. 8. Operations in
the stock market today were again
very large and expansive, but the tone
was more convincing in the absence
of the bewinJering fluctations which
characterized recent dealing.s Several
of yesterday's erratic issues were again
prominent, at new high records, but
they were eclipsed by impressive
strength of standard industrials, a
sharp revival of interest in steels and
coppers being the most noteworthy
feature.
Buying of the latter issues probably
. resulted from the more encouraging
trade surveys or reviews, while the
metal market displayed firmer tenden
cies. Demands for steels, which reached
Its height in the final hour, was pre
ceded by another advance in motors,
Including several of the low priced
Issues; also by a better tone for those
equipments most dependent on the
stabilization of the steel industry.
At their best, quotations of steels
and coppers were 2 to 4 points higher.
Equipments also gained 1 to 3 points.
In sharp . contrast to it3 recent
course, call money opened at 9 Per.
cent, that rate' prevailing until the
last half hour when loans dropped to 6
per cent.

LIFTING
BAN
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8. Officials
of the Anti-Saloon League of Amer
ica, fearful in the face of persistent
rumors, that the wartime liquor ban
may be lifted before ratification of
peace, have Issued a statement de
claring that such an act would be
in violation of the law and "crime
against civilization and the coming
generation.'
In an effort to concentrate public
opinion against the lifting of this
war-time ban by executive authority,
the Anti-Saloon League officials
point out that the result of such a
course would be to fill the homes
of the country with whisky during
the open period before constitution
al prohibition sets in next January:
that drunkenness would be multi
plied and "the unrest and lawless
ness which now prevails would be
aggravated" with disastrous conse
quences. ;
Predictions of liquor inflamed
mobs': destroying life and property
are made by the league leaders, who
Insist that the plea of necessity for
opening the saloons to protect bank
ers loaded with liquor warehouse
certificates should fall on deaf ears. . Range 25-E, G. & S. R. B. & Meridian,
"If saloons reopen " says the An-1 has filed notice of intention to make
ti-Saloon League statement,
the peace treaty is ratified and de
mobilization Is completed, tbey will
do so In defiance of the war pro
hibition act." It -was presumed, of
course, that the peace treaty would
be .ratified before demobilization ter
minated, but the law says there are
two conditions precedent to the de
termination of war prohibition. The
first is the ratifying of the treaty
and thereafter the termination of the
demobilization. If two conditions
are fulfilled, no one can justly com
plain, even, though the reopening of
the saloons for a few weeks will be
a catastrophe. The only way to le
gally avert this would be to place
a prohibition tax on liquor. An ac
count of the shortness of the time
this method seems to be impractical."

HOW I BECAME A PRIMA DONNA
By ROSA PONSELLE
Leading Soprano, Metropolitan Opera House
New YorkXity
CHAPTER IV My First Vaudeville
Appearances.
My first actual contract which t
chared with my sister Carmella it
provided we should appear together
was a most Important document.
in my estfmatlon. I knew we had
pleased the managers we had sung
berore when I causrht sieht of Car-
mella's face, as she came into our
isew York home.
"Well, we got it," she exclaimed,
and flourlshel the long sheet or paper
over ner head.
The salary was comparatively
gooa ror what is known as "small
time" vaudeville. To me the share
I was to receive seemed a very large
sum. But I tried not to be too op
timistic. I sensed, In some vague
way, that the work would be hard
anu sometning we neither would be
content to follow for long. It was
the experience part of it that at
tracted me chiefly, as I look back
on the event.
Right away we set to arranging
tne act so it would be letter per
feet for our debut.
Although my voice is pronounced
a genuine dramatic soprano, I was
not singing as such at that time.
My low tones were naturally round
and full, and I liked to sine thpm
I had a remarkable facility In the
mgn notes, yet I did not imagine for
a moment that I was other than a
mezzo-soprano. Carmella (who is a
genuine mezzo-sporano) was then
singing as a soprano; so we were
both moving in wrong- wavs. T ri.i.
say the fact that Carmella was con
sidered the soprano singer of the
family, together with the TIQ film 1
sombreness and strength of my low
notes, caused me to look nnim my
self as a mezzo-soprano. At all
events, I had sung music for this
type of voice, and in our duets I
always took the lower part.
Ior were we tho onlv ones do.
Ceived in that most Important mm.
ter of classification of our voices.
The first singing-teacher who tried
our voice!" did not correct our v..
lief. Carmella felt it wise to study,
and after being recommended to this
nuxa nUt in-sns-wl for lessons, which I
she took when our work in vaude
ville took us to New York, or dur
ing our vacations.
Some time alter Carmella began
studying I followed her lead; but I
was not Impressed with what the
instructor undertook to teach. H
no doubt understood teaching;
probably I did not comprehend -what
it was he wished me to do. Nor did
Carmella make the progress she ex
pected she would.
During the course of our fir3t year
in vaudeville I had about ten les
sons; Carmella few more than that.
Then, automatically. I guess we
stopped studying with this teacher.
Fut the singing we did in the the
atres in different parts of the coun
try seemed to please th pndiences:
for our salarv. in the second ve.ir.
was advanced. - -
As I . look back upon those di-st
days In vaudeville I realize how dan-
gerous my position was. In a strictly
vocal way. it is easy enough, after
experience, to say what one would
do if the experience could be re
peated. But that, as we know.
doesn't happen. And that, is whv I
believe every young singer who ia
considering seriously a sinking ca
reer should give the utmost care be
fore deciding it to be the right thing
to do. ' ' i
I appreni.ote that su-rsestlons nrn
seldom welcomed, even when one
who seeks them gi ves assurance of
an open mind. Particularly if the

Y. W. C. A. last night for practice.
One look was enough yesterday for
Dr. C. L. Edmindson. rmmtv voit.

officer, to determine, that the place
run by B. F. Faust on Naco road,
which was raided Tuesday by county
officers who say they found a quan
tify of liquor in the process of manu
facture there, would not be allowed
to exist in its present condition of
filth.
Federal officers also investigated
the place yesterday and seized six
barrels of rotting fruit with which
it is alleged F?.ust was making a pow
erful brew. He declares that he
makes vinegar of It, "
With the combined action of the
health officer, the county officials and
the department of justice it is thought
that Faust can be put permanently
out of business. According to the
officers he has been arrested regular
ly every few months in the past on
charges ranging from bootlegging to
receiving stolen goodsl
Dr. Edmindson declared that
Faust's entire place must be cleaned
out. The front part of the establish
ment is used as a store, but the health
officer said that nothing in the place
was fit to eat except the canned
goods. Articles such as bread and
cheese were covered with flies and
dirt.
In the back room the officers say
liquor was being distilled from rotten
fruit, in surroundings of indescribable
filth.
Besides charges of illicit traffic in
liquor, the officers say that Faust will
be charged with having a quantity
of stolen goods in his possession.
Emil Nicholoski, said to be Faust's
partner, was also arrested yesterday
for alleged conrplicity in Faust's op
erations. .
