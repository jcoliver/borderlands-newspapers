Villa Band Defeats
Moctezuma GaiTison
JUAREZ, Mex., Feb. 2?. Martin Lopez, Villa's sec
ond in command, swept down on the little railroad station
of Moctezuma in the dawn of yesterday, drove the federal
guard of 40 soldiers into the sand hills where they fought
for six hours, after Lopez ordered the railroad station
burned, the bridges on the railroad dynamited and occupied
the plaza.
Lopez ordered his own telegraph operator to -connect
with the military wire and intercepted messages sent ,by
General Jesus Augustin Castro from his military train here
to the general headquarters in Chihuahua City. .When
General Castro's operator asked the Moctezuma operator
who he was, he received in reply a volley of oaths over the
wire, after which the telegraph line went down.
General Castro announced tonight that he did not
know the fate of his small garrison at Moctezuma as noth
ing has been heard from there since the wire was cut. It is
expected here the 40 men and officers, were annihilated.
General Castro sent a work train and troop train north and
ordered another to proceed south tonight to locate the Villa
band. He does not anticipate an attack on the border town
here, although he is isolated from the south.

Artists of the district are engag
today in preparing window and
show case cards for the tobacco
dealers bearing these facts and
others. The cards will be display
ed March 15. when the new floor
tax on tobaccos will go into effect,
and when for the second time
since the United States entered
the war the prices on tobacco of
all character and variety will be
advanced. The floor tax this time
will be levied on wholesaler, re
tailer and jobber so that the en
tire stock of tobacco in the United
States will be effected.
The result will be a sharp ad
vance in prices. Cigarettes whic;a
in the past have sold for ten cents
will advance to 12r cents or two
lor 25 cents. Two for a quarter
brands will advance to 15 cents
straight- Fifteen cent brands will
become 20 cents or two for 35
cents, while 20 cent brands will
advance to 25 cents straight.
Cr.ewing tobacco will cost just
twice what it cost before the war,
or 20 cents for the old- time-honored
ten-cent plug. Two for a
quarter cigars will be sold for 15
cents straight, while the man who
has acquired the tasty habit of
two-hit smokes will pay 100 per

WASHINGTON. Feb. 27. Represen
tative Johnson of South Dakota, a lieu
tenant in the army during the war,
renewing; his attack in the house to
day on the present court martial sys
tem, charged tfc,at General Pershing
had refused to comply with an order
of the war department demanding the
return of all records of court martial
proceedings of cases of men sentenc
ed to death for review by the judge
advocate general.
Mr. Johnson declared that six men
of the overseas forces had been sen
tenced to death and that the sentences
would be carried out if some one did
not Intervene.
Must Examine Records
He said it would be impossible to
tell whether the death penalties were
justified until the records of the trials
were examined.
Mr Johnson urged passage by the
house of the Chamberlain bill provid
ing for a revision of the court mar
tia system, saying the existing mili
tary code did not permit of justice and
was tloffensive to any enlightened
sense of natural justice and to funda
mental principles of law."
The secretary of war has admitted
the unjust judgments of courts mar
tial during the war, Mr. Johnson said.

NO WORK OPEN HERE,
OUTSIDERS WARNED
Owing to the report having gone
abroad to the effect that the county
of Cochise is doing extensive road
work and that men are needed in this
county, an influx of unemployed seek
ing work here has commenced. Men
from California and other states are
coming to Bisbee and other places In
the county seeking employment, only
to be disappointed.
While Cochise county is doing road
work on a large scale, there is not
sufficient work of this-nature to care
for the unemployed men of this county
who are capable of doing this kind of
work. Men from the outside are warn
ed not to come to Cochise county look
ing for emnloyment on the public
roads, as they will not find it. Only
bona fide residents of Cochise county
will be employed in the construction
of roads in this county and all others
will do well to Keek elsewhere and

"His Bridal Night," Margaret Jdayo's
sparkling musical comedy i3 6ne of
the promised theatrical good things of
the year, andvill be presented at the
Grand theater Wednesday, March 5,
tne night only. It has tested the ca
pacity of all the theaters in the larger
cities. -His Bridal Night" is an in
genious farce in which one of two
twins Is married, quarrels with her
husband on their wedding day and
convinces herself that she loves an
other, whereupon the other twin, who
really loves the other young man pre
tends to be the bride, which causes
many somewhat risque complications.
These have been handled so skillfully
by Margaret Mayo, whose "Twin
Beds" is well remembered, .that they
give no offense. It was playeJ last
year as a straight farce, but the man
agement decided this year to make it
a musical comedy and engaged Mr.
Frederick V. Bowers, whose song hits i
cave made his name famous through
out the land, to write the music. The
twins of the play will be played by
the Sheridan Twins, whose wonderful
likeness and dramatic ability ably fit
them for the parts. John Roberts will j
play the husband. Others prominent!

RED CROSS WORK
IN SIBERIA TOLD
American Society Caring for
2500 Refugees; Many
Others Destitute
VLADIVOSTOK, Jan. 10. (Corre
spondepce of The Associated Press.)
The American Red Cross in eastern
Siberia through its refugee relief de
partment, is caring for nearly 2,500
refugees. Half of these are handled
directly through a distribution center
in Vladivostok. There are 400 bar
racks at First River, in the edge of
the eity. Further on, at Second river
are 300 Armenians in a barracks by
themselves. Most of these refugees
are receiving food nd clothing; there
are a certain number who are self-supporting
and only require lodgings.
A plan is being worked out to send
the Armenians to Port Said on a Jap
anese steamer. Efforts are also be
ing made to find transportation for
420 Serbians. Occupation has been
found for a large number of destitute
persons. An employment bureau has
been established and it is probable
that soon places can be found for all
those who wish to work. The Cana
dian military organization has asked
the Red Cross to man a steam laundry
for the Canadian troops. Likewise the
American army has made plans for a
service laundry at the base here which
will furnish employment ror a number
of laundresses.
Bishop H. St. George Tucker, who
recently returned from western Si
beria, where he went in the int
j of the Red Cross, reported that there
were some 8,500 persons there, legiti
mate objects for the Red Cross assist
ance, in need of immediate help. In
this number figure a group of Petro
grad children. Many hunureas of these
were sent to Siberia tor safety at a
time when the bolshevik outrages
were beginning. They were found in
seven different cities, unprovided for
and in great need. Clotning is being
provided for them from stocks in
Vladivostok and they are receiving at
tention. In Omsk, Novonikolaevsk and Chel
iabinsk, here typhus has made consid
erable headway,' the Red Cross is
working in conjunction with the Rus
sians to give medical relief. Relief
train No. 4 has left for the west car
rying medical supplies , and clothing.
The last relief train sent from here,
in charge of the Japanese Red Cross
unit, reached Omsk about a month af-
j ter leaving Vladivostok.
WOMAN IS REWARDED
WITH SERVICE CROSS
(By Revrew Lease! Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 27. The first
woman to win the American army's
distinguished service medal is Miss
Eeatrice McDonald of the reserve
nurse corps, who was seriously wound
ed wr.iie remaininsr at her nnst with
wounded men at a British casualtv
station during a German night raid.
Secretary Baker invited her to the
war department today to receive the
decoration with formal ceremonies.
Miss MacDonald's home is in New
York City. Her citation follows:
. "Miss Beatric MacDonald, reserve
nurse, army nurse corps, for extraor
dinary heroism while on duty with the
surgical team at the British casualty
clearing station number 61; British
aera. During a German night raid
she continued at her post of duty,
caring for the sick and wounded until
seriously wounded by a German bomb,
thereby losing an eye." '
Traffic Man Rewarded
At the same time the distinguished
service medal was awarded to H. M.
Adams, director of inland traffic, for
exceptionally meritorious and conspi
cuous service with the army of the
United States," and to nine officers of
the allied armies who have rendered
service in Washington in co-ordination
of military effort.
In presenting the distinguished ser
vice cross to Miss MacDonald. Secre
tary Baker asserted it gave him great
pleasure to say that the army of the
United States is under deep obliga
tion to the nurses who served so gal
lantly and so faithfully; that our
losses in this war were so slight, rela
tively, is undoubtedly due to the fi
delity, self-sacrifice and heroism of
the women of the nurse corps who
ministered to our wounded at the
front."

In Constant Fear of

VIENNA, Jan. 14. (Corre
spondence of the Associated

Hungary have reacned the stage
where the only hope of the ari
stocracy is that the entente pow
ers will send troops to Budapest
and to other parts of the country
to save them from the dreaded
enace cf bolshevism. Many o tne
former aristocrats have gone to

unsafe after dark and wealthy per

Budapest and other towns are re

Presccti.
A bill to purchase a site for a min
ers" hospital and put up a building
carrying a quarter million dollar ap-1
propriation, failed to pass the legis-'
lature. many members being of the
opinion that the state could not af
ford an appropriation of that size at
present, and that the need of the pres
ent did not demand an institution on
that scale.
President Johns, speaking of the al
ternative proposition, said: i
'There can be no doubt that the'
L state does need a miners" home pos-;
sibly to take care of 50 cases. Fori
the present this. need could be filled'
by building an addition to the state'
pioneers' home, where the same over-!
j head expense would take care of both
j institutions. I am in sympathy with
j the idea of Mr. Sealey's bill to pro
i vide for our sick miners, but such a
j large, appropriation as tiat required, I
i think, is beyond our needs and our
capabilities at present. However, 1 1

The Original Americans Now Our Allies.
In all the history of conquered races there has never been anything
to compare with the record of the American Indians in the great war.
A thousand enlisted in the nary and 6500 entered the army. Indians
now hold a $50 Liberty bond for every man. woman and child of their
race.
It is only six years since the Indians raised the American flag for
the first time when 22 chiefs representing 11 tribes met on Washington's
birthday and opened ground for the Indian Memorial in the harbor of
New York.
How thoroughly the axe was buried and the red race joined to us in
the melting pot, is reflected in the war record of an old-timer, Chief
Strongheart, who has folded his blankets and returned to the Yakama
Reservation in Washington. Strongheart toured the country, spoke in
many recruiting drives and. loan campaigns. He visited 216 military
posts and camps and entertained the doughboys with Indian legends.
That is a far cry from the battles of the Little Big Horn and the
capture of Osceola of the Everglades.
Columbus 427 years ago was the first of the white race to see a red
man. War, liquor and disease have thinned their ranks, but they are far
from extinct. A quarter million still exist from a sixth to half of their
numbers when America was discovered.
The white man's campaign was. bitter. The grandson of William
Penn offered a bounty of JJ134 for every Indian scalp.That they finally
joined us in the last great war dance is dramatic and significant of our
more kindly policy of later years.
To the science of warfare the American Indian brought a great con
tribution. He originated camouflage painting his body to blend into
the scenery and binding branches to his ponies to hide them among the
trees.
The American Indian, living to see world peace, may have been the
first man to wage war. Experts of the United States geological survey
believe that the first man appeared around Lake Superior in the world s
dim dawn. He brought forth the mound-builders, from whose stock
sprang the Sioux, Apaches, Ojibways and others of the 5S-language
tribes north of Mexico.
Other scientists think they came from China, through Siberia, cross
ing into Alaska. "Hank" Hill and other old-time Rocky Mountain scouts
and trappers claim there is a trail to Asia leading from the city of
Mexico through El Paso. Bozeman, Montana, and on via Saskatchewan.
Consider the romance of the red man Custer's massacre the buffalo
herds and at last his share in lighting the permanent pipe of peace.
To the new world being born at Versailles the American Indian's
share In the great war brings a message that racial hatreds can be
erased, that peoples oppressed and conquered in past centuries will, under
a policy changed to humaneness, forget their bitterness and antagonism
and gladly become an ally in the cause of mankind.
'Tis Said.
"'Tis said,"" by the Los Angeles Times, in a punctuated and illus
tratedvstory appearing in that organ on February 21, that Arizona is not
dry. Horrible! The Times, occasionally known for Its veracity and its
perspicacity, uncovers a terrible state of affairs in this wonderland of
ours and particularly in this staid, moral community of Tucson.
. Even the leading ladies, 'tis said by the Times, have joined the pro
fession of ancient and honorable league of liquor traffickers. Yes, the
California periodical enlightens us to the extent of telling how our leading
ladies pursue their calling. "They do say" that the wide, flowing -skirts
of our ladies furnish the camouflage for pockets in which may be found
half pint bottles of contraband whiskey. The Times further avers that
it is the favorite stunt of Tucson ladies to carry a "punch" with them to
their teas and to gathers the sheckles during the winter, in this manner,
that they may take it to the coast in the summer to spend. We might
remark that Los Angeles has never been particularly curious about the
manner in which Arizona money was secured, so long as the sucker
spent it and got a "splendid investment in return in the state of
California.
The Times wanders on and on. Douglas, Phoenix and Tucson are
brought forward for special attention at the hands of this scenario writer.
Everyone, 'tis said by the , paper, is "throwing dust into the eyes-of the
state officers, and getting away with it." ,
Concluding, this "lexicon of truth." printed in that chemically pure
city of "Los An-hay-les" says (and thereby spills the beans):
"tut now that the federal government has taken a hand in the
prosecution of the violators of the law that prohibits the transportation
of intoxicating liquor into dry territory, the famous outdor sprt is likely
to vanish.
For the benefit of the Times and such other folks in California who
are desirous of knowing, it is well to remark that the Reed Amendment
became a law during the first few months of 1917 and the federal gov
ernment has been applying this law in Arizona since that time. The
Times apparently is about two years late in finding out the fact.
Of course, we realize that some Times "staff writer and "cartoonist"
is responsible for the short column of patter, both of whom are probably
practicing for a soft birth with some embryo movie comedian. We did
not think, however, that the federal government was lax, in the city of
Los Angeles, Cafeteria, to the extent of allowing opium and the attendant
pipe to nourish so openly. Tucson Star.
Real Legislation.
The purpose of senate bill DO. by Mr. Hughes, is to clearly have the
legislature put a maximum limit on state expenditures and to destroy
power to create deficits or to create liabilities in excess of appropriations.
This is the sum and substance of the measure, considered by many
to represent the longest stride in constructive, tax conserving, state
advancing legislation that has been offered in an Arizona legislature.
It is big iu scope and certain of bringing results. There is no way
around for the spendthrift or the grafter. In the long run it will save
millions to the taxpayers. It win make highway and other appropria
tions as well as all income of the state 100 per cent efficient instead of
permitting the half results obtained in the past.
Under such a system as the Hughes measure provides incentive will
be given for better effort and better government, root and branch, in
the state. Likewise, incentive will be provided the taxpayer to view his
expenditures for state maintenance as well advised, because he will know
that the money will be carefully guarded. Tho latter result is sure
whenever those emptying the purse are heH to public accounting of the
purpose to which the money is to go and to show the results bargained
for when the money is allotted.
Senate bill So should receive unanimous vote in both houses. We
fail of seeing how any member of the legislature can decline to go on
record for it and retain any vestige of consideration as possessed of that
buintss: intelligence requisite to the performance of public duty. Ari

STATE'S TITLE TO
YUMA LAND DOUBTED
(Hy Review "Leueed Wi--
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Feb. 27. The
state's title to 100.000 acres of land
which was sold by auction yesterday
at Yuma may be clouded, according t
a telegram received by the lad board
from Secretary of the Interior Lane.
The message was received yester
day morning, according to State Treas
urer Harry Ross, while the sale was
in progress. It asked that the auc
tion be postponed as the federal gov
ernment might wish to include the
lands in the soldiers' and sailors, set
tlement scheme, and intimated that the
state's title might not be perfectly
clear.
Ross said today that the telegram
from Washington came too late to de
lay the sale. The land board felt, he
said, that to keep faith with men who
! had been interested in having the pat
! eras issuer, th ' auction would hav
I to go on. particularly since these men
had promised that if any part of the

HIGHWAY
MEASURE
HALTED IN HOUSE
FOR IIEIHLAUSES
Two Amendments' A d d e d,
While One Other Brings
Clash Similar to First
Drawing of Fartisan Lines
(By Review Leasee Vrire)"
PHOENIX. Ariz., Feb. 27. Senate
bid 17, the highway, bill which was
responsible last Tuesday for the first
real party clasli of the session in the
lower house of the legislature," was
brought out of the enrolling and en
grossing committee today and sent
back again for two amendments, after
democratic and republican leaders had
indulged in ' further partisan ex
changes. Two amendments carried and one
was lost. One of the changes which
will be made in the bill by the com
mittee was inserted by Eddy embody
ing another bill to provide for an an
nual levy of not less than $l,500,0ov
outside of automobile license receipts
and other sources of revenue for road
building purposes.
The other addition was a provision
to' embody a clause similar in effect
to the senate $200,000 extra roaa bill
to take advantage of federal aid.
Clash Over Commission
Mrs. O'Neill's amendment failed to
carry, but on it a stiff fight was made
by the republicans. It suggested that
the highway commission provided tor
in the bill be created along the lines
of the resolution adopted at the recent
state good roads convention, a .body of
five members, no more than three ot
whom should be of the same political
party and all appointed by the gover
nor with the consent of the senate.
The majority, however, killed it on a
vote of 21 to 12, thus leaving the
naming of the commisison to a board
composed of the governor, the state
treasurer, secretary of state, presi
dent of the senate, and speaker of the
house.
Speaking to the O'Neill amendment,
Galbraith said:
' "Matters in this house were harmon
ious ami party lines were not drawn
till malign political influences from
the senate began to make themselves
felt and some members permitted
themselves to be lc around by the
nose. Politics is at the bottom or the
trouble over this bill and politics
should be eliminated. Governor Camp
bell should be given the authority
which was put in his hands when he
was elected and that authority should
not be curtailed by this house."
"I do not believe the good roacs
convention intended to dictate to this
legislature how this bill should be
drawn,"' replied Lines. "I believe that
convention was interested primarily in
having highway legislation enacteii to
obtain good roads and to give employ
ment to returning soldiers and other
unemployed men. I further believe
that convention was willing to trust
to this legislature the working out of
the details. It is my opinion that a
commission of three men as provided
know who drew it up, ' but." said he, j F, y t
j "I am told that Lamar Cobb oppos ed flC?S Oil TCC tiOCll'U
! instance of politics exhibited in the i
I eood rnaris rnnventinn T il -i '
like to point oiit that the good roads
resolution i. not a suggestion, as ha
been stated. The men at that state '
convention knew what they wanted, !
and if you will read the resolution ycu
will find that they ask that this legis-;
lature do a specific thing, viz. appoint '
a highway commission of five mem- j
bers to handle road building." j
Sealey Protects Nose
At this point Sealey objected to Gal-!
braith's reference to members of the '
house being "led around by the j
nose," and intimated that no influ-l
ence in the country could dictate how J
his vote should be cast. 1
"The gentleman from Maricopa '
charges politicsis being played with J
mis Din, saia txiay, Dut it is very
odd that the only change he supports
is a political change, placing in the
hands of the governor the naming of
the highway commission. I am given ;
to understand that the- majority of
the good roads convention committee I
which drafted this resolution em- i
bodied in Mrs. O'Neill's amendment !
was republican and I want to say that ,
these republicans are not going to die- j
tate to this legislature. i
Lillywhite said he opposed the bill I
as it stood because it was not in ac
cord with legislation advanced in oth
er states.

kinson brought a bill into the sen
ate today to create an "Arizona
resources board," with a $10,000
annual appropriation to iuvesti
possibilities of . reclamation, . irri
gation and general development in
the state. The board would con

The senate killed the vocational
education bill, an amendment to
provide from $15,000 to $26,000 to

discussion of this , bill, Claypool
read a series of verses back

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Feb. 27. Except for a
slight slackening .of yesterday's rapid
pace, trading in stocks today differed
m no particular irom the general
trend of the early week. Rubber and
metor issues were again active and
mostly higher, the movements occas
ionally comprehending the more stable
issues.
Oils displayed persistent heaviness,
sustaining several reversals, but im
proved materially during tne final
hour.
United States Steel held first place
on a very lareg turnover, but closed !
unchanged after having risen a frac
tion to a new level for the, present
movement. Related shares make a
better showing, notably Crucible Steel
and American Car.
Metals were hifher as a croup. de-
veioping marked activity and strength j
despite announcement of a postpone
ment of the copper producers' meet
ing. Pools In tobaccos, "whisky" and
sugar stocks experienced little diffi
culty in advancing those issues.
High grade rails were firm to strong.
St. Paul shares weakening, but rally-
ing later, although the absence of a
quorum again preventea action on tne
preferred dividend.
Sales amounted
to S75.000 shares.
The bond market
was dull with

GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO, Feb. 27. Uncertainty as
to whether the hog price minimum
would be retained in March led to a
gooa aeat oi weasness toaay m ine
T rT" 1 1 1 . V.
corn market, ine close
a 1 1 Vi m trVi
steady ranged all the way from the
same as yesterday's finish to 2?sC
ower. with May $1,234 to $1.2334
and July $1.19H-'
Oats declined c to lc net and pro
visions 50c to $1.
Corn was offered very freely at
times, especially in the last part o
the day, inasmuch as many traders
looked for sharply lower prices in
the event that the hog minimum was
irepped. Numerous other dealers said
hey, too, expected depression, but
thit it would be only transient and
that the foreign demand for packing
house products would be so large that
values would perhaps go even higher
than at present. Threatened labor
trouble among the port workers in
New Y"ork was also construed as bear
ish on account of chances that trans
Atlantic food shipments might be cur
tailed and thus indirectly affect de
mand for corn. Efforts to rally the
msrket resulted only in bringing out
increased offerings, but shorts took
profits during the last 15 minutes.
Oats followed corn down grade.
Pork, lard and ribs all suffered
maximum decline, selling was chiefly
irom nouses with stockyard connec
tions.

MANY PROSPER FROM
OIL BOOM DECLARES
FORMER BISBEE MAN
How millionaires are made over
night, how a little strungling coal com
pany of Ranger. Texas, has become
one of the mightiest financial organ
izations of the Lone Star state, how
hotels of Ft. Worth are permeated
with excitement until they look like
the grain pit in Chicago on a bear
day, how men and women are making
so much money that they don't know
what to do with it these are thrilling
stories of the Texas oil fields brought
to Elsbee yesterday by Frederick L.
Harrington, economic geologist, form
erly a resident cf Bisbee but now liv
ing in Ft. Worth.
"It was the pertinacity and grit of
the manager of the little coal and fuel
company of Ranger that discovered
the oil field there." declared Mr. Har
rington yesterday. -He had stayed
by the drill day and night, fought the
directors day and night, and worked
untiringly in his faith that a big pool
lay under his lease. Finally the di
rectors closed the safe doors to him.
He went out into the field.
"'How are they comin'r he asked
the men at the rig. They replied tne
ought to hit oil In three days. He or
dered them to keep on drilling and
prepared to meet expenses for the rest
of the week out of his own 'pockets.
They struck oil, leased hundreds and
thousands of acres, and are no
among the greatest financial organiza
tions cf the state."
Everywhere men end women are
becoming rich, declares Mr. Harring
ton. He knows personally of a coun
try doctor, who in years past has driv
en over the country roads about
Ranger tending patients, laying away
a little for storm days, and putting a
little moreinto his dry farm. Wnen
oil was. found the former doctor be
came the financier. Now he rides
about the oil field districts gambling
a little here and a little there, with
more money coming in daily from roy
alties than he can possibly spend.
"I have never seen anything like
it," he declared yesterday. "The oil
men of the United States are rushing
onto the fields. 1 met them there from
California,- from New York, Pennsyl
vania. Wyoming, Montana, Mexico and
everywhere. The rush is growing each
day the boom is just beginning, and
the oil fields are extending in area
each day as new wells are brought
in."
Mr. Harrington arrived in Bisbee
yesterday for a brief stay on business
matters. His brother, George, form
erly of the district, is operating a
large oil lease in the heart ot the
richest territory, and has. options and
leases in many of the proven dis
tricts. entertainent that will be froe to men
and their families. Children will be
admitted only when accompanied by
their parents or an older person in
charge. The pictures will be education
al, dramatic and comic and there will
be a musical program between pic
tures. MEET DOUGLAS AGAIN.
The Y. M. C. A. basketball team win
go to Douglas on Saturday night to
play a return game with the Doug
las Y. M. C. A. team. The Bisbee
team recently defeated the Douglas
team in this city by a score of 32 to
30 and hopes to duplicate the perform
ance on Saturday on the Douglas
floor. The Bisbee team will line up
with Benton, center; Cockran, Kellum
and Hudson, forwards, and Oleson,
Potter and Glendenning, guards.

Tfllit GONCERT IS
DECIDED SUCCESS
J. Conrado Tovar. one of the young
pianist of emiuence, gave an excel
lent recital last evening at the High
school auditorium, appearing under
the auspices of the Y. W. O. A. A
large and representative audience was
delighted with the finished perform
ance of the young musician.
Of a sturdy and athletic build. To
var puts strength and character into
his rendition and displays skill and ap
preciation of his themes, which are
the result of knowledge and hard
study. His execution of difficult com
positions is done with rare skill and
mark him a thorough artist. His pro
gram last night was a varied and well
balanced one and served to bring out
to its best his great' talent.
While displaying thorough familiar
ity and perfect mastery of the works
of the old masters, Tovar was, per
haps, in his happiest vein in the ren
dering of the works of the Spanish
composers of later date. Having stud
ied under Granados. he gave the Alle
gro de Concierto of that composer with
special brilliance. The "Gypsy Town"
of Albeniz was probably enjoyed most
by the audience.
Following was the program:
1. Dances Patorales Beethoven
Valse Op. 64 No. 7 Chopin
Staccato Etude Op. 23 ..Rubenstein
2. Prelude No. 1 Debussy
Japanese Etude Op. 27 Poldinui

with eight-ounce gloves in Arizona.
The opposition to the election mea
sure was based on experience in the
state wbich in years gone by has
suffered Vunder a similar law. The
present state law, declared those who
spoke on the matter, Is adequate and
permits the naming of efficient offic
ers. Under the proposed law a condi
tion might exist such as was known
several years ago when one city had a
clerk unable to write his own name.
A resolution expressing the club's dis
approval was ordered sent to the
county's senators.
The prizefight bill was endorsed aft
er several members of the club had
expressed their approval of the mea
sure. Letters from Harry Jennings,
who fathered the billfi declared two
Y. M. C. A. organizations had approved
it and requested local expressions. But
one point of objection was raised
when Rev. Charles W. Harshman ask
ed if the new law will permit "rough
and tumble, knockout scraps."
"When a man puts on ten-ounce
gloves he isn't in much danger," re
plied George Cobbe. .
