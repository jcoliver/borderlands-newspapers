COLONEL TELLS
OF GERMAN PLOT
IN VENEZUELA
For the First Time Ex - Presi
dent Roosevelt Relates In
cident That Threatened
War With Teutons In 1902.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Sept. 27. Colonel Roose
velt today his version of the secret
conferences he held with the German
ambassador in 1902 relating to the
occupation of Venezuela by Germany,
an incident that then -threatened to
bring on war between Germany and
the United States. Coloney Roosevelt
told the story for the first time, he
said, in an address at a luncheon.
"It was about a year after I took
office,' ' Colonel Roosevelt began,
"Germany was engaged, as she has
been for years, in striving to extend
her dominion all over the world. She
had in view certain chosen positions
in South America. Germany was the
strongest foe of the Monroe Doctrine.
She aimed to turn South America in
to a German appendage. Venezuela
had a dictator named Castro, common
ly known as the 'monkey of the An
des.' .
Sends for Ambassador.
"I was determined Venezuela should
not became a German possession.
Germany said it was not to be perm
anent and did not define what was
meant by permanency. I permitted
John Hay to write a number of notes
and then decided to handle the matter
myself. I sent for the German am
bassador and said:
" 'This Venezuela business has been
going on long enough. I cannot af
ford to let it get- to the point where
it will cause trouble for this country.'
England Basks Germany.
"At that time England was backing
Germany. It was the last flicker of
England's antagonism to the United
States,
pos8e8Sjon? 8aying I did not propose
to have any 99 year leases.
The Ultimatum.
"The ambassador told me he did
not feel he was at liberty to discuss
such an important question. That
conference wound up with the follow
ing ultimatum:
'Tell your government that in 10
days it must arbitrate the matter or
I will send Dewey down there.'
"Thirty days before I had ordered
Dewey to take our fleet Into West In
dian waters. Just for a friendly cruise,
you know.
Message Not Sent.
" 'I cannot send such a message,
jjr. President. I do not think you
realize what it means,' the ambassa
dor replied.
"'You think it means war? I ak
ed. " 'I do not want to say what I
think," was the reply.
""'If It moans war, you have chosen
the one Fpot where you cannot fight
us,' I replied, and showed by maps
our commanding position.
Word to Dewey.
"When he retired I sent word to
Dewey to be ready to sail on an hour's
notice. About a "week later, the am
bassador called on me and talked
about the weather and tennis. When
I asked about the Venezuelan answer,
he admitted be had not dared send the
message.
"I then told him that Instead of al-
lawln? three days that remained for
an answer I would order Dewey to
sail in 48 hours. He told me it would
be an awful thing for this country.

WAR TAX BILL
EXPECTED TO
BE REPORTED
ICKLY
Senate and House Conferees
Said to Have Come to
Agreement on M e a s u r e.
Passage is Predicted During
Next Week.
By Review teased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. The war
tax bill, increased to raise about $2,700
000,000 in addition to $1,333,000,000 se
cured under existing law, was com
pleted late today ty the senate and
house conferees.
Presentation of the conference re
port to the house late today was plan
ned. The bill's enactment into law
next week is regarded assured.
Taxes of between $250,000,000 and
$300,000,000 over the senate bill, which
totalled $2,416,000,000, were added by
the conference. As passed by the
house the total was $1,868,000,00.
Excess Profits Unchanged.
Senate levies of $1,060,000,000 on
war excess profits and $842,200,000 on
incomes were substantially unchanged,
the conference increases being divided
among many items with a few taxes
added and many eliminated house pro
visions restored.
The system of levying war excess
profits, however, virtually was re-written
in a compromise between the sen
ate and house systems. A minimum
exemption of seven per cent on invest
ed corporate capital is said to be pro
vided, with modified allowances for in
tangible assets.
Income Tax Change.
Theonly change in the income tax
section was to re-arrange and harmon
ize a few graduated sur-taxes jn in
comes over $50,000, without substan
tial change in revenue returns or in
dividual taxation. Normal taxes on in
dividuals and corporations and the
lowered individual exemptions revised
In the senate were approved.
Postage Tax Raised.
Of the $250,000,000 to $200,000,000
additional agreed to by the conferees,
about one-third was placed upV"i pott
age. The house one-cent letter tax,
estimate to raise $70,000,000 which
was stricken out by the senate, was re
stored by the conferees, and their
agreement for a graduated zone in
crease on second-class mail rates is
estimated to raise some millions mure.
Amusement Taxes.
Another large increase was in pas
senger transportation and Pullman ac
commodation taxes. Amusement ad
missions also bear a considerable in
crease, with senate exemptions of out
door parks and attractions rejected.
The senate provision exempting
moving picture theatres charging twenty-five
cents or less from taxation was
changed and provision made for ex
empting only much cheaper theatres.
Luxuries.
Revenues from automobiles, patent
medicines, perfumes, and cVimetics,
and other manufactures also would be
increased.
Checks To Be Taxed.
The one-cent stamp tax on bank
checks, eliminated in the senate, esti
mated to raise $10,000,000, is reported
to have been restored to the bill.
Amtong house provisions abandoned
were the retro-active taxe on 1916 in
comes, estimated to raise $108,000,000
a general 10 per cent tariff levy, esti
mated to raise $200,000,000 and con
sumption taxes on gas, etc., and local
telephone service, estimated to bring
in $30,000,000.
Other Agreements.
Another action understood IV) have
been taken was restoration of the spec
ial tax of 16 per cent on munitions
maniffacturs, estimated to raise $29,
000.000. The senate provision for its repeal
was stricken out.
Official announcement of the prin
cipal features of the conferees' work
probably will be made tomorrow.

! mission headed by Secretary of Labor
Wilson held its first meeting today
and received its instructions from
President Wilson.
It was indicated the commission,

and to recommend to the president
a comprehensive policy of dealing
with the situation as a war emer

The commission during its two
months' trip plans to visit Arizona,
California, Utah, Nevada, Oregon,
Washington, Idaho, Montana, Wyom

Deadlock Over
Wages Exists
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. Coal
miners and operators discussing uni
on demands for a 25 per cent more
pay In the bituminous coal fields In
Illinois, Indiana, Ohio and western
Pennsylvania reported a deadlock
which has not been broken to Dr. H.
A. Garfield, the fuel administrator, as
to whether there is to be an upward
revision of the government-fixed
prices.
The Joint sub-committee of miners
and operators spent the day in a vain
attempt to reach an agreement on the
miners' proposal that the operators
grant an increase which might be used
as the basis of any appeal to the gov
ernment for higher selling prices. The
operators declined to consider this,
announcing their belief it would look
like conspiracy between miners and
operators to force higher coal prices.
According to the price-fixing law,
the government must fix a fair price
until the present price of coal at the
mine is raised by the fuel administra
tion. TIEN TSIN THREATENED.

Six Miles of R a i 1 Connec

many's Naval Bases.
JBy Review Leased Wire)
With all the objetcives of their new
offensive near Ypres securely in their
hands, the English. Scottish and Aus
tralian units now are tenanciously
holding them, notwithstanding fierce
German thrusts that have been
launched in efforts to regain the lost
ground.
As had been expected by reason of
the country over which the battle has
raged, the fighting throughout has
been of a violent character. Near the
Polygon wood, north and northeast of
St. Julien and northwest of Zonne
oeke, the enemy encounters have been
of a sanguinary character, the Ger
mans losing heavily in their counter
attacks. Chief Vantage Point
Of all the points of vantage gained
by Field Marshal Haig the village of
j Zonnebeke probably was the most im
portant, for six miles farther on lies
the Ostend-Lille railway, the cuttrhs!
of which by the BrltUh would seri
ously interfere with operation between
Germany's naval bases at Ostend and
Zeebrugge.
Capture Redoubt
Only at two points during the fight
ing were the Germans able to recap
ture lost ground. This was east of
St. Julien, where two redoubts again
fell Into the hands of the enemy. One
of these had to be relinquished by the
British and still remains in German
bands, but from the other the Ger
mans were scattered pe!l mell by a
fresh British onslaught.
Crown Prince Loses
The German crown prince along the
Aisne front and in the Verdun sect'qr
has made several attempts to break
the front of General Petain. but as on
former occasions the attacks all were
repulsed w"tU heavy casualties. On
the greater part of the line held by
the French arMiiery duels are in pro
gress. East Front Quiet
On the front in northern Russia
and in Rumania the activity of the
Germans and Austro-Hungarians has
almost ceased, except for small out
post operations and here and there ar
tillery duels of slight proportions. The
Germans, however, apparently are re
connoitering in the Naltis sea, pre
paring for attacks against the Rus
sian fleet.
Cadorna's Men's Inactive
There has been no resumption by
General Cadorna of his intensive of
enslve against the Austrian s along
the Isonzo ront, where only minor en-
gagament have taken place. On the
Carso plateau the Austrians have be- j
gun again a volent bombardment of
Italian positions, but the Italians are
effectively countering. Large quanti
ties of explosives daily are being
dropped by the Italians on Austrian
positions behind the fighting front.
Airmen Busy
In Belgium the British and French
airmen are also keeping up their
raids against German naval bases,
cantonments and other Important ob
jectives and are scoring hits which
give visible indications of great dam
age. CIVIL RIGHTS BILL

BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND

ated Press.) The British today con
tinued to strengthen their liue to
which they battled their way yester
day. The Australians completed their
conquest of the German positions at
the eastern extremity of Polygon
wood. Two places secured here rep
resented the, only remaining trouble
some points along the Anzac front,
which reaches northward to the east
of Polygon wood.
There has been much hard fighting
in this section, but today the weary
I Germans apparently withdrew to more
favorable ground further back and the
Australians pushed forward.
Menin Road Activity
To the south of that point the Ger
mans continue to hammer away with
their artillery at the British defense
astride the Menin road and make
threats of an infantry assault. The
neighborhood of Hill 40, northwest of
Zonnebeke, continues to be hotly con
tested ground, with little give or take
on either side.
Anzacs Earn Praise
Consolidations have been completed
by the British in a majority of the
places. x the Anzacs having finished
this work on the ground which they
won in well-conducted operations that
called out the highest praise from all
quarters. About nine German counter
attacks in various stages of prepara
tion were broken up by the Austra
lians. Most of these were smashed
in their infancy by artillery and only
two approached wi;bin rifle and ma
chine gun range.
German Reinforcements
Late yesterday afternoon a fresh
German diviison was rushed up in
motor busses for an attnek on the
Australian right. They left their mo
tors at a point a n.iic in front of the
Australians and abcut 7 o'clock ad
vanced in three waves, preceded by a
heavy barrage.
Their progress was steady until the
Anzacs put a withering fire on their
ranks from machine guns and rifles.
Then they paused, wavered and
finally turned back, leaving many
dead on the field.
Anzacs Again
The details of Tuesday's hard fight
ing north of the Menin road, when
the Germans made a fierce attack,
indicate that the Anzacs also played
a helpful part. It was their deter
mination to counter-attack from the
north against the German right, and
that had much to do with forcing back
the enemy and the recovery of the
positions temporarily IJVt.
On the northern front of the ne
offensive in the region east ot St.
Julian some Interesting German pris
oners were to be found today. A num
ber of the prisoners captured were a
nondescript group of middle-age who
looked far different from men of the
warrior type. They sail the- Ger
mans had used up all of their 19 1 S
class, and that as the 1919 class was
not ready they were railing up old
men.
Americans Feared
One officer captured with some Sax
ons took a very dark view of the
German situation. He declared that
the war would be over In the sprint;,
and when asked his reason for this
belief replied: "Because the Ameri
cans will be over here then, and you
will have too many men for us.
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM. Sept. 27. Hard fighting

points along the Ypres battle front
as a result of heavy German counter
attacks on positions wrested from the

here and when last heard from the
Australians were pressing the Ger
mans bard.
Counter attacks against the Austral
ian front, east of Polygon Wood, dur
ing the night were hurled back after
hard fighting.
Forced to Withdraw.
Yesterday afternoon the Germans
launched a pretentious counter drive
against the British line between Tow
er Hamlets an Polygon Wood. A
sanguinary struggle ensued, especial
ly north of Menin road but the Ger
mans were gradually forr-ed to with
draw after suffering heavy losses.
Fighting Continues.
Northwest of Zohnebeke heavy
fighting still continues in the region
of an elevation known as Hill 40,
which dominates a considerable
amount of the surrounding ground.
East and a little northeast of St. Jul
ien the Germans made two heavy
counter attacks against redoubt posi
tions which the British had captured
yesterday morning. A very determin
ed assault in the neighborhood of
Boettler Farm, east of St. Julien, was
driven off. North of this place the
Germans succeeded in regaining two
redoubts. Subsequently the British
countered in turn and forced thm
from one of these, leaving the other
still in enemy hands.
Situation Satisfactory.
From the English standpoint the
situation resulting from the new of
fensive is exceedingly satisfactory.
Weather conditions were ideal today
and consolidations wer proceeding
rapidly. In a number of places the
British improved their line somewhat
during the night by establishing posts
still further forward.

Complete Occupation.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept, 27t Italian
troops have completed their occupa
tion of the entire Bainsizza Plateau
which is now firmly in Italian hands,
according to official dispatches receiv
ed here today from Rome.
The troops are consolidating posi
tions lately won and the principal of
fensive activity at present is by Ital
ian airplanes scouting over the Aus
trian lines and bombarding depots and
columns of troops.
It is the opinion among Italian of
ficials here that the Austrians are
trying to fortify their lines so as to
have good winter quarters by the time
the snows interfere with active op
erations. Illinois Milk
Producers Are
Law Violators
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Sept. 27. Records of
the Illinois Milk Producers' associa
tion seized in a raid by detectives to
day tend to show a price was fixed
for retail marketing of milk by mem
bers of the association, according to
McKay Hearne, states' attorney.
The raid was conducted at the re
quests of James M. Wilkerson and
Walter Drew, assitant attorney gen
eral of Illionis and was to determine
whether the law had been violated in
fixing the price, Mr. Wilkersoa said.
The price of milk to distributers
jumped from $2.12 to $3.42 a hundred
pounds since the February meeting
of the association.
"If these gentlemen have not vio
lated the anti-trust laws of the state
in every way possible, there is no
such thing as a violation of the anti
trust law," said Mr. Hearne.

Thin, brittle, cotorless and scraggy

There is nothing so destructive to
the hair as dandruff. It robs the hair
of its lustre, its strength and its very

if not remedied causes the hair roots
to shrink, loosen and die then the

Get a 25-cent bottle of Knowlton's

life, lustre and luxuriance which Is so
beautiful. It will bec'ome wavy and

AVIATION MEN INVOLVED
By V. view Le.ised Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 27. Five
members of the United States avia
tion corps, an army recruiting officer
and two navy ensigns were said to
day by federal authorities to be in
volved in a spy plot, alleged to have
been headed by Lieutenant Erwin
Erwin Frederich Schneider of the Ger
man navy, and Theodore Kasln.aer, de
partmeut store employe, both of whom
were taken into custody recently.
This disclosure came as the result
of an order from the department of
justice providing for the immediate
removal of Schneider and Kasinger
rom the county jail to an internment
camp on Angel island, which contains
Franz Bopp, former consul general
here, and his aide. Baron E. II. voh
Schack. former vice consul.
The authorities refused to divulge
the alleged participation of the army
and navy officers in the pJt. They
said all information In the case hai
been sent to San Diego and Los An
geles, where It was understood, the
conspiracy centered.
At the time Schneider and Kaslntr
were taken in:o custody, federal
agents asserted they had associated
with four army officers subsequently
detained at Laredo, Tex., and who, it
's belieed, were planning to embark
from Mexico for Germany' or Austria.
It was said they were suspected cf
having secured military information.

STARRED AT EAGLE
"The Beautiful Lie," the Metro
production starring Frances Nelson, to
be seen at the Eagle theater today,
is a great poem dramatized. Pre
sented by B. A. Rolfe, it has been
adapted for the screen br June Ma
this from Ella Whaeler Wilcox's fa
mous poem, "A Reverie in a Station
House." Selections from the most
dramatic portions of the poem are
fashed on the screen.
Powerfully contrasting scenes are
shown in "The Beautiful Lie." One
of the most interesting of these is
of a police court where women of
fenders are arraigned. Here Louise
Joyce (Frances Nelson) is brought
under a false accusation, and thrown
in among criminals. Later she be
comes an artist model, and the pro
ducts shows typical scenes in New
York's "Bohemia." A painting of
Louise as an "ice maiden" figures
prominently. Advised by Mary, an
unfortunate woman who aids her
when she is in need to take all and
give nothing, she presents a cold ex
terior to all men, and is painted in
the character of the ice maiden by
Paul Vivian, a young artist.' A yacht

tect and his group of bon vivants
adds to the colorful scenes with
Which this gripping photoplay is filled.

They are demanding premiums Jf
more than 200 per cent. They require
deposits for the lull series of three

told their money would be refunded i
they returned the ur.used parts of the
tickets before the game for which they
are issued.
Charles A. Comiskey, president of
the Chicago club, announced that r."j
more than one ticket of the 13,000 pa

would be sold 10 any person and that
the purchaser must go into the park

CAMP FUXSTON, Kans., Sept. 27.-1
A city of 80.000 men without a woma

what Camp Funston wiil be when the
construction 'jrk is finished and ev
erything settles down to regulation
military existence.
Women won't be allowed in the
camp even as visitors, according to tae
present plans, and none will be allow
ed to sl'jp here for meals. Everything
will be done by men, from darning
socks to operating telephone switch
boards. The present plan is to build a rest
room for the Y. W. C. A. in the north
east section jf the camp, just outside
the regulation limits. Here women vis
itors can meet their friends, eat or se
cure temporary sleeping quarters.
There will be a street leading from
the cottage to the street car station,
where a smaller rest room will be lo
cated, and the women will be allowed
only to pass between the two places.
No other place in camp will be open to
them.

Friday Morning, September 28, 1917.
Already kind and generous men and women every
where are making preparations to give Christmas pres
ents to the soldiers in camp and in the field.
A study of the dint in the German lines at the Ypres
salient reveals the danger of the German lines from Lille
to the sea. Either Von Hindenburg or the weather must
stop the British soon or the Prussian will have to make
a hurried retreat of proportions that will make even the
German people, blind to everything except Prussian In
vincibility, see the writing on the wall. It will be a hard
winter in the German huts and towns and trenches, and
it will not be hilarious in the palace at Potsdam.
Along with the German peace talk comes word of the
destruction of factories and mines in Belgium by a sys
tematized plan that does not leave one stone upon an
other or one boiler pipe intact in a mine. This thorough
and fiendish destruction of a town's industries generally
proceeds the evacuation of that town. The German acts
and attitude will have to change before any set of real
men in any allied nation will listen to any words of peace
no matter how soft or how conciliatory they may appear
to be.
Henry Ford's son has asked for exemption. This is the
first publicity in connection with the Michigan magnate
since he sailed his peace ship to Europe to "have the
men out of the trenches by Christmas." Neither brand
of publicity that has fallen to the lot of Ford is desirable.
His son will probably have to go anyway. He is secre
tary of his father's great plant and seeks to avoid the
draft for "occupational" reasons. But the process of the
draft has so far been phenomenally free from favoritism.
The rich and poor, the high and low, the famous and the
unknown have been treated exactly alike by exemption
boards all over the country. A fair deal for all has been
the writing on the wall of the board rooms in every
county and district so far as known. Hence the un
paralelled success of the greatest draft in history.
Someone tackled County Engineer Dick Ryan the other
day about the disgraceful condition of the streets in War
ren. "It is not altogether the county's fault," declared
the engineer. "The county will go fifty-fifty with the
Warren company on these streets; no more, no less. The
streets were in bad shape when they were dedicated,
hence the Warren company should go half and half under
the law." This being the case, it is the hope and prayer
of all good citizens of Warren that the company and the
commissioners get together and grade a street or two In
the No Man's Land that exists between the handsome and
modern houses of Warren. And speaking of streets, there
is a section of the road between Johnson addition and
Bisbee that is so rough that a British "tank" would b
held up there for repairs or a train of burrjws to haul
it over the shell holes.
ROOSEVELT ON THE WAR.
Whatever the prejudices of his enemies and the partial
ity of his friends, both divisions will agree that Theodori
Roosevelt is a great man and has a most striking and
forceful way of stating things that bear vitally upon
great public issues. In his speech at Kansas City the
other day he stated the issues of this war in a fashion
that ought to be read out loud at every fireside in this
land. A part of what be said is presented here' as fol
lows: "At this time every vigorous young man of fighting
age ought to be with the colors if he can possibly get
there. It will be a mighty good thing In the future to ex
plain to your children and grandchildren why you did
go to the war, and not to have to explain why you didn't
go.
"Ynu are fighting for the rights of every well behaved
people to live its own life and decide for Itself what form
of government it desir-js. Above all, you are fighting for
America, for your own country. You are making the
world safe for America; and America can never be safe
until the hideous menace of German militarism is de
stroyed. "Not for over a century has any warring nation behaved
wth Germany's cynical bad faith and brutality; and never
b( fore has any nation shown such calculated, ruthless,
scientific, carefully organized cruelty. Yet, horrible al
though her conduct is, it is a degree less base than the
conduct of the Americana who actually do show them
selves to be both cowards and traitors by advocating that
we yield to her, that we kiss the hands that are red with
the blood or our murdered women and children, and
take the position of whipped slaves before the scientific
butchers of the Hohenzollerns.
"If a man will not fight for his wife and his children,
he is too base a creature for association with any man
or woman of honor. If a nation will not protect its wo
men and children. If it will not at once go to war rather
than submit to their murder. It occupies a position of
unspeakable degradation.
''Any American of ordinary intelligence who does not
now oppose Germany with heart and soul is either a trai
tor or a coward. And the worst evil that could now befall
the world would be an inconclusive peace. Such a peac?
would be accepted everywhere as a German victory.
"We are in this war for two reasons. First, we are
fighting for America, and. second, we are fighting for the
welfare of mankind.
"We are fighting for America. We are fighting abroad,
in conjunction with our allies, in order that we ourselves
or our children may not have to fight in this country
hedde our ruined homes. Germany's brutal wronpdoing
to us has rendered it incumbent on every American with
a spark of manhood in him to demand that she be punish
ed by war. Her calculated, scientific, efficient and utterly
remorseless and unscrupulous cruelty and inhuman'ty to
every weak nation and every conquered foe during these
last three years show us exactly what we have to expect
if she triumphs, or even if the war ends in a draw, so
that she can next time strike at her chosen moment,
when she can Isolate us or some other victim.
"She has perpetrated against innocent non-combatants
on the sea murder by the wholesale. Among tboso thus
murdered were some hundreds of Americans, all of them
unarmed, all of them going about their lawful business,
and many of them women and children. The innocent
non-combatants, including women and children, thus slain
on the sea by the direct orders of the German govern
ment during the last three years surpass in number ail
the fighting men killed in both the Union and Confeder
ate navies in the entire Civil War.
"There was no shadow of a pretense that she had any
Justification in right for this system of wholesale murder
carried on against innocent passengers on unarmed ships.
No such infamies and horrors have been committed by
any civilized nation since the close of the dreadful re
ligious wars nearly 300 years ago. In cotrniiUIng these
Germany deliberately counted on her policy of 'schreck
lichkeit,' on the infliction of horror, to terrorize both her
adversaries and neutrals. She believed that, cowardice
was so widespread thai it was to her self interest to
frighten people by murder.
"The sinking of the Lusitania was the blackest infamy
any civilized nation has committed in war since the end
of the Seventeenth Century. After it scores of Ameri
can women, American mothers, lay dead with their dead
babies in their arms in the Queenstown morgue. Not a
fighting man had been killed. But over a thousand help
less and innocent people. Including hundreds of women
and little children, had been foully murdered. And Ger
many went into ecstasies of delight, the German people
backing the German government with fanatic enthus
iasm. "They struck medals and sang hymns to commemorate
the murder of the innocent, and they rewarded the man
who had done the deed."
BEING FOUND OUT.
The German press has been resounding again with con
demnation of American perfidy. It is moved to virtuous
wrath over "the latest American dispatch theft." It
can find no language too severe to characterize the con
duct of our government in intercepting and publishing
the tell-tale dispatches from Argentina and Mexico, which
got certain German and Swedish diplomats into very hoi
water.
The Cologne Gazette, delivering a moral homily on
the sanctity of diplomatic intercourse, sarcastically con
cludes: "This publication proves to be a worthy compan
ion piece to Wilson's exploitation of our Mexico mes
sage. It appears to be part of an American specialty
whkh baa a preference for dealing with stolen docu
ments." The "Mexican message" referred to was Secretary
Zimmcrmann's dispatch to the German minister in Mexi
co, von Eckhardt, while we were still on friendly terms
with Germany, asking him to line up Mexico and Japan
against the United States. The present state of min i
of the German press and government is precisely whai
it was when the Zimmermann message was published.
Not a word of sorrow cr apology for the shameful rcvela
tion of Prussian or Swedish perfidy, not a word of criti
cism for the diplomats who have brought German and
Swedish honor into reproach, but only hot Indignation
against those who revealed the offense to the world.
We are driven to the conviction that in the eyes of
the German government and the German press there i:i
nothing dishonorable, nothing criminal, if it can be kept
hidden. The only dishonor or crime is being found oil'.
And whoever makes it known must be strafed.,
Rippling Rhymes
j (By WALT MASON.)
MR. MAN
Man walks through .ife with locoed
tread, and finds the going rough;
through a!l his youth he loo'.;s ahead
th future is the stuff. H-'Il do grea:
things in coming years, when he has
half a show; his fame will ring
through all the spheres and reach to
Broken Bow. He's so impatient for
the time when he can hit the spots,
that youth, the golden and sublime, is
gone before he wots. Youth, youth!
!t passes like the wind, and cannot be
recalled; and man wakes up some day
to find he's tired and old and bald.
He sees the wreck of noble schemes,
and murmurs, through his tears, "Tho
plans of youth are idle dreams that
won't outlive the years." Now he is
always looking back, as once he gazed
ahead; his eyes are on the rugged
track that knew his hopeful tread. The
future has no charms for him, it
smiles for him no more; the past ap
peals to eyes grown dim. he talks of
days of yore. Oh, youth, forevermore
your gaze is fixed on things ahead;
while age laments the vanished days,
snd sadly counts its dead.

Fighting Spirit
Absent In Army
of New Republic
(by Review Leased Wire).
STOCKHOLM, Sept. 27. An Amer
can who has spent ten years in Euro
pean capitals, and whose position com
pels him to take the viewpoint of an
impartial observer, reached here to
day after six weeks in Petrograd, and
gives a pessimistic report of the fight
ing spirit in Russia and of political
and Industrial conditions. He said:
"There is no fighting spirit except
I among the Cossacks and Caucasians,
! and that seems to be waning. A Cau-
! casian colonel 'said to me:
j " 'There are no real fighters left in
, Russia except us, and we are not
i Russians, thank God, but Caucasians
I and Mohammedans.'
j "The interior cities and villages are
! filled with Russian troops who refuse
to go to the front. Young Russians
of the better class are bunting the
streets of Petrograd for men willing
to become officers. Since the murder
of officers by men has become a daily
occurrence on the most trial excuse,
no one will take commissions. ,
"Reports of open disobedience of
! troops at the front are countless.
"Newspapers in Helsingfors carry
accounts of military deeds of vio
lence and of murder of officers and
civilians by soldiers, often accom
panied by robbery."

TWELVE THOUSAND
CHILDREN LEARNING
NATIVE LANGUAGE
Alsatian Youngsters Learning
To Forget Their German
Education and Studying
Pronunciation of French.
THANN, Alsace, Sept. 27 (Corre
spondence of the Associated Press).
Twelve thousand Alsatian children are
now trying to lose their German ac
cent in French schools in the three
districts into which the liberated
part of Alsace has been divided for
administrative purposes.
A fortnight after the French troops
entered Dannemarie, the first Alsatian
town reoccupied, French schools were
in operation with French Officers rd
soldiers as teachers. Consequently a
number of the pupils have now had
three years' instruction in French,
which at once supplemented Germaa,
under the French system of absolutely
free education, with books and caool
supplies furnished by the state.
The progress made by the chi.dren
is remarkable, excepting as concerns
pronunciation. The habit of pro
nouncing words exactly as they are
spelled was so strong they haven't yet
mastered the difficulties of the French
mutes, diphthongs and liasons, but
they are very strong on grammar,
which, after German, they find is mere
play.
The French administration herd has
shown every tolerance of local tradi
tions. The daily prayer in the school
room; ' abolished in French public
schools years ago, has been aKowed
to survive. The military governor of
the reclaimed territory has glveu
strictest orders that no infringement,
even upon religious customs of the
population, be permitted.
Schools were installed anywnera ana
everywhere at the beginning, the old
school h'juses in many cises being in
the danger zone. - In go-l wealh-r
classes were heard in the open air.
Now they are all provided wii.li com
fortable and safe rooms attractively
decorated and made In every way so
inviting that few children are tempted
to play truant
There are now 89 Vf these schools
in operation, with 113 schoolmist
resses and 99 schoolmasters, the l it-
i ter recruited from among the mutilat-
ed soldiers mustered out of the army.
A few of them are the old Alsatian
teachers of French origin wbV hav!
readily assimilated the French meth
ods of instruction. Of the schoolmis
tresses, 90 are Sisters of Charity of
the congregation of the "DiTine Provl-
idence," who have never ceased to
protest against the annexation of Al-
I sace by Germany. They render ines
i timable services to the French admin
j istration, which has braved the anger
of the anti-clericals by retaining them
I at their posts.
The soldier-teachers wear their uni
forms in the classroom, which give
! them increased authority over their
I pupils by reason of the immense pres-
tige the French uniform enjoys in Al-
sace The voiuntary discipline in-
spired by respect for that uniform has
entirely "displaced the old rigid Teu-

V REVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK, Sept. 27. The same
Considerations which recently tended
to restrict market operations for the
long account were again in force to
day. Money was the controlling fac
tor, call loans holding at yesterday's
high rate 6 per cent until the final
hour, when a fractional drop was re
ported. There was further paucity of
time funds.
Trading was dull except at irregular
Intervals, when the professional ele
ment sought to effect further impair
ment of quoted values.

tween 109 and. 111.
Rails were adversely lnfueneed by
the weakness of St. Panl common and

and the preferred falling 14 to 99.
its low record for many years. The
common stock later made slight re
covery. Total sales, 435.000 shares.
Liberty 3's featured the irregular

Total sales, par value, 14,515,000.
United States bonds, old issues, were
unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept. 27. Optimism as
to the crop outlook despite temporary
adverse weather conditions led to de
clines today in the corn market and
prices closed weak. to net lower,
at 120 to 12014 December and 117
to 117 May. rOats finished off
to 1 up, and provisions varied from
25c setback to 35c advance.
Frost, unless extreme, appeared to
have lost power to terrorize the corn
trade. Notwithstanding that some of
the frost was reported in a number
of places throughout the west, a ma
jority of dealers inclined to the view
that most of the corn in that section
was now far enough harvested to be
benefited rather than hurt by a mod
erate visitation.
A revival of export demand gave
relative strength to oats. General rains
tended also to encourage the bulls.
Except for nearby deliveries of ribs,
provisions were under no special pres
sure, but high quotations were general
in the market.

NEW YORK, Sept. 27. The market
was more or less of a professional
affair with that element more inclined
to follow the selling side.
Efforts along those lines met with
a moderate amount of success during
the forenoon, but inside offerings did
not come up to the bearish expecta
tions, and it Is also well to mention
that in the standard industrial shares
there were distinct signs of support
emanating from substantial sources.
This substantial buying power made
itself felt in the afternoon dealings,
and shorts covered rather freely, re
sulting in a full recovery in values,
and more, too.
Peace talk was again freely circu
lated freely, but disclosures of this
kind, it seems, are given little cre
dence, especially in administration
circles. While those committed to the
bull side of the market are not over
enthusiastic as to their position, still
it is observable that in conservative
quarters, especially in the banking cir
cles, the disposition is to resuscitate
constructive feelings, and this is more
than apt to be reflected in a slow but
gradual betterment in security prices.

Next day he was taking his little
son for a ride on the trolly car, which
was crowded with local residents.
As the car was passing the police

I GIRLS! MAKE A
BEAUTY LOTION
WITH LEMONS
At the Cost of a small jar of ordin
ary cold cream one can prepare a full
quarter pint of the most wonderful
lemon skin softener and complexion
beaut ifler, by squeezing the Juice f
two fresh lemons into a bottle contain
ing three bunces of orchard white.
Care should be taken to strain the
juice through a fine cloth so no lemon
pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
fresh for months. Every woman
knows that lemon juice is used to
bleach and remove such blemishes as
freckles, sallowness and tan and is the
ideal skin softener, smoothener and
beautifier. .
Just try it! Get three ounces of
Orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
grant lemon lotion and massage it
daily into the face, neck, arms and
hands. It should naturally help to
whiten, soften, freshen and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin. It
is truly marvelous to smoothen rough,
red hands. Adv.

Game Reserve
The local game wardens have receiv
ed word from State Game Warden Joe
V. Prochaska that bbys under seven
teen do not have to have a hunting
license in Arizona, provided, they were
born in the United States and are ac
companied by a person holding a lic
ense to hunt, so partnts are advised to
see that their boys do not go out hunt
ing without complying with that part
of the law. It is also a fact that a
man'or any one does nbt have to have
a license to hunt rabbits but the law
says that the only boys under seven
teen accompanied by a person holding
a license may hunt. Some boys have
been going out hunting rabbits without
a license and parents should see fro it
that they comply with the law as the
game wardens, of which there are
many, will get them if they don't. A
grown person who will go out hunting
rabbits without a license will certain
ly be under suspicion by the officers
because it is impossible to think a
man would gb hunting rabbits and not
shoot a dove, duck or quail if the
chance occurred. Besides that, he is
certainly a cheap skate and a poor
sport You cannot shoot any kind of
game In the Huacbuca mountains as
that is a game refuge, but u can kill
varmints and must have a license to
do that in those mountains, according
to law.

Send the Review Letters
You Get From Soldiers
The Review desires to receive and publish letters written by our
American soldiers and sailors in camp at home or abroad, to their
friends and relatives here.
Trained correspondents, of course, are reporting and will report
the great, vital happenings of the war on land and sea. But the real,
intimate descriptions of war the fascinating details of the fighting
business the "close ups," so to speak, of what our Yankee boys in
blue or in khaki are doing will reach America through the medium
of letters sent right from the trenches or the ships' decks to the folks
at home.
Narratives of this sort will make the best reading and will give
the most detailed pictures of war as It is that will come from Over
There.
Whether published or not, the letters will be returned promptly
by The Review to the persons who send them in.
Address letters "To the News Editor of The Review, Bisbee, Ariz."
Best News Comes in Letters, Says Baker.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 27. "The best news from the soldiers."
said Secretary Baker today, "will come in letters to their friends, and
arrangements are being made for facilitating the transmission of sued
letters."

replace them, the remnant should be

that discarded or tattered flags must
not be thrown in the trash barrel or
the street, but must be burned. Peo -

see that they are replaced as soon
