Interested in Group of Su
perior Claims.
By the payment of a large sura "of
money through the Calley Bank of
, Phoenix by J. Harry Maemillan. min
ing operator of Nevada and Utah, to
William A. Davidson, the finishing
touches were put, on a deal whereby '
one of the valuable mining properties
of the Pioneer district at Superioi
changed hands. The purchasers, ac
cording to Mr. Macmlllan, include
Samuel Newh'juse of Salt Lake city
and New York. The property has been
deeded to a corporation recently or
ganized under the name of the Magma
Superior Copper company. It is un
derstood that Mr. Newhouse will be
president of the company. Mr. Mac
millan will be director.
Negotiations for the sale "of the
Davidson property, known as the In
terloper group, have been carried on
between Mr. Macmlllan, representing
those who will be his associates and
V J. Graham of Phoenix, represent
ing Mr; Davidson, for the past two
months. The sale of the property is
very significant because tf its location
lying directly south and adjoining the
Lake Superior & Arizona property, so
recently acquired by the Magma In
terests and because it is claimed by
those who know the district that the
Interloper group has been held in the
highest esteem by engineers and geo
logists who have made a study of the
Pioneer district.
Interested Through Report x
Careful study of the Pioneer district
and particularly 'of the Magma and
Davidson properties on behalf of the
Newhouse interests by Engineer C. H.
James and a personal representative
of Mr. Newhouse convinced the Utah
capitalist and bis associates that the
opportunity for mine-making offered by
the Interloper group is splendid. Ac
cording to these engineers the prop
erty is traversed by three strong
cross-fissures, resembling in all partic
ulars the fissure which has been re
sponsible for the disclosure of the vast
body of high grade copper ore in the
now far famed- Magma mine.
It is understood that Michigan min
ing operators were negotiating for the
Davidson property and the competition
for its purchase has been keen. The
interest manifested by the specula
tive public and mining investors in
the Superior district has awakened all
sections of the rtmntry, where the
mining industry attracts attention, to
the possibilities of the district The
Magma,- notwithstanding thereticence
of its management in disclosing the
true worth of its well-known tremen
dous strike, is acting as a gigantic
magnet in attracting to Superior the
mining world. It is currently rumored
that a number of other big deals are
under way whereby valuable property
in the Pfbneer district will shortly
change hands.
Newhouse Talk of Property
The following dispatch regarding the
Magma Superior Copper company was
received from Salt Lake City:
"Samuel Newhouse, formerly the
most talked of mining man in Utah,
whose colossal mining deals and lav
ish expenditures on Salt Lake public
improvements, captivated the imagina
tion of the people for many years and
whose greatest achievement was un
doubtedly the discovery of the com
mercial value of the copper porphyries
after a number of years vacation is
getting back into the mining indus
try, according to his own statements
given out in an interview during the
week to a representative of the West
ern News bureau.
" 'I am not 'only going into the min
ing business activity,' said Mr. New
house, ' but I am going into it heav
ily because I have tired of inactivity
for the past few years. I have be
come interested in the wonderful pos
sibilities offered in the Pioneer dis
trict in Arizona and have taken a sub
stantial interest In the newly organ
ized Magma-Superior Copper company
which has purchased the Interloper
group lying directly, to the south and
adjoining the Magma property. The
reports we got on the property give
us more than the necessary assurances
of success In our undertaking. We
hope to make a big mine on the terri
tory acquired.'

COPPER MINING MAKES
GREATEST PROGRESS
IN BRITISH COLUMBIA
Canadian Mining as a Whole
Has Been Remarkable Dur
ing Last Year Copper Pro
duction Largely Increased.
VICTORIA, B. C, Jan: 27. Copper
miring is making greater advances
in British Columbia than in any other
branch of mining in this province.
The estimated output for 1916 was ap
proximately 70,000,000 pounds, which
compares with 56,91R,000 pounds in
(1915, and 51,456.000 pounds in 1912,
these being the only other years in
which the production of this metal
exceeded 50,000,000 pounds. The
yearly average for the five-year period
1911-1915, was 47,354,520 pounds. The
quantity produced in 1916 was nearly
50 percent greater than that average.
The first recorded production of
copper in the province was 324.6S0
pounds in 1894. For the eight-year
period. 1894-1901, the total output, ac
cording to official records, was 6.1,016,
000 pounds. For the three five-year
periods since 1901 the figures are as
follows: For 1902-6, 180.389,000
pounds; for 1907-11, 208,876.000
pounds. The total production in 23
years, 1894-1916 (that for 1916 being
estimated) was 722,126,000 pounds.
The chief copper producing district
of British Columbia until 1914 was
that known as the Boundary, compris
ing Grand Forks and Greenwood min
ing divisions, in which the Granby
Consolidated and British Columbia
Copper companies have been
ing more than 20 years. In
"lit
.
however, what is known as the Coast
district came Into greater prominence
this including Vancouver mining divi
sion in the southern part, in which
the Britannia Mining and Smelting
company's mines are situated, and
Skeena mining division in the north
ern part, in which the Granby Con
solidated company also commenced
producing copper in 1914.
Approximate figures for 1916 indi
cate the position a regards sources
of copper production In the province
today, as follows: Northern Coast,
29.971,000 pounds; Southern Coast,
18,765,000 pounds; Boundary. 16,158,
000 pounds; Trail Creek (Rossland),
3,986,000 pounds; other parts, 1,120,
,000 pounds; total, 70,000,000 pounds.
The following table shows the
quantities of copper from the several
producing districts for all years to
date:
District. Pounds.
Boundary 413,557,000
Coast 1S8.871.000
Trail Creek (Rossland) .. 101,698,000
Nelson (West Kootenay) 15,000.000
Other
3,000,000
Total (1894-1916) 722,126.000
While the greater part of the cop
per produced in the Northern Coast
district has come from the Granby
Consolidated company's Hidden
Creek mine, near Observatory inlet,
about 5,000,000 pounds was produced
in 1915 and 1916 from the Rocher De
boule Copper company's mine in Otu
ineca mining division.
There is promise of a steadily in
creasing output from the Skeena re
gion and other parts of the northern
country. In the southern part of the
province, in Simikameen division,
west of the Boundary district, the
British Columbia Copper company
has developed ore in considerable
quantities in a group of mineral land
on Copper mountain, within a dozen
miles of Princeton, the most import
ant of the several small towns in the
Simikameen district. .
The , principal copper producing
companies in the province are the
Granby Consolidated, British Colum
bia Copper. Consolidated Mining and
Smelting Company of Canada, and
Britannia Mining and Smelting com
pany. Among the smaller producers
are the Rocher Deboule Copper com
pany, the Kamloops Copper Company
operating in Vale district; the High
land Valley Mining and Development
company, which has just started con
centrating copper ore near its mines
in Ashcroft division, Yale district, and
several others In Yale or Coast dis
tricts. Information relative to reserves of
copper ore and to metal contents or
recoveries from ore mined and treat
ed In recent years lias been obtained
from various sources. From the fol
lowing figures an idea will be obtain
able as to the estimated quantities of
ore available for mining in some of
the mines that have been largely pro
ductive in recent years and the met-
als contained in a part of the ores al
ready disposed of:

The deposit is remarkable, owing
to its remarkable purity ef chalcopy

SAUNDERS TALKS ON
CONSERVATION OF ALL
NATURAL RESOURCES
W-1 Sa"ndeI? Mkt Befor'
Chamber or Commerce or
Pittsburg and Tells Audi
ence His Opinion.
The question is. shall U-ialation be
urged before congress to permit co
operative agreements under federal
supenision in certain primary natural
resources, such as timber, the ores
and deposits of useful metals and the
deposits of minerals which are a
: source of heat, light, and power. The !
conserved; that human life, among
persons engaged in those industries,
will be better cared for, and that the
safety, welfare, and prosperity of our
people now and in future generations
will be increased.
Remember that we are dealing in
this matter only wikh primary natural
resources and that we propose to per
mit regulation. What are the prim
ary natural resources? Concretely
they are forests, natural gas and oil
deposits, coal. ir3n ore. and metallifer
ous ores, speaking in general terms
these things are the sinews of natural
security and prosperity in peace and
war.
We are an industrial, not an agricul
tural nation. It is because we have ad
vanced from the farm to the workship
that we have grown great and rich.
Our fathers developed these fields
through the cultivation of the soil.
Through their labors America sustain
ed human life throughout the World,
but nature has provided us .with some
thing more than surface fields for cul
tivation. We have found other re
sources and throughout the develop
ment of these resources we have be
come the largest industrial factor in
the world. Just as the farm sustains
human life so does the mine sustain
industrial life. Human capacity to
pi'jduce throush manual labor in the
field is limited to a,.Iittle more than
human capacity to live. A big agricul
tural country does not grow rich and
powerful, tl does not build up large
cities, but it goes on through the even
tenor of its way in perpetual desue
tude. Not so with a country rich in
mines anil minerals. Look at Pitts
burg. lok at Sheflielil and Birming
ham, and the distinction is apparent.
There are three great industrial na
tions in the world; The United States.
England and Germany. Belgium, be
fore the war. was great in industry.
though limited in size. Russia and
China are great in territory and in
wealth, but they do not figure indus
trially as the world is measured, either
because of lack of development or
through limitations of raw material.
The true measure of an industrial na
tion is its consumption "of coal. A na
tion might produce a large volume of
coal and iron ore, but unless it utilizes
this production in industry it does not
become great in industry. The United
States consumes about 5 tons of coal
per capita per annum, England arill
Germany each consume alAmt 4 tons,
while the consumption in France is a
little more than 1 1-2 tons, and in Rus
sia about 1-4 of a ton. We consume
about 16 pounds of copper per capita

H. P. Collins, Field Engineer
for Butte Mining Man,
Makes Examinations of
Warren District Properties.
DECLARES BISBEE'S
FUTURE IS ENORMOUS
Makes Astounding Prediction
That Territory North of
"Divide" Fault will Become
Productive in Near Future.
Marcus Daly, whose name is syn
onymous with the progress in Butte,
Montana, and its mining activity, may
become interested in Arizona copper
and particularly in the Warren Dis
trict. This is the inference that
might be gathered from the visit to
this District of H. P. Collins, mining
engineer, and chief field man for the
Daly interests.
Collins has been in the Warren
District for about a week and has
been more or less over the entire War
ren District. He refuses to state
what he is interred in but det lares
that he is looking at two or three prop
erti.'s with a favorable opinion on all.
The engineer is headquartering in
Los Angeles and has been looking ov
er the Arizona field for seveial
months on behalf of his client.
Marcus Daly, heretofore, has not
branched outside of the Butte mining
district and the fact that he has bad
his engineers and his chief field Man
in Arizona with an idea of taking ov
er some property in this state would
indicate further to hat extent the
wonder of Arizona coppers has spread
"Of the various mining camps in
Arizona." said Collins yesterday. "I
think that Bisbee has the bst outlook
of any for the future. In my opinion
Bisbee has just been scratched in
face of the fact that it has produced
more ore than any other mining camp
in this resion of the rountrr.
"I do not predict a boom but I do
expect to see steadv. conservative de
velopment in this District which will
open the eyes of the most pessimis
tic. Another opinion, for which I
may be criticized, is that I think
mines will, eventually, be opened
north of the dividend fault, which ful
ly as productive and rich as any south
of that mythical division between
barren country rock and pay ore.
"There are several very likely look
ing pieces of ground north of the
fault which, with some development
may become bi mines. The other
possibilities of extensions in th1 Dis
trict are enormous."
Collins was at one time the general
manager for the Daly interests in
Butte and was also assistant super
intendent of the Washoe smelter for
the. Anaconda.
He will remain several days in the
District making extensive examina
tions before returning to Los Angeles
where be is making his southwestern
headquarters.

eighteen houses, shops and store hous
es have been erected and roads con
necting with the Tucson Ajo road
have traversed over rough country.
It has been known for some time
that the property of the Mile Wide
Copper company was the site of one
of Pima county's future mines and ev
ery effort has been made to get. larger
machinery, but the usual delays have
occurred, as quick delivery on machin
cry is almost impossible.
Contract has been let to Albert
Steinfeld & Company for the pur
chase and installation of a large com
pressor plant; the foundations are
now in and the plant should be com
pleted within the next two weeks.
The completion of the new power
plant will early be followed by the
Mile Wide entering into the ranks of
the regular producers.
The property is well equipped and
efficiently handled, Mr. Charles P.
Iteiniger, general manager, Mr. H. G.
Brown, formerly of the Mines Compa
ny of America, is superintendent and
Mr. W. J. Block, engineer. About fif

JONES IS CRITICISED
PHOENIX, Jan. 27. Attorney Gen
eral Wiley E. Jones is coming under
the condemnation of many of the cit
izens of Tucson on account of a wire
he is said to have sent to SherifT Miles
of Pima county, to release on parole
certain bootleggers serving terms in
the county jail at Tucson.
It is alleged that Jones usurped the
perofative of the goverr.'jr in doing
this, and the claim is also made that
Sheriff Forbes who preceded Miles at
Tucson released several other prison
ers on a similar order. Jones' con
tention is that the I'jard of paroles
recommended the action and that in
the absence of a de jure governor, no
one unless it is the board of paroles
can look after the interests of the par
ole board.

Career of Success
The mining career of Samuel New
house began in a large sense when he
rounded out what was then the Bos
ton Consolidated property in Bingham
nnd is now the core of the Ftah cop
per companys' vast estate. Mr. New
h"uso saw at once the commercial
possibilities that reposed in the moun
tains of copper porhyries on this prop
erty and it was this discovery that
won the powerful following which
made him for many years the chiel
figure in Utah. His claim for the cop
per poihyries was hotly opposed by
the mining and engineering p'.iurnal
and by Victor Clement and eminent
geologists and engineers in particular.
A coutrovesy raged for some time,
the Salt Lake Tribune regularly pub
lishing .Mr. Newhouse's Bide of the
controversy.
When the Boston Consolidated was
afterwards sold and became the nu-'
cleus of the I tali Copper company. Mr.

Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine
Company Publishes Only
Genuine Ones.
The testimonials published by the
Lydia E. Pinkham Medicine Company
come unsolicited. Before they are used
the Company takes great care to inform
itself about the writer. Never know-
ingly, has it published an untruthful
letter, never is a letter published with-
out written consent signed by the writer.
The reason that thousands of women
from all parts of the country write such
grateful letters is that Lydia E. Pink
ham's Vegetable Compound has brought
health and happiness into their lives,
once burdened with pain and illness. -
It has relieved women from some of
the worst forms of female ills, from dis
placements, inflammation, ulceration,
irregularities, nervousness, weakness,
stomach troubles and from the blues.
It is impossible for any woman who
is well and who
has never suffered
to realize how these
poor, suffering wo
men feel when re
stored to health;
and their keen desire
to help other women
who are suffering as
they did. (

CHICAGO. Jan. 27. Wheat prices
collapsed today under heavy selling
due to rumors that peace was in sight
After an extreme brak of 7 cents,
the market reacted but continued
weak. 1 to 6 cents net lower with
May at 1.73 to 1.73 and July at
1.47 to 1.47. Corn finished to
IV: at 1 down, and oats off half to
l1. Provisions scored gains of five
to twelve and a half cents.
It was not until the last hour of the
session that the flurry was in a meas
ure overcome by week-end evening up
of business.
Bearish sentiment was notably in
creased by the striking absence of
fresh export demand for wheat and
by assertions that railway congestion
was acain as bad as ever.
Corn yielded grudgingly to the in
fluence of wheat weakness. Besides

HEARD ABOUT IT
AH want to try new drug that
dries ud corns so they
'"lift out
Good news spreads rapidly and drug
gists here are kept busy dispensing
freezone. the recently discovery Vf a
Cincinnati man, which is said to loosen
any corn so it lifts with the fingers.
A quarter of an ounce costs very lit
tle at any pharmacy, but Is said to be
sufficient to rid one's feet of every
hard or soft corn or callus.
Ytou apply just a few drops on the
tender, aching corn and instantly the
soreness is relieved, and soon the corn
Is so shriveled that it lifts out with
out pain. It is a sticky substance
which dries when applied and never
inflames or even irritates the adjoin
ing tissue.
This discovery will prevent thou
sands of deaths annually from lockjaw

CONSERVATION OF
NATURAL RESOURCES
(Continued From Page One)
per annum, while in Asia for instance,
this consumption on the enure con
tinent is only a fraction of a ptound.
Asia is in the position the world was
centuries ago. but even Asia may
grow industrially, and if so it will be
necessary to draw upon the primary
resources of the world and mainly ot
America.
Let us see what is involved in the
consumption of coal, oil, and Vres
through industry.
During the past 25 years the popu
lation in the United States has in
creased about 70 per cent while the
important basic industries have been
enlarged at a rate of increase betceen
500 and 600 per cent The entire
world 100 years ago only produced
about 3000 tons of copper per annum.
The United States alone today pro
duces over 600,000 tons. The world
100 years ago produced only about
50,000,000 tons of coal per annum. The
United States alone now produces over
500,000,000 tons. How rang cap this
last and what will happen when ex
haustion takes place? America is the
largest producer in most of these
things. We export more than half ot
our copper. The first result of partial
exhaustion will be increased price.
This of course, will restrain industry.
It will also restrain our ability to de
fend ourselves in war, for every one
knjws that the supremacy of a nation
in war today depends upon its
strength and capacity in oil, coal, iron
and metals. Plenty of soldiers and
even plenty of money are not sufficient
to resist attack. A nation might be
rendered powerless against a smaller
country through lack of industrial
strength. The real reason why an im
passe apparently now exists in the
war in Europe is because in industrial
strength the allies and the central
powers are about equal.
It may be taken for granted, I think,
that every one would agree that our
primary natural resources should be
conserved. The only element of doubt
in the matter would be as to how to
conserve them. There are many ways
of doing this, but as in all big move
ments the first step leading to results
is for people to get together. Con
centration and co-operation are our
first remedies. As Dr. Van Hise has
said: "Through concentration we may
have the economic advantages coming
from magnitude of operations.
Through co-operation we may limit the
wastes of the competitive system."
Take coal, for instance; the late Dr.
Holmes of the. Bureau of Mines has
pointed out that the strenuous Compe
tition and low price at which coal was
produced made it impossible for the
operators in certain portions of the
country to mine the maximum amount
of ccal from the seams that they
worked. In their Competitive struggle
to maintain a place and to keep out
of bankruptcy they were obliged to
mine only the easy places In the seam,
leaving the rest in the ground to be
perhaps never utilized. Dr. Holmes is
on record as saying that 4 per cent of
the coal is wasted in this way. In
all probability this wasted coal can
never be recovered, even at increased
cost, owing t'o physical conditions.
Federal experts in the forest service J
have pointed out that in the lumber
industry practically the came condi
tions exist as in the coal industry. The
best timber only Is taken, leaving oth
er grades to decay and to afford fuel
for forest tires.
In petroleum and natural gas a crim
inal waste is going on. A paper read
at the recent meeting of the American
Mining congress showed that at the
present rate Vf consumption of petro
leum all the known reserve resources
of the United States will be exhausted
in some SO years. The author of this
paper graphic-ally calls attention to
this point as follows:
"I have seen millions of cubic feet
of natural gas wasted in the air-gas
ho rich in gasoline that it dripped from
the trees like au April shower. It has
been testified before the corporation
Commission of Oklahoma that ordin
ary methods leave from 25 to 85 per
cent of the oil in the ground. The state
mineralogist of California estimates

tried out and has proven successful.
It is believed that by continuous at
tendance pupils will be enabled to dc
the grade work in much shorter time
than at present. Pupils who fail in
their work will only drop back a term
instead of a semester.), As children
in Bisbee have very little to do dur
ing vacation, and- as they rest in a
short time, the continuation school
will not w'ork a hardship financially
or injure their health. Children who
are not physically strong, may take a
term off for rest of recreation or a
trip, and will lose but little school
work.
Schools Rank High
As many of 'the pupils of ilisbee are
over age for their grade it will en
able tbem to make up their work, and
enter the high sch'ool at the usual
time. Many of the details of the plan
in retard to the promotions, servit ps
of teachers, and etc.,- are yet to be
worked out. (

l Cafeteria Planned
I The .'choul employs a doctor and
a trained nurse. In this depart
j ment a thorough examination has
i teen made of the children in the dis
trict, and defective eyes, teeth, ears,
j tonsils and etc., are reported to the
parents. In a short time an operating
room will be fitted up in the Central
school, and minor operations will be
' performed by the school physician,
j with the consent of the parent.
! In the future construction of school
buildings, lunch ro'oms will be pro
vided and small cafeteria, where
' school lunches will be served at a nom
inal cost installed. The new schools
will also contain shower baths and
rest rooms for pupils.
Already Bisfcee is noted in the state
for the excellent system of play-
: ground apparatus, which has been
provided i'or the several schools. This
apparatus was placed through 4he gen
erosity of the miners of the Warren
district
Playground Apparatus
The board of school trustees, in fit
ting up new schools, will install nec
essary playground apparatus for the
children.
Thriving Pareut-Teachers associa
j tions meet at Central, Lincoln, Lowell
and Warren, and a Civic club at Don
Luis. The Social life of the pupils is
provided for by holding parties in the
high school gymnasium. These par
ties are carefully supervised and a
committee of high school teachers are
always preseirt and in charge.
It is the policy of the school trus
tees, to maintain the school at its
greatest efficiency, and they always
welcome suggestions and criticisms.
' These men give their time freely to
the school affairs of the district and
their reward is n felins that th- ir

Soon Over His Cold.
Everyone speaks well of Chamber-

it. Mrs. George Lewis, PiUsftcld,
j N. V, has this to say regarding it:
"Last winter my little boy. five years
old, was sick with a cold for t'o or
three weeks. I doctored him and used
various cough medicines but nothing
did him much good until I began using
Chamberlain's Cough Remedy. He
then improved rapidly and in a few
days was over his cold." Adertise-

How much do you know about diamonds?
Would you pay $100.00 for a stone which looked to be worth the
price without the opinion of a reliable judge?
There Is one safe way in buying a Diamond not your own judgment,
not a friend's advice but the opinion and knowledge of experts.
In buying a Diamond here you get the benefit of this opinion and
knowledge of an expert to assit you in your selection. One who has
made diamonds a study one who will explain Cw stones to you in detail
and show you exactlv what you are buying.
Diamonds are a splendid investment at this time as they are always
increasing in value. We are fortunate in the possession of a Bd "elec

INTERNATIONAL BRICK
COMPANY
Among the substantial firms that
have attained a leading place in the
Industrial affairs of Arizona the In
ternational Brick Company, of F.l Pa
so, is one of the best known. The
company was organized 111 ll: any
the officers are: Win. J. Bowen. pres
ident; Thos.. K. Preece. vice-president;
Teddy Bartlctt, second vice-president;
W'm. Dobson. secretary and treasurer,
and J.. F. Driseoll, assistant secretary
and treasurer.
The International Brick Company
manufactures common, rough face and
smooth face brick, and hollow tile for
building purposes. The company sup
plied the common brick for the Kl Pa
so Smelting Works, requiring two mil
lion brick. The city of El Paso and
the in Taso Electric Railway Company
are also regular customers of the com
pany. Rough face brick from these
yards was used in the-eonstruction of
the Odd Fellows Building and the
Terr.ple Mt. Sinai, as well as hundreds
of other buildings in El Paso.
The expanding business of the In
ternational Brick Company necessitat
ed additional burning capac ity and the
company recertlv erected a large rec
tangular down-draft kiln for the ex
clusive use in burning dry press brick
The output of this plant is constantly
growing in demand and compares fav
orably with any brick manufactured
in t!ie southwest.
The factory of the International
Brick Company has a daily capacity
of three hundred tons, and the site
occupied has an area of approximately
six acres. The yards are adjacent to
the tracks of the El Paso and South
western Railroad at the corner of Iee
ard San Antonio streets,' and near the
business district of El Paso. The
splendid shipping facilities include a
spur track sufficient to permit the
loading of six pars simultaneously,
and the eompary is constantly alert
to methods that will increase iU ef
firiercy and keep if in the vanguard
with the progressive institutions of
the southwest.
"Arizona is one of the great slates
in the Cnion." said President Bowen.
"and its remarkable development as a
mining state has awakened the atten
tion of the whole country.'
WELBOURN & DODDS
"If. ;Ve s-toady grow;) of Bisbee
there has always he?n a conservative
progress," said J. M. Welbourn. of the
Welbourn c Podds grocery and meat
house, "and the city has experienced
no spasmodic or uncertain d.;vc'op
.mc :i 0 expansion."
Xumtered with the leading and suc
cessful commercial establishments of
tte district, the firm of Weltourn &
Dodds is enjoying a good share of the
prosperity of the community. J. M.
V.'c-lbourn and S. C. Dodus are the en
ergetic members of the partnership.
For nine years they have been oper
ating a store at 4?,2 Tombstone Can
yon and for the last 3 year at 188
Johnson Addition. The choicest meats
and groceries are carried, aud they
have intellieent and experienced
clerks in all departments.
It is an enterprise that has won suc
cess on meritorious service in its long
career in Bisbee, and is aiding the ad
vancing and growing district.
"Constituting the most Important
part in the industrial life of the dis
trict," said Mr. Dodds, "the mining in
terests are flourishing as never be
fore and are expanding in all depart
ments." THE REX ALL DRUG
STORE
"The unparalleled prosperity now so
prevalent throuchout the country."
snid J. M. nalli of the Rexall Store,
"is more pronounced in the Warren
district than any locality in the south
west." Thoroughly familiar with the Wtr
ren district after a residence here of
more than fifteen years. J. M. Ball is
well qualified to speak on conditions
in this locality. During the last ten
years Mr. Ball has ben the proprietor
of one of the leading pharmacies In
the community and has thoroughly es
tablished th? business 1:1 th city of
l'lsbee.
The Ilexa'l Store is well located on
Main street and is tarrying an excell
ent stoek of drurs, medicines, perfunv
cry. toilet goods, druc-risf sundries
end stationery. A popular soda foun
tain is oper?ted in connection with tho
business. Four registered pharma
cists are employed and all th clerks
are experienced druggists and have
cert 'r: cafes of registration.
The exclusive sale of all the Rexall
preparations in this district is a valu
able asset of the ;tore owned by Mr.
Ball, and this famous lin of medi
cines is receiving the same popular
demand in Bisbee. as in all the larger.
ci'ies o the United P'ates and Cana
da.
"The social, educational and r'lir
ious life of Bisbee is all thnt could be
wished for," said Mr. Ball, "and this
is a phase of the city's activity that
will a pries! t" the family man in'ond
lng to ljcute here."
HENDERSON-W ATKINS
LUMBER CO.
"In its continued growth and devel
opment." said J. R. Henderson of the
Henderson-Watkins Lumber Company,
"Bisbee will experienc e the same solid
advancement in the future as it has
in the past."
J. R. Henderson and E. A. Wr.tkiiu
are the partners in the Henderson A:
Watkins Lumber Co., and boih have
been in Hisbee since ttie early history
of the locality. Air. Henderson was
one of ihe owners of the lumber busir
ness before the present partnership
was formed five years ago ind is one
of the best informed men on the busi
ness in the southwest.
Mr. Watklns

crowing lumber firms of the county
and a high standing in the district.
It is the oldest establishment of the

"The whole history of Bisbee has
been along sound and substantial
Mnrs," said E. A. Watkins, "p.ni the
r.resent satisfactory" conditions would
Indicate a future of the same solid
rrowth."
H. W. GAETJENS
"The growing city of Bisbee is pros
perous and in first-class commercial
condition." said H. V. Gaetjens, auto
repair man, "and I have opened a
business here because I believe in its
future."
Mr. Gaetjens is rot a new resident
of Bisbee, but recently opened the
garage formerly conducted under the
name of the K B. Motor Garage on the
Xaco road. He has long been familiar
with the district and is well known
throughout the community, and for
twelve years has been a taxpayer of j
Hie ciiy. I
The garage is one that is especially
well locate d for catering to the auto- j
mobile trade of the district and is f - j

"I have definite plans for IncreTsin
my equipment here," said Mr. C. r'
jens, "and will soon hare an electric
storage battery and other improve
ments to make the facilities of my
garage larger and better."
ORIENT BILLIARD HALL
"Conipa.-ed with other mining dis
tricts of the southwest," said R. J
Hoffmeyer, "Bisbee is far in the lead
as a prosperous community and is
one of the best commercial towns in
the west."
The Orient Billiard Hall is a popu
lar establishment of Lowell and is
widely known among the leading busi
ness houses of the community. R. J
Hoffmeyer has been operating this
house for many years and has never
lost confidence in the future stability
of the locality.
The billiard hall has five tables, is
conducted in a clean and orderly man
ner and the patrons of this place are
given the best kind of service. Cigars,
tobacco and soft drinks are sold at the
Orient, together with the famous Gold
en Cream Special, a drink that has
proved very popular.
"Many thousands of dollars are go
i"g into new enterprises in Bisbee
from tine to time." said Mr. Hoffmey
er, "and this Is pretty good evidence
that the future of the community is
exceptionally good."
GRANT, THE SHOE MAN
"Bisbee is developing into a city of
larpe commercial inferests," said Hen
ry Grant, the Shoe Man of Lowell,
"and is one of the most prosperous
cities of the state."
There are few establishments of the
district better known than the shoe
store conducted by Henry Crant, in
Lowell. The wide acquaintance of
Mr. Grant and his long residence in
the locality, are in a !rrge measure
responsible for the micccs of the busi
ness.
The Grant shoe store has been es
tablished in Lowell for the last four
vears. and in January occupied the
nrrsent attractive and modern quar
ters. The fine stock includes the
Cresset! and Kndicott-Johnson brands
for men, wo'ien and children pnd the
store is meriting the confidence and
Patronage of the community.
"Kvery year sees Bisbee advancing
end growing." said Henry Grant, "and
here is no longer any doubt of the
tut ure commercial utanding of the locality."

don market is based upon silver U-O
fine, which would make 3b pence tiie
equivalent of 77.S cents for silver
1000 fine.
The situation is strong, owing to
small output in Mexico and the low
state of supplies both in China and
India. The demand for India and high
prices prevailing last May started a
considerable movement of silver from
China, and now that the Chinese ex
port season is on, the demand is
strong there.
The Indian currency reserves are
much lower now than a year ago,
while the currency issues are consid
erably higher, which points to a con
tinuance of government purchases.
Advices indicate that up to the mid
dle of Octooer these purchases had
amounted to 1 40,000,000 to $5u.000,uCO.

BUT 500 ACRES GF
; THE 2000 IT HOLDS
"Tiit-re is absolutely no doubt that
the Warren District is good for thirty
years and more," said 1. B. Joraiemon,
chief geologist for the C. &. A. Com
pany, "and I beiieve that the highest
nuint of production has not yet been
reac.-Kd."
Mr. Joraletuon is a geologist of pro
"n.inence in the southwest and has
travelled extensively in his profession.
A native of northern New York, he
received his early education in the
schools of California, having attended
the Belmont School in that state, and
ihen matriculated at Harvard Univer
sity. In 1905 Mr. Joraiemon received his
degrees of A. B. from the famous uni
versity, and in 1907 after having com
pleted a post-graduate course at Har
vard, was given the decree ol master
of arts.
Joins C. A A. Force
In the same year, he became asso
ciated with the Calumet & Arizona
Mining Company and has continued
with them since, excepting the time
rpent in making several trips to South
America for the Anaconda people.
Mr. Joraiemon has made a broad
and thorough study of geology and is
a recognized authority on the Warren
District, and as chief geologist of the
('. & A. Company is a leading member
of his profession in the United States
A practical and scientific student of
geoiogy, he is giving his est efforts to
a profession in which be is enthusias
tic and successful.
"It Is an interesting fact, said Mr.
Joraiemon, "that out of the 2000 acres
of the C. & A. Company but 500 acres
have been partly explored, and only
15 acres have been worked out."
L. B. WHITNEY
"The mining industry is making
wonderful advancement in all . it
branches," said City Attorney U B.
Whitney, "and this is very noticeable
right in Bisbee where e see one big
company handling at a profit some of
the ore that was discarded years ago.
This company is even cleaning up all
the old slag on a paying basis."
City Attorney L B. Whitney is well
informed on mining conditions
throughout the west and for Mm
yettis was connected with the indus
tiy in Colorado. For the past five
v-ars he has been a resident of the
Warren district and is a well known
citizen of the county.
l" has been an ambitious worker
all his life and this is indicated in the
fact that he stepped from the ranks
of the workinamen to a position of
prominence in the professional activi
ties of the community. He has been
practicing law for several years and
in June, 1318, was elected to the of
fice of city attorney.
As the legal representative of Birt
he Attorney Whitney has won many
friends and is tilling the office w ith a
high older of efficiency, lie is a firm
belieicr i" the ultimate greatness of
in'sbee and Ihe district, and an enthusiastic-
believer ill its steady progress
and deve'opment.
"The way is c leared now for a loifT

State and Federal Legislation
Will be Looked Into With
View of Obtaininst Besl
Laws Possible.
One of tin' rm.ht important plans ol
t lie Arizona State Bureau of Minos in
to onduct a legislative research bu
reau for laws relating to minins, both
state and federal, in conjunction with
the department of legislative research
of the I'niversity of Arizona.
Probably one of the ereatest bur
dens under which the mininc iinluur
rests today is that of confusing arid
ill advised lav.-s. This is particularly
well illustrated in our federal niining
laws which have been tinder fire now
for several years, and which should
be investigated by both state and gov
ernment bureaus with a view to ob
taining n'ore equitable legislation.
Another desirable point to be con
sidered in connection with a legisla
tive research bureau is the securing
of uniform minins legislation through
the various mining states of the west.
While it is not within the province
of the State Bureau of Mines to rec
ommend laws, it can conduct research
es on proposed legislation for both the
state legislature and congress.

"No other locality Tn Arizona ap
peals to me like Bisbee," said William
Truax, Sr., of the English Kitchen
Broiler, "and I consider its future
more secure than any community in
the southwest.''
The English Kitchen is among the
popular eating houses of the locality
and is situated in the heart of the bus
iness section of Main street. The ex-1
cellent service, the well prepared food '
and the inviting surroundings give the j
English Kitchen a prominent place
among the restaurants of the city.
William Truax and his son, William,
are the- managers of the cafe, and
were the organizers of the Juniper
Flats Gold Mining Company.

"Our claims have been investigated
by miring engineers of the highest
standing," said Mr. Truax, "and the
copper-gold-silver ore bodies encoun
tered are very satisfactory to the of
ficers." "We are now sinking a shaft and
will soon build for permanent opera
tions. It is planned then to take the
stock off the market."
"We are prepared to demonstrate
to anyone interested thit we have a
property of rich ore bodies, and one
that will rank with th" fiivider.d-pay-ins

Baby State" Copper Production
During 1916, 675,000,000 Lbs,
HISTORY OF C U IS'
Progressive Methods of Big Company Greatly Responsible
for Development of the Warren District; Ore Bodies Re
garded As Among Most Valuable Yet Discovered in Any
of the Greatest Mineral Regions in the World; Millions of
Pounds of Red Metal Being Produced Every Month.
THE mining industry of the Un-ited States has never witnessed so
active and prosperous a period in its history as the fast two years,"
said General Manager Grant II. Dowell of the Copper Queen Con
solidated Mining Company, "and it is interesting to note that the otal out
put of copper in the I'nited Slates ten je.ir.; ago is equalled by he produc
tion of copper in the state of Arizona alon-? during the jear I91S."
The Copper Queen Consolidated Mining Company has made a phenome
nial record in the production of over one and a half billion pounds of copper,
and a remarkable showing in the disbursement of more than eighty million
dollars in dividends. It is a famous copper producer among the greatest
mines of all time, and its successful o peration made possible the develop
ment of one of the world's noted mining districts.
The mining history of the great w est offers no more fascinating or in
tensely interesting chapter than the s tory of the founding of the Copper
Queen by Dr. James Douglas 35 years ago, followed by four years of aston
ishing production, with an output of 34,500,000 pounds of copper and the
disbursement of 11,350,000 in dividends. A staggering blow suddenly struck
the company with the complete exhaustion of the richest body of ore ever
mined in the-Warren District. The very life of a thriving camp hung in ihe
balance with further explorations, and the future of the whole district wav
ered as the officials followed with a ray of hope a mere knife blade seam,
which dipped from ftie original deposit and all but disappeared. This faint
stringer led the way to one of the greatest and most valuable ore bodies ev
er discovered and immediately gave strength and permanence to the War
ren district.
Several hundred million dollars'
have been paid in wages alone by the
Copper Queen Company, and" three
thousand men are now. on the payroll.
More than 500 miles of underground
openings have been made, and this
work Is continuously progressing at
he rate of 20 miles per year.
The properties of the Copper Queen
Consolidated Mining Company are un
questionably among the greatest mines
inexistence, and in-mense areas have
been blocked out that will require
years to work. It is doubtful if the
Copper Queen has ever produced its
maximum capacity, although its
output now is approximately 90.000,
000 pounds of copper annually.
Arizona, the "baby stale." proved
to be a rather husky infant by
leading every other stale in the
Union in the production of copper
during 1916. Although it had been
predicted that the total produc
tion would not be more than fiOO,
000,000 pounds, the "baby" proved
rathc-r industrious and official fig
ures show the production to have
been 675.000.000 pounds. This is
55,000,000 pounds more than the
aggregate production of the two
nej:t greatest copper producing
states, Michigan and Montana,
who can show but 619,000,000
pounds. Arizona's 1916 output ex
ceeded the total output of the
country for as late as 1902. These
figures show that the "bphy" is in
reality a mineral prodigy.
Production Next Year ,
The greater part of Arizona's
great production has come from a
half-dozen mines. Many more are
now coming into (traduction and
scores of others are possible con
tributors to the staggering volume
of copper n"xt year.
It is, of course, true that the
liii.Ii pi ke ol copper bin. s.i'iiula't
d rctivtty ant! has rdtW iiohab
ly "0O.'iO.",0y.l pounus to the year's
ortout. The wpr. it is equally
true, caused the high price just as
in, the first year of the war the al
lies' embargo on copper to neutral
countries depressed the industry
here with the result that in the
state, for a tima,-some of the
mines were slowl-d down. Since
then though, the demand of the al
lies for America:', copper together
with the demand for home con
sumption has furnished a stimu
lant for the greatest activity in
the history of the industry and
the highest prices since the civil
war. All this time the United
States has been deprived, too. of
half the world market including
its largest customer, Germany. -
Of all the industries in this
country stimulated by the war.
copper production is probably the
only one that will not be seriously
affected by peace. With the end
of the war will come a period of
reconstruction in which copper
will enter much more largely than
into the original construction or
than into the materials which
have been enip!oed in destruction
during the war. Steam railway
lines will be electrified not only
in Europe but slso in this country,
as it has heen found much cheap
er to tiansport electrical er.ergy
than it is to carry coal or oil. Ger
many will require unimaginable
masses of copper to replace the
met.il tiiat has heen used in the
making of shell and other munitions.-
Altogether the peace period
within which there will be an ab
normal den and for copper will be
much longer than the war period
which has furnished an abnormal
demand. And un.il it is satisfied
we do not believe that the present
prices will materially decline.
Treasure Island Is Rivaled By
Stories of Rich Mines Found
and Lost By Early Prospectors
Splendid System
The historical shafts of the Copper
Queen include the Czar shaft, the first
sunk in the Bisbee district; the Hol
brook. Silver Spray, Gardner. Lowell,
Cuprite, Uncle Sain and the Sacramen
to shafts. The splendid system of
mine operation now in force at the
Copper Queen was established nine
years ago, when 17 miles of under
ground tracks, electric locomotives
and side-dumping care were installed
on every second level from the fourth
to the sixteenth inclusive, and the ore
dropped through chutes from the in
termediate levels into the cars. The
Sacramento is a four-compartment
shaft, built with a wall of re-enforced
concrete, having a capacity of 4.000
tons daily and equipped with a power
ful hoisting engine. All the hoisting
of ore and material is concentrated at
the Sacramento, and direct shipments
of ore from the immense storaee bins
at the shaft are made to the big Cop
per Queen smelter at Douglas.
$4,000,000 Expended
This great industry is one of the
largest and most modern in the world
and its maximum capacity is close to
twenty million pounds of -copper per
month. Four million; dollars have
been expended in bringing its efficien
cy up to the highest standard and to
take every possible advantage of the
varied conditions of ore. The build
ing of the smelter was responsible for
the founding of the city of Douglas.
The community is now one of the
flourishing commercial localities of the
state, and the smelter is giving em
ployment to a force of more than a
thousand men.
Employes Safeguarded
The Copper Queen Company in its
conscientious consideration of the wel
fare and protection of its employees,
has gone to the greatest extent to
safeguard the men in their work. Tiie
benefit association, mine safety and
rescue service, pension system and
hospital department all strongly attest
to the Serious effort of the Copper
Queen in this direction.

STRIKES ARE YET TO BE
MADE
"AH through the southwest the min
ing conditions were never better than
at the present time," said Ned Creigh
ton, of the Arizona-Bisbee Copper Co.,
"and Arizona is at the height of a re
markable activity in the operation of
mines."
The Arizona-Bisbee Copper Com
pany Is one of the successful mining
companies that have been organized
during the past year and the outlook
for this company Is far beyond the ex
pectations of those who are support
ing its claims."
The directors of the Arizona-Bisbee
Copper Company are James Letson.
Sr., Bisbee; W. B. Craig, New York
City; Harry Jennings, Bisbee; D. F.
McOarry, Los Angeles, and Nod
Creighton. Phoenix. These men are
all successful and prominent in the af
fairs of the southwest, and their as
sertions regarding the Arizona-Bisbe3
Copper Company are supported by
practical and well known mining men j
of the district.
Strong Directorate
The directorate is one of the strong
est of the newer mining companies of
the state, and is a guarantee of th
splendid opportunity the Arizona I'.is-1
bee Copper Company offers for tin?
conservative investor.
"The seventy claims of our compa-!
ny," said Mr. Creighton. "are located j

mine and were formerly known as the:
Bishee-Consolidated, The Red Moun-'
tain and other claims and groups in

(Continued on Page Eight)
AT the present time Arizona is
in the midst of a period
known to the optimist as
"prosperity," but more correctly de
fined by the conservative as "develop
ment." The eyes of the world have
turned toward this state and the world
is looking with amazement at the
tremendous mineral deposits that
have been proven. In the early days
the mining game was considered the
lot of the adventurer and plenty or
them came to Arizona to seek their
fortunes. It was these men who lived
what is now tradition. Some made
fortunes and still have them; others
found fortunes, only to lose them.
And so it happens that Arizona, like
California, Colorado. Utah and Neva
da, has its "lost mines." Almost un
believable stories are told of wonder
ful treasure vaults found and lost in
the early days. Many of these stories
are scoffed at, but the rich deposits
that have been tapped during the his
tory of the industry indicate that
there was at least a foundation for
truth in them. On the deserts. In the
valleys, and high upon the sides of
glowering mountains lie the bones of
men who believed these stories and
braved the terrors of the land from
which few return, only to cross the
Great Divide before finding the lost
treasurers.
The "Lost Soldier"
Col. James M. McClintock. in his
"Arizona, the Youngest State." tells
of many of these "lost mines." In
Vol. II of this work. Mr. McClintock
writes:
"One of the best authenticated
or these stories was the "I-ost
Soldier" mine. The story has had
little embellishment and, in part,
may be true. Briefly narrated it
is this:
"In the summer of 1S09 Abner
McKeever and McKeever's daugh
ter. Belle, were taken captive. A
number of soldiers -gave chase-.
The Apaches separated into sever
al hands, whose trails were fol
lowed by small detachment!" of
soldiers, the most westerly by Ser
geant Crosswaito and two pri
vates. Joe Wormley and Eugene
Flannigan.
Treasure Vault Found
"Two of their horses dropped of
fatigue and thirst and their pro
visions ran out. Taking some of
the horseflesh witli them, they
struck northerly, seeking water in
what is wnnanA to have been the
Granite Walsh range of mountains
in northern Yuma county. Water
was found just In time to save
their lives, for Wormley already
had become delirious. In the
morning they found the spring
fairly paved with gold nuggets.
Above it were two quartz veins,
one narrow and the other sixteen
feet wide. The soldiers dug out
coarse gold by the aid of their
knives. About fifty pounds of this
golden quartz they loaded on the
remaining horse and then set out
for the Gila River. Less than a
day's journey from the river the
horse dropped dead. Wormley
reached the river, almost dement
ed from his sufferings and unable
to guide a party back into the
desert. '
Search is Futile
"Men struck out on his trail and
soon found Flannigan, who would
have lasted only a few hours long
er. He was able to tell the story
of the gold find, and the rescuing
party went farther to find Cross
waite's body. In a pocket was a
map very roughly made and prob
ably very inaccurate, on which he
had attempted to show the posi
tion of the golden spring. Still
better evidence was secured a few
days later in the discovery of the
dead horse, with the gold ore
strapped to his back. The ore
was all that I'iam.igan claimed
and $1,S00 was rcai'zed from its
sale. '
"Flannigan made several un
successful attempts to return to
the find, but be dreaded the desert
and never went very far from the
river. He died in Phoenix in
ISS0. The district into which the
party penetrated has been thor
oughly prospected during the past
twenty years and contains many
mines of demonstrated richness.
It is possible that the mountain
was the Harquu Hala. The find
might have been the later famous
Bonanza, in a western extension
of the mountain, from which sev
eial millions of dollars in free gold
were extracted. Farther west,
around Tyson's wells, also has
been found placer gold, though
none of these discoveries seem to
exactly fit the snccial conditions
of the Lost Soldier mine.". . . .
Indian Treasures
"Most of the stories of lost mines
had (O them an Indian annex. Us
ually the story ran that the Indi
ans would bring in gold and silver,
but would refuse to tell the secret
''f their wealth. Ross Browne told
in 1863 that at the store of Hoop
er & Hunter. In Arizona City, he
saw masses of pure gold as large
as the palm of the hand, brought
in by the adventurers who state
that certain Indians had assured
them that they knew places in the
mountains where the surface
ground was covered by the same
kind of yellow stones. But neith
er threats nor presents, whiskey,
knives, tobacco, blankets, all the
Indians craved, could induce the
savages to guide the white man to
the fabulous regions of wealth.
"One variety of the "Lost Dutch
man" story concerns the opera
tions of a German who made his
headquarters at Wirkenburg in
the early seventies. He had a
very irritating habit of disappear
ing from the camp once in a while
going by night, and taking with
him several burros, whose feet
would be so well wrapped that
trailing was impossible. He would
return at night, in equally as mys
terious a manner, his burros load
ed with gold ore of wonderful
richness. Efforts at tracking him
failed.
German Disappears.
"The country for miles around
was searched carefully to find the
source of his wealth, which could
not Have been very far distant.
The ore was not the same as that
at Vulture. The location of the
mine has never became known to
anyone, save its discoverer. He
disappeared as usual one night,
and never returned.
"The assumption that he was
murdered by Apaches appears to
have been sustained by a prospec
tor's discovery near Vulture In the
summer of 1893 of the barrel of
an old muzzle-loading shotgun,
and by it a home-made mesquite
gun stock. The gun had been
there so long that even the ham
mer and trigger had rusted away.
Near by was a human skeleton,
bleached from long exposure. The
next find was some small heaps nf
very rich gold rock, probably
where sacks had decayed from
around the ore, and then at a
short distance was discovered a
shallow prospect hole, sunk on a
gold bearing ledge. The ore in
the hepps was about the same
character as that which had been
brought into Wickenburg in the
early days by the "Lost Dutchman
but it didn't agree at all with the
ore in the shallow prospect hole,
tthich was not, considered worthy
of further development.
The Herald Fake
"In the winter of '79 some trou
ble was stirred uo among confid
ing tenderfeet by the publication
of a story in the Phoenix Herald,
printed as a fake so plainly trans
parent that he who ran might
have read. It told of the arrival
of a prospector from the depths
of the Superstitions, whence he
bad been driven bv pigmy Indians,
who had swarmed out of the cliff
dwellings. His partner had been
killed and he had escaped only by
a miracle. But the couple had dis
covered some wonderful gold dig
gings, from which an almost im
possible quantity of dust had been
accumulated by a couple of days
work.
"The story was widely copied,
and from eastern points so many
inquiries came that thn Herald
editor bad to have a little slip
printed to be ent back in reply.
On the slip was the word "fake."
FASCINATING CHAPTER IN

Notable Record Made by Company That Refused to Abandon
Claims at rirst Believed to tie Uut or the Ure District;
Economy of Operation and Energetic Management Re
warded by Rich Returns Now Being Realized by Pro
ducers; Safeguarding Employes Company's Strong Point,
THE present activity and production of the. mining industry of Arizo
na is the greatest in its history," said General Manager John C.
Greenway, of th C. & A. Company, "and the remarkable prosperity
of the whole southwest is aiid in-; immense wealth to the state in
larger bank deposits, greater business in all lines, better hones and a con
tented people."
With the copper production of the Calumet & Arizona Mining Company
more than seventy million pounds dur ing 191ti. the substantial position
of this great mining property among the largest producers in the world is
more secure than at any time in the past. During a year of extraordinary
prices in copper, and the most wonderful activity, increase and improvement
in the mining Industry, the C. & A. has made a notable record in the econo
my of its operation and the enormous quantity of its production.
No more fascinating chapter may be found in the mining annals of the
world than the history of the development of the prosperous C. & A. mine.
The officials of the company at the ve ry outset accomplished one of the
most brilliant and successful undertak inrs in the mining records of the
southwest when they broke entirely away from the proven ore zone of the1
district and located the Irish Mag Shaft and later the Oliver and BrUgs
shafts. These famous mines have made their millions, and he further ex
tension of the company's properties brought forth such equally historical
shafts as the Cole. Hoatson. Courtland and the Junction.
In the construction of the magnificent Junction shaft, the C. & A. ex
pended more than $200,000 and completely walled the shaft with soli-1 con
crete to a depth of 1600 fe"t.
The Junction is a ive-compartinent
shaft and its construction marked one ' transportation service to the locality,

Purchased Claim
Thirty-four years ago L. C. Shattuck
came to the wild and open tenitory
in the Fouthwest from his native state
of Pciui -ania, and ut one time
worked for tiu Copper Queen as a min
er. He pu- ;ased Ihe claim that now
tmbracts uie great Shattuck-Arizona
property, and through his f fforts the
Shattuck-Arizona Copper Company
was organized in 1904. The name of
L. C. Shattuck i.-s irrevocably associat
ed with the stirring history of the
state of Arizona and is mingled with
those of great men who have accom
plished the big things for the south

Industry Will Thrive for Many Years, Says
Professor Charles F. Willis, In Reviewing
Progress Made By Companies Operating
In the World's Greatest Copper State.
BY CHARLES F. WILLIS
Director Arizona S.ate Bureau of Mines.
ROSPERITY is faorin? Arizona. That fact impresses even one who
makes but a short visit. Agricultural development in southern Ari
zonr is gradually assuming an Importance worthy of the larz? area
f opportuni'y. Over and above recla ration projects, which are accom
'ishin: much in trmsforniin vast ex -anses of desert into gardens, the
-aveler can observe on the plateaus the bacine and the clearings of home
headers, who are pandering the way for permanent productiveness with a
'ervor that impresses confidence in the farming possibilities of the state.
But for many more years as In the past many years mining will con
tinue to charm and attract that capital which seeks rapid and profitable re
turn from its investment. The high prices for metals in the markets of the
I world have given added impetus to mining enterprises. The re-opening of
i the Tombstone Consolidated mines by the Phelps Dodge company is proving
a boon to the more or less dilapidated and somnolent town of Tombstone.
I Blsbee is a hive of industry, and has the enterprise and progressive
j spirit of a true American city. It has paved streets, an electric car line
j which winds through a canyon of stores, hotels and homes. I'pon the sides
flanking the sky line for four or five miles, there can be seen mine shaft
j after mine shaft, tail dump after Hil dump the outward sign of the under
ground workings that must aggregate hundreds of miles of shafts, tunnels
. ami drifts.
In Bisbee everybody seems to be 1
: prosperous. The copper mine owners progresfIed during tDe year all,louj;h
... tn.-,r ,,,...- hi .o to
cents per pound. The mires' wages
increase with the pric e of copper-
higher prices mean higher wages. The
merchants find difficulty in obtaining
sufficient quantities of goods to meet
the greater demands. And today, Bis
bee and its suburbs of Lowell and
'Warren (the latter a modernized town
site) are all enjoying a bountiful sea
son of productive activity.
! Speculating on cards seems to be
, supplanted, in a measure, by speeula-
; tion in stocks. Per capita, and
DPr
capita wealth, it is a question if Wall
Street itself can produce more "bulls"
: and "bears"' than can be found roam
ing in the canyon, along the Dividend
Fault.
Copper Queen Consolidated Mining
i Company.
me pioneer company ot tne stale
of Arizona still continues to lead in
the state's chief industry mining,
This company, the Copper Queen Con-
soiia.-.ien. was tne one that laid the
foundation, of Arizona s prosperity in
mining operations.
As is the case with all of the mines
of the Bisbee district, nothiug of a
sensational nature took place during
the year. Progress has been made,
particularly in the line of closer co-
operation between the mine operator
j and tbe employes. As a result of this
, co-operation, and in spite of th.e high
1 8cale r ases due to the increased
J nriee of runner. Ill ar-tuul ff ifim-v
- - . j
of the operations is greater.
! Notable among the changes during
the past year has been the promotion
'he position made vacant by Mr. Doug-
' las'n advancement; the advancement
f Capt. S. P. Hodgson, former mine
i superintendent of the Copper Queen,
to consulting engineer for the Phelps
i Dodge company, ail the promotion of

, eral manager of the Copper Queen, to
j the position of general manager.
Calumet A. Arizona
I Nothing spectacular happened ditr
i ing the year 1510 regarding the oper
ations of the Calumet & Arizona Min-
ing company. Tbev plugged steadily I
along and produced something better
than 65.OtiO.OOt' pounds of copper,
Probably the most noteworthy feature '
of their work was the surplus which
piled up far in rxress of its nerd for)
a large woikii.g capital, for although
I they are earning approximately jj
per share, their annual dividend is
but ?S. although one extia dividend
was declared during the year.
The year has been cne of building
i at th reduction works, and the sul-
' plniric acid plant, with a capacity of
100 tor.s daily, producing a fit) percent
sulphuric acid, has been completed,
The purpose of this plant is to recover
the sulphuric acid from the smeller
fumes, the acid being sold to the
New t'omelia Copper Company to be
used in their leadline operations On
iccoiint of the addition of the large
acid plant, there has been acquired in
addition to the power plant at the
smelter, and the addition of a revcr-
beratorv furnace.
The Calumet i Arizona is on? of
the companies that is suing steadily

is right on hand with the dividend

Bnri , rll3r ,u
of making copper, and with this larse
item thus employed, the cost of mak
ing Shattuck copper is reduced to
around 6 cents per pound.
There Is a large amount of vanadi
um to be extracted from the mines of
the Shattuck-Arizona when the com
pany has completed tests on the pro
duction of ferro vanadate. This miu-
eral alone has been estimated to rep
resent in ia!ue the entire capitaliza
tion of the Shattuck-Arizona Copper
company.
The Shattuck mine is good for many
yen vs. as the greater part of its terri-
lory is yet unexr'.ored. It has always
! teen characterized by good wnjace-
n.rnt, although some impatient people
have criticized it for not producing
and selling copper when the metal
( waa very low. Although the Shattuck-
j Arizona could easily
have earned fair
dividends at dull periods by drawing
upon its large high grade reserves,
and have made money even at 12 cent
copper, time has proven that it wps
wisdom to conserve the mineral.
The Shattuck company has probab
ly obtained a higher average price for
its copper than any other copper mine
in the country.
United Verde Copper Company
A feature of the work of the past
year of the United Verde Copper com
pany has been the blowing in to full
capacity of its new and up to date
'smelter at Clark da 1 and the compl--
tion of the model town of Clarkdale.
A noteworthy change ia the opera
tion of the I niled Verde cam" with

Clark since lfS!. Mr. Clark re

vate interests, and he is succeeded .:t
th? Celled Verde by Robert K. Tal'.v
who has been mine superintendent f.r
eisht years.
Recently- plans were outlined f- r
greater development of the Cnitid
Verde to include the use of stea a
shovels in stripping the surface ore
bodies in the vicinity of the old smel
ter. These plans involve the remov
ing of S.f 10 1"0 feet of over-burden
making it practicable to mine this or
from the surface down instead of by
underground operations adjacent to

The l'nited Verde has bceti and wi'l

the Phelps, Dodge Mercantile Compa
ny is a conspicuous example of the
substantial development of the great
southwest. A subsidiary of the pow
erful Phelps, Dodge & Company, the
mercantile organization has never the
less grown and broadened on its own
initiative and through a remarkable
service to all the people.
System 35 Years O'd
The inception of the Phelps Dodge
Mercantile Company dates back nearly
thirty-five years ago, when the Copper
Queen Company took over a small
grocerv store then established in the
struggling mining camp. Organized
"from the outset with the single pur- i
pose ef supplying all the needs of its
own employes, the original store of
the company in this city soon became
the principal business center of the
I'K-aliiy. The substantial progress of
the company, the remarkable advance
ment of its influence and importance
are rr-enrds of n'ercpntile development
without a rallel in the commercial
anna!:; of Western America.
Economical Service I
Founded on the broad policy of ren- ;
dering a permanent gooi to the whole '
community, the Polps Dodge Mercan
tile Company has concentrated its ef
forts on the matter of economical ser- '
vice, combined with the handling of a ,
standard quality of goods. The great

Slowly Decreasing.
While the production of copper in
tue United States, particularly in Ari

during the last year, other metals
fared not so good. Gold and silver
production in the United States in
1916 fell below that of the year before
by $8,719,300 for gold and 2,077,275
ounces of silver. The director of the ,
mint announces that the total gold
production for the past year was $32,-;
316,400, and the silver production 72,- j
883,800 ounces.
California led the union in the pro
duction of gold with 1.069.5S6 ounces
valued at $22,110,300; Colorado was
second with 919,565 ounces, worth $19,
009,100, and Alaska third with 780,721
ounces, worth $16,242,300.
The other chief gold producing
states are given as Nevada, with an
output valued at $S,42R,2Q0; South
Dakota $7,512,200; Montana $4,575,400
and Utah $3,593,400.
The minimum fifteen ounces, worth

Secretary of New Company
Believes Arizona's Mineral
Possibilities Surpass Those
of Any Other State.
"No state in the Union surpasses
the astonishing extent of Arizona's
mineral possibilities," Said Secretary
J. O. Tonkin, of the Santa Cruz-Bisbe?
Mining Company when interviewed re
cently.
"It is truly marvelous the great de
velopment that has been made in the
state in a few years," he continued,
''and the future is assured of even
more remarkable activities in mining
operations than at any time in the
past."
One of the new companies formed in
recent months to operate in a field of
rich mineral deposits Is the Santa
Cruz-Bisbee Mining Company, an or
ganization that is ready to support Us
representations with affidavits or oth
er endorsement of prominent and hon
ored citizens.
Officers of Company
The officers of the company are J
F. Walker, president; C. V. Hudson,
vice-president; J. O. Tonkin, secretary
and Chas. Albert Smith, treasurer. All
of these men are thoroughly experienc
ed in mining operations, and of un
questioned ability and judgement in
matters of this character.
"The property of the Santa Cruz
Bisbee Mining Company in the Santa
Rita mountains," said Mr. Tonkin, "is
located in the highly mineralized Tyu
dall district. Here we have 200 acres
or ten claims in all, and on this prop
erty is a large fissure vein from 40 to
60 feet wide that is highly mineralized
on the surface and assays from $1 to
$12.60 in gold per ton.
Returns Are High
"Recent assays of ore from the
main vein gave returns in lead. ziu
and silver of $11.9:; per ton. In the
tunnel now being driven the assays
gave a value of $75.53 per ton and the
average is increasing as we proceed
with the work.
"The Santa Cruz-Bisbee mine is a
reality; the ore is there to be seen by
and one Interested, and it is to be J
veioned bv tunneling nnd not by costly
shafts, hoists and pumps.
"The location, the advantages in
timber and water, together with acces
sibility, make the development of this
property one of the most tinuMi;tl Ir
the history of mining operations in the
elate."
The company is capitalized for one
million dollars, divided into one mil
lion shares, p:ir value one dollar, and
the stock is fully paid and non-assessable..

Mines of State Show 1 23 per cent
Gaia During Past Year; Red Metal
Production Lauded By U. S. Official
T
HK production of gold, silver
copper, lead and zinc irom
mines in Arizona during 1916
had a record total value of nearly
$203,000,000, compared with $90,
80C313 for 1015, according to the
esti.ii.Ue of Victor C. Heikes, ot
;re United States Geological Sur
vey, depart :r,ent of the interior.
The notable output of copper and
the high prices of metals both as
sisted in this increase of 123 per
cent.
The production of gold from Ari
zona mines increased from $4,
166,025 in 1!)15, to approximately
$4,427,000 in 1916, an increase of
over 6 per cent. The production
of gold from copper ores in most
counties was naturally greater
than in 1915, but there was a
marked decrease in the output of
bullion from amalgamation and

cyanide mills, particularly in Mo
have and Maricopa counties. Sev
eral new gold mines were added
to the list during th? year, es
pecially in the Oatman camp, Mo
have county, but the production
was not sufficient to offset the de
cline in the output of the older
properties. A new 200-ton mill
was being completed for the Unit
ed Eastern property, and consid
erable ore was epenr d at the Big
Jim and Cold Ore mines.
The production of silver from
the mines increased from .".fi!.),
020 ounces in 1915 to a record out
put of about 6,S2.".00 ounces in
1916. As the market price was
much higher, the value increased
from $2.S6 1,053 to nearly $4,490.
000, an increase of nearly 57 per
cent in value. There was no great
change in the production from the
Commonwealth property, which Is
principally a silver producer, so
the increase is to be credited
largely to the remarkable output
of copper ore.
All Records Broken
The mine output of copper sur
passed all records and estimates,
as it increased from 459.:i72.2IC
pounds in 1915 to approximately
t9::,0(in.tMHi pounds in 1916. The
value el lhe output on account of
the unusual market, increased

from $80,495,152 to nearly $180.
O0O.00O. The increase of 133 per
cent in the value of copper alone
in Arizona was therefore more
than the value of the total output
of the state in the previous year.
All the smelting plants of the
state were worked at full capacity
and made much greater shipments
cf copper bullion. The plant .it
Sasco, in FMma county, was auain
operated and made a large contii
bution. The inspiration mine was
milling nearly 500,000 tons in Aug
ust and was producing ll.OOO.OuO

made it one of the largest produc

"The many new mining prospects in
the Warren District would indicate a
future of great possibilities for the lo
cality," said Thomas Higgins, of the
Higgins Mine Company, "and I am op
timistic regarding my own holdings in
the district."
The Higgins mine was first opened
sixteen years ago and had been oper
ated by different companies until Mr.
Higgins commenced working the mine
himself about a year ago. A shaft has
been sunk to the 300-foot level and
nine cars of ore a week are now being
shipped to the Douglas smelter. It Is
one of the valuable holdings of the dis
trict. "Bisbee and the whole Warren Dis
trict are certain to continue prosper
ous and progressive." said Mr. Hig
gins, "and with the large mining inter
ests planning for a long period of acti
vity there is no reason why the locali
ty should not advance and steadily
push forward."
DIRECTOR OF OFFICIAL
(Continued From Page Two)
When New Cornelia gets into action
it will add about 32.000,000 pounds of
copper to the annual output of the
state, and will make it as cheaply as
it is produced from the Calumet & Ari
zona ores at Bisbee. or under 8 cents
per pound, and this will be done on
ore running less than 2 per cent cop
per, although New Cornelia has ore of
better grade. It figures safely, howev
er, on a product yielding 1 per cent
copper.
United Verde Extension
Probably the most spectacular of all
the mining operations in this state
during the year 1916 has been that of
the I'nited Verde Extension Mining
company, which jumped from the first
of the year from an undeveloped pros
pect to a full-fledged dividend paying
mine the latter part of the year. Not
alone is development work going on
steadily and rapidly, but new con
struction, a new shaft, new hoist house
and power plant, and tramway have
been put well under way. Now comes
the announcement that the first of that
year 1917 will see a smelter, to he lo
cated In the Verde valley near Clark
dale, which smelter will probably pro
duce in the neighborhood of 5.000,000
pounds of copper per month.
Many wild guesses have been made
as to the real value of the ore in thei
Verde Extension mine; a recent re
port of the board of directors stated
that "the ore in sight between the
l:;00 and 1400 foot levels is conserva
tively estimated at over 700.000 tons,
assaying better than 16 percent. At
16 cents per pound for copper, this
would have a value of approximately
$5t.tH'0.000; at 23 cents for copper"
content the value would be more than
$5i.noo,oo0. While no estimate can be
made of the size of the ore body above
the 1100 foot and below the 1400 foot
levels, the aggregate tonnage yet to
be proven in all probability will be
found to exceed the tonnage develop
ed between the 1300 and 1400 foot lev
els and the value of the mine will he
proportionately greater. Thus it will
be seen that there is sound and ample
reason for the spectacular actions of
the Verde Extension.

Every day the Old IHnniuion is add

A government scout, John Dunn,
first discovered the mineral resources
of this district on August 2, 1 S77, with
a pnrty that included Lit'ut. J. A. Ruc

extent of the mineral district of which
he was one of the discoverers.

Dr. Douglas' Story
Dr. James Douglas, who even then
was a mining expeit of international
repute, came to Arizona in 1S:0 to in-j and o er two years on exploration
sped the United Verde mine at Je
rome, which lie decided was then too
far from transportation to prove a
profitable property. The following
year Dr. Douglas visited Bisbee at the
request of his friend, Riley. The little
furnace was then turning out about
one pound of copper for every four
j that had not yielded a carload of ore.
j There was a meeting with me in New
j York. The only underground trail I
j could recommend as wotth following
j was a narrow vein or ore crossing our
i line from the big Queen ore body. Mr.
Williams considered that he had no
rinht to follow it. We could only-
re consolidated in J w, and certain
ly better terms would have been grant
ed had it been foreseen how nearly
the property which the Queen compa
ny put into the combination (Copper
Queen Consolidated Mining Company)
had been worked out.
"The terms of amalgamation arrived
at after some months of negotiation
were that the capital of the Consoli
dated was to be reduced from two hun
dred and fifty thousand shares of .lrt
each to Sl.JOO.OnO am! that the Atlan
ta company was to receive $2M).00'i in
cash ar.d two-sevenths of the capital
stock.

DOUGLAS RESIDENTS
ENTHUSIASTIC OVER
CITY'S POSSIBILITIES
. Operation of Big Smelters and
Mining Activity Below the
Border Bring Prosperity to
Community.
Only the homecoming traveler can
renlize the beauties and attractiveness
of the city of Douglas. Why should it
not be spoken of as a transplanted
eastern city, when its citizens come
from every state in the I'nion? It is
the cosmopolitanism of the east with
the frankness of the west.
Douglas has dreams of Empire. This
section of the great southwest is an
empire of wealth in her producing
mines. The millions of tons of ore
blocked out, show that the output of
the past few years is but the prelimi
nary to the shipments of the future.
The mines have merely been scratch- j
ed. Why should the owners of Doug
las' mammoth smelters spend millions
for improvements if they did riot know
of the long years of work ahead of J
them in reducing the ores?
Rich Mineral Region
To the south, in the state of Sonora,
the richest of all Mexican states, are
untold millions of wealth yet to be
minec".. The wealth of Midas is to be
found there. Through Douglas must
come thin mineral. Through Douglas
must be shipped the supplies to devel
op this empire. The steady growth of
Douglas during the past few years,
while conditions in Mexico have been
unsettled, is as nothing compared to
what it will be when peace is perma
nently established.
The position of Douglas is an excel
lent one.
The agricultural development of the
ereat Sulphur Springs Valley is in its
infancy. The government lands now
open for entry in that valley will soon
be a thing of the past. Gas engines
and centrifugal pumps are being in
stalled. Water is in abundance.
No spot in all the sunlight zone of
the great southwest Is as near to per
fect as the 4.000 foot elevated mesa,
noon which is situated the city of
Douglas, claim its citizens. The joy
of living in this climate alone will at
tract the tourists. A well laid out
city; the best schools in the entire
state, and that standard is high;
churches of all denominations; homes
and modern business houses; throupn
train service with but one change of
cars from New York to Ios Angeles;
these are a few of the reasons why
Douglas feels confident of a gr?at fut
ure. .
It is not generally known, but no
city in the entire state of Aiizona can
show t lip steady consistent gain in
population that is taking place in
Douglas. Horn in 1901, conservative
estimates show that Douglas has a
population of about 16,!00 within its
corporate limits. The scholastic pop
ulation is 3300. while the schools em
ploy a stafT of 101 teachers.
Citizens Confident
The postal receipts In Douglas show
a larger percentage of Increase than
anv other city in the state.
The deposit growth of the two
Douglas banks is another criterion of
steady growth and progress. The last
bank statements show about $4,000,
000 on dnosit. This is about double
the deposits of three years ago.
The combined smelters have a pay
roll of pbout 1S50 men. which, together
with the railroad shons. means a
monhlv disbursement of over $300,000
not -.taking into consideration the ex
penditures made every thirty days by
the United States government in main
taining its soldiers on the border at
Doualas. which is conservatively esti
mated at about $250,000.
The character of the smelter and
railroad employes give to the retailer
of Douglas good reason for faith In
the future of business conditions.
Starting up some fifteen years ago,
the smelter fires ha'e never been per
mitted to go out and as a result have
furnished a steady stream of pay
checks semi-monthly to the men.
The citizens of Douglas have faith
in their citv; their dreams of the fut
ure are not nightmares.
In northern Mexico are great num
bers of small mines, cattle ranches
and villages. The retailer, as well as
the wholesaler, in Douglas, has first
chance in supplying this trade with
merchandise, machinery, provisions
and mining supplies.

HOOD & BLEDSOE
1 "There are substantial reasons to
feel that thp whole county is on the
solid rock of permanent prospprity."
i paid r. C. Bledsoe of tlie auto supply
firm of Hood & Bledsop. "and that
; business conditions will continue on
tn" ,ines of prosperity and prop
ress.
J. T. Hood and F. C. Bledsoe are
partners in one of the solid and pro
gressive firms of the county, and their
enterprise and ability is reflected in
the successful institution they have
develoned. The present partnership
was formed about three yars ago ana
has its h adqnarters in Douglas, with
a branch in Bisbee, and both places
are doing a thriving business.
The Douglas establishment of Hood
k Bledsoe was occupied in July, 1916,
and is a handsome and pretentious
structure, with dimensions of SO by
138 feet. The building has a balcony
nearly half the floor space of the main
room. The building was planned for
the special use of Hood & Bledsoe and
comprises evpry modern facility in
storage and show rooms, repair shop
and many other advantages.
In the city of Bisbee. Hood & Bled
soe are operating at a great disadvan
tage because of limited working space,
and for many months the firm has
been negotiating for larger quarters.
Hood & Uledsoe have the Ford agen
cy in the district and the demand for
this automobile is so great that buy
ers have been waiting for months to
get their car, and the machines are
taken as fast as they arrive.
The firm handles a large stock of
supplies for autouiobjle owners and if '
constantly enlarging its accessory
line. It is a valuable establishment
to the county and a strong factor in
promoting the commercial prestige of
the district.
"The automobile owner in Cochise
county may use his car twelve months
out of the year," said Mr. Hood, "and
the good roads of the district make it
a genuine pleasure to drive an auto
mobile throughout the year."
H. S. HILLMAN
"I have always been optimistic for
the future of Bisbee." said H. S. Hill
man, cigar store proprietor, "and just
now I am more enthusiastic than ever
in looking forward to the bright era in
store for the community."

"The stability of the Bisbee camp
is conceded by all who understand the
situation," said R. S. Baxter, of the
Baxter Garage and Livery, "and I am
confident that the present prosperity
is to continue for many years to
come."
Baxter's Garage & Livery is located
in the heart of Lowell and has ample
interior space for the installment of
machinery and for doing repair work.
In front of the garage is an excellent
space for parking purposes. New and
comfortable cars are in the livery ser
vice of the firm, including the latest
seven passenger Studebaker and a late
model Dodge. Only tiie most careful
drivers are employed and the service
is high-class throughout.
"I am investing in this new place
with the object of staying here per
manently," said Mr. Baxter, "and I
look to the future of Bisbee with the
fullest confidence in the upbuilding
and growth of the whole district."

Both Communities Will Benefit
By Co-operation Says Secretary
Of Smelter City Organization
(By Oscar K. Goll)
Secretary of the Douglas Chamber of
Commerce & Mines.
FEW people hat'e not. read the
story of Oi o:d man and hi.-
bundle of sticks; how he used
this homely means to show to his sons
the value of sticking together, fighting
side by side, and each maintaining his
share of the common burden. A more
modern term for the fable would be
I "team work."
If the same old man could return to
Cochise county today, he doubtless
would feel called upon to gather an
other bundle of twigs, assemble the
leading citizens of Douglas and Bisbee
and show them how easy it was to
break one stick, but how difficult, in
fact impossible, to snap all of them at
one time. Then he would say:
"There is your lesson, sons of the
1 operating and fighting for, not at. one
another, you win be able to increase
your efficiency an hundred fold. Team
up; hit the line hard, each working
for the other and taking his portion of
the benefits. You will gft more and
get it easier than you had imagined
possible."

DOUGLAS. ARIZ.
Bisbee can exist without Douglas,
but not prosper, because her interests
and ours are too closely allies to stand
separately.
Bouglas can exist without Bisbee,
but not as a prosperous community.
The unsmelted ores of Bisbe's
mines and tne nreless smelters 01
Douglas would be the answer were
the sentiment of rivalry' ever to devel
op to the point where the miners felt
they could not work with the smelter
men, and the smeltermen felt that
they were debasing themselves oy
handling ore mined in the Mule moun
tains. But things do not work out that way
In Bisbee the mining division gets
out the ore. while Jn Douglas, the
smelting division speeds up its plant
to handle the mine output. Either is
helpless without the other, for without
ore the smelters must stand idle, whiln
without the smelters the mine force
would be reduced in short order to a
few watchmen.
Team work is the thing. When the
mines and the smelters have complet
ed their separate functions, the result
is copper. The copper is sold and the
miners and smeltermen are paid.
When the smeltermen draw their
checks, they give the breath of life to
business activity in Douglas.
There you have the story in a nut
shell. Bisbee is the eldest sister, scarred
by years of toil in behalf of the young-
Douglas. Long before Douglas
ws dreamed or. Hisbce. felt sunicient
unto herself; competent to fight her
battles with the world unaided and
alone. ,
But the topography of the moun
tainous' region in which Bisbee was
born mnde it impossible for her sons
and daughters to work and play amid
the dense smoke from her smelter. A
more roomv situation, where smoke
could spread and be blown away by
the winds which swept the prairies,
was needed. Thus Douglas was born,
Bisbee has withstood the torture of
a continuous surgical operation in or
der that ore might be gouged from
her insides for her Little Sister. And
Little Sister Douglas accepted the sac
rifice, took the ore and smelted it.
Then the little sister began to grow
up and become beautiful. Her chil
dren became more numerous. They
and their cousins in Bisbee began to
be jealous of one another, forgetting
the lesson their tw mothers contin
ued to teach them by their daily co
operation and independence. Jealousy
led to little spats and' the little quar
rels to larger ones, until they were
magnified to mountainous proportions
in the view of the cousins.
Then when the Bisbee cousins want
ed something, instead of asking their
cousins in Douglas to help them, they
IN THE WARREN DISTRICT ARE
set out to take it. And the Douglas
cousins, human naturewise. sulked i
and balked, then fought and Bisbee
lost. Then Douglas wanted something !
and went out to get it without asking
Bisbee's co-operation. The result was :
the same. It has been in the past and
will continue to be in the future, as ,
long as the communities buck against
one another. '
Both Cities Growing
Douglas is a healthy younsj city. ; s a well known resident of the coin
growing rapidly. Her population is munity and a popular citizen of the
increasing fast. Hut she has no pie- i district. Formerly employed with
ponderance of population in Cochise
county.
Bisbee has got her second wind and
is adding to' her growth in a wonder
ful way. She. like Douglas, cannot
take what she wishes.
Bisbee and Douglas together repre
sent the majority of the county's pco-
pie. Combined they form a gigantic I
figure, imbued with strength, which
can accomplish wonders.
Is it n"t foolish for the two commu
nities to fritter their strength away in
useless effort, separately, when by
combining on any given project they
can put it through with ease?
There are things Bisbee wants that
Iouglas could betp her to get. Doug
las wants other things that Bisbee can
help her attain. Working together,
thfc two can accomplish wonders. If
they wprk separately the old story of
cross purpeses. bitter feelings and lit
tle gain w!ll continue until both come
to their ppnses.
Study i he fable of the bundle of
sticks, look at what is going on around
you every day. Study the organization
of the average corporation. Every
where you will see thp same things:
Co-operation and success; individuals
fighting arr.ting themselves ami either
getting nowhere, or lacking greatly in
the total of what might be done.
Suppose there is a fire. The alarm
ji3 sounded. The department members
busy quarreling among themselves,
fail to respond readily, so the flames
gain great headway. They finally do
respond but they are unable to decide
just what to do. One thinks a line of
hose should be used on one side of the
building, another believes it should be
used on the opposite side. They quar
rel some more and the firse destroys
the building because they can't agree.
Compare their methods with thosn
of the efficiently organized depart
ment, which responds to the alarm
promptly, works as a unit and quench
es the fire, saving the property.
There are a lot of "burning ques
tions" in which both cities are inter
ested . They cannot be settled any
other way than by co-operative meth
ods. Bisbee and Douglas have been
quarreling too long over the way to
lay the hose. Let's quit it and get to
gether for our common good.

result was that during the period of
depression Mr. Martin and Mr. Riley's
interests were sold, in great measure,
to Mr. James and Mr. Dodse. They
had not only the courage to buy, but
to advance the company already in
debt, money with which to build new
works of larger capacity, better design
and a more convenient locality. They
were erected on the hillside just north
of the Czar shaft and contained four
thirty-six furnaces, to which model
Mr. Lewis Williams was still attach
ed. The capacity of the new works
we estimated would double the output
to 1,000,000 pounds per month and the
facilities and improvements would en
able us to make some money, but not
much.
New Works Blown
The old works were abandoned in
August, 1&S6, and the new works with
the shutdown and a reasonable
amount of exploration were included
in the estimate, but our calculations
were disturbed by an unusually wet
season, and therefore when in the
spring of 1887 the new worka were
started, the Queen owed on its mort
gages to the Atlanta owners and for
advances about $300,000. Prices still
continued so low that at a meeting in
New York, before I went west in Oc
tober to inspect the Seven Devils dis
trict in Idaho. I recollect that the
most flattering anticipations we could
entertain was that at existing prices
it would take three years to pay off
j our debt. Before I returned east the
French syndicate had been organized,
and we were negotiating sales to M.
Secretan for three years at 1V. 13' i,
and V'i cents.

GOOD AS EVER
Jacob Schmid, one of the Dis

in Speaking of Future.
"I am conviii'ftl lhat the Tiiir-s of
the Warren District." said Jacob
Schmid. "are just aR .gc.oj today as
thfy were when firs' commenced lna
r.y years ago."
A loyal Jiii.l optimistic citizen of tlx
community. Jacob Schmid is unions
the most influential ami valued resi
dents of Bisbee, and at all times has
been an enthusiastic and earnest sun
porter of the city. For 3r years he has
watched the locality jitnw from a
mere settlement and froniier town, to
a municipality of financial, industrial
mid commercial importance.
His Early Life
Jacob Schmid is a native of Switzer
land and, when a young man. came to
the west and was soon located in Cali
fornia, where he was employed by
Den Williams in the famous Modoc
mine of Inyo county. Through the in
fluence of his friend, Williams, he was
given a position in Bisbee and for 20
years held the responsible position of
master mechanic for the Copper Queen
Company. During his service for the
company Mr. Schmid supervised all
the heavy construction work, includ
ing the building of the old smelter.
Since retiring from the big position
with the Copper Queen Company, Mr.
Schmid has been active in the im
provement of his property holdings in
L'istee and his investments in build
ing business blocks has proved not
only profitable to him, but has been of
the greatest assistance in the growth
of the city.
Started Building Boom
The Jacob Schmid block and the
Schmid-Shattuck building are the on
ly two structures in which he is now
interested in Bisbee, although he has
bui'.t and sold some of the most valua
ble blocks in the community. The
erection of the Jacob Schmid block in
1S01 gave the first real impetus to the
upbuilding of the town of Bisbee, and
at once placed the real estate of the
locality on a firm ani substantial bas
is Mr. Schmid is today, as he hes been
fur years, a personal factor in the
commercial advancement and indus
trial growth of Bisbee, and is repre
sentative of the men who are support
ing measures that promote the gener
al welfare of the community at large.
"The soundnet.s-and-stability of. the
mining industry "of the Warren Dis
trict," said Mr. Schmid, "is too strong
to" Question the future of Bithte or the

"The astonishing prosperity of the
great industry contributing to the up

Mayor I. C. K. Adams, "is expanding in
every department and gives prospects
for even more flourishing conditions
than at the present time."
Mayor Adams is the owner of valu
able improved property in Bisbee and
is numbered with those who are resi
dents of the locality from choice. It
Is his proud privilege that he intends
to make this his permanent home. The
mayor is now- serving his second term
as chief executive of Bisbee, and is
giving the city an efficient adminis
tration. "The difficulty to secure houses and
the demand for mercantile space,"
said Mayor Adams, "nil clearly show
the prosperity of the city and the
growth and development along all
lines."

The modern pumping facilities of

HUNT ACCEPTING GENTLE
IT OF JURISTS, W LL
VACATE OFFICE
(Special to Review.)
PHOENIX, Jan. 27. Governor Campbell has arranged
with G. W. P. Hunt to take possession Monday morning at 9
o'clock. ' The transfer was arranged on behalf of Mr. Hunt
through his secretary, Leroy Ladd.
PHOENIX, Jan. 27. The supreme court late this after
noon handed down an opinion holding Thomas E. Campbell to
be the defacto governor of Arizona. It was signed by Justices
Franklin and Ross, Justice Cunningham submitting a dessent
ing opinion. The majority opinion holds that the certificate
of election issued to Campbell
election and that he is therefore de facto governor. The court
issued no writ, stating its belief that Governor Hunt would de
, liver the office, but declaring that if he did not on the expressed
opinion of the court, a writ would issue.
Cunningham Opposes.
In the dissenting opinion Justice Cunningham opposed the
writ on the ground that mandamus was not the proper remedy,
two others being at hand, proceedings in quo warranto and the
contest now pending. He further opposes the granting of the
writ on the ground that Mr. Campbell is de facto state tax
commissioner, having been elected two years ago for a term of
four years and that he has not resigned that office. If the con
test should result in' favor of Governor Hunt, according to
Justice Cunningham, Mr. Campbell would be in the position
of having held two offices at the same time in violation of the
law. 1
Quoting from High' on "Extraordi
nary Legal Remedies," Justice Cun
ningham holds that the effect of the
writ of mandamus is to place two gov
ernors in office.
Two Favor Campbell l
As to the contention of Justice Cun-!
ningham that as tax commissioner '
Mr. Campbell Is ineligible to hold the J
office, of governor, the majority opin
ion holds that "a tax commissioner is i
not prohibited from holding any other j
position of trust or profit during his I
term of otfice but the effect of the pro- J
vision of the statute is that if a mem-!
ber of the commission does so, he by
that very act vacates his office as tax
commissioner." Thus when Mr.
Campbell received his commission
and took and filed his oath of office
Jie unqualifiedly accepted the office of
eovernor and ipse facto vacated the
office of tax commissioner.,
Concerning the contention that Gov
ernor Hunt was the de facto gover
nor and that therefore mandamus
should not issue, the majority opinion
says:
Seat Campbell on Face of Returns
"li it could be established here that
the defendant was in fact elected gov
ernor, mandamus, of course, would
not issue but the Insurmountable dif
ficulty is that such fact cannot be de
termined but must be adjudicated in
another forum. The canvass and cer
tificate of election are no evidence
of who was in truth elected governor,
but they are prima facie evidence of
the result, and they constitute the
highest evidence of the prima facie
title that the law requires."
In conclusion the majority opinion
assumes that Governor Hunt will
"gracefully yield a temporary pos
session to depend on a judicial deter
mination of the ultimate right" a def
erence due from the supreme power
in one department of the governor to
the highest authority in another de
partment. ISut. "if it should become
necessary, a showing may be made
and the writ prayed will then be is
r.ued." Hunt Yields
In a brief statement tonight Gov
ernor Hunt paid that he would not ap
pear at the state house on Monday
and that the office and its belongings
would 1e surrendered to Governor
Campbell.

'Mexicans Were De Factos
American Troops Chase In
to Mexico . After Them
Mexican Blood Spilled.
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Jan. 27. Some
slight anxiety was displayed at the
war department today over the out
come of the skirmishing between Mex
icans and American ti'oops on border
near Ruby, Arizona. No official re
port was received but unofficial re
ports indicating that the Mexicans
might be de facto government troops
gave rise to the suggestion that the
encounter might develop a complica
tion, delaying the withdrawal of Per
shing. Such a contingency, however,
was not believed likely.
NOGALES. Jan. 27. Mexican Con
sul Delgado arrived here from Tucson
by automobile tonight. Mr. Delgado
said that he was communicating with
General Calles and Governor Flores
in an effort to secure an order with
drawing the Mexican troops from the
district opposite Ruby, in order to
prevent raids across the line.
ARIVACA, Ariz, Jan. 27. The
Mexicans who have been keeping
up a running gun fight with Amer
ican troopers and cowboys at .
Ruby, Arizona, were driven across
the international boundary today
by Americans who followed across
the line. The Mexicans took ref
uge in adobe houses but were
routed out by troopers, and the
houses burned. The Mexicans
have fled to the hills. The Amer
icans have recrossed inte Arizona.
The fight started Frmay morning,
when American cowboys saw Mexi
cans rounding up cattle on the Am
erican side of the boundary line, ac
cording to Americans arriving here l"
night. Fifteen cowboys, it is asserted
returned the fire of about twenty Mex
icans who kept up the fight until they
were safe behind rocks on the Mexl
can side of the line.
No Americans were killed or wound
ed but a bloody blanket found in an
adobe house the Mexicans used as a
fort indicated the American sh'.its took
effect. There were other evidences of
Mexicans being wounded.

EL FASO, Jan. 27. Like a liv
ing painting, the American troops
of Major General Pershing's pun
itive expedition tramped along
the high road leading from Colo
nia Dublan to the border today on
the first leg of the march which
will be the closing chapter of the
Mexican campaign after Francis
co Villa.
20 Miles Nearer Home
Infantry, cavalry, artillery and
motor trucks moved along the
tree-lined highway, which winds
across the plateau overlooking
the Casas Grandes valley like the
old prairie schooners of the days
of Forty-Nine moved across the
plains on the sunset trail. To
night the troops were encamped
along the road with the head of
the column resting near Hirsch's
Hole, 20 miles north of the Mor
mon colony where General Persh- .
ing has made his field headquar
ters since the expedition ceased
its pursuit of Villa arid his band
of followers, arrivals at the bor
der said.
The last reveille at the field
headquarters was blown before
dawn today and by sunrise the ad
vance guard of the expeditionary
forces was well on the way to
ward the border, according to
Americans who came from the
front late today on truck trains,
to Columbus, N. M.
General Pershing and his stafT were
expected to be among the last to
leave the held headquarters and will
ride to the first night's encampment
in automobiles with the tear guard,
these arrivals said. The long march
to the Mexico-American border will
be resumed tomorrow, it was said.
To Cross in Week
The Associated Press was the first
to inform General Pershing of the
formal order for the withdrawal of
his column today and he immediately
made a change in his plans for the
exodus, the soldiers reported tonight
upon their arrival here. Instead of

Names of All Contestants Must
Yesterday, The Daily Review,
announced the inauguration of a
voting contest for the women of
Bisbee and vicinity. Today it is
the talk or the town. Already
speculation is rife as to the prob
able candidates and before a week
passes the candidates will have
outlined their different campaigns
and the contest will begin iu earn

is this: The women of this vicin
ity fully appreciate the value and
niagniheance of the prizes to be
awarded.
I Biggest In State
Never in the history of contests in
the state of Arizona has so generous
an offer been made by any newspaper.
Three great big beautiful automobiles
and seven other valuable and magnifi
cent prizes are ro be awarded at the
close of this short contest. Kveryone
who has so far heard of it have the
same comment to make: "That's go
ing some." But it is an honest fact
and what is more, any young woman,
married or single, of Bisbee or vicin
ity will have an equal 'opport-nity to
display her ingenuity as a vote getter
and thereby become the possessor of
one of the beautiful machines.
This is to be remembered: The
prizes in this contest will be award
ed solely on meriL It is not a lot

tact and perseverance are the main
requisites in a successful campaign.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINCTON, Jan. 27. With
drawal of the American military
expedition in Mexico was ordered
and by the end of another week
the entire command, after ten
months on Mexican soil, probably
will have recrossed into the Unit
. ed States. '
The order went to General Persh
liin, in command at the border, and
left to his discretion the exact time
of starting the northward movement
and the details of .carrying it out. For
several weeks he has known of the
administration's determination to or
der the troops back to the border and
under his direction the expedition has
been concentrated for the long march.
Officials here understand that some
advance units already have started
north and believe that within forty
eight hours the whole column will be
in motion.
Will Relieve Guards
At the border the regulars will re
lieve a considerable portion, if not
all. of the national guardsmen remain
ing on duty there. Already about 25.
000 of the state troops in the border
patrol have been ordered home and
this movement probably will be un
der way by the time Pershing's men
arrive on American soil.

Although officials have been, silent
on the subject of Mexico since the
failure of the .joint commission, in
dications outwardly have connected
the withdrawal with Carranza's refus

U is the claim thai a person legally
executed by electrocution is simply
stunned and that. lite is not extinct.
Mr. Bennett, who will be remember
ed for his stage and screen versions
of "Damaged Good.-;," plays the role
of "Judge ;'irby" in "And t!ie Law
Says."
Judge KirL" is the stern judge who
believes thai existing laws should be
enforced to the letter, irresponsive of
whether or not individual injustice be
done.
In his youth the jut'gc jAised in a
c ollege town under an assumed name,
just as a lark, and while still lark
ing had a love affair with the daugh
ter of a college professor. Later find
ing that the affair with the daughter
had developed a serious aspect, he de
parted, still under his assumed name.
The mother of his child is betrayed
by Dr. Cartmell, a lifelong Iricnd of
her family.. This child, a boy. grown
to manhood, is aft-used jf murder,
tried on circ umstantial evidence, amT
convicted. The trial judge, Inknown
to cither, is the convict's own lather.
This fct revealed, judge Kirby
a:iand'iiis his stern phiiosoimies and
tries to secure a pa i don for his son,
but in vain. The boy is electrocuted.
iir. Cartmell, who has always stood
against capital punishment, claiming
that electrocution did not kill, but
merely deadened sensibility, re.sus
ciates the lad.
With the decision of the state sti
prBte court, re-cognizing Thomas E.
Campbell as the defacto governor of
Arizona, there comes to the surface
'he various contentions regarding
bets made on the race before and af
ter the election. It is said that be
tween $10. Out) and $1.".000 are now
being held up in the Warren District
and many times .that amount in the
entire state.
Ca-rpbell bettors maintain that the
action of the supreme court should
J entitle them lo their money. They
1 dorian? the Yavapai county man has
been avvatdeil the governorship by
the highest tribunal iff the state; that
he hrs been declared elected by the
people of the state and that, there
fore, those who placed their money
on Hunt have no further recourse, so
far as the bets ar- concerned.
It is apparent that Hunt has not
been even the defacto governor since
Janutry 1. Of course he has occu
pied the executive offices and has rid
deu :n the state autoinohile but bis
authority has not been recognized by
any department. The legislature has
not received a message from him and .
the state officers, who are. responsi
ble for money and who are under
bond, have held up warrants until the
'pse was settled by the supreme court
Campbell now is undoubtedly gover
nor. That is enough, add the Camp
bell backers.
On the o'her hand, supporters of
Hunt maintain that they made their
bets on the man wiio was "rightfully"
elected to the office. They will not
acknowledge that Campbell has any
-ight to th office and hold that the
only decision on wbich their money
should be paid or won will be that
upon the contest proceedings, now
pending in the superior court of Mar
icopa county.
Court proce 'dings, in some instanc
es, may grow out of this betting, j
thought it is problematical whether
any court would receive or consider j
a civil action giowing out of the af
fair. It may be. however, that some
if the stakeholders, vhich in dude
imminent men, bankers, business peo
pie and others, may be subjected to
c.nsi'iei able criticism from both sides
'o the controversy and even may bo j
sued by some of, the Campbell back- I
urs for their money. j
In any even it will be interesting, j
especially in view of the attitude of j
eany of the Hum backets, as to what
th stakeni.ier wiil deeirV. For it
Sf-e::;s apparent that it is entirely up
:o the stakeholders as to whether he
':ha!l award to the Campbell backers
their money and that which they
eiaim to have won.

would be safer to stop, and Wripht

MEDIATOR'S WORK IS
TOUGH.JAYS WALSH
Star of Fox Feature "The Me
diator" Declares It Is
Hard Work,
"Being a mediator is strenuous
work," said George Walsh, after his
new picture for William Fox. "The
Mediator." which appears again today
at the Royal, was completed. "I'm
glad it's over with. I couldn't stand
being the character In real life that I
am in this picture. The life of the
ruffian for me every time, in prefer
trice to the joys of such a pacifist."
In explanation of his peculiar taste,
Walsh explained that being a media
tor amounted to being just the oppo
site in this pbotvpluy. The character
of Llsh Henley attain peace by fight
iiig everybody who is large enough to
cause trouble. When he has cowed
them all. he is satisfied that he'll have
peuce.
Special Diet Nec scary
"I had to adopt a special form of
diet for making this picture," said the
hero. "I wanted to keep In good form,
and I didn't want to impair my health.
The result was this. Breakfast, one,
soft boiled egg and milk, no bread;
lunch, clear soup and milk; dinner,
rare roast beef and milk, with a small
portion or ice cream. The result of
this diet was that all superfluous fat
was stripped from my body."
What the diet did not effect, exer
cise did. Mr. Walsh maintained a gym
nasium in his home, and he spent his
early mornings in tossing fifty-pound
pieces of iron atoout in a brbiling sun.
It was not sufficient for him to get up
at sunrise, and pass an hour beneath
the shelter of his roof; he had to take
his weights into the open,' where the
full heat of the California sun would
strike him.
Here' a New System
George Walsh once Originated a new
system of reducing, but he has never
been able to get anybody to try it.
He himself fought shy of the experi
ment. Briefly, the system was this:
Before each meal, exercise. After
each course, leave the table, and take
a short run around some convenient
track. If there Isn't a track handy,
go into your gymnasium and have a
good "w'ork out" with dumb bells,
clubs, or punching bag. Then, when
you are quite exhausted, go back to
the dining room and get the next
course. In this way, there is little
opportunity for flesh to accumulate,
digestion will be helped, and every
one will enjoy the best of health.
The only trouble with this system is
that it is purely theoretical. George
has not yet found anyone willing 'to
try it.

THOUSANDS PAID OUT
i IN BENEFITS DURING
1916 BYASS0CIATI0N
Annual Report of Employes'
Organization Shows That
Number of Tuberculosis
Cases Is Decreasing.
The report of the Employes' Benefit
association of the Copper Quocn Con
solidated Mining company for the year
1916, which has been submitted to
Grunt II. Dowell. chairman or the as
sociation, shows that during the past
year benefits totalling $7o,33C.lS were
paid 'out to members of the associa
tion. This amount is $26.S22.!u great
t-r than that paid out during 1915, the
increase being due mainly 10 the fact
that in 1 9 1 G the bilmb-r of deaths was
20, while ln191" onl five death ben
efit' were - paid. Sickness benefits
also showed an increase over the pre
vious year but accident benefits were
less than in 1915 by il541.li). The ex
penses of conducting the association
were also greater lu 1916 than in
1910.
A portion of the report for t tie past
year follows:
Deaths of Bisbee
"The deaths at Bisbee in 1915 were
14, involving an expenditure of $19,
606.25, against four in 1915 amount
ing to $5426.70, an increast of $14.
179.55. Five deaths from pneumonia
and two fatalities from automobile ac
cidents are the main causes for this
increase.
"At Douglas in 1916 there were six
("deaths with an expenditure of $6622.75
against one in 1915 for $1058.50, an in
crease tf $5564.25. The causes of
death there were various and must b?
considered as ordinary death liability
with ' which the association will al
ways have to contend. In one instance
at Douglas the liability was only $100,
decedent having been over 45 years ol
age at the time he joined the associa
tion. Accident Statement
"This statement is divided into ac
cidents on duty and accidents off duty
and the causes of the various acci
dents appear:
"Accidents on duty at Bisbee in
1916 were more in number by 25 and
in amount by $331.92 than in 1915. the
average amount per claim being $11.5t
in 1916 and $11.40 in 1915.
"Accidents off duty at Bisbee ir.
1916 were more in number by 24 but
less in amount by $2040.53 than in
1915. the reason for the decrease in
amount transpiring from one case ol
permanent disability occasioned bj
loss of leg in 1915, without a similar
case in 1916.
"The average amount per claim in
1916 for accidents off duty was $21.97
against $35.59 in 1915 (excluding per
manent injury claim in latter year).
"Rheumatics" Active
"At Douglas there was an increase
in accidents on duty of 15 in numbei
and of $282.45 in amount over 1915.
the average amount per claim being
$10.08 in 1916 and $8,067 in 915.
"Accidents off duty at Douglas were
more by one iu 1916. but less in
amount by $114.94 than in 1915, the
average amount per claim being $33. 5?
in 1916 against $44.94 in 1915."
In referring to sickness claims the
statement reads that "unlike 1915, in
which year the principal item of expen
diture for illness was caused by tu
berculosis, the main ailment in 1911'
was rheumatism, the number of such
cases exceeding those in 1915 by 49,
and in amount by $6082.72, whereas
there was a marked falling off in tu
berculosis in 1916, the number of case:
being is less ana amount paid re
duced by $4369.30, compared with
1915."

NOW PRESIDENT AND SECRETARY RESPECTIVELY
OF THE
STANDARD METALS COMPANY
Which is operating three properties in Arizona.
WISH TO ANNOUNCE THE PURCHASE OF THE FAMOUS
MOWRY MINES
By this Company
From now on wot k on the Mowry will proceed under the personal
supervision of
WILLIAM J. MITCHELL
The Chief Enfliieer and GetieraJ Superintendent of
STANDARD METALS COMPANY
Mr. Mitchell's successful record of eleven years with the American Smelt
ing and Refining Company or the Gugenheims. for seven years in charge of
their great silver and lead mines in the Santa Eulalia district of Mexico
runnine from two to three thousand men is too well known to question hU
ability in successfully operating these big Mowry Mines.
THE MOWRY MINES are in the Patagonia District or Santa Cruz
County. Arizona.
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT REPORTS ON THE MOWRY,
on Page 304 of Bulletin 582. U. S. Geological Survey as follows:
"The ore in general, it is said, averages about $40 per ton, but much of
it is very rich, especially the Galena ores, which carry about 68 per cent lead,
are variably argentiferous, with about 100 to 4000 ounces of silver to the ton
and contain about $1.00 gold and a trace of copper."
O nPage 302:
"The deposits are valuable for the lead and silver content. They occur
on the north or hanging wall side of the Mowry Fault, on the contact
tween the limestone and the quartz monzonite, primarily in a fairly continuous
6 to S foot ore body or tabular lode on vein which strike north 75 degrees
East and dips 78 degrees north."
On page 297:
"The vein is opened to a depth of 500 feet and Is developed bv about
12.000 feet of work, consisting principally of 2,500 feet of shafts. 6000 feet cf
drifts and crosscuts and 3000 feet of stopes. distributed mostly on 13 levels."
THE HISTORY OF THIS MINE AND ITS PRODUCTION. IS WONDER
FUL. AND YET LESS THAN TEN ACRES OF THIS RICH PROPERTY
HAS BEEN WORKED.
The entire estate consists of 420-acres or 21-patented claims. Each claim
'aid out along the presumed course of the veins and all showing heavy min
eralization. The town of Mowry is situated on the property right at the mines, and
's comprised of postoffice. school house, boarding houses, dwellings, smelter,
-(hops and everything pertaining to a large mining camp and is all owned
by the Company.
STANDARD METALS SHARES offer you a two-to-one
-hot, for. not only have you a chance to participate in the profits from the
silver and lead ores now ready for the mill. but.
LARGE BODIES OF COPPER
have been developed in the lowest workings of the 400-foot level, with Indi
cations of bigger bodies of copper below. Reliable engineers have made the
natement that they believe this famous mine will make a much more re
markable record as a copper producer than it ever has as a silver lead pro
ducer. By the former operators, the copper was left standing in the mine as
heir smelter equipment was for silver-lead reduction only.
IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE IS ABOUT 20,000 to 30,000 tofll Cf
ire blocked out in thi mine ready to be stoped and treated.
It is also estimated that there is from 50.000 to 75.000 tons of low grade
ore on the drimps. not rich enough to sOiifl.. but jdeal for .milling purposes.
fter being milled and treated in the Companv's'own plant it should net a
-roGt of from $4. to $6. per ton. - n ( .-rl
THE ORE ON THESE DUMPS ALONE SHOULD NET THE COMPANY
from $200,000.00 to $400,000.00.
-'? t
The Mill on the MOWRY was struck by lightning and burned down and
he present Company will have to build a new one at an expense of $30 0"'J
or more. ,
It is for the purpose of building this mill and for carrying on the exten
sive operations planned, that

AMERICANISM FOR THE WORLD.
If George Washington, who in his great Farewell Ad
dress warned his fellow-countrymen against foreign alii
anres, were living today, what would he do?
If Thomas Jefferson, who wrote the Declaration of
Independence, were alive today, what would he do?
If James Monroe, who shaped the famous doctrine
which for nearly a century has maintained inviolable
the liberties and territories of the nations of this hem is
phere, were alive today, what would he do?
If Abraham Lincoln, who presided over the greatest
war ever fought in the past for human freedom, were
alive today, what would he do?
If all these Fathers of the Republic could sit down
today with Woodrow Wilson or William H. Taft or any
other American who represents our typical American
aspirations and knows present foreign conditions, what
would that council decide?
Would not all these statesmen agree that the time has
come to abandon our traditional policy of isolation and
enter on a larger sphere?
Washington's advice was dictated . by caution. He
wanted the struggling young republic to play safe. Can
we not imagine him now counselling us that the time
has come when safety lies not in remaining aloof, and
therefore subject to altack by foreijn coalitions, bat in
joining a foreign coalition that will include so many
great powers that no attack will be possible.
Can we not imagine Jefferson, with his passion for
democracy, urging that we should now utse our influence
and power to make our free Ideals prevail everywhere?
Can we not imagine Monroe glowing with pride and
eagerness at the possibility of extending his policy to
cover the whole earth, insuring every nation, large or
small, against aggression?
Can we not imagine Lincoln, who freely risked so much
half a century ago to make one race free, willing to risk
something now in the time of our. prestige and power to
help make all races free to work out their own destiny?
And isn't it a noble vision revealed in the president's
address to the senate a vision of the American ideals
for which we have bled and struggled expanded to till
the whole earth a vision of a United States of the
World in which all men's possessions, persons and souls
shall be free?
It may be impractical, but who knows? All ideals
look impractical at first.
THE BUSINESS SITUATION.
There has been a storm lately on the stock exchange.
And it has cleared the air. Fictitious, speculative values
created by war orders and excited imaginations have
been blown away. There is nothing alarming about the
reoent drop in the price of numerous stock issues; they
have merely got down nearer a normal basis.
Some of them will have to drop further. But there is
no expectation of a panic on the approach of peace,
even if the war should end suddenly. The influence of
peace on American industry and commerce has already
been largely discounted. For many months the war or
ders have been lessening in volume. Their place has
been taken by other commodities supplied to the foreign
market, for which there is expected to be no lessened
demand when peace comes, and by the manufacture of
goods to satisfy the strong domestic demand.
Peace is regarded as now but a few months away.

experts, the public is now done with its speculative

taking chances.
It's an investment market now. And the financial
authority of the New York World says that the wisest

THE SAFETY FIRST PATROL.
The Philadelphia Rapid Transit Company has recently
enlisted school boys in its work of spreading "safety
first" information and habits among school children. A
"patrol" has been organized, with badges and pledges
and definite duties. The youngsters are to be respon
sible for themselves and their fellows. They will co
operate with the police in their effort to train pedestrians
in common sense and caution.
That's the way to make any movement really effective.
Get the people whciii it is to reach working at it for
themselves, and the thing grows. The best way to kceti
a boy from hopping street cars is to make him respon
sible for his "gang". He'll keep everybody else away
from this dangerous i:iblime, and he'll keep away him
self. The Philadelphia company began its "patrol" t.'irougli
self interest. But it was the enlightened sclf-inl crest

body's going to profit by this scheme, which will have a
direct and humane influence on the community as well
as decrease accidents for the company.

factors There is every prospect of another steel year
as busy and profitable as last year. That is regarded a3
promising at least one more year of our present boom
in nearly all lines of industry and trade.
THE TWO SALEMS.
Salem, Ore., has made a characteristically modest re
quest of Salem, Mass. The manager of the former city's
commercial club writes to the mayor of the Massachu
setts city as follows:
"Your town being of the same name, it naturally
draws from us, and we think it would be a good thing if
you would kindly take it up with your citizens and
change the name cf your town."
This communication might have been expected to give
the historic Massachusetts city a stroke of apoplexy.
Mayor Benson, however, makes this dignified re'.ort to
the upstart western rival:
"When your little community reaches a population of
50,000 or more and a valuation that will place you in
the same class with our small cities of the East; in
short, when voi r city 'has reached the size that your
manager's nerve and confidence have already reached,
we will advise ycu then to change the name of your
city; for there might be some confusion in having the
same name, and you would not ask the venerable mother
of all the Salems in the country to change her name at
the behest of even an enterprising and hustling name
sake." The eastern mayor seems to have a shade the better
of the argument. But Salem, Ore., may be given credit
for starting something new in the way of a imblicity
scheme which was probably the real purpose of the
proposal. Any community bearing a name rendered fa- ,
mous by some older community may step into the lime
light by making a similar demand.
Cairo, 111., may ask Cairo, Egypt, to get another name.
Rome, N. Y., may file a claim against Rome, Italy.
Atliens, O., (or Oa. or Tcnti), may challenge the risht
of the old Creek city to its title. I'aris, Ky., no doubt
can make a good case against the French capital.
Babylon, L. I., has an obvious grievance against the an
cient Kanyionian cuy. ahu :ew England ltselt, as a i
Boston paper happily suggests, may demand that old
England adopt a new name.

sions from $500 to JJ100. The judges I
of the superior courts in the counties I
come in l'or substantial raises also,
in order that they may combat the
high cost of living and kindred evils.
Yavapai, Maricopa, Pima, Gila and
Cochise judges now receive $1000 for
each twelve months of service, the
bill would raise this to $6000. in like I
manner wearers of judicial erni'ie in

Yuma, I'inal, Graham and Santa Cruz I
who get $5000 w'juld receive $5i'0u;
and Greenlee's judge who is in a class j

the stairs to the $5500 class. It is
noticeable that the reporter of deci

lently reduced to $500, whereupon the
distinguished holder of the position
hurriedly resigned and Miss Alice
Birdsell, one of Arizona's woman law
yers was- invited to do the work which
she did. It is not known if the pres
ent reporter of decisions is prepared
to die of fright because -of the pi
jected violent increase of the sa'.r.r.v
of $1900 per year, but it is conjectured
in official circles that the high cost ol
living has much to do with the propo
sition.

EXTRAVAGANCE.
The American people are admittedly extravagant. And
it's a fine thing to preach thrift. But it's hard to follow
Senator McCuniber all the way when he condemns us'
for spending $i:!,0(w,ooo.(mo a year for "tobacco, liquor,
automobiles and other amusements."
No doubt we might save billions on liquor and tobac
co, to our own physical and moral Knefit as well as thr:
beuefit -f our bank accounts. No doubl, loo, there's
much foolish extiavagatuc in automobiles. But the bulk
of the automobile business, even if we except f he in
valuable motor truck, would probably be set down by an
economist as useful and necessary rather than wasteful
and indulgent. For nearly every other item in the "ex

found. ,

Of the 12,000 men in Pershing's
command, 10,000 have "been concen-
rated at Colonia Dublan, for the
march north. Most of that number
have been there for many weeks, but
a large part arrived within the last
two days from El Valle, whi-h has
been the southernmost point of the
expeditionary force since the fight at
Carrizal. The plan is to march the
entire force out at the same time,
leaving no detachment far to the rear
as a bait for attacks from wandering
bands of rebels. '
The first step the army will make
after leaving Colonia Dublan will be
at Corralitos, fifteen miles to the
north, in the opinion of arniv officers

MAE MARSH IS STAR
IN OFFERING AT THE
LOWELL FOR TONIGHT
With Robert Harron, Famous
Little Film Star Flays in
"The Little Liar" at the
Central Theatre.
Mae Marsh and Robert liarron, two
film stars of reputation, appear to
night at the Lowell theater in "The
Little Liar," a Fine Arts production.
This is quite an original story which
delineates a character that is not en
tirely unknown." A little girl with an
abnormal imagination pictures herself
in strange situations and is not disin
clined or hesitant in telling about
them to her friends. Of course, no
one believes her and her persistence
in recounting ail those highly colored
tales only stamp her in the minds of
all as an invererale and incorrigible
liar.
Her delinquencies get her into a lot
of ti'juble from which she is rescued
through the good oilices of a reporter
v.ho really gets to know and, under
stand her. This story is replete with
many dramatic incidents and closes
with a big smashing climax.
HIGH SCHOOL ALUMNI
WILL PRESENT PLAY
Tiie Bisbee high school alumni will
put on a three-act comedy entitled.
'Green Stockings" in the high school
auditorium about the middle of Feb
uary. The date to be settled the early
part of next week.
Some of Bisbee's most prominent
young ladies and men, graduates of
the Bisbee high scho'jl, are working
hard, under the supervision of Prin
cipal E. Q. Enider, of the high school.
The proceeds from this play will go
to what is known as the alumni loan
fund. The money in this fund is
loaned to any boy or girl who is a
graduate of the Ilisbee high srhiAtl to
help defray his other expenses through
college, normal school, or a university,
which ever they might wish to attend.
After they have completed their
course, they are expected to pay the
amount back to the fund, at their con
venience, so that the money will be I
available for other students, wt.'j
might wish to make use of it for edu
cational purposes.
ANNOUNCEMENT
In order to accommodate the large
and rapidly increasing number of
r'ord owners in the Warren District,
we find it necessary to open an addi
tional Ford service sta'.ion and par
age in Johnson Addition. We expect
to fully maintain the "Ford Service"
reputation. Mr. Harry Jordan, who
has won public confidence as an ex
pert Ford mechanic, will be seconded
by such additional competent and hon
est assistants as may prove necessa
ry. With selected mechanics, devot
ing themselves exclusively to Fords,
we confidently expect to reduce Ford
npk.'ep to the minimum. Our old up
per Main Street place will continue
open, and Ford cam. parts am', acces
sories may be bought there as usual.
We are now able to deliver Fords
within twelve hours. There is no
guarantee against an advance in
price. Hood & Bledsoe. Salesroom
