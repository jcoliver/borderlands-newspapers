special Is scheduled to arrive
Wednesday morning.
PORTLAND, . Orew-SepL 15. Quot
4nr fmm nk address madfl la 1915 by!
o. T nAaL Atlrmnn nt the
DSnit. fnrpien 'relations . committee. ;
B,,o.rBtn? that nations must unite i
M W0D-v .- c?
as men unite to preserve peace.
President - Wilson told a Portland
audience tonight that the league of
Hna onvenant r.arried out what'
Mr. Lodge had suggested. It was the.
first time during his speaking tout
that Mr. Wilson had mentioned by
name any of the senators opposing
the league.
"I . entirely concur In Senator
Lodge's declaration," the president
said.
The president's words were greet
ed with laughter and cheers by an
audience which packed the municipal
auditorium, said to accomodate more
than 7000.
Asserting he had found few men
opposed to a league of nations, the
president said the great objection
seemed to be to this particular
league.
"I entirely concur In SenatoT
Lodge's declaration," said the presi
dent, "and I hope I shall have his co
operation in carrying out the desired
ends-j"
He recalled his conference with the
foreign relations committee on his
first return from Paris and said
every suggestion for improvement
made by the committee members had
been written Into the convenant.
One of these suggestions, he con
tinued, was that the Monroe Doc
trine be protected. He asserted that
not only had the doctrine been speci
fically resenred to administration by
the United States but It had been ex
tended to all the world.
Speaks at Afternoon Luncheon
PORTLAND. Ore.. Sept. 15. "If
America stays out of the league. of
nations it will do so , at a great
coBt to democracy and in violation
of its material as well as its moral
interests," President Wilson declar
ed In' an address here today.
Deploring the 4 suggestion he said
was being made on all sides that
the United States take advantage of
the world situation without should
ering nay of the responsibilities,
Mr. Wilson declared such a ; policy
would be futile, .because this coun
try as much as i any other was in
terested in guaranteeing a stable
world order.
During an all-day stop here, the
president Bpoke first at an after
noon luncheon, where his declara
tions were cheered repeatedly by
200 business and professional men
of Portland. He made only a brief
Impromptu talk, however, the only

the municipal auditorium. For this
meeting 7,000 tickets had been dis

officials said there were more than
30,000 applications for admittance.

AGAINST MEXICO
Witness Makes a Sensational
Accusation Before Senate
Sub-Committee; Says Infor
mation Came from Carranza
WASHINGTON, Sept. 15. State
ments issued by the League, of Free
nations association to counteract
what the organization has charged to
be a plot to force intervention in
Mexico, were largely. . based on infor
mation received" from George F.
Weeks, publisher of the Mexican Re
view, a Carranza organ; T. J. Debek
er today told the senate foreign re
lations sub-committee investigating
the Mexican situation. Debekker is
a member of the league's committee
on Mexico and previous witnesses had
testified he was author of most of the
literature sent out by the league for
publication. .,
Admission that he received his in
formation as to conditions in Mexico
from Weeks was made by Debekker
in the course of a sharp cross-examination
by Chairman Fall and Senator
Brandegee of the sub-committee. The
same cross-examination brought out
that Debekker based his charges of an
organized movement to force interven
tion "on newspaper renorts." but fur
ther questioning as to the newspaper
reports brought the statement that
none were at hand, but that he would
"subscribe to a clipping bureau' 'and
get the "evidence" aasired.
Debekker defended' - the Carranza
government in his testimony and said
that he believed Carranza was giving
Mexico a better government than the
United States could. - He also assert
ed that worse things had happened
in tho United States than had occur
red in Mexico. Later cross-examination
brought from him that outside of
Information gained Indirectly his only
knowledge of Mexican conditions was
obtained last spring during a six
weeks visit, four weeks of which
were spent In Mexico City and the
other two in traveling about the coun
try as the guest .of President Car
ranza and accompanied by Minister of
Finance Cabrera.
Members of the sub-committee and
the witness clashed time after time
during the hearing. At last Debekker,
raising his voice, declared: "I-believe
there is a plot against Mexico.
I believe that the president of the
United States knows who Is behind
that plot. No amount of questioning
can shake my position on that point."

Expert Testimony on Wound
Dr. F. J. Reese of the C. & A. dis
pensary was called as a expert wit
ness and testified that he had dressed
Moon's finger on the morning of the
7th of September at the dispensary;
that the wound on the finger was a
small transverse cut near the base of
the finger on the back. The doctor
estimated that a wound of that kind

bleed two ounce sat the most, and
In his opinion, the wound when first
seen by him had been inflicted from
eight to ten hours previous by some
instrument with a sharp edge. He fur
ther testified that th cut was smaller
than the piece of skin found on the
door of the safe.
Dr. Bledsoe of the C. & A. dlsppn

he had examined the accused's finger
on the day following at the request of

fitted exactly with the skin that was

taken by the new commissioners due
to! the fact that - Mr. Ryan was fam

m The tremendous growth of the oil and asphalt industry of California was due
in a measure to The Paraffine Companies, Inc. . ;
" How? ..' ; . . . .. .'. :
Black Paraffin
In the early daysoil experts from, the Pennsylvania fields, thought that the
black viscous residue left after the lighter oils had been distilled from California
petroleum was black paraffine? Bui; it was not like the paraffine they knew, and
they considered it worthless. , i ' . r '
For a long time the oil industry was handicapped by the large quantity of this
black residue. ' . '. " .
PABC&7
Its Great Value Discovered
Then came Beardsley, an Eastern oil ex
pert, and Pierce, a chemist, who resolved to
find a use for it. They experimented cease
lessly without result, until one day by acci
dent they discovered that this "black paraf
fine" would dissolve readily in that evil
smelling liquid known as carbon bisulphide.
Their search was at an end. They had mad
a paint which dried quickly and withstood
the action of acids and alkalis.
As a result of this discovery The Paraffin
Paint Company was formed to manufacture
the now famous "P & B paints and a small
plant was established in Oakland in 1884.

THE KENYON BILL
J
QUITE a number of Texas cattlemen have appeared recently
before a congressional committee which !s holding hearings
on the Kenyon bill providing for the licensing of persons
or firms engaged in slaughtering livestock, preparing live
stock products for market, marketing livestock products, conducting
or operating stockyards or livestock commission enterprises, collect
ing or distributing livestock quotations or market news and buying,
selling and shipping dairy products, poultry or poultry products in
excess of 500,000 a year. The bill aims at bringing the big packers
under government control very much as the railroads are under gov
ernment control, and Texas cattlemen are against It.
There has been a tendency of some members of the committee
to call the stockmen tools of the packers. The Texans, however, in
sist they are speaking for their own interests. They do not want
to see big industries which provide' a market for what they raise pass
under the control of the government because they believe it will
mean inefficiency, waste, loss to themselves and higher, meat prices
for the consumers. They believe that, under careless subordinates
of the government, the meat industry would be mishandled. They
consider that the Kenyon bill strikes at tha constitutional right of a
man to engage in two business at the same time, demands the sale
of millions of dollars worth of stockyards and refrigerator cars with
out providing a market and offers absolutely no guarantee of a rt
duction of meat prices.
Small packing plants, doing less than 500,000 a year could ob
serve without great grief the placing of government control , over
their "bog competitors. But the public is certainly going to be ap
prehensive of anything that suggests railroad, postoffice or tele
graph inefficiency and it is already afraid that is what this Kenyon
licensing system would amount to. El Paso Herald.
AMERICANISM OF THE RAILROAD MEN
APPARENTLY the six railroad shop crafts are accepting In
good faith the advice of their national officers in rescind
ing the strike vote. In Kansas City, as in many other
cities, the men, without waiting for the count of the na
tional vote, had walked out in protest against delay in wage In
creases. Their conservative leaders' and members had the more
difficult task, of getting "a , back to work vote" rather than the
easier task of getting an affirmative vote on staying with the job.
That the men returned to work from gatherings where it was
possible to air their grievances and receive encouragement, speaks
well for the patriotic national spirit of leaders and members. There
was not lacking argument from the radicals in the organizations to
refuse the President's proposal and to kick the table over. The
situation seemed favorable for their propaganda. The men were idle,
discontented and might have been expected to listen eagerly to the
pleas to make a stand and force a large wage increase.
But good sense and Americanism prevailed. The men determined
to grant the ninety-day respite asked for by the Railroad Adminis
tration in order to see what could be done toward reducing the cost
of living. Their action is a blow to the Bolshevists, the I. W. W.,
and other radicals who have been urging industrial war without re
gard to its effect on the country.
It is evidence that Americans, even under strain will keep their
heads and . will subordiuate what may seem the prospect of immedi
ate personal gain to the general welfare of the Nation.
KEEPING UP EXPENSES
IN GENERAL the high cost of living is beyond the power of Con-,
gress to deal with. But there is one feature of the situation
in which the country expects relief from Washington that is
in the matter of government extravagance.
The new Congress has made some sweeping economics. But as
Representative Thompson of Ohio remarked: "As fast as Congress
endeavors to apply the brakes the bureaus of the administration de
vise ways and means to create deficiencies."
That, is human nature. The war created a large number of new
bureaus in Washington. Now each one is actively engaged in stav
ing off dissolution and proving itself essential. The situation was
aggravated by the President's veto last year of Representative Bor
land's bill extending the working day of Washington clerks from
seven to eight hours. Meanwhile the country contributes the taxes
to pay the bills.
The situation is one that can be remedied only when Congress
goes after it with an ax.
Boston having been mobbed and looted, it would appear that
there are lowbrows as well as highbrows in that rendezvous for
culture. .
i.
The Peace Treaty, the President predicts, will lower prices.
But we wouldn't advise anybody to put off buying his fall suit
trusting to that
Rumania refuses to sign the peace treaty with Austria. Since
the war closed Rumania has been acting very much like the old
time Kaisas politician who demanded an increase in the bribe that
had been paid him by the railroads for his vote upon a measure in
the legislature. "You go back and tell the railroads," the old poli
tician said, "that I am acting damn queer."
The report on the treaty by the committee on foreign relations
may, perhaps, recall to our distinguished traveler that the Constitu
tion does not say something about "the advice and consent of the
Senate" in the negotiation of treaties.
Maybe the telephone company believes that if it lowers its rates
persons will do more talking. Such a result would not be surprising.
We're not so badly off, after all. They are searching the homes
of everybody for hidden wealth in Germany now.

If all the WEALTH in the United States had been divided equally just before the war, there would have been $34 per
person. If all the wealth in the nation were divided equally TODAY, there would be $54.64 per person. So extraordinary
an INCREASE in NATIONAL WEALTH in so short a time has brought about an era of high prices unprecedented
which is likely fo continue for YEARS! Stiffen your FIRE PROTECTION ACCORDINGLY! ' '
Fire losses in the United States in 1917 were the largest i n the'history of the country.
The number of fires that occurred LAST YEAR far exceeded 11 7the lbssfes having jdmped from $2.42 per capita"
to $2.76, according to the perfectly reliable figures supplied by the Annual Report of The National ' Board of Fire Under
writers. '
There are 1440 MINUTES in 24 HOURS and in these United States there are more than -FIFTEEN HUNDRED
FIRES every 1440 MINUTES.
547.000 FIRES occurred in this country last year. The loss in MONEY amounted to $290,959,885! FORTY MIL-
J. IONS MORE than the losses in 1917!
If all the FIRES which are recorded for 1918 were ON ONE LONG THOROUGHFARE, there would have been a
conflagration INCLUDING the TWO SIDES of a street REACHING ALL THE WAY FROM NEW YORK to CHI-,
CAGO! , . x .

GERMAN SUBMARINE TESTER ARRIVES IN 'ENGLISH rPRT
An ingeniously designed and constructed vessel in 'tne form of
German submarine" tester was brought to Harwich, England, recently.
Owing "to the shallowness of the waters around their coast, the Huns
could not test the submarines at sea. Hence the- construction by them of
the testing dock. In this tester the submariners towed into the cylinder.
It settles on blocks in the cylinder and is then shoved up, and when in
position, air pressure corresponding to the required depth of the test, say
two hundred. fe.rt, is placed on the hull of the sub. Men then descended
into the submarine through a connecting tube, and caulk any apparent !
leaks, while the pressure is on, and when that is completed the submarine
is tested and if satisfactory, ready for sea. . The tester ia so designed so '
as to receive three submarines at one time, one for tettinor and twr. I

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, Sept 15. Stocks mov
ed to materially higher levels in the
early period of today's broad dealings,
on reports that the labor unions had
rendered their steel strike order, hut
part of ths gain was lost later when
these reports met with denials.
Another development that served to
check the advance was the further
slump of exchange rates to France
and Italy, both falling to lowest quo
tations ever recorded in this market
with German bills.
Otherwise the trend ol advices over
the week end was of a character cal
culated to sustain the substantial up
ward progress made in we final days
of the preceding week.
Although trading encompassed
many different issues including rails,
interest gradually concentrated Jn
steel equipments, motors, oils, tobac
cos and food shares, oils and tobaccos

close . when the tendency elsewhere
was toward moderate, reactions. Sales
1.150,000 shares.
The bond market reflected further
uncertain tendencies, 1 chiefly due to
heaviness of utilities and several of
the leading rails; this being balanced.
of internationals. Sales, par value,
$12,650,000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged on call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, Sept. 15. Signs that for

The day was almost half over hota
bullish influences had any noticeable
effect on corn. Notwithstanding re
ports that the steel strike had been

A fire occurred at the home
Charley Brandi, a miner em
ployed at the Johnson mine,
Highroad, School hill, last ev
ening at 11 o'clock. A $1,000
loss to the. building' and con
tents is estimated. There was
no insurance.'.!
The fire started from defec
tive electric wiring which caus
ed a short circuit and the roof
became ignite! and smoldered
for come time before bursting
into flames. The fact that the
house was unoccupied, all of the
occupants being away at . the
time and thati no flames showed
for many minutes, caused the
fire to gain considerable head
way before being discovered by
the residents of the adjoining
houses.
The alarm was turned in from
Box 31 end both fire engine
crews answered the summons.'
Owing to the remote place
where the residence is situated
and the difficulties encountered
in getting the, engines to the
nearest point, owing to the nar
row, 6teep roads on School hill,
the fire department did excep
tionally, good vork in putting
out the fl-mes before the house
was completely devoured by the
flames.
Mr. Br?ndi, the owner of the
house and its contents, stated
that no insurance was carried
and th?.t the loss would be a
comparatively , heavy one for
him.
I. W. W. BENTLEY, W. B., IS VAGGED;
MOTIVE OF MEN FURNISHING BOND
FOR "REDS" CAUSE OF CONJECTURE
Charles H. Bentley, the notorious
witness in the deparranon suits re
cently held. at Douglas, an I. W. W. of
the reddest hue, a wife beate'r and the
man who has put up money to help
"fellow worker" I. W. W.'s out of the
local jail, when convicted of vagrancy
last week, is himself in fbe toils on
the same charge. He was arrested yes
terday afternoon by the local police
on the charge of vagrancy.
The complaint has been issued for
several days, but Bentley, having
heard of it beat a hasry retreat to a
safer place, and not until yesterday
has he put In an appearance within
the jurisdiction of the local authori
ties. "When he was arrested yesterday
his bond was set at 100, which Wil
liam Powers of Brewery Gulch, a part
ner of Jess Ruth, furnished.
The latter two men have been un
usually prompt the last week since
the police drive against vagrants and
J. W. W.'s by furnihing bail money for
several of their friends who have been
arrested. Just why these men, who
derive their livelihood from ' conduct
ing a cigar stand in town, and who
share with other business men the
protection afforded them by the' local
authorities in keeping the town free
from undesirables, should rush Into
?ourt with cash bonds Is a matter of
conjecture to .the local police and
others. '
I. W. W. Bentley will be remember
ed by scores of citizens as the man
who come into prominence by his tes
timony in the Douglas. trials and. dur
ing these trials evidently decided he
would apply some I. W. W. principals
of violence to his wife and proceeded
to administer a severe beating, after
which he was hailed into court.
As a result his wife secured a di
vorce on the grounds of non-support
and cruelty.
I. W.. W. Bentley, V. B. (Wife
Beater), will be arraigned' before
Judge Hogan's court tomorrow morn
ing at 10 o'clock.

To the Stockholders of
' . ,.. I - El Paso, Texas,
, ! September 13, 1919'.
El Paso Ranger Oil Company
The Trustees have had to perform the sad duty of electing a successor to
their beloved president, Robert Krakauer. .
R. A. (Gus) Morris has been elected to fill the vacancy. It is not neces
sary to introduce Mr. Morris to our Stockholders, because he is well known for his
ability, rugged stability and honesty, in addition' .to his wide and very successful
experience in the Ranger Oil fields. Mr. Morris will prove a valuable asset to
the Company. ' i ' ' j ,
Our well on the Watson,; ract, known as the. Watson No. 1, has started drill
ing. . J . .
Out Baggett tract is today in the center 'of the greatest activity around the
Sammies well, which is doing about 500 barrels of oil from the extremely shallow
and inexpensive depth of 1,725 feet. Leases cannot be bought anywhere -around
usfat $1000.00 per acre. ,,,:' ,'
While is was difficult sixty days ago to get a drilling contract on a very fa
vorable basis, we are now being offered drilling contracts, and it is quite likely that
the Trustees will, in the next few days, be able to announce the starting of a sec
ond well which will be drilled on the Baggett tract, where we feel sure of getting
oil at the shallow depth around 1,800 feet, and where we also are confident of
the big pay at the deeper level. '.
Our present program will exhaust very little of the Company's funds, which
are ample, in addition to the 41,000 shares of stock still held in the treasury.
Your Trustees will push development as rapidly as possible, and advise you fre
quently as to progress. . 1
