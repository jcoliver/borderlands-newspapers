President Urges Mobilization
. of Nation's Gold Reserve
Under the Direction of the
Federal Reserve Board.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
- WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. President
Wilson tonight sounded a call for the
mobilization of all the nation's gold
reserves under the supervision of the
federal reserve board.
In a statement made public through
tbe board, the president called upoa
ail eligible non-member stale banks
and tiust companies to join the fed
erai reserve system without further
delay that they may "contribu:e their
share" to the consolidated gold re
serves of the country and aid more
effectively in "a vigorous prosecution
end successful termination of the
war."
Many Join t System.
Scores of such institutions have
flocked to the system within the past
three weeks, among them some of
the largest trust companies in New
Ycrk, Philadelphia and other cities.
The movement to the federal reserve
system has lacked only a final im
pelling force to assum9- tbe propor
tions of a landslide. Within less
than three weeks, resources of such
institutions in the syBtem have risen
from $1,200,000,000 to . more than
t2.oo,OW,000.
Move Is Imperative.
Liberty Loan financing, the result
ant activity in money markets, the
effects of the government's buge fi
nancial operations upon the bond
market and the s.ock exchanges of
the country have made it imperative,
in the view of the administration, for
the federal reserve to control not a
major fraction of the gold reserve f
the country, but. the entire amount.
Tbe. recent embargo oa gold exports
l:as made it highly desirable that this
control be acquire as speedily" as pos
sible. With the board active, daily control
of the country's huge store of gold,
at. present more than 3,000.000.000,
watching every avenue through which
ii may be lessened and vigilant in its
supervision of the country's banking
activities, officials believe that Vie fi
nancial position of the country may be
rendered as neat ly impregnable as hu
man skill can make it.
Control One-Half.
At present the board controls the
activities of institutions representing
only one-half of the country's total
banking reservoirs. The latest report
of the comptroller of the currency
places at several millions above $16,
000,000 000 the resources of the banks
within the system. Since that report
was issued, however, .nearly $1,500,
000,000 in resources have been added
through the acquition of new mem
bers. There are, however, between 8000
and 9000 eligible banks and trust com
panies with resources es.'imaed at
lrom $12,000,000,000 to $16 000,000,000,
whose resources aie entirely beyond
the control of the federal government,
being governed only bv state law!.
The president adtiressed himself to
these institutions.
His oiatement sayv
President's Statement.
"It is manifestly imperative that
tl ere shculd be a complete mobiltza
ticn of the banking reserves of th
United Stales. All who are familiar
v.' th financial operations must appra
iate the importance of developing to
the maximum our bunking power and
of providing financial machinery ade
quate for meeting the very great fi
nancial requirements placed upon our
country by reason of the war.
"A vigorous prosecution and satis
factory termination of the war will
depend in no small degree upon ability
of the government not only to finance
itself, but also to aid the governments
associated with It In the war, which
must be kept supplied with munitions,
fuel and supplies of ail kinds.

one which concerns all banks alike.

Sheriff's Posse Searches Hills
For Bandits Who Rob Mail Train
SALT LAKE CITY. Utah, Oct. 15. A sheriffs posse is on the trail of
bandits who at 3:30 o'clock this morning held up a Deep Creek railroad
train, enroute from Salt Lake to Gold Hill, Nevada, robbed the pas
sengers and wounded Charles Barber of this city who attempted re
sistence. According to word received by Postmaster Noble Warruni, the
robbers jumped on the train 19 miles south of Wendover, near the Utah
Nevada boundary. They ransacked the mail pouches and then robbed
the passengers of hundreds of dollars worth of jewelry and a considerable
quantity of cash.
It is believed that the bandits escaped in automobiles.
A special train left for the scene at noon with postoffice inspectors
aboard. This train will return to Salt Lake City with Barber and any
other persons who may have been shot by the bandits.
The train boarded by the robbers left Salt Lake City over the West
ern Pacific railroad to Wendover yesterday. At Wendover the train
travelled over the Deep Creek railroad toward Gold Hill and it was be
tween these two points that the robbery occurred. There were four
bandits, all armed and masked.

GLOBE, Oct. 15. At the conclusion
of a day spent in conference with the
niine operators of the Globe-Miami
district, members of the federal in
dustrial commission, headed by Secre-!
tary of Labor Wilson, said that no
agreement had been reached as to a
settlement that tied up the copper in

were held behind closed doors but it
is understood that the details of the
proposals made by the strikers that
the men be allowed to return to work

In tbe hands of the commission was
gone into in detail.
No settlement has been made by the
mine operators but it appears certain
that they will not consent to any
compromise which would require them
to re-employ a certain element of the
strikers.
Conferences with the mine opera

until such a time as an agreement is

WASHINGTON, Oct. 15. Railroads
of the west are expected by officials
nere t0 follow tl,e eastern roads in
I asking the interstate commerce com
mission fo consider their granting in
creased freight rates on a large num
ber of commodities or even to seek a
general advance in all rate
Indications are that executives of
western roads will await the outcome
of the conference to be held here Wed-
nesday between the eastenr executives
and tbe commission before making a
move. Officials have received inti
mations within the Inst 4S hours that
the action was under consideration.
Fall Below Record.
Within the last two months the
western road's have fallen below their
banner figures of a year ago. Gross
receipts have, been much higher but
operating expenses have outstripped
the increases.
Southern roads, whose net revenues
have been rising as those of eastern
and western roads fell, have taken no
step looking toward another applica
tion, so far as officials here know, but
its is considered likely that they will
join tbe others.
Wait Wednesday Conference.
At Wednesday's conference, a tenta
tive, informal proposal is expected
from the executives of eastern roads.
It so happens that this conference
will be held at a time when many rail
road commissioners win be in the city
and officials regarded it as very cer
tain that representatives of the state
commissioners will attend the meet
ing to protest against any 'general ad
vance in rates.

CHICAGO SOX
WIN WORLD'S
TITLE IN THE
SIXTH GAME
Deciding Contest is Won By
the Champions of the Amer
ican League.' New York's
Errors Contributing Factors.
(By Review teased Wire
NEW YORK. Oct 15. Coming out
of the west like Lochinvar of old, the
Chicago Americans won ihe world ser
ies baseball championship here this
afternoon, defeating the New York Na
tionals 4 to 2 in the sixth and deciding
game of the 1917 diamond classic. hxr
the first time in almost a decade the
titular banner will flu:ter over the fans
in the middle west metropolis next
spring when the series pennant Is rais
ed at Comiskey Park, as evidence of
the superiority .of the White Sox in
the great national game.
Af.er winning the first two games
on their home field and losing the next
two at the Polo grounds, the Chicago
clan clinched the gonfalon with two
straight victories, one at Comiskey
park and the other at the lair of the
Giants. The New York club did not
go to defeat today without desperate
resistance. The battle was surcharg
ed with sensational situations and
thrilling plays, but the invading com
bination with the edge of a one-game
lead was cot to be denied. It was
the Giants who eventually brokeiunder
the strain of the conflict.
Fatal Fourth.
With "Rube" Benton, the towering
southpaw from Clinton, N. C, waging
a pitching duel for the locals against
the curves of Urban Faber. thJ Ca
cade. Icwa. hurler "of the White Sox,
the battle was fought through three
full innings without either team giving
the slightest marging either defensive
ly or offensively. In the "fatal fourth"
however, the Giants faltered for just a
moment and seizing their advantage
the players of Chicago rushed the
breach and captured the first world's
series championship emblem won in
the city on Lake Michigan since Frank
Chance's "Cubs" defeated Detroit in
1908. While the Nationals made a
game rally in the fifth and the Sox add
ed another run In the ninth the three
runs scored by the Chicago team in
the fourth session were the deciding
factor. The play in this inning con
vinced the thirty-odd thousand specta
tors present that for this season at
least the pennant winning club of the
American league is better than that
which won the race in the senior or
ganization. Championship Decided.
That the championship had been de
cided in the fourth Inning was in keep
ing wjth the feature and factor play
throughout the series. The Chicago
club scored its winning run in this in
ning during the firjt game and collect
ed five in the second contest in tbe
same period. In the third and fourth
contests, won by the Giants, the win
ning team scored the only runs of the
battle in fourth inning of the third
game and the first of the five runs in
the fourth game which was a five-to-nothing
shutout in favor of New York.
The scoring of Saturday proved an ex
ception, but today the Sox reverted to
their original system, and aided by
misplays by the Giants closed the ser
ies with a decisive victory.
Big Attendance.
The largest assemblage of specta
tors to witness any game of the pres
ent inter-league combat was on hand
when the rival clubs grappled. Accord
ing to the official figures, 33,969 per
sons paid admission to the Polo
grounds, their contributions totalling
$73,634. Of this sum the stockholders
of the two clubs will each receive $33.
006.06 and the national commission $7.
334.80. The players ceased to partici
pate in the gate receipts after the
fourth game but they will receive $152,
888.58 as their share, this amount be
ing divided sixty per cent to the Chi
cago team and forty per cent to the;
New York players. The COtafrreceipts
for the six games amounted to $425,
878 and after subtracting the money
paid to the players, the two clubs are
each richer by $115,200.81 and the na
tional commission $42,587.70.
Day A Wonder.
As was befitting the climax of the
baseball year, the day was the best of
those on which games , were played.
Under these favorable conditions
thousands Of fans entered into the
spirit of the play with more American
baseball enthusiasm than was the case
in almost any of the preceding con
tests. As was natural, they rooted

trator Garfield abnounced tonight and
the supply is ample to meet immediate
needs even in the middle west, where
an acute condition arose through fail
ure, he said, of cities to specifically

Dr. Garfield, who has just returned

night by F. W. Ludkins, president of
the Southwestern Coal Operators as-
! sociation, asking that John P. White,
president of the United Mine Work
ers of America, intervene in the strike i
called today by the three district mine
workers' presidents for next Friday
morning in the southwestern district.
A message was -also sent to President
Wilson urging that he enforce the na
tional contract signed in Washington
several months ago.
The strike of the 35.000 coal miners
in the southwestern field, consisting
of Missouri. Kansas. Oklahoma and
Arkansas, was called this morning.
The point of contention between the
miners and operators is the fine sys
tem, which would penalize which ever
side caused an unnecessary strike. At
last week's conference between the
district presidents of the mine work
ers and the coal operators, every other
demand asked for by the miners was

President Woodfow Wilson in a re

cial and civic organizations of Ameri
ca would be a direct service to the
winning of the war. In Bisbee this
appliss directly to the Warren Dis
trict Commercial Club.
Experiences at the camps already
established has clearly shown the vital
necessity, for wholesome environment
for healthy social contact in the ad
joining communities. This contact
during the next few months Is going
to be the determining influence In
making the spirit of the new Ameri
can army." To the soldiers it will re
flect the attitudJ of the entire nation
toward them.
The novelty of camp life wears, off
quickly. The routine of drill and in
struction soon palls unless there is re
laxation and a chaiie of scene in the
communities nearby. It palls on these
men who are going to fight our bat
tles exactly as it would on you it you
were in their place.
The plan to eliminate this condition
Is to furnish the enlisted men hospi
tality in social circles, trj promote
wholesome .amusement in public
places and to provide for their enter
tainment in general, thereby prevent
ing the exploitation of the boys by
commercialized attractions of an un
desirable sort.
To carry on, this work successfully
Jn communities a nation-wide cam
paign is to be started at once for the

OLGA PETROVA AT
ORPHEUM IN STORY
OF EGYPTIAN LOVE
i
Madame Olga Petrova. the cele
brated Russian actress of international
fame, who recently signed a long term
contract with the Jesse L. Lasky Fea
ture Play company to star exclusively
in Paramount pictures, makes her
first appearance under the new con
tract in the Lasky-Paramuont picture,
"The Undying Flame." This picture
is a startling combination of the. an
cient and modern a story of Egypt
and the Sphinxes, with the luring,
withing mystery of that fascinatnig
country in present day times as well
as centuries ago. . As a child of an
cient Egypt. Mme. Petrova is glor
iously beautiful in her pagan jewelry,
sandals and queer filmy garments, and
it is easy to imagine her as a Pharaoh's
daughter, wandering about the palaces
on the banks of the Nile. "The Un
dying Flame" is a thrilling 4ale of
world-old love and sacrifice, and the
romance of an Egyptian princess and
her humble shepherd lover separated
by fate but reunited centuries later in
what is known in Egypt as "reincar
nated form." Mme. Petrova has won
a world-wide reputation for her ver
satility and for her powerful emotional
acting she has an unparalleled op
portunity for displaying her remark
able talents in this production.

Predicts Failure
of Chancellor in
Prerent Crisis
(By Review Leased Wire.)
COPENHAGEN, Oct. 15. It is be
lieved that' the political situation
which has arisen because of discon
tent in some quarters with Dr. Mich
aelis, the imperial German chancellor,
will reach a crisis before the reich
stag reassembles in December. Dr.
Michaelis remains in Berlin, conferr
ing with reichstag leaders and his per
sonal adviser, endeavoring to find a
solution of the situation, but accord
ing to advices received here , he does
not seem to realize that his own posi
tion is endangered. The political
leaders and the newspapers continue
office he holds. They point out his
failure to develope any positive pra
gram or to exercise any effectual
leadership. On the contrary, they say
he has permitted himself to be buf-
fetted hither and thither, now by the!
pan-Germans and now by the reich
stag majority, which have wrested
from him one grudging concession
after another.
The chancellor's biggest blunder, in
the yees of the moderate press, was
his rehibilitation of the independent
socialists by his disclosures concern
ing the mutiny on German warships,
thereby driving the socialists into op
position which many persons believer
will unite the two socialists wings in
to a powerful radical opposition. Even
the pan-Germans say that unless Dr.
Michaelis is able to rule the situation
with a stronger hand he had better
resign.

James Girand, City Engineer
of Phoenix, is Raising Con
tingent to Supervise and

cal experience in road building as
section bosses, engineers, overseers
or contractors, or men who have hud
experience in plants manufacturing
material for road building. No day

Although men who have had expe
rience in road building are of draft

The age limit for 'the regiment is 40

Cochise county's Child Welfare
board, organized under the provisions
of a statute, enacted at the last ses
sion of the legislature, to take the place
In a measure, of the unconstitutional
mothers' pension bill, was held yes
terday in Tombstone. Judge A. C.
Lockwood, who named the members of
the board, spoke on the duties of those
who comprise the the organization
and of the law In general.
In attendance at the meeting were:
Miss Klsie Toles and Mrs. Nellie
Dalgliesh. Tombstone; Dr. V. A.
Greene, superintendent of the county
hospital at Douglas; Dr. C. H. Hunt,
county phyisican, Bisbee; S. F.
Fraser, and Mrs. J. H. Hirst, Douglas,
and Miss Esther Cummings, Bisbee.
S. F. Fraser was elected chairman of
the board and A. C. Karger, who Is an
ex-officio member under the law, will
act as secretary.
Under the law creating the board, a
decided step in the direction of taking
care of needy widows and dependent
children is taken. Its provisions, how
ever, will leave a large number of de
pendent women and children without
reconrse to the county.
In order for a widow to take ad
vantage of the law, she must be a
resident of the state of Arizona and
an American citizen. Her husband
must have died and he must also have
been an American citizen. These two
provisions will eliminate about three
fourths of the cases, according1 to
one member of the new board, already
existant in Cochise county.
Meetings of the board will be held
once every month on the Saturday be
fore the first monthly meeting of the
board of supervisors. This date was
selected because tho supervisors,
when recommendations are made to
It by the board, issue the warrants
for the necessary money and affirm
the aation taken by the board.
A LOCAL DEFEAT

ON THE GRIDIRON
C & A. Falls Before the Old
"First Arizona" Whilejhe
High School DefeatsIn-dians.
The widely advertised C. and A.
'ootball team has fallen down on their
publicity agent miserably. In their
first two "outs" of the season they
:irve tasted defeat indeed, the sec
defeat might well be classed a
"rout." The First Ari;rna walked
up one side of them and down the
other in Sunday's game at Naco, the
final score being IS to 0.
High School Wins.
And then, to add insult to injury,
the Bisbee high school Saturday took
the Indians from Company F into
camp to the tune of 6 to 3. The In
dians, be it remembered, scored a
victory over the C. and A. eleven a
Veek ago.
In Die high school-Indian t game,
Russell Thomas and Coach Lauren
son were the particularly bright stars.
It was the latter's long forward pass
to the former that made the high
school's touchdown. The Bisbee
youths played a fast, clean game, and
6howed the result of good coaching.
Alas!
To go back to the C. and A. team!
Considering all things, they really
made a creditable showing this season.
It is hard to play football unless the
players on a team are in strict train
ing and are able to put in long hours
of daily practice. But Manager Cal
lagher talked, up until a few weeks
back, of Harvard and Pittsburg and
the C. and A.'s in the same breath.

BIG MEETING TODAY
An urgent call has been made for
the attendance of members of the Bis

Red Crosg society, which will be held
today at 3 o'clock at the Y. M. C. A.
The chief business to be transacted
will be the selection of an executive
committee, the guiding committee of
the chapter.
During the meeting plans for the
coming work of the chapter will also
be discussed. The Red Cross through
out the country Is coming more Into

branches are finding the work grow
Ine rather than declining.
The present officers are very. anxi
ous that a big meeting be held this
afternoon and every member of the

present.

her sons who star in college athletics
in the east, scant attention is paid

bitterness of the pill is the fact thai
these same eastern "prep" organiza
Uons are composed largely or west
erners or men developed in the west.
Two Examples. ,
It wasn't so very long ago that a.
famous Yale quarterback was listed
by the registrar in that wonderful
old college as being a New Mexican
by birth and residence, and as lata
as 1915 the captain of the greatest
gridiron machine in the whole country
Pittsburgh had v three years pre
viously captained the mythical "Ail
Southwestern." This man, "Chalky"
Williamson, led the New Mexico Mili
tary institute eleven to the Arizona
New Mexico championship in 1913 and
coaches of the big teams in both states
were unanimous In their choice of this
man for the honor football position
in the southwestern pigskin history
that season.
"Prep" Teams Strong.
But to return to the secondary
schools. ' While the war has disrupted
the football machines o( the colleges
this year, the machines of the "preps"
have remained virtually Intact: due,
of course, to, the youth of their per
sonnel. From the first scores which
have been received it is obvious that
these secondary school elevens are
stronger than the most of the college
teams. I' figures and "dope" may be
combined to form a criterion, then
the greatest football team not only
in the east, but In the entire country,
is the eleven representing Pomfret
school a Connecticut institution.
Captained by Westerner.
Although the Pomret captain is a
Michigander by birth and a New York
er by residence, the west claims him
as "her own." He is a youngstei
named William Schuette, and a ten
years ago he breezed into the Fecos
valley, over in New Mexico, wearing
London cut clothes and eating choco
lates and saying "rawther" for
"rather." However, working on Irvin
Cobb's advice: "When in Rome be
a Roman candle," Schuette packed
away the "TailoTed at Fashion Parks,"
substituted "Army and Navy plug
cut" for Huyler's '."Specials" called
an "a" and "a" and not "Ah-h,"
and promptly proceeded to forget
Broadway.
It is of Interest to note that all this
time, however, he played no football.
He boxed continually and organized
an amateur baseball team which
swept all opposition in New Mexico
and Arizona before it; but his grid
Iron prowess was at that time un
known. In Bisbee.
In the fall of 1914 Schuette came
to Bisbee. a husky and healthy young
brute, determined to try his hand at
mining. ' About this time, however,
his family decided to visit their young
hopeful and they came here to see.
him. Although no one knows just
what scene was enacted, the boy left
the district with his mother and fa
ther for the east. When the party
of three reached New York, his mother
had William's nails manicured and his
face massaged, put a maternal ban
on the west and on mining and threw
her son into a preparatory school with
the Injunction to abesrb a little Greek
and to foregt his crude western ways.
At Pomfret.
AH of which brings Schuette to
Pomfret. He started playing football
immediately and his second year he
made the- team. Playing with dash,
nerve and brilliancy, he was the logi
cal choice for the captaincy this sea
son, and the honor was justly earned.
In Pomfret's first game of the year
they walloped Worcester's strong
eleven by the top-heavy score of 25
to 0, and Suffield fell a week later
by a margin almost as decisive. In
both contests the erstwhile Bisbee mi
ner romped about the field Bcoring
almost at will and representatives of
three major colleges approached him
after the Suffield game with "induce
ments." However. Schuette decided
as a boy to be a Yale man and If he
lives he will doubtless carve his niche
in Yale's Hall of Fame as a football
and baseball star. The qualifying "if
he lives" Is used because of the tact
that at the end of the present schol
astic year this youthful soldier of for
tune leaves for France and the war.
His military career, as well as his
athletic career, will be well worth
watching.

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at. the tun of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

America bows to the White Sox, the new champions
of 1917. A game ball club that won the blue ribbon of
balldom with heart and brain as well as with muscular
skill. The New York Giants were mechanical marvels
and probably excelled the new champions in strength and
skill, but the courage and quick thinking of the Chicago
players gained for them the verdict.
"LEST WE FORGET.
. Our boys are at the front and others rapidly getting
ready. Kept at the front, clad, housed and made fit, by
funds secured through the Liberty Loan. Without funds,
which means supplies, and army is powerless. "Lest we
forget" let us make our army most powerful let us
make our army most complete and let us keep it in the
most comfortable condition possible. It can be done if
we do not forget that the Liberty Loan means food, fuel
and fittings, and a fighting body that cannot know failure.
"Lest we forget" that it is your boy, your neighbor's boy
who are doing what you cannot do join the army or navy
that sacrifice you make is the equal of theirs that
"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness" are yours only
so long as the army and nav are prepared and fit. Funds,
funds and more funds and all made secure and safe
through the Liberty Loan. Buy your bonds as a privilege
and buy your bonds at once. Do it today, "Lest we
forget"
IT'S UP TO YOU!
While there are pessimistic reports about the second
Liberty Loan, it is certain that it will not fail if the same
spirit is shown everywhere that is manifested here in
the Warren District. The campaign here Is the most
thorough that was ever attempted for anything under
the sun. The Cochise quota will be subscribed if the
work and the response continue as they have begun.
Senator M. A. Smith writes to Miles Merrill of Bisbee
that he is coming here soon for a visit. Which calls
to mind the fact that Arizona is one of the states that
can point to an entire congressional delegation who held
the cause of their country above all selfish aims and
petty ambitions and taint of traitors during the last
session. Not all the states can say the same. Welcome
senator!
General Pershing ha3 sent a call to America for not
soldiers but trained men; specialists. He wants bomb
ers, fliers, engineers, drivers, architects, foremen, store
keepers, iron workers, bridgebuliders, in fact( every class
of highly trained men to serve behind the lines and in
conjunction with the actual fighters. From the great
nationalist army now assembling in cantonments a voca
tional census will salect many thousands for special work
that is just as necessary as bayonet work in winning the
war.
Michaelis will not Iail more than a month, is the pre
diction for the German chancellor, made by close students
of the editorials in the German press. Well, he served
his turn to fool the reichstag. Von Bulow is ready to
take his place and serve another turn. But mark, the
Kaiser sits as firmly upon his throne as ever. Only a
badly beaten German army will shake Wilhelmn's seat.
In the meantime ex-Presldent Taft warns us earnestly
and soiemnly against the terrible mistake of a premature
peace. If the allies will stand firm for another year the
fear of the Hun will have passed forever.
Porter Emerson Browne of The Vigilantes: Our coun
try is at war with Germany.
Hundreds of thousands of, men are making ready to
cross the seas and lay down their lives if need be in de
fense of their country's honor their country's life. Hun
dreds of thousands of other men and women, stand ready
to do all that lies in their power to aid those who are to
fight at the front
And meanwhile a few thousands of men calling them
selves American led by a few scores of men who, too,
call themselves American, are doing all they can to Inv
pede, to delay, to ruin and to wreck the cause for' which
all these others are fighting.
It is as though you 'and I were fighting for our homes
and for our children. A third man, pretending to be our
friend, holds back our fists, thrusts sticks between our
feet casts, peper in our eyes, and does everything in his
power to destroy the effectiveness of our endeavors.
Truly that man is no friend of ours. Truly he belong,
upon the other side, with our enemies.- For everything
he does to impede us helps them.. Every move he makes
that renders us more ineffective, makes them more ef
fective. Only a fool could argue such a point.
I don't know whether Senator LaFoIlette, Morris Hill-
quit Justice Cohalan, George Sylvester Viereck et als are
Judas Iscariots, Benedict Arnolds or Harry Kendall
Thaws. I don't care which they are. But I know they
are a meance to the American nation. And I ask you, 13
It fair to allow these men to ply their rotten trade among
the American people while, at the same time, the Ameri
can people are sending their boys to the front to fight
their open enemies.
Are you going to ask your boys to fight one enemy
in the open while, at the same time, you leave another
enemy hidden behind him to stab him in the, back? ts
that fair do you think?
t
You don't? All right, then, what are you go
ing to do about it?
It's up to you.
Rippling Rhymes

SERENITY.
I sit and sizzle in my grease, when
summer days are blazing, and yet my
soul is filled with peace, tarnquillity
amazing. I sit and shiver when the
snows are drifting on the prairie; the
wintry tempest never blows that
makes my hear; less merry. Not heat
or cold or rain or snow should make
us sad or joyous; we should not let a
tinhorn woe dsiiuro us "or annoy us.
The mind that dwells on cheap john
things, that's aye with tritles freight
ed, one minute sours on shining wings,
triumphant and ela:od; the next it's
shaken off all mirih, it's like a raven
croakin'; it drags itself along the
earth, its pinions crushed and broken.
At night I sit and watch the stars,
ear.h's little things forgetting, keep
tab on Jupiter and Mars, and watch
the dog star setting. I count the moun
tains of the moon, thi'ough doud'.and's
shreds and tatters, and do no; care a
picayune for any worldly matters. Se
rene I sit and watch tb,e mob go past
me, crowding, straining, and hear a
laugh, a sigh, a sob, a curse and much
complaining. They fuss and fret and
chafe and grieve, and try to bilk the
neighbor; aud nothing that they may
achieve is worth the sweat and labor.
Americans Fighting for America
From within the iron ring about the Central Powers
come signs and faint cries of distress. Yes, and some
thing of more sinister significance than these for
there are stories of mutiny upon battleships and rebellion
against authority by soldiers. These stories may have
to do with isolated cases; doubtless do, but they indicate
an unrest a broken morale and shift of feeling that can
not be properly estimated unless one harks back to the
first year of the war when all Germany thrilled with
arrogance, power and the sublime confidence of victory.
The hammer strokes at Verdun and in Flanders may not
have broken through but they shattered the line.
The fuel shortage is general over the country. Bisbee
is not alone as she faces high prices and a scarcity of
coal. Ohio is prcbabiy as hard hit as any state in tbf.
union. Strikes and lack of transportation have made
some of the cities of the Buckeye state desperate enough
to stop coal cars en transit and unload them. In Kansas
where they have enjoyed natural gas piped from the
Oklahoma oil fields fcr the past twelve years, the gas
supply has about given out and strikes in the Kansas
coal fields threaten a fuel famine where people never
paid 'much attention to this problem before. Kansas
City is fighting an alleged coal trust. The declaration of
a Bisbee dealer, recently made through the columns of
The' Review, that the demand had increased far in excess
of the supply Is being home out by assertions and re
ports from many sections of the country.
The announcement that Capt John C. Greenway, gen
eral manager of the Calumet & Arizona and the New
Cornelia mining companies, has joined the service of jiis
country, makes known the fact that another of the nig
men or Arizona has dropped his industrial duties to help
win the 'war for this country and for democracy for the
world. Just what arrangements he has made for carry
ing on the enterprise of which he has been the directing
head for half a dozen years will not be known until he
returns. He is due to arrive next Sunday for a stay or"
a few, days before leaving for France. Captain Green
way was one of the men who went with the Rough Rid
er regiment to Cuba during the Spanish-American war
and that is where he won his commission as an army
officer. Since the United States was forced into the
present war it is known that Captain Greenway has
been "pulling on the bits" in his anxiety to join some
arm of the military organization of his country. He
was called by Colonel Roosevelt to assemble and com
mand a regiment in the division proffered by Roosevelt
for service in France. When this failed Captain Green
way was keenly disappointed and has since said to
friends that he hoped yet to get the opportunity to serve
his country in the resent war.
Captain Greenway is a type of man who believes in
doing tilings and his great capacity for handling large
propositions will be a splendid asset to the engineering
department of the American army in France, just as
he has been a splendid asset in carrying on the enter
prises in Arizona at which he has been at the head.

Council of Defense Starts
Plan to Keep In Close
Touch With Her Sons At
the Front.
The thousands and thousands of people in most mod
erate circumstances and those working for wanes who
are buying Liberty Bonds now, will be mightly thankful
some day In the future that they were induced to buy. STATE RECEIVES BIG CHECK
The plea has come from Arizona's
men in the training camps, "Back us
up."
The AiiiAma council of defense now
comes forward with the answer in the
shape of a detailed plan for rendering
welfare service to the families of the
men who may be in need of assistance
while their fathers or sons are in the
military service.
According to the plans laid down by
the council, every Arizona man in mili
tary service will be card indexed, hie
card containing all the necessary daty
needed by the council to determine ttu
probable circumstances of the iaruilj
at home while the men are in
the service. These cards will be filet.
at the headquarters of the council.
The big point that Dwight.B. Heard
chairman of the council of defense,
wishes to bring out in announcing the
plan is that the work proposed to be
done for the dependents of the men is
not being dune out of a spirit Vif chari
ty. It is being done as a service tha;
the citizens of the sta:e owe these men
and their families.
The council will act as a clearing
house through which the work will b;
organized, the actual service beinf
done by some organized body such as
the Red Cross. The defense councils
of the various Counties will play an im
portant part in the working out of the
plan, and in many instances local or
ganizations other than the Red Cross
may be given the opportunity to take
care of families in their districts in
need of assistance.
The magnitude of the plan is indi
cated by the following table of men

That this is not a Commercial war
and that the United States Is not in it
to "make the world safe for democ
racy," is declared by Lord Northcliffe
in a plain spoken article, entitled,
"What America Is Fighting For," ap
pears in the October issue of Current
Opinion Magazine. Lord Northcliffe
takes issue with President Wilson and
refutes a stock argument of the veiled
pro-German press in. stating that "if
this country had meant to take up
arms in defense of British or French
interests, or in the interest of Bel
ium, or in order to spread democracy,
it would not have waited until April,

well as to cheer down any attempt to
boo Captain Eifdie C'jllins of the visit

Zimmerman Errs.
This vocal applause aid ppiiit wa?
particularly noticeable in the crucial
fourth inning although it must have
been mixed with considerable chagrin
at the peculiar defensive strategy sud
denly uncovered by the Giants. Eddie
Collins opened the inning by hitting
a bounder to Thirdbaseman Zimmer
man who threw the ball low an J wide
Vpf Holke, whereupon Collins romped
'Nnierrily i) second. Rightnelder Rob
ertson next dropped Jackson's high,
but easy fly, and the batter was safe,
while Collins perched on third.
He Repeats.
Felsch hit to Pitcher Benton who
threw to third to get Collins, who
star.ed for home. Catcher Kariden
rushed half-way to t" bag to help trap
the White Sox field captain but Zim
merman to'ok upon himself to make
the put out and started to chase Col
lins toward home. Before the specta
tors or the other players could realize
what was happening, Collins, with Zim
merman in his wake, sprinted for the
plate and passed Rariden fla .footed,
while his pursuer outdistanced in the
dash saw him score without a chance
for a play of any kind. While this
diamond disaster was being enacted
Jackson and Felsch were also racing
around the bags and were perched on
third and second respectively, while
Collins slid across the unguarded
plate. Gandil promptly arose to the
occasion oy singling 10 nguu sconus

Giants Try.
The Giants, awake to the possibility
of losing the game and the champion
ship, charged the Chicago clan vicious
ly in the succeeding session but their
best effort fell one run short of the
Sox trio.
One Run Short
After Holke fanned, Rariden was
passed to first by Faber and Wilhoit,
batting i'Jr Benton, also received free
passage to Ganuil's post. With two
on and one out the thousands began
to root for p rally and the uproar was
deafening. Cowbells, automobile
horns and sirens led the thunderous
chorus while the stands fairly rocked
with the stamping. The White Sox
lwere steady, however, een in the tu
mult and Burns forced Wilhoit at sec
ond, Weaver to Collins. Captain Her
zog then came through with a scream

field wall, scoring both Rariden and
Bifrns. With the tying run on third
the din was terrilc for Benny Kaull

meet the emergency, however, his ef

gathered in. leaving Herzog stranded.
Another Rally.
That was the finish of the Giants of
fense but the Chicago club added a
final run in the ninth as a matter of
safety in case the home team started a
ninth-inning rally.

NEW YORK, Oct. 15. Develop
ments over the holidays appeared to
be of a constructive nature and dur
ing the first hour or so prices were
higher, but as the session progressed
a fresh wave of liquidation and specu
lative selling appeared with the re
sult that drastic declines were record
ed In nearly all directions. Thera
was no news of variety or accompany
ing the selling movement, though per
haps the utterances to the effect that
between now and next June investors
and institutions may be called on to
absorb Liberty bonds aggregating $14,
000.000,000 in addition to the first in
stallment and , the current offerjnfj
of that issue had much to do with
promoting the desire to further ex
change corporate government issues.
At any rate the fact remains that
liquidation was not completed .and
that the pressure which the list was
forced to withstand was heavy. Is
sues, are being ignored and conse
quently caution and careful safeguard
ing of long, lines continue to be in
order.

CHELEY AND DEMAND
OUTLINE DISTRICT'S
"Y" WORK DURING WAR
Efforts to Check Increasing
Juvenile Deliquency Must
Begin at Once All Over
Country.
A banquet honoring H. J. Cheley
of Denver and H. P. Demand of El
Paso was held at the Y. M .C. A.
last evening. About twenty-five
guests were present. Cheley is the
international boys' secretary for the
southwest in "Y" work, while Demand
is the interstate secretary for this
territory.
Morley Speak.
After a delightful and substantial
repast, John C. E. Frye, a member
of the boys' advisory board, intro
duced the two local "Y" workers
among the boys, J. W. Morley and his
assistant, U. J. Waldecker. The for
mer spoke briefly, telling of the im
portance of boys' work and of what
he hoped to accomplish in the district
Among the concrete plans which he
rapidly sketched in words was'a "Hi-Y
club," taking its membership from
high school youths and using as its
motto, "Clean Speech, Clean Sports,
Clean Living."
Smashing Talk.
Cheley spoke next. Easy, fluent and
forceful, he told of the relation of boys
to the war. He pointed out the rapid
rise in juvenile delinquency in all of
the warring countries and he pointed
out the necessity for the association
to start working now to prevent a
similar condition in the United States
a condition, according to Cheley,
which already is beginning to spre;Kl.
He strongly brought out the point
that "there are worse things in war
than bullets.". Demand then told the
assembled guests how the "Y" must
work to offset this state of affairs,
nad he pointed out what must be done
in Bisbee.
Challenge Accepted.
A. B. Richardson was introduced,
and he stated that he thought the time
ripe to put forth a program which
would attempt to checkmate increased
juvenile delinquency in this country
and make for better manhood.
"These men have put something to
us in a personal way," he said. "It
is a challenge a challenge which we
in the district must accept."
Afterwards, Cheley and Demand left
for Douglas by stage. Richardson
leaves this morning for Albuquerque,
N. M where he will have his head
quarters during the campaign in the
southwest for the "Y" $35,000,000 war
fund. He will return about Decem

CAMPAIGN FOR LOAN
STARTS IN DISTRICT
WITH BANG AND "PEP"
Committees Are Meeting With
Big Success In Their Efforts
to Push the Second Liberty
Issue.
If the kaiser could have seen the
enthusiasm with .which the thirty
teams started the Liberty Loan cam
paign in the Warren district this
morning his morale would have been
as much disturbed as was that of his
armies in. the recent English vic
tories.
Thirty teams started out this morn-
nig to cover the district for Liberty
Loan subscriptions, and reports up
to 6 p. ni. show all teams are meet
ing with great success.
The feature of campaign today was
the hundred dollar subscription of 13-
year-old Wilfred Johns. Young Johns
wrote his own check for $100, stating
this was money he had saved from
bis salary as clerk in E. B. Wallace's
cigar store, where he works 'after
school hours and that he was glad
to buy a Liberty bond with it.
Full reports of each day's total sub
scriptions will be published in both!
papers. The total subscriptions re
ceived up to Sunday night, according
to report of J. N. Gaines, county sales
man, was about $800,000. This does
not include any subscriptions collected
by committees out today.
At a meeting of the board of direc
tors of the C. & A. Mining company
today, the board will decide what
quota of C. & A. Mining company sub
scription the Warren district will be
allowed. '
Judge C. A. Lock wood, county or
ganizer, and J. N. Gaines, county
salesman, will leave Bisbee Wedne3
day morning and cover the entire
county campaigning for the second
Liberty Loan.
HOME FROM MEETING.
Dr. W. P. Sims and Mrs. Sims re
turned Sunday evening from Phoenix,
where they spent several days. Dr.
Sims is a member of the state dental
board and while in the capital was
present when a considerable number
of men took examinations for dental
licenses in Arizona. Dr. Sims reports
Phoenix as being very prosperous and
preparing for a big fair week.
Lemons Whiten and

Make Cheap Lotion
The juice Of two fresh lemons
strained into a bottle containing three
ounces of orchard white makes a
whole quarter pint of the most remark
able lemon skin beautifier at about the
cost one must pay for a small jar of
the ordinary cold creams. Care
should be taken to strain the lemOn
juice through a fine cloth so no lemon
pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
fresh for months. Every woman knows
that lemon juice is used to bleach and
remove such blemishes as freckles.
sallownes? and tan and is the ideal
skin softener, smoOthener and beauti
fier. Just try it! Make up a quarter pint
of this sweetly fragrant lemon lotion
and massage it daily into the face,
neck, arms and bands. It should nat
urally help to whiten, soften, freshen,
and bring out the hidden roses and
beauty of any skin. It is wonderful
for rough, red hands.
Y'our druggist will sell three ounces
of 'orchard white at little cost, and
any grocer will supply the lemons.

WILSON ASKS BANKS
TO JOIN THE RESERVE
(Continued From Page One.)
lars involved in supplying credit fa
cilities and in protecting the reserves
of the country have become so fa
miliar to all that I am sure it is un
necessary to dwell upon or expound
them.
"The extent to which our country
can withstand the' financial strains
for which we must be prepared will
depend very largely upon the strength
and staying power of the federal re
serve banks.
State Banks Aloof.
"The state banking institutions for
some reason have until recently
seemed inclined to hold aloof. Con
gress a few months ago -prescribed
very generous terms for the admission
of the state banks into the'' federal
reserve system which have reached
the objections heretofore rsrtsed by
state banks when considering mem
berships. As the law now stands it
leaves member state banks and trust
companies practically undisturbed in I
the exercise of all the banking powers
conferred upon them by the states.
Now Becoming Members.
"Many of the largest state banks
and trust cmopnaies are now becom
ing members, realizing that to win the
war we must conserve all of the phy
sical, financial and moral resources
of our country that our finance must
rest as firm as possible and that they
must be adequately and completelj
conserved so as to respond instantly
to every legitimate demand. How can
this necssary change be brought about
and be made permanently better than
by t"he concentrator of the banking
strength of our country in the federal
reserve system?
Urges Action.
"May I not. therefore, urge upon
the officers and directors of all non
member state banks and trust com
panies which have the required
amount of capital and surplus to make
them eligible for membership to unite
with the federal reserve system and
now and thereby contribute their
share to the consolidated gold reserves
of the country? I believe that co
operation on the part of the banks is
a patriotic duty at this time apd that
membership in the! federal reserve
system is a distinct and significant
evidence of patriotism.
"There are probably 8000 or 9000
state banks and trust companies
eligible for membership which have
not united with the system. These
institutions have it in their power to
add enormously to the resources of
the federal reserve banks, thereby
broadennig and strengthening the
foundation upon which our whole fi
nancial structure must rest. I. there
fore, wish again to impress upon them
my solemn conviction that they can
best measure up to their duties and
responsibilities through membership
in the federal reserve system.
"(Signed)
"WOODROW WILSON,
"President."

STATE COMMISSION
IN BISBEE ON
WAY TO PHOENIX
William Mouer, of the State
Land Department, Was
Here for a Short While. Re
ports State Prosperous.
William Mouer, state land com
missioner, was in the city yesterda
morning on his way home from a visii
to the southern part of Cochise count
and Douglas. He Inspected consider
able land in the val'ey.
He travels in a Ford car and is
accompanied by his son, who manipu
lates the steering wheel.
Mr. Mouer's name always appears
when the probable democratic candi
dates for governor are listed tor nexi
year. He has lived in this state to.
twenty-five years arriving in the staie
with five dollars, a wit'e and wo chil
dren. He has always been a cattle
man and knows this business from the
ground up and this qualification has
been 6f much benefit to' him in solv
ing the many land probituis which
have confronted him during the last
three years.
The land business of the state, ac
cording to Commissioner Mouer is
now systematized and is going for
ward in an entirely satisfactory man
ner to the department and to the
people who have been acquiring some
of the land. The sales have not beei
large yet, but they have brought in
considerable money to the state, esti
mated now to amount to four hun
dred thousand dollars. A good deal
of this money has been loaned to farm
ers in the irrigated agricultural val
leys of Arizona and now it is pro
posed to have the department advance
J100.000 to the Lyman Irrigation proj
ect in Apache county to complete the
rebuilding of the dam' which was
washed away last year. This assist
ance would result in putting about
fifteen thousand acres of rich la .id
In cultivation at an early date and
the advancing of this money would
be a matter of state benefit.
Arizona's Prcsperity.
Speaking of the prcsperity of Ari
zona, Mr. Mouer said that it whs
unprecedented, the only industry
showing any signs of slowing up be
ing the cattle in small areas of the
state where there has been no rain.
According to Mr. Mouer the sheep
Industry is the best of all the stock
interests in the state. A recent salt
of wool htrouch a Flagstaff banV
brought 61 cents per pound in Hoston.
where it had been stored. Lambs
are bringing about $10.25 loaded on

national army is the unofficial in
formation received In Bisbee. This Is
the contingent the entraining date for
which was tentatively fixed at Octo
ber 17. - Delay in furnishing equip
ment for the men is the cause of the
postponing ot the date for leaving for
the training camps. Clothing and
blankets are lacking, but the latter has
been remedied to a considerable ex
tent by the government going imo the
open market and purchasing the ceed
ed bedding. Three and four months
is the shortest passible time in which
the men of the national army can In
tra inod sufficiently for them to be
sent to France, according to a state
ment made by General Crozier of the
general statf in answer to an Inquiry.
