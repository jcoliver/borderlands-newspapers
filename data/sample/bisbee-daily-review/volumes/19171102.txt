After Nickles
(By Review Leased Vlre.)
CHICAGO, Nov. 1. The veneer of
patriotism was badiy cracked iu cer
tain spots in Chicago today when tha
new war taxes went into effect. In
cidentally the shortage of pennies,
nickels and dimes became acute.
Certain moving picture theatres
reized the event to make profi.s for
themselves. The tax on the usual
10-cent admittance ticket is 1 cent
Some houses boosted the price to 15,
and with an air of great generosity
announced "we pay the tax ourselves."
Some-other bouses adopted a different
camouflage. They advanced the price
to 13 cents, which with the 2-cent tax
called for on admissions for more
than 10 cen(s enabled them to charge
15 cents. Thus the country's need
ti.uga thme a nice additional profit
of from 30 to 50 per cent. Other
houses went a-profiteering with, a flat
increase without the camouflage. They
were not alone in this, however.
All over the city articles on which
small taxes bad been imposed
jumped. Teneut arJcles were on
sale at 15, and 25-cent commodities

Experience Gained.
From a military standpoint the ex

considered of a very high value in the
training of contingents which are yet
to arrive on Faench soil. - It was a
tired, dirty, wet, mud-caked body ot
men that returned to the billets. The
men had only two clear days while in
the trenches. They were muddy from
their hats to their shoes. Before any
thing else they required a bath, first
with gasoline and then water.
Today the sun was shining brightly
and the returned soldiers spent moFt
of the time sunning themselves and
their belongings. Some of the fields
in this secti6n of France are covered
with blankets, parts of uniforms and
equipment. Clouds of red dust arose
in these places when later the own

LONDON. Nov. 1. Sir Ericj
Geddes, who recently succeeded Sir J
Eaward (arson as first lord or the
admiralty, made his first address in
parliament today and gave some 'in
teresting and anxiously awai:ed fig
ures on the work of the' navy and

His declaration that between 40 and
50 per cent of the German submarines
operating in the North sea, the At

sunk was not the least interesting ofl
bis announcements, and there was an I
indication of the unceasing war the

added, "it is hardly conceible that
the enemy does Jiot know what he is

Secrecy as to Sinkings
He regretted to say, however, that

Fuel Regulation

In Near Future
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. Resolu
tions designed to restrict the use of
coal in industries considered non-essential
to the conduct of the war will
be put into force soon by the fuel ad
ministration. The plan under consid
eration provides for a classification
of industries in the order of their im
portance and the issuance of a gen
eral order to coal producers directing
them to supply first manufacturing
plants engaged In war work. ,
Domestic consumers will be sup
plied ahead of al Industries and the
regulations will contain special provis
ions for taking care of their require
ments. An upward revision of coal prices
for mines which contain unusually thin
veins and for mines in the hands ol
receivers to permit them to operate
at a profit is probable within a few
days. Heretofore price changes have
been general and have been not ap

EIGHT KILLED IN
Air Raid Over English South
east C4ast Takes Its Usual
Toll, But Not Large Enough
to Hurt the Capital.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON. Nov. 1. Eight persons
were killed and twenty-one others
were injured In the Geramin air raid
last night, according to an official
s'Hipnipni ikkiihci ifinav nv mt khlihu
war department. .
The heavy barrage which was put
proached. Several of these fell upon
open spaces, severely shaking little
suburban settlements where there was
little or no protection from bombs or
the shower of shrapnel.
Barrage Effective
As the Germans crossed the coast
in relays the barrage arose as each
relay made its appearance. After the
experience of former raids, the public
now takes to cover as soon as the
warning of an enemy airplane is giv
en, with the result that before the
guns set up their curtain or shrapnel
the streets were deserted except for
a few people. Same persons found
protection in the subways or the more
strongly built buildings, but a mapor
ity of them last night seemed to pre
fer the safety of their own homes.
When the bugles sounded "All clear"
there was no crowding into the
Btreets, but advantage was taken of
the let-down in the tense situation for
the populace to make up for lost
sleep.
Attempt Elaborate
The air raid was apparently the
most elaborate attempt to "lay Lon
don in ruins" ever made by the Ger
mans. That it was a failure was due
to the new air defenses which, with
the gunfire of the airplanes, harassed
the enemy and broke up bis squad
rons so that only three machines were
able to cross the metropolis, where
they dropped a few bombs.
Before the guns broke out over
London, detonations were heard a
long way off in the east. The people
congratulated themselves that the
raiders were being kept at bay. but
soon sounds were heard which told
the tale of airplanes having broken
through. During some periods the
firing seemed the most intense that
has been experienced during air
laids.
The atmospheric conditions pre
vented anything being seen of the in
vaders.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 1. Seattle j

tonight with badly crippled telephone
service resulting from the strike there

Urges Return.
Telegrams urging immediate return

He intimated that the company was
responsible for the apprent deadlock
in. the negotitions in the following
statement:
"If the company would meet with th.;
mediators in the same spirit displayed

Plenary Powers Asked.
He asserted that unless the present
difficulty which has resulted in partial
paralysis of service in Pacific north

request Secretary of Labor Wilson for
plenary powers." This was taken, to

situation serious enough to warrant op

the affected areas under government
supervision.
Mr. Reed explained that the com
pany's main contention in refusing to
recognize the girls' union, which pre

ence, through commissions, or other
agencies, with "existaning standards,"

realize that "however great the l03B
of mercantile tonnage is and the fig
ures are still very formidable wej
cannot at this stage of the war pick
any one item to deduce therefrom j
that the war, even any phase of tho
war. is gclng well or badly."
Tlie kaleidoscopic change which
-;oes cn in actual warfare, he added,
's continually occurring In workshops
rnd shipyards. To the uninformed
observer it nrust appear some times
that there is no method in the mad
ness of those who control these mat
ers. "But." said he, "I would appeal to
the ccuntry for confidence. There is
a method in what we do.
Submarine Operation
"The general situation regarding
submarine. warfare can best, be deter
mined by the following: figures: Since
the beginning of the war between 40
ind 50 per cent of the German sub
marines operating in . the North Sea,
the Atlantic and ' the Arctic oceans
have been sunk. During the last
quarter the enemy has lost as many
submarines as during the whole of
1916.
"As'regards the sinkings of British
merchant tonnage by submarines, the
German official figures for August are
808,000 tons of all nationalities. They
sank a little more than one-third of
tht amount of British tonnage and
a little more than half of all nation
alities.. Some Facts
"The Germans claim that our ton
nage Is falling so low that there are
not enough ships on the sea to en
able their submarine commanders to
maintain their bag. Let me give you
the facts. In April last, the heaviest
month of British losses by enemy
submarines since the war began, bur
trade followed presumably in satis
factory volume for the enemy subma
rine. In September last, the lowest
month of sinkings, our overseas sail
ings of all ships of over 1600 tons
were 20 per cent in number and 30
per cent in tonnage "higher than in
April. The enemy must, therefore,
find another and better explanation
for bis lack of success. I cannot sup
ply it.
"The explanation is that the long
army of the British navy reached
down into the depths, and thus the
harvest reaped is poorer and the num
ber of German submarines which do
i not return is increasig.
Losses Decrease
"Since April, the highest month for
British losses, they have steadily de
creased and latterly id a marked de
gree. September was the most satis
factory month; October was only
slightly worse and better by 30 per
cent than any other month since un
restricted submarine warfare began.
The net reduction in tonnage In the
last four months is 30 per cent less
than anticipated in the estimate pre
pared for the cabinet early in July.
14 Per Cent Lost
"The total net reduction since the
beginning of the war from all causes
in British tonnage on the official reg
ister in ships over 1600 tons la under
two and a half minions of tons gross,
or 14 per. cent, and that after a pe
riod when our great annies and their
magnificent equipment reecived pri
ority and the great growth of our
navy was simultaneously achieved, to
the detriment of mercantile ship
building. Now that the submarine is
for the present doing less damage,
and the resources of the country arei
again being devoted to a far greater
and an increasing extent to the up
building of the mercantile marine, I
look for net results still more formida
ble." Summary Of Work.
"Summarized, the submarine war
fare amounts to this: Our defensive
measures have during the last seven
months proved so efficacious that in
spite of the increased number of ships
passing through the danger tone there
has been steady reduction in the dam
age done by the enemy submarines. In
the meantime we are sinking enemy
submarines to an increasing extent
Our offensive measures are Improving
and will still more improve and multi
ply. "But, on the other hand, the Ger
mans are building submarines faster
than they have hitherto done and they
have not attained their maximum
strength. It appears to me therefore.
that in the submarine warfare.
elsewhere, it is becoming a test of de
termination and ingenuity between the
two controlling forces.
"For the present I have couie to
the conclusion that submarine warfare
j Is going well for us. The enemy has
done less damage than be hoped and
less than we estimated. He has done
it with a serious and heavy loss to
j himself. At present, we may be jus-
I tified in feeling that his attack on our
I trade is held and is being mastered
and we are justified in looking to the
j future with courage and determination.
Confident that ht will fail."
The first lord said It was interesting
' to recall the position of the German
mercantile marine, continuing:
The Eenemy's Position.
"At the outbreak of the war Ger
many possessed over five million tons
of shipping. Todav nearly hair of It
has been sunk or Is In the hands 'it
ourselves or our allies. She has a 50
I per cent reductlou to our 14 per cent.
"It is well that the British public
should be told what they are up
against. We must not consider our
selves alone, but the alliance as a
whole." .
Save Food and Ships.
He pointed out that while Great Brit
ain has plenty of coal'i'jr victory, It
aly and France have not and It was
essential that thtre should be the
great es: possible economy in. food and
in all imports in order that tonnage
should be saved so that it may be di
verted to other vital needs of the al
liance. He declared:
"We must lay our plans for a long
war. I see i.'j signs of its being a
short one, and all, by their economy
can help the navies of the allies de
feat the submarine."
Sir Eric urged Britons to do their ut
most, as there were greater calls upon
the shipping world. '
The huge army tf the United
States,"he said, "is preparing and has
to be transported and maintained. The
French, Italian and -other allies re
quire seaboard help.' That help can
only be given If the nation is prepared
strictly and vigorously to curtail its
needs, develop home resources and con
serve its present potential maritime
strength." '
Britain's Building.
It had been asked whether Great
Britain was building merchant tonnage
at a sufficient rate to replace the sink
ings. The answer, he declared, had
been given negatively, but it was un
sound and inconclusive to take any
one factor of output as against losses
to be a vital Indication of Great Brit
ain's situation. Britain, he said, now
was equipped pni the scale never
dreamed of before. -"May

wo ua, u..
mercantile tonnage practically equal to
the best year ever recorded in 'our his
tory. And in 191 S it will certainly be
very much greater."- ,.
The speaker expressed confidence
that the skilled workeres would stand
by the nation in carrying out the great
shipbuilding program, just as they had
done in the munitions and other needs
of the country.
"For," he added,, "they may rest as
sured that the parliament and the
country will not permit any action
calculated to lower the standard of,
comfort they have won for their fami
lies and themselves."
Sir Erin said thai the new national
yards now being built would he ready

PEKING. Nov. 1. Chinese coolies
have devised an affective means of
protesting against speeding automo
biles. A few days ago an automobile be
longing to a prominent Chinese offi
cial killed a Chinese child near the
summer palace. The chauffeur was
arrested, but released upon payment
of'a very small fine.
In expression of their disapproval
of the court's action, the parents of
the child and their neighbors erected
a masthead in the middle of the road,
on the very spot where the child wns
killed, under which the coffin was
placed. Inscriptions were frosted on
the sides of the coffin denouncing the
injustice of the court.
Since then the main road has been
abandoned by traffic, but officials ap
parently have not dared to remove tht
body, which is watched constantly by
friends of the bereaved family.

PEKING, Tuesday. Oct. 30. China
has protested against the extension of

between Tsing-Tau and Tsinan-Fu.
captured from the Germans.
On October 1st Japanese established
Dr. Akiyaml as chief civil administra
tor at Tsing-Tau and by decree extend
ed his authority along the railway. The
Japanese civil administration, accord
ing to this decree, is still subservient
to the military administration under
General H'ong at Tsing-Tau.
China holds that Japanese consuls
should administer Japanese civil af
fairs along the railway. The Japan
ese legation here says the civil admin
istration is merely a branch of the mil
itary administration but China con
tends that it is not warranted as the
Japanese decree holds that military oc
cupation continues.
The Chinese newspapers generally
insist that Japan should leave Shan

' I have not only gained 20 pounds
in the past thirty days but my re
covery has surprised everybody who
knew about my dreadful condition,"
said Virgil H. IvOblnson, of 3314 Live
Oak Btreet, Dallas, recently in one of
the most remarkable statements yet
made in connection with Tanlac.
"Last February a year ago,' 'continu
ed Mr. Robinson, "I was taken down
with what some said was auto-intoxication
and what others called ulcer of
the stomach. My stomach was full of
gas all the time and I was badly bloat
ed. It was hard i'jr me to breathe a:
times on account of the gas pressure
and my heart acted bo peculiar I
thought I had heart trouble. I was sent
to sanitariums on two occasions for
treatment and was told an operation
would have to be made before I could
get well.
"I had three X-ray examinations, had
bltfjd tests and took lots of medicines
but kept getting worse. I was so ner
vous and miserable I could hardly
sleep and was so weak, at times I
could scarcely walk. I fell off from
over two hundred pounds tv one hun
dred and fifty and my clothes Just hung
on me. My case seemed to puzzle ev
erybody and I kept going c'Jwn hill un
:I1 I made yp my mind I couldn't live.
I had belched sour gases so long till
my throat was raw and sore and I
lived on cereals and soup so long I had
no strength.
"My father had read a great deal
about Tanlac and Insisted that I take it
and a lady friend and neighbor of ours
right up the street sent word several
times for me fj try it. I didn't have
much hope of it helping me but I was
in such a desperate condition I was
willing to try anything. So you may
know I was surprised and overjoyed
after taking Tanlac a few days to find
I was feeling better. Before I had tak
en half of my first b'Jttle, I could tell I
was picking up in weight and improv
ing rapidly. I weighed regularly and
found I was gaining at the rate of a
half a pound a day.
"I now weigh one hundred and seven
ty pounds, have already gained back
twenty pounds of my lost flesh and am
still gaining, not only in weight but in
health and ctrength. I eat just any
and everything I want and feel simply
fine. My niece got my overcoat ou;
the other day and said, 'Well, we had
put this away we tL'ought for good be
cause we didn't think you would ever
live to wear it again.' The way I'm
picking up now I'll soon be large
wtough for my clothes again, but the
best of all is,' ray troubles are gone
and there's not enough money in Dallas
to buy the good Tanlac bas d'jne me.
All tny people thought I was going to
die and new they can't stop talking
about the wonderful work of Tanlac in
my case. I feel like I want to tell ev
erybody personally about it My
phone number is in the bc'jk and I'll
be glad to talk to any one trying to
find relief from their suffering."

Friday Morning, November 2, 1917.
That German staft otncial who recently declared that
the Americans would be about on a par with the Rou
manians as soldiers In the great war, should go to the
Passchendaele ridge and observe the fighting there for
a little while. In this sector the Canadians, who are
from America and of the same type, style and spirit
of the American troops, have, in bitter hand-to-haml
fighting and in the face of machine gun fire from dug
outs, beaten the pick and flower of the Prussian guards,
the Bavarians and the Pomeranians. And. not only
once, but a half dozen times in the past ten days, hare
these men from just north of our borders decisively
outclassed the pick of the kaiser's troops in every species
of fighting, rough' and tumble, bayonet, bomb, rifle and
any old way. The Canadians have won more glory dur
ing the fighting of 1917 than any other branch of the
allied tribes or races. They took Ylmy ridge and held it
They encircled Lens and could have taken it any day
they were unleashed. And now they are in the van of
the Flanders offensive at the most critical point, which
is to say the Passchendaele ridge. Thousands of Amert
cans are fighting with the Canadian contingent and there
fore we have a right to compare our troops with these
heroes of the 1917 campaign.
On February 1 of this year the. entire fighting forces
of the United States, upon sea and land, numbered 321.004
men. Today they number one million six hundred an1
seventy-five thousand men. A pretty fair increase for
a little more than eight months of effort. Tremendous
work and effort were necessary to place these men under
arms. And their number must be doubled if we are to
be of any real aid to the allies. And these men must
be trained, fed, munitioned, armed, clothed and trans
ported across the water. No wonder the thoughtful and
earnest men and women of the country are appealing
to the people at large to economize and to work and
to give and to increase their productive powers. Wc
must sink or swim in this war. Defeat means tripled
hardships. Only victory pan bring relief. And not a
half way victory. A smashing and complete defeat of
Germany is the only goal that will relieve the pressure
upon our finance, our effort and our economic conditions.
EGGS AND BUTTER.
Los Angeles Tribune: It costs about 2 cents a dozen
to carry eggs in cold storage through a season. Eggs
bought in the middle west last spring at 33 and 35
cents are now offered there In case lots at 38 cents.
Here on the Pacific coast prices are greatly higher.
Even though allowance be made for the increased cost
of feed, prices are disproportionately higher. In the
cast prices havo curtailed consumption to such an extent
that speculators are not finding the demand for their
cold storage eggs from which they expected to gain
their profit
In some places, it is declared, "the market value of
the eggs is less than when they were put in storage,"
and Jt is dded, wholesalers are said to Re facing mil
lions of dollars in losses. So reports the Associated
Press,
The United Press declares: "Next week some of the
storage men with high-priced eggs on their hands will
plead that eggs be Included in army rations to maintain
demand and thus uphold weakening prices."
Over and above all these condition? looms the shadow
of government regulation of prices, not only of eggs,
but of butter not only in the interests of our own armies
and the armies of our allies, but in the interests of the
great body of our people.
Long before this war ends profiteers who prey upon
public necessities will have been taught obedience to
the laws of restraint. When peace returns we should
as a people profit by the lessons we are now learning In
control of prices and distribution.
The Italian alibi is to the effect that while Cadorna
was strongly fortified with men and guns on the Iscnzo
front that the Germans and Austrians "sneaked around
by the back door" of the Julian front and caught him
unawares. Piffle! In modern war such surprises are
impossible. The Italian have a pretty good airplane
service and should have been able to note the massing of
guns and men at any point of the front. It requires dfjs
and weeks to prepare a gigantic offensive. The facts are.
the Italian units entrusted with important positions turned
tail and ran when the German helmets appeared on the
battle front and thus Cadorna's flank was turned and he
had to retreat in a hurry. Justice to brave men com
pels the admission that there are exceptions here and
there. Some of the Italian regiments fought to the bitte?
finish and are today defending the retreat and suffering
supreme hahrdsuips of hunger, cold and wounds. But the
majority, and especially those entrusted with important
positions, made a raoi weak and pitiful resistance.
"Considerable uneasiness exists in business circles
concerning the labor outlook," declares a New York au
thority on national business conditions. "Labor as a
whole hRs been loyal and efficient. Wages have risen
sharply in some instances and are advancing in others.
Generally speaking, labor is unusually prosperous in all
sections cf the country. In not a few instances, how
ever, the effect of high wages has not been what wes
expected, since individuals often prefer to work fewer
days and idle more., Apparently prosperity fails to
stimulate effort; and the result of high wages has, muh
to the surprise of some theorists, resulted in less work
and less product; also more discontent. What the out
come will be Is. a problem that is puzzling many of the
leaders of industry. Already there are rumors of fur
ther demands from railroad employes, who have recently
been tlie recipients cf liberal increases."
"The allies have won no decisive success in Flander.
this year," declared a German general to an Amsterdam
correspondent . No, they have not won any decisive
success, nor have they broken through the German lines
at any point, but they have taken all the high ground
along the battle front and captured about seventy-five
thousand German prisoners and killed and wounded about
a quarter of a million of the kaiser's best troops. They
have won no decisive success, but they have beaten the
Germans in a dozen pitched battles and a hundred skirm
ishes. They have taken positions that the Germans held
to the death and have repulsed scores and scores of the
fiercest counter-attacks that Von Hindenburg could mus
ter. They have never lost permanently a position they
have taken. And today tbey have the edge of the Ger
man war machine and are held only by the rain from
forcing a great German retirement before winter, under
conditions that might well become disastrous. No "de
cisive success," but they are doing very well, thank you.
. More and more public and governmental opinion is
coming around to the point where it views with favor
the Importation of Chinese labor format least the period of
the war. It will solve our industrial problems with a
rush. The Chinaman is a skilled and adept workman
and he has the strength and staying qualities. The
question of wages does not bother him at all. Our ship
yards, our factories, our lumber mills, our farms and our
mines are all calling for men and the response is equal
to about half of the demand. Strikes threaten and blazf
in every section of the country. The remedy may have
its drawbacks and its handicaps and its desperate side,
but the patient is desperate, too, and about ready for any
thing that offers relief. France is using Chinese labor
with most satisfactory results and we may have to come
to it whether we want to or not Union leaders talk
patriotism and industrial peace for the term of the war
as loud as any one, but they are making no real or
serious efforts to keep down the strikw menace on. every
hand and in every line of endeavor.
As a sop to Bavaria, who seeks peace and whose
troops have been slaughtered by the hundreds of thou
sands in the west, the kaiser has removed his Prussian
chancellor and cats paw, Michaelis, and appointed the
Bavarian prime minister. Von Hertling, in his place.
Von Hertling enters office inauspiciously. He Is dis
liked by the Pan-Germans and blood and iron Prussians
and he is distrusted by the socialists and peace win?
of the reichstag. Two months for Michaelis and on?
month for Von Hertling, then another of the fantastic
array of puppets that the imperial German government
is setting before its deluded people.
Nine famous prize fighters are now wearing Undo
Sam's uniform. Among them are Norman Selby (Kid
McCoy), Pack McFarland, Mike Gibbons, Battling Levin
sky, Willie Ritchie, Johnny Kilbane and Benny Leonard.
A galaxy of champions and ex-champions in this array
who have quit fighting for five thousand dollars a night
to fight for thirty dollars a month. But Jess Willard,
the big squash from Kansas, who has never fought since
he won the title, is conspicuous for his absence from
the roll call.
Hearst's yellow pro-German papers have been barred
from Canada. Lucky Canadians. They are saved from
the evil influence of a journalism that plays upon the
shortcomings and crimes of the human race and ex
aggerates the trivialities into critical events and pr -mulgates
treason under a hundred clever and polished
guises.
Great Britain will spend two billions of dollars to
conduct the war the next sixty days. These figures are
staggering. And at least two more years of war to come
unless Germany suffers a collapse, and her drive into
Italy shows no symptoms of a breakdown upon the part
of the central powers.

WANTS TO SEE DAUGHTER
An appeal from a dying father for
an opportunity to once more see his
daughter and grandchild has been re
ceived In this city and it is hoped that
this will come within their notice and
serve to bring them int'j communica
tion. The daughter is Lizzie Bartz,
and the grand child is her daughter
Xina. They are supposed to be living
somewhere in Arizona the father does
not know just where. He is now in
northern California and has requested
H. M. Barstow, 603 Higgins building.
Los Angeles, to try and locate them.
Any information concerning them will
be thankfully received by Mr. Barstow,
who requests that wide publicity be
given this throughout the state.
DO NOT FORGET
That beginning today you will have
to place a 3-cent stamp on your letter
if it leaves the city, and that it will
require a 2-eent stamp on a postal
card or a letter for delivery in the
city. A late collection of the mail
was made in the postoffice last night
about midnight, so that all letters
that were deposited in the postoffice'
before midnight went out stamped Xo
vember 1. The local office has re
ceived a large supply of the new 3
cent stamps, but has on band also a
large amount of 2 and 1-cent stamps
that will have to be used up. The or
ders for stamped envelopes have been
forwarded to Washington, but cannot
be rushed, as orders have gone in
from all points of the United States,
and the department is sending them
out in the order in which they wer
received at Washington.

If you prefer to use your own recipe, be

Why "one-third Uu"i
Simply this:
Wholesome Cottolene is unusually rich

NEW YOTtK. Nov. 1 The stock
market was in the ihroes of another
):ivii:sinn todtiy, liquidation encom
passing tiie entire list at extreme re
regions of 3 to 10 points. Lowest
prices were made in the feverish final
hour, no support being offered even at
marked concessions.
Selling was of a wider and more
urgent character and frequuently wa9
accelerated by bear drives. Recent
efforts of officials cf the exchange to
minimize or restrict such speculative
oner.i'ions culminated in official ac
tion by the exaJiane requiring mem
bers to restrict their borrowings of
stocks to the common business con
duct. '
Discouragement created by recent
developments was increased by pre
dictions of war taxes that are likely
to become onerous. Financial state
ments Issued during the day by vari
ous industrial corporations bore per
linently upon the government s taxa
tion policy.
Today's upheaval centered around
United States Steel. That stock was
offered to the extent of 5O0.O00 shares,
at an extreme decline of 1k points.

VPTIS'I OF GAS FUMES AND BAYONETS PUTS AMERICAN
BOYS IN TRIM FOR FIRST ACTION ON FRENCH FRONT
- tSfc , . ... :!-; : f.-v
fiB XJ&& AtA . J:U
tese nictures of American soldiers in the rear trenches of France are passed by the committee on public fauor
mation and the United States censor. The boya are removing their gas masks (above) after a rigid test ot
their endurance under gas fumes and (below) they are staging some realistic bayonet charging prepara
tory to their first meeting with the boche. m
The American boys behind t'ne linos in France who are receiving the finishing touches in training before
groing over the top probably find them a realistic as the real thing:. Their endurance is being tried in gas fumes
that are as deadly as anything the Huns are likely to hand them. Bayonet practice becomes a dead-in-earnest
business as shown in the latest offcial pictures.
Hungary Suffers
More From War
. Than Others Do
LONDON, Oct. 29. (Correspond
ence of the Associated Press.) Huu
i.ary has sufrered most severely of a"!
the belligerent countries in proportion
to population, according to the Budr
pest newspaper, Pesti Naplo. It draw?
Uiis conclusion from the study of th?
vital statistics just issued by the Hun
garian government. German ciliea
ceased to publish such statistics early
in the war, but the Hungarian reports
have been . continued on a pre-wa.
basis and the repors of births, deaths
and marriages this year are character
ized by Pestl Naplo as "most alarm
ing." The paper says:
"The war has caused a destruction
of man power at the front which can
malely,.but the devastation at horns
seems to have been even more terribU
than that among the fighting forcer.
The losses at home have certainl;'
been much more serious.'
"The number of births and mar
riages has declined considerably i.l
other countries as well, but in Hun
gary the excess of deaths over birth".
in the civilian population alone
has grown to such a frightful extent
that In February of the present year
the deaths exceeded tr.e births D;'j
more than 13,000." i
The writer, a?ter pointing out thst
dea'hs among civilians during th?
third year of the war exceeded th
births by 130,000, says that the Hur.
r.arian losses at the front in the sama
period were over l'i0'00. accorain ;
to the 600 casualty lists published.
The number of men who are at the;
front or who have done military ser
ice is given as 3,000,000, or orese
enth of the entire population. Dis
cussing the civilian death rate, th3
writer says:
- "Deaths due to bad ami inFiifficio'V
food have ccriainly increased in a very
marked way."

the farmers with an offer of $3.81 but

met at Belvedere, Elgin, Dundee and
elsewhere and agreed to insist on the

the local restaurants will start today
; when they will serve no meat. Next
' Wednesday the same houses, and in
all probabili.y many more, will adopt
a wheatless Wednesday,
i For several days local restaurant
men, led by William Truax, Jr and
Henry i 'op pen. of the Copper Queen
Hotel, have been looking to the estab
lishment of a meatless and wbeatiess
day in each week. Through the exper
ience of other communities and other
restaurants it was found that Wednes
i day was bes' suited for a wheatless
menu and Friday for a nieatlos three
i meals.
j To this end the two men sought the
j co-operation of the tiher restaurants
I and boarding house in the Warren
District. Today the Copper Queen,
the English Kitchen and the Y. W. C.
