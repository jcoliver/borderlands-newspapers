the Somme. where the Germans have
been making such strenuous efforts
to break through to the north w?st

A German attack had seemed to be
forecast by this great cannonade, but
up to an early hour this afternoon no
enemy infantry forward movement had
been reported. The enemy bombard

Hurley Plans to
Build Many Ships
'of Concrete Type
' (Ey Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. April 8. Fifty
million dollars will be ask ?d of
congress tomorrow by Chairman
Hurley of the shipping board, for
development of concrete ship
building. The pis; is to estab
lish at once five government
yards, two on the Pacific coast
and thro? In the south.
As yet concrete ships are ad
mitted frankly by experts to be
"a gamble" because the behavior
of such a vessel under load ina
seavy sea is unknown.
Mr. Hurley and General Man
ager Piez, of the Emergency Fleet
corporation, hold that in the pres
ent emergency every possible
means of adding quickly to the
war tonnage should" be utilized.
The concrete ship "Faith." built
on the Pacific coast for priate
account, Is almost ready to under
take a voyage. Engines probably
will be installed by M.v 1. Pre
liminary reports on the launching
cf the "Faith" have been encour
aged. The J50.OO0.0O0 requested'
will be spent almost entirely for
ships, as each yard can be built
for perhaps $25,000. The yards
will hav from four to seven ways
each. Locations in the west and
south will be sought to avoid
moisture and cold which retards
concrete pouring. It was sail an
thoratively that the Pacific U

JUNCTION BRIGGS IN
FREE HITTING CLASH
Douglas 8, Junction-Briggs 5.
This was the result of the baseball
giue Sunday afternoon at Warren
par when the local leaguers went
dowu to defeat at the hands of the
smeller city club, composed largely of
soldiers.
The game was slow but numerous
exciting plays kept the Interest up
until the end. Considering the ex
tremely poor condition of the grounds
the :nfielders did good work, although
risking their lives on the rocky, un
even surface of the diamond every
time that a ball was hit hard.
McArdle's work at short for the
Junction-Briggs club scintillated as
the former coast leaguer knocked
down hard chances and nipped run
ners in approved fashion. Mac is one
of those players who cannot be bother
ed -f the ball is not within reach for
under such circumstances he dives
after it and whenever able to touch it
and knock it down he recovers it and
wbiis it to first for a putout.
Grounds Very Rough.
The Junction club showed up poorly
due tc lack of condition as the play
ers apeared overweight and stiff. It
will take considerable limbering up be
fore they will be able to show at their
best. Manager Pitman has a number
of strong players and with proper
workouts the club should play real
league balL
What impressed one most at Sun
day's game was the condition of the
playing field as this is in such a
churn that mnlnr learners WOUll look
like dubs as the ball never bounces the
same way twice arter hitting one :i
Mm email rorks which resemble in
size ihe Washington monument. There
are myriad of them, ana too me aia
a ia nft in KTvota with sand ser
eral inches deep which also makes
fielding more a matter of bravery man
science.
Starting off with two runs in the
first chapter the Junction club looked
good at bat but Douglas evened up
matters, in the third with the local
i.ia vera fnrcintr to the front with an
other run in their half of this spasm,
mak'nir the count three and two. The
Junctions added one more in the fifth
and Douglas also tailed in the sixtn.
In the seventh the locals made t'.ie
standing five to three by scoring a
run but Douglas came back in its na;i
witii two runs when hits, errors and
w;$lk& were bunched.
Pitchers Need Work.
Krcra there on the Junctions wore
oM,. m ransn the score board boy
any labor but Douglas slammed in two
more counters in tne eignia ana oir
in the ninth.
Fred Brainerd, former New Yom
Giant, pitched for the Douglas club and
did aice work. Red Toner opened for
the Junctions and toiled for six
frames with Lefty Harris assuming
the burden thereafter. Both can be
expected to show in better form when
they get more practice.
The Copper Queen team was out tar
practice yesterday afternoon and v. ill
workout again tomorrow and also Fri
day. Carnes team is rapidly roundhi
into shape and the players should be
fit foi their opening game April 17
with the C. & A. team. Unless the

and Will Win Big
I met a friend of mine on the street the pther day, one
of the biggest and most successful oil operators in Den
ver, with large interests in Wyoming and Kansas, where
he cleaned up about $500,000 last year. The follow
ing conversation ensued:
- "Hello, Overfield, what are you doing?"
"Why, I am in the oil business, as you know."
"Yes, but why afe you practically giving away oil
leases in such good territory as the Richards Field, Wy
oming? "To raise $60,000 to drill wells there."
"Well, that's all right, but you are giving all the best
of it to the public."
"Why shouldn't we?" I answered, "if the public
furnishes the money ?"
"But your proposition is unusual, isn't it?
"I know it is. But it's the unusual that generally
wins."
"I guess that's right, but where does the company
come in?"
"Let us suppose the company gets a 500-barrel well
on this section. What i3 it worth to the company?" I
asked.
"About $275,000 net yearly."
"Well, that's eoual to over 27 per cent on our out
standing stock. Will that pay the company?",
"I should say it would. I see your point; but you give
a big bonus of stock to the buyers of these leases; they
also participate in the dividends."
"Of course ; why shouldn't they? If their money
drills the wells?"
"That may be all right, but a 500-barrel well will
make an acre lease on that section worth $5,000 to $10,
000." "The company will be only too glad of that, because
they own the adjoining section and that would be
proven up and worth from one million to two million
dollars to the company, would it not?"
"You are right ; your argument is sound, but it look
ed to me at first as tho you were giving too much for the
money."
"We had figured that all out before we made the of
fer. "I see you are eoing into Mexico."
"The company is already in. It has an option which
it can take over any time.
"Well, take it up. Mexico is destined to be the big
gest oil producing country in the world."
"We know that from investigation, and we are going
to take up the option,"
"You are on the right track and will win big."
Like some ethers he hadn't reasoned it out. Have
you? Then we expect your order, because it should
pay you big money, possibly a fortune.

From several cities today can.e word
that an attempt was being made .to,
commercialize the honor flag idea.
and that flag manufacturers were so-
liciting orders for large quantities of

American Federation of Labar, in a

it meant great economies and to "do

About sixty additional communities
reported today that they had sub
scribed their quota and won the flag
making mor? than 200 names on the
honor roll in the two days of the cam

April 21 as Liberty lean Sunday and
in a letter to 114.000 preachers, asked
that special sermons bi preached on
that day.

people honestly differ on the cause of
the war. Senator Poindexter retorted
that the Georgia senator had not "par

his opposition to the draft law.
J-'enator Sherman. Illinois, denounc
ed the recent lynching of a German at
Colliiicville, 111., as a "disgrace" ac

Republicans Take Issue.
Senator Gallinger, the republican

Another unsuccessful effort - wa.s

Reterring to the discussion Saturday
or Colonel Roosevelt's statement that
the bill would prohibit criticism of the
president. Senator Myers of Montana
saiu neither the pending bill nor the
one proposed by him last August wuold
prevent legitimate criticism and that
even if the words "president of the
United States" eliminated from the
original draft, now were re-inserted,
such criticism would not be' affected.
He added, however:
"I believe that when we are engaged
in war, anybody who uses vile lang
uage against the president ought to be
punished. I believe it is Just as of
fensive to use disloyal language

government to the pnvor:imi of Austria-Hungary.
"When Count Revertata,' after hav
ing obtained the sanction of the Aus-tra-Hungarian
government, replied In
i the affirmative to this inquiry, in the
Isame month July Major Armani
charaed with such communica
tion by the then French premier. Iti-
bot. He arrived August 1017, at
Count Revertata's private residence in
Freiburg, the count being distantly
related to him.
"Maior Ariand addressed to Count
Revertata a question as to whether
discussions between France and Austria-Hungary
were possible.
"Thu the Initiative for these dis
cussions was taken from the French
side.
Wanted General Peaee
"Count Revertata reported to the
Austria-Hungarian foreign minister
that this question had been put on in
struction of the French government,
and the minister thereupon requested
Count Revertata to enter into discus
sions with the French confidential
agent and in the course of these dis
cussions to establish whether by this
means a basis for bringing about a
general peace could be secured.
"On August 22-23. Count Revertata
entered into discussions with Major
Armand which, however, as Premier
Clemneeau quite correctly declare,
yielded no result. The negotiations
thereupon were broken off.
"The Clemenceau versions that the
discussions between Revertata an!
Armand were proceeding on his wav
invo otffe is incorrqet. Xot until
January 1918 did Armand. this time
on instructions from Clemenceau,
aeain get into touch with Revertata.
The thread had ben broken in Au
gust. 1917, and was, therefore aeain
taken" up by Clemenceau himself in
January 1918.
Hints at Omission
"From this fresh contact, thare re
sulted the discussions referred to In
the official communique of April 4.
1918. It is. however, correct that
Count Revertata randed to Major Ar
mand on February 23, 1918. the mem
orandum regarding which Premier
Clep'encean only cites the first sen
tence and which confirms that In the
discussions wIMi Armand. which had
taken place in August 1917, Revertata
was charged wit hthe task of tindin?

from the French government which

with the facts when Count Czernin.
In his speech April 2, last, declared
that Premier Clemenceau had some
time before the beginning of the west
ern offensive inquired, whether I was
prepared for negotiations and what

"The accusation of lying broueht

"To hide his conruslon he tried to!

Another Illiad of Glory
For q Homer
prime.
i ii
Daliac
As the details of that first ten days of
fighting that followed the beginning of the
German drive March 21 begin to come in
from the thrilled pens of the special writ
ers, one is convinced that a greater. Illiad
of human glory could be written than that
of Troy's plain, if only there were a Homer
to write it. If only Ruydard Kipling, the
Homer of the British army, were in his
What tales he could tell and what
he could sing of the heroism of his
countrymen during the last ten days of
March.
Out gunned and out numbered three and
four to one, these British troops over a
front extending from Arras to Le Fere,
thirty-five miles at least, fought over every
foot of ground in the twenty-mile retreat
and exacted a price for it in German blood.
Every wood and slope and farm house and
village and redoubt had ifs group of Brit
ish heroes who fought to the last and of
those who retreated slowly and 'doggedly
with their faces to the foe. The Londoner,
the Scot, the Irish, the Australians, the men
from Yorkshire and Lancaster and the
sweet Devon lanes, heroes, these, as brave
as ever Ajax, Diofhed or Achilles upon the
plains of Troy.
It was the thin fringe of the British rear
guard that held the enemy back and smash
ed his schedules and disrupted his plans and
clogged the wheels of his clockwork. Story
after story is coming to light out of the pali
of smoke that hangs over Picardy telling
of a valour never excelled by knight or
man-at-arms of any nation of any age.
Never was the sutbborn British infantry
more stubborn than here in the hour of
England's greatest need. At Crecy, Agin
court, Blenheim, Waterloo, British hero
ism against odds won undying fame, but
upon not one of these immortal fields did
English soldiers excel the deeds of their
decendants of this day.
One of these epic tales has to do with the
holding of a redoubt by a battalion against
three German regiments for two days and
nights and then a slow and deliberate retire
ment in the face of attacking hordes, exact
ing fearful toll for every backward step.
And of how the Scots held a village against
odds of five to one while London men
brought forward tractors and hauled all
their heavy artillery off the field. And of
the glorious eight day? of fighting by a cer
tain famous regimerr. v.'itn three centuries
of tradition behind it. And of those grim
and dextrous slayers, the machine gun com
panies, scores and scores of which held
out to tha bitter end. And of the colonel
who himself fired three hundred joundi of
cartridges and did not see ho vhe could
have missed a shot with dense masses of the
foes packed before him.
the glorio"s tight days of fighting behind it.
And cf a colonel who himself fired three
hundred rounds of cartridges and did not
see how he could have missed a shot with
dense masses of foes packed before him.
They broke the waves of the cnrushing
hosts, did these Spartan units of British in
fantry, fighting isolated combats upon ev
ery portipn of a field thrity miles wide by
twenty-five deep. Not a weakling regiment
of all these, tried and untried, of the Eng
lish forces. They won new and brighter
glory for Britain than had ever been won
before in all the thousand years of Eng
land's glory. k
Backward, ever backward, were the or
ders that came to these gallant men. Mile
after mile of historic ground they gave up,
but still their fighting spirit was not dimin
ished. Men fell in their tracks from sheer
exhaustion and then arose and plunged in
to battle again to the music of their regi
;r.crtii Land's. Neither numbers nor defeat
could caunt them. They were mace of the
stuff of which heroes are made and they
either died like heroes 6r are fighting like
heroes still upon the Ficardy plain 3.
Allies like these are worth fighting with
and for. Their resistance to the Hunnish
hordes, as the story unfolds, will inspire
America like a flame. Ah, if another
Homer but lives to lavish the stores of a
mighty genius upon this struggle, the song
would be recited and sung a thousand years
hence by our children's children with flash
ing eye and swelling accents of pride un
dimmed by time or repetition.
The fighting men of today are as great
and as brave as those of any day. Of this
there is not a doubt. What of our poets
and singers of deathless songs?
DOES HUNT CARRY AN I. W. W.
CARD?
At last comes a cheering word of the
Armenians. They have become tired of
being massacred in wholesale lots and have
organized an army to defend themselves.
The simply and only solution of the Turk
ish problems for the Armenians. This new
army has taken Erzerum, recently evacuat
ed by the Russians, who captured it a year
ago frcm the Turks. The exploit of these
brand new soldiers, made from slaves and
remnants escaped from former massacres,
should encourage the Armenians. For
thirty years or more word has come from
Armenia,. every year, of massacres. They
must be a populous people, the Armen
ians. They have been killfcd by the hun
dreds of thousands and still there are
enough left for an army. They will never
have a better time to strike against Turkey
than now, or a time when their blow was
needed more by Christendom, Maybe the
worm has turned at last. From victim, the
lowly Armenian may well turn to be
avenger.
ARIZONA SECOND
IN ENLISTMENTS
OF MEDICAL MEN
'AMIENS SHALL NOT FALL " FOCH'S PROMISE TO FRANCE
(El Paso Times.)
Announcement that William B. Cleary, a
radical attorney of Bisbee prior to a certain
day last July when he left with some 1 200
others on what was called the "deportation
special," has associated himself with coun
sel for the defense in the trial of I 1 2 Indus
trial Workers of the World at Chicago, re
calls the fact that Mr. Clear' holdi gome
sort of state office by sanction of Governor
G. W.P.Hunt.
He is said to be serving without retainer,
possibly because his heart is with the I. W.
W., and he intends to stand by the "rebels"
as they call themselves in their "revolu
tion" against the established order of the
United States. They are charged with vio
lation of the espionage act and accused of
hampering the United States in the conduct
of the war by acts of sabotage, of obstruct
ing the draft and hampering enlistments,
all of which are directly in the interests of
Germany.
It is hard to understand why Governor
Hunt can allow Mr. Cleary to absent him
self from his official duties to participate
in this distant and probably lengthy trial.
. That is, it is hard to understand unless one
remembers that Governor Hunt, while at
Globe during the strike, was the friend of
the I. W. W., and that recently some of his
correspondence with a jailed I. W. W. of- .
ficial with the suspicious sounding name of
wriift 11 1 1 11 -
Wolhleschlegel was made public. Gover
nor Hunt seem3 able one day to review a
regiment soon to fight Germany and an
other day to address an I. W. W. anti
American of Teutonic origin as ' "friend
Charles." Some of the governor's procla
mations are of highly patriotic tone. But
still he seems able to feel friendship for men
who are trying to hamstring their country
and render it helpless before the enemy.
In contemplating Governor Hunt, one
wishes he were either on one side of the
fence cr the other. And one also wishes
that lawyer Cleary were either ejected from
a state office to which he ought never to
have been appointed, or at least made to
stay at home and attend to his job. Champ
ioning the cause of these Industrial Work
ers for Wilhelm is an affront to the decent
citizenship of Arizona and an insult to ev
ery one of those brave young soldiers
whom Governor Hunt reviewed.
Arizona, with 307 physicians in the
state, and with 70 oi these reconiend-
ed by the surgeon general of the Unit
ed Males for commissions in the Unit
ed medical corps, ranks second among
all states of the union. The average
of the state for acceptances and reco
mmendations for commissions is 22.8
per cent. Nevada, with 24 per cent,
154 physicians, and 37 recommended
for commissions, ranks first. Mon
tana ranks third, and Pennsylvania
fourth. The response of the middle
west and far west is seen in the fig
ures since the highest ranking states
are of this district. These figures
are of March 1, and are issued oy the
United States bureau of information.
At the same time that these figures
are given publicity the call of the
surgeon general for new enlistments

ing call of members to active serv
ice, is issued. The general medical
board of the council of defense is co

CHICAGO, April 8. Bullish inter
pretation of the government crop re
port together with official notice that
new style trading would go into ef
fect on Thursday, led to a material
increase today in the value of corn.
Prices closed firm, &c net higher,
$1.27 May. Oats gained' V41 to
1 and provisions a shade to ten
cents.
Corn exhibited strength right from
the outset. General belief prevailed
that the May delivery would reach
the maximum level of prices as soon
as business in new style fuiure de
liveries began, for the change in rules
makes the commercial grades of corn
the contract grade. Furthermore the
new style deliveries will be without
a maximum price. The fact that trad
ing continued to be restricted in vol
ume for any one account operated as
a handicap on the bulls, but was more
than offset later by the government
report showing 9.5 per cent increase
cf brood sows on farms and by a
big falling off in the weekly total
of the visible supply of corn.
Oats was firmer largely in sympathy
with corn. Packers' buying rallied
provisions.

Indicated that going over the top on
this occasion will be easier than on;
two former occasions, wh-n the dist
rict over-subscribed their allotment.
Included in the committee which
yesterday canvassed the sixteenth dis-
drlve, when they discovered that al
ready many residents have applied di
rectly to their banking institutions for
bonds. ,
"It is a great pleasure to find peo
ple waiting for you with a smile."
said one of the committeemen at the
conclusion of the day's work. "From
the great success of this committee
for 'over the top' no doubt all other
committees will meet with the same
smile and fortune. The Warren dis
trict must go over tb top and we
must have the flag, and this commit
tee will be on duty daily until its
share of the work has 'been com
pleted." During yesterday the district's
"trench sign' which will indicate th-i

D"n Ani':8 and RoeT Pelton. They
found heir district 100 ivr cent loyal,
arrl full prepared for the drive.
The object of the committee in the
Mond'.y c-impaien was to appraise the
district of the drive and to pain a
preliminary purvey of te possibilities
In tVdr sect!on of the city. They re
ported following their canvass, that
they did not have to advise the peonle
of tte lrive. that no explanations were
necessary, that there w?re no ques
tions and no requests for literature.
Instead nearly everyone approached
was ready to pign up at once for at
least one bond and several pledges
for ten or more bonds were taken.
Numerous checks and a large sum in :
cash was taken from those who wished
to end the transaction at once.
In the banks the committee met
with another astounding feature o" the
ing. where it overlooks Main street,
directly opposite the Bank of Bisbee.
The sipn is in the naturnf a bat
tlefield, representing German trenches.
Above the trenches is the ouestion.
"How Many Trenches Will This Dls-I
trict Take?" Each trench represents
a certain sum, and as sums are sub
scribed trenches will be taken thrwugh
a public ceremony, while the German
fenches will be pointed out and dol
lars painted in.
No deMnite announcements of sums
subscribed are expected until after the
committees have been furnished with
literature and blanks. In the mean
time, however, it is anticipated that
committees in charge of every dist
rict in the campaign will begin their
preliminary work, will make a can
vass of their field, ascertain rf proxi
mately what ma ybe expected, and se
cure all possible pledges. Other com
mittees have already signified their in
tention of beginning their work and
every coramitteo In the district will
probably be at work before the end
of the week.

It is a story that is old in oncin.
but always new in the teliiug. and in
the picture each detail stands out in
all the beauty modern photography
has given us. As presented .n the

Wherever there are men. women

this picture will be shown. It will be

of two, reelB at each performance, mak
ing a total of 32 reels for the com

Marie Walcamp Is featured in this

marvclcus adventure, depicted with ;
gripping realism in every episode are
some of the glowing terms in which

The picture is a Universal produc

made by this company.
OLD PRESCRIPTION FOR
. FOR WEAK KIDNEY
Have you ever stopped to reason
why it is that so many, products that
are extensively advertised, all at once
drop out of sight and are soon for
gotten? The reason is plain the arti
cle did not fulfil the promises of the
manufacturer. This applies more
particularly to a medicine. A medicinal
preparation that has re'al curative
value almost sells itself, as like an
endleps chain system the remedy is
recommended by those who have been
benefited, to those who are in need of
it
A prominent druggist says "Take
for example Dr. Kilmer's Swamp-Root,
a preparation I have sold for many
years end never hesitate to recom
merd, for in almost every case it
shows excellent results, as many of
my customers testify. No other kid
ney remedy that I know of has so
large a sale."
According to sworn statements and
verified testimony of thousands who
have tired the preparation, the success
of Dr Kilmer's Swamp-Root ia due to
the fact that so many people claim, it
fulf'.ls almost every wish in overcom
ing kidney, liver and bladder ail
ments, corrects urinary troubles and
neutralizes the uric acid which causes
rheumatism.
You may receive a sample bottle of
Swamp-Root by Parcels Post. Address
Dr. Kilmer Co., Bingbamton, N. Y.,
and enclose ten cents; also mention
the Plsbee Daily Aeview. ' Large and
medium size bottles for sale at all drug
stores.

HOW MRS. BOYD
AVOIDED AN

Canton, Ohio. "I suffered from a
female trouble which caused me much
sullenng, and two
doctors decided
that I would have
to go through an
operation before I
could get welL
" My mother, who
had been helped by
Lytiia E. Pinkham's
Vegetable Com
pound, advised me
to try it before sub
mitting to an opera
tion. It relieved me
from mv troubles
so I can do my house work without any
difficulty. I advise any woman who is !
afflicted with female troubles to give
Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable Com- I
pound a trial and it will do as much for
them." Mrs. Marie Boyd, 141 5th :
St, N. E., Canton, Ohio. !
Sometimes there are serious condi- j
tions where a hospital operation is the
only alternative, but on the other hand j
so many women have been cured by this ,
famous root and herb remedy, Lydia E. !
Pinkham's Vegetable Compound, after
doctors have said that an operation was ;
necessary every woman who wants j
to avoid an operation should give it a ;
fair trial before submitting to such a
trying ordeal
If complications exist, write t) Lydia
