GROAFE CALLS
STATE WK STRIKE
State Federation President
Casts Caution to Winds in
Wobbly Act to Protest
Mooney Sentence.
In Defiance of Gompers, Who
Puts Foot Down on Such
Violation of Union Labor
Laws and Government
Agreement Croaff's Call
Received Coldly Here and
Elsewhere in State.
The attempt of T. J. Croaff, presi
dent of the State Federation of Labor,
to call a state wide strike in sympathy
with Tom Mooney, and to protest his
conviction and sentence for the San
Francisco preparedness day bomb out
rage, seems doomed not to get any
where, at least if one is to judge by
the reception of the announcement in
the Warren District.
A state wide 'strike in Arizona at
this time would mean a paralysis of
copper production that would be c seri
ous menace to the nation in its war
program. It would be a direct and
flagrant violation of Union Labor's
agreement with ethe government. It
would be an open and flaunting effort
to deliver the state over to wobbly
ism.
Croaff's act in pushing the re.xo'j
tion through a packed and radical ex
ecutive committee was tragic eron?h
in its intentions, hut its reception by
union labor throughout the state tend i
to make it rather ridiculous.
Croaff's action was In open defiance
of Samuel Gompers, head of the na
tional federation. It was an outlaw
stroke, much like that of a citizen who
defies his government by holding up
a train or a bank.
Members of the. recently organized
Warren District Trades Council ex
pressed themselves freely as declaring
they would pay no attention to the
Croaff strike order, as it had already
been annvlled by Croaff's superior,
Samuel Compers. head of the national
body. A sympathy strike must have
sanction, they declare, from the na
tional body. To the wobbly element
only of the camp the Croaff order ap
pealed. In fact, the order smacks of
wobblyism pure and simple. It was
not unlooked for, as Croaff had already
urged armed revolution against all au
thority to protect Mooney, in an article
in his State Federation paper.
OPPOSITION AT PHOENIX
PIIOSXIX. Ariz.. April 23. A can
vass of members of organized labor in
this city today indicates opposition to
the resolution adopted the night before
in the name of the Arizona Federa
tion of Labor, calling for a May day
strike, as a protest against the exe
cution of Thomas J. Mooney. T. J.
Croaff. president of the federation,
who signed the resolution, a member
of the lalior committee of the state
council of defense, and federal labor
commissioner for this state. Members
of the council today declined to be in
terviewed regarding the action of
Croaff. Governor Hunt also stated
that he would make no comment on
the resolution.
NO STRIKE AT TUCSON
TUCSON. Ariz., April 23 The Tuc
son trades council has received no of
ficial notice regarding the threatened
Mooney Strike, called by the executive
board of the Arizona Federation of
Labor. The council will meet tomor
row night and a labor union official
said today, that if official notice was
received in the meeting the body
might take some action with reference
to the proposed Mooney strike; His
opinion was that "there'll be no
strike." He pointed out that none of
the unions couJd strike without the
sanction of the International organiza
tion. CAST CAUTION TO WINDS
PHOENIX. Ariz., April 23. Casting
caution to the winds and leading a
bolt by labor radicals, apparently in
sympathy with Wobblyism, T. J.
Croaff. president of the State Federa
tion of Labor, last night overrode con
servative labor in the State Federation
and got through a radical packed exe
cutive committee a call for a state
wide strike May 1 to protest the sen
tence of Tom Mooney, convicted of
the preparedness day bomb outrage in
San Francisco.
The Croaff action was in defiance of
President Samuel Gompers of the
American Federation, to which the
State Federation is subsidiary. Gomp
ers having declared that no such ac
tion could be taken under union law
and thit it would be repungent to
union labor. Croaff and his group of
radicals have been violently urging the
action taken yesterday by the state
executive committee for sevral weeks,
although their course has not met with
expressions of favor from the Federa
tion sub-divisions In the state, some
of which have been reported as declar-

ACTIVITY INCREASES
IN WYOMING FIELDS
The Kinney Oil and Refining Co.
of Wyoming has made a contract with
Elmer Green for the drilling of five
wells on the proved acreage held by
that company: in the Pilot Butte field.
Drilling will start at once and all
materials, including pipe and cable
tools, are now at Riverton awaiting
movement to the field. Green is one
of the most successful drillers in the
Big Muddy feild and should complete
the first of these wells within the
next month.
The Carter Oil company, which ob
tained several leases in the Maverick
Springs dome, near Riverton, Wyo.,
last October, is moving material to
the field and will begin drilling at
once.
The Ohio Oil company, operating
one of the leases in this district, has
a hole down 800 feet. The Carter Oil
Co. is a subsidiary of the Standard
Oil company of Ohio, and this is the
first instance of Its operations in
Wyoming. The Ohio Oil company has
decided to make a thorough test oi
the Copper dome field (45 miles west
of Laramie) on which it brought in
a well of several months ago at a
depth of 700 feet w ith a production of
approxomately twenty-five barrels a
day. It is believed that this is on
the edge of the Structure or anticline
and on that theory several other wells
will be drilled in the hope that a
larger field can be found. The Struc
ture is well covered and hence the
necessity of drilling a series of holes
to thoroughly prove up the field.
The Pilot Butte Field afore referred
to is situated immediately west oi
i Bishop's Dome Field and adjoining
i cnmfk Mnvprick Snrins "Dome ad-
joins Bishop's Dome on the north.
Bishop's Dome Fejd contains 1920
acres and is the 'property of Ameri-
i ive corporation owning and controlling
upwards of 30,000 acres of valuable
j oil land3 throughout five oil states and
Mexico.
This company is meeting wiTh much
success in the sale of oil Ikai leases

BABY
BONDS
Employes of the Calumet and Ari
zona mining company in this district,
have pledged the monthly purchase of
1,931 war savings stamps. These
pledges have been made through the
circulation of pledge cards among the
employes, and represent the monthly
share which the workmen of the orga
nization are willing to lend toe gov
ernment through the issuance of Baby
War Bonds.
Purchase of this number of war sav
ings stamps each month assures the
sale to the employes of the company
of $8,132.98 for the month of May. In
June the sum will be a little larger,
due to the addition of one cent to
each stamp purchased, and so on for
the year. For the remainder of the
year this assured the placing in the
Calumet & Arizona force of approxi
mately $P5,000 in Baby War Bonds.
Following is the statement for May:
Sold for cash 522 stamps
Promised for cash 455 stamps
Extra for May si stamps
Monthly subscriptions ...1,931 stamps
Officials in charge of the stamp cam
paign in the district state that the
workmen of the Calumet & Arizona
are among the best organized for the
sale of war stamps in the state. They
declare that the movement has been
so popularised that few of the em
ployes but have agreed to the purchase
of one or more stamps each month.
They are highly satisfied with the re
sults attained, and are confident that
when tho p'an of organization used by
the C. &A becomes better understood
many other large concerns of the state
will show an equal readiness to sub
scribe to the little stamps and bonds.

IS IT "JUST A COLD"
Bisbee Pecple Should Ask Themselves
This Question
Don't say: "It's just a cold "
It may turn into backache, rheumatic
aches, achy joints.
Or other serious sicknesses that
comes from weak kidnevs.
Colds are due to congestion.
Congestion makes the Kidneys over
work to filter the bloor.
Colds cften leave the kidneys weak.

Then use Doan's Kidney Pills to
avert the kidney dangers.
Let this liisbee resident tell you
about them.
Mrs. Sallie Haigler, 209 Opera Drive,
says: "I keep Ooan's Kidney Pills e:n

it settles to my kidneys or when 1 do
too much heavy housework, I have a
spell with my back. When I am that
way, dizzy nervous spells come over

WAS ON TRIAL
The case of the State vs. Manuel
Alverado, charged with the murder of
.lose Padllla in this city on October
11th last, was on trial yesterday be
fore the superior court The prose
cution was sort of up against it to
make out a case so that they could
get betY.re the jury some admissions
that the defendant had made. In the
first place the only eye witness to the
idlejM'd murder was Florencio Vas
quez, and he was killed in the explo
sion on Sacramento Hill on January
4th. Two Mexican women who lived
Pbout eit;ht feet from the scene of
;he killing end who heard the two
fighting rnd secured statements from
'he dyins man, were denor'ed to
Mexico socn after the' killing. Th
watchman at the Junctidh mine where
Alverado was arrested had left and
gon? to parts unknown. Alverado
was pointed out to him by Vasquez
as t!;e AKerarto was trying 'o set
his time so as to escape. Under these
circumstances the prosecution, how
t'"er, ma;!-? out a fairly good case. The
evidence was concluded last evenine
and the ense will be argued to the
i-irv tills morning. John Sanders of
tliis city represented the defendant

RAISE AND RETAINED
In appr'-ciation of the work of Dr
R. li. Yon KleinSmid. ps president of
the University of Arirma, the board
of regents !t its meeting yesterday
afternoon, in Tucson, signed a eon
tract with him for another year with
rn increase of salary of $1,500 a year.
This was the most that could al
lowed under the budget system and
provide for increases generally for the
tarulty. n number of wliom recived
Increases of from $150 to $."00 a year.
There were no important changes
in the faculty.
One of the important de'i.sions of
the board of regents was tre reten
tion of the faculty of the D?af and
Dumb school and an experimental at
tempt to operate the school as a 12
months' institution. Under the pres
ent system the school is open nine
loonths of the year. Mnst of the stu
dents belong to poor and Incompetent
fronts, ith the result that when
they have been returned to their
homes for several months a year the
rood work done in the n'tie months is
! retlv counteracted.
.There is little money at the disposal
of the regents, but it was decided ti
maintain the school as a 12 months'
institution for half a dozen pupils and
next year no to the legislature for an
appropriation to cover the cost of 12
months work, when all the pupils will
be retained.
A radical change in policy in re
gard to county agents was adopt? 1.
The county assents now operate cars
ownsd by the university. The cars
will be sold to the county agents at
their present valuation and thereafter
county agents will be paid mileage
on the use of the cars. An rgent
with a Ford car will receive 8 cent
a mile and owners of larger oar wil'
receive up to 10 cents a mile. There
are about a dozen such cars.
Owing to the faulting of the cement
stone in the construction oflhe aeri
cultural building, the mining anl en
gineering building will be finished in
terra cotta. upon recommendation r
the supervising eneineer, J. II. Lyman.
The original specification coiled for
cement s.tone and the change carried
with an appropriation of an addl
ticnal $15,000 over the original $15,000
estimate.
The suggestions cf Engineer Cu!rorJ
of the jtnte institutions commission
to the board of recent s and to Chair
man Leroy Ladd of th? commission,
upon the construction of the dormi
tory for girls, was sent to the Mard
by Chairman Ijjdd with his en iorse
nient. In his communication Mr. Ladd
asked that two members of the board
he selected It act as the jury en the
plans for the new building. Mrs
White and Mrs. Roberts were accord
ingly selected.

True Americanism j
And now the boches claim they gave
our American troops in the Toul sector a
bad mauling Saturday and Sunday. Maybe
they did. The American government has
not yet denied the German boasts of pris
oners and guns taken and losses inflicted.
But, anyway, the Germans, after taking
Seicheprey village, had to give it up again.
They gained, alright, but they relinquished
their gains. They used picked troops for
this assault, and a long and careful artil
lery preparation. Outnumbering the
Americans at the beginning, they forced
them back. But even Berlin admits there
was hard fighting at this point, and Paris
claims that Americans made a most gallant
and stubborn defense. Our losses were at
least two hundred, and the Germans suf
fered much heavy losses. Granting the
German claims, we have nothing to be
ashamed of in regard to the showing of our
boys in the first hard battle at the front.
These "untrained soldiers," as the Germans
contemptuously refer still to our boys,
fought the kaiser's storm troops to a stand
still, and, when driven from Seicheprey.
promptly organized a counter attack and
drove the boches back to their own lines.
It may well be, as Berlin claims, a "great
German victory," but for our party, we
hope that there will be more of the same.
May our boys always fight a3 well as they
did on that Toul line the other day.
While no definite information is avail
able, nor is there likely to be, yet it is pretty
well understood that for the past month
we have been speeding up" our troop move
ment to France to a degree that would have
been thought impossible a short time ago.
In fact, all American war preparations are
going forward at a satisfactory rate except
the airplane program. This still lags sadly.
It is even more scandalous than our ma
chine gun and rifle fizzle the first six
months of war. It is declared that Henry
Ford, who came to the rescue of the sub
marine chaser program, will be given con
trol of the airplane program. Good!
Henry's record indicates that he is the man
for the job. ' Our airplane program seems
to have had too many heads. Discussion
of details is sickening. Let us hope for a
brighter future.
Charging that the Democratic party of
Arizona is controlled by a clique that is
friendly both openly and secretly with the
I. W. W. organization, the Republicans of
the state, with Will H. Hays, national com
mittee chairman, as "their guest of honor,
opened the 1918 campaign last Saturday
in Phoenix. The party went on record
against the wobblies and their radical meth
ods as a menace against Jthe good and prog
ress and prosperity of the state and a handi
cap upon the active prosecution of the war.
Americanism was the keynote of the Re
publican rally and it was announced a3 the
slogan of the coming campaign. It is con
fidentially expected that Tom Campbell
will again carry the flag for the party upon
a platform dedicated to speeding up the
government war program to the uttermost
and an uncompromising fight upon the agi
tators and objectors and pacifists and pas
sive and active traitors to the American
cause. The Republicans argue that there
can be no half way measures in this fearful
struggle for mankind. He who is not for
us is against us, was the logic that directed
the methods proposed for their campaign.
Their stand against wobblyism was strictly
American. Will the Democratic party of
Arizona take the same pronounced and em
phatic stand, and live up to it, and make the
state believe the party really means it ?
In figuring up just how much or how
little you have done to help the third Lib
erty Loan drive, consider the Chinamen of
Tucson. There are not so many of the
Mongolians in the Old Pueblo city, but they
got together and subscribed for ten thou
sand dollars of the bonds. We are prone
to laugh and sneer at John Chinamen and
what we regard as his queer ways and fool
ish manner, but there is nothing the matter
with John when it comes to helping his
Uncle Sam in the hour of a great crisis.
Another good word from Tucson is to the
effect that U. S. Senator Mark Smith,
whose home is in that city, has subscribed
one thousand dollars for the third loan.
"We have to win this war," wrote Senator
Smith to a Tucson friend to whom he sent
his subscription, "or we will have nothing
worth living for in our own country."
. WHERE TALK CAN HELP
(From Life)
Senator Johnson of California a;ked
Senator New if the latter, as a member of
the military affairs committee, could tell the
aircraft program up to to July 1 of this year.
"I think, while I had not intended to
mention it, it is fair and just to say," re
plied Mr. New, "that the original program
called for delivering in France twelve thou
sand combat planes by the first of next
July."
"Then I ask the senator, ' urged Mr.
Johnson, "if he can answer, if it violates no
confidence, how many were delivered, or
how many will this government deliver on
the first day of July in France?"
"Thirty-seven," replied Senator New.
A gasp ran through the galleries.
Not only through the galleriers, but
through the whole country.
If criticism a'nd exposure can help to
remedy the situation it is the duty of every
patriot to raise his voice.
Cochise county still holds her proud lead
in assessed valuation of all property, real
and personal, according to the returns made
by the state tax commission, her total being
slightly over 1 5 1 millions of dollars. Gila
county comes next with $142,000,000.
Maricopa county, including the Great Salt
River valley and the capital city only shows
a taxable valuation of $80,000,000. Co
chise ccunty shows an increase of $1,132,
418.40. Maricopa county shows slightly
more increase than Cochise. Gila county
showed an increase of more than four mil
lion, accounted for mostly in the mine as
sessment. The assessment roll shows a con
tinued healthy growth of the state.
The favorite outdoor sport of Hunt fol
lowers who are candidates for the Demo
cratic nomination for governor, these days,
is to declare that, in the event of their nom
ination and election, they would go into of
fice without any strings attached. They
speak too often and too loudly on this sub
ject to be sincere. So far only one Demo
crat with any chance to win has entered
the contest absolutely free from the dan
gerous and demoralizing influence of the
Hunt brand of politics, and that man is
Moer.
Those 6200 swivel-chair officers hold
ing clerical positions in Washington, who
are doing work that could be accomplished
by women, ought to "be sent to the front.
The appointment of a young man to such
positions through "pull" is not calculated
to increase the spirit of patriotism among
the common folks who are willing to fight
and die for their. country.
'Referring to the candidacy of Senator
Roberts of Cochise county for governor,
the Douglas International says: "He would
probably receive a substantial majority of
what is known as the Hunt Democratic fac
tion in the state, regardless of who his op
ponents might be in the primary. Roberts
has been faithful to Hunt for seven years."
Those Canadians are game to the
heart's core. Reuter's news agency cor
respondent, with the Canadian armies to
the north, telegraphs-to Ottawa the fol-"
lowing brief, brimful, burning story of the
great battle: " 'Look at the map,' say the
Germans; 'look at the casualty lists,' say
the British.''
"Buy bonds and take the 'helm' out of
Wilhelm," urges the New York Times in a
black headline across the front page.
Pictures of Hindenburg indicate that
not all Germans are yet on the verc cf
starvation.
We have biblical authority for the food
economy program, as indeed we have for
most good and worthy things of the world
and the affairs of mankind. Listen: "If
meat cause my brother to offend, I will eat
no meat while the world standeth." Patri
otic Americans are now saying, "If wheat
is necessary to perpetuate all I hold dear, I ,
will eat no wheat until these things are se
cured and guaranteed."
REPUBLICANS GO
ON RECORD AGAINST
I. W. W. IN STATE
Tucson Citizen: The keynote of the
fall campaign in Arizona was sounded
and the issues clearly drawn at the
Republican conference in Phoenix on
Saturday on the occasion of the visit
of Chairman Will H. Hays of tho Re
publican national committee.
The Republican campaign will be
made on behalf of a candidate who
stands by the government, for Ameri
canism, and the winning of the war
and there will be no truckling to I.
W. W.'s and traitors. This wis the
statement of Allan B. Jaynes. Repub
lican national committeeman on open
ing the conference and the same senti
ment was expressed by Chairman
Hays, E. S. Clark, permanent chair
man of the conference and other
speakrrs.
Gov. Campbell, who is in charge
appearing for the government against
the I. W. W. and Chairman Maddock,
now an officer of engineers with the
American Expeditionary force express
ing similar sentiments:
Governor Campbell's telegr'a'n was
as follows:
"Yours of the 16th received here. I
wish to express deepest regret be
cause of my inability to be with you
tomorrow and meet Chairman Hays
and my Arizona Republican trends.
My heart is with you all, and when l'
tell you I am delayed here because
( f necessary presence with assisting
t!i government in the prosecution of
its enemies, the I. Y. V.. vou will
agree that my personal desires must j
not be considered. Give my most sin
cere regards and best wishes to all
of my loyal friends. Forever am I
their debtor.
"THOMAS E. CAMPBELL."
Mr. Maddock's telegram follows;
"I know Arizona Republicans will
continue to back the government in
the war, no matter what is done or
said. Jhis obliteration of party lines
should not extend to the American
Bolshevik! candidates who strive to
create classes in America, who Ignor
antly expound government theories,
tried and found to be wanting ages
ago, and those whose private and pub
lic lives are not above reproach.
These, in a temperate and law-desiring
state, should be defeated.
"Because the Democratic party of
Ar'.zom is controlled ;by a radical
cliniie that is friendly, both openly
and secretly, with the I. W. W. organ
ization, it will te necessary for the
Republicans of Arizona to initiate any
successful opposition and to refuse to
nominate or - support any candidate
not splendidly fitted for office.
M inost certainly wish you suc
cess in the coming campaign, for I
am of the opinion, based on rather
in intimate l:nowlyJge cf existing1
conditions, that the elimination from
control of the public offices in Amer
ica of every man of I. W. W. i:soci
ations depends the handing to our chil
dren of the free government of lib
erty, but not license, inherited from
our fathers.
THOMAS MADDOCK."
Most of the Tucson party attending
the conference accompanied Mr. Hays
ns far as Tucson. Among the Tutson
ians present were Allan B. Jaynes,
John B. Wright, George Gray, H. K.
Buehman, J. G. Compton, Mr. and Mrs.

BY RECRUITING MAN
Corporal Fred. A. Murphy, army re
rruiting officer for Arizona, nrrived

of stimulating enlistments in nu
merous branches ot the army service
ior duty in France. Man between the

sired are the Coast artillery branch,
field artillery, cavalry, infantry, ijuar
tt rmaster's corps, signal corps, med
ical carps and engineering corps.
The cavalry branch of service has
beeu dosed for some time and was
reopened last Friday. Thre should
be numerous men in this vicinity who
are expert riders and who would be
of real service to the country' 'n the
cavalry.
Men for the engineering corps are
also greatly desired as this branch
includes a varied line of grades in
cluding miners. Corporal Murphy
hopes lo '-nlist a large number of
miners for this organization. These
men will be sent to Camp Meade,
Maryland, for service in the 27th en
gineers. Other men enlisted here will be

That the county attorney's office of
.Maricopa county is entirely justified
in the employment of Thiel detective
to run down bootleggers and other
violators of the prohibition laws will
be the argument of It- M. Laney, the
prosecuting officer of Maricopa. Laney
declares that the income from flues
a-ainst bootleggers and the work they
will perform on the county roads more
t!uin makes up for the costs of the
detecties. Ianey said, in discussing
the prohibition problem, that stores
could sell flavoring extracts to house
wives, restaurants and others whu
were known to be using the compound
for cooking purposes. Sale for a bev
erage, however, is prohibited.
The Cochi.-e Stronghold tan..s are
at last to get in touch with the out
side world through the medium of a
telephone sysu in. At iwo meetings
held in the past week, a company was
formed with twenty four charter mem
bers, and a line is to be b':ilt in the
near future connecting the Stronghold
with both Cochise and Pearce. Poles
and wire have been purchased and con
struction will commence soon, the
main line being about twenty nines in
length with several miles of side lines,
giving practically every family in the
community a telephone.

Tery constipated. I had sour stomach
and was so uncomfortable. I went to
the doctor.
They weakened me and seemed to
tear up my digestion. They would
gripe me and afterwards It seemed.
I was more constipated than before.

needed. It was an easy laxative, and
not bad to swallow. My digestion soon
Improved. I got well of the sour stom

no more griping, and I would take a
dose now and then, and was in good
shape.
I cannot say too' much for Black
Draught for it is the finest laxative
one can use."
Thedford's Black-Draught has for
many years been found of great value
in the treatment of stomach, liver and

and reliable in Its action, leaving no
bad after-effects, it has won the praise
of thousands of people who have used

PRINGESS PAT SHOW
AT ORPHEUM TODAY
Of all fie musical offerings pre
sented within the last few years, none
have attracted more attention or re
reiced warmer praise than has the
Cort Theater. New York, production
of the Victor Herbert, Henry Blossom
musical comedy, "The Princess Pat."
which comes to the Orpheum Theater
for 2 nights, beginning on Friday,
April 26. The reason for this, it is
said, lies in the fact that Victor Her
bert has fairly excelled himself in
the tunefulness and variety displayed
in the twenty numbers he has given
to the play, while combined with the
-exceptional score is Henry Blossom's
book that is humorous and interest
ing and has a well sustained plot. As
sociated with this powerful eombina
tion in the staging of "The Princess
Pat" was Mr. Fred G. Latham than
whom are none competent in directing
stage presentations of this particular
line of productins. I riefly told the
story of fie play has to do with the
Trincess di Montaldo Pat(. an Irish
girl who is the wife of an Italian
nobleman and who i;s visiting her
chum, Grace Holbroo'k, at the home
of her uncle. Among other visitors
is Anthony O'P.rien, a wealthy man
who hopes to climb the social ladder
throueh a marriage with Grace. To
this Grace agrees solely to aid her
uncle out of .Ms financial difiiculiics,
but Pat docs not believe in such a
sacrifice and partly to bre.-.k off the
engagement and with s'll ( nother
purpose in view she resorts to a lit
tle affair with O'Brien.
Her second reason for engaging in
a flirtation was, if possible, to arouse
in her titled spouse a return to the
ardent love-making that was. mnch
I to Pat's liking, so marked in the early
i days of their marriage. That t,he
i course she pursues is entirely suc
cessful in both her own case and that
I of Grace follows naturally. A few
I of the srore cf numbers that show
j Mr. Herbert at his latest and best are
! "I Wish I was an Island in an Ocean
of Cirls," "All For You," "Two Laugh
j ing Irish Eyes." "Flirting," "Neapolitan
I Love Song," "In a Little World for
I Two," "Make Him Guess," and "Love
i Is Best of All." Among the important
! members of the. cast are: Annette
i Ford, Stefi Anderson, Francie Scho
i field. Nelson Riley, Edwin Stanley, Pe
ter MacArthur, Wilbux Cox. Augustus
Buell, John Reinhard. A large chorus
of real singers under the direction ot
II. H. Hamilton complete an organi
zation second to none on the road this
season.

cessful home-talent plays Bisbee has
ever witnessed. If last night's rehears
al is a fair criterion.
The play was written by Bronson
Howard and it is a sociological prob
lem of great interest and is sum to
please. j
The Bisbee hig)T school alumni as
sociation Is presenting the play for
lh benefit of the loan fund. This
fund is maintained for the purpose
of sending it's members to college
and normal schools. When they are
not otherwise able to procure a high
er education. Everyone is ur?ed to
help this worthy cause as the gov
ernment urges that we assist the ed
ucation of our boys and girls, when
so much is going to depend upon our
future generation.
In the past this fund has assisted
six members to go through Normal
schools and universities, who would
otherwise have been compelled to be
satisfied with a high school educa
tion. Three members up:i complet
ing their course have- taught school
and paid in full. Including interest,
the money borrowed from this fund.
Three others are now making pay
ments as often as they are financially
able. Four members are at the pres
ent time supported in schools in our
own state, and are in need of more
money. In order to raise the amounts
needed to complete this course, to
make it of any value to them, it is
necessary for the association to raise
more money as the funds are low.
The alumni presents a play every
year, and in the past the plays have
not only been a success as far as
financial conditions are concerned, but
have afforded raal pleasure to the
public.
The cast is well selected, and since
all Bissbeeites are well aware of Mr.
Snider's ability as a director of plays,
a full house is expected.
PRIDE OF NEW YORK
FOX FEATURE TODAY
AT EAGLE PLAYHOUSE
George Walsh's new William Fox
picture. ''The Pride of Xew York," was
received with the enthusiasm it de
served last night at the Eagle theatre.
It will be shown again today.
George, as the son of a laborer,
does some mighty clever acting, both
in his everyday work and in the ranks
of the new army which he has joined
to fight against Germany. He shows
his capabilities and his worth and the
contrast of this red-blooded American
and the son of a rich man is very
striking and has an interest for both
rich and poor.
The judge of the worth of George
and the rich man's son is a pretty
girl who was originally the friend of
the rich man's son. But she takes
the son who is doing something worth
while and leaves the spendthrift son
alone. However this helps rather than
hurt's the rich man's son because be
learns a lesson and becomes indus
trious himself.
The action of the picture is of the
usual swifeness of Geiirge Walsh's
pictures and the stunts out-Walsh
Walsh. The battle scenes are among
the best ever staged by R. A. Walsh
who directed the picture.

The t?se of Sage Tea and Sulphur
for restoring faded, gray haid to its,
natural color dates back to grand,
mother's time. She used it to 'keepi
her hair beautifully dark, glossy and
attractive. Whenever her hair took
on that dull, faded or streaked ap
pearance, this simple mature was ap
plied with wonderful effect.
But brewing at home is mussy and
out-of-date. Nowadays, by asking at
any drug store for a bottle of
"Wyeth's Saga and Sulphur Com
pound," you will get this famous old
preparation, improved by the addi
tion of other ingredients, which can
be depended 'upon to restore natural
color and beauty to the hair.

HARDLY ABLE TO
GROSSTHE ROOM
Thought She'd Never Be Well
Again Tanlac Restores
Health and She Has
Gained 35 Pounds.
Here is the story of a frail little
woman who knew only pain and viiu-r-ing
tor years, whose physical ailments
had pulled her down until she was
scarcely more than a frame, new a
strong, htalthy, happy woauin It is
the story of -Mrs. Bertha Sowell, wife
of T. Sowell. formerly of Paris,
Texas, anu now residing at 425,j
Broadway, Fort Worth. Mr. Sowells
statement, which she gives for the
benefit of others, is as follows:
"I have suffered, like women often
do, for a long time. 1 felt tired and
worn-out and was so weak I could
hardly walk across the hall. My ap
petite was very poor and I seldom got
a good night's sleep. I became fright
fully nervous and kept getting weaker
and mora hopeless all tne time. I fell
off until I weighed ouly igny i o .i.Js
and had o many aches anil pains lb it
I could hardly get up and down. At
times I was so discouraged and blue
that I felt I could never get well. Fin
ally I went to the hospital and under
went a serious operation. So after a
time I seemed to be in a convalescing
condition and was carried home and
put to bed, but made little or no im
provement. "Witn the good things I had heard
about Tanlac still in mind, I sent for
a bottle and while taking it I noticed
a considerable improvement in my eru
dition. My appetite came back, my
stomach felt better and from thc.i. on
I could eat anything I wanted and
enjoy it. 1 kept getting gradiu lly
stronger, my nerves became more calm
and after taking my second bottle I
began picking up in weight and .ccl
ing more like myself. I have taken
five bottles now,- have reined tbiriy
five pounds and am feelin.; fine. I m
eating just anything I want, sl-;e) like
a child and am able to do zl ci house,
work. Fverybody says I ljct Jihe a
new woman and I certain'.y Ue feel
like one, too. Tanlac is tne grandest
medicine I have ever hen-l of. It
has been a Godsend to me and I f . el
like I ought to tell others about it."

FEWER TO ADDRESS
MINING GLASS CLUS
Bert Fenner, shift boss for the Cop
per Queen, will give a talk at the
mining class sessions tomorrow after
noon and evening at 1:30 and 7
o'clock. The subject of his lecture
will be 'Timbering, Heavy Drift."
Next week Miles Merill, miner for
the Copper Queen, will talk on "Tim
bernig Repairs," and another inter
esting lecture is expected.
The mining class has been growing
by leaps and bounds. No admission
is charged and all miners and others
in the district interested in mining
are made welcome at the sessions
each Thursday afternoon and evening.
The object is to increase the effici
ency of the men working in the mines
and thus assist them to promotion
with higher wages. The classes have
also had the good effect of decreas
ing accidents to a surprising degree.
The average attendance the past sev
eral weeks has been between 150 ant
200 with a steady increase cadi week.

A MISTAKE.
I Some people labor un ler the im
pression that the third J.ihetiy loan
' bonds are hoi negotiable. Thi. is
due to the fact that they .'nftt.se the
word "lion-eopvertilile" with "ncgoli
joble." "Non-convertible" me-;is that
they cannot be exchanged for '.onds
! of a future issue, but they ate ne
gotiable the same as any oilier ne
gotiable instrument.

quired for the coming year, as well
as the quantity consumed during the
past yen; and the quantity desired for

hand must also be given, number of
I rooms to be heated and kind of build
ling, kind of heating plant. The state

jWAS ARRESTED.
According to advices reecived here
j Constable Lafn Gibson, at Gleeson,
was placed under arrest at that place
Ion Saturday night by representatives
of the sheriff's office on a charge or
I embezzlement. It is charged that the
I money was embezzled from a man
j named Brown. Gibson was released
,on a $"00 cash bond. According to
the storvl reaching here Gibson is
said to have circulated a subscription
list for the benefit of Brown just
affr the latters house and contents
had been consumed by fire. Brown
was. at work on the county roads el
the time. It is now claimel that
Gibson collected in the neighborhood
of $200 on the list and then appropri
ated the same to his own use, claim
ing that Brown was Indebted to him
in the amount of nearly $S0i. The
case is to come for trial later.
DON'T GET IMPATIENT.
The Douglas papers are now very
anxious that the County Highway
co:nmi-sion get busy and start work
on the paved road between here and
that ci'y. They seem to be still laboring-
under the delusion that all of the
$500,000 that was secured from the
sale of half of the bonds is to be put
into that road. They will now pet a
little of their own medicine, or in
other words their chickens have come
home to roost. The purity squad of
that city has endeavored to stop the
read work in Cochise 'county by kick
ing against the bootleggers getting
extra time for working and now others
have stepped in and there is a doubt
that work will be started on the paved
road for sometime). The greed o'
Douglas has over reached and others
are now going to have a little say
about the road building in Cochise
county. When she realizes that the
other part of the county is entitled
to some consideration then she may
get her share.
JUNCTION BRIGGS TO
BATTLE G. & A. TODAY
The above is the baseball program
fcr tonight at Warren park. Yes, to
night is correct, for the contest will

team is managed by Bert Whaling.
Kitty Brashear and Tonneson will
do tho umpiring today. Brashear is
the real thing in the indicator han
dling line and his big league work in
Sunday's game made a decided hit.
He keeps Jlie players hustling and
makes the contests fast and further
more calls the. decisions right instead
of guessing at them, as do, so many
amateurs. Tonneson Nimpired In the

a capable official. The league of
