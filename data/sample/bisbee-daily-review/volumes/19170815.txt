"Let Us March, Fight, and Rebuild Together As Comrades,"
Is Message Brought By Japanese
2
Head of Nipponese Delegation
Says Slander, Intrigue and
Influence Will Only Help
Cement Relations.
(By Review Leased Wire)
A PACIFIC PORT. August 14. A
new day in which Japan and
.America "shall forget the mole
hills that have been exaggerated
into mountains to bar our good reUv
tions," and "march together, work to
gether, and fight together as com
rades," was proclaimed here tonight
by Viscount K. Ishii. ambassador-extraordinary
and plenipotentiary to the
United States.
Heading a special mission. Viscount
lshii, spoke for his government at a
dinner tend-ed him by this municipal
ity acting as host on behalf of the fed'
eral government, this state and the
resident citizens. Six hundred men of
all classes and occupations applauded
his utterances. The viscount was pre
sented by Gavin McNab, an attorney
sent from Washington to arrange the
reception of the mission, and was fur
ther welcomed by the governor of the
state and the mayor of the. city. He
said :
Viscount's Address.
"Words fail me when I undertake to
acknowledge the full measure of our
obligation to your city. Notwithstand
ing the lessons of tradition and the
generous foretaste of American hospi
tality we received at Honolulu, we are
overwhelmed.
"We are very proud because we
know that this royal welcogie you ex
tend to us springs from (he heart of
the .nation. ,
"We come to you at the dawning of
a new day. As individuals we have no
right to expect to find place at this
busy time of preparation. Butwe
come as the humble representatives of
the gracious soveTign of a friendly and
a loyal nation, and we say that we
know well that performance, not pro
fession; deeds, not words; sacrifices,
not selfiishness, are the requisites of
the hour.
"Our message is that In this day,
through its hours of shadow or of sun
shine, your purpose is our purpose,
jour road our road and your goal our
goal. It Is that American and Japan
will march together, work together and
fight together as comrades until the
end has been reached and the victory
won in the struggle which involves
our rights and our liberties.
'Quotes Lincoln.
" 'It Is for that and I take the lib
erty of using the words of your great
president, Abraham Lincoln 'In order
that each one of us may enjoy an open
field and a fair chance for our Indus
try, enterprise and intelligence that
the struggle must be maintained; that
we may not lose our birth-right the
right of humanity.'
"We are here to that in this tre
mendous struggle for those rights and
liberties, America and Japan are bound
together; that when the victory of the
allied forces is secure, American and
Japan should so live that your sons
and our sons will have a certainty of
good neighborhood; so live that no
word or deed of either can be looked
upon with suspicion; that venomous
gossip, hired slander, sinster intrigue
and influence, all of which we have
both been the victims, can in future
only serve to bring up closed togeth
er for mutual protection and for the
common welfare.
Must Guard Pacific.
"The Importance of such co-operation
was brought home to us particu
larly as we voyaged safely and pleas
antly across the Pacific ocean. We
must indeed have insurance of good
order in our neighborhood. We can
not either of us take risks. It becomes
the first duty of Japan and America
to guard the Pacific and to Insure safe,
continuous intercourse between Asia
and the United States, to see to it that
the ships of the ferooius pirates
whose crimes upon the high seas can
never be palliated, find no shelter in
the waters of our seas.

Chicago Trading
In Wheat Will
Stop Sept First
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CHICAGO, Aug. 14. In response
to a notice from Herbert C.
Hoover, food administrator, that
the government would undertake
purchase of wheat at interior ter
minals beginning September 1, the
directors of the board of trade
here voted today to discontinue all
transactions . in wheat for future
delivery after August 25, 1917.
Tiie action was taken in view of
the suggestion from Mr. Hoover
. that such . further transactions
would confuse rather than stabil
ize the price,
"On September 1, 1917, we pro
pose to undertake government
purchase of wheat at interior ter
minals, with a view to stabilizing
the price and to furnish sure mar-'
ket for all arrivals," the food ad
ministrator wrote,
"In these circumstances, I feel
you will agree that trading or quo
tations in wheat futures will no
longer serve their fundamental
purpose and that such transactions
will confuse rather than stabilize
the price.
"I therefore would be glad if
yon would take the necessary
steps to'suspend dealings and quo
tations In futures In wheat after
the above date."
The board of directors voted
that it was the patriotic duty of
the board to comply with the suggestion.
ADDITIONAL ISSUES
OF BONDS NECESSARY
TO MEET WAR COSTS
Secretary McAdoo Informs
Congressional Leaders That
Expenditures, of Nine Bil
lions More Must Be Made.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, August 14. Con
gressional leaders were informed by
Secretary McAdoo today that It would
be necessary for them to authorize at
this and 'the winter sessions of con
gress an additional $9,000,000,000 for
war expenditures. Including further
loans to the allies to June 20, 1918.
Five billions in bonds already have
been authorized and a $2,000,000,000
war tax bill is proceeding now in the
senate.
Within an hour the secretary had
conferred with Representative Kitch-
in, chairman of the ways and means
committee, plans were under way for
raising the money. A meeting of the
way and means committee was called
for August 25 and arrangements maae
for the house, now taking three day
recesses, to resume its regular meet
ings cn August 27.
Issuance of between $3,000,000,000
and $4,000,000,000 in bonds to meet
new allied loans and authorization of
an additional $500,000,000 in taxes to
be added to the bill before the senate,
probably will be proposed by the com
mittee and agreed to by the house. No
delay Is anticipated.
The plan la to have the remainder
of the $9,000,000,000 authorized at the
next session of congress, beginning in
December. Whether it will be raised
by bonds or additional taxation or in
what proportion of both, is undecided.
A Visitor at
I
HE summer is passing. Strikes, hot sunshine and storms are
behind us. Soon will come messengers announcing the entrance
of that mild, marvellous, much loved maiden. Miss Autumn.
Let us hold our heads up a little higher and smile a brave
greeting to this visitor.
Better spirits, better weather, better business, better everything.
Bisbee was never in better shape in all her existence to meet the
changing of the seasons with such hope and confidence as she is right
now.
Let us take our sickle and go forth and reap, for the harvest is at
hand. Our sowing, was it not good? Be of good courage, then, for
the fall will not fail of its reward.
A little more faith will not hurt us a bit right now. It is justified
by every sign and token of the times. What Bisbee really ought to
have is a Great Fall Festival. Her past is worthy of it and her future
justifies It.

SAN FRANCISCO, August 14.
Lawrence le Lacy, an employe of the

J. Harnedy, proprietor of a shoe store,
were arrested here ate today as lead
ers of an alleged plot to spirit Franz
Bopp, former German consul-general
here. andEckhard von Schack, vice
consul, fro mthe deiention camp at
Angel Island to a point in Mexico.
The men were trapped as the result
of a counter plot directed bw the gov
ernment. Last Friday, Patrick J. Far
rally, employed here in the immigra
tion service, was ostensibly arrested
on a complaint charging consipracy in
the planned escape1 of Bopp and von
Schack. This complaint was giveu
out for publication after Farrally was
taken into custody, but was never
filed. United States District Attorney
Preston, in furtherance of the govern
ment's scheme, brought Farrally be
fore United States Commissioner
Francis Krull in order that his bonds
might be arranged.

Farrally was told to obtain sureties,
and have them appear today to sign
the bonds. When the case was called
M. A. Greely and H. Warfleld appear
ed and announced their willingness to
go on Farrally's "bond." When ask
ed the names of the parties who inter
ested them in Farrally's case, the men
mentioned de Lacy and Harnedy. The
government previously had received
in formation from Farrally that he had
received an incriminating letter lrom
Harnedy on June 29, and on August 7,
received $100 from de Lacy, presum
ably, the government authorities state,
for his supposed efforts to liberate
Bopp and von Schack. Greely and
Warfield were then advised by Preston
that the "arrest" of Farrally was
schemed and effected by the govern
ment in order to bring the real lead
ers in the Bopp plot to light. He also
declared Farrally was not under arrest
at any time; that he subuit'eC to de
tention In the counyt joil here In or
der that the government's rlacs
might be furthered; that the com
plaint against him was a trap and as
a consequence no bonds were neces
sary. O'Connor Accused.
Subsequently the government au
thorities discovered, so Preston de
clares, that the whole matter of ar
ranging Farrally's bonds was discuss
ed and decided upon by Greely. War

ment agents a few days ago for plot
ting to c-hstruct :he selective draft.
O'Connor Is to come before Commis
sioner Krull for his preliminary hear
ing tomorrow.
After the arrest of de Lacy and Har
nedy, Farrally was released and re
turned to his home. He wil! be the
principal witness against the men
when they are put on trial. The ar
rested men would make no s'atement.
Preston characterized Farrally as
"the greatest little Irishman I evtr

him cordially for the part he took In

ROME, Aug. 1 4. Peace proposals made by Pope Benedict
have been delivered to all belligerent governments.
The pope's appeal proposes that there be no annex
ations and no indemnities except in special cases, such as Bel
gium and Serbia, the return to Germany of her colonies in
exchange for the occupied departments of France, freedom
of the seas, disarmament and the formation of a supreme court
of arbitration for the settlement of future international dis
putes. The peace proposals will be published here Thursday.
Peace Proposals Were Expected
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14. Pope Benedict's peace pro
posals were not unexpected to the United. States nor to any
of the entente allies. ' v
The possibility of a peace move was discussed with Brit
ish Foreign Minister Balfour and Vice Premier Viviani when
the British and French missions were in Washington, and it
was agreed that all allies, including the United States, should
refuse to discuss peace terms while Germany occupied the ter
ritories she had taken by force, and thereby avoid what the
allied statesmen considered a German trap.

State Laboratory Chief Is Here
. to Make Complete Investi-I
sation Into Puritv of the1
City' Water Supply.
Dr. R. B. Durfee, city bacteriologist,
Dr. C. H. Hunt, county physician. Miss
Jane Eider, bead 'of the state labora
tory, and V. H. Thorne. manager of
the Bisbee-Naco Water company, ap
peared before a special meeting of the
city council last evening to discuss the
wter situation.t A complete investi
gation of the entire situation will be
made in the next ten days.
Dr. Hunt, when asked to speak on
the water situation, said that though
the condition of the water was some
what better It still should receive more
attention. In this Dr. Durfee agreed,
adding his personal investigation of
the matter.
H. W. Thorne of the water company
stated that the B.-N. had asked the
state laboratory to make a complete
investigation into the water and that
Miss Eider was now in the Warren
district for that specific purp'ose. He
stated that two samples had been tax
es for the government and had been
sent to San Antonio and to Washing
ton. In each caSe, according to Thorne,
the government found no organisms in
the water.
On mot .On of Councilman Delbridge
It was decided to wait ten days and
at that time, if the water had not been
purified, to ask the Bisbee-Naco Water
company to Install a chlorinating
plant.
Last evening the council voted to re
ceive bids on several pieces of ma
chinery, necessary in the street de
partment They include one four-,
horsepower t'oad grades, one rooter
plow, one eight-foot concrete mixer,
and one two and a half ton truck.
It developed, during the meeting,
that the street department in cleaning
up the streets had already spent a
matter of $1360. The amount budgeted
for th coming year in this department
is only $2000. It can be seen that the
present work jn the streets of the city
and other probable work, which will
arise during the course of the year,
will cost the city far in excess of the
amount provided for.
- P. T. McRae of School hill appeared
' before the council and asked that some
piVvision be made to handle heavy
flows of water on the street where he
resides. The council will look into his
claim this evening, going to that part
of the city in a body.

JAMES BELL HURT
Copper Queen Miner Badly
Cut by Frank Lacy Affray
Originated Over Recent
Strike and Wobbly Troubles
James Bell, a miner in the employ
of the Copper Queeri company, was ser
iously Injured yesterday afternoon
when Frank Lacy, an automobile driv
er, stabbed him in the back two times.
Bell was taken to the Copper Queen
hospital and was resting easily last
evening. His wounds, though very
painful, are not thought fatal.
Bell, who enjoys an enviable reputa
tion in Bisbee, lives with his mother
opposite the Holbrook car stop on Naco
road. He had come off shift yester
day and was in the house when he
heard a knMck on the front door. He
went out and found Lacy there. The
latter asked him to come down to the
ground. Bell did so and soon the two
men were in an argument.
Bell grappled with Lacy and in some
manner the latter either got loose or
worked with his right hand free and
stabbed Bell twice in the back. One
of the wounds penetrated the right
lung. Bell, when he was cut .tried to
get hack into his mother's house, but
a man by the name of James Swope
came out on the porch and, according
to Bell, attempted to kick him in the
face. In the meantime Lacy had gone
into bis house, which adjoins that of
Bell, and secured a Winchester rifle.
Officers were called and Night Chief
KempiVm appeared in short order and
placed Lacy under arrest.
Wobbly troubles and strike talk ap
pear to be behind the cutting. The
Bell's and Lacy's live in adjoining
houses. During the strike and pre
vious to July 12 Mrs. Lacy is alleged
to have made disparaging remarks
about young Bell and his mother be
cause the son was working. Mrs. Bell,
last Friday, told Governor Campbell
about the neighborhood talk and it is
this that the cutting of yesterday
arose over.
SPEAKER OF TEXAS
HOUSE ON STAND III
. FERGUSON HEARING
(By Review Leased Wire.)
AUSTIN, Texas, Aug. 14. Speaker
F. C. Fuller was under cross examina
tion during practically all of today's
session of the investigation by the
house of representatives into charges
preferred against Governor James E.
Ferguson, locking to the governor's
impeachment. The investigation took
a fresh turn during Speaker Fuller's
cross examination when W. A. Hanger,
counsel for the governor, asked Ful
ler if it were not a fact that he was
pressed for money on July 6, the day
he received a $500 loan from Governor
Ferguson.
Fuller, on direct examination, had
testified be took this money to caitli
the governor, who, he said, had
brought pressure to bear to have Ful
ler support him in locating the West
Texas, Agriculture & Mechanical
college.
Fuller replied that he was not in
particular need of money on that date
and then Mr. Hanger demanded if it
was not true that E. C. Churchill, a
contractor of Fort Worth, was pressing
Fuller to pay back money loaned him
in 1915.
The speaker declared that this was
not the case. He said he had received
$2500 from Churchill, taking the mVmey
purely because of a pre-arranged plan
w ith County Judge William McMurray
of San Jacinto county, by which, he
said, they intended to drive "grafters'"
out and keep them from bidding on
contracts to build the courthouse. Tho
money all had been returned to

Richardson Returns from Y
SummerlSchool; Claims to Be
World Champ
GENERAL Secretary A. B.
Richardson, of the local Y.
SL C. A., returned yesterday
morning from a three-weeks
stay at the Y. M. C. A. summer
school at Estes Park, Colo. The
secretary was sunburned and
walked with a ratier doubtful
step. Indicating Uiat hiking and
horseback riding over the Rockies
were taking their toll in sore
joints and stiff muscles, but other
wise "the man behind the desk"
declared he felt fit as a fiddle.
More than 300 secretaries from
every part of the country attended
the Y summer school this year. A
greater part of the study was along
war lines and, at the conclusion of
the term, 83 secretaries were de
tailed to Y. M. C. A. work at the
various army cantonments now
under construction for the nation
al guard troops and draft army.
v On his return to Bisbee Secre
tary Richardson visited several
points of interest, among them
Pike's Peak and the "Wobbly
camp at Columbus. He was in
cidentally held up for eight hours
at Tucumcari, N. M., Sunday ev
24 Exemption
Rejected By
(Special to the Review)
TOMBSTONE. Aug. 14. The Co
chise county local exemption board at
4 o'evi'ock this afternoon completed the
tiresome and laborious task of passing
on some 461 claims of exemption in
Cochise county from service In the na
tional army under the selective draft
These exemptions were from those
passed as physically fit by the doctors
in the examination the first part of the
week , and were made out in affidavit
form as provided by the regulations. '
It was the duty, however, for the board

ADDRESS TYPOS TODAY

COLORADO SPRINGS. Co.o., Aug.;
14. Delegates from all. parts . of the
United States who are here attending
the sixty-third annual convention of'
the International Typographical union I
spent today visiting scenic points of
the region. Tomorrow morning the
business sessions will be resumed and i

marking the twenty -fifth anniversary
of the founding of the Union Printers'
Home, will be celebrated. Governor
Gunter, Mayor C. H. Thomas and offi
cials tr the L T. U. will deliver ad-"

Much business will be considered
before the close of the convention Sat
urday, including the proposed repeal
of the provision which permits a num
ber of but ten years' standing to be
placed on the pension roll at the age
of 70; a proposal to cancel the power
of local unions to make contracts and
give the same to a national committee.

every tenth year, when it would be
held in Colorado Springs, will be
brought before the convention, also a

ening, when a cloudburst, which
he believes was a second cousin
to the one that visited Bisbee,
made its presence known by spill
ing about two feet of water over
the city and holding up four
trains.
"It was a wonderful trip and I
learned many things which I think
will prove of assistance in Uie lo
cal Y. M. C. A. work." said Sec
retary Richardson last night. "But
I can truthfully say that I am glad
to be back in Bisbee again. I sure
was lonesome for the boys in the
local Y and if I ever get to be a
millionaire I am going to take ev
ery member here to Estes Park
and show him that, although I
m.iy be a little too heavy to turn
handsprings and hang by my toes
in the local gym, I am certainly a
wizard when it comes to being a
passenger on a horse over a rough
trail. I rode 3,456 miles, more or
less, one day and when I got out
of the saddle in the evening I took
back all the harsh things I had
ever said about a flivver. The
automobile is certainly a wonder
ful and useful invention."
Claims Are t .
County Board
to take each claim separately and go
into the acts as claimed and ascertain
if they were just If s"o. the claims
were allowed and exemption granted,
while if not the claimant was 'ordered
drafted. Again, according to a recent
finding by the board, all married men
were ordered exempted and out of the
total of 461 only 24 were passed as sub
ject to call to report
The board had a tiresome task go
ing through the mass 'of affidavits' and
forms, and when they completed their
labors this afternoon were tboroughly
exbausted, and the end is not yet for
which they do not receive one penny
compensation.
Only one case which aroused the ire
'of the board made its appearance,
when a certain rich man of the coun
ty asked that his sons be exempted,
giving no justifiable, reason. The son
is perfectly healthy and was passed
by the doctors and the board flat-foot-edly
refused to exempt hira, although
the case will be gone into thoroughly.
The b'oard has patriotically gone on
record that on no grounds will the sons
of rich men be allowed to be exempt
ed and let the poor man's sons be tak
en to the army.
Further, should this certain youth be
exempted through the "pull" of the
father's ru'oney, when investigation
shows that it was through this source,
the board members have stated that
they will absolutely refuse to serve
again. i
Following is the list of those who
claimed exemption, but woose claims
were rejected, and who are held as
drafted:

SUFF HEADQUARTERS
Washington Mob Tears Down
Banners Addressed to "Kai
ser Wilson" Police Re
serves Quell Rioting. j
( By Review Leased Wire.) j
WASHINGTON. August 14. A good- j
natured crowd of about 1,000 men and ;
women today bombarded the Woman's j
Party headquarters with eges and de-:
stroyed several banners addressed to,
I "Kaiser Wilson" after similar ban
; ners had been taken away from wo- -I
men who attempted to parade them in
front of the white house. i
The disturbance shifting from the !
white house gates to the womans' of- i
fice across I-aFayette Square and back 1
Egain as banner bearers constituted to i
appear, lasted more than two hours.
The police viewed it without interfer-j
ing until near the end when two ar-1
, rests were made.
! Jack Gottlieb, a Washington youth
. who climbed to a second-floor balcony
as the suffrageists headquarters and
tore an American flag from a pole
hanging over the railing, was held in
I $300 band and charged with desecra- j
j tion of the American flag. He said be 1
I removed the flag because it had no j
place on such a building. Louis Lawy-1
che, a government clerk taken into ;
custody in front of a white bouse gate
after tearing down one of the "Kaiser
Wilson" banners, was charged with
disorderly conduct.
The women went back to headquart
ers after their last banner was taken
from tnem, followed by a jeering crowd
which fell in line and carried bits of
the banners on canes and sticks. By
this time the police reserves from sev
eral nearby stations were on hand and
when the crowd found no more ban
ners were to be brought out, it quick
ly dispersed.
None ' of the .women was hurt, al
though a few stones were thrown at
the headquarters building and some of
the bearers struggled valiantly but un
successfully to regain their banners.
There was no organized mob and ac
tive participants were mostly young
men from nearby government depart
ments who seemed as much in getting
a bit of banner or a piece of pole as
trophies as in effacing the sentiments
they carried.

BISBEE
Under the above heading Will Spear, editor of the
Phoenix Republican, and a former well known and liked
Bisbee newspaper man, takes a humorous little shot at
his old home town, and at the same time pays It a fine
measure of praise. Spear, living as he does, within the
sacred precincts of the state capital, where to the eight
of him and the left of him, branch out lordly avenues and
to the front of him and behind extend the boulevards
for which Phoenix Is justly noted, just could not resirt
turning a pointed jest and a barbed satire at this em
battled cleft in the mountains where he once did dwelL
But the editor of the Review was himself once a
state capital newspaper man and looked down with pity
and scorn upon his brethren who dwelt upon the plains
and in the valleys of the less fortunate part of Kansas
than Topeka-on-the-Kaw. And be will bet a chunk ol
copper as big as Spear's prlntshop that this same Spear
gasped and sweltered in the tropic heat of Phoenix even
as be wrote that editorial about how we take the door
knobs off our houses to let the sprinkling cart pass. We
will wage further, even as Ben Hur wagered with Mes
sala the proud one of old Rome, that this same Spear
sighed then, and has sighed many times, for a breath of
the wonderful mountain air of Bisbee, and for a view
of the majestic sweep of the valley looking down from
the divide, and for the inspiration of these mountain
peaks, and for the throb and hum and brave spirit of
this grand little, tight little valley.
But be all that as it may. Spear knows Bisbee; knows
It well; he can write about its little peculiarities in the
way of topography and its natural assets of courage, con
fidence and copper as few are given to write. This is the
story he tells of us in a recent Issue of his Phoenix Re
publican: "Bisbee is the mots exclusive town In the state; the
most exclusive in the United States. To get into Bisbee
is a good deal like joining a lodge, and a peculiarly high
class lodge which does not seek membership but admit
with greater or less reluctance those worthy and wel!
qualified. This attitude of Bisbee is due to topographies'
conditions and not to aay lack of a spirit of hospitality
for there are no more hospitable people. We enjoy the
pleasure of an acquaintance with many of Bisbee's chic'
dwellers, so that we write of something of which we have
an Intimate knowledge.
"The spirit of the people of Bisbee is broader thar.
its streets and herein is the secret of Bisbee's exclusive
ness, its seemingly repellent attitude toward unsifted
humanity. Bisbee lacks room for the entertainment o'
an indiscriminate multitude.
"Bisbee lies in a large bowl-shaped depression in the
mountains and its few streets have been formed by in
credible labors, of the gulches which extend down from
the mountains or they have been carved over or alonr
the sides of the numerous interior elevations or ovei
them, and the houses, offices and hotels are perched pre
cariously along these thoroughfares, some of them alon?
mere by-paths where even the energy and ingenuity of
the Inhabitants have been unable to construct roads.
The sites of many, in fact, most of the larger buildings
and some of the residences have been secured by blastinr
away the sides of the mountainous rim of the bowl or by
blowing off the tops of the elevations within the bowl.
"It has been impossible to make room for all the thou
sands who congregate in Bisbee for business or labor, sn
that the bowl has overflowed and poured ouf a part of in
contents upon the open tni beautiful country about War
ren. '
"Man has made the most of the niggard gifts of na
ture to Bisbee. The thoroughfares have all been paved
at great and disregarded expense and a former noisome
stream which crept across the bottom of the bowl ha,
been converted into a trunk of an admirable sewer sys
tem. "The office and business buildings of Bisbee are sub
stantial and ornate. Everything there appears to have
been built to please and to stay. Whatever may be sain
of what man has done in Bisbee much more must be said
of man himself. The popultion of Bisbee is of a high
character.'; It includes a larger percentage of university
men than any other town In the country and also of men
who have started from the bottom to climb to the top.
"On account of the topographical features of Bisbee
to which we have alluded there is not much entertain
ment in Bisbee. That all takes place at Warren.
Brewery Gulch and Tombstone Canyon, the principal thor
oughfares, are so narrow that the doorknobs on both sides
of the streets bave to be removed when the sprinkling
carts pass and on occasions of civic parades. The side
walks are necessarily so narrow that two robust citizens
can pass only by one of them making a detour off the
curb.
"In these circumstances Bisbee proper cannot harbor
guests in large numbers. There is room in this workshop
only for workers. In this hive of Industry there is space
only for the honey producing members of the colony.
"We think these facts ought to be laid before the
country to remove an Impression which may have re
cently formed that Bisbee is a forbidding, un-American
stronghold, out of tune with the century. An uninformed
federal government, otherwise, casting Its eye over the
map, may discover that Bisbee, though ly'ng near the
boundary. Is yet within the United States by a dozen
miles or more, and may assert its jurisdiction."
COCHISE COUNTY AND THE DRAFT
The first call In Cochise county was for some thir
teen hundred men, and of these two hundred were secured
for service in the new nationalist army. There were 120
exempted for physical reasons and 661 who passed the
physical examination and yet seek exemption on the
grounds that they have dependents. Then there were
some 450 slackers who failed to report at all.
Not much of a showing for the first effort to secure
the 674 necessary to fill out the county's quota. Only
about fourteen per cent But at least half of those seek
ing exemption. If not more, will be drafted, so that will
add about three hundred to the list available from the
first call, making about five hundred in all. Then there
will be 164 to secure yet from the 447 slackers and the
1,200 of the second calL
May the Lord have mercy upon those who failed to
respond, for the Board will not. Neither will public opin
ion, friend or neighbor. As for the "exemptionlsts ," it is
bard to say.
In the old times one used to occasionally meet with
the lad who was "his widowed mother's sole support."
One meets him by the platoon, company and regiment
now, yea, by the army. There will be few cases in th:
coming session of th courts of wives suing for non-support.
The woods are full of men who are toiling in the
vineyard for wife and child.
Without a doubt there are many, many cases of those
seeking exemption who really are entitled to it in tb?
best meaning of that word as applied by the government
to the draft There are many who really ought not to
leave families behind. But there are more who are hiding
behind petticoats and seeking to take a slacker's advan
tage of the exemption clause of the draft.
It will not avail them, however. Every brand of
slacker must face the music, and also the funs. Either
that or go to jail. V
Cochise has over five hundred out of over eight hun
dred seeking exemption. That is not so very bad, com
pared with the north and east While our number of
447 men failing to report seems large, yet it must be
remembered that we have a large per cent of foreigners
in the county. Most of these slackers are foreign-born
and speaking or understanding English only with diffi
culty. We will not believe that one hundred of thera
ere American citizens.
Business is picking up In the district. All the mer
chants, big and little, feel it and are beginning to look
forward towards the fall business with faith and confidence.
There Is no holding back a city with a payroll of a
million a month. Just as well try to stop the east wind.
Bisbee is a chosen city. The district will never stop short
of the fifty thousand mark. Why should it? The busi
ness is here; the wealth, the courage, the climate, the con
fidence. There are rough places ill the road, of coursa.
What road to success was ever smooth and down hill all
the way? Get busy, folks, there is still time and oppor
tunity to get in on the ground floor and realize abundantly
upon your faith. Push! Dig! Build! Boost!
It may well be that the Russians disappoint the Kai
ser as often and as keenly as they disappoint the allies.
Just as the allies' hopes are aroused by a most success
ful Russian offensive they are dashed to the ground by
a Russian reverse or retreat or rout, or something worse.
And then. Just as the Kaiser begins to rub his hands with
satisfaction over the complete collapse of the Bear, the
brute turns on him and holds his legions at bay. Queer
beast. Not to be' trusted by his friends; not to be de
spised by his enemies. This column refuses absolutely
to make any more prophecies or predictions, or even
guesses, on what the Bear will do.
Germany has lost much already from the war, and
she will lose much mora. She has lost more than two
million men of the flower of her manhood. She has lost
billions in money. She has lost her colonies. She ha
lost most of her land trade and all of her commerce on
the high seas. Yes. and she has lost something else that
Is worth more than all these appalling losses put together
she has lost her moral assets as a nation. She has
lost the great name that her people have been cen
turies in building. She has lost the respect and confi
dence of the rest of Uie world. She has lost the most
precious thing that a people! live for the affection and
kindly regard and admiration of the other nations of the
earth. Henceforth, for many long years to come, she will
be known as the land of frightfulness. "The Land of
Broken Faith."'

COMRADESHIP
Comrades, tenting 'neath the sky.
Soldiers 'gainst a brutal foe,
Seeing splendid brothers die;
These the depths of friendship know.
We that live apart from strife,
Day by day in peaceful scenes,
Only think that in this life
We have learned what friendship
means.
They that wear our unifrrm.
March to share a common fate.
Stand together through the storm
Launched by cruel guns of hate,
Better know that you and I
Friendship's meaning to the end.
For they've seen their comrades die
Many times to save a friend.-
To their lips the same canteen
Very often they have pressed;
Well they know L'jw much can mean
Help to one who's sore distressed.
Sharing what they have to eat.
Sharing what they have to spend,
Soldiers in the battle heat
Know the value of a friend.
We may talk of friendships fine.
We may love the ones we own,
But a soldier of the line
Richer fellowship has known.
He has shared a brother's bread,
Serving there a ttmimon plan,
And has learned on fields of red
What a man will do for man.

SUBMARINES TO SEEK LOST
TREASURE AFTER WAF.
"One object of the company Ger
many is going to organize after the
war is to build submarines for pleas
ure trips and to search for treasure
lost during the war. The great ship
ping companies follow suit by buildin;
deep sea submarines. In which n
could sail without seasickness. These
ships travel on a cable laid under tht
sea and are worked by an electric cur
rent from the land. They journey a:
incredible speed, making the journc
from New York to Hamburg in 4o
hours.
It is found possible to build a sub
marine which sinks to a depth of mort
than a mile and from this sprang the
international company for raisin
ships sunk during the war. The wort
is an immense success and large sum:
of money are fade from the salvage
work. There also is huge profit to tak
ing passengers in these ships for trips
of exploration and sightseeing along
the bottom of the sea. Ships are fount
which had gone down centuries ag"J,
and one expedition recovers the treas
ure of a whole continent which was
sunk in the Spanish Armada. More
over, rich veins of coal and iron and
other minerals are discovered in tht
sea.
"Meanwhile wireless telegraphy is
perfected until it is possible to send
a current around the entire World. It
also is possible to supply airships with

passenger and parcel service without
patrol, with begins serving all import

SLACKERS ARRESTED

It is reported today that between 21
and 30 slackers have been disclosed in
the towns of Clarkdale and Cotton

failure to. register for the selective

This is considered a large percent
ase for these two towns. It Is said
also that two secret service men are

is little chance for a man who is not
exempt to escape the service of Uncle

-ife and lover, because of their im
atience at being separated for a

According to one of the weirdest
iocuments that have yet gone on rec

from their father.
It was understood that the three
were to be separated for a year, Mrs.
Henry and the children passing the
time at her former home in Califor

provide in any event. In view of the
circumstances In which she is leaving
she relieves Mr. E. W. Henry of any

the people of BenVn learn that they
have come back to wind up their af
fairs preparatory to returning to that
state to make their home. Mr. Etz has
leased a large ranch near Durango and
the family will live in that city. The
Etz family are pioneers of the Benson
section of the country, having Itx-ated
here more than 30 years ago. The son.
Will Etz. is one of the star athletes
of Arizona and It was through his ef
forts that Benson won third place in
the state track meet at Tueson Uni
versity Week last April. They tako
with them the best wishes of their
many friends. r

SECRETARY DANIELS
BITTERLY DENOUNCES
HEAD OF NAVY LEAGUE
Charge That Labor Interests
Are Hampering Investiga
tion of Mare Island Explo
sion Termed Slanderous.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. August 14 A state
ment issued today from the head
quarters of the Navy League, charging
that influence of labor interests was
hampering investigation ot the black
powder magazine explosion at the
Mare Island navy yard July 9 was fol
lowed tonight by a letter from Secre
tary Daniels to report that Colonel
Thompson, president of the navy
league, denouncing the statement as
false and slanderous and declaring
the best service Mr. Thompson and
other active officials of his organiza
tion can render the navy is to resign
at once.
In its statement the league said it
had reliable information that the ex
plosion, which killed five men and in
jured 31, was set off by a time fuse,
giving evidence of a criminal conspir
acy. The information was made pub
lic, it said, because it had been urged
that publicity was the only measure
that could force action.
Secretary Daniels, in a statement
made public with the letter to Colonel
Thompson, said a board appointed by
the commandant of the navy yard was
actively pursuing a full investigation
of the explosion; that it had been of
fered ample funds and the full re
sources of the government and had
not been hampered in any way by sup
plenemtal instructions from the navy
department It bad been current ru
mor, he added, that the magazine was
exploded by a maliciously placed time
fuse, and the department had refrain
ed from making any statement con
cerning it until it was in possession of
the full facts.
The Navy League is a civilian or
ganization formed some twelve years
ago to work up a bigger and better
navy. Among its members are many
retired naval officers, but no one on
the active list is connected with It.
Mr. Thompson, president for a num
ber of years, is a financier of promi
nence who was graduated at Annap
olis and attained the rank of Master
in the navy before resigning in 1S71.
Since Secretary Daniels took office
the) league has vigorously attacked
hi mand his policies.
GENERAL MURGUIA IS
TO BE REMOVED FROM
STATE OF CHIHUAHUA
(By Review Leased Wire.)
EL PASO, Aug. 14. It was official
ly announced here Tonight that eGn
eral Francisco Murguia, military com
mander at Chihuahua City, would go
to the state of Nogales to fight the
Zapata followers and that his brother,
General Jose Carlos Murguia and Gov
ernor Arnulfo GVmzalez of Chihuahua,
will accompany him.
Instead of General P. Elias Calles,
who was. first reported to have been
instituted as Murguia's successor, it
was said tonight that Cesario Castro,
a general of division, had been named
as commander at Chihuahua City.
Military reasons were given for the
change, but it has been known here
for two days that the transfer of the
Murguias and Gonzalez was a result of
their pro-German attitude and especial
ly because General Murguia brought
the German consul and other promi
nent Germans from Chihuahua City to
Juarez as bis guests recently.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, WEDNESDAY MORNING, AUGUST 15, 1917.
Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. August 14. The stock
market gave promise at the outset of
today's more active trading of continu
ing its irregular rise of the previous
session but reversed its course on ex
tensive selling prompted by the peace
proposals from Rome.
Additional reason for concern was
furnished by the gyrations of various
specialties trhder pool control.
War shares were steadily liquidated
after peace reports gained currency.
United States Steel fell to 1234 fin
ishing a slight fraction above its min
imum. Sugars yielded one to two
points with leathers and secondary
equipments. In general final prices
were only slightly over lowest quota
tions. Total sales 505.000 shares.
Liberty bends were again in demand,
the activity in the last issue at 99.96
par at which price they closed mak
ing up a considerable part of the en
larged dealings in that division.
Ttotal sales, par value, M.770,000.
United States bonds, old Issues,
were unchanged on calL
CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, August 14. Notwith
standing that, peace proposals led to
much selling today in the corn market
the rapid fading away of immediately
available supplies proved much more
than offset. As a result prices clos
ed nervous, corn to 1 cents net
higher at 115i for December and
11VA to 113 for May. Wheat
finished steady at unchanged figures
204 for September. Oats gained Vt,
cents to Vz cents to cents net, and
provisions varied from the same as
yesterday's close to 55 cents down
Wheat trading was at a complete
standstill the greater part of the ses
sion as far as futures were concern
ed. Appearances indicated that, In
accord with government policy all out
standing debts would be settled. Price
changes were too slight to have any
special significance.
Talk of export business at the sea
board tended to lift the day's market.
Corn strength was also a bullish in
fluence. Provisions broke sharply, despite an
advance in hog quotations.

NEW YORK, August 14. Peace pro
posals said to have come from the
Pope caused a sharp break in today's
market, especially in the industrial
6tockp which have profited by the war.
The railroad shares continue in
good demand and were strengthened
by a report that the car service com
mission had ordered immediate distri
bution of20,000 empty cars to the
South and Southwest to racilitato
prompt movement of grains, food, lum
ber and munitions.
The opinion is gaining ground that
the price fixing program of the gov
ernment in its entirety can have, noth
ing more than the effect of working
to the advantage of the railroads and
it seems reasonable to assume that a
broader demand for shares of this
type will be but a 'natural sequence.

SHERIFF WHEELER TO
ATTEND LEON SPRINGS
TRAINING GAMP SOON
Shediff Harry Wheeler, of this coun
ty, has not given up ihe attempt to
go into the service of his country. He
has been called to the training camp
of the officers' reserve at Leon
Springs, Texas. Sheriff Wheeler was
in the Presidio training camp but
failed in the required physical train
ing camp, notwithstanding the fact
that those who have known him tn
this county for so many years regard
ed him equal to many stronger looking
men when it comes to enduring hard
ships. Many hours at a time he has
been in the saddle or working an auto
mobile over all sorts of bad roads in
the discharge of his official duties,
days and nights without stop. While
the departure of Sheriff Wheelc-r
would be regretted generally through-
cut the county, still his friends would
bs glad to see him succeed in reaching
the goal of his ambition which is to
join the colors in the defense of his
country. Sheriff Wheeler has filled
the office of sheriff here for five year.
and has done so in a manner which
has won the highest praise and admi
ration for bis display of courage and
conscious devotion to duty. Before
he was sheriff he was captain bf the
Arizona rangers where he rendered
efficient service to the state. His ac
tion at Bisbee, where he had charge
of the deportation of the I. W. W. has
made Sheriff Wheeler a national char
acter. Good luck, sheriff, you will
carry with you wherever you go the
best wishes of the loyal citizens of
Cochise county. Douglas International.

Several of the Riggs, boys were

Hunsaker of this city was also pres
ent This land is sold at a minimum
price of $3 per acre on terms "of seven
per cent down and the balance in 38
yearly payments, the interest rate be
ing 6 per cent.
The land sold yesterday is located
in the Bowie and San Simon districts
of the county.
PLANS FOR RELIEVING
COAL SHORTAGE ARE
FORMED IN CAPITAL
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 14. Plans for
relieving the coal shortage in the
northwest by a system of preferential
shipments were formed today at the
conference of officials,, railroad men
and coal Operators and may ultimately
call on President Wilson for execu
tive approval to make them effective.
The plan adopted by unanimous res
olution contemplates furnishing bitum
inous coal operators who can ship IV
Cleveland and eastern lake ports 100
per cent car service with the under
standing that they will ship 50 per
cent of their output to lake ports for
re-shipment to northwestern territory
ports. Daniel C. Willard, chairman jf
the advisory commission of the council
of national defense, was delegates with
F. S. Peabody and C. M. Sheaffer as
aides to carry the plan to some auth
ority for final veto 'or approval. The
authority was not named, but inas
much as the power to order preferen
tial shipments now rests solely with
President Wilson it is assumed the
proposal will go to him unless he ap
points a preferential shipment board
to handle such problems.
Under the plan adopted Mr. Peabody
and other members of the conference
said the entire great northwestern prob
lem will be solved and the New .Eng
land situation improved, while other
sections of the tViuntry probably would
be adequately cared for rail transpor
tation.
Much of the session was devoted to
discussion by George Cameron, a mem
ber of the Peabody commission, and
George L. Peck, vice president of the
Pennsylvania Hues, over the right of
railroads to declare embargoes.
Mr. Peabody declared that he did
believe there was a car shortage, but
that the coal emergency was causd by
utilities storing in vast quantities 'of
coal. One utility, he said he had
heard, had a year's supply of coal in
storage.
(Continued From Page One)
statesmen realize that once considera
tion of any part of the pope's proposals
begins, pacifists and Socialist ele
ments are at once enabled t'j take up
discussions which will embarrass their
governments.
President's Views
President Wilson's own view of what
reply shall be made obviously cannot
be aecurrately assessed at the present
time. His latest public pronounce
ments on the most vital of the propos
als Pope Benedict makes are interest
ing, j
Vi'he nthe new. Russian g'Jvernmr-nt
wa wavering on the point of making !
a separate peace and declaring for no
annexations and no indemnities, the
president in a message to the Russian
peoplet, declared:
"Of course the imperial German gov
ernment and those whom it is using j
for their own undoing are seeking to j
'obtain pledges that the war will end
in the restoration of the status guo
ante. It was the status quo ante out
of. which this iniquitous war issued
forth; the power wielded by the im
perial German government within the
empire and its widespread domination
and influence outside that empire.
That status must be altered in such
fashion as to prevent any such hideous
thing frvm happening again."
Two days later in his Flag day ad
dress the president, referring to the
military masters of Germany, said:
Must Check Autocracy
"If they can secure peace now with
the immense advatnages still in their
hands which they have up to this point
apparently gained, they will have jus
tified themselves before the German
people: they will have gained by force
what they promised to gain by it; an
immense expansion of German power;
an immense enlargement of German
industrial and commercial 'opportuni
ties. Their prestige would be secure
and with their prestige the political
power."
In his war message to congress tne
president declared for spending the
force of the nation, if need be, to check
and nullify teh pretensions and power j
of the German military autocracy. Thisi
phrase, now universally accepted as
the war aim of the allies, the entente!
diplomats here contend, hardly fits in
with a restoration of the status quo'
before the war, a return of Germany's
colonies and no restitution for Bel-
gium . !
The one point on which Germany ;
might stick, diplomats feel, is the re
storation of Alsace-Lorraine. These
provinces, because of their mineral de
posits, are not only necessary to the
economic existence of Germany, they
say, but in the hands of France a gain
would constitute a military menace to
the whble world.
There are families who always aim;
to keep a bottle of Chamberlain's
Colic and Diarrhoea Remedy in the
house for use in case it is needed, and
Qnd that it is not only a good invest
ment but saves them no end of suffer-:
ing. As to its reliability, ask anyone
who has used it. Adv. J
