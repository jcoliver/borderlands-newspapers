WASHINGTON. March 7. Secre
tary Daniels and a party of American
naval experts will leave for Eurcpe
next week, to -discuss with Allied na
val officials the best type of capital
warships to be bnilt in the fa'.nre.
based on the lessons gained in the
war. Because of conflicting opinions
among American officers, the secre
tary has been asked to submit a defi
nite recommendation to the next
congress.
It was learned that Secretary Ba
ker would sail for Europe rbcut
April 1 to close cp the business ope
rations of the American , Expedition
ary Forces, He will be absent about
six weeks. Thus
President WUson .
and the heads of both the army and

The American mission will address
itself particularly to the question of
future types of capital ships. It has
been the judgment of the navy gen
eral board that the United Sttes
should continue to build dreadnaughts
of constantly Increasing power jnd
battle cruisers.
Composite Ships Favored
Admiral Mayo, now commander of
the Atlantic fleet; Vice ' Admiral
Sims, and Rear Admiral Benson, the
three officers who have . held the
highest posts of the American serv
ice in the war zone, believe, however,
that a composite ship, combining the
speed of a battle cruiser with the
gun power and armor of a battleship,
should be substituted. These offi
cers have been particularly Impressed
by British experiments toward a com
posite craft with the construction of
the Hood, one of the so-called Brit

Secretary Daniels was invited by
the British admiralty to visit Europe
during the war. but he was unable to
accept the invitation. Assistant Sec

Secretary Baker made two visits to
France during the war and had
planned a third one after, the sign

Wilson Opposes
Destruction of

WASHINGTON. March
7. President Wilson has
written Representative Ful
ler, of Massachusetts, that
he was opposed to the sink
ing of the surrendered Ger

judgment was not final as
he had not had the oppor
tunity to discuss the matter
with authoritative naval
men. This he would do, he
taid, when he returned to

The president's letter said
the proposal to destroy the

WASHINGTON, March 7. Charles
E-, Hughes, appearing before the su

The accusations by Mr. Hughes were
generally denied by solicitor General

Representative of Govern
ment of North on
Stand in Probe
WASHINGTON, March 7. G. A.
Martusaine,. who described himself as
a Russian peasant and at present the
official representative in this country
of the Russian government of the
North, told the Senate propaganda
committee today that the United
States and the Allies could aid Rus
sia only by helping to crush the bol
shevists. With Lenine and Trotzky
overthrown, he said, the masses of
people now ruled by terror would
themselves organize a real democrat
ic government.
The witness, who testified with the
aid of an interpreter, disagreed with
testimony presented by Raymond Rob
ins, former head of the American Red
Cross mission in Russia, that the
masses of the people in that country
favored the bolsheviki regime. Mr.
Martusaine told the committee that
since he was a Russian himself he
had a more intimate knowledge of
the desires of the Russian people
than Mr. Robins could possibly have
secured during the few months the
Red .Cross - official was in the coun
try. "I was a member .. of the original
constituent assembly which was dis
solved by force by the bolshevists
when they found only one-fourth of
the delegates held the same ideas as
they," said the witness. 1 know that
the masses in Russia will fight bol
shevism just as they fought czarism,
for the terror they are nnder now is
far greater than any they ever suf
fered under the old autocracy."
Mr. Martusaine said that in his
opinion both Lenine and Trotzky
were fanatics who believed in their
mission to destroy everybody not
aereeging with their ideas and to
overthrow all orderly governments.
Three elements assist the bolsheviki
leaders in continuing their grasp on
Russia, the witness said. . He gave
these as terrorism, false promises of
free land and other reforms favorable
to the peasants; and the constant in
creasing or their ranks by reaction
aries elements which -destroy reestab
li.shment of the monarcbr.

Chairman Hays Attacks Fed
eral Ownership at St.
Paul Meeting
(By Review Leased Wire)
ST. PAUL, Minn., Mar. 7. Will H.
Hays, chairman of the republican na
tional committee, reinforced by etate
leaders cf national note, formally op
ened the preliminary campaign for
the 1920 election in the twin cities to
day and tonight.
From the moment Hays arrived in
St. Paul, -shortly before noon, until
the northwest rally- at the St. Paul
auditorium was closed late tonight, he
was the leading figure in a series of
meetings and conferences, which
caused him to cross and re-cross tno
Mississippi. He talked straight poli
tics and vigorously argued for an ex
tra, session of congress in a luncheon
address in Minneapolis at noon. He
talked with prominent republicans
from Minnesota, North Dakota. South
Dakota and Montana in St. Paul and
Minneapolis, and he was whirled to
the state capitol late this afternoon,
where he poke before a joint session
of the state legislature. ,
"Hays Discusses Royalty -Mr.
HayS, United States Senator
Frank B. Kellogg and Gov. J. A. Burn
quist were the principal speakers at
discussed loyalty, reconstruction and
congress; Kellogg reviewed republican
achievements, assailed the non-par-tissan
league and George Creel chair
man of the committee on public infor
mation. "We have always said 'we join our
selves to ho party that does not follow
the flag and keep step to the music
of the Union,'" said Hays in his ad
dress tonight. "The republican party
has not only followed the flag and
kept step to the -music of the Union
the republican party has carried the
flag and made the music for the Un
ion. " -
'-We will not forget that while we
fight to make certain the rights of free
government in the world, we have a
republic to preserve in this country;
that we. are a representative govern
ment, not a tolsheviki syncopation ;
that while there is nothing in this
country that we would not take and
use for necessary war purposes, such
taking must be for war purposes only.
The republican party from its incep
tion has stood against undue federal
ization, of industries and activities.
There must be strong federal regula
tion, but not federal ownership.
Creel Articles Attacked
"Let us not for a moment lose sight
of our own supreme nationalism.
While we seek earnestly and prayer
fully fot methods lessening future
wars, and will go far indeed iu an
honest effort to that end. we will ac
cept no indefinite internationalization
as a substitute for the fervent Amer
ican nationalism." ... ."
Governor Eurnquist. said 4ie was es
pecially glad to iiave the opportunity
to assail "some recent misrepresenta
tions jnade by the chairman of the fed
eral committee on public information."
Governor Burnquist referred to an
article by George Creel, printed in the
March number of an eastern magazine.
"George Creel accuses the citizens
and officials of this state of persecut
ingH during the war, certain elements
of our people for political purposes,"
said the governor, and he referred to
statements in Creel's .article as "infa
mous allegations" and "malicious fab
rications." Discussing the league of nations, as
outlined by President Wilson, Senator
Kellogg said:
"I am willing and anxious to give
the league of nations a fair trial. But
I recognize, as all thoughtful men
must, that any league should properly
safeguard our political independence
and the continuance of our American
institutions and national rights."

NEW YORK, March 7. Huge mor
tars, standing on concrete emplace
ments and abundantlyi supplied with
half-ton projectiles, were erected dur
ing the war among the flowers ard
shrubbery of private gardens in New
York City and elsewhere along the
Atlantic coast, ready -to repel the at
tacks of German naval or aircraft,
Maximilian Toch, one of the liret
American camoufleurs, told the Amer
ican Chemical Society here tonight.
Mr. Toch described how honeysuckle,
iuorning glory and ivy. as well as
paints, had been employed to conceal
or lower the visibility of coast forti
fications. - ;
Ambrose Channel, the mouth of New
York harbor, was protected, in addi
tion to the guns in the regular anny
forts, by mortars having a range of 12
miles, said Mr. Toch. . Some of these
auxiliary cannon, he I declared, were
placed two and a half miles inland on
private estates and concealed by ar
rangement of trees, shrubbery and
flowers that passersby were ignorant
of their erection and even aviators
"found little or no evidence of their
locations. They Trere ; manned by
army gun crews, ready for instant ac
tion. - . : .
The camoufleur described also his
work in disguising navy yards and
docks along the Atlantic coast, near
the Pensacola and s Key West bas-js..
which were exposed to attacks by Ger
man raiders and submarines operating
iu the South Atlantic. The navy be
lieved, Mr. Toch- asserted., that the
Germans had a secret base -on the
north coast of Cuba, adding that
"rich German firms' in Havana were
notoriously aiding the Central Pow
ers," and that there-' were "more Ger

If the plan for a League of Nations can find no better champion than
that of Hon- Franklin D. Roosevelt, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, who
spoke in its behalf at a luncheon at Hotel Commodore, In New York City,
last Saturday, the whole scheme is certainly in. a bad way.
Answering the argument of those who declared the covenant would
bind the United States to take part In every Balkan squabble, Mr. Roose
velt's sole reply was that the League's representatives would haTe "a
certain amount of common sense," and would not ask the American
people to do anything they did not want toj do, and that was incon
sistent. .
We can understand that it is quite possible for a Washington
'bureaucrat to look with sincerity upon a League whose limitation of its
enormous power is the "common sense of its members, but there are
"a lot of "old fogies" in this country who still believe that this should
be a government of laws and not of men.
Regarding the allegation that the covenant was a direct violation
of the American Constitution, Mr. Roosevelt averred that the Consti
tution was a document "through which a team and horses can be
driven' on every page. In other words, he sees it as a mere "scrap of
paper!. '
At the same meeting a communication was read quoting the proposal
of the International Socialist Conference at Berne, that the League be
given lawmaking power, "thus making the League not a mere alliance
of Governments but a union of peoples."
All of which is certainly and truly, humiliating and depressing. It
is possible that a splendid cause may be defeated by stupid protagonists.
Exit the Carnival
Irresponsible, fly-by-night, hurdy-gurdy tent shows and carnivals will
no longer prey on the people of Cochise county. An order from the
board of supervisors to the sheriff has effectually ended their pay-day
careers in the county's camps. Hereafter they may reap their harvest
of nickles and dimes in other territory.
The Review has often spoken of the carnival. It has told the story
of. the itinerate tent show many times, has disclosed how they rush into
the Warren District the night before pay-day, how they open dozens of
near gambling games to take the money of the spendgr, how they spend
nothing in the district, how they sleep and eat and live in their concession
tents or on their cars, how they draw hundreds of people away from
legitimate and resident show houses, and how they are a financial drain
on the community. t
The Warren District and other cities and towns of CocHise county will
benefit materially through the order which prohibits carnivals. Pri
marily the benefit will be in dollars and cents kept at home. Secondarily
the benefit will come in keeping out of the county the undesirables
who follow carnivals, the jack-leg. gambler, the concession man, and the
hangers-on of the tent 6how train. Finally a moral benefit will come
with the barring of entertainment of such poor quality and doubted
merit as most road carnivals boast. '
The Review feels that the Board of Supervisors and the Sheriff have
accomplished a good and beneficial .work in issuing this order. -
Register and Vote
With but a few days left in which to register for the city paving
election, enrollment of qualified voters continues to lag and figures yes
terday disclosed that a very small part ot Bisbee property owners and
tax payers have prepared to vote. Every citizen within the city limits
whose name appeared on the last tax roli snouid register and vote.
.Each owes it to himself or herself and the community. '
First opposition to the band issue was reported yesterday, when it
was learned some taxpayers are objecting to the paving of Quarry
canyon because O. K. street, and Opera Drive are not included in the
proposed improvement. This objection is without material' foundation.
To assure the safety of Main street paving and property the Quarry
canyon improvement is absolutely necessary. But the greatest .argu
ment for paving Quarry canyon is in the future saving which the city
will effect. The total cost for this piece of work will be about ?12,000
Three good floods in the canyon will cost the city more than this for
maintenance and repairs if the section remains unpaved, and three
good floods, is a matter of less than three years waiting.
O. K. street and Opera Drive would have been included in the present
proposed paving plan but for two contingencies the additional cost
and the lack of time in the emergency which prompted the paving plan.
Undoubtedly, according to. members of the city administration, these
streets will receive improvement of material character soon after the
proposed improvements are completed. Present contemplated paving
must end somewhere, and the city government has included in present
plans only improvements which are absolutely necessary. Should the
Quarry canyon paving be omitted one flood from the canyon might
irreparlbly damage the Tombstone Canyon paving. To insure low main-,
tenance costs in future years the Quarry canyon improvement Is indis
pensable. Actual figures on the costs to the property owner show conclusively
that total costs of the paving will be low when considered In the light of
added valuatins resulting from the paving. The. absolute tosts on each
11.00 valuation the first year will be 32 cents. The final twentieth year
the absolute costs on the same' valuation will be 16 cents. The average
for the duration of the bonds will be 24 cents. In other words, the man -with
a city property of $1000 valuation will be taxed only ?4S as his
share of the proposed improvement, and will have 20 years in which to
pay. .
This actual cost, however, will be materially reduced in the lc-Dg ran
by reduction In city street maintenance costs. In the last city budget
$16,000 is included for maintenance of struts. After the first year with
iraved streets this figure will be sliced by at least one-half, representing
a saving of J8.OO0 yearly to the tax payers of Bisbee, and decreasing
by at least one-half the original and absolute costs of the paving. What
the tax payer saves In street maintenance tax will make almost negli
gible what he pays toward the paving when he considers bow greatly
the improvement will benefit his property and the city.
Only six more days remain in which to register. Remember that
it is each qualified citizen's duty to express his or her will in this elec
tion, to voice approval or disapproval of the paving bonds.' Go register!
Our guess Is that the president postponed calliDg that extra session
of congress because he knew It wouldn't work while he was in France
anyway.
The heaviest income tax is an automobile that has begun to develop
Hvmpioms.
The new that there are more than 70 secret treaties between Japan
and China, makes It a Kale bet that China hasn't anything left except
ber patiercc. .
Our elected statenien would make greater progress if the common
lrud.:ry of law-making earned them as much publicity as the common
folly of Kpeecu-uiaking.

PHOENIX. Ariz.. Mar. 7. Tomor
row afternoon in the senate chamber
promises to mark the opening of one
of the most stormy sessions of the
lourca legislature of Arizona. Then,
according to a resolution passed in th
senate today, senate bill 17. the high
way measure wnicn was vetoed yes
leruay Dy tne governor, will be
brought up again under a special or
der or ousinesa.
Friends and opponents of the mea
sure were backward today in Dwrfirt
lug what form possible action on the
veioea Dm would take, some snrrut.
ing that the emergency clause would
be removed and the proposed legisla-
uoa rusnea inrougn in that form. Oth
ers forecast amendments which miirhf
bridge the split between the governor
ana' tne majority In the legislature.
It was tacitly understood, however,
that leaders of the majority in the
senate would make a reply to the gov
ernor's exhaustive criticism ot the
highway bill contained in the message
which carried his veto.
The highway bill, with its two vear
appropriation of ? 3,00 0,000 for roads
and ?200,000 to match federal aid re
quirements, first broke the harmony
of the legislature on February 25
when the republicans charred the
democratic majority with attemntine
to force through a measure which was
purely partisan, likely to block road
building in the state, and particularly
designed to take from the governor
the powers delegated to him by the
constitution.
The main fight throughout has been
on the latter contention, which' is
uaaeu on ine Din s' provision lor a
board to name the state highway com
mission. This authority, the opponents
of the measure assert, should be left
in the hand3 of the chief executive,
acting with the approval of the senate.
They also oppose the proposed per
sonnel of the board named to include
the president of the senate and speak
er of the house.
In reply the democrats in severa
heated debates burled back at the mi
nority the charge that they were at
tempting to do anything new in taking
authority from the governor. They as
sert the same thing was done two and

NEW YORK, March 7. On a vol
ume of business exceeding any ses
sion of the year to date, the stock
market today resumed its advance in
almost every quarter of the list,
prices in the main holding at or near
the best, despite extensive realizing
for profits.
Brokers reported heavy buying lor
both accounts, but short covering
probably was the more important fac
tor, latest advices respecting railroad
and Industrial conditions causing de
moralization in the ranks of the
bears.
Steels, equipments and the varied
list of "peace" industrials gathered
furthermor momentum from Chair
man Gary's prophecy of large trade
prosperity.
United States steel made a new
high for the current movement, for
feiting a fraction of its extreme ad
vance of 196c; related shares gained,
but motors and oils were comparative
ly backward.
The only stock to manifest rela
tive heaviness was Kelly-Springfield
tire, which made an extreme decline
of 4 points in connection with the
proposed new stock issue. Total sales
amounted to 1,020,000 shares.
Bonds were strong; Liberty firsts
fours and local tractions scoring sub
stantial gains, and foreign issues also
rose, but the turn over was moderate.
Total sales, par value, aggregated $9.
750.000. Old United States bonds
were unchanged- on call.
DUN'S REPORT
NEW YORK, March 7. Dun's to
morrow will say:
Improvement in business, while still
very gradual and checkered, clearly
exists. That the sain is chiefly one
i btrengtuened confidence and more
cheerful sentiment is plainly manifest
and the better feeling may before
long find reflection in a more notice
able recovery of actual trading. Al
ready operations in certain branches
and sections are a little freer, and
though there is everywhere a. prudent
disinclination to act hastily, prepare
being neglected. The recent pro
gressive increase in number of new
enterprises and the contemplated ex
tensions of producing facilities are
significant of the disposition in some
quarters to anticipate commercial re
covery. But while the fact has been
demonstrated that business rests on
a solid foundation, complete transition
from the war basis must of neces
sity be tf somewhat protracted pro
cess and one accompanied by various
uncertainties tending to cause general
hesitancy.

nothing did ms any good or relieved me
until I took Cardui . '. .
I was not able to do any of my work
for one year and I got worse all the time,
was confined to my bed off and on. 1 got
10 bad with my back that when 1 stooped
down 1 was not able to straighten up
igain ... I decided I would try Cardui
. . . By time I had taken the entire bottle
I was feeling pretty good and could
straighten up and my pains were nearly
til gone. .
I shall always praise Cardui. I con
tinued taking it until I was strong and
well." If you suffer from pains due to
emale complaints, Cardui may be just
what you need. Thousands of women
who once suffered in this way now praise
Cardui for their present good health.

Arrangements for Launching
Baseball League in This
Section Progressing
Tips of the Town
Plans for the launching of a baseball
league for this part of the state, to
gether with the plans for the exhibi
tion game April 12 between a picked
team from thi9 district and the Chi
cago Cubs, are progressing rapidly-and
definite announcement of the details
of both league and exhibition will be
made within the next two weeks, ac
cording to baseball gossip yesterday.
Contract for the Cub game has already
been signed and arrangements for the
game have been advanced past pre
liminary stages.
Since April 12 falls on Saturday the
management of the exhibition is mak
ing arrangements wun tne mining
companies of the district to swing
back the change day from Sunday to
Saturday, permitting the miners to lay
off for the day of the game. It is an
ticipated that this arrangement will be
completed and that men of the district
will have the day free to attend the
game. At the same time arrange
ments are being made to permit office
men and employes of other concerns
to get time off to attend the contest.
League prospects improved yester
day when it was learned that Cananea
is seriously contemplating getting into
the circuit with a strong team, and
that Douglas is already getting to
gether the material for a nine In the
Smelter City. Within the next two
weeks If possible final details will be
worked out and a meeting of team
managers and fans from this district,
Cananea and Douglas will probably
be called for the final steps in for
mation of the circuit.

WASHINGTON. March 7. Material
improvement in the uncmtbvmpm
situation is indicated by labor reports
received by Arthur Woods, special as
sistant to Secretary Baker.
While confessing that his task of
replacing discharged soldiers In in
dustry had rather, awed him, Mr.
Woods said he did not view the prob
lem as a serious -one. A majority of
the discharged soldiers are finding
positions for themselves, ha snld nnA
a large proportion of these out of
work have made small effort to ob
tain Jobs.
An important elemnt in the work
of finding employment for the fight
ing men. Mr. Woods continued, is
furnished by the definite and decided
improvement wrought in each indi
vidual as a result of his militarv train-
ins. : '
He explained that tha covprnmpnt
was proceedine on 'the theorv that it
would be better for each soldier to
take his old place while awaiting bet
ter opportunity. In the meantime gov
ernment employment agencies will
place such men on preferred lists and
refer them to better positions.
Mr. Woods said' that in finding jobs
for soldiers, every effort would be
made to prevent ' the discharge cf
workmen employed now. He said no
discrimination would be made In the
cases of women workers, nut that cog
nizance would be taken of special
cases where women did not need the
employment. :

IDLENESS IN COUNTY

There are 100 more idle men in the

ment of labor at . Washington every

numDer or men .employed in Bisbee

program. .
Members and officers of the Bisbee
Central Trades union yesterday bad
not received information through of
ficial channels of the attempt to re
call from office George D. Smith, secretary-treasurer
of the Arizona State
Federation of Labor. No action will
be taken and the movement will not
be recognized here uatil such official
information is received. This la brief
is the attitude and statement of local
officials of the body affiliated with the
sjaie leaeration.
The movement against Smith start
ed In Globe several days ago with the
issuance of a resolution directed to
the president of the Arizona State
Federation of Labor, and calling on
that body for the recall of the- secretary-
treasurer. Wednesday the move
ment was given iurther impetus when
the Tucson Central Trades councir
adopted resolutions. At least three
more unions of the state must adopt
similar resolutions calling for the in
itiation of the recall petition before it
can be voted upon by the general
membership of the federation through
out the state.
The resolution adonted h tha'Tnr.
son union charges that Smith has used
nis position to disrupt trades unions
and that he has been a participant
in a "mysterious solidarity movement"
to supplant and "throw off tha shack
les or. worn-outs, narrow crart union
ism." Tucson resolutions call, also tor a
change in the editorship of the federa
tion's weekly newspaper declaring
that it purposely circulated a "state
ment calculated to fool the working
man . .. . and to do great harm
to the working men of thiB state."
Leaders in the local organization be
lieve that some official word of tha
movement should come to their atten-!
tion within the next few days. Until
such time, however, they will take no
action.
