- WASHINGTON, "bet. 18. A tenta

ference tonight after an all-day
session. Committee members will
consult with their respective groups
tomorrow and final action on fram

be taken by the general committee
tomorrow night.
The tentative declaration retained
the form of the original and was bro

item stating a suecific principle, in
order to be readily subject to amend
ment The discussion in committee,
which totaled eight hours, hinged
almost entirely on the right of "out

gotiations with employers. It was a
day of ups and downs during which
at times agreement seemed in sight,
and at times the breach widened and
compromise seemed impossible. The
committee recessed frequently to al
low labor and capital groups to cau

president of the Farmers National
Co-operative union and a member of
the employers' group of the confer
ence, declared agriculture generally
would "support labor in its demand
that the right of collective bargaining
be recognized by the industrial conference.'-'
"I am unwilling,'' he said, ."to
withhold from any other group of
men that which I demand for my
self or my own group. Organized
labor has asked that the conference
endorse its position on collective

"This position to my mind is per

DOWNFALL OF
RED REGIME
IN RUSSIA
INEVITABLE
Only a Few More Weeks and
Bolsheviki Forces Will Be
Forced to Surrender, Ac
cording to Latest Reports
WASHINGTON Oct. 18 "The
final crash of the Trotzky-Lenine
regime may be delayed some weeks,
but itis inevitable."
Official information received here
thus summarizes the situation in
Russia. The closing act of the Red
drama is already under way, accord
ing to reports from military attaches
and special agents.
Only the "inertia" of the anti-Bol-shevic
groups has permitted the
present Moscow government to re
main alive beyond September 15, one
official who has made a special study
of the situation said. The Bolshevik
organization, the reports say, has
been so poor at the foundation the
confidence of the masses that only
a push was necessary to start the
fall. This push has been lacking be
cause there was no efficient co-operation
between the anti-Red leaders
and in the absence of initiative or
ability on the part of any one of
them to start the forward movement.
General Denikine's advance toward
Moscow, the campaign of attrition
waged by the northwest Russian vol
unteers and the stiffening of Admi
ral Kolchak and his Cossack allies,
the reports say have furnished more
than the hoped-for pressure.
Official dispatches today did not
represent the fall of Petrograd,
which, however, was announced in
Paris.
The fall of Petrograd, however, is
c'oirsiuereil ut' minor 'iniinJitHr.ee as
compared with the results of Deni

With every city along the route,

And while the Smelter ity was de
clared yesterday to be backward in

were held out that it would succeed
before the time limit expires.
A sixteen inch silver cup mounted

the winner of the El Paso to Phoenix

The cup will be engraved with the

tires will virtually be a fourth prize.
Hugh Miller, winner of the last
race, probably will enter, according
to a letter received from him in
Phoenix. It is not known what car
he will drive, but there is a possibil
ity that he contemplates entering the
Pone Hartford which carried him to

Supervisors Engage
Attorney to Help
Oust Commission
Despite the fact that the board or
county supervisors has a county at
torney assistant bounty attorney and
a deputy county1 attorney to assist
it in whatever legal difficulties King
Adams and Charlie Roberts may in
volve themselves, it has employed
the law firm of Flannigan & Murray
to assist it in the quo warranto pro
ceedings which have been instituted
by R. N. French, county attorney.
The . quo warranto proceedings
have been begun, it was said yester
day, to establish whether the so
called second commission has any
right to the offic- to which its mem
bers were appointed, and if they have
not, to force theni to turn over to the
third commission jail the papers and
books which they jnay have in their
possession. '; .
Attorneys' Flannigan and Murray
will represent the county attorney in
prosecuting the suit, "but are em
ployed by the supervisors. Whether
this action of the supervisors is due
to the fact that Frank E. Curley,
Tucson attorney, has been retained
by the second commission to have the
board of supervisors show cause why
the bonds of the high commission
should not be accepted, could not be
learned yesterday.

Queen theater next Friday hard at

the exception of Johnny Celmars,
who will arrive in Bisbee tomorrow.
Celmrs has been fighting steadily In
Arizona and California and is report
ed to be in fine shape.
An opportunity is to be given all
Warren district fans to watch the
scrappers work out, according to
French. Loughery, who will oppose
Celmars in the main event, is taking
two workouts a day at the Knights
of Columbus hall, where several other
fighters are also training.
As has already been announced,
there will be 26 rounds of entertain
ment for the fans, with every pros
pect that each bout will be fast and
clever. Loughery and Celmars will
step 10 rounds; Johnny Meyers and
Kid Muscovie of El Paso will go six
rounds; Kid Mauch and Collins will
also go six, and the opener will be
four rounds.
Word has come from Tombstone
that a large number of fans have al
ready signified their intention of at
tending the show and indications are
that Douglas will also send a strong
delegation. Requests for seats Jn
the Warren district are also coming
in, and ever promise is that the the
ater will be taxed to capacity.
Manager French is corresponding
with Ad Wolgast. former lightweight
champion, who has staged a strong
comeback on the coast, with the idea
of matching him in the near future.
His opponent will probably be Eddie
Shannon. French is also in hopes of
getting Steve Dalton here, perhaps
for Nov. 7, to fight either Loughery
or Russell Chambers.
Johnny Hughes, the well-known
boxer who has become a favorite
with Bisbee fans, .will not be able to
appear in the ring for severa lweeks,
although Manager French wanted
him for one of the early cards.
Hughes shoulder was injured in his
last fight and is in such shape that
his physician has forbidden him from
entering the ring for some time.

Country Into Submission
WASHINGTON, Oct. IS. There
seemed -little hope of averting the
strike of 500,000 bituminous coal min
ers, called for November 1.
After a series of conferences with
labor leaders, John L. Lewis, president
of the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica, announced that the miners would
go out unless all demands, inlucding
the five-day week were granted.
The operators stood by their decis
ion not to consider any proposal look
ing to a shorter weekly schedule, and
refusing to open negotiations unless
the strike older was withdrawn, and
charged that the miners were trying
to freeze the country into submission
by insisting upon acceptance of "im
possible demands."
' "The strike will not be called off,"
Lewis declared.
"We will not arbitrate while the
etrfike order stands," said Thomas T.
Brewster, chairman of the Operators'
scale committee.
Meanwhile pressure was being
brought to bear on both sides from
many quarters to adjust their differ
ences and save untold distress. Opera
tors said there was enough, coal on
hand to supply the country for 30 days
from November 1.
Secretary Wilson, at whose invita
tion the scale committee of the min
er sand operators will meet with him
here Tuesday, declined to comment on
the negotiations and continued to hope
that he would be able to bring about
peace.
BISBEE WINS
E
DOTJLAS, Oct. 18. The gridiron' at
the Tenth street ball park was lined
today with cheering people who wit
nessed one of the fastest games of
football ever played in Douglas. The
final score was Bisbee, 33; Douglas,
14.
Back and forth over the field surged
the Douglas and Bisbee high school
palyers, fighting hard for every yard.
In the first, ten miutes of play Bisbee
made a touchdown and was successful
in kicking the goal. Though fighting
pluckily during the entire half the
local boys continued to lose and when
the whistle blew for time Bisbee had
scored three touchdowns and the
game stood 33 to 0 in Bisbee's favor.
Bud Clark, supported by Paul Glas
sey, made one of the finest plays for
Douglas. The play was made on a
kick off. Clark, who was the fullback,
kicked the ball to one side and Glassey
recovered the ball, making a gain of
some forty yards. With two downs
Douglas had the ball over the line for
another touchdown, icking the goal
the boys raised the Douglas scrore to
14. From the showing made In the
last half it is said that Coach Heinz
has created one of the fastest teams

PEACE PACT
1EETS SNAG
Rambling Debate in Which all
Take Part; Lasts Several
....Hours; Everything Under
Sun Discussed in Session
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18. Plans
to hasten senate action on the peace
treaty were upset again today, a
rambling debate occupying most of
the afternoon that had been set aside
for completion of the formal reading
of the treaty text. ,
When adjournment, was taken
after a four hour session only about
an hour's progress had been made
in the reading, which will be re
sumed Monday.
Starting with a discussion of the
case .of Irish independence the debate
shifted to such subjects as the obli
gations of article ten of the eague of
nations covenant and the dismem
berment of Turkey and wound up
with a bitter argument about the
war record of Senator Hitchcock,
Neb., the administration leader in
the treaty fight.
The Irish question got before the
senate in a resolution by Senator
Walsh, Democrat, Montana, a sup
porter of the treaty ih its present
form. His resolution proposed that
as soon as the United States takes
membership in the league of nations
it call attention to the right of the
Irish people to self-determination.
Senator Walsh argued that such a
course, suggested by President Wil
son's declaration on his western trip,
offered the best hope for Ireland's
free dom. Severa senators replied
that it offered no hope at all. Sena
tor Penrose Republican, Pennsylva
nia, characterizing it as "the crown
ing, most insolent effort yet to
'bunco' flie Irish."
The resolution went over without
action.
The climax of today's debate came
when Senator Poindexter, Republi
can,. Washington, attacking the war
record of Senator Hitchcock, got a
fiery reply from the Nebraska sena
tor, who defended his course in pro
posing an embargo on arms and de
clared he would rather have the ln
will of Senator Poindexter than his
respect.
ONLY A
SPEEDING P
We are wondering whether Charlie Roberta, In his latest highway
commission, has succeeded in getting a bunch of rubber stamps. It was
because they refused to be mere flunkies that the members of highway
commission number two were discharged. They had enough self-respect
to decline to let Roberts do their thinking for them and to dance at his
orders. It was then that Reberts set out to find a bunch of men who
would perform without asking any questions.
We understand that Roberts had some difficulty in finding men who
would accept appointment under these conditions. It is reported that O.
S. French, "Billie" Robinson and A. E. Downs of Bisbee, Tom McCarthy of
Lowell, Harvey Saxby of Lowell and John Alexander of Bisbee, who
originally supported Roberts, turned him down. Along with Twomey and
Seeley they have repudiated both Roberts and decline to be tricked again.
For Emil Marks, I. W. Wallace, W. J. Reay and A. Y. Smith, wno re
fused to sign on the dotted line for Roberts, we have the utmost respect.
As to W. H. Fisher, Dan B. Seed, M. F. Discus and T. S. Bowen. we are
wondering how they can hope to maintain their self-respect and play trail
era to Charlie Roberts. As to Tom Fulghum, who was named on both
commissions number two and number three, his positions is not au in via
'ble one. Apparently he is neither fish nor fowl.
In the meantime the fight goes merrily on in dear old Cochise. Com
micdion number two is still on the job, while commission number thr
is apparently ready to take Roberts' orders when there is a chance to
execute them.
Question: If Roberts can raise bo much hell as supervisor of Co
chise county, what would he do as governor? Tucson Citizen.

Wilson passed the best day he has
known since his present illness began.
Rear Admiral Cary T. Grayson, his
personal physician, said tonight. No
operation will be necessary to relieve
the swelling of the-protate gland,
which complicated the case and the
president is making slow, but satisfac
tory progress toward recovery from
hi3 nervous exhaustion.
This was the conclusion reached by
the six attending; physicians after a
consultation late today which lasted
more than an hour and a half. Their
optimistic views weer reflected in the
bulletin issued at 10 a. m.
The bulletin on President Wilson's
condition issued at 10 o'clock tonight
follows:
' The piesident had a comfortable
day. He has taken abundant nourish
ment and is somewhat stronger. The
improvement in the prostatic condi
tion has been maintained very satis
factorily and no change in the simple
treatment employed is contemplated."
(Signed) -GRAYSON."
"DERCUM, -"YOUNG,
"FOWLER.
"RUFFIN."
The decision that no operation was
necessary was made by Dr. Hugh
Young, the Baltimore specialist, while
Dr. F. X. Dercum of Philadelphia, saw
signs of improvement in the presi
dent'. nervous condition. All of the
doctors were agreed that he was mak
ing progress toward recovery.
The program of complete rest from
official cares prescribed by Dr. Gray
son and his associates will continue to
be enforced, it was stated. There is
no intention of referring to the presi
dent any matter not absolutely requir
ing the exercise of his official powers.
Dr. Grayson indicated that he would
not favor referring any bill to the pres
Hent lor signature at present unless
it was one on which he desired to ex
ercise his veto power. Otherwise
measures culd be allowed to go upon
the statute books at the expiration of
the ten-day period provided by the
constitvtion.
The prohibition enforcement bill is
now awaiting presidential action. The
impression prevailed tonight that it
would be allowed to become effective
without Mr. Wilson's signature.

the winter street salt sketched today.
It is made of velour de laino in the
wonderful new color called bronze
citron. The fur pockets, cuffs, muff
and hat are of gray squirrel. The
little close fitting turban is relieved
with a trim of French violets.
The most noteworthy thing about
this suit is Its absolute simplicity ot
line. The soft belt of self material
onto which the skirt of the coat is
.gathered, as well as the KUggebtiou
of fullness in the coat proper, hints
at the Russian blouse which is so
popular this season.
It will -be observed that the model
posing in this suit is, also showing
a frilled', waist, ; Though wai.st de
signers have been trying for months
to get away from ruTfles, It is im
possible to discard this dainty and
attractive style. Women cling , to
frills because of their softening in

which they are worn. And with furs

CAIIET OIL
That Calumet Super-Fine Motor oil
is looked upon by experienced motor
car drivers as perhaps the most re
liable and finest lubricating oil for
gas engines on the market is Indi
cated in two requests which have
come from entrants in the El Paso
Phoenix road race to have their carts
supplied with this oil when they
reach Bisbee. The first , letter is
from Jack O'Connell of Albuquerque,
M. who wrjtes as follows:
' "Having had considerable experi
ence with Calumet Super-Fine Motor
oil, I wish to use this oil in my Hud
son in the El Paso-Phoenix road race,
"Please supply me, both at El Paso
and Bisbee, with a fivegallon can of
Calumet Super-Fine Motor Oil, extra
heavy."
.'. The second letter is from the Bu
quor Motor company, El Faso, and
reads as follows:
"Kindly notify your Bisbee asexn
to supply us with another five-gallon
.can of Calumet Super-Fine Motor Oil
extra heavy, as we pass through Bis
.bee in the El Paso-Phoenix road race
"After years of experience with
Calumet Paraffine-base oil we know
tjiat it is the one oil on which we
can depend. "We don't wish to waste
any time in this race with motoi
trouble. We want to be sure or
maximum speed and power. That is
why we will use nothing but Calu
met."
Both letters were addressed to the
Cochise Motor company nere.

of relief extended over the ordinary locaj Red Crosa chap'.er, which is a
J widow with four small children. A
'number of the widowed mothers left
(with children under sixteen years of
work of previous years.
The leason for this has benn chief
ly on account of so much Illness dur
ing the year, and according to reports
of other charitable and relief organ
izations our experience has been about
the same as others throughout the
United States, as many families hav
ing been left without a bread-winner
were compelled to have temporary aid
at least until other resources were
available for their suppert.

Association during the year sixty-five
of them had more or less illness in
their homes, while theri were alto
gether seventeen tubercular cases in
cluding the individual and transient
cases. Thirty nine of these eight-two
families given help were Mexicans. .
Durjng the influenza epidemic we
endeavored to see that all needy fam
ilies and individuals reported to us
were supplied with actual necessities,
and also that someone was sent to
care for the sick. It was impossible
to obtain many women who had been
accustomed to nursing, although twenty-
two women and girls were employ
ed by us at various times during the
influenza epidemic to do the best they
could in caring for the sick, and these
with the help of a visiting nurse en
abled us to give aid to most of the
cae3 reported to us. During this time
and after thee eppidemic ceased th
Warren Mining District Chapter of the i
local Red Cross re-embursed us with j
all amounts expppended on these cas- i
es, as well as having paid for the ser-1
vices of a visiting nurse as long as she
was needed. This prevented the pos
sibility of overlapping, as some of
the.se families might otherwise have
Very few transients have come to us
for aid, which is a good indication that
work is plentiful, while most of thase
who did come to us were either tub
bercular or afflicted in some way, if
not past the age of usefulness.
In the thirteen cases of transporta
tion furnished by us nine were on ac
count of illness, as many ill people
find this altitude too high and are
compelled to seek some other location.
Most of the employment furnised by
us was temporary work for women
end girls. While there was so much
illness we were able to supply work
for almost anyone whos came to u
wanting work.
Most of the clothing that was given
out to needy families and individuals
was donated to us, which is a great
help, as many children could not at
tend school without some aid In the
way of clothing. The local Red Cross
Chapter also donated us several bolts
of new good.s of which 130 yards
have been given out to needy mothers
I to be made up for their children.
Recital Adds to Fund
The proceeds of two recitals given
by the pupils of Mrs. J. M. English and
Miss Kathleen Hail, amounting In all
i to $128.70, were handed over to this
association duriDg the winter mouths.
This amount was very acceptable, as
at this particular time one of our most
distressing caf-es was a family of sev
en dependent children where the
father was dying of cancer, and had
no income whatever. The mother is
now receiving a widow's pension un
der the child welfare law.
At Christmas times we received
quite a substantial supply of food and
groceries from the Presbyterian and
Methodist churches, besides the sum
of $28.25 in money from the Presbyte
rian church. The Altar society of the
Roman Catholic church has also given
us a regular donation of $5 per month
for some, years.
The welfare of children in the dis
trict has been very closely connected
iwith the work of this association, as
we find that most of the delinquent
children come from the poor and under-nourished
families, which bears
out the fact that so long as poverty
exists the standard of living is much
j lower. Very often - the delinquent
children belong to some mother who
is compelled to go out to work and is
unable to care for the children proper
ly, and the juvenile court has made it
possible for many of these children to
be cared for until their mothers can
see their way to do so themselves, or
until some other means are provided
for children's best interest.
Red Cross Helps
We are glad to report that the ser
vices of the local Red Cross nurse in
this district have been offered to the
association whenever needed among
the poor families, and this work on her
part has already proved very effec
tive. Through the efforts of one of the
members of the board,. -Prof. C, F. Wil
lis, the' general secretary"," was enabled"
to attend the National Conference of
Social Work held in Atlantic City
from June 1 to 8, which conference
was an inspiration, and undoubtedly a
great benefit to all those attending it
who were interested in the farious de
partments of social service work.
The object of this association has
always been to deal with all cases for
Ihe best interest, of the people con
cerned and for the good of the district
I generally. Many times aid has been
refused when it was considered that
such: cases were unworthy of aid, and
while some may have received help
who were not worthy of It, we nave,
nevertheless, endeavored to give any
and ail cases reported to us the atten
tion they should have.
Again thanking all who have helped
us In our vt ork during the year.

YOUNG MEN'S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION
OF WARREN MINING DISTRICT
A splendid program was presented
to a luig audience in theY. M. C. A.
gymnasium by the Paramount players,
giving the first in the series of attrac
. tions presented by the Redpath
Lyceum bureau. Every selection was
of high, order, showing the splendid
training of the artists in their respec
tive lines. They were heartily encor
ed, inthe expression of appreciation
by the audience. The pleasing person
ality of the artists immediately won fa
vor, the success of the program as a
whole being an effective testimonial
to the care and discrimination shown
by the Redpath Lyceum bureau in se
lecting the right kind of talent for
these courses. The Y. M. C. A. has
been assured that the merit of all
these courses will be equally as good
as the first. Regrets were heard from
many people who were not fortunate invited
Tuesday evening at 7:30 o'clock. Both
men and women are invited. The as
sociation has been fortunate in secur
ing the services of F. F. Mc
Leod, reporter and proof reader
on the Bisbee Daily Review, to
give this talk. Mr. McLeod Is a man
of wide experience in newspaper writ
ing, and will te able to supply veluable
suggestions aB to the proper forms,
methods and expressions in the art of
writing articles representing the inter
ests of their respective organizations,
and in placing their Interests properly
before the public. Mr. McLeod will
relate some humorous incidents out
of his experience, and will be sure to
interest any who may attend. Publicity
writers for stores, clubs, religious
workers, churches, educational and
musical organizations are especially
ception to all the goblins and gouls In
the world of make-believe. A startling
program will be presented which will
be abundant in thrills and surprises.
Every one is requested to bring nerves
with them if they wish to enjoy the
party. In fact, the goblins are loosing
sleep at night in order to give the Bis
bee community all that it is looking
for, as they know their reputation de
pends on their ability to put it across
in proper form.

Homer Field Said
Iiargest in U. S.
"The Homer field in northern Louis
iana is one of the largest oil fields
ever encountered in the United States,
in the opinion of oil operators." said
C. J. Hall, an El Paso -broker, who re
turned from the Home field recently,
where he has been making a study
of conditions. ' " 1
"The Standard Oil. company's 30,000
barrel well on the Ro.we tract is be
lieved by oil men to be the world's
largest high-gravity oil well. It was
first thought that the well might be
a freak but when "Big Bill' Rowe, of
the Burkburnett and Oklahoma fields,
drilled a 20,000 barrel well adjoining
Louisiana Oil and Refining company
drilled a 10,000 barrel well at a depth
of 1233 feet the largest shallow well
ever drilled.
"Homer is getting considerable play
from the Oklahoma and Texas opera
tors. They are flocking in large num
bers from the Texas and Oklahoma
fields.
"A peculiar feature which I noticed
around the town of Homer was that
80 percent of the population were ne
groes. Negroes are becoming weathy
and Charlie Jackson, a farmer once as
poor as "Job's turkey," has blossomed
out with a large Cadilac car and his
wife and 14 children have cars.
Charles is a Baptist by faith,
nnd is contributing some of his
newly acquired wealth for the support
of the church. Other negroos are fre
quently seen out in any car from a
Ford upward, according to the size of
the oil well drilled on their farm."

The invested capital of American Democracy consists in the memory of her great leaders , and servants, and among those we put in
the foremost rank, our old friend, Theodore Roosevelt. A Memorial to Theodore Roosevelt will, when it is finally erected, direct the
attention of the observer to the character and life of Roosevelt himself, and will thus be a subtle but nevertheless powerful influence
which will tend to strengthen those characteristics which will mean so much to the betterment and permanence of our Republican
Institutions.

ON EXTENSION
PROFESSOR TO SPEAK
E
THURSDAY
Appearing in the Interests of the
general university extension course
"which Is being organized at the Uni
Tersity of Arizona under the direc
tion of Dr. Frank C. Lockwood, the
latter will speak concerning it in Bis
lee on next Thursday. The lecture
will bt delivered before the Luncheon
club. His talk will be a general re
sume of the subject, which is to be
handled in detail by President R. B.
von KleinSmid in a series of six lec
tures to be delivered here during the
winter.
Dr. Lockwood returned yesterday
to Tucson after a three weeks' trip
through the northern part of the
state, and reported that the univer
sity extension plan is receiving . a
very favorable reception there, es
pecially among the teachers.
The present day idea of university
extension is that it should proceed
as a natural outgrowth of the heal
thy resourceful, democratic life of
the university not as something
grafted or imposed upon the institu
tion from without. The university
Is the institution of the people, and
every department should reach the
people as widely and serviceably as
possible.
With the foregoing in mind the
course will include a number of per
tinent and important features, among
which are the following:
Correspnodence courses in agricul
ture, astronomy, botany, civil engi
neering education, English, erman.
rencn, nisiory, mathematics min
eralogy, mining and metallurgy, phil
osophy, physics and Spanish.
The organization of an Arizona
high school public speaking league
under the direction of the department
of English composition and rhetoric.
The preparation and circulation,
with the assistance of the library
staff, of a number of small loan
packet libraries for the use of debat
ing clubs and other societies..
The initiation and supervision of
a diversified scheme of visual in
struction, including motion picture
films, stereopticon slides and picture
exhibits. "i
An extension lecture service, under
a 'plan to have three or four lecture
circuits with fiv or six towns on
each circuit. '

Christianity Up
From the standpoint of the school, the ideal output is
often represented as the scholar; of the church, as the Chris
tian ; of the State, as the citizen. These are all inadequate ;
the true product of all cultural education, as against techni
cal or professional training, is character. There ia no true
citizen without character, and the scholar without character
is a menace to society, and a dangerouh asset of the State.
In the last analysis, religion must always underlie mol
ality. There is no authority
in the call to duty, except it
in all the range of religious
settled conviction of every Christian State, that the religion
ot Jesus Christ alone is adequate.
If it be held that the state edu-
cates only in order that it may pro -
duce good citizens, that is to say,
that the warrant for state education
is in the exercise of its police pow
ers, then it should be apparent that
the kind of education which fits for
'good citizenship cannot stop with
the mere impartation of knowledge
or with the discipline of intellectual
faculties only. The citizen who lacks
morality is a menace to the state
and defeats the very object which,
according to the hypothesis, the
state has in view in educating him.
But if, in recognition of this consia
, eration, the state should take meas
ures to educate its sons and daugh
ters in the principles and precepts i of prejudice, weighted with the pres
of morality, then it should need noj tige of the state, is thrown against
-argument to make it clear that the any other than such a secular educa
only source from which the state can I tlon, under any auspices whatsoever.
? draw these principles and precepts
is in the authority of Almighty Goa,
in which his law is given as the su
preme norm of all human constitu
tions and statutes, and his will as
the only true guide in all human
character and conduct.
The Bible should be more than
merely a text-book In the public
schools of every grade; the simple,
broad elements of the historical and
the ethical in Christianity should be
diligently and sympathetically taught,
and the whole attitude and atmos-
iph'ere of the system of public educa-'
The Church of God is under severe criticism today.
The criticisms come from both within and without the
church. But let it be noted that it is the criticisms chiefly
tthat find currency and publication and that the real good
that the church is achieving does not find extensive men
tion. The church itself does very little self-advertising.
It may therefore be well to look at some facts, author
itative and undeniable facts, concerning the Christian church
in this country. According to the religious statistics for
the year 1918, as furnished by H. K. Carroll, L. L. D.,' the
religious statistician of the United States government, there
were in this country 41,193,499 church . members.
it tne population of . the country
was, at that time, 106,e00,O00, then
the names of far more than one-third
of our population appeared on the
roll books of the church. But it must
be borne in -mind that-this country
has many babes and little children
under church age. About 22 per
'cent of the population is under ten
years of age. If we deduct 22 per
cent from a population of 10ti,O00,0Cw,
then the country had a population
of 82.600,000 of ten years and over.
At this rate in 1918 there were -49S
church members out of every 100t
inhabitants. Of course, if our popu
lation exceeded 106,000,000, the rate
.would be a trifle lower, but the dif
ference would be inappreciable. It
r thus appears that practically one
; half or our population are church
members. That is, they are mem
. bers of churches doctrinally founded
on the Bible and deriving the ar
. tides or their faith from it.
The so-called evangelical churches
have a total membership of 25,137,
138. The Roman Catholic and east-
ern orthodox churches together have
a total membership of 14.400.260. The
non-evangelical churches; that is,
those churches whose doctrinen
' touching the atonement, the divin
ity of Christ, etc., are not considered
orthodox by. the evangelical churches,
have a membership of 656,099.
(These figures have been taken
from t lie church statistics compiled
by Dr. H. K. Carroll for the year
1918, and published by the Christian
, Herald on April 12, 1919.)
The World Almanac for 1919, on
page 807. gives the total membership
of the churches of the country as be
ing 42.044.374; the total number of I
ministers, 191,722, and the lotal num
ber of church organizations, 22S.007.
This same puhlirai in puts the i',v.n
dda school enrollment at i ,Dr,l,'7.".,
with a corps of teachers and officers
amounting to 1.958.31S.
The total increase in the memher
ship of the churches for the ten
years. 1909 and 1919, inclusive, was
7.6S0,621. This is an increase for
this period of just about 23 per cent.
The average annual increase for this
perjod was ,708,062. . j ,
The ' 1 seating : "capacity ; of the
v churches of the country is between
seventy-five and eighty millions. The
; Trotestant churches claim a seating
capacity of tilty-three and one-half
millions. The churches, therefore,
have accommodations for fully twice
t their actual membership. It must bei

If it is objected that it is not the
business of the state to stand for
religion, it need only be said that it
is certainly not more its business to

If it be , said that the teaching of re

ship; there are people who are ill,
and there are always circumstances
which prevent Christians from be-j

fact, therefore, that there are so
many empty pews in the churches,
a fact that is so greatly exploited,
does not justify the claim that peo

Christianity is. decadent. It demon
strates that while the churches pro
vide for-their .own, they. provide for
others-also.' '
In 1918, the Boston Transcript, a
secular daily, made', a survey in or
der to ascertain from whence came
the immense benevolent gifts of this
country for the year 1917. After
sifting all its facts it stated that 78
per cent of, all' the money given for
! benevolent enterprlces - came from
people whose names .are on the
church, rolls. (A report of this sur
vey was .given in the Record of
Christian Work' for August, 1918.)
In the meantinies the benevolences
of the churches have increased two

creased; . tho. Presbyterian church for
$13,500,000, the "Baptist church for
$6,000,000, and bo on throughout all
the churches. This tremendous in
crease in the benevolent gifts of the
churches will bring the 78 per cent
of 1917 up to eighty-five or ninety
per cent.
The church has its "regular chan
nels through which veritable rivers
of benevolence are constantly floSv
ing. If every Sunday school member
I in the country gives a nickel on a
certain Sunday the total amount will
be almost exactly $1,000,000.
The value of the church properly
in the United States is given as be
ing $1,257,500,000. But in addition to
this the churches have incalculable
sums In trust Tunds. given through
the years by wills and devisements,
the proceeds of which support Chris
tian colleges, carry on missionary
enterprises, provide old ago pensions
for ministers, hupport church hospi
tals, etc.
The foregoing facts do not often
come to mention, are little adVertlsed
or exploited, but they re an:tfifthori-
t,,ive as such facts can be. And
from them few people will conclude

She stopped at that and laughed.
And the puekers straightened.

I have thought of what said

when something stopped me. What,
would my maestro say? Wondering
about that I didn't commit myself.
I "I'll think it over," I replied, "and
call you up in a little while."
That afternoon I w&nt to Bee my
singing teacher, whose counsel was
as :.se as his teaching of voice.
"You mustn't accept." he said In
that serious way of his. "Only a
little w nilo longer before the money
will be coming In from proper
sources. If you return to vaudeville .
lt may injure the chances we have
in mind for you."
"But,". 1 protested, "I : need th
money."
He laughed. "I know, but we must
find It in another way. Your vaude
ville days are over. Returning to
that kind of elnging. even for th
few weeks you would like, can only
set you back In reputation, I mean.
Strange, but musicians and man

Not understanding, they arc prune to
mistaken Idea. Writo to your
father, Rosa, an?l explain to htm."
I left the studio heavy hearted.
I didn't want to burden father;
times were not good, and his business
required his own capital. Yet there
was no other way If I refused the
vaudeville offer.
A few weeks later 1 wrote home
and explained the situation. I need
not have worried; everything came
out all right. And very soon after
came my chance to sir.pr for the
Metropolitan, and to gain tho coveted

having at their disposal insufficient
money to se.e them comfortably

When the railroads became tied up
it was impossible to supply the bakers
of California with yeast, so the Chev

Today
the
Gov. Thomas EL Campbell has issued a proclamation designating Monday, October,' 27, as Roosevelt day and has urged upon school superintendents of the 14 counties of
'Arizona that appropriate exercise be held in the public schools Friday, October 24. '
Roosevelt Day will not be a legal holiday in any sense of the word. The object of the day, as explained, is to emphasize the spirit of the Roosevelt Memorial campaign
and to stimulate interest in the campaign on it9 last day. ' ' ;
i ss. at . . . -
Koosevelt and what he stood tor as an American and Americanism as expressed, by him as a lesson to the children and coming generations is the motive back of
Roosevelt Memorial Association and Roosevelt Day jyill be an occasion for emphasizing it.
James H. McClintock, state director of the association, has explained that every subscriber to the Roosevelt Memorial fund will become automatically a member nf th,
sociation, regardless of the size of the subscription. He also said that so much interest had been aroused through' the state that the quota allotted to Arizona by the national
committee, win De a minimum oniy ana mat indications are mar. tne quota win oe aoubied.
While the campaign does not start until tomorrow, subscriptions have already begun to arrive Among them is $50 from the members of the Elks' Lodee in Phoenix
and $25 from the Spanish-American war veterans. Numerous pledges for smaller amounts have been received. "Vtyjf fsvt1 V
Reports front over the state are that civic organizations, the churches, colleges and, schools are taking hold vigorously in the interest of the memorial campaign. Sermons
will be preached in many of the churches of the state today on Roosevelt, his life and deeds. . ;.
le as-
Throughout the length and breadth ef the United States the week
which begins today it to be Roosevelt Memorial week, la every city and
hamlet of the land he loved so well, In every cross-road aior and village
meeting place from Maine to California are the next seven days to be de
voted to the loving task of collecting f nods for the erection of a permanent
monument to that forward-looking citizen who typified, lb the highest de
gree, the principles upon which his country had been founded, and who
dared, during all his life time, to preach those principles even before foreign
princes and in the strange places of the earth. ,
More, perhaps, than any other president of this country, . Roosevelt
was a citizen of the world. From the time that his energetic and thor
ough reform of the New York polio department brought him first Into pub
lic notice, through all the stirring series of events In his life, which cul
minated in his stern opposition to German militarism, he had been looked
upon as the very personification of Americanism. In his Jonrneys to the far
places of the world he was considered the human embodiment of the princi
ples of his country. And now that he Is dead, the country that he loved so
well and which he served so long Is to do him fitting honor.

Of al

than Arizona. It was from this state
that he took his. first Rough Riders

hard-hitting fighters that leaped Into

most brilliant chapters In the military

In Cochise county.and particularly
In Blsbee, has the call been Heard and
preparations been made to answer It
With the receipt of the first Intelli
gence concerning the proposed memo
rial the citizens of this ctty and the
surrounding country reBolved that, as
has always been the case, Bisbea
should be foremost In giving to tha
proposal such support as would be in
keeping with her Ideals and her
Americanism.
The working committee which is In
charge of the solicitation of funds un
der the state executive committee,' un
der Gov. Thomas E. Campbell, is head
ed by J.' C. Ryan, with Thomas A.
Egan, secretary of tho Warrea Dis
trict Commercial club as secretary,
The ether members of the committee
pre as follows:
Ira B. Jerolaman, Warren; W. H.

Dwight R. Heard, Phoenix; Allen H.
Ware. Kingman; John C. Greenway,
Warren; James S. Douglas, Douglas;
E. S. Clark, Prescott; W. C. Foster,
state treasurer.
To complement the work of the
committee in charge in this city, a
Warren-Bisbee committee' has also
been formed, and will take up -the
task among the churches, business In;
terests and social organizations' of the'
district. This committee Is headed by
Ira B. Joralemon and includes the fol
lowing: . "
For the .churches: Re. Compton,
Professor Philbrook; Elks' club. Mr.
Matthews; Moose, Howard Bark ell r
Eagles, E. Ollerenshaw; Knights of

ger; Denn-Shattuck Mines, T. O.
McGrath; for the Masonic lodge, Bas
sett Watklns.
Although the district Is to be can
vassed thoroughly, tt is expected by
those in charge of the work that the
subject will appeal so strongly to the
people of this part of the county that
a great part of the Blsbee-Warren
quota will come In through voluntary
donations. For this reason, subscrip
tion cards have been placed at the
disposal of voluntary donors at the
Commercial club rooms, where they
may be obtained by request.
The national committee has Im
pressed in all ita publicity, the fact
that the campaign Is absolutely non
partisan. Roosevelt before everything
else, was a friend to all the people,
Religious, political or racial- lines
meant nothing to him and upon this
fact has his popularity and his fame
been founded. The appeal for funds,
then. Is made to every citizen of Bls
bee who believes In the "frOG per cent
(Continued on Page Two) .,
Theodore Roosevelt
He was found faithful over a few things, and he was made ruler
over many; he cut his own trail clean and straight and millions foi
. lowed him toward the light. . " '
-"".
He was frail; he made himself a tower of strength. He was timid;
he made himself a lion of courage. He was a dreamer; he became
one of the great doers of all time.
Men put their trust in him; women found a champion in him; kings
stood in awe of him, but children made him their playmate.
He broke a nation's slumber with his cry, and it ' rose up. He
touched the eyes of blind men with a flame and gave them vision.
Souls became swords through him; swords' became servants of God.
He was loyal to his country, and e exacted loyalty; he loved
many , lands, but he loved his own land best.
He was terrible In battle, but tender to the weak; joyous and tire
less, being free from self-pity; clean with a cleanness that cleansed
the air like a gale.
Hjs-courtesy knew no wealth or class; his friendship, no creed or
color or race. His courage stood every onslaught of savage beast and
ruthless roan, of loneliness, of victory, of defeat. His mind was eager,
his heart was true, his body and spirit defiant of obstacles, ready to
meet what might come.
"It seems to me that first and foremost Theodore Roosevelt was a great
American in the best sense of the phrase; a capable ant; courageous
fighter; an adventurer in thought and action, as eagerly hunting big ideas
in the minds of men as he sought big game in the Jungle. Generous in
praise of others and fearless in competition with them, whether that com
petition took him into the field of sport or world affairs.
"Democratic In his friendships but beyond that he was deeply inter
ested in and loved humanity, and humanity loved him in return). Take
him all in all, weball not look upon his like again.
'r "Eleanor Robson Belmont."
"Whenever I think of Theodore Roosevelt one incident siantfs out in
my memory... I met him just after th report of Quentin's death had been
confirmed. It was a terrible blow." But the whole tenor o his conversa
tion was: We mustn't talk about it. We mustn't think about it. The
only thing to think about now is the countr.y What can be done to speed
up the war?'
"The picture of this heart-broken father, putting his private grief be
hind him to consider what should be done for the nation, will always stay
with me.
"One thing I believe the proposed
memorial will help keep before the
American people. It is the Ideal of
supreme devotion to country that for
ever will be associated with the name
of Roosevelt
"Irwin R. Kirkwood."
"I am heartily in favor of a memo
rial to our greatest American
Coloned Theodore Roosevelt, not only
because his works wnile alive en
title him to the very best the citizens
of this country can give him in the
way of -a memorial, but for the good
Influence such a memorial would have
"!n 'tklong jight -for Righteousness the watchword for all of us is spend -and be spent;--It is-of-little matter
whether any one rhan fails or succeeds, but the Cause shall not fail, for it is the Cause of Mankind."

in perpetuating tbe ideals that he
fought so strenuously for.
"William. Wrlgley, Jr."
"I cannot yet think of Theodore
Roosevelt without bitterness, that he,
who so loved hl3 country and who
gave it his all should have been so
maligned and during these hist years
should have been so meanly treated
by those who might have mustered
his great powers to the service of
the war. But it was Roosevelt's fate,
as it was Washington's and Lincoln's,
to be fought by envious enemies and
by them to be held in derision and
contempt, He was truly simpJe. He.
was as generous, gentle, affectionate
and open minded as he was con
stant, strong willed, courageous, high
tempered and violent of speech.
"He had a revulsion, instantaneous
and communicable to all who were
about him, against the petty and
shabby vices of mankind. He hated
the more rugged sins, as do all good
men, but he utterly loathed hypoc
risy, sloth, cowardice and equivoca
tion. It was this in him which made
him the greatest moral power in the
country. He was himself the essence
of our common paradox, the buoyancy
and puritanism of America. He re
called to us what lay covered, em
bedded in our hearts our lover for
the simple virtues which had made
bur fathers great. In spite of the
materialism which attended the ex- ,
ploitation of a virgin continent, the
growth of ugly cities, the develop
ment of vast industries; in spite or
the shabby exploitation of the immi
grants who crowded to our shores;
in spite of the crass admiration in
which the last generation beheld
their sudden millionaires, America
cherished its traditions, Roosevelt
spoke for those traditions and the
country heard, as it were, a familiar
voice long silent.
. "He was the prophet of the old
public morality,' to which 'he brought
back our public life. It was he, in
our time, who first effectively assert
ed the dominion of the common
wealth over all private power. And
when at last he spoke for social jus
tice he was the first public man in
America to blaze the way along -which
we all now know we must go.
"Medil McCormick."
"He was of the west He was an
Americau.
"He was for America first, last and
all the time.
"He was a hard hitting, free think
ing fighter for truth and upright
dealing.
"He WAS an American.
"William S. Hart."
"When a great man dies, the whole
people feels bereaved. The stream
of pilgrims, which has been flowing
to the grave in which He the earthly,,
remains that once held the spirit of
Theodore Roosevelt, is the unique
and, at the same time, symbolic ex
pression of the love which is flowing
in spirit from the whole American
people, to his memory. He was closer
to the hearts of the people than any 1
leader of his time. No American,
since 'Lincoln, has been such an ex
ponent of the genius of America.

consumed the life and the energy of
one of her greatest presidents.
Contributions may be made in sums
ranging upward from 50 cents. A fea
ture of the drive throughout the coun
try is the fact that every cent collect
ed during the week will be devoted to
the memorial. All the expenses of the
campaign are borne by personal
friends of the former president, who
are also devoting their time and atten
tion to the supervision of the pro
posal. An Interesting fact concerning the
campaign is contained in the notifi
cation that the first direct subscrip
tion to reach the office of James H.
McClintock, state director, was sent
in by H. A. Lusk of Chlrachua, Co
chise county, the subscriber proudly
signing himself, "Private Troop D,

check has been forwarded to County

THE B 1ST? EE DATLY "REVIEW
ur
Theodore Roosevelt,
E WAS found faithful over a few things and he was made ruler over many; he cut his own trail clean and straight and mil
lions followed him toward the light. . - WIMm
Jl II He was frail; he made himself a tower of strength.- He was timid; he made himself a hon of courage. He was a dream-
er; he became one or the great doers or ail tune. '":
Men put their trust in him; women found a champion in him; kings stood in awe of him, but children made him their playmate.
He broke a nation's slumber with his cry, and it rose up. He touched the eyes of the blind men with a flame and gave them
vision. Souls became swords through him, swords became servants of God.
He was loyal to his country, and he exacted loyalty; he loved many lands, but he ; loved his own land best.
He was terrible in battle, but tender to the weak; joyous and tireless, being free from self-pity; clean with a cleanness that cleansed
the air like a sale. . r&C
His courtesy knew no wealth, class; his friendship no creed or color or race. His courage stood every onslaught of savage aeast
and ruthless man, of loneliness, of victory of defeat His mind was eager, his heart was true, his body and spirit defiant of obsta
cles, ready to meet what might come. m , , ,
He fought injustice and tyranny; bore sorrow gallantly; loved..all nature, bleak spaces and hardy companions, hazardous adven
ture and the zest of battle wherever he went, he carried his own pack and in the uttermost parts of the earth he kept his conscience
for hU guide. ' "' 1 '

THE INCIDENT AT TRAU
NNOUNCEMENT was made a few days ago, by Secretary of
A the Navy Daniels that "on September 23d a small landing
force from the U. S. S. Olympia was landed at a Dalmatian
part and succeeded in recovering the town (Trau) and pre
serving order." The marines . acted under orders issued by Rear
Admiral - Andrews, commanding the American naval forces in the
Adriatic.
So far as the story goes it does not appear that there were
any casualties, but that has no bearing on the case. There might
have been a clash of arms and much bloodshed. In our endeavors
to maintain the peace of the entire world by force of arms we
cannot expect always to, be so fortunate as it appears, we were
on the western littoral of the Adriatic. Some day when some
Americas general or admiral receives orders to invade hostile soil
"in the interests of peace" there is going to be fighting and loss"
of life. i
The question arises at once, is this the part that America
should,' play in 1 its future international policy? It certainly is of
no immediate concern to us whether the Jugo-Slavs or the Italians
occupy Dalmatia. There is no threat in such a quarrel of an at
tack upon the liberties of the world. America does not give a
rap who gets the lordship of this territory. If Bismarck was right
when he declared that the Balkans were not worth the bones of
one Pomeranian grenadier, certainly Dalmatia Is not worth the
life of a single American boy.
Admiral Andrews said, in reporting the landing, that he was
acting upon instructions received from the Supreme Council at
Paris. But what authority had the Supreme Council, a majority of
whom are representing ' foreign nations and are thus responsible
toanother government than ours, to order a single American sol
dier, sear.ian or marine to go anywhera or do anything, much less
land on the soil of a friendly country. Secretary Daniels denied
that he gave orders for the landing of the marines, and yet the
naval forces of the United States are subject to the command of
the President alone or the Secretary of the Navy, acting for the
President.
It is well perhaps that the Trau incident should occur at this
time before the peace treaty has been ratified in order to impress
upon the American people the danger of ratifying it in its present
state. The Peace Conference at Paris is today functioning as a
League of Nations. It is clothed with as much authority as such
a league would be in dealing with truculent iations. The com
missioners are eating as a council and giving orders as though
the league were in operation and they were its official head. It
asks consent of neither the President nof of -our Congress, but
proceeds as though the armed forces of the United States in Eu
rope were under its command. Possibly they are, but we are sure
of one thing they arenot subject as yet to the orders of servants
of foreign rulers , with the consent of the American people, and
we doubt very much whether they ever will be.
THE I. W. W. AND THE NEGRO
W. W. literature especially appealing to colored people is be-
Iing circulated in Phoenix and vicinity. There can be no ob
jection to the efforts of any organization to increase its mem
mership provided it goes about it in the right way, but the
I. W. W. is not going about it in the right way, but in a way
calcilated to stir up bitter racial strife wffere none exists. How
far, if at all, the activities of the I. W. W. have been responsible
for the outbreaks in Arkansas and elsewhere in the south we are
not informed, but the I. W. W. campaign among negroes is by no
means a new thing.
The pamphlet which some of our local colored citizens have
received with a request to pass it along is illustrated by the
photograph of the charred body of the victim" of a mob at Waso,
Texas, more than three years ago. Then follows a more or less
statistical resume of the lynchings of colored men. It dwells
upon race discrimination and is otherwise calculated to fire the
colored man against his white neighbor. The appeal closes with
an invitation to the colored citizen to quit work and join the "one
big union."
This is not good ground for I. W. W. campaigning among the
negroes The negroes of Arizona have had little of which to com
plain. They are for the most part industrious. The ratio of idlers
among them is smaller than among American or Mexican nigh
bow. Perhaps a larger proportion of them own their own homes.
If none of them are very rich, few of them are very poor.
No colored man has ever been lynched in Arizona. Arizona,
even in its woolly days was not much given to lynching. It re
sorted to it only under the extremest provocation, when the laws
or the enforcement of them seemed inadequate. The latest occur
red more than a year ago. The victim of these lynchings have
always been American or Mexican murderers.
The negro has nothing and can have nothing in common with
the I. VV. W. His safety and prosperity like the safety and pros
perity of all law-abiding citizens depends upon the prevalence of
law and order. The worst thing that could happen to him would
be a reign of idleness and disorder such as the I. W. W. propose.

When a drive for fuuds is contemplated, it is always easy to find
people who can get enthusiastic about the duty of Bomebody else
to give.

TRUCK DRIVER KILLED
WHEN MACHINE HITS BARN.
FLAGSTAFF, Oct. 18. James Ed
ward Bason was instantly killed at
Grand Canyon on Saturday while
running a big Nash-Quad army truck
into a barn.
Bacon had just secured a job on
the government park force. He was
working on the truck, getting it into
shape. Being bothered by the tour
isjs, he decided to run the truck
into the barn, where he could work
undisturbed. As he started a man
named Anderson yelled at him :
"You can't make it!"
"Oh, yes, I . can," Bacon replied,
and rolled down hill to the open
doorway, which was only a few
inches higher than the back of the
seat. Reaching the door, he lurched
forward, striking his forehead against
the door frame. He was thrown
against the back of the seat and
wedged there,' his neck and upper
ribs broken, stopping the 7,000-pound
truck.
The case was unusually sad. Ba
con had been rejoicing with the
other men that morniig over having
secured a good, permanent job, the
best he had had in years. He had
rented a house at the Canyon, and
his wife and two pretty little daugh

their way from Washington and
were going to get off at Yucca, Ari

furniture to the new home.

TO REBUILD PLANT
OF GAS COMPANY.
SAFFORD, Oct. 18. R. E. Huths
teiner, consulting engineer, and II.
B. Whitaker, electric engineer, of
the Electric Co., were here for three
day this week and looked over the
local electric plant of the Gila Val
ley Electric, Gas and Water Co.
They also investigated local condn
tions as to future increase of patron
age for the company.
Mr. Huthsteiner recommended that
the local electric plant be rebuilt
and a De la Vergne engine, 100
horse power, manufactured in New
York City, be installed for the first
unit.
It will take several months to re
build the plant and install the De
La Vergne engine. The local plant
then will ba in first-class condition
for taking care of Safford and vicinity.

intoxicating odors floated upward
while the inmates of the county jail,

ARMY GETS READY
TO FIGHT INFLUENZA.
DOUGLAS, Oct. lS.-r-The army is
preparing now to fight . influenza
this winter. Rules governing pre
ventative measures to be taken in
every district have been issued by
Maj. Gen. Joseph Dickman. southern
department commander, to all dis
trict commanders who are to for-'
ward them to all commanding of
ficers. All commanding officers are to be
held responsible for a strict enforce
ment of the order ., providing for
sanitation in barracks, kitchens,
mess halls and other buildings. All
influenza patients must be isolated
in hpspitals ; and all soldiers, with
colds are required to remain away
from public or semi-public gather
ings. ' ,
The text of the influeuza order
reads:
"That head to foot arrangement of
beds in squad rooms is enforced.
"That .all rooms iu. barracks and
The other day I read a letter from
a college boy in the ambulance ser
vice in France. He was describing
a road over which he was driving his
car, a road terribly worn by shell
fire. There were huge piles of stones
and earth, great trees uprooted and
flung across the way, gaping caverns
half filled with jagged boulders. Un
der continuous fire the lad guided his
machine through the pitfalls.
It was terrible, he said; "nothing
but a Ford could have done it."
Through my mind an endless train
. of jokes about the Ford; "not a car,
but a Ford," the poor man's delight.
And then before my eyes flashed
agam that sentence in the letter from
France, "Nothing but a Ford could
have done it."
As we step into our luxurious
limousine let us pause a moment to
view that other picture. Let us watch
the Ford do her bit in the most won
derful work of the great war. Let us
follow her venturing into that inferno
of Boche fire, picking her way
through those yawning crators, by
ihose ragged heaps of debris, round
those up-flung tree trunks; swiftly,
surely, steadily on. that some
wounded soldier may have his flick
ering life won back in a field hospi
tal or that some dead hero may lie
at rest among his comrades instead
of in an unknown, unmarked grave.
Then let us think of those words
from the lips of the lad at the wheel,
"Nothing but a Ford could have done
it."

SMALL GAME
There was a little boy and he had a little gun,
And he went into the country, where the little birdies run.
And. after he had wasted all his cartridges away.
He marched back to his mother, who had longed for him all day,
And though he'd had a llly time, he's sadder now and wiser,
For all the game he brought to her was Just a supervisor.
Oh, fie upon you little lad the puny game you brought
You could have gathered fast enough in any vacant lot
The roads are full of road commissions, you could get you one,
Without as much as raising up your dinky little gun.
And if you only had a trap, some cabbage and a string.
You might have marched back to your mother with the Highway King!
Oct. 18. Up very late, after a long night's sleep, wherein I dreamed
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
that a score of highway commissions were dancing on my stomach, which
comes, my wife says, from thinking too much about supervisors. Had
breakfast at home, which seemed good, although the egg seemed to have had
an interesting existence, but ate it without murmuring, having made remarks
about my meals before with ill consequences. To the general offices, where
I did see a beautiful girl sitting at the information desk, which so inclined
me to talk with her that I asked for four different offices without remember
ing a single reply from her, which forsooth, made me ask her all over again,
and I think that she did not see my game. Much heartened by this, to the
police station, but nobody there. Found a cigar on the chiefs desk, which
j-oothed me mightily, and no ill effects yet. To Mr. Smith, at the Buxton
Smith company, who discoursed lengthily of prize fights and told me about
)Vaco, but I could have told him also some things about that village but
forebore, as I wiVed to keep a good thing to myself. Saw Mr. Sheehan also,
who was very busy, but detailed some gossip to me, which I did not write
down and so forgot, or I would have put it in the paper. To Mrs. Cunning
ham, but she was busy, too and I did not stop, although the two big root-beer
glasses she has were not being used. To Lowell, where I talked with Mr.
Thomas, the clerk of the court, and with Mr. Foster, the deputy sheriff, who
were mighty pleasant. Much gossip in the evening about a law suit, which
I did not understand. Worked hard at the office writing much about Roose
velt, and much out of countenance to find that the boss had stolpn some of
my copy for an advertisement, at which, however, I should not repine, as
that advertisement may pay my salary. Nevertheless, think I will keep my
copy from him after this. To bed early in the morning, which was Sunday,
and I full of holy thoughts and waffles.

WHY DO PEOPLE GQ TO CHURCH?
We often read something on why
People do not go to church. There is
another question at least equally in
teresting, why people do go to church.
According to Dr. Carroll, United
States statician, there Sre about fortyl
one million church members in the
United States. It is safe to assume
that at least an equal number attend
church more less frequently, if not
regularly. Many go to several devo
tional or business meetings in a week.
These are very significant facts. Why
do people do this? What do they get
out of it? It is entirely voluntary;
there are no financial returns but an
outlay. Among some of the chief rea
sons may be mentioned the following:
The spirit of worship is there. A
recent aiticle in the Review said,
"most youg men are not irreligious."
More than that is true. Most people
are not irreligious. On the contrary
it is natural to man to worship. Pro
lessor James says. "We cannot help
praing. It seems probable 'that, in
spite of all that 'science may do to
destroy religion man will always
pday till end of time." It cannot be
doubted that that is one reason why
to many reople go to church.
Churches are built and dedicated
to the worship of God. and there is a
feeling that the church is in a peculiar
sense His house, and that it is a good
thing to be there.
The moral teaching of the church
is always on a high plaue. and men
teel that it is good for them and their
children to be there aud to hear such
things
The music in ouit churched is uot
good, but in most of them the great
hymns of the centuries are sung, and
they are attractive and helpful for
devout minds.
It is a restful change from the busi
ness that presses so insisently upon
men all the rest of the week. Here
if anywhere, they are able to forget
their wordly cares for a time.
Men find congenial fellowship here.
Many a man and woman mo es almost
entirely in the atmosphere of the
church. Here they form their friend
ships, and here their social interests
center.
Men feel that they owe it to God,
as well as to themselves and society,
to recognize him end his services in
this way. In short they feel a sense
of dut or obligation.
Even the poorest preachers discuss
great themes, and the best are often
very inspiring in their addresses.
Those who are looking for some pood
usually find it. The gospel message,
even when poorly presented, is adapt
ed to the nerds of the world. It re
trains the evil, inspires righteousness
comforts the sorrowing, cheers the
discouraged, and makes the world bet
ter and brighter, and so people go to
hear it and always will.
The Anona club will meet tomorrow
evening at the home of Miss' Genua-,
veve Johns in Warren. The members
are especially urged to be present as
there is business of importance to be
considered.

Theodore Roosevelt loved his Flag. He served it on the battlefield and in the heat and bitter
ness of political strife. He fought to keep it clean, inasmuch as he fought for clean and decent
government, for justice, without and .within, for? Democracy, for equal opportunity, and the fear
less enforcement of just laws, i
Because heloved his Flag, because he served it, because he fought for it, because he recalled
to our hearts the principles whatever be the cost, therefore we who are left to carry on his
ideals, have set aside this coming week as a Roosevelt Memorial Week not to honor him, who
needs no honor we can bestow, but, in remembrance of him and his service, to pledge to this
Flag our hands, our hearts, and our spirits.
You who believe in the Americanism and ideals as exemplified in the life and teachings
of Theodore Roosevelt, American, subscribe this week to the Memorial Fund Commit
tee of the Warren District.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Oct. 18. Trading in
the stock market this market lost
none of its recent feverish activity,
tut the undertone suggested greater
caution, despite the extravagant oper
ations of cliques and other profes
sionals in speculative issues.
Admonitions from conservative fi
nancial interests concerning the ex
pansion ol credits were a natural cor
ollary of the further increase of brok
ers' loans. These, according to reports,
probably reached the high mark of the
mid-summer and were accompanied by
record loans and discounts at the
clearing house:
Call money several times rose to 15
per cent while time accommodations
became increasingly scarce with only
moderate offerings, available at 714
to 7 per cent for the shorter maturi
ties. These quotations were In striking
contrast to the easier rates which
marked extensive purchases of com
mercial peper by interior banks. Prime
indorsements ruled at 5 per cent, with
a 5 to 5 per cent rate for less ac
ceptable offerings.
The higher rates demanded of brok
ers and their clients resulted in part
from the payment of semi-annual in
terest on the 44 per cent on the
fourth Liberty loan, which involved an
outlay of almost $150,000,000.
Aside from the money stringency,
developments affecting the securities
market wer eregarded as more encour
aging, notably the better labor outlook.
The international financial situation
was again clouded, by another advarse
movement in foreign exchange on Lon
don and continental Europe and the
very unfavorable French foreign trade
balance for the eight months, of the
calendar year.
FEDERAL BANKS
"WASHINGTON, Oct. IS. Th condi
tion of the 12 federal reserve banks
at the close of business October 17,
ehowed that the ration of total reserve
to net desopit and federal reserve note
liabilities combined was 48.3 per cent,
and that the ratio of gold reserves to
federal reserve notes in circulation
after setting aside 3 Eper cent against
net deposits liabilities was 57.1 per
cent.
THECORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct.' 18. Bullish senti
ment regarding corn became more
widespread today and carried prices
up grade. The close was strong, lc to
2c higher, with December $1.26 to
$1.26 and May $1.24 to $1.24. Oats
gained c to c. In provisions,
the finish ranged from 60c decline to
45c advance.
Increasing reports from the interior
that farmers were Inclined to hold
back corn for more money had much
to do with the strength of tn eeorn
market. It was current gossfp that
failure of other commodities to fol
low grain down to lower levels had
especially Impressed growers, and had
led to general belief that corn was
selling too cheaply. Forecasts of un
settled weather tended also to en
courage buyers. Onthe other hand,
non-resumption of work on . the part
of longshoremen failed to act as an
offset and so too did weakness of for
eign exchange. Absence of aggressive
selling was a feature throughout the
day, although there was considerable
profit taking toward the close.
Oats paralleled th eaction of corn.
Rural offerings were light, but receipts
here for the week totalled 500,000
bushels In excess of the shipments out.
Provisions were bullishly affected by
the advance of grain. Later, however,
lard underwent a reaction because or
realizing sales.

CLEARING HOUSE
NEW YORK. Oct. 18. The actual

533,790 from last week.
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK. Oct. 18. The week on
the stock exchange ended very much
as It began, with another sharp ad
vance In motors and related Issues.

movement, relatively the most active
session of the week, thoutrh eans In
that quarter were less extensive.
Numerous "peace" Industrials were

Rails and steels were backward

Despite the week's activity In the
stock market, th ebank statement dis
closed th verv substantial decrease
of some $40,000,100 In actual loans and
discounts and another moderate gain
In exepss reserves.
General news of the dav renorted a
favorable turn in the impending coal
strike situation and progress in the
LEASED WIRE
plan to organize a vast railroad equip
ment organization.
Trade advices as a whole favored
the constructive side, although the
mercantile agencies noted a partial
halt in business in leading industrial
centers, this being confirmed by re
duced bank clearings.
The bond market was irregular on
the easier trend of high grade rails.
Liberty issues also reacting slightly.
