forts. (By Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO. Sept. 28. The feder
al government Today delivered a
second smashing blow at the law
less elements that have been ac-
tive in hindering the whole-hearted
prosecution of the war. The move
of the department of justice which
began weeks ago in simultaneous
raids on headquarters of the In
dustrial Workers jf the World
reached a climax with the indict
ment in the federal courts of 166
leaders and members of that or
ganization and the prompt arrest
of more than 100 of them, incluJ
ing William D. Haywood, the gen
eral secretary and treasurer. Hay
wood and the others were brought
in, in motor cars driven by so
ciety women, members of the navy
relief society who for weeks have
put their automobiles at the call
of agents of the department of jus
tice. Haywood was held in szb.UOO
bond and others in $10,000. Some
of those taken in the first raid
proved to be merely loungers
about the Industrial Workers 'of
ihe World headquarters and were
released after being examined.
CHICAGO, Sept. 28. Formal return
of a blanket indictment charging a nation-wide
conspiracy to hamper the
government during the war was made
today in the United States district
court here against 166 leaders Of the
Industrials of the World.
Arrests speedily followed. Almost
before the jury was discharged. Dep
uty marshals were on their way to Ihe
local I. W. W. headquarters in automo
biles donated and driven by women
and quickly returned to the federal
building with prb-Oners.
Haywood Among First.
In the first hour thirty-five men were
haled into the marshal's office and
questioned by department of justice in-ves-.igators.
Among the first to be
taken into custody was William D.
Haywood, secretary Of the national or
ganization of the L W. W.
An explanatory statement issued by
government attorney's who have di
rected the investigation of the sediti
ous conspiracy, the crime of which the
men named in the indictments are ac
cused, said:
"The prosecutions are under sec
tions 19 and 37 of the criminal code
and under the espionage act. Only
leaders in conspiracies or those per
sonally culpable in connection with
the perpetration of crimes against the
United States are Included as defend
ants." Jury Thanked.
To permit the sure arrest Of the in
dicted men no- hint of their names was
permitted to escape during court pro
ceedings which occurred only a few
minutes and consisted of a statement
from the foreman of the federal Jury
that its labors had been completed, the
handing Of a bulky sheaf of indict
ments to the clerk of the court and a
few words from Judge Evans thanking
the jurors for their sacrifice of time
and effort and assuring them they had
done their duty as citizens, a duty
which the court said was "quite as im
portant as any obligation which rests
on a citizen."
I. W. W.'s Singled Out
Vone but members of the I. W. W.
were indicted, government attorneys
taking pains to specify that no others
were touched.

Oxman Is Freed
and Rearrested;
Perjury Charged
'By Review Leased Wire).
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept, 28. Short
ly after the acquittal here tonigh: of
Frank C. Oxman on a charge of at
tempted subordination Vf perjury
growing out of the Thomas J. Mooney
bomb murder trial, a new warrant for
his arrest was issued at the instance
of Mrs. Belle Hanimerberg, a sister of
Mooney's wife. It was served on the
Oregon cattleman at his hotel.
The warrant charges perjury. Ox
man was permitted to confer with his
attorneys and he was then taken to the
city prison.
He was released on 12.500 cash bail
furnished by James H. Nichols of Ore
gon, his attorney. The bond calls for
him to appear in super.'or court tomor
row. The warrant did not state speci
fically in which trial he was alleged to
have perjured himself He has been
a witness in two cases here, the one
which resulted in Mooney's' conviction
and his own trial on a charge of at
tempted sulornation of perjury.
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 28. Fran
C. Oxman. Durkee, Ore., cattleman,
was acquitted tonight of a charge of
attempted subornation of perjury
growing out of the conviction of
Thomas J. Mooney on a murder charge
in connection with the Preparedness
parade bomb explosion here last year.
The jury deliberated one hour and
fifteen minutes. On the first ballot,
according to a juror, the Vote was elev
en to one for acquittal.
One Holds Out
"We would have reached a verdict
five minutes after we went out had it
not been for this one man," said the
juror. "He was won Over from his
conviction viewpoint after more than
an hour of argument."
Mrs. Oxman, wife of the acquitted
man shook hands with the jurors after
the verdict had been announced.
Attorneys Bitter.
James H. NicLOla personal attorney
for Oxman, and Samuel M. Shortridge,
who made the closing arguments for
the defense were bitter in their denun
ciation of F. E. Rigall, chief witness
for the prosecution.
Nicholas characterized Rigall as a
"wretch, a shark,, a confessed gambler
and a self-convicted perjurrer," and
charged him with "poitOning every
statement made by District Attorney
Fiskert, Assistant District Attorney
Cunha and Oxman for a price."
Nichols broke several bones in his
right hand when be brought it down
on the rail before the Jury box with a
hard blow. Shortridge, in his argu
ment said:
"Rigall is a confessed drunkard, a
brawler, gambler, bootlegger, and con
fidence man. He is not only a self
confessed liar but a perjurer as well.
Not one word has been introduced into
the testimony to impugn the honor ot
Frank C. Oxman."
Oxman was brought to trial Septem
ber 12. He was the principal witness
against Mooney.
Letters Unearthed.
After Mooney's conviction and sent
ence to death, attorneys for the defend
ants in the bomb murder cases un
earthed letters which Oxman had writ
ten to Rigall, asking him to testify
against Mooney. Oxman admitted
writing these letters but declared he
had added a postscript to one of them
directing Rigall not to come west un
less he had been in San Francisco July
22, 1916, the day of the explosion.
New Trial Denied.
As a result of publicity given the
letters State Attorney General Webb
filed a stipulation with the state su
preme court in which he consented to
a new trial for Mooney. The new trial
was denied on this stipulation, be
cause the court held it had no jurisdic
tion to act on such a document
Mooney's appeal, Dased on the record
of his trial, is pending.
President Wilson last May sent Gov
ernor Stephens a letter asking that ex
ecution be stayed until after Oxnian's
trial
Two others of the five defendants in
the bomb murder cases have been tri
ed. Warren K. Billings was sentenc
ed to life imprisonment and Mrs. Rean
MOoney, Thomas J. Mooney's wife, was
acquitted. Edward and Israel Wein
berg are to be tried in the near fu
ture. DESERTER CAUGHT.

LOCAL IN IS
CALLED OVER
SEASTOWORK
OF RED CROSS
William H. Brophy, Head of
P. D. Mercantile Comp'ny,
Goes to France In Service
of the United States.
William H. Brophy, general man
ager of the Phelps Dodge Mercantile
company, operating stores in Arizona
and New Mexico, and also president
of the Bank of Bisbee, vice president
ot the Bank of Douglas and a director
in other corporations, yesterday re
ceived word from Washington that his
offer to serve his country in Red Cross
work bad been accepted, and ne has
been ordered to report at New Yorkj
in time to sail for France the middle
of next month. Mr. Brophy plans
to leave here next week. He has
been granted leave of absence for the
term of the war by the Phelps Dodge
corporation, and therefore will not
permanently sever his connections
with the mercantile end of this com
pany's Arizona activities.
Received Word Yesterday
Some months ago Mr. Brophy de
cided that he would undertake to do
his bit for his country, so he offered
bis services to the government for
Red Cross work. Big men are needed
badly for the tremendous task ahead
of the government in France; men
of business and executive ability, as
well as fighters. Mr. Brophy's name
and proffer of services went forward
through the official channels. And
as a result a telegram came to him
from Washington yesterday inform
ing him that Major Grayson T. .Mur
phy," the president's representative in
France at the head of active Red
Cross work, had 'cabled requesting
that this Bisbee business man be sent
.over at once.
His particular task or post was not
assigned in the cable, but there is a
place and a need for him "over there."
and he will go.
Prominent in Southwest
William H. Brophy is regarded as
one of the best business men of the
Southwest. His keen mind and tire
less activity and long years of suc
cess in a big business- undertaking
have won for him his prominent place
!n Arizona business circles. Cochise
county people will note with satis
faction that he is only going away on
leave of absence, and that therefore
he will return with the end of the'
war and resume his duties in the city
where he has lived for so many years
and made so many friends. And they
will applaud his patriotic determina
tion to do something for his country
in this time of crisis, when every
arm and brain are needed to serve
the end that will result in final vic
tory. Son Is Away
Mr. Brophy's son, Frank C. Brophy,
is a second lieutenant in the new
National army and is now stationed at
Washington. The father will prob
ably beat his soldier boy to France.
The business of the Phelps Dodge
stores will be carried on the same
by Mr. Brophy's staff of assistants,
trained in his policies, and by his
methods and ideas.
Being a volunteer in this great work
of the Red Cross, Mr. Brophy goes
to France at his own expense and
without a salary of any kind. Just as
the big business and professional men
of many states of the Union are do
ing every day.
War Tax Bill Is
Ready for Houses
WASHINGTON. Sept. 28. Plans
were completed tonight for presenta
tion to congress tomorrow of the war
tax bill as revised upward by the sen
ate and house conferees to levy about
$7,700,000,000 more taxes.
Unexpected delays in perfecting the
draft upset the conferees' program of
completing the bill today, probably
postponing beginning of house debate
on the report until Monday. The bill's
enactment during the next week is
deemed certain. In preparing the bill
for final reprint, the conferees were
held up principally on the war excess I
profits section, in which ninny tech
nical verbiage changes were made.
The total assessment on war profits,
as made by the senate, $1,060,00').?,
was practically unchanged, a well as
the compromise system of calculating
such taxes previously agreed upon.

COLLISION
ENCOUNTER IN
LOWER HOUSE
ENDS DEBATE
OF INTEREST
Representatives Heflin and
Norton Come to Blows
Over AJabamian's Resolu
tion to Probe Disloyalty.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. Sept. 28. Hot de
bate, culminating in a physical en
counter between Representatives Hef
lin of Alabama and Norton of North
Dakota, was precipitated in the house
today by a report from the committee
that it bad decided not to art on any
resolutions for an inquiry into wheth
er members of congress have teea in
fluenced by German money.
At adjournment tonight the two bel
ligerents were clamoring for an op
portunity to address the houe, and
members who want an inquiry '.ere
striving to have one ordered in splie
of the committee's report. Discussion
will be resumed tomorrow with de
mands from both sides of the house
for invebtlgation of Mr. KefHi's
charges that several members have
not acted loyillv.
Committee's Reason
Chairman Pou explained In submit
ting the rules committee report that
an Inquiry would interfere wijh in
vestigation of use of German money
now being pushed by the department
of justice.
He said Representative Heflin had
not rt fleeted on the integrity of any
member of the house. Representative
Britten of Illinois, who bad been crit
cised by Mr. Hefllin for introducing
u measure to exempt German-Americans
from ni'litary service, shouted
that a resoUukt. to expel Hefllin
should be considered immediately.
Conservation Switched
In the midst of the storm Represen
tative Steenerson of Minnesota switch
ed the discussion to other business,
fcnd thenceforth, save for the few min
utes when Hefllin and Norton bad
their ntar-fight, th-s subject was not
broached until Just before adjourn
ment The clash started after Norton had
been refused time to reply to reports
Heflin had said he was disloyal.
It came most unexpectedly.
Enters Democratic Side
After failing to get the floor, Nor
ton went through the republican side
to the back of the house and walked
down the Democratic side until he
faced Hefllin, who was seated at a
table writing. Neither man greeted
the other, but after gazing steadily at
Heflin for a moment Norton spoke:
"Did you ever say at any time, or
give out any report to any one that
I was disloyal in this war?" he asked.
"No, I did not." Heflin replied.
There was a moment's fcilence, dur
ing which Norton continued to glare
at Heflin, who still was seated.
"Go back on your own side," said
the Alabama member.
' Til go back when 1 get ready,"
Norton responded.
Members Clash
Then Heflin rose, grasped, Norton
by the coat lapels and began back
ing hira toward a row of seats. Nor
ton, the lighter of the two by fifty
pounds, came back with a vigorous
push which drove the Alabama man's
back against seats across the aisle.
A moment later an assistant sergeant-at-arms
and several members pulled
them apart, while Sergeant-at-Arms
Gordon hurried down the aisle to dis
play his mace, the historic symbol of
authority, the mere lifting of which
is supposed to reduce to fear and
qul;t the most obstreperous.
Members flocked toward the scene,
many climbing over benches in their
haste. Some laughingly urged that
the combat be allowed to continue.
Representative Johnson of Ken
tucky, in the chair, pounded frantical
ly with his gavel and shouted for or
der. Republicans waived Back
Representative Heflin began to
waive back republicans, who, led by
Representative Cooper of Wisconsin
and Representative Baer of North Da
kota, were swarming across the divid
ing aisle to the democratic side.
"Go on back to your own side or
you will get hurt," he cried.
. "Take ofT your guns and you will
have a chance." replied Representa
tive Cooper.

Air Raid is Ineffective.
(By Review Leased Wire.
LONDON. Sept. 28. Hostile air
planes attacked the southeast coast
of England this evening.
A few of them attempted to reach
London, but failed. No reports of
casualties or damage have been re
ceived as yet. The official report
issued by Field Marshal French, in
charge of the aerial defense of Great
Britain, follows:
"Hostile aeronianes attacked the
ing. The raiders were reported from
various points along the coast in Suf
folk. Essex and Kent. The majority
of the raiders did not venture far In
land. A few of them headed toward
London, but failed to reach the me
tropolis. "Bombs were dropped in Suffolk.
Essex and Kent, but no reports re

yet."
When the air raid warning was is
ssued in London, everybody took to
cover in the usual way. They waited
two hours without haring the sounds
of a defensive gun or the bomb of a
raider, until it became evident the
GGerntan airmen bad been headed off
from the London area.
From the first telegrams received
from the coast the features cf the
air raid seem to have betn the in
tense volume of the defensive gun
fire and the speediness of the repulse
of the raiders. One dispatch says
there was a tremendous roar of guns
all along the Thames estuary. The
numberless batteries put up a regular
curtain of fire. British airplanes also
went up after the raiders and there
was considerable air fighting. Af'er
ward the firing gradually died away,
and the noise of the enemy's engines
grew faint as the an planes speeded
to sea.
One dispatch say., several bombs

neither damage nor casualties .

Allies Against
An Unrepentant
Teutonic Peace
(By Review Leased Wire)
LONDON', Sept. 28. Viscount Mil
ner, minister without portfolio in the
British war council, today at :he Amer-
(tremendous outburst when he said:
1 1 Ieel 'uor counir ana mine art-
1 now united by s-jmching far stronse
! than any Ti:t!n Pact or alliance
namely an absolute unity of motives
and aims."
Viscount Milner's speech obviously
was an answer to the peare talk which
has been filtering from Germany in
past weeks.
Viscount Milner continuod: !
uerman Justice. 1
"Our war aim is this: That the kind
of jus'.ice which Germany meted but to
Belgium shall in the future be impos
sible on this earth. In ,;he face of
that war aim nothing else matters."
After directing attention to the fact
that virtually three-quartois of the in-1
habited world was now alienated from j
ermany. Lord Milner said:
Moral Isolation. !
"eGrmany's piofund moral isolation
is begining to tell. Pin your faith as
much as you like to blood and iron,
there are material as well as moral dis
advantages for those who have fallen
outside the pale of the civilized com- f
munity. For a natfon which has tak-'
en so large a part in human inter-!
course and held so high a place in hu
mini advancement this is no light mat-'
ter. !
"There are signs this aspect is begin- J
ning to depress the spirits of the Ger-j
man people. That is why a new party
, has hcen called into beMng in Germany

Mexican Decree
May Close Mines
Of Rare Metals
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, Sept. 28. Mexico
has put an embarg'j on exports of
gold,, required that imported gold be
delivered for mintage within 60 days
and imposed additional restrictions VP
on the exportation of silver.
Ambassador Bonillas was notified
today that President Carranza Issued
the decree yesterday, effective imme
diately. EL PASO, Sept. 28. By presirfentia:
decree all gold shipped out of Mexico
in the form of mineral ores or concen
trates must be returned (to ' Mexico
withfn ten days of lis exportation In
bond and 25 per cent jf the value or
ail silver ore or concentrates must al
so be returned o: Mexico in the form of
gold bars, national or foreign gold
coins.
A c'ode copy of this decree was re
ceived here late today by Consul-Gen-eral
Guillermo M. Sequin and copies
given to the American mine-owners
having holdings in Mexico.
May Close Mines
Mining men here say it may mean
the abandonment of plans for re-opening
mines producing large vaules in
gold and silver and the c.'osing down
of those now in operation.
Prohibts Gold Exports.
The decree also prohibits the expor
tation of Mexican gold or silver coins,
gold in bars 'or any o:her forms 'of the
metals. The third clause in thei de
cree declares that exporters of min
eral ores or concentrates of all kinds
having more than six grams of gold
per ton will have to re-Import in gold
bars for coinage or in national or for
eign coins of equal value to the gold
contents according to the assay.
Must Re-Import Part.
Exporters of mineral ores or con
centrates containing over fifty grams
of silver per ton must re-import 25
per cent of the value of these ores in
the form of gold bars or coins. Export
ers must give bond for the re-importation
of the required amVmnt of gold
and this gold will be delivered to the
mint within thirty days after it Is re
imported. If this re-importation is not
made within ten days the bond will be
declared forfeited. 1
Future Is Black.
Mining men here tonight said it was
impossible to anticipate what the" ef
fect of the decree would have upon the
mining industry of Mexico. There is
now in effect an embargo against the
exportation of gold and silver from the
United States and they said this would
have t'j be lifted by means of special
licenses before any gold could be re
imported to Mexico . It would also
mean the retention in Mexico of every
ounce of gold produced, they said, mak
ing it difficult lVr the American-owned
companies to meet their obligations in
the United States.
In the meantime they said they
would make no effort to re-open their
mines until the decree was given a
trial.

"HONOR AND OBEY?"
SOUNDS INTERESTING
One woman against the world forms
the theme of the new William Pox
photoplay starring Gladys Brockwell,
"To Honor and Obey?" which is be
ing shown at the Eagle today and
tomorrow. In this production Miss
Crock ell, the "Girl of a Thousand
Expressions," fights against heart
breaking odds, and comes from the
fray weary hut victorious.
Her part is that of Lorrie Hollis,
whose marriuge to Hallam (Ben
Grassby) is not particularyy felici
tous. In an effort to save her hus
band from financial ruin, she goes to
the home of Patton (Charles Clary),
a broker and former suitor, and asks
him to let her husband win in the
stock market. This she does at her
husband's suggestion. She is morti
fied to learn that he thinks she has
rewarded Patton for agreeing to give
aid.
As Hallam's fortune begins to rise
be falls in with Rose Delvane (Jewe'
Carmen), a flirtatious salesgirl. Ills
interest in Rose increases, and it
finally gets a divorce from Lorrie,
claiming that she has been unf; it':-
ful.
Then f'.llows incident after inciden'
in swift succession, bringing Kil'.a:;:
to a just retribution and taking Lt.--
rie, after msny trials, safe into the

"Skinner's Dress Suit" is whole

Gildea adds the following stirring
words of praise and encouragement for
all good citizens of Bisbee:
"I have just returned from a two
months' visit to New England, New
Jersey, Washington and New Orleans,
and everywhere I went I found that
Bisbee was well known and admired
by every class of people that I met
I had the Review sent to me regularly
and it was eagerly looked for and
read by my friends as by myself. The
sheriff of New London county, Connec
ticut, '"Big Bill" Casey, grew to be a
great admirer of Sheriff Harry Wheel
er. He had had tee I. W. W.
troubles of his own recently and was
deeply interested in the methods by
which the Cochise sheriff drove the
wobblies out of the Warren District
and kept them away. My friends and
acquaintances everywhere borrowed
the Review as soon as it came and
they never brought it back; just pass
ed it ai'jund. The easterners ask
no better of their officials than to emu
late the great record of Harry Wheeler."

Saturday Morning, September 29, 1917.
Music has always appeared as the splendid side of
the terrible wars of the world. Napoleon had the finest
military bands obtainable and their martial strains in
spired the Old Guard and the hussars In every historic
charge. The Scots fight best to the lilt of the bagpipes.
American soldiers have always swung forward to march
ing songs, the last warsong of this country being the
famous "Hot Time" song in the Spanish war, and typical
of the American spirit. The English soldier's "Tipper
ary," that flourished in the beginning of the Great War.
is a companion piece to the "Hot Time' ditty. But the
song that both the Tommies and the Sammies will sing
to wind up the war promises to be "Over There," written
by George Cohen, the brilliant and successful American
Jew, who seems to be gifted with that touch of genius
that always knows how to touch the American heart in
just the right place. It is a typical, topical, timely song,
and has just the breath of recklessness and the touch
of sentiment necessary to win widespread favor. "And
we won't come back 'tiil its over, over there," sing the
C. S. soldiers as they march up the gangways to tho
troops') ips that sail with every tide.
The decision of W. H. Brophy, head of the Phelps
Dodge Mercantile company, and president of the Bank
of Bisbee, and regarded as one of the leading business
men of the southwest, to go to France to do his bit in
Red Cross work is typical of the man. Modest, unassum
ing, kindly, intensely patriotic, and taking a deep interest
in public affairs without any ambition to hold public
office. It has been known .for some time among his in
timate friends that he was most desirous of serving his
country in some way in this great crisis. His talent and
his long experience in business on a large scale will be
invaluable to the government in the great work it has
undertaken for the Red Cross in stricken France. The
biggest, brainiest men of the country have been called
from every line of endeavor to' help with the enormous
difficulties that stand like mountains in the way of
equipping and feeding and munitioning and nursing the
two million men we will call to arms before this war id
ended. The response of successful business men to this,
call has been wonderful. Past the age when the beckon
ing hand of adventure has any lure, they have left family
ties and business connections and bard won ease to en
gage in hard, driving, grinding work without recompense
and without glory. In fact, these volunteers from the
business world pay their own expenses, and give their
invaluable talents for the inestimable privilege of serv
ing their country in time of need. Too old to fight, too
young to stand by and see all this pressing activity and
need of strong men and not take a part. Bisbee has
given the best of her young men to the army for Franco
and is proud of her gift, and now she will soon have a
representative in Red Cross work in France of whom
6he will also be very proud.
CLEWS ON THE WAR.
Henry Clews, the New York banker, often quoted in
these columns because of big wide vision and deep In
terest in the country's affairs, writes this week on the
war in his usual optimistic vein as follows:
The new war revenue bill will soon be on the statute
books. Income taxation will be very heavy. But neither
this nor the excess profits tax will be as confiscatory as
some of the more radical members of congress have de
sired. We all must do our share in what will undoubted
ly always stand out prominently among the greatest
crises of the world. The staggering figures that are bo
ing granted in the form of appropriations, and the bond i
issues and the forms of taxation to provide for these ap
propriations, "all arc merely a measure of the determina
tion of the administration to bring to bear at once the
very utmost of our fightint efficiency. In order that tun
conflict may be brought as promptly as possible to 1
victorious close.
It Is no time for half measures. We have already
surprised the enemy by sending to France a considerable
army of clean-cut, intelligent men who are eager and
able to fight for democracy. We must continue sending
well equipped men until we have an army that will by
its strength, intelligence and determination convince
the enemy of the futility of continuing its losing struggle.
Preparation and more preparation cannot fail in this
way to prove the most effective means for conserving
the lives of our young men. Financial sacrifices must
be patriotically borne. The war must be won and aU
must do their bit.
Peace is in the air. Austria under its new ruler wants
peace. Political developments in Hungary this week
show a corresponding feeling in that division of the Dual
Kingdom. Bulgaria, too. it is reported in responsible
quarters, is desirous of beginning peace negotiations.
The German people ' earnestly desire peace. The Ger
man military machine still stands out apparently as de
termined as ever, obviously hoping for some development
that will permit It as victor to bring the war to a close.
This is a situation that cannot endure much longer.
Thus It behooves our country to bring forth at the earliest
possible moment every ounce of our fighting strength,
not alone in men, but in all other forms of our great na
tional wealth.
ADAM AND EVE PRUSSIANS.
The following letter, was written by a Prussian school
girl to a girl friend in Switzerland. It is natural to sup
pose that the views of the writer are reflected; at any
rate, they reveal, significantly, the direction In which the
young idea of Germany is trained to shoot. The little
lesson in Kultur was published in the Scot .'man:
FRANKFORT-ON-OD ER, 20th July, 1916. My Dear
Louise: The contents of your last letter would have
hurt me had I not known that your thoughts of our
glorious war resulted from sheer ignorance.
You are in a country rendered effeminate by the in
fluence of old fashioned ideas of liberty, a country which
is at least two centuries behind ours. You are in need
of a good dose of Prussian culture.
It is evident that you, a Swiss girl, with your French
sympathies, cannot understand how my heart, the heart
of a young German girl, passionately desired this war.
Speaking of it some years ago, my father said to us:
"Children, Germany is getting too small for us; we shall
have to go to France agpip in order to find more room."
It Is our fault that France will not understand that more
money and land are necessary for us?
And you reproach us that our soldiers have been very
cruel to the Belgian rabble, and you speak also of the de
struction of Reims, and of the burning of villages and
towns. Well, that Is war. As in every other undertak
ing, we are past masters in the making of war.
You have a great deal to learn before you can come
op to our standard, and I can assure you that what has
been done so far is a mere bagatelle compared with what
will follow.
As a matter of fact, there is but one race worthy o!
ruling the world, and which has already attained the high
est degree of civilization. That race Is ours, the Prus
sians; for though we Germans in general are the lords
of the world, the Prussian is ' undoubtedly the lord par
excellence among the Germans.
All other nations, and among them, untortunately, the
Swiss, are degenerate and of inferior worth. That is why
I have always been so proud of being a true Prussian.
Yesterday, again, our pastor explained to us convinc
ingly that our first parents, Adam and Eve, were also
Prussian. That is quite easy to understand, because the?
Bible tells us that the German God created us all after
his own image. If, then, all men are descended from
Adam and bis wife, it follows that only Prussians, or at
least Germans, ought to exist in the world, and that I'
who push on and prosper ought to belong to us. You
must admit that that is logic, and that is why our motto
is, "God with us, Germany above everything."
You know now why we wished this war. Is it not
shameful that other nations, who have no right to exist
ence on earth, wish to diminish our Tieritagcl We are
the devine fruit, ard the others are only weeds. Thai
Is why our great emperor has decided to put an end .e
all these injustices, and to extirpate the weeds. Do you
understand that now?
I remain, your school friend,
KATIE HAM FX.
SHORTSIGHTED BAKERS.
A trade paper representing the baking industry for
sees grave "danger" in the prospect of a cheaper loaf of
bread. It pleads with "short-sighted" bakers to refrain
from baking 5-cent leaves and thereby injuring them
selves and the entire industry."
Meanwhile, figures compiled by the producing bakers
themselves show that the cost of the various materials
that go to the making of a one-pound loaf of bread, such
as now sells yearly everywhere for 10 cents, is a trifle
over 4 cents. That estimate is arrived at as follows:
A barrel of flour costs $11.00; two pounds of yeas'
cost 50 cents; three pounds of salt cost 4 12 cents; five
pounds of sugar cost 45 tents; four pounds of larj cost
80 cents; total, $12.73 12. That quantity of material
makes 312 loaves of bread, making each loaf tost 4 110
cents. It is said that this estimate is really a little too
high, because bakers have not been paying quite so much
for flour and sugar as the figures given indicate. There
are disinterested experts who put the cost of the mater
ials in' a pound loaf today as low as 4 cents.
Tbe bakers, reckoning this basic cost at 4.1 rents per
loaf, add an equal amount for cost of production and
profits, selling tbe bread to the retailer at about 8.:.'
cents per loaf. The retailer makes the difference be
tween that figure and 10 cents.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
TIME GOES ON.
Another summer's looped the loeps;
now Autumn round the doorway
snocps. Now, Autumn's strictly a sue-!
cess, and all her b'Jiden days I bless. I
She brings a soothing balm and sweep '
for people wearied by the heat; she
veils herself in purple haze, and brings
night and pleasant' days, and gives the
woods a crimson tint, and hues too
wonderful to print. She is a daisy
while she lasts, but soon she lets In
wintry blasts; too b'oon, too soon she
wilts and droops; another summer's
looped the loops,' Another summer's
slipped away' And we have grown a
bit more gray; we-ve traveled further
ou ;he road that leads to where we'll
drop the iVad. I take my m.rror auo
behold fresh symptoms that I'm wax
ing old. My eye that once shed steely
stares thet tamed the hearts of griz
zly bears, no more sends forth a daz
zling glance, no more it gleams liko
polished .ance, or like a falchion from
its sbeaih, and I am wearing Wooden
tech. So fast the seasons scamper
by! While we're complaining of July,
we hear November at the door, and
winds are chill and frost is hoar. Time
hurries on and scatters year; perhaps
our wailing voice he hears, but doesn't
care lor it three whops another sum
mer's looped the loops.

Douglas, has received a letter from
some of the Douelas boys who went
to France with the Sixth Field artil-
ery. telling about the trip across tho
ocean, during which they saw a sub
marine and came near battling a
French fleet by mistake. It s a decid
edly interesting letter. The boys were

New York and they say they made
New York wake up. The letter fol
lows: At Sea, August 13, 1917.

At a little to'.vn in Missouri they
showed us a fine time. The girls
brought baskets of flowers and ap

And never in our experience had we
ever had so much fun. Every minute
vas taken up in one pleasure or an
other.
The Y. W. C. A. gave each boy a
basket filled with everything you can
bink of to eat, smoking of all kinds,
matches and a box of candy. Then
we marched to Lnke Michigan, each
of us with a girl. There we stayed

and we were not allowed to spend &

Did we step? Does a fish swim? Four
saloons and two swell cafes and rlenty
of waiters.
"Oil. hoys!" When we were finally
rounded up some went auto riding,
some on street cars or cabs, some
walked, but we got to the boat, and
here we had another surprise. Every -'

Then the trip across.
The first day passed quietly. Seem

Describing the various kinds of pa
cificists in this country, Mr. Roosevelt
said that sonie of the leading opostles
of applied pacificism are not timia
men, but, on the contrary, they are
brutaL violent men, who are perfectly
willing to fight, but only for ;hem
selves, and not for the nation. These
rough-neck pacificists," he said, "have

Ties Up Shipbuilding.
The strike has tied up J150.000.000
worth of shipbuilding and engine con
tracts. Army officers here issued
statement today saying it was the
consensus of opinion among officers
stationed at the Presidio that the
strike of metal trades workers was
prolonging the war.
Mr. Burton's statement, ordering
the men back to work was:

is concerned, the tentative agreement
has been accepted and the members

go back to work. I have been assured
who typify the unlovely senile side
of civlization. The rough-r.eck pa
cificist, on the contrary, is a mere be
lated savage, who has not been edu
cated to the virtues of national patn-1
otism and of willingness to fight for
the national flag and the national
ideal." 1
Mr. Rooselevtl continued:
Duty of Citizen
"If a man does not wish to take
life, but does wish to serve his coun
try, let him serve on board a mine
sweeper or in some other position
where the dancer is to his own life
and not to the life of aDy one else.
But if he will take no useful or tfii-1
cient part in helping in tLis war, in I
running his share of the common risk, I
and doing his part of the common'
duty, then treat him hb having for
feited his right to vote, his rieht to
render at the polls any decision which
l the long run can only be made
good in the fare of brutal and hos'ilc
men by he ability and willingness of
good citizens to back right with
might."
Such a man, Mr. Roosevelt insisted,
who claims citizenship, but is not
willing to perform the neressary du
ties, is not entitled to any. of the
rights of citizenship, saymg:
Service to Nation
"Service to the nation in war s'ands
by the conference committee of the
Califronia Metal Trades association
and California Foundrymen's associa
tion that all shops will open tomor-
1 row, ready to resume work."
! The following notice to members of
tie two employers association was
sent out by the conference committee,
with approval of the president of the
metal trades association:
"We have agreed with representa
tives of the Iron trade councils that
all shops will open for work Saturday
morning. In accordance with th
above agreement, please open your
shops. This notice concels all pre
vious notices,"
Army Is Heard.
The United States army .was heard
from today in connection with the
strike of 30.000 iron workers here in
a statement issued by army officers
that it was the "concensus of opin
ion" among army officials here that
the present strike was prolonging the
war.
"Any serious obstruction of govern
ment shipping sets back in day.-,
weeks and months that victory which
is essential on land and sea to ef
fect peace," the statement declared.

Supporting Germany j
Roosevelt said that any workingraan ;
today, whether he be on the farm or J
in the shop, who supports Germany,
"is not only playing the pari of a
traitor to the L'nitMi States, but is
playing the pan of traitor to the
whole spirit of democracy throughout

The speaker asserted that the so

tool of German autocracy and the en
emies of liberty. I
Draft System Wrong
A plea for universal military obli

who said the selective draft system ;

T. Rennie, general audit fer the rom
i p;niy, said no demands have been
made so far.
The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev
olutionized in the past few years through the introduction and
perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo
mically, in any dwelling, large or small.
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort ind
at a reasonable cost for gas.

THE BISBEE DAILY REVIEW, SATURDAY MORNING, SEPTEMBER 29, 1917.
1 Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK, Sept. 28. To what
extent the government's proposed un
limited bond issue acted as an influ
ence over today's stock market gave
rise to much debate. The forthcom
ing offer or the treasury department
was engrossing topic among bankers,
while securities experienced further
professional pressure and drastic
liquidation.
As an offset. Liberty 3V loomed
up formidably, attaining to the new
maximum of 100.24 on sales which
comprised the greater part of the day's
business in bonds. Rails were the
weakest shares, high-grade issues
showing extreme losses of two to four
points.
United States Steel varied between
1084 and 1104. its final price of
109 showing a net loss of point
Sales amounted to 540,000 shares.
Money yelded none of its stringency,
call loans holding at 6 per cent until
all demands had been met, while nom
inal amounts of time funds were
placed at the same rate.
Internatio'nsls as well as domestic
bonds were irregularly lower, the Lib
erty issues, however, selling from
100.4 to 1000.24. Total sales, par val
ue, $6,150,000. United States bonds,
old issues, were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 28. Official refer
ences to the 1917 corn crop as the
greatest ever brought to harvest had
a noticeably bearish effect today on
the market. Prices closed heavy, 2
to 2c net lower at 1.17 to 1.17
December, and 1.14 to 1.14 for
May. Oats finished to lc off to lc
up. Provisions showed a setback vary
ing from 2 to 50c.
Lowest prices in corn came just be
fore the en? of the session, and fol
lowed reports that the assistant sec
retary of agriculture declared the
Unted States this season !iad surpass
ed all previous achievemnets in the
amount of torn which had been
raised.
There were forecasts of a prolonged
period of mild temperature through
out the corn belt.
Urgent seaboard demand with
month-end evening-up of traders put
strength into the spot delivery or
oats. Other options weakened wltn
corn.
Packers' selling carried down pro
visions and was offset in part by en
larged commission house buying.
COTTON MARKET. "
NE WYORK, Sept. 28. The cotton
market today closed steady at a net
decline or 9 to 20 points.
METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, Sept. 28. Lead, dull;
spot, 812. Spelter, easy; suot East
St. Louis delivery, 812 to 837. Bar
silver, 97.
LIBERTY BONDS ACTIVE
XEW YORK. Sept. 28. Trading in
Liberty bonds at quotations running
from 100.4 to the new high premium
of 100.24 was a feature of the stock
exchange. Sales aggregated about
$5,330,000, or almost 90 per cent of
the bond market's operations.
Among dealers the greater activity
and the enhancement were attributed
to the announcement of the treasury
department's intention to create a new
bond for an unlimited amount at 4
per cent

NEW YORK. Sept. 28. The mar
ket was reactionary and closed gen
erally lower. Quite a few stocks were
accumulated recently by the profes
sional element on the idea that the
list would not permitted to sag ma
terially, owing to the near approach
of the new loan offering. Therefore,
as very little interior buying devel
oped, and as there occurred a renewal
of scattered liquidation In some of
the rails, general liquidation was con
ducted on a rather fair scale. Taken
as a whole, however, the market did
not present an appearance of distinct
weakness, and while this backing and
filing may be H;countered for a while,
still we beiiee that the course of
least resistance will be found to be
on the buying side.

The effort of the Germans was fruit
