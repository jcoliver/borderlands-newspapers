"The base hospital is unfurnished,
without water, plumbing or sewerage
connections. I recommend that tele
graphic instructions be sent to the
division commander at once to put in
plumbing, water and sewer connec
tions and electric cookers in all the
wards.
"I think the recommendations I
have made will tend to correct the
existing sanitary conditions, but I can
not urge too strongly that they be put
into effect at once. The camp si;ca
and surroundings are all that can be
desired. The troops and general con
ditions are good, with the exception
of such conditions as relate to tut
epidemic diseases at present prevail
ing." At Funston
At Camp Funston. the 89th national
array division, there have been 43
deaths from pneumonia, with 1S9
rases and -2 deaths from meningitis,
with 70 cases.
"This Indicates the most serious
condition as far as affection from
meningitis and pneumonia is con
cerned," General Gorgas said.
"As emphasizing the situation. I call
attention to the fact that they had 84
deaths from all causes when the nor
i rial death rate of such a command
should be about 12." i-
Meningitis Prevalent
The chief genera! reports that
among the S6.f00 drafted men inject
ed into the cantonment in October
were many meningitis carriers, this
rart of the country being known, he
says, to all health officers as having
been for. several years the principal
epidemic center in the civil population
for meninzitis.
General Gor?as recommends obser
vation camps, the relieving of over
crowded conditions, the oiling of near
by roads to keep down the dust and
the erection and heating of ambulance
sheds to cbviate the present diffScul
ties found in getting the motor ambu
lances started during the cold weath
er, because cf the freezing of the wa
ter in t?-e radiators.
Camp Sevier Serious
Sanitary conditions at Camp Sevier,
in the T.Oth guard division, are de
scribed by General Gortas as seriotfi.
Sixty men have died of pneumonia in
the last month and the camp has been
exposed to a several epidemic of mea
sles; about J"00 cases have occurred
during the month. During the month
there have been 175 cases of pneumo
nia and IS cases of meningitis.
The basic cause of unsanitary con
ditions, the report continues, is over
crowdine as the result of the short
age of tentage. From 11 to II men
had to be pat in each tent, with about
20 square feet to each man. General
Gorgas recommends that no addi
tional men be sent to this camp until
the division commander says he is

During the past month at Camp ClllUrl ijl V6

deaths; 316 cases of measles and 1
death: 104 cases of diphtheria, with
1 death, and S of meningitis, with 4
deaths. Overcrowding is ascribed by
the report as the basic cause. To con
trol the spread of these diseases the
general recommends that suspects he
immediately removed from the gen

and placed In a separate detention

Many wards in the base hospitals

caused great embarrassment to the
hospital authoirties. Installation of

XEW YORK. IV IS. Apart from
the additional ground yielded by mapy
eenrities. especially bonds, today's
session of the stock exchange was
meaningless. The market lapsed into
somnolence after the first hour but
displayed moderate activity toward
the end, when steels, coppers, ship -
pinR3 and a few -specialties showed
Sains of one to two points.
Disappointment was a pain expres
sed at the absence of definite word
from 'Washington anent the railroad
problem and rumors of new foreign
offerings In the coming year accounted
In part for the lower records of ex
latins Issues of that class.
Recessions in the international bond
list ranged from fractions to almost
two per cent for Anglo-French 5s and
2?i per cent for United Kingdom is
sue of 1921
Foremost among the domestic bonds
which broke to new low ground were
issues of anion and Southern Pacific.
Lake Shore, St. Paul. Pennsylvania,
Reading and minor coalers. The list
also embraced United States Steel
6's. United State Rubber 5's and Arm
our 4i's. Sales 325.000 shares.
Call loans eased perceptibly, al
thoush six per cent was again the
ruling rate. Time funds lost none
of their firmness.

CHICAGO. Dec. 18. Corn prices
developed strength today owing to an
unexpected falling off in country ad
Tices of shipments. The market clos
ed firm H to He net higher with Jan
uary U.21", and May I1.19 to V
Oats gained 4 to lc. The outcome in
provisions was a setback of 20c to
60c
At first the corn market had a
downward slant as a result of con
tinued mild weather. The fact. how;
ever, that as ret no decided enlarge
ment of the number of arrivals had
taken place tended to make sellers
cautious, notwithstanding, that a gov
ernment order which stops the man
ufacture of Industrial alcohol, from
any kind of corn exctt sample grade
was generally construed as a bearish
factor. Later, the scarcity of rural
notices of consienments led to a good
deal of comment, and durine the last
hour there was a somewhat vigorous
upturn in values.
' Signs of export business at he sea
board helped the oats market to ral
ly. Heavy deliveries on contracts and
local sales were- the main sources of
temporary weakness.
Over abundant supplies of hogs

This is one of the best opportuni

Thrift Stamps instead of the usual
things they have been indulged in in
time of peace. They should be shown
how much good they may do for our
boys t the front. ; The money they
spend for Thrift Stamps may save the
lives of many boys, who might never
come h'ome without the help of the
children in this savings campaign.
While the children are helping to
save the lives of our boys, they are
saving money for themselves in after
years. They will be twice glad.
As an investment for wage earners,
this is the best offering the govern
ment has made. War Savings Cer
tificates are free of all taxes and
yield an income of 4 per cent com

As a Christmas present they would
serve a double purpose. The person
receiving them will get better than

have the use of the money to buy sup-

THE DOUBLE EDGE.
Lord Lansdowne. -British peer, has stirred the" Eng
lish speaking world with his "peace" letter, published in
the London Telegraph. It is not the purpose of The Re
view to discuss the merits or demerits of the letter.
Lloyd George, premier of Great Britain, disposed of that
angle. It is our purpose, however, to point out some of
the uses to which Lansdowne's letter is being put in
this country. Surely the Lord did not know his words
would be used against his class. On the other hand, it
is wery probable that if his end should be gained he
would care little. -But
witness:
Under the title of "The British Oligarchy and Peace."
the Irish World tradarer of American liberty in Its
opaque sedition prints an editorial on the Lansdowne
letter, based on a letter from an alleged American by
the name of Frank Harris, who sees in the peer's words
a desire for peace on the part of the British aristocracy.
The Irish World "piays up" the Harris letter which
has as its object the overthrow of the Lloyd George gov
ernment or the discrediting of it In the United States.
The Irish World is anti-English; the paper has been fight
ing for "something" for Ireland. Just now it Is engag- j
ed in a tirade against British justice when it deals with
treason in the form of Sinn Fein policies.
We quote from tb Irish World, which quotes from
the Harris letter:
"It is absurd to believe that a man of bis (Lansdowne)
position would make statements to the press, not speak
ing' in the first person, but in the name of Great Britain,
if be did not regard himself the spokesman of England.
And he certainly would i.ot assume the position he did in
his letter if he hadn't been sure that his statements were
endorsed by the Tories wliose leader he Is today. He was
so sure that be even did not consult the government.
"His message was a slap in the face of Lloyd George.
Lloyd George is in Paris at present, and it is not un
likely that Lord Lansdowne's subsequent statement, that
he had spoken as a private person, quite for himself,
personally, was caused by an intervention of tbe king
iimself."
Mr. Frank Harris characterizes the Lansdowne let
ter L il T UIUBI ?ICVC Ul UC M a I 1 II V C VI lur
little island, which has caused so much sorrow and pro
duced so many good citizens, be better or worse? By
the World's own acknowledgment inferred if you w ill
the yoke of Ireland will become tighter.
It Is necessary, therefore, to look for other reasons to
cause the Irish World to reprent the Harris letter and
give it such prominence and editorial preference. If
Lloyd George is the best friend Ireland has at the British
bar at present, why do Irishmen condemn him? Why
does the Irish World sneer (with Harris and the Hearst
papers) at him and his aims to reduce Germany to a
standstill in Us effort to Prussianize the universe?
Can it be that the Irish World is actually seditious?
If Lansdowne is the representative of the British "in
visible government," the iniquitous inner circle of Eng
lish landlords and the privileged class, why should the
Irish World desire the overthrow of a liberal form of gov
ernment and the substitution of one of Lansdowne's mak
ing? Which government is better for Ireland and Ire
land's people?
The answer is not far off. The Irish World, like many
of the foreign language papers and a few of the other
papers, desires a German victory. By its propaganda it
desires the United States to allow the Hun his conquests
and his Kultur. The World desires the overthrow of the
most efficient English cabinet the war has produced. In
short, it desires to tear the entente allies to shreds and
win the war for tbe central powers and against the
United States, a victory.
Surely the Irish World and Its editorial offices would
be a prolific ground for governmental investigation.
THE OTHER TEN PER CENT
No less personage than Vice President Thomas Mar
shall, in an interview in Washington several days ago.
made the declaration that "Ninety per cent of the citi
zens of German blood in this country are loyal and ar
good Americans." Some authorities would reduce the
percentage given by the vice president. In any event,
however, the question which rises is not the percentage
but, what to do with the disloyal remainder.
It Is variously estimated that there are 10,000KKi Ger
mans or German-Americans in the United States. V
Vice President Marshall is correct 1.000.000 of the total
are disloyal to the country ot their adoption and, in many
cases, their birth. The bare figures ten per cent have
little meaning for the average man nntil reduced to actual
and understandable totals. Consider 1.000.000 men and
women just for a moment!
' Such a number is one per cent of the -entire citizen
ship of .the United States; Including men, women and
children, native and foreign born, alien and citizen.
Such a number is nearly the figure of men the United
States has in training for war purposes at the present
time. Is it not a formidable array, especially when the
million will do the kaiser's bidding?
Just now the leaders of this country's war against
Germany, are busy with many things. The people of the
country the loyal people are inclined to impatience
over the apparent sluggishness of movement in many
things. One of the things criticised is the slowness of
action in tlie stamping out of resident sedition. It is the
opinion of many that congress, by one action, tan stamp
out the evU.
Eliminate the f orei qn language press the enemy'
language press!
Such an action to many may seem extreme. It may
seem exceptional and unwarrantable, at this time. Some
may even call it the limit of provincialism- and narrow
ness. But the cause is an extreme one; the needs are
extreme and extreme treasures must be taken to stamp
out the evil which is besetting the government and the
people at this time.
In the first place the German language press of the
United States is peddling its sedition in every issue.
There are several exceptions to the statement, but thev

is an intimation that the British aristocracy is in favor of f is considered as a whole. The Kulturistic propaganda, in

figJiters. had declared that the war must go on to a storff and his aids, is accomplishing its purpose. It is
tbe most insidious influence the nation has to combat at
the present moment.
Can a German-American of a German imagine an Eng-
llie fighting till Germany is annihilated; on tbe other
side, the leader of the Tory element believes that the
time lias come for negotiating terms of peace that mill
be acceptable to Germany. The question arises. what has
occurred that has made the representative of tbe Tory
clement become a pacifist over nigbt? Here is Mr. Frank
Harris' explanation of this. sudden convention: "Since
Colonel House's arrival :n London it has become plain
to Lord Lansdowne that if he does not take the settle
ment in hand. President Wilson will John or Jona
than is the question and be fears, that If Presi
dent Wilson has control of the business he will In
sist, sooner or later on a demociatic peace,
which would not at all be to liking of
tbe British oligarchy. He might presume to tell the
governors of Britain that freedom must be accorded to

demanding an lrith republic. He might assert that
Egypt should be governed by Egyptians or even Lord
Lausdowne does not prooose to have any su'h democratic
interference with bis rciuie. He intends to make him
self aud England the dictator f the peace conditious; b
refuses to allow President Wilson to direct the war
measures or control the final issues."
If the writer of to letter in qu-tion is correct in
his surmises that the Lloyd George guveruojeot is tot
tering and that Laiiodune. as a representative of the
British oligarchy, is to suceed the comiuoor in the
leadership cf Prltlsli ikm'M-s. what will be the HrHicii
of Ireland? Will the Irish people aud Uie 1-oau'ifuJ
knockout Lord Lansdowne. in antagonizing this view,
says that the prolongation of hostilities will lead to "the
ruin of the civilized world." The issue is joined. On
one side the premier advocates the policy of keeping up j ,,!,n PP" one of the German cities publishing news
and editorial matter, comparable to that published in
this country by tbe German press? It would be suicidal
in the first place. The kaiser does not tolerate it ; nor
does the German empire.

what they read In tbe foreign language press. It is hut

RELIEF ASSOCIATION
APPEALS TO WARREN
DISTRICT FOP, HELP
Old Clothes are Wanted By
Relief Body With Which to
Help the Poor In Communi
ty Cases are Needy.
The Warren District Relief associa
tion met December 8 and decided to
make a special appeal for clothing for
the poor. A number of widtiwj ana
deserted mothers are dependent on the
association for clothes, especially for
children for school wear. There are,
as usual during the winter, several
sick persons, recently come into the
district, who have no claims Vn the
community, but come to the board for
clothing and temporary aid.
Since September 1 nine tubercular
cases have received aid. as well as 22
families. 11 of which were Mexican,
but In nearly every case the distress
was caused by illness, death or deser
tion of the family. The second-hand
clothing supplied is a great he'.p. If
those who have clothing i'j donate for
the local work will telephone Miss
Esther Cummins at the office of the'
association. No. 443, it will be called
for at any time.
The matter of supplying special
Christmas donations for the needy was
discussed at the meeting, when it was
decided that it would be best i'j supply
only the absolute necessities, but toyt
and other small articles that would
help to make the poor children happy
at the Christmas season will be gladly
reeclved and given where they will be
appreciated.
A few weeks ego a ycung Mexican
woman was found in the depot with a
little two-year-old girl. S.'ie had com?
off the El Paso train, she said, cl-im-el
V) be a widow and had been work
ing .'or a family in El Paso until sue
mas taken ill. mhea she was given Ler
ticket to Bisbee.
A little later she was found in t
Mexican home, too ili to help herself,
so that it tell upon the association to
see that she was cared for, as it was
evident tht she could not live long.
The little girl, Saladad. was placed in
another home temporarily, the nV-ihe:
having given her over to the associa
tion, asking that she be adopted into
another home. The mother died on
Friday last, and on the same day a
good home in Tucs-n was found for
little Saladad.

BUILDING SIDE TRACK.
The E. P. & S. W. railroad company
has a large force ofmen and teams
at Osborn grading for a new side
track on the North side of the depot.
It will be used b y the large ore trains
going down to Douglas and will run
from a point above the present switch
to a point about a mile and a half
east of Oborn. The track was put
in to take additional switching room
at that place and also as a safety
first plan. The heavy ore trains go
ing down are difficult to handle and
should one get away and a passenger
train or two was on the siding there
would be nothing le;t of it when the
ore cars got through. With the new
track in this danger will be avoided.
