ITHER
DEFENSE SYSTEM
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN
FRANCE, Oct. 18 (Ly the Associated
Press). A new German line of de
fense from Antwerp through Namur
to Sedan which undoubtedly will be
given the name of the Wotan III line
is understood to be in Uie course of
construction. On this side of the line
the Germans do not appear to have
any defense of real importance. It
is considered likely that the main
bulk of the German armies, or rather
what is left of the main bulk in this
section of the front, is on its way to
the Wotan III line, though it is quite
possible it may try to make a stand
somewhere on this side of these posi
tions. -
It would appear from the maimer in
which the Germans are being driven
from France southeast of Duuai and
east of Lille that his troops hope to
find refuge in this section of the front
behind the line of the L' Escaut river
as it curves between Tourani and An
danard. The river line obviously is
the only place the enemy can possibly
i hope to gain time to catch his breath
in this whole area.
In Belgium the day has been occu
pied principally in line straightening.
The lines now pivot on Bruges, one
running generally to the coast near
Ostend and the second sloping off to
the southeast. Heavy fighting was ro-
"ly f
was at Oostroosebeke, south of
fhij
Thielt.
The Belgians wanted the town and the
ground nearby as the Germans were
holding it as a sort of salient. So the
Belgians went out and fought for it
and after a furious battle the bullet
riduifcd enemy took to his heels.
Now the Belgians have the salient.
North of the Sensee river the British
formations In which are included Can
adians, are advancing with a speed
which seems to increase constantly.
For many miles north of the river it
is only with the greatest of difficulty
that the British manage to gain con
tact now and then with the fleeing
enemy so fast is the enemy going
east.
North of Turcoing and Roubaix the
British also are moving rapidly. Just
south of these important twin cities

Says Premier Clemenceau

Epochal Meeting Today;
Crowds Massed on Streets
PARIS, Oct. 18. (By the Associated
! Press.) "Our victory does not spell
revenge." said Presiier Cleniencau
i amiil scenes of indescribable enthu-
ccn.-riPnre.
Paris has lived historic days since
the beginning of the war, but never
since these dark days of August, 1914,
has Paris lived such a day as this.
C'cmenceau looked the tiger of old
when he a
flight of vie
ascended the tribune, the
tory shining on his whole
countenance.
Lon-; before the hour set for the
opening of the chamber huge crowds,
overflowing across the Seine to the
Place de la Concorde, had gathered.
Kver' seat in tne chamber was oceii
pied, except those where the Frencn
flag entwined with the crimson plush
of a vacant chair showed that the for
mer occupant had died that he had
served his country not alone in the
chamber of deputies, but on the field

After Paul Deschanel, president of
the chamber, told of the liberation of
Lille, Douai. Ostend and Bruges, and
while the deputies and audience were
cheering frantically, Clemenceau arose
from the government bench and made
his way to the tribune with the dust
of Lille still clinging to his garments.
"Can I add anything to the patriotic
words of the president of the cham
ber," said the premier, "except that I
have just received a telegram (and he
waved a 'blue leaflet toward the depu
ties) stating that Roubaix and Tur
coing have just been liberated."
There was not one discordant voice
in the whole chamber, but two con
spicuous socialist members remained
seated while the other deputies ap
plauded. "There should be but one voice."
said President Deschangel, glaring at
the socialists. They sheepishly arose
and the incident was closed.
Recollections of that other historic
scene on Juae 5. when an irate cham
ber demanded explanations from this
same premier for the defeat on the
Chemin des Dames came back to the

REFUSE TO FIGHT
BRITISH HEADQUARTERS IN

the neighborhood of Heule and Cuerne,
north of Courtrai, entire German regi
ments flatly refused to fight, although
threatened with severe punishment by
their officers. These regiments final
ly retired in a body.
Frcm prisoners, especially officers,
similar evidence is being obtained
constantly. The officers of the 20th
dragoon regiment of the crack sixth
cavalry division, which had been dis
mounted and fought as infantry, say
that the spirit of the men was broken
principally because of getting but a
short rest after their hard fighting
they had again been sent into bat
tle. "Peace talk" is also said to be hav
ing a demoralizing effect on the mo
rale of the men, gradually breaking

PROMULGATE CONSTITUTION
WASHINGTON, Oct. IS. Independ
ence of the Czecho slovak nation was
declared formally today by the Czecho
slovak national council, recognized
by tho United States and the entente
allies as a belligerent delacto govern
ment. The declaration, renouncing al
legiance to the Hapsburg dynasty and
announcing principles for the founda
tion of a republic, was issued in Paris
and a copy was handed to President
Wilson by J. Cisar. of the council's
staff in Washington.
The document, after announcing the
independence of the Czecho-Slovak na
tion and reviewing the events leading
up to this event, continues:
"We cannot ana will not continue to
live under the direct or indirect rule
of the violators of Belgium, France
and Serbia, the would-be murderers
of Russia and Rumania, the murderers
of tens of thousands of civilians and
soldiers of our Diood, and the accom
plices in numberless unspeakable
crimes committed in this war against
humanity by the two degenerate and
irresponsible dynasties. We will not
remain a part of a state which has no
justification for existence, and which,
refusing to accept the fundamental
principles of modern world organiza
tion, remains only an artificial and im
moral political structure, hindering
every movement toward democratic
and socialist progress. The Hapsburg
dynasty, weighed down by a huge in
heritance of error and crime, is a per
petual menace to the peace of the
world, and we deem it our duty toward
humanity and civilization to aid in
bringing about its downfall and de
struction. "We reject the sacreligious asser
tion that the power of the Hapsburg
and Hohenzollern dynasties is of di
vine origin; we refuse to recognize
the divine rights of kings. Our na
tion elected the Hapshurgs to the
throne of Bohemia of its own free
will aud by that same right deposes
them. We hereby declare the Haps
burg dynasty unworthy of leading our
nation and deny all of their claims to
rule in the Czecho-Slovak land, which
we here and now declare shall hence
forth be a free and independent people
and nation.
"We accept and shall adhere to the
ideals of modern democracy, as they
have been the ideals of our nation
for centuries. We accept the Amer
ican principles as laid down by Presi
dent Wilson; the principles of liberat
ed mankind of the actual equality of
nations and of governments deriving
all their justice power from the con

WELL ORDERED
IS THE GERMAN
WITHDRAWAL
Army Officials Admit German I
Staff Is Conducting Suc
cessful and Skillful Retreat
So Far; May Yet Crack
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTOX. Oct. 18. While
German retirement in Belgium has
glittering possibilities, military opinion
here Is forced to the conclusion that
j what ,s ,n process is a well ordered
at..t vMitvl lvirhHrnu-al nrnhnhlv
upon prepared positions. The fact
l that reports from other portions of
the front, notably from the Lille area
and the sector southeast of Laon also
tell of retirements, gives the move
ment indications of a general with
drawal, but as yet no official Informa
tion has come to indicate where the
line upon which the enemy will at
tempt to stand, has been established.
Army officials can take no notice
of the numerous reports of an impend
ing complete capitulation in seeking
the explanation of the German
maneuvers in the field. They can
ascribe those operations to very defi
nite and well developed plans of the
German general staff. It was said
tonight that the enemy probably has
begun the second phase of the with
drawal he has been compelled to un
dertake as a result of unwavering
pressure by Marshal Foch all along
the battle line. Lacking the reserves
with which to make a stand on an
extended front, it is to be assumed
that he U falling back to a much
shortened line where he can show
greater resisting power.
There is reason to believe, how
ver. that under the hammering of the
allied and American armies, the Ger
man high command has been com
pelled to make a compromise. In
stead of holding on to the front lines
until the new front was in complete
readiness, it is regarded as highly
probable that the advanced positions
are being abandoned barely in time
to avoid encirclement and the retire
ment being made to defenses not fully
equipped and certainly not manned
with extensive reserves. If such is
th case the retiring armies must turn
and fight again when they reach the
new lines, t he rapidity ot tne auieu
pursuit In each case gives no oppor
tunity for rest or reorganization.
The genius of the German general
staff is plainly shown, officers sav.
in the skill with which the withdrawal
has been conducted thus far and it is
still evident that a well ordered
movement is clearing enemy forces
out of the Belgian coast area. The sit
uation there is hazy in many respects,
however, due to the swiftly changing
nature of the lines. Pursuing cavalry
may upset the German schedule and
large captures result.
The reports showing fliat the French
were making progress in clearing up
tho Dise-Serre norket. southeast of I
Laon, attracted particular attention !
here. This narrow point of high i
ground between the two rlvers.guard-,

A haven of safety in a shorter and

In Belgium the enemy is giving

Mesa Loan Committee Wires To
Stop the Sale of Gas to Slacker
The Maricopa county Liberty loan committee is running the pocket
book slackers to earth and doing it with a vengeance. Already coats of
yellow pltint have been administered to men who have refused to buy
bonds. They have had doctors, merchants and farmers up before the com
mittee asking why. Some of these have come through, while others have
ignored all appeals. Yesterday there came from Mesa to Chairman J. N.
Gaines of this district the following telegram:

Douai
It was the spring of last year that Douai
first began to appear in the dispatches and
headlines as a pawn in the game of war.
The British had stormed Vimy Ridge and
driven forward in that most disastrous and
costly attack on the Bullecourt line. Just
ahead, beyond the ridges and ravines and
wire and trenches and woods and flame
and smoke of the battle line, some six or
eight miles away across rolling plains and
pleasant fields, with never a natural ob
stacle between, lay Douai, that ancient city,
a fat and fine prize for the winner of this
fight.
But alas, the British were repulsed and
later driven far back from sight of Douai
and her towers.
A year passed by and only a faithful few
still dreamed of Douai and how near and,
yet so far we had been to that gentle slope
that led right up to her gates. Here was a
mighty step on the way to the Belgian
frontier, and Douai marked it on the map
and on the landscape of war. This was the
hardest step of the journey to Belgium,
back over that terrible track that is marked
with Mons and Charleroi and Maybeuge
and Liege itself.
Back we were pressed still further from
Douai until even the dream of this fair
and famous French city grew dim. Then
Foch struck before Amiens, and, after we
had passed Baupaume and broken that im
pregnable Queant switch-line and passed
Bullecourt of ill omen and disaster, the van
ished dream of Douai began to glow again
upon the screen of the events of the war.
And now for months past Douai has come
again into her own in the headlines and
possibilities and plans of' the conflict. We
pressed on to the southeast and took Cam
brai ; we drove a wedge into Belgium ; we
even took Lens and threatened Lille, but
Douai remained inviolate. Every day the
dispatches discussed Douai and predicted
her fall, and every day the faithful ones
hoped on. And finally, on Thursday, the
seventeenth day of October of the good
year nineteen-eighteen, the allies entered
Douai and the hardest step on the way to
the Belgian frontier had been taken. This
is the blood drenched, immortal way that
the British expeditionary forces and the
French army passed in the fall of nineteen
f ourteen. And now they are starting out to
pass that way again, eastward this time,
and not westward, praise be to every saint
in the calendar of the old church at Rome.
But Douai had a history of its own, and
a fame that has spread to the borders of
Europe and far beyond among religious and
thinking men hundreds of years before this
war was begun. It was at Douai that the first
version of the Bible used by English speak
ing Catholics the world over was printed.
Some twelve hundred years ago Douai be
longed to the famous and infamous counts
of Flanders, and then it passed from them
to the turbulent dukes of Burgundy, who
made war upon Paris as often as they did
upon foreign foes, and they were making
war all the time. Spain captured Douai
from the Burgundians and later Louis XIV
won Douai back to France and she held it
inviolate until the Huns came in 1914.
Douai, taken the other day by the Eng
lish, has had other and many guests from
England in days gene by. English, Scotch
and Irish Catholics, exiled from the British
Isles in the religious war, found refuge at
Douai, and they enlarged and made fam
ous the great university founded there by
Philip of Spain years before. For cen
turies Douai remained a center of learning
for the English speaking priesthood of the
Catholic church. The principal church and
the town hall of Douai were built seven
hundred years ago, and, in fact, most of the
large buildings of the modern and beauti
ful Douai date back hundreds of years and
still gie the city, with its boulevards and
gardens, an ancient appearance. That is
to say, they did, before the war. Douai to
day can enly be imagined wiih a sijh and
a tear, for after four years of occupation by
the Hun, its beauty hath departed forever,
but it can never be robbed of its glory.
Douai the ancient was a seat of learning,
but the Douai of today has become a cen
ter of industry. The Douai of the war had
become a key that unlocked the door that
led back across the road from Liege to the
Marne.
This key is in our hand. Let us hasten,
brethren, upon the way.
OVER WE GO!
The Warren district went over the top
yesterday with several thousand to ? pare in
its great drive for the $1,400,000 quota of
the fourth Liberty loan. Of course we
raised it. The Warren district has always
come through clean and fine and strong in
any great work to which it has set its hand.
And this was a Herculean labor. Our quota
had been set with the sky as the limit and it
was only by going down to the bottom of
our pockets that we were enabled to go over
that top.
And right here the Review wants to lay
particular stress upon one grand and glow
ing point, and that is, that it was only with
the aid and earnest, whole hearted support
of the working men of the district that we
managed to subscribe our part of the loan.
The fourth loan was the working man's
loan in the Warren district. Did you see
those two pages of names in the Review
yesterday morning forming the C. and A.
subscriptions? Miners and muckers and
workmen and clerks, nearly every one of
them. And the Shattuck and the Copper
Queen boys came through the same way
as their names will tell in issues of the Re
view next week.'
The business men and other residents
of the district worked and gave, but after
all, it was a people's loan. The average
man had to subscribe to it. It was the large
number of subscriptions that carried the
third line intrenchments, and not the num
ber of large subscriptions.
Of course the Warren district went over.
They are lagging in the great centers of
wealth and population, north and east and
south, but we did not lag here. We were
well up in our per cent all the time, and
never for a day was the Warren district per
cent of subscriptions below the per cent for
the Dallas district as a whole. It was a
great achievement, and accomplished in the
face of peace talk and reports and rumors
and influenza and all the other things that
always intervene in any great work to do,
but which do not daunt or disorganize a
real American camp like this one of Bis
bee, U. S. A.
The evidence in that criminal libel suit
at Phoenix this week, no matter what tl e
verdict may be, shows Hunt, and therefore
the office of governor of this state, in any
thing but a favorable light. That he con
sorted and hob-nobbed with wobblies and
other doubtful gentry, both on the edge and
beyond the pale of treason, is shown time
and again by the testimony. A man is
known by the company he keeps. And it
is thi3 fact, as much as the direct evidence
of Prof. Lawrence that he said, "To hell
with the war," that weighs against him in
the public verdict, and may well weigh
with the jury.
Cold, Hard Facts
"" On the front page of the Review Friday
morning appeared a statement issued from
London in which was set forth the fact that
the majority of opinion in the English capi
tal were agreed that the German army was
still formidable and that the military situ
ation did not warrant any undue hopes of
an immediate peace. It went further when
it declared that the Germans had conducted
a most successful retreat and were not liable
to suffer any great losses of men or material
from disaster this year. The political, and
not the military situation, this article aver
red, was spurring Germany on in her insist
ent appeals for peace. And this column, in
all humility, can point out its editorial ut
terances almost daily for a week past, that
nearly word for word coincide with the
statements of this London dispatch. A close
study of the war day by day with a map
always before one and past events for ref
erence, does not incline the student to un
due elation over our victories .of recent
months. We have done much, but there
is much to do. The campaign of 1918 is
drawing fast to an end. Not until the spring
of 1919 will we be able to reap the harvest
of this fall. If Foch had two months more,
then we should see. But he has only about
two weeks. If Germany bows to our terms
and makes unconditional surrender it will
be the political and not the military situa
tion that compels her submission. There
are sighs that she is about to yield, but
signs are poor things to build upon in war.
We cannot afford to count upon or even
consider them. We must press on unhesi
tatingly and unrelentingly, straight and
stern to the goal of a complete victory.
Ostend
Napoleon once declared that the port of
Ostend, in Belgium, was a pistol pointed at
England. But the great French emperor,
with this pistol, was never able to make
England surrender. Nor has the kaiser Wil
helm, possessing this same pistol for four
years, met with better success. But was
always a threat and a menace, and doubt
less England has shuddered at it, even as
she shuddered more than a hundred years
ago when Napoleon's shadow fell across
Europe. And now Ostend has fallen. Eng
lish ships have entered its harbor and Bel
gian troops occupy its streets and the Bel
gian king and queen, long exiled from their
land, have established their temporary capi
tal here. The fall of Ostend marks an
epoch of the great war. Holding it, the
Germans were protected by the sea upon
their right flank, and they used it as a sub
marine base to harry allied commerce close
at hand. It stands at the very-mouth of
the English channel, and was at once a cita
del of the sea and of land. Zeebrugge, just
to the north, will not long survive the fall
of Ostend, and this means that the German
will have to depend upon his frozen ports
of the North Sea for submarine activity
during the winter. The loss of Ostend i3
as severe a blow to German military and
political power as any one of the many se
vere blows he has received lately. And thus
the restoration of Belgium has begun, at
the point of the sword and the muzzle of
the gun, and the only way possible to have
restored her from the hand of such a foe. It
is now too late for Berlin to gain any capi
tal or any credit from voluntarily giving up
Belgium. The greater part of this mar
tyred land will be regained this year no mat
ter what Berlin elects to do. Those Belgian,
English and French divisions that lunged
forward Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday
of this week, passing over or through every
armed obstacle in their way, made history!
It is estimated that since July 1 8, last, the
allies have captured 461,200 prisoners on
all fronts. Of these 75,000 were Turks and
about sixty thousand were Bulgars. This
would leave about " 350,000 Germans
yanked out of the fighting line on the west
ern front and placed in cages in the rear.
In other words, thirty full German divisions
have been taken bodily besides those killed
and wounded. A terrible toll, and showing
more clearly than anything else the master
strategy of Foch and the valor and stay
ing qualities of the allied troops. In the
past three months the allies have taken
three times as many German prisoners as
they had taken in the first three years of
the war. It is also declared that we have
taken over five thousand German cannon,
or about one-fifth of his entire artillery
armament.
In the recent peace and kaiser-abdication
fiasco, sent out from Holland it is noted by
this column that the New York Times spe
cial correspondent played a part, and the
Times bulletin of the fake was first placed
on the wires. Since the Times made that
editorial bid for peace via the negotiation
route and then veered around so quickly,
this column has marked it from its list of
great papers of the country. This second
effort to break through with premature
peace is different from the first one, but
can be viewed with the same suspicion and
doubt.
A famous military critic declares that the
last German peace note is only "another
scrap of paper," and that it is our duty to
see that the five million allied soldiers who
have given up their lives in fighting German
militarism have not died in vain.
It seems to be a cinch that Germany will
accept at least one of Wilson's fourteen
items, note or no note, and that is the evacu
ation of Belgium and northern France. But
Foch, and not Wilhelm, hath ordained it.

The McNeal fair has been called off.
This far was to have been held to
day, October 19. Although there is
no maliidy of influenza in the McNeal
section, the directors of the annual
fair thought best to cancel all en
gagements, and possibly hold a fall
festival or fair later in the season.
The farmers are very much disap
pointed in not having their fair, as
there is some very choice farm prod
ucts reajy for exhibition. Many of
the fanners have been caring for spe
cially fine specimens of corn. pumi
kins, potatoes, fruit and other prod
ucts with a view of taking the prize
at the county fair. Many of the farm
ers have samples of cotton, grown tor
experimental purposes, which they
wanted to exhibit. Although there has
teen a dry season throughout tUe
country, the farmers of the McNeal
stction, who are farming under pumo
ir.g plants, have made a good success.
and have splendid crops which they
are selling in Hisbee and Douglas ut
good prices.
Walier E. Ratliffe, who arrived in
Douglas to become the manager of
the Gadsden hotel, has already met
many olir friends in this city since
his arrival. He comes to the Gadsden
from the Van Nuys hotel in Los An
geles, where he has been for the past
ten years, as clerk. The Van Nuys is
a poplar hotel for Arizonans hu
frequently visit Los Angeles and Mr.
Ratliffe has a lame acquaintance in
all parts of the slate. After looking
over the city of Douglas Mr. Ratliffe
declared that he liked the city an-J
that he had been surprised to find
almost every feature of it on modern
lines and giving evidence of con
tinued growth in spite of war conditions.

Political Gossip
PHOENIX. Ariz.. Oct. IS. When
Carl Hayden flooded Arizona postof
fices witii a pamphlet published at
government expense, defending his
oad war record and attacking the Na
tional Security league for exposing it,
Andrew Baumert, jr., secretary of the
republican state committee wired the
chairman of the league of Hayuen's as
sault on that organisation, whose
honorary president is Klihu Root and
whose honorary vice-president is Alton
B. Parker, democratic candidate for
the presidency in 1104.
In reply Mr. Baumert recetred the
following letter from Charles D. Orth,
chairman of the league:
Mr. Andrew Maumert, jr..
Phoenix, Arizona.
Dear Sir:
We are in receipt of your telegram
advising us that Mr. Hayden is endeav
oring ti discredit the National Secur
ity ieagi urougn a letter which he is
publishing ia your newspaper.
We have no doubt that the wisdom
and conscience of the good people of
Arizona are fully equal to a correct in
terpretation of the facts. An adage
sometimes humorously quoted by law
yers is to the effect "When you have
a weak case, abuse the other side." We
do not believe that any nun who voted
against the preparedness principles
enumerated In our chart and who also
voted against the principle of selective
conscription, without which the United
States would indeed have had a "con
temptible little army" compared to
what it has can expect a constitu
ency made up of American Americans
to regard his candidacy with favor.
Please do not misinterpret this let
ter as an aid to the republican party in
Arizona, or anywhere else. We are
writing similar letters daily about re
publican members in other parts of
the country.
Very truly yours,
CHAS. D. ORTH.
Chairman Congressional Committee.
Did Not Want to Fight
The following excerpt fr'om Hay
uen's gpeech against conscription prob
ably explains why he waited a year
and a half before going into a training
cam:) with an officers' commission.
"Our chief part in this conflict, and
fcr ir, we are well prepared, is to see
to it that the veterans who have
learned through two years of bitter
struggle the way to drive the Germans
back, shall not suffer for food or cloth
ing or for an abundance of all forms
ot the arms and ammunition which
are lequtred in such great quantiUes
in mcdern warfare. Our people are
not trained to arms and the year that
must be spent before any large num
ber of our soldiers can be fitted for
I service on the battle fronts of Europe,
I might better be spent in using these
! same, men in the production of the
; tilings that the allies most sorely need.
It follows logically that if our great
est contribution to the war is to be in
the form of products of our fields and

to cease from work of national Im

To send such men out of the country
would not only be an economic but a
military waste.

The freeing of the Belgian coast
will have Tittle direct effect on the
submarine situation, but may be of
great value in furnishing the allied
forces with new bases rrom which to
operate ami-submarine patrols. The
German I'-boat flotillas on the Fland

"My Bit"
(By Jewel McLeod. Bisbee. Age 12
Years, Junior High.)
Mr. Editor:
As I have been confined ia bed for
the last week with the Spanish influ
enza, I have been reading everything
published in your paper pertaining to
the progress made in the fourth Liber
ty loan drive. I note with much grief
that we. the greatest nation on earth,
are tbout to fail, when success in this
drive is so essential. I ask you. Mr.
Editor, what will our boys think of
us, they, who have goue forth as men.
to light and die that the childhood
of Bisbee. as well as elsewhere may
be safe from the unspeakable Hun.
Wnat will te the feeling of the
slackers, when the pride and pick of
this nation return, some blind and un
able to ever behold their loved ones,
and this beautiful land of ours again.
What can we say to the boys who re
turn victorious, but crippled and dis
figured for life? This land of ours
has always stood for the Square Deal.
If we, who remain at home in safety,
don't bark np the boys to our last pen
ny, hew can we expect them to protect
us in our indifference and yellow cur
ism. Honestly, Mr. Editor, a stacker
coul 1 walk under a snake on level
ground without taking his hat off.
Taking into consideration what other
countries have given in money and
life, we of the L". S. A. have not begun
to give. While Belgium has seen her
babies impelled on German bayonets,
shall we, in a matter of money, lay
down like the Hun. when he sees a ,
Yankee bayonet coming for him, and
try to excuse our action and avoid
the issue.
Another point I would like to ask for
a little information on is this: How
much benefit did our boys in the
trenches d.rlve from the statement
published in an 8 p. in. extra published
a few nights ago? I think it most
unwise to say the least for any pub
lication to issue news of this kind, un
less they have the most absolute con
firmation of same. Such news from
such countries as this last peace ot
fake originated in should be sup
pressed unless it is officially O. K.'d
by our government.
Thanking you for your indulgence
and expressing to you my admiration
for (he clarity and soundness of your
patriotism as expressed on your edi
torial page daily.
Sincerely.
JEWEL. McLEOD.

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGH), Oct. IS. Reports that
the German U-boats had been called
in gave a decided stimulus today to
bullish sentiment in regard tocorn.
Largely as a result, prices at the fin
ish, although unsettled, were 1 to 27c
mi Higher, with November 1.21 Tc
and December to 91.16. Oats
gained V to sg net. Provisions closed
-o to 0c down.
Belief that exportation of grain
would bo much facilitated by recall
J of tiie U-boats put the corn bears at a
disadvantage irom the outset. Not
withstanding that the reports as to
the recall were by no means fully ac
cepted as true, a majority of traders
credited the gossip sufficiently to try
to anticipate in a measure the im
plied likelihood of greatly iucreased
freedom for commercial shipping and
therefore of a better dyhand for
grain. In this connection talk was
current tiiat regardless of the course
of hostilities it would be many months
and perhaps years before consumption

GLAD TO TESTIFY
Says Waloga Lady, "As To Wfet
Cardui Has Done For Me, So
As To Help Others."
Watoga.W. Va. Mrs. S. W. GladweH,
of this town, says: "When about 15 years !
of age, I suftcred greatly . . . Sometimes j
would go a month or two, and I had ,
terrible headache, backache, and bearing- .
own pains, ana wouia just crag ana
had no appetite. Then ... it would last
. . . two weeks, and was so weakening,
and mv health was awful. !
j !
My mother bought me a bottle of
Cardui, and I beean to improve after
taking the first bottle, so kept it up till 1 1
took three ... I gained, and was well ,
and strong, and 1 owe it all to Cardui.
1 am married now and have 3 children,
. . . Have never had to have a doctor for
female trouble, and just resort to Cardui
if I need a tonic. 1 am glad to testify to
what it has done for me, so as to help
sthers."
If you are nervous or weak, have head
ches, backaches, or any of the other
ailments so common to women, why not
give Cardui a trial? Recommended by
nany physicians. In use over 40 years.
Begin taking Cardui today. It may
be the very medicine you need.

gations cf many cases of disloyal ut
terances. While we are satisfied that

ism, we feel they fell a little short, in
our cpinion. in justifying the return
of indicaments. We recommend in
creased diligence on the part of all

ing to the United States attorney such
evidence as they may obtain respect
ing such violations." The statement

Phoenix: Owing to the irregular

Arizona and western New Mexico the
weather bureau weekly report of cattle

the district. Light showers occurred
during the week over portions of the

guards near Santa Rosalia. Chihua
hua, were the first to resist the re
cent order of General Murguia com-!
mandeering all horses and mules In I
the state of Chihuahua. One hundred
norses were seized from tne nome
guards of that district by federal sol
diers last week. A meeting of the
ranchers and home guards was held.
It was voted to resist the confiscation
order and a detachment of home j
guards started in pursuit of the fed-J
erals driving their horses into Santa
Rosalia. Overcome by superior num-t
bers the federal detachment was I
forced to surrender the seized horses
and were also deprived of their arms
and. ammunition.
Ranchers and home guards in the
Casas Grandes district also sent a
message to General Murguia tellini?
him he would have to send troops to
take the horses from the men of that
mountain district. Partisans of Gov
ernor Enriquez here claimed today the
order was aimed at the home guards,
an organization of ranchers friendly
to Enriquez, rather than a precaution
aga:nst Villa activities.
PREPARE ANOTHER
DEFENSE SYSTEM
(Continued turn Pace On)
other forces are driving ahead from
the east of Lille. British cannon are
throwing shells over Turcoing and
Roubaix and patrols are in their out
skirts, so that both may be said to be
under Irtish control. It is not unlike
ly that the British at these places may
follow the same tactics they did at
Lfle, sweeping past the towns and
surrounding them instead of going
through. Thus they would give the
enemy not the slishtest excuse for ;
trying to destroy the towns with :
shells. Such a maneuver is only, pos-1
sible. however, if the Germans aban-1
don the towns, as probably they are j
doing as they did at Lille.
