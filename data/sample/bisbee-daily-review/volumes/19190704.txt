The Fourth of July is here and a

age American: hear feels as to his
responsibility as a stockholder in the
institution called the United States
of America.
Americans are accused of being
fond of wanting everything different
The passion for "Newness", for re
freshing change, is always ascribed
to the American character. And
naturally it is expected that the
American will expect something dlf.
ferent after the war in the express
eion of his celebration.
However true it 1b that the United
States does reveal this eagerness
for novelty. It cannot be doubted that
the incident of the first Fourth of
July after the war is anticipated
widely as a festival which shall some
how reveal a transformed country.
It is a repeated prophecy that a new
spirit will find ways of changing for
the better the whole aspect ot
American life; not by any quick
magic, but by the slow effort that
has piled up the structure to which
we have given the name the United
States, so that with today's celebra
tion the local committee has done
everything in its power to bring out
something that will be expressive ot
this new spirit which Will be felt for
the first time since the end of the
World war.
A most interesting program has
been prepared for the Warren Dis

some place to go or some form of en

EVENING; BOXERS OF HIGH TYPE
One of the most interesting fea-j
tures of today's program will be the
boxing matches to be held at the
baseball park in Warren at 8 o'clock
this evening. The qualities of the
different boxers engaged are of a
type to reflect credit on sport in the
Warren District. As one Instance, an
official report of General Cabell, in
command of the border troops, says
regarding Bobby Burns:
Gen. Cabell Praises Burns
"This man has been on duty in
other districts in the department and
has shown abilitw to instruct indi
vidual and mass boxing. The re
ports from . various district com
manders show that his work has
proven most beneficial and satisfac
tory throughout, resulting in notice
able Improvement In the morale and
spirit of the' commands with which
he works. Such time should be al
lotted him as you thing will prove

Major General Cabell.
Sharing interest with Pobby Burns
is Johnnie McCullough. McCullouh
is a Bisbee boy, a graduate of the
local high school and played on the
football team of the high school for
several years, having a reputation as
a very dependable player. He en
tered the University law school upon
his rraduation here, but gave up his
studies at the beginning of the way
to enter the navy. While in the
navy he soon won recognition as a
promising boxer and rendered a good
account of himself on every occasion.

Premier Is Loudly Cheered In

Of Allied Powers Will Try
Kaiser In British Capital
LONDON, July 4. William
Hohenzollern, the former German
emperor, will be brought to Eng
land in a British ship and impris
oned in the Tower of London, ac
cording to the Daily Mail.
The death penalty wilt not be
sought, the newspaper points out,
but if he Is found guilty the allies
ask his banishment for life to a
remote Island.
The International trial court
had Intended to try the former
emperor alone, the Daily Mall
ays, but It Is possible that the
former crown prince, Federick
William, will also be arraigned be
fore it.
LONDON, July 3 (By The Asso
ciated Press). ; Premier Lloyd
George delivered in the house of
commons this afternoon an explana
tion of the peace .treaty which he de
scribed as "the most momentous doc
ument to which the Eritish empire
ever affixed its seal."
Though showing the effects ot his
long labors at Paris and lacking his
usual fire, the premier at times made
impassioned utterances, and was
loudly cheered. His , announcement
that the former German emperor
would soon be placed on trial before
a tribunal sitting in London was
cheered most of all, while his pre
sentation of the Anglo-French' con
vention, providing- for British aid if
Germany should attack France un
provoked a convention analogous to
one between the United States and
France was greeted with unrestrain
ed approval. .
Recalls Great War 8peecea
The scene recalled some of the
great speeches of the war. All the
seats were taken and every Inch of
standing room was preempted. The
Prince of Wales, the American am
bassador. John Wj Davis and Thom
as Nelson Page, the Japanese and
Italian ambassadors and many other
noted persons were in the disting
uished visitors gallery. The gallery
behind them was unusually colorful,
because under the recent rules wo
men were admitted to this section,
and nearly monopolized the space.
The premier had a good reception
from all sections of the house. His
speech was largely impromptu and
discursive. He told of the peace con
ference's efforts to prevent wars in
the future, and reviewed some of the
striking restrictions put upon Ger
many in the treaty signed at Ver
sailles. Discussing the determination of the
allied and asos'ciated powers to place

William Hohenzollern, the
former German emperor, as the man

he declared that if such a course had
been followed after other wars
"there would have been fewer wars."
It was the intention to make such
an example of Germany as to dis
courage others "from ever again at
tempting to repeat this infamy."

Shooting Starts at 10 0'Clock When Military Policeman of 19th
v Infantry is Attacked by Negroes; General Disarming of
Negroes Follows, in Which 41 Are Taken Into Custody;
Officers of 10th Cavalry Arrive and Take Negroes Back to
Camps; Occurrence Deplored as Caused by Irresponsible Few
As a result of riots in the streets of Bisbee last night
between members of the Tenth United States Cavalry, colored,
and the Bisbee police force, attenmpting to restore order in the
absence of the regular officers who were at a dance in Warren,
one negro was severely wounded and two others slightly wound
ed, 41 negroes were disarmed and arrested, Deputy Sheriff
Hardwick received a flesh wound in the arm and a Mexican wo
man, Mrs. Teresa Leyvas, was shot in the side of the head by a
ricochetting bullet, but not seriously injured.
Hundred Shots Fired
Following a series of fusillades In
which more than a hundred shots
were fired, and 41 negroes were
placed under arrest and disarmed by
Chief of Police J. A. Kempton and
his force assisted by Deputy Sheriff
Joe Hardwick. quiet was restored at
midnight, by which time the army of
ficers, summoned from a dance in
their honor at the Warren Couutry
Club, had arrived in Bisbee. The ar
rested negroes were turned over to
their custody by the police, and' re
turned in charge of the officers to
their camp outside the city.
The negroes, comprising 800 men
of the 10th United States Cavalry,
were here from Fort Huachuca, un
der command of Colonel George E.
White, to lead the parade for the
Fourth of July celebration here.
Three hundred of the negroes were
in Bisbee when the trouble started,
the remaining 500 being in camp on
the outskirts of the pity.
Says Negroes Intoxicated
The riot was precipitated at 10
o'clock in the evening when George
Sullivan, white, military policeman
of the 19th United States Infantry
stationed at Douglas, was passing by
a negro club in upper Brewery Gulch
known as the Silver Leaf club, while
on duty. Five negro cavalrymen, ac.
cording to Sullivan and other wit
nesses, made a tauntiiig remark as
he passed. Seeing they were intoxi
cated, Sullivan says, he told them
they had better go home.
The negroes, Sullivan says, drew
revolvers, knocked him down, and
took his own weapon from him. Sev
eral civilians started to his aid, and
the negres fled.
The negroes then went to the po
lice station and told Chief Kempton
that "civilians were trying to run
them cut of town." Chief Kempton
suggested that they leave their weap
ons with him in the station. They
refused, saying they were permitted
by their officers to carry them, and
left, still armed.
Begin General Disarming .
Chief Kempton, Deputy Sheriff
Hardwick and Officer Wm. Sherill
then started up Brewery Gulch to
disarm all negroes they could find.
As they approached the Silver Leat
club, officers say, five other negroes
came out of the club and without a
word of warning opened fire -upon
them.
One bullet struck Hardwick in the
arm, inflicting a slight flesh wound.
Other bullets struck a brick wall.
scattering brick dust in the eyes of
the officers, who were handicapped
in returning the fire, which they did
until their guns were empty.
The last shot which Sherill fired
struck one of the negroes in the back
of the neck," and he fell.
The officers returned to the police
station for additional guns and am
munition. When they started back
up the gulch a second time they en
countered an auto in which were six
negroes, and ordered it to stop. The
negroes, stopping the auto opposite
the depot building, opened fire on the
officers. Deputy Sherifr Hardwick
and Officer Sherill returned the fire,
perforating the curtains o the ma
chine. One bullet richochettlng, struck a
Mexican woman, Teresa Leyvas of
Bisbee, who was standing in the de
pot waiting for a train, the bullet en
tering the right side of her head. The
wound is not dangerous, physicians
who removed the bullet declared.
Negroes Surrender
After the first volley by the offi
cers, the negroes ceased firing and
held up their hands in token of sur
render. They were all placd in jail.
After this the rounding up of

T
armed negroes became general, until
nearly 50 were in custody. Ex
changes of shots were frequent dur
ing the round up, with no fatalities,
thee of the negroes being wounded.
After refusing to surrender their
guns upon the command of Lieuten
ant F. II. Ryden of the 10th cavalry,
who In company with Chief of Po
lice Kempton, had gone to the New
club at 9 Brewery Gulch, to per
suade the men to return in military
formation to the camp at Warren,
Lieutenant Ryder succeeded iu plac
ing them in formation for ihe march
back, after Chief Kempton had prom
ised them protection. The two po
lice cars followed in the rear, five
negroes who hung back and soon lost
the advancing column started to an
gue with the officers. Upon the com.
mand of the police officers to con
tinue the march one of the soldiers
who had been drinking heavily, step
ped behind a telephpne post at the
entrance to the, City park and reach
ed for his gun to open fire. Deputy
Sheriff Hardwick opened fire, one
bullet taking effect in the right lung
and the negro sank to the ground un
conscious. He was later removed to
the local hospital. The remaining
four negroes broke and ran, but were
rounded up and deprived of their
arms after a short chase.
Situation Well Handled
Chief of Police Kempton and his
limited force of assistants, ably
handled the situation in the absence
of military officers, reducing the
danger to the crowds on the streets
to a minimum considering the fre
quency of gun play that occurred, and
the great number of soldiers who
were on leave In the city and armed.
Occurrence la Deplored
Both officers and men of the 10th
Cavalry stated last evening that the
occurrence was deeply deplored by
practically the entire regiment, as o
a nature not at all typical of the re
lations existing between the cavalry
men at Fort Huachuca and Bisbee.
and as having been caused by an ir
responsible Jew who fell under ir
responsible influences. The most
cordial relations, say the soldiers,
will continue between Bisbee and
the Fort Huachuca camp in the fu
ture. Colonel White, commanding the ne
groes, stated that the weapons they
carried were part of their equipment.
It was learned that the cavalrymen,
being on a tactical march in their
visit to Bisbee to take part in the
celebration here, are furnished side
arms and ammunition under the reg
ulations. FIRST CAVALRY COMING
DOUGHS. July 4 The order for
Lieutenant Thomas E, Pratt and a

the treaty, Mr. Lloyd George said the
territory of Alsace-Lorraine, he said,
taken iorcibly from the land to which
its population was deeply attached; 'it
was a restoration of Schleswig-Hol-stein,
the taking of which . he de
scribed as the "meanest of Hohenzol
lern frauds, robbing a' helpless coun
try under the pretense they, were not
faoing It, and then retaining the land
against the wishes of the population;'
a restoration of ''a Poland torn to
bits by Russian, Austrian and Prus
sian autocracy and now reknit un
der the flag of Poland."
The British delegation, the premier
said, has taken a stand resolutely op
posing any attempt to put a predom

two Judges similar to the system in

have a timekeeper.
Willard 245, Dempsey 200
Both principals appear to be
trained to perfect condition and each
expresses perfect satisfaction with
his physical and mental condition.
Willard probably will enter the ring
weighing about 245 pounds, while
Dempsey is expected to' be near the
200 mark. In almost every physical
measurement the champion will have
the advantage of the challenger, be
ing the largest man who ever held
the title. Notwithstanding these
physical handicaps, Dempsey has the
popular following and he is selected
to win by many shrewd ring follow
ers, partly due to his- youth, for he
is 24 years old, to Willard's 37, and
his impressive rushing, fighting style
of boxing.

mutuel department showed opinion
about evently divided on the result,
should the affair go the full twelve
rounds. Betting on the probability
of a knockout centers about rounds
seven and eight, as has been the
case for several days.
While waggering reflects the opln.
ion of those who take more than a
casual interest in such matches, It
has no effect upon the ability bf the
principals. More heavyweight cham
pionship holders have been defeated
while carrying the popular money
than is the reverse case. There are
so many unusual angles to Friday's
contest that this is not considered,
however, an axiom here tonight.

that even the Dempsey supporters
hesitate to hurdle financially when
it is realized that he is required to
box 36 minutes and hold his own to
gain at least a draw, decision. The
champion is generally - conceded to
be the 'better boxer of the two. bat
Dempsey has achieved a remarkable
ring record with his incessant i rush
ing, free-hitting type of offense. His
followers base their predictions of
his victory on his ability to rush and
batter his way through Willard's
guard and reach a vulnerable spot
with one or more of the crushing
blows which have disposed of so
many previous opponents.
To Be Fight at Close Quarters.
While neither boxer has made any
public statement regarding his plan
of ring campaign, reports from the
training quarters indicate that there
will be little time wasted in long
range sparring, during the early
rounds of the contest at least. Demp
sey is noted for his eagerness to get
to close quarters with an opponent
and standing toe to toe to demon
strate that he is the better man in
a two-fisted combat. This is not as
a rule the system adopted by Willard,
but it is said by .close friends of the
title holder that he has been greatly
displeased by reports of alleged In
different training and inability to
meet Dempsey at his own game, de
spite his physical advantages in dis
cussing this angle of the match the

AMERICATHE HOPE OF THE WORLD
"W
TE, THE PEOPLE of the United States, in order
' . . : ..i.lii.l :
iu iurm iiiuic ucitcvi umun, caiduiibn ju&uwc,
insure domestic tranquility, provide for the com
mon defense, promote the general welfare,
and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our pos
terity,' do ordain and establish this constitution for the
United States of America."
That preamble to our constitution, tella it all.
For the first time ia history a people .united for defense, and lib
erty, for domestic tranquility, and to establish justice.
On this day, when we memorate the wisdom of the forefathers,
and renew our allegiance to the nation, it is well to get back to es
sentials, and understand what our job is as American citizens.
The people, for we are the people, indeed we bid fair to become
a distinct race in another hundred years, grew from the formless
womb of time into powef because it was bora for service, and lib
erty, arid justice, as well as for protection, tradex advantage and the
other national aims countries strive for.-
From the first blood-stained trails of our nation's liberty; from
the bitter frozen paths of the colonial fanner Eoldiers, to the gas cra
ters and foul trenches of Flanders America's sons have died for lib
erty; for an ideal, to overthrow despots and .to bring security and
. prosperity, and above all else, equality before the law, to all men.
, " This is the first nation that tried the Utopian experiment. -;
It Is now the oldest nation maintaining the same form of gov
ernment. In the world. ' , ' .
For the past generation we had forgotton some of these tilings;
our Fourth were so safe and sane that they brought no message, as
'they did when the colonials heroes still limped over the countryside
or when the veterans of Jones and Perry refought their battles at the
town tavern, or when the blue and gray-clad fathers told their sons
of the charge and counter charge, and assault and repulse, and ne
newed assault ofthe four years when brother fought with brother,
and father fought with son.
But today; just escaping from the shadow of a world dominion
by the Hun, today our eyes see more clearly through their tears, and
our hearts beat to a higher pressure, since bo recently they leaped
to the alarm of the death rattle of rapid fire, and the volcanic roar of
the enemy heavies.
Let us once more renew our allegiance to the simple faith of our
fathers.
In a world of confusion, of nations struggling in the birth pangs,
and gasping In the death throes; in the finite madhouse, where all
seem crazed, and where wild vaporings and futile Imaginings and bru
talities of all degrees mark peoples and kingdoms alike; let us, in our
own haven, having done our duty to humanity,' and left the eacrifire
of oar first-born on the altars' of Europe; let us, in simple faith, bead
the knee before the ark of covenant, and resolve that as a people
united, we will fight on for justice, for tranquility, In oar common de
fense and to secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and our pos
terity. -
THE VANGUARD OF CIVILIZATION
ANY SEAPORT of any civilized country hi the world is more ac
cessible from New York today than was Denver, Colo., at
the time of its first settlement in 1S58.
Thus the world has done pretty well in the matter of
transportation.
It is is doing much of this same transportation for it is making
a world prosperity, a world peace, and one people as near as'the el
ments of the race and climate will permit.
Lord Bacon said: "There are three things which make a nation
great and prosperous; busy workshops, fertile fields and easy means
of transportation for man and tlie goods from place to place."
Lord Bacon also said: " Of all inventions of modern times, the
alphabet and printing press alone excepted, those inventions which
abridge distance have done most for civilization."
We are quite naturally reminded of what Benjamin Franklin said
about aeronautics 136 years ago. The French had just then made
a few ascensions in gas balloons, and the probability of steering and
propelling these crafts was being discussed crossing the Atlantic,
was even then suggested. ' "
Someone asked Franklin if he believed an aeronaut would cver
be able to steer his balloon: "The thing is in its infancy," said
Franklin, "it is necessary to wait."
"But what useful process will it ever serve?" This questioner
continued. t '
"It is a child just bcor," replied Franklin, "let us wait and judge
It when its education is completed."
And so ft is, aviation is just now in its youth youth is just now
playing with the toois with which it will finally manifest itself in larg
er accomplishmcmts.
"It is a child just horn," icplied Franklin, "let us wait and judge
other inventors that it will be fully 25 years before aviation has
reached! the point of perfection and usefulness that the automobile
attained 15 years tgo. Tesla states that the future test of the aero
plane is going to be the ability to make great 6peed and ascend great
heights in order to be free from storms.
The first constructive purpose in the greater perfection of aerial
navigation will be in the ability to go to places of discovery and pros
pect as a carrier of men and mail to remote parts, and water and
rail transportation as a carrier of bulk freight will finally follow air
courses. It willserve as the vanguard of civilization, democracy and
trade in now inaccessible regions.
ALADDIN'S WIDOW
WHEN THE PALACE of Aladdin was built one windyv was
left unfinished for the Sultan to complete. Unfortunately
his funds ran out .and the window was never completed.
We have from this incident the saying "Aladdin's Win
dow," when we speak of any work left undone by a great man and
which somebody is to finish.
Our soldiers, now returning, have left for us a great Aladdin's
window! They have erected a world cf freedom and democracy with
the window of brotherhood left for us to supply.
That Aladdin's window can be built with faith and confidence In
our government, our neighbors and ourselves.
Americans always have been so rich in these tiling that it Js in
conceivable to fail for lack of funds.
Let's create a window that is even more beautiful ituan' the
building itself. .

IT BELONGS TO THE WHOLE WORLD NOW
Declaration of Independence
IN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776
YfrilEN, In the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political
bands which have connected them with another, and
to assume, among the powers of the earth, the sep
arate and equal station to which the laws of nature
and of nature's God entitle them, n decent respect to
the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the cfluses which Impel them to the separa
tion. We hold these truths to be self-evident: That all
men are created equal ; that they are endowed by
.their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of hap
piness. That, to secure these rights, governments arc
instituted among men, deriving their just powers
from the consent of the governed; that, whenever
any form of government becomes destructive of
these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or
to abolish it, and to institute a new government,
laying its foundation on such principles, and or
ganizing its powers In such form, aa to them shall
seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
Prudence, Indeed, will dictate, that governments long
established should not be changed for light and
transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath
shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer
while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves
by abolishing the forms to which they are accus
tomed. But when a long train of abuses and usur
pations, pursuing invariably the same object, evinces
a design to reduce them under absolute despotism,
It Is their right, it is their duty, to throw oft such
government, and to provide new guards for their
future security. Such has been the patient suf
ferance of these colonies; and such Is now the neces
sity which constrains them to alter their former sys-..
tems of government. The history of, the present
King of Great Britain is a history of repeated in
juries and usurpations, all having In direct object
the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these
states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a
candid world.
- He has refused bis nssent to laws the most whole-f
some and necessary for the public good.
He has forbidden lr.s governors to pass laws of
immediate and pressing importance, unless suspend
ed in their operation till his assent should be ob
tained; and when so suspended, lie has utterly
neglected to attend to them.
Ha has refused to pass other laws for the ac
commodation of large districts of people, unless
those people would relinquish the right of represen
tation in the legislature a right inestimable to them,
and formidable to tyrants only.
He lias called together legislative bodies at places
unusual, .uncomfortable, and distant from the de
pository of their public records, for the sole pur
pose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
measure.
He has dissolved representative houses repeatedly,
for opposing, with manly firmness, his invasions 0:1
the rights of the people.
He has refused, for a long time after such diss
ltitions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the
legislative powers, Incapable of annihilation, have
returned to the people at large for their exercise:
the State remaining, in the meantime, exposed to :it:
the dangers of invasions from without, 'and con
vulsions within. . ....-
He has endeavored to prevent the population of
these Stales; fdr that purpose obstructing the laws
for the naturalization r of foreigners; refusing t;
pass others to encourage their migration hither, and
raising the conditions of new appropriations :
lands.
He has obstructed the administration of justice
by refusing his assent to laws for establishing judi
ciary powers.
He has made judges dependent on his will alone
for the tenure of their offices, and the amount am:
payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of new oflices, and 'sent
hither swarms of otlicers to harass our people and
eat out their substance.
He has kept among us in times of peace, standing
nrmios, without tlu consent of our legislatures.
He lias affected to render the military iiRkp.-nd'.'i.t
of. n nil superior to, the civil power.
He has combined with others to subject us to a
jurisdiction foreign to our constitutions, and un
acknowledged by our laws; giving his nssent to
their acts of pretended legislation :
For quartering large bodies of armed troops among
us;
For protecting them, by a mock trial, from pun
ishment for any murders which they should com
mit on the inhabitants of these States;
For cutting oft our trade with all parts of the
world ;
For imposing taxes on us without our consent;
For depriving us, In many cases, of the benefits
of trial by jury;
For transporting us beyond seas, to be tried for
pretended offences;
For abolishing the free system of English laws
in a neighboring province, establishing therein an
arbitrary government, and enlarging its boundaries,
so as to render It nt once nn example and fit In
strument for introducing the same absolute rule
into these colonies;
For taking away our charters, nl "shing our
most valuable laws, and altering, fundamentally, the
forms of our governments ; .-
For suspending onr own f legislatures, and declar
ing themselves Invested with power to legislate for
us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated government here, by declaring us
out of his protection, and vaging war against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts,
burned our towns, and destroyed the lives of our
people.
He is at this time transporting large armies of
foreign mercenaries to complete the works of death,
desolation, and tyranny, already begun with cir
cumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled
in the-most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy
the head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken cap
tive on the high seas, to bear arms against thrtf
country, to become the executioners of their friends
and brethren, or to fall themselves by their hands.
He has excited domestic insurrection among us.
and has endeavored to bring on the inhabitants of
our frontiers the merciless -Indian savages, ' whose
known rule of warfare is nn undistinguished destruc
tion of all ages, sexes, and conditions.
In every stage of thes oppressions we have peti
tioned for redress in the, most humble terms; our
repeated petitions have been answered only by re
peated injury. A prince whose character is thus
marked by "every act which may define a tyrant. Is
unfit to be the ruler bf a free people.
r'"r have we been wanting in our attentions to
onr British brethren. We have warned them, from
time to V,iue, of attempts by their legislature to ex
lend an unwarrantable Jurisdiction over us.. We
have reminded them of the circumstances . of our
emigration and settlement here. We have appealed
to their native justice and magnanimity; and we
have conjured them, by the ties of our common kin
dred, to disavow these usurpations, which would In
evitably interrupt our connections and correspond
ence. They, too, have been deaf to the voice of
iiistlce and consanguinity. We must, therefore, ac
quiesce in the necessity which denounces our separa
: ion, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind,
enemies in war, in peace friends.
We, therefore, the Representatives of the United
States of America, in General Congress assembled,
'ippealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the
rectitude of our "intentions, do, in the name and by
:he authority of the good people of these colonies,
solemnly publish and declare. That these united
Colonies are, and of right ought to be free and in
dependent states; that they are absolved from all
iille'giance to the British crown, and that all political
connection between them and the state of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved; and
iliat as free and Independent states, they have full
power to Iwy war, conclude peace, contract al
liances, establish commerce, and do all other acts
and things which independent states may of right
do. And, for the support of this declaration, with
a tlrm rcli::- -t on the protection of 'Divine Provi
dence, we i iiiially pledge to each other our lives,
our fortune, :iud our sacred honor. '

2 MILE TUNNEL AT CMLORIDE
KINGMAN, Ariz., July 3. -A two
mile tunnel Is planned by J. C. Ran
kin, to be driven near Chloride, to cut
the ground of the X-Ray, .Payroll, Re
demption, Rainbow, Silver Glance,
Lucky Boy and Brighter Day mines.
Mr. Rankin has formed a $2,000,000
company and has gone east with ex
pectation of securing ample capital.
At the tunnel portal is to be estab
lished a mill, for which an ample sup
ply of water will be afforded by the
drainage. Mine owners affected are
enthusiastic over the project as some
thing that would serve to cut their
production cost in half, as well a3 af
fording development at depths not
now attained.
Arizona Buttee at Stockton Hill has
a plan for tunneling at least 2.000
feet on it ground to a depth of 1200
feet. The bore already is 600 feet in
to the hill. Regular shipments of ore
now are being made from the prop
erty. The old Treasure Hill group, nine
miles north of Kingman, is being re
vived, with probability that a deep
tunnel will be driven.
R. P. Bogey of New York has taken
over the Moonlight group near Min
eral Park from John F. Gross. A new
hoist will be installed and sinking
will be resumed on the maiii shaft
at once.
SALT RIVER CANTELOUPES
IN SEASON NOW
PHOENIX, July 3. Cantaloupe
growers of the valley met this after
noon at the chamber of commerce
with E. M. Seifert, Jr., of .the United
States .bureau of markets. x Dally
meetings at 1:30 have been planned
by the cantaloupe men to enable them
to distribute the valley crop of can
teloupes to the eastern markets
where the demand warrants ship
ment. In this way the waste of pre
vious years from shipping the fruit
to places where it was not needed
will be avoided.
Seifert came here from Imperial
Valley, "where he has been handling
the- cantaloupe crop for the bureau of
markets. The season being finished
there, the local crop will be the main
stay of the mark for the next two
or three weeks. .

years ago, Mr. Simon showed about
town what he claimed was oil, found
on tho ranch. There was the usual
display of incredulity. He became
discouraged and dropped exploration.
Three months ago an oil scout trac
ing the formation .between the Santa
Rita mountains and the Catallnas,
visited the ranch and endeavored to
get a lease for the purpose of explo
ration. Since that time Mr. Simons,

INDIANS FLOOD
' FLAGSTAFF TO
ATTEND TRIAL
FLAGSTAFF July 3. Seeral hun
dred Indians some of whom drove
more than 150 miles in wagons have
arrived here to take part ' in the
Fourth of July celebration tomorrow,
and to attend the trial Saturday of
Adaltoni Bigue No. 1, and Adaltoni
Bigue No. 2, accused of the murder ot
Charles Hubbell near Oraiba, last
spring. The Indians are camped near
the fair grounds. The light of their
fires reminds one of the days when the
ground on which Flagstaff is built was
part of the Navajo reservation.
The trial of the two Adaltonis, one
of them a medicine man of the Navajo
tribe; and both sons of the old chief,
Uatiltony, is said to have stirred th
Interests of the Navajos, as no similar
case has done in many years. A num
ber of the Indians have been summon
ed as witness, while others of those
who arrived to await the outcome of
the trial have traveled from the ex
treme northeastern corner of Arizona,
and from New Mexico, Colorado and
Utah.
The charred body of Charles Hub
bell, trader and brother of former
State Senator Lorenzo Hubbell, was
found the morning of March 24 last,
in the ruins of his trading post, which
had been set afire. Two Navajos
were tracked from' the scene of the
crime, Oraiba, a small Indian village,
into the mountains of Northern Ari
zona, and later the Adaltonis were
captured by the Indian police.
Officers asserted that the elder of
the two, No. 1, confessed that he had
shot Hubbell during a quarrel over the
trader's dog, which the Indian said
had bitten them.

LOCATION FOR OBSERVATORY
PHOENIX, July 3. Returning to

must be stationed at least 1500 feet
above the level of the surrounding
plain so as to be free as possible
from dust. Then it should be in a
district where there is as little rain
as possible.
"Measurement of the sun's rays is
carried on by means of a bolometer,
a delicate instrument which acts on
the principle of recording the differ
ence in electrical conductivity caused
by the heat of the sun. A sky free
from clouds is also a great help In
getting these measurements.
"In parts of the country which I
explored, there is a bad haze caused
by the rising dust in the over-heated
air. Tlite fine desert dust la carried
upward by what is called convection
al currents. The air close to the
ground becomes hotter than the air
higher up, and expanding, it rises to
the upper strata, carrying the dust
along with it."
THREE MEN INJURED
IN BUILDING CRASH
YUMA, July 3. After putting on
the second story of the new cotton
giu which is being erected south ot
the Black Hills on the Southern Pa
cific railroad tracks, a little desert
"twister" came along, twisted the
building from its .foundation and
threw the "whole works" dow.n upon
the bodies of ; three men who were
constructing the same:
The men escaped with but slieht
injuries, but the thing that huits the
most is the knowledge that the work
will have to be started all over again,
for there is no protection against a
desert twister.

MAJ. GEN. ALLEN
PUT IN CHARGE
OF RHINE ARM
DRY DETROIT CAUSING
UNREST, SAYS GOMPERS
WASHINGTON. July 3. "Prohibi
tion in Detroit, Mich., has brought
about an industrial situation acute
anTl charged ith danger owing to
the spread of radicalism mul the
deadly doctrines of the 1. W. W.,
President Gonipors of the American
Federation of Labor, asserts in a re
port filed with the Senate judiciary
committee. 'The. .document, 'which
was made public today, supplements
Mr. .Gomper's . testimony , before the
committee June 14 opposing prohi
bition. '
Word has been received in Bisbee
that Major General Henry T. Allen
will succeed Lieutenant General
Hunter Liggett in command of the
forces on the Rhine, which is the
new title given the former Army of
Occupation.
Major General Allen formerly com
manded the 19th Division composed
of the national army troops from
Texas and Oklahoma. Gen. Allen was
born in Kentucky and entered West
Point in 1878 from that state.
Major General Allen was for some
time stationed at Ft. Huachuca in
command of the 5th Cavalry and wits
a rrc'iuent visitor to Bisbee. He ia
a man who has a most pleasing per-
sonality and will be remembered by
many people here for his sociablo
qualities. He was a real sportsman
and kept a string of nonius at the
fort while stationed tliCfe. Gen. Allen
is financially independent of the of
fice he holds in the army but he
likes the open life it affords and al
ways took a great interest iu all
athletics.
With the passage of time the Sen
ate's advice has accumulated much
more rapidly than its consent

that for immediate delivery increas
ingly eager, big basic metal industries

"Weekly bank clearings $6,210,

CHICAGO,. July 3. Sharply higher
prices in Argentina added today to
bullish sentiment here fegarding corn
and helped to lift the market to a new
high level for the season. Closing
quotations were strong at c to 2c
net advance, with September $1.844
t $1.84?a, and December $1.62 to
$1.62. Oats finished unchanged to
c lower. In provisions there were
gains of 10c to 50c.
Bulls in corn received fresh encour
agement from the fact that hog prices
had again surpassed all nigh recoras.
Dry, hot weather ,too, continued at
first to make the buying fever mora
intense, but was offset later as a re
sult of predictlons4that showers would
be general. However, dealers who pay
attention to calendar theories main
tained confidence that a bulge was
due for 1 July 4. Just in the nick of
time, advices came that since last Sat
urday there had been unusually rapid
upturns in prices at Buenos Aires.
This led to a. new wave of buying
orders. '
Prospects; of cooler, moist weather
eased the oats market.
Provisions reflected the rise-in the
hyg market and touched the highest
point yet this season for pork and ribs.

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 3. In further dis
regard of the protracted holiday and
again under impulse of easy money,
the stock market today continued in
a broader and more convincing man
ner the. advancing movement of ths
previous day. Many new records were
established for the year and in several
notable instances maximum Quotations
represented high prices for all preced
ing times. '
Various issues shared almost equal
ly in the activity and extent of gains,
but steels, tobaccos and moters were
the conspicuous features. Crucible
Steel, American Tobacco and Stutz
Motors making gains of 9 to 12 points.
United States Steel was in process
of steady accumulation, amounting to
the year's best price of 113 in the
extremely lively last hour and closing
a fraction under the top at a net ad
vance of 3 points.
Other stocks to record gross gains
of 2 to 77 points included Lackawanna,
Bethlehem and Republic Steels, Unit
ed States Rubber, United Cigars, Lor
illard Tobacco, New York Air Brake,
Harvester, International Paper, Bar
rett company and the sugar issues:
Rails again remained on the back
ground, though showing a firm under
tone, and shippings failed to retain
more than a part of their moderate
gains. Sales, 1.725,000 shares, last
transactions not being recorded until
15 minutes after the market's close.
Liberty issues were firm, but tho
general bond market indicated mod
erate irregularity on a relatively light
turnover. Total sales, par value
$9,850,000.
United States bonds were unchang

Waste Elimination
In Public Schools
Dr. J. H. Foster; in charge of the
summer session of the school for
teachers under the auspices of the
University of Arizona, was: tho speak
er at the regular weekly meeting of
the Luncheon Club at the Copper
Queen Cafe yesterday noon.
The subject which Dr. Foster chose
was that of wastefulness of the pub
lic school system in this country. He
stated that ""Next to the religious or
ganizations of the country the schools
were the most watseful of time and
money invested. The schools as a
general rule are used even less, and
no business organization could afford
to run on such a basis."-
Dr. Foster advocated, the year
around system as the best one and
one which gave the pupil the advant
age of the investment involved for
the full year. A pupil failing to pass
the examination could return for the
past quarter's work instead of going
back over a whole year's work and
thereby losing a year's time for the
few weeks instruction necessary to
pass the . examination.
J. C. Ryan, J. J. Bowen and WraJ
Gohring were appointed a nominating
committee to report nominations for
the new officers at the next meeting.
