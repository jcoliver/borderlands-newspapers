COCCHI TELLS GHASTLY
OF
(By Review Leased WJre). ,
BOLOGNA, Italy, June 25. The au-l
thorities who are investigating the his-',
tory of Alfred Cocchi, the slayer of
Ruth Cruger, in New York, have
brought to light the following addi-'
tional details concerning him: j
When he left Italy for the United
States he was in love with Maria Mag-!
rina, a servant in the Cocchi family,'
according to the police. Shortly after
bis arrival in New York. Cocchi, they
say, wrote her that business was go-'
ing well and promising to marry her
immediately if she would come to the
United States. I
Notwithstanding the hesitation of
her relatives, the girl insisted on go-;
ing to New York. A few weeks after:
her arrival, according to the police,;
Cocchi's bride wrote home, charging
Cocchi with unfaithfulness. Cocchi
was upbraided by his own relatives
and those of his wife for failure to
mend his ways. He wrote home hum-'
ble confessions of his wrongdoing. ;
but urged his people to endeavor to
induce his wife to be less jealous of

To Call for
War Volunteers
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, June 25. Patriotic
and civic societies, newspapers and
other semi-public agencies everywhere
are making a gratifying response to
the government's appeal for support in
the campaign of regular army recruit
ing week, and the war department of
ficials believe the next few days will
see a recruiting boom for the regu
lars unparalleled in the nation's his
tory. Reports from all over the country
indicate that the daily papers, as re
quested ty Secretary Baker, are tak
ing hold of the work vigorously and
are bringing forcibly to eligibles the
necessity of quick expansion of the
regular establishment, many of them
pointing that enlistment with the reg
ulars not only would give men eligible
for the draft an earlier opportunity
for service abroad, but would insure
that they go to the front under ex
perienced officers of tne line and with
equipment selected before the great
demands of the war army have to be'
met.
Officials. are emphasizing that the
plan of enlistments for the war only
offers an opportunity also for a man
over 31 and less than 40 to do his
share along with the younger men sub
ject to draft. President Wilson's
proclamation setting aside the re
cruiting week, it is pointed out, vir
tually amounts to a call for volunteers
among men of this class.
The recruiting figures for today,
which are expected to show the first
results of the publicity campaign and
really mark the beginning of recruit-1
ing work, will not be available until 1
tomorrow. During Saturday and Sun-!
day' nominally the first days of the
week set aside by the president, 915 .
men were recruited, with New York ;
leading the states with 132 men and ,
Pennsylvania second with 102. Since j
April 1, 124,959 war volunteers have ,
been enrolled. j

were surprised and even fearful that
something serious had occurred. In
reply to questions, Cocchi said he had
left New York because of the jealousy
of his wife and also that he desired to
join the colors. Shortly afterward a
letter arrived from Cocchi's wife in
which she is said to have asserted that
Cocchi had eloped with a girl 18 years
old after borrowing Mrs. Cocchi's total
possessions, fifteen dollars.
Cocchi denied the allegation. He

OF TORPEDOED SiiSF
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BASE OF THE AMERICAN FLO
TILLA IN BRITISH WATERS. June
25. One of the American destroyers
in the patx'jl flotilla reported this
morning that she was unable to find
any trace of the 50 members of the
crew of a British merchantman which
was being attacked by a submarine
when the American craft snatched the
Britisher's wireless distress call lrom
the air.
"Submarine shelling us," was the
first message the destroyer picked up.
The position showed the Britisher was
90 miles away, which meant a run of
five hours through high seas for the
destroyer.
The American craft was just getting
under full speed when her wireless
sounded the second and final message.
It read:
"Abandoning ship."
Only floating wreckage greeted the
American bluejackets when they
reached the scene, but they patrolled
th viclniyt l'jr two days in the hope
of finding some survivors. Owing to
the high seas it seems doubtful if any
of the sunken vessel's crew were res
cued by passing ships.

(By Review Aased Wire.)
MOSCOW, June 25. Elihu Root,
head of the American Mission Oich
Is visiting Russia today received the
Moscow journalistis and delivered to,
them a talk on the discipline in the
American camp.
Mr. Root explained that the Ameri
can officers either are educated in a
special military school or have risen
from the ranks, in the latter case only
after they have passed required exam
inations. Such a thing as the election
of officers by the different men was
unknown in the United States. There
were no soldiers committees there
and no participation by soldiers in
court martials.
The journalists asked Mr. Root
whether the active intervention of the
United States in the war would not
diminish the material support which
that country had previously given the
entente allies. Mr. Root answered in:
the negative, saying that all shops ,
working on armament would be taken'
under government control and their
production greatly increased. I

The second will provide a system

Valor and Value!
THE VALOR OF A SOLDIER isn't determined by the stripes on his sleeve
rtny more than the value of clothes is determined by the price on the sleeve ticket.
VALOR and VALUE are alike; they represent RESPECTIVELY what the soldier
POES and what a suit of clothes DOES.
The Clothes We Sell
pear very striking outward marks of superiority, their style is readily recognized as
f'SELECT;" they give the wearer a well-groomed appearance that many a custom tailor
envies. But their value is in the sum total o f the little detail that give life to the Idoks
and stamina to the quality. They wear, and keep looking good while they wear. You
simply cannot buy more value for your clothes money.
LIGHT WEIGHT, two-piece summer suits of Palm Beach Cloth, Flannel, Crash-O
and other breezy materials at $8.50 to $I0.and other breezy materials at $8.50 to $15.

Juice of Lemons!
How to Make Skin
White and Beautiful
' At the cost of a small jar of ordin
ary cold cream one can prepare a full
quarter pint of the most wonderful
lemon skin Softener and complexion
beautifier, by squeezing the juice of
two fresh lemons into a bottle con
taining three ounces of orchard white.
Care should be taken to strain the
juice through a fine cloth so no lemon
pulp gets in, then this lotion will keep
fresh for months. Every woman knows
that lemon juice is used to bleach and
remove such blemishes as sallowness,
freckles, and tan and is the ideal skin
softener, smoothener and beautifier.
Just try it! Get three ounces of
orchard white at any pharmacy and
two lemons from the grocer and make
up a quarter pint of this sweetly fra
grant lemon lotion and massage it
daily into the face, neck, arms and
hands. It naturally should help to
soften, freshen, bleach and bring out
the roses and beauty of any skin. It
is wonderful to smoothen rough, red
hands.

WASHINGTON, June 25. The df--j
solution of the duma and the council1
of empire, urged by the Pan-Russian j
conference of workmen end soldiers'
council was explained by members of;
the Russia mission here today as
merely another step in the building;
up of a new government in Russia. It!
does not indicate the slightest I'il
ity, it was said, between the councils
and the other parts of the government.
The duma, is was explained, ceased!
to exist what after its dissolution by,
the czar and its late extraordinary
sessions, it created out of itself the
provisional government. To this gov
ernment it entrusted complete legis
lative, executive and judicial powers,
and with lis birth the duma itself was
dissolved. Since then it has met only
once for a decennial ceremonial and
has bad absolutely no part in the gov
ernment. The council of the empire
was even less representative than the
duma, it was stated, as it was com
posed of appointees of the czar select
ed from various classes, such as capi
tal educational and agricultural and
fqrmer ministers.
Special Ambassador Boris Bakhm-
stieff, of the mission, will address the
senate tomorrow with special refer
ence to the foreign relations of the
new provisional Russian government.
It is understood to be-the purpose of
the new government to announce
broad principles of diplomacy under
which the present war should be con
ducted without going into the great
details as to their specific application.
One of the main reasons why Rus
sia has proposed a conference of the
allies is understood to be the uncer
tainty there as to just what treaties
Russia is bonud by. The former czar
is said to .ha,ve signed many interna
tional agreements without consulta
tion of subsequent reference to his
ministers, and it is thought possible
that some of the allied nations may
be holding Russia to engagements
which the present Russian government
has never seen.

EMPLOYEE'S WELFARE COMMITTEE.
Through the quarterly bulletin of the Hospital
Committee of the Copper Queen Branch of the
Phelps Dodge Corporation, announcement is made of
an increase in the activities of the committee which
will mean much to the end that a better and clever
feeling may exist between employer and employe in
the local mines of the company. In addition to
handling of all matters, for the men, which effect
their welfare, both in Bisbee and in Douglas.
More than a year ago the miners, surface employes
and smelter-men of the Copper Queen selected a
committee of five men, from their number, to repre
sent them in the hospital department of the com
pany. Through this committee, grievances of the
employees, against the hospital and the general medi
cal service, were transmitted to the company officials.
The success of the plan has been great and the
company, with such results In view, decided some
time ago to enlarge the sphere of its activities.
The committee, first selected, and re-elected this
year with the exception of the Douglas member, who
was supplanted by another. At the preeent time the
personnel of the committee consists of: Bisbee, un
derground, Sam Verran, James Hileman, Roger Ken
nedy; surface, George Perry; Douglas, A. D. Frost.
This committee will represent the employees. It
will be the organization through which any and all
grievances may reach the officials of the company.
Then, too, through this committee many valuable sug
gestions for both the men and the company will
reach the proper quarters for attention. It will mean
th opening of a channel of communication, protect
and suggestion for the man.
The growth of the idea has been logical and natur
al. Seeing the success attained through the hospital
committee, the company feels that, with the scope
of the committee's activities enlarged to include the
employer's general welfare, a better understanding
and an era of complete good feeling will be the in
evitable result.
the Uaited States must win, the effect of them, if suc
cessful, would be to help Germany win and the United
States to lose."
"The 'pickets' of a misled cause should be run in
declares the New York Herald in discussing the inci
dent. "At best they are an unseemly nuisance. At worst
they are becoming an agency of sedition."
The banner, heretofore referred to, is rather all-in
elusive. The people who inscribed it were rather broad
in their statements, generally. It shows how a righteous
cause may be injured and set back by the pernicious
activities of some of its leaders.
Arizona women, and women from other suffrage states.
will look askance at the attitude of their Washington
sisters. That they are not in favor of the methods pur
sued seems apparent It would appear that the Eastern
women had best come to Arizona and learn how to be
have during a national emergency. -
"PICKETING" THE WHITE HOUSE.
Arizona women, women who vote "and who secured
the right to vote in an orderly, sane manner, can not
but find in the activities of the suffragists in Washing
ton, who persist in "picketing" the White. House, all that
is untimely to the cause of suffrage and much that Is
reprehensible at the present time of national danger and
need.
Last week, in the capital city, when the Russian com
mission came to this country, the suffragists held a ban
ner by the White House gates on which the following in
scription appeared:
"To the Russian Mission: President Wilson and Envoy
Root are deceiving Russia. They say 'We are a Demo
cracy. Help us win a world war so that Democracy may
Burvive.'
"We, the women of America, tell you that America is
not a democracy. .Twenty million American women are
denied the right to vote. President Wilson is the chief
opponent of their national enfranchisement.
"Help us make this nation free. Tell our government
it must liberate its people before it can claim free Russia
as an ally."
It is doubtful if the Russian commissioners saw the
banner. It is not doubtful, however, what several thou
sands of good Americans men and women thought of
the banner They tore it down and trampled it into the
ground.
Woman suffrage is an accomplished fact in most of
the western states. It was given to them because the
west thought they deserved It. It was given to them
through the state. The eastern women, unable to per
suade their husbands and brothers of their sincere in
terest in the ballot, have not been granted the right of
franchise. In lieu, therefore, of turning their guns of
activity on their own males, they have sought to pre
judice public opinion against President Wilson, a known
advocate of universal suffrage. At L'ie present time,
their "pickets" and their "campaign" appears in the
light of near-rebellion.
"The purpose of these and a hundred other activities
is to incite rebellion," aptly remarks the New York
Times, "Either active or passive, and to hamper the gov
ernment, m prosecutiug the war. Since either Genua uy or
THE DIRTY DOUGH BOY.
' The real man of war is the infantryman, the dirty dough
boy carrying his sixty pound pack and his razor edge
bayonet, says the Chicago Tribune. He is the boy who
does the work and takes it at its hardest, dirtiest, and
cruelest. He does not get the glamour, he gets the pun
ishment
The aviator soars to two hours of danger in the sweep
and dash of the most chivalrous, romanticized effort of
war and descends to ten of admiration, to lunch, and
pretty women or in a crumpled machine to a wreath of
immortalles.
The cavalryman may swagger through popular ap
plause. The artilleryman does his work pounding infant
rymen back of the trenches. When his guns ar located
he gets a pounding himself. There are heavy gun batter
ies in Germany which, it was said recently, have not lost
a man. The gunner has a better chance than the dough
boy, and no one pays any attention to the duogh boy.
He does not gethe roses. He gets the mud. He
wades in water to his waist He sits in dugouts and
takes artillery fire until the enemy concludes that he
has been blown into fragments and he takes it- with' com
rades scattered in bits all about him, waiting until the
infantry on the other side come across at him with bombs
and bayonets.
He waits until his own artillery has ripped, beaten,
and torn the trench across the way and then he goes
over the top,' across No Man's land, swept by machine
gun fire, and to hand grips with an enemy keen to bayonet
him and exterminate him in a nasty, personal way.
He falls into shell holes and drags himself through
filth. He Is plagued by rats and vermin. His food supply
is cut off and he starves. He is the boy who does the
work, and the smiles and flowers go elsewhere. He is
the hero of war, the tough," dirty, unconscious hero of
war, and if any one paid any attention to him he'd drop
dead.

"There is no longer an ocean,", says a French writer.
in his joy at the coming of American troops to help France
fight for life and freedom. "Henceforth there is but one

The German submarines may have something to say
as to whether the Atlantic Ocean has been abolished.
But In its deper meaning at least this utterance is true.
The free and enlightened nations of both hemispheres
are united in organization and In spiritual purpose a3

Who would have imagined, three years ago, that within
this brief period peoples so diverse in race, language, en
vironment and material interests as the French, British,
Belgians, Italians. Serbians, Russians, Americans, Can
adians, Australians and South Africans would be pooling
their men and wealth, forgetting their prejudices and
enmities and common ideals?
This fact of international co-operation is one of the
things that seem almost to compensate for the horror and
waste of the war yea-, while we are in the midst of it and
the end seems distant and dim. Though our definite aims
should fail of realization, we have at least made this gain.
This victory over provincial ignorance and prejudice is
secure.
Peoples have learned to understand one another, govern

The "internationalism" of which Socialists have dream

brotherhood is here, demonstrably established, embrac

should there be any step backward hereafter? Why may
we not hope that the fraternal co-operation we see now
should become permanent and universal, for the purposes

PROSECUTION SAYS
MRS. MOONEY PARTY
TO REVOLUTION PLOT
Court Rules State May Intro
duce Evidence of Sensation
al Conspiracy During Trial
of Woman For Murder.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO, June 25. After
two hours of argument on the admis
sibility of evidence tending to prove
that Mrs. Rena Mooney, on trial for
murder, had taken part in an alleged
anarchistic conspiracy, starting in
1913 and culminating in the bomb ex
plosion which claimed ten lives here
last July, Superior Judge Emmett Sea
well permitted the state to proceed
with this line of testimony late to
day. The rulings were made over vigorous
objections by attorneys for the de
fense. Assistant District Attorney
Louis Ferrari told the court that step
by step he would unfold the details or
a conspiracy which, he charged, had
pillage, civil strife and reveloution as
its chief objects. He said he would
directly connect Mrs. Mooney with the
conspiracy and would prove through
testimony and exhibits that the bomb
expolsion, although not originally in
the alleged anarchistic plot, was an
outgrowth of a plot against the gov
ernment and the existing social order.
Immediately after - the ruling was
made, the state' began to introduce
testimony to prove its conspiracy con
tention, i
Three Socramento detectives testi
fied to the arrest of Warren K. Bill
ings, now under a sentence of life im
prisonment for one of the bomb mur
ders, in Sacramento in September,
1913, on a charge of unlawfully trans
porting dynamite.
All three officers said that Mrs.
Mooney was in attendance at the pre
liminary hearing and trial of Billings
and that she took notes on the Sacra
mento trial.
S. E. Meyer, who was the Sacra
menta county jailer in 1913. said Mrs.
Mooney had visited Billings in the jail
at least six times.
G. Gregoris. South Vallejo fisher
man testified to having sold Thomas
J. Mooney, now under sentence of
death for one of the bomb murders, a
sail boat in Demember, 1913. It was
in this sail boat that Mooney was al
leged to have transported dynamit-;,
which the state contends, was to have
been used Tn blowing up the Pacific
Gas and Electric company towers.
The defense objected to Gregoris'
testimony, pointing out that Mooney
had been tried and found not guilty
of this dynamiting. This objection
was overruled.
Gregoris Identified Mrs. Mooney as
the woman who had talked to him re
garding the details of the boat sail
ing, after Mooney's trial had been fin
ished. The state attempted to introduce ns
evidence a small box rontaining a
number of dry-cell batteries and an
alarm clock, with a device attached
which the state contends, was for de
tonating bombs. Mooney was alleged
to have put this box in the sail bout.
The court permitted Gregoris to iden
tify the box but not its contents.

Kingdom Now Has Stronger And Better Equipped Army
Than Before The War, Declares Military Member of
War Mission In Address To Members of Press Club;
Washington Scribes Hear Graphic Account of Resistance
That Prevented Germans From Taking Country.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
II TASHINGTON, June 25. The Belgian army is larger.
J better equipped and more determined today than it was
at the beginning of the war, said Lieutenant General Le
Clercq, military member of the Belgian mission in an address
tonight at the National Press Club.
" 'The king without a country " said General Le Clercq,
"is an expression the German newspapers use to designate our
sovereign. This is not quite accurate. There remains a part
of Belgium still unviolated. The German hordes have, not
succeeded in passing the Yser. The Germans shall never con
quer this small corner of our country."
Besides rehabilating their army after terrible losses, the
eeneral declared his country has set up munitions factories
abroad, one at Havre with 1 5,000 workmen and two a Rich
mond and Letchworth in England with 35,000 while the Royal
Belgian Llovd, with $50,000,000 capital, assures transporta
tion at sea. Special schools train the maimed and the crippled
for whatever work their disabilities make possible.
General Describes Victory Over Germans
The Belgian army now occupies a
front of 22 miles with eight divisions,
including two cavalry. The land Is low
and flat, requiring millions of sand
bags for defense.
"Xothing remains," said General Le
Clercq, "in the battle rone where once
there were great fields filled with
cattle, Flemish farms and green trees.
Theonly bright note, if I may so call
it, are the graves of those who have
poured out their blood for their native
land, serving as an encouragement to
their living comrades, to whom they
say and incessantly 'repeat: 'Avenge
us. Do your duty'."
Upon Belgium's first victory of the
war at Liege the general dwejt at
length. There he said, his country
men, barely one hundred thousand
strong, met at least three times aa
many Germans, inflicted losses admit
ted by Gerriany to total 42,714 and
paralyzed for 13 days the great inva
sion which after forty years of meth
odical preparation was expected to be
irresistable.
"The Germans had organized a for
midable war machine whose wheels
were adjusted wun absolute precis
ion," he added. "The resistance of
Belgium at Liege was the little grain
01 sana wnicn tnrew the whole ma
chinery out of gear at the very com
mencement, as it permitted the French
to gain precious time."
After picturing the ruthless destruc
tion of men, women and children that
followed the fall of Liege, the gener
al told of the Belgian attack upon the
Germans' flank, in the battle of the
Marne, of the brave defense of Ant
werp, of the fighting at the Yser and
finally by the inundation of Flanders
to drive out the enemy and make solid
the line thrown by the allies across
the road to Calais
"In Africa, too," the general contin
ued, "we have met the Germans. Our
colonial army of 18.000 colored troops
! before the war, was increased to 23,-
000 and dedicated itself to inflicting a
merited punishment for the unjust in
vasion of the mother country. Bel
gium has gained a territory of incal
culable value with a population of 8,
000.000 and an area twice that of Bel
gium itself, and offering the most fav
orable commercial resources."

WASHINGTON, June 23. L'arly set
tlement of China's roubles was fore
cast today in dispatches to the state
department telling of the beneficial ef-,
feet of the recent American note.
The new cabinet, according to lega-1
tion advices, is to be a coalition body j
with representatives of both the con-j
stitutionaltsts and the militarists.
Li Ching Hsi, whom the President
Li had unsuccessfully sought for pre
mier after the dismissal of Tuan Chi
Jut, notified the legation that he had
accepted the post in the belief that the
two factions sad solved their differ
ences and that pease was at hand.
General Wang Shih Chen, former chief ,
of the general staff, is named as min-!
ister of war after having been named
for a similar position in the secession
ist government. Admiral Sir S;ih
Chen Ching is minister of the navy.
The American note to China urinK
both factions to compose their differ
ences, about which so much misundcr-1
standing centered, was reported to the
department as having created a very
favorable impression in China. Great ;
Britain. Japan and France declined to
follow this country's course of action
on the ground that any susgpstions

Transfer of Measure From
House To Senate Is Ac
companied By Prediction of
Early Government Action.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, June 23 Formal
transfer from the house to the senate
today of the administration food con
trol bill with its new and drastic pro
hibition features added in the house,
was accompanied by prediction that
the legislation would be passed by the
senate within ten days and finally en
acted in time to deal with this sea
son's crops.
While dfbte on jthe Chamberlain
draft of the bill continued on the
senate, the measure as it. passed the
house was referred to the agricultural
committee.
Material changes which the' admin
istration leaders have agreed to ac
cept and which the sub-committee may
adopt tomorrow are expected to allay
opposition to a larjie degree. Thete
amendments propose:
Kxtension of government control ov
er food, feed and fuels as provided in
the Lever bill, to many other basic
articles, including iron and steel and
their products, oil. copper, lead. zinc,
aluminum, pla'inum, farm implements,
fertilizers and binding twine.
Elimination of the provision for reg
ulation of consumption, to insure that
the food administration shall not reg
ulate individuals.
Inc'nsion of a new section to insure
that, control of farmers' production or
storKe of his own products cannot
be attempted and.
An addition to the licensing section
to make clear that the charges to be
fixed shall relate to storage and oth
er middlemen's handling.
supply the neutral nations whose peo
ples demand upon us for such sup
plies as nearly in proportion to their
need as the amount to be divided per
mits.
"There will, thus, be little check put
upon the volume of exports and prices
obtained for them will not be affected
by this regulation.
"This policy will be carried out, not
by prohibitive regulations, therefore,
but by a system of licensing exports
which will be as 6lmply organized and
administered as possible, so as to con
stitute no impediment to the normal
flow of commerce. In brief, the free
play of trade will not be arbitrarily in
terfered with. It will be intelligently
and systematically directed In the
light of full information with regard
to needs and market conditions
throughout the world and the neces
sities of our people at home and our
armies and the armies of our associ
ates abroad.
To Tabulate Supply.
"The government Is taking, or has
taken steps to ascertain for example,
just what the available present sup
ply of wheat and corn is remaining
from the crops of last year; to learn
from each of the countries exporting
those ' foodstuffs from the United
States what their purchases! in this
country now are. and where they are
stored; and what their needs are in
order that we may adjust things so
far as possible to our own needs and
free stocks; and this information is in
course of being rapidly supplied.
"The case of wheat and corn will
serve as an illustration of all the rest
of supplies of all kinds. Our trade
can be successfully and profitably
conducted now, the war pushed to -a
victorious issue, and the needs of our
own people and of the other peoples
with whom we are still free to trade
efficiently met only by systematic di
rection; and that is what will be at
tempted." Proclamations to follow will name
specific commodities which may not
be shipped anywhere without licenses.
The first commodities to be designated
will be cereals and other foodstuffs.
By degrees the Mst will be extended
until virtually every export commod
ity is brought under operation of Uie
act.
The proclamations covering coal and
exports to European neutrals probab
ly will be issued this week. Under
the arrangements to be made with the
British government providing for an
international shipping control the
United States and Great Britain will
have the trade of the world in their
hands to direct in the manner best
calculated to assist in winning the
war.
America First.
The neutral export proclamation
will be hurried to prevent removal
from the United State of large sup
plies of foodstuffs awaiting shipment.
The government is determined to hold
neutrals to necessities. American
agents to be sent into the neutral
countries will be charged with re
sponsibility for seeing that American
supplies stop before reaching the Ger
man border.
Collectors of customs, who are un
der the treasury department will be
charged with preventing unlicensed
cargoes from leaving the country.
A policy regarding food exports will
be formulated by the food administra
tion to be approved by the exports
council.
The American food supply. It is I
made clear, will be used first to feed i
this country, second to feed the allies,
and what is left will go to neutrals. I

between the mayor and council, which '
has developed into an effort to oust j

appointment of the new board which
precipitated the conflict between the

tion in adjourning the session Friday.
He charged that Alderman Wallace
had thrown a book at him and that the
council acted boisterously and riotous
ly.. and that according to rules of or
der be was justified in adjourning the
meeting. An opinion was attached,
written by the corporation counsel,
which held that tae council had no
power to reconsider its vote on school
b'oard appointments.
The judiciary committee of the
council, meeting tor consider resolu

the major's resignation, decided to
take no action until Mr. Thompson had
been heard. After extending him an
invitation to appear before the com
mittee, adjournment was taken.

ing, he added Miss Cruger must have
struck some vital spot because he
suddenly discovered that she was
dead.
In an attempt to conceal the crime
he carried the body into the cellar and
buried it in a hole that had been used
to store gasoline.
Later, ' according to the police,
Cocchi said he spent two days and
one night before sailing for Italy in
the Jiouse of a priest in Carlton
Street, New York.
Police Suspended.
NEW YORK. June 25. The entire
motorcycle squad, some of whose mem
bers already have been suspended by
Arthur Woods, police commissioner,
in connection with the Ruth Cruger
case, were ordered to report at head
quarters today with all reports and
summonses for the last two years. All
other policemen who saw duty with
the motorcycle force during that per
Ido, but now are on other duty, also
were instructed to appear with their
records.
Miss Helen Cruger, sister of the
murdered girl, testified today before
Leonard M. Wallstein, commissioner of
accounts at the inquiry into the hand
ling of the case, that she received
only scant consideration from the offi
cials to whom she appealed to find her
sister.
Henry D. Cruger, the father also
testified that the police had manifest
ed little interest in the case. He for
mally demanded, he said, that Alfredo
Cocchi's bicycle repair shop be
searched and the only search made
was perfunctory.
Edward Swann, district attorney,
who is conducting an inquiry said to
day that the murder case against
Cocchi was complete and if Cocchi
cannot be brought here for trial, he Is
prepared to present a complete case
against him in the Italian courts.
Priest Denies Report.
A report from Italy that prior to his
flight. CAc'chi had passed two days and
a night in the house of Father Mor
etto, chaplain of a home for immi
grant girls in this city, was denied to
night by the priest.
Deputy police Commission Lord an
nounced tonight that he had had a
conference with Father Moretto and
that the priest had made the follow
ing statement:
"Some day in February, I returned
from Ellis Island. I found Cocchi at
my home. He had been waiting two
hours. I had not seen Cocchi for five
years.
"I heard his confession as a priest,
after which he left and did not tell
me where he was going.
"About a month later. Miss Helen
Cruger and. a young man called at the
home and asked if Cocchi had been
there. I told them he had not. Inas
much as they were not officers, I did
not think it necessary that I should
give them the information."

WASHINGTON, June 25. More
than a dozen suffragists were arrest
ed late today when they marched in

rage banners. A crowd of hundreds
watched the arrests but there was no
disorder.

ONE KILLED, SGORE
HliRTJN IRISH RIOT
Police Charge Mob With Bay-

. ing Attempt To Storm Cork
Jail; Rioters Quelled.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
CORK, June 25. One manjcilled and
a score injured was the toll in yester
day's conflict between Sinn Feiners
and the police. Serious disorders oc
curred, including an attack on the,jial
in an effort to liberate the political
prisoners detained there, and attacks
on various military recruiting quarters
in the center of the town.
A number of the clergy pleaded in
vain with the Sinn Feiners to keep the
peace, but finally the police, armed
with carbines, bayonets and revolvers,
charged at double quick down Patrick
street. Some of the crowd stood their
ground, replying with a fusillade of
.clubs and stones, but the majoirty fled
ifafj the adjacent streets. The in
i jured were quickly gathered up by
j stretcher bearers and taken to the bos
; pital.
Soldiers were called out. They
planted machine guns in the center of
Patrick street and patrolled the scene
of the disturbances until early this
morning, when quiet was restored.

Mexicans Disarming
American Mormons
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DOUGLAS, June 25. Mexican resi
dents of the Batepito valley in the vi
cinity of Colonia Morelos, 60 miles
southeast of Douglas, disarmed 15
American Mormons who reside there.
At the same time they took possession
of several thousand acres of irrigated
and improved land owned by other
members of the colony driven out
about a year ago. The Mexicans an
nounced they would keep this land.
This was the text of a report re
ceived by Mormons here late today. It
was feared by the colonists that they
would also be dispossessed and driven
from the country."
Mexicans Change Their Mind
And Decide To Plead Guilty.
And Work On The Cochise
County Roads.
Jesus Montant and Jose Salazar,
sons of Moctezuma, are languishing in
the county jail. And for what, senor?
A mere slip of the tongue, no more.
They said a heavy cargo of booze they
had in their car was intended for con
sumption in Sonora and not Arizona.
Oh, dear no.
County Attorney John F. Ross lost
three cases of that kind recently, when ,
Mexicans said they intended to take
whiskey to Mexico, so after consider
able thought he had evolved a plan of
action for the sheriffs Office.
Acting under these Instructions, Dep-!
uty Sheriffs Harry Rafferty and Allie ;
Howe took the two Mexicans out of
the jail.
"Vaminor, hombres!" said Rafferty,
who is some shark on lingo.
"Where?" asked the Mexicans.
"You said you were going to lake
tihs liquor to Sonora. We are going to
the border with you to see that you
get it safely across. Of course, we
had to telephone our friends, the offi
cers in Naco, Sonora, that you were
coming ,but you won't mind that, hav-'
ing a good stand in."
Strange to say, there was "nothing
doing." Men bave been shot for boot-;
legging in Sonora. and neither Jesus j
nor Jose thought he would loOk well
with wings and a golden harp. They '.
decided to remain in Cochise county, j
plead guilty to introducing Jiquor and ;
make big rocks into little ones.
