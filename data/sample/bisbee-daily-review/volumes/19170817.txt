News of the premier's speech came
while the state department was receiv

c3ice the text of Pope Benedict's mes
sage to the leaders of all belligerent
nations proposing basis for peace
negotiations and earnestly -'appealing
fr.r Its consideration. In entente dip
lomatic quarters and among govern
ment officials Mr. Lloyd-George's an
nouncement of Improvement in food
conditions, removing the danger of
Englrnd being starved into submission,
his assurance that losses through sub
marine attacks continued to decrease
and his declaration that ther would
be sufficient tonnage for 1918 and 1919,
were hailed joyfully as a sign of Great
Britain's safe position and firm atti
tude. The pope's message was laid
before President Wilson by Secretary
Lansing. Important conferences
which must precede a reply will begin
shortly, but necessarily some time
must elapse before the response goes
forward.
Lansing Silent.
While there already have been many
Informal conferences among officials j
and diplomats regarding the pope's j
proposals, tt may be stated on Secre- j
tary Lansing's authority that the sec- j

subject with the president and also
tas refrained from communicating his
views regarding the character of reply j
which should be made id any of tho i
many diplomatic callers he has bad
since the first press notice of the dis

Mr. Lansing has felt that it would
be improper to indicate even in a per
sonal way what he thought of the
communication and he has also depre
cated any attempt by the newspapers
to forecast the action of the govern-
nient in this matter, as likely to prove j
very embarrassing.

SENATE SUCCEEDS
IN PASSING MANY
PARTS OF WAR BILL
Liquor Section of the Measure
Is Passed by Upper Branch
Other Sections Receive
Final Action by the Same
Body.
By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Aug. 16. Many im
portant provisions of the revised war
tax -bill, including tba liquor section,
were tentatively approved by the sen
ate late today after most of the day's
session bad been spent tin general
debate.
Most of the uncontested sections
will be disposed of tomorrow. The
principa lcontests, over Income and
war profits taxes, are set for Saturday
when, Senator Simmons, in charge of
the bill, may 'seek 'to set a date for
final vote on the measure.
Provisions approved today virtually
without debate and which will be prob
ably unchanged, are: '
Booze Taxed High
Sections levying $ 140,000,000 addi
tional taxes on distilled and rectified
spirits, and including clauses effective
during the war prohibiting their im
portation and providing a prohibitory
tax of $60 per hundred pounds upon
their further manufacture from food
stuffs. The house bill levied $107,
500,000 additional taxes and prohibit
ed the manufacture of distilled spirits
only. .
BeerJUco in Bill
Increase of revenue from beer and
other malt and fermented liquors of
$60,000,000 as compared with $37,500,
000 under the house bill.
Virtually all of the stamp taxes pro
posed, except that of bank checks and
parcel poeit packages, which went over.
Amusement Taxes
The amusement tax section, estimat
ed to raise $23,000,000, compared with
$60,000,000 proposed by the house, with
the house tax on club dues elimin
ated. Elimination of the bwuse general
tariff levy of 10 per cent advalorem,
and of the 'house- taxes ton jewelry,
musical .instruments and moving pic
ture films. ' '
Amendments Accepted
The senate also adopted committee
amendments for a new tax upon cam
eras to raise $500,000 for reduction of
the manufacturers' gross sales tax.
from 5 to 20 per cent on perfume and
patent medicines. Committee changes
reducing the rates On sporting goods
to raise $800,000 instead of $2,000,000
and for a substitute tax on yachts and
other pleasure boats, also was accept
ed. Sugar Is Subject
Debate today was confined largely
to the sugar "drakback" and war pro
fits provisions. Senator Broussard
spoke at length for repeal Of the draw
back, declaring it benefits the refiners'
"trust" only, end causes higher prices
for sugar to all consumers. Senator
Bankhead again attacked the propos
ed war profits section as grossly un
just to small business Interests.
The only discussion of the whisky
and beer provisions was by Senator
Jones of Washington, a prohibition
advocate, who said the increased taxes
are welcomed by the liquor Interests
in their fight against prohibition. Tem
perance organizations of the nation, he
declared, favored repeal Of revenues
from Intoxicants.
ATTEMPTS OF AGITATORS TO HINDER
TIME
111
(By Review Leased Wire).
ASHINGTON. Aug. 16. Crave
w
menace to industries whose
continuation at high speed Is
deemed vital to the prosecution
; of the war is seen by officials here in
the growing activities of Industrial
i Workers of the World leaders on the
j Pacific coast and in the far northwest.
I The movement apparently Is near
I ing its maximum and the full scope of
its possibilities is not minimized here.
A pretentious program calling for
, strikes, lockouts and general disturb
- ances over seven states, or about ona
! fourth of the area of the country, has
been brought to the attention of the
department of justice by scores of ex
pert field investigators now in the af
fected territory. (
Swift and drastic action to check
the movement. Insofar ' as it would
cripple industries or curtail produc
tion of commodities necessary for war,
is planned by department of justice
officials.
To Prosecute Leaders
Prosecution of strike leaders, justi
fied, in the opinion of the department,
on charges of conspiracy or under the
espionage act, is contemplated In spe
cific cases, but no general prosecution
of I. W. W. leaders Is expected.
The entire mevoment, culminating
yesterday in the declaration at Spo-j
kane of James Rowan, district secre
tary of the organization, that a general
strike would be called August 20 In
Washington, Oregon, Montana and
Idaho unless certain demands were
complied with, is regarded by many
officials as being political and not a
labor movement
District attorneys in the four state
affected, as well as in California, Ari
zona and New Mexico, have been in
structed to devote-unceasing attention
to the situation and to institute prose
cutions promptly where justified.
Mo.itana Closely Watched
Officials here are much interested in
the Rowan demand for a ten-hour day
in the harvest fields. Any organized
movement, it was said, tending to pre
vent or delay the harvesting of crops
in any section would come clearly
within the class of subjects with which
the president has been authorized in
the war resolution to deal with sum
marily. Another industry which has already
been affected to some extent by activi
ties traceable to L W. W. sympathis
ers Is spruce logging in Washingtoa.j
At one stage of the labor disturbances
the government's great program of
aircraft construction appeared to bej
menaced, but the situation in this in
dustry has been restored more nearly
to normal within the past few days.
A third industry which might be se
riously affected by general I. W. W.
strikes, it is said, is copper mining rtt
Montana. The government Is follow-!
ing this situation closely. v

Premier Lloyd-George. The people of
the British Isles cannot be starved
notwithstanding the German submar

tion grows more hopeful. The difficul

their power increase, while the troub

power fall away.
"This is the supreme hour for pa

clusion. "For courage, for endurance,
for hope, for unity. Let us go through
this hour with a temper that will en
able us to destroy a great military
despotism. Let us go through this

A'
GAIN the great Anelo-
Fjench war machine has
struck the Germans in
Flanders and again it has been
successful. The village of
Langemarcke and other impor
tant positions were taken on
Thursday and more than 1 ,800
prisoners have been counted.
The latest blow in the Ypres
area was on a front of nine
miles and only on the extreme
right were the allied forces un
able to make progress. The
Germans resisted stubbornly,
suffering heavy losses, but on
the greater of the part they
were forced to leave valuable
positions in the possession of
the allies.
Before the fighting between Lens
and Loqs had died out the French and
i British moved forward north of the
j Yprez-Menin road. Throughtuot
Thursday bitter fighting continued. On
the left the French occupied the
ground between the Tser canal and
Martjevaart and then drove the Ger
mans from the Important bridgehead
of Dreigrachten.
Trench System Gained.
Field-Marshal Haig's men carried
the center and right of the attacking
line. In the center the British early
gained their first objectives and then
established themselves In Lange
marcke. Continuing their attack, they
advanced a half-mile beyond the vil
lage, gaining a trench system which
was the final objective of the day.
On the right flank the German re
sistance was more desperate. Early in
the day the British drove the Teutons
back, but numerous counter-attacks, in
which they suffered Bevefely, enables -the
Germans to regain the lost ground.
In the Lens sector the Canadians
made further progress east of Loos and
north of Iens. German prisoners to
the number of nearly 900 were taken
in the fighting here Wednesday and
Thursday, bringing the allied total
for the two days to 2.700. In Flan
ders the British also captured some
guns from the Germans.
Although Berlin says the allied at
tack in Flanders was - forced back
with heavy losses, it admits French
and British gains at Dreigrachten. on
the Yser canal and near Langemarcke.
These are the places where London
officially says the French and British

numerous attacks in efforts to capture
' Stracani and Pantziu. In the Trotus
valley, the Austro-Gennan advance ap
parently continues. Berlin says that
the forces of Field-Marebal von Mftck
ensen have captured more than 3,500

Counter Attacks Fail.
BRITISH FRONT IN FRANCE AND
BELGIUM, August 16, 10 a. m. Forces
of the entente allies at daybreak, to
day began another drive against troops
of Crown Prince Ruppercht of Bava
ria, along a wide front from a point
opposite Polygon wood, east of Ypres,
to the left of the French positions on
the northward.
In the first onslaught the right flank
of the French surged across the Steen
beke river 'at the same time the left
wing pushed forward correspondingly.
Meanwhile the Canadians were hold
ing strongly Hill 70 and all the other
positions which they wrested from
the Germans about Lens yesterday, af
ter having beaten off ten furious counter-
attacks in which the enemy suf
fered reavy casualties.
Hand to Hand Fighting.
The last German counter-attack of
the-night occurred at half past nine
giving the British a chance to consol
idate their new lines. The checking
up of the British casualties this morn
ing indicated that they had been mod
erate. ' . '
The German rounter-attacks were
most dtermined and resulted in fierce
hand to hand fighting among the
wrecked buildings in the suburbs of
Lens. Following their usual methods,
the Germansc hurled their men into
the combat without apparent thought
of the coast of life, and the result
was most disastrous. .
Division Wiped Out.
Among the heaviest sufferers were
the fourth division of the Prussian
Guard, who were sent into the battle
late, to endeavor to regain the lost
positions. The famous troops advanc
ed in columns of fours and immedi
ately were met by a concentrated ma
chine gun " fire which mowed them
down in large numbers.
Wave after wave of the guardsmen '
were sent up into the terrific bail of
death, and each succeeding wave met ',
the fate of the former wave, until vir-:
tually the entire division had been an-;
nihilated. . i
Tho German artiller gav ethe Brit-,

of the Polygon Wood. In all this re
gion heavy fighting was in progress.
especially in the vicinity of Polygon
Wood and the neighboring forests.- At
this time it is impossible to give more
than a general idea of the events that
are transpiring, since the signal was
given a few hours ago for an advance.
There is little doubt, however, that the
German troops engaged have been
dealt a heavy blow and that the Brit
ish have made appreciable advances at
man points in this difficult territory.
The preliminary bombardment by
the British artillery worked havlc in
the Gemma ranks according to prison
ers. All night the heavy guns pounded
a steady stream of shells into the
small forts and the fortified farms In
which the Germans had established
machine gun squads, and many of their
defenses were wiped out or made un
tenable. About Langemarcke, where heavy
fighting occurred, the seventeenth re
serve division of the Prussians suf
fered severely from the bombardment.
The barrage which the British artil
lery dropped before the infantry for
the advance was perfect throughout.
The German guns pounded away sul
lenly but their fire was not effective
and the British troops suffered little
as they pushed forward.
. In the Langemarcke region the main
difficulty encountered was the mud in
the approaches to the town and into
this bog the infantry plunged deep at
every step. Not infrequently the sol
diers had to extricate a comrade who
had sunk to the waist in the morass,
but they continued to rush forward
steadily, facing machine-gun fire
from hidden redoubts and battling
their way past with rifle fire and
bombs.
Thus the British came to Lange
marcke. There were concrete gun
pits about the position in front of the
town which was flooded from the
Steenbeke river, but the infantry di-
vided and bombed its way about on
cither side of the side. As they passed
to the further- aid the Germans could
be seen running away and little resist
ance, was offered in the -town itself.
The fighting still continues beyond
Langemarcke according to the latest
reports. ,
The French attack began at 4:45
simultaneously with the British ad
vance and the contact between the al
lied armies was excellent throughout.
The French completed the vtask map
ped out for them in about one hour.
The extreme depth which they pene
trated into the German territory was
1,000 yards. j
The terrain over which the French
advanced was most difficult for on
their right the Steenbeke river was

FORT WORTH. Tex., Aug. 16.
Several persons are reported killed
and a large number injured in a col
lision ' between a passenger and a
freight train on the Missouri, Kansas
Sc. Texas railway, at Watauga, 12
miles north of Fort Worth tonight.
Ambulances from Fort Worth are be
ing hurried to the scene.
Reports reaching the dispatcher's
office here said the north-bound "Katy
Flyer" and a south-bound freight train
collided head-on, some of the cars be
ing telescoped.
One engineer and five passengers
are reported missing and a fireman is
seriously injured.
Details as to injuries to passengers
have not been received but a request
came for more ambulances.
Enginemen Killed
FORT WORTH, Tex, Aug. 16. En
gineer Jerry Scott and Fireman W. A.
Hammock, both of Denison, were killed
and four persons injured tonight when
a Missouri, Kansas & Texas limited
collided with a freight train near Wa
tauga, nine miles north of here. None
of the injured were seriously hurt.
The freight was backing in on a
siding when . the accident occurred.
The freight crew say they sent a flag
man ahead to stop the passenger, but
the crew of the limited say the flag
man evidently did not get away from
the train' before the contact. Several
freight cars were derailed.
flooded and on their left they were
moving toward an inundated area and
the ground was becoming marshier all
the time. The German defenses in
this inhospitable zone consisted chief
ly of fortified machine gun positions.
These, rowever, were accounted for
largely in the preliminary bombard
ment. The French met witt little re
sistance and the operation was carried
out with few casualties.
The portion of the Steenbeke that
the French crossed lies between a
point weset of Wijendrift and a bend
in the river 1.50O yards north, a little
southwest of St, Janshoek. On tho
east side of the river they met strong
resistance at Champaubert Farm ans,
at the Briehne House, 'both strongly
fortified and machine gun nests. The
French artillery was brought Into play
and theqe strongholds were forced to
surrender.
Dreigrachten was occupied with lit
tle or no resistance as was virtually
all the country south of the place. The
French front now runs from Dreigrach
ten alon gthe left bonk o' the St. Jans
beek river to a point of crossing be
low St. Janshoek, whence it runs
southeast to a junction with the new
British line.
The Germans had concentrated
large bodies of troops in the Houthuls
forest in anticipation of this attack but
the French heavy guns bombarded the
woods so effectively that it was impos
sible to bring up reserves.
The German losses in the prelimi
nary bombardment were severe and
thhe French alread yhad accounted for
300 prisoners when the correspondent
of the Associated Press visited their
front at noon. The booty obtained by
the French will be considerable, in
cluding a number of heavy guns which
stuck in the mud and were abandoned
by the retreating Germans. Many ma
chine guns also fell into the hands of
the French.
Sugar Speculation
Stopped by Hoover
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK. August 16. Specula
tion in sugar, which had been advanc
ing in price for months, was banned
on the New York Coffee and Sugar
Exchange today, at the instance of
.Herbert C. Hoover, .food administra
tor. He requested the exchange to
suspend all dealings in futures based
on his belief that the normal function
of such trading to stabilize prices is
lost under present conditions and op
erated to inflate prices.
Conditions were such, he paid, as to
stimulate speculation. He also asked
the exchange to limit itself to cash
transactions and to dealings solely be
tween actual producers and buyers of
sugar for their own requirements.

(By Review leased Wire.)
SEATTLE. Aug. 16. Although Gov
ernor Lister's proclamation calling for
a settlement of the lumber strike Is
sued last night at Olympia had not
reached the lumber operators officially
late today, the operators' inl'jrmal
statement declared tfiat the proposal
of the governor for, an eight-hour day
did not impress them as feasible.

West Cbast Lumbermen's association,
said that the lumbermen tf the Pacific

eight-hour day in this section and allow
the ten-hour day to remain in effect
elsewhere. !

SENTIMENT OF ALLIES
AGAINSTJPEACE PLAN
(Continued From Page One)
ago. Attention is directed to the fact
that any such changes'as may have oc
curred in the military situation have
made it distinctly to the advantage of
the central powers to endeavor to
make peace now.
Germany Would Gain.
Notwithstanding the different and
conflicting statements made by Ger
man and Austrian ministers as to a
basis of peace negotiations, it is de
clared by some of the diplomats who
have closely studied the situation that
nowhere has there been any real evi
dence of an abandonment of the firt
German demand for a peace based "on
the map" which would insure the cen
tral powers actual military,' if not
techincal and political control, of the
territories in possession of the Ger
manic troops when peace is declared.
The Germans in possession of most
of Belgium and a large part of
France, were quite willing a year ago
to make peace. But with the Russians
in possession of 'some of their best
eastern provinces, the Austrian itov
ernment was not of a like mind. Now
it is pointed by the entente diplomats,
as a result of the collapse of the Rus
sian offensive and the clearing of
Galicia of Russitn troops the Aus
trian government is also willing and
enxious for peace, as are the Ger
mans In the knowledge that the ''do
has turned against them in the west
and that another year probably will
find them in possession of little or no
French and Belgium territory.
U. S. Will Stand Pat.
. In addition to consulting with Pres
ident Wilson, Secretary Lansing will
begin to ascertain the views of en
tente governments regarding the
pope's message. Although no party to
a formal alliance, the United State?,
having joined fortunes with the en
tente allies in the supreme struggle
for democratic ideals, the necessity
and propriety of consulting with them
as to any measures looking to peace
is obvious.
It Is probable that before the formal
replies are made, statesmen in the
various entente countries will in a
way test out public sentiment by in
dividual statements. It is believed in
Washington that this was one of the
purposes of Lloyd-George's speecli in
parliament.

The stock of wheat in Great Britain

well, but economy still is necessary.
German claims as to British ship
losses, the premier said, were exag
gerated in the hvpe of cheering 'up
the i-ople of the central powers. Al
though the submarine losses in April
had "been 560,000 tons, they had de
creased until the average for July and
August would be 175,000 tons net each.
Shipbuilding had been speeded up, ves
sels had been purchasd abroad and the
total tonnage acquired in 1917 would
reach nearly 2,000,000 tons. The pre
mier said he believed the losses would
grow smaller and that the admiralty
had met with success in Combatting

NEW YORK, August 16. For no ap

the many domestic problems arising
from the war, today's stock market
developed heavy tendencies, depreci
ation of quoted values being aided by
pressure from professional traders.
Heaviness extended to rails, the
most noticeable being the weakness

Shippings and coppers were among
the few exceptions, the former again

' CHICAGO, August 16. Announce
ment that a beginning has been made
In the marketing of 1917 growth of
corn gave fresh impetus today to the
downward swing of corn values. The
close was heavy IVi to s.ne'. lower at
113 to 113V. for December and 110
to 111 for May. Wheat finished steady
at 200 for September the same as 24
hours before; oats were off 16'1
to 24 and provisions unchanged to 10
, En'arged selling was in evidence
from the outset in corn. It was not,
however until word came of arrival
of new com at Fort Worth, Texas,
that the market underwent a decided
setback. Seme experts viured to ex
press judgments that barring unsea
sonably early frost the 1917 crop as a
whole was already made. It was said
in addition that timely rains had help
ed pastures and late forage crops to a
wonderful extent. For the first time
since Vie recent series of price de
clines set In wheat today went below
2.00 a bushel for September delivery.
The trade in that option continued ap
parently to be of an evening up sort,
although some of the selling was sub
scribed to entente government. Big
threshing returns from all directions
forced a weight on the oat market. ''

NEW YORK, August 16.-Declines
were recorded today In nearly all the
active stocks, liquidation at times
assuming large proportion but more
severe, decline was checked by an ap
parent desire of short3 to realize prof
its. There was nothing impressive in
the buying power of today and the de
mand for stocks mentioned above was
about the only sustaining absorptive
power in evidence. The belief is gain
ing ground that earning power of the
many different enterprises will in the
near future compare unfavorably with
that of recent past and it ,1s thought
In many quarters that security values
will as a natuarl sequence be altered
in commensurate way. On the other
band there is no doubt but that many
of the industrials have at the present
time large established equities and
their financial status consequently is
of considerable strength but it is
questionable if in the face of sharply
curtailed earning power, that a sub
stantial bull market will be witnessed.
Of course much will depend on the
government attitude toward the price
fixing methods to be employed, but
pending the disclosure of same and
the manner in which the Pope's peace
proposals will be considered holders
of industrial shares, especially are
likely to exhibit continued nervous
ness. LOGAN & BRYAN.

LIVED ON MILK AND
BREAD FOUR YEARS
Mrs. Barrett Spent Over
$1,000 Trying to Get Relief
From Chronic Dyspepsia.
"I fold my husband that my Tan
lac was out and that I just had to go
to Birmingham to get another bottle,
as I wouldnt be without it 1'jt any
amount of money, and that is why I
am here today," said Mrs. H. B. Bar
rett when she called at Jacob's Store
In Birmingham recently to get her
second bottle. Mrs. Barrett resides at
Republic. Ala., a suburb of Birming
ham, and is well known.
"I have taken only 'one bottle of
Tanlac and have gained nine pounds.
Yes, sir, this Tanlac has done me more
good than all the medicine I have ever
taken. During the past 14 years I
have spent more than $1000 trying to
get well of a complaint that Was grad
ually sapping my strength.
"For the past four years I have lived
almost entirely on milk and bread and
finally that got &t it went against me.
I dared not eat meat or vegetables of
any kind, and if I did I would suffer
for hours afterwards.
"I had chronic dyspepsia, so I was
told, and nothing prescribed for me
brought any relief. I rarely ever went
to the table because even the sight of
food or to smell it cooking would nau
seate me. I had a bad taste in my
mouth and nothing I ate tasted right.
I bad always been healthy and a wo
man who looked after her household
duties, but since having this trouble I
got so weak I could not do my house
work and had to have help.
"I would have awful pains in my
back and was nervous and could not
sleep well. When I heard of this Tan
lac it sounded so good I thought I
would try it, because I was ready to
try anything that I thought would help
me. I was never so surprised in' my
life; it helped me right fi'om the start.
The medicine seemed to take hold
right at once and I could just feel my
self getting better from day to day.
Before I had finished my first bottle I
got so I could eat anything put on the
table and could hardly wait for meal
time tV come. I certainly bless the day
I got this medicine, for I believe it has
added years to my life. Oh- I feel
so much better and sleep so much bet
ter and am not nervous like I was.
Just think, I have actually gained nine
pounds and feel strong in every way.
"My neighbors were as much sur
prised as I was and they are at my
house every day, telling me how well
I "look. I counted up yesterday and
14 of thera are either taking Tanlac
or will commence taking it as soon
as they can go to Birmingham and get
it Tanlac is certainly a wonderful
medicine and everybody out our- way
is talking about it. You can put this
in the papers if you want to because I
know there are thousands of women
in the same bad fix that I had been for
so many years.

BOARDS WILL NOT BE
ALLOWED TO RESIGN
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, August 16 Machin
ery for selection of the draft armies
finally was completed today with the
appointment of district appeal boards
for three Pennsylvania districts wher
designations had been delayed by the
war department's desire to investigate
local differences of opinion and to se
cure boards acceptable to the com
munities concerned.
Boards for all the other districts of
the country had been appointed some
time aso and in a large percentage of
cases their work of passing on indus
trial exemptions and on appeals is
well advanced.
Provost-Marshal General Crowder
announced today that resignations of
local and appeal board members can
not be tolerated except In very urgent
cases. Telegraphing all the state
governors, the general , emphasized
that board members "have been draft
ed Into the service upon which they
are engaged" by the president and
thct mobilization of the war armies
cannot be handicapped "by refusals
based on reasons of individual bene
fit." "The president will decline to ac
cept resignations." said the telegram,
"except where they are accompanied
by a specific statement of fact and the
recommendation of the governor."

"This War will come to ap end when tie Allied Pow
ers have reached the aims which they set out to attain
when they accepted the challenge thrown down by Ger
many." Lloyd George at Glasgow, June 29, 1917..
Yellow and red and blue, these are the Arizona col
ors. The yellow bloom of the mesquite, the turquoise
blue of the sky and the flaming red splendor of the sun
set Ah, what an inspiration this trinity of colors on
the Master's palette bring at that interval just before
twilight comes to wind up the affairs of the day.
The townsite of Warren is beautifully situated upon
a plateau that must have been designed by nature in
her most beneficent mood when she widened the valley
at this spot and set her sentinels, the mountains, in a
ring around it. There arc many handsome and attractive
houses in Warren and more are being built every day.
There Is a delightful little park In Warren and another
one, will be added as soon as its war garden products
are harvested by patriotic .hands. BUT, the streets of
Warren are worse than the trackless wastes the Germans
left behind when they retreated on the Somme. Over
half of them are not navigable to any craft of the land
or high seas except a mountain goat . And the editor,
one day, saw a goat baffled by the gullies, rocks and
ditches that mar one of these alleged streets. Why? we
ask. And again, why?
"Hoover alms at high priced dairy products and
sugar," reads a headline in a New York paper. Praise be
to the saints on high for this word! The Review hopes
he hits 'em. Hits 'em hard and in the centre. There is a
creamery association that has its headquarters at Elgin,
Illinois, that has been hoisting the price of butter a cent
or so a pound every week since we can remember. It
acknowledges no law nor recognizes no condition under
the dome of heaven for its acts. It simply says, "here
is where every gent in America that spreads butter on his
morning toast pays more for said butter" and he does,
for every butter maker in the land follows the lead of
the Elgin bell wether. Butter has climbed like the dial
of fate from twenty-five to somewhere around sixty cents
a pound in the last few years, and it was this Elgin con
cern that announced every increased centime of the cost,
just like John D. does on the soaring price of gasoline.
As for the sugar trust, let Hoover do his worst. It has
been cursed by many men in many tongues as long at,
we can remember. Whereas, sugar was five and six cents
a pound, it is now ten. Why? Oh, on account of the
war; they're using sugar in shells., Here's hoping Hoover
aims straight and has lots of powder behind the lead.
The British soldier may be no braver than the Ger
man soldier, man for man in battle, but the British na
tion is braver than the German nation. She has the cour
age to proclaim and admit her big blunders and awful
mistakes in the conduct of the war. She calls a "defeat"
a "defeat." and not a "victory," or a "retirement." Her
publication of the blunders of Gallipoli and Mesopotamia
required the highest degree of moral courage. But the
government reasoned truly that its people were big
enough and brave enough to be given the true facts of
the case. The Prussian government has never dared, up
to this time, to admit a single defeat or mistake or
blunder before its people. They have the physical but
not the moral courage to meet all the obligations of a
great war. To the German mind the invasion of Belgium
is still a fine stroke for the Fatherland, the shambles
before Verdun is still a "victory," and the ruthless sub
marine warfare still a necessity. This, in the face of th'i
fart that the Belgium atrocity brought England into the
war with her fleet that has swept every German keel from
the surface of the seas. This, when the folly of Verdun
cost the Kaiser half a million of his best men without
tie permanent gain of a foot of French soil. This, when
the submarine terror brought America into the war with
her untold wealth and resources of men and munitions,
and yet has failed of its object entirely. Only after
the present German rulers have been hurled from their
places of power will the truth ever be brought home to
German people of the mistakes these rulers have made.
And what a mild descriptive adjective is the word "mis
take!" No word yet coined into human tongue can fit
this case.
SUCCESSFUL VOLUNTEERING
The regular army is now filled up. And it has been
done by volunteers. The past week brought in the last
of the 186,000 men needed to swell the army to the
strength authorized by congress four months ago. The
completion of this enrollment marks the close of a cam
paign for volunteers that has proved far more success
ful than most of us expected more successful, in fact.
than any previous effort of the kind in American history.
The draft has occupied nearly all the public attention
lately. But the draft, it should be remembered, has been
applied only to the raising of the new "national army."
All the other branches of our service, military and naval.
have been filled by volunteers.
While this regular army recruiting was in progress,
about 180.000 men joined the national guard. Inasmuch
as the guard was promptly mustered into federal service,
that means that since April 1 we have added more than
360,000 men directly to our land forces by the volunteer
system. And they are but a small proportion of the volun
teers. We begin to glimpse the real extent of this great
popular movement when we consider that more than 1.
100,000 men offered themselves as candidates for the reg
ular army and the national guard.
And that isn't all. In the same period the navy
gained' 75,000 men, taken from a total of 225,000 volun
teers. More than 150,000 men, of an exceptionally high
quality, applied for admittance to the officers' training
camps. About 45,000 offered themselves for the marine
corps, 150,000 for the naval reserve, 75,000 for the army
reserve and 25,000 for the naval militia. Altogether, it
is estimated, 1,750,000 civilians came forward and indi
cated their willingness to fight for Uncel Sam.
Many of them, very likely, were influenced somewhat
by the knowledge that if they failed to volunteer they
might be drafted. But even so, the volunteering has been
highly creditable to the country. No better proof could
be asked for that this is truly a people's war, and the
nation is ready to make any sacrifice necessary for the
preservation of its free institutions and high ideals.
THE HARVESTS AGAINST GERMANY
The government crop report might have been better
as to wheat. It could haidly have been much better in
other important respects.
Record-breaking crops are virtually assured for white
and sweet potatoes, oats, barley, rye and hay, while corn,
the mast important single crop in the list, promised a
yield of 3,191.000,000 bushels on August 1, or 67,000,000
bushels above the record harvest of 1912. Since then
needed rains have fallen over the com belt, and Chicago
grain experts say the present promise runs 380.000,000
bushels more than that There remain to be added to
the outlook generally excellent fruit crops and the multi
tudinous additions to the ordinary food supply from in
creased plantings all over the country to vegetables and
all manner of edible stuffs. '
Systematized conservation and eecnomy for the na
tion in respect to wheat should do wonders in creating
a large exportable surplus even from a short crop. Abund
ance in other yields under the same protection against
waste and speculative extortion will do the rest. The
allied world against Germany is assured of all neces
sary living requirements for a year to. come.

Every line of business in Bisbee is showing a steady

ations promise to break all records.
The Review wishes to congratulate Charles F. Wil
lis, director of the Safety Bulletin of the University of
Arizona. It is full of practical, helpful things, compiled
and written in a most interesting way. Its articles are
short and to the point They are simple and plain and
strike with the force necessary if they are to do good.
A lot of Safety First drivel and foolishness is being print
ed nowadays. Like every good and useful movement, it
is being overdone by over zealous advocates. But Mr.
Willis hits hard and true where it will do the most good.
In the June issue of his magazine, La Follette, the
pacifist senator from Wisconsin, and the greatest
"grandstander" ever produced by any nation since Bel
shazzer gave his feast, charges that the United States
is the aggressor in the war with Germany and that the
Prussian had given cs no cause whatever for war. And
this, after America had endured insult, broken promises
and brutal murder of her people for three years. As thd
Los Angeles Times well says: "LaFollette's present at
titude towards the national government and the conduct
of the war should secure his prompt expulsion from tin;
senate of the United States and his punishment for trea
son in 'giving aid and comfort to the enemies of the
United States.'"
Probably no better illustration of the present dis
tress of the Prussian can be brought forward than his
action in the case of the Russian revolution as compaied
with his action in the matter of the revolution In Franco,
a little more than a century ago. When the French killed
their king and queen and set up a Republic, the Prussiar
armies were the first to march against these revolution
ists against kingly authority. But the French peasants,
Inflamed by the miracle working breath of liberty, beat
the Prussians at the world famous battle of Valmy. When
the Russians deposed their czar and set up a Republic,
the proud Prussian sought peace with these revolution
ists, hoping to destroy them by treachery rather than bj
arms. How are the mighty fallen!
A tax rate of 53 cents on each
$100 of assessed valuation was fixed
by the state tax commission at the
concision of its work as a state board
of equalizatioij. This rate is an in
crease of 33 per cent over the rate
tor 1916. but was smaller than the es
timated rate oi the commission.
The total valuation of all properties
in the state as fixed by the state board
of equalization is $697,526,619.68 a net
increase of $11,290,038 over the figures
originally compiled by counties. The
increase over 1916 totals more than
$300,000,000. A majority of this in
crease assessment is on mining prop
erties, both producing and non-producing.
The biggest item on the tax levy is
for schools. The school levy for the
present year totals $.10798. The sec
and largest is the general fund levy,
which totals $.10701, and the third
largest the road levy, which totals $.10
fiat, for each $100 of assessed valua
tion. The remainder of the 53 V4 rate
is divided among the customary Issues
as well as two special appropriations
by the last legislature."

GET THE SLACKERS,
ORDERS GOVERNMENT
PHOENIX, Aug. 16. Renewed in
structions have been received by Unit
ed States Attorney Flyna, urging him
to make every possible ' effort to ap
prehend every slacker and to give this
matter preferenece over anything else
that may come up in that Office.
Mr. Flynn in turn urges the assis
tance of every citizen in locating the
slackers and asks that all who have
any just cause to believe that some
one has evaded the registration act
of June 5 to report the same to his
office immediately for further inves
tigation.
The attorney's Office has received
many inquiries as to whether the sher
iff or a peace officer can arrest a man
on the suspicion of being a slacker
without having a formal warrant for
the man's arrest Mr. Flynn says that
such an officer not only has the auth
ority to make such an arrest but that
he should arrest the suspected man
and hold him without any ceremony
whatever.
The United States attorney's office
has notified every sheriff in the state
to arrest every man whom he has any
cause for believing to be a slacker, and
If he cannot product a registration
card to take him before a registration
officer at once, register him whether
be wants to be registered Or not and
then hold him in jail while he notifies
the attorney's office.
Reports of slackers are coming in to
the attorney's office daily and it is his
desire to get every slacker just as soon
as possible. Unless they are appre
hended immediately they will receive
no advantage, even if they are punish
ed later, by reason of the fact tuat un
less he is given a registration num
ber now that the probabilities are that
he will not be called on the present
draft
Every slacker who is registered now
will be given the number of some man
who has been properly exempted and
will be forced to take the exempted
man's place and will stand a chance of
going to the front. For this reason
it is very important to get the slack
ers now.

The six children of Jlrs. Marie Palady. '
Mrs. Marie Palady of Chicago has lost her sturdy battle against
poverty. She fought hard to keep herself and her six children well fed and
clothed, but finally was obliged to admit defeat. She advertised for homes
for her children, and herself selected the six families with whom her
children will henceforth make their homes.

Tliere is a time to work and a time
to rest a time to earn and a time to save.
Now is a good time to start a reserve

account here.
THERE IS NO LAW
Compelling a man to save, and we doubt if any law
could make the thriftless provident.
In this matter of saving you must either take
the advice of those who know or learn by your own
experience that it does not pay to livfc right up to
your income, spending every cent you earn, regard
less of that future which may not be such a time ol
prosperity ior you as the present is.
This bank helps you with four per cent interest
compounded semi-annually on your savings de

pense is trifling.
. Simply get an ounce of othine

and a few applications should show
you how easy it is to rid yourself of
Itho tinmplv frprkles and trot a beauti-

one ounce needed for- the worst case.
Be sure to ask the druggist for the

GLAD THEY'RE GONE
One of the most unusual cases which
Judge Pollock has yet been called on
to consider came up when a Cornish
man and a negro woman came before
him. The pair had come to El Paso
together; from Bisbee, Ari& three
weeks agt.

there is nothing the matter with your
bead? Are you in your right mind,"
the court asked the Cornishman.
"Yes." said the 'Cousin Jack' with a
smile, "I know I'm In my right mind.
I took a liking to the woman and I'm
going to marry her. In my country It
isn't uncommon for the whites to
marry the blacks.
"What is your business? the court
demanded.
"I'm a miner, said the Englishman.
"Are you a member of the I. W. W.r
asked the Judge.
"Never have been, was the answer.
"Then." said the court, "you should
have been. This is about as crazy a
