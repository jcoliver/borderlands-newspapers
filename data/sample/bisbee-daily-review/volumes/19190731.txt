Prosecutor Sees Impeachment
During the morning session of the
court the county attorney charged
that the attorneys for the defense
were going too far in the questions
asked Etate's witnesses during cross
examination. The county attorney
vigorously objected to questions put
to one of bis witnesses regarding an
alleged application for membership
in the I. W. W., stating that the
questions were meant as efforts by
the defense to lay grounds for im
peachment proceedings against the
witnesses when the cases reached
the superior court. At the conclusion
of an argument between the attor
neys. Justice W. C. Jack, who is con
ducting the hearing, directed that it
any impeachment were to be made
against the state's witnesses, such
charges would have to be made be

he had joined the I. W. W. because it

the prosecution, said during cross ex

PARIS. July 30 (By the Asso

Herbert Hoover, director gen

the peace conference, which al

other American and British ob

July 23, sends the following from

the Armenians will be crushed.
"Relief work is impossible in

LEAGUE STAND
WASHINGTON, July 30. The
peace treaty with Germany was dis
cussed by President Wilson today
with four more Republican senators,
all of them understood to be unwil
ling to accept the league of nations
in its present form.
The question of reservations is un
derstood to have been the chief topic
of discussion, Mr. Wilson reiterating
his aversion to any change or quali
ification. Each of the senators indi
cated afterward his views had not
been changed.
The president saw Senators Dil
lingham of Vermont. Harding of
Ohio, Fernald iff Maine and Lenroot
of Wisconsin. He talked for an hour
with each of them, going over many
features of the Versailles negotia
tions. None would discuss his con
versation with the president in de
tail, but Senator Harding, who is a
member of the foreign relations com
mittee, made a brief statement say
ing Mr. Wilson had emphasized the'
danger' that the senators might en
courage other nations to qualify their
acceptance of the league.
Tomorrow the president will see
three other Republican senators
while the senate resumes debate on
the treaty and the foreign relations

the economic section with Bernard

FEDERAL IRE
AT MIDNIGHT
Burleson Jakes Parting Shot
- At Postal . Co. In Issuance
Of Order; Lauds Others For
1 Giving "Loyal Cooperation"
WASHINGTON, . July 30. Govern
ment control of telegraph and tele
phone properties will end at midnight
tomorrow nighL Orders for their re
turn to private ownership were issued
today by Postmaster General Burle
son as required in a resolution adopt
ed by congress and signed by Presi
dent Wilson ten days ago.
Mr. Burleson in a statement accom
panying his order, said sound public
opinion ultimately would determine
"how this trust has been met," and
that he was content to abide by the
results. Besides this reply to criti
cisms of his management of the wire
companies, the postmaster general
also took a parting shot at the Postal
Telegraph company, most of the offi
cers of which were relieved several
months ago because of what he term
ed interference with government man
agement. The postmaster general did not
mention the company by name, but
said that "with one notable exception
the reason for which is thoroughly
understood by those who have kept
informed," every wire company had
given him loyal co-operation."
Under the resolution of congress di
recting the return of the companies
properties, government-fixed intra
state telephone rates are to remain in
force for a period of four months, un
less sooner changed by states commit
tees, but no provision was made as to
telegraph rates.
Clarence H. Mackay, president of
the Postal company, in urging con
gress to provide for speedy return of
the properties, said his company
could reduce rates 20 per cent and
still earn a profit.
Control of the wire companies was
taken over by the postmaster general
as a war measure on July 22, 1918, un
der a resolution of .congress. Admin
istration of the affairs of the compa
nies by the postmaster general led to
sharp criticism in recent months and
this found expression in congress
when the resolution for their return
to private management was consid
ered. In his statement today, the post
master general said his labors were
"brought to an end with a conscious
ness on his part of having at all times
administered he wire system with
Justice and fairness to the employes,
and the owners of these properties!
and in such way as to render the
best service possible to the general
public under normal conditions."

streets tonight were patrolled by sol
diers called out by Governor Lowden
at the request of Mayor Thompson
for the protection of life and prop
erty, threatened by the race war
which for four days has seized the
city.
The state established a barred zone
about three miles square embracing
mostly a colored residential district
on the southern side.
In this zone they searched every
person whom they met for weapons.
No one could pass in or out without
military permission. The district ex
tended roughly from 22nd street to
55th street, ndrth and south, and from
Michigan Boulevard to Wentworth
Avenue, east and west.
This happened when the riots in
the colored district itself had some
what subsided, but when there was
an alarming spread of deaths outside.
Fire on Passenger Trains
New York Central railroad officials

Adjutant General Frank S. Dick

for protection. Attacks upon negro
homes increased throughout the
day and night. Negro leaders de
clared that many members of their
race faced starvation, because driv
ers of supply wagons feared to enter
some portions of the black belt.
Whites Fire From Autos
Among the reports received by the
police of trouble on the south side
was a statement that a number of

be an army truck were firing shots
along Grand boulevard. No one was

PHOENIX. Ariz., July 30. The com
petency of Col. T. Q. Donaldson of the
inspector general's department farms,
to testify as to conditions at Farm No.
2. at Chelles, France, where many
American prisoners were detained,
was questioned in a detailed statement
issued by Colonel Edgar P. Grinstead,
here tonight.
Colonel Donaldson yesterday was a
witness at the hearing of the con
gressional committee . inquiring into
the treatment of American prisoners
in France .and said that as a result
of matters coming' to his attention in
the course of an inquiry abroad he had
recommended the court martial of Col
onel Grinstead.
Colonel Grinstead labelled as "ab
surd" intimations that he had made a
scape goat of Lieutenant Frank H.
Smith, or had been a party to such
action;
"I don't believe and never did be
lieve that Heuf-fant Snil'h did any
thing but his duty at Farm No. 2," he
said. Colonel Grinstead denied em
phatically the intimation made yes
terday by Representative Bland, a
member of the investigating commit
tee that "hundred of boys were beaten
up" while the officer In charge "was
giveu an hoajrall-j discharge."
The colonel also entered a protest
against the public's willingness to be
lieev that the rae.i at tbe prison farm
over which he had jurisdiction and of
which Lieutenant Smith was the im
mediate commander, were treated
brutally.

discussing the class of men at the

to the disturbed area and when the
orders came to move these troops

militant loiterers without ceremony.
The police filled in the intervals ol
the military cordon and searched ev

A flying squadron of thirty motor
cycle policemen was sent through the
district with orders to report what
they saw to police headquarters. -
The verbal request for troops wag
supplemented by a formal request
from the mayor in writing to the ad
jutant general. It read:
Mayor Requests Troops

A disturbing feature tonight was
a number of automobile trucks filled

The decision to use troops to patrol

government are in despair. General
mobilization was ordered yesterday,
taking the men from the harvest.
"We shall not be able to carry on
relief work much longer unless the
British receive orders to clear all
Russian' Armenia of Turkish and Tar
tar forces."
A message received by the Ameri
can relief administration in Paris
from Major Green July 21 said that
the Georgian government had placed
an embargo on Armenian relief sup
plies and was showing little dispo
sition to lift it.
Likewise the Azerbaijan represen
tative was hostile to Armenian relief
measures, according to Major Green,
and was joining with the Georgians
in an effort to starve out the Ar
menians and compel them to amal
gamate with the Georgians and Azer
baijans in a movement against the
Russian volunteer forces in Transcaucasia.

SURPRISING FIGURES REVEALED
iriCREAE
iEO GISTS
OF COPPER; MATERIAL PRICES SOAR
Nearly Every Product Needed in Mining and Smelting of
Red Metal From 25 to 500 Pet. Higher Than in 1914; Oil,
Coal, Powder, Fuse, Dynamite, Timber, Steel, Labor and
Mill Prices Aviate, But Warren Mines Still "Carry On"
W survey yesterday of the prices for
essentials being paid by the mining
companies of the Warren district re
vealed some surprising figures on the
extent to which basic costs have risen
ia the last few years and cast an il
luminating sidelights on the increased
cost of copper production. While in a
few instances the cessation of hos
tilities has brought about slight re
ductions in the price of materials, a
comparison with before-the-war costs
shows that nearly every product need
ed in mining and smelting the red
metal is from 25 per cent to 500 per
cent higher than In 1914.
Little hope of any early or marked
' reduction in these prices was held out
by the men whos-e business it is to
watch the world's markets. Indeed,
the Impression prevailed, that prices
are "firm" extremely firm and
show every - indication of becoming
firmer. Cement is about the only ray
of sunshine amidst the gloom, having
for some reason made but a slight ad
vance in the last five years.
Fuel Oil One of Chief Costs.
In both Bisbee and Douglas one of
the chief items of cost in the produc
tion of copper is fuel oil. The local
companies use the oil produced in the
California fields and approximately
nine carloads a day are being deliver
ed here and in the smelter city. Fuel
oil shows an increase of 90 per cent
over the prices prevailing five years
ago. This is fbr oil delivered to the
consumer.
While oil has largely displaced coal,
a considerable amount of this old, re
liable fuel Is still being used and
shows an increase of between 100 per
cent and 300 per cent according to
quality. The coal used in this dis
trict comes largely from the New
Mexico fields. Coke, of which a large
quantity is used in. the smelters at
Douglas, has-gone up about 75 per
cent.
Prices of Explosives Soar.
The price of powder and dynamite
has been affected perhaps more than
any other commodity by the war. At
one time during the conflict the price
of dynamite soared to 130 per cent
more than its peace time stalus. Since
the essation of hostilities dynamite
prices have been going down some
what until it cosfs ' only 86 per cent
' more than 1914. Fust shows an ad
vance of 93 per cent, and caps 82 per
cent. One of the large companies in
this district had until recently been
using 125.000 pounds of dynamite
month, so in the aggregate the 86 per
cent increase represents at the end of
a year a considerable fortune.
Timber Important Cost.
Timber for timbering the mines is
another tremendously important item
of expense, five to six million feet a
month being necessary to supply the
local demand. This timber comes
largely from Oregon and Washington
and is landed at Los Angeles by the
ocean route. Just at present timbers
cost 100 per cent more than they did
in 1914 and -there is every indication
of another advance. -
Steel Up 200 Per Cent.
Steel also plays an important part
in the Increased cost of copper pro
duction. The base for steel bars at
Pittsburg in 1914 was $1.15. Today it
is $3.25' an approximate advance of
200 per cent. A proportional increase
is shown in the prices for angles and
plates, channels, beams and structur
al steel.
As a consequence of the heavy ad
vances in steel and iron all sorts of
maenmery ana tools snow corre-

spondingly higher prices. Mining
tools are from 100 to 200 per cent
more than in 1914. All electrical ma
chinery seems to hold the lead in
rapidly rising costs, having gone up
between 300 and 500 per cent in the
past five years.
Freight Increase Factor.
Not to be overlooked in the gen
erally higher costs is the 25 per cent
increase in freight rates and the 3
per cent war tax on freight.
The building industry also shares
in the general balloon ascension that
prices have been taking. A conserva
tive estimate places the increased
cost of building over pre-war, normal
conditions at 75 per cent; In the last
60 days merchantable timber on the
coast for building purposes lias ad
vanced 25 per cent. This ia in addi
tion to sharp increases that have oc
curred at intervals ever since 1914.
Mill Product Prices Up.
A survey of the prices for mill pro
ducts shows that during the month
of June alone there was an advance
of 14 per cent. A further sharp in
crease has been made within the last
few days.
In Los Angeles mill work seneral
ly shows nn increase of 30 per cent in
the last two years. As for plumbing
supplies, prices have been on a wild
spfee, with the dealer' generally get
ting all the consumer can staud. Cast
iron enamel ware for plumbing has
gone up 15 per cent in the last 30
days. . .
But Bisbee Still ''Carries On." '
Scarcity of labor and advanced wag-
es is another element that has added!
to the sky-rocketing cost of building.
One architect estimated yesterday
that a well-built bungalow which in
1914 would have cost $2000, will cost
today at least $3500.
But with it all, Bisbee and the War
rent district are' still "carrying on."

FOREST FIRES
" SPOKANE,-Wash., July 30 Strong
winds in the Blackfoot and Selway
National forests today increased the
danger from forest fires, causing
flames to spread over thousands of
acres of valuable timber, according
to reports to forest service headquar
ters. The Coeur D'Alene fires in Idaho
are reported increasing in area, but
are not quite as threatening to towns
in the Coeur D'Alen valley as a few
days ago.
Rain in the eastern section of the
Missoula, Mont., forest had improved
the situation last night. The Gold
Creek fire in the Lolo forest is run
ning towards Cedar Creek, fifteen
miles southeast of St. Regis, Mon
tana, and the town is considered in
little danger.
The Henderson fire was held on a
26-mile front but it is still destroying
valuable timber. The Anaconda Cop
per Mining company and the Western
Lumber company are combatting for
ets fires that are spreading rapidly
near Nine-mile and Soudan, Mantana.

SCHOOL CENSUS
A TOTAL
OF 3114 PUPILS
Enrollment, Denoting the Usual
Summer Shrinkage, Indicates
A Population of Over 25,000
People in Warren District
The Bisbee and Warren district
schools now have an enrollment of
3004, according to the figures for the
month given out yesterday by Super
intendent C. P. Philbrook. This is a
reduction from the high mark of 4800
last winter and is the normal summer
shrinkage. According to population
experts these figures would indicate
that there are more than 25,000 people
in the Warren district. The enroll
ment in the various schools follows:
High school, 248; Junior High
school, 346; Night school, 159; Central
school, 767; Lowell, 392; Lincoln, 261;
Greenway, 231; Warren, 76; Don Luis,
61; Powell, 131 Fremont, 50; Jeffer
son, 62; Garfield, 62; Booker T. Wash
ington, 9; six kindergartens, 149.
The attendance of 159 at the night
school is regarded as particularly
gratifying.
Bisbee Ball Team
To Seek Revenge
On First Cavalry
Bisbee's baseball team will trek to
Douglas Sunday where it will play
the First cavalry team and endeavor
to even up things for the 8 to 3 de
feat sustained at the hands of the
soldiers two weeks ago. "Red" Ton
er will pitch for the local team and
Price will catch. ,A lage delegation
of local "fans" will accompany the
team.
It is probable that the Lowell team
will play the nine of the Nineteenth
Infantry Sunday at the Warren
grounds. It is expected the Lowell
ites will have a greatly strengthened

Statement of Villa He Has Disbanded
Army Hoax; To Attack Chihuahua City
Soon, Says E. J. Hickey, Parral Fugitive
E. J. Hickey, one of the last of the
remaining ei&ht Americans to flee
from Parral after the recent battle at
Juarez between Carrancistas and Vil
listas, which only ended, when United
States troops took a hand, was a visi
tor in Bisbee yesterday and gave a
graphic, first-hand account of condi
tions in Southern Chihuahua and the
operations of "Pancho" Villa. Mr.
Hickey, who was in charge of the
cyanading plant of the Alvarado min
ing company at Parral, an American
concern, has been visiting on the
coast since his departure with sevn
companions from Parral.
Villa Disbanding is Hoax
Villa's recent statement that he was
going to Japan to arrange for arms
and finances and would return in the
fall to rally his followers for another
and more vigorous campaign, is only
a hoax, in the opinion of Mr. Hickey.
Villa has never disbanded bis men,
but is now campaigning north and his
next point of attack will be Chihua
hua City, Mr. Hickey believes.
"The intervention of United States
troops in the recent battle at Juarez
was a bombshell in the Villa camp,"
said the visitor yesterday, "and wreck
ed the hopes and plans of General An
geles, with whom Villa had united
forces. Angeles, an able military
commander and a man of education,
culture and intelligence, had come
into Northern Mexico from Washing
ton, firm in the belief that if he and
Villa succeded in capturing an impor
tant border point they would receive
official recognition as belligerents
from the United States government.
Angeles claimed to have been given
this assurance at Washington by re
sponsible persons.
U. S. Wrested Victory From Villa
"Thenceforward Angeles and Villa
summoned all their forces for a drive
on Juarez. They were within the city
and Jiad its capture practically assur
ed when the bullets began flying
across the river Into El Paso, the
United States troops crossed and Vil
la's army was forced to flee when
victory was almost in its grasp.
"The failure, of their plans and the
action of the United States troops
proved, of course, a bitter disappoint
ment to Villa and Angeles. Up to
that time the e:ght remaining Ameri
cans -at Parral had felt themselves
entirely safe, although ten of our force
had left some weeks before. But after
the Juarez battle we were ordered to
take no chances, and to leave at once.
Of course, we expect to return as soon
as the situation has calmed down
somewhat."
Mr. Hickey was in Parral when the
city was captured by Villa the last
time on April 20 last. Angeles was

with Villa at the time and they occu
pied the city for several weeks. Dur
ing this time tliey rallied their forces
and made ready for the campaign to
capture Juarez, which they believed
would lead to their recognition and
the downfall of Carranza. A condi
tion was held, Curing wiilch a new
government was declared with An
geles as presioent and Villa as secre
tary of war.
Americans Well Treated
Perfect order was maintained in
Parral by Villa and Angeles, according
to Mr. Hickey and the Americans were
well treated. While a large sum of
money was requisitioned fnm the
business men, no looting or robbery
was permitted and women and girls
were safeguarded. Angeles raise-d a
fund for educational purposes and re
opened the schools.
Mr. Hickey set at rest reports that
Villa is sick or had been wounded.
" He was as husky a looking hombre
as I ever want to see," said Mr.
Hickey, "and was in a high good hu
mor all the time. He and his men
seemed to have plenty of money and
were well equipped with ammunition
and horses, food and clothing.
"According to tho beat estimates.
Villa's regular army consisted of
about 1200 men, but when necessary
he could summon sympathizers who
would fight for him to the number of

too poor fighters, according to the
story, to encumber his army, but he
gave them each five pesos and sent
them on tfieir way."
Parral Pitiful Example of Ruin
The country around Parral is a piti
ful example of the ruin wrought by
the strife of the past few years, Mr.
Hickey said. Naturally wonderfully

be a regular event. The four regiments stationed in the
Arizona district participated. The meet, with the possibility
of another at an early date, will prove a big stimulant to athletics in
the army. It is understood that another field meet will be held at
Douglas within two or three months and those regiments which made
a small score in the meet Saturday and Sunday may be expected to
show up much better in the next meet, as they will have more time
to prepare for it.
The meet at Fort Huachuca was a great credit to those who
planned and executed it. The best kind of sportmanship and rivalry
prevailed throughout. One of the fights, which proved verv one sided
in the first round, was promptly stopped. The soldiers all behaved
themselves admirably and the fine order which was maintained was
extremely creditable, especially as both white and colored soldiers
were participating in practically all events.
The Arizona military district has become a big unit. After a few
meets like this, it will be able to send a crack field team to contest
for honors with other districts in the southern department, which
will go a long way toward arousing a district spirit r.nd pride.

ENFORCEMENT OF PROHIBITION.
IX VOTING its draft of a prohibition law, the House of Repre
sentatives will probably please nobody altogether, although, in
truth, its measure ought to satisfy everyone except in one re
. spect. The exception is the refusal of trial by jury to persons
accused under the law. This is a denial by right which no degree of
enthusiasm excuses. It is a violation of the American spirit of justice
and fair play. We cannot believe that the senate will ever allow such
a monstrosity of oppression to disgrace the federal statute books.
But, apart from this, the law is well framed. It seems to carry
out the purposes aimed at in a reasonable way, carrying out the in
tent of the Eighteenth amendment rigidly, but inoffesively. save to
those who are bent on nullifying it. And such persons""have no rights
in pursuing that illegal course.
It cannot be baid that the good features of the law, balancing
strictness with good sense, are especially due to the wisdom or sense
of right of the dry element. Many vicious enactments have been
proposed and much destructive nonsense talked. But, on the whole,
a good average result has been reached. At least, if it becomes final,
the people will have a chance to decide on what prohibition really
means and whether they really want it in performance, without be
ing provoked or lured into putting side issues above the main question.
"A MERRY HEART DOETH GOOD."
THERE ARE many schools of medicine, and there are cults
that don't believe in medicine at all they would "throw
physic to the dogs." to quote Shakespeare in Macbeth.
But all these schools and cults would accept the "medi
cine" that the Scripture gives: "A merry heart."
Here's the full prescription: "A merry heart doeth good like a
medicine."
And the writer of the Proverbs adds: "But a broken spirit drieth
the bones."
You know the person who always has tears in his voice, and
a frown on his face, and tight-shut lips, and clouded eyes from such
comes only heaviness of spirit.
"A merry heart" it's a cure for the blues, a tonic for sadness,
a bracer for discouragement , a remedy for depression.
And t lie fine thing about it is that you don't need to take a col
lege course to jiave a merry heart, nor wait until somebody gives
you a diploma which permits you to practice you may go right to it.
"A merry heart doeth good like a medicine."
It would put most of t lie regular doctors out of business for what
most of us need is just a little cheering up.
NEW LEGISLATIVE DISTRICTS.
AT THE LAST general election, the people, under the initia
tive, passed a law providing for legislative districts. The
law is a splendid one, insuring all parts of Arizona counties,
which are for the most part very large, representation in
the lower house of the legislature. The new law provides that with
in twelve months after the amendment is declared adopted, the
boards of supervisors of each county entitled to more than one repre
sentative, shall divide I he county into as many legislative districts
as there may be representatives from the county, giving each district
a representative. Each district must contain as far as possible the
same voting population and there must be no gerrymandering, as leg
islative districts must be compact and shall include eontinguous, por
tions. The board of supervisors must give at least thirty days' notice
of their intention to district the county.
It is understood that the question or districting will coins be
fore the Pima, county supervisors at their next meeting.
It is highly probable that the districts' here will include one from
Tucson west, taking in Ajo, one taking the northern section of Tuc
son and the Rillito country and one taking the southern section and
the cattle smd miuing country to the south. Pima has only one cen
ter of population outside of Tucson, which is Ajo, and certainly the
country to the west, which takes in Ajo and Silverboll, is entitled to
a legislative district. Tucson Citizen.

MEXICAN IS KILLED BY
FREAK ELECTRIC SHOCK.
DOUGLAS, July 30. Ramon M.
Garcia, aged 35, was almost instant
ly killed while standing in front ot
the bake oven in his bakery at Agua
Prieta, opposite the Hotel Moderno.
An electrical storm accompanied by
a heavy rain was in progress at the
time and the man was killed either
by a stroke of lightning or by a cur
rent of electricity that entered his
body through the electric light wire
held in his hand. Dr. Bim Smith, who
was called immediately following the
accident, is inclined to the latter
view, a.s is alo Jorge Aato, presiden

M'ALISTER MAY ENTER
SUPREME BENCH RACE.
DOUGLAS, July 30. Judge A. G.
McAlister, of Graham county, is in
the city, coming here from Tombstone
where he presided over the superior
court Saturday. Judge McAlister has
served as superior judge of Graham
county since the territory was admit
ted as a state. He frequently conies
to this county to try cases in the ab.
sence of Judge Lockwood, to hear
cases in which Judge Ixickwood is
disqualified. He will be here for two
weeks next month.
The name of Judge McAlister has
been mentioned frequently in con
nection with the supreme judgeship
since Judge Cunningham announced
that he would not again be a candi
date. The Graham county judge said
t hat it would gratify an ambition he
has long had should he be chosen for
the supreme bench, but said that he
did riot know now as to what chances
he would have for this distinction.
INCREASE IN WAGES AT

CLIFTOX, July 30. Wages were

Dodge Corporation stating that owing I
to the improved condition of the cop
per market and the high cost of liv
ing, wages would be advanced, effec

copper. Under the new scale men
now receiving $3.03 will receive $3.63.;
men receiving $5.07 will receive $5.75;
men receiving $4.19 will receive $4.73;
men receiving $7.59 will receive $S.45,
etc. The base rate for journey men's
craft has been fixed for the future at
$4.24 on 13 cent copper.
Illgoth, a Xavajo Indian lad, who
was convicted of the slaying of his
sister. Though there were no eye
witnesses to the tragedy, the boy is
said to have made certain startling
admissions concerning the alleged
circumstances of the crime which
mark it as one of the most curious
from a psychological standpoint of
any committed in the state.
According to the boy's story as
given the prison officials, he sought
the degradation of his own sister on
three different occasions, the final at
tempt resulting in a struggle which
ended in a fall over a high cliff. The
girl was killed by the fall, but the
boy escaped with injuries.
The case in question has attracted
the attention of criminal reformers
and will be used as an argument to i
Kpenre a change in the nresent laws!
and, if possible, to establish a state

MINORITY RULE
New York Times:
Some seventy-odd
one-sixth of the membership of the
house of representatives, are passing
amendments to the prohibition en
forcement bill touching u'pon such
importa.it matters as t he search of
homes and seizure of private proper
ty without pretext and without re
dress. Sixty or seventy other rep
resentatives care enough about the
questions at issue to vote against
them. Two-thirds, of the members
of the lower house are absent. As
a demonstration of rule of the major
ity this is quite in keeping w ith prohi
bition tactics.
en roof of the brick building which
houses tlie huge coal bins was already
ablaze, and the great piles of coai,
containing hundreds of tons, were a
mass of smoke and fire. The flames
made no headway after the firemen
arrived, thoueh it took until 7 o'cloc k
congressmen, j Jo xt ineui sli them. When the fire
men reached the scene the laundry
building, west of the bins, wa? threat
ened, but the blaze was confined lo
the coal sheds.
This Is the third fire the company
has hail in the past year, all originat
ing from spontaneous combustion,
though the other two were not seri
ous. During the past several weeks
the company has been receiving cot.l
for the coming winter trade and it.
has been shipped in open tars. Much
of it was rained on white in transit
and was put into the bins while wet,
which is said to have been tin? cause
of the spontaneous combustion.
LLOYD GEORGE AS A PARTY
Boston Transcript:
The effect of coalition in Great
Britaia has been to awaken the or
dinary functions of the existing po
litical parties and to loosen all party
ties. In such a case, in any country,
what happens? Personal influence is
magnified, and personal strength
counts as against party strength. In
Great Britain we find the proof of
this in the practical disappearance
of every name, in connection with
the government, except that of Lloyd
George; and it is not surprising to
hear that steps are being taken
among the English politicians to or
ganize a new party -in which Mr.
George will be practically "the whole
thing.".
SRIZOI RIFLE
TEAM HELD UP
Expect Huge Yield
Of Cochise Crops
J. P. Sexton, captain, and the other
lfi members of the Arizona rifle team,
did not leave El Taso yesterday for
Caldwell. N. J., as their schedule?
called for. Mr. Sexton ami Harry
Wheeler were to leave last night for
FA Paso, joining the other marksmen
there. The delay in the departure of
the Arizona members is due to a tele
gram received from the executive
officer of the big government rifle
range at Caldwell saying that owing
to unprecedented rains at Caldwell it
would be necessary to postpone the
matches until further notice.
Mr Sexton received the telegram
(and Colonel Ruskruge of Tucson. Gov-
Sinee the recent rains the crops pinor Campbell and others also n
over Vochise county are showing up ceived the same messaue.
It is be
lieved the Arizona men were reached

a member of Ihe Douglas team. He
.r.Mnir east ahead of the other
in fine shape. In the dry farming re
gions of the county, the farmers were
almost without exception, prepared
for the rains, in that practically all
seeds were sown. The soil bed had
been put in excellent condition and
we now see the results, of good prep
aration. The southern and central parts of
the county have been favored with
rains to a greater extent than the
northern part. This is readily seen
ia the condition of the growing crops.
If the amount of rainfall is normal or
above for the remainder of the usual
rniney season, there will be an unpre
cedenled yield of farm crops over the
entire? country. 1
The rainfall has also resulted In
cutting down the amount of watei j
necessary in the irrigation sections of

STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, July 30. Stocks were
subjected to widely conflicting influ
ences today, creating heaviness and
occasional weakness in many of the
shares which usually govern the
course of the market.
Prices were 1 to 2 points higher at
the outset, the steel division leading
the excellent quarterly statement is
sud by the U. S. Steel corporation af
ter the close of yesterday's session.
Heavy selling, which immediately
followed and had its basis mainly in
widely circulated rumors that the fed
eral reserve board at Washington
would hold another conference to con
sider certain phases of the local spec
ulative situation, gave the market a
set back of 2 to 5 points before noon.
Denial later of these rumors result
ed in substantial recoveries, but Only
in a few important instances was the
reversal of the morning entirely over
come. Aside from the strength of a few
specialties in which the maneuvers of
pools and cliques were again more or
less effective, notable tobacco and
leather Issues, moderate losses prevail -
ed at the close. Sales 1,300,000 shares.
Unsettled conditions in exchange on
Paris, which approximated its mini
mum quotation, caused variable reac
tions in sterling, lires and the Swiss
rate, but Scandinavian remittances
were comparatively steady.
Weakness of local traction and a
slight setback in internationals fea
tured the irregular bond market. To
tal sales, par value, $13,650,000.
Old U. S. bonds were unchanged on
call.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, July 30. Many sowers
and a prospect of many others did
much today to bring about tower
prices in the corn market. Except for
July, which showed a net gain of lc.
the market finished weak at lV4c to
2c net decline, with. September
$1.95 to $1.95 and December
$1.68 to $1.69. Oats lost Yc to c.
In provisions the outcome ranged from
a setback of 45 cents to 5c advance.
Fresh moisture supplied to parts of
Illinois, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas and
the northwest tended materially to re
lieve the condition of the corn crop.
Selling of corn was from the outset
given considerable impetus which was
soon added to by an official forecast
of further showers scattered over a
wide territory.
Later, the government weekly crop
report received a general bearish
construction.
Oats eased down mainly in sympa
thy with corn, but cereals continued
to be depressed in some degree by the
race riots and car strike here. Pro
visions were dull and irregular. Re
newal of strength in the hog market
counterbalanced sympathy with the
weakness of grain.

imple Operations
Fitted Together
i
The business of Swift & Company is
the fitting together of many simple
operations.,
No one thing in a packing business is
particularly difficult for men trained to
do it; but no one thing is enough.
Thousands of other operations, pro
perly performed,are necessary for. the com
'pleted processes. And some one must
fit together all these thousands of simple
operations.
The success with which, a packing
business performs its function of supplying
the best possible meat products to the con
sumer with the greatest possible benefit
to both him and the producer depends upon
the energy, brains, experience, and faith
ful effort of the men trained in the business:
Swift & Company turns the producer's
live stock into meat for the consumer at
a profit of only a fraction of a cent a pound,
because it fits these operations together
with the least waste, overlapping, and
friction. .
Do you believe government direction
could do it better?
Let us send you a Swift "Dollar".
It will interest you.
