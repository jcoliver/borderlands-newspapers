..WASHINGTON. March 5. Eitter
controversy raged in the conference cf
governors and mayors today before the
report of the committee on resolutions
making a great variety of recommenda
tions on public Questions, linaHy was
adopted. Even after the viva voce
vote, delegates from the west, led by
Mayor Rolph of San Francisco, at
tempted to force a record vote to show
that they dissented from the majority,
but were overruled by Secretary of
Labor Wilson, who presided.
Adjournment was taken after Mayor
Rolph and' Governor Cox of Ohio,
chairman of the committee on resolu
tions, hid risen on question of per
sonal privilege concerning the cham
pionship of opposing sides in the de
bate. The resolutions which Governor Cox
announced, submitted unanimously af
ter elimination of all partisan subjects,
condemned doctrines which inveigh
against God and government. They
also recommended that the govern
ment should "not only prepare for the
transportation necessities of property,
but U3e the railroads as the means of
helping private industry," by carrying
out the program of improvements.
Sanction Price Fixing
Expressly disclaiming approval
of I
fixing of costs, the resolutions sanc
tioned government approval of price
schedules as a step toward establish
ing a new basis of Talues. Reduction
of freight rates on all building mate
rial, especially road material, was sug
gested. It was declared that reduc
tion of wages should come only as a
result of reduced living costs.
Recommendation was made that the
federal government continue Its -help-'
ful offices? with a view to averting
"serious consequences" in the finan-
cial affairs of public utilities, Settle-'

TORONTO, Mar. 5. All Canada has
been stirred by charges made in the
house of commons by R. Sam Hughes,
former minister of militia, that offic
ers commanding the dominion's forces
in France had needlessly sacrificed
the lives of their men in order to ad

legations were assumed to refer to Sir
Arthur Currie. commander in chief of
the Canadian forces, there is apparent
tonight a strong inclination in many
quarters to disagree with him. Sol

have taken up the cudgels in support
of General Currie.

WASHINGTON. Mar. 5. The gov
ernment today determined to retain
the railroads despite the failure to
provide funds for the railroad admin

ance themselves for the next few
months through private loans on the

the war finance corporation.
Efforts will be made to maintain
operations on a normal scale and to
carry on as much of the improvement
program as possible, in order to avoid
throwing employes out of work or oth
erwise disturbing industrial condi
tions. No attempt will be made to
solve the problem by raising rates.
These assurances were given by
Director General Hines in a public
statement and in an address to the
conference of governors and mayors

sums they can borrow until congress

"There would be two general ways
in which we might attempt to adart
ourselves to tlals new situation so sud
denly created." said Mr. Hines lour.
addressing the conference ct goTer
nors and mayors. fOne way. would be
to cut- down expenditures as rapidly
as possible in eTery direction. .The
other way would be to try to resort "io
eTery possible expedient to prevail on
the railroad companies and .the busi
ness interests affected to borrow the
.necessary money to enable, us to s"-
forward with tnese expenditures, and
I am emphatically in favor of Utopian
which contemplates financing tnese
matters so we can go forward - with
the expenditures rather of the plan .""
cutting ct the expenditures so. we
can avoid tha financing. I am abso
lutely out of sympathy " with 'any
policy which contemplates the slo

of throwin? anea -oat -of :employnjeaj
oiuhe idea that thereby the rates u
wages may be cut dewn fer the fu
ture. ."Approaching ' " the . matter along
th,ese iines, it is going to be my policy
ami with the most, cordial co-opera-tioa'bf-the
secretary of-"the treasury
and "of the w-4iBance corporailea to
try to find every -way we can to re
- imburse tee treasury -and -the railroad
administration through getting the
corporations to borrow the money to
pay back advances which have been
made and which it will be necessary
' to make to carry out our program.
"It is going to be very difficult, but
we are approaching it with the de
termination that we will make it suc
ceed in. a. very large extent am! that
we will pet a large measure of patri
otic co-operation frora all the interests
which arc affected.'1
In a statement. Mr. Hines said:
"In -connection with the consiacm
tkm of this question, there has ben
no discussion of raising rates, either
passenser or freight, because the mon
ey derived from rates goes into operat
ing revenues which primarily are not
aiiected by the present situation.
"In connection with necessary fin
ancing which will have to be done by
the railroad corporations, it is the rule
that no such, corporate financing utr
undertaken except on certitficate of
the railroad adffvinistration and there

Before th' senate appropriations
committee. Secretary Glass said last
week that failure of the measure ap
propriating $730,00.000 for the rail
roads, -would be disastrous and de
moralirins." - -' - .-.
"It will create the situation in rail
read circles." he said, "that will
amount to practical suspension of ac
tivities; interfere with the purchasing
activities of the administration. It wilt
Vtry greatly impair the credit of the
railroads. The only alternative that 1

into the open market and make leans
agregatia? neariy $1.0UhkU0o from
the banks. That condition would re
flect itself uron the Liberty loan, and

CHOWDER'S REPLY ON
COURTS MARTIAL IS
FALSE, SAYS SENATOR
I
Chamberlain Renews Contro
versy With War De
I partment
Fy Re-view Lri5tvl W;re-
WASHINGTON", "Mar. 3. Another
chapter ia the controversy between
congress and the war department over
the general question of military Jus
tice was added tonight by Senator
Chamberlain, chairman, of the military
committee ia the last senate, "who is
sued a statement declaring that "er
roneous and false" statements -were
contained in the reply of Major Gen
eral Crowder, judge advocate generat,
to the senator's address in the senate
last December.
Senator Chamberlain also sharply
criticized Secretary Baier. declaring
he "had permitted himself to be guid
ed by the reactionary elements of the
army."
Referring to the correspondence be
tween Mr. Baker and Representative
Gould of New York, regarding Brig
adier General AnselL former acting
judge advocate general, who recently
testified before congressional commit
tees concerning court martial cases,
the senator said the secretary's next
stf p would "be to reduce the rank of
General AnseU.' and added:
Flays Secretary Baker
"No man who Is not wholly Imperv
ious to the inhumanity in the court
martial system and to the opinion of
the country could not only refuse to
change the conditions, but also to pun
ish the man who Is responsible, more
than anyone else, for the conditions
being made known and for sucn steps
'as have been taken by the military
. authorities to change and "correct
them."
General Crowders letter replying to
Senator Chamberlain's address was
placed In the congressional records
last Monday by Representative Lunn
of New York. Accompanying It was
a letter from Mr. Baker saying the
general's reply had been sent to Sen
ator Chamberlain several wteks ago.
Admitting that he received the let
ter, the Oregon senator said it "con
tained so many mis-statements of fact
that I hesitated to make it public be
cause I did net care to embarrass the
secretary by having him stand sponsor
and be responsible for such erroneous
and false statements to the senate
of the United States."
Recalls Reversal
Senator Chamberlain discussed at
length the case, of a soldier on military
duty found in a shop at night and
sentenced to a long term of imprison
ment. ,
The soldier claimed at the trial that
, he had heard a noise in the shop and,
had entered thinking a robber was in
the place- This was one of th? cases
referred to by the senator in his orig
inal speech and it was treated in Gen
eral Crowder's reply.
"General Crowder In his endeavor to
furnish me with "authentic data" ia
this case," said the senator, "says
nothing about the court martial first
acquitting this soldier and then subse
quently, at the direction of the com
manding officer, who appointed the
court, reversing itself and finding the
soldier guilty and imposing a long
prison sentence. He simply states that
the accused soldier's story was dis-j
believed and he was found guilty."
This statement is wholly incorrect
I have read the record, and he appar
ently has not."
Declaring that on the very day Gen
eral Crowder signed the memorandum
reply submitted to congress he also
signed memorandum recommending
that this soldier be released and re
stored to his previous status in the
army. Senator Chamberlain said:
"I have gone st length into the mis
statements of General Crowder con
cerning this case so as to show con
clusively how unworthy of acceptance
his reply to me is. In regard to other
cases cited by me, it is sufficient to
state that the same false answers are
made."

More Stolen

Deputy Sheriffs Identi
fied by Merchants
Another large stock oi goods,
said to have been stolen from local
stores, was recovered yesterday
aftemooa by the police and sher
iffs office ia a Mexican home on
the Naco road. Among the loot
recovered were several pails of
lard. Identified by the Csr mar
ket and grocery, several cozen
pairs of shoes, identified by the
Water Shoe store on Brewery
Gulch, and more clothing and
groceries claimed by Luis G. Sena.
Mr. Sena made an inventory of
his stock yesterday and said that
with the exception of a few hun
dred doUars" worth of clothing,
all his goods had been recovered.
Immigration officers from Naco
came here yesterday and question
ed the Mexican prisoners as to
their length of stay in this coun
try. It was learned that Augus
tine Jaramillo and his wife had
passed through the Immigration
office at Naco three years ago. It
is probable that should the Mexi
cans be found guilty and senteno
ed to the penitentiary, they will
be deported to Mexico at the ter
mination of their sentence.

WASHINGTON. March 5. Republi
can organization of the next house of
representatives was pushed forward
today by1 party leaders, composing the
committee on committees, with practi- j
cally a final dcision that seniority of
memDersnjp wouia conunueio oeier-1
mine committee rant, lms action
taken in respect to the eleven princi-
pal committees, applies to chairman
ships as well as the other leading
places in the roster of the republican
committee membership.
Before undertaking to consider the
question of membership rank, the re
publicans decided on the apportion
ment of places on the committee be-
! tween the tow parties. Because of their
margin -of control of the next house,
the committee decided to increase the
majority by one member, with a sim
ilar reduction of democ ratio or minor-
iity membership. .
The principal committees having 21
members, would be divided between
! thirteen republicans - and eight demo
j crats, while practically the same ratio
j would obtain with the committees of
smaller memDersnip. A decision to
make possible use of the committees
on departmental expenditures for pro
posed investigation of war expendi
tures and other inquiries of depart
ment activities led to the membership
apportionment of these , committees
being agreed on as five republicans
and two democrats, instead of the 4 to
3 ratio that obtained in the last house, j
The decision as to the seniority onj
the principal committees was reached j
early in the meeting. Representative!
Gordney of Michigan, first being
chosen to head the ways and commit
tee, although lacking the support of
committee members who voted for
Representative Gillett of Massachu

test. No record vote, however, was
taken, and after Fordney's election,
Representative Good of Iowa, a Gillett
supporter, was chosen without objec
tion to head the appropriations com
mittee. Seniority prevailed undis-j
puted in the remainder of the selec-j
tions. j
Although announcement from the
committee said the seniority selections
were tentative, committee members
explained that the decisions virtually '
were final, although the selections !
must be approved by the party con-1

HOT DEBATE GREETS
HOWARD'S ELECTION
CONVENTION BILL
Election Bill Recommended
for Indefinite Postpone
ment by Committee
Mr. Wilsons Hole Card
At least a feeling of mild surprise was felt about the United States
upon the return of President Wilson from France, that he did not at
once go before congress with a statement of progress and facts con
cerning the League of Nations. Congress expected this action, and the
people anticipated it.
As the days of his visit in Washington passed, we wondered why
he did not make some move. Neither did he reply to his critics, nor
did he attempt to defend his position from their attacks.
Finally the people began to believe either that he feared to make a
fight at this time, or that he was holding a "hole card" to play at the
opportune moment.
He playsd his first hole card Tuesday night before sailing from
New York to Paris. Perhaps he has others for use later. But his ad
dress at the Metropolitan Opera house answered his critics of the
congress and assured his friends and supporters that he will make the
fight to the end.
President Wilson is relying, not on the senate or the congress for'
hLs support, but upon Americanism the Americanism of those who re
mained at home and fought battles and of those who carried the war
to Europe. Rising above the party question, putting the league on a
plane higher than partisan politics, he is making his appeal to Amer
icans. "The first thing I am going'to tell the people o the other side of the
water," he said, "is that an overwhelming maioritv of the American
- No party has the right
the long run will dare
people is in favor of the league of nations .
to appropriate this issue, and no party in
oppose iL
Through his address the president proceeded with this .in mind. He
dwelt at length upon the need for a league to enforce peace and upon
the demands of the peoples of the world for such aa organization. And
among the gems of the entire address was the most comprehensive and
clear definition of the league of nations yet propounded. He said:
"And so the league of nations is nothing more or less than the cove
nant that the world will always maintain the standards which it has
now vindicated by some of the most precious blood ever spilt."
The cry of humanity for a league which will embody these principles
Mr. Wilson expressed when he uttered "this solemn warning, not in
the way of a threat; the forces of the world do not threaten, they oper
ate. The great tides of the world do not give notice that thev are
going to rise and run; they rise in their majesty and overwhelming
might, and those who stand in their way are overwhelmed. Now the
heart of the world is awake and the heart of the world must be satis
fied." The soldier wanu the league of nations and will stand behind him'
in his efforts, the president told his audieace. He detailed how it
was his prtrCege to declare war on his interpretation of the of the pur
pose and thought of the people of the United States, and how the sol
diers went to- arms "with the feeling that they were sacredly bound to
the realization of those ideals" and that "they, were crossing those three
thousand miles of sea in order to show to Europe that the United States,
when it became necessary, would go everywhere where the rights of
mankind were threatened." : - -
Despite the attacks of partisan members of the senate and others of
the nation, the president is firm in his belief that the people of the
. United States wish the league. First, he 'tells his audience that the
league wfll be embodied as an integral part of the peace treaty, without
which peace cannot be made, and then that the people of tlfe United
States will attend to the final details of acceptance.
"When the treaty ponies back gentlemen on this side will find the
covenant not only in it. but so many threads of the treat v tied to the
covenant that you cannot dissect the. covenant from the treaty wihout
destroying the whole vital structure. The structure of peace will not
be vital without the league cf nations, and no man is going to bring back
a cadaver with him." said the president in announcing what he will re
turn to the United States for ratification. And ratification will come,
for the president believes that the people must ratify. "I did not need
to be told, as I have been told, that the people of the United States
would support this covenant. I am an American, and I knew they would
It is inconceivable in the mind of the president that American
ism will permit consideration of anything but acceptance of this cove
- nant. Therem lies the strength of his first hole card. It is in true
Americanism that the hope of the future lies. The fall realiiation of
the importance of Mr. Wilson's hole card stands out powerfuHv in the
closing words of his address:
The day will come when men' in America will look back with well
ing hearts and rising pride that they should hare been privileged to
ma-e the sacrifice which it was necessary to make in order to combine
tchir might and their moral power with the cause of justice for men
of every kind everywhere. God give us strength and vision to do it
ise!y. God give us the privilege cf knowing that we did it without
counting the cost, and because we were true Americans, lovers of lib
erty and doing right!"
i Kr" XVilsoa may have OEe or more other bole cards. But he has
puiyed the Erst wiia unfailing calculation, and a decided lack of bluff As
the game proceeds ie may yet be able to niaka his critics "eat their
orris."
Copper Industry at Stake
The present condition of the copper industry Is clearl- stated In
a very complete statement issued by the federal government on Febniarr
4. and it the facts developed, by government investigation will be calmly
and dispasionately considered by the general public, as well as emplovers
and emp.oyes engaged in the production of copper, the present predica

(By Review Leased Wire)
PHOENIX. Ariz," March 5. W
sor's election bill and Howard s party
convention measure came up in the
committee of the whole today. The
former was recommended for passage
and the Howard bill was unfavorablv
reported. Lines gave notice that he
intended to offer several amendments
to the Winsor code when it comes
for its third reading.
Vyne declared that the Howard con
vention? roposal was ar eversion to
antiquated and objectionable methods
wnen Gaibraith asked him if he was
aware several states were making that
cnange.
-ies- replied Vyne. "I know New
York and Pennsylvania have done so
and show me two more corrupt states."
Howard rose in defense of his bill. He
said Arizona was tired of the present
primary system as it had grown tired
of the old convention methods. H
contended that his bill eliminated fie
evils of the former convention and
provided the concrete action lacking
in the present primary plan.
Hot Debate Ensues
ine direct primary has faults.'
said Lines, "but I would be afraid to
nst returning to the modified conven
tion as outlined in the Howard bill.'
-auywmte declared the Winsor
measure would place the state in the
hands of a few men, to which Lines
replied that the Howard bill had even
more dangerous possibilities along
that line.
Speaker Peterson said he waa any
thing but satisfied with the primary
system, "but." said he. "the Howard
bill does not cure the evils of that
system. Further, grave doubts have
been raised of the constitutionality of
the Howard bill. It would give prefer
ential politicians with plenty of money
an opportunity to control a convention
as in the old days, an opportunity
they cannot have when they have to
Amend with the vote of the whnl
people.
"I doubt if prohibition ever would
have passed in Arizona, if it had been
left to the legislature, yet the people
wanted it, as they demonstrated when
they were permitted to go to the polls
on the question. If the legislature
cannot be relied on to earryout the
wishes of the people, how much less
could the' voters place their faith in
a convention open to the influences
of corrupt politicians."
Delbridsre thousht the point 'in the
Winsor bill which would appeal most
to the workingman had not been
touched on.
lt is a fact." he asserted, "that
hundreds .of miners in this state are
discharged just prior to an election
on . account of their political .faith.
Their homes thus are broken up and
they are forced to move, thus losing
their votes. This bill provides for ab
sentee Toting and this evil, at least,
will be corrected."
The vote recommending the passage
of the Winsor bill was 17 to 44. while
Howard's bill was recommended for in
definite postponement by 17 to 1
Delbridge's bill to give laborers'
liens right of way over all other
claims against building or other work
ings precipitated a rather lencth- .l
bate and in the end was recommended
for indifinite postponement.
The majority of the committee or
ways and means reported favorably on
the bill, while Barrows in a minoriv
report stood against it..
Phillips was afraid the passage cf
the measure would deprive legitimate
creditors of their security, and said
the bill was unfair as it stood.
Delbridge then offered aa amend
ment providing that laborers liens
would not take precedence over mort
gages or liens recorded rrior to the
commencement of work, but that the
laborers' liens would taken reeedence
over any other mortsages proved to
have been tiled to prevent the collec
tion of just debts.
Coleman recalled a, similar law
which had been in erfect 15 years ago
and had to be amended at that time
since it had practically killed the leas
ing and optioning of minin? claims
owners finding that holders of options
and leases had rup up heavy bills and
rendered the. properties liabel to
seirure.
At this point Dclbridje said he
would withdraw his amendment since
nn saw ihe ttde was drifting against
him and Lines' motion to recommend
the bill for indefinite postponement
carried. i

ACTION AGAINST J. A.
KARLSON DISMISSED
By Review I-eusorl Wire
PHOENIX. Aria.. March 5. The
state corporation commission's case
against J. A.. Karlson . and Joseph
White collapsed in Justice De Sousa's
court when the men were ar
raigned on a charge of selling stock in

Evidence developed that Karlson
had been selling stock which he had
received in payment for mining claims
turned in to the company, while White
had been disposing of stock which he
held on option from Karlson.
Since both men were held to be
selling stock which was their personal
