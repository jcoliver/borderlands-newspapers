(By 'Review Leased Wire).
DALLAS. Texas, Sept. 10. Dal
las, the most populous county In
Texas, voted "dry" in a local option
election today. With but six pre
cincts out of nient-yxsiknuUTex
cincts out of ninety-six missing,

The county outside the ' city of

twenty years was the deciding fac
tor in the election, the city hav

country to vote out liquor by local
option. The population of the city

Sweden as well as the other neutrals

goods are replaced by commodities

Some American officials say the war
would end within six months if Sweet

stopped.
Argentine?
Another phase of the situation that
is given careful attention here is the
possible effect if Argentina breaks
relations with Germany or declares
war. Argentina this winter will have
large quantities of wheat for export

WASHINGTON, Sept. 10. The cri
sis precipitated by the forced resigna
tion of General Korniloff as command
er in chief of the Russian armies is
regarded here as possibly the most
serious of many in that country's six
months of existence as a democracy.
Sure Of Success.
The open fashion in which the do-
posed commander demanded from
Premier Kerensky a virtual dictator
shi, and the adherence to his plans of
former Deputy Lvoff with his follow
ing of the duma and powerful mem-
bers of the intellectual and military government's order to assume com
classes, indicates that the Korniloff i mand of the armies in view of Kor
forces feel sure they can succeed, niloff" s dismissal, indicating to the

Point At Issue.
It is understood here the chief point
at issue is the organization of the
army along strict disciplinary lines,
including the death penalty for sol
diers violating orders, advocated per
sistently by General Korniloff. Al
though Premier Kerensky has declar
ed himself for the Korniloff program,
the provisional government has exer
cised a check on the death sentence
through government reviewing com
missioners at the front.
Korniloff Despairs.
Apparently General Korniloff d-
spaired of improving the situation byj statements of the workmen's and sol

does not count on compromise tactics
and is ready to apply his policy of
"blood and iron" if necessary against
the revolt.
"Not Dangerous."
A gleam of hope came from For
eign Minister Terestchenko's . state
ment in an interview today that h
believed the revolt "not dangerous"
In this connection it is exDlained bv
Dersons familiar with the vicissitudes
of Russian politics that General Korn
iloffs action has no connection with
the recently disclosed plot to restore
the monarchy, but is intended, by its
promoters only as the quickest means
to the common end of preserving Rus
sian democracy against Germany.
Must Have Discipline. v
A number of times recently it has
been denied by the provisional min
isters that the government was at odds
with General Korniloff over army dis
cipline porblems, despite reports that
Korniloff' repeatedly has threatened
to resign if army officers were not
given more power to enforce discip
line. It was recalled that last May
he resigned as commander of the Pet
rograd garrison because workmen's
and soldier's delegates insisted on a
referendum on military orders.
New Chief in North
Officials here see in the appoint
ment of General Klenibovsky, who has
commanded the armies inthe north
during the recent retreat before Riga,
evidence that the government hopes
to strengthen its northern positions
and hold the Germans against further
advance on Petrograd
K,emb0V8kv !
will remain at his present post in the
north, according to the premier's proc
lamation, and probably dill be in a
better position to draw troops and
supplies to the Riga sector.
Younger Regime
General Klembovsky is one of the
younger Russian generals who here-;the
tofore has not plaed a spectalar part;
in the war. He Is regarded, however.

PETROGRAD, Sept. 10 (via Lon
don). Premier Kerensky today ad
dressed a proclamation, to the army,
to the nation and also to committees
of the army at the front, outlining the,
attempted coup of General Kornliotf
through Vladmir Nicolaievitch Lvoff
and the measures that had been taken
as a result. Regarding General Lo
komsky, the premier says:
Condemns Lokomsky
"The chief of staff. General Lo
komsky. also proved a traitor. He
refused to carry out the provisional
and the conclusion of a separate
peace. The government is in full
agreement with the executive of the
workmen's and soldiers' deputies for
taking measures for the crushing of
the counter-revolutnonary plot insti
tuted by traitors to their fatherland."
Steps Against Korniloff
After announcing the dismissal of
Korniloff and stating that he would
be punished for treachery, the proc
lamation adds:
"Against Korniloffs attempts to di
rect individual military detachments
to Petrograd. most decisive measures
have been taken."
The proclamation refers to the
' KnniAKV. nnil ftflrts
Appeal to Councils
"AH of the army organizations
should give the government and the
deep roots among the commanding
(orce of the army. It is necessary to
preserve full calm and firmness and
to use their exertion in the struggle
with the external enemy. All events
and measures taken by army organ
izations should be indicated to the
workmen's and soldiers' organiza-
I tion s."
PETROGRAD. Sept. 10. Premier
Kerensky has declared that a state of
war exists in the town and district of
Petrograd.
Premier. Kerensky has ordered Gen
eral Korniloff, commander-in-chief of
the Russian armies, to resign in con
mand for supreme power. General
Klembovsky has been appointed commander-in-chief.

2 per cent tax on corporations, now
paying 2 per cent the senate bill pro
vides for an additional 4 per cent to
raise $538,000,000.
Equalize Traffic Tax
On public facilities the senate re
tained the house 3 per cent tax on
freight transportation estimated to
raise $77,500,000, but cut fi'oni 10 to
5 per cent the tax on passenger traf
fic, reducing the estimated revenue
from J75.000.000 to $37,500,000. Five
per cent taxes proposed by the house
on electric light, gas and local tele
phone bills, estimated to raise $30,
000,000 were eliminated, but the five
cent tax on longdistance telephone and
telegraph messages costing fifteen
cents or ngpre, was restined. An ex
press tax of one cent ror each twenty
five cents paid for express transporta
tion was substituted for the house 8
per cent levy on express payments.
New Stamp Tax
A new stamp tax of one cent on
parcels requiring over twenty-five
cents charges was added to equalize
express and parcel post competition.
The senate rejected house taxes tn
insurance policies issued or renewed,
and added a new tax of 2 per cent on
cameras, to raise $500,000.
Motor Licenses
For the house 5 pe rcent manufac
turers' tax on automobiles and motor
cycles, estimated to raise $68,000,000,
the senate inserted a new clause for
a graduated federal license tax on
owners, estimated to secure $41,000,
000. With a tax of $2.50 ton motor
cycles, the senate pla nwould tax au
tomobile owners from $5 up, based on
the original selling price, with an al
lowance up to 50 per cent on used ve
hicles. On Amusements
Estimates of $60,000,000 under the
house bill for new assessments on
omusement admissions and club dues
are reduced to $18,000,000 by senate
changes exempting many amusement
resorts, Chautauquas, and eliminating
entirely the t'ause 10 per cent on club

Care should be taken to strain the

Just try it! Get thre-j ounces of

NEW YORK FINANCIAL
NEW YORK. Sept 10. Improve
ment in sentiment was evident from
the course of the stock market today.
Transactions were on a smaller scale,
but the undertone was good.
A number of issues made pains of
one to three points in the early trad
ing, but weak spots developed late
In the day and the whole market
eased off. At the close the tone was
heavy and a good deal of the fore
noon's advantage was lost. Total
sales, 434.000 shares.
The steel and copper shares made
a particularly good showing on the
early rise. These stocks as well as
the list in general benefitted from
favorable reports regarding the ulti
mate adjustment of price schedules
by official action.
The decrease of the 437.000 tons In
unfilled orders shown in the monthly
report of the United States Steel
Corporation was about in line with
forecasts and exerted little Influence.
Tle selling movement of the last
hourraffected a number of high-priced
investment issues, some of which had
not reflected the severe scaling down
recehfty of the market in general.
American Telephone dropped to the
lcwest'point since the beginning of
the war, and (neral Electric sold
down to the owets point since 1913.
Call money ruled at 4 per cent,
with a top rate of 6, and quotations
for time funds were to 1 per cent
higher.
Ponds were irregular. Liberty bonds
sold at 99.92 to 99.98. Total were

A SPLENDID CREED.
The late Harrison Gray Otis, soldier, publisher and
builder, left behind for his children an immense estate,
of which the Los Angeles Times formed a principal part.
And he left something more valuable even than his news
paper or his real estate or stocks and bonds. He left
a letter to his children in which he gave his views as to
how the Times, the apple of his eye, should be conducted.
Every line of this letter is a classic on good citirenship.
Gen. Otis was a strong man; strong in his likes and dis
likes; strong in character; strong in his love of country
and hatred of shams and quackery and injustice. The
following paragraphs of this greatest of his legacies are
reproduced here as follows:
"Scourge as with a whip of scorpions dishonesty, pre
tense, scoundrelism, treason to Truth and the country
and every form of evil that threatens with destruction
the home, the community or the country, and at the same
time encouraging every sound tendency and condition
in human society that makes for its preservation, sta
bility and endurance on high and right lines.
"Stand for sound, rational and tested business methods
and policies in the management of The Times news
paper, as well as In the conduct of commercial and public
business, in order that this journal and all honest people
may 'live long and prosper', grow in grace and be happy.
Hold up the hands and cheer the hearts of the lowly and
deserving, no matter how humble they may be; quail
not before the aggressions of unjust power, and live and
die game and true. Fear God and do right.
"Encourage all free, independent and honest labor, no
matter how humble, so it be honestly conducted; at the
same time not hesitating to support and defend powerful
financial, commercial and Industrial alliances, provided
that they, too. operate honestly and legitimately, when
organized to accomplish mighty and worthy tasks too
formidable to be undertaken by single individuals; for
true it is that it Is not the size of the operation, but the
integrity with which it is conducted, that determines it?
legitimacy. Always bear in mind the demonstrated
truth that it is, after all, the sane, brave, level headed,
self-restrained, right-minded, honest men and women of
the land upon whom rests, and will always rest, the re
sponsibility for holding the family, society, business,
government and the country together.
"Continue the upstanding and long-pursued policy of
this journal in working, day in and day out, for the up
building on sound lines of the favored and favorite city
and section wherein The Times and its makers have
their homes; and continue also to aid and abet the un
halting advance of all California, the entire Pacific Coast
and the 'ultimate West."
AS A MAN THINKS? SO IS HE.
John M. Robertson, member of parliament for Great
Britain, in a remarkable book just Issued in the form of
an open letter to a prolessor of the Berlin university,
deals with the fundamental differences between Brltau
and Germany. He quotes a paragraph from Moziey, an
old English essayist and historian that sets forth the
German character so forcibly and plainly that it is re
produced here as follows:
"Instil from his earliest Infancy into man the
ida t-'iat he belongs to another. Is the property
of another; let everything around proceed upon
this idea; let there be nothing to Interfere with
it, or rouse suspicion in his mind to the contrary,
and he will yield entirely to that idea. He will
take his own deprivation of right, the necessity
of his own subservience to another, as a matter
of course. And that idea of himself will kerp
him In order. He will grow up with the im
pression that he has not the right of ownership
in himself, in his pasHions, any more than he has
in his work. He will thus be coerced from
within himself, but not by himself; i. e. not by
any active faculty of self-coniuiaud, but by the
passive reception of an Instilled notion which
be has admitted into his own mind, and which
has fastened upon him so strongly that be can
not throw it oft."
This is the reason that German troops go calmly and
obediently on and commit unspeakable outrages at the
command of the Prussian powers that be. Not long ago
a German said to tbe editor of The Review: "I do not
believe these stories of German outrages. I do not see
how you can do so, either. You know me and like me.
like you. You know I would not do such things; could
not do them. Yet I am an ordinary German of the av
erage type. My people are not cruel or bloodthirtsy."
No, they are not. The editor's best friend on earth is
a German. He is as gentle as a child. BUT, the Ger
man characteristic is obedience. It is part of him.
Ingrained and amalgamated and set and hardened
through three hundred years of absolutel domination. It
has been said that German soldiers of the type of tbe
German quoted above, doubtless, wept even as they car
ried out the orders of debauchery, destruction and death
to non-combantants In Belgium. But they did it never
theless. The lords of Germany are absolute. Obedience
is 'part and parcle of their subjects. It is a matter of
course; it always has been and always will be. Gott is
great and the Kaiser is His prophet No Moslem slave
was ever blinder or more fanatical than is the German
of today in his obedience to the powers of state above him
and vested in the kaiser's hand, and through him in the
hands of his lords and blood and iron councilors.
Tbe fabric must be broken and made over again be
fore peace can come to the world. The German armies
must be beaten decisively before autocracy ceases to con
trol, sway and direct all the forces of this thorough, dis
ciplined and powerful people. Any talk of peace is mere
twaddle or terror or treason until Haig and Petaln and
Pershing smash through. The Kaiser is still the only
watch tower on the Rhine. In the far distance is Gott, but
He is small and vague and indistinct in comparison with
Wilhelm, Master of all the Huns.
We note with pleasure that Bisbee merchants have all
signed an agreement to close their stores every evening
at six o'clock, thereby giving their hard-working clerks
much shorter hours an-1 more chance for recreation.
There is no reason why a clerk should work longer hours
than a mechanic, miner or o ce man. Tombstone mer
chants have for a number of years observed this rulin.s
and close strictly at six o'clock every evening regardless
of everything and customers knowing that The doors wll:
close at that hour make it a point to purchase their wants
before that hour. We are glad to see Bisbee merchants
follow in the right direction. Tombstone Prospector.
CALLING KINGS LIARS.
The London Saturday Review is profoundly impressed
with one aspect of President Wilson's reply to the pope
which may have escaped American readers.
"We cannot remember." says the Review, "that ever
before the sovereign of a great nation with an army and
a fleet in existence has been told that he is a liar."
The highly respectable London publication, though its
formal approval to "this terrible insult" directed at Kais
er Wilhelm, does so with bated breath. It is secretly
shocked and horrified at such democratic temerity.
If this is really the first time a powerful monarch has
been publicly called a liar, it was certainly time for some
body to start it, and Mr. Wilson should be given due
credit for establishing a new and worthy precedent.
Kings and emperors have been notorious liars through
all ages. The wicked ones have based their power on
lies, kept their people In subjection by lies, bluffed and
bulldozed other rulers and other nations by lies. The
whole institution of monarchy, particularly "divine right"
monarchy, has been based on a lie from the dawn 'of
history.
It is good for monarchs to be told the truth, and espe
cially good for them when the truth happens to be th-'i
blunt statement that they are such inveterate breakers
of promises that their word cannot be trusted and they
have put themselves beyond the pale of gentlemanly na
tions. It is good for the whole world. It is a practical
exemplification of democracy. It represents a new
brand of diplomacy.
Hitherto diplomats have regularly practised t hi art of
lying with readiness and fluency, but have scrupulously
refrained from calling each other liars. With unfettered
and free-speaking democracy taking the upper hand in
the world's affairs, international liars, no matter how ex
alted their rank, ma be pilloried like private liars, and
truthfulness may become the vogue in diplomatic circles.
COUP Or CQMMANER
MATHS RUSSIA
"The Senate Squawkers", is the name given to the ob
structionists in the nation's most responsible law mak
ing body by the editor of the Atlanta Constitution. And,
by the shade of every fowl from Noah's dove down to the
last new fledged gooselet, 'tis a true and apt title! A
petty, puny, pusillanimous senator will arise and speak
for five hours about things of which he knows the least
and be is protected and abetted by the old motheaten
senate rule of courtesy. It would be only irritating ami
annoying and costly in money in ordinary times, but
right now it may well cot American lives. Time wasted
now by these petty traitors and obstructors spouters,
means payment In American blood in Flanders next sum
mer. The more quickly we get ready to strike with full
force, the shorter the war. Washington is burning the
most precious daylight ever known since the first verse
of the book of Genesis was written. Only public senti
ment, organized and well directed, can muzzle these iron
jawed squawkers.

Kerensky Approved
This group, said M. Lvoff, did not
object to Kerensky personally, but de
manded that he transfer the portfolio
of war to M. Savinkoff, assistant min-I
ister of war, wh'o all along had sup- j
ported ohrniloff s demand. M. Lvoff
added:
"If you agree, we invite you to come
to headquarters and meet General
Korniloff. giving you a solemn guar
antee that you will not be arrested."
(By Review Leased Wire.)
PETROGRAD, Sept. 10. Members j
of the Russian cabinet today told the i
Associated Press that the provisioai
government regarded General Kor-i
niloff's pronunciamento as an act of
rebellion which must be rushlessly
suppressed.
The members of the provisional
government refused to be quoted by :
name in conversations with the As-!
sociated Press. They stated that tho ;
ministers "hadreached an agreement)
regarding the following points of j
view:
Act Is Rebellion I
"The government regards General j
Korniloff s pronunciamento as an act
of rebellion, as a dangerous adven
ture and a threat to the revolution ,
and liberty which, unless the ulti-.
matum is withdrawn, must be ruth-1
lessly suppressed.
Country Loyal
'The government has no doubt that
it has at its disposal sufficient loyal
troops and the overwhemling support
of the population to enable it to ex
ecute this program.
"The government has decided to re
organize itself, placing all the power
in the hands of a small group of lead
ing men.
Counter Revolution
'The government regards General
Kornlloff's attempt further as essen
tially counter revolutnonary and
aimed at the restoration of the des
potic regime.
Lvoff in Fortress
'Vladimir Lvoff, who was arrested, j
was first imprisoned in the winter i
palace, but now has been sent under j
heavy guard to the Petropavlovsk i
fortress."

A GREAT MEDICINE
TO PREPARE RECEPTION
DeArcy Smith of the Phelds Dodge
auditing department, left Saturday ev
ening for California where he will re
main for a few weeks. Since his
playmate, Chet Johnson joined the 1st
Ariozona, Smithy has been running
around as lost and so he decided to
go to California and will fix up a play
ground for himself and have it ready
when the latter arrives with the Ari
zona regiment. Smith disposed of his
steamer trunk and auto before he left.
That most successful of all remedies'
for woman's ailments, Lydia E. Pink-i

origin to a botanic recipt which came
into the possession of Lydia E. Pink-,

This recipe had proved so effective!
in the practice of a skilled physician
that Mrs. Pinkham procured the herbs j
and steeped and prepared them in truei
old-time fashion on her kitchen stove j

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been rev

perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today it is no longer a
a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and econo

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fixed water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.
