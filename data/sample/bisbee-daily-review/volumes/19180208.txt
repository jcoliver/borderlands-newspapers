REPUBLICAN
SENATORS TO
OPPOSE BILL
OF PRESIDED
Calling of Caucus Presages De
termined Opposition to the
Administration Measure
Known as Overman BUL
(Br Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7. A move
toward concerted Republican opposi
tion of tbe new administration bill
proposing to give President Wilson
blanket authority to re-organize and
co-ordinate government agencies, a
speech Sn the bouse by Representative
Glass of Virginia, denouncing criti
cism of the government temporary
suspenf icn of senate debate, were to
day's developments in the controversy
over war machinery re-organization.
A conference Saturday morning or
Republican senators the first held
since the United States entered the
war was called late today by Repub
ican Leader Gallinger, to consider
the new bill President Wilson sent to
the senate yesterday. Hitter opposi
tion to the measure is expressed
openly by Republicans and privately
by several Democratic leaders. There
were twenty-five signatures on the
call for the Republican conference.
The Republicans also expect to con
sider joint action on the administra
tion measure to create a war finance
corporation, which is being urged by
Secretary McAdoo and upon other ad
ministration legislation.
With tbe Overman bill injecting a
new and unexpected element into the
controversy, several senators, plan
ning adiresses on the military com-j
mttiee's war cabinet and munitions
director bills, postponed them, as the
senate held but a brief session with
out renewal of tbe debate. Tomor
row Senator Thomas of Colorado.
Democrat, expects to speak against
the committee bills.
In the house Representative Glass
praised the administration's war rec
ord and denied Senator Chamberlain's
declaration that the war department
had broken down. He detailed army
achievements and declared ten times !
more troops had been sent to France
than had been expected.
Representative Mason. Republican
of Illinois, who followed Representa
tive Glass, told the house he admired
Secretary Baker as a man who could
admit mistakes, and added:
"For God's sake let's quit fighting
each other and fight the kaiser.

REPLACED TO

County and Gty Health Au-'
thdrities Decide That City
Should Undergo Part Quar
antine to Safeguard Public
t
The quarantine is on again.
At a meeting yesterday afternoon, I
attended by Mayor Erickson and oth
er members cf the city health board.
i Dr. C- A. Hunt, county superintendent 1
( of health. Sheriff Harry Whetler and
City Marshal Allison, it mas decided
to close all theaters, billiard parlors,
schools, lodges, card games, dances
and churches, as a precautionary mea
sure to prevent the sniRllpox'epiuemic j
spreading. The orjer does not apply
to cigar stcre and soft drink parlors
but the public is asked to co-operate
in every way mith the city and coun
ty health officials by not congregat
ing in the post office or any other
place or; remain in any place or store (
or office longer than is necessary to I
transact business. People on the:
streets are also asked to keep, niov-j
ing. I
Lr. Hunt made a very frank and;
open statement explaining his stand j
in the matter and the necessity fo;
taking this action. He told cf his longj
experience mith smallpox both ini
Mexico and in this country and ex-1
plained the serious results which'
might easily come about unless prompt j
and efficient action was taken to curb ;
the disease. j
At the completion of the meeting!
Mayor Erickscn. members of the city I
health board and Dr. Brown unanim
ously agreed that it was for the best
interes of all concerned that the
quarantine be piit into effect asain.
Sherilfjyieeir explained that he
mas here at the instance of the Slate
Health Officer and that unless prompt
measures were taken here to prevent
the spread of the disease that the city
would be placed under strict quaran
tine and isolated from the rest of the
county and that troops would be sent
here to enforce the order if neces
sary. Dr. Hunt said that there mere now
15 cases here and that of this num
ber a majority were varioloid, or mild
cases, but that at least two of the
cases mere Tery severe. Two of the
cases were contracted at Tucson and
two found at Hereford were infected;
at Hoi brook. Ariz.
Schools Closed.
The city schools mere ordered clos
ed and Dr. Hunt stated that be had ad
vised this action more because of
public sentiment in the matter than
because there was any great neces
sity of such action. He said that be
cause of the strict vaccination rule
in effect in the schools and because
the children were under strict sur
veillance and where they would at
once be cared for upon the slightest
signs of infection that he believed the
children were in less danger in school
than when playing at borne and on
the streets. He warned all parents
to be careful and keep their children
off of the- streets, i
Dr. Hunt told how most of the cases
now being cared for had become in
fected here and said that investiga
tion disclosed that most of these men
had visited local picture shows, pool
rooms and other places affected by
the quarantine order.
He also told how people going into
stores usually remain but a few min
utes and pass on whereas in shorn s
and pool rooms people are more like
ly to become infected because of the
inability to ventilate thoroughly at
this time of the year. He explained
that despite fumigation and spraying
in such places that if these remained
open there mas a strong possibility
of the epidemic spreading.
Most of these now infected arc
young fellows m-uo live in rooming
houses and board and mho have no
other place to spend their time when
not working except at picture shoms
and in billiard parlors.
Seriousness Explained.
Dr. Hunt further explained the seri
ousness of a real epidemic such as
mas combatted at iHiuglas last year
when some 70 cases mere cared lor
and be told how the situation mas
handled there by even more drastic
quarantine measures than had been
proposed here. He said that forty
per cent of the white people who were
infected at Douglas died whereas of
the Mexicans mho contracted the dis
ease the percentage was less.
Dr. Leonard of Douelas took prompt
action today according to Dr. Hunt,
to fnd out If there were any cases
there and said that If he discovered
there were any cases there he mould
take strict precautions to prevent tbe
fpread of the disease.
Pr. Hunt said that experience in
dealing with the disease had proved
that it mas absolutely necessary to
take stringent action to cutb its
spread because in the event of its

acute problem. Unemployed workmen,
mho are leaving the cities for heir

throughout Russia. Ti'.e a'l Russian
congress of workmen's aiid soldiers'
delegates adjourned without adopting
the plans of M. Kaleray v. the minis
ter of agriculture, for the apportion
ment of .the land. Consequently, no
definite legislation has been estab

The land owning peasants ma well as
the bourgeoisis are to be djveated of
their estates. Premier LeuTne toUay
addressed a large gathering of abat

war on all village exploiters and rich
peasants as they did on the wealthy
land omners.
Urges Internal War.
"We hare taken the l nd to give it
to the poor peasants." the premier
said. "Do not let the rich peasants
or exploiters get the asricultural im

against every rich one. The police
sre dead and buried and the masses
must take affairs in their own hands.
"External war Is finished or is be

PETROGRAD. Tuesday. Feb.
The semi-official news agency
an-
nounces that the workmen's and sol
diers' deputies have addressed a
manifesto to similar bodies recently
organized in Herlln and Vienna, de
scribing the joy which the Russian
workers and soldiers heard of their
glorious fisht against the German and
the universal imperialism at a mo
ment when Austro-German land omn-
prs and bankers were preparing to
strangle martyrized Poland, and the
Hoffmans. Von Kuehlmanns and on
Kindenburgs were threatening the lib
erty aad independence of Courtland
and Lithuania."
The manifesto urges the Austro
German workmen to continue their
good efforts to the end that the nego
tiations with Russia which have be
gun at Brest-Litovsk with Foreign
Secretary von Kuehlmann may be
terminated with Dr. Karl Uebknecht,
the socialist leader, now in prison.

"The Bolsheviki are hoping to suc

"We understand now why they de

Ships Under Screen.
Such details as have come from Eu
rope indicate that the Tustania was
torpedoed by a siu?:e submarine
which siirped under the advance
screen of destroyers leading tbe con
voy fleet. There is no evidence of
an attack in force and the U-boat
probably got into the path of the liner
largely by chanre. sometimes as
n'any as forty 'vessels make np a ?on
vcyed fleet. -
War department officials woula say
nothing today as to the destination of
the Tnscan'a. It was admitted that
American tra.-ps had been sent for

There is no indication in the loss

of sui.marires against America troop
ship lines has been. On the contrary,
te tflorts of the German high com
mani still appear to be directed
primarily aaainst the carzo craft
bound ftT British ports.
Factor In Rescue.
As the roll of messases from the
Tuscania dwindled today, expressions
rf anazTi'ent were heard Jreque;;t!y
that a crowded transport could be
torpedoed wfta such roniiarativeIy
sn.all loss of" life. The nearness of
rescue craft, the 2ct hat the vessel
ti afloat for two hours after a tor
pedo had exploded in her boiler
rc :m. and possibly the proximity oi
the Eritish coast ail were factors in
reducinz the loss.
Army ofticers say i; nu;st be re

The reason for the dec-line ln net in-

by the report. Operating revenues

Only $58,703,000 were received frum

Canadian subject in this countty can-'
not possibly escape linbil'ty to serv-!
ice in the war. Instead of being evj
e;upt from conscription of any sort."
he now become iiiuch niorol iab!e to j
service than the American. .The auej
'.'"rcit for conscription in his case ex-j
lends from 20 to 40. This is a per-j
fet ily fair arrangement for it compels :
?vcry man who clr.ims. British citi
zenship to place hiraseif on pract!vl-
ly the same footing as his fe'.low
country nit n at home; and surelv riii-
zciiLiiip slculd cr.rry vi:h it oilira
llons as well as advantages. British;
subjects will of course have the same
-hances cf exemption on application
to the ambassador as British citizenr
it home. For the first time British
citizens are placed cn a footing ot
equality the world over, and the Brit
:sher has ample opportunity to serve
:n the forces of his own country foi
:e will have sixty days after congress
passes the necessary legislation to en
ist in the British or Canadian forces.
And he will be doing better work by
enlisting at once rather than waiting
'ixty days, hat we need at present
s man power. If the Britisher en
lists with us he can get quickly to
Piimn anit he marie effective tnitrh
rooner than if he waits a few weeks
longer for the draft. I don't know
a hat the actual addition to the Amer-j
"can draft on account of this conven- j
ion will be. Some reports show that '
there are 200.0'K) Britishers in Amer
ica of draft age. If twenty-fiye per.
ent of that number, having failed to '
enlist or get exemption, are taken in j
the draft there is an addition of 50.-;
000 men to the American draft, but no
-eal increase of man power, since t
these Britishers will simply take the : 1
place of an equal number of Ameri-,J
cans. If on the contrary these men 1 A
enlist in the British and Canadian ar-: 2
mies- that means an immediate and 3
positive increase in man power. There-'
for it is quite clear that the Britisher ' J
in this country of military age cannot ! 3
do his full duty by waiting to be J
aranea. The Convention is very use-1 g
ful in bringing home to him that If ; a WlsviJi.
f;ght he must either enlist or be draft
ed, but I consider it important to point
out to him that his duty is still to
enlist rther than wait for tbe draft.
He can join either the Canadian or
British forces by coming up to the
nearest office of the British and Can
adian Recruiting mission; there is a
trench in every big centre in the
United States. Every man is needed
and is needed now."

The Smallpox Scare
It is with a good deal of satisfaction that The Review
announces this morning that the city and county authori
ties have agreed upon measures to prevent the spread of
smallpox contagion in this community. And It was very
much to be regretted that there was any friction or
divergent views in the beginning. The least confusion
or conflicting methods between two sets of authorities
in case of any emergency always arouses a lot of faction
and feeling and dissention among citizens.
A quarantine or embargo of any kind entails hard.
6hips and sacrifice upon the public generally. But after
it is over all right thinking people recognize its necessity
even if they grumble under the yoke. There is only one
way to prevent or combat a contagious disease, and that
is by most drastic regulations affecting the public A
bouse, or a district or a community, wherein the disease
rages, must be isolated. Public gathering places must
be closed. By this means only can the disease be check
ed by medical skill and nursing.
On the other hand, it is necessary that cool heads
and conservative officials decide upon these matters.
They are in the class of the last resort. Public interests
and private enterprise should net be subjected to them
at every puff of wind tha' jhws a cloud to cast the
shadows cf fear or exciteznt arss the official vision.
However, this seems :.jt to have been the case here.
Several mild cases of smallpox had developed before the
disease was discovered at all and these quickly increased
to sixteen cases before Dr. Hant, the county health of
ficial, felt the necessity tor taking drastic action.
And if he was to take action at all it should have been
drastic and enforced rigidly. Half way measures to check
an epidemic are worse than none at all, for they entail
hardships without doing any real good.
Tlere was a misunderstanding at f.rst between the
city and county officers and as a result there was much
grumbling and complaining cn the part of adherents of
both before all responsible persons got together and
reached an understanding. Once the city and county of
ficials and leading business men met together and took
counsel after complete and earnest discussion an agree
ment w-as quickly reached without the least friction.
Common sense and public spirit prevailed. Needful pre
cautions were agreed to by alL All amusement and pub
lic gathering places must be closed while the danger from
the spread of the disease lasts. This entails financial
loss upon a few and inconvenience upon many people.
The Review is among the first, for it loses a not incon
siderable business from the theatres, so no one can de
clare that this paper sits in the sunshine and preaches
to those in the shadow. But the action agreed upon
at the meeting yesteriay was the safe, sane, sensible
and inevitable thing among men of intelligence and ex
perience. The county health official stands high in his profes
sion and is a broad, fair, cool-headed man. Back him
up. Do it w.'iolebeartedty, even if it hurts. The public
good comes first. It may well be possible that the
danger is not menacing, but no one can speak with any
certainty upon this point. It is better to play too safe
in the beginning than to pay too much in the end.
The disease here is in a mild form. It is to be hoped
and trusted that it will soon pass away and even the
inconvenience be forgotten. Put stop and think what a
raping smallpox epidemic would mean in this district
And who would bear the chief blame and burden for it?
The county health officer, of course. So we must grin
and hear our losses of money and amusement, not least
of which is that Max Fignian show, booked for next week
at a local theatre.

Chicago; A. E Rowlands, local man
ager of an adding machine company,
and Cullen Cain, managing editor of
the Bisbee Review, who addressed the
University club yesterday, made brief
addresses.
Mr. Cain observed that through a
good advertising business. El Paso
publishers are enabled to give excel

municipality could have a better pub
licity medium. Some advertising has
been seriously affected by the war. for j
the reason that retailers are unable I

will be very happy when they learn of
the narrow escape which they bad
from being forced to remain in Bisbee
instead of being permitted to leave for
El Paso last night.
Both young men. together with Chas.
Lewis Sinclair. John P. Schaler, and
Ira B. Doyle of Bisbee. and R. J. B.
Regnier of Douglas, left Bisbee last
night for El Paso, tagged for the nary
recruiting station there.
S. G. Hart local navy recruiting of
ficer, last night received a message
from El Paso telling hiin not to send
any more recruits except ex-service
men. This wire came after the train
left and hence the cause for joy on the
part of Davenport and Gomel, who
were very anxious to do their bit and
likewise desirous of becoming mem

early date.
Hart is allowed a quota of but two
new enlistments each week but can
send ex-service men in excess ot that
number to the main station.

By M. W. LANG
The Lake Arthur Oil Co. owns more oil land in the belt mapped
cut as oil bearing by Prof. McWorter. than is contained in the entirf
Kern River Field. We can furnish a hundred companies with proven
land to drill on. We have land enough to support two or three fious
and wells. We have good rigs and are hard at work. We are offer
ing you a little of our fully paid, non-assessable treasury nock ar a
very low price, in order to get money to drill more wells. This
money will not be wasted, paid out in salaries or overhead expenses.
It will all go into the ground in actual, scientific, experienced drilling.
When the Lake Arthur Oil Company had secured seven deep watei
wells that could be quickly and cheaply deepened into the oil measures
underlying the cap rock, each one surrounded by lease holds of 1.000
to 2.000 acres, we purchased three complete oil drilling rigs and went
to work. Our first and almost only thought was to bring in an oil well.
And this we have done.
There are many people who do XOT make any money in oiL Somt
are-too busy to bother with it. They have to fix t!je back fence am
hoe the weeds out of a row of cabbaee. Some do not believe that
we have oil there until it is too late tc get in on the ground floor. K
the streets were paved with $20 gold pieces, lots of men would only

happen on the gold lined beach of Nome. Alaska.
