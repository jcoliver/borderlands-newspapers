PEACE BILL IS
VOTED DOWN IN
BRITISH HOUSE
Proposal Is Defeated by Vote
of 143 to 19 in House of
Commons M ichaelis'
Speech Again Condemned.
L
(By Review Leased Wire.)
ONDON, July 26. The house of
commons, after employing the
whole evening session in. a dis
cussion of a pt'ace resolution
moved by James Ramsey Mac Donald,
socialist and labor member, defeated
it by a vote of 148 to 19. The an
nouncement of the figures was receiv
ed with some cheers and much laugh
ter. The conviction was voiced by
Herbert H. Asquith, the former pre
mier, that nothing was to be hoped
from the present temper of the Ger
man reichstag and people.
George James Wardle, in behalf of
the labor party, declined to have any
thing to do with this pacifist resolu
tion. The speech of Andrew Bonar-Law,
the government leader in the house,
dealt largely with the Russian crisis.
He was certain that if anything could
delay peace it would be any sign of
faltering. """,r
Phillip Snowden, socialist, said the
debate disclosed that the British gov
ernment, more than any other bellig
erent, was standing in the way of an
early settlement. He said he protest
ed against more blood being shed to
restore Alsace-Lorraine to France.
The resolution declared that the
German reichstag resolution favoring
peace by an understanding, expressed
the principles for which Great Britain
stood throughout, and called on the
government, in conjunction with the
entfnte allies, to hesitate their peace
terms 'accordingly. Further, the reso
lution declared that the allies should
accept the Russian proposal that the
forthcoming allied conference on their
war aims should compromise repre
sentatives for the people and not
merely spokesmen for the government.
Mr. Snowden agreed that his opin
ion was that of only a small minority
but he contended that this minority
was ever growing.
Sharks P. Trevelyan, who seconded
the resolution, agreed in condemning
the uncertainty in the speech of the
German chancellor, Dr. Michaelis, and
said that they were all agreed that
peace awaited the restoration of Bel
gium and France, without any eco
nomic or other conditions. He also
doubted whether there could be peace
until all the governments clearly and
expressly repudiated the ideal of con
quest or annexations. It was the du
ty of the house of commons to reply
to the reichstag resolution, he said.
Prepare Now for Next
Emergency Is Advice
Of Colonel Roosevelt
P
ITTSBURG, July 26. Prepare
for the next national emer
enj;.t by introducing the
the principle of obligatory.
universal military training for
young men in time of peace and
universal service in time of war
for every man and woman in the
country, was the admonition deliv
ered by Theodore Roosevelt in an
address here tonight before the
Loyal Order of Moose.
As compared to the other great
nations of the world, he declared
Americans had in this war ex
hibited themselves a miracle of
inefficiency.
Asserting that the United States
government announces that the
preparedness now in progress is
temporary and will be stopped as
soon as the emergency is over,
Cblonel Roosevelt (characterized
this as a "criminal refusal to pro
vide for the future."
He summed up what America
had accomplished since the decla
ration of war with Germany by
saying that the United States did
not have a single airplane fit to
send across the German lines and
that months must pass before one
could be manufactured, that Amer
ica should have heavy artillery
and that Pershing and his soldiers
would have to trust to French and
English guns. American subma
rine chasers operating with the
British fleet, he said, constituted
only a tiny fraction of the Eng
lish force.
"We have not enough rifles for
our men," said Colonel Roosevelt.
"We are painfully short in equip
ment. We have not ye begun to
assemble the draft army, the first
elementary officers' training camps
have not been finished, the na
tional guard has just only begun
to mobilize.
"This is the sum total of the ac
tivities of our nation of 100,000.
000 and in possession of incalcul
able wealth and boundless resour
ces, during the six months follow
ing its entry (after two and one
half years warning) into the great
est war in history.
"The simple truth is that we
shall always be inefficient during
the first vital months of any war
until we learn to prepare in ad
vance. We have been caught ut
terly unprepared In a terrible
emergency because we did noth
ing until the emergency actually
arose, and now our government
announces that what we are do
ing we shall Btop doing as soon as
the emergency is over and will
then remain equally unprepared
for the next emergency.
"It is this blind refusal from
the nation's standpoint I can only
call it the criminal refusal to pro
vide for the future that forces
every honest and far-sighted lover
of America to speak."

Support the President Now,
Argue Later, Uncle Joe's Tip
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, July 26. While
senate and bouse conferees were be
ginning their work today on the long
delayed food control bill, sentiment
am'ong house Republicans crystallized
against further delaying enactment by
continuing Republican Leader Mann
fight for creation of a joint congres
sional committee on war expenditures.
Hope of getting the measure through
conference and ready for President
Wilson's signature next week was
brightened somewhat by the develop
ment but the leaders pointed out that
even with agitation of the war com
mittee amendment silenced in the
house, the senate remained on record
as favoring it and a fight was still pos
sible. The president has asked that
the provision be eliminated because
he believes it will only harass those
charged with conducting the war.
The conferees met twice today but
accomplished little.
Decision of the house Republicans
to take no further action at present
on the war expenditures committee
amendment was reached in a meeting
called by Mr. Mann.
Former Speaker Cannon urged un
divided support of the president now
and declared if it became apparent lat
er that a war expenditures committee
was needed it tOuld be created by sep
arate legislation.
NEW WAR BUDGET
MAY CALL FOR 8
BILLON
DOLLARS
War Department Estimates
Alone Call for Appropria
tions of $5,257,623,000
Other Figures Expected To
day.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, July 26. The new
war budget to carry the government
through to next July and to cover ad
ditional credits to the allies piOmises
to exceed eight billion dollars and may
amount to ten billion dollars.
War department estimates sent to
congress called for new appropriations
of $5,257,623,000 for that branch "of the
military alone. Estimates totalng an
other $1,000,000,000 or more are ex
pected tomorrow when the other de
partments report their needs and in
addition Secretary McAdoo has indicat
ed that before the year Is Out congress
will be asked for a $2,000,000,000 ap
propriation to increase the fund avail
able for loans abroad.
As soon as the departmental results
are in congress will go to work on
immediate budget measures which
probably will total In the neighbor
hood of $7,000,000,000.
How much of the new war expenses
should be raised by taxation and how
much by bonds or treasury indebted
ness certificates was a warmly debat
ed question. Committee sentiment to
night seemed to be In favor "of Increas
ing the $1,670,000,000 war tax bill only
to about $2,000,000,000 with authoriza
tion both for a new bond issue, prob
ably at a higher interest rate and in
serial form, and for issuance of treas
ury certificates of indebtedness.
Secretary McAdcO is said to favor
a much larger levy of taxes and a few
committee men favor increasing the
bill's total by about $1,000,000,000 or
at least to $2,225,000,000.

WASHINGTON, July 26. National
prohibition will be Voted on by the
senate next Wednesday. By unani
mous consent it was agreed tonight to
take up Monday Senator Sheppard's
resolution for a national prohibition
amendment to the constitution and to
dispose of it by Wednesday night
Foes of prohibition consented to the
vote in order to clear the resolution
from the calendar, transmit it to the
bouse and perhaps shift further agita
tion on the subject from congress to
the states. They secured an agree
ment however, for the addition of
proviso requiring the states to act
within six years on the constitutional
amendment if submitted to them.
The vote in the senate probably will
be extremely close. Adoption will re
quire two-thirds of the senators pres
ent. Senator Sheppard predicted to
night an affirmative vote of 65 or 66
votes, just enough to approve the res
olution, which would then go to the
bouse, subject to a similar two-thirds
vote.
The resolution provides that:
"The manufacture, sale or transpor
tation of intoxicating liquors, within
the importation thereof into or the ex
portation thereof from the United
States and all territory subject to the
jurisdiction thereof for beverage pur
poses are hereby prohibited. '
"The congress shall have power to
enforce this article by appropriate
legislation."
Senator Penrose, who recently has
objected to efforts to secure a vote
said tonight be would Ote and speak
against the resolution but had no de
sire to be obstructive. Senator Under
wood also announced that he was op
posed to the resolution.

WASHINGTON, July 26. Reports

army are eagerly awaited by Wash

the first definite information as to the
probable percentage of rejections to be

All available statistics indicate a
probable rejection of one in every

TOKIO, July 26. Klkujiro Ishii and
other Japanese, speaking authorita
tively, have laid stress on the point
that the forthcoming visit of the Ishii
mission to the United States has no
relation to the recent action of the
j American government in sending a
n'jte to China.
The mission is purely connected
with the operations of. the war, it l
explained.
Viscount Ishii probably will submit
to the Washington government Ja
pan's willingness and readiness to
substitute Japanese warships for
American naval force now in the Pa
cific ocean, including those making up
the Asiatic fleet with headquarters at
Manila. The underlying idea is that
Japan taking the protection of Ameri
can territory in the Pacific, the Amer
ican fleet would be free to transfer to
the Atlantic ocean where it would be
more useful.
The Japanese have claimed that
they have a special position in China
which is based on considerations of
racial similarity, , geographical prox
imity and economic apprcachment.
It is. recognized, however, that the
United States, free of foreign allian
ces, is in a totally different position
from England and France and that it
is a very great step to ask her to
abandon her prerogative of dealing di
rest with China and substitute a rec
ognition of Japan's paramount place
which would be coupled with a prac
tice of always consulting Japan.

BATAVIA, Netherlands East Indies.
July 26. Japan's commercial expan

petition is that she has begun the
manufacture of four-seated automo
biles bf 10 horsepower. The price is
said to be much lower than that of
American cars.
"Hires" Officer
To Murder Rival
(By Keview Leased Wire)
CHICAGO, July 26. Sidney H. Wal
ker, recently discharged dishonorably
from the navy at the age of 20 years,
tonight is incarcerated on a charge
of conspiracy to murder the husband
of Lucille Ender.
Walker was arrested after he had
unsuspectingly "hired" a police detec
tive to kill Ender for S15 and a prom
ise t J500 after the act ,had been
performed. He talked freely when
taken in custody, the burden of his
story being that "the woman did it."
He said Mrs. Ender told him it was
either her life or her husband's. Mrs.
Ender told the police after her arrest
that all this was the romantic ravings
of a youth who had evidently conceiv
ed the idea that she would receive a
large amount of money after the deal!:
of her husband.

county exemption board, announced
yesterday that no notice had yet been
received as to when the board shan
send out notice to the men drawn for

The list of names will be posted offi

not Those not asking exemption must
undergo a physical examination, for
instance, and defects might be found
which would bar them from service.

DEMOCRATS BUSY
PREPARING FOR
NEXT CAMPAIGN
Fred Coulter and Sidney P,
Osborn Seem to Be Certain
Candidates for Governor
W. A. Moore and G. W. P.
Hunt Dark Horses.
The race for the democratic nomlna
ticn for governor is on In earnest with
Fred T. Coulter, democratic national
committeeman and Sidney P. Osborn
in the lead according to Phpenlx ad
vices. W. A. Moeur, state land com
missioner, has announced that he is
not a candidate but he is the dark
horse who is bothering both Coulter
and Osborn, both of whom have al
ready made several tours of the state
in the Interest of their respective can
didacies.
Wiley Jones has been 'mentioned,
but It is believed that the attorney
general will be content to run again
for his old job.
There is a growing sentiment
among the democrats in favor of the
renomination of Former Governor G
W. P. Hunt. Those friends, who en
Joyed office under the governor, are
making a drive to him to "come back.'
They are telling him that he owes it
to himself to seek vindication at the
polls and restoration to the office "of
which he was robbed by the courts.'
That the former governor still has a
strong hold on the democratic party
and would make a formidable race for
the nomination, is generally admitted
by politicians on both sides at the
capital. It is believed that Osborn
will retire end run again for secretary
of state if Hunt gets back in the race
for governor. Coulter is in to stay
having already spent considerable
money on his campaign and opened
headquarters.
Some democrats are trying to per
suade Carl Hayden to rescue the par
ty. Hayden is turning a deaf ear to
their pleadings, having definitely de
termined to stand for congress again
next year and make the race for the
democratic nomination for the senate
in 1920.

in reducing the semi-annual dividend
from 2 to 2 per cent did not become
known until almost the close of the
day but occasioned no surprise.
St. Paul fell to 63. an extreme de
cline of 1 points on the news, but
immediately rallied, scoring a slight
net gain.
Other happenings of the day, such
as the sudden advance in refined cop
per, higher rates for rubles and con
tinuance, on a large scale, of the gold
overflow attracted little more than
passing attention.
Movements of stocks, except motors,
shippings and a few specialties were
extremely narrow.
Bonds were irregular, large blocks
of the Liberty issue changing hands
at 99.44 to 99.47. Total sales, (par
value), aggregated $2,980,000.
United States bonds were unchang

In provisions the outcome was a
net gain of 5 to 12 15.
Uneasiness regarding excessively
dry weather in the southwest, togeth
er with generally unfavorable crop re
ports from there, forced many corn
shorts to cover. On the ensuing re
turn offerings broadened out Final
transactions were virtually at the top
point of the day.
Need of soaking rains for the spring
wheat crop In the northwest, especi
ally North Dakota and Western South
Dakota, acted as more than a counter
balance for beneficial southwestern
crop reports.
The market was bullishly affected
also by the fact that winter wheat re
ceipts were as yet not half as large as
a year ago. Oats tightened up with
corn. Belated shorts in the July op
tion were compelled to bid sharply
against higher prices to escape the
squeeze.
Provisions responded to the
strength of corn. Higher quotations
on hogs tended further to lift the
market.

RUSSIA.
Never In all the history of Russia as a nation have
her soldiers under arms behaved so disgracefully as they
are doing at this time. Never a brilliant or a daring sol
dier, the Russian has always been a brave one in his
dogged and plodding way. Back in the days of Peter
the Great when Sweden was a world power under George
XII, a military genius of the first order, the Russians
were defeated time and unain and driven back with great
slaughter. Tie very existence of Russia was threatened
by the victorious Charles. But in the end the Russian
fortitude and staying powers prevailed and Sweden was
crushed forever at Pultowa.
All through the centuries of her existence Russia
has been at war. She has never won a spectacular vic
tory or triumphed in a daring campaign. Ability to stand
punishment and come back for more has been her main
asset in war. Her place as one of the world's great
powers was builded upon this foundation alone. Her
soldiers have always been steady and stubborn and
stupid. Always they have reached the empire's goal
through defeat. They have worn their enemies out and
then had enough left to deliver the final blow.
Most notable of all these cases was that of the wars
with Napoleon. The great French emperor destroyed the
Russian army at Austerlitz. Later he hammered the
remnants of this army and a fresh one to pieces in sev
eral smaller battles. The Russian soldiers fought brave
ly in every encoUfiter bu,t ajways with mUfortune.
When Napoleon led his invincible armies into Russia
he was opposed at Borodino in one of the most stubborn
battles of that century. The Russians fought here with
the courage of despair. Their infantry regiments simply
refused to yield. Napoleon himself grew sick of the
slaughter and ordered a bayonet charge to disperse these
determined grenadiers. Suffering a loss of fifty per cent
of their forces, the Russians fought on while in retreat.
Later, in the Russo-Japanese war, although beaten
the Russians were not disgraced. At Port Arthur, Muk
en and on the Yalu they fought like brave men long and
well.
During the first two years of this war the soldiers of
the czar, poorly squipped and outclassed in artillery and
reserves of ammunitioa, fought with stubborn courage, j
They wop great victories over the Austrians and, al
though beaten always by the Germans, they offered de
termined resistance in retreat.
Then came the revolution. Liberty, the cherished and
priceless heritage of every free man and the beautiful
dream of every slave, came at last to the poor Russian.
And while the democracy of the world rejoiced at this
miracle, this benefaction, the Russian himself became
drunken and debauched from the intoxicating draught.
He was no more fit for it than a child, an animal, an un
reasoning being. He listened to the wild ravings of ev
ery agitator, anarchist and outcast that stood on a street
corner and proceeded to overthrow authority and defy
discipline and cast organization to the winds. .
Germany flooded the distraught country with spies
and agents. Riot, rebellion and rapine held sway. , Then
the big men of the country began to come to the front
and, struggling on the brink, Russia was just beginning
to find herself when the army cracked like a rotten
stick.
In the light of every reason, argument, theory and
condition, this sudden weakness and cowardice of soldiers
who have four centuries of stubborn, unyielding bravery
behind them, is inexplicable. The Russian bear that
walks like a man, who can fathom him? Who can under
stand him? Having his habitation on the borderline
between the Occident and the orient he displays the char
acteristics of both Shera and Japhet, and yet he is the
mystery of the ages. He is the uncertain quantity of the
Great War. If he will do his part the Prussian will be
crushed within a year. If be does not, it will require two
years at least.
But the present cowardice and utter panic of the
Russian armies upsets all calculations and conjectures.
AI! precedent of this ctrange in and out nation havu
been shattered. Never in the worst period of her servi
tude was Russia in such a pltghl as today. While there
is courage there is always hope, but when courage is
gone either there must be a miracle or dark plumes aul
the crash of gravel upon the coffin of the dead.
BISBEE SYSTEM THE BEST.
(From Skilling's Mining Review, Duluth.)
The Bisbee system of eliminating the I. W. W. may
seem rather rude to some sympathetic people but it posi
tively is the only way of getting rid of their evil influence.
The L W. W. constitute a severe disease and it requires
a sharp remedy. Legitimate labor unions are a recog
nized institution, and unorganized bodies of men can get
a hearing if they have grievances, but there is no em
ployer that will for a moment allow the I. W. W. to tell
him what to do.
No doubt many ignorant and misguided men are
attracted to the L W. W. standard. The agitators promise
large but with no intention of meeting their obligations.
It should be plain to every serious-minded person that
the red flag organization must be suppressed. The agi
tators should be sent into exile and. kept there as dan
gerous citizens. The Bisbee system of simply assem
bling the red flag followers and railroading them out of
the camp is well enough to bring temporary peace, but as
long as these agitators are allowed to run whizzers else
where there can be no permanent general relief. They
are born plotters and the square deal means nothing to
them. Intimidation is their sole weapon. If they bring
hunger into the homes of honest industrious workers it
means nothing to the I. W. W. Minnesota and Michigan
know them like a book. An Arizona paper speaks of the
I. W. W. as a mysterious organization. That is a mis
take. There is nothing mysterious about it. True, they
work in the dark, in secret, but their principles are pro
claimed from the housetops, and they stand for confisca
tion of property and violence, and everything "that is
un-American and un patriotic. The Bisbee system is the
best remedy thus far evolved of dealing with this un
scrupulous element.

REFUSED TO BELIEVE IT.
A Review subscriber in Ray writes to call attention
to seme of the silly and malicious lies that have been
printed in certain coast papers regarding alleged arts of
brutality committed in Bisbee the morning of the Wobbly
Drive. Most of them were circulated by a certain woman
whose husband was deported. This subscriber declares
that he lived inthe Warren district for twenty years and
helped in its development. "I know the Bisbee people,"
writes this loyal ex-Bisbec- man, "and I cannot believe a
word about all this brutality practiced against women and
children. I cannot let such statements go unchallenged,
and I am sending you clippings in the hope that you will
answer them." The stories are too absurd to be digni
fied by & denial. Not even the wobblies themselves were
mistreated, even when they insulted the deputies. Only
where they resisted were they subjected to violence.
Their wives and children were treated with most humane
kindness then and now.
AN OLD AND VALUED SUBSCRIBER.
From J. C. Gildea, of Phoenix, comes word that warms
the editor's heart. Mr. Gildea writes to ask that his pa
per be forwarded to a coast resort in Rhode Island where
he ia going to spend the summer season. "I cannot, get
along without the Review, even for a few weeks," writes
this loyal friend. Mr. Gildea has been a constant sub
scriber of the Review for over ten years.
That wise, practical, broad-gauge old banker, Henry
Clews, of New York, writes hopefully of the situation
despite many uncertainties. He points out how the Great
War has revolutionized most thing3 and created a cer
tain degree of uncertainty in everything. But still, he
declares conditions look good right now. This nation is
loaning billions and raising billions for her own war ex
penses. High seas shipping is threatened and harassed
by the submarine. Our railroads are taxed to the utter
most. Old political issues have been swept away and
new ones arise daily. Business methods are changing
and markets rise and fall with bewildering rapidity. Cut
on the other hand, crops promise a fine yield this year
and prices will be high. The demand for labor is un
precedented. Mr. Clews winds up his remarkable public
statement with the following wise and brave words:
"There is no reason for taking other than hopeful views
regarding the future, but the presence of many and un
usual uncertainties necessitate the policy of daily caution."

Last month a bill was introduced in congress to

It is to start from Seattle, descend to Salt Lake and

not a bad expression. Before the war, as every ono

and progress. Now it stands for diabolical and frightful
things. Holding cities for ransom, wholesale murder of

To All Deputies
I want to impress upon each dep
uty sheriff the absolute necessity
for extreme self-control, cool, calm
judgment and patience. Avoid all
display of weapons. Remember,
you are deputized for protection of
self and property and the mainten
ance of peace. You are subject to
my call, a call which will be made
when necessary.
Let no act of yours tend to de
feat the object for which you were
ioputized, namely the preservation
Df peace. I hold each man respon
sible for any illegal act or excess of
his authority and this applies to ev
;ry man in this district.
