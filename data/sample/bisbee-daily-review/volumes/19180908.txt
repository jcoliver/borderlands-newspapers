UNDATED WAR LEAD (BY THE ASSOCIATED PRESS. Marshal
Foch's succession of hammer blows along the German lines from Rheims to
Arras since July 18 have well nigh completely flattened out the bulge
created by th German offensives.
The well co-ordinated progress of his attack has brought him to a point
where he may well be able to strike a still more disastrous blow to the
German defensive system.
From Laon to Canibrai the Hindenburg line stood all last year In the
way of the allied armies seeking to drive back the enemy from northern
France and Flanders. Little impression was made in that line except tem
porarily in General Byng's drive below Canibrai last fall. Already in this
summer's campaign the line hag been pierced on a wide front along its
northerly stretches by the British and within the past few hours it has
been penetrated in its southerly reaches by the French.
i orvnooro that Marshal Fnrh'a nlnn mav nrove to Involve the turning
ai ni'H1'1' v ....-.-. r j - - -
of the line on both its flanks at Cambrai and Laon. In the north the Bri
tish have been for several dhyg in a position to deliver what might
easily prove a vital stroke to the west of Cambrai where they have halted
at the canal Du Nord and made no move toward driving home the blow
which the logic of the situation points to as inevitable.
In the south the armies of General Petain have now fought their way
to positions where the left flank of the line is under their guns and the
edge of the defensive positions are beginning to feel the effect of the
pounding.
On the western outskirts of the bas-1
tion of St. Gobain, defending Laon,
the French already at Barisis, are in I
advance of the line they occupied in .
1917 and further south below the main
bastion, are standing on ground which ;
had not been in allied hands since
it'll. r ui viici uui ui wiv-j j
La Fere whence an eastward drive
would carry them north of the St.
Gobian massif.
i The French drive seems clearly
aimed at this massif which, apparent
ly safe from capture by a frontal at
tack, seems hot unlikely to prove the
objective of an encircling movement.
This may hare to await the further
retirement of the Germans from the
Aisne. A retirement is regarded as
inevitable because of the allied posi
tion on the German left flank from
the Aisne at Conde to Vauvallon.
Some military critics argue that the
Germans here will not be permitted
to halt even at the Cbemin Des
Barnes position but the enemy will
be forced to retreat still further
north, thus additionally exposing Laon
on the east.
The allied unified command makes
it certain the expected drives at the
vital points on both the north, in the
Cambrai sector, and in the south,
around the Laon positions, will Tie so
co-ordinated as to insure the maxi
mum result.
The process of closing in
toward
the Hindenburg line at the points
where it had not yet been reached,
was continued rapidly yesterday by
both the French and British. The Bri
tish moved forward at an accelerated j
pace below the Cambrai-Peronne front
and on that front itself they already I
are close to the line. South of the
Somme the French pressed on beyond i
Tergnier and moved up steadily along i
all the line opposite the front between i
La Fere and St. Quentin. j
On the Aisne, there was little
change towards the western part of
the front, where the Americans and
French are on the river, facing the i
Germans entrenched along the canal
which parallels the stream. Further
east the Germans are giving up
ground. The angle formed by the line
trending off southeastward toward
Rheims, offered stiff opposition to the
Franco-Americans near Roman, be
tween Revillon and Montigny-Sur-Vesle.
In Flanders, the British made some
further headway but found the Ger
man resistance stiffening around La
bassee. The Germans apparently do
not intend to give up Armentieres in

WITH THE FRENCH ARM Y
IN FRANCE, Sept. 6. Friday. (By
the Associated Press.) General
Mangin's troops reached the Hin
denburg line at sevei-al points
during today's fighting. They
took Liffaux and Prtit Barisis and
drove near to .VauxaiUon. while
extending their hold on the Aisne
as-far as St. Mard. The enemy
shell fire became more intense as
the French troops advanced and
the resistance of the infantry
grew stronger.
Tho adversaries were face to
face this afternoon near Quincy
Baslsee in the same positions
they occupied respectively for
about a year before the German
drive this spring.
Notwithstanding the wastage and
fatigue among the .enemy's troope and
the splendid ardor ol the French in
fantry the task the latter forces are
now facing is arduous The Germans
occupy positions of .naturaL strength
which they have reinforced. The re
gion of the St. Gobian forest is not
only a natural fortress but is favor
able to the enemy's retreat tactics.
The hills, gullies and thickets sup
ply an excellent camouflage for trtll
lery and machine gun nests.
The heights are honeycombed with
stone quarries that otfer all the ad
vantages of vast, solid rock shelters
where whole battalions may find cov
er from the heaviest artillery fire.
When the Germans retired to this
line in 1917 they had not prepared
their positions. They counted upon
the vast area of land laid waste in
front of them, however, to make an at
tack upon the bastion more difficult.
Sou'h of the Aisne at St. Mard the
French troops this afternoon were ap
proaching the junction cf the river
and the Olse-Aisne canal, this seeming
to be the line chosen by the enemy
for his resistance in that region.
YANKS CLEAR WOOD
WITH THE AMERICA NARMY ON
THE AISNE FRONT. Sept. 7. (By the
Associated Press.) The attempt of
the Germans to retain their foothold
on the south side of the Aisne canal
in a wood to the west cf Villers-En-Prayerers
was nullified by' a small,
but brilliant operation early this
morning. The dene little wood hav
been parked with machine guns, un
der cover of the German guns.
The only break in the American line
alcng the ranal was at that place. The
task of clearing out bean at 4 o'clock
a. m. and was completed before 10.
There was nc opportunity to take
prisoners but the toll of German dead
was great as compared with the mag
nitude of the engagement.
Along the line to the -met ion wi:h

At the Front in France, July 4,
1918.
Today is the Fourth of July and
wo in France heard the splash of the
ships that were launched in Amer
ica today, and we are all glad.
I have been in the front line
trenches for five days. The communi
cation lines became tangled up and
was detached from the Radio com
pany and sent forward to take com
mand of the platoons from the Out
post company which is with the in
fantry to straighten things out. It
took us just five days. Finished
this morning and turned it over in
excellent shape. Came out to Brig
ade headquarters and hurried to the
Division headquarters for a change
of clothes and a cleanup.
When I arrived here I found six
letters. I was certainly glad to get
them. Many times I go without
meals and Bmoke and I don't mind
that, but when my letter rations
fall short I get lonesome.
I will tell you what the French
have done for us today, the 4th.
Captain Fitch and myself are in the
same room. The dear bid madam
here placed a large bouquet of roses
in our room, red and white roses
tide with a blue ribbon. Outside of
the window hang three flags, the
stars and stripes in the center and
the French tricolor on either side,
while out in the front of the house
flowers were arranger on the ground
to make out the words "Viva Amer
lque." The captain and I went down to
thank her and the poor old soul's
yes filled with tears(as she mention
ed that three of her boys lie buried
somewhere near the trenches in
France and her only daughter, a
little girl og eight, was killed by
the Huns' bombardment. God help
those dirty German dogs. Our men
are certainly sore at them. They
have shown no mercy and they will
get none from us.

has made us all feel good over here.
The tide is slowly turning against

think of what we came over here for
I can only realize that before I re
turn to America1 that the Germans
have- got to be whipped. So I am
satisfied, especially when I know
that the folks at home are behind
me.
I am due for a vacation today but
the men need my help more than I
need a vacation so I am going to
stay with them.
We are working hard over here.
I have done many men's work in the
last five days.
The more one travels around in
the trenches the more human one
becomes. I use my excess change
for keeping- my men supplied with
tobacco and cigarettes, matches, etc.
Men depend upon their officers so
much it is like a famil yand I am as
good to them as discipline will per

UNUSUAL RECORDS MADE
BY VETERAN DRIVERS
ON THEGRAND CIRCUIT
(By Review Leaned Wire)
CLEVELAND, O., Sept. 7 Two un
usual records are being made on the
grand circuit this year by Thomas W.
Murphy and Edward F. -Pop" Geers,
veterans of the harness turf. They are
not speed records, but driving records.
Murphy is well on his way toward
establishing a new world's record for
the number of races won in a season.
With the close of the meeting at
Poughkeepsie, August 23, Murphy was
within feven winning races of the
present 'world's record of forty-seven
victories made by Horace Tyson in
1915.

of the Bisbee-Douglas community
board, that Joseph Lord, representa

of labor, speakers' bureau, will speak
at Bisbee, Thursday, September 12, on
the national labor and industrial pro

U. S. department of labor, also has
been received by R. J. Wilbert, local
member of the community board, with
the additional request that Mr. Wil

local citizen to preside at the meet
ing. The meetings, place for which has
not yet been designated, will be for
the public. Mr. Lohd is said to have
a "message for organized and unorga
nized labor and for the employers."
The notificathion of the event says:
Mr. Lord has a message for all the
people, whether employer or workers
and his purpose is to create a better
understanding between all the forces
of industry. ,
"His audiences should not be com
posed of any one class, but of all
classes, the master of industry and
the toiler of industry may both profit
from the patriotic message that he
brings from our national government,
urging Industrial peace and mutual un
derstanding to the end that every
ounce of man-power and all our na
tional resources be utilized for the
speedy winning of the war.
"Following Mr. Lord's address In
Bisbee on the 12th, he will remain
there for four or five days speaking
at such places in the district as you
may arrange for him. One of the
places you arrange should be Doug
las. I would like to see big audi

CROWDER'S PLANS FOR
LOCAL DRAFT BOARDS
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 7. Proovst
Marshal General Crowder Is planning
the enlargement of local draft boards
wherever necessary in order that
some of the men who register nest
Thursday may be inducted into mili
tary service in October.
General Crowder has telegraphed
draft executtves in every state ask
ing If an increase in the personnel
would expedite work. Additional reg
istrars have already been authorized
for September 12.
Employers or dependents of regis
tered men who. for patriotic reasons,
may object to entering a claim for de
ferred classification on the grounds
of dependency or the nature of their
occupation, will expedite proceedings
and prevent Injustice by making the
exemptions claims for the men, it was
said today at the provost marshal gen
eral's office. There is a form for such
claims in the : questionnaire, it -was
pointed out, and local boards will find
their duties more complicated if reg
istrants enUtled to exemption do not
claim it or some interested persons
does not muke the claim in their be
half. Details in the appointment of advis
ory committees to each of the district
draft boards to assist the boards in
passing upon exemptions claimed on
occupational grounds were discussed
today at conference between represen
tatives of the provost marshal gen

board and the department of labor.
Draft boards will name one of the

Fine Letter Received From
Local Man Now in France
Bassett Watklns, secretary of the
Perfect Ashlar lodge of Masons in this

General Pershing. Mr. Liadholm was

the railroad company at Nacoaud is
a member of the local lodge of .Masons
and has a number of friends in the
district who will be glad to hear that
he is making good. Lindholm enlist
ed a year ago last August and was
sent east and has been moving right
along since. The letter is filled with
excellent sentiments and is one of
the test that has been received in the
district. It is printed in full as fol
lows (there was not a line or a letter
in the Jftter censored):
"Dear Brother:
"Your most welcomed letter of Ju:
4th reached me yesterday and need
less to say I was very glad to hear
from you.
"I can assure you that we in France
all appreciate the splendid support
that we are being given from all sides
by those who are at home. With
such unity and co-operation there can
be but one end to this tremendous
war and that absolute and complete
victory for the allies. The unjust
cause of Germany and her brutality
and frightfulness cannot survive
where the destinies of all nations and
peoples, under a just God, are at is
sue. We all know that ours is a just
and righteous cause and our own free
dom, as well as that of all nations,
especially the weak nations, is at
stake. Iu a military way Germany
has been able to conquer a great deal
of territory, but time will prove that
it Is but a temporary gain because
we have now reached the turning
point from now on we will see
brighter and brighter days ahead of
us until the victorious end when
there will be peace and good will
again throughout the earth. Our army,
with high morals and standards and
fighting for true ideals of freedom,
CANNOT be stopped by the degener
ate Huns who have caused such ter
rible suffering and, sorrow throughout
the length and breadth of the earth.
Oar commander In chief. Gen. John J.
Pershing, commands the highest re
spect and implicit confidence of every
soldier under his command in France,
as well as that of all our allies. He
is a leader in, whom we place our faith
and trust. When this war is all over
this will be a better world for it
seems that only through suffering and
sacrifice can we appreciate the real
Issues to this life and learn to live up
to the teachings of our Saviour and
the laws of our God in heaven.
"We are very, ' very jubilant and
happy over our recent successes and
the excellent progress being made at
the present time. Our allies from all
sides are showering our soldiers with
the highest of praise for their splen
did initiative and remarkable prowess
in action. The unquestionable fighting
qualities of the Americans has been a
great surprise to pur allies and the
"pep" ihlch we have shown in action
had engendered a new spirit in the
French and English such as they have
not known since the early days of the
war. From now on it looks very
much like there will be no rest for
the Huns until victory and peace over
takes us. America can well be proud
of her soldiers who are making a rec
ord , that will stand" throughout the
ages as fitting testimonial of the qual
ities and worth of tree men from a
land Ot liberty, and Independence. Lit
tle respect did the Huns have for our
"contemptible little army" as they
termed it. but the . poor misguided
fools, through bitter defeat, will learn
the' meaning of truth and righteousness.-
Out soldiers iu France, backed
by the support of those at home, are
running the Huns ragged. I am proud
td say that the Americans are making
the sacrifices of war that .the Huns
never dreamed we would make. They
thought we would dilly-dally along
and make no greater effort than to
supply our allies with food and muni
tions. America today is thrilled with
. the same spirit of independence that
was manifested by our forefathers in
the early days of the Revolution and
our soldiers are living up to the tra
ditions of those perserving minute
men who placed their trust in God
, and made our Independence pos
! sible.

Thi Primary Election
Laon!
Next Tuesday the voters of Arizona will
select their primary candidates for office
Except in a few instances the primary cam
paign has been rather free from bitterness.
The interest has been marked, in spite of
the war. The great issue of the primary
appears to be whether or not the democrats
will endorse the old Hunt machine or cast
it out as a drawback to the state's progress,
patriotism and prosperity. Colter, demo
cratic candidate for governor seems to be
the favorite of the machine and the more
extreme of the radicals of the state. Osborn
has sought to stand betwix and between.
He spoke right out on the I. W. W." issue
and has not publicly catered to Hunt and
his crowd to any extent, although generally
accepted as at least having been one of
them in the past. Judge Sutter of Cochise
has been the out and out conservative and
anti-Hunt candidate from the start and he
has never tried to dodge the issue. He has
made a most remarkable campaign and won
many votes by his earnestness, his frank
ness, his sincerity and his forceful logic.
That he has gained in strength from the
very beginning of his active candidacy is a
fact beyond argument or doubt. His
chances of winning the nomination appear
to be excellent. He is. the war candidate,
the progressive candidate and the safe and
sane candidate, commanding the work- .
men's vote because he was once himself
a workman in the copper mines, and the
business man's and the property owner's
vote because of his force of character and
ability. It will be a hard, close race, with
the result probably in doubt until a greater
part of the returns are in and tabulated.
In Cochise county there are many candi
dates for county and legislative offices with
several hot contests and plenty of interest.
And in, the case of all candidates, state and
county, the Review has urged all along, and
does still most earnestly urge, the voters to
consider carefully their ballot. This is not
a time to allow partisanship or feud or pre
judice or class hatred influence the judg
ment. Consider the man and his record,
his standing, his ability, his broadminded
ness, his patriotism, his fitness for place of
trust and responsibility. The state as a
whole suffers when the radical enters public
office. The little man, warped and guided
by his hatreds in campaign and in private
life, is influenced by them still when he en
ters public office. And the state suffers.
Her progress is impeded; her standing be
fore the nation lessened. ' The same is true
of the county. Pick only broad, strong,
well balanced, successful men to represent
you in the legislature. Be doubly sure of
your board of supervisors. They handle
your county business. Elect successful and
energetic and capable men for these im
portant places. The talker and the hater
and the blcwhard may make a good show
ing in the campaign but he i3 a misfit and a
failure in the administration of real affairs.
The Review has neither assailed nor boost
ed any particular landidate in this primary.
It has sought merely to give publicity to the
claims and records of all candidates who
have stood strongly for the progress and
general welfare of their community and
state. It ha3 fought I. W. Wism straight
from the shoulder and it has always opposed
the radicals and the extremists who place
their own bitter feelings and narrow pre
judices and restricted viewpoint above the
general public good and the national wel
fare. It laments the I. W. V. taint of
sympathy at least that clings still to the
Hunt machine and all its works. It seeks
earnestly and sincerely and wholehearted
ly for the nomination of men who are
looking and working for the future good
and prosperity and solid progress of the
state in all things. The war is wiping pre
judice and feuds and hatreds and misunder
standings of class and party and condition
away from all rninds that are open and
thoughtful and fair. Let us turn away from
a pat of strife and petty bitterness and
peanut politics and venom and vaporings
nr.d from the men who deal in these things
as their entire stock in trade and look to
a future that is bright and broad and fair
"The Americans now can see the towers
of the Laon cathedral." reads special dis
patch from the French front. Grand words !
Full of great promise and radiant splendor.
The towers of Laon, the bulwark of the
German lines in France. Last year the
French, after taking the Chemin des Dames
tried in vain to compass the fall of Laon.
Manjr thousands of gallant French soldiers
died all in vain on the slopes that lead up
to Laon. They stormed forward as far as
Malmaison and were holding this place pre
cariously when the big German drive be
gan last spring. And now they are com
ing back again towards Laon, these French,
. and with them are lean, bronzed, eager
men from across the seas. They see the
cathedral spires and towers of Laon. How
they glitter in the sunlight above the smoke
and murk of battle! Towers of faith stand
ing still against German hate and destruc
tion. How they beckon, these stately
towers cf the church of Christ, beckon for
the gallant men of the oldest and the young
est of the races of the western world to
some and free them from the defilement of
the base torch of barbarous and sin-cursed
men. And they shall be free. Laon shall
again be French and the Marseilles shall
again peal forth from the nave of her fam
ous cathedral and its towers shall again fly
the tricolor of France. Maybe not soon.,
but surely not far distant. Those Ameri
can soldiers who gaze today from behind
the fringe of Coucy forest at Laon towers
will never turn back without-the guidon of
victory. Their eye3 have seen the glory of
the -sunlight flashing on the spires of Laon
and the light is quenchless and it leads
them on and ever on. And behind them
come countless more soldiers frcm out the
west and their heads are held high and their
caze is fixed eastward towards Laon and
beyond Laon to other spires. Alwavs cast
ward towards the aerie of the black eagle
who desecrated Lon and hundreds of other
beautiful cities of a free land. It is a radi
ant sign set in the sky, this vision of the
towers of Laon just before the onsweeping
American battle line.

The Battle Crisis
Foch, while pressing the enemy all along
the southern edge of the battle line and tak
ing important ground east of Peronne and
Noyon and fighting hard northeast of Sois
sons, seems to be marking time with his
British armies since last Tuesday astride the
Arras-Cambrai road and up to the canal du
Nord, just northwest of Cambrai. The Brit
ish have stopped dead at this point since
their grand victory of Monday. They have
made no attack nor have they been at
tacked. They are in a position from which
the vital blow of the wax may well be struck
at the German defenses in France. The
logic of the situation points plainly to an
immediate and mighty blow here. At this
point and at this time the crisis of the en
tire campaign since July 1 8 rest3. Here is
the German's danger point. His rout of
last Monday in this sector marked the low
est German morale of the war. Foch knows
better than any one in the world when and
where and how hard to strike. But every
one who is following the war closely is
paying but little attention to any other
point in the battle line, while they hope and
pray for another British blow towards Cam
brai along the Arras-Cambrai road. There
will the German disaster occur, if disaster
there is to be this year.

More Concerning
Larl nay den ,a,r,y at the ep
What does Osborn, candidate for gov
ernor of all the state, mean by an adver
tisement that appeared yesterday in a Phoe
nix paper and read as follows? "Maricopa's
native son, Sidney P. Osborn, was born and
raised in this county; he "knows her needs,
he believes in her future; if you believe that
Maricopa county is big enough and import
ant enough to elect the governor of Ari
zona, vote for Osborn." Where does the
rest of the state come in. Does Osborn be
lieve only in Maricopa county? Does he
know only and care only of her needs?
What is the idea? Where does Cochise,
the biggest taxpayer of the state, come in?
There is entirely too much Maricopa and
too little of Arizona in this advertisement
and appeal for votes to suit the average
citizen and taxpayer living beyond the pre
cincts of the state capital.

May I lend you some?
When the draft bill passed, was

posed on Hayden the citizen and law

He had had his privilege opposing

Whether it as confidence of cause

This Is not a time for adherence to

Is there not in Arizona a well

DENTISTS MUST NOT
PULL SLACKERS' TEETH
If there pre any men in the Warrtn
District who have an Idea that they
can gain exemption from the provi
sions of the selective draft by having
their teeth yanked out, they will either
have to do the extracting themselves
or get a blacksmith to do the work.
The war department has issued a
warning to dentiests to let the teeth
of slackers alone. This order, issued
by Provost Marshal General Crowden,
says:
"The department of Justice has
turned over to this office Information
which it has received tending to show
that registrants in certain localities,
desiring to avoid military service, have
sought t have teeth extracted so as
to render them eligible to physical
disqualitioation. A dentist in New
York state advises that several would
be slackers have approached him with
requests to have teenth extracted for
this purpose.
"This office desires to warn all den
tists against permitting themselves to
be a party to practices of this sort,
and to call attention to the fact that
severe penalties are provided in the
law for any person conspiring to tld
another to avoid the draft."

Inguries Are j
Probaably Fatal
Tom Compton, a miner employea
at the Lowell shaft of the Copper
Queen company, was caught in a
cave-In about 10 o'clock yesterday
morning and sustained injuries that
will probably be fatal. He was work
ing on one of the lower levels when
suddenly the ground gave away in
which he was working and he was
caught by the fall and his back in
jured and also injured internally. He
was rescued from the accident and
taken to the hospital as soon as pos
sible. A report from the hospital late
last night was to the effect that ther
was not much hope held out for his
recovery, as it had been definitely de
termined that his back had been In
jured, probably broken and that he
was injured internally.
Compton came here a short tinie
ago from Whitelaud, Texas, and se
cured work at tho Lowell shaft. He
is a cousin of Rev. Compton. He has
a wife and four small children at
Whiteland. He had just sent fcr them
yesterday. They were advised of his
condition.
RHODES PRESENTED
WITH HANDSOME PIN
When Omar Rhodes, the Copper !
Queen machinist, started to leave the
district yesterday after twelve years
of work and play and joy and sorrow
in this district, he found his fellow
workmen of the Queen machinist
force laying for him to the last man
with Master Vechanic Alvin in com
mand. They got him In the shop yes
terday morning at 9 o'clock and
gave him a handsome diamond stick
pin, Alvln making the presentation.
Twelve years in the district, a good
man, many friends, all sorry to see
him go, that is the record Rhodes has
made here. Mr. and Mrs. Rhodes left
on the noon train for the east where
they expect to make their home in
Arkansas in the future. , !
AT THE CENTRAL
William Farnum, the favorite Fox
star, has another pictorial treat for 1
the movie-loving public in his latest
film entitled 'True Blue," which is
showing at the Central theater today.
This photodrama has all the ele
ments which go to make a popular
William Farnum play. The hero is a
red-bloodeds westerner, strong of mind
and body. He faces not merely physi
cal dangers, but those insidious temp-'
tations which tend to make .even a
strong man weak.
Baby Bond Sales

The amount of sales of war savings
stamps and baby bonds in the Warren
district continues to climb upward

Dealer that His Request
Will Not Exceed Limit of
Two Pounds Per Person
(By Review Leased Wire)
FLAGSTAFF, Ariz., Sept. 7. Coin
cident with the abolition of the card
system for rationing flour and bread
the rationing of sugar by card can no
longer be used in Arizona, it was au
thoritatively announced at food ad
ministration headquarters here today.
The card system must be done away
with in its entirety. .
The limit of two pounds of sugar
per person per month is still in effect
but instead of the card system all
dealers are asked to adopt what is
known as the honor certificate plan,
in which the purchaser is required to
state on his honor that the two-pound
allowance will not be exceeded.
Under the new system the responsi
bility is placed squarely upon the
shoulders of the dealer and he is
counselled by the food administration
to take what steps are necessary to
guard against repeating and other
subterfuge. To this end he should re
fuse to sell sugar to new patrons un
less be is satisfied that they are bona
fide new residents of his community
and have not already bought all the
sugar they are entitled to from some
other dealer.
Unless he takes this stand, the deal
er will find himself ' long before the
end of the month without sufficient
sugar to supply his regular patrons.
The food administration issues certifi
cates to the dealers, manufacturing
- establishments and eating places, but
here the distribution ceases, and it Is
up to the merchant to secure the equ
itable distribution of sugar to his pa
trons through the honor certificate
plan.
Another Important change; in the
sugar regulations is that it is no long
er necessary to confine sales of sugar
to two pounds at a time. The custom
er is now allowed to purchase a
week's supply at a time, this practice
being aimed to lessen the burden of
the merchant in keeping check on
sales.
The honor certificates, with which
all merchants are asked to supply
themselves are of the following form:

The mending of streets and alloys,
the impro eim-nt ..of highways or in

brick, asphalt, oil, tar, crushed stone,
steel and also sand and gravel (where
shortage exists) as highway materi
als, and that application must be sub
mitted for approval through the state
highway department. Forms have
been prepared for this purpose and
furnished this department by the
council and upon request will be for
warded to those wishing to make ap
plication. The council directs that no manu
facturer shall furnish any road build
ing material until the project has been
approved by the tinted Suites high
ways council. The council also urges
that new highway and street con'
st ruction be confined to the most ee
scntial needs and that the less-essential,
projects be eliminated so Tar as
possible. They rank maintenance of
existing streets and highways first,
reconstruction second, and new con
struction third, in the following rela
tive order of importance:
. (1) Highways and streets of mili
tary importance.
(21 Highways end streets of na
tional economic value. ,' '
(31 Unfii.L-h.'.d contracts involv
ing cou.-truc-iJuu:;! obligations ( incur

portance, are of such extreme local
importance, or the construction of i
"which has progressed to such a point
as to cause a serious hardship if their,
construction or completion' is post-1
jioii?d. ;
In the sfpriirg of applications for ap-;
pi-val, the louncil asks that as far as j
practicable the application be made
by the officials in charge of proposed
highway work and not by the con-'
tractor; it is also urged that the an-j
plications be made out completely audi
that fu!J information be given as to !
the progress of the work already un-i
der way.
The United States highway council
has requested the American Associa
tion of State Highway Officials to as
sist them in gathering the necessary-;
data for next year's road work, and as '
w consider it our patriotic duty to do
all in our power to assist thpm and
the government during this period oi
national stress, the various highway
departments of the United States are
co-operating in every way possible
with the United States highway coun
cil with the view of meeting as far as
possible all their lequirements. The
highway departments of the various
states are requested by the United
Slates highways council to collect the
information from the counties, town
ships, or districts and cities. This in
formation should cover all work,
whether construction, reconstruction
or maintenance. It is urged by the
council that if ycu wish to receive the
necessary material, labor, etc., for
next season's work that these state
ments showing your requirements
must be filled out and filed with the
highway department of the state not
later than October first. We are en
closing herewith form HC4 upon
which you are requested to furnish a
statement of your anticipated require
ments. The council has asked this depart
ment to give as much publicity as pos
sible to these orders and to bring to
the attention of the administration all
known violations of order. As this in
formation has been requested by the
government we wish to impress upon
you the urgency of the work since it
is important that the United State3
highway council shouid be in position
to prepare their schedule of require
ments for next season's road work,
particularly on the four essentials,
supplies, cars, money, and labor.
If there is any further information
that we can give you on the subject
of advice and assistance that this de
partment can be of you, we want to
assure you that it will be a pleasure
for us to render you every possible
aid.
Trusting and feeling assured that

SUTTER SPEAKS AT
LOWELL TOMORROW
There is every evidence at present
that a crowd that will test the capac
ity of the Central theater will turn out
Monday night to hear Senator Fred
Sutter explain the issues of the cam
paign for the Democratic nomination
lor governor of Arizona. The speak
ing. will be preceded by a band concert
and v.ii; suit promptly at 8:15 o'clo"'t.
SmaLor i,iiir has just completed a
t-ur of the g '.ate. in the course of
vhic'i he tow hed every part of it. As
a re.-urr of his visit, he returns here
nr ia than ever confident that ira has
iho support of a heavy percentage or
the ptople, and that he will be suc
cessful in his candidacy."
His speeches leave nothing to be de
sired, so, far as plain, accurate staie
nir.uis of his position on all questions
of public moment are concerned. At
e outsst. Senator Sutter plainly de
fined his position on the 4I. W. 7.
;.r.d these of so-called "wobbly" ten
ancies. His Americanism is 100 per
cent pure.
With the Ianse recent accessions to
the Wairtn District Sutter club, there
can be no dorbt as to the enthusiasm
of his reception, as surrounding con
ditions plainly show that he :s the
favorite son of this district, as well
as be'.Og one of its long-time residents.

One of the most interesting and uni

ever portrayed is the part in "The
Turn of a Card," his second Paralta
release, which will play at the Eagle
theater last time today. Mr. Ker
rigan, a westerner, has just come east
after having accumulated a fortune
from his oil holdings. The daughter
of the former owner of his "shack", a
magnificent Long Island mansion, re
turns from the war zone, and, rather
than tell her that her father is penni
less and that the beautiful home is no
longer her's. he dons the chauffeur's
livery and, drives his own jar as a
servant.
The dual personality is continued
and Mr. Kerrigan plays chauffeur to
himself until he and the girl meet
on an equal social basis. She is as
tounded but glad. The reason why,
and the results of her happiness form
an interesting part in the plot of "The
Turn of a Card."

Issues of the Campaign .
Senator Sutter
V
delves deep into every issue, telling you why you should consider each before you vote. He answers the charges of enemies who are
seeking his defeat; he replies to attacks made on him. He speaks fearlessly. He deals frankly and fearlessly with the I. V. V. issue,
sccrine; these enemies of the nation and laying bare their intrigue in the state. He proves that THE I.-vW.-vW IS ONE OF THE GREAT
EST ISSUES IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND THAT EVASION OF THE ISSUE SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED.
DEMOCRACY DEMANDS DELIVERY

eeator Sutter
places before his audience cold facts and figures to show the waste and extravagance of the present state administration. He gives
the remedy for the ills of Arizona's State House. He explains how a political machine now has the state in a strangle hold and is seeking
to perpetuate its existence through the election of its candidates. H GIVES THE REMEDY FOR THIS .POLITICAL MACHINE.

MIMI
ADVANCES GIVEN MORE THAN 40,000 WORKMEN TWICE DURING
YEAR IN WAGES; COMPANIES BEGINNING TO ATTEND MORE
STRICTLY TO HOUSING PROBLEM SO AS TO RETAIN TRAINED
MEN, WHILE RENTAL BURDEN IS BEING DECREASED AS GREAT
LY AS POSSIBLE, MAKE WORKING CONDITIONS IN STATE GOOD,
WITH BETTER THINGS IN PROSPECT
i Arizona mines have rather a big record in the present year as to ad
vances to their forty thousand or more workmen. Twice they have raised
wages. Most of them have added to the increase in wages a time service
bonus payable at the end of a year, which is in effect a further advance in
wages. In all of the large copper districts steps have been taken to lighten
rental burdens. In most of them the operating companies have enlarged
home building opportunities formerly afforded their employes. In some of
them special effort has been made to reach the man of family who has not had
it in his power to meet living costs and still set aside enough to enable him
to start building his own home as steady as he might work. The children
have come and the doctor's bills and the school clothes and supplies. In the
Warren district and some others this class of men is being especially sought
out and put in the way of owning their own homes. It is not necessary for
them to have anything but their records of steadiness and endeavor to deal
fairly with the world. With such record, such a home as they want is built
for them and they pay for it in installments such as they have been paying for
rent. The difference is that when they have paid in the cost of the house, it
and the lot on which it stands belongs to them. Other workmen with money
ahead are privileged to build on advantageous terms, of course. But they are
expected to make payments in proportion to funds they can spare. Both for
their own benefit and for that of their
pay out as quickly as they can and
houses.
It seems that with advances in wages, advances in encouragement through
the bonuses to steadiness on the part of employes, and advances now in op
portunity to them to own their own homes, with a compensation measure en
odrsed on the side for injured workmen which makes it certain that in the
event of misfortune they will receive liberal returns even to payment for the
balance of their lives in the event of total disability, whether it be ten years
or forty years it seems that with these things standing out to their credit
during the eight months of 191S the mining companies of Arizona have been
not the least hesitant in exercising themselves to make working conditions in
Arizona good and to remove excuse for those who seek opportunity to make
dissatisfaction and cripple war indutsries in all ways they can in aid of the
kaiser.

TO
Plans Government Corpora
tion Which Would Author
ize Contracts to Increase
Mine Output
(By Milton A. Allen, Arizona State
Bureau of Mines)
So littlf has been heard or said re
cently regarding the twar minerals
bill that many western miners have
assumed that this bill has been passed.
The proposed war minerals bill, as
first drafted met with so much oppo
sition that it was dropped and a new
form of war minerals bill drawn up.
The proposed substitute anticipates a
government corporation with a capital
of fifty million dollars, authorized to
make contracts on such terms as are
necessary to create production of such
minerals, as are rennireil hv the imv-
ernment, of which the supply is not '
available except through the stimulus
which this legislation will provide.
U is expected that Senator Hender
son and his committee will report a
bill within a very few days and early
action upon it by the senate is anti
cipated. War Demand for Mica
Recently several deposits of mica
have been brought to the attention of
the Arizona state bureau of mines.
The war demands for sheet mica have
stimulated the production of this min-i-
eral, the production for 1917 being 41
per cent greater than that of 1916, ac
cording to the United States Geologi
al Survey bulletin.
The increase In price has ranged
1-20 per cent higher, the greatest in
crease being for smaller sizes, especial
ly 1H by 2. 2 by 2 and 2 by 3 inches.
The largest sizes show no increase in
price. This should be encouraging to
Arizona mica prospectors as the de
posits that so far have come to the
attention, of the state bureau have
yielded only th small sizes.
Its chief war uses are as an insulat
or in electrical apparatus and as a
transparent substance which can be
subjected to intense vibration and
shock either on land or sea.

Promoters of Sta,te to West
Attracted by History of Re
sults Accomplished in This
State
The interest in any given mineral
division does not always measure its
attractiveness over and above others
in resources. Ariona mining men re
cently have commented upon this fact
in connection with a rush of California
inquiries concerning manganese in
Ariona. Most of those making in
quiries are admittedly in the market
for properties on which to float or
ganiaztions in California. The reason
Ariona property is sought for the pros
pective investors is the record that
Arizona has made in manganese pro
duction, having probably jumped her
total monthly output of the ore to first
place in the United States in less than
a year of endeaver. It is good adver
tising material for the outside promo
ter. While thereis no dispopspition to
keep the money legitimate enterprises
away from the development of Arizona
resources, the question occurs whether
or not under war conditions it would
not be the proper thing for Inventors
of a given locality to develop the,
mineral resources closest to their
hands instead of being drawn far from ;
home into another state. In the in-1

COST OF
AL O N I
MANGANESE LAND
It is true that the mining counties of the state have taken the lnd
in endeavoring to assure the public of fair prices. Tlieir interest in keep
ing disaffection at the minimum, in providing the most that is iossible
to give to their people by way of cnahjing them to remain at work in
the production of the al important war metals, has of course provided n
larger incentive than has been brought home to some other colonies.
Tlie fact remains that they have accomplished much, acting independently,
and that a good deal of It can well be emulated generally.
There is in mind the fact that Hayden has been an a cash basis fur a
year and that its people and merchants are much better off in consequence:
that Ajo has a co-operative company store mulling dividend returns that
materially decrease the cost of living; tha: Globe-Miami have cash and no
free delivery plans and have abolished solicitors, with result of decrease
In costs in living expenditures; that Superior and Ray mine managements
impressed upon the merchants effectively that profiteering would result
in stores operating on a cost basis- that the mining company stores in
Risbee. Clifton and Douglas have kept prices on a nominal prefii basis in
those communities.

IS GOOD ADVICE
Much Dahger and Waste of
J Energy Brought About by
(! Improper Selection of Ex
plosives
The properties of high explosives
which are of first importance to the
user are those upon which depend,
either directly or indirectly, their
strength, quickness, sensitiveness, re
sistance to cold fumes evolved and re
sistance to the kind of work in which
the explosive Is used ahd the quali
ties most desirable in one kind of
work may be of little value or actual
ly harmful, in another. .
It i necessary, therefore, to manu
facture explosives with specific char
acteristics for different classes of
work and it is a great mistake for the
consumer to buy explosives regardless
of their special qualities and without
knowing positively just what kind of
an explosive would be most economi
cal for the work to be done.
"Explosive Misfits."
A larce proportion of the tronhles
and complaints arising from the sup
posed failure of explosives to do the
work desired is due not necessarily to
any Inherent defect in the explosive
itself, but in the fact that it may not
be Suited for the class of work in
which It is used. Instances where
people use a hiyh grade gelatin for
mudenpping, or explosives of the per
missahle type for open work, or quarry
powder and other kinds of quick, shat
tering explosives for coil work or slow
acting explosives in brittle rock, are
examples of what may be termed "Ex
plosive Misfits."
If the explosive is too strong .reduc
ing the cliarse may prove effective,
but the proper step u to secure a
weaker explosive. When the charge
is reduced, it does not rise in Mcli in
the hole and the upper st.me may not
he broken properly.
Quick and Slow Acting Explosiv. .
Tho quick-acting explosives are
more shattering, us'mlly break the
Mcne smaller and throw tnrtney.
The slow acting explosives have

The shattering effect of an explosive
can generally be reduced by leaving air

ber 1.
"We have had a good month so
fur," stated Manager George King
don this morning. "IT our luck con
tinues we will produce in the neigh
borhood of four and a half million
pounds of metal."
This will be a record almost un
precedented in the annals of the
smelting industry. The plant was op
erated only about ten days in July
and August will be the first
full
month.
Ore running around 13 or 16 per
cent copper is being treated. Man
ager Kingdon declined to gtess how
long the smelter would continue to
treat this high-grade.
Only the blast furnace is in use. it
should be remembered. The reverb
eratory will not be ready for another
month.
All the ore treated so far has been
from the Extension mine but for the
last month silicious ore has been re
ceived from the Commercial property,
in Copper Basin, at the rate of 2.1 to
30 tons p. day. This is being stored
until the limited supply of silicious
ore in the Extension begins to run
low. The company is in the market
for silicious ore in any amount.
That Silver Story
When questioned about current re-
ports that 'rich silver ore from the
Extension is being sacked and ship -
ped to the smelter. Manager Kingdon
dmitted that .me rich silver assay
had been secured but the bullion re
turns indicated that a mistake was
made somewhere.
"The silver content of our bullion
has not varie dtwo ounces to the ton
since we have been shipping what we
thought was rich silver ore." Kingdon
declared. "It was not worth sacking.
A few assays of native silver, taken
from between the 1200 and i:;oo
foot levels, ran high but the mttss
ran little better than the silver ore
we have been producing right along."
The Tunnel
About 9iNi0 feet of the haulage
tunnel Is completed, leaving some
thing over 30OO feet yet to be dug.
Manager Kingdon hopes to have the
tunnel finished by the end of the
year.
The delay is principally due to the
flooding of the Texas shaft. That
shaft has been flooded for two months
and a half, therefore no work has
been done in that period in the tun
nel headings from the botton. At
one time the water was up in
the
shaft 100 feet. Pumps broke down,
the head frame was pulled over and
other difficulties conspired to delay
operations. For weeks it was possible
to use only the bailer but the pumps
were started two or three days ago
and this morning the water had been
lowered to within three feet of the
bottom. It is hoped to resume in
both headings from the shaft within
two or three days.

COMPANY SHAFT
Pass Through Five Feet of
Lead-Silver in Sinking De
velopment Shaft Into the
Known Ore Zone
The Boras Leasing company, oper
ating a property situated in the Don
Luis section of the Warren district,
encountered an indication of rich min
eralization which depth which never
has failed in this district, when five
feet of lead-silver ore was struck in
the new shaft being sunk to open up
the known copper ore zone.
In order to open the copper ore at a
depth of S5 feet under the bottom of
the deepest working existing at pres
ent on the property, the one and a half
compartment shaft was" started with
an ultimate depth of 200 feet in view.
At 140 feet the lead-silver ore. of i
very good grade, was encountered and
before It was passed through a full
five feet of a vein entirely bottom
ing the shaft had to be gone through.
This not alone is one of the best
lead-silver strikes made in the dis
trict on the west side of the moun
tains, but indicates permanancy in the
copper deposit underlying the surface
rone.
At present no effort will be made to
develop the lead-silver ore. which will
be explored later. At present the
snaft will be continued to the desig .
nated depth, where drifting will be
started to get into ore bodies encount
ered in other workings.
The Boras leasing company has been
operating for more than a year and
has for some time been in the pro
ducing class. From eight to ten car
loads of ere monthly are sent to the
smelters at Douglas.
The company ha,s one of the most
complete and economical plants of
machinery to be found in Arizona, and
certainly none better qualified for the
work over came. A 12 by 20 Inger-soIl-Rand
compressor, operated by a
50-horse power motor and a 23 horsr
power air hoist enable Manager Harry
Jennings to push work much more
rapidly than wculd be possible with a
less complete equipment. Mr. Jen
nings, who is a candidate for the dem-
j ocratic nomination as a member of the
(house o frepresentatives. is giving
most of his time to the operation of
the property, these days, looking upon
it as a duty he owes the nation to
speed up mineral production as much
a.s possible.
The Boras lease lies but one mile
from the Don Luis loading station
between which and the mine there is
a good road. The company does its
hauling of ore and supplies by motor
truck. It is near the No. 3 shaft of the
C. & A. group at South Bisbee.
Prominent among the stockholders
in the lease are E. A. Tovrea and
Postmaster L. R. Bailey, both of whom

GEORGE W. LONG
STRIKES RICH
BODY OF COPPER
Mayer Electrified by News of
Big Mining Discovery Made
by Former Bisbee Mining
Man
BY F. W. BOWER.
MATER, Ariz, Sept. 3. Undoubted
ly the most important strike in copper
ore this summer is that of the Kay
, Copper company at Canon, about twenty-five
miles south of Mayer, at the
scuth end of the "Jerome to Phoenix"
mineralized belt. Ever since George
v. Long took oter the property, a
few weeks ago, .and started the old
shaft to the 500-ft. level, there has
been much speculation on the part of
those who know the history of this
mine, as to what would be encounter
ed when more depth was reached and
the ore zone crosscut.
For eight years S. J. Tribolet of
Phoenix has been spending his sur
ieet, which followed a strong vein of
plus in the development of the Kay
mine. A shaft was sunk by him 35u
copper ore froni the surface. Every
fifty feet a station was cut and ore
wasmined and shipped, a total of 42
carloads having been taken out which
ran from 10 to 18 per cent copper and
eome gold and silver. Tribolet spent
7u.li0o of his own money m mis devel
opment work.
Last spring George W. Long of Oat
man fame, examined the Kay mine
and shipped a carload of 42 tons of ore
selected carefully to represent the av
erage of the mine. The returns of the
carload showed 13.62 per cent copper.
The deal that --as finally made be
tween Tribolet, the principal owner,
and Long and associates, calls for the
expenditure of a large sum of money
and the work that has been done so
far under the new management would
indicate that mining methods of the
very best kind will je enipioyeu. The
old shaft has been retimbered where
necessary and sunk to the 500-foot
level in record time. A drift was start
ed south as soon as the station was
cut and 70 feet from the shaft the ore
body was encountered, which was 30
feet nearer he shaft than Tribolet
I
figured. The last reports from the In the Copper mountain district the

sevenrfoot hole on the foot wall av
eraged 19.5 copper, 1.75 ozs. in silver
and fl.SO Jn gold. Just how wide the
vein will be it this level is a question
but Judging by the uniform increase
in width of the vein from the surface
to the 350-foot level where ft wne SO
feet wide, it will in all probability bq
30 to 40 feet in width on the 500-foot
level, and it is expected the grade of
ore will keep up as it has on all of
the levels above. The drift is to be
continued a little farther when a cross
cut will be run east to determine the
width of the ore body. Surface Indi
cations show tlie mineralized zone to
be about 300 feet in width and about
3,000 feet long. The length of the
zone has been determined by several
shafts and pits along the strike,, the
deepest shall being 180 feet deep,
north of the main shaft 2,500 feet. In
this shaft, 12 feet of 5 per cent copper
ore was crosscut at the thirty-foot
level.
The successful development of the
Kay mine means a great deal to the
southern portion of the Black Canyon
district. Theje are several other ex
cellent properties in the same vicin
ity and the grade of ore seems to be
higher than in some of the other dis
tricts of the belt. The Kay property
is in excellent hands for big develop
ment. George Long has a big success
in the United Eastern mine at Oat

IT WAS ALL A
MISUNDERSTANDING
While there has been some criticism
of the C. & A. band in certain quar
ters over its action in dividing the
proceeds of the Labor day dance with
the Red Cross fifty-fifty, when it was
understood they were to give all the
receipts to this war work, yet It is
only fair to the band to state that
there was probably a misunderstand
ing in the matter. Mrs. F. E.
Shine, who represented the Red Cross
in the arrangements with the band
for this dance, called at the Review
office yesterday and declared that she
would assume responsibility for any
misunderstanding in the matter.
Mrs. Shine talked to the bandsmen
over the telephone and, while she sup
posed the Red Cross was to have all
the receipts, it being against the or
ganization rules to aid or take a part
in any scheme to raise funds for oth
er than its own benefit, it was evi
dently the bandsmen's impression
that the Red Cross and the band were
to divide the proceeds.
It is most regrettabll that there
should have been any friction between
war workers and the band. The C. &
A. band has been the district standby
for musical entertainment for more
than a year and it has always come
to the front to aid local and war enter
prises in a most commendable man
ner. People who are hasty to criticise
the band should stop to consider that

The fire department gaye Labor day

the band, when it learned the Red
Cross wished for Labor day night for
a dance, agreed cheerfully to play for

of percentage arose from a misunder
standing in making the arrangements
over the telephone. The band leader
and the bandsmen regret the affair ex
ceedingly. They had no desire to take
anything from the Red Cross to which
they were not entitled or welcome.
They were willing to give all or go
fifty-fifty, just as the Red Cross Cross
desired. After all, fifty-fifty with the
Red Cross is not so terribly bad. How
many business institutions in the dis
trict go as far with the Red Cross?
On the other hand, the band should
realize .that both the companies and

Much of the disappointment of Mr.
Aiken's friends who had a plentiful

came back alone. Needless to add
the disappointment was among his

"The reason that I like boys is be
cause I am still a boy myself. I do
not like sissy boys nor would be hard

WAR TAX ARTICLE
No. 7
(Rv Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 6. The in
come tax as a means of raising war
revenue really is nothing new to the
American people.
It was inaugurated in 1861, at a time
when money was needed to finance
the Civil war, and it continued in
operation until 1872. The first tax
on Incomes was authorized at a rate
of 3 per cent on all incomes above
$S00 per annum. This was increased
in 1862 and again in 1865, until in
comes between $600 and $5000 were
taxed at 5 per cent and those above
$5000 at 10 per cent.
There were few, if any evasions
of the tax according to financial his
torians, and in 1S65, despite the fact
that the entire country was in an
abnormal condition because of the
war, $32,050,000 was realized by that
means. But the spirit displayed by
the patriots of that day in meeting
the obligations of the income tax, is
but typical of the willingness which
all of the people of the country show
ed during that sad period, to rise to
the emergency in the matter of shoul
dering the burden of extra taxation.
A foreign minister, noting this zeal,
remarked to Secretary Seward: "I am
not surprised to see your young men
rushing enthusiastically to fight for
their flag. I have seen that in other
countries. But I have never before
seen a country where the people are
clamorous for taxation."
This clamor for taxation on the part
of the people was largely due to the
fact that at the beginning of the war
congress seemed to delay when it
came to the question of properly fin
ancing the struggle. A new tariff law
the Morrill bill which had been
framed during the peaceful days of
1860, was enacted March 2, 1S61, and
whUe the revenue derived from it
would have been adeqpate had the
commerce of the nation remained in a
normal condition, it was entirely in
adequate when the commerce be
came disrupted.
Loans were to be largely depended
upon to furnish the war revenue, it
being thought by the legislature that
the system which had worked so well
during the second war with England
and the Mexican war, would be equal
ly successful during the time of the
Civil war. As a result the ratio of
loans to taxes during 1S61-62 was $S.2.5
to $1; in 1862-63 as $5.51 to $1; in
1863-64 as $3.3S to $1, and in 1S64 65 as
$2.95 to $1.
Secretary Chase of the treasury
rather thought no- extraordinary taxa
tion was needed beyond that neces
sary to meet the interest on the new
loans authorized and to reduce a small
part of the debt annually. His tax
recommendation of December, 1S61,
was intended to yield only a 6mall
fraction of the amount expected from
the loans, but he did ask for internal
revenue duties, and in January, 1862,
congress adopted a more determined
policy and announced its intention to
enact a revenue measure which would
yield $150,000,000 annually.
The principle of this measure was
to levy moderate duties upon a large
number of commodities rather than
heavy duties upon a few. It included
rates upon luxuries represented by
spirits, ales, beer and tobacco; licens
es upon occupation, duties upon manu
factures or products, auction sales,
carriages, yachts, billiard tables and
plate; upon slaughtered cattle, hogs,
and sheep; upon railroads, steamboats
and ferry boats, railroad bonds, bank
ing institutions and insurance com
panies, upon salaries and pay of of
ficers in the service of the United
States; upon advertisements, income
and legacies and an extended list of
stamp duties.
From this it may be seen that this
system was very similar in nature to
the war time system now in vogue
and that the new measure of the pres
ent, day may be said to have been
modeled upon the Civil war emerg
ency bill.
Owing to the unsettled condition of
business the returns from this wide
reaching revenue bill were disappoint
ing and for the fiscal year of 1862-63
but $37,640,000 was realized instead of
the $15,000,000 that had been antici
pated. It was therefore, found neces
sary to make a change in the policy of
the bill and this was done in 1864
when the rate radically increased, be
ing doubled and even trebled in many
cases. Distilled spirits and tobacco
were hit hardest by the bill for the
rate on the former, which had been
twenty to sixty cents a gallon, was in
creased to $1.50 and $2 a gallon, wfiiie
cigars, which had been assessed at a
maximum rate of $3.50 a thousand
were now taxed at $40 a thousand.
Industry and commerce speedily ad
justed themselves to the new condi
tions and during the fiscal year of
1863-64 the internal tax system yield-
led a revenue of $109,741,000 and in the
following year the return was $209,
464.0U0. It may seem from this that the
revenue needed for the Civil war was
of very modest proportion, and it was
I modest when compared with the bil
i lions required to finance the present
i world conflict. But it must be re
! membered that aside from the rev
enue derived from taxation vast sums
were realized through a series of
loans.

Cpt. John L. Griffith, athletic director
at this cantonment, and Mike Gibbons,
boxing instructor, have been trans
ferred to Camp Gordon, Ga., but it is
not known here whether the change
will be permanent or merely tempo
rary. Captain Griffith's work here at
tracted wide attention among recrea

up their duties. A number of camp
boxirfg instructors also received their

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, Sept. v. The stock!
market made substantial recovery
during today's two-hour session from .
the shock sustained by yesterday1 an-i
nouncemeut respecting control of
members' loans. Trading was natur
slly restricted, however, by reason of
that condition, and the religious holi
day also caused a reduced attendance ;
of brokers. i
The steady progress of the allied adV
vance induced considerable short cov-i
ering. notably In U. S. Steel and other
speculative favorites. Rails also were ,
inclined to strength, although Union
Pacific and St. Paul were somewhat
backward, the latter forfeiting part
of yesterday's gain. Coppers were
again in d.nand. Sales amounted to
180.00H shares.
Dealings in exchange were nominal,
but change? were significant, in that
they once more moved, against neutral
centers, particularly Spain and Switz
erland. The bank statement was noteworthy
for the large expansion almost $120,
oOO.ooo in actual loans, with a result
ant increase of almost $S3.000,000 in
net demand deposits. Z
nvestment bonds were steady on
limited dealings, the speculative is
sues evincing slight irregularity. Sales
(par value) aggregated $2,825,000.
United States bonds, old issues,
were unchanged on call during the
week. , .
GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO, Sept. 7. Prohibition of
the manufacture of beer, beginning
Dec. 1, had a depressing Influence to
day on the corn market. Largely as
a result, prices closed unsettled, xc
to lc net lower, with October at
l-57n to $1.57',i and Nocember at
$1.56 to $1.5614. Oats finished l-8c
to c off and provisions varying from
a 10c decline to 25c advance.
An opinion became widespread that
bailey when no longer taken by the
brewers would be chiefly consumed
as feed, and would thus to a consid
erable extent reduce the feeding de
mand for corn. Accordingly, moder
ate price upturns which had resulted
from week end evening-tip or trades
and from lightness of receipts, were
more than counterbalanced. Predic
tions of a livelier movement of corn
to primary centers next week tendbl
likewise to handicap the bulls, and
so, too, did uncertaintly in regard to
what showing would be made by the
government crop leport on Monday.
Oats were governed almost entiro
ly by corn.
Covering by suors rallied pork from
asevere decline, caused by lack cf
(import. Higher quotations on hogs
helped to strengthen Irad and ribs.
COTTON MARXfc 1.
NEWYO RK, Sept. 7. Cotton closed

points.

MUST PRINT PRICES.
(By A. P. Correspondence.)
PARIS, Aug. 12 A presidential de
cree directing that the price of food
served in restaurants must be plainly!
shown on placards is now in effect ,
in all parishes of over 3,000 inhabi-!
tants throughout France. The decree :
is Intended to protect American sol-,
diers and workers from being fleeced
by restaurants. At the same time it
will be cf use to the ministry of food
for the control of retail prices.
The Intransigent tells a story of an
American officer being charged $1.60
for a slice of melon in a restaurant, '
which did not mark any prices on the
menu. The paper points o'lt that the
melon would cost $3, and would give
ten slices, so that the restaurant made
a profit of 450 per cent. '
