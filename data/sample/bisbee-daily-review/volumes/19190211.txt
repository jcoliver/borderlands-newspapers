Halted When Violence Is
Threatened at Car Barns

BUTTE. Mont.. Feb. 10. Twelve
thousand miners are idle here tonight,
either as the result ot last week's
strike of independent union organisa
tions as a protest against a reductiou
of one dollar a day in wages and the
"rustling card" system, or through
fear of intimidation by the striking
element. The situation is under con
trol ot military Torces commanded bv
Maj. A. M. Jones.
Operation of street car s-ervice in
Butte was halted early in the day
when crowds of strikers surrounded
the barns aud. according to the mili
tary authorities, threatened violence if
the cars were sent on their runs.
Two companies of the 44th Infantry,
regulars, guarded the approaches to
the mines today and prevented strike
pickets from saining access to the
workings where other miners were at
work. 1
Discharged soldiers who still wore
their uniforms and who associatea
with those attempiing to do picket
duty were singled out and ordered to
remove their uniforms or cease par
ticipation in the attempted picketing
of the mines. A number were taken
into custody temporarily and lectured
by Major Jones on the subject of re
spect to the United States uniform.
For about two hours early today the
troops were kept busy patrolling the
streets leading to the miues. Many
gatherings of strikers were broken up
and on one occasion, when an indi
vidual showed reluctance in obeying
the order to "move on." the bayonet
was called into play.
Many strikers gathered tod.ay in Fin

to be of Finnish birth. The songs were
rendered in the German tongue and
the military stopped it and ordered the
assemblage from the hall. The woman
was taken into custody. l.ater the
meeting was allowed to resume.
Although the streets were cleared
of pickets, only a few men went to

Judging from the countless prepara
tions and treatments which are contin
ually being advertised for the purpose
of making thin people fleshy, develop
ing arms, neck and bust, and replacing
ugly hollows and angles by the soft
curved lines of health and beauty,
there are evidently thousands of men
amd women who keenly feel their ex
cessive thinness.
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contain
ed .in modern foods. Fhyslcians claim
there is nothing that will supply this
deficiency so well as the organic uhoa-
phate known among druggists as bitro
phosphate. which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
moat all druggists under a guarantee
of satisfaction or money back. By
feeding the nerves directly and by sup
plying the body cells with the neces
sary phosphoric food elements, bitro
phosphate quickly produces a welcome
transformation in the appearance; the
increase in weight frequently being
astonishing.
This increase in wetsht also carries
with it a general improvement in the
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always
accompany excessive thinness, soon
disappear, dull eyes become bright,
and pale cheeks glow with the bloom
of perfect health.
CAUTION: Although bitro-phos-phate
is unsurpassed for relieving
nervousness, sleeplessness and gen
eral weakness, it should not, owing
to its remarkable flesh-growing prop
erties, be used by anyone who does
not desire to put on flesh.

WASHINGTON'. Feb. 10. Revision
of sentences imposed by general court
martial (or offenses coraraitteed dur
ing the war is to be made by a board
of officers constituted in the office
of the Judge advocate general of the
army. Secretary Baker announced to
day that the result "would be a sub
stantial reduction of the sentences
save those of the gravest character, or
"where aggravated circumstances ex
ist." The exact number of military pris
oners held at home and overseas who
might be affected was not made
known but Mr. Baker recently inform
ed the tenate that 22.009 trials by
general courts martial had been held
Lace the beginning of hostilities. Ap
proximately 350.000 other cases were
beard, but as the charges were not
of a Berkms nature, the trials were by
special or summary courts.
"The cessation of hostilities and the
return to conditions approximating
those of peace," said Mr. Baker's state
ment, ""render it Just and proper that
clemency be exercised toward prison
ers convicted by general courts mar
tial for offenses committed since the
beginning of the present war.
"With this end in view, a boarA
consisting of officers of experience in
civil, as well as military life, has been
constituted in the judge advocate's
office, to examine the records of these
prisoners and enable the judge advo
cate general to recommend to the sec
retary of war reduction of sentences
as the facts and dictates of justice in
each may warrant. The commandants
of the barracks have been instructed
to forward promptly to the judge advo
cate general their recommendations as
to each prisoner.
"Such action will effect a speedy re
vision of sentences to meet the
changed conditions and will unques
tionably result in a substantial reduc
tion of the sentence in nearly all cases
save those of the gravest character or
where aggravated circumstances exist.-

statement upon learning of the order
to end the strike in a demonstration
of labor's solidarity:
"Tb calling off of the general strike
will not replace union labor in the
high position it held in Seattle. With
out reason, without cause, our city
lay prostrate. Union labor must clean
house. SeatUe may forgive but it can
not forget."
Strike Virtually Over
Virtually the general strike was
over this morning as nearly every
labor union of importance to industry
or business was at work and the men
remained at work until the end of the
day. Seventeen hundred teamsters
and truck drivers, nearly the entire
street car company's force, milk wag
on drivers, barbers, automobile drivers
and garbage drivers were back at
their tasks. Schools opened. Two
shipping treminals resumed work with
non-union and union men and other
terminals were preparing to start busi
ness during the day or Tuesday morn
ing with non-union men. unless the
regular forces returned. Police guards
watched the docks where non-union
crews worked today.
Employes included in the Seattle
Amusement federation, including mov
ing picture operators, musicians, stage
hands and other stage crafts, late to
day voted to resume work at 6 o'clock
tonight, resisting attempts made to
have them postpone action until noon
Tuesday. As a result the city's the

A number of newspaper men were

the laws of the state of New York if
the signatures were affixed to the pa

Dempsey left tonight to begin a six

Bisbee's Paving Program
Exit Utah's Delegates
All Arizonans win be pleased to hear that Utah's dreams of purchas
ing a strip of northern Arizona have come to nothing; that the delegation
from the neighboring state, satisfied that they cannot induce this state
to sell, have determined to return to their homes empty handed.
Their junketing trip over, their little visit to the best state in the
union concluded, their imaginations satiated, and their visions of an.
easy Arizona falling prey to their pet scheme initiated some fifteen
years ago. they will return home to report another failure.
But they leave behind one "nasty taste" which will rankle in the
throats of Arizonans for many months to come.
"Men have been killed there and cattle slaughtered said one of the
delegates, "and nobody has been brought to book. It has been a' no
man's land." Our people of Utah who are in there do not get the pro
tection of the law to which they are entitled.
This remark, coming as it does, forty-eight hours after residents of
the Arizona side of the strip had complained to Governor Campbell that
"our people of Utah" were illegally running their cattle on Arizona
ranges, does not speak well for the Utah, representative.
If "men have been killed there and cattle slaughtered" it has prob
ably been because they were from Utah and because they refused to
remain on their own side of the line. And if they have not gotten the
protection of the law to which they are entitled, it is probably for the
same reason. The gentleman from Utah forgets that even today west
erners have a special code for dealing with those who break the rules of
the ranges.
When Utah next seeks to purchase a part of Arizona we hope the
delegation which visits this state will confine their junketing to facts.
Arizona's record as a law abiding state is second to none not even
Utah's.
Right Up to Congress
The copper mine workers of Arizona, Utah and Montana are urging
congress to provide legislation for the extension of long term credits to
foreign countries to stimulate the copper market and relieve critical
condition of this industry. The resolution asks 'that the warland navy
departments withhold 6tocks of copper now on hand, from the market.
The workers appointed a permanent committee to co-operate with the
mine managers in helping to restore normal conditions. Just as critical
a condition exists in the lead industry. ,
The copper situation is typical of many industries which were
oending every effort toward 'war production.
Our representatives at Washington apparently fail to realize that
the government cannot cut off its relations with our industries over
night without creating industrial distress.
Contracts have been cancelled right and left on the one hand
while on the othergo forth rumors of orders to sell hundreds of millions
of metals, machinery, wool, etc, all of which tends to break down the
market and create confusion and unemployment.
Our legislators while making long speeches on what to do for the
returning soldiers, overlook the fact that immediate and definite" action
is necessary to stabilize our industrial system so that our returning sol
diers may find mork when they get here instead of unemployment.
The copper mine workers in their resolution to congress are show
ing more sense and foresight than most of our law makers. They have
suggested one definite way to help stabilize a certain line of industry.
To the west, the mining industry can bring prosperity or slack
times.
Continued delay and inaction on the part of congress in adopting
definite and constructive measures will aggravate the situation and cause
untold loss and hardship.
Gasoline Sales to Increase
Wirh the arrive! of these ba'my days and longer evenings, resi
dents of the Warren district will be tuning up their motors for spring

Keep the Home Fires Burning
One prevented the passage of natitfnal women's suffrage amend
ment in congress yesterday perhaps his wife helped keep the fires
burning n thecapitol grounds instead of in the kitchen stove.
Watching the legislature
A new -.eek is opening for the Arizona legislature; let us all hope
the members will forget their petty politics of last week and return
to the favorable status of the weeks preceding.

Bisbee bids fair to set a record for speed in preparing, submitting
and securing action on paving for its streets. Not one day has been
wasted in making ready for placing the paving program before the
people and six weeks more will probably definitely settle whether
Main stret. Brewery avenue and other thoroughfares shall be paved.
Before the signing of the armistice it was patriotic not to build or
pave.
With the signing of the armistice it became patriotic to reorganize
and begin anew community improvement.
By the middle of December the government had issued a call on
citizens and communities to provide work for returning soldiers through
extensive civic improvement- It was at this time that Eisbee began con
sidering paving its more important streets. -
The question first came before the city council In the latter part
of December. At that time the city engineer was instructed to) make
surveys.
Handicaps in rushing the work have not been unknown. Heavy
snows of December and January halted work at several times and the
influenza epidemic made inroads on his limited force of engineers and
surveyors.
Meantime, the city attorney was preparing his share ot the burden.
In his way, the law places handicaps which prevent immediate voting
on the Question. Long periods must elapse for the publication of ordi
nances ar.d sisii'ar legal recjuirements-
Tne periods imposed by law will elapse during the latter part of
Marcl: and it is probable that the election will be held about March 22.
Three months, almost to the day, will have elapsed since the city
first began considering its paving program. The period is perhaps
the shortest, and the preparations have been completed in perhaps the
briefest time in the history of similar improvements in Arizona cities.'
PHOENIX. Ariz Feb. 10. A pecu
liar situation developed today in tne
lower house of the state legislature
over Delbridge's measure to appro
priate $250,000 for a hospital for
miners.
In the committee of the whole, aft
er a rapid-fire discussion, it was re
commended for indefinite postpone
ment. No count was announced on
the rote, although, apparently, a heavy
majority of the representatives was
in favor of shelving the measure.
Later, when the committee of the
whole arose and the bill came up in
the house it triumphed by a vote of
16 to 15 and was sent to the enrolling
I and engrossing committee for a third
I reading.
The main burden of the argument
I against the miners' hospital bill was
I that the state could not afford the
I necessary quarter of a million dollars
! at the present. Then there were o-
I jections to the clauses containing the
.'qualifications of those eligible to ad-j
! mission. Originally these allowed
I men of 50 years or over who had been
working continuously as . miners for

to to years and demanding ten years
continuous woik.
Barrows aimed a blow st fraudulent
advertising in bill 9S which he intro
duced and which would provide fines
or imprisonment for repeated offenses
up to $1000 and a year's term.
Francis was responsible for the in-
traduction of proposed legislation to
investigate and encourage an irriga
tion project and canal for the San
Simon Cienega creek and to impound
the Chidachua mountain waters for
the reclamation of arid lands in. the
San Simon, Cochise county valley,
the bill further would provide for the
sinking of an experimental artesian
well; the investigating and recom
mending the most feasible ways to re
claim arid lands of the Sulphu?
Springs vailey; cutting and building
flood gates in white river of the Sul
phur Springs valley. The total of ap
propriation provided in the bill is $30,-000.

PHOENIX. Ariz., Feb. 10 The
Utah delegation which came to
Phoenix Saturday night with the
intention of negotiating a deal
for a strip of northern Arizona
above the Grand canyon now is
satisfied that nothing can come -of
that end of the proposal.
At an infoimal conference late
today, however, representatives
of Arizona and the two Utah men.
A. W. lvins and G. F. McGonagle,
state engineer of Utah, gained the
impression that in the future ways
and means would be found for
closer co-operation between the
two states, particularly with re
gard to roads in northern Arizona .
and the administration of law in
the strip.
Those present at the conference
besides the governor and the two
Utah delegates were: Speaker
A. C. Peterson of the house.
State Land Commissiouer W. A.

senate; H. E. Campbell, Represen

STORY OF NUMBER 40
C. II. Wilkings. Jr., headquarters
company, 107th engineers, in writing
to his iather, Charles H. Wilkings of
this city, describes his experiences in
France and Germany in detail, from
the time he left the United States on
the transport Aeolus.. January 25. 1917,
until December IT, 19 IS, when he was
stationel in Obeibieber. Germany. At
the start of his military service he
was with tiie regimental band, but
soon was transferred to Company C
and later after a period of detached
service, sent to headquarters com
pany and put to driving a truck. This
work he kept p until after the armi
stice was signed. His duties took
him to Chateau Thierry in the hottest
part of the fighting, the Alsatian front
and then to- the Verdun front, where
to was when the armistice was
signed.
Young Wilkings then resumed his
position as a bandsman aui on No
vember 16 started with the American
army of occupation toward th&
Rhine. The average march was from
15 to 20 miles a -day. The band
played as it marched through all
towns en route. In Belgium all of
the towns were decorated. The Bel-

John Sharp Williams. Samuel Go ta

Lowell and many others on its execu
tive committee, is holding nine con
gresses in different parts of the coun
try this month, the idea being to unify
the public in the insistent demand for
maintenance of peace.
The invitation received by Mayor
Erickson to appoint delegates, says in
part:
"Agreements made at the peace con
ference will, for generations to come,
vitally affect for good or ill the econ
omic, political and moral wellbeing of
mankind. The creation there as a
league of free nations can long insure
the orderly development of the world
and preserve peace. To such a league,
President Wilson wisely decided, by
personal attendance, to throw his
great influence on the side of an un
selfish and righteous peace, with a
league of nations to safeguard it per
petually. The series of mine con
gresses for a league of nations will
give opportunity for those who wen
the war, both on and behind the fight
ing line, to speak their wishes. Agree
ment at Paris and ratification by the
senate may depend cn the size and
temper of these congresses and the
carry ing out in the states of the plan
of action they adopt."

PHOENIX. Ariz., Feb. 10. A joint
memorial introduced in the state sen
ate late this afternoon charged rail
road officials with abusing the confi

Tho memorial which was Xo. 5. was ;
