ibout ready to make announcement
but after a conference with the

Argentine Senate Votes by
Overwhelming Majority to
Break Off Diplomatic Rela
tions with Pirate Nation.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BUENOS AIRES .Sept. 19. The
Argsnta senate by a vote of 23 to 1
today declared for the breaking off of
relations with German.
The resolution no toes to the
chamber of deputies. There is strong
public feeling in favor of its, final
passage.
(By Review leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19. News
that the Argente senate had voted
overwhelmingly to sever diplomatic
relations with Germany was received
in Washington tonight with gratifi
cation and no little surprise.
Situation Aggravated.
Officials had recognized that recent
disclosures concerning cablegrams
to- Berlin by the German minister at
Buenos Aires through the Swedish
foreign office had aggravated the sit
uation brought about by Germany's
sinking of Argentine ships, but it had
been assumed that, with the German
minister handed his passports, no
further official action would be taken
pending receipt of Berlin's explana
tion of the messages.
Would Be Welcomed.
Although it is understood the state
department's purpose in making pub
lic copies of the cablegrams was only
to expose the German government's
world-wide system of duplicity and In
trigue, it is no secret that Argentine's
participation in the war would be wel
comed. Effect Powerful.
Even the .breaking off of relations,
it is pointed out, would have a pow
erful effect on public opinion in all
South American countries where Ger
man influences are known to be
strong.
Is Food Producer.
That action also probably would re
sult in considerable benefit to the
allies by restricting Argentine grain
and Meat exports to neutral countries
through which they might find their
way to Germany..
Argentine is now the only good
neutral food producing country.
Prospect Bright
for End of Strike
(By Review Leased Wire.)
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 19. The
prospect that some agreement might
be reached whereby 25,000 members of
unions affiliated with the iron trades
council would return to work next
week at a 10 per cent wage increase,
pending arbitration of their demands,
appeared bright tonight as representa
tives of men and employers and fed
eral agents continued their cOnfer
: ences.
j The government's offer to assume
half of the wage advances for com
, panies making not more than 10 per
' cent profits on commandeered ships
was viewed as furnishing means
whereby a speedy settlement might be
! effected.
AUSTRIAN OFFICIAL.
LONDON, Sept. 19. Monday's of

First Major Increment of Na
tional Army Mobilized and
New On Way to Various
Cantonments Throughout
Country.
(By Review ieasJd Wire).
WASHINGTON, Sept. 19. While
mobilization Of the first major incre
ment of che National army was pro
ceeding today throughout the country.
Secretary Baiter and the chiefs of the
war department appeared before the
senate appropriations corn ii: it tee to
present requests for an additional
$787,416,000 with which to provide
equipment for a total force of 2,300,000
men.
Ordnance for Men
Included among the items is the
ordance equipment for the next 500,
000 men of the National army, al
though the 300,000 or more on the
move today toward the training can
tonments are only haif of the first call.
Mobilization Smooth
Dispatches from all parts of the
country Indicated that mobilization
was being carried forward smoothly
and amid scenes Of popular enthusi
asm. Almost the entire 45 per cent
of the first force of 687,000 men will
be under military control and training
by Saturday.
Essentials Provided
Every essential for the halts and
comfort of the men has been provided
for. They will be fed and sheltered
without ditficulty, and their arms, uni
forms and balance of their war equip
ment will be ready for them as rapid
ly as they are rejyly 10 use it.
Busy Days Ahead
There are busy days ahead at the
cantonments. Not only must the men
be examined by military doctors and
finally accepted for army service, but
they must be organized immediately
into piOvisional companies for admin
istrative purposes and to make pos
sible their final assignments to infant
ry, cavalry or artillery or to the spe
cial corps.
Partly Equipped
Pending the time when the fighting
forces of the National army begin to
take shape it is not essential that full
unilOrm equipment be available for
every man. Many of the young re
serve officers who are to command
units of the National army are not
now at the cantonments. For addi
tional training, after their graduation
from the officers' training camps,
some have been attached t'j National
Guard units; others are at service
schools preparing to become instruc
tors to the batteries, machine-gun
companies, signal battalions and other
highly specialized Arms.
Commanders Envied
Regular officers assigned to com
mand regiments Of the National army
are looked upon somewhat enviously
by their comrades. It is common ex
pression among the officers that the
task of training the absolutely new
forces is an inspiring one to a man
who likes to see his company, troop
or battery develop from day to day.
The National army men have no old
theories of soldiering to learn. They
are ready to put all the vim of youth
immediately into the lessons Of today
from the battle fronts.

Night
At 7:30 last night a special train or
Pullman sleepers moved away in the
general direction of Camp Funston,
carrying the Cochise men who go as
tl'eir county's representation in the
nation's second call.
The men had put in another strenu
ous day. They had drilled a part of
the morning, after which Captain J.
C. Walker addressed them. He told
them something of the service, and a
great deal about their individual duties
as soldiers.
Afterwards the men were at liberty
until 4 o'clock, when they were form
ed at the Y. M. C. A. and marched to
the station. Due to the rain, the
scheduled band concert did not mater
ialize; although the C. and A. band
played the National air as the men
entrained. A vast crowd had gather

they cheered loudly as the new sol

Warner Shattuck
Fails to Report
for Army Service
j Among the 49 slackers who falleu
to report yesterday to the sheriffs of
fice in time to leave with the draft
quota, of 270 ordered to leave yester
day evening for the Camp Funston
training camp was Warner A. Shat-
tuck, son of L. C. Shattuck, the well
known Arizona mine operator. Young
Shattuck, it was stated, baa gone to
Mexico. The sheriff's office turned his
name, along with the others who failed
to report, over to the United States
department of justice yesterday, ana
all these men will be hunted down by
deputy United States marshals.
I Uncle Sam will be stern with called
; men who defy the drraft His hand
1 men who defy the draft. His hand
, they are brought to punishment. It
is a most serious offense to evade or
defy the draft.
j Considerable attention was attract
! ed to the case of young Shattuck
i when an exemption plea was filed
I for him, because of the wealth and
i prominence of his father. The county
i board refused the plea, and upon an
1 appeal to the district board it was
again refused.
j The plea was based upon the oe-
; sire that the young man finish his
studies in the engineering school.
When asked yesterday as to the
whereabouts and intentions of his son,
Mr. Shattuck declared that he did mot
know. He said he thought h's son
had gone to Mexico. He seemed to
be very much affected by the circum
stance of his son's failure to report
for duty to his government. "I would
rather that my boy should go to Eu
rope and fight and die, if need be, for
his country," said the master of the
Shattuck mine, "than that he should
go into perpetual exile in a foreign
country branded by his friends as a
slacker. I do not know where he is
at this time; If I did I think I
should go after him and try tv bring
. him back."

Quaker City Learns of Murder
Of Policemen Resulting
From Political Fight Be
tween Party Factions.
(By Review Leased Wire)
PHNvADELPHIA, Sept. 19. This
city is aroused by murder and riot to
day in the ward known as the "bloody
fifth." The murder, that of a police
man, by a man declared to be a gun
man from Jersey City, was the out
come of a bitter political fight be
tween two Republican factions for the
control of the ward which skirts the
river front.
For weeks the battle has waged,
culminating today when the primary
election was held for the naming of
city candidates. James A. Carey,
bolder of the city office, and Isaac
Deustch, were opponents for the nomi
nation for the office of councilman on
the Republican ticket.
Early in the day, Carey, while mak
ing the rounds of the ward, was at
tacked by a man alleged to be Jacob
Mascia of Jersey City. He was
struck from behind with a sandbag.
At the same time J. H. Haurer, an as
sistant district attorney, was attacked.
Policeman George A .Eppley went to
their rescue and, it is alleged, Mascia
placed a revolver against his abdomen
and fired. Eppley died later in a
hospital. On his death bed he identi
fied Mascia as his assailant.
Mascia was arrested, as was John
Costello, also of Jersey City. The po
lice questioned them for an hour and
later announced both men confessed
they were hired in New York or Jer
sey City with 19 others and brought
here yesterday to vote for Deutsch.
Mascia is charged with murder and
Costello with being an accessory to
the crime. Mascia denied he did the
schootihg.
Today's rioting was the culmination
of trouble which began last night,
when about 30 thugs attacked the Fin
letter club. Republican headquarters
in the Fifth ward, firing several shots.
Six men were sent to a hospital.

NEW YORK, Sept. 19. Recommen-i
dation was made to the military au

district board of New York that where
two sons from one family are in the
military service of the United States
other sons of draft age be exempted.
The board in a letter to the secre

general said that in its opinion tba
"existing emergency does not require
that more than two sons ot one family
should be called, even in the absence
of pecuniary dependency of a parent

The government is urged to correct
what the board terms this "apparent

A STRANGE R. R. ACCIDENT.
(By Review Leased Wire)
EL PASO, Texas, Sept. 18. Rail
road accidents are always novel, but
it was left for a big moguel type
Southern Pacific engine to divide its
heavy freight tr3in and scatter it on
three tracks, then to lean up against
a three story building as if fatigued
from its efforts on a hot September
day.
The freight train was passing the
El Pa30 union station when the pilot
of the big engine struck a split switch.
The engine went down one track, the
tender and an oil tank car went onto
another track while the freight cars
were scattered along the right of way
and on the rails of a third track. Two
large telegraph poles prevented the
locomotive from plowing through the
brick building against which it lean
ed heavily.

"THE PINCH HITTER"
AT ORPHEUM TODAY
"The Pinch Hitter" delivered a reg
ular big league "lAmer" , in Bisbee,
judging from the laughs a- good-sized
crowd gave Charles Ray in- his screen
production at the Orpheum last night.
Ray, an awkward country-bred boy
with a strain of refinement inherited
from bis mother, is sent to college,
where he becomes the laughing stock
of bis fellow students. He tries to
make the ball team, but tonly succeeds
in becoming its mascot He becomes
the hero of the hour, however, when
as a last resort "cinch hitter" he
knocks out a home run, wins the cru
cial game of the year and the girl.
Ray proved himself a versatile and
clever performer, and, best of all, he
was natural. If you love clean com
edy, here's your opportunity. It is be
ing shown again today.

THE OLD BOYS AND THE CIRCUS.
Of course everyone ksows that a small boy goes wild
the day of the circus. He is up before the dawn to see the
animals unloaded, he stands on tiptoe and watches the
procession, he buys lemonade and popcorn and feeds pea
nuts to the elephant and gasps over the sideshow and en
ters the big top in breathless ecstacy and sees it through
to the last turning wheel of the chariot race finale.
But how about the old boys; the boys grown to men?
There was a circus In Douglas yesterday and a lot of old
boys from Bisbee went over there on business. One
well known business man went over in his auto on a very
important matter early in the morning and had a blow
out and did not return until late at night Another old
boy, head of a deptarment for a certain mining company,
got up an hour early in the morning and was over the
hills and far away on the road to Douglas before the sun
had scaled the mountain tops. He had business over
there, he said.
They are gay, gladsome, gorgeous liars, these old boys.
They went to see that circus. And the editor of The
Review wishes now that he had gone with them. All day
yesterday there came to his mind sweet memories, waft
ed from the rose-scents of the long ago. Circus morning
dawned again and lighted the rooms of the old home and
he saw again his mother's face, anxious, smiling, love-lit,
as she urged a tow-headed, pug-nosed boy to be careful
when he slipped away in the gray light down to the circus
train.
And the boys and girls who went with him down to
the side tracks on circus morning, where are they? The
years and the spaces intervene between them. They
are scattered from coast to coast and some have gone be
yond these earthly shores.
Don't you remember, you old boys, who now toil and
spin and weave and sow and buy and sell in the shops
and market places, how the circus train looked in the
haze of the dawn? The long string of "flats" with can
vas drawn tight over the cages. And the sleepy, husky
canvasmen and cooks snd clowns that tumbled out of
the train and began to run the wagons down the incline
and hook the big beautiful horses to them and drive them
rumbling away to the grounds.
You remember well how big the elephants looked
against the rim of the rising sun and how you thrilled
when an indignant lion roared his remonstrance over
being jolted about in his cage behind the canvas and
gayly painted boards.
You followed those wagons to the grounds and hung
around there till dinner time, admiring the manner in
which the canvasmen drove their stakes, three or four
of them at a time swinging the sledges. You were back
at one, held in leash by father or mother, eager to get
into the big tent. You remember how, after the glorious
thrse hours of pomp and unparalelled pleasure, you
emerged from that wonderland and blinked at the pro
saic daylight and fringe of houses and trees, and for a
time could not realize they were real.
The old thrill of circus day. It remains always in the
hearts of boys no longer young. Debts, duties and depres
sion vanish before the magic of the three rings and the
gay riders and the daring trapeeze performers and the
funny clowns and the wild animals.
A lot of the old boy3 from Bisbee slipped away over
to Douglas yest"rday, just to be young again for a day
More power to them. Ponce de Leon missed his spring
of youth but if he had found a three ring circus it would
have answered just as well.
"Where are the dreams of yesterday
The wind has blown them all away."
And only when the circus conies to town do they come
back again.
This talk right now of a coal shortage makes one
shudder.
WHY NOT?
With a long, hard war ahead of us it is necessary that
this country leave nothing undone that will aid in the
marshaling of its resources to combat the common
enemy. One of Germany's main dependencies in the
time of her great struggle is her roads. Her railroads
and her highways. Sne can move her troops quickly
and provision and munition them. She would have been
beaten long ago but for this advantage.
The railroads of the United States are struggling
splendidly with transportation problems that would have
been deemed impossible a year or two ago. But think
how much help a fine system of highways would be at
this time. With motor trucks and wagon trains the need
ed supplies from factories and farms could be almost
doubled. But alas, no state in the union has enough
good roads in one unbroken chain to meet the emergency
that may well arise any day.
Suppose that every board of supervisors in Arizona
should unite to build a road from the New Mexico border
to California by both the northern and the southern
route, using the prison j-s in the county jails for the
work? What a fine thing this would be. Not a scattered
and disorganized effort, but under the general direction
of the state and special direction of the county engineer.
Concentrated upon one road, prisoners in one camp.
Building well and a little at a time. A real military
highway that would last and that would be practical for
military purposes. Suppose that Greenlee, Graham, Gila,
Cochise, Pima, Santa Cruz and Yuma counties should
unite on the southern road. And that Maricopa, Yava
pai, Mohave, Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties of the
northern tier of the state should unite to build a real
road. If the cities of these counties co-operated by turn
ing their prisoners to the county jails there would be no
lack of labor. -
Why not? Now is the time.
The only cut in bread has been in the size of the loaf.
The price remains the same. Boy. page Mr. Hoover.
THE WELCOME IN LONDON.
An interesting account of the first appearance of Amer
ican troops in London was given in the London Times
Weekly not long ago. We have had reports from our
own correspondents of the enthusiastic welcome given
our boys and the flag they carried. But the cordial no
tice given in the British paper has a special appeal for
readers on this side of the Atlantic.
The Times expressed surprise that volunteers, soldiers
of not much more than six weeks standing should be so
well drilled as those Americans marching down Pall
Mall. Our troops, so the report reads, "were a remark
ably uniform lot and their physique was splendid. They
marched with a free step, like the Colonial troops. After
a month and a half of drilling these men marched as well
as many of our permanent battalions." All London
cheered "in British fashion."
There were some strictly American features in tho
welcome given the American troops. "Once in the crowd
there came a weird sound that caused all heads to turn
in wonder. The American files knew it, and although
they could not respond, they smiled as they looked
straight to their front, for it was the college yell of Har
vard." There are times when many Americans would
agree with our British friends that the typical college
yell is a "weird sound," but it will probably sound pretty
good to the boys in olive drab while they are in Europe.
It's interesting to see our troops as others see them.
It's good to feel running through this British comment
the friendly spirit of our neighbors across the Atlantic.
In time the Tommies may learn to cheer as vociferously
as any college student or baseball fan in the United
States, while the Sammies may learn the warmth and sin
cerity that lies under the British reserve.
DRINK PLENTY OF WATER.
As the hot weather ends people are apt to cut down
on one of the essentials of diet, and the cheapest one
water. The body can stand fasting for weeks. But
death ensues if it goes without water for more than
about Ave days. More than half the body is made up
of water, and plenty of f. uid is necessary to preserve it
in a healthy condition. t
Not only does water wash out waste material and sup
ply a necessary ingredient for the body, but it also pro
vides the fluid medium for the chemical processes of di
gestion. Foods are absorbed better when in solution
with plenty of water. This fact disposes of the old su
perstition that water should not be drunk at meals. Ex
periments have shown that copious water drinking at
meals is, if anything, beneficial.
So water drinking should not be slighted just because
cooler weather has quieted the thirst of summer. There
is no danger of drinking too much. All the danger is the
other way. Kansas City Star.
The Review is in receipt of many books and pamphlets
devoted to special discussion on certain phases of the
war or causes leading up to It, all of them written by se
lected authorities of the U. S. and allied governments.
These books are authentic anil exceedingly Interesting.
A score or more of them are on .hand at this time which
the editor would be glad to give to any reader interested
enough in the diplomatic and historical phases of the
war to come and ask for.

MayorAdamson of
Douglas Returns
From Long Trip
After a trip of six weeks, during
which he visited Los Angeles, San
Francisco and Seattle and steamed
up the coast of British Columbia and
Southeastern Alaska 2000 miles
northwest of Puget sound. Mayor W.
M. Adamson, accompanied by Mrs.
Adanison, returned home t'j Douglas
Tuesday.
For twenty-two days he was on the
good ship Admiral Watson sailing past
glaciers and around iceburgs as he
dreamed of the warm days he had
left behind him in Arizona, and he
might have gone right on into Behring
sea if he hadn't been so anxious to
get back and see the pavement ton
Ninth street and how much Douglas
had grown since he left. At that he
probably got as near the north pole
as our old friend Doc Cook. Mr. and
Mrs. L. R. Budrow of this city were
with him and his wife on the trip.
At Seattle Mr. Adanison wanted to
ee Maj'jr Hiram C. Gill to discuss
some of the problems, that vex all
mayors, and the Seattle man would
probably have been glad to hear how
we handle I. W. W.'s in this coun
try, but HI and his corncob were
so busy with a street car strike and
out In the front yard of his home on
a war garden that the meeting be
tween Seattle's skinny and baldhead
ed maySr and the rotund chief exec
utive of Douglas was impossible.
Mr. Adamson liked Seattle, just as
everybody else does, and he thinks it
has the finest shops in the country.
Arizona Beat Alaska
The end of the mayor's voyage in
Alaska was Anchorage, seaport ter
minus of the government's Alaska
railroad running into the middle of
the great Copper river country to
Fairbanks.
"Alaska appears to be a great min
eral country." said Mr. Adanison last
night, "but I believe Arizona is bet
ter. No man over 45 should go into
Alaska. It's too cold in the interior,
and fjo wet and chilly on the coast.
The salmon were at this time run
ning on the southeastern coast and I
did not know there were so many sal
mon canneries in the United States.
The run of sockeyes, humpbacks and
silversides was unusually heavy this
year, and Chinamen, Japs and Indians
were busy putting them in tin cans.
I saw as many as twenty tons of sal
mon in one scow and that many fish
flipping and jumping around, their
sides glistening in the sunlight, is a
lively spectacle, I can assure you.
Iceburgs Beautiful Sights
"The iceburgs are a beautiful thing
t'j see In the placid Alaskan waters.
Sometimes looking blue, again
green, depending perhaps on what J
you have been drinking, they make
a great change from the desert land
scape, and as for glaciers we passed
600 miles of them on the Fairweather
coast."
In San Francisco the mayor at
tended the plaster manufacturers'
convention. He did not have time
to go "over to American Lake to call
on General Greene, but the people of
Tacoma. he saw by the newspapers,
gave him a great send-off on his ar
rival there. The sawmills, shipyards
and lumber camps of the northwest
suffered some from I. W. W. strikes.

SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 19. Frank
; C. Oxman, Durkee, Ore., cattleman,

! here July 22, 1916, according to testi

! trial of Oxman for alleged attempted
, subornation of prejury growing out of
; the Mooney case.
"Oxman made the offer after I told
j District Attorney Kickert I would
make a poor witness for the state,"
i Rigall testified.
Rigall also asserted Oxman outlin
' ed a scheme whereby Kigali was to
share the $17,000 reward offered for
the capture and conviction ofthose

"I was in Niagara Falls, N. W

Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in

NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Sept. 19. A decided
turn for the better came today in the
stock market. The selling movement
was checked effectively and there was
a general marking of values which
reached substantial proportions. A
noticeable chang was the tendency
to follow up the market on the rise.
Strength was maintained throughout
the session. Total transactions were
S25.000 shares.
Improved conditions in the money
market were spoken of most frequent
ly as a direct source of strength.
Speculation has been restrained by
the firmness of the money market.
The putting out of large sums in loans
resulted in an easing of rates. Time
money was 5 to 5 and call funds
were loaned as low as 2 per cent.
Indications that announcements re
garding steel and copper would soon
be made at Washington helped the
market Another encouraging feature
was the indication of steady Improve
ment in the Russian situation.
The buying came jargely from the
shorts, but the movement spread and
there were signs of considerably In
creased buying for the long account
The movement ranged .from 1 to 6
points.
The bond market was irregular.
Tolta sales, par value. $2,900,000.
United States 2' registered an ad
vance of 1 per cent
Liberty bonds sold at 99.98 to 100.
GRAIN MARKET. 1
CHICAGO, Sept. 19. Fresh uneasP
ness over chances that serious crop
damage from frost was not unlikely
gave an ad vantage,-to the bulls today
in the corn market. Frequent violent
shifts in values took place and the
close was unsettled, to net Jiigh
er, 119 to 119 December and 115
to 116 May. Oats lost : to ;to .
Provisions wound up at an advance
of 17 to 77 cents.
Despite the' fact that frosts which
had been looked for did not appear,
the corn market rallied quickly from
a break that took place at the outset
Seaboard speculators ware said to
have been among the leading buyers.
Freezing weather was reported at
Minot, N. D., and unsettled, cooler
conditions were indicated for a big
portion of the corn belt
Oats fluctuated with corn, but show
ed less bouyancy on account of the
comparative slowness of cash demand.
Incoming supplies of wheat at Minn
eapolis and Dultuh were reported as
nearly equalling in volume the totals
of a year ago. At Chicago, however,
the arrivals were far from meeting
requisitions from millers. -
Big shipments of meat stimulated a
rise in the provision list

and fast rules but deal with every sit
uation on its merits. So long as de
mand and supply have free play in
a commodity we had "best leave it
alone.
Administration Powers,
"The food administration powers to
fix prices lies in export buying, the
power, to buy and sell certain commod
ities and the further power to enter
voluntary agreements with producers.
Public's Illusion.
"One illusion in the mind of the
public I am anxious to get clear. The
food administration through its own
authority and the co-operation of other
government agencies, can accomplish
a great deal but is limited absolutely
to that arear of commerce between
the producer and the retailer. We are,
stopped in law within this area. We
can only use influence on both the re
tailer and producer and depend upon
their patriotism. In this area we can
only regulate the flow of trade and
hoi dit to moderate prices and excise
speculation.
"In the food administration we in-
jtend to confine ourselves to 10 or 12
fundamental staples .those food com
modities that make up the basis of
life."
War Is Enterprise.
Lord Northcliffe said that the Uni
ted States, as did England, would come
to a realization that war is a great
business enterprise and that the coun
try must draw on its best resources
in cbemistary, engineering, transporta
tion, manufacturing and distributing.
Industries and War.
"Almost all of the industries in our
country," Lord Northcliffe said, "have
been remade by the war. One of the
first practical things done in Great
Britain to assist in winning the war
was to lengthen the day by adding an
hour In the morning and dropping an
hour in the afternoon.
Vast Store Necessary.
"You will require vast refrigerat
ing stores for the preservation of
meats and other foods for your armies.
At this time six months from now
you will probably have between 600,
000 and 800,00 men in the field. Think
of the refrigerating machinery you
must establish.
The Greatest Business.
"This war is the greatest business
the world ever knew and in our coun
try we are doing nothing else. Let
me tell you that you will have to
furnish five and six pairs of shoes a
year in the easiest parts of the lines
at the front and 12 pairs a year at the
hard parts for each of the 600,000 or
800,000 men you soon will have on the
front"
A Pointed. ,.
Lord Northcliffe pointed out that
the average life of a rifle is six weeks,
as one Instance In addition to those
already cited of the amount of busi
ness organization that must be creat
ed in the United States on account of
the war.
