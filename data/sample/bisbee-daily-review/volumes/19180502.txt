Seventy-four lives were lost when the
steamship City of Athens of the Ocean
Steamship Company, was rammed by
a French cruiser off the Delaware
coast.
.The City of Athens carried a crew
of 135 men. The vessel sank within
seven minutes after the collision. Sixty-one
of the crew were brought to
this city late today by the French
cruiser which was not seriously dam
aged.
Hre was discovered in one of the
holds of the City of Athens immedi-!
ately after the collision. An attempt
was made to Jower the life boats but
the vessel was sinking too fast. Most
of those on board leaped overboard
and the survivors were rescued by
the boats or the French cruiser.
" Marines on Board
Among the passengers on the City
of Athens were 24 members of the
United States Marine corps. The
first engineer and a tender on board
the steamer expressed the belief that
some of the marines were lost.
Hoth ships were carrying running
lights because of the heavy" fog whicjt

sectors ground was captured and pris

The pause in the offensive, however,
apparently is r.ot to be taken as mcrn

to crack the allied line. AH along the
front the big guns are roaring and

ing the close of th 3 conflict.
The story of the play is that of the

former friends, including th3 girl he
loves. Meantime another man has at
tracted her attention. He is an un

loves, and again wins her favor. The
carpetbagger becomes desperate, and
lays a plot to destroy the other's popu
larity and reputation. The plot is de
tected at the last moment and the
play ends to the satisfaction of all concerned.

Great Wheat Stocks
Isolated.
It's the shortage in ships that
Is putting the Allies and the
United States on wheat rations.
Great stocks of wheat are iso
lated In India, and Australia. At
great sacrifice in ship space and
use the Allies are forced to se
cure some wheat from Argentina,
On January 1, Australia had
stored 100,000,000 bushels of
wheat that was ready for ex
port but there were no ships.
Then came the new crop with
an exportable surplus of 80,000,
000 bushels. Now Australia has
approximately ISO.000,000 bush
els waiting for ships.
India, at the same time, had
70,000,000 bushels of wheat
stored for export. During April
10,000,000 bushels more out of
the new crop will be added to
the pile.
Argentina closed the last ship

S Sowing Germs of
Bolshevism in All
Allied Nations
It is not the destruction, or even the
defeat of the allied armies on the western
front that we have to fear most, grave as is
their peril, but rather the defeat. of the al
lied forces behind these lines. It is a fact,
known absolutely and beyond the shadow
of a doubt, that the German general staff
count the prospects of beating the British,
French and American armies, yes, and the
Italian armies, at about zero. But this
crafty and tricky staff does count surely
upon carrying on a fierce and deadly of
fensive to a point where the forces behind
these brave lines will weaken and crumble
and thus make possible the impossible task
of the German armies.
And, unfortunately, there is ground for
this belief. Russia was destroyed by forces
behind the Russian fighting lines. Italy
was driven from all her hard won positions
clear down to the last ditch of the Lom
bard plains by the destruction of the forces
behind her lines. German peace propagan
das have been more effective by far than
German military efforts all through the
war.
France would surely have broken the
German lines and driven the Hun from
France a year ago but for French traitors
and pacifists, bought and encouraged by
German gold and German agents, j
Close observers, great writers, famous
statesmen, loyal leaders, in all the allied na
tions are writing and talking and thinking
and worrying more about the German
propagandas than about German armies,
great as is the menace of the latter at this
time. The true story of German methods
in Russia and Italy is just coming to light.
Bolshevism is a German weapon more
powerful and effective than German poi
son gas or German batteries or German
shock troops. Germany found this wea
pon, a weak and smouldering blaze, in Rus
sia, and fanned it into a great flame. The
success of German agents and German gold
with this Bolsheviki tool in Russia has en
couraged the German staff to try to use it
in every allied nation. And the German
Socialists have been selected as the proper
persons to sharpen and wield this miser
able but most effective tool.
Do not scoff; do not jeer; do not
doubt! This danger is pressing; it is real.
Kerensky underestimated the wild-eyed
fools and fanatics under- the grotesque
Trotzky and the cunning devil, ' Lenine,
and he was driven from power and his
nation enslaved by Berlin, the home
and headquarters of Bolshevism. Every
paper and publicist and preacher and pa
triot in the land should exploit this new
propaganda and fight it tooth and nail. For
it has spread to America. It has spread to
Arizona. Bolshevism has a headquarters
in New York and in San Francisco. Ger
man agents and German gold are support
ing them. Not openly, or in the name of
the kaiser, of course. But, nevertheless in
the interest of the kaiser.
With a cunning and patience and per
sistence and stealth and treachery that
must surely have been engendered in hell,
German agents and sympathizers are nurs
ing and fanning and feeding and encour
aging this blaze, hoping for a flame like
that of Russia to repay them for their ef
forts. Bolshevism, after the betrayal and de
struction of Russia, is, of course, a bad
name to work with, so they have changed
it to Internationalism. Socialism is also in
bad odor, so they have changed that name
to Internationalism, too. But they are all
one and the same. They have the same
end, namely, to aid Germany. In England,
Italy, France and America, the Socialists,
Bolsheviki, I. W. W., pacifists, and all the"
misguided, restless, unreasoning, weak,
disloyal element are being welded into an
organization that will, the German staff
hopes, under leaders of the Lenine brand,
directed by German agents and financed
by German gold, do incalculable harm be
hind the battle lines. The mission of pick
ed leaders is to impose upon and mislead
and inflame the workers. This done, the
work of the German armies will be made
easy in the end.
Now, Germany can promote and en
courage and mould socialism without fear,
for she holds the workers under an iron
hand. Her railroads and steel foundries
and shipyards and mines are operated by
the government. Soldiers with bayonets
and machine guns make short work of any
strikers or shirkers or shouters in Ger
many. As William English Walling, a fa
mous writer upon socialistic subjects, well
puts it, "We may understand why the Ger
man Socialists, living in an autocracy like
the kaiserland, have been revolutionary in
words and entirely loyal and conservative
in deeds."
It is not hard to understand. The rec
ords of the past year show it plainly to all
who will look and learn. A few months
ago the German Socialists and Bolsheviki
and union workingmen were talking and
threatening to high heaven abcut a peace'
without indemnity and annexation. They
were going to tie up war budgets in the
reichstag. They were demanding resigna
tions of the junkers. They wanted peace
They threatened strikes. Russia was being
destroyed the while. Once the Russian arm
ies had been disbanded by the Bolsheviki,
and bingo! The German Socialist was
squelched by an iron paw. His work had
been done; let him be silent now. A peace
with indemnities and annexations was
forced down Russia's throat. The toler
ent smile vanished from the face of Berlin;
the soft hand changed to iron. We have
the men now, let the drive in the west be
gin. Slaughter, grim and great until our
ends are accomplished. A few of the so
cialist dupes who were really honest pro
tested and called strikes, but they were sup
pressed with rifle fire and the leaders
they vanished from the ken of man, leaving
no trace behind. Only Berlin knows their
fate.
So it is Germany nourishes this viper's
brood in her breast, having the antidote of
ruthless iron authority for its sting. But
the free nations into the midst of which she
sends this poisonous swarm, have not this
antidote. One man's voice and vote and
action is at par with another's in this re
public. It is slow and trying work to stop
the frothings of the socialist here, and to
curb the strike leader and gag the traitor
and imprison the propagandist. Our ship
yards and railroads and mines and steel
foundries are open and unprotected against
the terrible menace of misdirected and mis
informed union workers. Day and night,
every hour, the work goe3 on. From a hun
dred hidden sources ooze lies and hints and
misgivings and whispers and suggestions
to loyal workingmen. And when all is said
and done, these are nothing but the black,
foul, blighting, blasting methods of the
Russian Bolsheviki transplanted and re
vamped and overhauled to fit the occasion
and meet the needs over here. So far they
have failed. American workmen in the
main have been loyal. Exceptions here
and ther have not been of a degree and pro
portion to alarm. But the work goes on.
Its danger remains.
Do you doubt it? Only a few days ago
a state wide strike was called right here in
Arizona without cause or reason. Of
course there was a cause given. It was to
help Mooney. Bah ! What were the influ
ences behind that strike call? No one
knows, or ever will know. It failed because
of the loyalty of American labor and it was
promptly rescinded. The stroke will come
in some other form and launched by some
ether hand next time. Why doubt it ? The
following circular was issued by the Ger
man foreign office as long ago as 1915,
and was sent to every Germav consul in
America:
"There have been established within the terri
tory of the country where you are special bu
reaus for tiie organization of propaganda in the
countries that are in the war condition against
Germany. The propaganda will have for its ob
ject to propagate sorial upheavals, accompanied
by strikes, revolutionary explosions, separation
movements, and civil war as well as an agitation
in favor of disarmament and the cessation of the
present bloody war."
No loyal American citizen is even
thinking of such a thing as a strike right
now. He knows that it is a hamper and a
brake upon his government in its wax
work. It takes clever agitation and patient
work and cunning propaganda to prepare
and launch a strike. Every loyal labor
leader and politician is labeled by German
spies and marked for slaughter by Ger
many's dupes, the Bolsheviki. Do you
doubt it? Here is an extract from an edi
torial in a German socialist newspaper:
"Unless the entente peoples make an end
of their present governments, they will
hardly get peace." Nothing here, however,
about the German socialists getting rid of
the present kaiserbund of Germany. The
German socialist and Bolsheviki is the stool
pigeon and decoy for the allied socialist and
bolsheviki and radical. He lures them on
and leads them on and eggs them on to
hamper their government, either by strikes
or by peace clamorings or by play of words
that say one thing and mean another.
A widespread and determined move
ment is under way right now to stir up the
British workingmen to hamper their gov
ernment. French workers and socialists
are being tempted. Italian socialists are
under pressure, and it is no secret in Ger
many right now that when the Austrian
offensive against Italy begins this summer
it is expected that this foe in the rear will
.again attempt to undermine Italy's morale
as it did last fall when it brought about the
disaster upon the Isonzo plateau.
Every time Harry Lauder, the great
Scotch actor, gives a performance now he
takes occasion to combat this poison prop
aganda by urging every man in his audi
ence to constitute himself a secret service
man and loyal agent to fight the bolsheviki
in his town and neighborhood. And every
time this great Scotch patriot makes his
appeal many persons in his audience get up
and leave the theater. German agents,
ihese; sympathizers, tools, dupes, traitors.
They abound in every city in this land. It
is our duty to watch them and fight them
and suppress them. Loyal men are in the
clear sunlight striving with voice and act to
win the war. All others slink in the shad
ow of sham and pretense and subterfuge
and excuse and false doctrines and danger
ous substitutes and traitorous compromises.
Those who are not working and fighting
and giving and doing to win the war for
the allies are either actively or passively
upon the side of Germany. And the Ger
man staff is counting upon their active or
passive aid as absolutely necessary to break
the allied front in the west. This aid from
the rear gave the Germans their victory
over Ru'ssia and over the Italians, and they
have gone wild on the alcohol in this wine
of success.
BUT WILL IT WIN FOR THEM IN
AMERICA? SO FAR IT HAS FAILED.
AND IT IS THE DUTY OF EACH ONE
OF US TO SEE THAT THE GERMS OF
BOLSHEVISM SOWN IN THIS COUN
TRY DO NOT PROPAGATE.

4. V. Adams Brings a Message of
Constructive Power.
Bisbee people who attended the first
number of the week's chautauqua pro

that O'Dell's war talk was well worth the
price of a season ticket. It was a rousing,
stirring, and also most instructive talk.
Other speakers yet to come have messages
on the war well worth hearing. Sidelights,
new lights, spotlights will be thrown upon
the Great War by men who have seen it at
close hand and who have had exceptional
opportunities for information upon its
progress both from a military and economic
standpoint, are in the service of the Lyce

And still the British hold their lines.
The Germans', badly punished Sunday and
Monday as a result of fruitless attacks, are
withdrawing their shattered divisions and
bringing up fresh troops, keeping up in the
meantime an incessant bombardment.
Now comes the question, how long can the
Germans stand the slaughter? How long
will their morale hold out? It is declared
that their recent attacks lack the punch and
dash and determination they possessed only
a few days ago.

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, May 1. Stocks were
again active ar.d strong at the open
ing of today's market on the further
cheek to the German forces and the
favorable quarterly report of the
United States Steel Corporation, is
sued alter the close of yesterday's
session. United States Steel led the
movement throughout, making an ex
treme advance of 2'g points, its con
tribution to the day's business amount
ing to about 30 per cent of the whole.
Associated stocks were 1 to 2
points higher, as were also the better
known equipments. Coppers were
backward, pending adjustment of tne
new price schedule by the war board
and shippings denoted occasional pres
sure which was overcome in part at
the strong close.
The belated movement in transpor
tation lacked explanation other than
that investors are taking cognizance
of federal financial assistance of an
increasing scale. Total sales of stocks
amounted to 360,000 shares.
Lire made another new minimum
with checks at 9 03 but rallied later.
Call money stiffened from its low
rate of Z. closing at 6 per cent.
Bonds included Liberty issues,
which changed hands in large amounts
were firm. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $9,150,0i0. United States
bonds, old issues, were unchanged on
call.
GRAINS
CHICAGO, May 1. Corn prices
tumbled today owing to general liquid
ation brought on largely by reports
that the east was offering to resell
cash grain and by fresh gossip re
garding -peace. The market closed
weak at the same as yesterday's fin
ish to 2 lower, with May 1.2 1 ft and
July 1.45Z to 1.45. Oats lost !i to
1 1. In provisions there v. as
an advance of 12 to 40.
At the outset, new developments
touching peace efforts gave consider
able inmulse to selling of corn and to
too did warmer weather mat poimeu
to increased nlaniing. Assertions later
that receipts at Kansas City and St.
Louis would be light iroru now on led
to a moderate rally, but before mid-
day the selling broadened aaain and
weakness became acute in the last
hour. In this connection there were
likewise reports that big quantities of
Canadian oats were headed to the sea-
board.
Oats were ruied by the same fac -
tors which governed corn.
Provisions went upgrade chiefly on
account of knowledge that May deliv -
eries of lard, azgregating 1.00 . 900
pounds, had gone into strong nanus.

COPPER QUEEN CLUB
DEFEATS JUNCTIONS
IN ONE SIDED GAME
Manager Fred Carnes Copper Queen
bpsebiili team yesterday took the Junc-
tion-l'.r:;.gs team into camp by a 13
to 5 score in a one-sided contest which
was featured by a running catch made
by Stadelli in" left field when he
snagged Cal Earthman's liner with his
bare hand.
Bill. Leverett made an impressive
showing against the Junction-Brings
club and won as he pleased. He again
gave but a single earned run, the bal
ance of the opposition's tallies coming
on errors.
In Sunday's game against the C. &
A., Leverett gave one earned run. Lev
erett had perfect control yesterday
and did not have to extend himself
to win. Judging by the showing he
made in his two final games here, the
slab artists should go good in the
American association this season. He
will leave this morning for Minneap
olis.
Gcoree M-eaehem of the C- & A.
team caught yesterday's contest for
the J-B outfit and did a neat job of
the. backstopping duties. Catcher
Waidrc nf the J-B ninp iniured his leg
! several days ago at the mine and has
been perambulation on crutches since.
First Baseman Miller of the J-B
club announced last night that he
will leave soon for the northwest,
where he has an offer to play with
Vancouver this season.A Miller ha3
hit an even .500 in the games played
here and at first base and also on the
slab did fine work.
Johnson, infietder. did not play with
the J-B team yesterday and expects to
leave soon to join a team on the
coast.
Red Toner hurled for the J-B team
vesterdav and was hit fairly hard by
the Queen sluggers. It was a bad day

according to the federal authorities,
she had reecived about $40,000 from
Rodiger since her arrival in this coun

The propostion was brought up of
taking two big league clubs over this
summer to play for the soldiers, se

Why waste money buying pianos you can re
turn in two years. A little more money will buy a
piano good for a lifetime. The reason so many
poor pianos are in Bisbee is that people bought
from agents or persons selling on consignment
terms for distant concerns. Thesa agents, dealers,
commission fiends, etc., collect from 150 to 200
per cent profit, also interest. I sell standard makes
at a reasonable price and r.o interest. This is why
my dray works every day. You can get stung on
everything you buy in Bisbee from 10c music and
fiddle strings to piancs.

THREE SONS ON
THE TUSCANIA
San Francisco Woman
Gave Country Three
Soldiers-One Lost
With Torpedoed
Transport.
W0S0NSSENT TO
FRENCH FRONT
Mrs. Louise Moore of 139 First ave
cue, San FranciBco, knows the mean
ing of war. In the front window of
her home a service flag shows three
stars. Three of her sons answered the
call to colors.
And when the Tuscanla was torpe
doed, with the loss of more than one
hundred American lives, her eldest
son. William Moore, made the great
sacrifice for hU country. Oh the rocky
coast of Ireland he lies buried in the
grave which enfolds others of his com-'
rades In arms.
The other two aons of Mrs. Moore,
who were also on the Tuscanla, are
listed among those saved. The joy
over their safety has been tempered
only by the grief which followed the
word of William's passing.
"I told those boys I was sorry that
there was occasion to go to war," said
Mrs. Moore, smiling" through the an
guish that was her portion in the days
following the Tuscanla disaster. "But
I told them also," she added with a
triumphant smile, "that if our country
was worth living in and enjoying when
things were going along smoothly. It
was certainly worth fighting for when
It was In trouble."
That is the spirit ' of American
motherhood in these days of trifl and
sacrifice. "Our country has not asked
much of Its younir people In the way
of sacrifice," said Mrs. Moore. "Things
tare been fairly easy for most of the
boys and girls of this generation. Now
It is fiiielr time to show how they have
appreciated all that has been given to
them."
Mrs. Moore has two other sons, cne
of draft ae, and the other old enough
to enlist but not old enough to be
drafted.
"Now they're crazy to go," said the
brave little mother whose service flag
already has one haloed star.
''Do you know the last thins; the
thrco boys did before they left?" she
asked with motherly pride. "They ail
bought Liberty Bonds, and said they
would leave the rest of that work to
us. Now we know whtt we can do."
Private William Moore and hia
brothers have1 left a message: for th
s'ay-at-hemes In -(America to heed.
"The rest of you btiy Liberty Bonds
that can be your work."
Have you planned to buy your next
ene, now that the Third Liberty Loan
Is called for?
