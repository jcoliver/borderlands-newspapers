(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 11. Sensa

Ramblers, some of tbe men of im
mense wealth," already it at work
in Washington seeking to defeat tbe
administration food control bills,
were made tonight in a formal state

ture
"Allies of the kaiser unpatriotic
and disloyal who should be made to
feel the loathing and contempt of
every patriotic American," are some
of the characterizations applied by
Mr. Vrooman to . "food speculators.
food cornerers and food gamblers,"
who he. promises, will in time be
touched fcy appropriate legislation.
Secretary Vrooman's statement fol
lows: "Never In the history of the world
have business men shown . as much
patriotism and unselfishness as have
been manifested since the war be
gan by the business men of Amer
ican. An overwhelming majority of
them have been as ready to place
their business organizations and their
personal services and the! wealth at
the dispose! of the federal govern
ment in this crisis as the young men
have been to do the actual fighting.
. -Allies of Kaiser"
"However, this, attitude baa not
been universal. There are food spec
ulators, food cornerers and food
gamblers, some of them: men of Im
mense wealth and others of very
small means, who are today taking
advantage of wa -conditions to ex
ploit their fellow citizens to the full
extent of their ability. These men
re allies of the kaiser and are do
ing their utmost to defeat the patri

ever they are seen, in high places
or in low. they should be condemned
and made to feel the loathing con
tempt of every patriotic American.
These men will be taken care of in
due time- by netional. state and mu
nicipal legislation. But until such
legislation can be enacted the only
effective pwoer that can be brought
against them Is the power of an out

should be used vigorously and mer

Wheat Trading
Is Stopped
In Windy City
Largest Buyers Now Are Eur
opean Governments, Not'
Speculators, Declares Head
of Board of Trade.
(By Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO, May 11. Trading in May
wheat was ordered discontinued at a
meeting of the board of directors of
the Chicago board 'Jf trade tonight.
The directors also decided that exist
ing contracts should be adjudicated
either by delivery of the property o
at a selling price to be fixed by a com
mittee appointed for the purpose. The
committee is beaded by James A.
Patten and will meet tomorrow morn
ing.
It was rumored that action- by the
federal authorities in the last few
days and particularly yesterday had
hastened the action of the board 01
directors. None of those at the meet
ing would confirm or deny that it had
been inmiated to board officials tbat
some action to curb soaring prices jf
wheat should be taken or government
officials would close the board. It was
admitted that a number of board of
trade members bad been summoned
to the office of the federal district at
torney in the mtrnlng and others
again in the afternoon, but It was said
no threats bad been made or intimat
ed. It also was admitted that govern
ment agents had been in the trading
pit of the board for several days tail
ing notes on the traders.
' "The board of directors waa prompt
ed in reaching their conclusions by
what they deemed to be their patr.
tic duty to the country in this hour
of national stress," said Joseps P.
Griffin, president of the board of
trade. "True, this action is without
precedent in the history of this ex
change, although other exchanges in
this country have taken similar ac
tion. It should be understood that the
board of trade is neither a buyer nor
a seller1 It is merely a market place.
"The recent hysteria over the food
situation has causd - a stampede of
consumers in every direction, and
while it is regretable it is neverthe
less a fact that even the leading gov
ernments of Europe seem to have
become fearful as to their future re
quirements. The largest buyers of
wheat l'or present and future delivery
at this time In the market are the
govtrnmenU of Europe, not specu
lators."

International Agreement For
Placing Purchasing Power
of Billions, Is Being Rapid
ly Formulated.
DRAFT OF AGREEMENT
LEFT WITH McADOO
Competitive Bidding Will Be
Eliminated; Domestic Con
ditions To Be Reversed,
Buyer To Have Full Say.
(By Review LeaSed Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 11. An in
ternational agreement under which
there will be placed in the hands of
a small commission,! possibly or one
man, the purchasing power of virtually
every dollar of the billions to be lent
tbe allies by this government and the
additional billions "which they wilj
spend in this country out of their own
income. Is In process of formulation.
Draft of the proposed agreement
had been left to Secretary McAdoo.
The agreement would get maximum
efficiency both for the allies and for
the American government for every
dollar spent in this country for war
purposes.
Conditions Reversed.'
By its creation, domestic conditions
prevalent in this country for the last
two decades, under which the big pro
ducer assumed the dominance in all
markets, would be almost completely
reversed. Not the producer but the
buyer would be 'the dominant factor
for these would be but one buyer for
the belligerent nations.
The plan involved no living of prices,
however. First efforts will be confined
to a program eliminating competitive
bidding.
Were there no check upon the ef
forts of the allies to satisfy individual
requirements in this country, it is
realized that their united demands
would send prices soaring.
Estimates Discontinued.
Upon ratification of the proposed
agreement, the pensonnel of the pur
chasing committees will be designated
by this government. It will have not
more than five members. The entire
responsibility may be vested in one
man.
American needs, naturally, will
come first.- The needs of the allies
will take the next place, and after
they are satisfied, it is expected that
a residue of production wiTl be avail
able for neutrals.
Because of the great work involved,
tabulation of estimates of subscrip
tions to the liberty loan has been dis
continued. Actual subscriptions will
be reported as .soon as the subscrip
tion blanks can be made available.
Among the gormal offers to subscribe
received today was one from the Wood
men of the World, at Denver, for
$100,000.

LONDON, May 11. The govern

that all persons inciting to the stop
page of work on munitions are liable
to conviction for an offense entailing

stoppage of work was clearly unau

curred at a time, when, in view of
the present offensive on all fronts,
there is greater need for munitions
than at any previous time.

Violent Protests To
War Tax Bill Heard
i
By Senate Committee
(By Review Leased Wire)
; WASHINGTON. May 11. While
tbe house 'debated the $l,SOO,000.0ou
war tax bill today, the senate finance
committee heard violent protests from
interests on which the new war
levies would fall. '
Manufacturers who would have to
pay the increased excess profit tax,
distillers, brewers, soda fountain in
terests and music companies all told
the senate committee that they faced
ruin if the bill went', through as pre
sented in the house. Nearly every
witness declared his particular busi
ness seemed to be the target for an
exhort itant tax.
In the house too, many portions
of the bill were under fire, but Dem
rjcrs'.ic and Republican; leaders in)
congress replied that the money must
be raised and only high taxes could
raise it. Representative Fordney, of
Michigan, ranking Republican on tbe
ways and means committee, made a
four-hour speech for the measure. He
said he agreed with Democratic Lead
er Kitchin that the measure had
some faults but on the whole It was
equitable.
Ford my Explains
The income tax increases and the
rise in postal rates consumed a large
part of the time today in the house
debate. Some representatives sug
gested that the tax on big incomes
was net high enough and others op
posed vigorously the proposal to In
crease the postage rate on second
class matter by creation of a zone
system.
Replying to critics of the Income
tax section, Mr. Fordney told the
house that there is a limit to which
the government can go and take from
v, man his Income until ho begins to
evade the law. "There Is no law
in this country or any other," he said,
that compels a corporation to pay
dividends. The minute you have
taxed the corporations to a point
where they see you are about to con
fiscate their property, they will pass
to surplus their earnins instead of
paying it in dividends. In making
up the income tax rates, the commit
tee was mindful of these possibili
ties."
Postal Raise Opposed
Republican Leader Mann asked If
It would not be fairer to tax news
papers and magazine advertising than

CHICAGO. May 11. Whatever
part she played in the killing of
13-year-old Grace Hagemann,
Doris Anderson. th,e 14-year-old
ohuni of the dead girl, showed her
self an unusual girl today.
"I am innocent, I am Innocent,"
she repeated many times to de
tectives and other investigators,
speaking sometimes with what
she considered the manner of a
film vampire, or again with the
baby innocence of the screen in
genue. "Can't you tell by my looks that
I am innocent?" she asked. "In
the movies guilt always shows on
the face." She confessed to a love
for sensational fiction.
According to Doris her chum
started to shoot herself; she grap

the weapon was discharged into
her back.

to put the proposed additional post
age rate on second-cla-as mail matter.
Mr. Fordney replied that this would
be a tax on volume r.f business and
an unjust tax.
Representative Hull, of Iova, also
opposed the increased rates for mag
azines and newspapers, and chal
lenged statements that the govern
ment now is losing millions annually
on this class of business. Represent
ative Bland of Indiana 'old the house
that the postoffice department had
worked out to provide that uo fcal
aries of postmasters shall be increas
ed during the war. The debate will
be continued tomorrow. It was a
gloomy picture that protectant
against the war tax incrc-ases painted
for the senate committer. Disorgan
ization of industries, cloewl factories,
discharged employes, reduced pricea
to producer, and destruction of re
trailers were among the predictions.
Soda Tax Assailed
Representatives of national manu
facturers and Induitriai organizations
declared that the excess profits tax
was discriminatory against corpora
tions. The whote tax load also was
criticized as too large, and the sug
gestion was imade that the tax bur
den be distribute! over several de
cades.
. Tbe greatly Increased tax on dis
tilled liquors, the committee was
told, would decrease production and
revenues, as well as encourage illi
cit traffic. The brewery interests
said many small breweries would be
forced to close.
Protesting against the rates on soft
drinks and Ingredients, manufact
urers' representatives said the in
creased burden cannot be passed on
to the consumer, and tbat soda foun
tains, durg stores, and other small
business men would be crippled. The
bill's tobacco rates were said by rep
resentatives of manufacturers and or
ganized cigar makers to be grossly
excessive and certain to cause sus
pension of small manufacturers, de
creased consumption and so reducf
revenue.
Tomorrow the committee will con

ties, advertising, amusements, club
dues. Insurance, and general manu

"Black Followers." It was said to
number half a dozen boys and an
equal number of girls. It seemed
to have no sinister, or other pur
pose. Tbe inquest this afternoon was
postponed to allow for investiga

girl's father created quite a scene
at the Inquiry.

He rushed toward Doris, but
was restrained. The girl met his
savage assault calmly, her pose
suggesting that she was doing as
she thought one of her favorite

and chin out.
One of the theories being inves

over a boy, Relnbardt Fleck. The

All Foodstuffs
Measure Introduced By Sena

ment Power To License
Manufacture And Storage.
(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON. May 11. A food
control bill approved by the adminis
tration and containing many features
of the agriculture department's meas
ures pending in the house was Intro
duced in the senate today by Senator
Gore, chairman of tbe agriculture com
mittee. An early effort will be made
to bring It to the senate floor.
The bill contains most of the pro
posals fought, according to Carl Vroo
man. assistant secretary of agricul
ture, by a powerful lobby of wealthy
food gamblers. It calls for a food sur
vey by the agriculture department and
would give tbe department power to
license tbe manufactur, storage, and
distribution of food. One provision
would legalize tbe mixture of wheat
and other cereals in the making of
flour and would fix food standards.
The house agriculture) committee
heard some food experts during the
day, among them KIrby C. White of
Detroit, president of the American
Seed Association, who advocated pow
er for the government to take over and
sell the country's seed supply. A com
mission to deal with tbe situation was
the suggestion of Joseph Culllvan, re
presenting tbe Texas Industrial Con
gress. Edwin C. Dinwiddle, represent
ing temperance organizations, urged
national prohibition to conserve the
grain supply. Secretary Red field said
in a statement today supporting the
food bills that there was no economic
reason for present high food prices
and that the government would have
to take charge to prevent further
rises.

night in honor of the British and
French war missions to the United
States.
The guests included Arthur James
Balfour, Rene Viviani, Marshal Joffnf
and the two former presidents of the
United States, Theodore Roosevelt
and William Howard Taft.
The distinguished representatives
of America's allies In the war against
Germany arrived at the Waldorf-Astoria
in one party. The streets on
all sides of the hotel were packed
with men and women.
Three Electric Flags
Outlined In electric lights upon tbe
front of tbe hotel were the flags of
tbe three nations represented while
far up and down Fifth Avnue a sea
of flags floating over parellel linea
of patriotic citizens who jammed the
sidewalks on both' sides tor a mile
and a half.
The members of the mission were
escorted first to the great ball room
where a brief reception was held
and then to the grand banquet halL
Stretched across one end of the
banquet hall was a great curtain of
horizon blue. In the center was the
American flag, flanked by the col

the flags of the other allies surround
ing them. Below the flags waa a
copy of a medallion representing
France and England, supported on a
golden panel bearing the now fam

"To make the world safe for dem
ocracy." Menu Is Simple
The menu, one of the simplest
ever served) at a great public dinner
in New York, was limited to five
courses, each one a typically Amer
ican dish and was designed to exem
plify the Spartan simplicity that
should govern the nation in its hour
of danger.
At the close of the banquet Mayor
Mitchel presented to Mr. Balfour
and M. Viviani gold medals emblem
atic of their visit to New York. The
mayor then proposed a toast to the
President of tbe United States. The
diners arose, cheering frantically and

LAUNCH MOVEMENT
TO MAKE COCHISE
BIG BEAN CENTER
Governor Is Requested To Aid
Ranchers In Planting of
Crops; Arizona's National
Delegation Asked For
Seeds.
If the movement Rtarted by the
Warren District Commercial Club is
successful, Cochise county will be
come one of the biggest bean-producing
districts in the state. At a
meeting of the board of directors of
! the club Wednesday night, every
j phase of bean planting, production
I and marketing was discussed. There
are thousands of acres of land in this
county adaptable to bean raising and
the commercial club is going to do
everything in its power to see thai
this land is so used.
Realizing that there are many far
mers who. but for the lack of funds
with which to plant crops, would be
willing to devote their time to raising
-beans an dother vegetables which
face a shortage, the directors decid
ed to write to Governor Thomas
Campbell and ask him if there was
not some way in which the state
i could assist ranchers in planting their
crops and be paid for its efforts af
! ter the crops were harvested. A sim
: Max request has been made of Prof.
R. B. KlinSraid, of the state univer
sity, and it is expected that a huge
1 supply of beans for planting will be
' forthcoming as the result.
Word was also sent to Senator
Harry F. Ashurst and Congressman
Carl Hayden asking that they for
ward at once all of the vegetable
i seeds they could get hold of. The
; regular allotment of seeds sent out
i by Arizona's delegation in Washing
ton several weeks aog was quickly

Are The Successful
Business Men of Today
Buying Oil Stocks
BECAUSE The consumption is 200,000 barrels per day more than the
production and unless more oil is produced in the future, auto
owners and other consumers will be told how many gallons per
per day, they can consume.
BECAUSE The price of oil is advancing and the demand for oil is
growing daily, the cry Is more liquid gold more oil.
BECAUSE Oil has hit the highest mark in history and it is the most
promising business for "big quick clean profits.
When careful conservative business men. men who have made a suc
cess of their business, men who, after thorough investigation, invest
their money in this company then surely it is time for you to in
vestigate the ARIZONA-OKLAHOMA OIL t GAS COMPANY and if
you investigate you will buy.

iame old way, regardless of the fact that the world Is at
v-ar and increased food production Is an imperative nec
essity.
"i Students of Western Reserve University have been

"armers are doing to Increase their outputs. Their re
port shows an interesting Indifference to the situation.
' "No great impression has been made upon their minds
tiy the fact that we are In a state of war," the investigat
ors Bay. "They seem satisfied to let matters stand as
they are and get along' as best they can; In most cases
they are making no effort to increase' the acreage or out
put. Little help is called for because the farmers seem
undecided as to weather conditions and prospects, and
so are afraid to risk paying help, and would prefer to be
let alone."
The farmers "surveyed" are not those of remote rural
sections, but are mostly within a short distance of Clevis
land, where they have a good market for their crops.
They might be supposed to have been affected by the
agitation for larger crops which has been carried on as
extensively in Cleveland as anywhere else In the country.
But it has influenced them little.' City folk, with limited
areas and poor facilities, are doing all they can to help
feed the nation, but the fanners whose particular busi
ness it is are doing no more than usual.
Fortunatley this is not the attitude or all American
farmers. In the West, especially, there is enthusiastic
and concerted effort to stimulate' production. But we
cant help wondering, with' considerable misgiving, how
many farming communities there are like the one report
ed by the Western Reserve investigators, where the' pro
fessional food-producers ar shirking one- of the most
serious duties that ever devolved upon any class of citi
zens'.
WAR" MORTALITY RATES.
An interesting sidelight on the death risk run by Amer
icans' joining the army is given by a committee represent
ing more than 100' insurance companies' which met re
cently in New YorK. This committee recommended that
all American life Insurance companies adopt a uniform
type of policy for" men entering the military and naval
service, and suggested a minimum rate of $37.50 for each
$1,000 of war risk in addition to the regular premium.
The rate is meant to apply to those taking out war In
surance within one month of entering the seWice. If a
man waits' until" he is ordered to the front, when he will
immediately become a greater risk, the rate will be
higher.
This rate of $37.50 per $1,000 means, roughly, that a
man joining the army now' stands about one chance In
27 of dying a military death within twelve months. Or.
to put it the other way, he has about 26 chances out of
27 to get through the first year safe.
Later, of course, if we really get into the fighting on a
big scale, the probability of death will increase. The
Canadian war insurance rates are said to run from $100
to $150 per year. The rate in England is about $200,
which means that a soldier has only one chance out of five
of living through the year.
It is hardly likely that the American rate will ever
rise so high as that. For the present, anyhow, the death
odds give nobody much cause for worry.

BISBEE'S QUOTA.
The people of Bisbee and the Warren District can well
feel proud over the representation accorded this region
in the officers' training camps, soon to be instituted. Nine
men were accepted and have left, or will leave, for the
scene of thir work.
V. M. Marshall. Floyd Allen, A. A. Hopkins, Hubert
D'Autremont. M. S. Lindholm, A. M. Shambaugh, Frank
C. Bropny. H. V. Suttcn and Wayne B. Cave, are the
men who will train for the army.
The Review feels justly proud of every man. Of course
this paper feels espcially proud of its own quota, two men,
who go to the camp. Mr. Cave, who has been night
editor of the Review for the past year, and H. V. Sutton,
Associated Press operator for more than that time, leave
this office for their chosen work.
Both men have been faithful to their trust to the Re
view and can be counted upon to perform their future
work with the same zeal and ability. This may be said,
undoubtedly, of every other man who goes from the War
ren District, and the entire citizenship will join with fiis
newspaper in wishing all of the men:
"Bon Voyage!"
UNIFORMS.
Anybody who expects gold and glitter in connection
with our new armies will be disappointed. There's mighty
little of the ornamental about modern warfare.
Uniforms used to be made to attract attention. No
they're made to escape notice. The plain khaki serves
tills purpose admfrably. And one of the finest thing
about the new system is that it's so genuinely democratic.
Doing away with gold lace, bright colors and other strik
ing insignis abolished nearly all the visible distinctions
of rank. A general now doesn't look much more impos
ing than- a private.
And that's happily in accord with the American idea.
which regards any army as an aggregation of free anil
equal citizens, with some of the citizens giving orders
to the others not because they're superior, but Just be
cause somebody has to do it.
LIGHTHOUSE GARDENS.
The garden movement has reached even those outposts
of safety, the lighthouse. G. R. Putnam, commissioner
of lighthouses, has issued a call to all lighthouse keepers
and others on lighthouse reservations, to cultivate as
much land as possible for growing foods during the
present season.
It sounds like a strange request to those people whose
lives are spent so close to the water. But most light
houses have at least a small plot of grouud that is kept
attractive with crass and flowers. And there may be
some that have a good deal of land within easy reach.
If the soil is fit for cultivation, there is no reason why
It should not be used for producing vegetables this year
It would be interesting to know just how many acres of
lighthouse gardens there will be.

NEW YORK. MAY 11'. Oreat as
have been the surgical achievements
in the course of the present war,
there has been as yet no single dis
covery that has rivaled Dr. Alexis
Carrel's method of the treatment of
peptic wounds as the most notable ad
dition to surgical science, according
to a senior surgeon of the American
Ambulance Hospital at Neuilly, near
Paris, who has just returned to this
country. "The French hospitals are
slowly adopting the Carrel method,"
he said, "and in the American Ambu
lance Hospital we have been using it
for several months with gratifying
results which. seem to show that Dr.
Carrel has proved his thesis.
"The reduction of septic wound
treatment to an almost mathematical
basis is a feature of the Carrel meth
od that suggests the fanciful thought
of the possibility that the day may
come when a surgeon's work will In
some results be like that of a train
dispatcher. Having brought to him
from dey to day the microscopic
count of the germs in a given wound,'
the surgeon may perhaps figure with
preclseness the day on which the
wound will be in shape to close com
pletely. The two-hourly irrigation of
the wound by the Dakin or other so
lution, is a highly important feature
of the Carrel method, but the most
interesting factor is the daily micro
scopic count of the germs. These
irerms are taken from given areas of
the wound, placed under a micro
scope and counted, and from this
count the progress of the healing is
euaged. There are perhaps less
germs today than yesterday, so many
less tomorrow: and so the rate of
the diminishing suppuration is estab
lished. The surgeon, almost without
lroking at the wound, can determine,
when the count gets down to a given
nurber. that it is safe to close it.
"The American Ambluance Hospi
tal is the best single thing which
America can do for France." he said.
The hospital has been at all times
since its establishment two years ago
one of the best hospitals in the
world; it enjoys the confidence of the
French Sanitary Service to such a
degree that it ordinarily receives only
the most difficult cases. The most
severe shell wounds are constantly
encountered. There are scores of
young American surgeons wno, irom
time to time serving at the hospital.
have become familiar with these
phases of surgery. They may rarely
have occasion to use this knowledge
in their ordinary- civilian practice 8t
home, but should the United States
be at war within the next generation
it will find that many of its surgeons
in civilian practice are acquainted
with every sort of wound now known
in warfare. At the hospital! further,
there has been constant co-operation
between the surgeons and dentists.
An ordinary operation is that of
grafting bone cut from the tibia or
shin-bone into the lower jaw. I have
seen voung soldiers so frightfully
wounded in the face that had they
been my sons I should have almost
preferred they should have died, but
it is not for the surgeons to let the
spark of life be extinguished through
neglect of surgical science.
"The appreciation, gratitude and
entire simplicity of the wounded
French soldier is something that
'gets one' absolutely. I have never
seen the slightest resemblance to
anything that could be called bravado
in his makeup. The American sur
geons feel that they cannot be kind
enough to the soldiers.
"All through France the efficiency
of the American Ambulance Hospi
tal has become known, and distinr
guished surgical men are daily visi
tors. They come not only from the
French hospitals, but from all of the
niiipd and neutral countries, exam
ining with particular interest the
many forms of special apparatus
which the Americans have developed
for the management of factured ex
tremities. These devics have been
originated and Improved upon largely
by the younger members of our surgi
cal staff. When a young surgeon
tomes to us from America for ser
vice at the hospital he is assigned
to a ward with a request that he im
prove, the apparatus and it is rarely
that he fails to do so. It has been
wonderful for the older men to see
how readily and successfully xne
younger men have taken up this
work.
"There are probably 1500 wounded
soldiers under the American Ambu
lance surgeons at this moment. There
are 575 in the hospital at Neuilly.
and a thousand and more In auxil

50,000 BRITISH
TROOPS PARADE FOR
CANADIAN PREMIER
(By Review Leased Wire).
The biggest "show" staged in Eng
land during the world war was put
on here the other day in honor of
the Canadian Premier, Sir Robert
Forden, by thousands of his fellow
countrymen in khaki. It included an
exhibition of all phases of training
by infantry and artillery, gas-helmet
drills, bayonet practice trench-fighting,
bombing, signalling and ended
ith a review of about 50.000 troops.
The bad weather kept the areoplanes
3 way but there were plenty of good
sized bombs to represent the noise
cf howitzers.
The "show" was the nearest thing
to .a good sized battle that can be
s-aged without a real enemy. It was
the daily practice on a larger scale
:n honor of the Canadian statesmen.
The men never call it a battle; they
lways refer to this business of mod--rn
warfare as a "show." Sir Robert
-'marked at the end that it was the
test "show" of its kind he had ever
witnessed.
PerhaDS the most interesting phase
of the spectacle was the trench-fight
ing. Real trenches with plenty oi
rarbed wire entanglements in front
-f them were taken by waves of in
fantrymen armed with rifles with
fixed bayonets. Bcmhs were explod
ed before the trenches to indicate a
barrage fire. After the infantry cap- '
tured the trenches rockets were sent (
up as signals to the artillery: "ass
were also hoisted over the trenches
to indicate that they had been taken j
and were being consolidated. A few ;
moments later a messenger brought j
a dispatch to the commanding offi-:
rer in the rear stating that the ob- j
jective had been taken and was be
ing held. This process was repeated

PHOPHESIED BY HiNTZE
until the whale series of trenches
were taken.
Another feature was the mining'
operations and the explosion of the
mines in the enemy's works. Bomb
explosions throwing huge quantities
of soil into the air gave a very real
istic touch to this part of the opera
tions. All the time this was in pro
gress the men In the captured
trenches were busy bombing the en
emy in other trenches by means of
hand grenades which exploded with
deafening reports. Still another phase
of the "show" was the bayoneting of
dummy enemies on the parapets of
trenches.
The affair came to a 'close' on
great plain where the Premier
viewed the troops, pinned medals on
five privates for bravery during the
battle of the Somme and then called
all the men around his reviewing
stand and gave them a' heart-to-heart
talk. 'Sir Robert expressed to them
the admiration of the people of the
Dominion and said he knew they
they would cover themselves witjl
glory in the trying days yet to come

Hopkins Called
If, at the end of three months train
ing at the Presidio, he is given a com
mission, Cave intends to stick with
the army for the rest of his days, and
his many friends in Kansas, Califor
nia and Arizona have no d'oubt but
what he will develop into the kind of
an officer that Uncle Sam will have
cause to be proud of.
A. A. Hopkins, of Warren, has been
connected for considerable time with
the government. He served in the
Spaniiih-American war and was also
a member of the Arizona Kangers.
D'Autren.'ont, a member of the firm of
Knapp & D'AuiremoTit, C. & A. attor
neys, is one of the most popular fel
lows in the district and his friends
predict that inside of two days he will
be judge advocate general at the
camp, if not for the entire army.
Lindholm is a Copper Queen engineer
and Shambaugh was for many years
a member of the Bis' ee High School
faculty.
Other residents Vf this part of the
state recently ordered to the camp
are Sheriff Harry Wheeler, Floyd Al
len, Frank Brophy, V. M. Marshal and
E. H. Broughton.
Sutton Also Going.
Another member of the Dally Re
view staff, Herbert V. Sutton, has re
ceived orders from Washington to re
port to F'ort Sam Houston to take an
examination for commission in tht
signal corps. "Sut" has been a resi
dent of Bisbee for two years, coming
here from California. He is by no
means a novice at the 'military game,
having put in five years with the
signal corps in the Philippines and
seven years with the postoffice de
partment, serving as wire chief at
Manila and cable engineer throughout
the islands. For more than a year
"Sut" has handled the Daily Review's
Associated Press leased wire and
leaves the "A. P." only after turning
down several flattering offers. "Sut"
has always become nervous at the
sight of the old, familiar khaki uni
form, and, when he announced that
he was going back in again and do
his part to help squelch the Germans,
it did not .surprise the Review force.
Sutton will leave for Fort Sam Hous
ton within a few days to take his ex
amination. Guardsmen to Go.
G. II. Reed, of the First Arizona in
fantry, has also been ordered to San
Francisco. Reed was formerly cap
tain in the Philippine Scouts and ha
been recently connected with the in
telligence department of the First
Arizona at Naco. Reed speaks sev
eral foreign languages, is well up in
military tactics and made an enviable
record during his service in the Phil
ippines. Other members of the First
Arizona chosen to attend the camp
are Sergeant Gundry, A company;
Bugler Thompson and Private Mar
shall Brockman, machine gun com
pany. All will leave tonight. Other
guardsmen who will attend the camp
have not yet been announced.
Although the seventy applicants
from the district who were not chosen
to attend the camp are sorely disap
pointed, they are counting strongly
on another camp being established in
this part of the country, the govern
ment having given assurance that,
when such a. camp is ordered, the ap
plicants who were not selected for the
Presidio, will be given first chance at

to lake the necessary means to mo
tolize the agricultural resources of
this nation for victory. They are
urging every specious, thearetical
and imaginary argument against the
granting of war powers to the Presi
dent find his cabinet, and they are
at present directing their principal
attack against the laws which have
been introduced by the agricultural
committee of the house with a view
to putting the department of agricul
ture on a war basis. That step
should have been taken several weeks
ago. The bills now before congress
were drawn up after the department
of agriculture had consulted with
every agricultural college in the
United States, with every state de
partment of agriculture, with every
asricultural paper or magazine and
with experts familiar with the expe
rience of Europe during the past
three years. The additional powers
asked for are powers which are pos
sessed and exercised by the govern
ments of every European nation now
at war. They have been demon
strated to be absolutely essential
war power.
"The unpatriotic an ddisloyal lobby
that is trying to dereat the determin
ation of congress and the people of
this country to put the agricultural
resources of this country on an ef
fective basis should be made to feel
the condemnation of every real American.

"I have been deeply impressed,"

the absolute confidence of American
naval officers in their being able to
cope with the submarine war and I

This was followed by a toast to
the French republic which was drunk
to the strains of the "Marseillaise"
and then there was another toast to
the President of France.
Joseph H. Choate, who followed the
mayor, referred to "those dear allies
of ours. Great Britain, our beloved
mother country, and France, our
fascinating, hypnotizing sister."
Balfour Stirs Hearers
Mr. Balfour stirred his hearers to
high enthusiasm when he said:
"We have not come here as in
structors of the American republic,
but it is important for me to proclaim
my inalterable conviction that we
have reached a crisis when the whole
of civilization must rise up and voice
its appeal for the preservation of hu
man liberty.
'What has brought us together?"
he asked. "What is) the meaning to
be found in the crowding of your
streets in welcome to us?"
The answer lay in the fact, be said.
that America has felt the menace
of German autocracy, which he char
acterized as an "imminent and over
mastering peril."
'What is that peril?" .Mr. Balfour
continued. "I will tell you, it is the
calculating and remorseless use of
civilized weapon to carry out the
ends of pure barbarism.
Different Lesson Tonight

every means of science, not to better 1
their own people, but to dominate

by considerations of humanity. We;

said, not only by militarism, but by

"We urge that all imperial, state

denominations and persons without
regard to religious opinion. We ask
that no German, be compelled to take
an oath before a court of law, the
terms of which may be contrary to
his conscientious scruples. W de
mand that no German be compelled
to send his children to religious in
struction at school. We recommend
that all Germans, whether orthodox
believers or not. provide only that
they educate their children properly
In moral principles, patriotism, the
duty of neighborliness and charity,
shall be regarded as on complete
equality, and freed from state regu
