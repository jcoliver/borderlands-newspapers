military circles the same Impression
prevailed today.
Think Ypres Objective
Dispatches indicate that the fiercest
fighting is on the northern line of the
new salient driven into the Brili0
front north of Arras. The struggle
for possession of Neueve Englise and
towns in that region looks to observ
ers here like an effort by the enemy
to force a way behind Ypres and tho
consequent abandoment of that place
and a withdrawal of a large section o"
the ISritish line. The Germans were

captured it only to ? driven out
again. Every hour gained by the Brit
ish in holding on this particular front
means increased probability that they

forces in sufficient sirengtb to meet
any sho k. Or thould a withdrawal
and re-alignment on better positions

opportuniiy for the preparation of

Foch Await Issuo,
It is possible that the plans of -Gen-'
eral Foch, commander-in-chief of al
lied and America Barmles in France
hinge upon developments in this nar

to have succeeded i neffecting such
a stabilization. Presumably any plans
for counter offensive would be de
pendent upon these two positions.
There is no question but that many
officers view the situation as serious.
They dn not all share the hopeful out
look indicated by the war college re
view fr iast week. Even if the rres
ent thriist toward Rethune is cliecked,
they believe a third assault at some

' ' wuiiimuiy
Seven days after the Germans
launched their gigantic assault against
the British lines between Lens and
Ypres, the momentum of their attack
has been broken and the waves of the
Teutonic forces are recoiling before
the rock of the British defense. While
the Germans have ma tie gains ot
ground and have driven a wedge into
the allied lines, to a considerable
depth, they seem to have failed in
their attempt to break through or take
important railroad junctions.
During the last day there have been
j bitterlv fought engagements in four
1 piaces, all on the northern side of the
; 8aiiPnt to the south of Ypres. Seven
, assaults against the British trenches

Bailleul and Wulverghm. between

been the scenes of hard fighting, hut
except for Neuve Englise, the north
ern side of the salient has stood firm.
On the southern side of the salient, ac
cording to Berlin, fierce struggles
have been fought.
It has been the German plan of
camoaicn since March 21. when the
great offensive started, to strike hard
at some particular sector and if that
blow was parried, to turn powerfully
against some new point. This proce
dure probably will be followed In the
next few days by a new assault some
where south of Arras. An attack
north of Ypres is hardly possible, for
the lowalands of Belgium are as yet
too water logged to permit active op
erations. Expect Amiens Attack.
An attack on Arras would entail
the hurling of troops against Vimy
ridge; the labhyranthe and other for
midable works protecting that city.
It may be that the savage fighting
reported at Hangard - En - Santerre,
south of a Albert and on the center
of the line facing Amiens, may mark
the beginning of a new attempt to
sweep westward against Amiens. So
far the fighting has brought the Ger
mans only losses in men and ground.
Further south, near Montdidler. there
has been intense artillery firing, hut
the Geinians have not attempted in

sector.

WITH THE BRITISH All MY IN
FRANCE. April 15 (By the Associ
ated Press) The Britis hyesterilay
recaptured Arrewage, just east of
the Nieppe forest. This whole area
is reported full of German dead who
fell in the liar dfishting. South of
here, at Cornet MK. east of St.
HorK the Germans yesterday le.
livered four fierce attacks. All were
repulsed with heUvy losses to the
attacking troops.
Would Take Bailleul
The fighting here has been con
tinuous and the British are holding
Cornet Malo with machine guns
trained from house windows. These
rapid firers have done great w-ork i:i
the enemy's ranks. At one time the
enemy got a foothold in the hamlet,
but machine gunners got in on the
advancing troops and smashed them
badly.
The Importance which the Ceraian.
attach to Bailleul had added eontirm
ationi on Saturday night, when iroopi
were sent into the attack with orders
that they must capture the Metereu
Ballleul highway at all costs. They
paid in advance, but did not get what
thev were after. Here again the ma
chine guns reaped a harvest.
The trend of operations in the nor
thern battle may he seen from the
number of troops the Germans have
been using since the opening of the
struggle. On April 9. when the at
tack began, they were using 11 di
visions in the line. On April 10. this
was int-reawed to 13: on April 11 and
12 to 20: Aprlf U to 21 and April I I
to 23, other divisions being h:M-l in
reserve.
Fifty Per Cent Lost
From the southern battle front
comes word that German officers of
the 2-tth reserve division captured at
Hangard wood April 7. stated that the
casualties of the German forces en
gaged on this front averaged fifty
per cent since the attack began. In
addition tbe enemy -.uffered much,
trom transport trouble and shortage
of food and ammunition. This tvas
partly due to the great number of
horses killed and the bad condition
of the rest.
The Germans occupied a shambles
when they took Neuve Englise. The
contending forces, who had been bat
tling bitterly for days had been ask
ing and giving no quarters. Several
times the shell torn village changed
hands. On each occasion it was a
struggle to the death with bayonets as
the troops swirled in a mad melee
through the crimsoned streets.
Pile Up German Dead
Afl"r the Mritish recaptured the
place on Saturday they continued to
hold it with n hollow square of
troops thrown around it. The matse 1
Germans kept flinging themselves
against this thin but determine! line
of defenders. The battle went on un
til late last night, when the pressure
from overwhelming enemy forces be
came too great and the weary aquar?
of khaki dissolved to reform in new
positions a little jnorthwest of ih?
town. Even then the Germans fi.nnd
themselves in a desperate situation,
for Mritish artillery opened a Jremen
dous bombardment and began piling
up German dead with those who had
gone before.

BIRTH OF A NATION

The Clansman at the Central theater
today deals more broadly, on its his
torical side, with the life of the Amer
ican ration than does the play or
book by Thos. Dixon, Jr., or which it
is based. It presents a problem
which is still unsolved in the South
the problem of race conditions, and if
it also conveys to the mind the rav
ages of war, it is to the end' that war
j may be held in abhorrence and uni
versal peace promoted.
I The Clansman photo-drama deals
Tuc- j with the American Civil War and the
I Reconstruction period. It shows the
! can'.cs that led up to this conflict and
'can-its the spectator through the war
land the revolution that followed. It
treats impartially the causes for
which each side was struggling and in
dicates the political conditions in both
the North and the South during these
sinigpies.
The Central theater has arranged
for a special .night shift men's mat
inee for tomorrow afternoon at 11

A Simple Answer
I To a Great Question
. ; ; . -J
"Where does Germany get her reserves
and guns and shells for two such terrific
drives as she has launched since March 21
against the badly battered British army?"
The question i3 being asked upon every
side, and often in amazement and occasion
ally with fear, by many citizens of the Wer
ren district. The answer is simple. Answ
ers to most great questions are simple. Ger
many has concentrated every ounce of man
and industrial power of her domains and
those of her three powerful allies with
which to make this supreme effort. That
is Germany's long suit concentration. One
head directs everything for four nations.
The resources of the empire have been as
sembled at two points opposite the British
lines and have been hurled at the British
armies. This is the whole story. German
generalship, as represented and made con
crete by concentration, has been before
hand with the allies this year.
England's full force is not assembled in
Picardy and Flanders!
Not even France (although more so than
any of the other allie3, has her every ounce
of industrial and military power yet concen
trated for a supreme effort !
America has not one-fourth of her pow
er yet concentrated upon preparation !
Germany is in grim and awful earnest.
She is pouring her troops into the volcano
of war with a fearful purpose. She is strik
ing with her full strength, first at one spot,
and then at another. No half way ground
with Germany. Heavy losses do not deter
her; great sacrifices are counted as nothing
when weighed against achievement. She
has concentrated the brains of her empire
to provide the means, and the brawn to
forge and slay. What is the result? Four
nations welded into blue steel, needle point
ed and having the driving force of every
mind and arm that calls the kaiser ordained
king.
And one-fourth of the British nation has
vithstood its shock, bent back and battered
sadly, pitting valor and spirit against the
machine. Lacking either the genius of
concentration or the deadly earnestness to
inspire it, the English nation is sending her
troops forward to fight against odds, when
in right and reason, the odds should be in
their favor three to one.
People generally are prone to their er
ror of assuming that Germany is fighting
alone against the world; that her staff and
generals and gunmakers and soldiers and
scientists are supermen. Far from it. They
are merely in earnest, that is all. Every
thought and act and effort of every soul in
Germany is to win this war. And she has
nearly a million Bulgarian soldiers and over
two million Austrians and nearly two mil
lion Turks in arms against England, Italy
and France. Down in Greece an allied
army of a million men, sent thousands of
miles over seas, are standing in armed line
against Bulgars, Turks and Austrians.
These men must be fed and munitioned
from distant bases. In Italy thousands of
English and I rench troops are fighting the
Ausfcfians who are lined up a million strong
north of the Lombard plains. Hundreds of
thousands of English troops are in England.
But the entire and united strength of Ger
many is on the western fighting line ord
ered under pain cf death to strike, and keep
on striking, no matter what the cost ; driven
relentlessly by an iron discipline that
brooks no fa'.l.rir.g or failure except from
dead or mangled men.
And so it is that Germany makes head
against the allied forces. And she will con
tinue to batter and bully and brag until her
three cjreat opponents throw their very all
into the stenn. Not until this is done will
the world be able to truly gauge the power
of the Gcrrruiii arms. Man for man the
Trench nr,d Enuiish have outfought the
core
And.
it in 1" landers and at Verdun.
voundcd by thebe recent terri
ble thrusts, the allies are roused as never
before. It is late, but not too late. The
tide in France will turn. The nation that
lives by the sword shall die by the sword.
The war flame of Germany is kindling a
greater war flame that will consume the
smaller one. These are dark days, but there
are unfailing signs of a light in the sky.
After three years of war the allies have
been united by the very onrush that was
launched to destroy them.
THAT MEXICAN UNDERGROUND.
Again the Mexican underground of the
kaiser has loomed up. Admitted a menace
for the past year, known to have existed
since a date prior to the declaration of war
between the United States and Germany,
recognized as the route through which a
large part of the Hun espionage Is accom
plished, it has bobbed up before us this time
simultaneously at points' in California and
texas. .
A woman, operating the underground
discovered in Texas, has been indicted on
four counts by the federad courts on
charges of espionage. The indictments
charge the woman with seeking informa
tion for the use of Germany on a military
reservation through entering the reserva
tion, attempting to secure photographs of
the camps, and requesting data of military
nature from enlisted men of the United
states army.
The opening of the underground in Cal
ifornia was much more grave. A sailor
was arrested at Martinez. He had served
on the German raider Leipsic. He carried
his diary of the raider's activities and in
the diary were discovered details of a sys
tematic espionage system directed by a
German vice consul in Mexico. Peter's
duties included a daily report to German
officials of departures and destinations of
vessels and of war preparations in this
country. Detailed maps cf the coast forti
fications at San Francisco and Seattle har
bors were among the papers taken from
him. The sailor has been ordered interned
for the period of the war as a dangerous
alien enemy.
The significant points at issue in these
instances of the discovery again of the Teu
ton espionage route into Mexico, are these
both the woman and man have been in
Arizona within the past few weeks. Fhe
woman made her way across the state from
the Pacific coast, stopping several times.
The man came from California, remained
in the state only a few days, and returned
to his base of operations. Neither was de
tained in the state. Neither wa3 question
ed. Neither was suspicioned, probably, but
both were on the same mission.
Is it not possible to call a halt to this
Prussian activity? Has not the day arrived
when the state should take a hand in assist
ing the government, when state, county
and municipal officers should be authorized
to scrutinize all strangers, when every man
and woman should be called on to give
satisfactory account of his or her business?
Does not the safety of the state and nation
demand the enactment in this country of
laws as stringent and far-reaching as the
military laws of the nation with which we
are at war?
The governor holds within his powers
the means to lend this hand of assistance to
the government. He will call a special ses
sion of the legislature soon. He should in
clude in his call a provision for the enact
ment of a sedition law so drastic as to reach
all classes of pro-Germans including the
professional agitator, the pacifist, the I. W.
W. and the malcontent ; and to enable offi
cers of the law to search out these charac
ters he should propose the abolition of the
anti-blacklist law and in it3 place the enact
ment of a statute conferring on all citizens
the right to question the business of strang
ers within the bounds of the state.
The latest slogan is, Buy your winter
coal now! And it is an important and
timely call. If the fuel famine of last
winter is to be avoided next winter the
mines must be operated every day thi3 sum-,
mer. Now coal cannot be stored at the
mines, nor can it be kept over the summer
season by dealers in sufficient quantities.
Therefore the consumer must buy now and
store his coal for future use. The fuel ad
ministration is urging it. War pressure
demand it. And then besides coal is much
cheaper now than it will be next fall.
They jailed eighty-two alien enemies in
Milwaukee on the Rhine this last week and
have warrants out for two hundred more.
The flame of patriotism has never burned
so brightly in this land as since Von Hind
enburg started his last and ferocious drive
of conquest.
FINAL LYCEUM DATE
AT HIGH SCHOOL IS
THOMAS B. FLETCHER
The final number of the lyceura
course will occur at the high school
auditorium this evening at S:15
o'clock.
The course this year suffered a
stttpek during the period when the
district was under quarrantine. Some
of the biggest drawing cards were
scheduled for that week and the fail
ure to have those attractions put the
management of the course a little be
hind. However, the event tonight is
expected to bring out the largest
crowd that has yet attended any of
tre numbers.
Thomas Brooks Fletcher will do
the entei taining this evening and from
all reports he is the best number for
the whole season. Fletcher was on
the program last year and all who
heard him went away satisfied that
they had h?ard the greatest of all
modern orators. He has a method
that carries his audience away with
Um whether it is In laughter or in
fame more serious mood. It was the
hit he made with the audience last
year that led to his being booked here
pgain this year.
The following Is a letter that was
written from one lecture course man
ager to another in Xenia, Ohio, con-
erning Fletcher:
"Mr. C. G. Whitmer,

"Mr. Fletcher came to us last night

CHICAGO, April 15. Increased re
ceipts had much to do with weakness
which today characterized the corn
market. Prices closed unsettled at
127 for May and 149 to 149 for
July, with the market as a whole
off to advance, compared with Sat
urday's finish. Oats gained to
rent and provisions a to 15 cents.
Notwithstanding rallies, due to profit
taking by shorts, the corn market
averaged decidedly lower, the greater
part of the day. In addition 'o the
liberal supplies which crowded the
sample tables, country advances of
shipments appeared to indicate a con
tinued free movement to terminal
markets.
The fact that Toledo was sending

LET OFF LIGHT.
John Kollotki was sentenced yes
terday in the federal court at Tuc
son to one day in jail, on a charge
of violating the Reed amendment
Kolloski had a series of experiences
which should dissuade him from con
necting up with alcohol in any form
for some time.
He was first arrested in Cochise for
bringing liquor into the county and
was fined $200 and sentenced to serve
one hundred dajs in jail there. After
he paid the fine and served the sen
tence he was brought to Tucson ou
a charge of having violated the Reel
amendment against importation of
of liquar into a dry stute. In con
sideration of the fact that the liquor
was that in which he was involved
in Cocblse and he had been adequate
ly penalized for it, the court deicded
to make the sentence light

CAMP WILL BE MOVED.
Arrangements are being made by
Assistant State Engineer Cy Perkins
to move the state road camp between
here and Tombstone to within half a
mite of Tombstone. The new site will
be clcse to where the big bridge is to
be built and work will be started on
that at oncei The moving of the
camp will be the means of savin? ot
considerable time and expense. Water
will be piped to the camp, which is
l'ow hauled about six miles. And the
time and labor o fhauling other rup
plies will be greatly reduced. There
ere now twenty-rive men at the camp
and others are needed and the S. O. S.
call has been sent out for recruits.
The camp needs from twenty-fivo to
thirty men in order to run the camp
in an economical manner and make it
l,ay. This is the first time that the
number of men have reached such a
Iow figure and it was brought .about
by the objection of the Douglas Purity
Spuad to working bootleggers and al
lowing them extra time for working
on the road. There are now ten men
in the county pail at Tombstone eat
ing at the expense of the taxpayors
that could be sent to the road camp
rnd the taxpayers saved the expense
of their keep, and the county derive
the benefit of their labors and the
state pay the expense.
highest for the reason that it has proV'
en to be just the remedy needed in
thousands upon thousands of distress
ing cases. Swamp-Root, a physician's
prescription for special diseases, makes
friends quickly because its mild and
immediate effect is soon realized in
most cases. It is a gentle, healing veg
etable compound.
Start treatment at once. Sold at all
drug stores in bottles of two sizes, me

To look one's best and feel one's best
is to enjoy an inside bath each morn

and poisonous toxins before it is ab
sorbed into the blood. Just as coal,
when it burns, leaves behind a erlain
amount of incombustible material in
the form of ashes, so the food and
drink taken each day leave in the ali

indigestible material, which if not

through the very ducts which are in

If you want to bee the glow of
healthy bloom in your cheeks, to see
your skin get clearer and clearer, you
are told to drink every morning upon
arising, a glass of hot water with a
teaspoon ful of limestone phosphates
in it, which is a harmless means of
washing the waste material and toxins
from the stomach, liver, kidneys and
bowels, before putting more tood into
the stomach.
.Men and women with sallow skins,
liver spots, pimples or pallid complex

others who are bothered with head
aches, biliotiH spells, ac id stomach or
constipation should begin this phos

A quarter pound of limestone phos

STATE TO ORGANIZE
UNIFORM ACCOUNTING
IN ALL DEPARTMENTS
Uniform systems of accounting will
be organized and introduced in ail de
partments of ttie state, and the ex
penuiture ol state ana county funds
will be made entirely on budget sys
tems, if tne plan now being worned
out by VV. H. Rouudtree, staie exam
iner, and other officials of Arizona,
is linaliy adopted. Mr. Rouutree, no
spent Sunday in this district, declares
mat plans tor the introduction K the
new system have been perfected ana
that eiforts will soon be maue to be
gin installation.
Under the present system of ac
counting, declares the state examiner,
many eirors may creep into the books,
tne accuracy of accounts cannot be
maintained with precision, and ex
tra agance is permitted. No plan for
expenditures is made, there is no cen
tral accounting or control of expen
uitures and in general the system, says
the examiner, is weak.
Under the system proposed by the
state ot-'icials the counting will be so
centralized that at any time definite
figures of money expended, results at
tained, and funds on hand and ap
propriated may be had. In adddition,
the system will provide closer rela
tions between departments of govern
ment, making for more efficiency in
every direction.
Plans of the state officers are to
inaugurate the ne wsystem first in all
schools o fthe state under the county
school superintendents. Later the
work will be expended until finally it
has taken in all departments of gov
ernment. The officials nave been
working on the plans for some time.
STAR PERFORMS ON
GLASS TOP TABLE
A dance on a glass-topped table is
periormed by Emily Stevens, the star
in Alias Mrs. Jessop," a Metro won
derplay, which will be the attraction
at the Orpheum theater, on today. In
this picture Miss Stevens plays a dual
role, one a proper and demure girl
and the other wilfuland uncontrolled.
It is &s Lillian Ford, the frivolous girl,
that the star dances.
Alter the performance of a girl
dancer, which all the guests are eager
ly applauding, Lillian jumps up on the
top of the glass-topped table. Gath
ering her lacy draperies about her
feet, she imitates the motion of the
dancer.' who has preceded her. A
dramatic scene takes place at a crit
ical moment when Sir Anthouny Jes
sop returns unexpectedly.
Tucson will have a $50,000 public
market
In three years Holbrook population
has doubled.

a Little Musterole. ?
And Musterole won't blister like the
old-fashioned mustard plaster. Just
spread it on with your fingers. It pene
trates to the sore spot with a gentle
tingle, loosens the congestion and draws
out the soreness and pain.
Musterole is a dean, white ointment
made with oil of mustard. It is fine for
quick relief from sore throat, bronchitis,
tonsihtiv croup, stiff neck, asthma, neu
ralgia, headache, congestion, pleurisy,
rheumatism, lumbago, pains and aches of

fier known, and contains no minerals

cate skin.

of those unsightly and disfiguring
pimples, and other skin irritations.
And it will cleanse yourblood thor
oughly. If you wish special medical
advice, you can obtain it without
charge by writing to Medical Direc
tor, 29 Swift Laboratory, Atlanta,
