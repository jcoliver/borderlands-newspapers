garia is definitely out of the war
and Turkey, virtually cut off from
communication with her allies and
her armies in Palestine almost
annihilated, likely soon will be
forced to sue for a cessation of
hostilities against her.
Meanwhile the entente allied
forces from Belgium to Verdun
on six tattle fronts are register
ing victory after victory over the
Teutonic armies, and the enemy
front almost everywhere is crumb
ling, notwithstanding the des
perate resistance that is being of
fered on various sectors.
Seeing eventual defeat staring her
in the face through the swift progress
of the Serbian, Italian, British, Greek
and French troops in the reclaiming
of Serbia and the invasion of Bulgar
ian territory, the Bulgarians begged
for an armistice, reserving t.j them
selves no -.iditions. All the territory
now hold by King Fcniii.ar.d now is to
be evacuated; the Bulgarian army is
to be immediately demobilized and all
means of transportation inside tho
kingdom even along the Danube, S3 to
be given over into allied hands.

PARADE WILL BE
BIGGEST EVER
Women of District, Headed by
Mrs. Sam Frankenberg, Will
Speed Up Liberty Bond
Campaign That way
"It is so hard to get up and car- ,
ry through a big parade in Bisbee." !,
wailed a Warren district citizen the
other day. when the matter of the !;
big Liberty bond parade was first
mentioned. But Mrs. Sam Frank- :
enburg. rhairman of the Bisbee lj
branch of the Women's Loan com- '1
mittee, does not think so. Anyway. J
she is going ahead with the firm :
faith and high confidence that the ;
parade cf next Saturday evening is j;
gcini, to be the biggest thing of the ,
kind tver held in Arizona since ;i
tee Rough Riders won the Spanish ;j
war. ;
And to hear the women who ar be
hind the parade talk, and to note their
plans, one cannot help but believe
that, after all, it takes the women to 1
get the marchers out and the banners j
flying and the martial spirit and en-
thusiasm running high.
Word has come from the state head-j
quarters at Phoenix that Saturday,;
August five, is to be the women's day
In the big bond drive, and it is to be I
capped and crowned by monster pa-j
rades everywhere. And shall the War-
ren d!strict lag behind? Not much! 1
The "lag" was left out of our feeti
when we came to this canyon to build
a cltv between the battlements of the
1 peaks.
i Look! Listen! The parade will
1 start at 7 o'clock, or as soon there-!
i after as possible. The faithful old C ,
and A. band will lead it on the way.!
, It is expected that every wife and
I mother and sister of an enlisted man!
i ww-f 1 1 march behind the band in the!
place of honor. The head of every
; war work body in the district will be
j there, and do you know that there
' are many war work bodies In this
j district? And every worker of every
K.dy is expected to be there. They
I Ought to be there. It Is their duty!

WASHINGTON, Sept. 30. The
drawing of odd numbers for the 13,
000,000 draft registrants enrolled Sept.
12. was started today bv President
Wiison. Blindfolded, the president !
groped into the great glass lottery
bowl and drew out one of the 17,000 I
capsules. It contained a slip number-
ed 322, thus giving to men holding that
serial number first place in their re-;
spective class after registrants clas;- '
lied under previous registrations. The

list of every local draft boar ! the j

ice President Marshall drew the ,

sixteen other notables who had been I
iu ited to take part. Officers and ea-1
listed men of the army, assisted by a
corps of tellers, then settled down to '
thifttask of emptying the bowl. Two 1
thousand numbers had been drawn 1
and recorded before 4 o'clock, indicat- j
ing that probably thirty-six hours ,
would be required to complete the j
work. The drawing continued almost j
without interruption through the
night. "i
Only the first hundred numbers!
were flashed to the country by tele-;
graph. Because of the impracticabil-'
Ity of telegraphing all of the 17,000 1
the press had been asked to refrain
from sending more than 100 numbers, j
The complete master lists will be ;
mailed as soon as the drawing is over
to district draft boards throughout the
country to be made public by them.
There was an interested crowd to I
witness the opening ceremony, but the
interest was rather in thj participa-1
tion than in the drawing itself, for the :
c'assif ication system which deter
mnies the status 01' t'.ie registrants'
has made the order number relatively
unimportant. I
The president, with Mr. Wilson, I
reached the caucus room just before
noon. All was in readiness for ta I
drawing, including a battery of cam
eras that readied across tim room di-1

blindfold, made from a slip of cloth I
that covered a chair used In the sign-1

ly quiet night. Reports from every
section of the front indicates that the
Germans intend to continue making a
stand along the present line instead
of going back to the Kreimhilde line,
although they are making feverish ef
fcrts to strengthen that position.
To Jicld his present positions the
enemy is bringing ur reserves and
preparing in other ways for an organ
ized resistance. Great activity behind
the German lines is observed, trains
and wagons bringing up reserves and
supplies simultaneously. The enemy
is shelling the American back areas
heavily, especially the roads leading to
Montfaucon along the center of the
sector.
Just to the right of the American
center the enemy concentrated heavy
and light artillery and also threw in
shock troops.
After only four days of rest Ger
man divisions returned to the line
Sunday either for t.'ie purpose of coun
ter attacking or supporting those al

strong bodies of German infantry mov

Activity, though general, was heav

along the latter position the artillery
fire ceased in the early morning
hours.
CLEAR OUT FOREST
WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
NORTHWEST OF VERDUN, Sept. 30
(By the Associated Press) Noon. The
Germans on the extreme left of the
Argonne forest yesterday evening fil
tered through the American lines in
same places with machine guns and
-attempted to attack Pershing's men
from behind. The advance of the
Americans consequently was delayed
by the necessity of clearing out that
portion of the fcrest.
Aerial activity continues despite the
rainy weather. American pursuit
groups making sorties from early
morning until dark have accounted for
twenty German machines and seven
teen balloons in the last three days.
The American pilots continue to fly
low over the battle field and harass
the troops and supply movements.
American bombing squadrons got gond
results yesterday at Grand-Pre and at
Marcq. southeast of the former place.

NORTHWEST OF VERDUN. Sunday.
Sept. 29 (By the Associated Press).---At

Americans were separated from the

This was on a small sector about'ene
third of a mile in length.
After tefb. isides li3d used their
rifles and pis'.cls to no apparent ad
vantage, a battle of hand grenades
began. As though they were throw

both sides began to hurl bombs. It
was a contest that could not las: long.
The Germans soon had enough of it
and fell luck to positions beyond the

three airplanes and two balloons in
ten minutes, is an expert at yetting
the balloons in their beds, dropping
within 150 feet of the berth to do it
and bting blissfully indifferent to the
riddling of his wings with bullets. In
one instance he pounced upon a hal
lcon, being placidly tewed to its posi
tion behind its lorry. Before the
drivers were aware cf it the gas bag
was in flames behind them.
One pursuit group had Co victims
to its credit within three weeks of Its
arirval at the front. 35 of these being
balloons.
The German balloon has become
quite a rarity on this front any time
after noon and those that survive
the day generally perish at nightfall
for it is the half-light period at both
ends cf the day that is the most favor
able time for attack.
USE MUCH GAS
' WITH THE AMERICAN NORTH-
' WEST OF VERDIW", Sept. 30, (By the
Associated Press.) The American ar
tillery tire increased in volume dur
ing the day on the right. That of the
enemy decreased slightly, though gas
' and large shells were used freely
against the American front every
where. There was violent counter at
tacks in the neighboihood of Nor.til
lois. Tanks were seen on two portions
' of the sector, but they were not used
except near Apeuuont because of the
bad condition o terrain. The artil
lery fire again was heavy along the
Montfaucon roads. .
i The Germans during the day used
tear gas shells on points live kilome
ters to the rear ot the center of the
line.
! A captured document says the Ger
man decision regarding tne court mar
tialing of American aviators caught
' dropping propaganda pamphlets has
"been rescinded and that in the future
only aviators having propoganda in
their possession will be dealt witb
as "special cases."
The gains marie by the Americans in
the Argonne include a slight advance
in the western part and a more ma
terial gain in the eastern fringe.
EJECT HUN SNIPERS
! WITH THE AMERICAN ARMY
, NORTHWEST OF VERDCN, Sept. 30.
(By the Associated Press, 10 p. m.)
In ridding the Argonne forest of Ger
mans, the Americans have been com
pelled to contend with hundreds of
snipers, many of whoni take positions
in trees, endeavoring to pick off the
advancing soldiers. The American en
countered snipers in such numbers in
one part of the forest that the infan
try called for artilletry, which quickly
ousted the snipers by a barrage.
, Two complete batteries started ac
tion against the Germans today. The
guns and ammunition of these batter
ies were captured from the retreating
forces near Cierges. Included in the
captured equipment were six HO ir.ili
meter guns and ivieiuy-one pieces ol
lighter artillery.
American artillery had not come up
when the capture was made. The of
ficers took quick advantage of the
situation anil turned these guns on the
enemy, using ammunition which they
found in stacks nearby.

WASHINGTON 13 GRATIFIED.
WASHINGTON. Sept. 30 Although
deeply gratified that Bulgaria has
signed an armistice which must be
followed by I er elimination from the

re-rained lrc.ia exercising any direct

ar this 3t3ge. which is regarded as
pvr.ly militnry.
It is believed, however, that in the

the conclusion of the world war, the
United States will b(. invited to dis-
uss this subject w ith the entente al

GERMAN PRESS HYSTERICAL.
AMSTERDAM, Sept. 30. (By the
Associated Press.) The German press
today is hysterically emphasizing that
the need for cool heads never was
grrater than now. The possibility
never before entertained or visualized
is beginning to dawn on the people
that Germany may lose the war, and
the suddenness of this realization has
had a bewildering effect.
The Zeitung Am Mittag entirely ap
proves as wholly appropriate to the
occasion the sensational editorial
printed in Vorwaerts last week deal
ing with what would happen rhould an
enemy succeed in invading the Father
ir.nd. It makes an assertion remark
able for Ciis newspaper, saying:
"Our government throughout this
terrible war has sedulously avoided
hinting at this, and the other possi
bility, namely, that the war may be
lest if everybody and everything are
not united in the utmost efforts."
"The government lias thus itself
contributed to veiling the real gravity
cf our pesition during these four years
of war." the newspaper continues. "It
has preferred to lead the nation in
blinkers past the abyss of danger to
our national life."
i'he Rhenische Westphalim Gazette
Ehucfdering y contemplates the Rulga-1
rian situation, ""the last and highest
vave," and suspects that the Bulga-
i
nans after having got the Dotmidja
regicn of Rumania, have no further
use lor-Germany.
The Frankfort Z?itung expresses re
gret that the government failed to
impress on friend and foe with ' trutV
t'rat Germany did not go into the war
cut of lust for power. Tais newrpnner

justiiied in feeling war-tired. and
thinks the Bulgarian people will stand
with Premier Maniloff. Finally the
Frankfort Zeitung begs the govern
ment to make peace, "unequivocally
and sincerely."
The Dusseldorf Nachrichten bewails
the fate that frcops will have to be
sent to Macedonia if om tCie west
.rout, "where ihey are so bitterlv
needed." Its sister publication, the
Essen Allgemeine Zeitung, speaks of
"bad news coming thick and fast," and
repeats its previous assertion that the
Germans must be strong. Later on
;n its edi'orial the Kssen journal falls 1
into bitter abuse of "blaspheming Wil-
j-n and his mob of lynchers."

Bulgaria
Accepting every allied condition, Bul
garia, without reservation, delay or mur
mur, has unconditionally surrendered and
will henceforth be, out of the war entirely
except as a most benevolent neutral. In
fact, if Germany and Austria take the de
flection too hard, she may well be forced
to fight in defense against her former
friends as an entente ally. It is declared
that both German and Austrian troops in.
considerable numbers have just reached
This may result in complications.
in the meantime Bulgaria has surren-
Sofia
But
dered. She has stopped fighting. She has
agreed to surrender her armies outside
of her territory and to demobilize those
within her borders. She has agreed further
that her territory may be used by the allies
for transportation of troops and that it may
not be used by the troops of the central
powers or of Turkey, nor by their transport,
mails, food or munitions. She has agreed
that all her arms, guns, munitions and mili
tary supplies are to be under allied guard
and control and that certain strategic points
within her borders may be used by allied
armies.
The effect of such a surrender upon the
near eastern situation will be tremendous.
It will be past calm contemplation. It will
be instant and far reaching. In the first
place it will paralyze Turkey's resistance to
the allies. It may well soon bring Ru- -mania
back into the war. It will be a blow
at the Bolshevik that may well make them
tremble this day. It means Austria's down
' fall as soon and as sure as the spring cam
paign opens next year. And it may well
mean the end of Austria before that time.
It means the lopping off of some three
hundred and fifty thousand hard hitting,
fierce, skillful soldiers from the German
cause in one day.
These are its most vital and immediate
military aspects, the political and moral side
of the Bulgarian surrender are greater still.
As to the extent of their effect and bear
ing upon the great war, it is impossible to
tell at this time. They may well be im
mediate and vital, or they may merely bring
gloom and intense depression and a very
considerable loss of morale. And they will
correspondingly hearten 'and cheer and
strengthen the allies in the work they have
yet to do.
For nearly three years these fierce and
fiery Bulgars have acted as a buckler and
shield to Austria from any allied attack
from the back door via Greece and Serbia
and they have furnished as the connecting
link between Berlin and Constantinople. It
was Bulgar aid that put Rumania out of the
war. This talk of Germany opposing ths
world is all very well, but without little but
strong Bulgaria she might well have suc
cumbed at about the time Rumania en
tered the war. Division after division of
Austrians and Germans have been taken
from the Greek front, and then Bulgaria
troops were brought to the aid of the bet
tered German lines in the west. The Bul
gars stood practically deserted and alone
before the allied hosts on the Greek border,
anr1 when the great blow nne he could not
stnnd its impact. He will be missed by the
houses of Hapsburg and Hohenzollern
more than tongue '. r pen can tell.
The Bulgar had to accent hard, stern, un
conditional terms, but this was no more
than his-due. His perfidy, his selfishness
and his greed were such that he could ex
pect nothing else. In fact, his sudden and
complete surrender was the very best thing
he could have done for his threatened coun
try. It will save him from conquest and
the horrors of invasion. He knows full
well, doos the astute and mercenary Bulg?-.
iho allies will not dismember his coun
try nor seek to rule it or mulct it or pWe
upon it the heavy hand of oppression. The
G?rrrr-n way is not thi-ir wr.y. They were
stern and summary in their conditions but
not vengeful or ruthless. The Bulgar is well
out of it and will nurse his wounds and
thank his lucky stars that he had not a
greater price to pay for his cut throat at
tack upon Serbia and his hiring out as an
assassin to the Hun. And the allies, hav
ing passed sern, forceful, just sentence and
protected the interests of their loyal allies,
Greece and Serbia, may also be thankful
that this stout and fire eating Bulgar is out
of their way and that they may now press
on without interference to strike across the
defenseless Hungarian plains straight at the
heart of Austria, that "ramshackle empire"
and tool of Berlin in the greatest crime of all
the ages of the world.
Some people seem, to think that this last
and largest Liberty loan bond issue is more
a rich man's affair than any of the previous
issues that have gone before. They seem
to have absorbed the false logic that, hav
ing taken a bond or two in the other loans,
they have done all they can do and all that is
expected of them. It was even reported that
there would be no fifty dollar bonds in this
issue. Forget all this false, foolish and dan
gerous stuff Do you know that if every
man in this country with an income of one
hundred thousand dollars and over should
give nearly all of his income that the total
would not subscribe ten per cent of the
fourth Liberty loan ! Do you know that if
every man in the nation with an income of
ten thousand dollars and over should give
the greater part of his income that the total
would not subscribe half of the giant loan !
It is to the common people, to the buyers
of a single fifty dollar bond or two one hun
dred dollar bonds that the nation looksto in
the matter of carrying this loan over the
top. The average plug citizen is depended
upon to subscribe these bonds. Consider,
if there are any slackers among the rich
or the wealthy or the well-to-do in the War
ren district. Were there any in the last loan
drive? If so, how many? We wouldn't
stand for it. Well, be sure that the same
condition and the same public sentiment
prevail in all communities in the union.
This is a common cause participated in by
all the people. The fourth loan is going
greater than any of the other loans. It
has to go better to go through, for it is so
much larger than any of the others. All
together, now, all the time, all the way!
No clearer indication of the present state
of mind and method of the German govern
ment could be found than her official at
titude expressed when the first word of the
Bulgarian proposal for an armistice came
to the world.' Official Germany lied then
as shhas always lied, with braven effront
ery and low cunning and extreme plausibil
ity. She declared that both Berlin and Vi
enna were sending reinforcements in great
masses to aid the hard pressed Bulgars, and
yet it was well known by every one who
is keeping in close touch with the military
situation that neither Berlin or Vienna had
any troops to send. Every soldier that can
be mustered by Berlin mandate from Ger
many, Finland, Russia, Austria and Bul
garia i3 being rushed to the western front
to bolster the crumbling German lines.
Again, German high officials declared that
the Bulgarian peace move was opposed by
the greater portion of official, civil and
military Bulgaria, when the subsequent
events proved that the move was practically
unanimous. The German government,
therefore has proved to be consistent still
in knavery, falsehood and deceit. The Prus
sian of Brest-Litovsk and Beauchrest is the
Prussian still. Defeat has .not changed this
animal one jot or one tittle from its raven
ing appetite of body and distemper of mind.

beyond question will drop the triangle
of town8 into the laps of the allied
armies without the necessity of costiy
frontal attacks. Routers was reported
in the hands of the Belgians and
Menin about to tall to the British.
The advance lines are therefore al
ready east of the triangle to the north
and have severed the German com
munication system on that side and
brought the remaining lines under gun
fire.
This Lille sector is the most congest
ed region of the whole battle line.
Situated in the famous coal region,
the three towns almost merge into
each other while before them Amentie
ries stands as an outwork protected
from the south particularly by roads,
railroads and numerous canals and
water lines which make the advance
of troops against a stubborn foe ex
tremely difiiculL
The maneuver executed by Marshal
Foch appears to follow closely the one
he ha8 tried successfully on other
fronts. Instead of hitting" at the weak
point, the Belgian thrust, masked by
an attack over the whole line to the
North sea and aided by the British
licet suddenly concentrated on per
haps the strongest natural barrier
north of Ypres-Houthulst forest.
The wcod was cleared in fierce
fighting, then the Belgian line moved
forward quickly and the British to the
south began an oblique drrve along the
old Hindenburg line defenses which
has taken them past the Lille triangle
with a rush, leaving that northern
pivot of the whole German uelense
system in a rapidly deepening pocket.
Piobably this explains the fact that
tUe British line from southwest of
Douai to the juncture with the second
army somewhere west of Armentieres
have been quiescent thioughout the
bitter fighting on both sides.

You're a funny fellow, poilu, in your dinky little cap
And your war worn fadei uniform of blue.
With your multitude of haversacks abulge from heel to flap
And your rifle that is most as big as you.
You were made for love and laughter, for good wine and merry song,
Now your sunlit world has sadly gone astray,
And the road today you travel stretches rough and red and long.
Yet you make it, petit soldat, brave and gay.
Though you live within the shadow, fagged and hungry half the while.
And ycur days and nights are racking in the line,
There is nothing under heaven that can take away your smile.
Oh, so wistful and so patient and so fine.
You are tender as a woman with the tiny ones who crowd
To upraise their lips and for your kisses pout.
Still, we'd hate to have to face you when the bugle's sounding loud
And your slim, steel sweetheart Rosalie is out.
You're devoted to mustaches which you twirl with such an' air
O er a cigarette with nigh an inch to run,
And quite often you are noticed in a beard that's full of hair.
But that heart of your's is always twenty-one.
No, you do not "parlee English," and you find, it very hard.
For you want to chum with us and words you lack;
So you pat us on the shoulder and say, "Nous sommes comrades.

Belgian Belief and the Home Service lion on which Germany based its pro
woikers will he expected to join ranks test was that forbidding the employ
ill this greatest war demonstration ol ment of "arms, projectiles, or materi
them all. In fact, every woman in-.als calculated to cause unnecessary
tere.sted in the war and in mercy and-
its winning should lend her influence
and her presence to this parade. It
is not a lied Cross parade or a bond
committee parade, it is a parade cf. by
tai, or ,.(,m)a,lv. as they can arrange
it.
You see. the women of the district
are pledged to raise half of t'le dis
trict's quota for the bonds. Their
pride and honor, as well as their patri
otism are concerned. They have T
great task ahead. Only by enthusi
asm and by getting the attention of
the district and its aid. comfort and
abetment can iiiey sut eeed. ALL must
help to win.
Here is a sample of feminine patrit
ism that is going to carry the women
through their great undertaking: The
girls at the postoffice have subscribed
' 100 per cent alreadi to the fourth
bond issue. And these girls are going
to march in tiiTs paraue. And they
should be given an especial cheer as
they pass by.
And remember, the women have set
out to brush away this old bugaboo
1 about It being so hard to get up a
: great parade in Hisbee. the canyon
town. As Mrs. Frankenburg says.
"The harder it is to do. the more worth
while it is to accomplish it; this is the
hardest war that right ever tried to
win against might in the world."

Moreover, if the German government

iK tice is herf by given of the inten

The protest of the German govern

"The German government protests
against the use cf shot guns by the
American army and calls attention to
the fact that according to the law

The shot guns, it was contended, is
exactly atiolo'tious to shrapnel shells,
discharging a multitude of small bul
lets or u machine gun discharging a
spray of pointed bullets.
Officials said nine bull-Is are used
in each cartridge in the shot guns and
that the only instances where a shi I
gun projectile causes more injury to
any one enemy soldier than would a
hit by a lifle bullet are instances
where the enemy soldier has approach
ed so close to the shooter that he is
struc k by uio.e than one buliet. This,
like the ctiec.t of the disposing of
bullet? from a shrapnel shell it was
argued, is permissible (ither in behalf
of the gieater ettectiveiiess or as an
unavoidable incident of the use oi
small scattering projectiles for the)
necessary purpose of Increasing the j
likelihood oi killing a number oi en
emies.
So far as is known here, shot guus
have been employed by American

thrown out. while two passengers in

' ford was taken home. He was not
injured. Parties who saw I'dford driv-

hill close to forty miles an hour.
He passed through Lowell going
'about thirty-five miles an hour and
between the Slag Dump and Lowell
several cars had to turn out of the
road to keep from getting hit. From
parties wh.i witnessed the accident in
formation was secured by the officers
that Ledford was in a drunken condi
tion and two bottles of whiskey were
found after the accident in his car.
His car was turned bottom side un
on the Lugo car and was turned hack
over by parties who reached there just
after the accident happened. That
Lugo and his passengers were not
.killed by the reckless driving of Led
ford is a miracle. No charge was
placed against Ledford last evening

Copper, Cattle &nd Cotton

PrOHlinence in Reports
Tho importance of Arizona as a war
material producing state is signified
by a recent statement by trade authori-
tis that it is estimated that 97 1-2 per
cent of the total American copper pro
duction is used for war purposes. Tho
fact that Arizona produces over one
third of the copper of the United
States, and about 25 per cent of the
copper of the world, emphasizes cop-
P(r as an essential industry. ,
Recent reports of producers have
indicated that the disposal of thoir
product for war purposes averages
aonroximatelv 95 per cent. The aver-
age monthly output of refined copper
is a'.out 20O.0n0.0OO pounds:. the 5 per

. ,.
I ACTIVITIES OF THIS SECTION
HAVE BEEN LARGELY IN
CREASED BY NEED FOR METALS
TO PcRORM ALL SORTS OF
FUNCTIONS IN MUNITIONS
The necessities of the war situa
tion have stimulated in many wavs
to greater activity the functions
of the bureau of mines, depart
ment of the interior, whose normal
field covers the production of met
als and minerals, and Joins that
of the war industries board, which
is concerned with manufactures
and supplies and prices of raw
materials for the same. Much of
this increased activity has fallen
to the war minerals investigation
branch of the bureau of mines,
provided for by special congres
sional appropriation. Under this
branch most of the special war
activities have been grouped.
In the field of actual mining and
' '"unng numerous neld engineers have
i Deec active, and the policy has bet-n
alopted of having these men afford
immediate help in the way cf advice
33 to correct mining and milling meth-
od3- where this aadvice is needed, and
!aIso reRarding all other mining and
I marketing problems needed, and also
! form
part of any special udy or
nieraoir.
. In the various bureau of mines ex-
periment jtation. special proMeion of
ore treatment have been and are un
der investigation. Satisfactory ex-
periments in the concentration of th
j western ehrone ores have been made
jat Seattle, and - experiments on the
j west Texas sulphur ores show their
l probable amenability to the flotation
j method. These are only examples of
; numerous investigations on milling
j methods, whic h cover manganese,
.'graphite, and other war minerals,
j Laboratory investigations with the
view or increasing the supply of elec-
trodes so as to make them available
for western electric furnaces, are un
der way in Colorado.
The subject of the production of
chromite has been thoroughly investi
gated by field parties in all parts of
the country, and in addition the bu
reau of mines' engineers have investi
gated Newfoundland and Cuba, the lat
ter in conjunction with the U. S. Ge
ological survey.
The war minerals investigation or
ganization has provided for handling
the questions of priorities, both of
railroad transportation and of supplies
and fuel, and a very large number of
applications have been handled. The
bureau has also had to act as adviser
to the railroad administration as to
the construction of short lines design
ed to tap mines, the problems being as
to whether such construction was a
war necessity or could be postponed.
Similarly the bureau of mines has
acted as advisor in mining mat'ers ta
other government organiaztions. It
has acted as the advising engineer of
tho capital issues committee of the
war finance corporation as to whether
proposed issues of mining stock were
essential to carrying on the war, or
i could be postponed. It has also worked
pecially in certain matters such as
pyrite. sulphur, and sulphuric acid,
tungsten, etc., and in the decisions and
measures taken by the board on these
subjects it 'has played an important
part.
The bureau has in some case under
taken the difficult problem of high
way construction where this was
necessary as the outlet for an impor
tant war mineral, and in the case of

undertaking, and Is co-operating with
the department of labor, and in gen
eral handles the whole subject of min
ing labor in that connection. In many
cause labor difficulties to which im
portant war mines were submitted as
a result of unfair labor competition,
have been relieved, and in general

GRAIN MARKET.
CHICAGO. Sept 30. Hopes of a
speedy general peace captivated trad
ers tcday on 'change, and made war
prices move downward like matc. Af
ter continuous heavy selling and an
f-xtreme break of 7c the corn mar
ket closed excited 3c to bc net
lower, with October $1.254. to 51.36,
and November $1.33V to $1 33i.
0&U showed a setback of lvfec to

Ia provisions the result varied from
$1 dec ine to 15c advance.
Belief that the corn market wa too
high on a peace basis dominated the
pit as soon as business got well un
derder way. At first the chief influ
ence was the news that the signing
of an armistice had made Bulgaria'3
surrender complete. This contingency
had been largely discounted before
hand, however, and a quick rally fol
lowed sharp breaks, with which the
market opened. Then came word of
unexpectedly rapid forward sweeps
bv the entente allies, and of signs
that a peace move by Turkey, if not
by Austria, might apparently soon be
looked for. Pressure to liquidate hold
ings now assumed big proportions, and
throughout the rest of the day all sup
port was lacking except from shorts
who had profits.
Oats and provisions succumbed to
the same factors that carried down
corn. Theories that peace talk was
bul ish as to provisions failed to
work.

Danger to Mining Industry
In Draft Presented to Gen.
Crowder by Mining Congress
What the federal government is
actually planning with regard to the
1: ndlirig of the mining country situa
tion umier the present draft is told in
the I'd owing semi-official statement
published iu the current Mining Con
gress Journal:
The danger to industrial America
through the. working out of the new
artilt law has caused the government
to awaken to the necessity for very in
telligent co-operation with employers,
in ordr that disaster may be avoided
and loss in production of raw mate
rials minimized.
Especially is there recognition of
the danger to the mining industry and
when onicers of the American Mining
Congress brought the matter directly
to tne attention of Provost Marshal
General Crowder, prompt assurance
was given that every tuort would be
. made to prevent loss of man power iu
the mines.
"Every man who can be spared to
carry on war work must be used for
the army," the general said, "but we
are endeavoring to prevent anything
happening to the industries upon
which we depend for war materials
or for the safety and comfort of our
men." The attitude of Colonel Con
kline. in charge of problems connect
ed with the production of coal, was
the same.
Ti.e administration, through its civic
departments, is co-operating closely
with General Crowder in working out
the necessary protective measures.
The now thoroughly organized em
tio ment service, sub department o
the department of h'.bor, has bean
granted certain powers of control over
unskilled labor, even to the extent of
fcrcible allocation, if necessary, to
war work. The labor policies board
has materially strengthened its work
through the organization of a "man
pov.er committee." at the head of
whi h is ClKirles Neave, well known as
en attorney of high standing in New
York, and who is working very close
ly with the war department in estab
"isi.ir the machinery which not only
administers the draft, but is being
called upon to work out the man-power
problems in industrial centers. Mr.
Neave reiterated the slatemn.ils of
Gen ral Crowder and his assistants
thnt no weakening of nv;n power
would be allowed in the lnir.es,
"though employers must gire this mat
ter immediate attention and assist us
to understand their, needs, ' he said.
He then outlined the organization of
the dralt machinery and requested the
co-operation of the American Mining
Congress is getting the plans cf tu.
committee promptly before the mining
operators.
A new eiement was brought into the
situation through the organization of
a "labor committee" in the bureau of
Mines," with J. E. Spurr, chairman of
the board, iu charce cf war materials
investiaations as chairman. All of the
forces, though working separately and
from different angles, will co-ordinate
their information to insure the most
satisfactory results. Long before the
rulrs were promulsited and while the

draft biil wa3 still in debate, the Am
erican .Mining congress gave the de
tailort information tn its members and
a!filiated bodies and began the work j
U organizing the operators along pro-1
tective lines. .
Incidental cases of injustice may be
discovered where district boards may j
lail in giving consideration to the
statements of employers, but the I
.Mining Congress Journal believes that
these leases will be the exception and
that Chairman Neave of the man-power
committee will be able to invoke
proper action on the part of the war
department. Already there have been
leported to the American Mining Con
gress certain cases where serious re
sults will follow the withdrawal of
certain men, but these cases are in the
minds of the proper officials for in
vestigation. The Mining Congress appealed to
every operator not to handle his labor
dralt problems in a perfunctory man
ner, but to be able to place individual
s u.ements covering every '"key" man
in each mine or business department
cf mining companies directly in the
Lauds of district boards. The request
means a great deal of work for corpor
ations employing hundreds and In
some cases thousands of men, but be
lore the draft machinery began work
many of these corporations were -distill!:
the information desired. It is a
case of man power for army and in
dustry and the man power is as im
pel tant for one as for the other. G?n
..ral Crowder intends to man the
army, and if employers desire to re
tain the pivotal forces in their produc
ing departments it is up to them to
co-operate with proof of the neces
sity for retaining every important
trained and efficient man and further
to furnish proof of his efficiency.
The Mining Congress Journal he
lices that a liberal measure cf praise
is dus to the administrative officers
v.-Lo have endeavored to work out this
most, remarkable program by whicn
i very m.n v iil be made to do hi3 bit.
v,c also desire to add a word of
raise for the excellent manner in
which the adjutant general has work

tives have returned to the mines. In

tem was extended to metalliferous

individual furlough claims. Its work-
i ing is simple but efficient. When -it
Is found that a man, necessary to the
strengthening of war production hex,

Cicring the employes of the smaller
employers, have advanced their rates
irom S pi.' cent to 10.40 per cent. The
nciease iaeans a great deal to small

icwer rate was exceedingly burden

The manner of conducting casualty
insurance companies operating in the
state has never been satisfactory, and
t'.itir te;ms and methods of settlement
have always been accepted under pro

gaining protection. Contests in the
courts by the insurance companies of

and for whose insurance the employ

have frequently been made.this course

MiNhAL, Ariz., Sept. 30. Long
staple cotton is growing in experi
mental patches on many frnia
throughout the McNeal basin.
This cotton was planted in May and
June. Although late in planting, it
has developed into splendid plants
and, if the frost does not catch it,
will mature into a fine lot of cotton.
The largest tract planted is on the
farm of Frank Murphy, four inilos
southwest from McNeal on the Ceutral
highway. The plants are well matured,
are heavy in blossoms and bolis,. Some
of the bollg are about ready to open
aud Mr. Murphy expects to be picKing
some of the cotton by the first of Oc
tober. These plants show strong
growth and are trcm three to four teet
in height. Mr. Jones, the section fore
man for El Paso & Southwestern at
McNeal, has a patch of this cotton
glowing in his home garden at the sta
tioi: and attract much attention by
passengers frum the various trains.
The growing ot this cotton in tho
McNeal vailey is being watched very
closely by cotton growers and it prov
en sacc.p.ssiul lar-e acreages may bu
planted neit season.
A good exhibit of cotton will be
nide at the McNeal fairl whic:i will
be held on October 19.

"l will not shame him with
abandoned grief "
BY AUGUSTUS THOMAS
To fear the dark, to fear the future, to fear;
some man or set of men, to fear exposure of some hidden and.
culpable act, to fear justice, to fear anything, is a retarding
and an inhibiting and sometimes a paralyzing condition.
To be courageous, to have .confidence, to feel unblam-j
able, to be ready to meet examination is to be normal, and "start scratch.1!
To be called upon in a moment of need or crisis, and to meet the call is a1
gratifying expression. But to have a chance to rise to ones full stature, to
strike twelve, not in a physical effort but in the arena of the soul, to stand)
tip-toe spiritually is to be as near Godlike as man can be in this Hfe.
Snmp hnvQ in
go through safely, gladly
that trial and selt-acquaintance. Ihe motner or
here who reads the name of her soldier in the list

way to the same supreme spiritual experience.
We others must accent such ways
come to us, wherein and whereby to make our
thing will be to remember all one s lite an opportunity tnat we snunnea or;
avoided or shirked; a moment in which, while the soldier bled and fell, apd:
the woman lifted her brave face, and thought "I will not shame him with
abandoned grief," we played safe.
That moment, trifling and easily put aside at first, will
be a demoralizing consciousness at two in the morning; a dreadful, weaken
ing and undermining memory always; a ball and chain on one's self
respect. One of these opportunities to be met or shirked is for us, the les
ser ones, coming now. The government behind the boys asks us to lend it
whatever money we can. at fair interest and on the best security. The money
to give the men defending us on the firing line an equal chance against the
Huns who attach.
