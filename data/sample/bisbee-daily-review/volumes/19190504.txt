Treasury "A Bit Concerned"
In response to pressing inquiries to
day, as to the treasury's attitude con
cerning the progress of the loan, of
ficials explained that subscriptions
were not piling in as fast as they
had hoped when they arranged a loan
of comparatively small size. They
said they were "a bit concerned" over
the record of the past two weeks, but
not to an extent that they were ready
fit this time-to sound a note of posl
tive alarm.
One of the most hopeful signs is
that many individuals are buying Vic
tary . notes and indications are that
the subscription tabulated to date in
clude what is considered )a rather
small percentage of purchases by the
banks or big corporations.
For example, 856,000 of the 1,840,

PEACE INVALID IS
ITALY CONTENTION
Says Allies Have No Right to
Act Without Her; to
Seize Fiume, Threat
ROME, Friday, May 2. Newspapers
favorable to the government protest
against the continuation by the peace
conference of negotiations with the
German delegates without the partici
pation of Italy, because they say, it
violates the treaty between the allies
forbidding a separate peace. Tribuna
says:
"The allies are pledged to us by a
sacred treaty. They cannot sign a
peace without us and they cannot
make a separate peace without reason.
President Wilson may be an autocrat,
but not to the point of imposing the
shame of treason upon great Britain
and France."
The Idea Nazionale asks how the
peace conference could declare the
league of nations approved unanim
ously last Monday while Italy was ab
sent; how the conference could assign
Kiao-Chau to Japan when Italy was
not present, and how the conference
can present the preliminaries of peace
to the German delegates wtihout Italy
acting with them. The newspapers
adds:
"The conference places itself out
side the alliance of Italy. Italy must
answer by the annexation of the ter
ritories she claims."

Neither President Wilson nor the Italian ambassador made any state
ment regarding the subject under discussion. The interview was sought
by Count Macchi di Cellere and took place after the regular conference
between President Wilson and Premiers Clemenceau and Lloyd George.
LONDON, Way 3. It is not improb
able that the peace treaty will not be
ready for presentation to the Germans

Reuter's Paris correspondent, owing

actual working document is taking
more time than had been anticipated.

the peace terms relating to their re

HUNS FIGHT FOR COLONIES
LONDON, May 3. Reuter's limited
learns from reliable sources " that
among the terms of the treaty to
which the Germans will offer the most
objection is that relating to the sur
render of; her colonies. They will
urge that German East Africa, Togo
land and Kamerun be lert to her, and
upon refusal, will ask to be assigned
some part in the future administration
of her former German colonies. They
will ask that in any case Germany
shall not be debarredlfrom purchasing
some Portuguese colonies at a future
date, should Portugal be willing to
sell.
A plea also will be made that the
Saare area revert to Germany after
a term of years. The delegates will
oppose any proposal to deprive them
of sovereignty over the Kiel canal,
while agreeing that it shall be free
to th world's commerce. They will
oppose any so-called Polish corridor,
while guaranteeing to Poland the right
of free transit, both by rail and by

"Sirs, .will you Jkindly decide
an argument which unless we re

the identity of a certain piece or

SAN JUAN, May 3. Seaplanes of!
the American marines are rapidly" j
clearing San Domingo jungles of their j
bad men. The roar and sweep of the i
big birds is frightening them into the j
villages to face arrest rather than
brave an attack from the air. Stories ;
go about the island that these planes j
sweep through the shacks of the band
its as though they were piles of hay
and scatter them broadcast. Anyhow
they're helping the marines to clean
up the island.

THREAT NOTE BY SHOT i ARIZONA'S LOAN DRIVE
Although no "arrests have been made

said the police have connected up I

Officer Thomas last night said.!
there was no doubt but what the bul-
let was Intended for him. "L was mak
ing the rounds on O. K. street and had i
walked to the rear o the Grand the
ater when the shot was fired. I
heard the bullet pass near me and
then lodge itself in the wall. I at first
thought it was fired from a .22 caliber
rifle but later decided" it came from a
heavy revolver which . probably con
tained a silencer." .
"The shooting yesterdays reminded
me of a note that had been left in

U. S. RAIL METHODS
PARIS, May 3. America's exampls
scores again! It ought. to please and
reassure all who "don't just know"
whether they approve , of the peace
making or not, to learn that the deli
cate question of freight car couplings
j has not been overlooked in framing a
last peace." It is firmly recommended
that all Europe standardize couplings
as American roads have done, so cars
of one line may be freely moved on
another. The peacemakers report that
i they realize it would be too much to
I ask that countries having tracks of
! different guages get together. How
the coupling matter will enable a nar
row guage car to run on a wide-guage

To Our Stockholders and Friends:
We wish to announce that our Woods No. 1
well, two miles northwest of the Norwood in the
Ranger Field, will be started within the next thirty
days or sooner, if arrangements now being made
are successfully developed. Our Representative is'
now in the field and details are being pushed as
rapidly as is consistent with efficient management.
, -This location was passed upon by our geologist
as being on the same anti-cline as1 the Norwood,
Roper, Terrell and Sun wells, which came in from
5,000 to 1 4,000 barrels per day. And not only on
the same anti-cline, but upon the very axis of it,
which means great probability of a well equally as
large as those above mentioned. , ;
In making this announcement we feel a keen
satisfaction. We have preferred to wait until the
limitations of the various pools have been clearly
defined. This has already been done-by other opJ
erators, and we are thus profiting by previous drill
ing and the accumulated knowledge gained there
from. The Wood No. I should be completed within
90 or I 20 days, and the production from it alone
should be sufficiently large to satisfy the most op
timistic of our stockholders.
Our policies are the result of years of practical
experience in the oil fjusiness. Our personnel is of
the highest character and our organization is the
cleanest possible.
Watch this space and we will tell you more about
it from day to day.
Don't delay getting your share of this stock while
it is available.

Busy Householders at
Work of Beautifying
Warren yesterday was alive with ac
tivity, for almost every householder
in the district could be seen working
taround 'his new home making im
provements, such as building fences,
sowing seeds, making paths and trim
ruing shrubbery. . A Review represen
tative yesterday was invited by Jesse
Yoakum, real estate agent for the
Warren district, to make a round of
the many fine homes and inspect the
new dwellings that are being erected.
One of the most striking and unus
ual buildings now under construction
is that which will be known as the
Como apartments which lies off the
main road on Van -Dyke street. This
building, which is being built by C. F.
Johnson, will contain four apatrments,
and is the only one of its kind in the
entire Warren district. On Black
Knob drive apricot trees, shrubbery,
beautiful lawns and many green trees,
present a fine appearance. The homes
owned by Sinclair, John S. Scott, Wil
liam Tonkins, Salhome, Hobbs and
William Taylor, are very pretty and
most of these homes are now enclosed
with durable fences.
Well-kept Mexican Homes
At the north end. of Van Dyke
street and near the car lines, is a
large building which houses the famil
ies of the Mexicans who are employed
as section men on. the Warren Bisbee
street railway. The Mexicans keep the
lawns trimmed and many have planted
flowers and other plants.
The J. II. Verlurth home on Vista
street is almost ready to be occupied.
This house is very striking and is
designed somewhat atfer the Califor
nia mission house effects It is the
only one of its kind in the district.
One of the most striking beauties of
the C. F. Ungemach home is the beau
tiful lawn. The paths -are well laid
out and later in the season when tne
grass Js thick a great improvement to
the entire building will be added.
How to Make a Lawn
When asked how he managed to
have so much success with his lawn
Mr. Ungermach said: "I spade up the
ground about ten inches, and then roll
it. Then I bring it back to grade by
covering it with suteu dirt. 1 then
rake the grass seed in on top ana
with a fair amount of water a fine i
lawn will materialize." Fences are
also being built around the homes of
E. C. Campbell, harles Willis and
Eva Wallace. Ira B. Jerelmon was
seen working on his lawn yesterday
and otherwise making improvements
as was also bTX. Smith, whose fine
residence is surrounded with trees in
full bloom and other shrubbery.
. James Irving moved into his new j
home yesterday, while Tom Graham j
will move into his new home in the j
Third addition to Warren this week. I
Mrs. Frances Webster has purchased
a lot on Douglas boulevard and will
start. to build a home tomorrow on it.
Excavating is well under way on the
lot. upon which will be built Mr. Not
man's home. It will be across the
Douglas home and a fine location. ,
Home Building Made Easy
After visiting Warren one cannot
help but be impressed with the local-;
ity of the district. It Is suitable lor
fine homes in every respect. Many
homes in the Third addition to War
ren have been built because of the
advantages obtained through the War
ren District Building & Loan associa
tion, which is made possible through
the local mining companies which sup
ply the necessary loans. In fact more
than 300 homes have been built ry
miners and others at cost and plans
are being prepared to build many more
in the same addition.

EL PASO BOOSTERS IN
BISBEE MAY 16 ON
ANNUALEXGURSION
"Get Together" Trade Jaunt
This Year to Extend
Into Mexico
With 35 live wires already strung
for the annual invasion into territories
that are worthy of closer trade rela
tions, El Paso business men are mak
ing ready for a big drive to the west
coast of Mexico on one of the most
extensive trade trips ever'launced in
the southwest. Twenty-five additional
names will be required before the ex
cursion can be assured and commit
tees are hard at work signing up the
various firms.
The special train will leave El Paso
on the 15th of May and will take in
the principal cities of Arizona, includ
ing Bisbee, and thence to the west
coast of Mexico for an invasion of the
Mexican cities tf HermosiLlo, Guay
mas, Magdalena, Espalme, Nogales
and a few other stops en route. The
trip will last ten days, the excursion
ists arriving back in the Pass city
on the 25th of May.
The big special is scheduled to ar
rive in Bisbee at 8 a. m. on May 16,
leaving at 11 the same morning. Sec
retary Egan of the Commercial-' club
stated yesterday that a committee of
Bisbee business men would be on
hand to receive the boosters and if
possible the visitors will be induced
to remain over ast luncheon guests
of the Commercial club.
El Paso business men on. their an
nual trade trips put over some unique
stunts in every village and city that
they pass through. One of the features
of the big excursion is a military band
and a lot of other talent Including
Robert Page, the seven-foot giant, and
S. J. Freudenthal of the Lesinsky
company. These two are known as the
Mutt and Jeff performers of the party.
There are also Clairborne Adams,
John M. Wyatt and Allie Martin whose
frolics have added zest to previous
trips.

HUNS DIVIDED OVER
STATUES OF KAISER
BERNE, May 3. (French Wireless
Service.) Theodor Wolff, the ditor in
chief of the Tageblatt of Berlin, 'has
announced his intention of resigning
from the executive committee of the
Ferman democratic party.
According to reports from Berlin,
Herr Wolff has not been in agreement
with oiher leaders of the democratic
party. The difference is said to have
reached a crisis when Herr Wolff
threw his support to the demand that
busts and portraits of the former Em
peror be rtttnoved from the schools.
.)id method of travel compared with the new. Burros are
out-dated i by Goodrich equipped auto's. Road improve
.. ments are needed to keep pace.
The days of prairie schooners and
rickety old wagons drawn by mules
or cayuses over rut-pouged and rock
strewn desert trails have given place
to the modern automobile with
springs and pneumatic tires.
The old roads had to suffice for
the early mode of travel, .but the
effectiveness and utility of a car is
greatly lessened if it has to travel
oyer the old style trail.
The automobile ha3 come to stay
in Arizona, and it is being used in
increasing, numbers every year. In
order to encourage the use of the
auto and gasoline truck, which are
of great economic advantage in mar
keting products and distributing mer
chandise, it will be necessary for Ari
zona to keep pace with the rest of
the states in the Union in the matter
of road building.'
The Arizona State Legislature is
awake to this fact already, and its
energetic TJitmbs are striving to
get an apj'i Rpriatfon for the im
provement ol many of the principal
roads. There are several fairly
good highways in Arizona now, suit
able for automobile traffic, but when
the appropriation for good roads is
authorized, and the work is complet
ed, it will greatly stimulate produc
tion in the many fertile, irrigated
valleys of the State. It will bring
the producer and the market into
closer touch, reduce the cost of dis
tribution of Arizona's mineral and
agricultural products, and greatly
add to the wealth of the State gen
erally. The accompanying illustration
shows the contrast between the old
method of travel and the new. A
Goodrich tourmg party happened to
be traveling over the State recently,
and along the road overtook an In
dian with his . team of mules and
prairie schooner. It 'presented such
a striking contrast between the past
and present, that one of the party
snapped the picture. '
The mule and the wagon is get
ting to be very much a thing of the
past in Arizona, and is being rapidly
supplanted by the automobile, but
occasionally one meets with a few
of the old Indians and pioneers who,
owing to lack of enterprise, are com
pelled to use the old style of travel.
Although their methods are anti
quated, they also appreciate good
roads wlfcn the opportunity to use
I them presents itself.

MOTORISTS OF BISBEE
TAKING INTEREST IN
EL PASO AUTO SHOW
Motorists in and around Bisbee are
evidencing great interest in the com
ing automobile show to be held in
Liberty hall, El Paso, May S, 9 and
10, according to F. C. Bledsoe, local
motor merchant.
Several Bisbee motor car owners
already are planning to attend the af
fair, predicted to be the most pre
tentious of its kind ever given in the
southwest.
"From the information we have re
ceived, the El Paso show will rank
among the finest in the United
States," Mr. Bledsoe said today. "As
a matter of fact, it will excell by vir
tue of its extra features alone. Aside
from the exhibition of new car moo
els and tractors, the headliner at
traction will be George Presley Geake,
the famous tenor soloist of the Metro
politan Grand Opera company of New
York. He will sing every afternoon
and evening during the three days of
the show. Other musical features will
include the Juarez Garrison Military
band, which has been secured to ap
pear on International night, May 10."
Another appealing attraction at this
motor carnival will be dancing every
evening from 9:30 o'clock until mid
night. Approximately 6000 square feet
of floor space has been arranged be
tween the various booths for this pur
pose alone. .
The fala date; will be Society night,
May 9. Reports from El Paso indicate
that practically every social set in
the city will be represented at this
formal function, in honor of his maj
esty, the automobile. Twenty of the
most beautiful Society girls of the city
have been chosen as sponsors for the
arious exhibits! The governors of
Arizona, Naw Mexico and Texas, to
gether with the leading military men
from the Panhandle, have been invited
as special guests of honor on this oc
casion. '
"I expect to attend the show if noth
ing unforeseen, occurs," Mr. Bledsoe
said. "I advise everyone who can to
attend. It will prove a trip of excep
tional educational and pleasureable
value." ;

LILLIAN GISH
r;aD,y.GriPfith'sArcrt Production
Paramount Star Rollicking Girl in
"The Greatest Thing in Life"
To see Miss Lillian Gish as eJan
ette in "The Greatest Thing in
Life," is to see her in a role en
tirely different from any in which she
has recently appeared. The picture is
an Artcraft production by David Wark
Griffith and will be shown at the
Grand theater today and tomorrQW.
It presents Miss Gish as a rollicking
girl, half hoyden, half dreamer. Her
old father, who is homesick for his
native France, keeps a little tobacoc
and news-stand in' New York city.
Jeanette has to tidy up the living
rooms, and attend customers. ' .
Very happy is she with today, but
tomorrow is of great interest, too, for
then will come her hero, a strong,
brave man who loves the world a3 she
does, and likes to dream too. At first
she thought Edward Livingston mignx
be the man. He was an elegant New
York chap, but he called her a simp
one day, and left before she could
really express her thoughts with the
rigorous force they deserved.
Then she went to France with
her daddy. When a young giant with
a basket jkf vegetables arrived for the
daily delivery at her aunt's shop, and
found the American girl wonderful.
Jeanette had a new hero to consider.
i But he would eat garlic, and Cupid
never rode to conquest on the waves
of garlic fumes.
Livingston visited France, crossing
the ocean to deliver an apology. He
shared her delight in poetry and he
was clean and fine, but he hated chil
dren. She knew then he could never
be her ideal, and she returned to Mon.
le Bebe.
But something unforeseen happened
and brought them together again. Adv.

"For 25 years I was looking for
something to relieve my troubles and
have found it at last in Tanlac," said j
Richard Oldham, living on R. F. D. I
No. 1, Platte City, Mo., a prosperous !
farmer who has lived in his commun-1
ity for 50 years.
"I have so much faith In, Tanlac,"
continued Mr. Oldham, "that I have
come all the way from Platte City, a
distance of 25 miles, to get me another
bottle. All these years I suffered ter
ribly with indigestion. As soon as I
would eat anything I would bloat up
with gas and there was such a tight
ness in my chest that I could hardly
get my breath. Even a drink of cold
water would seem to set me on fire
inside, and often I would turn so faint -and
weak that I could hardly do a j
thing, and although I tried everything
U could hear of I could only get ai
temporary relief.
"1 have taken only three bottles of
Tanlac so far and the way I have im
proved is simply wonderful. My appe
tite is fine and I am not troubled with
indigestion like I was before and am
getting better every day."

Month of April Sets Record for Levelling Mountain; Over
500 Men Engaged in Task; Superintendent Notman
Gives Interesting Warren District News-
Sacramento Hill is gradually being
devoured by the steady pressure of
men and steam shovels. Last month
a record "was set in removing the
mountain. Arthur Notman, superin
tendent of the Phelps Dodge Mines,
announces that during the month of
April 175,000 square yards were re
moved from the hill -which thus far
exceeds all previous marks.
The reducing of Sacramento Hill is
an engineering feat difficult for the
mind to grasp without enlightenment
of a few of the figures incidental to its
reduction Each day more than one
hundred train loads of dirt and rock
are hauled away to a dump near
which a big concentrator is being
erected in Warren. To accomplish
this work more than 500 men are
engaged and tons of dynamite are
used daily to loosen the earth and
rocks. The big mountain continually
trembles under the concussion of the
huge blasts of dynamite. Steam trains
and men remove the earth and rocks
as fast as giant steam shovels can
be swung into position for handling.
Lay iMiles of Track
Miles of new railroad tracks have
been laid since the work on -reducing
the hill was commenced. ,As the
mighty steam shovels eat their way
into the sides of the mountain the
tracks are extended, and keep follow
ing in the wake of the shovels.
The reduction of this huge hill is a
tremendous task that involves mil
lions of dollars. - The grade of ore
that is being found is not of a high
average. Nevertheless a big concen
trator is being constructed at War
ren to handle this ore, but according
to Mr. Notman the big mill is now
"marking time."
"Sacramento Park" Future Suburb
Sacramento Hill when reduced, in
accordance with the plans and speci
fications o fthe Phelps-Dodge com
pany will make room for hundreds of
homes. The city is sadly in need of
acreage for homes and when the re
duction of Sacramento Hill has been
completed the present perplexing situ
ation that confronts the community
will have been solved. Some day there
will be incorporated in the limits of
the city of Eisbee a suburb of fine
homes and it will be known as "Sac
ramento Park."
To Enlarge Dallas Shaft
Preparatory to the development
work which the Phelps-Dodge coi
poration plans from time to time dur
ing the present lull in the copper
market, work is to be started on en
larging the Dallas shaft. This shaft
at present! contains only two com
partments 'and the company plans to
enlarge it to five.
Even though the copper market' is
now uncertain, it is thought that with
in the next six months a great period
of reconstruction will take place in
Europe and copper will then cpme
into its own. During the great war
the entire copper, output was practi
cally consumed for war needs. Great
guns and war material had to be
made and as a result the flow that
went through private channels dur
ing times of peace was virtually sus
pended and when things start read
justing themselves the demand for
copper on the open market is expect
ed to be huge and of steady volume

FOR BOYS OF 158TH
The fololwing dispatch from New

Mountain club there for the return

New York, April 25. The copper

The 158th is now under the com

General A. M. Tuthill having preceded
the regiment to the United States.
Under the auspices of the Rocky

THE WEEK FROM
SWING
The price is expected gradually to
rise to a healthy mark and condi
tions in the copper mining district to
enjoy a robust and permanent stabil
ity and an era of prosperity ensu that,
while not flourishing as that of war
time, will be steady, so that the busi
ness world will be able to make plans
in advance, which is impracticable
during a time when the peace treaty
still hangs fire and business is prac
tically in the dark.
Mr. Notman says that the C. & CI.
shaft is again under development and
will be sunk from the 1500 foot level.
This will not mean an additional force
of men to be employed, but instead,
Mr. Notman says, men will be shifted
around from other positions.
Lowell Change Room Completed
The new Lowell change room has
been completed and will be ready for
occupancy as soon as the painters
finish the exterior, which will be some
time next week. The new change
room is similar to those which the
company has installed in the Czar
and Holbrook shafts and it is equip
ped with all modern conveniences.
The installation of these change
rooms is subsequent to the company's
desire to make working conditions as
comfortable and as pleasant as they
possibly can for the worekrs. The
new change rooms are equipped with
shower baths, a daily supply of linen
towels, soap, etc. Lockers have been
installed of metal design and each
workman has a place where he can
leave his valuables and change of
clothes in security.
The only division which still lacks
a change room,, is the Gardner shaft
and Mr. Notman says work will be
commenced on this shaft later in the
year.
Tombstone to

As Silver Queen
PHOENIX, May 3. Tombstone
may "come back". She may again
become the "Silver Queen" of the
southwest, again be the biggest
and busiest silver camp in the
country.
Such is the cheerful message
brought back;by Rudolph Kuchler
of the tax commission, who, with
Chairman Zander of the commis
sion, has been inspecting mining
property in Cochise and, Green-'
lee counties for several days.
"Sixteen or eighteen of the old
time silver properties in thl
Tombstone district," said Mr.
Kuchler, "are already being work
ed quietly on leases, including
such typical old-time mines as the
Bonanza, Turquoise, Silver
Thread, State of Maine, and oth
ers of equal fame. .Already the
old-timers of Tombstone are lay
ing their plans for the expected
revival of the camp to its old
time glory.

WISHESJF OWNERS
.. . i -
Eastern Stockholders Are
Optimistic Following
? Visit to Property
That the indications at the Gads
den are meeting the most roseate ex
pectations of the owners is the state
ment made by Thomas Houston,
wealthy Michigan capitalist and one
of the directors of the Calumet &
Arizona Mining company, of which
the local property is a subsidiary.
Mr. Houston is heading a party com
posed of William Bond, William Tre
vaithan, W. Pendetlini, Chester Hous
ton, Gordon R. Campbell and H. B.
Praull, of New York. All are stock
holders in the parent concern, and
are accompanied by W. B. Goehring,
one of the leading engineers of the
company.
The decision to visit the property!
here grew out of the optimistic re-!
ports of the devedopment work at
the Gadsden, submitted Saturday at
the directors', meeting of the Calumet
& Arizona at Douglas.
After an examination of the mine,
Mr. Houston stated that the work is
progressing as favorably as could be
expected, and the indications are all
that could be desired. He denied the
rumor that the exploration is to be
pushed forward on a larger scale,
however, stating that the company
would content itself with the opera
tions originally outlined.
For the present, the operations are
to be confined to the development
of its intense mineralization zone en
countered on tho 1200 level. Drifts
are now being run through this zone,
and at short intervals cross-cutting
operations will be instituted that the
extent of the mineralization may be
determined, and the data thus secured
be made the basis for future plans.
In spite of the fact that the indica
tions are growing better daily, the
engineers in charge of the work are
of the opinion that the actual ore
body will not be encountered for at
lest another two -, months. They
agree, however, that a strike may be
made ebfore this time, and that is no
doubt but that the. present plans,'
without modification, will be ulti
mately crowned with success.
RECLAMATION FEAT IN
YUMA MINE DISTRICT
1 SAVES 45,000 ACRES
In a country where water is as prec
ious as gold, and in many instances
more valuable than .all the yellow
metal that will ever be mined, the
work that has just been completed by.
the New King of Arizona Mining Co.,!
in the Castle Dome mountains, is j
considered to be one of the biggest!
reclaamtion feats ever accomplished f
in Yuma County outside of Govern-.
ment work.
The Castle Dome mountains are in
the center of a waterless desert. The
mountains are famous for their rich
ness. Two mines at least have made
their holders wealthy the North Star
and the King of Arizona. Heretofore
because of the lack of water, mining
was . a precarious occupation in the
Castle Domes, and rich ore had to
be discarded because of the lack of
the : fluid. Rich property has lain
idle "because there has not been suf
ficient water in the mountains to!
work it.
When the King of Arizona mine was
purchased and reorganized some time
ago by eastern capitalists, one of thej
nrst tnings aone Dy me new company
was to try to solve the water probr
lem. Water had to be hauled to the
mine over mountain roads in bar
rels. The cost of the water when it
arrived on the property was as great
as the cost of gasoline in Yuma today.
To work with such water was well
night impossible.
The New King of Arizona found a
short distance from their mine a nat
ural rock reservoir. In time of flood)
the reservoir would fill with water,
i but in' a short time it would run oft
! into the desert and be wasted

erected a dam thirty feet high which
will hold back sufficient water to sup-,
ply the mines of that immediate dis-
trict through the greatest drouth, i
When the reservoir is completed, what'
was once a waterless waste win oe
a square mile of water. The reser
voir is more than a mile and a half
long and will have a depth of nearly
thirty feet.
The dam will reclaim approximately
45,000 acres of range land. In the
past it has been impossible to range
cattle in the Castle Dome mountains
because of the scarcity of water.
There are no running streams and
all of the natural tanks and reser
voirs dry up during the long hot
months of summer. Now it is possible
to run a herd of 25,000 cattle In that
part of the Castle Domes.

MINING
KAY COPPER MINE?
BEING DEVELOPED
AT H-FT. LEVEL
Most; Important Find Since
Verde Extension, Makes
Rapid Progress
MAYER, Ariz., May 3. Speaking In
the terms of the oil fraternity, the
Kay copper mine is a "gusher." The
Kay is located in the southern portion
of the Black canyon district, about
45 miles north of Phoenix. It is an
old property, formerly owned and op
erated by S. J. Tribolet of Phoenix
and later taken over by F. R. Ross and
associates of New York and George
W. Long, who was the principal or
ganizer of the United Eastern com
pany of Oatman. The Kay Copper
company is the name of the organiza
tion. The mine was developed to the 350
foot level by Tribolet and associates
and a" number of carloads of high
grade ore were shipped by , them.
Under the new management the shaft
was sunk first to the 500-foot level,
where considerable development work
was carried on yhich opened up very
large bodies of ore; in fact, the ore
body in the south drift at the 500
level proved to be better than 75' feet
in width running from a good milling
grade in value to- 22 per cent copper
and some gold and silver. The north
crosscut on the same level showed
62 feet of milling ore, this apparently
being a seperate lense from the south
ore body. ' i-
After thoroughly exploring the 500
foot level the shaft was continued
to the 600 and in the past few weeks
development has been in progress on
a large scale in drifts and crosscuts
north and south of the shaft and the
findings of ore have been on the sen
sational order. Not only have the ore
leses opened and developed on the
500-foot level been found to be in
place on the 600 level, and to have
widened out considerably, but the
main fault on the. wst Jias been pen
etrated and t,he south ore lense has
been encountered on the other side
bigger than ever. The grade of ore
in the workings on the 600-foot level
is about the" same as that on the
500.
The mine map of the workings
shows the ore lenses to be continuous
from the 50-foot level where the first J
high grade ore was mined and ship-!
ped by Tribolet to the present 600
level. They have widened out regu
larly and uniformly.
No strike of ore of such importance
as the Kay has been made in Yavapai
county since that of the United Verde
Extension at Jerome. The mine is lo
cated in the Yavapai schist formation,
quite similar to that of the Jerome
district and the determination of the
permanency of the ore bodies in the
Kay to the present depth sets aside
all doubts as to the future of the mine
and to this particular schist formation
which predominates in the Block can
yon district. The Kay mine is about
50 miles south of Jerome.
It is known that the Kay company
has definite plans as to its own re
duction works which will be built not
so very far from the mine at the
proper time. It is also a stetled fact
that a railroad will be built to the
mine, through the canyon although
the details are not ready for publio
announcement. The development ot
the Kay shows ore reserves that will
warrant the building of the contem
plated reduction works and the, rail
road. A number of other mining compan
ies with properties in that same Black
canyon district, which have been
holding back until the Kay proved
the district will now commence de
velopment work. The Big Copper
Chief, with headquarters at Phoenix,
has had several prominent business
men from the east on the property in
the past few weeks and plans have
been announced of starting extensive
work on the property.
The force of miners had been in
creased at the United Arizona Cop
per company's mine, east of Cordes.
The winez on the 800 level is in splen
did ore, indicating that the values are
becoming better as the water level is
reached. The ore is a chalcopyrite
similar to the Kay ore. A new 80
horsepower hoist is to be installed.
There is much new activity in the
different nearby camps. In the Cop
per mountain district the Big Bug
Copper company has the making of a
remarkably rich mine. ' The Victory i
Copper company has a 1000-foot shaft
well under way on a promising prop
erty west of the L'inghampton mine;
excellent progress is being made on
the new three-compartment shaft ati

Local parties have taken options on
several of the old silver-lead proper

plan being to install a central reduc
tion plant. A number of the old silver
properties west of this place have
been examined and reported on re

the district, however, is that of the

DISTRICTSWi GOVERNOR OF
BARNEY
COPPER
COMPANY WILL
To Combine With Porphyry
Company at Meeting
in Globe June 2
A special meeting of the stock
holders of the Barney Copper com
pany will be held June 2, 1919, in
Globe, for the purpose of taking ac
tion respecting a proposal to amend
the articles of incorporation of the
company in the following particulars:
First, by changing the name of the
company from Barney Copper com
pany to Porphyry Consolidated Cop
per company, and second, by chang
ing the capital stock from 15,000,000
dividend into 1,000,000 shares of the
par . value of $5.00 each, to 500,000
shares of the par value of $1.00 each.
The further purpose of the special
meeting is to effect a consolidation
of the Barney and Porphyry Copper
company, as explained in the letter
accompanying the inotice to istock
holders of which the following is a
copy:
To the Stockholders of Barney Cop
per company:
Enclosed herewith is notice of a
special meeting of the stockholders
of the company to be held at Globe,
Arizona, on June 2, 1919.
Since the formation of the Porphy
ry Copper company, 1 which as you
know, acquired the Philadelphia group
of claims and the easterly portion ot
the Barney group, the jexploratory
work within the Barney (Porphyry
group and its accompanying disclos
ures of ore have advanced to the point
where more active development of the
properties on a larger scale is both
justified and desirable. To finance
for this program the company should
have available for sale a larger
amount of treasury stock, and to ac
complish that result it has been pro
posed that a reorganization be made
of this company and of Porphyry cop
per -company, (in which this company
owns somewhat more than half of
the authorized capital stock.)
Taking into account this company's
stock interest in Porphyry Copper
company and the relative values ot
the properties : of the two companies,
it appears that the respective values
of the shares of the two companies
are represented approximately by 2.15
shares of Barney Copper company of
a given par value to one Bhare of
Porphyry Copper company of the
same par value. Barney Copper com
pany has a capitalization of 1,000,000
shares of $5.00 each, and Porphyry
Copper company a capitalization of
1,500,000 shares of $1.00 each. The
reorganized company would have a
capitalization of 5,000,000 shares of
$1.00 each, the name of the reorgan
ized company being Porphyry Con
solidated Copper company. In main
taining the relative values of the
stock of the two companies it is con
templated that each share of stock
of this company shall be exchanged
for, 3 shares of stock of the reor
ganized company, and that each share
of stock of Porphyry Copper company
shall be exchanged for 1 5-8 shares.
The exchange.on this basis will leave
somewhat more than 1,500,000 shares
in the treasury that can be sold for
development purposes. The plan has
the approval of- the holders of more
than two-thirds of the outstanding
stock of Barney Copper company and
we believe that the reorganization will
result to the advantage of the stock
holders. You are urged to be present at the
meeting referred to, but if you are
unable to attend, please execute and
return the enclosed proxy.

BE REORGANIZED
ACHIEVES REMARKABLE
BRINGING PROSRERITY
(Special N. E. A. Correspondent)
SALT1LLO, Mexico, May 3. There
is no more remarkable state govern
ment In Mexico and probably in the
world, than that of Coahuila, presided
over by the boy governor, Gustavo
Espinosa Mirles.
Espinosa Mireles is not yet 28 years
old, but his regime could be studied
with profit by grey-haired American
governors.
Mexico, an almost bankrupt nation,
can point to Coahuila as an example
of ripened fruit of the revolution.
Though Mexico's national credit is
weak at present, the state of Coahuila
can show its books to American fi
nanciers and obtain loans on favor
able terms.
This is solely due to the adminis
trative ability of the boy executive.
From Bankruptcy to Prosperity
When Carranza made his first stand
five years ago against Huerta tyran
ny, Gustavo Espinosa Mireles, then a
law student, .went with the "First
Chief" as private secretary.
He became in turn Coahuila's pro
visional governor and elected consti
tutional executive.' He took the chair
when the state was not only bank
rupt but had defaulted on the inter
est of the state school debt, contract
ed with the United States banks.
Today there is more money in Coa
huila's treasury than ever before in
its history. Its interior debt has been
paid, its expenses of administration
promptly settled and still there is a
respectable balance.
I found Goevrnor Mireles in his
private office, burrowing through a
huge pile of maps and reports. We
talked for hours, and here is what I
learned from him direct and about
him from the man on the street:
Coahuila's treasury ts respectably
filled with metallic coin and gilt edge
bonds; Coahuila's taxes have not ad
vanced since 1912; there are no dis
putes with foreign investors; the gov
ernor has just written the American
bankers asking in what form he shall
remit the interest on the school debt.
Organizes Workers and Raises Wages
. The worklngman has been taught
to organize, for mutual benefit; the
labor centers have been stripped of
saloons and gambling joints; the gov
ernor has won the confidence of the
workers to such extent that he has
always been able satisfactorily to ar
bitrate their differences with capital.
Fifty thousand organized coal min
ers look on him as a friend and just
arbitor. His program has been con
ciliatory, -and many refuge families
have been repatriated.
He has furnished the workingmen
BOLSHEVIK LET HUGE
RAILROAD CONTRACT
N0RWAYFINANG1ERS
CHRISTIANA, April 2 (Corre
spondence of the Associated Press).
A concession for constructing a rail
way 2,000 miles long has been grant
ed "in' principle" by the bolshevik
government of Russia to a financial
group headed by Eduard Hannevig, a
Norwegian, says a Norwegian lawyer,
M. Puntervold, who recently returned
from Russia.
The proposed railway is to extend
from the Obi river in the Tobolsk
government, via Kotlass to Petrograd,
Murmansk and Archangel. It is said
to include the right of utilizing 33,000
square miles of forest land through
which the railway is to be constructed,
mining rights along the railway and
the opening of banks at the railway
stations and towns near the line.
According to M. PJmtervold, the
terms granted are far more favorable
to capitalists than might have been
expected from the- most conservative
government in Norway. The news
paper Ti Dens-Tegn, commenting upon
the concession, says: "It is a proof
that Lenine's government is finding
it necessary to create a new capital
ism to encourage the economic life
o Northern Russia.

a man who had lived 20 years in

he studied educational systems, state

ONLY WAR SPIRIT CAN
PUT VICTORY LOAN
OVER WARNS DIRECTOR
There follow two recent statements
by Frank M. Smith, Federal District
Director of War Loans, which are well
worthy of attention:
"Let no one imagine, because the
Victory Liberty Loan eventually will
go over, that therefore they need not
do their part. When America enter
ed this war we knew that we were
going to win it but we only knew this
because we were absolutely certain
that every American soldier would act
as a hero, that every working man
would put his shoulder to the wheel
and produce the supplies needed and
last, but not least, that every true
American would pledge his past and
future earnings in loans to the gov
ernment. It was because we did these
things and only because we did these
things that the war ended as it did.
It is nothing but a repetition of these
methods and a continuation of this
spirit that will put over the Victory
Liberty Loan. I call upon every man.
woman, and even child to do his or
her part and do it promptly."
"Another aspect of the matter." said
Mr. Smith, "which I want to bring
very clearly before the public is this
short term Liberty Notes are not
likely to be subject to the fluctation
from which long term bonds have
suffered. It was with this idea in
mind that securities should never sell
at less than par that the Treasury
department decided to put out these
notes instead of bonds. It is my per
sonal opinion, in which I am supported
by a good many financial people, that
these bonds will maintain their value
from the very start."

Bisbee and the Warren district wel
come their returning fighters of Ari

The troops left El Paso early this
morninp in a special train, accom
panied by Governor Campbell and will
be dirtributed throughout the state
to their homes. Demobilization was
completed at Camp Owen Bierne, Fort
Bliss, Texas, and during their stay in
El Paso, they were dined and feted
by the hospitable folks of the . Pass
City. According to press reports no
returning heroes were ever given a
greater welcome than were the boys
of the 158th.
The boys are expected to reach their
homes as far a3 Phoenix by tonight.
In anticipation of the arrival of the
victorious warriors from this district.
Mayor Jacob Erickson has issued the
following address of welcome:
Mayor's Message of Welcome
"In the name of the City of Bisbee,
I welcome you on your .victorious
return from the battlefields of France.
The day that you shouldered rifle and

duty that will but add another great
chapter to the unblemished annals of
American history and American arms.
On the plains of Picardy you start
led the whole world when you were
thrown into the breach alongside the
gallant sons of France and England.
From that moment on, the fight you
made was one of ageressiori, ever go
ing forward and retreating not one
step in the face of the enemy. When
we look back upon your glorious
deeds our hearts are filled with a
pride which we cannot conceal.
During the long months that
you have been away from us

MAJOR SAM JOHNSON
PUTS DOWN MUTINY
VLADIVOSTOK, May 3. MaJ. aSm
Johnson, most picturesque character
of the American forces in Siberia,
with two American sergeants checked
a mutiny of Czech and Serb soldiers
and compelled the offenders to sur
render. Johnson is provost marshal
of Vladivostok. With his two ser -
geants he passed the barricaded oe -
defenses of the rebels and their sen-
tries and into the midst of the band,
and ordered them to follow him. -His
audacity awed them and they follow -
ed. He led them to a spot where
armed squads of military police were
concealed, then ordered them to sub-
mit to arrest. They surrendered.

stamps are now on sale in London.
They wouldn't carry a letter anywhere
but they will be eagerly sought as
addition- to stamp collections. The
bolsheviki stamps picture a hand
1 grasping a sword and- smashing the
. shackles of a chain. Behind the rising
sun symbolizes the awakening. One
Sinn Fein stamp bears a blue cross
and the word Erin, another is green
: and yellow, with the Irish harp, and
j the third bears a shamrock leaf, the
i segments carrying the pictures and
names of the three rebels who were
'executed.
Mystery Sailor
From U.S. Navy
Puzzles London
LONDON, May 3. Stripped of
his outside clothing, a young Amer
ican sailor was found in a semi
conscious condition in the early
morning several days ago on the
pavement outside a hotel In a fash
ionable west end district. His
socks were missing, but he wore
half-laced shoes which revealed
his connection with the navy.
At the United States Naval hos
pital to which he was removed, he
has been unable to give any ac
count of himself, not even his name
or address. He vaguely associates
home with the Great Lakes.
On the afternoon of the day he
was found, a pair of American na
val trousers and a hat were dis
covered in the grounds of Lord
Lansdowne's residence in Berkeley
Square. They apparently had bfcn
thrown over the wall from the
street.
The lad is not more than 20
years old and his height is 5 ft. 8'2
inches. He has rudd-y cheeks, mer
ry blue e'yes, fair wavy hair and
very white and even teeth'. When,
he recovered consciousness his
first words were, "Black Jack," and
"I won't sign it." He does not
know what he ment by those ex
pressions. PROHIBITION PUTS
Dipsomaniac Havens Prepare
to Close Their Doors
After July First
CHICAGO, May 3. Plans are be
ing made by owners of more than 200
drink cure institutions to discontinue
business with the coming of national
prohibition, according to officials of
institutions here. A few of the places
j may continue indefinitely as drug cure
sanitariums, but a large majority ex
pect to close within a year.
James E. Bruce, an official of a
drink cure corporation that adver
tises it has cured more than 500,000
victims of alcohol, said the prohibition
wave had for some time caused de
creased business.
"We figure there will be no. need
i for our institutions after the country
goes dry," he said. "However, we
expect business to increase for a few
months right after prohibition be
comes effective. Eut after that it will
rapidly decrease.
"A few years ago we had sixty
branches in operation throughout the
country. Today we have twenty-six.
Drug cases constitute about 25 per
cent of our business, the number be
ing about the same as before the
Harrison anti-drug law went Into ef
fect five years ago. But we do not
think it would pay to continue treat
ing drug cases alone.
"Adoption of a bone dry prohibi
tion by a number of states has de
creased business in many sections.
Business also fell off during the war,
but last fall it picked up again at
about the time the influenza epidemic
and has been fairly good ever since."
An official of one of the oldest chain
of drink cures in the country ex
pressed the view their institutions
would remain open for at least a year
after the coming of national prohibi
tion. He admitted that beyond that
the future was uncertain. Two yeara
ago -this concern operated fifty
branches. Today the number has
been reduced to fewer than twenty.
He said a-few of the branches might
be continued permanently for, drug
users who, since the passing of the
Harrison anti-drug law, "are confined
very largely to the wealthy classes
and residents of the underworld."

ON SELF
Vote Was Taken Even in Venetia After Austria Had Been
Driven Out Before It Was Annexed; All World
Watches Conflict With Wil son Principles
Sixty years ago Italy, now charged
with imperial ambitions because of
its insistence on possession of the
whole Dalmatian coast was a group
of disunited states '
They were brought together under
the banner of the House of Savoy
through the genius of Cavour, prime
minister of the kingdom of Sardinia,
and the devotion of men like Mazzini
and Garibaldi.
Cavour, chiefly responsible for the
United Italy of today , permitted no
annexation of. territory without a vote
of the people involved.
Piedmont and the Island of Sar
dinia formed the kingdom about which
modern Italy gathered. The congress
of Vienna had undone the work ot
unification that had been started
under the Napoleonic regime when
Lombardy and Venetia became king
dom of -Naples the first united Italy
since the days of ancient Rome.
Cavour's first principal was "the
consent of the governed" and his plan
was w nave aarmma anve out Aus-;

the congress of Vienna and then a,

then he set out to win the aid of

Cavour gave Italy's support to the
allies against Russia in the Crimean
war, thereby got a seat at the peace
table and there made an appeal for

AMERICAN BUSINESS PREPARING BIG
DRIVE FOR POST-WAR FOREIGN TRADE
BY CARL SANDSBURG
N. E. A Staff Correspondent. Chicago.
Nearly everything big, powerful and
efficient in American business, com
merce and finance is here, through
2000 delegates, at the convention of
the National Foreign Trade council.
Skill and speed in American shops
and factories is making more goods
than we can sell in our own coun
try, and therefore, we must find ways
to sell the surplus of goods to out
side countries that, in short, is the
statement of the national danger be
ing considered by the convention.
As described by James A. Farrel,
president of the United States Steel
corporation and chairman of the Na

steps are immediately necessary:
"Constructive consideration of the
needs of American foreign trade en

DETERMINATION PLAN
Italy. Napoleon was moved, as Ca
vour intended he should be. He gave
the desired aid up to . the point ol
driving the Austrians out of Lom
bardy. Then, because he did not want
to see Italy too strong, he deserted
Cavour. But revolts were under way
and one by one the petty states of
the Italian peninsula came under-the
rule of the house of Satoy, in each
case by a vote of the people after the
local rulers had been overthrown. In
the provinces of Savoy and Nice, the
vote favored union with France and
therefore these districts were ceded
to France.
During the- seven weeks' war be
tween Austria and Prussia in 186G,
Italy fought on the side of Prussia
and Austria was made to cede Ve
netia to Italy and it was annexed after
a favorable vbte of the inhabitants.
The annexation of Rome, seat of
the papacy, in 1870 was also made
after a plebisrite and Italy became
the Italy of today.
Trentino Italian Beyond- Question
The Trentino is as much Italian as
Lombardy cr Venetia, in language and
. ...
manners, ana tnere is ample evidence
of eariy Roman occupation. Istria and
Triest were thoroughly Roman In the
days of Rome's greatness. But Trieste
in the fourteenth century, did fight

the imperative necessity of bending
their energies to the prompt solution
of these problems. "Foreign Trade
Essential to American Industry' is
our theme."
Some of the Suggestions
Here are summaries of points and
suggestions from speakers before the
convention: ,
EDWARD PRIZER. president Vac

crisis unless we alrgely and rapidly
increase exports in finished products.
Export cotton in fabrics, not in bale;
iron in steel in machinery and im
plements; leather in shoes. Use our
coal under our own factory boilers.
Supply what the foreigner uses and"
always calls for. Set aside all re
strictions on tnpde, including anti
trust laws. Remove uncertainty of
transport and mail through regular
sailings and quick, movement of
ships." .

Peddlers are "bumboats" and a
"beach comber" is one who bums

MICHIGAN EXTOLS
BRIGHT PROSPECT
OF MINES AT AJQ
New Cornelia's Development
Attracting Widespread
Attention in East
The Iron Ore, of Ishpeming, Mich.,
a leading mine publication of that
state, publishes in a recent issue a
two page illustrated article on the
New Cornelia Copper company at Ajo,
from which the following is an ex
cept: - "I'yteb
The New Corne:ia Copper company
controlled by the Calumet & Arizona
Mining company and engaged in the
mining and leaching of copper ore at
Ajo, Ariz., has made a remarkable
record during the short time it has
been operating. Entering the produc
ing class shortly after Uncle Sam en
tered the great European struggle, the
ccmpany had turned out 67,805,760
pounds of copper to April 1, 1919, and
is now a larger producer than the par
ent organization. To achieve this re
sult meant the treatment of 2,894,631
tons of ore, so it is plain that there
has been no loafing on the job and
that every effort was extended with
the red metal for war work.
Cpsts Under War Conditions Low
This copper has been produced at
a very low cost, in fact, it is stated
upon good authority that there is only
one copper mining company doing
business in the states that is mak
ing copper at a lower figure. And the
present low costs will be materially
reduced when conditions readjust
themselves and the cost of doing
business is less than it is at present;
and a readjustment is certain to take
place.
Operations have been curtailed in
the mine at the leaching plant, only
about 4,000 tons of ore being treated
daily, whereas approximately 5500
tons were treated each day in Janu
ary. The working force has been re
duced over one-iiiird, with 600 men
on the payroll today, and wages have
been lowered. The management does
not feel justified in giving copper
away and it is not believed that capa
city prcduction will again be attained
until the market conditions are bet
ter stabilized.
The pit is being worked one 8-hour
shift, and underground mine two.
Visitors From All Over the World
New Cornelia took the lead in the
leaching cf carbonate ores of low
grade on a large scale and showed
the mining world what was possible
by such a method of treatment. It is
not at all strange that metallurgists
and mining engineers from all over
the: world have journeyed to Ajo. to
inspect and study the work ofljthe
pioneer leaching company, and it is
more than likely that several plants
of a similar nature will be installed
in this and ' other countries, where
carbonate ores cf commercial grade
are to be found. The Chili Copper
company now has a leaching plant at
its South American property and is
handling a large tonnage, with very
good results, we are informed, al
though the Chili ores carry nitrates
not to be found in the Ajo ores and
there was trouble at the- outset. The
nitric acid which formed caused many
difficulties now overcome.
Two Large Mines
With the addition of the Ajo Con
solidated, taken over in August, 1917,
New Cornelia now has two-good sized
mines. The consolidated property ad.
joins on the southeast and is an un
derground proposition, although there !
i3 a little tonnage that can be mined j
with steam shovels. The main minei
is the pit on the original holdings, and
it is from here that the bulk of the
ore has been mined to dato. Only
such ore has been taken from the
underground mine as has been en
countered in the development work.
The Ajo district has not been very
thoroughly prospected, and it would
not be at all surprising if other val
uable mines would be developed. The
territory to the west for several miles
contains seme good looking ground.
In the opposite direction, about 15
miles away, is the Cunsight district,
where gold is heing found." Some
work is being tarried on here on a
small scale with a- small experimental
mill in operation. ' ., '
New Cornelia has a large stretch of
territory, including the towhsite of
Ajo, where fine business 'blocks, hos
pital, plaza and many fine homes have
been builtvby the company. A large
school building is now under .con
struction. Lots can be purchased or
leased on easy terms, and water and
lighting service are furnished at reas
onable rates. The town has an air
cf permanency, everyone being of the
opinion that Ajo is going to be a first
class mining community for a great
many years, and these predictions are
justified.
There are two other townsltes
Gibson and' Clarkston, where some
of tHu nteii employed by the New Cor
nelia make their homes. ,

Story Pop ulation Tells
FIUME, cause of the deadlock in the peace congress has a population
of 32.000 of which 27,000 are Italians. The remainder are Croats. It is
Croatia's seaport, but Italy claims possession because of its Italian popu
lation, because of conquest and because Italv has constructed extensive
harbor works there.
DALMATIA has a population of 612,669 Serbo-Croats, according to
the last Austrian census, and 18,082 Italians, but the Italians dominate in
the coast cities and it ,is this region; between the coast and the moun
tains that . Italy now wants. ' Originally she was willing to divide the
seaports with the Jugo-Slavs.
The armistice put under Italion control all the territory, and a little
more, than was granted Italy by the secret treaty of London. Now she
would hold all she occupies.

BY O. B. JOYFUL .
Life among the cops of Kansas Citj
is something like this:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. A telephone
ring at the Ninteenth-street police
station was answered by Jake Rabino
witz, booking clerk. Mrs. Anna Cun
ningham, social worker for the board
or public welfare, at the other end of
the telephone, gave Rabinowitz the
name of a wayward girl, who had left
her home recently, preferring to live
In a hotel.
"Please have the girl terreeted.T
Mrs. Cunningham added, "and hold
her for her mother. The J?irl is
feeble minded."
Rabinowitz hung up the receiver.
He glanced at the clock and saw his
lunch period ad arrived. After writ
ing this note to LL James J. O'Rourke,
his superior officer, Rabinowitz went
to his luncheon:'
Dear Loot: Send harness bull to
Hotel , and pick up Miss .
She is evil minded. JAKE.
Moving men would go to the poor
house if all families were
like this:
DARKESVILLE, W. Va. Mr. and
Mrs. Charles Butler celebrated their
fiftieth wedding anniversary in the
same house in which they began mar
ried life. They had never moved.
The other day we printed a story
about a western man suing his wife
for divorce because she refused to
talk to him. And now we record the
fact that John Tubrick of Buffalo,
N. Y., is advertising for a "nice young
deaf mute lady," who wishes to marry.
This'll make! other gardners envious.
FONTANA, Pa. Mrs. Elsie Boyer
13 proud because she taised a radish
that weighs more than three pounds
and is 14 inches in circumference.
Dynamite is dangerous, and so are
machine guns, but nothing man has
invented begins to compare with the
hind hoof of a mule. Why a dead
mule can kick harder than Jess Wil
lard can hit.
FREELJNG, Va. Preston Lynckous
a miner, was hauling a dead mule
away from the coal chutes, where it
had been accidentally killed, when
one of its hind legs was caught by a
post, and when released the Toot,
with a heavy shoe on it, struck him
on the head, sending him to the hos
pital. You said it when you said mother
love was something man,
cannot understand:
ELGIN, O Mrs. Elmer Niles of
Sheffield township, owns a hen which
adopted five orphan rats, whose
mother had been killed in a trap.
The baby rodents cuddle up to the

the war was awarded today to the
shipping board to the Ninth or Great
Lakes district. Held by canal restric
tions to a lighter type of vessel than
was built on the seaboard, the dis
trict did not produce so many net
tons as other sections, but outstrip
ped all other districts in the num
ber of ships. In one year it put into
service 125 more vessels than were
delivered from all American yards in
the year before the United States en
tered the war.
At the- outbreak of the war, Great
Lakes yards, which had developed a
highly efficient type of cargo car
rier, were at work ori. 100 bottoms for
foreign account. All were requisition
ed by the shipping board and the first
ship turned over to .the board under
its war program was the Limoges,
a 2930 t'n freighter,' built at Toledo.
Twenty-seven ships were finished and
put to sea before the canal froze in
1917.
While winter gripped the Lakes
new work was continued and the ex
isting fleet, even old boats which
had been laid up were overhauled.
Summer saw every available craft
worked and overworked as never be

"If Ye Break Faith With Us Who Died, We Shall Not Sleep"
At this time when prayers of gratitude and devout thanksgiving are
on the lips of millions of mothers of America, when each day thousands
of our boys are being returned to the arms of those who so loved them,
when each city, each village, is echoing with cheers for its heroes
at BUCh a time it Is peculiarly fitting that we should be called upon to
help pay the price of the victories and the triumphs that our sons have
achieved.
We are now asked to subscribe to the glorious victory Loan. Asked
to subscribe? No, let us rather say that we have been invited to share
the opportunity and honor of subscribing. What man is there worthy of
the title of manhood who did not yearn to stand shoulder to shoulder with
our splendid boys who fought those memorable, those bitter and bloody
battles at St. Quentin, Cambrai, and St. Souplet; at St. Mihiel, Chateau
Thierry, and in the Argonne forest? What man is there who will not
covet the honor of paying in money for the victories that our boys
bought with their own life's blood.
Oh, how little have we done, how little can we do to repay those
who have suffered and died for us, those brave sailor lads who kept
grim watch on ocean lanes, themselves in constant peril frtim the ma
rauding murderers of the sea; those other lad3 who went into the hell
of battle with a smile on their lips, who were shot to pieces, seared by
poison-gas, burned with liquid flames, wrenched soul from body by
bursting shells, killed by the flying scythe of steel, frozen in the icy
waters of the trenches, drowned like rats in the bogs of Flanders, who
fought and bled and died until the cemeteries behind the lines grew
to forests of white crosses.
We can do little for them, and yet we con do this. We can pre
serve and sacredly maintain the honor of the nation that they defended. .
We can pledge our labor and our substance to a complete payment of the
debt incurred by this nation in the cause for which they died.
Four Liberty Loans to the astounding total of more than eigh
teen billions of dollars have borne eloquent testimony to the unity, the
loyalty, and the enduring patriotism of our Nation. Now must our people
put the capstone to this splendid structure.
Thi3 will not be easy of accomplishment with the fever of conflict
past, for it takes a higher, a finer type of patriotism to serve the nation
now than was required in the delirium of war. For the other loans
were raised in the heat and passion of battle, when the spurs of defeat
were being pressed against our sides, when' the black battalions of the
enemy with their thundering millions of men and guns were rocking
the world with fearful blows, when the Prussian legions stood on the
very heights of Paschaendale Ridge and looked upon the coveted waters
of the English Channel.
Now that task is finished. The incorruptible and supreme equity is
asserting itself once more. The disturbers of the peace and balance of
the world have been put down, and the fires of patriotism, turned to white
heat in the roaring converter of war, are dying. We are returning to the
sober process of normal life and we are forced to face the cold facts
of our obligations in the solemn light of reason.
But our imaginations would indeed be cold and our hearts would
be hard if we were so soon to forget the magnitude of the enterprise that
we have won, if now at this time of triumph we were ever even to haggle
over the price of victory.
' For this is indeed and in truth a Victory Loan. No longer are we
asked to give our money to an uncompleted cause. This great business
is finished. By these copmitments now presented for payment we have
-silenced eternally pray God the frightful crash and roar of the ar
tillery that belched and blazed from -the North Sea to" the Alps; by these
commitments we have stilled the poignant grief that was wringing mil-".
lions of mother-hearts; by these same commitments we have stopped
at last the vast casualty lists that day by day cast their black and fright
ful shadows over our imaginations lists whose every name sent a shaft
of agony into some woman's breast.
I Were those colossal expenditures then worth while? Were these
billions well spent? Was it right that we should have been prodigal
with moneythat we might not be prodigal with human lives that we
might bring agonizing conflict to so swift and so victorious a con
clusion? To such a consummation how gladly would America have pledged
every dollar of her resources! How willingly would any true American
give all he possessed to this cause and for this purpose, if such a su
preme sacrifice were required! And yet we are now asked merely to,
lend not give; , to lend our money at interest at a most generous in
( terest and with the United States Government itself as security.
What man., could be deaf to such an appeal or recreant to such a
compelling duty? What man could name this act as sacrifice? Can it
be called a sacrifice to invest our money in interest-bearing bonds of the
government, to make secure ' the liberty and freedom that have been
won by the blood of our sons?
Sacrifice?' How lightlyhow easily that word falls from our lips.
,' Have we sacrificed? Where then, are our ruined cathedrals, our shat
tered and broken homes, our devastated fields and factories? We sac
rifice who have known nothing of the horror of huge guns that ranged
our countryside, ravaging them with harassing fire, nothing of great
Zeppelins hovering over our cities and dropping death. Where are our
refugees, our widows, our orphans? Where in this wide land does hunger
stalk or pestilence claim whole townships for its victims? What cai
we say, whose bins are bursting with grain? Where are our bankrupt
and prostrate industries? How can we answer, whose trade is past all
computation, epochal in its unprecedented figures? There is only one
real sacrifice that with bowed head and brimming eyes we have laid on
the altar. Seventy thousand of our beloved sons sleep under little white
crosses on the hills and plains of France. This is our offering. Shall we
dishonor their names and diminish their glory by faltering in the cheer
ful performances of our Imperative duty?
No! It cannot be that the mothers and fathers who gave four
million sons to die, if need be, that liberty might survive, will now
haggle and quibble over the material cost of saving the very soul of
civilization. It cannot be that one hundred million Americans will for
feit the glorious inheritance received from their fathers who fought
first for American libetry, an Inheritance that has gained an added
radiance, an increased glory, a new splendor, that has been made more
precious by the victories of our own boys in an even higher, an' even
greater cause the emancipation of the world.
The patriotism of our nation will not be appealed to in vain. The
fountains of enthusiasm in the hearts of the people must be renewed
and sustained. We must come to this great undertaking wjtb a
loyalty, with a courage not bred of passion for war, but a passion for
right and for honor, with that higher courage, that more enduring patriot
ism so necessary to the great undertakings of peace. We must and will
respond to the call as never before, knowing that our own sons are here
among us, bearing witness to our acts. This loan must be subscribed and
oversubscribed so that a last glorious chapter will be added to the bright
lexicon of America's achievements in the Great War.

Folks Interested in consistency will be glad to know that it is out
rageous for other nations to interfere with the internal affairs of Rus
f sla but that it is perfectly proper for Russia to send an army into Hun
gary and actively promote civil war in every nation on eartht including
the United States.

Mike Cassidy says that while the
new skirts are much shorter, still it
makes the men look a whole -Jot
longer.
Inasmuch as we haven't received
one of the latest model bombs,, we
take it that we haint of much im
portance. "Bessie," it is said isn't the first

that's what we've heard.
According to the almanac, a new
moon is scheduled for the. 15th of the
month. The police ought to be able
to see at least one "moonshine."
We are in favor of the league of
nations covenant containing the fol
lowing added points:
The isolation of eggs that are so
aged they could escape the draft law.
A Maxim silencer for the city fire
alarm.
The location of a young lady who
would be content to spend an even
ing the day before payday and noth
ing else.
And we would like to hear of:
An oil well that isn't flowing more
than ten thousand barrels daily.
A non-leakable fountain pen that
isn't leakable.
Ajoung lady who didn't marry a
man just to reform him.
A book agent that hasn't got the
works of the world"s greatest men. .
The name of a great man who
wasn't born in a log cabin-and who
didn't have to tramp twelve miles to
school each morning. .
A young lady who thinks that paint
and powder is vulgar.
A young lawyer that isn't promising.
A bell-boy who would refuse a tip.
An old man who wasn't once the
best athlete of his younger days.
An old maid without any hopes.
Did you ever notice that, the people
on the sidewalk at a fire can usually
fight the fire better than the men who
are up in the flames.
And did you ever, notice the horrid
glances a check receives at a dinner

We'll say so.
What's become of the old fashioned
boy who used to refer to Dad as "Pop"

Do you still remember that Friday
night was the great night under the

What is to become of the old time

And a modern politician who would

KING VICTOR MAY BE
DEPRIVED OF SCEPTRE
IMMANOEL -
Italian- expansionists have stirreu
:tip big demonstrations in Italy for
annexation of Fiume and the Dal
matian coast, regardless of con
sequences. But there is a strong
democratic element in the country
which is opposed to annexations as
an outgrowth of the war, and out of
the situation may spring any day a
full-fledged revolution which will "de
pose King Victor Emmanuel III and
set up a republic. 1

RAINBOW DIV. IS CUT
65 PCT. BY CASUALTIES
WASHINGTON, May 2. Only about
35 per cent; of the more than 22,00v
men .composing the 42d (Rainbow)
division, as it returned from France,
were members of the original division
as organized at Camp .Mills, N. Y.
Practically all of these men, it was
learned today, have been wounded or
otherwise incapacitated during the
months of service. They had been re
turned from the hospitals and rest
camps to the division and when it
received orders for home, a special
effort was made by the division staff
to get together all the original Rain
bow personnel who had survived the
rigors of the campaign. .... '
The intense activity of the division
during the fighting is shown by the
number of replacement troops which
passed through its muster rolls dur
ing that period. This number is placed
by officers of the division at approxi
mately 67,000 men against the lull
war strength of -27,500. Toward the
end of the fighting, however, many
of the men sent forward in replace
ments were original members of the
Rainbow division, who had recovered
and returned to duty.
The last elements of the 42d arrived
yesterday at Newport News.
If the I. W. Ws hoped to "get" Ole
Hanson, mayor of Seattle,' by sending
him a bomb through the mails, the
joke is on them. The mail was de
layed and the package was broken
as usual.
PERFECTLY CONTENTED
One of our soldier boys expressed
his feelings to the home folks -in a
telegram the last week as follows:
"Deloused, demobilied and zdelight-ed."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 3. A wide var
iety of issues shared in the generally
higher level of prices on the stock ex
change today, the volume of trading
for the two hours keeping pace with
the extraordinary activity of preced
ing sessions of the week.
Tobaccos of the investment class
rose 4 to 7 points several of the less
prominent equipnTents 2 to 7 points,
standard and secondary raise 2 to 8
points, and motors and their acces
sories 1 to 3 joints.
Metals, especially coppers, also re
corded substantial gains.
Food, chemical and fertilizer shares
.trailed along in moderate fashion, but
oil3 denoted profit taking.
United States Steel retained only
half its 1 point gain.
Denver and Rrio Grande common
and preferred, the latter at a gain of
2 points featured the minor rails.
Sales amounted to 773,000 shares.
An actual loan expansion of about
$117,500,000 was attributed to the
week's heavy trading and Victory loan
subscriptions, excess reserves show
ing only a nominal decrease.
The several divisions of the bond
market, including Liberty and foreign
issues, were firm. Total sales, par
value, aggregated $6,350,003. Old
United States coupon 4's advanced Vi
per cent on call during the week.
WEEKLY REVIEW
NEW YORK, May 3. Almost the
only cloud over the stock market this
week was the suspension of the extra
disbursement on United States Steel
common, reducing .-its dividend status
to the pre-war rate and offering addi
tional evidence of the general reaction
in that industry. :
This was further borne out by the
quarterly statement in which monthly
earnings showed a steady decline, the
aggregate being the smallest for any
similar period sirjcl the middle of
1915.
Apart from these developments the
market, in the main, moved to higher
ground, regardless of the note of cau
tion sounded by conservative financial
interests and the extensive cashing in
of speculative profits, which accom
panied such warnings. .
Shippings proved a natural concom
itant of the more extensive accumula
tion pf peace industrials, the latter
also . embracing food, fert,Nizer and
chemical shares of companies con
verted to a post war basis.
The movement as a whole was
laffain niainlv accelerated hv faviirahlp
domestic factors which laid the foun
dation for the rise some ten weeks
ago. Chief among these were the ex
cellent crop outlook, general business
conditions, which improved substan
tially during the month of April, and
the greater strength of the country's
economic position. .
FEDERAL .DISCOUNT INCREASES
WASHINGTON, May 3. Discount
operations of the federal reserve
banks showed a marked increase dur
ing the last week, according to the
federal reserve board's weekly finan
cial statement. Bills discounted se
cured by Liberty bonds or certificates
increased $28,000,000. Gold reserves
fell $2,600,000, while deposits dropped
$20,000,000 and the reserve percentage
declined from 52.1 to 51.7 per cent.
WEEKLY BANK CLEARINGS
NEW YORK, May 3. The actual
condition of clearing house banks and
trust companies for the week showed
that they hold $36,744,180 reserves in
excess of legal requirements. This is
a decrease of $S,743,720 from last
week.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 3. Prospects of de
layed planting as a result of too much
rain led to fresh advances today in
the corn market. Closing quotations
were strong, 29ic to 3o net higher,
with July $1.6S to $1.GS and Sep
tember $1.64 to $1.61. Oats gain
ed c to lc and provisions 5c to 25c.
Buyers were in a majority through
out the day in the corn pit, and there
was a notable lack of otferings at
times, especially when th cprincipal
shorts tried to cover. Widespread
wet weather and the forecasts that
field and atmospheric conditions
would continue adverse for at least
several days appeared to indicate that
lateness of the planting season might
become an important factorin deter
mining I he ultimate yield.
Oats responded to the advance of
orn. Crop reports, too; resare'ving
oats, were against the bears.
The rise in provisions were ascrib
ed to strength of grain and hogs.
Sales to realize profits did not alto
gether counterbalance the effect.
THE COPPER MARKET
NEW YORK, May 3. The. copper
market has been quiet during the past
week, but prices have held generally
steady. Small offerings at 15 c for
electrolytic sernied to have been ab
sorbed during, the earlier part of the
week and while some dealers quoted
15 today the larger producers were
faiJ to be holding for 15 delivered
and to be making a few sales at that
level.
THE COTTON MARKET
NEW" YORK. May Cotton cJos-'eil
at 26.66 witli the geneial list closing
steady at a net cU-dujo ot 2 .0 1-'
