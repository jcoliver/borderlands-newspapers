WASHINGTON, Jan. 30. Debate jn
President Wilson's world peace ad
dress enlivened the Senate for several
hours today before it was baited by
concerted aittion of administration
leaders. Then Senator Cummins' mo
tion to take up his resolution to set
aside time for a general discussion of
the subject was tabled by, a Jte of
38 to 30.
Wilsonites Win.
Senators Hitchcock and Williams of
the foreign relations committee intro
duced the resolution to kill the Cum
mins resolution. Senator Martin of
New Jersey being the only Democrat
refusing to support them in their con
tention that the clogged condition of
the legislative calender made the ac
tion J-necessary. Republicans voted
solely against the motion to table.
The discussion will not serve fj check
intermittent debate, Senators Lodge.
Borah and other Republicans "having
served notice that they would address
the Senate on the subject in the near
future.
But Cummins Has "Say"
Senator Cummins spoke at
length today, declaring that to
carry out President Wilson's sug
gestion would necessitate -the
creation of a world jAjwer that
would destroy the sovereignty of
nations and lead the United States
inevitably either into constant
world war or constant rebellion
against the authority of the world
sovereignty his peace league plan
would create.
Wrongly Interpreted.
Replying Senator Hitchcock insisted
that the Iowa senator's criticisms
were based upon an erroneous convic
tion that the President proposed a
new military world power to enforce
peace. The President, Senator Hitch
cock declared, advocated diminution
of armament, the rule of reason and
the right jf all nations to work out
their own pilicy, "unhindered, un
threatened and unafraid."
Praising the President's purpose in
seeking to bring an end to the war
and eulogizing much of his address.
Senator Cummins confined his criti
cism to his own interpretation of con
ditions which Mr. Wilson would im
pose on America's joining a league to
(nl'jrce peace.
Supreme Power Unstable.
"There is but one conclusion that
can be drawn from the President's
utterances," he declured "It is that
over all the nations of the earth there
shall be a common and supreme pow
er, whicb will not only undertake to
decide all the controversies which
may lead to disturbance, but which
baing entering judgment upon them
will compel oliedience There i but
tne way in which obedience can al
ways be compelled. The protesting
or rebellious nation must be overcome
by force of anus.
Compare Monroe Doctrine.
"That I am right in the interpreta
tion which I have put upon the mes
sage is further proved by the analogy
which he finds between the Monroe
c'jctrine and his doctrine of the world.
I will not pause to point out that In
stead of analogy there is utter re
pugnance: but evidently there is a
parallel In his mind, and that is suf-!
ficient for my present purposes. Those !
who think that the President does not
intend that the decisions of the league
of nations are to be executed by force
have but to remember that if any
foreign nation were to attempt to
invade the American Monroe doctrine
there is but one way for the United
States to enforre it- Without the
force of arms, either actual of poten
tial, behind It, our policy in this re
gard would be the emptiest bravado."
In concluding his address the Iowa
senator said he stood with the PresI

New Prosperity Mark Reach
ed By Billion Dollar Corpo
ration, With Fat Dividends
for Stockholders.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Jan. 30. All previous
"prosperity" records In the history of
the United States Steel Corporation
were surpassed today when the direc
tors declared an extra dividend of
1 3-4 per cent on the (tinimon stock,
together with the regular quarterly
disbursement of 1 1-4 per cent for the
fourth quarter of 1916, and issued a
statement of earnings for the same j
period exceeding by far all similar ex
hibits of past years, as well as more .
than fulnlliug the. most optimistic!
forecasts.
The earnings for the quarter,
amounting to $10.r,988,347, brought the
years total earnings lo I. ti-'j,
which ni'jre than doubled those of
1907 which, showing earnings of $160,
364,674, stood as the record year until
the close of 1916.
The total earnings for tlie quarter
covered in today's statement compare
with the total of $83,817,067 for the
third quarter of 1916, a sum which
then constituted a record.
The total 1916 earnings compare
with $140,250,066 in 1915.
With today's extra disbursement,
the total dividends on the common ,
shares for 1916. amount to 8 3-4 per
cent The extra common disburse-'
meut calls for an outlay of $8,895,294.!
This makes the total dividend di.-1
bursement for the fourth nuarter. in-
eluding the reeular 1 1-4 Der cent com-'
mnn Hivi.tunrl unH the hsuhI 1 t-4 ner I
mon dnideua ana tne usual l i PH

Vj $21,r)33,996. Some surprise was ex-
pressed in financial quarters because
the directors did not declare a larger
dividend return in the face of the
enormous earnings of the fourth quar
ter.
Analysis of this financial period
shows that the corporation was not
materially handicapped by the short
age of coal and cars and labor.

Note's Resume Broadcast
Prematurely.
(l!y Review I.easfd Wire.)
. NEW YORK. Jan. 3d From the
files of a Wall Street brokerage
house, congressional inquisitors
today brought to light private and
confidential telegrams regarded in
some instances as definitely in
dicating that there was a "leak"
on President Wilson's recent
peace note.
Huttons Scored "Beat"
The most sensational telegram
Containing a brief but remarkably
accurate forecast of the contents
of the note, was sent by E. F. Hut
ton & Co., one of the largest brok
erage houses in the street, over
its private wires to scores of oth
er brokers with whom it did busi
ness throughout the country on
the afternoon of December 20,
more than three hours before the
first copies of the note were hand
ed to newspaper men by Secreta
ry Lansing.
Hours Too Early
At the .time the Hutton message
was sent, according to the testimony
of Secretary Lansing before the com
mittee in Washington, no one in this
country save persons connected with
! the DreDarntion and desnatrh of the
note has as much information resard-
i ing its contents as the message re-
vealed. The note previously had been
sent abroad in code.- Publication of
the note followed transmission of the
Hutton message to various brokers by
more than ten hours.
Brother-in-Law Mentioned
of President Wilson, is a partner.
Connelly was declared by Hutton to
be hastening to New York tonight to
appear before the committee tomor
row. Hutton Acted on Rumor
Hutton testified that his understand
ing was that Connelly's information
regarding the note was based on gen
eral rumor. Indicative that other
brokerage houses were inpossession
of similar information. Hutton said,
was another message he produced
which Clement. Curtis & Company of
Chicago sent his house prior to Con
nelly's first message referring to a
i statement to be issued by the state;
j department, "intended to promote
j peace prospects." This message con-
: tainrd no details.

j Certain Members of the committee,
however, privately expressed the con
viction that the person who originally

Life is not merely to lie, but to
live well, eat well, d'gest well, work
well, sleep well, look w ell. What a
glorious condition to attain, and yet
how very easy it is if one will only
ad'opt the morning inside bath.
Folks who are accustomed to feel
dull and heavy when thty arise, split
ting headache, stuffy from a cold, foul
tongue, nasty breath, acid stomach,
can, instead, feel as fresh as a daisy
by opening the sluices of the system '
each morning and Hushing out the
whole of the internal poisonous stag- j
nant matter. j
Kveo'jne, whether ailing, sick or,
well, should, each morning, before
breakfast, drink a glass of real hot
water with a teaspoonful of limestone j
phosphate in it to wash from the
stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels the
previous day's indigestible waste,
sour bile and poisonous toxins; thus,
cleansing, sweetening and purifying
the entire alimentary canal before ;
putting more fool ir-to the stomach. !
The action of hot water and limestone
phosphate on an e7iipi.y sumach is
wonderfully invigorat.ng. It cleans
'jut all the sour fermentations, gases,
waste and acidity and gives one a
splendid appetite for breakfast. While
you are enjoying vour breakfast th"
wi'tcr and phosphate is quietly ex
tracting a large volume of water from
the blood and getting ready for a
thorough Hushing of all the inside
organs.
The millions of pcpl who ar
bothered with constipation, bilious
spells, stomach trouble, rheumatism;
others who have sallow skins, blood
disorders and sickly complexions are
urged to get a quarter pound Vf lime
stone phosphate from the drug store
which will cost very lilt!", but is
sufficient to make anyone a pro
nounced era Pi on the subject, of in
ternal sanitation. (Advertisement.)

Appears at the Lowell Theatre
in. Excellent Offering "The
Thoroughbred."
Frank Keenan, one of the greatest
stars ever on the legitimate state and
but lately converted to the motion
picture field, appears tonight at the
Central Theatre in Lowell in "The
Thoroughbred." This is a Triangle
feature and that fact, added to the
star, should be sufficient guarantee for
its worth.
Central Theatre is being Commend
ed on every side by the residents of
the eastern and southwestern end of
the district for its excellent motion
picture programs. With a select of
fering of Paramount features. Triangle
pictures and the best of any thing
else that may come to any of the
theatres in this section, the commenda
tion is well taken.
"The Thoroughbred" is a Southern
story and a capable cast is supporting
Frank Keenan in its delineation.

PEACE WITHOUT VICTORY."
Germans have given President Wilson's peace address
a warmer welcome than the Allies have. Germans take
more kindly than their foes to the dictum, "peace without
victory." Though boasting of victory Jierself, Germany
seems to regard defeat as inevitable if the war continues.
And thus the United States so long hated, is hailed as her
friend, who is to save her from destruction. Thus the
Allies would be robbed of their victory.
This is the view of most of the Allies. But the West
minister Gazette has sounded a different note. It main
tains that the acceptance of t,-e principles set forth by
the president, even if there should be no more fighting
and no military triumph for the Entente, would itself be
an overwhelming victory for the Allies.
"The ideals which President Wilson sets before us,"
says the British newspaper "are so remote from Prussian
militarism that their realization necessarily carries with
it extinction of German tyranny. His general idea of a
world at peace with a reign of law established and all
nationalities, great and small, living in freedom and se
curity, is such that he can only get what he wants if we
at the same time get what we want."
The New York Times adds: "Ask Germany if peace
on the terms set forth with specification and detail ia tie
president's address to the senate would not be the peace
of defeat for her, of victory for her foes." The plain im
plication Js that if Germany welcomes such a peace, it
will be a forced sacrifice of all her real aims for the sake
of saving her dignity and escaping punishment.
"To accept and indorse the president's address," says
the New York World, "Germany must revolutionize all its
previous theories of government. It must emancipate it
self from the policies of Prussianism. It must turn its
back upon the old gods of force and frightfulness. It must
set its heel upon despotism and become as completely a
new Germany as France of the Republic became a new
France after the downfall of Napoleon III.
"The words cf the president's address pre words that
no German government has ever understood, and if the
German governmetit now professes to understand them it
is because Germany is beaten and autocracy is forced to
surrender. It is no German peace that President Wilson
Las proposed to the world, hut a peace of democracy."
How could such a peace fail to be a victory for the
Allies? f they themselves can come to see it that way,
the prospects will soon brighten.
FRESH BREAD.
England has not been driven to the German expedient
of "war bread", but the British food regulator is said to
be planning something which mildly corresponds to it.
He wants to forbid the consumption of fresh bread. He
would forbid the sale of loaves within twelve hours after
they emerged from the oven.
The idea Is not, as many "dyspectic Americans" might
rashly assume, to protect the British stomach from the
ravages of freshly baked bread. The idea is that if the
bread is allowed to grow a bit stale before reaching the
consumer, he won't eat so much of it because he won't
like it so well. Thus the nation's flour supply will be
conserved.
Opponents of the plan soberly argue that there's no
economy in that, because if the bread is stale the people
will put more jam on it, and the extra jam will cost more
than the saved bread.
But why not get down to a scientific dietary basis, and
insist on the bread ageing a little before it's eaten, for the
simple reason that it's more nourishing and more whole
some that way? Any expert dietician can inform the
food regulator that bread just out of the oven, no matter
if it does taste good, isn't fit for human consumption.
PROBERS HIT UPON
HOT TRAIL OF LEAK
PRACTICAL EDUCATION.
The General Education Board has decided to turit our
educational system upside down. It has made up its
mind that we are all wrong with our straining after 'Vul
ture" and formal discipline", that we have been wasting
time and money and effort. We have been teaching
childhood and youth according to an artificial standard
established long ago. The new plan proposes to prepare
children to live the life of today and do the work of today.
The "dead languages" are to be dropped. All "dend
wood" is to be discarded. There is to be no more formal
teaching of grammar, with its endless and futile parsing,
diagramming and what not. Nothing is to be taught
merely because of its academic or theoretical interest.
Utility will be the tost, of everything. Mathematics will
be reduced t,o simple arithmetic, algebra, geometry, etc..
having a direct use in practical work. Hooks Hill Ik- used
less and the pupil's senses more. There will be "pictures,
lantern slides, charts, maps, .simp and laboratory, special
reading matter, discussions to give the pupils sufficient
contact with their industrial, social, economic, vocational
and domestic environment so as to derive the basis for
their school work from real situations." They will study
everything round about them, and so learn to know the
world and make themselves at home in it.
The board is starting in a .small but significant way. It
is putting its plan into operation in ( tie Tca he r:;' (',!
lege of Columbia. C'liiersity. teaching tca li'-rs who .ir

The 'experiment is bound to result in improvement,
whether it revolutionizes our educational system or not.
Everybody knows that present education doesn't really
educate, thai perhaps half its cll'irl is wailel. Why
should boys and gills, wheu (hey go to work, have lu for-
UTOPIAN YUCATAN.
Maybe we've been wrong in thinking that no good can
come out of Mexico. An astonishing campaign of modern
social improvement has been going on in Yucatan. It is
largely due to Governor Salvador Alvarado. And Modesto
C. Holland, his assistant, expresses the conviction tat
"even the United States is going to find tilings in Mexico
worth copying by and by, after the reform has spread
from the peninsular state of Yucatan throughout the re
public, for the program is the same for all Mexico."
The most significant innovation is the reform of the
old system of land tenure, which has been at the bottom
of the country's revolutionary troubles. An area of more
than 70,000 square miles was held by 2.CD0 land-owners,
who contributed only $50,000 a year for public expenses.
The same land is now paying more than $3,1)00,000 taxes
a year, coming from the old landlords on an equitable
basis and from thousands of new landlords, and all of it
going to pay for legitimate public enterprises.
Some of the land was held by fraud. That was taken
away from the holders and distributed among the peas
ants. But it didn't go far, because there were 300.000
landless people. The government decided to make it
possible for every family to possess a 40-acre farm.
Knough property was taken from the big landlords lo
carry out the plan. But it was not confiscated. It was
bought at a fair price, and paid for in 50-year bonds bear
ing 4 per cent interest. The small farms were "lent" for
a period of two years to all who applied for them, to de
termine who was worthy. Of the 50.000 heads of families,
40,000 applied for farms, and nearly all of them made
good in the probation period. The farms were then given
them for their own.
That is but a part of the transformation. There are
now 2400 public schools in Yucatan, with evening sessions
for adults. There is an eight-hour law, a minimum wage,
workmen's compensation and old age pensions. Children
under 13 may not be employed. Boys under 15 and girls
under 13 may not work at night. Workshop sanitation
and safety are provided for. There Is compulsory arbi
tration of labor disputes. Women are given a month off,
with full pay. before and after childbirth.
It sounds too good to be true. And doesn't it shame us
a little, to think that some of these things are actually
being handled in despised Mexico better than in the
United States?
THE LEAK" QUEST.
Now that the famous "peace leak" has been turned
over to a capable lawyer who has nothing to do but quiz
witnesses, and is willing to assume the whole responsi
bility of dragging the truth to light, congress can get
back to its legislative jok
The "leak"business has been an unfortunate distrac
tion to a congress already laden with enough burdens
and responsibilities. The importance of this scandal has
probably been exaggerated. A few publicity-seekers anj
a few public men eager for partisan advantage have giveu
it undue emphasis. The fuss and excitement of it seemed
to demoralize congress and check its proper activities.
Now that body can proceed to function as usual, knowing
that whatever cause of scandal there was in the eel v
bratcd Wall Street peace-note capers will be dragged to
the light, the blame placed, and the guilty men. if tCere
are such, punished.
And at the spcctacle'of congress getting bark into th.
harness for the hard and necessary work that must be
crowded into the last month of the session, the nation
heaves a sigh of relief.
(Continued From Tas;e One)
Boiling Denies All
Chairman Henry, determined to
have Ellis testify, said he probably
would be examined next week in
Washington. Telegraph operators
and others who had to do with the
transmission of messages also are to
be interrogated. Other members of
the Connelly firm also probably will
be called. Mr. Boiling already has
testified at a Washington hearing that
he had nothing to do with a "leak" of
any kind.
Mr. Boiling's connection with the
Connelly firm was the subject of
much interrogation by Mr. Whipple
during his examination of Mr. Mut
ton, when the broker first took the
stand. Mutton told of Connelly call
ing on him five or six months ago, in
forming him that the firm of K. Con
nolly and Company was to be organ
ized, with Boiling as one of the part
ners, and asking if the Mutton firm
would become its New York corres
pondent. Mutton said the fact that Boiling
was to be a member of the firm had
I maue no impression upon nun. lie ue-
nied that Connelly had said anything
of an expectation of "getting high
class customers" through Boiling's re
lationship to the President. The Con
nelly aecount, he said, however, had
been "very attractive."
Whipple then had Mutton produce
messages which 'had gone over the
firm's private wires during the "peace
period" in the stock market and
which he had been commanded to
bring under subpoena. The fust to
te read was the Clement, Cuitis and
Company telegram, marked "Confiden
th:I," timed 12:43 o'clock eastern
ti:ne. which was about an hour and a
quarter after Secretary Lansing had
told the newspaper men in Washing
ton that a note was coming from the
I'resicier.t.-
Here's the Tip
"I hear that stat department will
issue statement today regarding e con
omic condition Europear war as af
fecting neutrals," the Clement mes
sage said. "Intended to promote
peace prospects. What do you think
cf this and how are ou on stocks?"
The next was Hutton's reply to this
timed 1:14 p. m., which re-id:
"Our Washington wire gives us sim
ilar message to 'yours. Others have
the same information. We put it out !
as it was more or less geneially
known. Your message was marked
confidential and we treated it so."
Some time between ihe receipt oi
the Chicago message and Hutton's
reply to It, the now missing message
from Connelly was received. Mutton
testified. This was the message on
which he based his message at 1:14
p. m.
Mutton also produced other com
munications his firm had sent its cor
respondents in which reference was
made to various Washington situa
tions. One of them said it was un
derstood the President's message of
last December 4, the opening day of
congress, would be favorable to rail
road Investments. Another written by
Mutton personally Baid that "Wash
ington advices" were that increased
freight rates probably would be grant
ed the railroads.
While describing the nervous state ;
of the financial district shortly prior J
to the issuance of the President's
note, owing to the top heavy specu
lative accounts amassed by the "pub
lic," Mutton gave 4he committee a
shoc k by casually announcing that bis
firm's outstanding loans against mar
gined accounts aggregated $28,000,000.
This condition, he said, was general
and was regarded by bankers as a
dangerous over-extension that might
result in a panic. The bankers had
begun to call loans, he said, with the
result that be had issued a notice th:it
his firm would not do business except
for cash or fifty percent margin, at-

While Mr. Fletcher is on' his way
to Mexico the withdrawal of General

It was indicated that the sending

LIKE ELECTRIC
BUTTON ON TOES
Tells why a corn is so painful
and Says Cutting Makes
them grow.
j'ress an electric button and you
form a contact with a live wire which
rings the bell. When your shoes press
! against your corn it pushes its
j Minrp roots down upon a sensitive
j nerve and you get a shock of pain.
Instead of trimming your corns,
; which merely makes them grow, just
i step into any drug store and ask for a
i quarter of an ounce of freezVme. This
jwill cost very little but is sufficient to
j remove every hard or soft corn or cal
lus from one's feet. A few drops ap-
plied dirertly upon a tender, aching
j corn stops the soreness instantly, and
sovn me corn snnveis up so u mis
right out. root and all, without pain.
This drug is harmless and never in
flames or even irritates the surround
ing tissue or skin. (Advertisement)

(By Review Leased Wire)
NEW YORK, Jan. 30. President
John K. Tener, of the National league,
said today that he1 will submit fj tlie
joint rules committee, which meets
here next month a recommendation to
increase the width ot uie home plate
from 17 to 18 inches and send a bats-j

Such a change in the rules, he de

"I believe simply sending a bats- j
man to first base on three bails in-
stead of t'jur would be too great a
change and would throw the balance
too much in ftivor of the batsman." j
Tener said. "By widening the plule .

have a better opportunity of getting:
the ball over, but such a change will ;
be about two thirds in favor of the
batsman. j

the plate would have more 'of a psy- j
