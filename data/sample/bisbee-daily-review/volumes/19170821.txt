(By Review Leaseo Wire)
SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 20. Peace
and quiet prevailed today throughout
the northwest states of Washington.
Oregon, Idaho and Montana, where a
strike of thousands ot Industrial
Workers of the World in the construc
tion, harvesting and fruit industries
was scheduled to take place under or
ders of the organization leaders. A sur
vey of the situation tonight sL'jwed
that every line of industry to be affect
ed by the proposed strike pursued its
normal, orderly way and so far as
could be ascertained only one attempt
was made to carry into effect the
strike order issued recently by James
Rowan, secretary of the district at
Spokane, calling on construction work
ers to lay down their tools.
The swift and unexpected action
last night of military authorities at
Spokane, acting in Conjunction with
Washington state officials, in arrest
ing Rowan and 26 other alleged mem
bers of the Industrial Workers of the
World, is believed to have exerted a
powerful influence ; in deterring the
radical members of the organization
from precipitating a strike, which, it
is admitted, would have serious and
far-reaching results. The arrests were
made at the instance 'of Colonel Clar
ence E. Dentler, commander of the
United States army in the northwest
because it was considered that the
proposed strike would interfere with
the prosecution of the war.
Military Prisoner
The 27 men who were arrested by
Major Clement Wilkins, in charge 'of
the national guardsmen who raided the
I. W. W. headquarters at Spokane, are
held as military prisoners and will be
examined within a few days, and some
of them, it was said, probably will be
released. The examination will be con
ducted by Major Wilkins and until he
has completed his investigation the
prisoners will be held incommunicado.
It was announced Today at the head
quarters of Col. Dentler at .Portland
that 15,000 troops were available in
the four northwest states for eventual
ities. Advices from Boise, Idaho, stated
that troops had been placed in the
Coeur d'Alene mining dUtrict to pre
serve order.
FiOm Seattle reports were received
that the I. W. W. construction work-
or not the First Arizona will be
come a part 'of General Tuthill's
command, the 79th brigade. Is not
definitely known, but it is pre
sumed that this will be the case.
Officers and men are eagerly
awaiting orders to move to the
Linda Vista camp, for this new
training post is situated less than
four miles from the Pacific ocean
on the Southern California coast;
ab'out 12 miles from San Diego
ani 100 from Los Angeles. A few
miles away is La Jolla, one of the
most popular of Southern Califor
nia beach resorts and, if study
hours are not too long, the First
Arizona b'oys intend to prove that
swimming, fishing and sailing are
just as much in their line as pa
trolling the border of Arizona and
Sonora.
Many of the officers and men
are already arranging to send their
families to San Diego, La Jolla,
Ocean Beach, Del Mar and other
places adjacent to Camp Kearny
and, according to Word from San
Diego, Southern California is plan
ning to make the stay of the Ari
sona men and their families a con
crete proof of the friendship of the
two localities.

to begin today. At St. Johns, Wash.,
80 men refused to work for 4 a day
in the harvest fields unless one Indus

Hunt Is Guest
at Wobbly Camp
COLUMBUS, N. M., August 20.
Former Governor G. W. P. Hunt of
Arizona, President Wilson's represent
ative in the Arizona strike situation,
arrived in Columbus this afternoon
for a conference with attorheys for the
deported men. The nature of the con
ference was not disclosed.
A mass meeting will be held Wed
nesday night and it was said Mr. Hunt
probably would address the meeting.
City officials have requested the ref
ugees to remain off the streets of Co
lumbus after six o'clock at night. The
executive committee of the deported
men addressed their followers at camp
to comply with this request.
ALLIES TO DISCUSS
POPE'S PEACE PLAN
WASHINGTON. Aug. 20. Lord Ce
cil's statement in the British parlia
ment today that the entente govern
ment would hold a conference before
replying to Pope Benedict's peace pro
posals, is understood at the state de
partment as meaning that the govern
ments will exchange views, not thai
there is to be a gathering ot premiers
or foreign ministers for a formal con
ference. So far there has been no occasion
for the state department to join in
any Of the several conferences which
have been held in the capitals of the
entente nations during the war. This
attitude is understood to have been
due to the conviction that so far these
conferences have had to do with strict
ly European Issues.
No such limitation applies to the
p'ope's peace proposals, of course, as
I these touch interests vital to the Unit
ed States. It is believed, however,
that the necessary measure of co-operation
between the nations at war
with Germany can be secured through
cabled exchanges and conferences De
tween the diplomatic representatives
and the foreign secretaries at the dif
ferent capitals.
It was said today that these ex
changes would begin very soon. Sti'ong
objection is made at present by offi
cials of the administration to at
tempts on the part ot the press to
forecast the nature ot the reply that
will be made by President Wilson.
But it is not denied that nothing has
been presented by the pope to warrant
the expectation that there will be any
change in the attitude taken by the
president in his previous utterances
on the subject ot peace and the con
ditions that must be met to secure It.

i ' MERICAN TRAINING CAM r J.N
I A FRANCE, Sunday, August 19.
J General Petain, commander in
cmei oi me r rciicu arnura, paiu
Ws first visit today to the American
troops in France and expressed him
self as delighted with what he saw.
"I am exceedingly pleased and grati
fied with what 1 have seen during this
inspection," he said. "Training has
progressed so well that I feel certain
theAmerican troops will form an ex
cellent fighting force in a very short
time."
The French general was accompan
ied by Major-General John J. Persh
ing, the American commander and both
left this afternoon tor the French front j
where they will remain several days.)
They had a very busy day, motoring
a hundred miles or more and inspect
ing almost every village in which
Americans are billeted. In addition
General Petain held a review of the
famous Chasseur division which ha
been training the Americans for the
last month.
Pershing Is Pleased.
Addressing the officer of this divis
ion. General Petain said they bad ren
dered a notable service both to France
and to America and that their battal
ions had become sister battalions to
the American contingent. The Ameri
cans, he added, had expressed the
"iiope that some day they would have
the privtlege of fighting alongside
their French instructors, and of prov
ing what apt pupils tbey can be.
Major General Pershing also was
much pleased with his inspection of
the American troops. He noted mater
ial improvements everywhere and
said:
"I am extremely well satisfied with
what I have seen today. A thing
which particularly strikes one about
'he Americans is the finest spirit
which prevails both among officers and
men. Training is progressing rapidly
and satisfactorily in every resepct."
Review Is Spectacular.
The review of the Chasseur division
was most spectacular. General Per
shing greatly admired the dash with
which it was carried out. The infan
trymen made a splendid showing but
the picturesque feature was the rush
ing by one of the divisional artillery
with horses at a fast trot, followed at
some distance by several troops of
cavalary at full gallop. Later three
of the Chasseur bands played the
Marseilles and the Star Spangled Ban
ner. Prior to the review. General Petain
bestowed numerous decorations on the
Chasseurs and also mingled with the
French peasants who bad gathered on
the review grounds. Patting one small
boy on the head. General Petain ask
ed to what military class he belonged.
"Nineteen twenty-three, my gener
al," the boy answered.
"Then you will have a long time to
wait," the general remarked laugh
ingly and the boy saluted gravely.
Hats Arouse Interest
General retains made a close inspec
tion of several American battalions
and seemed particularly interested in
the various items of their equipment
He stopped in front of several soldiers
and examined their kits in detail.
The broad-brimmed American cam
paign hats also claimed his attenlioi
He took one of these from a soldier's
head, weighed it in his hands and stud
ied it for several minutes and thea
carefully replaced and readjusted .t
on the American's bead, the soldier
standing at rigid attention the whole
while.
"This is very good, very good," said
the general, "it is especially fine f-t
such a sun as we have."
"And for rain, too." added General
j Pershing. "They are fine young men
' ot splendid physique, intelligent and
most satisfactory looking soldiers in

trines declared treason.
Governor Thomas E. Campbell, af
ter digesting the report of Attorney
General Wiley E. JOnes, on the Bisbee
situation, and also as a result of bis
own investigations in the Warren dis
trict, issued a statement on his find
ings. His conclusions were sent in the
form of letters, addressed to Sheriff
Harry C. Wheeler, County Attorney
John F. Ross and to Mayor Jacob
Erickson.
I. W. W.'ism is flayed by the gover
nor in his statement, and acknowledg
ment made that complaints, alleging
that relief was not being extended to
many needy families, were erroneous.
The letter follows:
The result of my personal investiga
tion, August 9th to 12th, and the evi
dence obtained by the attorney gen
eral under my direction and filed in
tnis department yesterday evening,
concerning events pr.Or to the strike
in the Warren district, called by toe
Metal Mine Workers' branch. Indus
trial Workers of the World, June 27,
and subsequent incidents. Including
the deportation of July 12 and others
of later date, is briefly summed up
herein, together with such findings of
fact, and directions to your future
guidance as I feel it my duty to dic
tate: 1. The method of presentation of de-
mauds to the several operating min
ing companies, and the calling of the
strike immediately thereafter without
resort to referendum on the part ot
those to be affected, was unfair.
2. Tactics used by the strikers, the
preaching ot impossible doctrines and
ridiculing national war policies, of in
timidation, interference, insult, as
sault and threats of violence to life
and property, brought about a reign of
lawlessness.- invading the constitution
al rights of the whole L'ody politic ot
the district.
3. It is asserted by the sheriff that,
because of the absence of state aid
and failure to obtain relief from fed
eral military: and due to tbe helpless
ness ot legal machinery to cope with
a dangerous situation involving pris
oners beyond jail capacity and desir
ing to effect the removal of a menace:
which in his judgment, could only re
sult in great loss of life, he proceeded
with the help of deputies and a Citi
zens' posse to arrest alleged members
of the I. W. W. and active sympath
izers and on the 12th of July forcibly
deported them to the number o( over
1200, into the state ot New Mexico,
and he accepts responsibility therefor.
4. Undoubtedly a number of persons
not members of the I. W. W. or atl
Iiated with their activities, were in
cluded in this deportation. Some of
those deported were forced to leave
dependent families, business interests
Or other property.
5. In the Warren district, since July
12, the constitutional rights ot citi
zens and others have been Ignored by
processes not provided by law; viz.,
by deputy sheriffs, who refused per
sons admittance into the district, and
the passing of judgment by a trib
unal witaout legal jurisdiction, result
ing in further deportations.
6. Repeated requests, in letters and
telegrams, fi'om this department to the
sheriff of Cochise county and the may
or of Bisbee, bespeaking safe conduct
of persons and committees, have met
with refusal.
7. The deportation of July 12 was
carried out with little violence, the
only eerlous incident having been the
killing Of an I. W. W. member who
fatally shot a deputy sheriff while re
sisting arrest. Prior to entraining, a
number of persons included in the ar
rest were invited to remain in the dis
trict. They refused and proceeded
with the others. Subsistence to the
value ot $1200 was distributed in the
cars which carried the men out ot the
state, but much of this was destroyed
by them in anger.
8. Relief for families of deported
persons has apparently been carried
out by the Warren District Relief as
sociation in a thorough and compre
nensive manner. No case was discov
ered in which need was not promptly

Last Rites Said Over Remains
Of Old Time Bisbeeite.
terred In Evergreen.
In-
With simple, impressive ceremonies
conducted by the Fraternal Order of
Eagles, of which deceased was a mem
ber, all that was mortal of Patrick J.
McCullough was laid to rest Sunday,
August 19, 1917, In Evergreen ceme
tery, Bisbee.
At the Eagles' hall. Mrs. E. E.
Slack, soprano, and Mrs. O. C. Rudig,
rendered the beautiful songs, "One
Fleeting Hour" and "Sometime,
Somewhere," closing with the song
prayer of "Nearer My God to Thee."
The services were conducted by
Richard Davis, president of the local
order.
Patrick J. McCullough was born fifty-one
years ago in Cookstown, Ireland,
He came to this country as a young
man and lived in New York City
where he was married to Catherine
McDermott twenty-five years ago. To
this union was born an only son, Pat
rick J. McCullough, who just arrived
Saturday to pay the last sad rites to
his father, arriving from Philadelphia
where he was taking a course In the
law school, and from where he was
recently called to his country's colors.
The deceased came to Bisbee seven
teen years ago and was engaged in
mining and business activities in. the
district while here. In 1906 he was
elected superintendent of streets of
Bisbee by an overwhelming majority
and was re-elected by a still greater
vote to the same position two years
later. It was under his administra
tion that the mud streets of Bisbee
gave place to brick, and-it was under
the city administrations of Dr. Caven
and George Neil, that "Pat", as he
was lovingly called, was "the man on
the job" in the construction of the
great walls of concrete in the canyons
and mountain sides, which turned the
narrow trails into roads, as great and
lasting monuments, in the building of
which he had a hand, as one need
v. Ish.
He was a conscientious worker, a
square dealing man, full of the milk
of human kindness and many a one's
day was made brighter by his cheerful
greeting. He "did his bit" in life as
he went along and in summing up of
those who had a hand In making Bis
bee a better and more home-like city
in which to live the name of Patrick
J. McCullough will be among the most
conspicuous.

pie. he declared, and they ride It as
hard and as persistently as they ride
the roads. He paid tribute to the
first dozen men of the district who
drove automobiles and how they start
ed the good roads movement in the
county that resulted in the thousands
of dollars being spent here to build
highways in the face of every diffi
culty. A. J. Elrod, the principle speaker ot
the evening, followed him. The Wash
ington disciple or good roads told
.how the people of the extreme north
west country had put the skids under
Sam Langster, the pioneer road, build
er of that section, because he built
a road that cost J1700 a mile. (Co
chise paid $17,000 a mile for some parts
of the road Over the Divide.) Later
Langster built the famous Columbia
river highway, the pride of the north
west now, and one of the great roads
of the world. " ":
Describes Trip
"This trip of ours is not a joy ride,"
declared Mr. Elrod. "It Is a hard trip.
Some days we drive from 7 in the
morning until 3 the next morning to
keep up with our schedule. Utah and
Idaho are wild for good roads. They
received us with splendid enthusiasm
all the way down through these
states. ; Every mile of our. route from
British Columbia down to the border.
"We . are not trying so much, to
preach good roads as we are to con
nect good roads in one unbiOken chain.
Every one is In favor of good roads
now-a-days.
"Bisbee can do anything she sets out
to do. .You have already demonstrated
that (laughter). And with your 150
million valuation you will one day
have as good roads as any county in
the country.
"Our proposed route extends from
British Columbia down thiough Wash
ington, Idaho and Utah, to Phoenix;
thence to Globe; thence to Tucson,
Tombstone, Bisbee, Douglas and El
Paso. We'll go on east and back up
north to New York by a selected lOute.
Gardner Speaks
"We nroDOse to organize the Ever
green Highway National association
by states.
"The rail lines that pass through
these western states were surveyed
when the country was undeveloped.
They never dreamed that such citiee
as Bisbee would be built out here.
They wanted the easiest grades and
the most direct routes. Our highway
seeks the most beautiful and pictures
que routes and the population centers.
"You Arizona folks ougnt to get ac
quainted with Utah, your northern
neighbor. You are strangers now. Our
highway will bind you together."
A. H. Gardner of Tombstone ex
pressed regret that the visitors had
been unable to stop there where a
dinner had been prepared for tbem.
But to show how much in earnest the
Tombstone folks are in their desire for
good roads he pointed to the delega
tion that had swallowed their disap
pointment and come down here :c
meet these Evergreen highway folks.
California Gets Tourists
Dick Ryan, county engineer, made a
stirring and forceful talk. He took
occasion to nay his respects to the
Warren District Commercial club. "II
this commercial organization decides
to back you In your project," he said
to tile visitors, "you can count on its.
support clear through to .the finish."
Captain Howe spoke at length on
the publicity features' and benefits
sure to accrue from such a highway.
He declared that tourists spend 00,-
000.000 annually in tuis western coun
try. $200,000,000 of which went to Cali
fornia. ' Washington? wanted Ijer

PEAL RESIDENTS
REPUDIATE FILING
OF RECALL PAPERS
Charge Petition was Signed by
Them Through Misunder
standing; Deportation by
Sheriff Wheeler Approved.
T. J. Leeson of McNeal telephoned
to the Review yesterday to protest
against the position in which his com
munity was placed by the alleged re
call petition from that place against
Sheriff Wneeler. "Most of our citi
zens who signed that paper," declar
ed Mr. Leeson, "did not understand
that it was intended to recall our
sheriff or they would not have signed
it. The recall provisions were placed
in the paper after it was signed by
a great many of our folks or they
would never have signed it. They
thought it was merely a protest
against the entire county paying the
expenses Of the deportation.
"I want to say that most of the
McNeal people 'favored tne deporta
tion of the I. W. W. We think the
sheriff did the right thing and we are
with Bisbee and Douglas in their ef
forts to keep clean of the class of peo
ple they drove away. We are hard
workers over here and are lOr the
workers every time. The Indunstrial
Workers won't work ,so we don't want
them In the county." ,
Bisbee is glad to hear of the real
state of the feelings of her neighbors
at McNeal. The alleged recall peti
tion sent out from there created much
surprise here as it was a direct slap
at good citizenship.
HAVE TO SHOW US .
The Douglas Dispatch of Sunday in
a lengthy article states that Oscar K.
Goll, secretary of the Douglas Cham
ber of Commerce had sent word back
to that city from Los Angeles that he
had been married and that "she is the
sweetest girl in the world," but failed
to give her name. Now Oscar- pull
ed off that same stunt some few years
ago when he made a trip to Benson
and stated that he was married to a
young lady from El Paso, but she de
nied it in the press and it was so. Now
we will have to see the young lady in
Douglas before we cau place much
faith in the report.

satisfied, and should such cases exist,
they are due to concealment Or stub -
bornness upon the part of the needy,
9. Fundamentally, the sentiment ex
isting amongst the mine operators and
the members of the Citizens' Protect
ive league and the Workmen's Loyalty
league has not been manifested
against regularly organized unions,
other than that Of the I. W. W. In
isolated cases Irresponsible members, ters of general and vital moment to the

members of trades unions, and some of
their members were included among
those deported, claims having been
made that a number Of members of
trades unions are also members of the
I. W. W. or in sympathy with them.
From the foregoing, 1 draw this fol
lowing conclusion:
Lawlessness upon the part of the
strikers prevailed in the Warren dis
trict Arrests should have been made
and trial given under proper legal jur
isdiction. The deportations of July 12th and
those subsequent thereto were illegal.
All deported persons are entitled to
the full legal rights secured to tnem
by the constitution and statutes ot
Arizona; "-and, unless by proper ap
plication and execuAon of the laws
thus afforded, must not be restrained
in the exercise of their liberties, as af-!
fecting not Only the Warren district
but any other place in this stale.
I concur in the opinion of President
Wilson in. a telegram to this dt-part-1
ment, in comment on the deportation !
of July 12:
"May I not respectfully urge the
great . danger of citizens taking the
law into their own hands. I look- upon
such action with grave appreciation.
A very serious responsibility is assum
ed when such precedents are set."
The committee of citizens acting
since July 12 as an examining board
upon the rights of persons to enter;
into and remain in the Warrun lis-,
trict is without legal status and uiusti
immediately cease. j
The duties of the sheriff are execu-1
live and the powers Ot niiiiseit and hi !
deputies must be so measured. All
persons arrested for infringements of
ihe law, or by warrunt. must be accord
ed a thorough investigation btfore a
legally constituted tribunal, to the end ,
that innocence or guilt be piOmptly es
tablished. The rights of sheriffs and ;
ieputies to search and detain must
be exercised with caution and judg-'
:hetu and with the least convenience
and exielise to the public.
Heucet'ortli I shall look to the olli
clals of Col li ifc and all Arizona Octin-,
ties for co-operation in the enforce-1
ment of the laws. It will be a dis
graceful blot on the history of this
atate if we, the responsible olticers.
are Obliged to admit that our proper,
functions, for the administration and
preservation of law and order have'
broken down and that the last resort,
martial law, must be invoked.
Labor unions responsible to central
ized authority and founded upon sane.
receive from you and me that consid-! honlei and lull of generous suggestioiis
economic principles, are rightfully a to enterprise and labor God has plac
part of our industrial system, and must upon,"r head .f won?er;
eration which is legally and morally ful Ught. and has laid at our feet
their right; in like regard do I hold
the law-abiding worker, who is not af
filiated with unions, believed that ev
er yone has the1 right of opinion and !
action, within legal bounds, without in
terference with or intimidation of per
sonal liberty, the mightiest pillar in
our sacred constitution.
But, the principles Of the Industrial
workers of the World are a stench in
the nostrils of decent Americans. InK
so far as my power, as governor or
Arizona, extends, I shall not tolerate
in the remotest degree their applica
tion in Arizona, a menace to civic well-'
being and industrial progress in time
of peace, the toleration of such doc
trines during a state Ot war, is treason.
In my inaugural address I express
ed the belief, in reference to the sub
ject of labor and capital:
"A due regard for the interests and
future prosperity of all the people and
a full development of our industrial
and natural resources demand the es
tablishment of correct principles in
our economic laws and a better un
derstanding between labor and capital.
This problem is charged with great
difficulties and is one which Is ot
highest importance to solve on lines of
common sense and a devotion to the
right. We are living today in an age
of federation and combination. Busi
ness men find that they must work
tnrough corporations, laboring men
that it necessary to work in federation,
and both have become factors of mod
ern industrial life. Both kinds of fed
eration, capitalistic and labor, can do
much good; likewise they can do much
evil. Each must refrain from arbitrary
or dictatorial interference with the
rights of others. Organized capital
and organized labor must know that in
the end they must be brought into
harmony with One another in the in
terest of the general public; and the
conduct of each must conform to the
fundamental rules of obedience to the
law of individual freedom, and of jus- j
tice and fair dealing to all. Every em-,
piOyer, every wage worker, must be
guaranteed his liberty and his right
to do as he likes with his property or ;
his labor so long as he does not in-
fringe upon the rights of others
"It Is of utmost importance that em- '
ployer and employe should endeavor to
appreciate each the viewpoint of the
other, and the ultimate disastrous re-1
suit if either constantly maintains an
attitude of hostility and distrust. Class
prejudice is more injurious and de-,
i structive to industrial and social wel
' fare than sectional, racial or religious
animosity. We can get good govern-,
j ment and enjoy piOsperity and con
j tentment only upon condition that we
I keep true to the principles upon which
j this nation was founded and judge 1
j each man upon his individual merits,
i and not as a part of a class. It should

tractive field for business investment

where law is the rule of conduct and
where courts, not mobs, execute its
mandates. So far as the constitutional

CLAIMS MISTAKE MADE
William Henry Darby of Lowell, was
a caller at the Review office yesterday
and stated that a mistake had been
made in listing his name as a slacker.
He states that he went to the "Y."
when the examining board was here
tm the 6th of August and was exam
ined and that he filed exemption pa
pers on the 8th on account of being
married. He has taken the matter up
with the local board. There is no doubt
but what a clerical error has been
made in his case.

OUR VISITORS.
We have the Evergreen Highway folks with us today.
Their coming should mark an epoch in the good roads
movement already commenced in Arizona. Of all earthly
needs good roads are one of the most important They
bring the producer and the consumer closer together.
These men from the British possessions in America have
come a long ways to spread the doctrine of good roads.
They are disciples of the Highway From' Sea to Sea. They
want a road that can be traveled in winter's cold as well
as in summer's gold.
And we are going to help them all we can. This pro
posed highway passes right through the heart of Cochise
county. It's cities are on the Evergreen Route. Thous
ands of tourists, most ol the men of means, will travel
this route every year. The logging of the Evergreen
Highway means a big boost for roads hi this county. We
have already spent thousands for good roads and have
realized their benefits enough to cheerfully and confi
dently spend thousands more. We have laid the foun
dations; it now remains to put the finishing touch to the
surface.
Welcome to the Evergreen travelers. "Evergreen;" 'tis
a good omen. It sounds for staunchness and dependabil
ity and faith all the year 'round. Such a highway will
soon become famous the country over. . The men who
are pushing it on to an accomplished fact deserve a high
measure of praise. Bisbee honored herself in honoring
them last night.
These city park meetings we are holding these days,
or rather, night, do they not warm the cockles of the
heart! When the people of the industrial communities
of a country get together In all friendliness and patriotism
and work for the common cause of all, it is a splendid
sign of the times. Patriotism was the keynote of Sun
day night's City Park meeting, and it should be the key
note of all acts and assemblages while this nation is at
war.
And now comes the Holland commission to these
shores to plead for the lifting of the embargo against that
thrifty little nation. Too thrifty by far. That Is the
trouble. German gold dazzled the stadtholders' eyes to
their own country welfare and the clink of German gold
deafened their ears to the call of their country for food
supplies. During all the three years of this bitter strug
gle, while British fighting Bhips braved the North sea
tern pes t8 and the mines and the submarines to maintain
the blockade against Prussia, good ships heavy laden from
American ports were unloading precious supplies by the
tons at Holland wharfs. And these thrifty Dutch burg
hers, who now come to threaten and to implore, shifted
these supplies by the ton and the wagon and carload over
the German border at a profit that they argued paid them
well to throttle their own nation. Now, when the pinch
comes, and the allies have determined to stop this flow
of supplies to the Prussian through alleged neutral na
tions, the howl of the Dutch merchant can be heard above
the wash of the sea and in spite of the obstacle of three
thousand miles of space.
"The mills of the gods grind slowly.
But they grind exceeding fine."
At last the government has acted in the matter of the
I. W. W. propaganda against industry in the Interest of
our Prussian enemies., Ringleaders of the proposed
strike -in the northwest were arrested by troops' under
military orders. Glorious news. Now that the govern
ment has decided to act this horde of bluffers and intlm
Idators will soon hunt cover. Their treason has overstep
ped all bounds of the most paUent and tolerant govern
ment upon earth.
TRAITORS ALL.
(New York World.)
In hia speech at the Union League Club Wednesday
night. Elihu Root said:
There are men walking the streets of this city
tonight who ought to be taken out at sunrise and
shot They are doing work for Germany under false
pretenses and are lying about it. If we are compe
tent for our liberty we will find them out and get
them. Every one of su can help by telling to the
authorities all we know and hear.
It is only a matter of time when we will get these
spies and traitors.
We can't be fooled or played with too long. There
are some newspapers printed in this city the editors
of which deserve conviction and execution for trea
son. Sooner or later they may get it.
These are solemn words that carry added weight, com
ing from so conservative s man as Mr. Root, but they are
undoubtedly true.
Treason masquerades through, the country in a dozen
different forms. Some of it is disguised as Sinn Fein
propaganda, some as Socialist, some as I. W. W., some as
pacifist; but all of it is essentially German. All of its
champions are doing the Kaiser' work. Their treason
able demonstrations are conducted in public meetings, in
newspapers, in circulars and in general campaign against
the war policies of the United States, without interference
in most cases from the police or the Federal authorities.
How long the American people, with their easy-going
tolerance, will allow these treasonable activities to con
tinue is conjectuaL Some day there will be a great disas
ter, due wholly or in part to traitors, and then we shall
suddenly see a different attitude on the part of the public.
Of all these scoundrels, perhaps the most infamous arc
those of foreign birth who came to the United States to
escape political and religious oppression. Their treach
ery to the republic is unspeakable and their crime defies
definition.

STEW PAN SOLDIERY.
(Los Angeles Times.)
There are so many aisles of adventure in ministering
to Mars that It has come to pass that the cook has become
the most valuable man of the company. Likewise he had
become one of the high-priced men of the tented field.
Uncle Sam is having more trouble in rounding up cooks
than in assembling other branches of service. He can get
colones and captains in carload lots, and even trenehmei
can be garnered in big bunches, but good soupbuilders arc
as scarce as red ears of corn.
In this ticklish situation he has assumed the task of
making cooks out of mere fighting men. If he can take a
husky warrior and convert him into a capable kitchen me
chanic he counts it a good day; for Uncle Sam Jias decreed
that his men shall be amply fed, and the first essential is
competence at the pot and kettle.
So complete cooking schools and massive ones at that
are being established at each of the army cantonments
and flocks of men are being persuaded to sit at the feet ot
competent chefs and instructors. The old days when com
pany cooks compiled their stews with a scoop shovel and a
wash boiler are over. Nowadays 'there is standardized
euipment, sanitary portable kitchens and a rational and
satisfying bill of fare. Really the men in charge must
know something of cooking to do justice to the bossy ma
terials they have.
To start the thing off right the government lias been
drawing upon the hotels and restaurants for some of their
ablest talent Star performers are taken right off the
range the steel range and are put to work showing un
derlings how to assemble a mess of goulash without using
the feeL These experts draw the salaries they did in their
former positions, ranging perhaps from $80 to $200 a
month. Fine fodder can be wrecked by poor cooking
and this is a waste that Uncle Sam intends to avoid.

Dr. N. O. Brenizer of Austin, Texas,
fataer of Lester Brenizer, has been
visiting the son the past week. Ho
left yesterday for an extended trip
west to cover more of Arizona. Th
doctor was here about three years ago
to visit his son. This was at the very
beginning of development of the val
ley, when his son's present orchard
and rancn was growing naUve me,
quile. The doctor feels justly elated
and proud 'of his son's efforts in build
ing up the place into a modern farm
and orchard, and says he can see a
great future for the valley and hopes
in a few years to bee this valley buik
up with hundreds of beautiful liomej
and small farms. Bowie Enterprise.

TIME TO GET READY.
The otner day a man telephoned to the draft selecticn
board for Marion county outside of Indianapolis and asked
whether it is necessary to have the wife's signature on au
affidavit for an exemption claim. He was told it is neces
sary if he is claiming exemption on the feround that his
wife is dependent on him.
"Won't anyone else do?" the inquirer asked. "My wife
says she won't sign it"
The board member told the man that the best thing
he can do under the circumstances is to "get ready to go."

In Sunday's issue of the Review was printed the life
story of Will Crooks, British workman and member of
Parliament, told by himself, and sent to the Review direct
from London as a special feature. It is a wonderful story
of achievement and of a character that could stand suc
cess. Every workman In the Warren District should cut
this story from tbe paper and read it over and over agaia
and keep it for hiB children to read.
A visiting newspaper man called at The Review office
today and cangratulated the editor on the Sunday issue.
"Your Sunday paper had everything in it that a good daily
ought to have except advertising." said the caller. "Wh?t
is the cause of the drouth of ads in such a big and finely
balanced paper?" Ah, there's the rub, as Minister
Shakespeare used to say. We do not know. We only
know that we try to get out the best paper possible every
day and an extra big and good issue on Sunday. If the
merchants do not take advantage of it it is our loss and
theirs, too. Bisbee is the busiest, most progressive snd
fastest growing city In the state, AND, according to our
caller of yesterday, "the poorest advertising city In the
state." And yet every business man from "Ham the
Huckster." on the Gulf of California to Isaacs'tein. the
New York merchant prince, that advertising is the life
blood ot business everywhere and all tlie time.

DESPONDENT WOMEN
Constantly recurring suffering gives
women "the blues." Comparatively
few women realize that despondency,
together with backache, headache,
and that "dragslng-down" feeling
indicates some derangement of the
feminine organs, for which Lydie E.
Pingham's Vegetable Compound Is a
remedy.
It Is said that this famous, old root
and herb remedy has been the means
of restoring more women to health and
consequent happiness than any other
remedy In the world.
Don't wait until your life Is wrecked
by neglect and suffering. Give the
Compound a trial. Adv.
