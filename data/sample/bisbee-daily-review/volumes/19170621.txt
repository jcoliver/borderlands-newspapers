work and no play makes Sailor Jack
a dull boy," is a truism that is being
kept in mind by the officers of the
American torpedoboat destroyers, who
are doing everything possible to en
courage athletics among the men.
The most pretentious program yet
planned for the American jackies is a
big field day at which there will be
running races, walking contests, base-
tall games and many other sports. It
will be held In an athletic park which
is In course of construction with
funds provided by generous American
business men in New York and Lon

sport possible. A great game was
played yesterday in honor of the ar
rival of the American newspaper cor
respondents. A large crowd of specta
tors was present, composed mostly of
sailors in blue and soldiers in khaki
The game was between picked teams
and all the players wore regulation
uniforms which had been brought
from the United States.

It was "strange to see the sailors
emerge from the ships' club like big
league players and stranger still, when
they marched through the streets, to
watch the villagers drop whatever they
were doing and stare with, amazement
at the players, as if their procession
was something akin to a circus parade.
The scene of the game was a beau
tiful green on the cliffs back of the
town. From the diamond could be
seen the American ships at anchor.
There was no grandstand, but the
American and British naval officers, as
well as many khaki uniformed ones
and the curious village throngs, found
the green grass a comfortable vant
age point from which to view the
game. A goodly sprinkling of girls
from the village was present. They

America For
Generous Help ,
Especial Tribute Is Paid By
Head of Belgian Mission To
Hoover For Manner In
Which He Conducted Work.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON. June 20. Baron
Moncheur, head of the Belgium war
mission, today expressed to the Ameri
can people through the Washington
correspondent's, Belgium's deep grati
tude for America's "generous outpour
ing of material assistance and sym
pathy." He paid an especial tribute
to Herbert C. Hoover for his Belgian
relief work.
"The purpose of our visit to this
country," said the Baron, "is to ex
press to your government and people
the heartfelt gratitude of Belgium for
the generous outpouring cf material
assistance and sympathy which have
cone so far to save my stricken
countrymen from the horrors of fam
ine and to maintain their unshaken
courage in this hour of trial.
"Our warm gratitude to you for this
help will never cool, but you are now
adding still more to our great debt.
Our people, saved from famine, still
groan under the yoke of a merciless
invader. Your entry into the war not
only brings to us the satisfaction of
finding in an old friend a new ally but
fires us with complete confidence in
an early and victorious issue of the
great struggle which has brought to
my country so much of misery and
suffering.'
"In voicing my country's gratitude
I am happy to be able to pay a tribute
of admiration and affection to Mr.
Hoover, under whose able and untiring
direction the great work of feeding
Belgium was carried on. We now re
joice for you that a man so eminently
fitted by ability and experience should
be at your service in handling the
great food problems that confront
you."

Southern Republic Should

Raphael Cepeda, of Senate.
MEXICO CITY, June 20. The cam
paign begun this n-torning by El Uni
versal advocating,the breaking of rela
tions by Mexico with Germany was
widely discussed today and the pro
German papers delivered a counter-attack.
The discussions, however,
brought forth the tact that many men
prominent in public affairs are con
vmcea or the advisability or such ac
tion.
General Raphael Cepeda, former
governor of the state tof Mexico and
the state of San Luis Potoai and novy
presiden tof the senate, said tonight:
"Mexico should have taken this step
long ago. She should have allied her
self definitely with the United States
in the. stand the Slates has taken
against Germany."
Rafael Zubaran, one of the powers
in the senate and former minister to
Germany, declared that Mexico's stand
sh'juld be one of absolute neutrality.
General Salvador Alvarado, governor
of Yucatan, whose conduct or affairs
in that state has made it one of the
most prosperous in the republic, has
announced himself as favoring a break
with Germany.
ON'DON, June 20. Arthur J. Balfour, secretary of state for foreign affairs
gave an accounting of his stewardship in connection -with .his mission to
the United States to the members of the house of commons today at a
luncheon arranged in his honor by the empire parliamentary association.
The guests were -members of parliament and cabinet ministers, with the
American Ambassador Walter Hines Page and a few colonial representatives
as the only outsiders.
Ex-Premier Herbert Asquith, presided, a token of the non-political char
acter of the affaid, with Mr. Balfour on bis right and Ambassador Page and
Premier Lloyd George on his left. The other members of the cabinet sat at a
central table. After a cordial welcome home voiced by Mr. Asquith, Mr. Bal
four said: v
"I undertook the headship of the American mission with some reluctance
and difference; I felt it so easy to do .harm, and perhaps not so easy to do good.
But looking back, I feel that no harm has been done and much good.
"The success of the mission was not due to the personal qualifications
of your representatives but to far deeper and more permanent causes, which
must give us all great cause for gratification. I say nothing of the hospitality
of the United States, which is proverbial. N need not dwell on the buondless
kindness shown us, w.'iich was so obviously full hearted. The American peo
ple would have given us the same hospitality under any circumstances.

Russians Ready to
Start Conferences
WASHINGTON, June 20. Russia's
diplomatic mission completed its offi
cial calls of courtesy today and cleared
the way for conferences with Ameri
can officials. The mission went
shortly after noon to the state de
partment, where a large number of em
ployes gathered to greet and applaud
the visitors. Special Ambassador
Bakbmetieff was escorted fj Secretary
Lansing's office and formally present
ed by the charge of the Russian em
bassy. Diplomatic Secretary Soukin
was presented to Counsellor Polk.
While Lieut Gen. Roop, military
member of the mission, was paying the
respects of the Russian army to Sec
retary Baker, Secretary Lansing es
corted Ambassador Bakbmetieff to the
White IPjuse and presented him to
President Wilson. The Russian diplo
mat expressed his pleasure at being in
Washington, and the president replied
briefly. Later the ambassador paid
bis respects to Vice President Mar
shall. Tomorrow they will dine at the
White House.
The foregoing figures of Brit
ish shipping losses as the result
of Germany's submarine warfare
show a larger number .of vessels
sunk than In any of the six pre
ceding weeks. Not since the seven
day period ending April 28 has a
greater number of ships been de
stroyed. During that week 51
vessels 38 over the and 13 under

iest dtals since the Teutonic sub
marine campaign was opened in
February last were registered in
the week ending April' 21, when
40 steamers of more than 1.600
tons and 15 vessels of the smaller
tonnage were sent to the bottom.

ALLIES OF
Administration Food Control Measure Is Vigorously Defend-1
ed; Republican Says Unless It Is Passed Nation Will Face
"Bread And Hunger Riots, And Worse;" Opposition To
Bill Is Lead By Senators Gore, Read, Vardaman ; Attack
On Hoover Answered By Califomian.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, June 20. Administration leaders in con
gress said tonight house sentiment was beginning to make
itself felt among opponents of the food control bill, and
predicted enactment of the measure within two .or three
weeks.
Debate continued in both branches today with the house
again sitting until late at night to close general debate with a
view to proceeding under the five minute speech rule tomor
row and taking a final vote by Saturday.
In the senate there was serious discussion with larger at
tendance. - The amending stage probably will be reached there
next week after the measure as it passes the house is substi
(uted for the senate draft.
Despite the continued opposition and certainty of some
amendments, ultimate enactment of the legislation in Some
form is expected even by its opponents. Senator Chamberlain
said tonight it was possible that the bill would be finally enact
ed by July 1 , as desired by the president, but few shared his
optimism, the general opinion expressed being for two weeks
at least of senate debate. '
Suggests That Government Sell All Wheat
Senator Kenyon, Republican, occu
pied most of the day in the senate in
support of the bill. He emphasized
the necessity for government conti'jl
of foodstuffs as a war measure; de
fended the bill's constitutionality, and
flayed speculators, whom he character
ized as "highwaymen and allies of the
kaiser."
"If this thing is going on the cor
nering of food and fuel," he said, "we
are going to have hunger and bread
riots in this country, or something
worse."
Senators Gore( Reed and Vardaman,
Democrats, continued as the principal
critics of the bill. They were joined
by Senator Borah, Republican, who
questioned the measure's constitution
ality and said it .was "full of glittering
crceralities," which would "bewilder
t'.ie business world and paralyze Initia-
:va of the country." He advocated,
. 'jwever, regulation of speculation and
;;overnii;ental purchasing of food sup
s. f
"Would Force Price Down."
Senator Gore insisted that the bill
v ould force the farmers price down,
;ay?ej faminine next year from under
production, and loss this year of f 750,
Gv,;.C?0 to producers.
Senator Keny'on said he believed
under the bill the president could take
over factories, such as printing houses.
"If we can conscript men's lives,"
replied Senator Kenyon, "surely we
r

can conscript workmen to feed those
men."
Senator Lewis asked if food prices
9 would not be affected if the president
. were to emiowered to seize Pood and
distribute it without delay.
Senator Kenyon said it would, add
ing that a similar law exists in Eng
i land but so far there never has been
j occasion to enforce it
I Senator King suggested that ' since
there will not be enough wheat to fill
requirements of the allies and demands
) of home consumption, except through
rigid economy, the I'nited States gov-1
i ernment could requisition all the
j wneat, apportion a part to the allies,
; and sell the rest to the people of this
country at cost.
.' Hoover Is Defended.'
In the house, Representative Meek-
I er, of Misi.'juri, Republican, assailed
j the bill and questioned the ability of .
jJMr. Hoover, the food administrator,
j while Representative Lenroot, of Wis-.
j consin, opposed the broad powers con-
ferred upon the president,
j Criticisms of Mr. Houver drew a
I speech in his defense from Represent

THE BOND HABIT.
The success of the Liberty Bond issue has been due in
a very large measure to the voluntary efforts of banks and
bond houses. These business institutions, the country
over, have performed this service to the nation without
any compensation, and at considerable cost to themselves.
They have as their reward the gratitude of the public,
the appreciation and good will of the government and.
still better, the consciousness of a patriotic duty nobly
performed. '
There is another, more practical side, however. Our
bankers and security-dealers in general will doubtless be
amply recompensed in time for their unselfish labors
And without seeking any way to belittle tbeir services,
it may be said that the recompense was probably in the
back of their minds when they undertook to sell this
great popular loan.
They have had an unprecedented opportunity to edu
cate the public in bond-buying, and they have made the
most of it.
The average citizen heretofore has never regarded him
self as a possible bond-holder. He has known little
about bonds, and what little he knew made him believe
that they were only for the rich. We have not been a
nation of bond-purchasers, as Uie French are, and as the
Germans and British are coming to be. Our general pub
lic has sought other lines of investment, particularly real
estate and industrial stocks. ' Bonds have usually been
taken up in big blocks by banks, insurance companies,'
and wealthy individuals. The ordinary man or woman
with a few hundred dollars lying around loose hasn't
thought of putting the money into government bonds,
state bonds, city bonds, public utility bonds or other sim
ilar gilt-edge security.
Now that is .changed. Millions of people are learning
what bonds are, how they are bought, and how desirable
they become in a time of business uncertainty. It will
be vastly easier hereafter to sell them all kinds of bonds.
Thus the banks and bond houses will profit. And the
people themselves will profit likewise for there Is no
finer thrift habit than the habit of bond investment.
"DRY" SPOTS FOR TRAINING CAMPS.
The advantage of prohibition for war purposes has
been recognized in the selection of training camps for
the new armies. Nearly all these camps have been locat
ed in "dry" states. There are exceptions, such as Louis
ville, Ky., and Chillicothe, O., places selected because of
strategic advantages. But other things being equal, the
"dry"' place seems to have been preferred in every in
stance. This moral favoritism was shown strikingly In the
selection of Des Moines, la., for the Nebraska-Iowa.Min-nesota
Dakota contingent. Fort Snelling, Minn., was the
first choice of the commander of the central army de
partment, but it had to surrender to Des Moines because
Minnesota is "wet" and Iowa is "dry." Fort Riley, Kan,
was chosen likewise by virtue of the arid pre-eminence
of Kansas over Missouri and Colorado. In Michigan,
"dry" Battle Creek won against "wet" Grand Rapids.
Nearly all the southern camps are in "dry" cities.
The men selecting the camp sites, it is explained, are
not prohibitionists. It is simply a cold-blooded proposl
tion of successful war-planning. The war department
says liquor and war won't mix.
GETTING ID OF HORSES.
We have exported, since the war started, 920,000
horses and 330,000 mules. The movement still continues.
And when our own troops go to France, they will take
hundreds of thousands of horses and mules with them.
But our economic authorities refuse to worry about the
depletion of our equine population. We still have about
22.000,000 horses, and they say that is far too many.
Some extremists go so far as to say that the country
would be better off if we get rid of horses altogether.
' Their reasoning is simple. Horses must be fed. At
a time when our human food supply is so precarious, that
is an important consideration. One horse requires the
produc t of five acres of land to feed him through the year.
It is estimated that our horse population consumes the
crop production of an area equal to Ohio, Indiana. Illinois
and Iowa combined.
We have, in normal years, about 40,000.000 acres de
voted to raising oats, which is mostly fed to horses.- and
60,000.000 acres devoted to wheat, which Is food for men.
If it were not for the horses' first claim on that 40,000,000
acres, there would be no wheat problem today.
It is argued, too, that the use of horses involves addi
tional waste through requiring the service of so many
men to take care of them. An automobile or motor truck
or tractor is more easily looked after. Every productive
use to which horses are put can be served by gas-engine
vehicles, ajid usually served better. The truck or tractor
will do far mare work than a team of horses. The farm,
the horse's last stronghold, is fast learning to do with
out him.
There's the advantage of a petroleum supply that isn'i
keeping pace with the Increase of motor vehicles and
machines. Gasoline Is rising. It may be very scarce
and expensive before long. But even so the experts
say, we can better afford to feed gas engines than horses.
-TEAM WORK ON FOOD-SAVING.
Five hundred New York restaurant men, representing
the restaurant business of the metropolis, met the other
evening to discuss ways and means qf, co-operating with
the government in conserving the nation's food supply.
They pledged themselves unreservedly to follow whatever
rules should be prescribed for them by Mr. Hoover, the
national food administrator, and to serve the government
to the limit of their intelligence and ability.
They have set a good example to (heir profession, and
one which restaurantenrs throughout the country will
doubtless follow.
The importance of their attitnde Is great They are
in a strategic position to wast or save enormous quanti
ties of foodstuffs. All the edible material they can save
legitimately is so much clear gain to the community, to
the country and to the world-cause for which we are fight
ing. It lies in their power, too, by wise methods of cook
ing and serving meals, to impress their patrons with the
desirability of exercising economy themselves in order
ing restaurant meals and in preparing meals at home
Every intelligent restaurant keeper may be an educative
power in his community.
The New York restaurant men have set a good example
too, to. the public by their acquiescence in government food
control. If they are so ready to submit their business to
the dictation or advice of government experts, how can
the ordinary citizen refuse to acquiesce likewise in this
household management?
The government hasn't really got on the job yet. Food
control has been held up pending the enactment of the
necessary legislation by congress. With that accomplish
ed, and the food administrator sure of his powers, every
man and women should be prepared to follow the depart
ment's suggestions cheerfully and unhesitatingly.
GERMAN FREE GOVERNMENT.
A war of democracy against autocracy, we call it, and
our German friends retort, "Ach Himmel! Has not Ger
many its universal manhood suffrage? Has not Germany
its senate (the bundesrath) and its house of represent
ives (the reichstag)? And what but a president of the
United States of Germany is the German emperor?"
Plausible, this. At first hearing, excellent Aber
Gernian universal suffrage is adroitly gerry mandered
by maintaining unmodified the electoral districts of
many years ago despite immense shifts of population.
And while Germans elect members of the reichstag by
secret ballot and have all the sensation of sovereign citi
zens, the reichstag is kept cwoed by the bundesrath, or
German senate. The bundesrath has not only a veto
power over the reichstag, but with the emperor's con
sent can dissolve it at will. This the reichstag knows.
It behaves accordingly. Says Price Collier: "Its leaders
moult opinions, they do not mold them, and could not
translate them into action if they did."
What, then, is the bundesrath, or German senate? A
body of statesmen elected by the people? Instead of that.
t is a corps of deputies appointed by the dukes, grand-
dukes, and kings of German states. It holds secret ses
sions, to be sure, yet each delegate must vote under
specific instructions from his ducal, grandducal, or royal
master. As King of Prussia,' W ilhelm II appoints a third
of the delegates. As German emperor he manages the
rest by managing their proprietors.
So It comes to this. In our sense, there Is no effective
national suffrage in Germany. In our sense there is no
house of representatives in Germany. In our sense, there
is not senate in Germany. Not in any sense is there a
German cabinet There is only the chancellor. Ap
pointed by Wilhelm, he is responsible to Wilhelm alone.
Then to whom is Wilhelm responsible? He has said:
"There is only one master of the nation. That is I. I
will abide no other." And again. "I look upon the people
and the nation as a responsibility conferred upon me by
God. Those who try to interfere with my task I shall
crush." There you have It Divine right of Wilhelm.
Myself und Golf"
Fine democracy! The Germans are right in telling i'
that the German emperor has less power than the Amer
ican president But meanwhile there is the enormously
powerful King of Prussia. The two are one. That one
(responsible to high heaven alone) controls Uie so-called
senate which In turn controls the German house of so-cau-
sd rperesentatives.
Now, if the people of Germany relish that style cf
government, they are welcome to it But when that style
rtt government seeks to oust democracy and rule, the
world, democracy will fight to the last ditch. Although
we see. defects in democracy, we hold that democracy Us
In principle right. Although we see brilliant superticial
merits in certain results of autocracy, we hold that au-
tocracy is in principle wrong.
Just as Lincoln enunciated more than fifty years ago.
This nation cannot endure half slave and half free." so
with the growth of the world we see that the world can
not endure half slave and half free. We are warring to
make It free. Chicago Tribune.

GAMP FOR ARIZONA
Applicants Will Be Required
To Send Their Applications
To Whipple Barracks And
They Must Be In Before
July 15th.
GOING INTO PARTNERSHIP WITH UNCLu swdrt
By BRINK ERHOFF.
Information with regard to the com
ing training camp for officers in Ari
zona, has been received. Summarized
this information is as follows:
Men who have applied for the first
series of camps must re-apply whether
or not certified as suitable for the
firsl camps. They will have no pref
erence in selecUon for these camps,
and will be on an equal basis with oth
er applicants. The minimum age
limit is 20 years and 9 months, but in
order to obtain the experienced class
of men desired, preference will be
given to men over 31 years of age, oth
er things being equal. Because 'of the
anticipated large number of applica
tions, it will be probably difficult for
men under that age to qualify except
in instances where the applicant has
pre-eminent qualifications or unusual
military experience.
Applicants must file application on
blank to be obtained from command
ing generals of the departments in
which they reside. Those who are
certified as acceptable for the present
series of camps, but woo are not ai
rected t'j attend, must renew their
aopllactions, and department com
manders have been directed to return
papers filed with previous applica
tions to such applicants.
The entire federal service is expect
ed to be in the federal service before
these training camps open . If the ap
plicant's organization is not in federal
service at the time he applies, a signed
statement from the adjutant general
of the state must be enclosed recom
mending him as suitable as an officer
and agreeing to discharge him or fur
lough him for three months beginning
August 27, 1917, if he is not in federal
service on that date.
Employes of the United States must
enclose the 'signed recommendation
and consent of their chiefs.
The quota allotted to Arizona in the
second series of training camps is 40,
and .applicants will mail their applica
tions to the examining officer, second
training camp .Whipple Barracks,
Presc'jtt Arizona. At the close of the
camps men will be classified and rec
ommended for commissions on the ba
sis of their "qualifications as demon
strated during training. The govern
ment will pay the men in training $100
per month during the three months
course, besides providing transporta
tion, uniforms and subsistence, except
that reserve officers in training will
receive the pay of their grades and
will provide uniforms and subsistence
at their town expense.
Blanks for application were ready
June 15.
It is requested that applicants note
particularly that letters of recommen
dation are not wanted, but only the
names of. three responsible citizens
who know the applicant best Each
applicant must be examined physically
at his own expense by a reputable phy
sician, who will fill out the physical
report forming a part of the official
application blank. This preliminary
examination is subject to review and
the examining officer may require an
other examination. Men who submit
ted physical examinations on the army
blank for the first series of camps may
submit these reports in lieu or a new
examination.
Applications will be received be
tween June 15 and July 15. 1917, and
under no circumstances' Will an appli
cation be considered if received after
July 15. It will ue returned to the applicant.

scenes taken on French and Italian
battlefields are full of . action from
start to finish, the photographer in
many cases taking remarkable chances
to secure his film, braving almost cer
tain death in order to bring back to
America actual fighting scenes.
In addition to this film, the latest
chapter Vf the Bushman-Bayne serial,
"The Great Secret," and a Fatty Ar
buckle comedy will also be shown,
making the bill one of the strongest
shown at the Central in a long time.

Wicked Weapons of Modern
Warfare Now Adjusted So
As To Be Used For Direct
And Indirect Fire On Enemy.
(By Review Leased Wire).
BEHIND THE LINES IN FRANCE,
June 8. Use of the machine gun as
a wrap'jn for offensive operations ana
for indirect fire by elevating the guns,
so that the bullets will fall into the
trenches- of tne enemy, is one of the
recent developments of warfare.
This change in the method of using
the machine gun has been brought
about within a year. It shows, say the
British officers, the rapidity with
whica methods of fighting are being
altered' and that if capable officers
were to be sent to the front fi'jm
America the systems they learned
might be out of date before the troops
they were to teac'a arrived in France. .
Less than a year ago the machine gun
was regarded primarily as a weapon of
direct fire, that is, for mowing down
an advancing enemy. It was thus
chiefly a defensive method and its
usefulness was limited to the rather
rare periods when the enemy was ac
tually attempting to attack.
Methods Changed.
But t'oday the machine gun, though J
retaining its importance in this re
spect, has become still more a weapon
of indirect fire, and by far the greater
proportion of machine gun casualties
nowadays are caused through this use
of the weapon. In one highly valued
! type 'of so-called indirect fire, a ma
! chine gun is trained by day on a
stretch of road or communications
! which the enemy is using at night for
bringing up supplies snd reinforce
ments. .
The machine gun tripod carefully is
adjusted to command this road and
Etakes are placed so that the bullets
can be sprayed over the road. Then,
at night, although the road is invisible,
the maefhine gun is turned on at in
tervals of perhaps an hour, sweeping
the road clear of any enemy supply
columns that may te there .and in ef
fect making the use 'of that road im
possible at night.
Training Is Severe.
As in the case of the machine gun,
evolution is constantly in progress in
the use of the bayonet, in bombing, in
trenching, in sapping and in counter
attack. Nowhere, say army officers,
can the latest developments of each of
these specialties be taught so well as
in the training camps just behind the
trenches where specialists direct from
yesterday's fighting are at hand to in
struct the novice.
Another valuable feature jf the
training camp at the front is that there
recruits are brought rapidly, almost
unwittingly, into the atmosphere of
modern warfare, so that when a man
is finally drafted into a front unit he
finds nothing particularly strange to
him. No matter how well American
troops may be trained in the United
States they would find the melee of
actual battle psychologically very try
ing. And war experts no longer laugh
at psychology. "The training of the
mind for surprises and novelties of the
battlefield is an important step in the
psychological side of training," say
the authorities.

El Tigre Mine Is
Closed. By Strike
(By Review Leased Wire)
DOUGLAS, June 20. Because there
appeared to be no prospect' of set
tling the strike which had been in
progress 10 days at the EI Tigre mine,
65 miles southeast 'jf Douglas, all
American employes of tue company
were ordered this side of the interna
tional boundary, according to employes
who reached here today. The depart
ment heads were supposed to leave
the mine late today, being the last
Americans to depart, they said. Sev
eral women were among those arriv
ing iVday. There has been no disor
der because of divided feeling among
the 500 strikers. ' While all miners
went on strike only about half the
employes belonged to the union, and
they acted as a restraint on the more

NEW YORK. June 20. Withdrawal
of public participation, and advance in
call money to 6 per cent, the high
rate of tbe year, fresh complications
in the foreign situation and unfavor
able weather over "western and soutb
wes'ern agricultural centers accounted
In varying degrees for today's further
impairment of quoted values.
The higher money rates extended to
time loans and one-day discounts by
the local federal reserve bank, which
were raised from 2 to 3 per cent.
Declines were again most severe in
speculative Issues, but embarrassed
11 divisions of the list. Including rails.
Prices were distinctly flrra at the op
ening, but heaviness soon developed
on persistent offerings of teels, cop-'
pers, 'oils, sugars and numerous un-(
classified stocks. j
United States Steel declined from
128, its best quotation of the morn
ing, to three points under that level.
In the final hour United States Steel
led the active list in a general recov
ery of 1 to 4 points. Total sales
290.000 shares.
Receipt of another $11,000,000 in'
British gold, hardening of lires and.
rubles and a slight shading of francs
were the features of the foreign ex-'
chenge market. J
- Bonds were heavy, total sale, par

' CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO. June . 20. Reports that
President Wilscn was likely to exer-j
rise bis power to place an embargo on
grain shipments that' might reach
Germanv through neutral countries
led to heavy liquidation sales today,
. especially In corn. Prices for that
cereal closed nervous,' 1 to 4 cents
'owen. Wheat also declined, finishing
1 to 4 down with July at 201 and Sep
tember at ISO. Oats lost to 1.,
Provisions gained 2 to 15. j
General unloading by holders of
corn accompanied the talk of a prob
able sudden enforcement of embargo
reeulations. It was said that recent
unupually large purchases of corn for
European neutrals had arounsed sus
picion and that the new authority of
the president could provide an effec
tive bar to any of the pronosed ship

crop offers Increased rapidly, but buy-'
ers were scarce except at relatively
low fibres. Crop prospects continu-.
ed to improve. Rains in the spring'
wheat region were deemed of partic
ular advantage to the bear side of the .
market. . I
Oats were cheifly governed by the
same influences that ruled other

Assertions that the Belgian com

Well As Delay.
There will be no more special ve
nires drawn In the Superior court at
Tombstone on account of the new law
that went into effect on June 8th,
which provides that when a panel of
veniremen is exhausted, it must be
filled by the drawing of the names of
regular veniremen from tne jury Dor.
Heretofore.! whenever a jury panel
has been exhausted before a full jury
was secured for any trial, it has been
the custom of the sheriff, on ' order
from the. court, to gt out and summon
a specified number of men available
for jury duty, as a special venire.
Tbe new law prohibits this practice,
and provides that all jurymen serving
in any Superior court in the state must
be regularly drawn. It thus takes the
power of selecting Jurors out of the
hands of any one man, and provides
for the drawing of special venires un
der the same system as regular ve
nires. The regular jury roll M all the
names of the male citizens on the reg
ister is made up at the beginning of
each year, these Jurors to serve for
one year. Under the new law, when
ever a regular pane? . Is exhausted,
names of regularveniremen subject to
jury duty will be drawn from this roll
to constitute the special venire. , Tbe
sheriff must then summon only th ose
men, instead of any eligible juror he
might encounter, as heretofore.
A hardship in the new law is pointed
out In that the regular veniremen are
drawn from all parts of the county.
Thus. It is possible that a regular ve
nire being exhausted during the prog
ress of & trial, names of special ve
niremen may all be drawn from distant
parts of the county, entailing a tedious
delay to the trial.
It is estimated that the new law will
cost Cochise county about $10,000 ex
tra a year $5,000 of It in mileage as a
charge against the Superior court of
the jurors and the extra expense to
the sheriffs office of the balance.
PEACEFUL SETTLEMENT
OF CHINESE TROUBLES
IS EXPECTED SHORTLY
WASHINGTON, June 20. Peaceful
settlement of China's internal troubles
was forecast in an official dispatch to
the Chinese embassy fi'jm Peking.
The message, dated today, said that
the two southern provinces of Yunnan
and Kwantung, which formed the
backbone of the southern secessionist
movement had notified the central
government that they favor co-operation
toward a peaceful settlement and
are ready to do everything possible' to
clear up the situation. Several other
provinces are said to be about to take
similar action. .
President LI Yuan Hung, who com
plied with the revolting military gov
ernors' demand for a dissolution of
parliament has issued another decree
calling for a new election. The old
parliament, elected in 1913, was held
to be unrepresentative. Tbe new
body, which cannot be convoked with
in a period of several months owing
to the complicated electoral machin
ery, is expected to be more closely in
touch with public opinion.
