tinue highly nervous all along the
lront. the slightest increase in the
British fire calling for the distress
signals. The German infantry are
getting better artillery support since
the battle of Arras, as a result of the
bitterly worded reports made regard
ing the lack of this support -previously.
Prisoners taken in the last three
days tell of the spread of discontent
in the German army because of re
duced rations since April 15. Each
man formerly received a half a loaf
of bread daily. Now he has only one
thirj of a loaf. This reduction com-'
ing after the Somme retreat, the de
feat at Arras, and the beginning of
the great French offensive has caused
much grun.bling among the troops.
p.ikI Republicans, insisted that during
war private rights must yield to ne
cessities of national defense.
Just at adjournment tonight the
senate adopted a committee amend
ment to the censorship clause prohib

the amendment was offered, however,
remains to be voted upon.

should arise as a result or indiscrim

of the trading public to these mis
guided congregations cr economy,
savings are being withdrawn from
the banks, reports show some peo
ple have begun to hoard food sup
plies, and thousands of workers
are being thrown needlessly out of
employment. All this is wrong.
Prosperity Vital Now
We need prosperity in war time
even more than when wc are at peace.
Business depressions are always bad
but doubly s"j when we have a fight
on our hands. The declaration of war
can have 1:0 real e-. il effect on busi
ness. What bad effects, are apparent
are purely phychologie and largely ol
our own foolish making. For our
markets are the same in April that
they were in March. We need more
business, not less. There is real dan
ger of hysteria. Indiscriminate econ
omy will be ruinous. Now is the time
to open the throttle.
"Every day the advisory commission
of the council of national defense re
ceives offers ol service from business
linns and individuals with requests
for immediate information as to how
this service may best be rendered.
This spirit is a most encouraging trib
ute I'j American patriotism. But we
must remember that in the great
struggle in which we have now be
come a part there is much to consider
besides munitions, troops cud battle
; ships. ' (
:i this country ff vast resources
,we already have a tremendous equip
ment for munitions making, built up
on foreign orders and now immediately
1 available through expiration of these
'.inlets. Kxcept in limited cases there
is little need for the development of
new sounes of supply. The dictates
' of common business sense require Lie
utilization, as far as possible, of exist
ing machinery. .
Our Three Tasks
1 "It seems, then-lore. thai, a plain
.statement of gen.-ral policy is most
: desirable.
1 "Upon the industrial side of the
' war three great tasks confront us;
"First and foremost, we muft
facilitate the flow of raw mater

"Second, w- must meet our
great military and naval building
schedules.
Third, we must plan to do all
this with the least possible dis

BORDER PATRIOTISM A CASE IN POINT.
ir there is any single section or retrion In the en
tire United States vhich should respond quickly ti
t'e President's call for men--soldiers it is the bor
der states and particularly the country immediately
joining the Mexican boundary line. The people in
this region have seen what a minature war means
and have been threatened with possible invasion
on any number of instances.. Yet the border country
people appear to thing that it is the duty of the
people from Michigari, Illinois, Pennsylvania. Maine
and Oregon to come here and protect them. To us
this spirit is either one of cowardice or unpatriotism.
El Paso is the largest city on the Mexican border.
El Paso claims to have a population of at least 75,
000. Strategically, commercially and in every other
way it is the most important port of entry into Mex
ico. It has been threatened with invasion on more
than one occasion. Bullets from warring factions in
Mexico have killed men and women in El Paso.
And in spite of this. El Paso, a town of 75,000, ir
unable to recruit one single company of infantry up
to peace strength.
Company K is the single contribution of El Paso
to the military strength of the United States. Accord
ing to a newspaper story, in one of the El Paso pa
pers, the United States mustering officer went to the
camp of the company and found that, eliminating
those who could get out of service, the company was
at half peace strength. The chamber of commerce
of El Paso was appealed to and offered the service
of its secretary, if the recruiting work did conflict
with the other duties of the officer of the chamber.
It is. certainly a pretty state of affairs when El
Fa so, one of the few towns in the entire country
which has suffered at the hands of possible enemies,
refuse to maintain even one company of infantry up
to half ceace strength.
We presume that El Paso and its people are too
busy making money off the real soldiers who have
been sent there from other points in the country
to think about doing something for their own pro
tection. Of all the communities in the country El
Paso lias profited to a greater extent by the presence
of troops on the border. Clerks, brokers, mechanics,
lawyers and men from every other walk of life, have
surrendered their chances and come to the bordar.
They have camped in .El Paso to protect El Paso and
its people; while EI Paso and its people have waxed
fat and prosperous on the regulars and militia and
have lost sight of the original object protection from
Mexican raiders and bandits.
Can the prospective soldier in New York, in Min
nesota, in Kansas; Utah or Alabama, be blamed for
a lack of enthusiasm when it comes to a matter of
joining the colors? Can any. man be blamed when
such communities' as El Paso will not even take a
step toward protecting themselves? And. further
more, does not these same questions effect, in lesser
degree, of course, every border town in Arizona?
Arizona is the pride of its people and is proud of
its fighting blood. Its one regiment of infantry is
about one fourth complete. Recruiting is bringing
very few men into its ranks. The average man re
fuses to move.
What is the answer?
Selective draft!
This method will take all men, regardless of their
position In life, and from them it will select an army.
It will eliminate the mistakes which have always
characterized the volunteer system where ever it
has been tried. By this system we will have an
army instead of a civilian mob of uncivil men who
are making an effort to get into condition to defend
their Country. '
The man who is no coward has nothing to' fear
from the selective draft. His duty is to his country.
He may pot desire to see service for the nation but.
barring cowardice, there are few men who will nave
any legitimate reason to offer against the draft. It is
the only efficient way of raising an army which will
be able to cope with the situation which it may be
called upon to face.
With the example of Li Paso and of oilier border
eoinniuuitics staring us in the face it bhould not ta
bard for the people of the Soutliwe.it to decide which
ii V.'tt ur t!yj country mi tvr us.

her reliance upon laissex faire, like our own, blocked
effective organization. It was battered down. England
has transformed her organization. She has mastered
her tremendous forces, and made a new machinery which
directs them effectively toward the accomplishment of
her purpose.
Not only has England now an army trained to tho
highest point of modern efficiency, equipped with every
device of warfare, and always fully supplied, but she has
all her economic functions directed and controlled so
that they serve the whole nation, the navy, the army,
and the people at home.
We have assumed a tremendous responsibility bot.'i
for our present and our future. We have leaped into the
center of the world conflict at a critical moment, and
we have leaped unprepared. We have, therefore, a titan
ic problem to make ourselves fit in the shortest possible
time. We cannot afford to blunder. We cannot afford
to Ignore the lessons taught by agonizing experience to
the peoples at war. We must learn from them, and espe
cially from England, how to create a modern army and
how to organize control of our economic forces so that
our strength may be applied to winning the war ana
our domestic conditions may be kept healthy and vigorous.
We are to have conferences with the allies' statesmen.
They should help us to create an efficient organization of
all the .nation's powers. American initiative and energy,
we believe, will do wonders with the aid of the lessons
of war experience. There is a class of men in congre?1?
who apparently learn nothing. Their mental caliber is
too small to allow the great , lessons of contemporary
events to register. But the president, the abler men in
congress and especially the leading men in the gTeKt
American activities can control the conduct of this war
and they will seek and find a great deal of help froir
England's experience.
Let us take Lloyd George's friendly hint. Let us try
not. to begin at the beginniug, but to begin at least not
far from where England is now.

'Tis a sad story, mates, and the !
cause of the sadness is none other j
than Section 4S40, Chanter 3, Revised j
Statutes of Arizona (Civil Code).
According to the opinion of City '
Attorney L. B. Whitney, after a close !
study of the statutes the city council
has no power to increase the salaries j
of the city marshal or city policemen, j
The council, at a special meeting sev-1
eral days ago, voted to increase the i
salary of the city marshal to $200 a
month, and the salary of the police
officers to $150 a month during the
rresent critical international situa
tion. Attorney VVhittey looked up
the law on the matter am yesterday
stated that, in his interpretation of
the civil code, the council could not
increase the salaries of any city of
ficials until the budget for the coming
fiscal year was made out. He stated
that the budget of any department
rould not be exceeded and that salar-
iofi tRinatnd in thp hudeefs would
have to be adhered to until the next
budget was made out.

it would lie suicidal politically to

The caucus agreement was reported
only after a bitter fight oer prohibi

SOUTHERN PRISONS
GIVE AUTHOR THEME
Blanche Sweet Appears To-.
day At Urpheum 1 heatre In
Laskf Feature "Unpro
tected' Blanche Sweet, the l-asky star, will
be seen at the Urpheum theatre today
in "Unprotected," a thrilling drama
of the southern prison camps, written
especially for her by James Hatton.
There is no other artist on the pho
todramatic screen wno has the versa
tility and is able to run the gamut of
characters as ably as does Miss Sweet
She has. in her excellent manner, de
picted characters of all nationalities
and in all walks of life, She has been
seen as a child of the slums and as a
princess, as a Swedish maid-of-all-work
in a collepe boarding house and
as a Montenegrin peasant. In Un
protected she portrays the most
striking and unusual character of her
entire career that of a beautiful
young artist, leased, with other con
vict laborers and sentenced t work
in a turpentine camp.
As an orphan girl she goes to live
with her irascible uncle who refuses
to permit her to indulge in her artis
tic inclinations. An accident befalls
the old man in which he is killed and
she is sentenced to ten years in pri
son, and leased out to a private firm
to work with the rift-raff of the stale
in one of the huge turpentine camps.
How, as a young artist, she meets
the son of the Governor how he falls
in love with her and altho she is con
victed under a different name, finds
her just as she it about to fall Into
the clutches of the owner of the camp
how the convicts rebel against the
treatment and how they are finally
saved from worse than death by her
pleas for them to the Governor, makes
a story absolutely unique in motion
picture annals.
Miss Sweet'is surrounded by an all
Ptar cast headed by Theodore Roberts.
Others in the cast are Tom Korman.

FLORENCE LA BADIE
. IS CAMERA WOMAN
Thanhouser Star, Who Ap
pears Today At The Eagle,
Knows Much About The
Camera.
Florence I.'alJadie of the Thanhous
er studios is a star who does not want
to direct. Neither does she yearn to
write her own script, but she would
love to be a "camera woman."
There never has been such an indi
vidual, of course, which is perhaps
why the ambitions of beautiful Miss
LaBadie tend that way. The fact re
mains, however, that the young star
has taken up the study of the camera
and finds it most fascinating.
"When I first went into motion pic
tures." Miss LaBadie says. "I knew
no more about the camera than I do
about constructing an aeroplane. One
of the saddest moments in my life
came shortly after I joined the Than
houser company. The director told
me savagely that I had caused a liga
tion, and it nearly broke my heart.
Attempts to apologize were awkward,
because I did not have the slightest
idea of the nature of my crime. Now
I know why scenes are taken in cer
tain lights, what colors in costumes
to avoid and the ones that will be ef
fective. It is a great help in my
work."
Many of the effects in "Her Life
and His," in which she is to be starr
ed at the Eagle theatre today, are the
result of her practical knowledge.
PERSHING IN MEXICO

first time since the Spanish-American

of the hardships of the soldiers in go

CREDIT FOR BRITISH FARMER
LONDON. April ...A wide exten
sion of the credit facilities at the dis-
i posal of tlie British farmer is part of
I the British government's scheme for
j encouraging home-grown crops. The
t'jard of agriculture has made arrange
i ments with the principal country
bankers to make advances to farmers
recommended by the official commu
tes at 5 per cent per year for a period
not exceeding nine months, to enable
farmers to obtain seeds, fertilizers and
implements.
The banks will not actually lend the
farmer cash, but will endorse the in
voices of the goods ordered by the ap
plicants, the transaction being practi
cally in the form of a promissory note.
The plan is expected to pave the
way to the establishment of national
agricultural banks, through which the
reputable farmer can at any time fi

MEXICO BEATS U. S.
EMBARGO BY GETTING
ARMS VIA EUROPE
MADRID, April 10. With an em
bargo on the shipment of arms and
ammunition from the United States to
Mexico, an ingenious plan recently has
been brought to light i'jr the shipment ,
of such munitions of war from the
United States to Europe, and their
trans-shipment from Europe to Mex
ico. By this roundabout route the
arms could get to Mexico without
crossing the United States-Mexican
L'jrder, where they would have been
detained by American customs offi
cers. The plan has required a system of
agents acting in Mexico, the United
States and .England and Spaing the
route designed -for -the shipments' be
ing from the United States to Eng
land, from England to Spain', andtrom
Spain," by one of the steamer lines
operating to Central and South Amer:.;
ican ports, to one of the Atlantic p'jrts
of Mexico. Whether any shipments
via England and Spain actually got.,
through is not known, as the plan was
disclosed and checked v. hen the' Lon
don link in the roundabout chain got
into difficulties over the nse of code
messages dealing with the shipments.
In the Course of the inquiry, tae
attention of the British military cen
sors was attracted to several cable
grams from Mexican officials. These
did not appear on their face to deal
with orders for arms words being used
to take the place of arms and cmn;u-

nitions. While the exact words o
the code are not known, tne messages
fi'jm Mexico ran something like this:
"Send 200 cases apples and 5000
rounds potatoes."
When the receiver of the dispatches
was interrogated by the authorities,
he stated the snipments referred to
arms, intended to be brought from the
United States to England, then shipped
to Spain." and thence to Mexico. The
transaction was stopped as involving
an irregular use of code messasrs.
The question Vif the shipment of anus
did not arise, as shipments to Mexico
did not at the time appear to have any
bearing on the European war. Inci
dentally, however, it disclosed the
roundabout route from the United

how far the lOute had been put to u?f.

ed the probable total damage in the

The complete devastation between the

Use a paint good enough to give you this
assurance. It is true economy. All the time
and care you devote to the interior of your
home are pretty nearly wasted if the first
impression visitors receive is a shabby coat
of paint outside.
SWP
is a paint specially made for the exterior of houses. It
looks better and lasts longer than other paints. Properly
applied, S W P will give you a handsome, weather-tight
coat of paint that will go for years without a sign of crack,
peel or blister. If you make sure that you get S W P on
your house it will be a long time before you will have
the bother and expense of painting again.
