American Mine Men Request
Special Trains To Remove
Families From the State
Villa In Person At Head Of
Large Forces Near Torreon ;
; Chihuahua City Must Fall
j WASHINGTON, May 23. Re
. cent official advices from various
mparts of Mexico indicate the sit
uation in the northern part of that
country due to Villa operat'ons is
more serious than hitherto had
been reported. It was learned to
day that Villa and his rebel band
is threatening part of Durngo, as
well as Chihuahua to the north.
American mining men have asked
for special trains to be ready to re
move them and their families from the
danger zone when Villa approaches.
Officials asserted, "however, that as
yet no Americans had been' molested
and that Villa himself, had treated all
Americans with consideration. Some
American property, however, has been
taken by the Villistas when they need
ed food .material and funds.
The capture and sacking of Parral
by Vttlfstas has been confirmed in de
tail by reports, received within the)
last three days. A number of other
important places have been taken by
the rebels and In each instance the
federal garrison went over to the Vil
listaa with little opposition.
The situation in Chihuahua City is
said to be grave. Villa forces threaten
to take the city soon, according to the
advices and will have little difficulty
in doing so.
Villa himself, it was learned through
authoritative advices today, is now at
the head of a large forct at Gomez
Palacio, only six miles from Torreon.

UTTER FIGHT
IS PRESAGED
Hiram Johnson Opens' Attack
Upon Floor of the Senate;
Protracted Debate Expected
Full Text of Treaty Demand
ed By G. O. P. .Leaders;
Say Huns Already Have It
WASHINGTON, May 23 The peace
treaty with its league of nations cove
nant was debated for three hours in
the senate today and' at adjournment
the resolution which furnished the
vehicle for the discussion went over
as unfinished business to come up
again when the senate re-convenes
Monday.
: The resolution merely calls on the
state department to furnish the sen
ate with the complete text of ' the
treaty, but as the debate progressed,
discussion shifted to the merits of the
league and treaty themselves. A
dozen' senators including the leaders
on both sides, were drawn' into the
discussion and sharp exchanges pre
saged the bitterifess of the fight that
is to come wheh Cte treaty actual:?
comes up for Yatif icatlon.
; Opponents of the treaty in its pres
ent form lined up generally for the
resolution and those supporting the
treaty draft led the' -opposition. There
was no attempt to reach a vote, how
ever, and some senators predicted it
would be several days before the pre
liminary skirmish would come to a de
cision. The leaders both for and
againBt apparently are feeling their
way carefully.
: Cards Not on Table, Says Hiram
Senator Johnson of California, Re

started the debate today witlya short
speech charging that the. treaty sup
porters had
something to conceal."
This assertion drew an indignant re
ply - from . Senator Hitchcock of Ne
braska, ranking Democrat of the for
eign relations committee,
clared the president was
who de-!
following i
well-established
precedents in keep-'peal
Ing the treaty text hr confidence, and !
, .' . . a A. V. !
tnat xor me. senate to request mm iu
do otherwise would be "a gross breach
of international propriety."
' Republican Leader Lodge, prospec
tive chairman of the foreign relations
iommittee, replied to Mr. Hitchcock,
declaring there was no impropriety
in the resolution unless it were Im
proper to ."call attention to the new
method of open covenants opanly ar
rived at.'"
' Every shopkeeper in Germany, de
clared the Massachusetts senator, was
reading the treaty as made public
at Berlin, yet the senate was pro
vided only with a "worthless" official
abstract. '
. A charge that the Republicans were
attempting to make the treaty a par
tisan question, was made by Senator
Robinson of Arkansas, Democrat, who
cited as evidence the telegram sent
by Mr. Lodge some weeks ago to Re
publican 'senators asking them not to
discuss the revised league of, nations
covenant pending a party conference.
The Republican .leader retorted that
the cautionary telegram had no .such
purpose' and that "not a word'? of dis
cussion of the treaty has passed in any
of the conferences of Republican sen
ators. , . '
v Sherman Attacks Wilson '
! A bitter attack onnhe league cove
nant and o f President Wilson's
course in the peace conference was
made by Senator Sherman of Illinois,
Republican, who earlier had presented
a resolution declaring it the sense
of the senate that the treaty and the
! covenant should be considered sepa
rately when they come up for ratifica
tion. I
At Mr. Sherman's, request his reso
lution went over and will be called up
for debate probably next week. '
How long the discussion is to con
tinue could not be predicted by either
side tonight. Senator Robinson gave
notice that he expected to address the
sennte at greater length Monday in
support of the treaty and Senator
Reed of Missouri, Democrat, who is
understood to oppose It, also, an
nounced that he would speak on the
subject Monday. Many other senators
are known to b preparing addresses.

such action would contribute to a fair
settlement of the questions raised by
the brewers under the emergency pro-

said, pending' review of his decision

brewers, confer with the senior judge
of the court of appeals ,to arrange an

HUN ENVOY ASSERTION
BERLIN, Thursday, May 22. (By
the Associated Press.) Prof. Hans
Delbrueck of the German peace dele
gation in a statement to the Versailles
correspondent of the Tageblatt;, at
tacks President Wilson for having put
himself completely in the hands of the
French and British by agreeing to
deviate from his 14 points.
"President Wilson," the professor
added,, "probably, imagines he did us
a favor in declining to -agree to such
demands as the cession of the left
bank of the Rhine and the dissolution
of Germany into several small states.
In reality, such demands would have
been better than the present condi
tions because we are so bound by the
latter that we can; hardly do anything
financially;.
"It is to be assumed that President
Wilson - knows European conditions
too little to survey their importance
and perhaps there is in the back o
his mind the thought of a conflict be
tween America and Japan and Ger
many must be so weakened that .she
will not be able to be Japan's ally."

PARIS, May 23. The reply of the
allied and associated powers to the
German note Ion tho eflect of the
economic clauses was made public to
day, in part it follows:
"The allied and associated pOwers
have received and have given careful
attention to the report of the commis
sion appointed by the German govern
ment to examine the economic tonli

' This report appears to them to con

of the facts of the case, to be marked
In parts by great exaggeration and to
Jgncre the fundamental considerations
arising both out of tiie incidence ami
the results of the war, which explain
and justify the terms that it is sought
to impose.

statement that the industrial re
sooices of Geinjany were inadequate

a population of G7.fMiO.000. and It ar

"As a partial offset against the
twelve and three-fourths million tons
of shipping sunk, it is proposed to
transfer four million tons of German
shipping. In other words, the shipping
which it is proposed to take fro Ger
many constitutes, less than one-third
of that which was thus wantonly de
stroyed. .
"Great stress is laid. oo .the proposal
that on the eastern side Germany shall

there is nothing in he peace treaty to
prevent either the continued produc

in question, or- their importation into
Germany. On the contrary, the free
admission of these products of the
eastern districts is provided for dur

appears to be no reason why their pro

"The German note makes special
complaint of the deprivation of coal,
and asserts that nearly one-third of
the production of the existing coal
mines will be lost. But it omits to no

earlier than usual and that if Repub
lican senators had not filibustered
they could have been passed with time
to spare. Representative TCitchln of
North Carolina, former Democratic
leader, declared that it was a "well
known fact" that three Republican
senators, by a "deliberate filibuster"
had stopped passage of the measures.
Organization of the house commit
tees is expected by Democratic and
Republican leaders to be, completed
by the first of the week. The appro
priations committee continued today
its discussions of the urgent deficiency
bills and the agricultural committee
appointed a sub-committee to consider
supplemental appropriations and
amendments to the agricultural bill.
The sub-committee will include in the
bill a rider providing for the repeat
of the daylight saving law. The
naval affairs and military affairs com
mittee will not hold meetings until
the minority 'members have been

LADY GODIVA WEARS
CLOTHES HEREAFTER
LONDON, May 23. Lady Godiva
may ride no more in Coventry. Least
wise not in the garb that nature gave
her, or any approach to it. For many
years the Godvia pageant, which
memorialized the day when a titled
lady rode naked through the town to
redeem a tax and a peeping Tom
looked from behind his curtain, gave
Coventry distinction. Now , church
people have started a movement to
fully clothe the female who imper
sonates Lady Godvia in a revival of
the pageant along with the peace celebration.
The Most Proposed-to Woman in the
World.
A wonderfully appealing type is the
artistic lover.' It is" he, and he only,
who can make love so that the flow
ers, the trees, the stars and the heav
ens are part of the universe of love
with which he surrounds his beloved.
The artistic lover brings to his love
making all the beautiful things of life
it is he who can best paint in words
the burning thoughts which fill his
soul for his loved ones.
The artistic type, of lover is not
necessarily, or even usually an artist.
I mean by an artistic lover,, one wh
appreciates and loves the beautiful
wherever it may be. A woman who is
herself of the artistic type can beBt
appreciate this type-of lover. It'is
only she who can make the future
home what her lover-husband can best
appreciate. '
If you are yoiJrself an artistio girl,
you should seek out for your mate the
artist type . of lover. If not, you had
better steer clear of him. He will
make love to you anyhow, if he has
the chance, but you will be wise to
marry some other type.
Next The Persistent Lover.

parel and other valuables in one
of the rooms in the Oliver house
occupied by Mrs. Brown. The
recovered articles were identified
by the hotel guests frbm whose
rooms they had disappeared and
restored to the owners, who ex
pressed reluctance to file a com
plaint. Mrs. Brown was then given a
"safe conduct 'out of the city,
which, say the officials, she very
readily accepted. She left on the
5:30 train, eastbouna. J
Mrs. Brown has been a familiar
figure around the Lobby of the
Copper Queen hotel. She took her
meals at that place but occupied
a room in the Oliver house.
A few months ago Mr. and Mrs.
Bert Brown left Magdelena, N. M.,
suddenly, it is alleged, and came
to Bisbee. After being here for
only a short time Brown was ap
prehended by the police for driv
ing an automobile while in an in
toxicated condition. The arrest
was made on the night of March
23 by Deputy Sheriff Jack Ryan
after Brown had driven the car
Into the side of the road and dam
aged it. Brown's bond at that
time ' was set at $50 by Judge
Hogan and bond was furnished
by "Dick" Rich. The car, it is al
leged, was taken without permis
sion of the owner from in front of
the Copper Queen hotel. The mat
ter was amicably adjusted after
Brown paid a fine of $25 in the
local police court and he left the
city and went to Phoenix.
Mrs. Brown's father, it is said,
is a wealthy clothing manufac
turer of St., Louis to which place
she is believed to have gone.

'.'But should not the coal situation
be viewed from a different and -wider
standpoint? It cannot be forgotten
that among the most wanton acts per
petrated by the German armies during
the war was the most complete de
struction by her forces of the coal
fields of northern France. The result
has been a grave and prolonged short
age of coal In western Europe. There
can be no reason in equity, why the
effect of tliis shortage should be borne
exclusively by the allied nations who
were it's victims, or why Germany.

This Is patricularly true In the cot

The June Wedding
Hear the sounds of silvery laughter echoing through the room,
catch the excitedly whispered conversations,' listen to the rustling of
silks what's it all about, anyhow?
Can't you guess?
Almost anyone ought to see at onee just what it means
Sister's getting ready for her June wedding!
Yes, she's going to leave the old home and the preparations for the
important event are in full blast.
Brother makes alleged humorous remarks about the preparation of
HIS outfit he's to be best man, you know and he wants to know when
the tailors can come and begin cutting and sewing on his nevtt full dress
suit.
Father steps softly and carefully through the living room to his
favorite chair in the library he knows what wailing and gnashing of
teeth there would be if he inadvertently stepped on a yaluable bit Of
lace dropped on the floor in the Tush and flurry. ''
And the kid, otherwise known as Buster, hides spools and bits of
gown to his own great glee and the consternation of all the women folks
concerned.
It's a happy time, of course, -but every now and then mother looks
just a trifle wistful.
For Instance, when sister goes through all the booka in the library
and picks out those that are her's.
Slvo piles them in a neat heap and says she's going to take them
with her to the new house. - '
It makes the library shelves look rather bare almost as though
the family wa3 breaking up housekeeping.
Then sister sorts out the other things that are her's. It gives a queer,
different atmosphere te things when she does this.
No wonder mother locks wistful.
But sister smiles and pats mother's rather sad countenance and says:
"Never mind, mother, I'm not really leaving the old home, you know.
I'm going to live so close by that it will be just the same as ever.
I'll be home with you all just the same as ever."
Mother smiles wisely, but says nothing. She knows it will never
be the same. You see, she went through all this and. felt just the same
as sister does, when she prepared her own wedding, many years ago.
Help The Soldier Farm
It would appear that the time has passed when a farmer could get
into the producing class with a net capital of nine children and $200.
A returned soldier, who started out with $1500 and an agricultural
ambition, has been telling us a few of his troubles.
"I only wanted to farm a small rented place, so I. started out to
buy a heavy young horse.
"After dickering around for ten.; days I found what I wanted; a
great big fine mare, with colt by her side, and as a special concession
the patriotic sen of a gun would sell her to me for $275, cash."
The would-be farmer will find a few cheap horses these days, but
they are dear at any price; a young, sound, heavy horse costs more than
a team, wagon and harness did a few years ago.
"Then I started out to acquire a cow. I thought I might have to go
as high as $90 for a five-gallon animal. I found nothing I would have
for less than $123 and a really good cow was priced at $50 more; and
plenty of buyers too."
No wonder milk Is 15 cents a quart.
, "Then I thought maybe I would like a few pigs," the would-be tiller
told us; "and I found that an ordinary brood sow, bred, was worth about
what I figured on paying for a cow, and that five weeks' old pigs, of
no special pedigree, were going at $8 each.
"And a cemmon sheep costs around $25, and they wanted $3 for a
setting hen, and from $1.50 up for a setting of eggs.
"A walking plow that was $5 is $14. a harrow cost as much as a
mowing machine did, a mowing machine as much as a binder, and a
binder as much, almost, as a threshing machine once did.
"After figuring it all out I decided to go back to my old job. My
little old $1500 wouldn't let me sit in this farm game long enough to buy
more than three white ,chips for the first ante."
And there goes another potential producer back to the ranks of
worried consumers.
The Preacher is Not a Burden
An individual may be of more indirect value to society than as a
direct producer.
This through the service to the actual worker in rendering his
efforts more effective.
In a good deal of the 'economic literature and discussion of today
the preacher, doctor, lawyer, foreman and the superintendent Is referred
to as a "burden" or "non-productive" charge upon society.
If, for instance, the preacher can render his congregation of actual
workers moral support and prove an intellectual stimulus to them, he i3
of as much value to society as any one of them.
The same is true with the doctor in keeping the actual workers in
health or curing them when they are sick.
It li also true with the lawyer in keeping the actual producer out of
quarrels or acting in thoir settlements v. hen they get into them.
The Torenian and superintendent can Increase production of the in
dividual worker by intelligent direction.
These professions" and executives are in the nature of "overhead"
charges, but they are not 'burden or non-productive charges.
The coat of heat and light in a factory or store, for instance, are
overhead charges.
They do not actually produce or sell any goods, "yet it. would be
hard to produce and sell without them.
Finding a New Excuse For Failure
Now that the country is going dry, there are many men who will
have trouble in proving an alibi for their failure in life!
There are many drinking men in every community, who are clever,
learned and even wi.so far above the average.
These have reached or nre past middle life without being a success.
Drink is given as the reason for their failure by their friends, the
community and frequently themselves, and even though they may drink
less than some who ara more in the way of success.
These men seem to he complafpnt in the excuse offered for them;
their pride is satisfied in spite or thoir lack or success.
This Is not a justification for drink in any way, hut we were just
wondering what excuse can now be offered after July 1 for those of
whom we now say "What a success he would be if he didn't drink."
How arc theso men going to prove an alibi?
I'oHSKibly it will be easier for them to succeed than find a new cx-
cuse for failure.

AUTOISTS AND STATE
OFFICIALS CONFER ON
NEW MOTORING LAW
PHOENIX. May 22 Administration
cf the new law which will regulate
motor vehicles plying for hire on and
after June 18 next, was discussed at a
meeting of more than 100 representa
tives of private interests and public of
ficials from all sections of the state
here today. The conference, called by
the state corporation commission, was
held in the senate chamber at the cap
itol. What was described as an impossi
ble situation was the provision in the
measure to be put into effect at mid
night June 17, hich automatically
outlaws all unlicensed stage and auto
mobile line3 without making provision
for granting the necessary permits be
fore hand.
Members of the corporation com
mission stated that to avoid injustice
to owners of automobiles plying for
hire, blank applications foj licenses
would be mailed out and immediately
the law went into effect, the required
hearings on applications received
would be permittod to operate until
their status had been defined, the com
mission undertaking to overlook this
technical violation of the regulations.
During the conference today it was
suggested that opposition lines be not
allowed to set their time schedules toof
close too each other, it being pointed
out by spreading the schedules out
greater service would be rendered to
the public. ,
Two matters which received exhaus
tive discussion pertained to bonds to
cover damages from accidents and the
breakage and loss of packages and
baggage in transit.
Among those present were city and
county officials, sheriffs and county
attorneys and their representatives;
stage company and taxi company rep
ance agents' and railroad representatives.

"LIBERTY" HIGHWAY 1
TO BISECT ARIZONA
PHOEXIX, May 23 The Liberty
highway being promoted by an organi
zation launched March 19, at Quincy,
Ills., will run through Arizona on its
rcute from Atlantic City, N. J., to Pas
adena, Cal., according to advices re
ceived here today by the Chamber cf
Commerce.
"This highway," said the letter from
Trueman Pierson, secretary, of tne as
sociation behind the- movement, "is to
be dedicated to the cause of liberty
and to these brave boys who gave their
lives to the cause of liberty. It will
be a trough trunk line for motors and
other vehicles extending from Atlantic
City, N. J. ,to Pasadena, Cal.
"The exact location of the route
"through each state will be decided at
sectional convention. The highway will
cross the Mississippi river at Liberty,
Illinois."
Residents of the district who
took down their stoves and moved
them to the barn or basement or
cellar, forgot May of last year
and May of 1917, and the many
other Mays which have passed
since the Warren district was an
infant and stoves were a luxury
which only a few possessed, and
yesterday and the day preceding,
many shivered to the tune of a
May wind and a fast falling mer
cury. Temperatures in the district as
recorded by the engineering de
partment of the Phelps Dodge cor
poration ranged yesterday from
41 degrees, low, to 61 degrees,
high. Oa the day preceding when
the cold snap first broke over the
district the lowest register of the
mercury was 52 and the highest
81 degrees. The low of yesterday
was registered early in the morn
ing and the high just after the
noon hour.
In May, 1917, the district expe
rienced much colder and snappier
weather than has prevailed this
year. On May 19, 1917, the tem
perature registered as low as 3J
degrees, wfth a high range of 66
for the same day. The netx year
May gave the district two days
which have been forgotten by
those who moved their stoves.
May 11, 1918, nearly equalled yes
terday when the thermometer
ranged from 42 degrees to 64 de
grees, and again on May 30 the
same year, the weather attacked
spring fever with a little snap,
ranging from 43 to 74 degrees.
"Early winter we're havin,"
greeted one citizen to the other
yesterday on the streets.
"Betcba," replied the other
citizen. "Also, darned short sum
mer we've had. Got in your win
ter's coal yet?"
"No, been waitin for the sum
mer bargains in prices."
"Forget it. If this keeps up
you'll be wishing you'd filled tn
bins at war time prices."
Men and women hurried about
the streets with the pep and
ginger of winter. Palm beach
suits and straw hats, which had
made rapid strides in popularity
within the past week, began dis
appearing day before yesterday.
By noon yesterday it was impos
sible to find a man who would
admit owning such an article of
apparel.
"No," he would declare, "I've
knows all along this was coming.
I never buy my summer duds until
after the May cold snaps have
passed."
Then he goes home and the wife
reminds him that he took the
stove down last Sunday. Unfor
tunately she presents him also
with the first spring bill for clean
ing and pressing his "ice cream"
suit.

GLOBE, May 23. There is a se

PHOENIX, May 23. Raising the
lowest rates for the shipment of live

is the naive way the railroad adminis

livestock freight rates from Arizona
to the packing house districts in the
Mississippi valley, according to in
formation received yesterday by the
corporation commission.
The present rate, say from Phoenix
to Kansas City, are quoted at $185
per car via the Southern Pacific and
$168 via the Santa Fe. They would
make them both $185.
The rate on sheep on the two roads,
at $185 and $150 would be "equalled1
up to $185.

An Investment Your Banker Will Recommend
The refinery is the sound, substantial manufacturing end of the oil business the safe end where never a dollar is lost
and it is at the same time, the most PROFITABLE end. Refinery stock is the character of stock that the shrewd
and conservative investor on Wall Street buys for the INVESTMENT and DIVIDENDS the. sort of stock that is
found in the strong boxes of the wealthy and successful men of the world.
The greatest profit is always made in the manufacture and sale of the finished product. The production company
after taking all the RISK of drilling for oil sells it's production for $2.50 per barrel. The refinery converts this crude
oil into refined petroleum products at a net profit of $1 5 per barrel. On a refining plant of 1000 barrels daily capac
ity this would make net earnings of $5,000 per day or $1,825,000 per year 600 per cent on our entire capitaliza
tion. A great many refineries located as we are, where an ample supply of crude oil is readily accessible, have ex
ceeded this earning. The map shows the pipe lines that lead into Fort Worth. Note that two of these lines cross our
refinery site, assuring direct connection with the greatest oil fields in the world, giving us plenty of crude oil at a low
delivery cost. We are taking no RISK we will buy the crude oil and refine, taking the BIG and SURE profits.
The officers of the Panther City Oil & Refining Co. are competent, reliable, efficient and progressive business men,

MILITARY JUDGMENT
LEMDUKG, May 23. Ukrainian
cabinets may change, 'but General Pet
lura, like Kolchak at Omsk, remains
the power, and if he i3 given equip
ment by the allies he says he can
drive the Bolshevik! out of the
Ukraine.
But for their struggle with the
Polish .this aid might be forthcom
ing. One who goes into Ukrainia goes
under a white flag, with a trumpeter
blowing ahead. But the white flag
is punctilously respected, and arrival
at the Ukrainian headquarters reveals
a group of officers who will average
well wRh those in the Austrian army
in which they all have served. '
They live simply, and they have
taken a pledge to abstain from alco
holic drink so long as they serve at
the front.
Petlura lives as pimply in his saloon
carriage as the men ho serve him.
He is a man of medium height,
dark and slender, about 40 years of
age. He wears a plain brown uni
form, with the only sign of rank a
simple filigree badge, the trident of
the Ukraine. . ' .
He is clean shaven, looks like a
priest, and has a voice that is quiet
and grave.
Educated in a seminary and then in
the Univesity of Letnburg, Petlura
has no illusions concerning the life of
a soldier and no love .for military
rule.
He blames military opinion for the
fact that his forces have never been
linked up with the allies at Odessa.
"I have nothing to say against sold
iers," declared Petlura, "save that by
training they take the military point
of view. They demanded that Win
nichenko, and then later myself,
should leave the directorate before
the question of the recognition of the
TTkrnine hv the allies could be consid
ered. Because I had taken up arms

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 23. Optimistic
trade prospects entertained by lead
ers of industry', further relaxation of
money rates and prospective modifies
tion of the peace treaty were the most
noteworthy contribution to today's ac
tive and strong- stock market.
Until the final hour, when the up
swing of prices became more general,
the session was in most essentials a
duplicate of the preceding days. The
undertone was one of quiet confidence
and aside from the gyrations of a few
specialties the advance was almost
continuous.
The movement focussed largely
around the steels and kindred shares,
receiving its greatest momentum from
the addresa of Elbert H. Gary before
the American Iron and Steel institute
in which he predicted prosperous con
ditions for that industry.
United States Steel rose steadily to
107, a- gain of 4 points, and its maxi
mum of the year .the independent
group gaining 2 to 6 points. Motors,
which depend on the trend of the steel
market, also recorded many substan
tial advances extending to 15 points
in Chandlers.
Rails were among the leaders in
point of activity and strength at one
period of. the session, although their
rise was comparatively moderate, but
shippings and oils denoted further
selling for profits. Metals, leathers
tabaccos were "more restricted in their
movements. Sales 1,350,000 shares.
Bonds as a 'whole were firm, but
some of the speculative rails made
moderate concessions on small offer
ings. . Total sales, par value, $10,875,:
000. Old United States bonds were
unaltered on call.
WOOL MARKET STEADIER
BOSTON,' May 23. The Commercial
Bulletin tomorrow will say:
"The wool market has at last struck
a steadier pace and while values are
firm for all good wools there is no hy
steria apparenjt in the market and
wools .are now being sold on their
merits more than at any time since
the armistice was signed. Some of
the new Utah wools are being sold at
slight profits over cost in the original
bags.
"The foreign markets were general
ly firm with London strong for all ex
cept very inferior wools."

TRADE ACTIVITY SHIFTY
NEW YORK, May 23. Bradstreet's
tomorrow will say:
"Something like a shifting of activ
ity is revealed in the trade and indus
trial reports this week. Cool, rainy
weather and the lateness of some of
the spring . planted crops, especially
corn and cotton, seem to be more
stressed at the 6malled markets, but
increased activity, strength and con
fidence is revealed at the larger cen
ters, while in instances where weather
conditions have been favorable and
seasonable temperatures have prevail
ed, the trend has been a very cheerful
one. On balance, jobbing and retail
trade reports show a slight ebbing of
activity and collections a$e a shade
slower than last week."
Weekly bank clearings $7,799,636,
000. MONEY COMMISSION SOUGHT
i WASHINGTON, May 23. Creation
of an international monetary exchange
commision for the purpose of inquiring
into and ascertaining what methods
and legislation are essential to estab
lish the continuance of a fixed ratio
of currency between the nations of the
world, is proposed in a resolution in-
'troduced today by Senator Thomas,
Democrat, of Colorado.
THE GRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 23. Despite persis
tent selling ' today . the market ril
lied at the last owing to a renewal of
wet weather.- Prices closed unsettled,
c net lower to c advance, with
July $L65 to $1.65i4 and September
$1.55 to $1.58. Oats finished to c
down, and provisions unchanged to a
decline of 85c.
Assertions that corn planting would
be held back several days in import
ant sections put the bears at a sudden
disadvantage just before, the session
ended. Previously the market had
shown! weakness, influenced by the
fact that country offerings were more
liberal.
- Oats reflected a sharp break in the
value of barley. Polls indicating the
congress might not remove war time
.prohibition was chiefly responsible.
Slowness of cash 1 demand together
with down turns - itt the hog market
and with a falling 'oft in clearances
from New York operated as a weight
on provisions.
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, May 23. Lead, easy;
spot $5.205.35; July $5.255.40.
Spelter, easy spot East St. Louis

LIEUTENANT DOUGLAS
RECOVERING RAPIDLY
FOLLOWING OPERATION
Son of Mr. and Mrs. Jas.'G.
Douglas Under Knife
For Appendicitis'
Tips of the Town
Lieutenant Lewis uougias, who was
operated on for appendicitis Thurs
day at the Copper Queen hospital, was
reported last night to have withstood
the operation successfully and to be
recovering rapidly.
Lieutenant Douglas, who saw ser
vice overseas with the American Ex
peditionary forces .returned from
France several weeks ago and after
visiting his parents, Mr. and .Mrs.
James S. Douglas in Douglas, he went
to Jerome to accept a position with
the United Verde Extension mine in
the operating department. It was while
at Jerome that he complained of not
feeling well and it was then decided
to bring him to Bisbee for medical ex
amination. Dr. Randolph made a diagnosis of
acute appendicitis and as a result
Lieutenant Douglas was removed to.
the Copper Queen hospital, where the
operation was performed last Thurs
day. ,
Mr. and Mrs. Douglas came to the
city from Douglas and were present at
the operation. They will remain here
at the'opper Queen hotel until their
son passes thiough the crisis.
As soon as Lieutenant Douglas has
completely recovered from the opera
tion he will return to Jerome to re
sume his I duties with the United
Verde Extension. At present the mine
has not yet resumed production, but
everything is being rapidly- arranged
for that purpose, and it is expected
that soon the smelter will be put in
operation.
