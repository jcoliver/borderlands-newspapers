CHICAGO, May 20. Virgil G.
Hlnhaw, chairman of the prohibi

in a statement tonight condemned
the proposal to congress in Presi
dent Wilson's message today to re
move the July 1 ban on light
wines and beer. His statement
concluded with the words that
"every patriot should see to it that
congress represents the people at

chief executive when his Ideas are
not in harmony with as many as
one-third of the people."
ST. LOUIS, May 20. President
Wilson was criticized today by

Marshal Foch is taking nothing for

of the Germans at. Versailles. He has
made a visit to the occupied area and
has informed the council of four of
the military preparations that have
been made contingent on the Germans
refusing to accept the allied peace
terms. Likewise, General Pershing,
the American commander, is' wide
awake to the possibilities of the sit-

him for the present week, has been
indefinitely postponed, and he will re

TONTAi DELGADA, May 20. (By
the Associated Press.) Lieutenant
Commander A. p. Read, in command
of the American seaplane NC-4, ex
pects to start for Lisbon at 6 o'clock
tomorrow morning. He hopes to reach
there before dark.
If all is well with the flight, an
overnight stop will be made at Lisbon
and the NC-4 will proceed on the last
lap of the trans-Atlantic journey for
Plymouth, weather permitting.
The NC-4 was overhauled here today
and took on a fuil supply of fuev-
The NC-1, which was in command of
Lieutenant Commander Bellinger,
sank off Corvo this afternoon after the
United States destroyer Fairfax was
unable to salvage her. The heavy seas
made towing impossible, and the de
: stroyer stood by waiting for the
! weather to moderate. But the body
of the machine filled with water and
the wingH wert broken off. This
combined with the weight of the en
gine caused the plane to settle many
fathoms deep.
NC-4 LAST HOPE
WASHINGTON, May 20 Tuggings
at anchor n the harbor of Ponta Del
gada, Azores, the seafJlane NC-4, the
Tone surviving entry of the American
navy for first trans-Atlantic flight hon
ors, awaits only favorable weather for
the start of the 800-mile dash to Lis
bon, Portugal. f
Alter three days at Horta, where
she landed upon completion of the
record breaking flight from Newfound
land, Lieutenant Commander Albert C.
Read's big ship flew to Ponta Del
gada, covering 150 mines in one hour
and 44 minutes. This was at the rate
of approximately 86 miles an hour.
Rear Admiral Jackson, In reporting
the arrival of the NC-4 at Ponta Del
gada, said the plane was "OK" and
Flight Commander John H. Towers to
night reported the plane to be in "ex
cellent condition." Naval officials
here expect the NC-4 to get away to
morrow unless weather conditions are
very bad. The flight to Lisbon should
not require more than 10 hours. After
replenishing fuel suppUes and being
overhauled in Portugal, the NC-4 will
undertake the last leg of the voyage
to Plymouth, England.
The NC-4 was definitely made the
sole reliance of the American navy in
an attempt at this time to cross the
Atlantic through the air, a report re
ceived tonight from Commander Tow
ers at ; Ponta Delgada, who informed
the navy department of the sinking at
sea of the NC-1 and the commence
ment of the dismantling of the NC-3
preparatory to shipping the plane back
to the United States. Previous re
ports had said the NC-1 was outside
the port of Horta in bad condition,
and It was presumed by navy officials
here that her bow was torn out by de
stroyers attempting to tow ner into
port.
It had been thought that the NC-3,
despite the damage wrought during
nearly 60 hours spent on a high run
ning sea might be put into shape to
resume the flight. Commander Tow
ers evidently after examining his flag
ship decided to leave the field to the
NC-4 alone.
Naval experts said today that the
performances thus far in the trans
Atlantic flight have demonstrated that
great strides in aviation have been
made from an engineering standpoint,
but that the development of seaplanes
has not yet reached the stage where
they are of deonstrated commercial
value.

Wilson Urges Repeal of
Beer, Wine, Prohibition
And Retail Sale Taxes
WASHINGTON, May 20. President
Wilson in his message to congress to
day, recommended depeal of the war
time prohibition law so far as it ap5
plies to' wine and beer only; an
nounced definitely that the railroad
systems and telegraph and telephone
lines would be returned to private
ownership; urged a revision of war
taxes, particularly to abolish the
manufacturers and retaH sales ex
cises; and outlined generally a pro
gram respecting labor.
These were the "high spots" of the
president's message cabled from Paris.
The president's message follows:
Text of Message
Gentlemen of the Congress: I deep
ly regret my inability to be present
at ' the ' opening of the extraordinary
session of congress. It still seems to
be ray duty to take part in the coun
sels of the peace conference and con
tribute -what I can to the solution of
the innumerable questions to whose
settlement it has had to address it
self. For they are questions which
affect the peace of the whole world
and from them therefore, the United
States cannot stand apart. I deemed
it my duty to call the congress to
gether at this time because it was
not wise to postpone longer the pro
visions which must be made for tn
support of the government. Many of
the appropriations which are abso
lutely necessary for the maintenance
of the government and the fulfillment
of its varied, obligations for the fiscol
year 1919-1920 .have- not, . yet been
made; the end of the present fiscal
year is at hand; and action upon
these appropriations can no longer be
prudently delayed. It is necessary
therefore, that I should Immediately
call your attention to jthis critical
need. It is hardly necessary for me
to urge that it may , receive your
prompt attention. I shall take the lib
erty of addressing you on my return
on the subjects. which have most en
grossed our attention and the atten
tion of the world during these last
anxious months, since the armistice
of last November was signed, the in
ternational settlements which musi
form the subject matter of the pres
ent treaties 6t peace and of our nation
al action in the immediate future.
Peace Problems Premature
It would be premature to discuss
them or to express a judgment about
thpm hefore they are brought to their
complete formulation by the agree
ments which are now being sougnt at
ho tihle of the conference. I shall
hope to lay them before you In their
many aspects as soon as arrangements
have been reached.
I hesitate to venture any opinion
or press any recommendation with re
MrH tn domestic legislation while ab
sent from the United States and out of
daily touch with intimate sources
of Information and counsel. I am
conscious that I need, after so long an
absence from Washington, to see me
advice of those who have remained in
constant contact with domestic prob
lems and who have known them colse
at hand from day to day; and urusi
that it will very soon be possible
for me to do so. But there are sev
eral questions pressing for considera
tion to which I feel that I may and
indeed must even now direct your at
tention, if In only general terms. Tn
speaking of them I .shall, I dare say,
be doing little more than speak your
own thoughts. I nape that I shall
speak your, own judgment also. . The
question which stands at the front of
u fttiiAm tn every country amidst
'the present great awakening is the
question of labor; and pernaps l can
speak of it with as great advantage
while engrossed in the consideration
of interests which affect all countries
alike as I could at home and amidst
no interests of our own people.
By "the question of labor I do not
mean the question of erncientMnaus
trial production; the question of how
labor is to be obtained and made ef
fective in the great process of bus
tuininr nonulations and winning sue-
,uau-D a- a
cess amidst commercial and industrial
rivalries. I mean that much greater
and more vital question,! how are the
men and women who do the dally
labor of the world to obtain pro.
gressive improvement in the condi
tions of their labor; to be made hap
pier and to be served better by the
communities and the industries which
their labor sustains and advances?
How are they to be given their right
advantages as citizens and, human be
ings? We cannot go any further in our
present direction. We have alreaaj
gone too far. We cannot live our right
life as a nation or achieve our proper
success as an industrial community
if capital and labor are to continue
te be antagonistic instead of being
partners; if they are to continue to
distrust one another and contrive how
they cap get the better of another;
or, what perhaps amounts to the same
thing, calculate by what form and
degree of coercion they can. manage
to extort, on the one . hand, work
enough to make enterprise profitable;
on the other, justice and fair treat
ment enough to make life tolerable.
That bad road has turned out a blind
alley. It is no thoroughfare to real
prosperity. . We must find another,
leading in another direction and to a
very different destination. It must
lead not merely to accommodation but
also to a genuine co-operation and
partnership based upon a real com
munity of interest, and participation
in control.
Urges Labor Partnership
TheVe is now in fact a real com
munity of interest between capital
and labor but it has never been made
evident in action. It can be made
operative and manifest only in a new
organization of industry. The genius
of our business men and the sound,
practical sense of our workers can
certainly work such a partnership out
when once they realize exactly what
it in that they seek and sincerely
adopt a common purpose with regard
to it.
Labor legislation lies, of course,
chiefly with the states; but the new
spirit and method ot organization
which inust be effected afre not to be
brought about by legislation so much
as by the common counsel and volun
tary co-operation of capitalist, man
ager and workman. Legislation can
go only a very little way in command
ing what shall be dope. The organiza
tion of industry is a matter of corpor
ate and individual initiative and of
practical business arrangement. Those
who really desire a new relationship
between capital and labor can readily
find a wav to bring It about and per
haps federal legislation can help mor
than state legislation could. Tne od
ject of all reform In this essential mat
ter must be the genuine democratiza
tion of industry, based upon a" full
recognition of the right of those who
work, in whatever rank, to participate
in some organic way in every decision
which directly affects their welfare
or the Dart they are to play In indus
try. Some positive legislation is prac
ticable. The congress has already
shown the way to one reform which
should be world-wide, by establishing
the eight hour day as the standard
day in every field of labor over which
it can. exercise control. It has sought
to find the way to prevent child labor
and will, I hope and believe, presently
find it. It has served the whole coun
try by leading the way in developing
the means ot preserving and Bafe-
euardink life and health in dangerous
industries." It can now help in the
difficult task of giving a new form and

created in connection with the league

Backs Lone Soldier Plan
I am sure that it is not necessary
for me to remind you that there is
one immediate and very practical
question of labor that we bhould meet
in the most liberal spirit.
We must see to it that our returning
soldiers are assisted in every practi
cable way to find the places for which
they are fitted in the daily work of
the country. This can be dote by
developing and maintaining upon an
adequate scale the admirable organiza
tion created by the department of la
bor for placing men seeking worK.

one very great field, by creating new
opportunities for

Tax System Faulty
'Credit and enterprise alike will be
quickened by timely and helpful legis
lation with regard to taxation. I hope
that the co igress will find it possible
to undertake an early reconsideration
of federal taxes In order to make our
syetem of taxation more simple and
easy of administration and the taxes
tlwrnselvoB as little burdensome as
they can be made and yet suffice to
support the government and meet all
its obligations. The figures to which
those obllKatiemg have arisen are very
grvat indeed, but they are not so great
as to make it difficult for the nation
to meet them and meet them, perhaps,
in a single generation, by taxes which
Mill neither crush, nor discourage.
Thene aro not ho great as they teein.
not so great us the immense sums wo
have had to borrow, to the immense
sums we have hud to raise by taxation,
would beiu to' iudwate; tor a vtry
tlxe resources of the country, that its
rates shall be stable and that it shall
be constant in its revenue-yielding
power. We have found the main
sources from which it must be drawn.
I take it for granted that its mainstays
will henceforth be the income tax,
the excess profits tax, and the estate
tax. . All these can so' be adjusted to
yield constant and adequate returns
and yet not constitute a too grievous
burden on the taxpayer. A revision
of the income tax. has already been
provided for by the act of 1918, but I
think you will find that further
changes can be made! to advantage,
both in the. rates of tax and the meth
od of its collection. The excess prof
its tax need not long be maintained at
the rates, wfcdcb were-necessary while
the enormous expenses of the war had
to be borne ; but it should be made the
basis of a permanent system which
will reach undue profits without dis
couraging." the enterprise and activity
of our business men. The tax on in
heritances ought, no doubt, to be re
considered in its relation to the fiscal
systems, of the several states, but it
certainly ought to remain a permanent
part of the-fiscal system of the fed
eral government also.
Asks Retail Tax Repeal .
Many of the minor taxes provided
for In the revenue legislation of 1917
and 1918, though no doubt made neces
sary by the pressing necessities of
war time, could hardly find sufficient
Justification under the easier circum
stances of peace and can now happily
be got rid of. Among these, I hope
you will agree, are the excises upon
various manufacturers and the taxes
upon retail sales. They are unequal
in the incidence on different indus
tries and on different individuals.
Their collection is difficult and ex
pensive. Those which are levied upon
articles sold at retail are largely evad
ed by the readjustment of retail prices.
On the other hand I should assume
that it is expedient to maintain a con
siderable range of indirect taxes; and
the fact that alcoholic liquors will
presently no longer afford a source of
revenue by taxation makes it the more
necessary that the field should be
carefully re-studied in order that
equivalent sources of revenue may be
found which it will be legitimate and
not burdensome to draw upon. But
you have at hand in the treasury de
partment mny experts who can ad
vise you upon the matters much better
than I can. I can only suggest the
lines of a permanent and workable
system, and the placing of the taxes
where they will least hamper the life
of the people.
European Competition Nil
There is, unfortunately, no occasion
for undertaking in the immediate fu
ture any general revision of our sys
tern of import duties. No serious dan
ger of foreign competition now threat
ens American industries. Our coun
try has emerged from the. war less
disturbed and less weakened than any
of the European countries which are
our competitors in manufacture. Their
industrial establishments have been
subject to greater strain than ours
their labor force to a more serious
disorganization and this is clearly not
the time to seek an organized advant
age. ' The work of more reconstruction
will, I am afraid, tax the capacity and
the resources of their people for years
to come. So far from their being any
danger or need of accentuated foreign
competition, it is likely that the condi
tions of the' next few years will
greatly facilitate the marketing of
American manufactured goods abroad
Least of all should we depart from the
policy adopted in the tariff act. of
1913. of permitting the free entry into
the United States of the raw ma
terials, needed to supplement and en
rich our own abundant supplies.
Protect Chemical Industy
'. Nevertheless, there are parts of our
tariff system which. need prompt at
tention. The experiences of the war
have made it plain that in some cases
too great reliance on foreign supply
is dangerous and that' in determining
certain parts of our tariff policy do
mestic considerations must be born
in mind which are political as well as
economic. Among the Industries to
which special consideration, should be
given is that of the manufacture of
dyestuffs and related chemicals. Our
complete dependence upon German
supplies before the war, made the in
terruptioii of trade a cause of excep
tional economic disturbance. The
close relation between the ruanufac
turer of dyestuffs on the one hand
and of explosives and poisonous gases
on the other, moreover, has given the
industry a id exceptional significance
and value. Although the United
States will gladly and unhesitatingly
Join in I he program of international
disarmament Ifc will, nevertheless, be a
policy o fohvioutt prudence to make
certain of the successful maintenance
if many utrong a.-id well equipped
and chemical plants. The German
themical InJustry. with which we w!U
be brought into competition was. and
may 'veil be again, a thoroughly ku'.t
monopoly capable of exercising a com
petition ot a peculiarly insidious and
dangerous kind. The United States
should, moreover, have the means ot
properly protectiag itself wherever
our trade is discriminated against by
foreign nations, in order that we ma
be assured of that equality of treat
ment which we hope to accord and to
promote the world over. Our tariff
laws as they now stand provide no
weapon of retaliation in case otner
governments should enact legislation
unequal in its bearing on our products
as compared with the products of oth
er nations.
Though we are as far as possible
from desiring to enter upon any course
of retaliation, we must frankly face
the fact that hostile legislation by
other nations is not beyond the range
of possibility and that it may have
to be met by counter legislation.
This subject has, fortunately, been
exhaustively investigated by the Uni
ted States ariff commission. A re
cent report of that commission has
show very clearly that we lack and
TO THE HONORABLE THE BOARD
OF SUPERVISORS OF COCHISE
COUNTY, STATE OF ARIZONA
GENTLEMEN:
- In compliance with the require
ments of Chapter 31 of the Sessions
Laws of Arizona, regular Session,
1917, and the Acts supplementary
thereof and amendatory thereto the
Highway Commission appointed, by
Jour honorable body May 6th, and
composed of B. A. Packard, chairman,
A. Y. Smith, secretary, Emil Marks,
T. D. Fulgham, Harry E. Pickett, -does
hereby report as follows:
This Commission has investigated
the roads designated in the call
made at a meeting of citizens from all
parts of the county, held at Douglas,
Arizona, May 3rd, 1919, and after due

WOODROW WILSON.
called to this matter on past occasions
aa4 the measures which are now re
commended Dy tne lariii commission
are substantially the same that have
been suggested by previous adminis
trations. I recommend that this phase
of the tariff question receive the early
attention ot the congress.
Urges Woman Suffrage
Will you not permit me, turning
from these matters to speak once
more and very earnestly of the pro
posed amendment to the constitution
which would extend the suffrage to
women and which passed the house of
representatives at the last session of
the congress? It seems to me that
every consideration of justice and of
public advantage calls for the imme
diate adoption of that amendment and
Its submission forthwith to the leg
islatures of the several . states.
Thronzhout the world this long de
layed extension of the suffrage Is
looked for; ia the United States long
er. I believe than anywhere else, the
necessity for it and the immense ad
vantage of it to the national life, has
been urged and debated by women and
men who saw the need for it and
urged the policy of it, when it required
steadfast courage to be so much be
forehand with the common conviction;
and I, for one, covet for our country
the distinction of being among the
first to act In a great reform.
' Promises Wire Return
The telegraph and telephone lines
will, of course, be returned to their
owners so soon as the re-transfer can
be effected without administrative
confusion; so soon, that is, as the
change can be made with' least pos
sible inconvenience to the pnblic and
to the owners themselves. The rail
roads will be handed over to their
owners at the end of the 'calendar
year. If I were in immediate contact
with the administrative questions
which must goven the re-transfer of
the telegraph and telephone lines I
could name the exact date for their
return also. Until I am in direct
contact with the practical, questions
involved I can ouly suggest that in the
case of the telegraphs and telephones,
as in the case of the railways, it is
clearly desirable in" the public inter
est that some legislation should be
considered which may tend to make of
these indispensable instrumentalities
of our modern life a uniform and co
ordinated system which will afford
those who use them as complete and
certain means of communication with
all parts of the country as has so long
been afforded by the postal system
of the government and at rates as uni
form and intelligible. Expert advice
is, of course, available in this very
practical matter, and the publid In
terest is manifest. Neither the tele
graph nor the telephone service of
the country can be said to be in any
sense a national system. There are
many confusions and inconsistencies
of rates. The scientific means by
which communication by such instru
mentalities can be rendered more thor
ough and satisfactory has not been
made full UBe of. .An exhaustive Btudy
of the whole question of electrical
communication and ol the means by
which the central authority of the na-1
tion can be. used to unify and im
prove it, if undertaken, by the appro
priate committees of the congress
would certainly result, Indirectly even
if not directly, in a great public
benefit.
Asks Repeal of Wine, Beer Ban
Th3 demobilization' of -the military
forceB of the country has progressed
to such a point that it seems to me en
tirely safe now to remove the ban
upon the manufacture and sale of
wines and beers, but I am advise!
that without further legislation I nav
not the legal authority to remove the
present restrictions. I therefore re
commend that the act approved No
vember 21, 1918. entitle. "An -act to
enable the secretary of agriculture to
carry out,' during the fiscal year end
ing June "0. 1919. the purposes of
the act entitled "An act to provide
further for the national security and
defense by stimulating agricuil-ure'.and
facilitating the distribution ot agricul
ture products' and for other purposes,"
be amended or repealed Insofar as it
applies to wines and beers. I biucere
ly trust that I shall very soon be at
my post In Washington again to report
upon the measures which made my
presence at the peace table apparently
imperative and to put myself at the
your Commission did not think the de
velopment of the country and the peo
ple to be served would justify the ex
penditure requested. You will find
accompanying this report a map desig
nating each of the roads to be con
structed. For convenience we have
numbered each road in the order in
which it appeared in the call.
THE CENTRALj HIGHWAY ,
It was moved, seconded and carried
that $475,000.00 be expended on a cen
tral highway from Douglas to Willcox.
Said highway designated as follows:
Commencing at the City of Douglas,
thence west along the cement high
way leading to Bisbee for a distance
of approximately- one mile, thence
north. to the El Paso and Southwest
ern railway, thence in a northerly di
rection along the west side of said
railway to the crossing at Elfrido,
thence north to the West well, thence
east to Pearce to connect with road
which is now being constructed from
Pearce to Cochise, thence east from
Cochise to Willcox along the north
side of the Southern 'Pacific Railway.

through Graham County if said North
and South road is built through Gra
ham County during the life of this
Commission. ?
in
ROAD FROM BENSON NORTH
DOWN THE SAtf P.EORO RIVER
TWENTY MILES ,
It is the belief, after careful consid
eration of your Commission that de
velopment aown iqe river aoes not
warrant the expenditure of $150,000.00
at this time. Your Commission de
cided, however, that $10,000.00 should
be expended on the road from Ben
son to Tree Alamos. Also decided
that $130,000.00 should be expended
on the road from Benson west to the
Pima County line.
IV
RAMSEY CANYON ROAD
Moved, seconded and carried that
$50,000.00 be expended, on the road
from the Junctiorit of the Hereford
Naco road to Ramsey Canyon in the
Huachuca Mountains.
V
ROAD FROM FOREST RANCH TO
GLEESON
Your Commission decided that it
would be advisable to expend $100,
000.0 In constructing a road from
Forest Station to Gleescn.
VI
ROAD FROM WEST WELLS TO
CHIRICAHUA MOUNTAINS
It is recommended that $50,000.00
be expended on road from the West
Well to the Chiricihua Mountains.
VII
ROAD FROM NEAR RODEO TO
HILLTOP
We recommend that $60,000.00 be
expended on a road from a point neat
the Arizona-New Mexico line close to
the Borderland Route at Rodeo to con
nect with Hilltop Road.
VIII
HIGHWAY BETWEEN BISBEE AND
DOUGLAS
Moved, seconded and carried that
$200,00 00 ,bfc appropriated for .the
completion of the paved highway be
tween Bisbee and Douglas.
IX
ROAD FROM GLEESON TO CEN
TRAL HIGHWAY
. Your Commission recommends that
$15,000.00 be expended on the road
from Gleeson to Central Highway, this
amount to be expended grading and
surfacing that portion running from a
point close to the Old So!diers hole
mill through the flat country to High
way. X
ROAD FROM COURTLAND TO '
CENTRAL HIGHWAY
Also recommend that $10,000.00 be
expended on road from Courtland to
the Central Highway. This amount
to be used in grading and surfacing
that 'portion which runs through the
bottom portion of the Valley.
XI
It was also decided to build a short
road from Osborn west to intersect
the Don Luis road half a mile north
of Naco .thence from Naco in a north
westerly direction to connect with the
Bisbee-Hereford road. Cost JlOjiOO.00.
This Commission, therefore,, finds
and recommends that the question' of
whether or not the bonds of Cochise
County shall be issued and sold to the
amount of $1,200,000.00 for the purpose
of 'building the aforesaid roads, should
be submitted to the qualified electors of
the county In accordance with the pro
visions ot said Chapter 31 of the Ses

Goes Over to June Meeting
On Showing Electric Co.
Is Losing Money
PHILS WIN IN GRANDSTAND FISH;
RUTH'S BAT PROVES FATAL TO BROWNS
Declaring that the Warren Electric
company is a losing proposition, that
not a man in the state would take it
for a dollar and operate it on lis pres
ent losing basis' and that "the city of
Bisbee wouldn't take the electric sys
tem as a gift," Councilman I. A. Ro
sok, representing the second ward at
last night's meeting of the city council
successfully silenced a petition pre
sented to the council by Attorney S.
K. Williams in behalf of the citizens
residing in Upper Tombstone Canyon,
who want the council to compel the
electric system to extend its tracks
to the western corporate limits of the.
city.
Attorney Williams was on hand be
fore the council went into session and
he brought to the meeting with him a
stenographer to take down notes. It
was while the last alderman took his
chair in the council chamber that Al
deman Rosok got up and threw down
the gauntlet that be had no Interest
whatsoever in the electric company,
but that he was prompted only by a
desire to do that which he believed
to be right. .
"Mr. Williams has very ably pre
sented a petition signed by a great
number of citizens," he began, "but it
behooves us as councflmen to look at
the question, from every angle and
from every side. For my part I would
be glad to see the line extended if it
was possible at this time to do so, but
there is another ide to the question.
The Warren company lost $7000 last
year in 6perating. Improvements this
year will amount to $30,000, and if
they are compelled to extend the line
to the western corporate Uimits of the
city it win entail an additional ex-r
pense of $20,000, qf which $10,000
would go for the steel rails and $10,000
for the grading, trolley and fuse sys
tem. A business that loses money
throughout the year is a liability. It
looks to me like we are in great dan-!
ger of losing our street car system. We
cannot afford to antagonize the elec
tric company today. There ,is- not a
man in the state, who would take the
railway for a dollar and lose money as
it is each year. The city of Hisbee
wouldn't take it as a gift. We can't
demand the railway to go beyond the
limits. They are now operating at a

TOM MOORE PICKS
HORACE GREELEY
ADVICE AS TITLE
A tense drama exposing the seamy
side of certain circles of society is
presented in the story of "The Iove
Auction,"i a William Fox photoplay,
which is coming to the Eagle theater
today. It is the story of a poor girl
who married a millionaire she did not
love, but whom she thought she could
be happy with and learn to love. Vir

STAR'S TRIP TO COAST INSPIRA
TION FOR NAMING PLAY
"GO WEST, YOUNG MAN"
Horace Greeley's immortal reply to
the young man who sought his advice
is used as the title of Tom Moore's
latest Goldwyn picture. Needss to
say it is "Go West, Young Man," and
the play comes to the Lyric theater
today.
Now that the injunction has been
used as the name of a photoplay,
screen enthusiasts are wondering why
it has not been employed before.
Which only goes to prove that there
is a wealth of material as yet un
touched by producers.
It is no secret that the title of the
comedy-drama, in its original form,
was not "Go West, Young Man," but
something entirely different. When
the play was produced in California,
it being the first production, by the
way, which the Irish star has made in
the Golden State, all the Goldwyn ex
ecutives realized that it ought to have
a better title .than the one given it.
But no one could suggest a line which
met with the approval of everyone
else.
After pondering on the question,
Tom Moore suggested that the players
who had supported him be called in.
Often an actor will get a new and
valuable- angle on the production he
has had a part in. So Ora Carew, the
little leading lady; Melbourne Mac
Dowell, Jack Richardson, Edward
Coxen. Hector V. Sarno and others
were asked to write their suggestions
on slips. These were collected and
submitted to J. G. Hawks, chief of
Goldwyn's Los Angeles scenario bu
reau. At the last moment Tom Moor
contributed another title.
In a few minutes Mr. Hawkes en
tered, his face showing the enthusi
asm he felt. "Why this Is the very
thing,' 'he said, "why didn't some of
us think of it before? 'Go West, Young
Man' that's bully. Whose is it?"
There was silence, each person look
ing from one to the other. Then final
ly they all looked together at one of
their number. He was blushing self
consciously. Of course it was that
most modest of stars, Tom Moore.

THERE IS A CRYING NEED FOR GREATER PETROLEUM PRODUCTION
THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND WILL CAUSE EVEN HIGHER PRIC
ES FOR REFINED PETROLEUM PRODUCTS THIS MEANS TREMEN
DOUS PROFITS FOR AMERICAN REFINERIES.
Oil Refining, even during the days of low priced gasoline and lubricants, has always
paid enormous dividends. This industry is now entering into the greatest era of its
, history. '
Now mark this statement: , Refinery stocks pay as large dividends as the SUCCESS
FUL production companies can pay and every element of gamble is eliminated
We can prove this by numerous' examples. For lac of space wequote but one:
The Ponca City Refinery, of Ponca City, Oklahoma, after paying almost fabulous
dividends, sold out and paid each stockholder $2,335.00 for every $100 invested.
And now consider that there has probably not been a well located and properly not
been a well located and properly managed refinery in the history of the indutsry but
has made remarkable earnings. .
When you invest in oil, invest in the sound,, substantial manufacturing end, where
never a dollar is lost.
; The Refining is Both the Safe and
Profitable End Of the Oil Industry
The production company, after taking the risk of drilling for oil, sells it production
for $2.50 per barrel. The refinery converts this same crude oil into refined petro
leum products at a net profit of $5 per barrel.
Here is a concrete case, taken from undisputed statistics: Out of 75,000,000 bar
rels of oil taken out of one property in Oklahoma, which is the crude oil, a leaser,
the person who owned the land in fee, re ceived $5,450,000 net from the oil, the
sub-leaser, who was the broker, received $2,400,000, and the company who devel
. oped the lease, that drilled for oil, received $13,700,000 and the PIPE LINE COM
PANY who bought the oil and refined it, received the sum of $86,250,000.
THERE IS MORE MONEY IN REFINING A BARREL OF OIL THAN IN PRO
DUCING IT
Our initial plant, of J000 barrels daily capacity, wilr be built at Fort Worth on a 51-acre site, which has
already been purchased... Here we are assured an ample supply of crude oil, 365 days in the year, deliv
ered at a minimum cost. The drawing reproduced here, shows the pipe lines leading into Fort Worth.
"TWO OF THESE LINES CROSS OUR REFINERY SITE and we are also on the Rock Island railroad.
This is the sort of investment your banker will endoree that the shrewd investors on Wall Street put
THEIR money info the sort of stock that Is found in the strong boxes of the" SUCCESSFUL men, of the
country.
The present block of $100,000 stock is now selling af par.. Get in on a ground floor basis, by sending

SEE EXHAUSTION
OF OIL SUPPLY
OF flllllCA IN
NEXT 26 YEARS
BY LEO R. SACK,
Staff Correspondent
WASHINGTON, May 15 Despite
the increase in the Nation's oil re
sources as a result of the important
discoveries in the Ranger and other
Texas oil .fields. Government oil ex
perts insist that the United States Is
facing a serious shortage in oil. So
serious Is the shortage, they say, that
unless new fields are discovered in
paying quantities the last drop of pe
troleum produced in the United
States will have been consumed bo
fore the beginning of the yeur 1945.
Twenty-six years more to go if the
present resources are not augmented.
It is rot a cheerful outlook for the
man wh wants to own and operate
his flivver twenty-six years 0 hence.
Nor is it encouraging for the. hun
dreds of thousands of industries that
are dependent upon oil and gasoline.
Because of this officials of the Bu-y
reau of Mines are watching with a.;'
great deal of real interest progress
in the development of the Texas
fields and In. other parts of the Unit
ed States. The Pacific Northwest
and Alaska are being looked to to
come to the rescue.
Use Way Be Restrained
If no new petroleum pools are
discovered In the next two years,
it Is within the realm of probability
that Congress will be asked to enact
a law prohibiting the use of, petro.
loura in boilers and furnaces for the :
generation of steam and heat. Such
a law would prove a disaster to hun
dreds of steamship companies and
would cripple some of the railroads
that use fuel oil burning engines. It
would also seriously handicap the
United States navy, as all of the lat
est model battleships are equipped
wiwth fuel oil burners.

Prospects of Payment
. Roughly put, Germany has approximately 78 billions of wealth and
they demand that she pay something like 200 "billions.
It looks like an impossibility. It is a certainty that she must have
time and such help as anxious creditors are willing to give in the spirit
of "business is business." ,
Studying history, we discover that one ot, the-Germans strongholds
in mcney-making lay in "Made in Germany," meaning that their foreign
sold goods had certain superior attraclions due to superior material and
workmanship and cheapness. But "Made in Germany" Is pretty thorough
ly accursed throughout a considerable part of the world. Will this taboo
prevail when it is solely a matter of Germany's paying her debts? Your
psychological attitude toward a fellow who?e head you are trying to
punch differs from that when you are trying to collect a bill from him.
In the view of a good part of the world, this old Teutonic trade-mark,
may come to read, "Made in Germany; proceeds to go to France and
Belgium."
History 'also is to the effect that thousands of Germany's rich
autocrats, headed by the kaiser, made heavy investments in foreign
parts, in realty, manufactures and securitiesL . Why should a Socialist
government of Germany hesitate to turn these properties over as part
payment of Germany's debt? Lord! it looks, like an especially blessed:
opportunity of Socialism. In addition, there are foreign parts, the
United States included, enemy alien Germajis possessing property In
appropriating which to pay the father land's just war debt there could be
no moral obstacle. ' '.
And recent war history testifies that Getrmany's tax rate has been
ridiculously low compared to that of Britain, France and Italy. Ger:
many sllnply bet on securing big indemnities and, in the case of Bel
gium, at least did collect them as she went along. : The rich of Ger
many, the element that profited greatly through militarism, has borne a
lower tax rate on income that has been imposed upon any of the other
belligerents, save the United States.
For The Full Sunlight of Freedom
- Language is the prime basis of understanding.
It Beems that people cannot have the) same brain cell arrange
ment and be in agreement without speaking the same language.
We get along pretty well with our neighbor, Canada; for we speak
the same language.
One reason, and perhaps the main ona. that Holland and Switzer
land get along so well with the rest of the world Is that they are both
nations ot linguists. - .
Both are small countries with commercial relations with most other
nations, and for very material reasons languages have long been made a
particular part of their public school systems.
Bank clerks, store salesmen, and even newsboys on the streets of
Holland cities will often try five languages on a foreigner before finding
his native one. : -
This is no argument for our learning all languages of the earth,
nor for the earth speaking one language, but it presents the necessity for
the use of one language here in America if we are going to get on well
together. . .
The largest, fullest, brightest ray in the full sunlight of freedom
here in America is common understanding.
The prime basis of this common understanding is one language, the
prevailing' language English. .
What Would You Wish For?
Had you one wish for all humanity what would it' be?
Perpetual peace, universal prosperity,' happiness? Or would you
have eternal youth, a world rid of disease, evil vanquished, an artistic
or industrial perfection?
This matter of endowing ,the world witha quality or condition, calls
for much deliberation and debate.
Wish you happiness for the murderer? Prosperity for the kaiser and
his kin? Eternal youth when the limit of life's span" is what makes
existence precious?
One wish is a momentous thing to contemplate. We all may have
granted to us at least one big personal wish, if it be based on sincere
-desire. ' ' v
That which you wish for earnestly enough you will strive for dili
gently enough to Becure. Individual success is but a wish materialized.
But to venture a single wish for all humanity fs an assumption of
responsibility by one being for the destiny and life conduct of all others.
An Eskimo would wish for warmth, a Hottentot would welcome ice.
Are we not all Eskimos and Hottentots in our narrow spheres of prefer
ence, prejudice and provinciality? Yet could you wish what would you
wish for all humanity?
. . Ludendorff told a reporter for the London Chronicle that the United
States could go to hell. If this is an invitation to a house-warming,
wouldn't it be well to wait until the kaiser Is there to receive?
It's an awful dose, Heine, but the directions say take it.
The Hun's colonies were not taken by the allies, as he alleges,
but were taken by the league, which is a new corporation controlled by
the allies. .
Giving Italy a half million Slavs and half as many Germans guar

Here and there in Arizona
TUCSOiT. May 20 Title to the
land on which the city of Tucson is
built, is involved in a suit filed in the
probate court of Los Angeles county
Thursday, May 15, by Fanny F. and
John T. Cuppy, of Phoenix, petition
ing for the removal of Virginia I. Hun
ter as executrix of the estate of Col.
Robert F. Hunter, attorney and expert
upon Indian affairs, who died in 1912.
The land in question consists of mil
lions in acres in southern Arizona
including a large part of the coun
ties of Pima. Pinal and Maricopa,
and was acquired by Colonel Hunter
in 1880.
In his will the colonel refers to a
contract with one R. M. Martin, under
the terms of which Martin who had
an option to purchase a portion of the
tract for 1250,000, was to finance the
litigation looking toward the clearing
of the trial. This is still involved in
a suit now pending in the United
State supreme court.
In this action, it is claimed that
the Papago Indians are wards of the
government and hold title to the
land.
Colonel Hunter, who appointed his
wife, since deceased, and his daugh
ter, Virginia, executors, instructed
them not to record the blanket deed
to the great tract of Arizona lands
unless there was a dispute between
the government and the Indians con
cerning the boundaries of Pneblos.
Then it was only to be used as an
instrument to settle the dispute.
Fanny F. and John E. Cuppy,
brother-in-law and sister of the ex
ecutrix Miss Butler, are dissatisfied
at the long delay in receiving any
benefit from the estate. They claim
that by not recording the deeds, all
the heirs are made to suffer heavy
loss, a3 squatters are settling upon
the land in question. .
Judge Rives, of the Los Angeles
probate court, denied the petition of
theCuppy3 and transferred the fight
to the Arizona courts. The contest
ants, it is reported, have stated that
they will continue he fight in the
courts of this state for the removal
of Mjss Hunter" as executrix and the
appointment of her sister, Mrs. Cup
py, in her stead.
Hies and all operators of motor ve
hicles engaged in passenger, freight
and express service, has been called

Thursday, May 22, at 10 o'clock, in
a general circular letter issued re
cently by the commission for the pur
pose of formulating rules of practice
and procedure governing the issuance
of certificates to all motor vehicle
owners, and to consider the enforce
ment of senate bill No. 60, which goes
into effect on June 9.
PLAN RECLAMATION PROJECT
PHOENIX, May 20. A big reclama
tion and power project, of the greatest
importance to part of Arizona and Ne
vada, is being worked out in the north
west corner ot the state, according
to Charles R. Howe of the tax commis
sion, who has just returned from that
section.
According to the story, the pan lis to
dam, the Colorado in the vicinity of
Jones Ferry, below the mouth of the
Virgin river, and back the water up
the Colorado nearly to the site of the
proposed bridge, and up the Virgin
nearly to Littlefield.
The method proposed to dam the
river is novel in the extreme. It is;
proposed to make the dam at a point
where the river is quite narrow and
runs between two mountains of rock,
these to be mined and filled with ex
plosives,, and Bet off simultaneously,
thus shooting both mountains down
into the river. The silt will be de
pended upon to fill the chinks, and the
top finished with a regular concrete
filL .
Some engineers think the scheme la
pratcical and others do not agree, but
at any event it is said that Gillette,
the "razor king," has been interested
in the project and is backing it.

was advised by Judge Gilbert that he
was just about to ask Judge Saw
telle to do the same thing In another
district.
PLAN RESERVOIR CONSTRUCTION
CASA GRANDE, May 20. Herbert I
V. Clotts, supervising engineer of the I
United States Indian service in Los j
Angeles .has issued notice that he !
will receive bids, up to noon June
5, for the construction o fa diver
sion dam and bridge of reinforced
concrete, to be a part of a big rec
lamation project of the government,
involving thousands of acres of land
in the Gila river valley, Arizona.
Bids for thi3 work were advertised
for some months ago, but there
were no bidders. That wa3 during
the period of shortage of labor, and
it is believed that with the close of
the war thi3 , condition no longer
exists. '
The dam and bridge will be locat
ed about three miles east of Saca
ton. The work calls for approxi
mately 31,700 cubic yards of earth
work ; 17,400 yards of concrete;
738,500 pounds of reinforcing steel;
12.400 feet of round piling and IS
steel gates with operating machin-erq.
STATE FILES WATER SUIT
PHOENIX, May 20. One hundred
and twenty-four defendants are named
in the suit filed at the instance of the
attorney general last Saturday in the
superior court of Maricopa county in
volving adjudication of priority or
water rights in' the Gila river to 160
cres of prison farms in Floren own
ed by the state.
The state bases its claim for prio-
Ity of water rights in the Gila river
from the prior rights of the former
owner and occupant of the said lands
of whjch the state is now the owner
by mesne .conveyances, and alleges
that the former owner diverted the
water from the Gila river and carried
it by proper and cenvenient canals
and ditches upon the lands now own
ed by the state, thus establishing its
prior rights by lapse of time. ;The
state seeks to obtain from the court
a decree edjudicating in the state all
prior and first water rights in the
Gila river.
LAUNDRY FOR CASA GRANDE
CASA GRANDE, May 20 W. R.
Scott has purchased a lot from Mrs,
Meehan, adjoining the Palms hotel on
the west, and will shortly erect a
structure which is to house a modern
laundry and clothing and hat cleaning
machinery. A good laundry capable of
taking care of the business of this
city and tributary territory has been a
great need for some time.
11. S, CIRCUIT COURT
FREES TUCSON MAN
SAN FRANCISCO, May 20. Convic-
Ion last year of August Sandberg,
consulting metallurgist at Tucson, on
alleged violation of the espionage act,
has been reversed here by the United
States circuit court of appeals, and the
sentence of two years' imprisonment
and fine of $500 ordered nullified. The
decision held that remarks made by
Sandberg, upon which he was convict
ed, were expressions of personal opin
ion and directed to single individuals,
therefore not within the scope of the
espionage act.

"HIGH GRADERS" ARRESTED
PATAGONIA, May 20. Nine Mex
icans employed at the Tres de Mayo
mine were arrested last week by Uni
ted States soldiers and placed in jail
at Nogales on a charge of stealing ore
from the property. It is also claimed
the men had a large quantity of arms
and ammunition in their possession
and had exhibited revolutionary ten
dencies.
The allies will permit no discussion o ftheir right on the terms
of the peace treaty, the Hun having long since agreed to the principle that
might establishes whatever right is needed.
Germany has submitted her plan for a league of nations. Jler- first
choice of plans was submitted in 1914.
i . . Brockdorff-Rantzau stood at tlje peace congress "because he was
master of his voice, but not of his legs." He had perfect mastery over
his gall.
The Hun maintains that the peace terms do not offer a peace of
right. We maintain that the Hun is not a competent judge of right.
The special session of congress will be able to attend to its work as
soon as it gets through expressing its opinion of the peace treaty.
The treaty allows Germany six capital ships for her navy, but
doesn't say where she 'shall hide them during the next war.
The Japs and Chinese are sore about the Kiao Chau settlement, and
now If the Hun will complain there will be no further question about its
fairness.
The powers don't recognize the existence of an orderly government
in Mexico, but they recognize the existence of oil fields and mines
down there.

NEW HEAD AT NORMAL
FLAGSTAFF, May 20. The board
of education of the Northern Arizona
Normal school held an important
J meeting Saturday afternoon, all mem
bers being present which included C.
O. Case, superintendent of public in
struction, M. I. Powers, secretary, and
J. C. Dolan, member.
The present president of the school.
G. E. Cornelius, handed in his resig
nation to take effect June 15, Mr.
Cornelius having other important
plans for his immediate future.
The newly elected president, Dr. J.
O. Creager, was selected from a large
number of promising applications re
ceived by the board from many states
in the union, with very high creden
tials. The board feels that their ef
forts in selecting a man to head the
normal ' school have been amply re
warded by the testimonials received
from many sources in reference to
Dr. Creager. 'He is a ; graduate of
Yale university with honors," a post
graduate of Harvard ,with a course ot
education In Chicago university and
has spent two years in traveling in
England, France and Germany, study
ing systems of training teachers.
NEWMAN GOES TO PRISON .
PHOENIX, May 20. J. D. Newman,
.convicted, recently of manslaughter in
Judge Stanford's division of the su
perior court, was this morning sen
tenced to a term of from 9 to 10
years in the state prison at Florence.
Newman pleaded not guilty to a
charge of murder .admitting he had
killed Frank Hoctor, but claimed self
defense. The jury stood at the first
ballot 10 for conviction on the mur
der charge, remained out -18 hours,
casting 17 ballots, compromising on
a manslaughter charge in ortler to
avert a hung jury which would have
liberated Newman, if the usual pre;
cedent had been followed.
Judge Stanford this morning called
the Newman case and asked Newman
to stand for sentence. "Have you
anything to say, Newman?" asked
Judge Stanford. Newman ansHvered:
"Nothing your honor, only I hold no
resentment against any living soul."

WOULD CURB WILDCATS '
PHOENIX, .May 20. Following
the action of the corporation com
mission in adopting a policy of favor
ing Arizona corporations over Texas
oil promoters acting under trust
agreements, an urgent demand has
been' made ' "by 'Governor Campbell
to still further curb wildcatting,
To this end he has written a letter
to the commissioners, enclosing
herewith copies of telegrams re
ceived from Tucson brokerage con
cerns, asking that they be protected
against unscrupulous operators.
The state law requires that all
brokerage concerns shall take out a
state permit, and it is expected that
the commission will take decisive ac
tion to see that the law is rigidly ad
hered to. Owing to the absence ot
the commission from the city no pol
Icy in this respect has been an
nounced.

TINUES TO USE TANLAC IN
PRACTICE WITH SUR
PRISING RESULTS
One o fthe strongst and most con
vincing evidences of the remarkable
results being accomplished by Tanlac
throughout the south is the large num
ber of letters that are now being re
ceived daily from scores of well
known women who have been bene
fited by its use.
Among the large number that have
been received recently none are more
interesting than the following letter
from Dr. J. T. Edwards, of Fayette
vllle, Ga. Dr. Edwards, it will be re
membered, recently gave Tanlac his
unqualified indorsement in a public
statement, and the testimonial pub
lished below was recently given him
by one of his patients. His letter fol
lows just as it was written:
Fayetteville, Ga.
Mr. G. F. . Willis,
Atlanta, Ga.
Dear Sir:
I am enclosing you herewith state
ment I have just received from Mr.
T. M. McGough. He has sold out her,
and is moving to Turin, Ga. He was
here this morning, and came in to tell
me what Tanlac had done for him. He
says too much cannot be said about
Tanlac. It certainly has cured him.
Respectfully,
J. T. EDWARDS, M. D.
Mr. McGough's statement follows:
"I suffered from indigestion and
could not eat anything but what would
hurt) me. Constipation gave me a
great deal of trouble also. My symp
toms were indigestion, heartburn, and
gas on the stomach after eating. My
appetite was irregular and my food
failed to nourish me. This trouble
caused me to get very poor in fact
I got so thin and weak I was hardly
able to go about.
"I bought three, bottles of Tanlac
on Dr. Edwards' recommendation, and
I am now feeling all right cgain, and
am able to attend to business. I
gained 17 pounds in weight and am
doing fine. Tanlac did the work.
"I now recommend Tanlae to every
one who is sick like I was, and wishes
to take something that will help
them."

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, May 20. Dealings in
stocks during the early period of to-
day's session were relatively dull with
uncertain price tendencies, but the en
tire market strengthened later, fresh
buying being stimulated by the presi
dent's message to congress.
The document exceeded the most
sanguine expectations of conserva
tive interests as well as the specula
tive element .especially the recommen
dations dealing with the early restor
ation of the railroads and utilities to
private ownership.
Other feature which met with equal
ly favorable interpretation included
the suggestion for a partial repeal of
wartime prohibition, withdrawal of the
tax on retail sales and protection by
tariff of chemical industries.
Shippings and oils provided the .mo
tive power at the opening. Marine
common and preferred, American In
ternational, Royal Dutch and Mexican
Petroleum gaining ne to two points,
with several of the standard rails.
Marines soon reacted on unfounded
rumors reporting delay in the con
summation of the deal with British
interests and oils and rails fell back
1 to 3 points, the reserval suggesting
bear pressure rather than profit tak
ing. In the broader movement of the final
hour converged around minor rails, es
pecially Texas and Pacific, motor spe
cialties, such utilities as Philadelphia
company and Ohio Cities, Gas- (the lat
ter rising about & points) and minor
metals; notably United' Alloy Steel,
that stock advancing 2 points.
Tjnoted States Steel also made its
best price" of 103 later, but the mod
erate improvement was cancelled de
spite the. higher - level reached by
equipments, notably American and
Baldwin Locomotives. Sales amount
ed to 1,325,000 shares.
The general bond market was firm.
Liberty and international issues, par
ticularly French municipals, showing
strength. Total sales, par value,
were $13,775,000. Old United States
bonds were unchanged on call.
THE jRAIN MARKETS
CHICAGO, May 20. New strength
which deleveloped in the corn market.
today was ascribed largely to re-estab-
lishment of a 200,000 bushels limit on
individual trades.. . Tere was a ner-
vous close, 26c to 3c net higher,
with July $1.64 to $1.64 and Sep-
tember $1.58 to $1.58. Oats finish-
ed 11 to 2 cents up and pro -
visions at gains of 15c to $1.10.
According to current gossip, eastern
speculators who have-been active on
the bear side of the corn market ere
the ones chiefly affected by the ban
against unrestricted trading. How-
ever, this might be, it was covering by
shorts which seemed almost wholly
instrumental in today's advance. Wet
weather . and dwindling receipts.
though, furnished ample motive for a
j more bullish view of conditions than
! has recently been the case. Only 40
j cars of corn arrived in Chicago this
j morning, barely sufficient for local re-
! quirements. Another bullish feature
was the 26 to 5 cent advance in barley
the effect of "presidential recommen-
dation that war time prohibition on
beer be removed.
Oats were lifted by export demand
and by the strength of barley and corn.
Provisions rose despite considerable
weakness in the hog market The
upward swing of grain gave impetus
to the advance
THE COTTON MARKET
w iukk, May 20. Cotton clos-
ed at 28.30 with the general list clos-
ing very steady at a net advance of 85
to 93 points.
THE METAL MARKET
NEW YORK, May 20. Lead steady;
spot ?o.lo; July $5.S55.50. j
Spelter, firm; spot East St. Louis:
ueiivery, $6.15; July $6.376.50.
Bar silver, $1.08.

PHOENIX, May 19. J. D. Newtnu
of Flagstaff, convicted a week ago of
manslaughter in connection with the
shooting of Frank Hoctor near Hot
Springs Junction, January 30 last, to
day was sentenced by Judge Stanford
to a term of from nine to ten years
in the state prison at Florence. New
man had pleaded not guilty to a
charge of murder, admitting he had
killed Hoctor, but contending that
he shot in self defense.
Evidence introduced in the trial
tended to show that there had been
differences between the two men over
a sheep deal, both being prominent

At last night's meeting of the coun

of "revoking licenses of incompetent

for him to file a complaint with, the

in order to assist the chief in weed
