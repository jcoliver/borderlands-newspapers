FOCH PLAN FOR ADVANCE ON GLIM
V,
PARIS, June 2a (By the . Associated Press) The supreme ocuncil
confirmed today the plans made by the military authorities for a resump
tion of the advance into Germany in the event of the refusal of the Ger
mans to sign the peace treaty within the allotted time.
Marshal Foch, Major General Bliss, General Robertson of the British
army, and other military chiefs were before the council this afternoon
and explained the details of the allied plans. The reports of the fall of
the Schiedemann government had not reached the council when, these
plans were discussed.
It is not expected the order for the allied armies to advance will be
given exactly at the time of the expiration of the time limit of the ar
mistice, but it was indicated today that there would be little defcy, if any,
in the maneuvers.
Baron Sonnlno was not present at the meeting of the council, but the
fact that General Cavalerro was called in was regarded as indicating
that the allies still regard Italy's position as not materially changed by
the overthrow of the Orlando government.

TRACED TO REDS
Confronted With Proof By
Govt., Union Leaders To
Call Off Strike
WINNIGEG, June 20. After strik

day they were considering calling off
the general strike, since six of their
imprisoned leaders were released to
day, provincial and federal officials
united In presenting 1 to them evi
dences of Bolshevism which they said
had beeu traced to members of the
central strike committee.

Commissioner V. H. Perry of the
Royal Northwest Mounted Police and
Crown Prosecutor A. J. Andrews met
five union leaders and showed them
letter's seized in. Tuesday's raid on the

Three of the letters made public
were said by government officials to
be to and by R. B. Russell, who has
been considered one of the chief fig
ures in the strike committee, and who
before the city council openly avowed
himself dissatisfied with the present
government.
"I just got in a shipment of Bolshe

man whose name was withheld. "We

SENSATIONAL RACE
Victor In Four-Mile Classic
With Harvard By Scant
Half a Length
REGATTA COURSE, NEW LON
LON. Conn., June 20. Rowing an ad
mirably timed race, Yale defeated
Harvard In the four mile 'varsity
event on the Thames today by a scant
half length of open water after one
of the bitterest struggles ever staged
on this historic waterway. For more
than a mile and a half the craft raced
side by side so closely aligned that
the official timers could not detect a
fraction of a second difference at the
various half mile flags.
It was not until the two milo posts
were reached that the Blue blades
could drive the bow of their shell
even a few feet ahead of that of the
Crimson. The Cambridge crew made
a desperate attempt to turn defeat
into victory half a mile from the fin
ish and for a moment nicked un a
trifle of the distance, but Yale answ
ered with a spurt which slowly drew
them aw,ay as the Crimson oarsmen,
exhausted by their efforts, rolled on
their slides and slowly lost headway
with the finish posts within their
reach.
The regatta was the first since 1916
and the victory breaks the tie which
has existed since the last race when
Harvard won her 25th big race in the
series of inter-varity contests which
date back Into the early fifties.
Although rowed amost two hours
after the original starting time, the
race was conducted under ideal condi
tions, from the standpoint of the oars
men. , It was close to 8 o'clock when the
crews were ordered to the line by the
referee. At the start Harvard caught
the water first and elapsed into a
slight lead, but before a quarter mile
had been rowed the shells were align
ed, not to be separated until near the
two mile mark. Yale started with a
34 stroke and Harvard was two beats
lower. ' i
At the-three-mile -flags - Yale had
fully a half shell length lead, but
when Harvard spurted this was cut
down temporarily to a few feet, but
the strain coming at the end of such
a driving race was too great for Ihe
Crimson crew to sustain and in the
final quarter mile the signs of . ex
haustion were plainly visible from the
observation trains;
The official time of the rare was:
Yale, 21:42 1-5; Harvard, 21:47 2-5.

Catholic Nations Could Put
Protestant Under Sway Of
Pope, Says Sen. Sherman
Such Inference 'Monstrous,'
Declares ien. Ashurst Of
Arizona In Warm Reply
' 1 i
WASHINGTON, June 20. While
the senate Was threshing over issues
of the League of Nations controversy
today in four hours of running debate,
league opponents started a reyival of
sentiment for some definite action on
the subject.
The debate, wheh several tmes ran
Into bitter passages, turned up a new
issue when it was charged that the
league would have a majority of Ro
man Catholic members who might be
influenced to bring the Protestant
world under the domination of the
Vatican.'
The discussidn outside the senate
chamber regarding the course of
league opponents developed consider
able difference of opinion among the
leaders and failed to produce any def
inite plans of action.
In these discussions Elihu Root,
former secretary of state, was a cen
tral figure, talking over the situation
with Senator Knox, Republican, Penn
sylvania, and other opposition lead
ers. Tonight Chairman Lodge of the
foreign relations committee, returned
to the capital to take part in the con
ference. Some senators thought the opposi
tion would bring the plan to the point
of action tomorrow so the senate
could go on record before tbje peace
negotiations end at Versailles, Mon
day. The more general prediction,
however, was that the subject would
go over into next week.
It was Senator Sherman, Republi
can of Illinois, who introduced the
religious feature. Recalling the tra
ditional papal claims to temporal pow
er, he warned that the 24 delegates
representing Catholic nations in the
league assembly would hold in their
hand3 a dangerous power to reunite
church and state.
Senator Ashurst, Democrat. Ari
zona, replied, declaring the inferences-
drawn were "monstrous" and would
not be taken seriously by any sens-1
ible man. Senator Sheppard, Demo
crat, Texas, eulogized the League of
Nations as offering the "firmest bar
rier against war humanity has yet
known."
Consideration of opposition plans
centered during the day a round Sen
ator Knox's resolution by which the
senate would ask that it be permitted I
to pass on the peace terms without
accepting or rejecting for the pres-'
ent the Leagu of Nations. At first
it had been hoped to get action on
this proposal before Monday, but the
best its supporters now believe pos-1
sible is a test vote.
JURY TRYING GIRL FOR
THEFT FAILS TO AGREE
PHOENIX, June 20. The jury in
the trial of Mrs. Nina Wagner, accus
ed of the theft of $2700 in cash and
liberty bonds from W. D. Thornton,
disagreed tonight and was discharg
ed. The state asked that the case
be reset, but the request was not
granted. Mrs. Wagner was committed
to the Crittenden home.
The complaining witness in Mrs.
Wagner's trial was Thornton, who
accompanied her here from Oklaho
ma, and who is now serving a six
months term for an infraction of the
Mann act.
When the court had reassembled
after an adjournment today there
were no counsel for either side pres
ent, although It had been understood
that two more witnesses were to be
heard. After a brief wait. Judge
Stanford read the instruction to the
jury and they retired for their delib

RED CROSS AIDING
NIKSICH. Montenegro, via" .Paris,
May 20. (By Mall) Montenegro is
in a pitiable state. The inhabitants
are destitute. Dwellings are burned
or smashed by shellfire. The young
men are gone. There are no tools to
work with, no seeds to plant. The
city dwellers have no iivlihood. Each
day the American ' Red Cross gives
everyone a kilo of; bread, of two
quarts of thick; meaty soup. Ameri
can nurses visit the sick from sunup
to sundown, each nurse attending to
about fifty sick persons daily.
Before the war most of the cloth
ing worn by the Montenegrins was
made by the women at home, either
of linen or wool.' Only a small num
ber of officials and tradesmen used
Imported . cloth. During the war no
clothing was made and now the home
supply is cut off because there is not
enough labor to produce food and no
one can spare time for spinning or
weaving.
As a result Montenegrin men, wo
men and children are clothed in bur
lap sacking. There is not enough
sacking to go around and the moun
taineers huddle in their huts during
inclement weather. When one of
their number, generally a child, is
sent after the Red Cross rations be
or she is supplied by making a round
Robin collection with sufficient sack
ing to keep warm during the journey
to the relief station.
Malaria and tuberculosis are con
mon and the children suffer much
from the itch, due fo the general
filthiness of conditions in the moun
tains and mountain towns. In the
former residence of Prince Mirko,
son of King 'Nicholas, near Podgorit
sa, American doctors and nurses
maintain a fifty bed hospital and
treat daily about eighty patients. The
surgeons' principal work has to do
with bullet wounds.
At Danilorgrad the Red Cross main
tains a dispensary. Here in Niksich
the Red Cross feeds twelve hundred
persons in its soup kitchen, making
no distinction between royalists and
those who favor the Jugo-Slav state.
The Red Cross also cares for three
hundred people housed in the six
rooms of the local "poor house
whose condition is most wretched.
At Cettinje the Red Cross feeds
three hundred people dally in its soup
kitchens and maintains a hospital.
Owing to the hostility to foreigners
shown by Montenegrins almost the
only foreign element found in the
interior towns are American soldiers
and officers and workers in American
Red Cross uniforms. The American
army trucks and ambulances are driv
en by chauffeurs largely drawn from
the ambulance service in France.

The Ranger Field the
Greatest in Oil History
California had her "Forty Nine," Alaska her "Gold Rush," Beau
mont "Spindle Top," and Burkrurnett her "Fowler Well," but
all these pale into insignificance when compared with the great
pools of oil being opened up in the Ranger field
Nowhere else in the United States can you find such wells as the
Norwood, the Roper, the Connellee, and the Perkins, which are daily
pouring out a wealth amounting to hundreds of thousands of dol
lars to their owners. The Norwood well alone yielded to its owners
$372,000 during the first fifteen days after it came in. The oil is of
a very high grade and brings to its owners from $2.25 to $2.40 per
barrel.
It is in the Ranger field that the great companies are bending their
efforts to develop their tremendous holdings.
It is in the Raager and Eastland district that the great pipe lines
are being built, immense refineries going up and miles upon miles
of trackage being built by the railroads. '
It is in the Ranger field that the great fortunes; in oil are yet to be
made, and toward the Ranger field that the real oil men are turn
ing their attention.

We Expect a 10,000 Barrel
Well on Our Woods Tract
'. v .
This lease is located less than half a mile from the Perkins well,
which was drilled in last week with an initial production of 10,000. -
Just to the Southwest of us, less than one-half mile is the Poteet
well."- Unfortunately this well has sustained a serious setback and
hay have to be abandoned, but the showing in the limestone just
above the sand would .indicate beyond any question that the Poteet
well would have leen even larger than the Perkins.
Our derrick is up and preparations are .being made -to begin, drilling
this .week on' this lease. As stated above we confidently expect a
well! ranging from 5,000 to 10,000 barrels per day. This, would
mean increase for our company of. from $10,000 to $20,000 each day,
or $3,000,000 to $7,000,000 per year. Remember our locations are
the choicest in the Ranger field and entirely, surrounded by produc

Window
The merchants' show windows these days form the down-town
streets of these cities into a veritable museum of useful crafts and dec
rative arts.
This is almost as true in the small cities as the great ones.
These show windows are a never-ending source of interest.
They are a day-to-day display of human progress. There is hardly
a material, device or new way of doing things brought out in any de
partment of life that does not at once find exhibition in the merchant's
show window.
Thousands of persons, old and young, see these displays far more
and of more different classes than attend any museum or exposition, and
with far more educational effect.
And there is more thought given to the average show window than
the display in any museum or exposition. v . -
Their arrangements in form and color, together with their lighting
indicate high artibtic skill and judgment, and window display has be
come ciib cf the nits 01 modern times. , ' "
If the facts were only known, these window displays are a very
large factor in a better way of life and living in every community.
They are a device of true reform more so than many of those in
tended only for reform.
In dissatisfaction there is progress.
. Many of us go past these windows, and we become dissatisfied with
our clothing, the furniture that we have at home, or the general lack of
those things which are upon display. j
Inthis dissatisfaction there is often the first elements of possession.
We put forth moer effort, it bring out the latent powers within us,
our ambition is fired to do more, earn more and in order to have more
of the good things of life displayed in these Bhow windows.
Standards of living are raised by these wonderful and beautiful
things, and a higher standard of living is true progress and prosperity.
Environment is as large a factor as education in making us a better,
more efficient people.
Environment is in itself education, for as we gradually surround our
selves with the more efficient and beautiful things of life, and which
we may have purchased through the suggestion of these window displays,
we are unconsciuosly made better and more efficient by our association
with them.
The merchant who by his window display, or who otherwise induces
people to eat better food, wear better clothing, have better furniture in
their homes, is unconneiusly making better people and is working with
the school, the church, the library for a better community surely,
certain.
Show window displays in these cities are direct evidence, beyond
the question of a doubt, that the world is getting better.
The Important Book Reviews
Seems as how the periodicals leave out the most important book
reviews. Novels and histories and books of poetry and all those are
reviewed at length, but how about reviews of dad's bank book and
mother's cook book and others along that line They're the most im
portant books of all, take it from the full assemblage of the family in
council convened.
Just to supply the deficiency here are some of the book reviews
the members of the family would like to see every week or so:
DAD'S BANK BOOK This book i3 filled with interesting reading
in the first few pages and the blank pages in the back of the volume
pique the iuterest end arouse the curiosity as to just what will be in
dited here. Book is statistical in character with the last figures given
not being a3 impressive as those first appearing in the book. Persons
accomplished in reading between the lines can read "summer vacation"
and "summer clothes" for the entire family into the last figures shown.
MOTHER'S COOK BOOK Heavy looking volume, jammed with
the best sort of reading. To have mother read aloud from this book
while hitting it up between stove and pantry in the kitchen, is to get
one of THE real sensation of the Eummer book season., It is interest
ing to know that mother manages to gut more out of a perusal of this
book than anyone else.
SISTER'S POCKETBOOK As thin as the airiest romance 'ever
penned. No one ever takes this book seriously. An interesting hodge
podge of odds and ends, samples of various moods, etc. Everyone is
defied to ifind anything of any real value in this volume.
White Elephants
The King of Siam in years gone by, would send a White Elephant
to a courtier whom he disliked .and whose fortune he wished to destroy.
The man could not sell the elephant and the expense of keeping it even
tually "broke him up."
From that custom was handed down our present day saying, "he's
got a white elephant on his hands."
The biggest and most expensive white elephant in the world at
present is the "Grouch." It is the surest animal known to man for de
stroying both fame and fortune.
Fortunatly this White Elephant cannot be wished on you by either
friend or foe. It can be aggravated once you have obtained it, but first
it must be acquired by YOU and you only.
Tears or promise of tears that precede a grouch are splendid for the
stage or the movie, but we could do without them forever in real life.
More friendships and love affairs have been washed away with tears
than by any other agency.
Avoid tears which lead to self pity that in turn becomes a grouch
chronic or otherwise.
It may be that the great American
sounds so much like umpire.
If the wire operators were compelled to strike "because of the
tactics of JJurleson," why continue the strike after Burleson passed the
buck?
All this propaganda to the effect that labor is demanding its booze
leaves the. impression that the dry crowd consists of our well-to-do loaf
ing class.
Raiitzau is convinced that the peace terms will lead to another
war. There isn't anybody fliat Germany can lick now, except Siam and
Haiti ,and v.ho will lend her ships to get at these?
A cable from Brussels informs
to supply tourists, and that alcohol
a mighty clever bid for American to
,i -, Our solemn senators will be able to decide the fate of the peace
. treaty, if; they don't run'out of personal 'epithets. . . ' ' i
, t ' ' ,U ' : ''.
Just when we are about ready ;to believe that people are growing
wiser every day. vp run across seine fellow who argues that Germany
will not re-establish her .commercial spy system.
When a controversy can't be settled without a resort to violence, one
side or the other i unwilling to have p-ac if it must be obtain at the
price of doing the decent thing.

BOYSCOUT CAMPAIGN
SUCCESS, IS M'ADOO'S
' MESSAGE TO ARIZONA
- PRESCOTT. Ariz., June 20.r-TUe
following statement from W. G. Mc
Adoo, national chairman of the Boy
Scouts, was received here today . by
T. G. Norris, State chairman for Ari
zona: "In all its essentials the Boy Scout
! campaign was a great success. I am
jconlident the one million assocfate
l members we set out to secure will
! be obtained. It is impossible at thl3
' moment to give the figures, because
returns from country districts have
not yet been received. In some com
munities it is found desirable to con
tinue the campaign this week, while
others report oversubscriptions.
"Full returns have not been receiv
ed from the five boroughs of New York
City, but I feel confident that as a
result of Boy Scout Week New York
will raise her quota of associate mem
berships.
"Besides the memberships and
money which were the immediate ob
jectives, the Boy Scouts campaign has
been of tremendous benefit in fa
miliarizing the country with the pur
pose, of this fine organization for
making the best kind of citizens out
of the boyhood of the country.
"In behalf of the officers of the
Boy Scouts of America and in behalf
of all the boys of America who will
be benefited by this great movement,
I desire to thank all those who con
tributed so generously and who have
worked so unselfishly for its success."
YUMA-PHOENIX ROAD
IS CAUSE OF DISPUTE
PHOENIX, June 20. "Everything
will be done towards getting the Phoe-nix-Yuma
road built that can be done
consistently with the rights and inter
ests of other portions of the state,"
said Governor Campbell tonight, with
reference to the conferences which
were held here yesterday on the sub
ject f a Phoenix-Yuma-San Diego
highway.
"To give Yuma county what it asks
for would be unfair to the rest of the
state," was the opinion of State Engi
neer Maddock, who continued: "Yuma
contributes $20,000 to the state fund
per year, yet the people of that coun
ty want nearly a million dollars spent
there. The proposal made yesterday
by the Yuma delegation was to put up
for this highway out of a projected
bond issue of only 15 per cent of the
estimated cost of the road. On the
through highway Yuma desires to
spend $150,000 and obtain from the
state and federal aid funds about $700,
000. It cannot be done."

GETS BACKING OF
ATLANTIC CITY. N, J., Juno 20.
Organized labor today endorsed tho
League of Nations covenant and the
labor provisions it contains which, ac
cording to a cable message from
President Wilson, have been weaken
ed, although not materially.
In giving its approval by -i vote of
29,750 agaiust 420, the reconstruction
convention of the American Federa
tion of Labor made it clear that
"nothing in the endorsement can be
construed as denying the right of self
determination and freedom to Ireland
as recognized by this convention." An
amendment containing the Irish pro
vision was adopted unanimously.
The president's cable in reply to
one sent him by Samuel Gompers,
president of the federation, asking in
formation about changes reported in
press dispatches, follows:
President Cablet Gompers
"Your message came while I was in
Belgium aid reached me too late to
make full reply, but, as I indicated in
an earlier message, while tho labor
provisions are somewhat weakened, it
is the opinion of friends of labor and
my oyu opinion that they are not ma
terially weakened and that they will
constitute a most serviceable Magna
Charta. Will cable labor provisions
but fear it will bo too late for the con
ventio 1."
Mr. Gompers' message to the presi
dent said in part:
"Upon my advice tho executive
council of the American Federation
of Labor has recommended to the con
vention now in session the endorse
ment of the League of Nations, in
cluding the labor provisions. Reports
published here iiidieate that the labor
provisions have been so changed and
weakened as to practically nullify
their effectiveness."

There's a new thing under the sun in
the house of representatives a con

trying ' to convert people, to Chris
tianity a la Billy Sunday.
He is Will D. Upsbaw of Atlanta,
Ga., a cripple since boyhood. He is
now holding revival services in a
Washington church.
Here are some of the pulpit sayings
of Congressman Upshaw:
Mcral neutrality is an abomination
in the sight of God and meq.

gathered by the consulate, was in jail
here when Villa attacked. Apparently
some of the prisoners were freed by
Villa followers and McLaren wa3
standing outside the jail door when a
bullet struck him, inflicting a fatal
wound. The body was burisd in a local
cemetery.
Military men here today expresseu
belief that several bombing planes
brought north to Chihuahua City by
General Manuel Dieguez for use
against Villa will prove very effec
tive. These planes are flying daily
there, it was learned and are expect
ed soon to be sent north.
The body of Alberto Jiminez. a
Villa general killed in the fighting
about this city last Saturday or Sun
day, wa3 brought in today from the
field where it was found.
How a difference with his leader,
Villa, probably saved the life of Epi
fanio Holguin came to light today
with a report to Mexican officials that
Holguia had demanded the surrender
of Las Palomas, a small town opposite
Columbus, N. M.
It appears that Holguin with a fcrce
of about 60 men, was sent by Villa
to cut a railroad line running into
Juarez, but instead of going himself
to do this, sent a detachment of his
command. The detachment was fired
upon by Mexican federals and some
of its'horseB killed, the men retiring.
Holguin, according to reports here,
did not wish to return to Villa's
camp, and Villa removed him from
command of the force he had been
leading. This command was given to
Colonel Barros, and in leading it in
the fighting in Juarez, he was killed.
Holguin's demand for the surrender
of Las Palomas today gave the first
definite knowledge here as to his
whereabouts since that time.
The command of the few fiscal
guards at Las Palomas, its sole de
fense, sent word to Holguin that if he
wanted their stronghold, the custom
house, he would have to come in and
take it, according to a report received
here. It is not known what force Hol
guin has at his command.

A letter was received yesterday
stating that Nick Gundy of El Peso
would be in Miami about the 22nd of
June with Arthur Holmgren and as
Mrs. Gunday lives in Bisbee he
thought he -would be here either be
fore or after the Miami visit. He
was in New Mexico last week and
put up a fight there on the ISth so
he is evidently going just as strong
as ever and the local promoters are
trying to arrange a match of about 10
rounds at Hyland Park for some date
next week. Gundy is well known in
Bisbee and as a fighter his record
is a byword with the local fans.
A telegram was received yester
day from Chas. Weller, who was well
known around Bisbee, to the effect
that he had been quite ill in Kansas
City and is not expected to live.

BY REVIEW
STOCKS AND BONDS
NEW YORK, June 20 So far as to
day's stock market could be- said to
have any direct propelling force or
definite factor, greater interest was
evinced in the trend of events across
the water than in domestic develop
ments. Reports of the resignation of the
German cabinet are believed to ac
count for early irregularity.
Although the turnover fell far short
of the larger total of recent weeks,
dealings were unusually broad, em
bracing a greater variety of rails,
also steels, equipments and specialties,
notably the food group.
Oils and motors and kindred acces
sories were less responsive to early
moderate accumulation, but buying of
those issue became more extensive in
the very active final hour.
Investment rails were only moder
ately strong, Interest and activity in
transportation centering around minor
shares, particularly Texas and Pacific
which made a gross advance of nine
points to the highest level since re
organization. Sales amounted to J,
300.000 shares.
Foreign bonds failed to reflect re-
ported political changes abroad and
domestic issues, including the Liberty
division, were merlv steadv. Total
sales, par value, aggregated $8,400,000.
Old United States bonds were un
changed on call.
WOOL VAULES TEND UPWARD
BOSTON, June 20. The Commer
cial Bulletin tomorrow will say:
While there has been no marked
change so far as prices at the sea
board wool markets are concerned, the
tendency of values is still upward, es
pecially on finer wools.
"Tht marketa abroad all are firm,
especially in England, except on the
medium wools grading below fifth.
The mill ?ituation is very strong
and some prices are being named for
the light weight season on standard
goods.
"Buying in the west ha3 continued
steadily with prices firm for the best
wools and in the fleece wool sections
a little higher for delaines."
Scoured basis: Texas, fine 12
months, $1.501.60; 8 months,- $1.35
01.40.
OUTLOOK BEST SINCE ARMISTICE
NEW YORK, June 20. Bradstreet's
tomorrw will say:
Activity in demand, strength ca
prices ana optimism as to outlook
stand out more clearly than at any
nrivn... H.to .in. ti,. ..: .'
to the first it might be said that the
list of things sought is a virtual roll
call of the "country's products, with

uries most wanted inii tho Viiof nnn.
cern expressed being as to deliveries
of god.s with prices to be paid a sec
ondary matter. Even the great indus
trial lines that have hitherto lagged
iron, steel and to a lesser extent,
coal show buying increasing and out
put enlarging. -
Bank clearings $8,657,568,000, a gain
of 10 per cent over last week.

THE GRAIN MARKET
CHICAGO.. June 20. Reports that
a, ucw ueuuau cauinei wouia sign tne
peace treaty did a good deal today to
lift the corn market to the highest
level yet this season. However, ship
pers ana industries
then withdrevr,
and prices closed weak, at the same
as yesterday's finish to c lower, with
July $1.81 to $1.S1 and September
$1.74 to $1.74. Oats lost a shade 10
c. In provisions, there were gains
varying from 30c to 65c.
Much of the buying in the corn mar
ket was based on the assumption that
the signing of the peace treaty would
greatly widen demand for foodstuffs.
duiih comenaea also tnat no laro
stocks of corn would hereafter be ac -
cumulated, and that the growing crop
woiuu iau snore oi current estimates,
In the last hour, though, speculators
on the bull side found that they had
overreached themselves, and that
other interests were flatly refusing to

States of America, and, it appears that
you or your principal are no way con

cognized by the United States of
America," General Erwiu's reply read.
"I therefore decline to have any
communication whatsoever with- you
or your principal on any subject re

communication was telegraphed to
Major General Cabell, commander of
the southern department at San An

of the border .district here, and was
relayed to Washington from there..
General Erwin's reference ; to Gen

on the ground of the "proverbial
spirit of military comradeship."' He
admitted the revolutionary forces
