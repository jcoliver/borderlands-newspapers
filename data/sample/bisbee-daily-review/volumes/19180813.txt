(By Review Leed Wire)
UNITED WAR LEAD, (By the
sociated Press) Although the Ger
mons are employing fresh forces of re
serves in efforts to hold back the allied
troops who are pressing them from the
region of the Somme to the Oise, the
American, British and French armie3
continue to make progress.
Monday witnessed gains of ground
at various points along the battle front
of high importance for the further
prosecution of the endeavors of the
allies to drive cut the Germans from
tbe old Ainiens-Montdidier sector.
After an extremely bitter contest the
British and Americans have gained a
foothold in the important little town
of BraySur-Somme, on the northern
bank of the Somme. A short distance
across the river to the aouth th Brit
ish have taken Proyart and midway of
the line have pressed on to the east
of Fouquescourt in a maneuver which
has resulted in the further outflanking
of Chaulnes from the south and of
Koye from the north.
On their part the French in the roll
ing country immediately north of the
Oise river have captured Gury, a posi
tion of great strategic value, lying
southwest of Lassigny and at several
other points southward to the region
of the Oise have advanced their line
further toward Noyon.
In Monday's fighting hundreds of
Additional Germans were made pris
oner and the enemy also lost heavily
in men killed and wounded. Unoffi
cial reports give the number of Ger
mans captured during the present of
fensive as in the neighborhood of
40.0O0.
The Germans at last accounts were
still throwing reinforcements to tne
east of the road running through Chau
lnes, Roye and Noyon, the passage of
which by the allied would seriously
menace all the German forces inside
the pocket formed by the. Somme on
the north and east and the Oise on
the south. Not alone are the allies
endeavoring to press their advantage
to frontal attacks but they have drawn
up to their back lines guns of medium
and heavy calibre and with these they
are heavily shelling the areas.
Seemingly the advances by the
French troops on the southern part
of the line cannot but have an ex
tremely important effect on the pres
ent battle. The hill positions tiey
have gained not alone dominate the
Oise valley running northeastward to
Noyon but around iJissigny also give
them a sweep of the plains south of
Roye.
Aside from the Amiens-MontdiJier
sector little fighting has taken place
on apy of the fronts. Along the Vesle
the Germans again have delivered viol
ent counter attacks against the Amer
icans and French who are holding
ground on the north bank of the
stream. As on previous occasions
when the enemy atempted to dislodge
the allied troops the counter attack
failed.
British aircraft have brought down
a German airship off the coast of Hol
land, according to an announcement
by the British admiralty. An unof
ficial report announces that a Zeppe
lin of the largest and newest, type nas
been brought down off the Engli.sh
coast.

VITAL POINT
Occupation of Chaulnes
Would Spell Disaster for
Huns in Their Retreat Tow
ard New Defense Line
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 12 (Fy The Associated
Press). The British guns are ham
mering Chaulnes while cannon of
large calibre are coming up all the
time and drenching the enemy rear
with steel. They are also pounding
away at the bridges across the Somme
at Eethencourt.
T.he shelling of the bridges here is
a serious matter for the enemy as
bombs from the air are continually be
ing dropped by British airplanes from
a low altitude at the bridges in me
Perrone district. This bombing has
ibeen going on day and night since the
battle began, forcing the Germans to
divert their transport, so that the gen
eral movement was southeast. Now
his bridges to the southeast are under
heavy fire.
With tiie comparatively small force
of Americans there has been no real
heavy fighting today.
At many places along the new front,
especially just south of the Somme
the Germans are occupying the old
line dugouts built by the French more
than two years ago. The German1!
have concentrated artillery at many
places and today are sending in more
shells than on any day since the bat
tle began. Lihons was Jieavily shelled.
A party of cavalry charged down
the Roye road, ran into the cross fire
of large German pill boxes studded
with machine guns just this side of
Roye and received a check, but the
Germans paid the extreme penalty
later.
Today the resistance by the enemy
has been stiffening progressively, but
his troops apepur to be nervous and
apprehensive of what the future holds
out for them. In order to feel out the
allied forces it is expected that furth
er heavy counter attacks may be
launched.
An aerial observer coming into his
station shot down four machines. In
the same ' fighting a British pilot
chased one enemy plane to earth and
was swooping down to finish .off his
antagonist when the man climbed out
of bis machine and held up his hands
in token of surrender.
"So I -didn't kill him," the British
pilot said. "But on my way home I

Mining companies of this district, j

Operating in a manner strongly
reminiscent of the "wobbly drive" a
little more than a year ago, a posse
of officers and citizens of the district
last night gathered up approximately
2in young men of draft age who were
not able to show their registration

Cannot Explain His So-Called

Declaration He Did Not
Oppose War
CHICAGO, Aug. 12. A large
number of letters were read into
the record of the I. W. , trial
before Federal Judge Landig today
by Frank K. Nebeker, chief coun
sel for the prosecution. In support
of the government's charge that
Wm. D. Haywood, general secretary-treasurer
of the organization
talked and wrote against con
scription and the war and used
his influence as head of the body
to interfere with the government's
military policy. On direct exami
nation Haywood declared that he
had never spoken a word or writ
ten a line in opposition to con
scription and the war.
On cross examination Attorney
Nebeker produced a mass of docu
mentary evidence to refute the de
nial of the I. W. W. leader.
Haywood was kept busy in a vain
effort to explain the contents of let
ters which he had written and received
from his lieutnants containing numer
ous references against the govern
ment's war plans. On several occas
ions he denied having written certain
letters with which he was unexpected
ly confronted, mid attempted to place
the blame on his assistants.
He was obliged to admit that the
I. W. W. had employed lawyers to
dt fend all members arrested for evad
ing the army draft but aenied that the
general executive board of the iTg.inl
tation had ever adopted a resolution
opposing the war. He also admitted
that n. embers had been dropped from
the rolls after they had entered the
army.
One letter was read, In which Hay
womiI advised a lieutenant to be careful
to do nothing which might be con
strued as giving comfort and support
to the enemy. He explained that by
the enemy he meant Germany.
"Was it your soliciture fur this coun

SIA, FRIENDLINESS OF PEOPLES
WASHINGTON. Aug. 12. The pos
sibility of the establishment of an
eastern front that will be a serious
menace, at least, to the Germans, Is
bting considered by officials here, it
became known today in connection
with '.he making public of the full text
of the proclamation of the "supreme
rovernment of the northern territory."
The signers of the proclamation are
with two exceptions, members of the
constituent assembly representing the
provinces of Novgorod, Arcnangel, Vo
logda, Viatka, Kazan and Samara a
chain of provinces extending from the
Arctic to the region of the Don Cos
sucks in the south.
This chain Is in the form of a crea
cmt making j complele tront of peo
ple strongly pro tiSy in sentiment and
repr.--cniing the best e emnts of the
Russian population. The signers of
the proclamation announce that the
people's representative, elected by
universal suffrage, are now forced to
take into their hands the government
of the northern region because as yet
there is no legal allrKussian govern
ment. They pronounce themselves
unqualifiedly opposed to the German
and declare that the new government
"is convinced that Russia's and the
nllUV interest in the struggle against
foreign enemy are one and the same."
Officials of the same department ad
mit that there Is reasonable ground
for hope that the eastern front will
be re-established by this new govern
ment, extending as It does 'rom the
An tics to the Caucasus and embracing
Millions of Russians who see the im
minent danger to their newly acquired
freedom, sought for generations, in
the domination of their country by
the German government.
One of the final paragraphs of the
proclamation reads.
"I, knows that the a!!led troops
come not to interfere with internal af
fairs rr.d their arrival is not against
tb,. oesire of the local population.
Thereore, the supreme government
greets ihe allied forces entering the
nort!: to wag the contest against the
common enemy and summons the en
tire population to greet them gladly
and assist by every possible means."
Allied troops are landing at Vladi
vostok to render aid to the Siberian
fortes. So. it Is pointed out the pros
pect for an eastern front that will
seriously threaten Germany and Aus
tria, is brighter than it has been since
the Ruosian debacle.
The flight of Ienine and Trotzky,
reported today in press dispatches, is
regarded by officials of the state oe-i
partment as significant of the weaken
ing if not the utter loss of power by
the Ilolsheviki.

from oil discharged on the water
by the German submarine operat
ing off the middle Atlantic coast,
overcome six men in the coast
guard station and lighthouse on
Smith's island. North Carolina.
Saturday evening, the navy depart
ment was advised today by the
commandant ot the sixth naval
district.
If the gas attack was deliberate,
as most officials believed, it con
stitutes a new and Ingenious form
of "frightfulness" and was the
first direct effort of the German
raiders to harm persons or prop
erty on American shores.
The gas was said by the command
ant of the coast guard station to have
much the same effect as the mustard
gas used by the Germans on the west
ern front. The men were laid out for
more than half an hour, but apparent
ly suffered no serious after effects.
The dispatch relating the gas attack
was one of a series concerning Ger
man submarine warfare oft the Atlan
tic coast received during the day by
the navy department. One told of an
attack on a submarine 100 miles east
of the Virginia coast by an American
destroyer, which discharged seventen
depth charges where the raider was
seen to submerge. The result ot the
attack ws not determined; but after
oil had aypeared on the surface of the
water, two bombs were dropped on the
spot and the submarine was not seen
again.
Sinking of the British steamer Pent
stone, of 4139 gross tons, and the
Swedish steamer Sydland. of 3031
gross tons, in New England waters
near where ten fishing smacks were
destroyed Sunday also was reported to
the navy department during the day.
The former was torpedoed Sunday
with he fate of her crew still unde
termined, while the latter was destroy
ed by bombs August 8 and her crew
later rescued by passing ships.
Still another despatch said that four
survivors of the fishing schooner Katie
Palmer landed at New Bedford, Mass.,
reported that they had been taken
aboard the submarine, the commander
of which boasted that he was equip
ped to remain in American waters for
six months if he desired.
The submarine was described by the
men as being about 300 feet long, with
a conning tower fifteen feet high, and
mounting one gun. The raider carried
a crew of sixty men.
While the reports from the com
mandants of the Smith's island coast
guard station and sixth naval district
clearly indicated their firm belief that
the gas attack on the island was de
liberate, some officers tonight thought
there was a possibility that the subma
rine had discharged the oil and gaj
after being wrecked on a reef.
Attention was called to the fact tha:
the action of salt water on electric
batteries used by submarines genera
tors chlorine gas. which is similar to
mustard gas In its effect and is deadly
if encountered in a closed space. If
the submarine were wrecked it was
said, that this gas would be generat
ed and would come to the surface with
the oil which would be freed.
No such possibility, however, was
mentioned in the navy department's
announcement, which Bald:
"The navy department has received

Additional details of the train
holdup Saturday were received
here today. A heavy charge of
dvnamite was exploded under the
passenger train, killing a number
of w omen and children passengers.
The train guard resisted but were
killed. The engine crew escaped
with the locomotive and obtained
assistance from nearby stations,
driving off the bandits who robbed
all the passengers of their cloth
ing and belongings. Forty soldier
and twenty-six civilians were re
ported killed and seventy wounded.

CARING FOR U. S. WOUNDED IN FRANCE
, . - - ,i-rn
ADVANCE VERY RAPID
WITH THE FRENCH; ARMY IN
FRANCE, Aug. 12 (Morning by The
Associated I'ress). Although the Ger
mans have been reinforced and arc
resisting more strongly between the
Avre and the Oise. t'teir fresh divi
sions have been unable entirely to stop
the advancing French who now have
a firm hold on Thiescourt I'latean. ine
French hold positions that command
the only roads leading, from Rove and
Ribecourt. toward Isoyon over wimn
the enemy can withdraw his artillery.
The increasing difficulties attending
tJirir retreat are driving the Germans
to desperate sacrifices in their effort?
to check the al'ies' advance around
the positions the Germans hold on
Thiescourt Plateau. Their losses are
extremely heavy and their dead lie all
over the field. They are found in shell
holes and ncoks where they vainly
sought protection from the French tire.
Among them are some survivors, who
are found in every possible hiding
place.
Privations were endured by the
Germans in the front line recently.
This was picturesquely evidenced by
a letter found since the offensive be
gan, u was irom an onicer, wno in
formed his relatives in Germany that
the French artillery had been furnish
ing the only meat available by killing
horses. Another officer wrote with
pride and satisfaction that he was able
to send along with his message of love
and hope a sack of wheat he had just
gleaned from an adjoining field.
A German w reless operator was
: found at the bottom of a well after
! the French had advanced over the
i enemy positions. As an evidence of
the haste with which the enemy with
idrew it may be said that the entire
jmail of one regiment made up for

Deputy Sheriff J. K. O'Neill was
stabbed in the back and seriously in

the bars into the corrider of the jail
to lock up in his cell for the night
Ival McCann, under life sentence for
murder, when Harvey Ward, who tried
to commit suicide in jail Saturday
night, sprang upon O'Neil and stabbed
him in the back with a knife. O'Neill
turned and grappled with Ward and
called to Acting Night Jailer Joe
Ealsh.
Before Balsh arrived several of the
other prisoners sprang upon O'Neill
and tried to shove him into the cell
occupied by McCann. :alsh leveled
his revolver at Ward at the jail door
and forced the prisoners into a corner
while he rescued O'Neill. Attending
physicians said the knife entered
O'Neill's back near the spine inflicting
a serious but not dangerous wound.
The jail is very crowdod and should

TARGET SHOOTING NEARLY
PROVES DISASTROUS TO
THE ENTIRE DISTRICT
The practice of shooting small
calil.er rifles at targets on hills ad
jacent to the city is to be tliseoii
tenauced by the officers as a result
of a narrow escape, not only for the
shooters themselves but for the dis
trict. Small boys and ethers who
have made a practice of going onto
this hill to shoot, were shooting
Sunday at a target almost in line
with a large quantity of high explo

Had a bullet struck a box fairly,
an explosion which might have

WASHINGTON, Aug. 12 Achieve
ments of state councils of defense
were praised by President Wilson to
day in a letter to Secretary Baker
In reference to the secretary's sugges
tion that the machinery of the state
councils be used as far as possible by
all federal agencies in extending their
work.
"I have read with great interest your
account of the achievements of the
state councils of defense and your gen
eral summary of the activities in
which they are now engaged," the
president wrote. "It is a notable rec
ord and I shall be glad to have you ex
press to the state councils my appre
ciation of the services they have so
usefully rendered. 1 am particularly
struck by the value of extending our
defense organization into the smallest
communities and by the truly demo
cratic character of a national system
so organized.
"I believe in the soundness of your
contention that tn the interest of econ
omy and efficiency such machinery
as that provided by the state council
system for the execution of many
kinds of war work should be utilized
as far as possible by federal depart
ments and administrations. May I sug
gest there that you communicate to
the heads of all such departments and
administrations my wish that when
they ahe considering extension of their
organizations into the state or new
work to be done in the state, they tUjb
termine carefully whether they can
not utilize the state council system,
thus rendering unnecessary the crea
tion of new machinery and that they
transmit all requests for action by the
state councils through the state coun
cils section of the council of national
defense."

Schultz, 19 years old. woh .Irives a I
roushly treated by two soluT'rs In-',
night who tri"d to steal the aulo!volil!e
a laree Stud"baker.
The soldiers approached him last
night at 11:15 o'clock at Shannon's
stand on Tenth street.
They said they belonged to a ma
chine gun tro'op encased in practice
on the tarcet ranue throe miles east
of the city, which troop was cnnirvd
at the range, rnd wanted to be lrlv. n
out there. The young chauffeur wont
with them..
Two miles out he noticed they be
came very quiet. Suddenly ono of
them threw one arm around Scliultz's
neck, plarinqr his hand over the chauf
feur's mouth to caqo him. Schultz
stopped the car. As he did so one
foot became causiht under the operat
ing footgear in the bottom of the car.
The men tied Scliultz's hi'mls behind
him. Another car was seen approach
ing along Fifteenth street from tuo
east. ThP soldiers tried to move Hie
car to one side so they would not be
seen, but could not do it. Then one
of them stepped out the car on to the
ground.
MeanwM'e Schultz had slinped nis
hands loose from the rope that he'd
him at the wrists. With his left timid
he drew a gun and fired once at the
man on the ground. When he did
this, the fe'low in the car gnbb'Hl
Rohultz's left arm and twisted it until
Schu'tz had to let loose of his gun.
Then the soldier, who also had a gun
pressed it aeainnt Schultz and ordered
him out the car.
"Move quick or I'll blow your brains
out!" he said.
About this f'me the car which ha1
been comintr from the east stopped
within a car's lencth of the holdup
party, but decided that was a poor
place to mix in, drove on to the city
rapid'y. This far was driven by Frank
Martin, also u chauffeur, who was
taking three women to the city. I to
reported the holdup to the police at
once. He explained today that the
reason he did vnt attempt to interfere
was that he did not have n gun wiili
him and, hearing the shot which had
been fired by Schultz, supposed it was
fired by the holdup men and that 't
would be fool hearty for him to try
to help out the hoy. Reside, the wo
men in the car 'war,, frightened and
insist' d that he drive on at once.
After being removed from the car.
Schultz sprinted to town to notify the
rolite. but of course Martin had
rrndy done tnis. Schultz looked ha-k
and saw the two soldiers trying to
operate the car. They irove the car
about 50 fret backward and then
gave it rp after tearing out the switch
wires and such things. Then they
abandoned the car and escaped. The
car was towed in by the po'ice when
they arrived.
It was reported today that the two
soldiers who tried to steal the car
last night tried to hire four or five
other cars before getting Sehnltz's but
the drivers would not take them.

what did we promise
our boys in France?
Just this: That every minute of
the day, every time they went into
a trench, every time they went
over the top, in a night patrol,
every time they swept forward to
smash a German trench,
every time they risked
themselves for the sake
of Liberty and America
that we'd be back of
them to the last ditch,
giving for them, work
ing for them, fighting
for them in our factor
ies to give them all the
"tools" they need to
lick die Kaiser.
President's Statement
There is only one way
to make good on that
promise and that is for
every last one of us,
whether he runs a lathe
or runs a 10,000-man
plant, to put in every
minute of his working day where
it does the most good. Every
working minute lost or wasted
means less help for our men across
the sea.
And there are not just minutes
but whole days lost every time a
man changes his job. A man has

"I urge labor to respond

loses time in moving. He takes
time to catch on to the ways in
the new plant.
When a manufacturer needs
more men, it is his duty
to the country as a
whole not to disturb
plants that are engaged
in essential war work,
but to get the Govern
ment's help in finding
men who can be taken
from less important
work. This can be
done through the na
tional labor clearing
house that the Govern
ment has established
with 500 branch offices
and 20,000 agents of its
recruiting division, the
United States Public
Service Reserve. There
is no charge and the

Fruits of Victory
Beth the Maine and the Somme offens
ives seem to have been temporarily checked
at lcqst, the Germans electing to stand and
fight on th Vesle in the sector of the Marne
and on the Peronne-Roye line in the
Amiens sector. As to whether they can
hold these lines long remains to be seen.
The retrograde movement has not been as
great as hoped for, and yet it is greater by
far than was thought possible a month ago
when the Germans still held the offensive.
, Foch's two victories are not inconsiderable
' at that. He has taken at least 60,000 pris
oners, if not more, and about a thousand
cannon and countless machine guns, shells,
stores and war booty of various kinds. The
German losses besides prisoners were cer
tainly mere than 1 00,000 in each big drive.
So the enemy has nearly 300,000 men,
most of them picked, troops, leis, than he
had when he started the drive to take
Rheims July 1 5, besides his losses of
ground, guns and morale. And more even
than these, he has lost the offensive.. To
those who may be disappointed at the slow
ing down of these drives without more de
cisive results, it might be said that no one
expected Foch to strike full.fcrce before late
in the fall or early next spring. Foch is
just starting. He may strike in a fresh place
tomorrow, or he may renew the drive
"stopped at the Vesle with irresis table for.ee
any. day. One thing sure he has shaken
the German fabric to its foundations and he
has put the German war machine out of
commission for a while .at least. Another
German offensive this 3Tear is now an im
probable if not impossible accomplishment.
BUILDING HOMES FOR
(Fr..m the Kl l'aso Herald.)
The plan of the Copper Queen and the
Calumet and Arizona mining companies to
build and sell, houses to their employes is
good for the employes and their families
and also good for.the companies. Incident
ally, it is good for the district.
The companies are making it advan
tageous for miners and mechanics and their
families to own their own homes by offer
ing to build for them in Wan en, a suburb
of Bisbee, on plans to be furnished either
by the purchasers or by the company, as
the former may desire. The purchasers are
to buy the houses with their vent money,
plus interest at 6 per cent. The terms are
far more favorable than any building
agency could afford to make and are an
inducement to. employes to settle down,
own their own homes and sto"p acquiring
bundles of rent receipts with nothing else
to show for their money.
This is not the first experiment in com
pany housing in Arizona. The New Cor
nelia subsidiary of the Calumet & Arizona
company, operating at Ajo, southern Pima
county, built model houses for its em
ployes, all substantial and sightly, thus get
ting away from the usual ramshackle ap
pearance cf mining camps. At Clarkdale,
Yavapai county, the same experiment has
been tried, but the houses were not built
for purchase. They rented to the employes
end the latter have complained about the
rents. These recently have been ordered
reduced by agreement between the com
pany and the miners.
As for the Warren district, the miners
and their families are not the only ones to
benefit. ) he mining companies are evi
dently trying to build up permanent, effi
cient and stable forces of employe?. The
yearly bonus system is evidence of that, and
the decision to bui'J houses for sale to em
ployes is another indication. People who
own their own homes do little moving from
carr 7 to Vamp.
1 he di.-tri'.' e.t l.r:;c will benefit because

OUT OF THE WEST
(W. L. S: idger iiiho Outlook.)
Troops were expected in at a certain port
of entry. The camp had been emptied of
1 0,000 men. That means but one thing
that new troops are expected. The great
dirigibles sailed out a few hours ago. The
seaplanes followed. Thousands of Amer
ican men and women lined the docks wait
ing, peering with anxious eyes out toward
the "point." Here at this point a great cape
jutted out into the ocean and around this
cape. we were accustomed to catch sight of
the convoys first.
A sense of great expectancy was upon
us. We had heard rumors of submarines
off the shore for several days. Then sud
denly we heard a terrific cannonading, and
we knev.' that the transports and the con
voys were in a battle with the U-boats
which had lain in wait for them. An
anxious hour passed. The sun was setting
and the west was a great rose blanket.
Then a shout went up, for the first great
transport swung around the cape. Then
another, and a third, and a fourth, and final
ly a fifth; great gray bulks, two of them
camouflaged until you could not tell wheth
er they were little destroyers or a group of
destroyers or one big-ship. Then they got'
near enough to enable us to see the Amer
ican boys, thousands of them, lining the
railings. Through the glasses we could
make out the names of the transports. They
were some of the largest that sail the At
lantic. They came slowly in on the full
t'de, with that rose sunset back of them,
the bands on their decks playing across the
waters, and 5000 boys on the first boat
singing "Keep the Home Fires Burning,"
then the "Marseillaise" and finally "Ihe
Star Spangled Banner," in which the crowd
on the shore joined.
There were the great ships, and beyond
them the cape, ar.d beyond that the hover
ing dirigibles, and beyond them the great
bird seaplanes, and beyond them the back
ground cf a rose colored sky, and beyond
that the memories of home.
The captain of a German U-boat told the
captain of an American fishing schooner
before lie sank his craft off the coast of
Maine the other day, that he had been cruis
ing the American waters for six months and
expected to stay until October. This is
rubbing it in. It is plucking a feather from
the eagle's tail. It is arrogant boasting of
a U base undiscovered off our shores. But
soon or late the American eagles will find
this base and destroy every German sub
marine on this side of the Atlantic. It is
vexing; it is an annoyance; it is a wound
that smarts, but this far flung extention of
the U-boat activities plays no vital part in
the great game of the war. It is the bark
and not the bite of the dog.
A new plant, to cost at least $500,000,
is lo be built in Chicago as a result of the
sugar shortage. The plant will be used for
making malt sugar from barley, and will
supply a large part cf its product to con
fectioners. 1 he plan originated with Charles
Stevenson, head of the sugar division of the
food administration, who is getting the pri
orities necessary for the construction of the
factory. "A supply of malt sugar will re
lieve the pressure for confectioners and
manufacturers of beverages, who are in
trouble over sugar," said Mr. Stevenson.
"Malt sugar can often be used as a sub
stitute for cane. In some industries it has
been found that substitutes are better than
sugar and less expensive."
When the kaiser took unto himself the
grand cross of Finnish liberty he said: "By
our deeds we have accomplished the protec
tion of small nations in the struggle for
freedom." Oh, ye immortal gods! what a
sacriligious yawp. "By our deeds," indeed!
Let Belgium bear witness, and Serbia and
Rumania and the ravished provinces of
Russia. "Deeds" that make strong men
shudder and women weep and children sob
and scream. Whom the gods would destroy
they first make. mad is an true today as it
vas when Homer sang of the epic of Troy
plains. 1 he kaiser is surely mad. I lis
every word and ait of the past year are
those of a paranoiac. Well, thank' heaven,
the end is not far off.

DASTARDLY
GAS ATTACK
MADE BY HUN
(Continued from Tate One)
C, stating that an attack with gas
was attempted on the North Carolina
coast about 5 o'clock Saturday after
noon with the result of temporarily
'putting out cf business the coast
guard station and lighthouse person
nel.' The report goes on to say:
"'About forty minutes after thc at
tack three large oil spots each over
one acre In extent were observed pass
ing by Smith island to the north. This
oil from which tne gas was no doubt
generated must have been released
from a submarine in the vicinity cf th-j
entrance to the channel with th hope
that it would come in with the" ilae.
bat thc tide fortunately set alon'j I'icf j
island. I
" "Report was made to Colonel .
Chase, coast artillery corps. Ft. Cas-
well, N. C, by Captain Willard o iho ;
Smith island coast guard after the el-1
fects of the gas were noted. Six men '
were gassed. No deaths. Tim gas hid
the eifect of mustard gas ami w.is of- ;
fectivo about thirty-six to forty mm-:
utes. Color of the gas has not yet i
been ascertained and its effect on ,
trees and shrubbery not yet deter
mined. The entire matter will be in- ,
vcsMgated and report made.'
"The incident was reported by Col
onel Chase to the naval district cm
mandant. Smith's island is off the
mouth of the Cape Fear river near the
entrance of the channel to iiining-.
ton, North Carolina."
Assuming the attack was deliberate,
the only explanation offered hero wis
that the submarine commander s-t-ugiit
to put the lighthouse out of commis
sion with thc attendant danger to pas
ing ships, if'that were the purpose
of the submarine he did not seo why ,
he did not destroy the lighthou-e vitn
his guns.
On the basis of reports received con
cerning the attack on the subi.iarine
attacked off the Virginia coast, of
ficials would not venture an opinion aj j
tu the possibility that the U-boat as
destroyed. The time of the attack
was not given in the dispatch. j

NEW YOKK, Aug. 12. Railroad
stocks were the conspicuous features
of today's sluggish aud irregular mar
ket,, moving up to boat nrii es of sev
eral months.
St. I'aul common and preferred ad
:iied 2',i and 3'4 respectively. Can
adian Pacific caused a scramble of
short covering in its extre.ne f:aiu of
3 points. Union I'm ific rose 2. Great
Northern l'i and Northern Pacific and
Southern Pacific one each.
Heading hardened later on the
steady inquiry for Eries, Baltimore
and Ohio, Cht-scpoake and Ohio, Pitts
burgh Coal and Pittsburgh and West
Virginia.
United States steel made a trivia!
pain at the outset but reacted abrupt
ly later, colsing at a loss of 1 points.
" Coppers were again inclined to sa?
on very moderate offerings with .Bald
win Locomotive and Harvester, while
tobaccos were inactive and irregular.
General Motors enlivened the final
dealings at an advance of five point".
Total sales amounted to 4o5,0i0
shares.
Investment bonds and internationals
were Jiim, Anglo-Frem h 5's leading the
latter group. Liberty 3 Vs were at thc
new hiuh of 1I0.0S for the year. Sales
par value, aggregated $o,450,''0'l. Old
United States bonds were unchanged
on call.

CHICAGO, Aug. 12 Pessimistic
crop reports from Nebraska and Mis

of excessive heat in tbe southwest

about sharp advances In the price of

Tne finish in provisions ranged from
lie decline to a raise of 15 cents.
Kxcept just at the outset, and dur
ing another brief interval an hour
ialer, tiie corn market showed a de
cided upward tendency throughout the
dav. The temporary setbacks were
ascribed to reports of scattered
showers. Crop damage reports were
also at hand from southern Illinois
and from Kansas, Oklahoma and
Texas.'
Large receipts depressed oats, but
later the strength of corn gave prices
an upward swing.
In provisions the fact tliat hogs ha a
touched $20.15. the topmost point on
record, was a strengthening factor.
Demand for pork, however, was lack

To Our Subscribers'
Owing to increased cost of labor, materials, and everything con
nected with the newspaper business The Review has found it neces
sary to discontinue the practice of having the route carriers collect
subscription accounts.
This practice was unsatisfactory and inefficient an mistakes were
frequent and the results of this system were unsatisfactory Lcth to the
subscriber and the paper.
Therefore: We request that all subscription accounts be paid direct
to the business office of The Review. This will eliminate a large
source of error and we are sure the benefit derived from this course
will be mutual.
j Subscriptions not paid in a reasonable length of lime will be dis
continued. V We will appreciate your cooperation in our efforts to .-ivc you the
veiy best possible service and conserve at the same time.

FOOTBALL PRACTICE IS
STARTING SOON
THIS YEAR
FOUR OF THE ELEVEN YOUNG
MEN SHOWING UP FOR PRAC
TICE MONDAY WERE ON FIRST

lCleven beys turned out Monday ev

which is to start early this year at
Bisbee high school. Of the eleven,
llobbs. 1'age, Sweet and McKee are
last year first team men, while the
other seven are either new or last year
second team men. Monday's practice
con.- isted in running to the end of the
car line and back, this kind of prac
tice fill continue two or three more
days, when the real work with the
pigskin will begin.
Hjbi)s, who is acting as temporary
co-ich until the regular coach arri.es,
is very much pleased at the outlook
for the coming season in athletics.
Several more last year men probably
will start practice at the opening 01
Che next quarter which is sometime in
the cuming month. Among these is
"Blcndy" Landrum, locally famous
last year as a goal kicker.
The new coach is expected to arrive
about the loth.
MAGNIFICENT SCREEN DRAMA
A world of romance is centered
about the trading posts of the far
north. Many have wondered what
they really look like and in the new
play "The Girl With the Champagne
Eyes," that William Fox ban made
and in which Jewel Carmen is the star,
one is shown that it is true to life.
This will be at the Eagle today.
Great care was given to make real
this scene In which men from the
known world met the men from that
which was unknown. There is a rough
plcturesqueness about these places
that does not fail to attract. It is here
that the girl cf the play who had been
a criminal in the land where her kind
are so mercilessly hunted, begins her
period of reformation and leconies the
cle-ar. and pure clement among tho;e
w ho are, for the most part, desolate.

"CITY SODA" H'ADjOO'S- DOWNFALL
M'Adoo's Career as a Druggist Ruined by Jammed Faucet;
Later Secretary Asked for Fountain Concession in Railroad
Station Recently He Remobed President WTio Opposed
' Plan
Little things often are the making
of big men. Down in Georgia MrK
and R. Drug Topics has uncovered a
story that tells how William Gibbs
McAdoo, Secretary of the Treasury,
narrowly escaped the career of a coun
ty town druggist and how the jamming
of a soda fountain faucet started him
on the road to fame and fortune.
The present Secretary of the Treas
ury had just passed his sixteenth
birthday when his father decided that
"Bill" the name by which the home
folks called him had been stretchins
his legs and eating free corn long
enough about the little McAdoo farm
in Georgia and decided to pick out a
job for him that would be "his makin."
Loading up the farm wagon with gar
den truck one day the father called to
"Bill" and ordered him to jump aboard
for a ride into town. Nothing had
been said to the boy by the father
about his plan for launching him upon
a "career." After selling bis garden
truck the father drove over to one side
of the market square, where there was
a druggist he knew. Telling "Bill" to
follow him, the father entered the drug
shop and collaring the owner in the
back of the store, earnestly engaged
him in conversation for ten minutes,
while the boy stood near the door look
ing out into the square wondering
what the' talk was all about. At the
end of the talk with the druggist, the
father walked over to the boy and
said:
McAdoo't First Job
"Bill, I'm going to leave you here
with Mr. . Hell teach you the
business. It will be a fine chance for
you. You won't get any money to
start with, but it will be a good train
ing for you."
If a 'possum had fallen from the limb
of a tree overhanging Bill's old swim
ming hole and had hit "I ill" head on.
he couldn't have been more flabber
gasted. The boy loved the open fields
of the old farm and the lure of the
country he never had envied city
boys and their close confinement to
houses built next to each other. Now
his boyhood dream was all to end.
For a while he stood In the door of
the store, sad and depressed, debating
whether he ought to take it on the run
back for the farm or stay as his father
had arranged, when a woman entered
and asked for a glass of soda water.
The boy had often heard of the new
kind of soda water they served in
city stores he had never had any.
Out on the farm it was ginger "pop"
and "fas," but the city soda he was
told was much nicer. As the druggist
pressed the little button under the
fountain and the syrup poured down
In the glass the boy's eyes opened
wide and he thought he might like the
job. He watched the dniegist phice
a glass under a faucet, turn something
end fill it with a water that fizzed up
Jt was wonderful he would stay; he
was sure he would like the job.
After the customer departed the
druggist said he had to go upstairs for
his dinner.
"If anybody comes in," he said to
the boy, "you just take the broom and

their minds off their injuries, re
store their nerves, shattered in
the war, and create a new interest
in life for many of them. The
photos above were taken at the
Walter Eeed hospital near Wash-
' ington. The upper one shows a
poke it against the celling I'll hear
it and come down."
"I:ill" promised to follow instruc
tions faithfully and took formal charge
With the druggist gone, he carefully
surveyed the premises and gave the
long line of mysterious bottles lining
the shelves a "once over," but these
didn't interest him. All the while he
was thinking of that fountain; he won
dered what its soda tasted like. It
must be good the customers said it
was "great."
And the Faucet Jammed
Unable to resist the temptation, he
decided to take a chance the old, old
story of Adam and the forbidden fruit
all over again. Following the method
used by the druggist, as best he could
remember it, the boy got the syrup in
the glass, but when he tried to get the
carbonated water into it, he turned
the faucet too sharply and the gas in
the water gushed out with a loud re
port like a shot. To ' make things
worse the faucet jammed so that the
boy couldn't shut it off.
"Bill" dropped the glass like a hot
potato. With all his strength, he
pushed and pulled on that faucet, but
it wouldn't budge. He tried to plug
the opening, but it .was no use the
force behind the water was too great
to be stayed. With the roar of a
young cataract, the carbonated water
poured out over the fountain sill and
floor, wasting itself away into a myri
ad of little brooks and creeks that
radiated to all sections of the store.
If you ever saw a hen on a hot grid
dle that was "Bill." His heart beat
411 to the minute. Sparks shot from
his hair. The fire of a great tragedy
flared in his eye. A cold chill ran
down his back. His legs twiggled
first he jumped one way, then anoth
er. He stood up straight, bent over,
side stepped and fox trotted he would
have stood on his head for an hour if
it would have choked off that blamed
faucet.
But the dern eld thing wouldn t shut
ud the gas in the escaping water
made a hideous noise and seemed to
hiss him and with a fiendish laugh
say, "I've got you just where I want
you. you sly young grasshopper. I bet
you won t monkey witn a mzz nos
again."
Into the agony of pulsing water,
coughing, snorting gas, soaking floor
and Hoggy, distraught boy, burst the
drucgist.
"What does this mean?" he shouted
in fortissimo accent, as he saw his
tank of carbonated liquid disembowel
ing itself on the floor.
"It won't shut off," piped 'BUI' cvas
lvely In soft pianissimo, parrying the
question while he edged toward the
door.
"Get out quick beat it back to the
farm you're fired," bellowed the drug
gift. Son Was to be a Lawyer
And so the die was cast 'I ill' had
crabbed the job made a fizzle of It
spilled the beans his promising drug
store career was over. In sixty min
utes by the clock the boy was on his
way back to the farm pharmacy and
William Gibbs McAdoo had kissed

The smaller inset is of one soldier
who lost his right arm and has
learned to do beautiful carving
with his left hand. ...m
it here made clear that 'Bill' never
got his glass of city soda he went
back without it.
Now the father changed his mind
the boy would become a lawyer instead
of a druggist a wise and lucky pick
ing this time.
The years rolled on and .William
Gibbs McAdoo. bright Southern lawyer
appeared in New York seeking an op
portunity to make good. Rents in
New York were high and clients were
slow in coming, however.
The pressing question now was,
"How could he make some ' money
quickly?" The clients would " come
later, but meanwhile? Recollections
cf the Georgia drug store fountain
surged before him they would not
down. He would open a fountain, hire
someone to run it for him and let it
work for him. Here was sure money.
His Application and His "Revenge"
The idea w-as good, but there were
difficulties in the way. He applied to
the New York Central & Hudson River
Railroad for a fountain concession In
Grand Central Depot. The applicant
was Unknown a stranger in the city
the application was turned down. To
the young lawyer the turndown came
hard, but what could he expect? The
soda fountain was his hoodoo.
More years rolled around and W. G.
McAdoo became Secretary of the
Treasury and director general of rail
roads. As director general six weeks
ago he removed the president of the
New York Central Railroad, the same
road that turned down his soda foun
tain application. But, to show he had
no hard feelings against the corpora
tion, he made that president director
general of all the railroads in the East.
.RAISE SUNKEN SHIPS
(By Review Ieasl Wire)
LONDON, July 30 Not all the ships
which German torpedoes and mane
collisions send to the bottom of the
sea stay there. In less than three years
more than 400 sunken merchant ves
sels have been restored to service.
And more than one ship has been
raised, repaired, sent forth on a new
career, and then sunk and raised anew
for a third lease on life.
This rescue woik is done by the sal
vage section of the British navy. Be
fore the war no one thought of at
tempting to save such wrecks as are
now brought up from the depths, but
ships now are priceless. The financial
value of salvage work is enormous.
The cargoes salved are themselves
worth many million of dollars.
Recently a big American tanker col
lided on a dark night in the Knglish
channel with a sturdy British stand
ard ship carrying oil. There was an
explosion of benzine, aud both ves
sels were quickly swept by flumes. Of
the crew of the British ship only eight
men, who jumped overboard, w ere
saved.
Salvage work on both ships began
with the arrival of tugs which, after
overcoming difficulties, managed to
tow them close-in shore. There it
was necessary to sink them by gun
fire. They are now being brought to
the surface, a long, arduous task.
The tanker, a fine vessel some 500
feet long and new-built, had on board
16.000 tons of oil, and, though she
blazed for four days, half of the cargo
was salved. When thoroughly re
paired, the tanker will be returned to
the United States not much worse for
wear, the damage being estimated at
$750,000 a small amount In marine
figuring in these days when persons
think in millions.

Famous Actress Succumbs
After Having Been Sick
Since Last April With Quite
Rare Malady
trty RpvIpw !.15I Wlro)
NEW YORK. Aug. 12 Anna Held,
the actress. dird here late today after
an illness of several months.
Miss Held had been ill since April
a rare malady known as myeloma,
a disentegration of the spinal marrow
and her condition was reported several
times as critical. She rallied repeated
ly, however, and until attacked ny
pneumonia a few weeks ago was re
garded as on the road to recovery.
Her physicians said that only her re
markable will power had prevented
her from succumbing long ago.
Anna field was born in Paris. In
1S73, of a I'olish mother and a French
father. I'pon the death of her father
the family moved to London where, mr
two years prior to going upon the
stage, Anna was a street singer. When
16 years old. Miss Held returned to
Paris after touring Holland and oth
er countries with a comedy company
and after that appeared In all the Eu
ropean capitals, winning renown by
reason of her beauty and the daring
magnificence of her gowns.
When she came to New York in
1S!)6, the American public's desire to
see and hear her the chic Parisian
had been whetted by stories of her
beauty, of the perfection of her com
plexion, which she was reported as
sustaining by means of daily milk
baths, and the charm of a French con
cert hall song, "Won't You Come and
Play Wiz Me?"
For more than ten years Miss Held
was in a musical comedy on the Amer
ican stage nearly every year, appear
ing part of that time as one of the
stars In plays produced by Florenz
Ziegfeld. jr. Miss Held subsequently
was married to Mr. Ziegfeld but after
several years they separated. A daugh
ter, Liane Held, now 23 years old, born
of a previous marriage, is now on the
stage.
Anna Held had the reputation of
having played and sung in more towns
and cities than most actresses and o
dressing with even more lavishness
than the celebrated Otero. She was
a great favorite of New York audi
ences. As a star in light comedy she
was known throughout the United
States.
She had repeatedly told Interviewers
that she would "never grow old" and
fulfilled her prediction almost to the
end. Friends say she had a wonder
ful spirit, and indomitable courage.
Told by the doctors that she must die,
she is said to have gayly remarked to
one of them:
"It is the last curtain. I have lived
and I will hold out to the last it is
the spirit of Joan of Arc and the spirit
of my parentage the unconquerable
French."

DECLARES IN ENTHUSIASM
i J. H. Ij!K, well 'known- in minin?
circles, has invented nnd patented an
aerial shell or torpedo which he thinKs
will make the German long range guns
seem like toy affairs. These ghells, he
says, can be fired at least M miles. A

ing a model. Lane has offtwi.the in

use if it desires it. already having
forwarded a blue print to Washing

The shells can be made any size.
They are propelled by a propeller
much like an airplane and have
planes to hold them up and ' guide
them. They are exploded by means
of an-electrical time clock iisidei If
a success they would do aw ay with
the use of large cannon.
Lane today pasted a blue print of
his device' in Gene Stewart's cigar

working four months on the invention
and is enthusiastic about it.

WALTER FREEMAN IN
FRANCE WITH
U. S. ARMY
WRITES VERY INTERESTINGLY
TO HIS FATHER OF THE PEO
PLE AND CONDITIONS IN THE
SECTION OF THE COUNTRY IN
WHICH HE IS STATIONED
F. W. Freeman, employe of the P. D.
Mercantile company, is in receipt of
a letter from his son, Walter, a well
known local boy, who is now with the
expeditionary forces in France. Wai
ter is with Company L, .ir.."th Infantry,
stationed somewhere in France under
going extensive training in preparation
for duty in the front line trenches.
Walter will be well remembered as a
boxer of more than usual talent. He
was undefeated middleweight chain-1
pion of the city when he left for ser-i
vice against the boches and won every ,
bout in which he engaged here deci-'
sively.
Using army Y. M. C. A. stationery,
Walter writes a very interesting letter (
describing the section of country in
which his outfit is located, the people
and conditions. He states that only
the very aged nnd girls remain at
home, nil the others being in the army .
and engaged in work.
Like a majority of the Sammies in '
France Walter does not speak more :
than a few words of French and he
tells of the humorous incidents which
occur when trying to make the natives :
understand what is wanted. i
Walter states that he is feeling ,
great, getting fine food and every- i
thing desired in the way of clothing
and equipment, and that he hopes to j
get into action soon where he can land
one of his straight lefts or his famous j
right cross on the chin of a pugna-'
cious Hun or two. j
are both very thoughtful towards the !
