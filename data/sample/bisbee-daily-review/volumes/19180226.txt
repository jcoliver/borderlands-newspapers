RccenUy stirred up, the argument "Uow much of a salary is a big leaguer really worth! has been hotly
contested on many sides. Fans, club owners and baseball" experts are begirminff to suspect that the players
bave been preatly overpaid for some while, llughey Jennirg-s says that he knows of only three players in tne
American league worth as much as $4,000 a season. The players of moderate talent who have turned back
contracts offering tbera $2,500 or thereabouts are said to be huje'y overrating their value. Almost all of them
get at least that much and the argument now proceeding may result in a general reduction of salaries througn
ut the big leagues. And the players will be sorry they ever git huffy.

Criticism of the war department
has died down until not eren a mumble-
or a mutter is heard nowadays.
And there is a reason. The war de
partment is working might and main
and with well directed skill at thf
colossal task or equipping the Amer
ican army bound for France. The
storm of criticism cleared the air and
washed the delays and mistakes and
mouldering moss away. It has played
its part upon the stage of this great
drama and gone back, to the wings
where it belongs. Criticism that is
constructive and made in good faith
and best wishes and in the right spirit
will always retire from the public
stage when it has played its part
Word from the government arms work
is to the effect that one million and
even hundred thousand rifles are now
available for our armies on foreign
service. From every source of war
department activities, munitions, guns.
clothing and supplies, comes an en
couraging word. Speed and efficiency
are the watchwords today in place
where the cobwebs clogged the ac
tivities of yesterday.
A German submarine sunk anothe:
Spanish ship the other day, the fourth
since the first of the year. Spain has
been decidedly pro-Germcn during the
war, at least the Spanish government
has leaned that way. Spanish notes
on these submarine sinkings have been
a cross between a whine and a wail.
Poor old decadent Spain. She fawns
and cringes before the Hun. She has
protected and eTen provisioned his
submarines. She has passed Ameri
can goods on to him in direct viola
tion of neutrality obligations. She has
toasted German officers in -her mess
rooms. She has deceived her own
people and overridden their wishes to
the edge of rebellion. And now the
Hun, with a sardonic smile, sinks her
ships, just as a wolf will throttle a
dozen sheep in a night when one will
make him more than a meal. To
destroy shipping has become such a
mania with the German rulers, after
the long carnival of destruction that
it might be said they run amuck down
the shipping lanes, sinking the craft
of friend and foe alike for the pure
love of murder and ruin.
Never was a stronger sharper con
trast between the allied way and the
German way of making war than that
shown by the treatment of conquered
peoples. When the Germans toot
possession of northern Italy they
looted or burned the houses, ravished
the young women and set the men and
older women to work digging trenches
under the fire of their own countrymen
and made them work twelve and four-,
teen hours a day, or until they fell
with fatigue, all without pay. When
the British took Jerusalem, and the
Turkish province of Palestine they
rebuilt and rehabilitated the Holy City
and gave out word to all iio bought
and sold in the market places and U
those wh. tolled and tilled and traded :
in country and in town that they ,
would not be molested nor their goods;
touched. And they kept that word,

William Towrsend Porter in the
Atlantic Monthly: I walked again in
the wonderful beechen forest at Com
piegne. I stood upon the terrace of
the chateau, where Napoleon's Aus
trian bride had looked amazed along
the entrancing vista, cut In one night
through m!les of billowing green by
"jer all powerful spouse. Compiegne
fell to the Huns when the ware of in
vasion rolled over Northern France.
But they did not ha.m the place. It
was the kaiser's plan, it is believed,
to receive upon the celebrated, terrace
the submission of the dignitaries of
France. Instead, one fateful day.
there came over the wire the words
pregnant with the fate of civilization:
"Foch has pierced our center. Fall
back at once."
THE OLD HEN TRIUMPHANT.
Kansas City Star.
The old hen has come into her day
at last, thanks to the latest plan of
conserving the food supply. She is
immune from all danger of being (hiet
mourner at the Sunday dinner. She
will henceforth fear neither the roast
nor the stew nor the baking oven.
"Biddy" can now walk boldly by the
axe and the chopping block without
experiencing a peculiar crick in the
neck.
Grocers have been ordered to strike
hens and pullets from the market list
until April 30. They are to be con
served for the purpose of supplying
egss.
This order will strike the city folks,
whose idea of a hen is an egg machine
working overtime to furnish the com
panion piece to "ham and." as a won
derful stroke of wisdom. But out on
the farm, where the old hen is re
garded as a star boarder and a com
mon loafer, one can imagine the pro
test. For fifteen years louitry men and
agricultural colleges have been edu- are exerting themselves to k?ep up

One farmer, when told by his gro -
cer that an orJer was forthcoming tc

sentiment of all farmers when he;

L. S. Taylor, comptroller of the Pull

said conducto-s' salaries range from
$70 to $100 a month, wit a 10 percent
bonus each year, a month's salary for

bonuses' after fifteen years of service.
Porters receive from $30 to $50 regu

the Reiniger-Freeman operations on
the Wakefield-Belber property in the
San Xavier district, was struck Sun

Apparently it is the South San Xavier

KIDNEY TROUBLE NOT
EASILY RECOGNIZED
APPLICANTS FOR INSURANCE
OFTEN REJECTED.
An examining physician for one of
the prominent life insurance compar ;
ies. in an interview of the subjec-', 1
made the astonishing statement that
one reason why so many applicants 1
for insurance are rejected is because
kidney trouble is so common to the
American people, and the larc ma-
Jority of tbo&e whose applications are
declined do not even suspect that they ;
have the disease. 1
Judging from reports from druggists
who are constantly in direct touch
with the public, there is one oreprra-1
tion that has been very successful in 1
overcoming these conditions. The mill i
ami healing influence of Dr. Ki'rier s 1
S amp-Root is soon realized. It otar.us
the highest for its remarkable record .
of success.

This money will be used to develop
in the schools the teaching of agricul
ture, home cconoiaict. and the indus

will be devoted to training teachers so
they may be equipped to teach there
subjects adequately.
Revolutionizes Training
The Smith-ILghes Act is revoluiicn
iiing secondary school educatiou. It
is the result of many y,ears of tai
among edacat'TS and many years oi
experimenting ith vocational educa
tion. It grew out of the combined rec
ommendations of educators and na
tional organizations of educators, ar.l
is a decided departure from the atti
tude and tre?lniPttt of vocational eda
cation that prevailed in our schools up
to now.
The test of e vocational subject ac
cording to th Smith-Hvghes Act. is
"Will the pupii be able to find profita
ble employment at itf The object is
no longer merely to train the hand hnt
to provide the Joy and the girl with a
catling at whi :h they can make a suf
ficient living The conviction is also
present that by concentrating in t;ie
ich'-o! on 'ies-r.in!; by doing," on prac
tical work, fure will be no sacr-firf
of mental trai'ii'ng that Row provid
ed by the so-called "culture subjects."
aot even the poli'h tht is supposed to
be reaped from the study e-f langa:isei
history and literature.
To acquire in the school suffi'-ieft
training in- a given vocation so as o
be able to make a profitable living itii
mediately thereafter, it will be neces
sary for the pupil to give, at least, half
of the school d:?y to the group of pno
tical subjects that bear on his chosen
vocation. Whcf he completes hi.
school course there will be a demand
for his services and he will be able to
step into a job a a trained artisan.
Fitted For Future
Nor does it suggest that the boy wtc
leaves the high school trained in -ig-
culture or as an artisan of some kin.;,
will have all other professional aven
aes closed to him. A boy with know
ledge of agriculture or with training :n
the tise of tools is as well .fitted, if not
better, to study law, mediicine. engiw
eering or enter the commercial freld
and make a success, as the other boy
who has taken the eeneral course it)
which there was a liberal amount of
history, languages, and literature.
But the facts are that most boys wao
leave the high school do not study law.
medicine, or engineerings but they eti
ler blind-alley vocations leading to no
particular career. Many such boys ay
prentice out to learn the trades that
they should have learned while at
school. A goof'.iy number drift from
one field to another and fonn the. great
class of unskilled employes. That r.o
and then one of these untrained high
school graduates becomes a bank pres
ident or a captain of industry is trao.
But the Smith-Hughes Act is thinking
to provide for U13 many and is not con
sidering the few. , 1
