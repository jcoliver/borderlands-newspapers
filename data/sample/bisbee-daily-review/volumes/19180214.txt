sistance from gun and man-power.
The Associated Press correspondent
with the French headquarters says
the French authorities consider that
the total number of the enemy now
facing the French. British. American
and Belgian troops, or held in reserve,
aggregates 2.344.0O0 men. Recent
statements from the British military
authorities in Great Britain have been
to the effect that preponderance of
weight in both man and gun power still
lies mith the entente armies.
Successful Raids
Several additional successful raids
by the British, in which German offic
ers and men were captured and others
killed, and heavy artillery fighting be
tween the French and the Germans on
various sectors Funis up the activities
that have been in progress on the
western front. The American sharp
shooters and artillerymen are keeping
up their good work against the Ger
mans in front of their positions, hav
ing with their shrapnel fire compelled
the enemy almost to abandon first line
trenches and with their sharpshooters
land rapid-fire guns forced snipers to
quit their posts and seek safety at
other places. Meanwhile German air
planes are still flying over the Ameri
can positions in an endeavor to obtain
information as to the number of men
there and how they are. ranged.
Huns Pillage Italy
While the Austrian at last accounts
were still trying out the Italian line on
the Sette Communi and other points,
and meeting with sanguinary defeat
i for their pains, behind the fighting
,' line they and the Germans are playing
j the role of vandals, using violence
! against the natives, pillaging their
' homes and stores and sending back
to their own-countries foodstuffs and
'other spoils. Even women and chil
; dren are being brutally treated by the
troops.

was announced today by Fuel Admin
istrator Garfield with the reservation
that it may be pat back into force be
fore the ten weeks period expires if a
return of bad weather brings another
breakdown in railroad transportation.
At the same time Dr. Garfield gave
state fuel administrators full authority
to continue the closing order in terri
tory under their Jurisdiction if In their
opinion circumstances demand it.
The heatless Mondays were decreed
by the fuel administration on January
17 and four have been observed in all
states east of the Mississippi except
those south of Virginia. The order
was enforced In the south on three
Mondays, but was lifted there last
week.
The rue! situation everywhere ex
cept in New F.ngiand has improved
greatly within the last two weeks. Dr.
Garfield said today. Reports from the
state administrators in New England
have indicated that most of them
think the situation demands further
closing.
Director General McAdoo tonight
gave out a statement endorsing the
rescinding of the Monday closing or
der, but calling attention to the dan
ger of further transportation difficul
ties from winter weather, and the con
sequent necessity of conserving coal.

ANCHOR OF ALLIED CAUSE.
Lloyd George, the greet and eloquent English premier.
In a recent address in the house of commons, told con
cretely something of what th British nary has done In
the war and paid tribute to the seamen as follows
"The British nary is like one of those internal organs,
essential to life, but of the existence of which we are
not conscious until something goes wrong. The navy is
taken for granted- In this war the British nary has
been the anchor of the allied cause. If it lost its hold
the hopes of the alliance would be shattered. To realixe
the power and might of the British navy and how essen
tial a part it has played in this great struggle, one has
only to imagine for a moment what would have happened,
not if we had not had the command of the sea at the be
ginning of the war, but if the British nary had been de
feated even a year ago and the scepter of the seas had
been snatched by our foes.
"In spite of hidden foes, as well as open attack, in
spite of legitimate naval warfare, and in spite of black
piracy, it has preserved the highway of the seas for
Britain and her allies. Thirteen million men have cross
ed and recrossed the seas, two million horses. 25 million
tons of explosives and supplies. 51 million tons of coal
and oil fuel for the use of our fleet and our armies and to
meet the needs of our allies. And the losses in men out
of the whole of that 13 million during these years of war
have only been 2,500. 1.700 of these alone through the
action of the enemy, and the remainder through the
ordinary perils of the sea this apart from the prodigious
quantity of food and other materials amounting in all
to 130 million tons, transported 'in British ships. This
indeed has been a triumph for the great navy."
The working classes of Russia have been brought to
a terrible state by their own leaders. The rioting anr
looting and slaying are ended, but now there are no
shops in which to work, no tools, rio payrolls, no organi
ration, no guaranty worth a kopeck behind anything in
that land. Just dismantlement, disruption and dismay.
The working classes of England. France and America,
better paid and having more privilege and protecCon
than they had ever dreamed of or hoped for a dozen
years ago, may well weigh the difference between wise
and conservative and just leadership and the wild
promises and black and empty fulfillments of irresponsi
ble radicals who serve only their own ends and then step
out of the way when the blow of reaction inevitably falls
There was never a time in the history of the world wher
the workingman faced such great responsibilities and
opportunities as right now. He has much to gain and
everythin: to lose. He should allow no man to do his
th;nking for him. He should study the situation himself
and consider tbe demands and sacrifices and gains of
the present hour and then weigh them with the possibili
ties and potentialities of the future. If he does his pITT
manfully and well, then he can come forward, backed
by overwhelming popular opinion and say proudly. like
a real patriot, "' have done my work; I want my re
ward." He can stride ahead only as his industry, good
sense, eccnomy, skill, learning and patriotism keep pace
with that stride.' A leap in the dark or a wild burst o?
rase and resentment will only delay his advancement and
hamper his cause. One all-absorbing task faces every
American citizen today, tnd that is winning the war. To
the victors belong the spoils, and to the traitors and
slackers shall be allotted swift punishment and a black
name that it will take generations to make white again
The old First Arizona, now known as the 15Sth in
fantry, has chosen Theda Bara, the famous movie vam
pire for godmother of the regiment, and the beautiful
Theda has warmly acknowledged the compliment and
proposes to visit her godchildren in the near future at
Camp Kearney and wish them Godspeed to France. The
Arizona boys did not make such a bad choice at that,
even if they did select 4 vampire. The fair Theda is a
vampire in the pictures only. In real life she is not onlv
a charming, but a most modest young woman, bearing
a reputation as spotless as the regimental flag. And
these movie queens and stars, they are entitled to much
honor from the soldier boys, for no class of people In
America are doing more for the Red Cross and the
Liberty Loans than these same stars of the screen. They
have given and raised hundreds of thousands of dollars
for the more worthy of the great works of the war.

Vehicles must turn squarely to cross the rails at all and
they go over with a bump and a bang. From four to six

This column hates to scold, but a newspaper that i

much of a newspaper. The street car tracks all the way
from the Bisbee depot to Lowell border a very narrow

up and down this thoroughfare. And yet the paving and

But in the center of the main street of the busiest corner
in Lowell the cement paving recedes in a broken and
ragged line away from the tracks a foot or so on either
side, making a crossing that is rough, expensive and
dangerous to all vehicles, and also to persons on foot,
who may well be struck by a vehicle that is slewed or

EXTEND THE TIME FOR INCOME TAX RETURNS.
It is out of the question to expect that income tax re
turns can be prepared in time for filing with the collectors
of internal revenue on or before March 1. The govern
ment, by extending the time, should willingly grant to
mcome taxpayers the indulgence which it has had to ask
of them for itself. The blanks which should have been
issued in December have only just been made available
for the personal income tax returns and for returns
of corporations; the excess profits tax blanks are still to j
be issued. .
Nobody as yet knows how to fill in an excess profits
blank, there are so many problems in the interpretation
of the law remaining to be solved.
There will be many millions of returns made this
year. The law requires that they should be filed with
the collectors by the 1st or March, a date only twenty
days away. The task is impossible. In the attempt to
comply with the law as to the date of filing innumerable
mistakes win be made calling for delay and a vast amount
of clerical labor in making corrections. Great numbers

luuea siaies nmrMmi s ouit. auuuio
that the slayers know they are being
hotly pursued, as they no doubt think
they killed all the officers in the
posse that went for them.
The possibility that the pursuit of
the Powers-Sissons trio may lead to
a general round-np bf draft evaders,
is being taken Into consideration by
the possemen. The presence of many
draft evaders, of all nationalities, in
the southwestern corner of New Mex
ico and the adjoinire section o? Ari
zona, is known to officers. Some of
ficers were inclined to suspect that
they may be tryine to effect a junc
tion with the draft evader colony m
the forestry mflds. which border Mex
ico. In the event the pursuit should
lead to a general round-up of draft
evaders officers who know the coun
try say that it would require soldiers
with a mountain field piece to dis
lodce them.
Wylie Morean, an uncle of the Pow
ers boys, in Tucson today, said that
the Powers boys were under the do
mination of Thomas Sissons. who he
M was a radical pro-German and
caused the Powers boys to evade the
draft- Morgan says he warnel Mc
Bride that the boys would kill him
i he sought to arrest them and the
Powers boys sent him a warning that
they would kill him If he did not

drugs consisted mostly of roots and
herbs gathered from the fielus and for

who are being sought by officers for
deputies. Jones
had planned to return there with a
party fcf Los Angeles engineers next
week but has canceled the trip ow
ing to the trouble.
The country around Rattlesnake
canyon. Redficld canyon and Red
field pass is very rough, according
to Jones, and in fact at the pass, a
narrow defile in the mountains, one
man could stand off a regiment. The
country is heavily timbered and only
accessible "by pack horses.
According to Jones the Powers boys
as well as their father Tom. are ex
cellent shots and he tells of. the
marksmanship cf one of the boys who
as at the claims when he was there.
The boy wculd go out and bring down
ducks on the wing with a rifle with
greater ease than the average man
would do so with a shotgun.
Family of Adventurers.
The father has been a frontiersman
all his life as were his father and
grandfather before h'm. both of whom
died with their boots on. His mother
and wife lived in Rattlesnake canyon
when the family first moved ovc'
with their cattle from the New Mex
ico line. The log cabin which tbe
father and sons erected caved in and
killed Powers' wife whi'e his mother
was killed when a young horse ran
away throwim her from a buggy.
When the Powers family first mov
ed to Rattlesnake canyon the father
n-ade a wagon by cutting down a
laree tree and hollcwfne it out for
tbe bed of the wagon while the wheels
were round blocks from a tree.
The Powers family formerly had a
cattle ranch near Klondike but sold
this out and moved what cattle they
kept up to Rattlesnake canyon. This
canyon received its name due to a
den of snakes mskine it their home.
These were so deadly and caused
such heavy losses among the Powers'
cattle that the father and two sons
finally "cassed" them.
The Abandoned mine w?s originally
located by Dullard and Tucker. The
latter was killed at the mine by a
fcrest ranger and It mas his interest
which the elder Powers has handled.
No Relations Here.
Tom Powers and his sons are not
rela'ed to Bill "White Oaks" Powers,

(CHICAGO. Feb. 13. Living condi
tions in the stock yards district la the
neighborhood known of as "Back ol
the Yards," were the subject of much
testimony in the meat packers' wage
arbitration hearing before Federal
Judge Sam Alschuler today.
Mrs. Rosalie Bo beck, a widow of 10
days and the mother of three children,
said her husband had worked for Wil

for several years. His earnings, she
said, never had been as much as $20
until the week before he died, when
he worked SO hours and received ICS.
He was a trackman at the time of his
death.
When her children had measles she
did not have money enough to have a
doctor and when her husband died she
had to rely on friends to pay his funer
al expenses.
In answer to questions by Attorney
Frank P. Walsh she said she never at
tended a theater, moving picture show
a picnic or other form of amusement.
She declared she never even went for

Asks Court to Return Death;

Packs court Room.
(By Review Leased Wire)
PARIS. Fed. 1J. As il. Hornet, pro
secutor in the case against Eolo Pasha
charged with treason, developed his
case this afternoon, he frequently
punctuated his arguments with the em
phatic request. "I demand a sentence
of death."
The courtniartial for the first time
assumed that tragic aspect which
characterizes all oourtmarlials and
which heretofore in the present case
has hen larkinr nsi iiip in I hp nrp-
ence of stvlishlv dressed men and
women and the levity of some of the
witnesses and at times of the accused
himself.
Bolo Pasha's personality paled into
insignificance as M. Mornet unraveled
the tangled German intrigue involving
prominent personages in many coun
tries. "This is only one instance of treason
in France." s'aid M. Mornet. " "This is
merely the first chapter. Other chap
ters will follow."
The evidence from the United States
appeared ta be the strongest card of
the prosecutor, and on it he dwelt at
length. M. Mornet rebuked Monsiciicr
Eolo. brother of the accused mac. for
suggesting that the American
evv
dence was manufactured and false.
Count von Bernstorff. former German
amoassaaor to the l nited States:
Adolph Pavenste-it. who is now in an
Americcn internment camp: Gottlieb
von Jag6w. former German foreign
secretary; Hugo Schmidt. former
agent in New York of the Deutsch i
bank, who also is interned in the L'nit
e-i States. Senator Charles Humbert
and William Randolph Hearst, an Am
erican publisher, were mentioned by
name by the prosecutor in his address,
but he avoided any personal mention

hours, but as night feli and the court
room became sombre, interest waned,
members of the court even apparently
not paying close attention until M.
Mornet made his passionate plea for
capital punishment at the close of his
address.
After saying that France had es
caped the gravest danger since the
Marne. M. Mornet closed as follows:
"The eyes of our allies are on us.
In the eyes of France we are judging
a man who attempted to do in France
what has been accomplished in Rus-1
sia. We must show no weakness. The i
world is fighting for its liberty and is
in expectancy.

RAILROAD BILL OF
ADMINISTRATION
IS DEBATE SUBJECT
Prepared Speeches Given By
Senators on Proposed
Statute. Present System Is
Defective One, Senator Says
(By Review Leased Wire
WASHINCTON. Feb. 13. Debate oa
the administration railroad b'H in the
senate was confined largely to pre
pared speeches oy Senator Kellogg
md McLean, republicans, both of
whom announced they would vote" for
the measure, though they opposed the
principal involved and supported gov
ernment operation of the carriers only ;
as a war measure.
"The present plan of government
possession un.ier private management
is a alf slave, half free policy. tha
can be justified only at a time wher.
the life cf the nation itself is at stake '
said Senator McLean. "It has all the
defects of government ownership and
none of the benefits of private man
agement under private ownership."
Senator Kellogg expressed the opin
ion that the .president's action ia tak
ing over the railroads was nnne?essary
and that results as great would have
been accomplished had the Govern
ment given adequate cooperation to
the railroads.
Senator Johnson of South Dakota
introduced an amendment wMch would
restore the original provision mnkiiu
the termination of government control
subject to future congressional action
This provision was eliminated by both
the senate and house committees.
A substitute bill was introduced bj
Senator Townsend. a' republican mem
ber of the committee.' It closely fol
lows the pending measure except that
it changes the compensation section
slightly
Senator Smith of South Carolina who
is in charge of the bill hopes to reach
a final vote next week.
SPANISH STEAMER SUNK
(Br RevU w Leased Wire)
MADRID. Feb. 13. The Spanish
steamer Ceferino has been sunk by
a submarine near Ferro island, one cf

of the crew were saved. They were
towed by the submarine to the port of
La Estaca in the Canaries.
The Ceferino is the third Spar.ish
steamer sunk by submarines in less
than three weeks. The others were
the Giralda aud the Sebastian. Pro
tests have been made by the Spanish
government against the sinking of
these two vessels.
The 'eferino was a steamer of 3647

KENNIG DEFENDS HIS
LOYALTY IN COURT
By Review Liiied Wire
NEW uUK. Feb. 13. Paul C. H.
Kennig. naturMired German, made I
emphati. protestations of loyaltv to
t.'ie I'r.ited States while testifying in
his own behnlf in the Brooklyn feder
r.l court today where he is on trial fo-'
treason, he is alleged to nave muti
'ated with traitorous and maliciou

the E. W. Bliss munitions factory
where he formerly was a foreman. Too '
gyroscopes were intended for use by j
the United tSates navy.
"I am with the United tSates her"'
I make my living and I am a citizen."
Hennig fairly shouted in answer to
question of his attorney.
"Did you ever have any feeling tha
you wanted Germany to win this war?
was another question asked.
"No. sir, I did not." was the answe-

members of a fraternal organizatier J
were with the American forces n
France and that he had "the samt
feeling for them as any father woul

On cross examina'ion Hennig de
clared toth factory and governmen
inspectors at the munitions plan
where he was formerly foreman wen
lax in the performance of their dutie
and that his relations wih them b
csrae unfriendly because he repeatef

tion in "gyro" parts which they ha
approved.
Hennig declared Lieutenant Franci
L. Shea who was in charge of the go

and a witness azalnst him. was i

several times that he "did not kno

These difficulties. Hennig saic
widened the break between himsel
arid Shea's staff.
It is expected Hennig's examinatioi
will be completed tomorrow.
