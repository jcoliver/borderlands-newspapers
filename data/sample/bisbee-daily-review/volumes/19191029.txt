Walkout Will Take Place in
Mines! Friday Night Unless
Today's Meeting Results in
Officers Changing Decision
INDIANAPOLIS, Ind., Oct .28.
With "no change in the situation"
reported at United Mine Workers of
America headquarters, leaders of the
big organization of coal miners were
preparing grimly tonight for a mo
mentous conference tomorrow of its
executive board, district presidents
and scale committee. John L. Lewis,
lifting president, arrived late today
from his home in Springfield, 111., but
had little to add to sentiments he
has already expressed concerning
the general - strike planned to take
effect in the bituminous mines No
vember 1.
The condemnation of the proposed
walkout by President Wilson and his
suggestion that a tribunal be appoint
ed to find a basis of settlement of
the disagreement between workers
and employers with coal production
continuing meanwhile, held no
charms for the union leaders. Echo
ing the point made by William Green,
secretary-treasurer of the organiza
tion, Mr. Lewis said that the nation
al executive's Idea that the neel for
wartime prohibition had passed be
cause emergency had ended,' ex
pressed exactly the union's attitude
towards its wartime wage contract.
"There is no further use for war
time prohibition, according to the
president," said Mr." Lewis. "Neither
is there further use for the wartime
wimhiiirtnn wit era aereement. We
therefore resent the imputation that
the strike is illegal."
The suggestion that work be con
tinued pending appointment and re
port of an investigating tribunal was
denominated by Mr. Lewis a meas
ure of delay.
"That would mean months of wait
ing while men ignorant of mining
problems studied and tried to solve
them," he said. "Meanwhile the
miners would be working under the
present intolerable conditions."
Other officials of the union agreed
heartily with this view. In addition
some of them pointed out that the
operators would take advantage of
the. delay to work the mines to ca
pacity, piling up reserve stocks'. and
placing the union at a big disadvant
age should the tribunal's efforts come
to naught.
, Direct negotiations with the mine
owners, however, would be welcomed
by the union. Vice President Lewis,
Secretary GGreen and Buch members
of- the executive board as had
reached here tonight were unanimous
in declaring that they stood ready
"as before, to negotiate a wage Bcale
without reservations." They empha
sized tne last two words and charged
that the employers would not nego
tiate except on conditions which the
union men were poweness iu mum.
Authoritative forecasts of the ac
tion to be taken tomorrow were al
most totally lacking. 'mere was
well defined impression, however,
that a reply to President Wilson
would be outlined, at least, if not
fully drafted and adopted by the con
ference as a whole.
Much doubt .was in evidence as to
the power of the executive board to
postpone or otherwise modify the
strike order and if that doubt is not
resolved the big walkout will take
place Friday midnight.

narrowly escaped asphyxiation to
day when he blew out the light

Wind, whom it was first believed
had attempted suicide, explained to
the police that he had read about
gas and lectricity, but until he ar
rived in New York recently, had
never seen one of the "pesky
things." He admitted that he was
aware that gas should be turned off
by manipulating a "faucet," but
said that he had imbibed too freely
of supposed two and a half per

Prohibition Senators Deny
They Will Delay Consider
ation of Treaty to Prevent
Liquor Being Sold Again
WASHINGTON, Oct. 2S. The sen
ate passed the prohibition enforce
ment act over the president's vato
tody and made immediately effect
ive machinery for preventing sale of
Deverages containing more than one
half of one per cent alcohol.
The vote was 65 to 20, or eight
more than the necessary two-thirds
majority. While there was a wran
gle over taking up the measure in
place of the peace treaty, which had
the right of way, there never was
doubt as to how the senate " stood.
It was overwhelmingly "dry," like
the house, which repassed the bill
within three hours after the presi
dent had vetoed it.
Before congress, at 3:30 o'clock,
finally clinched enactment of the en
forcement law, despite presidential
objection to linking war time and
constittuional prohibition acts, there
came from the White House the an
nouncement that the war time law
which was put into effect after-the
cessation of hostilities, would be an
nuelled the moment the senate for
mally ratified the German . peace
treaty.
It was the most definite of all of
ficial or semi-official statements
bearing on the war time act. Prohi
bition leaders were plainly disturbed
by the news, for they had counted
firmly uon the country reaching the
effective date of constitutional pro
hibition January 16 1920 wjithout
reopening of saloons.
Despite the clamor set up by wet
and dry forces over the White House
pronouncement, senate leaders said
they would proceed with the consid
eration of the treaty as heretofore.
Senators who have taken an active
part in the prohibition campaign
branded as unfair and absurd reports
that they would delay the treaty
simply to keep the liquor traffic from
getting a foothold in the compara
tively short period remaining before
the country will go dry for good.
Formal denial was issued from the
headquarters of the Anti-Saloon
league that its officers would take
part in any movement calculated to
delay the treaty. League officers
stuck to the opinion that it would be
necessary first to ratify the Austrian
treaty before lifting the wartime
prohibition ban, which was said to
have been the ruling of Attorney
General Palmer, and they declared
their position was not altered by the
fact that President Wilson was pre
pared to cut legal doubt and wipe
out a law the necessity for which he
believas to have passed.
With today's action by the senate
the department of justice is ready to
deal with any offenders against the
drastic provisions of the new act.
At best, heretofore prosecutions were
more or less haphazard, and ; neces
sarily so, it was said, because of the
loosely drawn language of the act,
but the new law gh"es ample means
of breaking up the traffic.
So drastic is the enforcement act
that a man, for instance, may be
fined or put in jail for displaying the
picture of a brewery or a keg, but
his' right to store liquor in his own
home for his own ' use' stood up
against all attacks in committee and
both houses of congress.
President Able To I

WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. Presi
dent Wilson continued -to improve to
day and so satisfied was Rear Ad
miral Grayson with his condition that
he was permitted to transact some
executive business in addition to
the prohibition enforcement - bill,
which he vetoed late in the day.
Soon after breakfast the president
asked Dr. Grayson that Secretary
Tumulty be called and that some
pardon cases which were awaiting
executive action be given him. Ha
acted on the latter at once and alsc
signed some minor bills that had
accumulated at the White House
during the past few days.

STATE LABOR
r
Resolution Passed Repudiat
ing His Administration, De
manding That He Resign;
Secretary Is Also Accused
PHOENIX, Ariz., Oct 28 The
Arizona State Federation of Labor
passed a resolution at its eighth an
nual convention here today condemn
ing President Thomas J. Croaff and
Secretary George D. Smith for al
leged sympathy with the I. W. W.,
repudiating their administration and
demanding their resignations. The
resolueion was passed by a vote of
42 to 17.
Croaff and Smith said' tonight they
would not resign and several of those
endorsing ' the resolution stated it
was unlikely any further steps to
compel their resignations would be
taken, as the principal object of the
conservative element in the conven
tion had been attained in placing
that body on recoil. .
The resolution charges Croaff and
Smith with having attacked the
American Federation of Labor,
Samuel Gompers, its president, and
with having discredited' that labor
movement in Arizona.
The resolution was under discus
sion almost the entire day and the
speeches for and against it were at
times bitterly personal. Croaff
charged Thomas A. French of Oat
man with a falsehood and French
retaliated with a like accusation.
It was said that the report of a
committee appointed to investigate
the operation of the Arizona Labor
Journal, the official organ of the fed
eration, would be considered tomor
row. Leaders of the conservative
element said they would demand a
change in the policy of this paper
and the appointment of a new editor
to succeed John Scholtz. It was
charged several times during the de
bate today that Croaff and Smith
had used the labor journal to dissem
inate propaganda favorable to the
I. W. W. and attacking the American
Federation of Labor and Mr. Gomp
ers. The committee on resolutions was
expected to report tomorrow on the
resolution introduced by Smith dur
ing a lull in the debate today making
numerous charges against President
Wilson, including his alleged "deser
tion of the principles for which this
country went to war" and his "wag
ing a private war against the work
ers of Russia" and demanding the
immediate withdrawal of American
troops from Russia and tho recogni
tion by the United States government
of the Russian soviet government.
Conservatives expressed confidence
this resolution would not be favor
ably reported and said if it was it
would be voted down by a large ma
jority. Legion Band Holds

Many Families Attend
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28. Both
houses of congress paused in their
work today to greet the king of the
Belgians, his consort and their son.
It was the first visit of a king to the
capitol, and the law-makers of the na
tion gave a cordial welcome to, the
democratic soldier-ruler of Europe's
pluckiest little state.
King Albert is not given to long
speeches. His address, first in the
senate and then in the house, made
scarcely six hundred words, but in
them he gave the American army
credit for assuring victory in the war,
paid homage to the fallen, and ex
tended his sympathy to the wounded.
He expressed hi3 admiration for the
United States, acknowledged the
debt of the makers of Belgium's con
stitution to those who framed that of
this country, predicted that the ties
binding the two nations never would
be broken, and offered thanks to all
the Americans who aided his people
in the war.
- - There wo-b U1s oomonlal in-thc
visit to congress, but there was no
mistaking the warmth of the greeting
given the royal Belgians and the
earnestness of the kine in his ad
dress was evident. The galleries
were crowded. Justices of supreme
court, senators and spectators rose
and applauded vigorously as the tall,
erect figure of the king strode down
the aisle beside Senator Lodge. Be
hind him came the prince, escorted
by Senator Hitchcock.
A few moments later the hand
clapping changed to cheers as Queen
Elizabeth, gowned in white and wear-
ing a wine colored cloak of velvet,
appeared in the executive gallery trains would be operated in some
with the wife of Vice President manner. That official took the attl

per house forgot their dignity in their ; would make it incumbent upon the
admiration for the little woman who grand lodcre of officers of the train
had followed her husband through the men's brotherhood to fill then laces

The king was escorted to a seat be-' '
side Senator Cummins, who was pre
siding as president pro tem, and who
greeted him with high praise for his
moral courage and his gallantrty on
the field. Prince Leopold was seafed
on his father's right Grouped about

only on ceremonial occasions, were
Lieut. Gen. Baron Jacques, one of
Belgium's greatest military leaders.

Albert was Interrupted more than
once by applause during his brief ad
dress and there was another demon
stration of approval when he had fin
ished. Later he and his son met the
senators Individually.
The scene in the house was a repe
tition of that in the senate. On the
floor were the children of manv of
the members and their cheers were
as enthuslasttic as those or tftelr
fathers. The king was Piehtd before

mands presented to the railroad ad
ministration's board of wages and

would go into effect without negotia

from the city and the opposing ex
pressions left the strike situation in
secure. Some local officials of the brother
hood lodges said no strike would be
entered into hastily, and that the out-
1 come of conferences Mr. Lee was to
have tomorrow with Director General
Hines of the railroad -administration
and other railroad officials would be
united.
Other brotherhood officials could
not be found tonight, and the exact
status of the strike call seemed un
certain,' notwithstanding the an
nouncement made in reports yester
day that the strike would go into ef
fect Thursday, unless the demands,
including a minimum wage of $150 a

New Automobile Is
Destroyed by Fire
A new 7-passenger Jordan car be
longing to A. Jordan of Benson, was
destroyed by fire yesterday just
across the divide on the Tombstone
road. With the machine at the time
of the accident were Jordan and two
passengers.
According to reports which were
brought to Bisbee last evening, a
small accident bad; happened to the
gasoline feed line and the car was
stopped while an investigation was
made. During the examination, the
cap was taken from the gas tank to
ascertain whether all the gasoline
had leaked away. While the cap
was off. one of the passengers,
standing some distance from the car,
lighted a match and a small piece

OPERATIONS OF
TOLD IN COURT
Get-Rich-Quick - Wallingford
Methods of Alleged Swind
ler Who Is Suinf State
Banks Outlined by Attorney
Of special interest to bankers and
business men in general throughout
Arizona ia the account published be
low of the alleged Get-Rich-Quick-Wallingford
operations of the Pan
Motor company, thirteen officials of
which are now on trial in Chicago
on charges of using the mails to de
fraud in (he sale of $7,000,000 worth
of stock of the corporation.
Principal among the thirteen offi
- oials under indictment is Samuel D.
Pandolfo. who is plaintiff in a $1,
000.000 libel suit scheduled for trial
in the federal court at Tucson in the
near future, in which between fifty
and sixty Arizona banks, comprising
practically every bank in the state,
are the defendants. Pandolfo acted
as president ana general manager
of the company, and also as fiscal
apent, in which capacity he is said to
have "cleaned up" a cool million and
a 1'alf in commissions in a period of
two years.
Pandolfo's suit against the Ari
zona banks grows out of a letter
sent to the annual Arizona State
Bankers' convention several years
ago on the Indicted man's alleged
Wallingford tactics, by a New Mex
ico banker. The secretary of the
Arizona Bankers' association read
the letter to the conventionfi, and
it was incorporated in the minutes
as' so "read, subsequently being pub
lished as -having been read- to the
convention. Pandolfo then brought
suit against the banks for damages,
charging that he had been libeled.
Pandolfo is widely known for sis
stock operations throughout the
southwest. He at one time operated
In Texas in the insurance business,
and is alleged to have been barred
from that state by the state insur
ance commission. He lived in Phoe
nix for a while, but is said to have
met with a more or les3 cold recep
tion in his stock selling projects in
this state.
The deefndant Arizona banks and
business men throughout the state
are now watching with interest the
progress of the trial in Chicago of
the man who accuses these banks of
libeling ' him, but who now faces
charges of illegal practices in New
Mexico, from which state the alleged
"libel"- emanated. : The following
Associated Press dispatch is of inter
est as reviewing the alleged mal
operations with which Pandolfo and
his confederates are charged:
CHICAGO. Oct. 24. Hearing of
testimony in the trial of thirteen
officials of the Pan-Motor company,
charged with using the mails to de
fraud in the sale .of $7,000,000 worth
of stock of the corporation will be
gin tomorrow morning before Fed
eral Judge Landis. .
Counsel for both sides submitted
Iheir opening statements to the jury
today. More than 100 witnesses
have been subpoenaed and it is ex
pected that the trial will last two
months.
S. It. Rush of Omaha, special pros
ecutor, today outlined the . govern
ment's case. Attorney Rush said he
first heard of the defendants as in
several citi.es ia New Mexico in 1916,
where i two' of the officials of the
company called meetings and offered
to sell shares of stock to the public.
Samuel D. Pandolfo and H. S. Wigle,
he said, appeared at the New Mexi
can meeting ip.s representatives of
the company.
"The scheme was to build a large
plant for the manufacture of auto
mobiles and farm tractors," said At
torney Rush. "Shares of stock of the
par value of $5 were sold for $10 with
the understanding that half of the
receipts were to be deposited in the
treasury of the company.
"In New Mexico the promoters ex
hibited an automobile which they
said the company proposed to sell
for $500 each and make a profit ofi
$50 per car. The promoters saidj
30,000 cars were to be sold the fol-j
lowing year."
Attorney Rush said that after op
erating In New Mexico for awhile, :
the promoters moved to Cheyenne,
Wyo.. where they continued thetr ac
tivities. Later in the same year,
headquarters, of the promoters was.
moved to Chicago. "A tractor was;
built which the promoters exhibited!
at Kansas City, Denver, Des Moines
and other; cities in the west to aid
Ihe stock selling1 campaign," said,
Attorney Rush. "The government j
has evidence that it cost the pro
moters $7000 .to assemble "that first;
Iractor which the company was to
sell for $1495. I
"In 1917 the company had ten auto-
mobiles assembled by an Indianapo
lis firm for use in selling stock. The
company itself did not build a car,
that year. In 1918 the company man
ufactured 250 motor cars at a loss!
of $50,000."
Attorney Rush told of a contract
which Pandolfo entered into with
the Pan-Motor company, by which
he became Its fiscal agent, and re
ceived 25 per cent commission for
advertising.
Under these contracts Pandolfo is
said to have received during 1916
and 1917. $1,000,000 in currency and
$500,000 worth of stock out of the
proceeds for the sale of the stock.!
After May 27. It is saia, ranaoiro
received an average of $25,000 a
month for the stock Belling cam
paign which was carried on in nearly
every state west of the Mississippi
river.
"MY ADVICE TO MY DAUGHTER"

Keep Up to Date People Who Live in the Past Grow Old in Spirit if Not in Body
BY KITTY GORDON
Dear Vera:
The old-time days when a woman
didn't know anything about baseball
or politics and only read the society
and horn .' cooking departments in the
daily newspapers, are dead and bur
ied. Today is the day of the wideawake
alert, keen woman who is as familiar
with affairs of the moment as any
man and who is just as able to talk
intelligently on literature, the stage,
or international affairs as anybody
Remember this, my dear, and what
ever else you do keep right up-to-date.
The best way to keep up-to-date
and to know what's doing and why
It's doin. is by reading the daily
newspapers! Read them thoroughly,
and if there's anything In them you
don't understand, find out, about it
by consulting the public library.
Pay particular attention to the
business departments in the paper.
Every woman nowadays must: be
more or less of a business woman.
If she is a housewife she has to be
n good business woman to make her
household money buy the most It 13
possibly capable in these days of
high prices. If she is an office
worker she has to be familiar with
business routine, with the methods
of filing correspondence and many
other details of business. If she is
on the screen she must be familiar
with contracts and all that sort of
stuff. So you see, my dear, how es
sential it for a modern woman to be
familiar with business operations.
Keeping up-to-date, keeps one
young.too. People who continually
live in the past, who are always re
miniscing about the dear old dayB,

rapidly lose interest in the present.
And, once having lost interest in the
present, one soon comes to feel that
the best of life has been lived. And
that means that you're getting very,
very old in spirit if not in body.
Keep up-to-date. It is one of the
very best ways to get the utmost out
of life.
Your devoted mother,
KITTY.
(In her next letter Miss Gordon
will advise her daughter "Don't be
cynical but watch your step.")

JUST AND THRIFTY
IN unusual instance of hewing to the exact line of justice, com-,
bined with a remarkable example o f thrift, is found in the.
case of an Indiana magistrate.
John H. Sayre is a justice of the peace at Wabash. One fine
day he detected himself in the act of speeding. Being severely cog
nizant of infractions of the law on the part of others, Justice Sayre
could, of course, condone no violation by himself.
Witnessing the astonishing spectacle of Justice Sayre breaking
a statute which very often Justice Sayre had upheld from the bench,
Justice Sayre produced the arrest of Justice Sayre and notified him
to appear in Justice Sayre's court. Justice Sayre swore to the com
plaint against Justice Sayre and filed it in the court of Justice Sayre.
Justice Sayre directed his own constable to serve the warrant con
sequent upcn the complaint.
Justice Sayre accepted the defendant's cognizance and permitted
himseif to go at largo until time for trial. Manifestly, Justice- Sayre
had uncommon confidence in the honasty and uprightness of Justice
Sayre, else he certainly would have demanded a bond or cash baiL.
At any rate, Justice Sayre appeared before himself in due time, and
fined himself $10 and costs. The fine and costs were promptly paid.
No one will deny that this is impartial Justice impartially ad
ministered. And now for thrift exemplified. By incurring costs' in his own
court end by paying a fine in hi3 own court, Justice Sayre was en
titled to the fees incidental to both costs and fine. He colletced a
charge for issuing the complaint and warrant in the first place, a
second for hearing the case, and a third fpr recording the judgment.
Thus it will be seen that Justice Sayre saved a considerable part of
the money he paid to himself.
CONSTRUCTIVE BANKING PROGRAM
BANKERS these days are racking their brains how to improve
the service their institutions are rendering the community.
There is no line of business or community service that Is so
highly organized to help the public today as banking.
Bankers are studying how to reach out the helping hand to
legitimate enterprises and efforts at community building.
While there is strife between capital and labor, largely fomented
by labor agitators, there can be no free movement of capital into
Industrial development. But there is a constructive line bankers are
taking thought upon,' and that is the encouragement of capital going
into the housing situation.
During the war period all building not absolutely necessary was
discouraged and there is today a shortage of at least a million homes
in our country. This means that a thousand million dollars must go
into new houses, or on an average of sixty million dollars in each
Btate, and banks much furnish the capital.
There are plenty of building lots, plenty of material in' the lum
ber states of the west, and there is going to be plenty of labor this
coming winter unemployed. What better line can banks tajte up
than helping clients with capital or credit, to finance, plan and erect
buildings that are needed by the score in every conynunity?
THE TOWNLEY SENTENCE
IN these days of Reds and Radicalism the sentence of Townley
and Gilbert, North Dakota Non-Partisan leaders, convicted or
the charge of "conspiracy to teach disloyalty." attracts little
attention.
The sentence was for three months each in jail, no alternative
of paying a fine, and sixty days' suspension of their original bait.
Judge Dean, in handing down the decision, threw out the old
fashioned idea that "any organization built on falsehood will not
long endure."
Answering statements from the Non-Partisan League attacking
the integrity of the court and the character of the jury. Judge Dean
said:
"Never in the history of the jury system was a more honest and
impartial jury empaneled in any criminal case.
"It isoutrageous that any person who was present and saw this
farmer jury should accuse ihose men of dishonesty.
"It apepars taht no one connected with the trial was pure and
undefiled except the defendants and those associated with them."
These political leaders should be allowed to quietly serve their
trms and then go at some honest work for a living.
RASCALS FALL OUT
THE reported arrest ot rremier L,enine oy oraer ot ms war min
ister, Trotzky. has not been confirmed, but it is by no means
improbable. That these two eminent rascals have been at
swords' points for some time is undisputed, Lenine recently
has become converted to the view that terrorism is weakening the
Bolshevist grip on Russian affairs. Trotzky has stoutly defended
any extreme necessary to keep the grip unrelaxed.
Discord between the premier and his subordinate developed
some months ago. The successes of the anti-Bolshevist forces caused
' the pair to compose their differences to some extent, but all advices
from European centers agreed that an open rupture would not be
long delayed. Lenine's moderatsm has been seized upon by Trotzky
as a pretext for the accusation that the premier is at heart a traitor
to the cause or the "proletariat."
Both Trotzky and Lenine are scoundrels, but in scoundrelism
Trotzky has several shades the better of his official superior. If
Trotzky actually has gained the mastery in Russia the world can
expect a series or multiplied horrors in that unhappy section of the
globe.

There's wailing now in Brewery Gulch,
And curses loud and strong.
And men and women gnash Iheir teeth
And sing a vengeful song;
Each brow is dark with mournful gloom,
There's crepe on each hat,'
And woe betide the sinful pup
That murdered Twomey's cat!
They tiptoe past the famous hall
Where Tabby ;;es in state,
And, looking at her still, cold form,
Give vent to all their hate.

Although good folk, at that,
But they're going to get the Boston bull
That chewed up Twomey's cat!
UNIVERSITY FOOTBALL STAR !
IS KILLED NEAR TUCSON
TUCSON, Oct. 28. While . hunting
on the Mascot road with friends Sun
day morning, Gail Lewis, one of the
most popular young men of the Uni
versity of Arizona, came to his death
in a most tragic manner, by the acci
dental discharge of his shotgun.
Early in the morning a party -consisting
of Walter Pusch, Ed .Belton.
Carol Rhoades, Herbert -Askims and
Lewis left on a hunting trip, and
went in the direction of Mammoth.
All went, well until the party became
broken up.
When the party again collected
Lewis was not in it, and a search for
him disclosed the tiagedy. 1
None of the others was near when
the accident happened, but account
for it in the following manner:
Lewis had wounded a bird, and it
had flown into a bush. On attempt
ing to extricate the bird from the
underbrush with his gun, the piece
was discharged, killing him instant
ly. The body was taken to Mam
moth, and later brought to Tucson.
The remains were taken to Phoenix
last night, where interment will be
made Wednesday or Thursday. Ar
rangements are pending word from
his sister.
He is survived by his mother, Mis.
H. M. Lewis, of 807 N. First street,
Phoenix, Arizona; a married siuer,
and an aunt, who resides in Lang
Beach, Calif. His uncle, C. W. Peter
son, came to accompany the remains
to his mother's home.
Lewis was a member of the Sigma
Phi l'eta fraternity before joiniug
the army.
The letter is signed by O. S. Stapley,
Donald McQueen, J.' W. Davis. J. C.

FLAUNTED in a parade of New York radicals, which later came
into collision with the police, with the result that a number
of heads were cracked and a number of arrests were made,
was one banner whose exhortation will find insstant and gen
eral approval, with the wish that it may be carried into immediate
effect.
"Deport us all to Soviet Russia!" So read this particular bail
ner. '
Seeing that Soviet Russia id the place Tor them, these marchers
should be taken at their word. If. by the time all these aliens are
. rounded; up there . is no Soviet Russia Lenine and Trotzky have
fallen out, the latter has had the former arrested and Sovietisni in
Russia is a notch nearer To its inevitable collapse still Russia, as
the home ol mont of these trouble-makers, can be Torced to take them
back.
But at any rate, deport them. Back to the lands overseas which
spewed them upon the New World.

PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 23. Up with'much haste this morning, due to the cold, which
made me to shiver and shake as soon as I opened my eyes. To town early,
where I found all my friends laughing at me because I have a lawn mower,
;;nd truth to tell, what I will do with It in Bisbee I know not, although 1
have been thinking that L may take it to Douglas and cut the grass off the
sueeis.. To Brewery Gulch, where I saw the murder of Mr. Twomey's cat,
which came as & surprise, for at first I thought she would frighten him ofr,
she sitting on his noseband tie whining for help, but he shook her off and,
as they say in Hoboken, "finis le guerre." To Lowell, where I heard a merry
tele about a sexton in a graveyard, and about two mighty hunters, who
came mighty near shooting something in the mountains, but did not. Back
to town early, and I tried to get some root beer from my friends of the two
large mugs, but.shae had none, and so to the hotel, where Mr. Foster spun
seme yarns of Bisbee, and then back to the cigar stand, where I heard
Mrs. Cunningham and Miss Rainey arguin? about a striped waist which the
fcimer wore. To the company offices, where I spoke to Mr. Lyman about
some mining news, which he is very good to give me, and which looks well
in the paper, but more pleased to se my good looking friend back there,'
rnd I hope she sees this. Mr: Goodrich back from his vacation, which will
help me, and I very glad to see him. A long story from the cashier about
Juarez, with murder, robbery and sudden death all bound up in the same
tale, which made the boss and me smile behind our hands, although too
polite to laugh while listening. But the cashier, much insistent about how
Beautiful the women are in Texas, and I think he Is a good judge. To the
office, where the work seemed easy because of the Goodrich, and some
hearty grins Q had at the headlines the telegraph editor writes, he being
a humorous soul, and witty withal. And so to bed, well pleased at finding
another blanket on the bed, but worrying over that condemned lawn mower.
CHILDREN 0' MINE
By EDMUND VANCE COOKE.
There's something about them! those children of mine!
Which a fellow like me finds it hard to define.
For the fact is, I never was much of a dab
At showing such things through a gift of the gab.
And in praising my own well, I never did shine,
But there's something about them! those children o
mine!
I don't for a moment suppose or assert
That the bunch of them has enough beauty to hurt,
Nor am I intending at all to maintain ; ;
Any one of 'em's got a twelve-cylinder brain.
They're the straight human stock of the staple design.
But there's something about them! those children ot
mine!
When you live with a kid from its first kitten cry
To the time when it levels you, eye against eye.
When it's meat of your marrow and joint of your bone,
And its goodness and badness are part of your own,
Then your likely to swear by your fig-tree and v;ne,
"There's something about them! those children of mine!
And maybe it's fancy, but maybe, you know.
There's a symbol in that for us creatures below.
That if there's a Father of All, he'll forget
How far we fall short of the standards we set,
And he'll say, with charity truly divine, .
"There's something about them! those Children of Mine-"

BY REVIEW LEASED WIRE
STOCKS VND BONDS
NEW YORK, Oct. 28. Trading in
stocks today was governed almost en
tirely by the erratic changes m the
money market. Call loans opened at
7 per cent, just ha.lt of yesterday's
maximum, but rose steadily to 16 per
cent in the last 15 minutes, dropping
to 6 per cent; the day's lowest rate, at
the close.
Speculative issues wvre again taken
in hand by bull pools in the early and
intermediate periods, tlading reflect
ing greater confidence and breadth.
General Motors eclip,sed all other
issues, making an extreme advance of
30 points to a new high of 390, react
ing to 371, but rallying in the final
dealings' with a net gain of 24 points.
Affiliated shares, such as Chandler,
Stutz, Studebaker, White, . Pierce Ar
row, United States Rubber, and Good
rich, were 3 to 7 points higher at their
maximums, but some of Utese gains
were largely or entirely cancelled
when the market reacted.
Republic? Iron shared the day's
honors with General Motors, rising
12 points "to the new maximum of
121, but forfeiting-3 points under
pressure. Related equipments and
steels were 2 to 6 points up at their
best, but eased with oil and food

likelihood that the improved weather
would stimulate husking and shelling.
Bearish sentiment was noticeably
checked, however, by higher quota
tions on hogs and by the fact that re

the actual attitude of producers in re

a noticeable extent with the power of
the market to rally.
Oats sympathized with the weak

very constipated. I had sour stomach
and was bo uncomfortable. I went to
the doctor. He gave me some pill.
They weakened me and seemed to
tear up my digestion. They would
gripe me and afterwards It eeemed
I was more constipated than before.
I heard of Black-Draught and de
elded to try it. I found It just what I
needed. It was an easy laxative, and
not bad to swallow. My digestion soon
Improved. I got well of the sour stom
ach, my bowels soon seemed formal,
no more griping, and I would take a
dose now and then, and was In good
shape.
I cannot say too much for Black.
Draught for It Is the finest laxative
one can use."

Tanlac, and when I had finished the
second bottle my appetite had come
back, and for the first time in ten
long years I could eat a hearty meal
without suffering afterwards. I have
just finished my fifth bottle and I
can truthfully say that I am as well
and strong as I ever was in my life.
We own and live on our own ranch,
and I am going right ahead putting
up my fruit all by myself. I never
have a sign of stomach trouble or
indigestion, and I can eat just any
thing I want. My nerevs;are in
perfect condition, aud oh, how I en
joy the sweet, restful sleep I get ev
ery night. I really don't see how my
health could be any better, and as
sure as I stand here now, I owe it all
to Tanlac. I am under lasting ob
ligations to this wonderful medicine,
and feel it my duty to give this state
ment so that I may help others who
suffer as I did."

iMrs. Meyers Gains Twenty-one
Pounds Taking Tanlac
Troubles End.
"I have gainey twenty-one pounds
actual weight since I commenced
taking Tanlac, and the troubles that
have been causing me to suffer for
ten long years have been completely
overcome," said Mrs. Merthe 'Meyers,
who lives at Lankershim, Cal., while
in the Owl Drug Store in Los An
geles the other day.
"When I think, of the great good
Tanlac has done me," continued Mrs.
Meyers, "I actually yearn to tell
everybody in the world about it, es
pecially those who suffer as I did.
I had an aggravated case of stomach
trouble which had been pulling me
down for years, and finally gotten
the best of me. My condition was
so bad for a long time that I had
to live on a milk diet, and never
dared touch anything else. Even
this light diet would cause gas to
form and I would be perfectly misar
able for hours afterwards. My
nerves , were in terrible condition,
and it was out of the question for
me to get a good night's sleep. My
husband spent hundreds of dollars
for medicine and treatments, but 1
Just kept on going down hill all the
time. Specialist after specialist
treated me, and one by one they told
ino that my cyse was hopeless. I
was so blue and discouraged over
my condition that I just felt like giv
ing up altogther.
"I was looking over the paper one
night and I noticed a statement about
Tanlac, and when I told my husband
that I had a notion to try this medi
cine, he laughed and said, 'Well, I
don't suppose it will hurt you, any
way, and if you want to try it I will
get you a bottle.' Well, I commenced
taking Tanlac then, and to my great
surprise I felt a change for the bet
ter before I had finished that first

And Alleged Owner
A white miile still and two bar
rels of mash, believed by the ar
resting officers to be the property
of Charles Bentlley. notorious as a
witness for the I. W. W. in the de
portation cases and who is also
known as a member of that organi
zation, was captured late Monday
night in the Johnson addition. The
raid on the quarters where the still
was made by J. A.- Kempton, chief
of police; A. E. Sheppard, constable,
and Frank Salmon, special police
man.
"When the house was . raided there
was no one on the premises, but
an investigation pointed to Bentley
as the probable owner of the still,
and he was arrested by Constable
Sheppard and turned over to the
government officials, who will con
tinue the investigation.
Bentley Is declared to have been
in trouble before, and is now under
a charge of vagrancy which was to
have been tried soon. He is also
declared to have been charged with
wife beating and with sundry otBer
infractions of the law.
Cochise counly is lo be ' re-districted
on December 2 in conformity with
the amendment .to the state constiiu
lion v.-hic-h was adopted on Nov. 5.
191S. This announcement, was made
yesterday. Thr le-di.st rioting will bn
done by I he board of county super
visors.
The counly is to be divided Into
seven legislative disiticls, each oi
which will be entitled to choose ai
representativ in tho legislature at'
the 1J20 election. 1
The new law dees not give Cochise
county a larger representation than
under the old order, although this
has happened in the case of Mari
copa county. "Each district here will
contain approximately 1500 . votes,
and the districts are to be deter-,
iniriod by tho qumber of votes cast I
for governor 'by all political parties!
at the general election of November,
1919. I
It is believed that the new law will
work to great ' advantage. , Hereto-1
