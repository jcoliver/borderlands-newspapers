visions are hurried forward to take
the place oi exhausted units. The al
lied airmen are doing splendid work,
harrassing the German reiiiloreemcnts
and supply columns by making at
tacks from low altitudes with macnine
suns. The German aviators are very
numerous in this region and aer!a)
combats are oceuring constantly.
In the central part ot the battle
front the enemy, finding that before
him were only tired troops which had
fought day and night since Monday,
was able to make another leap far
ward toward to the Marne by pene
trating the thin allied line with small
bodies of reltcted men anm?d with
lisbt'niachine guns.
. Infantry Engagement
The battle has now developed al
most purely into an infantry fight. The
artillery in action appears to be oiiiv
of about the same amount as is usual
on a quiet sector.
South of Soissor.s the enemy 'at
tempted a renewal of his push, but
came in contact with French troops,
which thrust him back, notwithstand

The French here executed a vigor

great contusion and loss to German
battalions and made the enemy hesi

Flames Engulf Wounded Fatients
WITH THE BRITISH ARMY IN FRANCE. May ?,1 ( By The Asso
ciated Press . Early Thursday ' morning German airman bombed a.n
cther hospital this" time a Canadian institution and exac ted a con
siderable toll of casualties. Antoic those killed by the explosion or
flames was an American medi'-ai efficer who was administering an
anesthetic to a British oiricer in the operating room. The raid oc
curred at 12:30 o'clock in the morning.
The hospital attacked was a large erne ynd was marked by huge
Red Cross signs. The German ainnen. working partly by the light of
the moon, dropped four bombs ueai the hospital and. then not appar
ently able to sec exactly where they were hitting, lighted a brilliant
flare to illuminate the surroundings.
As the place was lighted up hy the flare they released another
bomb or two v. hich dropped squarely on a large wing of the hospital.
Part of the wim; was demolished and many persnns were killsd and
wounded when the building co-lapsed and buried them. The demol
ished wing caught fire and burned fiercely with many victim? s;!l
pinned in the wreckage.
Nothing more awful has occurred in the annals of the hospital
service sir.ee the war began. Every available person In the neighbor
hood was railed out to assist in the rescue work. With tne assist
ance or ladders and other fire ipparatus. the hospital proper was
promptly emptied of patients and personnel. It was a desperate sit
uption. A roaring furnace represented what was left of the big wim.
Many unconscious forms were carried out by heroic men wh:
risked their lives to reach them. Excellent work on the part oi the
firemen finally resulted in the fire being extinguished, nut there were
still many victims, including more than one sister, bulled, in the ruins.
There was no hope that they were alive.

LONDON. May 31. A statement
given o The Associated Press tonight
by a hUH military authority, expres
sive of the opinion of the British gen
eral staf? of the situation on the west
ern front says:
"The i lain German offensive ha.c
been direc ted toward Chateau Thierry
and Dormans. The Germans hare
reached the bank of the Marne on a
front of ten miles from a point west
of Cha con Thierry to Dormans.
"Th'have not captured Chatea-i

ily an.l o the northv ad.
Rheims Situation Unknown
They s.Jready have captured Sois
sons, they extended their attack north
west to Noyon and forced the Frenc h
back, so that the line now runs almost
straight from Noyon to Soissons.
"Around Rheims the position is
somewhat obscure. Probably the Ger
mans already have entered Rheims.
"The French reported yesterday
thai the sllied line had retired to th
south of the canal near Rheims. lm'
that this morning there was news that
the British were resisting north of
the city. The new deyelopment Is
that the German attempt is to ex
tend tho attack east of Rheims. where
they were reported attacking last
night, but no further details have ye:
been received.
Use Every Resource
"The Germans have thrown in every
resource in an effort to widen the
salient tn which they find themselves
by attacking its flanks, hut on the
heights ef the west of Sionsons. the
French are resisting well while the
British r. making a stand soutn and
southwest Rheims. These efforts
thus far have held the German salient
to a narrow width.
"The situation is very anxiorj. not
only beoause the Germans have made
such rapid progress an advance of 2'
miles in four days but also because
they st'M have such large reserves
available to be thrown in at any point.
"The Germans big at'ack began en
May 27, wiih about thirty divisions on
a front of iw miles from rternierlcrv"
to I.euilly This front was held bv
seven ailied divisions, of which three
British were on the right and four
French on the left.
Both Armies Fall Back

which appeared to nave ben very ef
fective !: cutting our wire, the Ger
mans assaulted. Thev overran the
French front lines. The British heM
their second line at first, but eventu
ally were compelled to fall baric to con

sitions hole, with three divisions com
manding th river crossings.

reason to hope that Germany will noe
make any further progress at this

HEAVY ARTILLERY
ENABLES TEUTONS
TO EXTEND LINES
(Continued from Pace One)
ited by the correspondent, the officers
are full of confidence that the battle
soon will turn in favor of the allies,
notwithstanding the present great su
periority of the German effectives. The
spirit o.' the allied troops is marvelous
under these circumstances. The cor
respondent saw French and Bruis'i
battalions who had just come out ol
the terrible struggle, singing along
the road, in spite of their exhaustion.
A story just at hand, tells the heroic
conduct of three French battalions
which were surrounded in the forest
of Pinon Monday. They entrenched
themselves. Succor could not be sent
to them. Their rifles and machine
guns were heard for many hours. The
last message from them came Tues
day afternon at 2 o'cIock by carrier
pigeon. It said they would hold out
until the last.. It is probable that
when their ammunition became ex
hausted the survivors were captured.
GERMAN ATTACKS REPULSED
PARIS. May 31. German attacks on
Fiench positions on the right bank of
the Ailette river have been repulsed.
The Germans have reached the
Marne. light detachments having pen
etrated as far as the river between
Charteves and Jautgonne.
On the right flank or the battle area
the situation is unchanged, which also
is the condition west and north of
Uhcims, according to the official bul
letin issued by the war office tonight.
The statement reads.
"On our left wing in the region I
the lower Ailette the Germans have
continued their pressure during the
course of the day. Our troops have
broltn all enemy attacks iu the region
' Bleiar.court and west of this local
it.. The enemy who had succeeded in
cruecise the Oise east cf Sempigny
was repulsed on the right bank of the
river.
Bar Progress Near Soissons
The principal effort of the enemy
has been In the sector of .Soissons and
turther to ilia south in tne direction
r,t Neuilly St. Front. To tne west 01
boissons our troops have delivered vig
orous counter attacks and have
answered all the enemy's efforts, in
flicted very severe losses. Th" ene.v.y
was unable to make any progress.
in tne center weak German forces
have reached the north bank ot tne
iViarne between Charteves and Jourl
gonne. On our right the situation is
unchanged as well as to the northwest
tnd to the north o: Khein:s.
Eastern theater, May 2'). Grern
troops supported by trench armory
attacked enemy positions of great
strength on Srka Oi Legeu soutn cl
the Struma. Over the whole of thj
lrout cf the attack which measures 12
kilometers and to a depth of two
kilometers the infantry captured ;u
the first rush the first position of the
enemy, reaching all of tneir objectives
and passing them at certain points,
iiie enemy reacted strongly with vio
lent artillery fire west of Srka Di
Yegen. More than 1,500 prisoners.
Bulgarians and Germans, including
thirty-three officers have been counted
up to the present.
"War material has fallen into our
hands. The Greek troops and the
French soldiers which were cooper
ating with them have shown the finest
spirit in spite of unlavorable atmos
jineric conditions.
"The aerial forces took an active
part in the battle, using their machine
tuns at a low altitude on the Bulgar
ian reserves."
HUNS FOR COUNTER PUSH
WITH THE FRENCH ARMIES IN
FRANCE, May 31 (By The Associated
Press). While continuing their strong
pressure on the center of their line,
the Germans today began a violent
diversion on the western wing alou;?
the Ailette river, where they auvanced
ntarly five miles. The reason for thu
new push probably is because the
Germans feared a counter attack in
that region that might endanger his
forces now contained within the buls
in? salient where the enemy pro
gressed during the first day.
The allies those to recede, leaving
iu the possession of the Germans a
patch of territory approximately
-(retching from the extreme limit of
Varescs, on the Oise, passing by Bler
eucourt to Epagny.

combats of extreme eviuence todxy

region the resistance of the French
dnisions was the absolute acme .f j
heroism, fighting as they were against ,
odds immensely superior.
All the. men seemed to know that
where they retire i is simply for
stragetic purposes. They say:
"We may be told soon to hold linn
fnd we will do it."
The tame is true throughout the
forces which are .retiring.

LONON. May 31. Reuter's corre
spondent at French headquarters, tele
graphing Friday morning, say.
"The ries no sign of relaxation in
the German pressure. On his right,
in spite of gallant resistance, the
enemy has been able to push out his
line north and south of Soissons on
toth Rides of the Aisne. In the center
his advanced parties are still progress j

can find a weak spot in the thinly held
French line."

tofore. They are using trench mortars
iu large numbers for wire cutting.
"The Germans had prepared for an
attack on this part of the line for a
long time, constructing the necessary
gun emplacements and assembly
places so that our aircraft did not ob
serve any construction of new trenches
or emplacements just before the at
tack. Initial Success Expected
"Under the conditions which pre
vailed in the region of the Cheniin
Oes Dailies, an initial success could
hardly oe prevented. Nor can it be
preveiit;.M anywhere there are not ade
quate reserves immediately available.
"The al!is have thse disadvantages:
first the are inferior in numbers;
second, they are actcing on exterior
lines; third, they have made vulner-
able points; fourth, north or tne
me, they h2-e little footway in which
to maneuver.
"! is not fair to blame the high
command when the allies have inher
ently an unfavoraine strategic posi
tion. If it is said that the hign com
mand placed three tired British di-
ulcus cr. an exposed part of the front,
it must be remembered that this disp
sition was made with full agreement
of the British headquarters.
Exhaust Effeciveness
"Questions such as the bases of sup
plies and communication have to ta
taken :n'.o account in the employment
o? troops. Until fresh reserves of the
Germans have been engaged some
where the situation iust continue anx
ious. "On the other hand, the attack of the
last wse has not been so serious as
on some' other points in the allied ;
line, because we have more room to j
maneuver and can better afford to .-all
back. Another thing that must always ,
be considered is that the eCrmans are j
rapidly using up their effectiveness, j
Thus far they probably have employed
45 divisions in the present attack, ot
whicu 2? have been identified." j
Not Con-.piete Surprise j
1 iMiaiiuu lias uii . i ii. u v
eussed i'.i the past fe wdays
whether!
this Gcru.sn ?'tack was a surprise to
the allies. It cannot be called s. com
plete surprise because ol the fact that
enemy concentrations in the Luuii
area were known, but until a day or
:wo beiore the battle we had no indi
cation that any attack on a big scale
was in'.ended. The Germans deserve
full consideration for
maintaining I
The main
secrecy of their plans. The mam
masses of men were brought up to the

the attack, which was preceded by
only twj hours of bombardment for
the purpose of cuting wire cntanglo

the Bam-j use of artillery as heretofore.
They ar.i using trench mortars iu large

That Wobbly Picture of Hunt
Rises Like Eanquo's Ghost
Legislative correspondence from Phoe
nix sent to several Arizona dailies throws
some interesting side lights on the wobbly
issue in the legislature. A recent article
says in part:
The senate was calmer today than yes
terday and the senators in their remarks
were more considerate of their colleagues'
feelings. The I. W. W. organization had
not a single mention during the session and
the Bisbee deportations were referred to
only once.
This was in an aside, by Senator Roberts
to Senator Sutter when it was observed
that Sutter was perusing a copy of "Is
Freedom Dead ?", an I. W. W. publication,
a sequel to one of the pamphlets the federal
government barred from the mails.
"Better look out," laughed Roberts, di
recting his remarks to Sutter, "you'll get
deported from the senate if you read that
sort of literature." Sutter's reply was to
the effect that anyone reading the pam
phlet should be deported from any country.
Incidentally, there was considerable in
terest in the pamphlet, for the reason that
it contained a splendid picture of Governor
Hunt with his arms around two national
I. V. W.'s, one of them Grover H. Perry,
who testified yesterday at the Chicago I.
W. W. trial. An interesting yarn is going
around, relating to the little booklet. As
told about the legislature yesterday, Peter
Robertson, a prominent citizen of Yuma,
who ran for governor on the Socialist ticket
last year, receives without subscription all
publications of the I. W. W. publicity bu
reau. "When the "Is Freedom Dead?"
pamphlet arrived in his mail he took occas
ion to joke Senator Winsor about the atti
tude Governor Hunt was in, being photo
graphed with I. W. W.'s in an attitude of
.endearment toward them.
Senator Winsor, who is quick to see
possibilities, tipped the facts to Leroy Ladd,
who admittedly is Governor Hunt's closest
adviser. It is alleged that Ladd forthwith
made tracks to local I. W. W. headquarters 9
where had been sent a large supply of the
pamphlets, and brought them in. Ladd,
it is said, left the impression that the pam
phlets were to be used as campaign litera
ture. Their acquisition had to do with
politics, but none of the copies was ever
mailed out. As the story runs, they were
used as fuel in cooking morning eggs at the
governor's mansion.
FOR OR AGAINST THE I. W. W.
, (Phoenix Republican)
If this thing keeps on in the legislature
the I. W. W. will be the issue in the demo
cratic state primary campaign. Every dem
ocratic candidate will be forced to take one
side or the other. He cannot satisfy the
people with a broad statement of his patri
otism, his unswerving loyalty to the presi
dent and his hatred of Prussian autocracy.
He will be either for or against the I. W.
W; we mean the I. W. W. as it exists in
Arizona and it is everywhere alike.
If only the I. W. W. as it has been shown
to be in the Chicago trial, were the issue, it
would be no more troublesome than Prus
sianism, but the I. W. W. in Arizona in
cludes many voters, perhaps some thou
sands of voters who are actually members
of that dastardly and criminal organization
and, perhaps, some thousands of others
who lack the nerve to be members.
We suppose some of the candidates will
try to straddle the situation but things are
now so shaping themselves in the legis
lature that that can not be done. Every
candidate must define his position. He
must come out plainly against the I. W. W.
or the voters will assume, as they ought to
assume, that he is for the I. W. W. The
stand he takes against this band of crimi
nal traitors must be taken without reserve,
without qualification and will. out explana
tion. If he is not willing to do that, let him
not prate of loyalty and patriotism.
Monster guns, hidden in pits forty and
fifty feet deep, and 125 to 150 feet apart,
form a labyrinth of defences around Ber
lin, according to John Erickson, a native o.
Sweden. For five years, beginning with
1907, Erickson says he worked on the out
er defences of Berlin and prior to that time
worked for the Motla gun works of Sweden
turning out heavy ordnance for Germany.
. Guns surrounding Berlin, according to
Erickson, range from twenty-two to forty -two
inches in diameter. Many are of the
larger type. Some are over two hundred
feet long. Their foundation is set in seven
feet of solid granite, sunk in the bottom of
the pits in which the guns are hidden, fur
rounding the city. Two circles of these
guns surround Berlin. One is seven miles
from the city's outskirts the other is
eleven. A screen roof is now laid over
these guns. A layer of two feet of dirt
covers the top. Grass, trees and even the
season's crops are planted over them.
Electricity controls the huge guns, Erick
son says. When the guns are needed the
roof may easily be thrown off and the guns
hoisted to position. From the Milwaukee
Leader.
GENERAL LEONARD WOOD.
. I Kansas City Star)
The detachment of Gen. Leonard W ood
from command of the 89th division and hi3
assignment to department duty on the eve
of the expected movement overseas will
not be understood by the country. General
Wdod is the senior major general of the
army. He stands- in the public mind as the
earliest exponent in the army of the pre
paredness policy that is now, after long
delay, reaching its fruition. He has been
on observation and instruction duty in
France, and has recently passed medical
examination and been declared fit for serv
ice. If there are military reasons why Gen
eral Wood should be detained on home
service, some hint of them from Washing
ton would not be out of place. Unless
such explanation is forthcomii.g a veiy
harmful impression is. exceedingly likely
to prevail, for the war department can
not be unaware that the country has been
greatly puzzled by its apparent unwilling
ness to make use of General Woods great
abilities. In the absence of such intima
tion there will be widespread belief that there
were reasons other than miluary and such
a belief will not make for the good 'feel
ing which aH patriotic American hepe inci
pray will prevail.
, When we try to cosider the average Ger
man soldier's viewpoint regarding his
ruthless, cruel and treacherous conduct in
war, we are amazed as well as disgusted
at this sudden degeneracy of the Teuton
as we thought we knew him before the
war. And yet it is not hard to believe all
we hear of the German private when ab
solute authority declares that Prince Eitel,
the kaiser's son, after spending a week in a
Belgian chateau with the duke of Bruns
wick, packed up and carried off all the
dresses of the ladies of the house. And the
German duke of Grcnan, upon leaving
the chateau of Villiers-Notre Dame, took
the silverware and art objects and baby's
dresses with him!
Military opinion differs as to whether
the Germans are trying for Paris this time
or mean to make their real strike at an
other objective. Inasmuch as the crown
prince is in command of the attacking
armies, we venture the gues that anything
gained anywhere in the attack will prove to
be the objective aimed at.
The headline over a news dispatch from
Winona, Minn., says that "Fish are so
plentiful in Minnesota shovels are being
used," in place of lines and nets, to land
them. Instead of fish, however, it turns
out that only carp are so plentiful.
The motor car bandits who held up a
New Jersey traveling man and took him to
the Cliff Drive and robbed him have con
fessed. So, you see, you were all wrong.
The police can catch them, occasionally.
They say that no union painter can fcet
a card or work in Tucson unless he can
show he has subscribed to the last Red
Cross war fund drive.
The Iowa drafted man who was shot in
trying to escape from the army probably
didn't want to go to w-ur fcr kar of bcin
shot.
ECLIPSE OF SUN
TO BE VISIBLE ON
SATURDAY JUNE 8
Sun Will Be Under Shadow of
. Moon About Two Thirty
and Will Remain for Short
Time Only.
LAW REGULATES THE !
OPERATION OF STAGES,1
The Warren district will, on June S.
enjoy the unusual ptivilege ot witness
ins an eclipse of the sun.
To persons living on a narrow path
running trout the extreme north west
ern pan of the United States to the
extreme tx.airiejstern. the eclipse will
be total. To our citizens, the sun will
be abo u two-third.; covered. Not for
M years until 2'U7 v.-ill a similar op
portunity come to the I'nited States,
and not for 3tJ0 years will the states
that are to be favored with the total
eclipse oil JUie S be again so fortu
nate. Total eclipses arc happening
somewhere in the world most of the
time, "wit ihey get all over the world
only about once in every three nnd a
half centuries.
The bi,T black shadow which will
Dc cau.;pci by the moon swinging be
tween trie earth and the nun. will
sweep i '.toss the country at an almost
unbelievable rate of speed. It will cut
a diagonal path across the I'nited
S'ates abcut sixty miles wide, which
will run through parts of Washington,
Oiegon, Idaho, Wyoming, Colorado,
Kansas. Oklahoma, Arkansas, Louis
iana, Mississippi, Alabama and Flor
ida. .
Tha moon's shadow will touch the
earth first at a point in the rncific
ocean southeast of Japan at the little
island of liorodino. It will travel
northeastward until it is about 5ut)
miles south of Alaska, then its course
will be southeastward.
Traveling at the rate of about 2,000
miles an hour, it will strike the Amer
iuan coast at the mouth of the Colum
bia liv i-, the moving shadow then hav
ing traversed about two-third of its
path. Striking the United States at
1:55 p. in., it will reach the Mississippi
valley r.t about 4:37 p. in., central
time, ind will leave the United States
at the cj; st of Florida at 5:4- eastern
ti:ne
The dail.iieps of the tcita! eciir.se will
last alio it Co seconds. Folks on both
sides cf the path will see but a partiil
eclipse, tut pretty much all of the
United plates will get a touch of the
big event. Arizona is a long distance
fiom "he path ol totality, bu! people
ir. this section will see about a tinee
tiuarters eclipse.
Beginning at about 2:25 p. m., peo
ple in l;tbe, v.iii observe the sun
passing i!: eclipse behind the moon.
As nearly (15 per cent of the sun's face
wiil be t bsrured. the strange darkness
in the n-iddle of the afternoon will
be verv evident.
Brief State Notes
Tom Nieuez of Globe, Frank -Martinez
cf iiayden and Francisco Lopez
are In ;1 Gila j:ui. charged with vio
lating tlio registration law. It is al
leged they failed to register on June
5, la.H year. The local board has
started fli! active campaign to round
up all il' a ft evaders.
Fclloivlr.g the filing with the state)
corporation commission of numerous
complaints of motor stage service and
of the c:i.duct of the state line busi-
ness. an 1 after several investigation.!
had been held by the commission, a j
compr -hfiisive order regulating the
conduct ol the entire stage line busi- i
ness of the state has been issued by 1
the corporation commission. The 1
order has been printed in pamphlet i
form for distribution to all persons in- j
terested ir. that business. '
The ouier bears the date of .May :
8. litis, iii.it is entitled: "In Kecent In- :
vestig:!ii.n Concerning the Kulos and i
Regulations Governing the Transpor
tation of Persons and Their Uaggage
for Hir? by Motor Vehicle."
My the sections of the order, not
only in is; every vehicle bs insured by
a separate policy, but an indemnity
policy must insure eav!i passenger
against r.i.y loss or in any case of bod
ily injaiy or death. Insurance com
panies ili:ing motor vehicle indemnity
business must notify commission of
any su.ts started against motor stgt.
companies.
End of Rebates
Two classes of transportation are
cited, scheduled service at stated per
iods an 1 rent service, which is not
scheduled service. Schedules for ter
ritory served and rales of fare must
be publicly displayed and must b.k
filed vi;h the commission.
No new carrier shall enter a field
already covered by a stage line at the
same or lesser rate of fare unless said
new carrier furnishes the same or bet
ter service. Changes in time sched
ules must be noted on schedules post
ed publicly and must be filed with the
commission at least five days before
said change is made. Likewise, no
change in the qualiy of service shall
be made without complying as above
Tariffs are to be filed with the corn-
mission and posted at all stations on i
the roire and no charges shall be !
made without thirty days' notice to the '
commission. Increases in fares -.ha,'!
be justified before they are published.
Rebating and granting of free or re
duced transportation receives particu
lar attention by. the commission. This
has been the cause of considerable
trouble ia the past, and by the new
order is prohibited. Rebates and com
missions are declared to be unlawful.
No Overcrowding
Drivers must be over 1 years and
licensed ami registered. No explosive
or inflammable articles are to be trans
ported. The use of trailers is, not al
lowed. I.iiggage or other articles car
lied on running boards shall not ex
tend men: than eight inches beyond
the outer edge of the running board.
Stage iine companies cannot operai.e
without certificate from the corpora
tion commission showing that they
have complied with all the regulations
ol the commission.
The tider became effective .May .t.i
litis. It is concurred in by F. A. Jones. :
however, he is of the opinion that this
grder slio; Id not have been mi'de to
apply t.) transportation of passengers :
between points within the limits of in-'
corporateil towns or cities. Most ,
towns anil cities', he states, already I
have laws regulating such traffic, and
he fears that confusion may result".

buying any longer means dollars and cents out
of your pocketbook, or bare feet for the children.

enlivened by a bouyant advance in
shippings, which carried most of these
shares far above final prices of the
previous session. Marine preferred
made a net gain of 9 points to 101.
the common gaining Ob and the 6 per
cent bonds 4',.
Other active stocks experienced a re
bound from minimum levels, these
for the most part, however, being rela
tively'nominal. There was a marked increase of
trading in bonds, but ' this center!
1 mainly in Lioeny issues, an dui me
'S'.'.'s reflecting continuous pressure at
lower records. New minimums were
$94 for the first 4's, $93.88 for the
