(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON. Msr. 6. Modi
fication of the senate rules urged
by President Wilson to prevent
future filibusters like the one that
killed the armed neutrality bill,
virtually, was agreed upon tonight
by a conference committee of ten
senators, five Democrats and five
Republicans named by the party .
caucuses.
Two-Thirds to Rule
The change proposed would put the
power In the hands of two-thirds of
' the senators present at any time to
shut off debate and prevent dilatory
tactics. The committee will niet
again tomorrow probably before the
senate convenes at noon and is ex
pected to reach a finaf agreement on
a resolution embodying this proposal
which was approved by the rules com
mittee several months a so but was
never called up for consideration at
the last session.
Expect it to Pass
Leaders championing the change
expect the resolution to receive the
necessary caucus endorsement and to
be presented to the senate as soon as
possible for consideration and action.
How such a proposal will be received
by the senators opposed to any modi
fication of the present procedure
which allows unlimited . discussion
none of the conference committee
knew.
Blow at Filibusters
A majority of the senate has long
favored the resolution considered fav
orably by the conference committee
and its approval by both parties In
caucus undoubtedly would pave the
way for its ultimate adoption. Both
party organizations working together
could make it uncomfortable for any
small group of senators who might
undertake filibuster.
The way was cleared to some ex
tent today for any fight which may
tome up over the rules or over the.
question of whether the senate is op
erating now under its old rule or
general parliamentary law.
Senator Owen, leader of the fight
for an absolute cloture rule under
which a majority would control de
bate, brought the subject up by giving
notice that such proceedings as are
conducted for the present must be by
unanimous consent and on the theory
that it is a continuing body the sen
ate, in the part has not adopted new
rules for each congress like the bouse
of representatives. If it were com
pelled to adopt them in doing so it
would work under general parliament-!
ary law and the majority could adopt,
such rules as it pleased in short or-i
der.
Marshall Non-Commital.
Vice President Marshall virtually
served notice on the senate today that
he did not propose to become a party
to any rules fight He declared in
connection with another matter that
the constitution makes it exceedingly
plain that the vice president is a pre
siding officer and that be has nothing
to do with the rules beyond seeing
that they are enforced.
Re-elect Saulsbury.
The Democratic caucus Indicated its
support of the ppinion that rules
sr.'juld be adopted each session. It re
elected Senator Saulsbury of Delaware
president pro tempore although he was
elected to that office last session and
ordinarily would have held over.
Both of the caucuses did the usual
pre-session business, and discussion
on the Democratic side developed
vigorous speeches in which there were
decided declarations about the pro
minence the west played in the Demo
cratic success last fall and the recog
nition is should receive by the senate
majority.
Martin Leads Majority.
Senator Martin, of Virginia, was
chosen unanimously as majority flo'or
leader.
The Republicans spent most of their
time discussing cloture and it became
apparent that while most of the thir
ty five present were vigorously op
posed to a rule which would tie the
hands of the minority completely,
they might be willing to agree t'j a
milder form of restricting debate.

FROM MEAT
(Hy Review
EL PASO. Mar. Revolutions in
Mexico and the cutting up of the rang
es in the United States into small
farms have been large factors in the
curtailment in the production of meat
products and Mexico may be the " ain
source in the future for meat. Presi
dent Abner T. Wilson, of the Panhan

sociation declared in bis address to
the members of the association when
the convention opened here today.
"Statistics show there are approxi
mately 18.000.000 fewer cattle in the
United States than there were seven
years ago and this in the face of an
increase of population of 20 million
peoples," President Wilson said.

The President declared he was
"mad" over the attitude of the little
group of senators who held up the
armed neutrality bill and indicated
that he hoped for better results If he
tried again to secure its passage. The
present, he said, is no time for parti
san or factional considerations in In
ternational affairs because the need
that America prove united in efforts
to safeguard its interests is Impera
tive. He decried bitterness in public
discussions of the situation.
Underlying principles of democracy
were described by Mr. Wilson as the
only principles that government can
endure and on which permanent world
peace can be maintained. He said
the consent of the governed must be
behind governments.
The President referred lo the con
dition of Alsace-Lorraine as typical of
causes of war which must be avoided
if permanent peace is to be achieved.
WASHINGTON, Mar. 6. There was
no final decision today on whether
President Wilson has the authority to
arm American merchantmen for de

The independents thus far have de-
clined to align themselves with either
oi tne Dig parties anu nave neia sev
eral secret caucuses. If they vote as
a unit, as it now appears they may,
they can delay business in the house
just as long as party lines are main
tained. At best neither Democrats
nor Republicans will have more than
215 party members and 21S are re
quired to elect a speaker except by
special agreement.
In case of a deadlock, many Demo
crats and Republicans believe it
would be their .patriotic duty in the
face of an international crisis to break
down party lines regardless of politi
cal fortunes. The desire of the house
to keep its record clear of any charge
of tying the President's hands as the
senate did Is expected to play a big
part in converting members to the bi
partisan proposal. It Is a house boast
that a large majority of its member

WASHINGTON, 'March 6.
Austria's reply to jhe American
request for a clearw definition of
her attitude in the submarine
situation was stated officially here .
to leave the door .-pea for further
negotions, and delayed temporari
ly at least the break which had
been regarded as inevitable since
the severance of relations between
the United States and Germany.
; Although in substance the long eom
jmunication upholds and defends the
! new unrestricted warrare waged by
'Germany, it is couched in most friend
; ly terms and points out that "Austrian
submarines are operating only in the
Adriatic and the Mediterranean, and
i therefore an encroachment 'on Ameri
can interests hardly is to be feared."
0. S. Will Reply.
There will be a reply to this note
I and unless an overt act precipitates
the rupture, which both sides apparent
ly earnestly seek to avoid, the United
States probably will not be inclined
to force the issue for the present.
Austria Disobeys Germany.
The truth is that Germany is credit
ed here with trying Co force Austria
to take a step which that country does
n'ot wish to take. Germany naturally
wishes, it is pointed but to have the
complete moral support of her allies
to the submarine campaign and is us
ing her great influence with Austria
to that end.
Austria, therefore. Is placed in the
delicate position of either sacrificing
the manifest benefits she receives front
the continuance of diplomatic rela
tions with this country, or W appear
ing not fully to support her ally. As
a result It is believed that she has
made in her reply to this country as
strong an endorsement of Germany's
position as possible without at the
same time making it impossible for
the United States to continue the
negotiations.
This opinion is based not only on
dispatches from Ambassador Penefild
at Vienna but on the whole length and
spirit of the Austrian note.

AMERICAN PAINTINGS
TO BE STUDIED AT
ART JEA FRIDAY
Twentieth Century Club Will
Exhibit Reproductions of
25 Artists at Y. W. C. A.
All Women Invited.
An art tea will be given by the
Twentieth Century Club at the Y. M.
C X. Friday afternoon nt 3 o'clock, at
which reproductions r the paintings
of twenty-five of A-rcrica's greatest
artists will be on exhibition.
The exhibit will be under charge of
Mrs. Jack Ilevins, Mrs. Hamp Coch
ran and Mrs. A. It. Richardson, while
Mrs. E. J. Flanigan will preside at
the tea table. .
Miss Wilmer, instructor of art in
the Uisbee high school, together with
her class will attend and asisst In in
terpreting the canvasses.
While art technically includes sculp
ture. architecture and other crafts,
this exhibit will restrict itself to pamt
ings of portraits, sunsets, land and
sot scapes, by such men as John S.
i-argeni. A. B. Frost, Frederick Rem
ington, Gari Melcher and the like.
An effort also will be made so to
present these paintings as to lend
system to the chaos now rtigning
among American painters, half of
whom are still clinging to the style of
the old masters and the other half
trying out everything from "futur
isTr." to "cubism" in a mad desire to
create a new kind of expression typi
cal of today.
.It is a big job. and the Twentieth
Century flub is courageous in at
tempting it.
Along with the exhibit will go a
general treatment of painting includ
ing the commercial side, which is
now supreme on this side of the At
lantic. The values of paintings as
well as the fundamentals of conois
eurship also will be touched upon at
the tea. All women in the District
are invited.
EVANGELISTS OPEN
VIGOROUS CAMPAIGN
AGAINST SIN HERE
Messrs. Hart and Magann
Launch Series of Meetings
in Presbyterian Church Be
fore a Large Audience.
Messrs. Hart and Magann. evange
lists, launched their series of revival
meetings in this city before a large
audience at the Presbyterian church
last night. With the organ, piano, a
splendid choir and Musical Director
Magann's voice leading the .singers,
the "fight" against fiin was opened
under auspicious circumstances.
The Rev C. W. Harshman, chair
man of the executive committee, pre
sided at the meeting and introduced
Mr. Hart and Mr. Magann. From the
opening number, Mr. Magann showed
his ability and spirit. His vocal solos
will undoubtedly prove ah sttraction
throughout the series. Mr Hart Is a
rood speaker and his rapid-fire words
phrases and sentences seemed to til"
ble from his lips as if rach were
striving to strike the listeners' ears
Jirst.
In speaking of the union revival ser
vices he said: "The Methodists will
furnish the fire, the Baptists the wat
er and we hone to get up steam
enough soon to move this town."
Taking his text from St. John XVI,
XVII and XVIII. Dr. Hart contrasted
the churches i in their acceptance of
the Holy Spirit and the resulting pow
er. The early church, he said, met in
an upper room, while the modern
church meets in the supper room.
"The Bible is the book of God's
child," he said. "The sinner's Bible
Is you. The Christian reads the gos
pels according to Matthew or Mark;
the sinner reads the gospel according
I to you.
Messrs. Hart and Magann will con
duet meetings at the Presbyterian
church at 1:30 and 7:15 p. m. every
day.

A dazzling gem in the co-stir
crown of Francis X. Bushman and

the MetrO-Quality series in fifteen
chapters, in which they are the stars.
This serial opens today at the Or

will be given from 1 until 5 o'colck.
For many months Mr. Bushman and
Miss Bayne have been the officially
recognized King and Queen . of the
screen. He Teceived his royal title
at the San Francisco Exposition : ' she
was orowned at San Diego. Thus
recognized, they struggled with even
greater ambition to give ft) their mo

tions of the highest type. In the
Metro offices, when conferences are
being held on particularly big plays in
I prospect, the final verdict generally
.is: "Send for Bushman Bayne and
see if they will take the star parts."
! If they say "yes," the pronouncement
means success.
"Romeo and Juliet," as a screen
feature was brought up 'one day. They
sent for Bushman and Bayne. The
stars said "yes." He played the part
of Romeo; she was Juliet. It was an

Traitors or Fools.
When a few men, in the senate of the United States, j
can prevent the President of this great country from j
securing the aid which is his by right and by the gift
of the people, then there would seem to be something
wrong with the system which allows that few to dominate
a whole. On Sunday twelve United States senators,
pledged to uphold the lienor of this nation, voted to tie
the hands of its President. They took advantage of the
rule in the upper branch of congress which allows nn
limited debate. It id not causes but results which count
in this question, however, and they promise to be serious.
On the face of the nyitter it would appear fiat the twelve
men are either traitors or fools and there is not much
to choose between the two grades.
President Wilson has not asked congress to grant him
the exclusive right to declare war. He does not wish to
declare war. He is in a better position thaa either that
estimable gentleman from Wisconsin, Mister LaFollctte,
or that follower of pro-German thought in Missouri,
Mister Stcne, to know the exact situation as it effects
the United States. His actions are truly American. T';e
American people are behind him.
Too long have the American people been dormant to a
need which has seen no activity since 1SG5. That is na
tionalism. V.'e, in this country, have been so busy build
ing great industries, floating great irrigation tracts and
palming off on an unsuspecting public real estate of a
doubtful value, that the country which has made all this
possible has been forgotten. Without our national in
tegrity our activities would amount to nothing. Without
our government our entire system wculd go for nothing.
We would be as a vanquished race; our goods would be
come spoils for others and our people the vassals of an
other race.
It we can not resent an insult, if our President can not
prepare for anything that may confront us in any dire
moment, what then is to become of a nation which calls
itself proud? Have we degenerated into a nation of jelly
fish; one which would rather cringe and bow our heads
to any country which may, at any time, desire to make
footballs of us and our country?' It is not probable that
the United States is any different today than it was
seventy years ago, and that twelve United States sen
ators do not represent the true feelings of the country or
their own constituents.
The United States is in an enviable position. The en
tire world looks askance at this great, great nation. Wc
hold the keys to the greatest progress ever recorded in
the world's history and there are many countries which
would enjoy any discomfiture we might beVorced to
undergo.
Let us hope that the incoming congress will stand be
hind the President. It is no time to think of party lines.
We are all Americans, anxious for the safety and for the
integrity of the nation and of its people. There is only
one way to secure that position and that is by standing
together.
A Suffrage Year.
It begins to look like a woman suffrage year, os well as
a prohibition year.
Within a few weeks there have Ik-cii several uotabl'j
triumphs for the cause. Ohio and Indiana legislatures
have enacted laws granting the women or those slates
limited suffrage which includes the right to vote for pres
ident' The North Dakota legislature has adoptd a more
sweeping measure, , conferring rights similar to those
possessed by Illinois women, who vote for nearly ull
municipal, state and national officers.. A similar measure
has received the approval of one branch of the Tennessee
legislature.
The Minnescta house of representatives lias passed a
bill granting full suffrage to women, by constitutional
Kinendment, to be referred to t'ie voters next fall. In
Maine the suffragists have won a fight lasting forty years,
and the legislature has unanimously voted to refer the
suffrage issue tc a special election to be held September
10, , The New York assembly lias just voted to submit
suffrage once more to the voters of the state. In Ihj'Ii
Maine and New York Wiere seems to lie a good prospect
that the amendments will carry. Tin- New Hampshire
legislature, too. is contemplating the submission of a suff
rage amendment to the people.
And the year is young yet.
Compulsory Physical Improvement
"There Is a natural hunger which every growing boy
has for physical training. He wants to learn to ride", but
has no horse. He wants to learn to sail, but has no boat.
Above all. he craves the luxury of manoeuvring in mass
to the inspiring sound of martial music and feeling that
he is fit to fight for his country if the time comes to do so.
"These things are passions of the poor boy whom pri
vation has made used to work and sacrifice, while the
indolent rich boy who can have them rarely wantB them
cr achieves any excellence if he has them.
"The greatest contribution to preparedness, therefore,
will be to give the poor boy the physical training he longs
for. We will then have a fighting force as numberless as
the sands on the seashore a force with bone and sinew,
nerve and loyalty that cannot be surpassed r a force alert,
efficient, intelligent and patriotic."
"!1 this seems to agree with the tencr of present dry
sentixent throughout the cpuntry. Both physical1 train
(! ui i - in ' ' (It 'en e are seea in a new li.-h. Uni
Mil ni;!i.a.y strv.ee, cr at least universal military
..raining, is receiving strong support n every section and
from nearly every class of citizens. And It's interesting
to note that, while it is argued that a great trained force
is needed to defend the country against foreign peril, the
stress Is generally laid not on the prospect- of actual
fighting but on the good tiat our young men will derive
frcm the training.
'A great military establishment is, at best, a necessarv
evil. Cut as long at; we look at it in this wholesome way,
emphasizing militaiy training as a preparation for good
citizenship more than a preparation for war, there need
be little fear of militarism in the United States.
Waste.
Germany's food supply is low. And yet, according to
trustworthy accounts, the German people are not starv
ing. Nobody goes without food. Germany lias simply
solved the problem by a rational system of distribution.
vhat food there is is shipped where it is needed, and de
livered to consumers without needless delay or expense.
.This country produced, last year, less food than usual,
but still far more fian enough for ail our needs, and in
comparably more than any foreign country produced.
Today food is grievously scarce and costly. Large quan
tities, to be sure, have been shipped to Europe; and yet
there would be plenty for home consumption, and prices
would be far lower, if cur crops had only been properly
gathered, conserved and distributed.
Only one section of the country may be said to take
anywhere near proper care of the food it produces. That
is the West. EI ov here, particularly in the East, apples
are left to rot on ihe trees, potatoes are left to rot in the
ground, fruits and vegetables of many kinds, are gathered
haphazard and in large. part left to spoil on the farm r
on the way to market.
Sheer carelessness and inefficiency! Sometimes it is
the farmer's fault. Sometimes it is the fault of the
ommission men and wholesalers, who will not pay prices
that make it worth while for the farmerrs to gather their
crops. Often it is the fault of railroads, which charge
ruinous rates, or fail to provide adequate facilities for
etting the stuff tc .market Sometimes it is a lack of
marketing facilities in the cities. Sometimes all these
causes, and others, work together. Thus nature's bounty
is thrown away and people go hungry.
While we're so zealous in preparedness, why not pre
pare a little along this line and check the appalling waste
of our food supply at Its sources? Why not -get busy on
the job of seeing that every apple, every potato, every
egg. every berry, every onion ;and carrot, every handful
of grain, finds its way, in some form, to the market
basket and the dinner table?
School Savings Banks.
Philander P. Claxton, commissioner of education for
the United States is a bcilever in school savings banks.
He approves of what has already been done in this lino
and looks forward to greater achievement in til's future.
Not long ago the education bureau published a report
dealing with the history of these banks and urging their
usefulness. Mr. Claxton believes that the average boy
or girl ought to gradute from the elementary school with
c. capital of from $100 to $400. That is, if the school
bank has done its work right.
A, principal in an Arkansas school is reported as hav
ing one of the most successful school banks. He runs
it as nearly like the ordinary commercial bank as pos
sible. And he not only receives the children's savings,
but he invests tliciu for the youngster.
That, Mr. I'axton declares, ought to be out- of the chief
works of the school bank. He says:
''There ought to be some safe general investment for
the money saved through the school savings bunk. I
have thought that school bonds ought to be made avail
able. The trouble now is that it is almost impossible to
find an investment binall enough, and of unquestionable
safety, for the children to buy."
There's a chance for a new kind of philanthropy. It
needn't be philanthropy, cither. There ought to be some
businevs possibilities in good investments for children.
"If Phoenix is not kuved by this time it's ull off. The
evangelists have j;one; the :-awdust trail is covered with

Great efforts have been made in this vicinity
to sell baking powders of inferior class, made
from alum and lime phosphate,, both undesir

of tartar baking powder to make pure and

The official Government tests
have shown Moyal Baking Po w

of urgent export demand helped the

Grandmother's recipe of Sage
Tea and Sulphur and no
body will know.
The use of Sage and Sulphur for re-
storing faded, gray hair to Its natural
color dates back to grandmother's
time. She used it to keep her hair '
beautifully dark, glossy and attractive.
Whenever her hair took on that dull,
faded or streaked appearance, this
simple mixture was applied with won
derful effect.
Rut brewing at home is mussy and
out-of-date. Nowadays, by asking at
any drug store for a 50 cent brittle of
"Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Com-1
pound." you will get this famous old i
preparation, improved by the addition
of other ingredients, which can be de
pended upon to restore natural color
and beauty to the hair.
A weli-knV)wn downtown druggist
says it darkens the hair so naturally
and evenly that nobody can tell It has I
been applied. You simply dampen a
sponge or soft brush with it and draw
this through your hair, taking one
strand at a time. By morning the
gray hair disappears, and after an
other application or two. it becomes
beautifully dark and glossy.
Wyeth's Sage and Sulphur Com
pound is a delightful toilet requisite
for those who desire a more youthful
appearance. It is not intended for the
cure, mitigation or prevention
of
disease.

If the bill which passed the sta'.e
senate last week, providing for an
other superior court in Cochise county,
is successful in the house, a Iiisbee

by Governor Thomas V. Campbell

I Cochise county has needed the two

j attorney, L'rure Stevenson, the as
sistant, and Harry C. Wheeler, sher
iff, has n'ore court business than hns
Maricopa county. The criminal busi
ness, particularly. Is heavy in thi"
rein, due largely to the fact of its
proximity to the international border
and the crowded centers of population
in the neighboring Mexican state.
In the sefection of Mr. Flanigan.
should the bill become a law and he,
be asigned by Governor Campbell, Co
chise county would be fortunate in
the extreme. Mr. Flanigan has been
a resident of the state of Arizona for
many year3 and is recognized as 'Jne

"The Return of 'Draw' Egan," a

with virile brush strokes. . William S.

cover because socity will not longer
tolerate his transgressions. Eventual

the sheriff and uph'jld the law. This
he does with a vengeance. Many
things, including "falling in love" oc

"THE LIBERTINE"
AT EAGLE SUNDAY
Big Feature Play With John
Mason in Leading Role
Two Days in City.
Julius Stieger's daring motion pic
ture production, "The Libertine." at
the Eagle theatre Saturday and Sun
day, featuring John Mason and Alma
Hanlon, is a story of modern life as
it exists. A sennou delivered wiih
sledge-hammer blows, it depicts the
life of the libertine, who closes the
eye of understanding while shrewdly
working on the feminine enAition. He
is shown striking at the innoce it girls
in the olhees. shops and factories, and
with his suave manner leads them to
ruin.
It is a story plainly showing that
the greatest instrument of vice is the
fatal lure of wealth and luxiry. vain
as it is to the young girls of a great
city. This plea too oftn makes in
nocence the easy prey 'of "The Lib
el tine."
It is a picture that has startled the
public in every rity where it has been
shown. It is the tirst time that a
picture of this kind has ever been
shown on the screen. John Mason en
acts the role of the male "vampire,"
and Alma Hanlon is seen as one of his
victims. There are a number of in
tense dramatic situations, superb set
tings and exceedingly strong support
ing casts. Special music is arranged

do so. Recently I witnessed a private exhibition
of the first several chapters of
FRANCIS X.
BEVERLY
Bushman and Bayne
Filmdom's Two Most Popular and Romantic Stars, in
"The Great Secret"
Without hesi'ation I secured the first run showing in Bisbee for
ihe OIU'.'LU:! THK.TIU2 and with the same confidence I offer it to
t e pi'Uie as the biggest, most pretentious and absolutely finished
lerial production ever presented in films. METRO has commandeered
its two greatest stars to play the leads in "THE GREAT SECRET"
and in addition has been extravagant in expenditures' in its effort to
make this serial the mosj remarkable of all times.
I have paid a fabulous rental price for the picture, but not unwil-lir.-ly,
for 1 urn confident that the enthusiasm of my patrons will more
h;in repay me.
'The first chapter of "The Great Secret" will be shown on Wed
nesday. March 7th, and if you witness it I know that you will not need
a fuitlier invitation to see the fourteen chapters that will follow it

Atter quiet had reigned undisturbed
for about a week, thing.4 ocean to
happen in Judge J. L. Winters' court
at Lowell yesterday and before th
day was over lhe court had established
a new record for Lowell, which Jnd?"
Winters insists has the most 'oid'Tly
population in the west.
Sam Tyson was given a preliminary
hearing and hound over to the action
of the superior court on a charge ot
assault. Tyson's wile, who caused hi
arrest, testified that, duriug a ojiarrt 1
with her. Tjvon had brutally choked
and beat her in their room in a b'juse
in Johnson Addition. During the hear
ing yesterday, Tyson told the court
that he loved his wife, to which Judfrc
Winters remarked that the defendant's
methods of proving his love were
rather unusual. Mrs. Tyson still bore
bruises which she claimed were in
flicted by her husband while she strug
gled with him.
A "John Doe" felony r 'Jin plaint was
sworn out before Judge Winters by G.
Somorzich, a driver for the Superior
bakery. Somorzich claims that while
driving his machine between Kuglas
and Bisbee Sunday night it was struck
and damaged by another car. The
driver of the other machine did not
stop following the accident, and Som
orzich hailed a passing auto stage' and
started in pursuit. After a short
chase, Somorzich says, ' he overtook
the car he was after and asked the
occupants if they would pay for. the
damage done his machine in the col
lision. Their answer, he says, was
to lire three shots at hint and drive
on again. The identity jf the driver
of the car was discovered by Lowell
odicors, who expect to locate him
soon.
The case of Harold Klatt, a minor,
was turned over to the county proba
tion officers. The fjy is alleged tc
have stolen an auto tire from Jo!:!;
Supancich in Johnson Addition. As
the lad -is already under the care of
the probation officers. Judge Winters
sent a record of his last escapade to
the superior court, asking that the
county advise him what rj do with
the lad.
