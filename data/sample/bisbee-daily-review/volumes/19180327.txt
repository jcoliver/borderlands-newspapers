LONDON. March 27. Telegraphing)
late on Tuesday me corresponueui mi
the Daily Mail at British headquarters
in France says that nearly two-thirds
of the entire strategic reserve of the
German army now ban been thrown
into the fierce and vigorously contin
ued attack.
"This German reserve," he adds,
"consisted of eighty-five divisions t
talling 1.275.000 menviutof a total
number now reaching not" far short of
two hundred divisions, or possibly
3.000,000 men which they have upon
the western front. After the first day
33 of these divisions were put into the
battle. On the third day another 22
a"re known to have taken part.
Since then they must have drawn
upon the reserve for a few more dlvls
, ions.
"It is. therefore, clear that we have
been struggling with the whole avail
able strength of the German army, and
the marvel is that our soldiers have
held out so obstinately and steadily
against odds so heavily against them."
ATTACK CHAULNES
. LONDON, March 26. The battle con
tinues on the whole front south of the
Somme river. Field Marshal Haig re
ports Xrom the war zone in France to
night. Tnp Germans have also launch
, ed new attacks around Chaulnes.
The statement says:
"North of the Somme local fighting
has taken place at different points.
Much movement of hostile troops and
transports has been observed in the
battle area and these have been en
gaged by our artillery and airplanes.
"South of the Somme the hostile at
tacks have been pressed vigorously
with fresh German divisions against
Novon and Rove.
"The battle is continuing on tho
whole front souh of the Somme.
SHOW GREAT COURAGE
"In the last six days of constint
fighting our troops on all parts of th!
battle front have shown the utmost ,
courage.
In addition to those Britlrh
divisions
which have already been i
mentioned, exceptional gallantry was
shown also by the following:
"The eighth, eighteenth, thirty-first,
forty-first, sixty-first, sixty-third and
sixty-sixth divisions."
-The Germans took Roye at 10:30
a. m. The line there appears to run
from Mericourt on the Somme, through
Rosiars west of Itoye and west of Noy
on. Fresh German divisions have
been identified in this area including
two guard and two brandenburg divis
ions. "On this part of the battlefield, the

that a turning point in the terrific
struggle was close at hand.
Press reports from the British front
hinted at th? same feeling there. For
the people cf the United States the
ing side by side with Fr?nch oefenJ
ers brings the battle closer home.
War departmen tofficlals bad no worj
from General Pershing cn the subject
but were expecting at any moment
reports of the extent of the American
participation. Action centers! now o&
the French front rather than on the
progress made by the Germans against
the Biitish lines. As the battle pro
ceeds officers are becoming more cer
tain that the defenders are carrying
out a definite plan of which the Brit
ish withdrawal is a part but which
will prove soon to be couple! with a
rcwerful counter thrust The most
probable place for the launching of
such a movement, it was thought, was
from the flanking position the French
,held tenaciously tonight along the left
bank of the Oise.
Use French Equipment.
Until General Pershing reports as
to the American forces engaged no
cne here will hazard a guess concern

It was regarded as entirely possible,
however, that American infantry divi

experience in their own sector had
come up with the French reinforce
ments." Tbey would be certain let
operate with thje French as th?ir
equipment is largely French and thex

OTTAWA, .March 2?. Telegraph
ing from British headquarters in
France tonight. Reuters corres
pondent says:
"Never has the traditional quali--ty
of British steadfastness been
more wonderfully illustrated than
now. Time and time again troops
have been overwhelmed and over
run by swarming legions and as of
ten they have managed to emerge
and regain their line. What would
be regarded as consummate feats
of skill in field maneuvers are be
ing constantly performed in the
grimmest struggle.
"One of the most dramatic i n ci
der ts was when our most weary
troops fighting against hopeless
odds, and striving to. prevent the
Germans from securing a certain
crossing of the Somme, the French
reinforcement arrived and without
hesitation poured in amongst the
Britis.h infusing fresh vigor and
saving the situation.
. "Prisoners attribute the German
success to the wonderful concen
tration of artillery the full advan
tage of which they are losing. At
various places the enemy is most
reluctant to occupy evacuated po
sitions. Whether they are afraid
of traps or of being shelled to rags
is only conjecture.
"Now that we are operating in
the open, our great superiority in
mechanical transports gives us
the advantage of mobility over the
enemy. The back areas are teem
ing with motor busses packed with
soldiers speeding to the threaten
ed points.
"Today's fighting has been of tho
most bitter character along most
of the battle front, b'lt the latest
reports indicate there is more
movement than heretofore, prob
ably due to the German infantry
outstepping the artillery."

BY REVIEW
NEW YORK. March 2C Dealings
h stocks today were ocmpletely
eclipsed by the hnee transactions in
liberty bonds, which readied recora
Vreaking proportions.
The demand concentrated In the sec
ond fours, that Issue changing bands
In almost countless lots ranging from
several thousand dollars to one block
of $1,700,000 at $97.50.
Qoutations for the second fours
were mainly on an advancing scale
from S7.24 to 97.94, a maximum gain
of 94 per cent. First fours sold at
87.20 to 97.70, an extreme gain of 78
per cent, and the three and one-halve?
were quoted at 9S.40 to 99, a pain "of
80 per cent. Total sales of liberty
bonds, par value, approximated $26,
000.000. the second fours contributing
over $23,000,000.
Extraordinary absorption of l.berty
bonds was naturally ascribed to pub
lication of details outlining the next
or third Issue. Not only was a much
large,., offering expected but the OA
Interest .rate also occasioned surprise.
Investment rails, industrials and some
seasoned specialties were variably
higher at times, but prices in general
eased at their close on reports that
She steel schedule or the war board
might prove disappointing. Sales 385,
000 snares.
The general bond list was firm on
beaw dealings. Sales, par value,
$1,200,000. United States old issue
were unchanged on call.

Sixth Day
With no appreciable let up in its in
tensity and effort, the German drive con
tinues into the sixth day. Its momentum,
however has been checked, its speed slack
ened and its success hampered. There is
not the slightest doubt but that part of the
British strategy, planned before the drive,
was to draw back before the first onset. This
voluntary withdrawal in the face of supe
rior numbers and the first irresistible rush
in order to save the needless sacrifice of
lives, will account for the German general
gain on twenty miles of the front for a
depth of from three to four miles. But it
will not account for the break in the lines
west of St. Quentin. The deep wedge
south of Peronne, calculated to separate
the French and English armies, was forced
in by sheer strength and an effort that
counted no cost too great.
German strategy in this greatest offen
sive cf all warfare is as c!d as war itself
and as simple as a bayonet thrust. Their
ancestors used it when Attilla, the Hun.
ravaged Europe in the long ago. They
simply massed their men at a given point
and rushed forward, depending upon
strength and weight to carry them
through. They depended upon psychology
as the very esience of strategy; in other
words, they oaid they would aack, pro
claimed it broadcast, and then did attack.
This is the favorite Hunnish and Prussian
ruse. It is calculated to inspire terror in
their enemies and confidence in them
selves.
German strategy differs markedly from
allied strategy. When attacked by supe
rior numbers and threatened with annihi
lation by shell fire, the German high com
mand withdraws the officers and leaves the
men to hold to the end, even though it be
certain destruction. Their supreme egotism
forbids that they yield an inch of ground
or admit even a temporary reverse. Loss
of life attendant upon this plan weighs not
at all with them. It is the same with an
offensive. When attacking waves are wiped
out and the toll of death mounts too fast
and too high, they press on just the same.
Pride impels them forward. It is the sim
ple and direct war strategy of the bar
barian, of the frenzied animal, of the con
queror. Allied strategy is in direct contrast.
When a position becomes untenable it is
vacated; the men are withdrawn to save
life. When an attack costs too much it
is abandoned. To withdraw and thus ad
mit defeat for a day does not daunt the
allied war board. The humiliation of fail
ure does not worry this board. There is
another day; another way. The course is
a long one; let us husband our strength for
the last lap.
It is the old, old story of intelligence and
skill against strength and fury. The latter
always wins the first round. But if intelli
gence and skill can hold out to a certain
point, it is invariably returned the victor.
Ail stem tests for supremacy have proved
it. The arena, the battlefield, the- race
course, the prize ring, the athletic field, all
have p'led up the preponderance cf the evi
dence in favor of the mind over matter. A
rigid front and a supreme thrust, this is the
German way. An elastic front and a timed
and calculated thrust, this is the allied way.
Which is the best? In our impatience we
would incline to the more spectacular
methods of the Hun. They seem to be the
only way. Certainly in a limited encoun
ter, they are the best. But in a fight to a
finish the allied plan always wins. The
longhead versus the rcundhoad, playing
the latter's game. War, red war, with the
odds at first favoring the lustful fighter
who sees red arid carries all before him.
But the master of the sea and the land is
the man who fitrhts with his had and his
heart, as well as with his hands and his
passions. One grand thrust will win a bat
tle, but reserves win a war.
There is no disguising the fact that the
past six days have been dark ones for ail
loyal men. The German offensive has so
far been a victory for the kaiser, and there
fore a defeat for the allies. Much ground
has been lost and many thousands of pris
oners and hundreds of guns. Greater gains
have been recorded in a briefer time than
in any attack since the Marne.
Pessimists point to Verdun, where the
Germans gained only seven miles after
three months of battling. Also to the
British efforts on the Somme two summers
ago and at Ypres last summer. These seem
purile in comparison with Hindenburg'3
spectacular drive.
BUT, the Germans at Verdun had
neither the guns or reserves they have to
day on the Somme. The British in their
great offensives of 1916 and 1917 did not
expend ag many men in either campaign
as the Germans have already spent in less
than a week.
It will probably be several days before
any valuable or permanent estimate can
be placed upon thi3 supreme effort cf the
German war machine. When the dead are
counted and the captured ground held,
then will be time to make a record of the
gain or loss of the Prussian plan.
One good already has, been accom
plished by this supreme effort, arid that is
in the awakening of all allied peoples to
th true aspect of the German menace. We
have been warned ever and over again by
informed and thoughtful men, but we
could not believe Germany was still so
strong, rive million men from America
is now the cry before the war may be wen.
Judging from the energy and vitality of the
last German thrust, this is not a man too
many to carry the red, white and blue to
the Rhine.
One last word; as long as the British
lines remain unbroken and full of fight, as
they undoubtedly are up to this time,
there is no .need to fear a disaster or to
view with too much alarm. The vitality
cf the allied champion in this a.cna is still
unimpaired; he still - holds in reserve a
strength and a punch sufficient tp turn the
tide when his method of strategy points to
the hour to strike.

In Bisbee, a population which has here
tofore taken the war as a matter-of-fact
proposition toward which every one must
through patriotism give some attention, a
new population has been created which
waits almost breathlessly for some new de
velopment. Crowds gather with the pojt
ing of each bulletin to see if perhaps the
tide of battle has turned. Every lip breathes
a prayer of hope that the gallant defend
ers of the British front will turn their de
fense into a routing counter attack.
The significance of the manner in which
the war has been burned home to us is best
illustrated in one Bisbee, resident. Ha is a
busy, business man, whose hours every
day are devoted to untiring work. He has
been successful in his efforts and has ac
cumulated friends, and money. He has
reared a family, and has sent his only sen
to France. His moments are precious and
his business demands much cf his atten
tion. But the war is of greater moment to j
him than business. Sunday afternoon he
arrived at the Review office soon after the
Associated Press wire began ticking bul
letins from the battle-fronts. He sat
throughout the afternoon beside the tele
graph operator's desk. As each bulletin
came in he scanned it closely. Business
forgotten, the affairs of otiice brushed I
aside, the demands of personal attention
forsaken, he waited on the words from
Europe. The great war and the greatest
battle in history came first with him. '"It
doesn't much matter how pclitics go, cr
who wins' the next woiid's pennant," h'.j
said. "Those affairs make lilllc difference.
Business makes little difference except as
it will assist us in our war."
Occasionally he made some comment
on the news as it came over the wires. He
called attention to the fact that most cf the
bulletins were of 1 euton origin. Most of
the time he sat and waited, and thought.
This last battle has supplied the south
west wilh what it has needed for the past 1
year a serious contemplation of facts. ' It
has brought home the war to a people who ,
have walked blind in faith in the name j
United States. A new war spirit has been j
born to the district and this section of the I
southwest has recognized with new eyes j
the reality of Prussian peril. j
Warren District branch of the Ser-
foiati National Defense League of Am
erica was perfected with more than
Sort charter members at a meeting of
the Idi a' colony of Serbians in Dabo
i vich all on Naco road. Saturday night
, In addition, the Serbians secured the
i iiainei oT many others of their nation
ality ""ejidonts of either this district or
1 Douglas. It is the plan of the organi
zation to secure the membership of
every Serbian in the country before
they conclude their efforts.
T'm Warren district branch couiec
undar the supervision of the national
league, at Washington. It is organized i
for t'u sole purpose of assisting the'
Serbian orphans and widows, and fori
carry np on the prosecution of the war '
to a successful victory on the side of
the I'rited States and her allies. :
At the conclusion of the meeting a ;
resolution pledging the Serbians to do ;
thoir utmost to the successful prosecu-:
tion was adopted as follows: i
"We. the local Serbians, are and ev-j
er hive been ready to do our utmost
to assist the United States in prosecu
tion of this war to the final victory of.
democracy over European autocracy;
that v e are now and have been in the :
past in accord with the ideal i of the
president of thta great country, realiz
ing the fact that this great man led '
the country Into the war for the broad-;
ening of democracy and the elimina- j
tion of autocracy as it is advocated by !
the i'riibsian:
'Wo further pledge ourselves- to be !
ever ready to meet any demand that :
should be mada upon us by this great
country and we will be ready to sacri-'
fice our lives, money and all of our j
possessions:
"Aad this organization further
stands ready to assist in anf investi-
gation that may arise as to the loyalty i
members or others toward the United :
States government in this struggle.
"We pledge ourselves also that with
the organization of this colony, mis-'
representations of tho past whicl have
tended to reflect on the Serbians, will !

Symbol of Meat
I The intermediary four or five days,
1 are of a lesser degree of sacredness.
The evening of the first and second !
days is characterized by a special ser '
vice called the Seder, in reality a
meal after oriental fashion. '
T'e rich symbolism of this meal Is
to be explained as follows: The roast
ed lamb tjene is reminiscent of the
Passover .sacrifice; the "matzoth" or
unleavened bread recalls the haste
with which the Israelites left Egypt,
with no time to prepare the bread for;
'the journey; the "maror" or bitter'
herb reminds of the bitterness of the,
slaves' life in Egypt.
There are also at the festive board
1
a rosated egg which Is substitute for
the ancient sacrifice, salt water, sus
geative of the tears shed by the slave
ancestors of the Israelites, and "haro
fteth," a mixture of almonds and ap
ples, not unlike in appearance to tne
mortar which the slaves used In mak
ing bricks.
The whole ceremony is an explana
tion of these symbols, a recounting
of Israel's stay in Egypt and of his
uarveicus deliverance, of God's watch
over his chosen people throughout
their history.
Praises are sung to the Almighty
ar.d prayer offered that freedom may
always be Israel's lot as well as that
of the remainder of mankind.
