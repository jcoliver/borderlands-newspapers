VV The federal govern-
inf', rJon fnr ;ncrma
ment s plan tor insuring
officers and men or the army,
navy and marine corps against i
death and iniury while m
complex program which would
provide government allow-1
ances for families of soldiers !r
and sailors and the rehabilita-!
tion and training of injured
men to fit them for making a
livelihood after the war.
The program was discussed at con
ferences today among officials of the
war, navy, treasury, commerce and
labor departments, the labor commit
tee of the council of national defense
and the presidents and other high offi
cials of leading inburance companies.
Insurance Planned
Issuance of insurance policies from
$1000 to $10,000 to officers and men at
ordinary peace time rates, the government-paying
the extra cost. Indemni
ties for total or partial disability and
administration of the entire slheme by
the government's war risk insurance
bureau which is at present insuring of
ficers and crews of American merchant
vessels, are among the outstanding
features of the proposed program.
"The plan has not yet assumed defi
nite form," said a statement issued at
the treasury late today, "but when it
has been worked out in all its funda
mentals and details. Secretary McAuOo
will present it to the president for his
approval and if approved the recom
mendation will be submitted to con
gress at an early date for its consider
ation. Support of Families
"The proposition is based on the
fundamental idea that the government
should, as a matter of justice and hu
manity, adequately protect its fighting
men on land and sea and their families.
"Under the plans discussed it is sug
gested that provision be made for the
support of dependents of soldiers and
sailors by giving them an allotment
out of the pay of the men and also an
allowance by the government; that of
ficers and men be indemnified against
death or total or partial disability;
that a system' of rehabilation and re
education of disabled men be Inaugur
ated and that the government insure
lives of sailors and soldiers on their
application at rates of premium based
upon ordinary risks.
Allotments Planned
"Dependents Of soldiers and sailors
in service would be provided for
for through allotments from their pay,
supplemented by family allowances by
the government. The amount of the
government allowance would depend
upon the size of the family, and as to
others than the wife and children,
upon those actually dependent upon
them. The family allowance wjuld De
made only if the sailor or soldier
makes an allotment for bis dependents
out of his pay."

Bill Charging It Shews Lack

(By Review Leased Wire).
WASHINGTON, July 23. President
Wilson asked congress today to elim-
- - m at . 1 n
j mate irum uit? iuuu tumiui um scu
j ate amendment creating a joint com
j mittee of senators and representatives
to confer and advise with executive of
i ficials On war expenditures.
In a letter to Chairman Lever of the
house agriculture committee, the pres
ident polnted out in frank terms that
such a committee would be likely to
constantly harrass those directly re
sponsible for the conduct of the war.
Retention of the section, he notified
congress, he would be compelled to in
terpret as signifying a "lack of confi
dence in myself." I
Food Board Opposed
Mr. Lever and other house leaders
are understood to be ready to make a
determined fight against the provis
ion, which was voted into the bill near
the close of the long senate debate.
The bouse leaders alos are planning to
oppose vigorously the senate's provis
ion for a food control board of three
members instead of one administrator,
and there are many indications that
in this likewise they will have the
president's unqualified backing.
Mr. Wilson wrote to Representative
Lever in response' to a letterpromis
ing to hasten the food bill through
conference, and 'asking advice on the
war committee provision The presi
dent's reply follows:
"I am very much obilged to you for
your thoughtful Courtesy in stating to
me the circumstances of the persent
action on the food administration bill,
and I am particularly oblige dto you
for calling my attention to section 23.
I deem it my duty to express my opin
ion about that section and its effect
upon the whole administration of the
war very frankly indeed, since the pub
lic interest manifestly demands that
I should do so.
Wilson Cites Precedent
"Section 23 is not only foreign to
the subject matter of the food admin
istration bill in which it is Incorporat
ed but would, if enacted into law, ren
der my task of conducting the war
practically impossible. I cannot be
lieve that those who proposed this sec;,
tion scrutinized it with care or analy
zed the effects when its operation
would necessarily have. The constant
supervision of executive action which
it contemplates would amount to noth
ing less than an assumption on the
part of the legislative body of the exe
cutive work of the administration.
"There is a very ominous precedent
in our history which sUOws how such
a supervision would operate. I refer
to the committee on the conduct of the
war constituted by congress during the
administration of Mr. Lincoln. It was
the cause of constant and distressing
narassment and rendered Mr. Lincoln's
efforts all but impossible.
"I am not, I beg you to believe, In
any way questioning what might be
teh motive or the purpose of members
of such a committee: I am ready to as
sume that they would wish to co-oprate
in the mOst patriotic spirit, but co
operation of that kind is not practic
able in the circumstances. The re
sponsibility rests upon the administra
tion. There are abundant existing
means of Investigation and of the ef
fective enforcement of that responsi
bility. I sincerely hope that upon the
reconsideration Of this matter both
houses of congress will see that my
objections rest upon Indisputable
grounds and that I could only inter
pret the final adoption of section 23 as
arising ftOni a lack of confidence in
myself."
Opposition Developing
The section objected to by the presi
dent was embodied In an amendment
introduced by Senator Owen, Demo
crat, to take the place of a similar pro
posal by Senator Weeks, Republican
It was adopted by the senate 53 to a
after a brief debate.
The president and the executive de
partments, under the provision, would
be compelled "to keep said committee
fully advised as to such evpenditures
and contracts" and the committee
could compel attendance of witnesses
in such inquiries as it chose to make.

Many Idle Rumors.
Among the many rumors which were
in circulation yesterday, throughout
the district, was one to the effect that
Clarence Da trow, of McNanfara case
fame, had been retained by the "Wob
blies" to sue on the grounds of un
lawful deportation. In view of the
known condition of the I. W. W.'s
treasury in Columbus and of Darrow's
well known desire for fees in ad
vance, the story caused more laugh
ter than serious comment.
Another rumor was in circulation
yesterday morning that the "Wob
blies" would return to Bisbee last ev
ening accompanied by United States
troops. Inasmuch as they were re
leased from the custody of Uncle
Sam only Saturday, this report was
scouted on the ground that the war
department would not change its mir.d
so often or so soon. This was con
firmed when private dispatches from
Columbus told of the same conditions
holding there.
Sneaking Into Bisbee.
Some of the men deported to Co
lumbus have returned to Bisbee. They
have been seen on the streets of the
city but have not escaped the eyes of
the officers of the camp. At the
proper time they will be arrested and
charged with vagrancy. Those who
have no visible means of support will
be prosceuted and given an opportun

themselves in some other clime.

two hours daily to these branches of

the French system of selecting the
most efficient men for fighting, the

cleaning up. Accordingly each corporal
will be allowed to pick out 15 men
who in his estimation are the keenest
and most alert and have the best rec

in this manner and those not asked

will be relegated to camp duties.

By an almost unanimous vote the

realizing that a man of ability of the

of the Russian troops, has given "un

the news that lack of stability among

In the region of Smorgon and Krevo,
southeast of Vllna, is giving the Rus

In a fierce attack at Smorgon and
Krevo. the Russians drove a wedge
into the German lines to a depth of
two miles at various places and took
more than 1.00D prisoners. The Petro

that the lack of morale of certain de

the success in jeopardy, while the lat

GRAND HEADQUARTERS OF THE FRENCH ARMY
IN FRANCE, July 22 (Midnight, by the Associated
Press). The watchword of the trench troops at Verdun
"They shall not pass" has applied equally to the Cham
pagne and the French today showed the crown prince's army
that the Chemin des Dames was a closed road to them.
On Sunday morning the Germans made, in great force,
their fortieth attempt since the French captured Craonne, on
May 4, to secure possession of the famous road. This effort
was one of the biggest offensive movements they had made
since Verdun, so tar as artillery was concerned, and proved
an undoubted failure.
Four o'clock was striking when a terrific bombardment
was opened along the front extending from just west pf Cerny
to Berry-au-Bac. The front lines and rear position, and all
the roads leading thereto, were deluged with shells, both great
and small, as well as asphyxiating projectiles.
Aviators Busy Throughout Day
WILSON TO END
SHIP BUILDING
DISAGREEMENTS
President to Take Definite Ac
tion in Row Between Den
man and Goethals Within
Next Twenty-Four Hours.
At 5 o'clock the German infantry
started from their trenches. The great
est concentrations advanced between
Hurtebise and Casement Plateau ana
between Casemate and Calii'jrnie Pla-'
teau, where it was evidently hopea to!
rush Craonne. The correspondent was j
posted where he could observe the en
ure battle along the crest which stood '
out in the clearest atmosphere, but
rolling along it and over it were dense
clouds 'of black, grey and white smoke '
from tens of thousands of shells. !
French Guns Open Up
It was known that Prussian guards
and several divisions faced the Frencu
positions while other troops were hur-j
lying across tlie Aillette Valley from
the north. The French guns aid not
remain long mute, but answered sl.'jt
for shot, and when the German rein-!
forcements were observed approach
ing they poured a hurricane of project
iles directly into them, creating great
confusion and causing heavy losses. ;
Rifle and machine gun fire began;
creckling while the trench mortars
hurled torpedoes, and the ride grena
diers opened a wicked barrage fire as
s'jon as the Germans, who had been
waiting the prearranged ' signal to'
spring forward, began to leave their,
jumping-off parallels. j
Shock Unit Lead Way '
German shock units as usual led the
way, followed by waves of ordinary p-!
fantry who were to occupy and con-.
solidate any captured ground. In the
same period from Casemate to Califor
nie Plateau other German troops were
suffering heavily under similar condi
tions. But several times here they
gained small portions of the French
front, although nowhere did they reach
the crest itself.
Where their line bent momentarily
the French troops organized imme
diate counter attacks and reconquered
nearly everything temporarily taken
from them." A French captain wro
fell wounded early in the day and was
captured by the Germans was later
rescued by his own men when the Ger
mans were forced back. He affirmed
that German soldiers among whom he
lay declared that several waves of
German troops, when ordered to go
over the fjp. refused to venture into
the terrific fire which swept away ev
erything in the open.
German Gains Small
Aviators were busy throughout the
day and sometimes the sky was almost
covered with the smoke from the
shrapnel bursting around them. It was
a bay day, for. an infantry attack be
cause the clearness of the air mane
every movement, even in the narrow
communication trenches, visible iv the
airmen and to the observers in kite
balloons.
The gain of a few hundred yards of
a front-line trench, which is all that
remains in German hands, appears
small compensation for the fierce
fighting in the 40 attacks of the last
ten weeks, during which conservative
estimates place the German losses in
the vicinity of the Chemis des Dames
alone at six figures.
When the correspondent left the
field. at an advanced hour in the even
ing. J.he lighting was still proceeding,
accompanied by a hot artillery fire. .
WASHINGTON, July 23. Steps to
settle the shipping board row will be
taken by President Wilson, it was
said today at the White House, within
the next 24 hours.
There was no intimation as to the
president's move, but officials in close
touch with the situation believe that
Chairman Denman and Major General
Goethals, manager of the board's fleet
corporation, will be told that they must
compose their differences and start
immediately upon the government'
shipbuilding program.
In support of this belief there were
indications today that the shipping
boards and General Goethals are work
ing on a more harmonious basis than
they have been at any time since first
disagreeing on the question of wooden
ships. President Wilson, it is believed,
is of the opinion that more would be
lost than gained by letting either Mr.
Denman or General Goethals go. Many
oicials think he will make a definite
decision of authority and end a situa
tion in which each holds himself re
sponsible for the building program.
The White House denial of reports'
that General Goethals offered to re
sign is taken to mean that the presi
dent still believes the program can be:
completed best under the present ar-
rangement if a definite division of au
thority is made.
Reports today that Captain J. 15.
White and John A. Donald, members I
of the shipping board, had resigned,
renewed rumors of differences in the
board itself. Captain White, it was ex- j
plained, however, asked to be relieved !
some time ago on -account of ill-health, '
but since then has recovered and dc-l
sires to remain on the board. The.;
resigantion of Mr. Donald was denied j
emphatically at the White House and '
by Mr. Donald.
Suggestions that the building pro-j
gram has been delayed to any appreci-i
able extent were met at the shipping
board's offices today with the state
ment that contracts for seventy-five,
vessels have just been let and that!,
the government could not rush into'
the expenditure of hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars without first giving
careful consideration to every phase1
of the program. !

into the surrounding country, to the
nearby streams. With the mine oper
ators the principal . concern was the
maintenance of pumping operations at
the various properties which was done
by volunteer help of mine superintend

Prominent mine managers were in
frequent consultation during the day
and there was the Usual crop of ru

MEXICAN BOATMEN AT
TAMPICO OUT ON STRIKE
MEXICO CITY, July 23. Boatmen
on the Panuoo river at Tampico have

countries as well as in Mexico.
WOFEN TOO AMBITIOUS
Excessive ambition leads all sorts
of women to exert themselves beyond
their strength. The girl striving for
honors in school, the busy housewife,
the shop-girl, the society climber or
leader, all over-tax their natural
powers of endurance. Then come
nervous troubles, backaches, head
aches, frequently organic troubles,
which reduce hera almost to despair.
Women suffering thus should first
recognize the necessity of putting on
the brakes and slowing down. Be
sides this, to remedy the mischief
already done to their health, the best
reliance is upon that famous and
standard medicine for women's ail
ments, Lydia E. Pinkham's Vegetable
Compound. Adv.
also to tue senate liquor and and $2
a bushel wheat amendments. Prohibi
tion advocates in the house want to
force acceptance of the . house "bone
do" provisions, 'or at least to compro
mise on a provision giving the presi
dent some control over beer and light
wnes and power to commandeer ds
tilled liquors either in or out Jf bond.
A large group of house members are
opposed to leaving any minimum price
for wheat in the bill:
Fight Is Expected
Indications are tuat the house con
ferees will be named tonion'jw. A
prolonged deadlock may ensue' but so
determined are the- house, administra
tion leaders that they have decided
to pay no need to urgent appeals for
speeding up the bill as long as the 'Jb
jcctional joint ocniniittee and food
board features are retained. They will
insist that to assign three men to a
food board instead of vesting the pow
ers in one man w'ould only delay re
sults by scattering authority.
Efforts probably will be made in the
house when the bill conies up tomor
row to instruct the conferees to concur
in all of the senate amendments but
administration leaders aer confident of
their ability to block such a move.

WASHINGTON, July 23. More
than sixty per cent of the $2,000,000,
000 Liberty Loan already has beea
paid into the treasury. Today's treas
ury statement, the first in 24 days,
shows paymcu June 30 on the lib
erty Loan account of $1,3S5,024,456.
Only twenty per cent of the loan,
$400,000,000, was due June 30. the two
payments of the two and eighteen per
cent, respectively, being due June 13
and Juue 2S. The amount thus volun
tarily paid into the treasury by sub
scribers ahead of time totalled but
$13,000,000 under a round billion dol
lars. No Financial Ripple.
Notwithstanding the enormous
withdrawals to meet payments of the
loan more than three times the sum
due the redepositing of the funds
.:mong the bunking institutions pre
vented even a ripple of disturbance in
the money markets.
The heavy payments on the Liberty
Loan account ran up the govern
ment's l.alunce of cash on hand June
30 to the record figure of $l,064.0St,
"50. This was after the treasury de
partment had redeemed certificates of
indebtedness amounting to $626,000'.
000. Because of the immense amount of
clerical labor involved :n tabulating
payments and checking reserve bank
reports, the treasury statement for
June 30 was delayed a record time
this year. Usually it comes out two
or three days after the fiscal ypir
ends. Even today's late figures, a
tootnote states, are subject to revi
sion. ;
Year Shatters Records.
In other respects than those affect
ing the loan, the statement of the
government's final activities for the
fiscal year is a record. Total receipts
from all sources touched the new
high level of $3,475,159,935 of which
approximately $2,300.000. 00 was from
the loan end the sale of certificates of
indebtedness. Ordinary revenue re
ce'pts increased nearly $350,'oo,000
over the preceding fiscpl year, reach
ing a total of J1.122.57G,j!29. These
were' apportioned as follows:
Customs receipts $225.9?r,83!. an
increase of more than $14,000,000 over
the preceding fiscal year; ordinary in
ternal revenue receipts, coverine tax
es on distilled spirits, beer, tobacco,
oleomargerine and other articles $449.
209.855. an increase of JS3.10n.0ii0; in
come tas receipts $350.0().0O4, an in
crease $36,000,000 or IS per rent; and
miscellaneous receipts. $87,373,298, an
increase of $34,500,000 or 68 per cent.
Panama Canal totals for the yeas

WORDS OF CENSURE AND WORDS OF PRAISE.
The Review is in receipt of several letters lately,
some of which praise Us course during the recent cop
per strike and I. W. W. drive, and some of which blame
in fact, they threaten. The letters of praise are signed ;
the threatening letters are not During all the recent
unrest in this district the Review merely did its duty, the
same as other citizens who had the good of their com
munity at heart, did. We printed all the news of the
strike and the big drive without bitterness or reviling.
On our editorial page we gave utterance to our personal
opinions. That we condemned the strike goes without
saying. And we severely castigated its instigators. For
their poor dupes we expressed only pity and regret.
There can be no argument about the causes of the
strike or the rgihteousenss of the action of our citizens
on the morning of July 12. They did a good Job, but thpy
missed a few wobblies as is evidenced by letters mailed
in Bisbee within the last few days and sent to the editor
of the Review. They are unprintable. They are un
mailable also. Their obscene revilings and profane
threats are copied from the textbooks of the I. W. W.
school. Let us turn from them to clean and pleasant
things.
From far off Philadelphia comes commendation of
the Review and its articles on the strike and the big
Drive and also an inquiry as to whether "big, strong,
willing American workmen are needed in Bisbee now."
The writer then goes to give his credentials, which are
good.
From Indianapolis, Indiana, come words of praise
that warm the heart. The writer is Lannes McPhetridge, I
director of a bureau of publicity and advertising, and this
is what he says:
"I have just read the editorial In the Re
view of July 13 on "The Great Wobbly Drive." It
is a masterpiece of editorial writing. It is a
newspaper classic that ought to be read by every
good citizen of America, for it would be an in
spiration to him In what men CAN DO and WILL
DO in defense of town and home when a com
mon enemy comes, and what men can and
SHOULD DO in rallying about a common cause
to "put it over" if the cause is a good one. I be
lieve the . citizenship of Bisbee have won the
applause of all America in their show of com
munity patriotism and courage."
When men of peace take up arms to do their duty
and then lay them down again the cause for which they
acted goes marching on. Its influence grows and wid
ens. The memory of their act lives. Men in far-off cities
are thrilled by Uieir patriotism. The bis wobbly drive
not only placed Bisbee on the map, it won her citizens
and their brave sheriff a place in the hearts of their
countrymen.
A few sympathizers of the I. W. W. school of an
archy still snarl, but the masses of the people every
where have placed the seal of approval and admiration
upon our acts.
An increase of nearly fifty millions of dollars in as
sessable wealth is not a bad showing for Cochise county
for the past year. Not alone have we made a substantial
increase in our industrial wealth, but what is more sig
nificant, we have made a fine stride forward in our agri
cultural valuations. Many thousands of acres of land
have ben added to the productive list. Irrigation, inten
sive and intelligent farming methods and the great in
crease in population are beginning to have their certain
effect. Vast and profitable as are the state's mining
interests, it would be a big mistake to lean back and
depend upon them. A state becomes great only through
the advancement of all its resources, hand in hand.
Not alone in the United States, but from all over
the world come complaints of freight congestion. Even
far off Yokohama, in Japan, is covered up with bales
and boxes that await shipment. The high price of coal
is charged to lark of shipping facilities. In fact, they
are charging everything to lack of transportation that is
not tharged to the war. Acres of loaded cars block rail
road y;irds all over the country. Contracted sea trans
portation is one cause of this and inadequate freight plat
forms and loading facilities is another. But these may
well not be the whole cause.
HANDS OFF, GIRLS
Brigadier General Edwin F. Glenn, In command of
some 11,000 student officers and soldiers at Fort Benja
min Harrison, has Issued an appeal to women who think
they ought to do something to entertain bis charges.
His advice in three words is, "Leave them alone!"'
"My answer to the-question, 'What can we do for
the soldier' is here at home let him alone. The Amer
ican soldier when let alone is the most peaceful and un
complaining animal In the world. You don't think much
of him in time of peace, but in war time you fall over
yourselves to do something for him.
"Please, please, don't send them things to eat they
have all they want. We are doing the very best we can
for these boys, and we are going to give them a sporting
chance, and that is all anybody can ask."
When the troops go abroad, good reading matter
and small comforts not provided by the government will
be acceptable. Gen. Glenn said. .
The camp is being flooded with silly, emotional let
ters from girls. These letters are a nuisance. The boys
who get them pass them around and laugh over their
contents. That the young womanhood of the land should
make Itself a laughing-stock in the eyes of the army
men is only one of the objections to this practice.
There is plenty for young women to do in the way
of making the soldiers comfortable. And there are ac
credited agencies for collecting the things they make or
buy for the Sammies abroad. The Sammies at home are
engaged in the serious business of learning their new
duties In the shortest time possible. It is the business
of the young women of the country to uphold them in this
work. Writing silly slush to an unknown man in the
training camps is an Insult to his character and intelligence.
THIS NATION IS AT WAR.
The stern fact that this nation is' at war was realized
in three-quarters of a million homes yesterday when the
first drawing was made under the conscription act In a
little while another half-million will be called. Not all
of our people have been inclined to take the war serf
ously. But it will be taken seriously enough before it is
over.
Congress will be called to a hard accounting for its
criminal delay of vital legislation. Trifling and bicker
ing and indecision in high places will be probed. Spiies
will be wiped out Traitors will be placed In prison. Agi
tators and loafers and slackers and speculators and all
the campfollower swarm of harpies and vultures will be
futhlessly suppressed.
This nation will be in deadly earnest when it has
more than a million .homes represented on the battle
line. No enemy will be allowed behind these boys' backs.
No anarchist or pacifist or socialist or any other kind of
"1st" will be allowed to hamper the flow of food and
munitions upon which they will depend in their danger
ous task.
To every wail and whine and yelp and roar and squeal
and scowl there will be one answer: THIS NATION IS
AT WAR!
"Off again, on again," might well be Russia's slogan.
One day she is and the next day she isn't She is the worst
"in and outer" the world has ever seen. But most of
the time she is "out." Beaten to a pulp by Von Hinden
burg at the beginning of the war, she kept on fighting
fairly strong. She defeated the Austrians with regular
ity but every time a German helmet showed on the fight
ing line she turned tail and ran. The Germans chased
the bear clear back beyond Warsaw and drove him out
of Rumania. Then Russia staged a revolution and quit
fighting altogether. And when the allies had given up
hope of her ever doing anything she came back with
startling suddenness and' beat the Austrians again. Then
the Germans said "boo!" at ker and she is again on the
run. Queer sort of an undependable, irresponsible, er
ratic, temperamental, brave. Incompetent big, cowardly,
disorganized sort of an ally we have in Russia, anyhow.
New Y'ork City is a vast drill ground. The war with
Germany begun in earnest last week so far as the me
tropolis is concerned. In the armories of that city 18,000
men are being drilled "for service. Not since the days of
the civil war have so many armed men been seen on
the streets. Platoon after platoon and company after
company of the new army march and countermarch all
day long up and down the asphalt streets while the
crowds look on in wond?r and admiration.
Allowing one exemption for every man taken, the
list of names printed in the Review Saturday morning

names printed. These men will be called in the order

NEW YORK, July 23. Russia, as
now constituted, is as little likely to
make a separate peace as is the Unit
ed States, in the opinion of C. H. Boyn
ton of New York, president of the
American-Russian Chamber of Com
merce. Mr. B'oynton, who is now in
Petrograd, has forwarded to the or
ganization, of which he is president
a statement on the conditions in Rus
sia, in which he presents an optimistic
view of the Russian outlook. Wher
ever separate peace has been ment'jn
ed it has been howled down with in
dignation, be writes. Efforts made by
the Russian extremists to create dis
orders have been overthrown not by
armed force but by the force of pub
lic opinion. "If in the future appear
ances in Russia should seem alarm
ing," Mr. Doynt'on asserted, "the. re.
situation will be in the hands' of a
ministry composed of the best Russia
can offer." He predicted that the task
of re-organizing the government's poli
cies will be accomplished before man;
months.
Industrial operations, according to
Mr. Boynton, would at present' meet
insurmountable obstacles owing to the
requirements of the war; but he de
clared that American capital and mer
chants interested in the Russian field
should lose no time in preparing and
equipping themselves for the huge
commercial business which, in his
opinion, is certain to be coincident
with the end of the war. Mr. Boynton's
statement follows:
"That one may have a fair and Just
appreciation of the events which have
taken and are yet to take place in Rus
sia, it is necessary to understand the
psychology of the situation. A nation
under a rule Vf absolute autocracy for
centuries suddenly found itself an ab

or in speech, was released from ali

and sentiments were able to find full
vent The government has allowed
every phase of political discussion
and even that of such an extremist at
Lenin, to proceed without interference
and refused every suggestion or r
pression. If under these circumstances
there should be a babble of conflicting
opinions and some fanatic agitation, it
is not only understandable, but indeec
quite natural. The wisdom of the pol

The self-restraint and moderation
shown by the entire nation is the best
tribute to its sobriety, solidarity and
reasonableness and the best promise
of what the future has in store. The
Russian people are naturally home-

They are neither arrogant nor quar

Only Local Disorders

"It should not be overlooked that
these disorders were fjeal and that
the nation at large, so enormous in
territory, quietly pursued its ordinary
vocations. Since that day tnere has
not been the slightest disturbance or
demonstration anywhere. A recent
meeting of the governors representing
nearly all European Russia showed
that the nation at large surported the

patriotically to the limit of their phy

WILL BE HEAD OF
STATE'S MINUTE MEN
George J. Stoneman has been select
ed by the Arizona Council of Iefen:?e
as state chairman of the "Four-M'n-ute
Men," an organization of nation
al importance authorized by President
Wilson and which is now being per
fected by the National Defense Coun
cil. In order to Impress upon the people
the necessity of winning the war with
Germany and winning it quickly, the
"Four-Minute Men" have entered the
field and there are now 3,000 speakers
under the direction of their stale,
chairmen engaged in presenting four
minute addresses to motion picture au
diences. Mr. Stoneman will have the appoint
ment of all the speakers who will ap
pear before Arizona audiences. He will
immediately perfect his organization
in Arizona- The "Four-Minute Men"
have the backing of the montion pic
ture Industry in the United States
which has offered to the president ev
ery assistance. The subjects will be
provided by the committee on public
information of the National Defence
Council and will be of national Im
portance at this time.
The "Four-Minute Men" is specializ
ed publicity service giving four-minute
talks by local speakers who are intro
duced to; their audiences by a slide
thrown on the screen. The speaking
takes place in the intermission.
The plan operates something like
this: The introduction slide is shown,
the speaker is ready at' the platform,
steps out before the audience and
speaks four minutes. There is an ab
solute limit placed upon all speakers
to four minutes in order to respect
the arrangements made with the mo
tion picture men of the United States.
The "Four-Minute Men" is an or
ganization to-last during the duration
of the war. It is expected .that the
(peaking plan will be in full operation
next week throughout the state as
Mr. Stoneman already has- begun to
perfect his organization for Arizona.

are being made by those who keep
through which the moral and social
welfare of the soldiers and sail'jrsj
will be looked after has the hearty j
endorsement of the three American:
cardinals and the entire hierarchy of
the church in the United States. j
The selection of the Knights of Co-'
lumbus as the official agency of Cath
olic service in the army and navy is
a direct result of the efficient work
(Tone for the soldiers on the Mexican
border In selecting the Knights of
Columbus for this work the war de
partment places the great Catholic fra
ternal order on the same basis as the
Y. M. C. A., which takes care of all
the non-Catholic religious and social
welfare work in the army and navy.
The Knights of Columous will work in
co-operation with the official Catholic
chaplains and will also have to pay
the expenses of many other unofficial
chaplains. The knights will have to
erect Catholic centers and suitable
places for the celebration' t mass in
earn of the 16 cantonments to l.e es
tablished in this country. In these
Knights of Columbus centers all men
in the service will be made more heart
ily welcome.
This is the largest task ever under
taken by the Knights of Columbus crd
as already said, the responsibility i-
set. In some manner it started to
move. The woman casually looked
behind and thought she had given the
driver enough room to pass. There
was no driver, however, and when "the
machine approached her it suddenly
swerved and ran oyer the Woman.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
(By Review Leaseu Wire)
NEW YORK. July 23 The erratic
and conflicting currents that have ap
peared in the stock market in recent
weeks were again manifest today.
Prices receded, althouah speculative
issues yielded mainly from sheer in
ertia! public interest being at the low
est ebb.
The more favorable bank statement
with its strengthening of reserves,
and the easier money market were
more than counterbalanced by fresh
concern, respecting the Russian situa
tion and the time-worn question ot
war profits and taxes.
Steamship shares were almost the
only strong features of the half of
the session. These gains were more
than surrendered later as a result of
Washington advice to the effect that
the administration is to act with this
country's allies in effecting a material
reduction of prevailing marine freight
rates.
Vnited States Steel reacted from its
top price of 123.i to 121. closing at a
net loss or Vn points, the Bethlehem
Fteels, new and old. fell 2 and three
respectively and others' of the same
group an average of 2 points. Oils
yielded 1 to 2 and sugars 1 to 2.
Totals sales of stock amounted to
10.000 shares.
Bonds were irregular with free
selling of Anglo-French 5's at a slight
decline, the Liberty issues varying
from 99:43 to 99.9. Total sales, par
value, segregated $2,825,000.
1 IT. S. Bonds were unchanged on call.
-. CHICAGO GRAINS.
CHICAGO, July 23. Corn prices as
cended today to the highest point yet
this season. Distillers competed
sharply with other industries for the
limited offerings available. The mar
ket closed nervous, at a net advance
of. Hl to 1 cents with September at
16634 and December 116 to 117.
Wheat gained 34 to 4 cents. Oats
finished unchanged to cents lower
and provisions up 12 to 70 cents.
Tightening of values in the corn
market began right at the outset and
continued without any great hind
rance throughout the day.
Wheat rose in accord with the im
proved iutlook for the establishment
of a government minimum price of $2
a bushel at primary centers.
Unwelcome rains made the oats
market strong.
Provisions jumped on account of ad
vances in corn and hogs.

NEW YORK, July 23. Prices of the

Liquidation was conducted in orderly

evident that a buying power of con
sequence cannot be stimulated at the
present time when 60 many uncertain
ties both domestic and foreign are so
much discussed the chief disturbing
influence was the dissemination of
news touching on the Russian situa
tion and the trend of events in that
country are again fostering apprehen-
sion and tending to make the interna

cated than ever. - While there is a
feeling that the price fixing program
to be dictated by the government will
not be as drastic' as formerly antici

more disposed to await more concrete

Wisdom in the
Re-Draft of Laws
"The new government is re-drafting
laws relating to finance, trade and in
dustry in such, a way as to facilitate
the rapid economic development of
Russia and allow broad expansion of
hej commercial and industrial life.
Russia opens her arms to serious busi
ness men whose object is not traffic in
concessions, but actual development
and production, and for such her terms
are sure to be liberal.
"America occupies a fortunate posi
tion in relati'on to the people of lb is
nation, who have been sentimentally
touched by the evidence of American
friendship and our quick recognition
of the new government. President
Wilson's address to congress, in why-h
he set forth America's attitude toward
the war, has been recognized as prac
tically expressing the same views as
are held by the provisional govern
ment, and Tzeretelli, who is one of
the leaders of the left, emphatically
denied to the duma that his party was
considering separate peace, and stated
that it was an outrage against pa
triotic men to attempt to place upon
thefn the burden of such a position.
The embassy and consulate V-flicial3
are in close touch with the new gov
ernment and everywhere Americans
received the most courteous and cor
dial attention.
Absolutely No
Separate Peace
"The high commission which irui
sia is sending to the United States
should receive greatest consideration
and the United States as well as Rus
sia will benefit Immensely by the in
formation which can be mutually ex
changed. "Wherever separate peace has been
mentioned it has been howled down
with indignation and, unless my judg
ment is entirely astray, Russia, as to
day constituted, is as little likely to
make a separate peace as is the Unit
ed States."

(By Review Leased Wire.)
LONDON, July 23. A threatened
general election was again averted
when the house of comnitm tonight by
a three-to-one vote, defended the War
die amendment to the corn production
bill, which the ministers had announ
ced" their intention to treat as a vote
Of confidence. This was the most crit
ical amendment to the bill and the
government victory is regarded as in
suring the safe passage of the meas
ure despite the fact that 'it is heartily
disliked by a large section of parlia
mentarians and the public.
Rowland E. Prothero president of
the board of agriculture, announced
that the government had decided it
could not accept the amendment to
raise the minimum wage lOr the labor
ers from 25 to 30 shillings a week.
Mr. Prothero said the average wage
in 1909 and 1910 was 17 shillings 10
pense, and the increase to 25 would
mean that during the operation of the
bill the farmers would have to pay in

LIES IN HANDS OF
MINISTER KERENSKY
(Continued From Page One)
Germans continued their violent bom
bardments of the French positions
near Hurtebise and Craonne on Mon
day. Near Cerny the French them
selves took the Initiative in a small
operation and gained ground and cap
tured men of the army of the German
crown prince.
Canadians Gaining.
The Canadians have taken another
hack at the German line protecting
the coal fields south of Lens and
again have apparently advanced their
line. Although the British commun
ication does not give the extent of the
success, merely announcing that the
troops reached their objective with
slight losses. The Associated Press
correspondent with the British forces
says the Canadians forced their way,
to the second line of German defense ,
along a front of 760 yards and bombed
and destroyed positions and took pris
oners. On the other fronts there has been '
little activity, althoueh further suc
cesses have been gained by the Brit
ish against the Germans in East Afri-;
ca and the Turks in Palestine. i
Success Jeopardized.
PETROGRADE, July 23. The Rus-j
sian official statement regarding the,
eastern Galician operations says: j
"Western front: In the direction of
Vilna, iji the neighborhood of Krevo, j
out troops attacked the enemy and ;
occupied a portion of his positions in
the district of Tsary-Bogushi. penetrat-'
ing the enemy territory to a depth of,
two miles in places. Over one thous-'
and Germans were taken prisoner.
"The development of a further suc-i
cess is being jeopardized by the In-1
stability and moral weakness of cer-i
tain detachments. Particularly note
worthy was the gallant conduct of the
officers, great numbers of them per
ishing during the fulfillment of their
duties. '
"On the upper course of the Sereth
from Zalocce to Tarnopol. there has
been rifle firing. South of Berezovi-ca-Velka
the, enemy is conducting an
intense artillery fire.
"Between the rivers Sereth. Stripa
and Zlota Lipa the enemy continues
his offensive, occupying the villages
i of Nastastov. Itenlave (on the Stripal.
Uvse and Slavintln. While re-establishing
order among the units, tho
chief of the divisional staff. General
j Staff Lieutenant-Colonel Old. was kill

Russians Retreating.
BERLIN. July 23 (Via London)
The German official announcement
says:
"Army group of Generaf vo Boehm
Erniolli: Our counter-attack south of
the .Sereth has developed into an op-
eration. The Russians have retreated
into the Carpathians.
"We stand on the heights inimedi-
ately west of Tarnopol, have crossed
the Rohatyn-Ostroff railway line east
of our old position and begun a for
ward movement on both sides of the
Dniester. South of the railway the'
enemy offered strong resistance.
"Front of Arch-Duke Joseph; Along
the ridcre of the Carpathians to the
Putna river the Russian fighting ac
tivity has noticeably increased espe
cially on the southern portion. Sev
eral enemy thrusts were repulsed. On
the lower Sereth the lively firing
points to impending battles."
Hand Is Expected.
COPENHAGGEN", July 21. The
Austro-Cerman flood in eastern Galicia
has been turned southward In en
deavors to get in the rear of the Rus
sian armies between Brzezany and the
Dniester, Austrian correspondents at
the front report in dispatches to their
newspapers. The Teutonic forces en
gaged in this operation they declare,
have reached Koseva station, ten miles
east of Brzezany, which is in Austro
German hands. The Koseva-Tarnopol
railroad has been crossed by them in
a number of places. These dispatches
forecast the Russian army's stand be
hind the Sereth and reiterate the re
ports that Tsrnopol was in flames.
Progress Is Rapid.
BERLIN. July 23. (Vit London.)
The supplementary report from Ger
man headquarters issued this evening
says:
"Strong Russian attacks southwest
of Dvinsk failed. In eastern Galicia
success follows success, with rapid
progress."
