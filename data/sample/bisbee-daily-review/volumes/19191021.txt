Referred to as "Seeker fori
Help in Carrying on Fight
Against Steel Industry",
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. While f
members of the 3ehlrTe Tabor commit
tee investigating the steel strike sat
fairly dazed and dumbfounded, Jacob
Margolis, of Pittsburgh. I. W. W. at
torney and admitted advocate of so
cial revolution, today told them
a J
story of ultra-radical activities which '
he said underlay and were associated
-Kiin me nationwide sinKe oi steei t
workers.
Even more remarkable to his hear
ers was the Pittsburgh attorney's de
lineation of a partially successful at
tempt covering the past two years to
fuse at PittsBurgh, for an unstated
but vaguely hinted revolutionary
purpose, the combined forces of the
I. W. W.. bolshevikl. awl Russian in-1
dustrial Workers, whose Imagina-
tion. he acknewledtred. had been '
caueht by the successes of Lenine
and Trotzky in Russia.
Implicates Foster
All were working, he told the com
mittee calmly, "to create a new so
ciety within tbe shell of the old.?
Throughout Margolis 'story ran.
the name of William Z. Foster, sec
retary o the steel workers commit
tee, to whom Chairman Kenyon of
the labor committee forced a fre
quent recurrence by a cross examin
ation in which dictagraph records of
telephone conversations, photograph
ed copies of Margolis correspond- j
ence, and similar matters played
large part.
Margolis cooly classified himself
as an "American syndicalist," in
which capacity he had worked with
and for the I. W. W. organization and
a "Tolstoian anarchist."
Tells of Russians
Secretary Foster came into the
testimony not so much as a radical
agitator himself, but as a seeker for
help in conducting the industrial
fieht in the steel industry. Margolis
told or a "union of Russian work
men" existing in nnd around Pitts
burgh, revolutionary in its objects,
and said at Foster's request, or with
his cognizance, he secured the In
dorsement of that organization for
the steel strike..
"The Russians had a tri-state
meeting at Youngstown in August,"
Margolis explained. "It was a dele
gate assembly. I- was there, and;
made a speech asking them to en-
dorse the steel strike and give Its
support. This they agreed to do.

In very small amounts, according to
the capacity ' Of the workers, until

The organization, built upon these

Within the last week R. J. Wil

Senator Watson, . Republican, of In

ment and tintroduced a resolution for

The senate referred the resolution
to a committee, and Acting Chairman

statement declaring that if Senator
Watson's resolution would be joined
with one recently introduced by Sena
tor Sherman, Republican, Illnois,
charging the commission with conspi

Center of Sedition
Disclaiming that he spoke in de
fense of the meat packers, who, he
Reclared Should be punished if guilty
of the charges made against them,
Senator Watson told the senate his
contention was that American busi
ness should not be investigated by
men who avow a determination to de
stroy it and that the government
should not be represented by those
who preach, a doctrine of its over
throw. Declaring that the Chicago office
of the trade commission from which
the packers' Investigation was con
ducted were "a center of, sedition and
anarchy a nesting place for Social
ists," Senator Watson went through
the list of men employed by the com
mission and charged various ones with
being pro-German, anti-ally, admirers
of Lenine and Trotzky, advocates of
a soviet form of government, partici
pants in Red demonstrations and pa
rades and diseminators of Socialist

IN BIG STRIKE
Prospects for Conciliation in
Steel Mills More Remote as
Labor Leader and Public
Representative Clash Again
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. In his
first pronouncement before the Na
tional conference, Judge E. H. Gary,
chairman of the board of the Unit
ed States' Steel corporation, sitting
as a representative of capital, today
reaffirmed his position that the steel
strike "should not be arbitrated or
compromised," and objected to ac
tion on' that issue by the confer
ence. The steel official also restated his
belief in the open shop and the
right to determine terms of employ
ment between employe and employ
er. This statement brought from
Samuel Gompers, president of ' the
American Federation of Labor, and
leader of the labor group in the
conference, the charge that Judge
Gary was taking ' the attitude that
"there is-no othts? opinion in the
matter."
Referring to the corporation chair
man request that the conference
take no action in the strike, the
labor leader declared that if the
real industrial issues were to be
brushed aside there was no purpose
in continuing the conference.
While the clash of the two lead
ers on the conference floor admit
tedly further removed ' the hope of
an agreement on the dominant is
sue of collective bargaining, pros
pects of conciliation were consid
ered still more remote tonight than
it was permitted to become known
that the representatives of capital
after an all-day session were stead
fast in their refusal to accept the
Russell-Endicott resolution for rec
ognition of collective bargaining,
which has been approved by ' the
public and labor groups.
The employers ; again went into
session tonight, but the members of
the group privately admitted that
reconvening of the conference to
morrow would probably find them
still in no mood to yield on the
vital point of dealing with labor
representatives chosen outside their
own plants.

NEW YORK, Oct. 20. Despite de

opera should not be given In New
York until' the peace treaty was
signed, "Die Miestersinger" was pre
sented In German at the Lexington
theater tonight, while thousands of ,avertinK the strike of 500.000 bitu
soldiers, sailors, marine and civil-j minous coal miners, set for Novem-
ians fought with the police in an at
tempt to reach the theater and stop
the production.
Hundreds of soldiers, sailors and
marines gathered in front of the
theater and when the doors opened
they raised a howl f derision and
anger.
Parade With Flag
Then, with an American flag at its
head, a long column of uniformed
men swung down the street. At their
appearance a call for police reserves
was sent in. The service men were
led by a marine wearing a Croix de
Guerre. A few minutes after the
curtain had been raised and the
strain? of German music slftel out
through .the . doors. - th,e veterans
pressed forward, only to driven back
and temporarily dispersed by mount
ed police.
On learning' that directors of the
Star Opera company intended to give
the performance, regardless of his
order, the mayor issued a statement
in which he said that he had directed
the police not to interfere with the
opera "until I could obtain the ad
vice of ihe corporation council to the
end I may proceed legally."
Shots Fired
Several shots were fired as the
former service men time and again
charged the police lines or laid down
a barrage of bricks, stones and other
missiles in an attempt to force thefr
way through.
Soon after the performance start
ed, a crowd of about 300 service men
were driven away from the vicinity
o fthe theater, but after reaching
Times square were reinforced, and
about 1,000 strong, started back, only
to be met "by a squad of mounted
police which scattered them. Dur
ing the remainder of the performance
the crowd fought valiantly to reach
the theater, but failed.
Reports during the early evening
as to whether the performance
would be presented were confusing
alike to service men and patrons.
Police stationed around the theater
notified both that the play would not
be given.
Mayor Backs Down
Mavor Hylan had prohibited it,
they said. Mayor Hylan said so him- J
self in a statement early in ins

LEWIS AGAIN
REFUSES TD
END STRIKE
Labor Heads Will Not Rescind
Order and Operators Re
fuse to Discuss Terms; No
Chance for Any Settlement
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20. On the
eve of a conference called by the
secretary of labor in the hope of
ber 1, John L. Lewis, president of
the United Mine Workers of Amer
ica, announced tonight that the
strike order would not be rescinded
unless operators met all demands,
including the five-day week.
Unless the strike order is with
drawn, the operators will not enter
into negotiations looking to an ad
justment of the differences, accord-
; ing to Thomas T. Brewster, head of
the Coal Operators' . committee.
The conference tomorrow will be
attended by Secretary Wilson and
tlys full scale committees represent
ing miners and operators, each com
prising 32 members, but the general
view, of ech group was that noth
ing would come of the meeting. Sec
retary Wilson, acting as government
mediator, by direction of the presi
dent's cabinet, still was hopeful to
night, however, that the factions
would get together and not plunge
the country into a strike at .iio oe
ginning of winter with not more
than a month's stock of coal on
hand.
After conferring with members of
the miners' committee who arrived
during the day. President Lewis
declared there would be no compro
mise of any of the issues involved,
reiterated that the old war time
wage agreement went out existence
with the end of hostilities nearly a
year ago and that operators could
meet the new wage scale demand-
pd without increasing the cost ot
coal. Lewis entered vigorous denial
of reports that in standing out for
the five-day week the mine workers j
were trying to force through an ultra-radical
doctrine.
Although the full scale committees
fix the pay" in the central competi
tive field, embracing Indiana, Illi
nois, Ohio and western Pennsylvania
it is alleged the strike order af
fected bituminous miners every
where, who, he said, will quit work
the first of next month unless some
agency meanwhile can prevent it.
ST. LOUIS, Oct. 20. There is re
tarded building development extend
ing over practically all of the United
States which, when under way, will
tax the capacity of existing mort
gage machinery to the utmost, ac
cording to the report of the real
estate securities committee of the
Investment Bankers' association to
night. Aside from this, continues the re
port, a considerable portion of many
of our cities, notably New York, will
practically have to be rebuilt in the
next twenty years, and the existing
mortgage machinery is inadequate
for the purpose.
The committee says that a recent
study in 25 cities indicates that labor
costs havo Increased during the last
two years an average of 55 per cent,
and material prices 70 per cent. The
higher labor and building costs have
prevented a more rapid development
of the mortgage business at a time
when, with these factors normal, the
growth would have been pronounced,
says the report.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 20. Taking

visions of the peace treaty in ad
vance of the treaty's ratification ty
the senate, the administration an
nounced today that American diplo
matic and military participation in
certain of these provisions must wait
until the senate has acted.
At the state department it was de
clared this government would not ac
cept the invitation of the supreme
council at Versailles to take a place
immediately on the International
commissions set up by th'2 .rcaty,
and at the war department It was
made clear that no American troops
would be used without senate sanc
tion to police districts where the
treaty provided for plebiscites under
the military supervision of the great
aowers.
Announcements Made ' '
The two announcements were made
simultaneously and generally were
accepted in the senate, wnere the
possibility : of- premature .American
participation in the treaty has been
one of the storm centers of criticism,
as amounting to an administration
declaration of policy on the subject.
Senators on both sides of the treaty
controversy expressed the opinion
privately tonight that the adminis
tration stand would aid in hastening
the final roll call on ratification.

use of American troops. Secretary
Baker denied specifically suggestions
I made in the senate debate that 5.000
soldiers recently sent to Coblenz
were to proceed to uoper Silesia and
help in the plebiscite there prior to
American ratification. He declared
the department realized fu!y that It
would have no authority to take such
a steD if a senate reservation tor-
bidd!n it were adopted, and added
thatl in the circumstances there was
no desire to anticipate senate action.
Limits Participation
A reservation on this subject and
one limiting American participation
in the various diplomatic commis
sions to be created are in prepara
tion. One effect of the state dppart
ment's announcement was to set at
rest reports that President Wilson
might disregard the advice of the for
eign relations committee and name
an American to act unofficially on
the powerful reparations commis
sion. When he asked fthe commit
tee's consent to such a stop some
weeks ago, it replied that neither it
nor the executive had any authority
to put treaty provisions into force

plished. It is understood, however, that

Watson further charged, the commis

Admired Red Leaders
Samuel W. Tator, who, with Chase,
had general charge of the investiga

"an avowed admirer of Lenine and
Troteky, and frequently expressed his
admiration of the soviet government
of Hussia."
- "He was pronouncedly, against the
allies in the world war," continued the
senator, ''and frequently made the
statement .that all big business should
be confiscated by the government."
A. S. Kravitz, accredited in the com
mission' report with "Important aid"
in the investigation; Senator Watson
charged,-was a "Russian from Riga,
an intellectual socialist of the most
pronounced type, and throughout the
war intensely pro-German.

COPPER QUEEN UNDERGROUND NOTES
(By G. B. LYMAN)
Czar Division. Work ot leveling

within a few days. The zar is one ot
the oktrst mines in the dislrict, and
has produced many thousands of tons
of ore. With the removal of this ore
the 'overly ins ground has settled, as
shown by the large cracks extending
across the surface of Queen Hill. In

zone and it is now possible to re
cover a large tonnage of high grade
ore. This w:ill be accomplished by
carefully planned operations involv
ing the size of fire doors and con
struction of 4 , concrete bulkheads to
control gases from that part of the
ore body where the fire is still ac
tive. On the 1400 level two new
drifts have been recently started, one
heading towards the Gardner shaft
and the other below known ore bod

Southwest Division. The new

ly. The shaft is being raised from
the third Sou; h west level to the sur
face, a distance of about 700 feet, and
will emerjre at the top of Queen Hill
between the present Southwest of
fice and the Uncle Sam mine. Work
of raising is being carried on simul
taneously from the third and seventh
levels, while cutting stations is in
progress on the other levels. The
rresent Southwest shaft extends
from the Czar 200-level to the South-
from the 1000 to the 1200 level, and
connection made with the Lowell on
both this level and 'the 1100. Work
from the Lowell in this direction on
the 1300 level has been under way
for some time, and with the new 1400
drift, will determine the extent ot
the large sulphide. ore body now be
ing stoped through vertical distance
of several hundred feet. The other
1400 drift is at present in primary
sulphide ore, which probably con
nects with known ore bodies on the
level above.
from the Copper Queen mines. By
the time the winze has been com
pleted to the 1800 level, the Dallas
shaft will have been sunk to that
depth. By drifting from both shaft
and w'nze, the time required for
connection can be cut in half. Beside
acting as haulage way, the new drifts
will furnish a base of operations for
prospecting and development of ore
bodies below the 1C00 level, about
which little is known at present.
AMBASSADOR DIES
WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 Count V.
Macchi di Cellere, Italian ambassador
to the United States since 1913, died

just as he was about to undergo an op

lower than the lowest Copper Queen
west sixth level, and is equipped withj workings. Directly over the collar of
an underground electric hoist on the
fifth level. Hoisting is done through
a! five-foot compartment, equipped
with a single-deck cage. For several
years there hare ben no mining op
elatioiis below the third level, while
operations on the upper levels have
extended several thousand feet from
the present shaft. The new shaft
will eliminate the long hauls and pro
vide additional hoisting facilities.
When completed the shaft will con

Gardner Division. The headin of
10-113D on the Gardner 1,000 level
luis advanced to a point about 2,000
feet from the shaft. This drift is be
ing driven toward the Czar and Hol
brook mines, and will be of great
value in determining the vertical ex
tent of the ore in these divisions. The
ground being explored lies at 400
feet below the lowest Holbrook
workings, and 600 feet below those
of the Czar. The face of the drift is
in tho lower limestone, below the
usual ore horizons of the district, so
its progress is being watched with
interest.
Lowell Division. Interesting work
on the Lowell 1300 level is under
way in reopening part of a large ore
body abandoned several years ago on
account o fire. The , sulphideore
was ignited by heat generated by
friction of moving ground, and it be
came necessary to sea loff a large
area by airtight concrete bulkheads.
Since that time water has been kept
constantly running through the fire
the winze a raise is being driven to
the 1500 level, so the total depth at
the winze will be 300 feet. The
winze will consist of two shaft com
partments, one for hoisting and a
second for pipes, manway, etc., and
will be equipped with hoisting ma
chinery on the 1500 to handle waste
from prospect work, and supplies.
This work is being carried out as
part of the plans for the new haulage
system, having the Dallas shaft as
an outlet, which will be in operation
by the time steam shovel operations
make it necessary to abandon the
Sacramento shaft, whicli at present

RAILROADING ON. QUICKSAND
COLLIER'S National Weekly cannot be successfully termed a re
actionary, but admits that our national railway system is in
danger. It does not propose to help the stampede into Social
ism, the trick of ihe demagogue when the logic of facts is against
his contention. 'It snys the condition of the railroads has nor. pleased
anyone for a long time, neither investors, workers," nor the general
public. "Supervision was an incomplete success; control is an ad
mitteil failure. The roads are on a foundation of shifting sand."
Their disposal is "the master problem of this country, affecting
industry, commerce, and, primarily, the cost of living "
THe Plumb plan "promisises reduced expenditure, higher wages,
and better service a veritable golden age of railroading."
It 'is not a plan that will meet with' approval of the American
people, who prefer the play of open economic forces to any cinch
program. 1 - . , .
The Plumb plan would not encourage private investment in any
public utility, "but would overthro w the whole system of private en
terprise, i ,: .i
Any avaricious, selfish group could attack any large group of in
dustries and overthrow them on the specious plea of sharing owner
ship.
How can the Plumb plan propose to share in profits where there
are none, and none would be permitted by the grasping control of
unions?
Capital has never made the demands for increased profits that
the Brotherhoods have demanded at the hands of the government,
and got them.
Better systems, greater efficiency, elimination of waste motion,
eays Collier's, can do more for the railways than abolishing capital.
GERMANY AND THE FUTURE
SOME timorous souls are expressing fear that Germany is in &
fair way towards building up a new and mighty army, with the
intention of making another bid for world domination. These
alarmists Have probably been reading the cleverly worded articles
from fhe pens of the great German leaders, whose stories of the war
seem to lead to the conclusion that Germany was not defeated on
the field of arms, in spite of the rather general belief to that effect.
While it will not do to let events within the former Hohenzolern
stronghold pass unnoticed altogether, it is hardly likely that any
effort Mill be made in the immediate future to write "Deutschland
Uber Ailes" on the skies of the world. Germany waited 44 years
after her victory ovar France in the Franco-Prussian war before try
ing her great military machine cn the world.
On the other hand, it is not improbabe that Prussia may try to
build up a stiong reserve army, founded on the spirit and methods of
her more or ler.s gloricus past, with the thinly veiled hope that a
Hohenzollern might be restoied to power and things return to an
ante bellum status at Potsdam and Berlin. That accounts 'for the
concern which the socialists and other democrats have expressed
ever the activity of Noske and other apparent rentcionaries.
AGITATORS
I
ost every town is cursed with the bolsheviki element, who ap
pear to be against everything in the way of progress.
They express their views in various ways. Some use the soap
box method cn the corner, where they harangue the crowd on the
wrongs that are being inflicted by the party in power on the innocent
and unsuspecting public Every time we hear one of them it always
reminds us of the" toy balloons on celebration day when they are
blown up with hot air and you release the check valve, the air is ex
pelled in a loud and discordant noise. We have often wondered if,
like the balloon, a pin or sharp instrument were applied to the rear
anatomy of the agitator, it he would not collapse Mith a loud report,
and be no more.
And there is the sly, smooth guy, with the "lend me your ear"
altitude, who calls you aside and confides in you confidentially, witn
the express purpose of making a sort of "endless chain" of you, to
spread the propaganda ot their evil bolshevik tendencies.
Of the two evils, if we must have them, we would prefer the
former, for he is not afraid to let all know just how he stands. Wa

GETTING WISE
"Where are the roses you wore yesterday
"On your cheeks so enticingly red
"Where is the blush that I've learned so to love?"
"At the drug store," the young Venus said.
"Where is the paleness of neck and of brow,
"That seemed so engrossingly fair?"
"In my vanity box," said the sweet thing to me.
With an innocent, babylike stare.
"Where are the glories that crowned you last night,
"With masses of golden brown hair?"
"Why, they're on my dresser," she archly replied,
"I always keep them hidden there!"
And then I forebore quite to question her more,
Lest I learn far too much for my good
Lest I find that her form had been builded to fit.
And her limbs had been fashioned of wood.
PEPY'S DIARY IN BISBEE
Oct. 20. Up early, and to town after a fairly good breakfast, where I
found every one in a blue mood, which I laid to its being Monday! To Mr
Lyman, in the general offices, who had written some news for me, which
I should have got sooner, but did not. Talked with him about the news
which was not. much, and made him promise to write more. To the relief
association, where I heard some sad tales about influenza victims, but much
heartened by the good that is being done for them. Saw also the trupnt
efficer. Miss Ford, very busy about a little lad who appeared to me to be
likely in the habit of playing hookey, so I sympathized with him. and pleased
with the sweatness with which he was taken for a lecture. No news from
the supervisors, although hoping that unother highway commission might
have been appointed over Sunday. Which reminds me that I went to church
Sunday., where I. did hear a man sing finely, whereat all the congregation
seemed, delighted, but I doubt not that he raised some jealousy inh choir.
Also a good sermon, according to my wife, who always sits straight and
gathers every word, which she details to me afterward, usually making the
Sunday evening very irksome. To the gas company, where they gave me
a fixture for my gs stove, and did not charge me for it, which surprised me
so that I hurried home to tell my wife about it. and she looked through my
pocket book and saw that it was true. To the office, where I worked with
an ill heart, but better after while.. And so to bed, still wondering about the
gas company.

The monthly meeting of the Warren
District Business Men's association
was held last evening in the rooms of
the Commercial club. J. C. White,
president of the organization, was in
the chair,' and opened the meeting
with a short resume of the activities
of the state convention of the state
organization at Tucson. His remarks
were made in the absence of Ken
Frankenburg, who was unavoidably
detained, and who had prepared a com
plete summary of the work accom
plished by the convention.
Attention was also brought to leg
islative actions which are either al
ready laws or in progress of enact
ment. One of these is a banking law
whereby the men who offers checks
from which he has no funds to pro
tect may, if he doe's not make the
check good within five days, be pros
ecuted under a felony charge. An
other, against which the marchants of
the Warren district. were asked to pro
test, proposes to force every merchant
to put the cost price of goods offered
for sale alongside the selling prices.
The reason for the protest lies in the
fact that such procedure Is upt to give
purchasers the Impression that tlm
merchant is selling at higher figures
than are warranted, while, iu reality,
he is simply taking care of his over
j head expenses and other charges
which must be figured in setting
i prices. A third bill to which the local

given by J. R. Henderson of the Hen

'centered upon the principles that the

organization except the Intei-nationM

ENTIRE STATE
ILL SET FOR
BIG CAMPAIGN
The Roosevelt Memorial campaign
opened today" with the state thorough
ly organized and with every indica
tion that a handsome sum will be
realized from a large number of loyal
citizens of the state, and with every
hope of the organization fulfilled
during the seven days of the cam
paign, which ends Monday, October
27, designated as Roosevelt day
throughout the state and nation.
To link the Spanish-American war,
the career of Roosevelt and the
great war just closed, the American
Legion, comprising veterans of the
great war, has expressed itself in
hearty sympathy with the Roosevelt
Mracyai work and is lending aid
both morally and financially. An

American Legion. Arizona branch, in
a communication dated at Tucson,
arid addressed to Col. James H. Mc
Clintock, state director of the Roose
velt Memorial association, and a
Spanish-American war veteran o"
distinction, gives his endorsement to
the movement, expressing himself as
"pleased to be associated with you
in the work of such a patriotic na
ture as tliat of the IKJO'sevelt Me
morial association."
The stimulation to the campaign
given by the aid cf the American
Legion is fully appreciated by the
Roosevelt Memorial committees
throughout the state, as the men or
the American Legion are of the red
blooded type who appreciate the
sterling Americanism which charac
terized the life of Theodore Roose
velt. The campaign work has been so
organized as to reach every precinct
in the state, thus giving everybody
an opportunity to become a member
of ths-.Rdosevelf Memorial associa
tion through a subscription, large or
small. There will be some special
attractions during the week, such as
patriotic Roosevelt adtfresses, ar
ranged by the county chairmen, ap
propriate slide displays in the mov
ing picture theaters, exercises In the
public schools Friday, and other fea
tures to be determined by the. county
chairmen and their workers.

members of the local Boy Scout or

HOW I BECAME A PRIMA DONNA
By ROSA PONSELLE
Leading Soprano, Metropolitan Opera House
New York City
CHAPTER XIV Business Before
Pleasure.
We hear often the proverb about
all work and no play making
Jack a dull boy. It applies equally
well to girls. One must relax.
Otherwise there comes a reaction
both mental and physical. The
business man, I am told, has found
thU to be true; and he takes his
vacations, nowadays, more readily
than in former years. It la the same
with the artist. There must be di
version; diversion of the right sort.
But the working time, if steady
progress is to ensue, must be strict
ly observed. There is a time to work
find a time to play; neither should
bo mixed. I found this out, very
eraiy in my New York studies, and
1 never forgot.
In the beginning I Was Interested,
B3 in a new toy, and nothing else
entered my mind. My days were
completely filled, so much so that
when night came I was tired enough
to go early to bed. But as time went
on- I became more accustomed to
the plodding to the hour after
hour of poring over my operatic
roles, and languages, and practising
With my voice. I was In the groove,
one might say, and well in It.
I had steadily refused invitations
from friends to go with them here
and there. A dinner, or a theatre
party or to a dance.
Then, as weeks of unremitting
study slipped by, I grew restless.
Why not? I argued.. I need a
change. So I said "yes," to a friend,
and found a pleasant change. And
that started me. In a week I was
rushing constantly; hurrying my Im
portant work to be ready In time to
start some place where there should
be diversion. Before I knew It I was
becoming tired in body and occa
sionally a bit peevish. The voice
began to set heavy when It shouldn't
have been.
Morning after morning I got up
In a half listless state and went to
the piano to begin tar exercises.
They never satisfied me. Neither
did I find my mind as active In the
things demanding such activity.
A few weeks of this, and one
afternoon, at the studio, my teacher
topped me in my singing.
"Ynu nre tired, Bosa; what' Is the
matter?"
"Nothing," I answered. Nothing
ever is the matter when you know
something Is.
"Ai'e you sure?" He was alwayt
persistent, but in a kindly way.
"I'm- tired, I guess."
He nodded his head. "Of course.
What have you been doing ?" '
"What do you mean?" I coun-.
tered, desiring to defer the moment
of confession I knew was coming. '
"Just what T say; you aren't get-,
ting rest enough. Yoj are . . .
having too good a time. Isn't that
it?"
"Well," I pleaded, "ono cannot
work continually."
"Certainly not," he agreed. Then
suddenly he put a question: "Where
were you last night?"
"Why ... I went to the the
atre."
"And what time dlj you get into
bed?" . -
"Twelve o'clock; that's early
enough."
He laughed. "Yes, if you hadn't
been getting thereat that hour too
often. Tell me; haven't, you been
cheating yourself of the rest you
need? Honestly, now."
"I suppose so," I answered ixear
ily.
"Well, then, why not relax a little
less often. Half as often, say. You
need to play, we all do. But try to
make it fit Into the wori you have
to do. You will feel better in your
mind and in your body, too. . Stay
in for a few nights, and afternoons
and in a week see what a change It
will make."
It was more of that constantly
wise counsel my teacher was for
ever giving. He was right. I dis
covered for myself In a short time
how careful one must be not to
overdo. And I did feel better, know
ing I was taking my recreation In
the homeopathic doses I realized I
should take it.
Others will find this to be true
those who are students, and who ex
perienced the desire to have too
much of a good time, harmless
enough in some ways, as I did. It
Is a lesson all have to learn who are
engaged seriously In some Impor

And all must learn it to succeed;
they must learn that, after all, busi

PLEA MADE By
FRENCH III
NEW YORK, Oct. 20. A plea for
motherhood out of wedlock was made
today at the international conference
of women physicians by Dr. Anna
Moutet of France.
"In a country the population of
which is decreasing," she said, "it Is
important above all to favor the rate
of birth by every means, to do away
with all -obstacles in the protection of
all children indiscriminately.
"Motherhood outside of marriage
must no longer beheld as a disgrace
or a burden. The girl mother must
be lifted. The prejudice which makes
her an object of general censure
must be combatted; and if irregular
birth is no longer a disgrace to the
child, neither must it be a dishonor
to, the mother. She must find in so
ciety for herself and for her child
the support which in the past was
refused her."
Describing what France has .done
in the matter Dr. Moutet said:
"The law has assured the protec
tion of the child born out of wedlock,
first in creating a. bond of right be
tween him and his parents when- that
fs possible: then in assisting the
mother when She is alone and with
out resources, and finally in taking
full responsibility in rearing the
child.

"I never have had such a "God
send ccme to ine as when I took the
first dose of May's Wonderful Rem
edy. I was afraid I would have to
give up my school because of severe
stomach, liver and bowel trouble
which caused such a pressure of gas
that I could not use my brain at
times, and my heart would palpitate
awfully. Since taking a treatment of
Mayr's Wonderful Remedy a year
ago, all this has disappeared." It Is
a simple, harmless preparation that
removes the catarrhal mucus from
the intestinal tract and allays the in
flammation which causes practically
all stomach, liver and Intestinal ail

dose will convince or money refund

flavor and coolness. The more Camels you smoke the

NEW YORK, Oct. 20. On the larg
est if not the most diversified opera

ket today mounted almost steadily to
higher levels, miscellaneous shares
once more featuring the movement.
Events over the week-end and those
which, came to hand in the course of
the session were almost altogether
helpful to the bull or conservative ac
count, especially industrial and mone
tary "developments.
The labor Bituation assumed a more
defnite pihase as the result of news re
garding the Industrial conference at
Washington and reports of increased
production from leading centers ot tbe
steel and Iron industry.
Call loans opened at 8 per cent,
holding at that level until the final
hour when accommodations dropped
by easy stages to 4 per cent, the lower
quotation in several weeks. Time
funds ware auotably unchanged at 7
per cent, but very little was offered at

THE CORN MARKET
CHICAGO, Oct. 20. Corn prices de

based largely on the fact that there
bad been a bulge of more than 6 cents
within a week. Closing quotations
were heavy, Vc. to l'&c net lower with
December $1.25 to $t.25U and May
$1.23U to $1.23J4. Oats lost to
4c Tn provisions the finish varied
from $1.05 of fto an advance of $2.75.
It was an overbought market in corn
and when bears noted a lack of sup
port they immediately pressed their
advantage. Lightness of offerings was
responsible for a moderate upturn
which took place at the opening.
Weakness of the hog values though
tended to discourage buyers of corn.
In addition, many traders expressed
doubt that farmers were in general
adopting a holding policy. Then at
tention began to focus on opinions that
a setback was due after the recent
Fharn rally. Once on the downgrade,
the market acoulred momentum and
finished at about bottom figures of
th day.
Outs were steadier thpn corn owing
to advices that despite th loneshore
men's strike some export demand con
tinued. October dHverv of pork wn bid nn

READY ROOFINGS
This picture shows the "dry end" of a huge felt-mak-
ing machine in one of our mills.
Felt is the "base" or body of ready roofing. Quality in
roofing depends so much on the quality of this felt foun
dation that we manufacture in our own mills all of the
felt used in making Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid Roofings.
In this way only, can we be assured of securing the
extra-tough, long-fibre wool-and-cotton felt necessary
for building long-lasting qualities into Ru-ber-oid and
Malthoid.
Ru-ber-oid-and Malthoid Roofings are made by saturat
ing this extra-quality felt with a highly waterproof
asphaltic compound, after which the sa-urated felt is
coated with - a long-lived, weather-resisting compound.
Both the saturating and coating compounds are refined
in our awn plant for this special purpose.
From rags to wrapper, Ru-ber-oid and Malthoid Roof
ings are made within our own organization made to
give laL ting service. We have been making ready roof
ings for 35 years. During this time Ru-ber-oid andMal
Ihoid have proved their quality under all sorts of trying
conditions. They are sun, rain and fire re
sistant, l he price is higher, but the cost is
less, because they last longer and need
fewer repairs. When you buy roofing, buy
real protection.
