WASHOINGTON. Oct. 12. The Lib
erty Loan has moved only 118.730,550
nearer the $5,000,000,000 goal, or ap
proximately one-third of one per cent.
The total for the entire campaign
thus far, as 'officially announced to
night, stands at lets than seven per
cen; on the basis of returns received
today and including subscriptions re
ported to all reserve banks, except
Minneapolis, up to the close of busi
ness yesterday. At the rate of sub
scriptions reported today, it would
take from eight to nine months fj ob
tain the. $5,000,000,000 desired.
"At the end of 11 days sale of second
Liberty Loan bonds," the treasury de
partment's announcement reads, "to
tal subscriptions of $344,195,590 had
been reported to eleven of the twelve
reserve banks in the United States.
This is less than seven per cent of the
maximum amount of subscriptions ex
pected by Secretary McAdoo before
the close of the drive for $5,000,000,000
on Oc.'ober 27.
Official Returns.

"As a result of the low totals shown
by the official statements appeals are

Unofficial Reports.
"While the unofficial figures receiv

that subscriptions are much larger
than tl.'ose shown by the official re
turns, progress made thus far is caus
ing no optimism.
"The particular need of the cam

number of small subscribers to the
bonds."
Far From Complete.
Analysis of the official 'figures an
nounced tonight indicates that no re
port was received in time for inclusion
in the tabulation fi'om New York and
Atlanta, the total announced from
theze districts standing just where it
was last night. The report is there
fore far from complete. There is no
showing for Minneapolis and Kansas
City shows a change of only $600 for
the day for the entire district a sit
uation which officials admit is almost
inconceivable.
Chicago is credited with an increase
of only $855,000 for the day and Cleve
land is given only $76,000 more than
reported to the reserve banks.
Biggest Advance.
New England, with i increase for
the day of $6,800,000 showed the big
gest advance its total of $48,600,000 be
ing approximately the figure reported
from Boston. San Francisco, accord
ing ii official reports, added $6,044,200
to its previous subscriptions and Dal
las $3,090,000.
As the situation stands tonight there
remain 13 working days in which to
raise $4,654,814,450. To accomplish
this huge task it will be necessary to
strike a daily average of $358,000,000
or approximately $15,000,000 every
hour of the twenty-four.

DRAFT CALLED
War Department is Discuss
ing Advisability of Calling
Another Increment Na
tional Army Short Many
Men.
(By Review Leased Wire.)
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12. Discus
sion of the advisability of expediting
the call for the second increment of
the draft army now is in progress at
the war department and it appears
likely that the date may be fixed for
some time in December or January.
Mobilization of the first, increment
of 687,000 men is now far enough ad
vanced to show clearly that there
will be a big deficiency for the seven
teen national army divisions. More
than 250.000 of the first Increment
are still to be assembled, but It al
ready is evident that there will be
available at the 16 cantonments quart
ers for an additional regiment at each
post and at some for a full brigade
of two regiments.
New Recruits.
The strength of the new regimental
organization is 3,600 men. With a
regiment lacking at each cantonment,
this alone would mean a shortagle of
nearly 50,000 men. In addition there
has been authorized a separate divi
sion of negro troops which means
nearly 30,000 men withdrawn from
the original number assigned to the
16 cantonments.
Drafted Men Absorbed.
The shortage is due partly to the
necessity of taking out of national
army men to fill up national guard
divisions. Two complete national
army divisions of southern troops
have been absorbed in this way. The
remnants of three other southern na
tional army divisions will be consoli
dated to form a single divisional unit,
and the surplus men from other camps
will be sent south to make up the
missing divisions.
Other Needs.
Drafts on the national army force

Owners of Mexican Mines Seek to
Have Carranza Decree Annulled
EL PASO, Texas, Oct 12. American mining companies having gold
and silver mines in Mexico have committees at work in New York and
Washington in an effort to have the new mining decree modified or
abrogated, it was admitted here tonight by prominent mining men.
The decree requires that all gold produced by the mines in Mexico
must be returned to Mexico after it is shipped out for refinement and that
25 per cent of the value of all silver bullion shipped out of the country
must be returned in gold.
Mines producing large values in gold have found this decree almost
prohibitive and an effort is now being made to have it modified. Silver
mine owners say they will have no difficulty in operating under the de
cree. Denial that the smelters of the American Smelting & Refining corn
pan in Mexico would close because of the decree was made at that com
pany's general offices here tonight.

WASHINGTON. Oct. 12. The gen
eral shortage of labor industries that
must be kept going at top speed if
the United States Is to throw its whole
strength into the war is giving con
siderable concern to government offi
cials studying the situation.' Condi
tions in some parts of the country
already threaten production of essen

Large government orders reaching
into every branch of industry have
stimulated business to an extent nev
er before known. Coal mines are
overtaxed and railroads cannot move
the country's freight. Shipyards are
preparing to turn out as much tonnage
next year as was built in the last
decade. t-
Munitions factories are' searching
the country for men.
The first army draft took large
numbers of men out of essential in
dustries, and the next, unless the
present exemption policy is changed,
will draw as many more. Officials are
given serious though to a suggestion
heard in many quarters that in form
ing the next draft army exemptions
be applied to industries instead of
individuals. Under the law as it now

P. A. STOVALL
American Ambassador to

iBv Review Leased Wlrel
AN ATLANTIC PORT, Oct. 12.
After four years spent in the center
of Europe's colossal struggle, Pleas
ant A. Stovall. United States .minister
to Switzerland, declared on his ar
rival here today that the economic
situation in German is acute and that
be believed the backbone of the Ger
man resistance had broken down.
Since the publication of President's
Wilson's reply to Pope Benedict's
peace proposals, in which the presi
dent stated that the United States Is
warring upon the German government
and not upon the German people, the
revulsion against war, Mr. Stovall
said, has been spreading rapidly
through Germany.
Reason Sinking Deep.
"The effect of this statement was
tor a long time not noticeable," he as
serted, "but slowly and surely it is
sinking deeper and deeper into the
German heart. If left to themselves
the German people will make peace
tomorrow.
"There is no doubt about the eco
nomic straits in which Germany now
finds itself. The situation is acute."
Switzerland Neutral.
In spite of German,' French and Ita
lian influences. Minister Stovall said,
Swiss neutrality has been reserved
and a force of 250,OOp men watches
the border constantly to prevent the
passage of contraband. He added that
Switzerland's exercise-of board sym
pathies for the wonnded brough in
from three fronts was a notable chap
ter of history. In Swiss hospitals
there are, be said, about 25,000 pris
oners, mostly .French, ut English
and German also. The Swiss people
give entertainments constantly for
them and extend aid wherever it is
needed.
Mr. Stovall will go to Washington
to consult with government officials
and later to his home in Savannah.
Von Capelle Has
Resigned Post as
Naval Minister
(By Review Leased Wire.)
AMSTERDAM, Oct. 12. Vice Ad
miral von Capelle, the German minis
ter of marine, has resigned, accord
ing to the Frankfurter Zeitung.
Vice Admiral Eduard von Capelle
was one of the administrative direc
tors in the ministery of marine before
the war and had served as a captain
at sea. In March, 1916, he succeeded
Admiral von Tirpltz as imperial min
ister of the navy. Several times since
then von Caelle has appeared before
the relcbstag with optimistic state
ments regarding the progress of the
unrestricted submarine campaign, as
late as August 26, 1917, defending
the U-boat policy of his predecessor
and himself at a meeting of the reich
stag main committee.
Vice Admiral von Capelle announc
ed in the reichstag last week that a
plot had been discovered in the navy
to paralyze the efficiency of the fleet
and force the government to make
peace. He said that the guilty parties
had received their just deserts and at
tempted to link socialists with the
plot The imperial German chancel
lor. Dr. Michaelia, also spoke of the
exlstense of a conspiracy in the navy
and asserted that certain deputies
were involved in the revolt.

ments. RESIGNATIONS DEMANDED.

(By Review Leased Wire.)
NEW YORK, Oct. 12. New York City received its first supply of
water from the Catskill Mountains today when Mayor Mitchell accepted
a fountain in the northern reservoir of Central park and turned on the
flow that will give New Yorkers three hundred million more gallons
dally. The fountain has five jets and the pressure from the Catskill
aqueduct throws a stream 115 feet in the air.
The turning op of the water waa witnessed by a large throng as
sembled In Central park, including hundreds of school children. The
water comes from the Ashoken reservoir. 120 miles away. The comple

monstrous," he said, "but it is an illu

CHAMPIONSHIP

T!

fBy Review Leased Wire).
CHICAGO, Oct. 12. The world
series warfare between the New York
Giants and the Chicago White Sox
enters into the closing stages of the
baseball campaign here tomorrow
when the two teams meet in the fifth
contest of the series at Comiskey
park. Each club has two victories
notf bed in their bat handles, and the
club that wins two of the remaining
games to be played bears off the hon
ors of the series.
The Giants came to town today
chipper and confident. They had
bowlfd ever the American league
champions twice on the Polo grounds
and their pitchers had not allowed a
run. The Giants were confident that
they had the edge on their opponents,
and would decide the baseball su
premacy of 1917 by trimming the
White Sox on their own grounds and
then putting over the fourth victory
In New York next Monday.
The Giants have faced the best of
the Sox hurlers and say they do not
fear them.
Cicotte Beaten
"We have beaten Cicotte," said
Charley Herzog, the Giant second
baseman and captain tonitrht. "and we
can beat him and that shine ball aJy
tiUie he goes against us."
The New Y'ork nioundFmen are in
fine s-hape and have had, plenty of
rest. Sallee is regarded as McGraw's
choice for box work tomorrow, but if
the weather continues cold it was
hovering around freezing tonight it
is probable that Poll I'erritt may be
chosen. McGraw has found, though,
that the Sox do not 'ake kindly to
lcft-handTs, and some of the Giants
believe his prest-nt plan is to "Fo:ith
paw" the Sox out of the series.
White Sox Undiscovered
The White Sox came back home on
a special train tonight not a v.-hit
disfouraged by the upset in New
Yoi'k.-- They gave full credit to "Rube"
Brnion for his work in Wednesday's
pa'iir, but could not unders'rnd why
they did not make any progress
against Schupp's fast curves. The Sox
admitted that Benton always would
be a fcard proposition any time lie
starts, but believe either Sallee or
Schupp will find themselves running
to cover if they go agianst them
again.
Pitchers Anxious
Eddie Cicotte said tonight that he
was ready to work tomorrow if called
upon, and Reb Russell is fairly beg
ging Manager Rowland for a chance
to face the Giants. Rus3ell told every
body on the train that all through the
National league season the New Yorks
had their troubles whenever a good
left-hander showed any speed and
curves.
The Sox agreed that the Giants
looked like a smart and fast ball club
on Thursday, and that it was a team
that would take a lot of beating once
it was in a winning mood.
Manager Rowland said tonight that
he had not made up his mind as to
the pitcher for tomorrow's game.
Jackson Comments
Joe Jackson insisted that the Sox
batting slump was only of two .days'
duration, and that the Sox back fences
would come in for a bombardment
once the club was under way.
Snow in Chicago
It snowed here today and then
rained, and there is a constant threat
of a storm tonight, though the weath
er mnn gave a cheering forecast of
fair and cold. There was a winter nip
to the air.
The members of the national com
mission sent word ahead that the
game would be played unless it rained
or snowed or an unusual cold wave
prevented
Scats at Premium
Seats for Saturday's game sold to

for a grandstand seat. Late tonight
a shivering line of fans gathered at
the gates of the unreserved stands.
Fires were lit and wrapped them
selves in great-coats and blankets to

The soical at the Christian church
last evening proved most enjoyable. It
started off informally, Mr. Deatherage
noticing, half through his opening re

tie. However, the proceedings weren't
halted; another tie was procured,
hooked In place, and everything pro
ceded merrily. And the evening
wound up informally with coffee and
cake.
The Program
Mrs. Maye English opened the pro
gram with a splendid reading splen
didly delivered. She was followed by
Syvilla Ferron, who also rendered a
reading. Then came music by the
military choir of Company L, 35th In
fantry, a group of men who sang well
and naturally. L. T. Frazier gave an
address, and E. M. Bonnell and the
Copper City quartet appeared in a va
riety of music. The quartet, like the
White Sox, started off in good form,
but weakened eventually. They were
"great" on stuff that they knew, but
when they tried some old-timers" they
did more laughing among themselves
than tfcey &i singing. The crowd,
however, entered into the spirit pf the

Murphy and a patriotic speech

Burning" and Miles Merrill, president
of the Loyalty League of America,
rendered a stirring talk along in
tensely national lines.

forth his views on the world war in
a convincing and pleasing way. Fol

less anything more substantial.
But now that the 158th is about
to leave for California, a few good

fact that no banquets nor presents

i THE STORM BREAKS.
'. Storm clouds have been hovering about the German
1 empire for these many weeks. Most of them have been
in the nature of the Allies excepting revolutionary
Russia wonderful and eTficient military activities. The
Hun has managed to protect himself and his kind from
the onslaught of the' outsider. The black emperor and
his misguided people might go on indefinitely in their
defensive warfare. There is one thing even the greatest
autocrat of the age and century cannot stand and that
Is the internal disintegration, which now threatens his
position.
In referring to the mutiny on the four German battle
ships, the news of which reached the outside world after
several days of deleting on the part of the Teutonic
censor, it can be again remarked that the occurence has
little bearing In itself. Just as certain, however, as the
sun rises, the causes, which provoked the rebellious con
duct, must come to light. The answer was not long in
coming. The press dispatches carry the consoling in
formation that the Socialists, of all degrees and belief,
have banded together and will Tight.
Georg Michaelis, chancellor of the German Empire,
pan-German and Junker extraordinary, the man chosen
by Welbelm as bis right arm for the carrying into effect
of the terrible war policy of the Hun, has a net of bees
about his ears. He is the object of the wrath of the
Socialists of Germany. It might be remarked that this
political party, in the Teutonic nation. Is strong, at least
in numbers and in thought.
His dismissal is demanded in unqualified terms.
Michaelis must go, is the tenor the declaration of many
Germans. Voewarts, a leading Berlin newspaper, re
marks, in part: "Dr. Michaelis and Admiral von Capelle
have offered a feast to foreign countries of the prospec
tive triumph of Bolshevikis in Germany. With clumsy
fists they have pushed the Independent Socialists into
the limelight. Michaelis must go. A falsely understood
sense of duty has induced this man to assume a post
for which he is In nowise fitted."
Germany, so free from Internal dissention, during the
first three years of its war, promises to break into flames.
Fire, of a spontaneous kind, when it reaches the surface
! Is all-consuming. Voewarts' reference to the Bolshe-
' vikis is apropos and significant.
Michaelis must go! But what of the man who is re-
; sponsible for Michaelis? What of the power that holds
'' Michaelis and his Junker kind in office and at the head
; of the war machine which has devastated Europe and
: wrapped the world in grief? Can one go and not the
' other? Will not tliA sump nnu-pr hnlrl In nprmnnv vilh
uncnaens on nis larm mat obtained wnen ne actea es
me uihck emperor s puppei :
; The Socialists of Germany are right. Michaelis must
. j go. But they must be blinding themselves to the only
conclusion that can be reached autocracy and auto-
cracy's last abiding government must go. In other words
Germany, as it is at present constituted, must go the
. way oi tne otner Dan cm political unions.
Mutiny, in the ranks or on board ship of any nation at
- war, is merely a reflection of the feelings of the men who
participate, and behind that the feelings of many men
and women, far behind the battle lines of land or sea.
, Germany is a seething mass of people, forced at the end
' of a whip to do the Junkers' will.
James W. Gerard phrased the complaint against Ger
' many In admirable manner when he wrote:
"It Is because in the dark, cold, northern plains 'of
"1 people, poisoning their minds from one generation to an-
: other, and preaching the virtue and necessity of war; and
until tint autocrocy s either wiped cut or n power
less there can be no peace on earth. And there
"ni'K.t be no German peace. The old regime, left in con--tr?l
:' .Germany, of Bulgaria, of Turkey, would only seek
a favorable moment to renew the war, to strive again
for the mastery of the world. Fortunately America bars
the way America, led by a fighting president who will
allow no compromise with brutal autocracy."
Germany is still a powerful nation. Its arms may
continue to be efficient in stemming the pnrushing tide
of Democracy for the moment. The feelings of the peo
ple of the Central Empire, however, will count. Their
at itude can not always be passed over and ignored by
the nodcrn Attila.
From within comes the rumble of the threatened
break-up for the storm Is certainly at hand.
Rippling Rhymes
(By WALT MASON.)
,THE BOILING POT.
Cochise county can be commended and censured for
many things. The richest subdivision of the state of
Arizona is lax and is efficient. The man who cannot see
some of his own failings and guard against them is most
unfortunate and continually finds trouble in his house.
That is Cochise. Poor old Pima rich, also, but unfor
tunate. When nothing else is at hand Cochise's neigh
bor, on the northwest, must fight internally.
It would be difficult to think back but a few months
and find Pima county free from political fights of some
kind. For some months past, the county has been in
dulging in a free-for-all which is neither sightly nor does
it Induce the casual observer to think well of the county.
It is difficult and not the province of the outsider
to criticize another county, without every fact being
known. Such facts are hard to secure, nearly impossible,
in fact. On the whole, however, the effect on the entire
state can be criticized by the outsider with justice and
with some misgivings.
No good can come to Pima county or to Arizona
from constant turmoil in one of its most important cent
ers. To say that it is a black eye, would only be stating
the affair as it seems to many.
Tucson is progressive. It is a city; a big town in the
Southwest, with ivonderful opportunities and assets. All
of its neighbors wish it the best of success, for its prog
ress is reflected to its friends. So also is its troubles
and in thinking of this, it is the hope of Bisbee that the
Old Pueblo forget its imaginary, household troubles and
fight for something bigger and better- a greater Tucson.
HOW THE IMMIGRANT EDUCATES US.
The war is speeding up the education of the immi
grant in the United States. It also stimulates the educa
tion of the native United States in its immigrants, says
the New York World.
When New York rabbis preach loyal sermons, or Chi
cago Swedes condemn truckling to Germany, or Detroit
Poles agitate for reunion, we know the people. But un
til the Russian revolution, how many realized that the
Ukrainians, an oppressed, divided people as numerous
as the Poles, Uniate in religion, main link between
Greek and Roman Churches, had their hosts here to
cheer for the prospect of Ukrainian home rule and re
ligious freedom in Russian democracy?
We knew the Bohemians; their very low proportion
of criminals; their education percentage, higher upon
arrival than that of Frenchmen or Germans; their civic
value. But mass meetings of Czecho-Slovaks remind
New York that it should also know these people, who be
fore the war were coming here faster than their kin, the
Bohemians in Europe an element burning to fight the
Magyars, and here a valuable accession.
The old Montenegrin lion, Nicholas, made the sur
render to Austria that gave the lie to a brave life prob
ably because he valued his dynasty above race-union of
the Jugo-Slavs Bosnian.?, Croats, Dalmations, Slovenes,
Serbs a fine nation kept apart by division under hated
flags. We have as many of them in this country as of
Hungarians and far more than of German Austrians.

STATE AUDITOR
REFUSES WARRANTS
FOR JUDGES SALARIES
Only by action brought against State
Auditor Jesse L. Boyd to collect the
increase in salary from the state wi'l
the case of A. C. Lockwood, superior
judge of Cochise county, versus the
County of Cochise reach the supreme
;ourt. Because the time for appeal
has elapsed, the county will not ap
peal from the decision of Judge Mc
Allister. This is an action resulting
from the passage of the county classi
fication law by the last legislature,
but deals only with the salaries ol
superior court judges.
In his decision. Judge McAllister
ruled that Judge Lockwood was en
titled to the salary increase as se'
forth in the classification act.
In a communication addressed to
State Auditor Boyce, John F. Ross,
prosecuting attorney of Cochise coun
ty, stated that, in his opinion, the
decision in this case was right, and
that he did not think the county woull
be justified in taking an appeal.
Auditor Boyce has refused to pay
the salary increase, half of which is
paid by the state, without au order
from Attorney General Wiley E.
Jones, and he later has refused to
issue such an order. It is the opinion
of the attorney general that the in
crease cannot be paid until the mat
ter has been appealed to the supreme
court.
For these reasons, the increases
will not be paid by the state. As a
result, it is expected that suit will
be instituted against State Auditor
Boyce to collect these increases. Re
gardless of the decisioon in the lower
court, it is stated, an appeal to the
supreme court will be taken.
Why does not the government ahk the British gov
ernment for a safe conduct for Judge Daniel K. Cohalan,
allowing the judge of the surrogate court an opportunity
to go to Germany, wh'.-re he really belongs?
Don't smile at the idea of Argentina entering the war

traded mines owned by him for stock
and thereafter soli a large quantity
of such personal stock. About 4000
persons, it Is said, secured stock of
this sort to the extent of 1,380,000
shares. About a year ago Hull sued
the company for alleged d:bts to him
self, said to amo'int to about $200,
000, represented by notes given to
himself by the corporation, in which
he had a controlling interest. He
secured judgment and the sale by the
sheriff of the property, which he
bought in. The title thus clear, and
reposing wholy in himself, he sold it
to the United Verde company, which
has adjoining land and which thereby
secured an immensely valuable addi
tion to its acreage.
It is told that rich ore has already
been devolped by the United Verd"

Hull holdings.
Th petitioners ask surrender to
the Hull rompany of 7.531,727 shares

ministration of the estate.
It Is also asked that the Uni'ed

blocks of stock.
A receivership is asked as the best ;
method of determining the rights of

TO ATTACKS MADE
ON TOBACCO MEN
AKUKXTINA'S liKEAK WJTII GERMANY WILL AID ALLIES
-A
This is Uie thing that has caused
so many failures, so much misery,
so many deaths "letting the other
.fellow do it." From the fall of great
nations down to the smallest person
al accident it is this policy that has
been responsible for so many of the
troubles of the world. Time after
time "the other fellow" does not do
it. The Liberty loan is a case in
point. It is absolutely useless to re
ly upon the other fellow, because
the amount to be raised is so enor
mous that it will take the combined
self-denial and effort of every ma
'woman and child in this country to
provide the money.
This leads naturally to another
thought. It is not enough that we
merely subscribe. We must see that
our neighbor subscribes, because if
he falls down, we ourselves shall suf
fer, even although we may have done
our share.
There are just a few people left
in this country who say "let the
rich man find the money." When
the government has had its needs
supplied, the rich man will not be
so rich; his taxes will be enormous.
and many a wealthy company strug
iigling with the high cost of every-
thing they use in their business, in
addition to their taxation, will have
a difficulty in securing profits for
their shareholders. The profits of
those making war supplies will be
cut in half, at least, by government
action. Again we must remember
that our wealthy men invested mil
lions and millions of dollars in the
loan last time and will do it again.
The average citizen must realize that
the wealthy man is doing his share,
and that it is to the farmer, the
merchant and the working man that
the country look for a large share
of the subscriptions to the present
loan.
If you say 'let the other fellow
do it," the loan will fail, we shall
be disgraced in the eyes of the
world, the resistance to Cermany of
our allies may break down and the
most terrible thing in the world will
happen to us .conquest by Germany.
This would mean taxation beyond j
JMiman endurance, national disgrace
and having to work for German mas
ters for years to come.
The Germans are not willing "to
let the other fellow do it." Their
boys of 14 and their old men of 60
are serving in the army, their women
anj their children are going short
of food; they are giving up almost
every cent they possess in order to
beat this country. Surely we have
more patriotism than the Germans,
more sense if not, then we deserve
to be beaten.
Call in and see your banker and
ask him whether this article con
tains the. truth. He will tell you
that it does, and will agree that it
is a fatal thing in this great na
tional crisis to "let the other fellow
do it."

Says That Average Man Crit
icizes With out Knowing
Causes Which Necessitated
Big Increase In Retail
Prices.
Championing the cause of the to
bacco retailers, H. S. Hillman has re
plied to the attacks made upon that
body of men in the district for the
increased retail prices now in effect.
Hillman says few laymen realize that
tobacco products have been constant
ly advancing since the first of thw
year, keeping step with groceries and
dry goods. However, grocery and dry
goods merchants increased their sell
ing prices as their buying prices went
up, and although there has been an
advance of over 40 per cent in these
two necessities, the gradually increas
ing selling prices during the past
eight months was an easier thing to.
swallow for the average man than the
sudden jump in retailed tobacco.
Faux Pas of Merchants
Although many of the merchants
throughout the country did advance
their prices, in the majority of caseb
these prices remained the same to the
consumer. Among the best sellers.
!iO per cent of all tobacco, products
are controlled by the tobacco trusts.
They prescribe the prices at which
their goods are to be sold, and they set
the margin of profit for the retailer.
With the first advance and with the
second advance in prices, the dealers
squirmed; but their retailing prices,
arbitrarily, remained the same.
Then the government sJepped in
with its increased revenue tax. and
tobacco products were hard hit. While
the bill was pending in congress there
came another advance in tobacco, and
the dealers became frantic. When tb
revenue bill finally passed, collectors
notified all dealers to take an inven
tory of the stock in hand, as it was
subject to the tax.
Cause for Increase
The main point of misunderstanding
between the dealer and the consumer
is that the latter attributes the :n
creased cost of purchasing the tobac
co to the ax, when, as a mater of
fact, the increased selling price must
cover both the tax and the repetition
of increases in purchasing cos's.
The Facts
These are the facts of the case,
says Hillman. They can be easily
substantiated, he adds, oy comparing
Bisbee prices with los Angeles and
Tfl 'Paso pri'cea which reflect .Vie
prices all over the country. There is
scant, if any difference, despite the
fact that it costs considerably more
to do business in the district than in
the average city. The dealer niuat
make a fair margin of profit to exist,
and a fair margin of profit is all the
dealer asks. For several months he
has bad no margin of profit, and now
that he, in desperation, makes a move
for something which is rightfully his,
the dealer resents attacks made upon
by unknowing people who are not ac
quainted with the circumstances.
Declare Officers
In On the Game
Notwithstanding that they were
driving an automobile which they
claimed belonged to the chief of po
lice of Nogales, ani that they said the
officers of Nogales, civil and military,
had been "fixed," so they could bring
the whisky in, five soldiers, members
of the machine gun company of the
Thirty fifth infantry, stationed at No
fcalts, were arrested by Deputy Sher
iff Percy Uowden early yesterday
morning on G avenue.
According to the sheriff's statement,
he approached the automobile, which
was standing in front of the Arizona
garage on G avenue, and asked the
men H-hat l hey had in the car. It is
said the men promptly replied they
had whisky which they were bringing,
from Rodeo. One of the men, a ser
geant, who seemed to be spokesman
for the outfit, is reported to have
added:
"It's all right, though. This is the
chief of police's car. and we have
everything fixed with the authorities
so we can take the whisky into
Novates and into the camp."
The men were taRen into custody,
as were also the automobile and the
whisky. It is claimed there were 12
cases of whisky in the car, represent
ing a value of about fltvi't. The sol
diers were turned over to the mili
tary authorities at Camp Jones and

THREE CENT LETTERS
COMING NEARER
WITH NOV, 2ND.
Postmaster Bailey Receives
Instructions as Regards to
the Increase In Postage.
Postal Cards Two Cents.
Full details of the 3-cent postage
plan inaugurated as a war revenue
measure are contained in orders re
ceived yesterday by Postmaster T. R.
Bailey of the local office. On and aft
er November 2 a rate 3 cents for
every ounce and fraction thereof will
be charged on letters leaving the city.
All letters addressed to persons in the
city will be delivered at 2 cents. The
postcard will be raised from 1 to 2
cents.
The instructions received indicate
that it will be impossible for the gov
ernment to supply 3-cent envelopes or
the new 2c postcards in sufficient time
to supply all demands for some time
to come, and these probably will not
be sold until tht old supply of 2-cent
stock is exhausted.
Until such supplies are received it
will be necessary to affix 1-cent
s:amps to the 2-cent envelopes or &
1 and a 2-cent stamp to an ordinary
envelope and a 1-cent stamp to a
1- cent poslal card to obtain delivery
after November 1.
There has been a large demand for
2- cent envelopes of late, evidently un
der the misrepresentation that the old
rates would obtain un
til the present I
sunnlv of mock was exhausted. The,
local postoffice emphasizes the p;int j
contained in the orders that the S ce nt
rate will be rigidly enforced for aU j
ou'suie letter man.
The orders indicate that postmas
ters may now take their requisitions
for 3-rent printed special request
F tamped envelopes of all designs aud
in all listed sizes with the exception
of manila. The prices of the new en
velopes will be the same as for 2-cent

"There is one point that I would
like the Review to make clear to the
public." said Mr. Bailey in discussing
the new orders, "and that is that all
letters mailed with insufficient post
age will be held up. If the return
card is given, the letter will be re
turned to the sender for additional
postage. If this is not given, then
the addressee will be no'ilied and
asked to send additional postage re- j

From the best advices now obtain

Funston will be given a 16 weeks'

country. The men composing the
340th Field artillery will probably
be transferred to artillery ranges

while the examinations were being

Men Advise Raise
In Some Prices
(By Review Leased Wire.)
DENVER, Oct. 12. No meat
will
be served in hotels of members of the
Colorado Hotel Men's association on
Tuesdays hereafter, and Wednesdays
will find the menus minus wheat and
wheat products, as the result of a con
ference of the association here today.
The decision is in line with the na
tional conservation policy of the
United States food administration.
The committee also recommended
to restaurant and hotel men that an
extra charge be made for bread- and
butter with all meals in an effort to
wave wheat. The recommendation
that a chrnge be made for milk and
cream with coffee and cereals was
made yesterday, the committee point
ing out that a great saving in milk
and cream would result.
W hile the hotel and restaurant com-!
mittee was in session, the women s
committee and chamber of commerce
members were in session planning the
state-wide canvass in the interest of
lue national ioou cuiisvrtnuua piuu.
Arrangements were made for wives,
mothers and sweethearts of soldiers
to canvass the state, visiting every
home in an educational campaign to
prevent waste and promote economy
in food. '
Two Found Guilty
of Negro Murder
(By Review Leased Wire.)
BELLEVILLE, Ills., Oct. 12. Her
bert Wood and Leo Keane were found
guilty tli is afternoon of the murder of
Scott Clark, a negro who died as the
result of injuries received in the re
cent race riots In East St. Louis and
the penalty was fixel at fourteen years
Imprisonment Wood and Keane were
the first white men to be tried on
charges growing out of the race riot
The known number of persons slain
in the East St. Louis race riots of July
2 Is forty-seven. The grand jury that
returned the indictments however, re
ported that one-hundred persons were
slain by the m'obs. It is believed by
many spectators that many bodies
were burned in the flames.
The hositlity of the whites to the ne
groes was due largely to a feeling that
the presence of a large number of ne
groes In the city handicapped white
workmen in negotiations with capital.
Abandons Search
for His Sister
(By Review Leased Wire).
HAVANA, Oct. 12. Burt Armstrong,
brother of Ruth Armstrong, the Amer
ican school teacher who disappeared
from her lodgings here the night of
July 16, will leave for his home in
Los Angeles tomorrow. For two
months be has been in Havana and
hte West Indies searching for his
sister, but without result.
"There is no question that my sister
has met with foul play." said Mr.
Armstrong tonight. "I believe she was
murdered or forced into a situation
where she had to end her life rather
than sacrifice her honor."
Miss Armstrong came to Havana
from Youngstown, O., last June, and
was engaged as a governess la a Cu
ban family at the time of her disappearance.

Enemy of Allies
(Continued From Page One.)
Even the wounded who returned from
the forward lines were cheerful and
full of grit, though suffering from pain,
dog-tired and caked from head to foot
with pasty mud. It was a revelation
to see the smiles on their faces as they

Determination Seen.
A striking instance of the determina
tion with which the men undertook to
day's work was seen on one section of
the front. The men from over-seas
were advancing ovpr ground that could
be swept by machine gun fire from
various p'oints.
As they struggled along behind their

an important part of the German de

usual in some places, but in others he
bas shown a lack of fighting spirit.
The Germans evidently guessed in
advance that the attack was to be
launched at daybreak. During the!
night they shelled the communicating ;
roads and front lines heavily and as
early as 2 o'clock this morning they;
threw a large lot of gas shells along j
the British forward positions. As the :
attack began the enemy maintained a I
heavy machine gun barrage over large j
sections of the front. I

with greatest difficulty. About the j

OF THE SEA WOLF
erlands government has asked for the i
satisfaction it claims to be due under
international law. Including the res-j
toration of the captured ships. An j
affair between two German prize'
ships and a British submarine like
wise took place recently, again partly
in Dutch waters, according to the of
ficial Dutch version.
On the other hand a German sub
marine has once more run amuck'
among Dutch fishing vessels, of which j
seven -e-sent to the bottom. Twen-i
ty-thrce of such craft, manned with;
240 hands, have now been destroyed
in this manner since the beginning 1
of February last. !
There was, too, serious conflict of :
view between the Netherlands and
German governments over the ques
tion ol the internment of two Ger
man submarines, it being finally de-'
cided to release one and intern the;
other. The German press complains
that Holland permits violation of its!
neutrality of the grossest sort on the!
part of Britain and that the German
Empire cannot put up with such j
weakness. '
The recent multiplication of these
incidents undoubtedly has enhanced,
the delicacy of Holland's position,
demonstrating once a.?ain that she
stands on trie very brink of the preci-
pice.
Critical ' as Holland's political po-
sition Is, it is her economic position
that has lately assumed so grave a
hue she s economiralIy dependent
cn bofh of the belligerent groups
and ,)Cth
screws on. But the latest American
turn of the screw is causing the keen
est anxiety. It is asserted that the
stoppage of the export of bread, grain
and fodder from American ports .
threatens the country with economic,
uisa-iter and even famine, that IIol-
land's own crops will only feed man
and beast for three months and the
stocks cn hand are good at most for
a rev additional months.
The nation at present is far from
resigning itself to participation in the
war nn either side. A vision of the
fate of Belgium. Serbia and Rumania
always rises before the mind's eye ,
of any Hollander who contemplates
war on the side of the entente, for
the Netherlands has no natural fron
tiers on t.'ie east. Participation on
the side of ttie Central powers, he is
convinced, would mean the seizurt
of the Netherlands East Indies by Ja
pan. On-3 of the last thincs in the worl-i
the nation wants is to be thrown int.-
Germany's arms and to share her for
tune.

Suffering Described As Tortnre
Relieved ly Black-Draught.
Rossville, Ca. Mrs. Kate Lee Able, ol
;his p'.aGC, writes: "My husband is an
engineer, and once while lilting, he in-
im-ed himself with a riece of heavy ma-
:hinery. across the abdomen. He was
o sore he could not bear to press on
himself at all, on chest or abdomen. He
weighed 1G5 lbs., and fell off until he
weighed 110 lbs., in two weeks.
He became constipated and it looked
like he would die. We had three dilferent
doctors, yet with all their medicine, his
bowels failed to act . He would turn up
a ten-cent bottle of castor oil, and drink
it two or three days in succession. He
did this yet without result. We became
desperate, he suffered so. He was swol
len terribly. He told me his suffering
could only be described as torture.
Isantand bought Thedford's Black-
Draught. I made him take a big dose, ,
and when it began to act he fainted, he '

DENIES REPORT
A dispatch sent out from Naco
Thursday gave out the information
that the differences between the offi
cials of the Cananea Copper company
and the Mexican authorities had been
settled, and that work was to be re
sumed at the mines and smelters at
once. A copy of the message as sent
out was shown the officers of the
company here yesterday, and they de
nied the truth of the report and stat
ed that they had received no advices
in regard to it whatever. The report
evidently started from the fact that
George Young, general manager of the
company, had been at Hermissillo in ;
conference with the Mexican officials.
AccordingTO reliable information, he.
was there to confer with them on an I
entirely different matter. j

bought the original eight lots Mr. Bro
phy bought the other 10. believing

I ready for them. The site is now 4.0
