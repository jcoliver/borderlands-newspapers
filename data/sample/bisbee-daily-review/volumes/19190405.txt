Steel Rates May Reconsidered
Following Controversy
Chairman Peek Announces
Proposed Meetings in Effort
Reach Agreement Delayed
by Absence of Hines' Agent
WASHINGTON1, April 4. Revised
steel prices arranged by the Industrial
board of the department ol commerce
lrf conference with the producers will
be reconsidered if the board is shown
"good and sufficient reason for doing
80."
Chairman George M. Peek today is
sued the following statement concern
ing the latest development in the con
troversy arising from the refusal of
the railroad administration to accept
the prices on the ground that they
were too high.
"I have never said nor intimated
that the industrial board would stan&
pat on the prices formulated with the
steel industry, no matter what objec
tions were brought by other depart
ments. Shown good and sufficient
reasons tor doing so the board will
reconsider. With wisdom it could pur
sue no other course." - -Conferences
Delayed
Conferences which were to have
started today between the board and
representatives of Director General
Hines were delayed because of ab
sence from Washington of one of the
railroad administration's representa
tives, but it is considered certain that
discussions will begin next week in an
effort to reach an agreement.
The entire policy of the board also
is to undergo investigation, the prin
cipal question being whether prices
shall continue to be announced as a
basis for public purchases or only as
the basis on which the government
will do its buying. A number of of
ficials object to the former course as
bordering on illegal price fixing." -
Acceptance of the uniform priees
was put squarely up to the navy de
partment today when bids were open
ed for 20,000 tons of structural steel.
In compliance with the law, competi
tive bids were -asked, but when they
were opened, all were found to toe
based on the prices announced by the
industrial board. Department officials
declared the 'principle of uniform
prices had neither been accepted or
rejected.
Few Contracts Let
The shipping board reiterated its ac
ceptance of the new steel prices as a
basis for future contracts, but it was
pointed out that yards have bought
steel for many months ahead and that
few new contracts were being let.
Opinion was expressed, however, that
the new and lower prices would stimu
late shipbuilding.
Statements attributed to members
of the Southern Pine assoliation, that
they had declined a proposal of the
industrial board to enter into a price
agreement were answered by Chair
man Peek,.who said representatives of
industry "have never been invited to
enter Into a price agreement, but have
been invited to co-operate with the in
dustrial board in an effort to stabilize
prices by getting, industry voluntarily
to make prices as low as present cost
and labor conditions will Justify."
German Food
Situation Is
Still Serious
PARIS. April 4. By the
Associated Press.) The
food conditions in Germany
were by no means solved by
the signing of the food
agreement. Tonnage is un
available to move the re
quired supplies, and the
available grain stocks are so
short that it probably will
be impossible to furnish the
full amount specified in the
agreement for some time.
Herbert Hoover, director
general of the inter-allied
relief organization estimates
he can furnish Germany
180,000 tons of grain dur
ing the month of April.
However, Germany esti
timates that the German
grain and potato stocks will
be exhausted before June I.

LOS ANGELES, April 4. Japanese

Writing of the reported disturbances
In Pyengyang on March 1, the teacher
said:
"My heart is breaking tonight at
what I have seen today; helpless, un
armed people kicked, beaten, bayon
etted and dragged off to jail without
even resisting. Crowds of school boys

and kicked.
"The Koreans are unarmed. I think
it strange that they offer no resist
ance, but I have heard that the Ko

which accounts for the fact
"I am sure the Japanese govern

brutal the soldiers here are or it nev
er would permit it. The Japanese
have' been very kind to us foreigners
and we appreciate it
i "They searched our school buildings
today, but they know that Americans
are neutral and intend to do the right
thing. They found nothing in our
rooms, of course.
"Lots of arrest have been made,

"On March 31 the bolsheviki four

"Our troops showed great gallantry

PARIS, April 4. The opinion was

LONDON, April 4. (British Wire
less Service.) The Paris correspond
ent of the Daily Telegraph wires that
he is able to state on the highest au
thority that by Sunday a complete
agreement will have' been reached by
the. council of four.
PARIS, April 4. (By the Associated
Press.) Pensions to disabled soldiers
and for widows and orphans will be in
cluded in the bill to Germany for re
parations. The peace conference lead
ers have decided , that such relief to
individuals for losses and suffering
during the war will be a proper charge
under the armistice provisions.
The reparation of losses to the civil
ian population will constitute a very
considerable proportion of the $50,000,-
000,000, the amount of the reparation
bill as now approximately estimated.
In the case of Great Britain, the pen
sion bill will probably constitute the
largest item of the total claim. It is
understood that the United States will
not lodge any claim under this head,
Americans being covered by the Amer
ican soldiers insurance system. .
PARIS, April 4 (By the Associated
Press.) Belgium's case has been laid
before the peace conference by the
most distinguished advocate Belgium
could have chosen. King Albert has
been in Paris for the past three days
and in numerous conferences with the
representatives of the great powers he
has outlined the needs of his country
and to the different steps that must
be taken immediately if Belgium is to
be restored.
King Albert has had long confer
ences with President Wilson, Colonel
House, Premier Clemenceau : ana
David Lloyd George. These conver
sations led up to his appearance be
fore the council of four today. .
A member of the Belgian peace dele
gation told the Associated Press today
that shorn of all its diplomatic nice
ties, what King Albert told the council
might be summarized thus:
Act Now, is Fiat
The time of promises has passed.
If Belgium is to live the council must
act. The Associated Press is able to
state that three questions of vital im
Belgium, portance to the re-establishment
of Belgium, financially, econom
ically and politically, were discussed.
The first question was the immediate
advance to Belgium of about ten bil
lion francs, the second, the exporta
tion to Belgium from England and
the United States of raw materials
and the third the cession to Belgium
of the left bank of the L'Escaut river
and the Lemberg peninsula.

Mine Workers Appeal to!
Hines in Effort to Assure
Men Employment
WASHINGTON, April 4. A serious
situation in the coal mining industry I
was described today to Director Gen
eral Hines by Frank J. Hayes and oth
er officials of the United Mine Work
ers. Many of the mines, particularly,
in Ohio, were said to have shut down
because of lack of orders, while others
have reduced their operating forces
greatly or are working only part time
As the railroads consume one-third of
the fuel produced, the director general '
was asked to see that orders were dis
tributed as equitably ; as possible to
keep as many men employed as pos
sible and prevent actual suffering. i
Mr. Hines Informed the union lead
ers that the individual roads did their
j own
buying but assured them it was
the policy of the administration to pre-
jvent bunching of orders which would
cause economic disturbance
Investigation was promised of in-1
stances in which roads were said to
have concentrated their orders in one
district to the detriment of others.

Premiers Were in Council
Illness at First Thought Not
Serious, tut in Short Time
He Was Unable to Talk
PARIS, April 4. (By the Associated
rress.) Reassuring ueVs. from Presi
dent Wilson's bedside was sent to the
peace delegates late this evening.
The news indicated that the presi
dent's condition was such as to make
it advisable that he remain in his
home at leat for several days.
Study of the case has caused Rear
Admiral Grayson, the president's phy
sician, to reach the conclusion that
the president is not suffering from
influenza but that the severity of the
case is such that the patient will re
quire careful watching.
With Colonel House in the place of
President Wilson the premiers met
this afternoon at the war office, but
agreed to meet tomorrow at the presi
dent's house for the purpose of con
sulting him, if his condition has suf
ficiently improved, should a question
arise to make it necessary.
The illness of President Wilson has
caused numerous wild rumors to tie
circulated in the city, and not even
the delegates themselves are immune.
Colonel House had heard that the
president was really down with a case
of influenza, but Rear-Admiral Gray
son personally assured both him and
the premiers that Mr. Wilson did not
have the disease. He warned them,
however, that the utmost care must be
exercised to prevent it from getting
worse.
Informally the proceedings of the
council were related to the president.
King Albert of Belgium, who present
ed his country's case to the council
today, made an excellent impression,
but is understood to have been given
no promises. The Czecho-Slovak ques
tion was again discussed today, as was
reparations.
PARIS, April 4. King Albert of
Belgium, who met with the council of
four at its forenoon session, s?nt to
President Wilson, who is ill., an. offi
cial expression of regret at his indis
position. When the king talked with
the president yesterday, the president
appeared to be well. The president
himself did not appear to feel a warn
ing of the approaching illness. It was
during the latter part of his meeting
with Premiers Clemenceau and Lloyd
George that his illness developed. The
president's voice began to grow husky
enough to cause comment from the
premiers before the adjournment of
the conference.
After 6 o'clock the- president's con
dition became such that he could
scarcely talk. Dr. Grayson saw him
soon after the conference adjourned
and ordered him to bed.
Members of the president's house

respondents were advised of his con
dition yesterday, but In the hope that
a night's rest would bring definite im

Mr. Morrow in a statement asserte
that from the outlet of conferences
with the railroad administration re
garding th erailroad fuej policy, the
coal operators had declined to discuss
prices, just as the-director general
had refused to name a price which he
considered fair for any district. The
operators insisted, he said, that any
determination of fair prices should
be made by an impartial agency.
"It should he clearly understood,"
he said, 'that the bituminous coal
mining industry woa'd not . advocate
such price determination under, nor
mal conditions. The industry has rec
ognized, however, that under the ab
normal conditions of readjustment
with widespread unemployment and
unrest, a special condition prevails
which should be met broadly and un
selfishly and the operators have ex
pressed their readiness to meet thi3
condition in that manner. The direc

willing to deal with this condition in
that manner." ' " .
Replying to the assertion of. Direc

It is said that many men have quit

' By Edith Hyde" '
' "The Girl of. the Golden Apple."
The woman who would be beau
tiful must take care of her nails.
They make or mar the hands. Any
woman can learn to be her own
manicurist, without an elaborate '
outfit. Four implements sharp
curved scissors, nail-file, chamois
covered polisher and orange stick
--are all that are essential.- "
To prepare for manicuring the
fingers should be held a few min
utes in warm, soapy water, which
is better if it has a dash of tinc
ture of benzoin, or perfumed
water. The object is to soften
the nails for cutting and filing.
They should be kept the exact
length of the fingers, and trimmed
in a graceful oval curve. .'After
trimming, and while they are' still
soft, push the skin down closeiy
about the roots, so that the deli
cate hued lunula, or half-moon
wiil show. Do not trim off this
scarf skin; i? it has been neglect
ed time and patienca willbe nec-';
essary. Push the skin back gently
with the tip of the file, and avoid
breaking it.
Doii't use too much cosmetic
..powder on the nails; a too-deep
tinti is vulgar. A little polishing
powder should be used once or
twice a week, and lightly rubbea
with the chamois polisher to give
the, finishing touch.
Do not clean your nails with a
P.i8ted instrument. If you have
hard, brittle nails, rub cold cream,
vaseline, or almond oil on them
bc-rere retiring. If your nails are
ten'lar and delicate, use wax and
alum to strengthen them. A cut
lemou is useful to strengthen the
nails and to correct a tendency to
aguails (called hangnails popular
ly). .
Vc-ry fine emt-ry tinted with car
mine is the simplest nail powder
used, but oxide of .tin perfumed
v.-jth a few drops of lavender or
violet oil and tinted with carmine
is better. No pov der should le

The Rowena Well in Rumels County, Tex.
Has Just Come In. It Is Only 4
Miles From Our 4,000 Acres
YOUR CHANCE IS NOW
The Safety First Oil & Gas Company is incorporated under the laws of the
State of Arizona. In this company the snail investor shares equally with the large
investor, as per pro rata shares held, whether the company secures one well or many
wells. The company is not wild-catting.. It is net working on imagination. It is
in proven territory to develop known prospects. There is no doubt of successful re
sults. Fortunes are being made every day in oil investments. We believe the same
possibilities, are contained in our proposition. One successful speculation in oil .s
worth a lifetime of meager living.
Whether the first well is a gusher, a gacrser or dry, the company intends to
rink additional wells. It proposes to drill until producing wells are brought in. If
vc get one or. more producing wells, ever shareholder will profit wiih the com
pany. Our shares at 25 cents offer safer.surer and quicker profitable returns than
do shares in some concerns selling at $5 or more On the day we begin drilling,
there is not the least doubt of ready bids for this stock at many times its present
price.
Our leases alone offer greater security and safety for-investment than the en
tire collateral of many concerns. Many of the largest oil ccrporalions are now drill
ing in this field. Any of them may brinj a gusher or great producer at any mo
ment. Runnels county , of Texas, where 4,000 acres of our leases are located,
. already has producing wells. Others will be brought in as drilling advances.

j .FEDERAL LEAGUE WAS
! LIABILITY, DECLARES
! HERRMANN AT TRIAL
Baltimore Club Had Only One
Valuable Player, Suit
Court Is Told
WASHINGTON. April 4. Declara
tion that" the franchise of the Baii:
niore Federal league baseball club was
a "liability instead of an asset and
worth absolutely nothing" was made
August Herrmann, chairman of tae
national baseball commission in testi
fying today in the 900,000 damage
suit of the Baltimore club against the
National and American leagues and
certain officials of the defunct Federal
league. Mr.. Herrmann was on the
stand the entire day and concluded his
testimony just before the District of
Columbia supreme court which is hear
ing the case adjourned until Monday.
The Baltimore club, Mr. Herrmann
testified, had no players of value with
the exception of one man. He did not
give the name of this player.
Few Valuable Players
We gave them an opportunity to
dispose of all their players by sale or
otherwise," the witness said in refer
ence to negotiations with the Balti
more club following signing of the
baseball peace agreement. "In my
judgment they had no players that any
club wanted to purchase. Some of the
Federal league clubs had a few play
ers of value. In my opinion tbe Balti
more franchise was not worth a dollar.
They had no circuit, no players of any
value and their overhead expenses
were too great and the attendance was
not good." . .
Portions of an address given by
Chairman Herrmann at a dinner ten
dered the National Association of Pro
fessional Baseball leagues by the Co
lumbus American association club at
Columbus In November, 1913, were
read to the jury. In the course of his
"address, Mr. Herrmann was quoted as
saying that baseball was "open to all"
and that anyone had a "right to en
gage in it in any capacity that they
please without any interference of the"
part of those engaged in organized
baseball."
Asked Big League Club
Mr. Herrmann said representatives
of the Baltimore club were present at
the New. York conference at which
the Federal league signed the "peace
pact" with the two older leagues and
at that time made an effort to obtain
a franchise in either the National or
American league. Chairman Herrmann
said he told the Baltimore represen
tatives that as matters stood there
were as many clubs in the east as eith
er league desired.
The national commission, he said,
was" given full power to act In the mat
ter and it turned down the proposal to
give Baltimore a place in either of the
old leagues. The commission promised
however, he said, to use its influence
in getting Baltimore into the Interna
tional league. There was no thought
of conspiracy, he testified, and "noth
ing whatever was done to hurt Balti
more." Y.M.CA, AND HICH ,
SCHOOL NINES TO PLAY
A baseball game will h played at
5 o'clock this afternoon at the War
ren ball park between selected play
ers of the Y. M. C. A. and Bisbee high

fast throughout and a large crowd will
probably witness the game. As the

gium and Agreed With .
Von Tirpitz, Is Charge
BERNE, Thursday, April 3.
(French Wireless Service.) Mathias
Etzberger, chairman of the German
armistice commission and member of
the German government, was accused
of being the author of a document
L. .- r-i
written in 1914 showing . that Ger
many's peace terms, if she won, would
include large annexations and indem
nities, Herr Landauer, a representa
tive of the Munich soldiers and work
men's council, declared in a speech at
Augsburg, Bavaria, according to a dis
patch to the Frankfort eZitung. Lan
dauer, who was speaking at a meeting
in memory of Kurt Fisner, the late
Bavarian premier, said he had a copy
of the document.
Landauer at first refused to give the
name of the author, except that he
was still a member of the government.
Finally, however, he said that the per
son to whom he alluded was Herr Erz
berger. Among the peace terms mentioned
in the document, Landauer said, were:
Annexation of Belgium, French Nor
mandy, and several towns on the south
eastern coast of Egypt.
Annexation of the territories on the
eastern frontier of Germany which
have since become separate states.
Establishment of a large German
colonial empire. ... (
Payment of a war indemnity calcu
lated to cover Germany's expenses
during the first ten months of the war
33 well as the entire German debt be
fore the war.
Herr Landauer asserted that these
terms were approved In principle by
General von Falkenhayen, General von
Moltke and Admiral von Tirpitz.
PLAN TO SACRIFICE
COW COSTS 30 LIVES
BOMBAY, April 4. Plans of Mo
hammedans to sarifice one cow at
Katapur precipitated a riot In which
30 Mohammendans.
Burned several to death.
Injured 60 more.
Burned most of the village.
Kurbani is a religious ceremonial
of the Musselman in which a cow. is
the sacrificial, offering.
Taking of life is a violation of the
Hindu religion.
Where so many races and religions
are brought together as in India, the
problem of reconciling them is diffi
cult. At Katarpur the Musselmans have
carried otu their ceremonials within
their own baliwicks in time" past with
out interference, but this time all as
surance that the sacrifice would be
made quietly within Mohammedan
precincts availed nothing.

try Afflicted With Men
tal Far-Sightedness r 1 :
WASHINGTON, April 4. Urging
that Americans awake to the problems
confronting the country. Senator
Johnson of California, in a statement
issued tonight declared: "We've been
afflicted with mental far-sighteOneso
since the signing of the armistice and
unable to see "the ills and problems
of our own." t
"Our demobilized soldiers ask only
justice and work and get neither." ce
clared his statement, "our ordinary
business lags and because of tbe gov
ernment's inactivity or indifference
cannot resume its normal conditions;
unemployment increases dally and for
eign agitators play upon distress and
discomfort.
"We are under the spell of a worn
hypnotism, unconscious of what is
transpiring about ub. Our commuting
government hovers around European
capitals, basking in the sunlight of
foreign adulation. The president is In
Paris, the secretary of state there, the
secretary of the navy in Italy, the
secretary of war on his way to Europe,
the heads of various administrative
departments are scattered east and
west and north and south in Europe
there's nobody home in America.
"It has become a reproach -In many
quarters now to think in terms of

to cry a halt. Let's make it respect

of the psycnology of the war. "
We have watcaed these boys coming home now for weeks. Have
seen them grow illuminated when they saw the old town again.
They know what motner love means now; and what the flag says,
as it rustles way up there under the vault of God's free heaven.
They have learned 7g lessons lessons that the youth of the land
were missing a little time ago. v"
And those who stoyed at home have been taught as well.
Wo think a lot more of each other than we did two years ago.
We have suffered for each, other; have given up our beloved;
many have given their fortunes, some their limbs, tome their lives;
.and all that the world might be a better place to live in after while.
And the home coming is focusing the?e radiating throbs and motives
and understandings into a bright, burning spot of white hope for hu
manity while the flame endures.
Aye, the going ww mayhap embittered, and the waiting was a
horror, but the returning was worth it all. ' .
America and Americanism means more to us and to them now.
The Monroe
The "Monroe doctrine" Is on everybody's lips in Washington these
days. It has taken the place of "Making the world safe for democracy'
and "Freedom of the seas" as the popular subject ot discussion.
But it is doubtful if half of the people wh.o talk bo glibly of the Mon
roe doctrine and the League o' Nations know what the Monroe doctrine
is and how it originated. ; "
It's not a law, national or International, although it has become by
common acceptance an unwritten law of the nations.
It is nothing more than a passage from President Monroe's message
to congress on December s, 1823. It reads as follows:
"The American continents, by the fre3 and independent condition
which they have assumed and maintain, are not to be considered as sub
jects for colonization by European powers."
That policy has been strictly adhered o by the United States ever
since, and has several times brought ua to the verge of war, when
some foreign power assumed an (aggressive attitude toward South
American nations. i
In his message President Monroe went on to point out that the
people of the United States have kept aloof from European dissensions,
and ask only in return that NortH and South America should be equally
let alone. He continued: - . .. .
We should consider any attempt on their part to extend their
system to any portion of this hemisphere as dangerous to our peace
and safety, and while no objection is made to any existing colony or
dependency of theirs, yet any further intrustiori or interference would
be regarded as the manifestation of an unfriendly spirit towards the
United States. .
The Best Start in Life
Way back into the beginning of time you've had ancestors. Thou
sands of persons now long dead and gone are your'direct relatives
so direoi. that had they not lived and given children to the world
you would not be here today.
All of these forebears, with the possible exception of the three
or four most recent ones, have , done one thing' and only one thing
for you they've made it possible for you to be alive today.' Their blood
is in your veins end their characteristics, the scientists say, influences
your life. But so far as making life easier for you through bequeatn
ing you their savings, they haven't done it. - Unless you are one of
the very small group, not a single dollar of tho money that is yours
today, was saved by anyone farther back along your pncestrial tree
than your great-grandfather!
Thrift, paving and accumulation of money have been habits of man
kind since Biblical days and long before. But most of the fortunes
of today were made by men who lived and died only yesterday when
time is reckoned by the innumerable days man has been on tiie earth.
Judging by the world's experience it is impossible for any man to bo con
serve his savings and hedge them about by law as to keep them
intact for his children and his childen's children for more than a
comparatively few years. It is not in tha scheme of things that any
man should perpetuate his fortune for long.
But it is in the scheme of things that every man should give his
children the best start possible in life. It is up to all of . us to save
not for the purpose of amassing a huge fortune to be as a memorial
to our ashes for aeons to come for history proves it 3 impossible
to do this but simply and solely to give our children the start In
the battle of life that they deserve.
Not All History Is New
We think we are making history. Maybe we are. But not all of It
is as new as some of us imagine.
Taking a slant through Plutarch's Lives, we find that about 3000
years ago, there was a great war on between Sparta and Athens. Lysan
der was the Marshal Foch of the Spartans, and he handed the Athen
ians an armistice to sign. It read:
"You shall pull down the long walls, quit all the cities you are pos
sessed of, and keep within the bounds of Attica. On these conditions
you shall have peace, provided you pay what is reasonable, and restore
the exiles. As for the number of ships you are to keep, you must com
ply with tho orders we shall give you."
A few weeks went by. And it seems they had the same trouble
about armistices those days that we have now. Lysander sent the
Athenians a message warning them "that they had violated the terms
of their capitulation; for their walls were still standing after the
time fixed for demolishing them was passed; and that, since they had
broken the first article, they, must expect new ones from the war council."
Which shows that armistices then as now require amendments. A
good reliable armistice is like a clock and need3 winding.
The assurance that Russia Is going to the dogs is the first defi
nite promise of a reform In Uie affairs of the Slav.
As a matter of fact, German diplomats will probably regard anything
less than the worst possible punishment as a victory, for Germany.
We are soon to Lave the world's greatest merchant "marine, and
its future is br:ht except for England and congress.
The treasury of the new republic of Hunland will have its burdens,
but there will always be enough cash on hand to put federal buildings
lu cross-roads towns and dredge isolated brooks.
Any form of government would
that habit of looking out for the
Russian prisoners iu Germany, now tui by America, arc clamoring
for their inalienable right to go home and starve.

JAPAN SPLIT OVER
RETAINING ISLES
TAKEII FROM
IS
Part of Population Favors For-
t tification, OtKers Wish to
. . it' ni
iive-up nan
TOKIO, March 3 (Correspondence!
of the Associated Press). Public;
opinion in Japan is not entirely unani-j
juous on the question whether Japan j
hall retain possession of the Mar-
iiall and Caroline Islands which she ;
took from Germany and now holds.!
The Osaka Mainichi sets for the the
attitude of many Japanese thfngers j
in an article in which that newspaper)
insists that the islands shall' be re
tained. The Mainichi declares that,
if America was allowed to seize and i
fortify Hawaii and thus to greatly
threaten Japan; if she .was permitted!
to occupy Guam and the Philippines, j
making them not only a source of,
wealth to htrself, but also a great;
menace to Japan, China and the Brit-j
ish and .-Dutch possessions; if Aus
tralia and New Zealand have similar
control over New Guinea and "Samoa, 1
it i3 certain that Japan shall possess ;
the Marshall and Caroline islands, ex-1
ercising the same right and rule over j
them. r j
"And in so doing," the paper aserts, j
"Japan will be only acting the partj
of a small watch dog faithfully pro j
tecting its own house, in a very differ-!
ent manner and spirit from the Amerl-!
can wolf whose wolfish ambition is In
deed to be feared. If Japan is not to
be allowed to fortify the islands she
took from Germany and which of right
belongs to her, then the defenses of
Gibraltar, the Suez Canal and other
points should be razed.
"Racial discriminatory treatment in
thees respects, too, should be abolish
ed and these islands not be left to
white man's domination."
The opposite view was expressed by
Yukio Ozakl, former minister of jus
tice, in an address delivered in Tokio
a few days ago in which he said:
"It is indeed, a great honor fori
Japan to occupy the position of a
stockholder in that great international
corporation, the League of Nations.
Tho honor is far greater than Japan
will obtain by the possession of the
Marshall and Caroline islands."

SUDDENLY ATTACKED
BY SERIOUS ILLNESS
Nervous Breakdown Follows
Cold; Becomes Sick
While in Conference
(Continued from Pag3 One)
provement, the correspondents were
requested not to make public what
was then regarded as only a slight
Indisposition.
PARIS. April 4. (By the Associated
Press.) Until late today no specific!
bulletin was ; Issued concerning: the
condition of President Wilson. Were
it not that the president had been un
der a terrific strain ana deprived of
his usual amount of exercise, his ill
ness would be the cause of little
worry.
Since his return the president's
work has been enormous and he has
been unable to secure more than an
occasional walk at odd intervals ?
either with Mrs. Wilson of Rear Ad
miral Grayson. Golf has been dropped
from his schedule and an automobile
ride now an dthen about the city has
been the president's only form of re
creation, in addition to the short
walks.
Rear Admiral Grayson has been con
stantly on the alert watching the pres
ident for signs of a breakdown, espe
cially since the two days on board
ship when the president was slightly
ill.
Other physicians have not been
called in for consultation and up to
midday Friday the services of na
trained nurses had been solicited, but
Mrs. Wilson has been always within
reach of the husband, assisting in the
care for him.
Rear t Admiral; j Grayson Is always
nea rtbe president His treatment for
the patient consists of the require
ment of absolute quiet and, rest. '
The president at luncheon was lim
ited to oyster soup and a light entree.
The American executive, however,
is sick enough to make him not care!
to read. He appears to be quite con-j
tent to rest and sleeps lightly from j
time to time.
After the forenoon session of the i
council today the members on depart
ing i enewed their wishes for the rapid
recovery of President Wilson.

TELLS DYSPEPTICS
WHAT TO EAT
Avoid Indigestion, South Stomach,!
Heartburn, Gas on the
Stomach, Etc., Etc.
Indigestion and practically all forms
of stomach trouble, say medical au
thorities are due nine times out of ten
to an excess of hydrochloric acid in
the stomach. "Chronic acid Stomach" '
is exceedingly dangerous and suffer-!
ePs should do cither oue of two things:
Either they can go on a limited and
often disagreeable diet, avoiding foods
that disagiee with them, that irritate
the stomach and lead to excess acid
secretion or they can eat as they
please, in reason and make it a prac
tice to counteract the effect of the
harmful acid and prevent formation of
gas, sourness or premature fermenta
tion by the use of Laxcarin tablets.
There is probably no better, no sare
or more reliable stomach antiacid j
than Laxcarin, and it is widely used i
for this purpose. It has no direct ac
tion on the stomach and it is not
harmful by any means. Contains no i
habit forming drugs such as opium, co
cain herion or alcohol. A few Lax
carin tablets will remove the whole
cause of the trouble and the meal di
gests naturally and healthfully with
out need' of pepsin pills or anything
else.
Try this plan and eat what you want
at your next meal and ?ee it this is
not the beet advice you 'ever had on
"what to eat."
It Is safest to order Laxcarin from
the distributors as there are many who
substitute on account of its wonder
ful properties. There is also a very
great demand and it is safest to order
enough for a full treatment bo that you
may have enough without having to
wait for the next box while you are in
the course of recuperation. Six boxes
only costs $5 and this tina aolmluut is
nothing in comparison with the relief
they offer. Or you may order by mail
a box which is only $1. Send moner
by registered letter, or money orders
by regular mail. Laxcarin Products

armistice was signed. In six days
Pershing's men took. 28,000 pris
oners, and drove the Germans to
a point where nothing but surren
' der or an armistice could save
them from disaster.
The 89th division was thrown
into - the line twice during the
final battle and with the othher 20
divisions engaged won for itself
everlasting fame.
Harold A. Furlong of Detroit
was first, lieutenant of Company
B, 353d Infantry of the S9th.
When the fight began on Novem

machine-gun fire from the front
became so Jhot it could go no,

The company commander and
many of the soldiers in Rurlong's
company had been killed. Lieuten

U. S. OFFERED MORE

Second-hand Autos Used One

Original Price
LONDON, March 12. (Correspon
dence of The Associated Press,)
Disposition of American army sup
plies in England will be a big and
complicated task. Owing to the na
ture of certain contracts and an agree
ment with the British government1,
the army cannot begin selling mate
rial for at least a month yet, in the
opinion of army officers, but they are
preparing the way out. Some mate
rial still i3 being delivered to the army
while other contracts are held .in
abeyance pending settlement.
When the United States entered the
war it was agreed that all contracts
for supplies should be made through
the British government. It also was
agreed that at the termination of hos
tilities the United States' should not
sell material without consent of the
British government, nor could any of
the contracts arranged through the
British be cancelled . except by nego
tiations through the government.
To Profit on Sales
Even if there are some delays the
United States doubtless- will profit on
many of its sales. No agreement could
be reached with the firm which held
a contract to deliver to the American
army about 200 huge gasoline tank3
for use in France. Delivery is con
tinuing, but it Is not worrying quar-l
matre officers as the army already
has been offered more than the con
tract price for the lot. With, some
other material the same situation
obtains. .
The work of settling unfinished
contracts is progressing, but British
officials are unwilling for a huge
amount of material to be suddenly
dumped' oh the market notwithstand
ing there is an insistent demand for
some of it at inflated prices. British
officials say there is no. desire what
ever to deprive Americans of an ad
vantageous market, but they argue
that they mus talso consider the dis
posal of the enormous amount of Brit
ish army supplies stored in England.
The American Red Cross had no
agreement with the British govern
ment and recently disposed of a lot of
motor transport equipment for ap
proximately $27,550. The purchase
price was $24,500 and the equipment
had been In use a year. Any kind of
la motor Is in. great demand In Eng
land. .
No record has been kept of the to
tal amount of contracts allotted for
the American army in Great Britain,
but, like everything In the war,, it
was measured in huge figuers. It 13
estimated, however, that the ordnance
contracts alone amounted to about
$500,000,000. Much of this, of course',
will not bring as good returns -as the
materials coming under jurisdiction
of the quartermaster's department.

Mining and Financial News
BY REVIEW
NEW YORK, 'April 4. The move
! ment in prices cf the stock exchange
durin gthe greater part of today's ses
sion was extremely uncertain, but the
entire list rose spiritedly in the final
hour, In response to a sweeping de
mand for rails, especially investment
shares.
Southern Pacific was the dominant
feature, its advance of 4 points be
ing attended by free accumulation of
numerous larg elndividual blocks.
Much of the early irregularity of
i market leaders wer etraceable to the
steel dispute with Director General
Hines, sudden abandonment of the!
Mercantile Marine deal with the
United States government, and fur
ther contradictory news from the
peace-conference.
Steels, motors and their specialties
and sugars, chemical and express
stocks shared most extensively with
th elater movement in rails, strength
nroi'Q i 1 in or a 1 ho ortil'A finicVi Qoloet
amounted to 800,000 shaers.
Foreign bonds Were easier, but do
mestic issues, including the Liberty
group, reflected the better tones for
high class rails. Total sales, par value,
aggregated $14,800,000. Old United
States bonds were unchanged on call.
NEW YORK, April 4. Dun's tomor
row will.f-ay: '
With full recognition of the uncer
tain state of the highly important iron
arid steel industry, due to differences
over th eprice question, it is never
theless clear that business has added
something to Its recent recovery. The
growth of confidence, which ns near
ly everywhere manifest; seems greater
tha nthe expansion of actual opera
tions, but activity broadens with ech
week's passage and is supported by
substantial contributions to the list of
helpful factors. New opportunities
for the extension of American enter
prise abroad are not infrequently mak
ing their appearance. With many do
mestic concerns that had been com
pletely or largely engaged on govern
ment work now turning to other chan
nels of production, and with prices of
some commodities at a less inflated
position ,ine wnoie economic situation
steadily assumes a more naturaF as
pect and the benefits are beginning
to show in a business development.

PARIS, April 4. Pity the nations

proposition non-member states have
to face is the insistance of labor for
an arrangement which will bar from
international commerce products turn
ed out by nations not subscribing to
the international labor organlaztion

to the circulation on the left bank of
the Rhine between the several occu

Regarding bolshevism and the opin
ions of civilians in the occupied area,

While recognizing that the Inhabitants
owe the quiet in the region to the
American troops it is evident that the
population has no really friendly spirit
for our soldiers."

posed the bill in its tempetous passage
through the legislature, will take no
chances on the measure and are pre
paring the way for a referendum in
case it is declared valid, according to
the statement tonight of E. O'Brien
Mann of Cochise, ! who said he had
been watching the bill for the smaller
land holders. ' Attorney General Jones
opinion of yesterday is taken at the
capital to mean, that in his view an

ted to the secretary of state without
executive action cannot become law
unless it receives a three-fourths vote
in the legislature.- .
The land leasing bill has had a
stormy career ever since it first came
up in the house. It would permit leases
for 20 years and .would do away with
