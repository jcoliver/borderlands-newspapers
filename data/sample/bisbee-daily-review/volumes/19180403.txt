In a city primary election devoid

or contest yesterday two tickets were
named for the general city election to
be held in may. Despite the cold,
windy weather, a larger vote than an
ticipated was polled. Occasional visi
tors at the voting places dropped their
ballots into the boxes, but at no time
was there a waiting list.
The heaviest vote was cast1 in the
third ward, the first ward showing
next in numbers and the second ward
bringing up the rear.
The ticket composed of democrats
and .republicans and known as the
non-partisans, received more votes, in
view of no contest, than anticipated
before the primaries. No effort was
made to bring out . their voting
strength, while the other ticket sent
men throughout the city reminding the
voters that yesterday was primary

candidates in an effort, to make as
large a showing as possible in the
early race. '

SETTLED AFTER
JURY SELECTED
In the suprior court at Tombstone!
yesterday the case of Walter Lind vs. !
the C. St A. Mining company was setj
for trail. The action was brought by
mc ibiuiui lut uaiuagca in lur duiij
of $10,000 alleged to be due for in
jures received in Oliver shaft in Sep
tember. 191C. . Lind is a Flnlander,
and had one leg broken and a dislocat
ed hip in a cave-in. The company of
fered a settlement soon after the ac
cident happened, but Lind was advis
ed not to accept and the matter has
been banging fire. .
' ' Yesterday tbe Case was called for
trial and the jury was selected and
tbe evidence was about to be Intro
duced when the attorney for the plain
tiff. t. A. Richardson of Douglas, ask
ed for a. short recess. It was granted
by the court and he then approached
tbe attorneys for the defendant com
pany and asked them if they were still
willing to settle for the amount that
had been offered in the firat place. An
agreement was reached and tbe jury
was discharged and Lind will now re
ceive what was promised bim less
what his attorney charged for his
services. '
It was reported around Tombstone
that Richardson did not tike the looks
of the jury after it liad been selected
and w,aa afraid to go to trial ana mat
be thought a small portion was better:

Effects of the War
"I was mightily impressed with condi
tions in the east," writes a Kansas friend
just back from a New York trip to thii edi
tor regarding the effects of the war. "Real
ly," he goes on, "we don't know anything
about this war out here as compared with
what they are going through back in the
eastern states. Business conditions are in
frightful condition on account of inability
to ship and get shipments." Then he gives
examples of the difficulty of freight move
ments. In a big wholesale stationery and
supply house this Kansas man saw a sta
tioner from Baltimore buying writing ink
and with it he bought twelve first class
tickets from New York' to Baltimore so he
could check one hundred and fifty pounds
of ink with each ticket.
HE COULD NOT GET THAT INK BY
FREIGHT AT ALL. ?
According to this Kansas man, they are
hauling freight between New York and
Philadelphia in motor trucks at ninety cents
per hundred weight, while the express
charge between these cities is sixty cents
and the freight rate twenty-three cents.
Again, he talked with the manager of a
plant in Brooklyn who uses two carloads
of boxes a day and had always bought them
from Maine. He was coming west to Illi
nois to see if he could not get shipments
frcm there, as it was impossible to get his
boxes any more by way of any New Eng
land railroad.
In the New York hotels they are living
up to the fcod regulations to the strict let
ter and spirit of all the meatless, wheatless
days and economies connected therewith.
Bread portions are weighed and money
cannot buy more for each person with each
meal.
This editor real this letter with much
pride and satisfaction as regards the observ
ance of food economy, and with much
thought as regards the stricture on freight
shipments. True it is that we do not know
about the war in the west as compared with
the east. In the manufacturing and con
gested centers the war has come home in
earnest. More and more are the efforts of
all workmen and the offices of all car
wheels and the uses of all machinery de
voted to the advancement of this nation's
war program as fast and as far as possible.
We are just beginning to feel it out here.
It pinches in one place and another. But
the real pressure has not yet begun to be
felt in the more sparsely settled regions of
the union.
But it will come. Soon the entire coun
try will settle down to a strictly war basis.
Economy and self-denial will be practiced
upon a scale and by means of an organiza
tion undreamed bf now. All industrial ac
tivities will be devoted in a more or less
degree to war work! Every. pound of food
that we do not actually need to sustain life
in this country must be sent to our allies
and bur soldiers abroad. We must build
the ships to carry it across the seas. We
must speed up our airplane program. We
must make more guns and shells. We must
raise more food and make more freight
cars and locomotives and steel rails and
scores of other things imperative to the
successful conduct of modern war.
AND WE MUST DO THESE THINGS
WITH TWO MILLION LESS ABLE
BODIED YOUNG MEN IN OUR INDUS
TRIAL WALKS OF LIFE.
This nation's present colossal task must
be made the 3erious business of every indi
vidual in this nation or the magnitude of
the task will be doubled. The. present Ger
man offensive in France will be felt direct
ly in this country. It means that we must
do more than we had planned to do and do
it much more quickly.
Every phase of our national life is af
fected by the war, and day by day its in
fluences spread to our individual life and
affairs. We must face. this as an inevita
able thing. Face it bravely and uncom
plainingly. ., For we MUST win the war.
AH things, life, treasure, happiness, ambi-'
bition, everything but honor, is subservi
ent to our war aims. We must do without ;
deny ourselves luxuries and conveniences;
speak out always bravely and truly, for our
counlty; set an example in word and deed
in all thingj lo promote and make more ef
fective the conduct of the war. Our in
dividual parts in this war are greater than
we imagine. The thoughts and feelings
and courage of the people as a whole de
termine the speed and effectiveness and
valor of the nation in its organized effort
as represented by its men and equipment
in action in camp and field.

THE
WORLD WAR'
Many arguments may be found in favor
of the passage of the special session of the
Airzona legislature to be. called thi3 sum
mer by the governor, of a law for the prose
cution and detention of alien enemies. Few
if any objections to such a law can be dis
covered. The Review has already called
attention to the possibilities of assisting the
government in stamping out espionage:
to the added safety which the state would
enjoy.
To make the law successful, however,
the governor would necessarily have to in
clude in his call not only the anti-alien
enemy bill, but provision Jo do away with
the pernicious anti-blacklist statute now
incorporated in the Arizona codes. With
out the exclusion of this law, no statute
for the inquisition of pro-Germans, for an
investigation of pacifists, agitators and
propagandists, could be a success.
Efforts have been made on several oc
casions to bring to a test in the courts the
anti-blacklist law. Those who secured the
passage of the measure, knowing its weak
ness, have evaded these efforts. Aj a rc-,
suit the law stands a" block to the state's
investigation of records of any of its in
habitants. . Individuals, who otherwise
might be of inestimable value in discover
ing the true minds of alien enemies, and
employers who could assist in the same
manner, are deterred.
The safety of the state depends largely
on the extermination of the agitator, the
propagandist, the I. W. W., disgruntled
pacifist and pro-German. Production in
the state is hampered if not threatened by
the pretence of these parasites. The indus
tries of the state are constantly in danger
of their injurious work. The very founda
tion of society may be shaken by their per
fidious activities.
Some direct effective means for dealing
with them should be devised. The govern
ment may intern men for disloyal remarks.
Women, unless they can be convicted of
espionage, the government may not hinder.
The government has greater tasks in other
districts for its secret service than in Ari
zona. The government must direct the eye
of it3 searching inquisitors over the entire
nation. Federal officers are slow in action
as compared to state officials. . The red
tape of their machinery and their intricate
system prevents the direct action which a
state law would provide.
The Review has already called to the at
tention of the governor one means of do
ing away with the Hun in this land. The
passage of a measure providing for the in
ternment of all an ti-Americans would ac
complish .this end. The abolition of the
anti-blacklist law would make effective the
alien enemy jstatute.
State officials are anxious to do their
share to stamp out the Hun and his dis
guised clique of agitators, pacifists and I.
W. Wv In a statement to the public the
under-sheriff of thisicounty Monday de
clared he had 'concluded an investigation
of one pro-German case. He added that
where federal action could not be "secured
sufficiently speedily in such cases, he him
self would urge United States officials to
act if he were notified. He would go so
far, he said, as to assist in securing evidence
on which the government could proceed.
Well known citizens aproved his state
ments, : and offered their best services to
assist him.
' The anti:Americans of Arizona would be
in the hands just such efficient public serv
ants as this under-sheriff and these well
known citizens, if the governor should
make possible the passage of this new law.
Now. is the time to act. Now is the time
to rid Arizona and America of reptiles of
the copper head and tory species of old war
days. And now is the most propitious
time for the enactment of a statute which
will permit action and provide relief. After,
this'special session of the Arizona legisla
ture a long period will elapse before an
other body assembles. The governor should
save time, hasten the calling of hi3 special
session, and by all means provide in the
first measure passed by the, legislature for
protection of this state, of : production, of',
industry, of business, of society, of re
sources, of labor, and of morale from the
pro-German and his allies, the pacifist, the
agitator, the propagandist, the I. W. W.,
and the sowers of the seed of discontent.

JUUUL LV
KM TELLS DOUGLAS
COMMIE WW BOOTLEGGERS
BE
SHOULD
WORKED
ROADS
Speaking evtniporaneously at a
Douglas cleanup meeting on Monday)
night Judge A. (". Lxx kwood of th
Superior Court, declared that the ltulK,
of the citizens cf Cochise county di I
not take the prohibition law seriously,
and that eifcht men o'.rt of ever- ten
eligible for jury service in this county
did not believe in the prohibition law
and were not in sympathy with it.
The meeting was held at the (Jrat?
Methodist church. Sixty-five persons,
about a third women and a few chil
dren, were present. It was called to
hear the reports of the committee ap
pointed at a similar meeting two
week.? apo. principally the committee's
report which wailed upon the county
officials. This reiort was adopted.
Transporters Easily Convicted
Judge Lock wood came to Douglas. '
he explained, on juvenile court mat
ters, but would gladly pak. he said,
since it was the will of those present..
Cheers greeted him when he arose.
Since the prohibition law has gor.'i
into effect Judge Lockwood has ser.
tenced more than 4) men on charges
of violating it. and only ten of then
have returned to be tried again, h-.-said.
According to the judge, the med
icine he has been giving them in the
form of sentences has been remedial,
if not an absolute cure. ,
Ninety per cent of persons convict
ed under the prohibition law have lieen
for bringing liq.or into the state, l"s
ually an ofiicer catches a man outright
in such a case and evidence a-plentv
to convict is furnished.
Sellers Hard to Catch !
Whiskey sellers are much harder to ;
convict. They won't sell when an of
ficer is around, the judge explained,
and for that reason sufficient evidence
is hard to get. "You must remember."
said Judge Lockwood. "that we can't
convict John Smith for bootlegging
just because someone suspect that he
is and asks us to. Evidence is neces
sary." Although their business is nefarious,
the whiskey seller in a way. according
to Jtulge Iockwood. is to be admired,
"when we try to find out who furnishes
him with whiskey he won't tell. The
seller usually works for so much a dny
with the agreement that if he is
caught he will not eixse his employer
and will take his medicine. So there
is one thing about it. he keeps his
word. This' makes it hard to get the
man who supplies him with iqluor."
Would Give Extra Credit
The judge said that giving a boot
legger extra credit for working on the
road was noi legal, but that it had a'
way been done. He explained why.
by law. a bootlegger could not le mad;
to work on the road. jind said for that
reason he had been giving them four
times as great sentences and offering '
them Jour days credit in jail for one j
on the road to induce them to work.
Giving convicts extra time for road
work has been practiiwl in ihis county ;
for eighteen years, according to
Judge. "And I still believe, with all
due respect to the committee who wait
ed on me in Tombstone." said Judg;
Ixckwood. "that it is well to make the
bootlegger work o nihe road and if wc
have to give him extra credit for doing
it. a!! right. It is a good thing. I le
lieve. to have a little prod behind a
convict, and a little bait ahead." ' h
contintied. Lockwocd Wants Clean-Up
In speaking of failing to give a prom
ise to the committee to always impose
the maximum penalty on a bootlegger.
J'idge I.ockwood declared he could not.
did rot and will not promise to give
the same penalty, the severest always,
to evety bootlegger, for the reasons,
he explained, that circumstances al
tered cases. He said, however, he-was
in favor of severe penalties, bat that
severity of penally does not alwavs
stop crime.
The judge asked Rev. Melnoile Mil
ler if he was not correct when :e said
authorities acre-id that severity of pen
alty did not always stop crin-e. and
the Kev. Miller said he was corre-t.
"Hut if there is anything I car. do lo
stop boot legging. I'll Ite'glad to do it."
said the jurlge. "But until the niajort
y of citizens are willing to turn n the
Sootlegger. whiskey will !e sold." he
declared.
Detectives Are Expensive
"ft is just like your membership
committee says." declared Judgrf Lock
wood, "they go lo your citizens and
ak them if they are in favor of a
clean-up. and they say: "Oh. yes. In
in favor of a clean-up. But say. don't
don't put mv name on that paper.'"
The hoard of supervisors con In em
ploy enough deputy sheriffs to police
all roads into the county and r.p ev
ery l it of liquor from coming in. he
said, but it would cost SiiO.tiAu to $.".
noo a year to do it. and the taxpayers
would not stand it. And it the loard
of supervisors did it they would be out
of a job after the next election, he said.
Hirhig detectives is a good way to
stamp out bootlegging for awhil? and
a sure way to catch them, but it is
costly, the judge said.
"There Is only one way to slop
drinking at the soldier camp." .iid the
judge, "and the citizens wouldn't stand
for it."
Rev. W. C. Brewer asked Judge
Ijockwood If juries were often corrupt,
and how juries are selected. H ex
plained that under the old way a jury
could lie "packed" for or againsr con
viction, but that they never were, jiiid
that under the new way of selecting a
jury it is impossible to pack one.
Board of Pardons Criticiz-1
The judge said that the accusation
against the sheriifs office of improper
jury selection was unjust. Judge Lock-
wood said that he had every reason to
IxMicve Sheriff Wheeler had ajways
wanted to enforce every law to the let
ter, and that he had always conscien
tiously tried to do it. t '
Sam Yamcll sked if the jud'ie
couldn't do something to the sheriff if
he let a man out of jail before he had
sfrvtd his scv.i.'i.cf. The j;.lj;c Pi
plained that he rmilil not. thr.t it wa
not in his power, and that it wa not.
as Yarnell asked, a contempt of coui't.
"If charges wer? made again t ihe
sheriff for breaking the law by lettin't
a prisoner out before time I could try
him," he explained, "but tr.oi is ihe
only way I have a right to get at him."
Resolutions condemning the luiard
of pardons were adopted an I ordeied
sent to the press, to the governor and
to the board of ardons. for the action
taken in the case of "one man named
French, of Bisbee."
French Case Reviewed
. Judge Lockwood :iid he sentence.l
French with fifty others who served
six months in jail, and that they were
released by agreement of the sheriff's
office, the judge and the co'inty attor
ney, provided they would plead suilty
to a second charge and .;e; suspend?:!
sentences. This is what French did.
according to the judge. He said French
violated the suspended sentence and
was convicted and that be served only
a month and was pardone.I.
arnell was nominated for president
of the Citi7ens" Welfare I.aijue if
Douglas, which Is bein-? orsani'.ed.
Kev. Mr. Miller objected -ind slid they
had better have a membership before
they elected officers. Yarnell said it
was a good idea, and he election of
officers was postponed.
Rev. Mr. Miller Speaks
Rev. Mr. Miller told about some
town in Vermont going wet by a his
majority and at each succeeding elec
tion the wet vote got smaller and
smaller until the town went dry. He
also told alHiut some strong and -prohibitionist
in Omaha. Neb., coming in
to the dry camp, and about a men in
another part of the state doing ;ha
same, and that a big Milwaukee ami
did the same and that a strong anti in
Tennessee turned dry and anoth?
man somewhere else "named Rosewai
er or Rosebud or Rose-something. I've
forgotten." doing likewise.
These Instances went to prove, said
Rev. Mr. Miller, that education is the
thing. He advocated regular prohibi
tion meetings in Doirglas to educate
the people until they favored enforce
ment of the prohibition law.
More Committees Appointed
' His talk led to the appointment of
himself. J. E. Murphy and George X.
Uoark as a progiam committee to ar
range for prohibition readings, and
speeches, and sorgs at the next clean
up meeting which will be In two weeks.
Rev. Mr. Brewer said all present
should he given an opportunity to sign
up for membership in the new organi
zation, but the crowd adjourned lefore
this was done. Some of them, how
ever, turned in their names to S. F.
Eraser, the secretary. Au'.ong them
was Mayor Adamson.
" Yarnell said the league should see
that a law was made to make lmotleg
gers work on the rond and another one
passed by which cars carrying liquor
could be confiscated. Judge Lockwood
said he was of the opinion that con
stitutional amendments would he ne
cessary to bring nlxmt either.
- J. Hanson. Tom Askins and G. H.
Hirst were appointed as additional
members of the membership committee.
