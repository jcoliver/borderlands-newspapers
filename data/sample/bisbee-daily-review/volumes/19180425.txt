is neediess to say that the depart-

patriotic stand and it is hepei that
all trade unionists everywLtia. will
follow the advice of Mr: xio.iipeis.
His patriotic labor policy in these
trying war days Is doing nio:-e to
better industrial relations between

town where the battle still is raging, j
Trouble has been brewing in the
Somme sector for days, the enemy
maintaining a bombardment of more j
or less intensity over a wide area, i
Throughout yesterday morning the
bombardment was greatly increased.
Pound Merville Sector
On the northern battle front the Ger
man artillery pounded the entente al
lied positions yesterday, especially in
the Robecq and Merville sector, and
this morning an intense bombardment
was put down in the British positions
An attack above Albert came, after
a half-hour bombardment by the en
emy. As the- German infantry left
their trenches the British deluged
them with rifle and machine gun fire
and forced a hasty retreat.
A British operation yesterday over
a 2000 yard front in the Ricze Du Vin
age sector was a complete success and
greatly improved the defending lines.
A nasty salient about 1500 yards wide
and about the same depth had bulged
into the British territory just north of
Rieze Du Vinage. By their attack the
British drove the enemy from this sali
ent and straightened their line.
Attack South of Somme
Hard fighting developed this morn
ing on the southern battle front, the
enemy attacking south of the Somme,
along the' line of Villers-Bretonneux.
Hangard En Santerre, Hailles and
Castle, Early developments indicated
that th8 eGrmans were trying only for
limited objectives.
On the British sector, Villers-Rre-tonneux,
which tiestles on a rldee
overlooking the long stretch of the
Somme valley, was the storm center
an dhere the enemy fo rthe first time
since the war began had tanks in ac
tion. Three of these engines of war
accompanied the storming infantry,
which at latert reports had battled
forward into the eastern outskirts of
the town, where severe fighting fiok
place.
From the French sector came word,
that the Germans had made very sliaht
progress.
The assault was preceded by a
heavy bombardment t Villent-Rrj-tonneux.
At the conclusion of this
preparation the Germans urged for
ward along the whole British front
.south of the Somme. althouch .It
seemed evident that they had Viller-i-nretonneux
as their ultimate goal be
cause of its dominating position.
Assault Thrown Back
The first attack was thrown back,
but the enemy Imnvdl-itelv came
forward again, and this time met with
more success. In the face of heavy
machine gun and rifle fire the Ger
mans pushed on, toward the town, the
three tanks leading. The British gave
way slightly, and the enemy got n
footing in the eastern fringe of the
town.

MARY'S ANKLE fS
WONDERFUL SIGHT
Mary's ankle! Ah, it was diviue.
The Venus de Medici had no shaplier
. .member. White as snow, pink toes
curves like a sculptured dream But
wait! It is not the ankle, but the
show of which this review would deal.
The . show was up to the ankle no,
not quite; this newspaper man takes
that back but almost; nearly; close
up.
Parr comedies are the only shows
" anyway. Such a vehicle carries the
class, the fun, th pathos; everything

New York cast, and theatergoers from
all over the east ana norm wno sai
ihi o.irtionf-A at the Oroheum last
night appreciated it to the uttermost.
Who was supposea to oe me siar:
This critic does not know. There was
no star. Every player in the cast from
Clementine, the maid, and the stew
ipi th hoaL tn the hero and the
rich uncle, was a star. Mary herself
was a star, a beautiful star, and
she had a foot white enough to
shine along the track of the milky
way and shapely enough to walk
on a Stardust path. Chub was a star,
in his way; and so was the lawyer
friend, the much harrsssed Stokeu.
The aunt was 'a star, and so was Cle
mentine's sick mother.
Three acts to this farce and Mary s
ankle adorned every one of . them.
Three young bachelors, doctor, lawyer,
merchant-chief, all broke, holding
forth, in the doctor's rooms, which he
held by virtue of curing his sick
landlady of a thousand imaginary ills.
Chubbs' emits the glittering idea of
having the doctor send a wedding

of garnering valuable wedding pres
ents which the poverty stricken trie
may pawn. And they were some
."pawners" they pawned the land
lady's parrot, Pollyanna (and Polly
anna was a star, too.)
Well, they selected the name of
Mary Jane Smith, from the tethone
directory to go on that, wedding in
vitation, and the real Mary Jane Smith
was carried up to the doctor's office
with a sprained ankle. Complications
set in to the plot, not the ankle,
and the rich uncle (say, he was really
the star of that show, but Mary was
. very, very pretty, and her ankle was
in a class by itself), appeared upon
the scene and everything stayed
beautifully mixed and deliciously fun
ny clear to the last spasm of laughter.
A great little show, greatly played,
and a barrel or fun all the way. Man-

Mrs. Siinms. Mrs. C. S. Thompson

PERSHING CALLS FOR
AMERICAN MINING MEN
General Pershing has sent a special
request to the army department - urg
ing that all recruiting men enlist as
trany American miners for duty in
France as possible. Men for this work
ar? particularly required at this time
and those eligible' to enlist in this
branch cannot serve the country bet
ter than to join at once.
Corporal Fred A. Murphy is here
with headquarters at the Y. M. C. A.
securing enlistments in this branch as
well as other departments of the
army. He is only permitted to take
men from 18 to 21 years of age and
from 31 to 41 years.
The 27th Engineers" National army
is the organization to which men en
fisting as miners will be assigned.
This outfit is stationed at Camp
Meade, Md. When '.completed this
unit will comprise 1,500 men, or six
companies of 250 men each. The en
gineering corps is being made up of
picked men, miners chosen for their
skill and strength. While most of
the work will be -underground the
mining regiment -will be trained to

THE SHIP OF DOUBT ,
AT ORPHEUM TODAY
All is not pleasure in the pictures. !
If you think there are no hardships to
endure ask Claire McDowell and Monte
Blue, who have just finished work on
the Triangle story of the sea. "The
Ship of Doom" at the Orpheum Thea
ter today. The script calls for two. as
castaways on a lonely island, and to
add to reality Director Gittens made
them play the part barefooted. The
location was in the Santa oMnica
mountains and was well covered with
burs and brush. As a result Miss Mc
Dowell cut and bruised her feet so j
badly that she could not get her snoes
on for several days. Blue proved
tovigher, tut declared it was no sport
LIGHTLESS NIGHTS
ARE DISCONTINUED
Issuance of an order by the national
fuel administrator, Dr. Garfield, has
suspended the exibting 'lightless night'
orders throughout the United States
until nest September 1, according to
information reaching Bisbee yester
day. The effect of the order will be
that in this district Sunday and Thurs
day will no longer become lightless
nights until September.
The order has been issued "at the
request ot the national Liberty loan
committee and further on account of
the daylight saving movement," says
the word received here, and becomes
effective tonight.
For the past several months, two
nights each week have been recog
nized throughout the country as 'light
less nights,' when no electric lights
other than were absolutely necessary
for business were to have been burned.
This' order prohibited the illumina
tion of display signs, store fronts, dis
play windows and other advertising
effects.
President Samuel Gompers of the
American Federation of Labor to Pres
ident McCoy, of the Tucson trades
i council, declaring the attempt to in
j cite the proposed strike was not only
"violative of the laws oi national una
international unions,', but "is repug
nant to the rights and inteersts of
the workers themselves."
Gompers also declared that the at
tempt to incite a strike was "danger
ously prejudicial to the lives of our
industry. Perhaps his aim in life is
merely to spend your money.
If you. are a poor man and have a
son who is industrious who is work
ing hard to better himself, you will
like this picture because it shows that
he has a chance especially in Uncle
Sam's army, which, in a measure is a
leveler of human beings.
George Walsh shows what an ener
getic American youth can do in the
ranks of the new army, and he shows
also how hard an industrious young
fellow can work and enjoy it. George
does some hair-raising stunts that will
thrill even an Ironworker who does
dangerous stunts himself.
SHIRLEY KAYE, EAGLE
THEAER BILL TODAY
Of all the countless stars and near
stars who have appeared In the mo
tion pictures, there is ,none on whom
the unanimous approval of camera
men rests so markedly as on Clara
Kimball Young. Possessed of a set
of classic feature which are a delight
to the beholder. Miss Young's crown
ing blessing is. however, her com
plexion "her skin photographs like
ivory, with its soft high-lights and
sheeus," as one expert camera man put
!t recently.
That is one of the reasons why you
will find, in every town and hamlet
in America, and even so far off the
beaten track as China and Japan,
countless lithographs and newspaper
cuts of Clara Kimball Young, the cam
era's best friend. It may be stated,
without fear of successful contradic
tion, that the photographs of no other
actress have been so widely displayed
throughout the entire world.
Miss Young will appeal in one of
her. masterful productions, Shirley
Kaye, at the Eagle theater today and
Friday.

Hats Off to the Teachers
of Arizona
, Tuscon Star: The teachers of Arizona
showed a courageous spirit and a loyal de
votion to principle' when they, assembled
as the Arizona Teachers Association, in an
nual convention, elected as their president
and leader the man who Hunt refused to
grant a public hearing of his case after the
board of trustees of the Flagstaff Normal
' School, appointed by the governor, had dis
charged him. The charges against this man
Dr. R. H. Blome were indefinite
'charges of pro-Germanism, but they were
not any more specific or material, or real
than the governor's reason for refusing to
grant the humiliated educator a. hearing. It '
is an admission that the same element
(whose actual existence we doubt) to
which the board of trustees, a state board,
knuckled when they discharged Blome,
prevents the governor from giving him the
elemental justice of a hearing at Flagstaff.
The'action of the teachers, the rank and
is fresh evidence that those who would
comprehend the educational institutions of
the state within any party's political ma
chinery, must contend wth the Swiss
Guard, the teachers, who stand guard over
the temples of learning.
The action of the teachers was courage
ous. They have braved reprisals by local
politicians who take orders and largess
from higher up. But separate, intimately
concerned though they are, the Action
-which they took in convention but repre
sents the sentiment of a large majority of
the people of the state. It cralified the issue ,
in the case.
We have heard it said that, whatever
the merits of the case of Dr. Blome, or its
demerit.3, so strong is the political antagon
ism to Hunt that he would have been ac
cused in any event of meddling with the af
fairs of the educational institution ; in other
words, whatever Hunt might have done
would have been criticized by his political
opponents. There is an undeniably lively
opposition, ah opposition that overlooks no
strategical opportunity, but the stand of
the rank and file of the teachers of the State
has lifted the.BIome case to a level high out
of the mire of politics, and it is no longer
possible for the governor arid his Flagstaff
board to ignore public feeling in the matter.
What the teachers did was to demand
of the governor in the name of fair-dealing
and principle, the hearing which Dr. Blome
has asked; and to declare that the charges,
so-called, against Blome were of a charac
ter to deny the justice of the Flagstaff
board's action. Simple justice cannot ac
cept less..
There can be no doubt that the Ger
mans suffered their severest losses of the
war for any singlet day in their vain attack
in massed waves Upon Givenchy. That was
last Thursday, and as -a result of the dread
ful slaughter oFthe British gunfire there
has been no infantry actions since that
time. In fact, as a direct result of that dis
astrous attack, it -is declared that Gen.'
Ludendorff, the real head of the German
armies, has ordered that no more massed
attacks be made, as they are too costly. A
week of inaction on the northern front of
course gives the British plenty of time to
bring up reserve troops and strengthen
their Iine3. It would seem that the German
has failed in his northern drive, even as he
failed on the Somme before Amiens. Gen.
Fcch's strategy of holding his lines with the
least number of troops possible and hoard
ing his reserved has been upheld by the re
sults. But that' either the Germans or the
allies will dig in and resort again to trench
warfare upon the present fighting line's is
not to be considered for a moment. An of
fensive or a counter stroke may be ex
pected any day. Certainly another great
German effort may be looked for, cither
north or south of Arras and the famous
Vimy ridge, in the very near future. The
facts are, the British army has been badly
mauled and dangerous salients driven deep
into its lines, and the German hordes have
been badly punish'ed in their great exer
tions for a decision. In 'the meantime
America is bending every effort to place
an army in France before the end of the
year that will really count for something
in turning the scale. Every day of the
sweet, golden summer time that parses
brings the American menace nearer to the
throat of the blonde beast, and Germany is
beginning to realize this full well. She must
make haste forward or turn back, back,
clear to the grim shadow of the Iron Gate
of Brandenburg, which is the pride of
Berlin.
And now the Germans, instigators and
first users of poison gas on the battlefield,
signify that they are willing to have this
terrible weapon eliminated from the war.
There is a reason. There's always a reason
for what the German does in war, and it is
always a reason for the German. In the
first place, the allies have developed gases
greater in volume and more deadly than
the German brand, for the reason that the
allies have greater fields of raw products
from which to develop these fumes. Again,
rubber, an imperative necessity fon effec
tive gas masks, is deadly scarce in Ger
many. Again still, the winds of Picardy
and Flanders, so vital to a successful gas at
tack, blow three-fourths of the time from
the west to the east. Hence the allies have
a three to one advantage in using gas. Of
course Germany wishes, now that the poi
son cup is pressed to her own lips, to elim
inate this poison from the deadly game of
war. And in the matter of air raids tipon
towns and cities, the British, while not say
ing much about.it, have exacted full toll
for the London raids. And now the Ger
man wishes an agreement t6 stop air raids
upon defenseless communities. He would
kill first and then cry mercy, this German.
Tis his nature, his-habit and his training
ever since Attilla the Hun was checked at
Chalons. But this German must drink the
dregs from his own cup before it is placed
again upon the table. ' Thus may he hesi
tate long before he mixes again such a ter
rible' brewage.
A bad beginning often makes a good
ending. The new board of regents of the
state university started out with stormy
sessions and acrimonious debates over mat
ters that should never even have been dis
cussed or considered for the good of the
institution. But these regents came
through clean the other day when hey re
tained President Von Klein-Smid in his
place at an increased salary. Some of the
Hunt faction had started out to "get" Von
KleinSmid just because he is too big a man
to play petty politics with them. That
they changed their mind is to their credit
at least. - The university president is the
type of man Arizona, the young and new
state, needs to help build her future greatness.
Now that Croaff has called a state wide,
strike it is Gov. "Hunt's next move. How
does he stand on thij proposition? The
wobblies want to know. And so do the
men and women of Arizona who are op
posed to wobblyism. And Washington,
D. C, would also like to know.
LIBERTY BOND HONOR ROLL
HELPING HALT HUN HORDES
It is well' that Croaff and the other ex
treme radicals in charge of the organization
of the state federation have thrown off
their mask in time. They might have done
much harm. Posing as f riends and leaders
of union labor they at heart have wobbly
leanings and know only wobbly tactics. For
them there is no middle ground to happi
ness and prosperity for all classes within
the state. They know only the rule or ruin
policy. A radical leader of any -cause does
that cause more harm than good in the
long run. Croaff has fretted and fumed
over the fancied wrongs against labpr until
he has become a wild man. He lacks the ,
poise and patience and broadmindedness
necessary for every leader of men, he ha3
run a short course to a sharp finish. He
has clashed with Gompers within a few
months of assuming charge in Arizona
union labor affairs. ' .Only the wobblies
and a few of the extreme radicals have
shown any disposition to follow him in thi3
last frenzied and frothing charge against
the towers and homes of society at large
and the dome at Washington in particular.
It has been proved in both England and
America in this war that union labor gen
erally is loyal and patriotic and is in the
great fight for Democracy to a finish.
There are Croaffs and McCluskeys in the
organization, but thank goodness, they are
in the great minority, else would we soon
see a peace dictated by the tyrant of
Berlin.
Railroad men of the Warren Dis
trict, employes ot the El faso c
Souinwesiern systems, have establish
ed a record that ts hard to equal in the
third Liberty 4oan bond drive. With
more than seventy employes of the
company lqcally suDscnoing tor bonds,
the offices have recorded about 95 per
cent. The remaining few who have
not purchased bonds nave been forced
to decline, one because of sickness at
Dome, and ot tiers because of their
heavy-subscriptions to the past Issues.
The list of purchasers is included at
the lead of tue Honor Roll for today.
It is a list of which the local rail
roaders may well be proud, as it rep
resents a response to the call of the
country unequalled by any organiza
tion ot the district. Total suoscrtp
tions ot the railroaders amounted on
this occasion to $5,250.
The intensive drive in this district
yesterday continued with good results.
Committees were calling on Beveral
residents' yesterday afternoon who
hare heretofore refused to purchase
bonds. One of these committees re
ported that In every Instance where
the second call was made, at least f 100
in bonds was sold and that In some
Instances as high as $500 was sold. In
a Montenegrin boarding house one
committeeman secured the subscrip
tions of upward of fifteen foreigners
working in the mines of the district.
Reports to date indicate that this
district will have gone well over the
top before the Liberty Day celebration
Friday, and that the occasion can be
made a dual demonstration in all prob
abilities. Committees working in the
residence districts have reported dur
ing the past two days continued good
results in the rounding up of the final
residents and in the making of second
or return calls.
Following is another list of Warren
District icsidents who have won places
on the honor roll by purchasing bonds.
the first names in the list represent
those of the El Paso & Southwestern
company:

everyone, especial efforts have been
exerted by each committeeman and
all connected with the Liberty bond
drive. ; ..
Two Good Speakers'
In each of the programs 'on: patri
otic address' which is promised to stir
the spirit of every rest-lent of the
district, has been arranged, in the
first program. Rev. J. A. Krischbaum
will speak. His work hs well known
In the district, and his patriotic ap
peals of the past have besn well at
tended. For the second program, S.
R. B. Von KlienSmid, president of
the University of Arizona, at Tucson,
has teen assured. Dr. Von KleinSmid
has attained a reputation throughedt
the southwest for the character of his
addresses, and he will be well worth
,'oearine: on this occasion.
Participation in the parade and pro
grams of the company of 35th infantry
and of the high school cadet com
panies will lend the day the martial
effect without which it would hardly
be complete. The Inclusion of the
school children will lnure an added
injection of spirit to the affair, and
the appearance of the city officers will
lend to the occasion the official air.
Especial attention is directed by the
committeemen to the program and the
lines and formation of march. It is
requested that all participating in the
demonstration and joining in the par
ade clip the program from the paper
and have it at hand when the order
xf formation is given. In this manner
each person will know exactly where
to go and how to tall into the parade,
and a minimum of con 'usibn or
trouble will be assured, declare committeemen.
War Summary
(By Review Leased Y."re)
After three weeks prepaution in .the
Somme, during which time they
launched an offensive in Flanders, the"!
Germans have resumed hammering at
the front door of Amiens. For days
there has been heavy artillery firing
along the northern sectors of the
Somme salient and finally the German
infantry began their attempts to ad
vance on the line passlnge- Villers
Bretonneux, Hangard, Hailles and
Castel. v
The first attacks were repulsed but
subsequent attacks centered about
Villers-Bretonneux, have caused a
British withdrawal from this village;
according to a report from Field Mar
shal Haig. This marks a German gain
of about a mile.
Gentian Report Silent
Villers-Brettuneux. about 11 milo3 1
direc"tly east of Amiens, is on the
northern end or the latest fighting
front. It is situated between tho
Somme and Luce rivers, and while it
is flanked on the south by low lying
gTound it Is backed by rolling hills
to the west and northwest.
The lighting on the rest of the front
where the Germans have resumed
their drive toward tho allied bass of
supplies in Northern France, lias not.
so far as known, resulted in any no-1
table retirement on the part of the
allies.
The German official report issued
on Wednesday was silent as to events
In this sector of the front.
An attack on this particular part of
the line in the Somme region ha teen
expected and it is probable that prep j
a rations to meet it had bf'en ma.
The British lines hold firm in th'a
region during the last days of the ;
Initial drive while the Germans were !
able to forge ahead further south un-j
tl they reached the village of Castel,;
about three miles from the railroad
running to Parts from Amiens. He-:
cently a French counter offensive at 1
Castel won bock considerable ground
and It was evident that unless the line ;
further north could be advanced mate
rtally the Germans had little chance
to make important gains in their oper-
ations to the south of Amiens.
This new drive has been mad" at ;
the same time that another blow has ,
been struck at the British and French
lines northwest of Ypres. savae
fighting is reported at various points ;
along the line from Bailleul to Mer-1
vllle, and Berlin claims that .heights I
to the northeast of llailleucl have been
stormed.
On the Trout in France, with Iho
exception of the Sotunie salient, there
has been little llt;litiiiK of an unusual
nature.

A' little miss of about five years old
went into the Phelps-Dodge store on
Tuesday afternoon and went up to the
toy department and told Mr. Hooper

showed her a number of dolls and
she picked out one that seemed to
suit her better than all the rest, and
she had to Id him that she would tak-e
that one. She as just about to hand
it back to him to be wrapped up when
she saw stamped on the back of the
doll. "Made In Germany." I do not
want that doll at all; I would not have
it as a gift: if you have not got any
nice dolls made In the United States
I do not want any." Tossing her lit
tle flaxen head up in ' the air she
wakled out of the store. Hooper now
is going to hire some dressmakers and
dress the dolls over and take (T the
German sfamp. He will have too if
he expects to sell them to any of the

WHY NOT HERE?;
"Tucson's golf plovers have evinced
the right spirit InMnstilling a littl"
pat riot ism into thoir daily gameA."
said Tenney Williams. "Heretofore
goif balls have been put up as prizei
for the friendly match games that
are played on the local country club
links every afternoon. Now that the
thrilt stamp campaign is in full swinz
the 23-cSnt savings stamps and baby
bonds are put up as trophies. "A few
weeks ago many of the golfers had
from $50 to $100 worth of golf balls
in their lockers, which they might use
up in the next two or three years.
Now there U a scarcity of golf balls
and the thrift stamps have taken their
place." The idea originated lth Dr.
Jere Metzger, one of the most enthu
siastic of the local golf players, and
he has promised the Pima county war
