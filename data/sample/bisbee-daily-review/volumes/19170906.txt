Federation of Labor, late today pledg
ed the support of organized labor to
the government In its prosecution of
the war, assailed peace propagandists
and denounced the lutile activities of
those who would split labor's rati k 9

the arguments of those who declare !
the working masses want peace and
challenged pro-German socialists to;
step forth into the open and match i
their disloyalty against labor's loyal-j

Russians Continue Flight.
While the Russians continue their
flight before the Germans in the region
of Riga, the1 Italians, after a few days
of comparative idleness, again have
started their great offensive against
the Austrians on the Bainsizza pla
teau and to the northeast of Gorizia.
Attack and Counter.
In the south however the Austrians
at one place momentarily forced the
Italians to cede territory. A counter
attack by the Italians not alone re
trieved the lost position, but resulted
in the capture of more than 400 pris
oners. Fighting Near Gorizia
On the Bainsizza plateau northeast
of Gorizia the Italians have made fur
ther gains, capturing an important
Austrian position near Ocroglo. No
confirmation is at hand of the report
ed capture by the Italians of Monte
San Gabrlele. the last dominating po
sition held by the Austrians north of
Gorizia. Nearly 1.700 men have been
captured by the Italians in the fighting
in the Gorizia sector.
Airmen Over Pola.
Again the Italians have sent their
airmen over Pola, the Austrian naval
base In the Adriatic, dropping bombs,
the explosions of which have added
materially to the damage done In pre

Aa River Crossed.
In the region of Riga the Russians
are retiring eastward and northeast,

GLOBE, Ariz., Sept. 5. Special
Agent Claude McCaleb of the de

United States Marshal Haines to
day raided the headquarters of the
Industrial Workers of the World
at Miami, seizing all records of
the organization. No arrests were
made but two officials were
brought to Globe and questioned.
Officials refused to make any
statement regarding the raid.
The federal officers were ac
companied by Lieutenant-Colonet
George White, commanding the
cavalry new stationed here and
another army officer. The troops
did not participate in the raid.
Among many articles seized by
the authorities in the raid on I.
W. W. headquarters were a num

published in New. York, several
thousand stickers bearing the in
scription "bum work; bum work;"
and an enlarged photograph of
former Governor George W. P.
Hunt, surrounded by a number of
I. W. W. members.. The photo
graphs were taken in front of an
I. W. W. gathering place in this
city.
WASHINGTON, Sept 5. The
government today took drastic
steps to quell the anti-war pro
paganda conducted in the name of
the Industrial Workers of the
world, the Socialist party and
other organizations throughout
the United States.
Attorney General's Order.
Under torders of Attorney Gen
eral Gregory, United States mar
shals in many towns and cities
descended upon local headquart
ers of the Industrial Workers of
the Wbrld, seized correspondence
and other documents and in some
Instances, arrested officials of the
organizations. The arrest at Chi
cago of William D. Heywood. na
tional secretary of the Industrial
Workers of the World, was a con
spicuous example.
Socialists In Net.
In Chicago federal agents took
possession of the national head
quarters of the Socialist party and
a warrant authorizing the seizure
of its documents was served up
on its counsel
Documents Seized.
The seizure of documents was
carried 'out in accordance with a
plan perfected here by William C.
Fitts, assistant attorney general,
working under the direction of the
attorney general. A statement is
sued by the department of justice
announced that the seizure of
papers was niadw in connection
with a federal grand jury Investi
gation of the Industrial Workers
of the World now proceeding at
Chicago.
On Eve of Report
The department's action was
taken on the eve of a report to
President Wilson by Chief Justice
Covington of the supreme court
of the District of Columbia, wW
was designated recently by tho
president to investigate the laDor
situation in the west. Judge Cov
ington has completed his investi
gation which lasted several weeks
and took him to the Pacific coast,
and probably will report personal
ly to President Wilson tomorrow.
Might Be Related.
Whether the concerted action
of marshals throughout the coun
try was in any ay, related to
Judge Covington's investigation
was not disclosed. It was known,
however, that Judge Covington
made a special study of activities
of the Industrial Workers of the
World. It was shortly after he
reached the northwest tha 27 lead
ers of the organization were ar
rested by Idaho national guards
men, the day before the time set
for a general strike in Washing
ton. Oregon, Montana and Idaho.
The charge against leaders of
the 'organization was not made
public.
Investigation Just Begun.
It was intimated that the investi
gation had only begun. Indica
tions are that federal grand juries
in other cities will be called up
on also to investigate the case of
the organization.
Activities Watched.
For many weeks past the acti
vities of the Industrial Workers
of the World leaders have been
under close scrutiny of the de
partment's bureau of investigation.
Scores of field workers, chiefly
in the vest and middle west have
devoted their undivided attention
to alleged attempts on the part
of the leaders to emtarass the
government In the conduct of the
war by strikes and other disturb
ances called in the name of labor.
These activities have never bern
regarded here as a labor move
ment. They have been held to the
political, and in some instances,
conducted with a view solely to
binder and hamper rne govern
ment in exercising the full
strength in carrying on the war.
Austrians Involved .
Charges of many complexions
have been received by the depart
ment in connection with the
organization's activities. Recently
it was charged that included in
the ranks of the Industrial Work
ers t)f the World were many Aus
trian who have been active in
stirring up ' strife intended to
hamper American Industries, do
ing work handled by Germans be
fore the United States declared a
state of war with Germany.
Charges Not Proved.
Continued investigation has
failed, it is understood, to connect
these activities with German
money. The department has de
termined the principal reservoirs
of German funds in this country
and. it is reported, has not con
nected them with recent disorders
in the west and northwest.
Local United States attorneys
have reported many Instances or
a suspicious nature in connection
with alleged labor troubles, how
ever, and these have been the sub
ject of departmental investigation.
Documents By Thousands.
As a result of the country-wide
seizure of the organization's
papers, the department of justice
tonight finds itself in possession
of documents by the thousand,
many of which have submitted to
the grand juries as a basis of an
investigation to determine wheth
er leaders can be prosecuted.
May Prosecute.
Prosecution' may be begun und
er several laws, chiefly the espion
age act. covering the utterance
of treasonable and seditious state
ments, and the food control law.
Prosecution under the latter law
could be conducted in instances
where it was shown that attempts
were being made, by conspiracy
or otherwise, to impede the inter
state movements of foodstuffs and
other commodities, controlled by
the government and needed for
the successful prosectuion of the
war.
WEST COMBED FOR I. W. W.
(By Review Leased Wire).
SAN FRANCISCO. Sept. 5. A vig
orous blow against the activities nf
the Industrial Workers of the World
throughout the west and northwest
was delivered today by the govern
ment. Simultaneous raids on headquarters
of the I. W. W. conducted in all princi
pal cities of the Pacific coast and in
terior states by United States marsh
als and deputies on order of the de
partment of justice netted a great
mass of literature, records and docu
ments. In no case was there any re
sistance. Federal officials here declared that
this literature was sought by the gov
ernment as evidence tending to con
nect I. W. W. leadeis with the German
war office. The raids were conducted
under authority tof the espionage act.
All of the matter confiscated was
taken for examination by United
States district attorneys who will re
port to the department at Washington.

REVIEW LOSES GOOD
REPORTER WHILE IRE
"Chet" Johnson, "Sulphide"
in a Jungle of "Bromide,"
Leaves Paper and Joins the
First Arizona Infantry.
It is a rare thing that newspaper
people become prolific in words of
commendation of a fellow worker. By
most reporters, it is considered uneth
ical to "talk about your own staff.
In this case, however, the subect has
left the Review; he has joined the
First Arizona, quitting a good "ob
where he was liked and where his
work stood for itself. One of his fel
low workers, in consequence, can not
withhold a few words in appreciation
of "Chef Johnson.
Johnson, better known as plain
"Chet," came to Cochise county last
year. He worked- for Major George
H. Kelly on the Douglas International
for several months and from the
Smelter City moved to Bisbee on
January 1. Since that time be has
been the life and the light of the
"force
There is so much of the hum-drum;
so much that is sordid, in a reporter's
life, and so much, that appeals to the
layman and is merely a matter ot
work to the staff or desk man, that a
little life, a little light and a sunny
disposition lift the day's events above
mere mechanics. Johnson was a bun
die of such medicine.
For a case of the blues, for that
tired feeling when the paper was near
ly on press, and when everyone was
fagged and ready for "thirty," there
was always a cheerful word, a quip ap
plied with vigor, humor and with no
malice from Johnson. He laughed
away his own cares and banished his
friends' woes at the same time.
Friends, Johnson had in plenty. He
had been in Bisbee a brief nine
months, but it is doubtful if there was
ever another reporter who has lived
and worked in the Warren district
such a short time who has so many
good friends. His personality is one
which is remembered and his work,
from a purely professional standpoint,
can bo commended to any man in any
field.
"diet" has gone into the army. He
will take his personality with him and
will enliven many a dreary day of
work during the training this year.
He wil! be a bright spot in any com
pany.
"Chet" Johnson is not a wonder. He
is average. But he is thoroughly sin
cere, honest, conscientious, bright and
he is "true blue." If suoh requisites
go to make up a soldier he will make
one who will assay one hundred per
cent, and twenty-four carets fine.
"So Good Luck, Chet," from the en
tire force.
Mexican Dollars
Melted for Their
Value in Bullion
(Bv Review Leasea WireJ
NEW YORK, Sept. 5. Fifty thous
and Mexican dollars, lying in sacks
on the floor of a dealer here in silver
bullion were one of the evidences to
day of the rapidly mounting proce of
tar silver, which has now reached the
record breaking figure of 95 cents an
ounce. A year ago it was selling at
S8 cents an ounce.
The Mexican money was to be con
verted into bull'o nand represented, it
as said but a small fraction of sil
or surrency being brought out of
viexico. despite measures by the Mex
ican government to prevent its money
from being drained off by the attrac
tion of high bullion prices in this
country.
The Mexican silver dollar for years
valued at about 50 cents, is now wotb
n the neighborhood of 75 cents at pre
vailing bar silver prices. The rise
in value of the metal has raised the
question as to weetiier a similar at-Taction-
will come to bear on Ameri
can silver dollars tempting owners to
melt and sell them as bullion. There
will be no danger of this, it was said,
'cday by silver authorities, until bar
silver climbs to $1.29 an ounce.
The hij;h price of silver is attribut
ed here to both an increased demand
"nd decreased production.

Prominent Merchants Declare
that Working Hours Here
Eliminate Need for Business
Houses Being Open at
Night
"There is no good reason for any
merchant in the Warren district desir
ing to keep his store open after 6
o'clock any evening," said a promi
nent Bisbee business man yesterday,
in speaking of the arrangement, en
dorsed by nearly every man in the
community, which would cause every
business house to close at 6 o'clock
every night In the week and all day
Sunday.
"There are some communities in
the country," he continued, "which
should have, stores open after 6
o'colck on one night a week. In such
communities this night is usually Sat
urday and it is really essential. In
t-e Warren district, however, the
hours of work do not make this neces
sary or even to be desired.
"Practically every merchant in the
Warren district is greatly in favor
of thj change and fiearly all have sign
ed the agreement. It is to be hoped
that every man will follow suit."
That the clerks and other store em
ployes will win out seems assured.
The merchants and business men are
behind the movement and are cooper
ating with the employes to the end
that their hours be shortened. The
campaign for the 6 o'clock closing will
be continued all this month.

"THE BOTTLE IMP"
IS CENTRAL PLAY
Robert Louis Stevenson's famous
Hawaiian story, "The Bottle Imp,"
forms the basis of the picture of that
name, in which Sessue Hayakawa
portrays the stellar part. Mr. Haya
kawa has already been seen on the
screen as a Japanese, Chinese and
Hindu, but this is the first time that
he has ever appeared as an Hawaiian.
The rtory of the "Bottle Imp" dea'n
with the adventures of a poor fisher
man who seeks a girl of royal blood
as his wife, but whose father strongly
protests. He manages to acquire pos
session of "the Bottle'1 which grants
every wish, but which, nevertheless,
has a terrible menace. How he final
ly succeeds in winning the girl he
loves in spite of the many obstacles
that confront him, is brought about in
a most thrillign and unique manner.
The setting of the story is pictur
esque Hawaii, and the Lasky company
actually sent the players there to
stage the production.

OFFICERS FOR
A bird's-eye view of this country today would show a panorama of countless
military and industrial activities.
K:re the smoke of a thousand stacks obscures the view of arsenal, steel and
iron works and innumerable factories.
There the sun's rays flash upon thousands of glittering bayonets and rise and
set ca many new and strange looking cities the mobilization camps of the
armies of the Republic, or gild the wings of svift aeroplanes gliding tc rnd
fro in bird-like flight over broad aviation fields.
The National Capitol would be seen, from which all these vast enterprises are
directed and co-ordinated, with hundreds of telephone lines radiating from it
to all parts of the country, and linking it to each military and industrial
center.
A veritable maze of other telephone pole lines, covering the whole country
with a net-work of wires, would be risible, connecting city, town, camp, forti
fication, navy yards, military headquarters, coast-guard stations, and light
houses. Everywhere busy groups of telephone workers would be disclosed erecting
poles end stringing wires to raeet new and extraordinary demands for service.
AH this telephone activity is but a part of the vast work the Bell System
is dchig.
Join us in thij patriotic service, by remembering that the more careful you
are to make only telephone caPs that are necessary ar.d to confine your ta'i3
as much as possible, to the less busy hours of the day, the better we can meet
the needs of the Nation.

GOMPERS AND WORLD PEACE.
(Atlanta Constitution.)
In a brief statement a few days ago Samuel Gompers,
venerable president of the American Federation of Labor
and the recognized spokesman of organized labor, makes
it plain that he and his followers are not easily to be
tricked by the kaiser, and that) he finds in the pope's
peace proposal "nothing that can be regarded as a foun
dation for permanent peace nothing that would insure
the world against a recurrence of the war."
There is, says Gompers, "only one basis for permanent
peace
either the abdication of kaiserdom to the democra
cies of the world, or else kaiserdom must be crushed
by the democracies of the world. Until this is ac
complished there can not and ought not to be a
peace.
That "kaiserdom" cannot be crushed nor peace enjoyed
until all elements of the citizenship of the democracies
get together and work together to the one end, must be
recognized as clearly by Mr. Gompers and organized la
bor as by President Wilson and his supporters. And the
bare fact that a leader of Mr. Gompers' -Bunding and in
fluence has taken the position on the recurrent so-called
"peace proposals" emanating directly from Berlin or
Rome, it matters not augurs well at a time when labor
dissatisfaction and agitation is bo general.
The great labor leader is right. There can be no
peace with the Germany of today.
Therefore, while everybody longs for peace above any
thing else in the world, it behooves us all laborers, cap
italists, manufacturers, consumers, farmers, miners,
democrats, republicans, socialists or whatnot to forget
our personal differences and our selfish desires, and all
pool our interests and every ounce of our energies in the
one great cause and to hasten the one great end.
PENSIONS OR SOLDIERS' INSURANCE.
(New York World.)
The Soldiers' Insurance pill introduced in both
branches of Congress yesterday indicates another great
change in the republic's military methods. It is -not a
change of principle, but a change of policy. As the se
lective draft brought the old principle of universal mili
tary service under a more just and ordered application,
so government life and casualty insurance for soldiers
brings the old pension principle under a fairer and more
scientific application.
By the terms of this bill the government will not buy
insurance from private companies; it will itself insure
It will collect the premiums from public taxes on a cal
culated mortality and casualty rate which makes the
cost of $1,000 of insurance about $8 a year. This is not
far above the actual cost of straight life insurance at age
thirty with the "loadings" for agency and other expenses
and for "levelling" up the premiums against the later
years of a higher mortality rate?
The government has lately doubled the pay of its sol
diers. It will add to that pay for Bervice abroad. It pro
vides in this insurance bill for savings by soldiers from
their pay each month for dependents where there are
dependents. It further provides allowances from the
public treasury to be added to these savings for depend
ents. On top of all comes this vast plan of insurance at
the public expense in a lump sum for the family in case
of death and for the soldier's support or compensation
in case of disability.
Thus the old order goes on changing. What the chief
industrial States are doing in insurance and compensa
tion of workers in peace, the Federal government now
proposes to do with its fighting men in w ar. No one
could know what the old pension system would cost as
applied in this war. But experience from the Civil War
teaches that the cost might swamp the country and that
then even justice would often be sacrificed to politics
and personal influence on a scandalous scale. Under this
plan the cost will be known as we go along. Even-handed
justice will he assured. Political and personal favor
will go for notMiig. There should be no doubt of its
adoption.
WHEAT AND BREAD.
The American farmer is to get around $2.20 a bushel j
for his wheat. That is enough. It is not so nruch as he ;
would like to get, but enough to give him a snug littie
war profit. It isn't necessary either to pity or envy the
farmer.
The wheat gambler is being eliminated by the closing
of the wheat pits, and by the active operations of the
federal food administrator, equipped with a limitless
"wad." Whatever manipulation there is will be done by
Uncle Sam In the interest of the nation.
Wheat, then, we may reasonably expect, will remain
comparatively cheap, and the price will remain fairly
steady. But what of that?
What the big majority of Americans the consumers -
want to know Is, "How will this reform affect us?" Which
means, how will it affect the price of bread?
So far as the public is concerned, the whole elaborate
business doesn't mean anything at all unless it gives us
cheaper bread. And just now there is no assurance that
it will do so. Most bakers are quite sure that it will be
impossible to sell the all loaf again for a nickel, or to
sell a bigger loaf for ten cents, or to make any consid
erable reduction whatever. Yet millers in the Northwest
anticipate a reduction of about $1.50 per barrel on flour;
and to put it mildly, nobody complains that the bakers
are losing any money on present prices.
First of all, there should be a standard loaf of bread
standard in weight and in quality. Some cities are un
dertaking to establish such a loaf by ordinance. The
government itself ought to establish it for the whole
country. They let the food administration name the
lowest price that will give the baker a fair profit. If
the people save only one cent a loaf, it will be worth
while.
THEY ARE HERE.
Trousers for women have passed beyond the stage of
remote possibility. They are here as a settled fact. The
Ladies Home Journal prints a half page of pictures of
them. They are not treated as freaks, as future dreams.
They are headed "Work Clothes Original and Becoming"
and handled as a serious section of fall fashions. In
view of the Journal's well known conservatism, the
stamp of modesty and dignity may now be said to be set
upon the new garments.
Of course, the big department stores in large citlei
have been carrying neat little overall suits for some time.
And quite a number have been sold. But official approval,
so to speak, comes from the women's magazines. A wo
man may, in an unguarded moment, permit herself to
buy an unconventional garment, and she may wear it a
few times, or she may hang it in her closet and lack the
courage to put it on. But when a woman studies a fash
ion sheet and buys a numbered pattern and makes a gar
ment herself, she is going to get her labor's worth -ou:
of it before it is discarded.
In five years everyone will wonder why it was not
done before. The young woman of 1922, doing her house
work or her marketing or taking the car to her business
office clad according to the dictates of comfort and effi
ciency, will wonder how any woman ever got any work
done in the sloppy, hampering, unsanitary skirts they
used to wear, just as the young woman of today wonders
how her predecessor ever breathed in the choking collar?
and tight waistbands of a previous era.
BRIDGING THE ATLANTIC.
The U-boat peril has ceased to give serious concern.
It will doubtless remain a plague while the war lasts,
but the government is confident of being able to hold it
within limits. We shall be able to send men and mater
ials across the sea without fatal hindrance.
Only one American ship out of 200 has been sunk by a
submarine since we have entered the war. In no case
have the Germans succeeded in sinking a fast or big
ship. They have merelv picked off a few slow tanker-j
and freighters.
This good showing is due to the effective means found
for fighting the sea pirates. Improved methods have been
evolved and new devices Invented. Nets to ensnare the
unwary submarine, mounted guns on merchantmen,
smoke-boxes to Jiide a menaced ship, depth bombs that
explode under water, swarms of sea planes and destroy
ers patrolling the steamer lanes all these have had their
effect. And now there are hints of a marvellous inven
tion that will reveal the presence and location of any
U-boat and thus facilitate its destruction.
Meanwhile our ship supply is increasing enormously.
We have seized and utilized about 100 German vessels.
The government has commandeered 2,000,000 tons of
shipping in process of construction. Contracts have been
signed, or soon will be signed, for ships aggregating 3.
000,000 tons more. We shall have, in a year or so, ten
times as many ships in the foreign trade as we had three
years ago.
There's no need to worry. We're going to make a
bridge of ships across the Atlantic.
In a very long and very able editorial on the Uisbee de
portation of July 12, in which it is compared with many
similar conditions in this country and in Europe, the
Nogales Oasis conies to the following sage and sensible
conclusion: "The moral is that the-people do rule when
ever they find it necessary to declare themselves. They
may resort to lawlessness to do so. They have to. But
in the end they prevail, and in the end the real evils
complained of are eliminated. By all means let the peo
pie rule.

the democracies of the world are now
engaged in one great titantic struggle
to free the world from aul'ocracy, Im

Must Defend Country.
"I doube if there were many who
were so thoroughly shocked from cen
ter to circumference as I was with the
breaking out of the European war. But
it had i'o come. And I have asked my
self, as I would ask those other men
who have not yet awakened from their
delusion, is it not time to recognize
when your country and your home is
being ravaged and over ridden? Is it
not time to recognize that the red
blood in. America demands that be

low man or he ought to perish in the
struggle?

"Now there are some people who
have said that this question of the
declaration of war should have gone

there would be a band of a dozen or
more men who would endeavor to sur

you are considering the subject, dis

wife and your children whether you
would call a meeting for the delibera
tion of the subject and a vote as to
whether you should defend yourself.
"We want peace. To ask the gov
ernment of the United States now to
specifically state the terms of peace
Is to paly, consciously or unconscious

After referring to reports of German
defeats in Flanders, the speaker
shouted amid applause:
Back From Flanders.
"Back, back, back from Flanders,
back from Serbia; and back, bac!t
from France; and then perhaps we
may determine the conditions of
peace, but not until then.
Conscientious Objectors.
"Now, I kn'ow that there are some

they are opposed to war under all cir
cumstances non-resisterg and be
lieve that that is the way out. That
may be, somewhere in Tinibuctoo, but
not in Germany or Belgium or Serbia
or the United States.
For Rights of Minority.
"I hold that a man who is a traitor
to his country is upon a par with the
scab to his trade. I have a great ap
preciation and desire to see that the
rights of the minority are protected.
I believe tbat men have the right to
express their dissent, but the expres
sion of dissent is one thing and the
organizing of a movement to destroy
the will of the ma-ity that is not
right and cannot be tolerated.
Rights Guaranteed.
"As the result of the efforts made
by the American Federation of Labor
before war was declared, the stand
ards of American labor have been
guaranteed to be maintained and the
rights to which the toilers and the
masses "of our people are rightly en
titled will be guaranteed by the gov
ernment of our country.
"In the midst of war, there can be
no discusison of those who have the
guns trained upon them. As a result
of the effort put forth by the organi
zed labor movement, and agreement
was made between the secretary of
war and the president Kt the American
Federation of Labor by which the con
struction of cantonment work all
through the country should be carriea
on upon contracts based upon the uni
on scale of wages, union hvmrs and
union labor.
No Surrender of Principle.
"The American Federation of Labor

The process of heating water for domestic purposes has been revolutionized in the past
few years through the introduction and perfection of gas fired water heaters, until today
it is no longer a problem to secure an abundance of hot water quickly and economically
in any dwelling, large or small
Today, in the countless thousands of homes where gas fired water heaters are in
stalled, an abundance of hot water is available for any purpose. By some types of heat
ers the water is heated instantly at the turn of a faucet, by others, within a few min
utes after lighting the heaters, and all without labor, inconvenience or discomfort, and
at a reasonable cost for gas.

NEW YORK FINANCIAL.
NEW YORK, Sept. 5. Stocki re- j
covered In large part today from their I
severe reversal of the preceding ws-j
sion. but the rally met with consltl j
erabie opposition ana whs not i
coraplished without temporary impair
ment to important issues. Pennsyl
vania, for example, dropped to 45,
Us lowest quotation in over a score
of years, before rallying to 51.
Other ails were heavy or Irregular
most of the time, but Union Pacific
and other seasoned transportations
held their ground on part of their one
and two point advances.
The money market was perhaps the
most potent factor in effecting a re
adjustment of prices. Call loans were
offered at six per cent but the rate
dropped to four when no bids were
forth coming. I ater five per cent ruled
and some belated loans were made at
5 per cent.
The action of the treasury officials
in depositing funds of the allies with
local institutions evoked favorable
.comment and should go far towards
rectifying' last week's adverse bank
statement. Other events at Washing
ton also Induced short covering, es
pecially In coppers and steels, the for
mer leading the more vigorous rally
of the last hour.
United States Steel was sold tip
from 104, its low of the morning to
109 was forced to below 108. closing
at 107, a net gain of 3 points.
Total sales, 1.080.000 shares.
Bonds were active ranging from
heavy to irregular. Liberty 3"a
supplied a large part of the dealings
at the unusual variation of 99.62 to
99.90. Total bond sales, par value,
$4,480,000.
Government bonds, (old issues)
were unchanged on call.
GRAIN MARKETS.
CHICAGO, Sept. 5. Cold weather
stimulated a material advance today
in the value of corn. Prices closed
firm, 1 to 2 cents net higher at
$1.12 to $1.13 December and 1.0S
May. Wheat was entirely ignored by
the majority of dealers and was held
stable through the agencies of the
federal food administrator. Oats gain
ed to net. The outcome In pro
visions was a setback of 7 to 10 to
32 cents.
Notwithstanding that the corn mar
ket encountered heavy selling on the
upturn commission houses absorbed
the offerings freely and reactions were
all followed by prompt rallies.
A large share of the purchasing
seemed to be of an investment char
acter. Oats developed some independent
firmness aside from the strength due
to the corn bulge. Receipts of oats
remained moderate and even the ad
vanced failed to inspire liberal offer
ings from first bands.
Millers bought fair quantities of
wheat at government prices. It was
said demand for flour showed a mater
ial increase now that the value of
wheat had been Cied.
Provisions weakened as a result of
a sharp drop in hog quotations. " A
further depressing influence was the
delivery of much lard on September
contracts, about 00.000 pounds.
NEW YORK, Sept. 5. Today'a re
covery was but a natural sequence
considering the severe decline of the
past week. Although much of the
strength was due to a dslr- on the
part of the shorts to realize profits
and on some absorption influenced by
the reaction theory.
The betterment in prices was helped
by a Washington despatch which was
later denied that a price of $68 a ton
plus a 10 per cent bonus had been
fixed on steel and also that prices of
25 cents a pound on copper and $3S
per ton on pig iron had been fixed.
Money rates continue high and pros
pects of large private government fi
nancing will further tighten Jhe mon
etary situation.
As regards security values there Is
a less confindent feeling (n respect
to the stability of same even at the
current levels and the opinion la
gradually gaining ground that in or
dpr to conform to the new state of
things generally the incentive to In
augurate bullish tactics is at the pres
ent time lacking.
Values are more than likely inclin
ed toward a still lower level.
