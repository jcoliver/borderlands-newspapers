WASHINGTON. Feb. 26. Although
marked progress li disposing of legis

portant measures.
President Urges Speed
President Wilson had planned to go
to the capitol this afternoon to confer
with democratic leaders in an effort
to accelerate the work of congress,
but a prolonged meeting of his "war

Democratic Leader Martin today
urged greater speed upon committee
chairmen. He asked democratic sen
ators to defer prolonged speeches and
requested Senator Owen of Oklahoma,
and Senator Hitchcock of Nebraska to
abandon proposed speeches on the
constitution of league of cations. Sen
ator Owen spoke late in the day.

"We are the only nation in the
world among those associated with j
th9 overthrow of autocracy, and for:
the establishment of democracy, who

he said. "The realization of the prom-j

No equality of educational oppor

and cited the child taught in a hovel
with a poorly trained teacher, and
the pupil attending the most modern

WASHINGTON, Feb. 26. Homer S.
Cummings of Connecticut was elected
chairman of the national democratic
committee today, and the committee
voted a complete reorganization for
an aggressive campaign in 1920.
The committee adopted a resolution
greeting President Wilson on his re

gratulating him on his achievements
at the peace conference, and another
favoring the federal enfranchisement
of women. It also created a nation
wide woman's auxiliary.
Committeeman W. H. Hornbrook of

tending greetings and congratulations
to President Wilson. The resolution
called upon all citizens, irrespective of
political affiliations, to support the ef
lorts which President Wilson is mak
ing "in behalf of a world peace, sup
ported by all civilized governments."
Give Women Recognition
The resolution favoring the en
franchisement of women through an

and chairman of the woman's suffrage '
committee of the senate, who urged !

democratic senators generally to vote!
for it betore the adjournment of the
present congress.
A plan ' for an associate national
committee of women, proposed by Mrs.
George Bass of Chicago, was adopted.
.Members of this auxiliary committee,
the plan provides, are to be appointed
ty the chairman of the national com
mittee on nomination by the commit
teemen of the respecUve states until
oome uLferent method is adopted. The
plan also contemplates the election or
appointment of a woman as vice chair
man of every state and county commit
tee and in each congressional district,
the selection of a committeeman in
each state senatorial district, town,
ward or precinct, as the associates of
the corresponding male officials qf the
party in those sub-divisions. There is
to be constituted In each state and
territory a womans state executive
committee, composed ot the associate
member of the national committee, the
state vice chairman and the director
of education.
To Correlate Work
I The procedure suggested is not to
be obligatory in states where law or
party custom provides representation
J for women on such committees. The
advantage of this form of organization.

Senators said he expressed the opinion that the United
States would desire to become a mandatory of Armenia. On
the question of American sovereignty, the president was said
to have taken the position that recession of American sover
eignty, was not a new precedent, being incident of every
treaty.

The strength of the league would
rest on the friendship of America,
Great Britain, France, Italy and Japan,
the president said, and he expressed
the opinion the serious trouble be
tween these five nations was "un
thinkable." Should one of these
withdraw from the league or in any
way fail to support it, impotence of
the league might result.
Accounts of both aemocratic and
republican metnbersof the committees
!wh discussed the coiuerence varied
only in very minor details.
"The president " felt that if the
league is not ratified," said Chairman
Hitchcock, "there would be despair
throughout the world because of fail-

peace. Serious complications the presi

A Private
Accusation by Officer Is Equivalent to Conviction, Says Re
porter Lyon, Who Was With the Army in Europe ; Privates
Often Fear to Contradict Testimony of Their Superiors.
' BY CC LYON
N. E. A. Staff Correspondent Who was
With the U. S. Army In Europe
Thousands of boys who
fought inFrance are now re
turning to America, bitter in
their complaints against what
they term the injustice and
severity of courtmartial sen
tences. - Since my own return home,
numerous cases in American
training camps have been call
ed to my attention.
A number of officers "with strong
leanings hare told me that the court
martial system is a relic of by-gone
centuries and that now is tne time to
change it.
CHARGES MADE BY MEN
AND SOME OFFICERS
It is not up to me to prove the court
martial system good or bad, but here
are some of the charges that are being
made by enlisted men generally And
by some officers:
That charges are always preferred
.against an enlisted man by an officer
and that these charges are always in
vestigated by another officer;
That it Is axiomatic in the army that
the officer who brings the charges is
always right and the accused enlisted
man always wrong;
That the affidavit of an enlisted man
against the affidavit of an officer In
a court martial proceeding Is worth
nothing;
That the very atmosphere of courts
marital is such that an accused enlist
ed man and enlisted men witnesses
are scared and cowed from the very
beginning; ,
That both enlisted men and officers
hesitate to testify in behalf of the accused-enlisted
man, fearing pleas
ure of the officer who has brought the
charges and those who compose the
court;
That an enlisted man frequently
find3 it very difficult in securing the
services of some officer to defend him
and then the officer is seldom, If ever,
a lawyer;
That the general air of court mar
tials is that the accused is always
guilty and that it is up to him to
prove himself innocent;
cThat court martial cases are not
prepared or presented in a way cal

Owing to the report having gone

from California and other states are
coming to Bisbee and other places in
the county seeking employment, only
to be disappointed.
While Cochise county is doing road
work on a large scale, there is not
sufficient work of this nature to care

THE CASE OF THE SERGEANT
AND THE COFFEE MONEY
Of the scores of cases wherein the
unfairness and injustice of army court
martials are claimed, which have been
called to my attention, I will cite only
a few as typical:
A southern boy of good education
and family was sentenced to be dis
honorably discharged and to forfeit
all pay and allowances and to serve
two years In an army prison. As a
sergeant he was detailed to conduct
a number of men from a training
camp to an Atlantic port. The post
commander, before the party left,
trave the sergeant money to bur cof
fee en route for the men. When he
returned to the training camp he had
a balance of about $63 unexpended for
coffee. Because he waited 24 Hours
before going to the office of the camp,
cashier and turning this money In, he
was arrested, charged with . fraudu
lently attempting to convert this
money to his own use,
THIS BOY HAS SPUNK, AND
CARRIES HIS CASE UP
This boy, having more spunk than
the average boy who faces court mar
tials, refused to accept the sentence
and carried the case from one higher
authority to another until it reached
General Enoch Crowder, then judge
advocate general at Washington.
In a long written opinion which I
have read. General Crowder says:
"The evidence of record in this case
falls to prove felonious intent on the
part of the accused at the time the
money was collected or any fraud in
obtaining possession thereof. In fact,
quite the reverse is proven. As the
ecord stands, therefore, cue accused
has not been convicted on any legally
sufficient specification and it is rec
ommended that he be released from
confinement and restored to duty."
This would seem to give the accus
ed a clean bill of health, yet the facts
remain that some months after Gen
eral Crowder rendered this final deci
sion, THE boY IS STILL. ON DUi -AS
A PRIVATE. The officer who
brought the charges and the officers
who tried him still refuse to restore
him to his former rank, of sergeant.
OTHER CASES SHOWING
INJUSTICE TO PRIVATES .
Another boy was given three months
in the guard house for being absent
four months without leave. Some time
visors, we are not attempting to set a
standard for the contractors now en
gaged in work for the county nor for
the state highway department in con
nection with its work in Cochise coun
ty. The board will not expect private
employers of labor to follow by estab
lishing the same minimum," stated
Adams.
Jobs for Soldiers
"We feel that it is necessary ror
the county to take some action looking
to providing the returning soldiers
with employment and we do not feel
that $5 a day is too much to pay them.
The board of supervisors win endeav
or to give every unemployed Cochise
county soldier employment on the
roads and will make the salary suf
ficient to maintain him and his de
pendents. The boys who could build
trenches in France can build roads
in Arizona and if they need the jobs,
and hundreds of them will, we will
provide them."
I Chairman Adams stated that the
supervisors nave-Baa prepared an em
ergency bill to give boards of super
visors the power to make special lev
ies for road purposes and Senator
Roberts, a member of the board, is
now in Phoenix urging Its passage by
the legislature. The bill was passed
in the lower branch yesterday and
will come up in the senate today.
Friends of the measure hope to have it
go to the governor for signature this
week.
If there should be opposition to the
bill sufficient to prevent its becoming
a law, although none has been ex
pressed or is anticipated. Chairman
Adams stated that the board has an
other plan for providing the money.
He did not disclose this plan but was
quite confident that the board will
have the necessary money to carry
out its purpose in providing returned
soldiers with jobs at good pay.
The fact that the board will pay
$5 a day for road labor will have no
effect upon private enterprise or upon
the agriculturists of the country,"
stated Adams. "The returned soldier,
who is a farm hand and -can get a job
at the wages farmers are paying is
better off than he would be working
on the roads at $5 a day. The farm
hand who gets $30 a month and is
board will bave more at the end oi
the month than the man working on
the roads at ?5 a day.' he continued.
"At the present prices the man with a
little family will find that he is not
able to board any wealth at 55 a day,"
he added.
It is the purpose of the supervisors
to keep a record of soldiers employee

This sketch by Staff Artist Grove, who was with the United States army
in France, was drawn to illustrate Staff Reporter Lyon's article. It illus
trates a common occurrence when a private Is called upon to testify in a
court martial case in which an officer has accused another private. Fear of
reprisals on the part of the officer keeps the private from speaking out.
later this same boy was given five
years at Fort Leavenworth military
prison by another court martial for be
ing absent sixty days without leave.
A sergeant was brought before a
court martial charged with being
drunk. Two officers swore that he
was not drunk, because they had seen
him and talked with him during the
time another officer charged him with
being drunk, yet he was convicted and
evidence against him was that nine
months previous, he had been convict
ed for being drunk.
Another boy is now "serving five
years in prison for having brought a
bottle of whisky into an army reser
vation. .Another boy is swerving two years
in prison charged with having driven
an army truck outside a reservation
at a time prohibited by army orders.

"KAMERAD GUN" IS
DISPLAYED IN COURT
(By Review Lease 3 "Wire)
NEW YORK, Feb. 26. A weapon
which could easily be concealed in the
palm of a man's hand and which was
described as a "kamerad gun" because
it was used by Germans after holding
up their hands in token of surrender
toshoot their American captors, was
displayed in court today by Alexander
P. Watson, a Y. M. C. A. secretary of
Knoxville, Tenn., as the reason for his
arrest. Watson, who arrived in the
city today, couldn't resist the tempta
tion to show the weapon to a police
man who promptly arrested him as
a violator of New York's Sullivan law
against carrying concealed weapons.
Watson testified he arrived, at New
port News, Va., from France last Tues
day and brought back the gun as a
souvenir. He was wounded twice and
gassed once while serving as a Y. M.
C. A. representative with the Ninth
infantry, and received the second
wound from "kamerad gun" he now
carries, he said. He explained that
while working with stretcher bearers
he saw a German officer who held his
hands up and shouted "kamerad." He
started toward the German when the
latter lowered his hands and fired the
gun, the bullet striking Watson in the
wrist. American soldiers shot and
killed the German.
Watson's story and his exhibit won
his immediate discharge by the court.

falling through and he lied to keep
the boy from being acquitted.
A boy went to his own post ex
change and bought a pair of wrapped
leggings which were openly offered
for sale and which were worn by the
boys in many nearby organizations.
His idea was to look as neat as pos
sible. He was arrested by the military
police of his organization, thrown into i
the guard house and later brought be
fore a court martial. He was fined
two-thirds of one month's pay. The
offense charged was wearing other
than a regulation uniform, although

General Crowder Tells Com
mittee 5000 Cases Tried
During War Are to Be
Reviewed by Special Board
(By Review Leased Wire)
WASHINGTON', Feb. 6. Major
General Crowder, judge advocate gen
eral of the army, appearing before he
senate military committee today at
a resumption of hearings on the court
martial situation, said that all prison
sentences imposed on men of the army
during the war. and found upon re
view to be too severe, would be miti
gated through the president's power
of remission.
General Crowder said that within
60 days the 5.000 sentences imposed
since the beginning of hostilities
would be reviewed by a special hoard
headed by Brigadier General Samuel
T. Ansell. who was acting judge advo
vate general during the war and whose
testimony as to severity of court mar
tial sentences led the committee to
extend its investigation.
! Steps toward mitigating the sen
: tences were begun. General Crowder
i said, prior to the investigation by -the
senate committee. Practically all the
aisnonoraDie aiscnarge provision re
voked. He added that 1.200 men sen
tenced to long terms at Leavonworth,
Kan., had been honorably restored to
duty in the last year. r
Provisions of the pending Chamber
lain bill authorizing .review bv the
judge advocate general of court mar
tial sentences were opposed by Gen
eral Crowder, who said it would give
the judge advocate general extremely
broad powers and authority to admin
ister the entire system of army dis
cipline. He indicated that many times
the commanding officer in the field
was in a better position to review the
case.
I Lieutenant Colonel Alfred E. Clark,
I of the judge advocate general's office,
! who preceded General Crowder before
i the committee, testified that only a
!'fw of 15.000 or 20.000 court mar-
lial verdicts handed down during the
war were criticized as too severe. All
classes of men were brought into the
army through the draft, se said, and
it was necessary to punish insubordi-
I nation severely.

No Abandonment of Borderland
There seems to be some misapprehension among officials in Cochise
county as to the purpose of Pima county in issuing bonds to complete the
road from Vail to the Cochise county line near Benson. Some Cchiso
county officials, with whom the wish is apparently father to the thought,
have taken it for granted that the purpose of Pima county is to abandon
the Lorderland route from Vail through Davidson canyon to Huachuca,
Tombstone, Bisbee. This is not the purpose of Pima county in making
an appropriation for the construction of the Benson road. It is to make
that city, WIllcox and other towns of the San Pedro and Sulphur Springs
valley more accessible to Tucson that the money is being expended on
the Benson road.
The Borderland route will always be the most used by tourists." It "
is the most scenic of the two and the best in all weathers. Pima county
and the state have considerable work yet to do on the road in Pima
county and near Empire Ranch but the road is splendid for the greater
part of its extent In this county.
It is reported that work on the Borderland route three miles west of
Tombstone has been abandoned or ts to be abandoned by order of the
Cochise county supervisors. Such a course would be a breach of faith
with Pima county which expects Cochise to connect up with the Border
land route. Many thousand dollars were expended on the road through
Davidson canyon and if Cochise county is to abandon the improvement of
the Borderland, this expenditure will be partially lost.
If Cochise county persists in this policy of ditching the Borderland
route, the chamber of commerce here should send a delegation to Tomb
stone and see if some arrangement cannot be made to carry out the under
standing that has prevailed for years, that the two counties would co
operate in improving the Borderland route across southern Arizona.

New Spirit of Service
We saw someting in an old exchange the other day that made us
feel pleasantly warm to our mental toes.
That faith-renewed-in-humanity radiance that occasionally we feel
unexpectedly we chance on a token of man's, innate decency.
It was a "display advertisement of a leading merchant.
This "ad" contained nothing but Lincoln's Gettysburg speech and this
foreword from the merchant:
"TO THE YOUNG MEN OF THE CITY:
"On this day, the anniversary of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, I can
perform, for you no higher service than to print here the beloved presi-.
dent's Gettysburg address; and to ask you to read it again earnestly,
thoughtfully from Its first word to Its last."
This sort of a thing is big.
When a business man for a day dedicates his business to commemor
ate and keep alive the spirit of Lincoln he is doing something indeed.
The war introduced the patriotic note into store advertising, and now
it seems that some leaders are going to go farther and promote good
citizenship without thought of profit.
Business men and firms generally are feeling the throb of this new
spirit of service, and the contribution of the nation's 'business men In
paid patriotic publicity during the war was worthy much more attention
and praise than it received.
Business need not be selfish to be successful. Some of the biggest
businesses of the nation today are the least grasping. .
t Leagues and Circles
Whn a prominent naval officer remarked that the League of Nations
was developing Into a sewing circle, he had no idea of paying a compli
ment. Rather the reverse! But a little consideration of the sewing circle
makes- the compliment not so doubtful after alL
A sewing circle is a company of the better type of citizens who
meet regularly and do constructive work with various fabrics for the
good of others. Perhaps our friend the admiral was nearer right than
he Intended to be, and said something a lot nicer than the thing he really
meant.
Furthermore, the Influence of the sewing circle in any community
Is distinctly for the public good. It will tolerate nothing which menaces
the public welfare, and the gossip of which it is so often accused is
aimed at any real or suspected transgression of laws which tend to pre
serve decency and safety. Moreover, many a contemplated fracture of
those laws has been averted by the guilty consciousness of what the
sewing circle would think of it.
As a matter of fact, if a good many of our public institutions held
a little more to the code of morals which governs these simple gatherings
of good women, there would be less occasion for complaint at the way
public affairs are run.
More power to the League if it does preserve some homely virtues
like talking things outj instead of fighting them out, and doing actual
constructive work, not for the benefit of those who do not need help, but,
like the sewing circle, for those who do. Tucson Star.
It Just Sounds Big
The German republic's new constitution provides a salary of $240,000
and residence quarters in the former royal palace of. Bellevue for the
president. ,
Considered comparatively, it seems large remuneration for a republic
that's going to be skinned, drawn and quartered for war indemnities but.
really, it's no sinecure. The president has got to be man enough to
collect his pay out of about 16 different varieties of Hun political fac
tions, most of which don't believe in paying for anything, gouging or
outright robbery being so much cheaper. ' .
Then, too, President Ebert is likely to look from the royal palace
window, some beautiful morning, and see the owner come riding across
the drawbridge on a war horse clad in steel, swinging the good old
Hohenzollern cleaver and athirst for republican blood. Forsooth! $20,000
the month and a bed on the tip top of the royal palace isn't a bit too much,
when you consider the chances of dying standing up in your boots before
the first pay day arrives, are considered. . ,
The agreement to arbitrate will settle everything nicely if the league
13 careful to exclude thugs who have peculiar notions about agreements
and scraps of paper.
In this new era of brotherly love, shall we cling to the theory that
heathen countries are logical prey for Christian countries?
The Hun insists that a punished Germany will be a menace to the
world. Quite true. But less a menace than an unpunished Germany.
There is one hope for humanity when statesmen turn their backs on
kings and give beed to the desires of a sweaty individual in overalls.
The most consoling experience a woman ever has is to call un
expectedly and find another woman's house in a mess.
Frau Ebert says she will cling to the simplicity of private life.
They all feel that way at first, but they are all human.
Bat what assurance have we that the nations left out of the bic
one will not form a bush league?

Beat way to sell your furniture or

Finney, sr., auctioneer. Phone 257.
Judging from the countless pre para-
tions and treatments which are con-
tinually" being advertised for the pur-1
pose of making thin people fleshy, j
developing arms, neck and bust, and
replacing ugly hollows and angles by
the soft curved lines of health and
beauty, there are evidently thousands
of men and women who keenly feel
their excessive thinnesv
Thinness and weakness are usually
due to starved nerves. Our bodies
need more phosphate than is contained
in modern foods. Physicians claim
! there is nothing that will supply this I
' deficiency so well as the organic phos-1
, phate known among drugeists as bitro-'
phosphate, which is inexpensive and
is sold by J. M. Ball in Bisbee and
most all druggists under a guarantee :
of satisfaction or money back. By i
feeding the nerves directly and by j
supplying the body cells with the ne-i
cessary phosphoric food elements, bi-to-phosphate
quickly produces a wel
come transformation in the appear-'
ance; the increase in weight frequent
ly beng astonishing.
This increase in weight also carries
with it a general Improvement in the '
health. Nervousness, sleeplessness and
lack of energy, which nearly always .
accompany excessive thinness, soon -disappear,
dull eyes become bright and
pale cheeks glow with the bloom of ,
perfect health. ,
CAUTION: Although bitro-phos-j
hate is unsurpassed for relieving ner-'
vousness, sleeplessness - and general
weakness, it should not, owing to its re
markable flesh-growing properties, be
used by anyone who doe3 not desire
to put on flesh.
