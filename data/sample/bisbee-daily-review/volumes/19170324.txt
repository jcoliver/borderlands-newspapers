WASHINGTON. Mar.
erican government has decided upon
sweeping measures to be put into ef
fect following the expected declara
tion by congress soon after It meets
April 2 that a state of war exists be
tween the United States and Germa
ny. Fully appreciating Germany's
policy of acting In war first and talk
ing afterwards, the government has
determined to provide against every
possible emergency.
P.road nuestions involve wre dls-!
cussed today at a long cabinet meet
ing to which heads of departments
carried reports on preparations . al
ready made and others contemplated.
Details are being taken up between
President Wilson and the individual ;
cabinet members.
Far Reaching Steps
Regretfully the government ap
parently ha decided that since '
Germany is making war uoon the
United State throuph ruthless
killing of American and destruc
tion of their shin, the issue most
be met with steps much more far
raachiag than, mere attempt to
protect individual merchant craft,
If anything is ahead to prevent
thi It is not now foreseen. Once
a state of war is declared to ex
ist, aggressive measure are ex
pected to be taken.
No Half Way Measures
As outlined after today's cabinet
meeting, the preparations of the gov
ernment are not to be for a short war
or a war marked by half way meas
ures. Nothing is to be taken for
granted. A complete program has
been prepared so that everything
done will be carried out in a system
atic and orderly manner.
No Political Alliance
The exact measures of American
participation in the war is not expect
ed to be revealed until after the Pres
ident addresses congress and until j
public sentiment crystalizes. So far
as known no political alliance with
the entente allies is contemplated, al
though military as well as naval co
operation is possible and the govern
ment will be unsparing in both money
, and- supplies for the allies. 1
The President has not yet
written hit address to congress.
He i expected to be specific and
to make clear that the American
government and people have no
quarrel with the German people
but cannot tolerate the acta of
the German government,
" Army May Join France
Whether an army will be sent
abroad is one of the questions of the
future. It would take many months
to train an army for such service and
many things may happen in that peri
od. But this possibility is being tak-
e.n into consideration and the govern-'
ment proposes to be ready for it as
soon as practicable.
Detailed plans requiring congress-1
ional action are expected to be com
plete when congress meets. Prior to
that time the Democratic and Repub
lican leaders of the senate and house
will be here to confer with the Presi
dent and the cabinet. Speaker Clark
and Representative Kitchin returned
to Washington today.

of endeavor. Is expected to play an
important part in the conduct of act
ual warfare. Through it and through
individuals and organizations many
proffers of help and cooperation have
come from all parts of the country.
Nation on War Basis
The measures decided upon are
military, naval, industrial and finan
cial They are understood to be most
comprehensive. All are receiving the
personal attention of the President.
Army Plana Coming
The army plans have been fully
drawn and a portion of them may be
come evident at any time. Some are
contingent upon action by congress.
Their first object will be to fully pro-
ct the United States against any
contingency.
The navy program, aside from the
actual movements of existing ships,
contemplates the building of vessels
of all classes just as rapidly as the
resources of the nation will permit
and the manning of them as fa si as
they are constructed. Secretary Dan
iels will confer with private builders
tomorrow.
The industrial plans, now beta? co
ordinated by the council of national
defense. Include the mobilization of
skilled and unskilled labor for the
manufacture of munitions in as large !
quantities as possible and also for the 1
continuance of all necessary indus
tries. Secretary Wilson, in coopera-1
tion with the council of national de-1
fense, has these plans well under I
way.
More Munitions For Allies
Just how much money will be asked
of congress baa not been revealed. A
movement is well under way for fur-!
niBhing the entente 'allies with an
enormous loan, either in the form of!
credits or money. It also is under
stood that the supply of munitions
for the allies will be augmented rath
er than diminished.

ident saw Governor McCall of Massa

of them bad denied that they had

SUMMARY
Teiniirarily. at least, the German
reiirtmeiil in trance appears to have
naiieii. as both tue iintish and French
communications report counter at
tacks and siuoborn resistance at vari
ous points. Notwithstanding tnis ap
parent change iu German tactics, tne
liiitibh report progress southeast ot
Arras; and the French, Paris says,
have moved forward between one and
a quarter ana two and a hall miles
in Uie St Quentin region.
Tue French troops also have made
gams in the heights overoloking the
Oise valley nortneast of Tergnier and
nave repulsed German attacks beiore
Tniel, northeast of Kheims. Paris as
serts that tne Germans are inundating
the Oise region and that the city of
La Fere, thought to have been one of
the string points in the German line,
is under water.
South of the Oise the French con
tinue to cross the AifKte river and
north of Soissous. I'aris says, consid
erable progress has been made toward
Margival. Stubborn resistance by ttie
Germans is said to have marked the
French success north of the canal be
tween the Somme and Oise in which
much ground was gained.
From Beaurains, about two miles
south of Arras, to Etreillers five miles
west of St Quentin, London reports,
encounters between British and Ger
man forces. At Vrauxcourt and at
two points in the center of the line,
German counter attacks are said to
have been repulsed and the British
position maintained. Southeast f
Arras, near Etourt and Croisilles, the
British made further gains.
The latest official statement from
Berlin 6ays the French were repulsed
in the attacks along the Somme-Crozat
canal, between the Somme and the
Oise and that 2"0 prisoners were taken
by the Germans.
Except for French activity near
Monastir, in Serbia, and Russian ad
vances in Persia there have been no
important operations tin the other bat
Ue fronts. North of Monastir, after
a violent fight. Kill 1248 remained in
.he bands of the French. Paris says
he German and Bulgarian troops made
troops made repeated unsuccessful at
tack to gain possession of the hill.
Berlin reports a "harrassing lire" by
the Trench near MVmastir and says a
partial. a.uuck took place between
Lakes Ocluida anl l'resba, to tne
wpstward.
Southwest of KeriLanshah, I'frsia,
the Russians have progressed to with
in 45 miles of the Mesopotamian bor
der, according to Petrograd. This
would bring the Russians to within
100 miles of the British force that has
been advancing up the Diaia river
fi'jm Bagdad. In a sixteen hour bat
tle near Kerin. Petrograd also reports,
the Turks were forced to retreat to
Kerind.
The Russians , attacked the Turks
along the river Shirwan, a tributary
of the Diala.
It is reported unofficially that Ger
many has notified Norway of the ex
tension of the blockade zone to the
Arctic Ocean tj 'include the waters
accessible to the ports of northern
Russia.

AGAINST S. P. ROAD
BY DOUGLAS BODY
(By Review Leased Wire)
DOUGLAS. Mar. 23. The arbitrary
attitude of the Southern Pacific rail
road in persistently refusing to in
stall Pullman service between Phoe
nix and Douglas is to result fn repris
als against the road, according to Os
car K. Goll, secretary ofthe chamber
of commerce of Douglas. Mr. Goll
states that the El Paso & Southwest
ern railway is willing to pick up the
Pullman at Tucson, but that the S. P.
refuses to handle the car over its line
cluiming it will not pay.
The matter of Pullman service be
tween Douglas and Phoenix has been
up for the past year, but in spite of
the unanimity of sentiment in its fav
or on the part of the (raveling pub
lic, it has been impossible to secure
the service. Mr. Goll says this is due
almost entirely to the attitude of the
Southern Pacific.
In order to give the Southern Pa
cific a new viewpoint on the matter,
Mr. Goll is planning to write to all
commercial organizations in south
erst ern Arizona and ask that the mer
chants in those towns route their
freight east over the Santa Fe to El
Paso and thence over the E. P. S.
W where this is possible. Even iri
towns on the Southern Pacific in this
part of the 6tate that road can be de
prived of the long haul if the con
signee so wishes
Since the Southern Pacific seems to
look at everything from the stand
point or profit arid loss; it is planned
to fight the road on its own basis, and
by cutftng in on the freight, business
cause the road to see the advantaee
of giving more consideration to the
wishes of their passengers, Mr. Goll
states.

NEW YORK, Mar. 2?.. The most
Impressive feature of today's market
a buoyant movement in rails did
not develop until the Cnal hour. The
rise in that group which ran from 2
to 4 points in leading issues, was con
current with the receipt of advices
' that the interstate coramerre coin
mission had been petitioned by the
railroads for a general advance of 10
to IS percent to meet increased oper
ating expenses under the Adamson
;law. '.
Strongest of the railway list were
Union Pacific, Canadian Pacific, Read
Ins. New York Central, New Haven
and Fries, with unusual activity in
Som hern Railway, Wabash, Missouri,
Kansas and Texas preferred. Kansas
City Southern. Wbeeline and Lake

tively slight improvement, except for
National Lead which was in steady
demand at a gain of 3 to 63. Oils,
papers, sugars. Central Leather. In- i
dustrial Alcohol and American Wool
en kept moderate pace with the ad
vance in other specialties, which was
featured by an advance of S'i to 72?

(By L. J. Overlock) 1
NEW YORK. Mar. 23. It has been '
a long time since the rails displayed
as much buoyancy as today. The buy
ing was decidedly vigorous and the
scarcity of offerings made it difficult
for shorts to cover. Many of the stan
derd rails are lending at rates con- J
siderably below the renewal rate for
call loans and in quite a Tew instanc
es the short interest is so large as to
dictate Hat terms. Consequently to
day's strength was not surprising and
judging by the manner in Which the 1
rails have been accumulated for j
n?oni.;s and the character of the cie-:
mand today, a higher range of prices
is quite probable. Some of the indus
trials will probably lag for awhile
' though Steel, by far still seems to be :
the cheaper of that type of stocks.

THE GREATEST LODGE IN THE WORLD.
That the people of the Warren District, of Cochise
county, of Arizona and cf the country are not entirely
lacking in patriotism is shown by the increasing number
of "colors' which are being' brought into prominence.
During the la.st Several weeks the number of small lapel
emblems, bearing the flag of the United States, have
gradually increased and have treated a most favorable
comment.
One man, wearing one of such flags, was riding on a
local street car, several days ago. An acquaintance looked
at it and asked:
i'What lodge does that represent?" .
"That represents the greatest lodge in the world
American citizenship."
So it is, and now that we appear to be on the brink of
a war which is not our making, when we are trying to do
what is right with an European adversary, and possibly
a Latin American nation, it is extremely fit and proper
that the people should fly their colors. In the hustle and
bustle of the every-day American's life, he is busily oc
cupied. He has little time for much other than to thin
of his immediate work. In that very manner is he aiding
in the upbuilding of a greater America but latent respect
for the emblem of this great country is sometimes lost
in the occupation.
Consequently when the spirit of America is aroused,
as it most certainly is at tie present time, the flying
of the flag is proper. It is the personification of a deter
mination, of-a righteousness of spirit, of a will to win
that which is right, and a basis of judgment which 4s, in
its finest sense, the greatest justice known in the world.
The flag of the United States, forty-eight stars on a
field of blue, and thirteen stripes on a field of red, should
mean the swelling of the breast in pride, the uncovering
of the head in justice to our standards and our nation
and a determination to die, If necessary, for all that these
things represent.
The time has come in this great country for its cos
mopolitan parts to Americanize themselves or be Ameri
canized. The nation's bounty has been poured upon all
who have entered. Its good will has been given to the
lowliest and the highest Its institutions have been open
to all. Discrimination has been an unknown factor. Now
is the time to prove that this government built upon a
Republican form of government and its greatest and
most enduring disciple shall not waver when confront
ed with a necessity of purpose.
So thow your colors! Ad American citizen Las every
thing to Ik- proud of and nothing that should militate to
make of him a dastard or a craven Image.
"Lost; two onions somewhere in the Warren District,'
reads a want ad in the Review. This is merely a bus
gestion but it might be easier to safeguard such valuable
produce if garlic could be purchased instead. Further
more, its effe t is (on the other fellow) much the same.
Twenty Second Infantry is leaving the Arizona border
' the Warren District for several months lata summer
after more than two years service bcrc. It cam pel iu

for it, from its commandiug officer to its last recruit, is

POLICE AND MERIT.
Tucson's police department, on April 1, is to be put
upon a merit basis. Chief of Police Bailey, of that city,
will introduce a system at that time by which his officers
may strive to better conditions in the Old Pueblo and in
turn receive actual marks of commendation from the
community.
According to an announcement from the Old Pueblo,
the system provides that the officer making the largest
number of bona fide arrests each month shall receive a
merit mark. This mark is an initial cr a letter in bis
name, to be put upon his badge. A bona fide-arrest, fur
ther according to the announcement, shall be one upon
which a conviction has been made.
It sounds good, of course; but the. question naturally
rises is a bona fide arrest always or, as a general rule,
the proper basis upon which merit should be judged?
We are Inclined to say that merit should not be judged
upon so narrow a basis.
Commonly understood, the police officers are supposed
to iunt down crime and criminals. In reality the work
of a police officer is to prevent crime, to eliminate the
necessity of making even bona fide arrests. His dutiej
sometime make of him a counciliator of the first degree,
a family sort of a Burke. His work is so varied that
many times the most inactive officer, so far as arrest?
and convictions are concerned, is sometimes entitled to
the greatest mark of merit
Stopping men and women from acts which make crime
is entitled to more commendation than apprehending the
law violators after a crime is committed. If a reprimand.
before, can prevent . a later crime, surely the officer who
is responsible should be rewarded. So much for the
Lasis of merit which the Tucson Chief intends to inaug
urate. Merit systems, like Iillies of the valley in rocky or
barren scil, have difficulty thriving in communities where
politics have full swing. Only where civil service has
been developed to a surprising degree can merit really J
be administered bo that it will be effective and will work
for the benefit of the man and the community in later
days and years.
In Tucson, for instance, the present administration has
a bare two years to set its system in motion. The people,
in the meantime, may decide they want a change. The
.necming officials may not admive the system and the
result it nil. Place the system on merit generally, the
appointment, the promotion and the retention in offiee
on the same basis, and it will work.
The outcome of Chief Bailey's experiment will be
watched with much interest all over the state and with
some misgivings. . .

IS HE RIGHT?
Onc of the leading members of El Paso's Pep.'PuFh
and Progress excursion, which visited Bisbee and the
Warren District Thur&day afternoon and evening, seems
to think that Arizonans are prone in meddlesomeness.
It is a different word for what Arizonans Jiave been
proud, or ashamed, to term "progressiveness." The man
in question has been a resident of the Southwest for
many years. He has lived in New Mexico, in El Paso
county and is thoroughly acquainted with Arizona.
"It is hard to understand why you Arizona people are I
so prone to enact legislation which is so subsersive of
the individual; so stringent of everyone and of every
thing," said the visitor. "You have a great state, great
possibilities, great industrial progress. In fact your pro
gress industrially is" wonderful. But in spite of all that,
in spite of the wonderland of money w.'iich you seem to
possess, I would say that your people's meddlesomeness j
offsets the great amount of good you possess. '
"New Mexico is called a reactionary stale. It has lx-en j
held up to scorn by you Arizona people. I bavc lived '
L-here and know its conditions well. I will say this, how-
ever: The people there are more willing to trust the in
dividual' aud are not likely to attempt to pass a law for
each and every man. woman, child and burro iu the
state."
Is her right? '

FATS.
There are few Jack Sprats left in the world. Every- ;
body is coming to a cudden realization of the value of '
fats. Lard in Germany is worth almost its weight in
silver. Aa fat piece of bacon is beyond price. Soap, for
which fat is necessary, is a luxury. All the belligerents
are feeling the same scarcity. Fats are to be doled out
as rations in England. Prices everywhere are soaring.
And the United States does not escape. Pork and pork
products have riseu to unprecedented figures.
The war has done it. It has been called "a war of j
fats." Fats and oils are needed in vast quantities as
lubricants, and still more for making products that eutct
into the manufacture of ammunition, especially gly
cerine j
Tbo people of Europe have come to realize keenly what
au important part fats play in the vital processes of the
human body. There, too. they act as lubricants and pro
tide fuel for heat and energy aud materia! for the min
ute explosion involved in physical growth and repair.
The war has robbed the bodies of men, women and chil
dren. It has been observed already that tuberculosis is
spreading to au alarming extent, especially iu Germany
aud Austria.
Such facts briug homo to Americans, with a shock,
the huge waste ow which we arc guilty. It is likely that
wc still throw away as much fat iu various forms as
would buflice for the p'i.ical necdJ of all Germany or
France. Millions of poun.'lj of fat .aud grease run dowu

quotation, from the statutes govern

lighten any voters who are in doubt
as to their qualifications to cast a bal
lot today: "Only uch persons may
vote at such elections as have paid in
their own name a county or state tax
upon property situated within such
district, other than poll, road or
school tax, during the preceding year
and who are in all other respects
qualified electors for the purpose of
voting regular school elections."

that there are 4004 boys and girls be
tween the ages of six and twenty-one
years in the district: 2031 boys and

Gus Hickey, Very Much Alive
Denies Report That He is
Dead Through Telegram
From Editor of Coast Paper.
A report was circulated in r.isboo .
last night that Oris Hickey. will
known Bisbi-e resident, had died cs-j
terday at his summer home in S.m
Diego, Calif. Although doubting the
authenticity of the rumor. The Re
view wired to the Pally Vnion. in San
Diego, for the facts. The following
telegram from the. editor of The Tn
ion, who is evidently a strong booster
for California climate, speaks for it
self: 'Gns Hickey Is very much alifo.
Declares reports of his death greatly
exaggerated. Says he nwer felt bet
ter. You should know people never
die in Sun Diego on account of won
derful healthy climate."
Members of The Review staff, who
have worked on The San Diego Un
ion, replied with the following tele
gram: "You are wrong. Everybody in
San Piego except Gus Hickey has
been dead since t'abrillo discovered
'an Piego harbor."
No further comment wa3 received
'rom the San Diego scribes.
BANGS TO LECTURE
TUESDAY EVENING
The position in the world of letters

r.ps America's foremost humorist,
nakes noteworthy the announcement
hat be is to appear on the Lyceum
,ourse this $ason. Mr. Bangs brings
o the lecture platform the same dis
Inctlve quality of humor that char
tcterizes his writings. It is not the
lap stick variety, but the keen, Incls-
e, brilliant brand of laugh making.
e appeals the mentality of his cud
ances, and while he tells a marvelous-
Interesting story of personal assoc
..tion with the great and near-great
f America and England, he illumin
ates the story with a charming side
omment which keeps his hearers in a
continual state of hilarity. His lan
;uage is chaste, his manner the per
jnilication of dignity, and his lecture
a gratifying proof that a man may be
jnny without resorting t the clown
intics sometimes identified with plat
form humor. Mr. Bangs will lecture
n the high school auditorium, Tues
lay night, the last program of the ly
:eum course.
EVANGELIST CAMPAIGN

Four big meetings will be held Sun
